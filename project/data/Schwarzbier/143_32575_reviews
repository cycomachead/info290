"OK beer not great not horrible"
""
"O: Definitely not false advertising since it tastes like its name.  Black. Not going back."
""
"Really not a very good beer."
""
"Taste is roasted malt, sweet chocolate, and earthy/barky hops.  Similar to an American black ale.  The body is too light compared to what I am used to for either style.  This is not a bad beer, but falls just below average for the scope of what I have had in the style.  Nothing I would skip getting a variety pack for, but nothing to rush out for either."
"A beer with a nice transition from lager to a coffee taste."
"I liked beer quite a lot. Smooth malty nice head. Fair lacing. A bit thin for this style. Overall a solid brew in my opinion."
"Great tasting dark lager with a hint of chocolate. This beer has a very crisp after taste."
"3/1 - Bottle. Very light, will minimal aroma. Smooth dark pour, very light texture. Light taste and pour, very light and easy going down. Decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad at all, but I would go to Guinness before this."
"Overall: very good for the style"
""
"The nose holds many of the the qualities of a bock beer with a smoky, caramel malt, grain, barley and carbonative aroma. The flavor is a bit sweet with a toffee maltiness, barley, grain and light chocolate malt. It just tastes cheap and detracts from the overall experience."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cola color dark brown with a slight garnet hue .  Clear and has a tan head of thinnish foam that lasted well and left lace.   Nose is malty, cocoa, and dark malts. Dry biscuit and bit of  faint caramel.   Taste is good, follows the nose.  malty but has less complexity on the palate than on the nose.  That caramel is soft but stronger in the drink than on the nose. Finishes with a small touch of something bitter  but nothing full blown. Tiny bit of char to come forward at the very last moment of the swallow.  Darn good."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is great. Has the right balance and holds a touch to many black lagers. Very easy finish. Great smooth and bitter taste."
""
"Underrated and just rare enough to catch my eye at the pub."
""
"O - just as I remember it, good flavor, good representation of a Schwarzbier, but nothing spectacular. I'd get this in a pinch if needed but wouldn't search it out in the future."
""
""
""
"Tastes like a slightly stronger variant of a Shiner Bock."
""
"I like beer and this is beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh. I've had worse. Skip it."

"Overall, a solid if not spectacular beer, this could be an interesting alternative to traditional lagers, refreshing but more substantial than what many may be used to in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer and great price."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Nice Schwarzbier.  I could revisit this one again this winter.  Easy to drink and enjoyable."

"Overall (4.22) : I would drink this again and again. Much better poured than in a bottle. This may not be the finest Schwarzbier out there (I'm sure, as this is my first) but this beer is pretty tasty. I'll drink this again in the future."
""
"Not a fave. Too much carbonation for my liking. Decent taste. Just not what I want in a black lager."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An average Schwarzbier, I really love Spoetzl Brewing but this one didn't drive me crazy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not recommended. You can get much better examples elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"I'd rather have a Guiness."
"Overall:  Its been a while since I last enjoyed this beer and it still is as enjoyable as I remember.  This is a great beer when you want a dark beer with roasted notes without being too heavy.  This is also a great alternative to those not wanting a nitro Guinness since it offers a similar dryness.  As long as you don't go in expecting a full-bodied porter or stout, this is a great beer that I would love to pair with some oysters or smoked cheese."

"Overall: Average. Ok for casual drinking, but it does not have anything that stands out."
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable, but it's a little too heavy for me to want another one but it wasn't heavy enough to be noteworthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with faint ruby highlights at the edges and a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Aromas of caramel and burnt sugars with just a hint of chocolate and a faint earthy hop to counter. The flavor is malty sweet with lots of darker sugars and melanoids and just a hint of earth, chocolate, and light fruit. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent dark lager, probably my favorite from the mix."

"O: Nice and refreshing with a little bit of roast. Not a fan of the long sweetness at the end, primary downside. I think I'd say this is more like an English mild ale."
""
"A very quaffable brew with a surprisingly complex flavor that leaves a good feeling in the tummy. Purchased as part of a variety pack for about $8.50. I'm really getting into this variety pack from a brewery whose products just arrived in my town."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.75): A very drinkable beer in my opinion, especially in the price bracket that this brand falls into, this is a very good substitute for some of the more expensive beers of this style."

"Picked up a mixed Shiner six to try the brewery. This one has a similar appearance to the others I have tried so far. They seem to all look the same except color. Same with smell. Not a lot going on there. But the taste is pretty good on this one. Nice roasted flavor and pretty smooth with no aftertaste. Overall I am finding the Shiner beers to be decent, and this one I would certainly drink again, although I also would not go out of my way to get by any stretch."
""
"i actually got this black lager from a friend who didnt like it- but he's a bud drinker, so i knew that didnt mean anything. I think its pretty good. the color is dark- not opaque...there is an almost deep garnet color when you hold it up to the light. there isnt much going on in the nose at all, maybe some faint spices- but im going out on a limb for that one. the taste is nutty, not too bitter....with a surprisingly smooth finish."

"Dark, opaque brew with a yellowish head that dissipates quickly. Minimal head retention or lacing. Slightly sour aroma. Smoky taste that is smooth, but didn't make much of an impression ... The taste is not something that would have me recommending this beer although I would drink it in the future if someone gave me one. Pleasant mouth feel -- creamy."

"Overall: Goes down pretty easy, good toasted and roasted malt flavors."
""
"Taste is light, crisp, dry hint of licorice and molasses, prune, coffee but a bit thin and light, with faint sweetness and bitterness, dry finish with hint of coffee bitterness. It has enough character to keep it reasoanbly enjoyable for a bit but it is not memorable at all and can get tiresome fairly easily."
""

"not as dark and roasty and complex as the more authentic beers in this style, but a plenty sessionable dark lager that is still at least a step better than say the chive beer that just came out. more red than black in color, especially in the light, with a short lived inch of tan foam. nose is lager yeast and sweeter amber malts, i dont get much bitter roasted barley on this at all. there is a little more in the flavor, but this is still an extremely light beer for a dark lager. that and the low abv make it drinkable enough, but it finishes a bit sweet and a bit metallic, a real tun off. passable but not special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and metallic aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and char flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the metallic aroma I am getting is not too pleasant."
""
""
""

"Overall a middle of the road schwarzbier with an ample dose of chocolate malts. Works well at the price point."
"Shiner Bohemian Black Lager ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and goes down easily but seems to be too thin and a bit watery. It's not a bad choice if you are looking for something you can drink a lot of but has some roasty flavors."
"Overall - I enjoyed this style of beer."

"O: This beer gave me enough flavor to enjoy but not enough where I can't share it with friends who are not into the robust flavors of craft beers. Is it the best example of a black lager? No. Is it a nice change and a better choice than a BMC? Hell yes. I enjoyed drinking this. Even though it lacked the flavors that are found in better beers, it wasn't bad. Would have again."

"O: Not bad at all. It's quite good, actually, especially for the style. It's rich, subtle character almost belies its 4.9% ABV. Out of the mixed 6-pack from Shiner (other brewers, take note), this is probably the only one I'd buy a 6-pack of in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm looking forward to tasting this beer again as I work through the case, and I will certainly buy it again someday. Recommended."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours a light black with a small brown head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of dark roasted grain, maybe a touch of coffee, but with sweet sugar. Tastes of dark roasted grain, slight caramel or chocolate taste. Beer is slightly under carbonated, but still goes down for its light body. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
"Shiner Bohemian Black Lager pours a reddish brown with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit grainy and a bit malty. The flavor is mild, mostly malty and kind of a one note type thing, being that there doesn't seem to be any complexity to the flavor. Pleasant enough, but there are better examples of they style out there."
"Dark malts, some dusty dark chocolate and some cola and thats about it. On the thin and watery side. Nothing special going on here as seems to be the case with all the shiner brews. Almost craft beer. One and done.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Having reviewed the other 5 varieties that came in the Shiner variety pack I bought last year, and coming up with several scores in the low 3's, I wasn't expecting much. Turns out I saved the best for last, as this beer turns out to a gorgeous, solidly tasting brew. It is by no means complex, but the chocolate notes and hops are dolled out in the right proportions and the mouthfeel is pretty creamy. I don't know if the year of cellering helped, but I would gladly buy a six of this to find out."
""
""
"The beer doesn't taste bad but really not much of a schwarzbier. An introduction to what roasted malt tastes like."
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty, brown bread, roasted, caramel sweetness, some coffee. Hop bitterness is mild. Finish is crisp and semi-dry. Body is light-medium, silky, crisp."
"Overall - not worth your time or money, you could do much better for the same style beer at the same price. this is at least drinkable though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good and very drinkable black lager, not too complex, but decent."
"Watery, too sugary and not enough bite, from hops and roast both. But hey, it's Shiner, so this is made for easy sunshine drinking. A great gateway lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- Not a Munich Dunkel by any means, but a smooth beer with roasted character. This is a great textbook of style in the Schwarzbier category -- whether German or Bohemian. Big flavor at 4.9% Spoetzl surprises yet again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok I'm Sorry but this is be best black lager I have ever drank in the U.S. I have been to 21 countries and have tasted a lot of beer. But without a doubt this beer is smooth and satisfying; it taste just like a few beers in Ireland I had!!! I live in Madison, Alabama and we can not buy it around here, I have to drive north for about two hours to get it and its worth the trip!!! I wish I could find it closer!! I guess why I like it do much is because it reminds me of a true taste outside the U.S."
""
"O- Decent for a Shiner product but I've definitely had better schwarzbiers."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark chestnut brown with a thin light brown head that dissipates to a thick ring around the glass and light lacing. Aroma of toasted and light bready malt, hint of chocolate. Flavor is attenuated toasted malt with hints of coffee and grassy hops. Light bodied. I got hopeful as I poured this, because it looks pretty good, but this is really light flavored, almost tastes watered down. Too bad because the basic components seem nice."
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a beige colored head. The aroma has some sweet malts to it, but that’s about it. The taste is simple and perhaps weaker than expected. There is a taste of chocolate and roasted malts but it is weak. Overall this is a very sweet, easy drinking taste that is smooth refreshing. Could use a little more boldness, but that’s just me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Objective as I can get. I drink lighter lager for fun but dark is a treat. If it's as low as 4.99 go for it. If 5.99 or more, no."
"One of my favs as far as the Shiner lineup is concerned."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've only had two schwarzbier, and this is my least favorite of the two."
""
""
""
"This is a very good, and easy drinking beer. Got as part of the family pack. I need to find a store that sells it in it's own packaging, because I want more."
"O- Was better then I thought it would be. Would buy again if I saw a six pack by itself and not part of the SHINER family reunion variety pack. Didn't care for half the beers in there."
"Poured black with little head. Mild aroma, flavor is all upfront with some black patent malt flavor that eased in the middle to no aftertaste on the end. Mildly interesting for a near craft beer. Inoffensive and easy to drink. Not sure I would want more then one but would be a good choice if only BMC was available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a pretty decent beer. While spoetzl hasn't produced any world class beers that I've tried, their beers aren't bad, and aren't too expensive. Plus it's locally produced here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thin, with very little body. Was expecting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I tried this again because I loved it when I first got into craft.... I don't anymore. Its ok, don't get me wrong, and I could drink it all day long if it were the only thing available. But now as a fan of bigger beers, this just doesn't cut it anymore. Everything is just too light. On a more positive note, I still think its one of the best looking bottles in the business."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This just seems to be barely more interesting than any flabby lager. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Pinkie's in San Angelo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I've only had a few Schwarzbiers, but I definitely like them. This one is no exception."
""
""
"Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Beautiful black color poured out of a very bottle. Perfect for the beer drinker who wants to endugle in a black lager with a nice amount of malt with no bitter aftertaste. A little thin and the aroma could be a bit richer."
""
""
""
"This is a style I really like though I'm not a big lager drinker. Sadly, the execution here is less than stellar. Medium-light body, light carbonation. Nothing special here."
""
""
""
"Overall – Like most Shiners it is rather easy to drink and makes a decent session, but it is really nothing to pine for."
""
""
"3.53/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a black lager with a good taste (that ends pretty abruptly). This is a ""nice enough to enjoy"" lager with nice ""black"" notes."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: A bit on the thin side compared to the rest of most black lagers but a good beer none the less."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-light bodied with crisp carbonation and a clean overall feel. Drinks light and easy, not exactly a super refresher, but remains pretty quaffable. One of the better bottles in the Shiner “Family Reunion” mixed six."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another session beer with flavor. More of a simple toasted beer than a roasted/toasted complex beer. It's one of Shiner's only decent beers but a black lager from almost anywhere else will probably be just as good or better."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Drinkable but too carbonated. Flavor is simple and not at all memorable. Too bland for my tastes."
"Poured a very dark brown with red tinges. Nice malt smell with toffee undertones. Malty-sweet taste with a greasy finish. Very light hoppiness that you have to be looking for to find. Overall a nice lager from Shiner. No boozy taste, but a nice buzz."
""
""
""
""
"D: A very approachable & quite toasty dark beer. An excellent option at a price point hardly above macro swill."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a decent beer; one of the best I've had from this brewer, although that's faint praise. Improves with some warming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- This is decent enough, probably one of my preferred Shiner offerings. Far from anything special however."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It is very drinkable with a quick finish. In many ways I find the Shiner lineup to be the same. All I've tried are light, drinkable, and quick finishing. Great for warm Texas weather. So, disregard the numbers I assign because it is all about reference points."

"Pours a very dark brown to black with a light brown head that dissipates. There's a faint aroma of roasted malt and not much else. It's not very strong. There's good flavor from the roasted malts and there's a taste of coffee. There is some lacing left on the glass. The carbonation makes this beer light on the mouthfeel. Overall, I feel this beer is definitely a solid and very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, I must admit I did not expect much from this beer as cheap darker beers are usually unworthy, but this brew poured a toasted amber color, with the right amount of frothy head and lace. The aroma was of sweet, aged oak, and an earthy malt scent. The flavor was smooth with a slight tinge to the palette. A worthy beer indeed."
""
""
""
"Poured this Schwarzbier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a brownish black color, produced a creamy thick tannish head. Left an ample amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted barely- rather weak. The beer was light in body, a base of toasted malt and a slight hint of coffee. Overall disappointed- thin, watery, and not much character. On to the next. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's ok. The smoke is ok but I would imagine it would become tiresome after about 3 bottles."
"O: This is one of the few from Shiner that actually has a very decent taste. It has great flavors, but the mouthfeel is just terrible and almost ruins the beer for me. I just don't get how it's so hard for them to make a beer that goes down easy...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really like it. It is a bit undercarbonated for a black lager, it tastes a bit like a watered-down stout which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's delicious and I like it better than most. a Solid B+."
""
""
"Overall - looks and smells weak but taste matters most and this beer tastes pretty darn good for a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an ok brew from shiner but is pretty lackluster. There are better examples of this style out there."
""
"I'll be avoiding this one in the future, I might as well have had a glass of coffee carafe rinsewater for the same effect."
"OVERALL GRADE: D"
""
""
""
""
"This beer is pretty straight forward. A mild bittersweetness upfront and a roasted smokey finish. It's definitely not the best black lager or beer that Spoetzl makes, but it's not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours out like a cola, dark some what see thru body with a big bubbly head that settles real quick. leaves some lacing. smell consists of grains and a slight roasted scent. taste is a little more exciting. roasted malts come thru leaving a weak coffee flavor in the background. mouthfeel is real thin and watery. lots of carbonation. overall this was a decent attempt at the style but could use bolder flavors to grab your attention."

"From my brother, Duane. Thanks, buddy. I really wanted to like this beer. I like the idea of an older non-AB brewery in Shiner Texas. But I was disappointed. The beer does not have a good aroma. A little like maraschino cherries, perhaps. There was a very small head with no retention of lacing at all. The taste had a burnt tone but primarily it tasted like cardboard. Texture was very watery with almost no carbonation. It was not pleasant. Cold or warm it was not good, Perhaps it was old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad take on the style, taste hints at the right notes, but the smell on this is not quite jiving with me. There is much better Schwarzbier out there for sure than this."
"Overall: A conflicting experience--the beer is an easy drinker but leaves an unimpressive profile; presents well, but can best be filed under mediocre..."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with beige, creamy, short-lived head. Aroma is of grassy hops and toasted, nutty malt. Medium, smooth body. Toasted nutty malt and roasted grain balanced on the palate by grassy hops, some hints of caramel. This is a nice brew for Shiner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was hoping for more dark notes and some complexity but really it is mostly just a fizzy dark beer which isn't the worse but doesn't have much to recommend it."
"Notes: Shiner continues to impress me when dealing with their catalog outside of the flagship bock."
"I let this warm a bit out of the fridge before trying. Poured with an average sized tan head that quickly subsided to a few islands, a ring, and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear, dark cherry red. Aroma is fairly mild and is of roast, malt, fruit, toffee, caramel. Flavor is similar to nose with carbonic tang standing out along with some roast malt and a little cocoa. Body is thin and carbonation is fizzy. Finish is like flavor and has some length."
"10/21/11 Update:Big head. Milk chocolate aroma. Tastes of roasted coffee/chocolate with sudden sharp grassy/cheap beer flavor. The roasted-ness is all gone. So, not much change, just a much nicer initial aroma."
"Overall Shiner produces something slightly different. A Bohemian take on a dark beer seems to be an appropriate label for this beer. It's worth a try, but I'm not sure it's worth another with other so many other great schwarzbiers available."
"I was really surprised at how good this beer was. I figured I'd come a long way in my taste for beer since the early days of drinking this stuff all the time, but this is really a damn good beer for the money. The sweet dried fruit flavours are perfectly balanced by the bitter roasted malt character and just enough hops. The light body is a nice touch too. I'm not sure what I think about the level of carbonation. Seems like it might be a bit high, but it doesn't really bother me. This is an excellent brew that I will be sure to buy again. I guess my first instincts as a beer drinker were right. This really is one of the best beers in its price range."
"Overall: Seems to make the Sam Adams mistake of dumbing-down a style so that everybody likes it. Have some balls! I want to taste some complexity in my Schwarzbiers! Not just a pils+brown dye."
"Personally, I'd prefer a little more dryness in the finish, and maybe tone down the sweetness a bit. But overall, a very nice Schwarzbier."
"This beer was givent to me by a co-worker who did a trade with someone from Texas. I poured it out into a Sam Adams pint glass. The color was very dark brown with a light tan color head on top. The head had a good retentions which was impressive to me. The smell of the beer gives of a pretty typical roasted aroma with some lager yeast aromas. The taste is a little chocolaty and with the lager bitterness in the aftettaste. The flavors are better as the beer warms up a little. The mouthfeel is a little creamy, no bite to this one at all. Overall I found it to be a pretty nice Black Lager."
"Overall- This is not a bad schwarbier but it definitely is not the best. If I were to want to drink more of this style I would choose another brand."
"O-Night the greatest beer but very drinkable. The fairly low ABV allows the enjoyment of several of these. It's not the best but its certainly better than a Bud Light"
"O - this is actually my second time tasting this beer. The first time was in the midst of an all afternoon/evening/night session, and it did not agree with me at all. I was actually apprehensive to give the second bottle a try but I'm pleased that I did. I enjoy the darker flavors combined with the lighter mouthfeel - an easy way to get the complex qualities without the heaviness that I find in some bigger beers that I enjoy."
"O: Overall a pretty decent brew. This isn't going to shatter any one's world but it is a solid example of the style."
"Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes to drink a beer that is lighter on the palate, but still wants flavor that the macros don't have. Definitely an interesting flavor, but very easy to drink."
"o: im actually shocked on this one.. i expected less, but it ended up being pretty decent."
"Overall Impression- I was looking for more body and more strength with this brew. Very easy to drink and some would say a good ""starter"" beer for the beginning of the night or a session. Enjoyed the roasted malts and lager tastes but very watered down at times."
"This is another fantastic offering from Spoetzl. This is a very complex – yet drinkable Schwartzbier that just screams quality."
"O- At one point early in my beer education this was one of my favorite beers (as I am from Texas). At this point, it is still enjoyable, but not nearly one of my favorites"
"Overall, it's not a bad offering, and apparently one of the more popular offerings from Shiner? I suppose, for many Texans, this reminds them of Shiner Bock? I don't see how, but it's definitely one of the more interesting beers the brewery has to offer."
"Poured into what else, my Shiner pint shaker glass. Beer pours a nice inch and a half of head that quickly and almost completely dissipates into a very thin layer. From arm’s length the beer appears black, although its more of a dark auburn/reddish brown. I’m picking up on a very muted roasty aroma here, while detecting notes of a sweet maltiness. Heavy carbonation makes this beer appear lighter to the taste than I’d expect, given the sweet/malt notes. However, that doesn’t improve the taste. It’s sweet, a little too sweet, almost sickingly so. I don’t remember it tasting so unpleasant, as this was one of my go-to beers during Shiner specials. Could be I liked it more a year ago and my tastes have radically changed, or my options in Tejas expanded to where I no longer drink it and forgot just how it tasted? Either way, as a schwarzbier] it misses more than hits. Can’t say I expected all that much but I’m writing this one off as a letdown."
"Overall, it's a fairly well-balanced and rounded dark lager that's okay but not memorable or revisitiable by any means."
"O- Really good I've been meaning to try this for quite awhile, it's something I will probably have more often."
"Overall--and especially for those just being introduced to heavier and darker beers--this is a nice, solid offering."
"Overall – A pretty damn quaffable beer. Better than I was expecting. Would grab with a meal at a restaurant."
"Pretty thin and watery. I like the roasted malt, but not the burnt flavor that sneaks through. I also am not a fan of how much lager yeast is noticeable over the malts. Not awful, but not great."
"Overall: Of Shiner’s offerings this is probably their better ones, but even it is not that spectacular. It's just mehh"
"A nice beer and not as heavy as it looks."
"O: I think Shiner has provided a great example of a schwarzbier, an interesting brew that I would def. have again."
"Very dark jet black liquid with a tan head about a quarter of an inch thick. Some lacing, but nothing noteworthy. Smell was roasty very similar to freshly grind coffee beans. Some sugar and sweetness in the taste, but a nice bitter backbone. Nice thick and oily mouthfeel. Very carbonated. Best from Shiner thus far, but still nothing over the top."
"Pours mostly opaque black with thin off-white to tan head. Subtle grainy malt aroma, a touch of roasted coffee. Toasted flavor, bready with some coffee and roast malt. Barely a hint of floral hops. Decent, smooth mouthfeel. Definitely a balanced beer with good drinkability."
"O - Overall an easy dark beer to drink, not a premier beer but with a try especially if you like dark flavors but can't commit to the deep cuts of heavy beer."
"Came in a Shiner family pack; all in all it was decent. Not one that I would ever go out of my way to pick up, but not an UNenjoyable experience."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Color is mostly black with a bit of ruby shining through when held up to the light. Thin head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing behind. Aroma is coffee some darkly toasted grain and a bit of something sweet on the end, I know this sounds bizarre but I almost got a faint hint of grape soda. Mouthfeel is a bit thin on this beer and I think it's biggest downfall is it's carbonation. The bubbles are very large, like coca cola or club soda. Not something I am looking for in a beer. Oh well, better finish drinking it before it goes flat..."
"Poured a nice, dark, cola brown with a wispy eggshell head that receded to a patchy layer. Dark roasty malts in the aroma with notes of coffee and sugar. More roasted malts in the taste, toffee, semisweet chocolate, and a coffee bitterness. Practically no hops detectable. Not as smooth as some schwarzbiers I've had, but I still liked it a lot. Medium-bodied, dry finish, and quite drinkable."
"Summary - Shiner Black is one of my favorite ""any day"" beers. It is drinkable in any season, with many meals, as well as fairly enjoyable on its own. There is nothing particularly special about Black, with mouthfeel being the least spectacular, but as a casual beer I have enjoyed it."
"Smells is smooth, rich with malts and coffee and toffee flavors. Taste is much like the smell. A tad bitter on the end."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer appears black in the glass but when held to the light it is really more of a very deep crimson red; a light head that quickly breaks up to just a thin ring with continuous carbonation rising to keep the ring in tact. The nose is mainly malty sweet with just hints of more darkly roasted malts which give a slight burnt note. Taste is very similar with the sweeter notes coming through early and the slight astringent, burnt bitterness rounding out the taste. The mouthfeel is rather light in body with a fairly aggressive yet thin carbonation. Overall a decent tasting brew but not one I could drink a lot of in one sitting due to the mouth drying bitterness."
"Clean roasty nose with a light dusting of cocoa. A crisp drinker with very light chocolate sweetness and a bit of lingering raisin. It's mainly dry, grainy, roasty and quite quaffable. Nice dry finish. A simple, but enjoyable beer that goes down with ease."
"O: It could be better if it was a little thinner and had less carbonation, but the roasted flavor, malty character and bitterness of the hops is there."
"Enjoyable beer overall, not the greatest by any means but still quite good. Shiner, once again, the best value for money in its class."
"not a bad representation of the style"
"Overall-Another Spoetzl beer another just generic tasting beer, nothing crazy here. Next beer please."
"Overall: Pretty good. One of the better brews from Spoetzl."
"Overall a pretty generic schwarzbier. Probably the best Shiner I've had - which unfortunately isn't saying too much."
"Not a profound example of the style, but all the elements actually come together pretty well when you're in the mood for an easy-drinking beer with some extra character."
"The overall on this beer is a good one I think. The price point rocks and they have cool promos like the Shiner Family Sixer that this was in."
"I truly hate ripping beers. I know the time and effort and passion that go into making most (though not all) craft beers. But I can't summon up the energy to defend this one. The best I can say about Shiner Bohemian Black Lager is that it has a gently pleasing aroma. If you're purchasing this as an air freshener, great. But if you're looking for a tasty and satisfying beer, I suggest you go somewhere else. Not recommended."
"It has typical schwarzbier character. Roasty. Not as malty as some. Not very hoppy. It's about right. And we need to encourage the Shiner people to fix their usually boring brews."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, slightly roasty. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, nutty, roasty. Medium Body, the finish is slightly bitter/dry. A pretty tasty brew."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, I picked this up from Central Market in Fort Worth while we were staying with a friend. The beer pours jet black, with a light, bubbled, tan head starting at two inches and settling into a thin ring of head. Effervescent nose, with slight floral aromas. The taste is rather bland, with a slight sour tone and some smokey characteristics. Very light and crisp bodied, with a clean finish and minimal aftertaste. There is a semi-sweet and slightly sharp finish. Inconsistent beer, if that makes any kind of sense."
"Pours dark brown, nearing black with some garnet highlights and a fairly thin head. Quite light in the nose, with some washed out notes of lager yeast and the barest hint of roastiness. The taste is similar, very light, and even somewhat seltzery, but the roastiness is slightly more pronounced and there is a light cocoa bitterness. Fairly pleasant. Light in the mouth, but this is an offering with more character than the usual swill that is acceptable among non-craft drinkers in the South."
"O: This is a good winter beer. It tastes a little cheap/watery, so I’m not quite sure I’ll ever make it a session beer. For someone who is new to craft beers, this might be a nice way to expand his/her palate."
"Part of the Shiner variety pack. A rare style, but one of my personal favorites. Pours a nice dark red, almost black. Off-white head to it. Smell is nice and roasty. Taste is medium bodied, great mouthfeel and nice balance going down. Finishes clean and smooth with a bit of spiciness. Pretty impressed by this one, compared to others of this style it's definitely better than average. A nice drinker, this Shiner mixed pack is starting to look like a solid mix!"
"O: I thought this to be a pretty good beer to drink. The combination of lightness with characteristics of a dark brew seem to make this one something to enjoy in the heat of the summer."
"Overall this a pretty standard dark lager. I enjoyed the variety of shiner and will have more reviews to come for the others"
"Poured thin black. Smelled like a beer, huh. Flavor was like a beer too, sarcasm aside a nicer drink with some malt notes and a hint of roast. Carbon copy mouthfeel, not unpleasant. Overall a decent swing at the classic, but too much like a light lager to squarely hit the mark. Shiner is awesome, they can improve this."
"I like a good dark beer and this has some of the flavor but by the end of it I was not tasting much. I like something that keeps it taste till the end of the bottle/glass. For as dark as it looks, I did expect more on the nose and taste."
"O: I'd pass unless you are looking for something that goes down easy. What you see is what you get with this one."
"Overall: A decent beer if you want to go the malty and chocolatey route on a budget. It's got a nice color but it's lacking complexity."
"O: Overall this was somewhat unbalanced, The blending between the hops and malts gave it an off flavor something just didn't balance it out, it wasn't terrible and I've had a lot worse."
"Flavor is equally as roasty/chocolatey sweet. No complexity at all, much like all the Shiners I've had."
"I drink this with all sorts of grilled meats...especially boneless beef ribs."
"D - It gets better as it warms, but not much depth to this beer. Didn't get much off it besides some faint hops in the aftertaste. Smooth, easy to drink, but not a lot going on."
"D: A good brew overall, but falls short of the artistic expressions offered by the German brewers. Despite all of this, it is a fantastic brew and should be enjoyed,"
"The mouthfeel is very carbonated! It almost makes the beer go down like carbonated water at first. The body is somewhere around medium-light. The drinkability is very good, this is a highly drinkable lager. Another solid beer from Spoetzl, I'm having much better luck with their side-line beers than I did with their abysmal Bock flagship."
"Notes: Not my favorite schwarzbier as the nose and flavor is just to light, faint, and doesn't have that rich flavor. Just kind of an earthy slightly burnt malt flavor. Sure you it went down easy, but there are much better schwarzbiers and beers that I would want instead of this."
"Well color me surprised. I don't know why, but I didn't expect much from this beer, & it's good, especially considering the low ABV; so few brewers can make a tasty low ABV beer, & this is nothing if not flavorful. Lots packed into this package."
"The nose is very grainy and rustic with raw wheat, roast, a little coffee and a mild sweetness that has some caramel and sugar. There's also a mild metallic character up front, but that fades. Hop character is faint and rather unnoticeable. Very clean, there's no off-flavors from the yeast here. The palate opens roasts with a mild grainy acidity that brings to mind watery coffee grounds. While that doesn't sound very appealing, in a schwarzbier, it is. Sweetness is low, tempered by the mild bitterness that's imparted by the grain. I get a little bit of cola, a faint caramel note and not much else. Simpler than the best of the style, this finishes a touch watery and with a blend of mild bitterness, mild acidity and a little coffee. Light in body with high carbonation, this is decent."
"D - I believe this maybe the best Shiner beer I ever had. Session able ABV, nice body full of flavor but roasty factor is a bit aggressive. The most affordable Swartz I found to date at 9.99 a sixer, try it if you haven't!"
"Not bad for being from a brewery that I am accustomed to being disappointed by. This one is not bad. Wish Shiner would make every beer like this one."
"I suppose it is drinkable enough, but more than anything else, it is simply not a very memorable beer. If offered one I'd drink it, but like the other Shiner beers I've recently tried, I don't know that I'd search this beer out."
"Dark brown color, with no head at all. Smell is non existent at all. Little flavor to speak of, just booze. Mouthfeel is lite and watery and not too much to speak of. Drinkability is a 3/5 not too good."
"Drink is pretty good, dry crisp finish, smooth and light abv, very sessionable, bit of stickiness."
"So-so, looks dark and heavy but the taste isn't very strong. I think it's characteristic of the style but it comes across as a good presentation of just an okay beer."
"An average beer, but good for shiner."
"Pours a very dark brown-ruby colored body which would appear as black in low lighting with a tan-brown 1.5inch head which dwindles down to a thin layer of foam. Smells of smokey dark chocolate and a toffee-like sweetness. Tastes of dark chocolate, subtle hints of coffee and smoke, then a hoppy kick. Unfortunately the beer finishes with a carbonated-water like taste and feel which really kind of ends up making the beer feel thin. Overall, this is a good beer, but that strange CO2 water feel at the end has to knock back the score."
"This tastes alot like an american lager with roasted malts, if i were going for a black beer, i would much prefer Monchshof Schwartz. Also, i don't know why I am tasting metal, its a bit off puting, but may be a bad bottle. I would probably not buy this again, but at the same time, wouldn't turn down a free one. :D"
"D: If you are after a ""sort-of-has-some-taste"" beer, there is nothing here to keep you from drinking this."
"Not much for smell and taste, average brew, good for Spoetzl, pretty poor example of one of my favorite styles. Nothing I would seek out again, but I don't mind finishing the single bottle I bought."
"D - This is a decent beer, but it is lacking in comparison to classic examples of this style. The roast character is a bit subdued with sweet caramel dominating the beer in a way that almost makes it seem more like a bock than a black schwarzbier. The sweet finish only serves to intensify this impression. Drinkable, but not something I would buy again."
"a much better offering than the Shiner Bock"
"D - Easy to drink, but lacking in flavor."
"This is a forgettable schwarzbier. Very watery and not that exciting."
"D- Slightly too bitter. Deep, dark flavors but watery and bland."
"in the face. This beer is balanced. Spoetzl....don't change a thing."
"Overall, I like the smoke flavors. Good for a lager, but way too much carbonation really throwing this beer off. Somewhat drinkable."
"Better than I expected. It was nice and dry but a little on the watery side."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. The lower ABV makes this a drinker all night without worrying about getting to well...drunk. A nice beer that I personally was surprised with."
"Ah, inexpensive bottles for my mixed-sixer. Love it. This one pours a lovely translucent garnet-brown topped by nearly a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, light coffee, cocoa powder, and a twinge o' flowers. The taste holds notes of cocoa, light roasted malts, thick and toasted caramel, and a swig o' roasty toffee. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a somewhat surprisingly nice schwarz, nothing too exciting but pretty tasty and highly drinkable nonetheless."
"I really like the specialty beers that Shiner makes even though I'm not a big fan of the original Shiner Bock. I'm also accustomed to black lagers. Shiner Black is one of my favorites. I find myself drawn to it whenever I see that it is available. This was the first I had it out of a bottle. The appearance was tan to a black color. The smell of hops was strong. When tasting it you can taste a burnt flavor which is appetizing. It's easy to drink but be careful because more than a few will get you leaning. Strong but pleasant. I highly recommend this brew. For sure."
"Pours a deep brown with a light head and not much retention or lacing. Nose is crisp roasted malt with some light caramel and chocolate. Taste is roast with coffee and chocolate and some light earthy hops. Fairly light win good carbonation. Just like others I have had from them, this drinks well but doesn't pack much flavor."
"I really liked this beer. It has a very roasted malt start and a really nice smooth smokey finish. I poured this into a pilsner glass and got a good 1 inch almond colored thick head. I could easily drink multiple bottles of this ""American Schwartzbier"""
"Pours a dark black with a nice head, head recedes quickly leaving minimal lacing. Smells average, nothing great but not bad, a bit weak. Taste is not what I was expecting. Not much there, was expecting more of a stout feel and this is not it. Mouthfeel was very watery. Had the feel of a cheap lager not a richer dark beer. Drinkability average, not a bad beer, but not what I wanted/expected and not something I would seek out again. Wouldn't turn down another but wouldn't pay for it either."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/10/14/tasting-the-shiner-bohemian-black-lager/"
"Drinkability: I have no trouble putting a 6 pack down just sitting with my girlfriend watching a movie and playing some cards. Shiner Bohemian Black is a great drink that isn't to thick to sit heavy on your stomach and it's not so thin you're needing to run to the bathroom every 15 minutes. I love this beer for social events."
"Overall a decent beer."
"D- One hell of a Schwarzbier that I would love to get alot of. Has beautiful drinkablity and a flavor that only makes you want more... cheers!"
"Notes: This is a solid example of the style. It's dark and tasty yet supper easy to drink."
"I have had this beer numerous times over the years and it has always been my favorite Shiner beer. I never remembered the smoke in the beer before, so I am not sure if I always just missed it or if this batch was smokier than others in the past."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Has a slight chewiness to it. Overall a pretty decent Schwarzbier. I wouldn't mind if the roast was kicked up a tad bit, or maybe an element of dark chocolate....just something to add a little more complexity. Very drinkable, and would certainly have again."
"http://1yob.com/post/974359083/shinerblack"
"Decent brew. Spoetzl kind of confuses me. Are they going for utmost quality or do they just sort of wing. Some of their stuff reminds me of Saranac when it comes to quality."
"Would like to enjoy this on tap"
"D: Something perhaps to best be enjoyed with a simply seasoned cut of beef."
"D: Very drinkable, something I won't be afraid to recommend or add to my personal rotation."
"drinkability: for a darker bock-style, the toasted flavor is neither too intense nor too smoke-infused, the discernable presence of hops makes give it some mild complexity; definitely worth trying."
"This is an overall spectacular brew. I rank it amongst my favorites. It is the lightest of the beers I regularly drink. I tend to lean towards Stone Double Bastard and Dogfish Head 90 Minute IIPA. When I want something refreshing and easy to drink, this is my beer of choice."
"Not much to this one. It was even kind of a chore to drink as all the flavors are quite muted. Nothing I would be looking for again but hey, it was cheap."
"Overall it was not a bad black lager. This is one of my more favorite brews from the Spoetzl Brewery. I would not mind having this one again and would easily choose it over the Bock. I thought it had a refreshing quality that seemed fitting for the TX heat."
"Definetely a session black lager, although black lagers are sessionable to begin with. So maybe a good six pack available session lager."
"M- A little too much on the carbonation perhaps. The body is fairly light and the finish is pretty clean."
"Poured into a pint glass this has an aggressive head that was 3 fingers thick milk chocolate brown that left minimal lacing but settled to a nice 1 finger cap. The aroma is faint but some burnt caramel and coffee are present. The taste is of mild chocolate, some slight coffee and a little burnt caramel. Light carbonation and medium body. Not the best dark lager I have had but a decent brew."
"A nice drinker...nothing terribly complex but also nothing terribly wrong with this either....I'd recommend.."
"Now, what distinguishes the ""bohemian black lager"" from Shiner Bock? Not a lot actually. Basically, the flavor is smoothed out quite a bit, traces of caramel and chocolaty malts, now complete with less bitter aftertaste. This beer is certainly more likable than Shiner proper, but the new flavor profile isn't strong enough to overcome my affinity for the original."
"I had this beer right after the Session Black from Full Sail and I have to say that this is not as good. Both beers are well priced and dark lagers but the Full Sail has a richer mouthfeel and longer finish. I think this is an ok beer and if I was in Texas I would probably seek it out but in the PNW the Session Black is the better beer at a better price"
"D: not bad, I just wish it were more of what it's trying to be."
"Drinkability - very good beer, but still a little too thick for me to go back for a few more times. I wouldn't mind at all having it in the fridge for one every now and then."
"I used to love this beer but it just doesn't do it for me anymore."
"D - Very easy to drink! Not too strong, but definitely not weak. Tastes like a smoked porter but drinks much easier. Very nice!"
"Notes: Overall quite refreshing and light. I think it makes a great alternative to heavier stouts/porters and I like it much better than say something like a light lager. It maintains some complexity and depth of flavor while still being quite drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinkability is high due to the weaker flavors and light feel. Its descent for a black lager but I would definetly appreciate a more complex flavor profile and more substantial body."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"D: Overall not a bad little brew, low ABV and nice flavors. Nothing too outstanding but a nice brew from the Spoetzl Brewery."
"Dark brown, maybe some black in center, clear, and ruby edges with a two finger head and light lacing. Aroma is slightly subdued, but there is a touch of roasty and chocolate notes going on, a but grainy (Shiner's MO?) and no hoppiness. Taste is right along with the aroma. Lightl cocoa, some caramel, and a teeny tiny bit of roast make up the flavor profile, some grainy, bready like base malts underneath, and a fading light bitterness along with a nutty sweetness on the finish. Not too sweet, and easy drinking. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation, just on the verge of creamy. Not a bad a beer by any means. Probably the best out of this mixed 12 pack so far."
"D: Pretty tame for the style. Nothing wrong, just not very impressive."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer from Shiner. I'd buy this over Shiner Bock any day."
"i love the aesthetic but this beer was a bit of a dissapointment"
"drinkability is high. this goes down easy and is a great session beer for people who want a lighter beer with richer flavor than a typical lager."
"D - Alright, but certainly nothing special. However, it is drinkable and refreshing enough that it makes a solid session beer or something to have on a hot afternoon."
"Very dark with a slight red hue when held to the light. Decent head that stuck around for a bit, but not not as long as it should. not much to smell. Tastes of coffee, roasted malts, a little nutty and a hit of cocoa. Its a little thin and light for a black, but it has a little more complexity than most shiner offerings (which we have plenty of around here). Really quite drinkable."
"its a drinkable beer, not phenomenal"
"D - Drinkability is nice. Beer tastes fairly good and goes down pretty quickly. I could see myself putting down a sixer in a night if that was what I desired."
"thick and heavy.'"
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a 1"" dark tan head above the clear burgundy brew. Head fades ever so slowly, with good lacing. Aroma is wisps of rich dark malt, but not enough. Taste is moderate dark sweetness, balancing bitterness, and a creamy close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Good stuff."
"The pour created two fingers' worth of light-brown/deep-tan head that quickly fell like Wile E. Coyote going over a cliff while holding an Acme Co. anvil. The label read: ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" and while I am not a shrinking violet, this beer might be scary to the uninitiated. They may have called it ""Black"" but it was really a deep, dark brown with beautiful ruby highlights. The nose was chocolaty with dried dark fruit, like raisins. I thought of a Cadbury Fruit & Nut bar, initially. Wow! Mouthfeel was a bit thin with only the CO2 giving it any real body. Nuts! Still, the taste was very pleasant - slightly chocolaty, slightly smoky, just right after a long workday. The finish was again chocolate with a light smokiness. The ABV made it a welcome addition to my day and I would definitely have it more often."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and chocolate, some notes of coffee. Taste is like the smell, malty and coffee, some hints of chocolate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Update: It sort of grows on you, and as it warms, it really gets better. There's more flavor as it gets warmer. Less bitterness, and smoke, and more malt and hops. It's getting to be an interesting beer. My advice is let it warm for a few minutes before you start on this one. It helps a lot."
"D - This beer wasn't bad...it struck me as odd to have two distinct flavors and not a real middle ground here...I would suggest letting this one warm up a little before taking that first sip"
"yawn. only one more Shiner sample left."
"Saw this at the liquor store and found myself in the mood for a dark lager. Unfortunately, this is nothing like any of the other German dark lagers I have tried. It looked promising on the pour, and the smell was malty and slightly sweet. Unfortunately, the overwhelming flavor is blandness. Easy to drink, but very mediocre. I also found the Shiner Bock to be pretty underwhelming too, so I guess this brand just isn't to my taste. It's not bad, but there's really nothing I can reccomend about it either."
"Score: 1.65"
"drinkability - this beer is a step up from marcos but it doesnt make me what to crack open another"
"D Not a summer night lawnmower beer obviously, but it would be easy to put six of these away"
"Not distinguished in any way and has a muddled character. Pass if you want a good craft beer. Woe is me Shiner."
"D: Somewhat tasty, not very filling, goes down relatively easily. Nothing completely stands out, but there are better offerings of this style."
"RJT"
"Shiner's always been a good basic brew for a go to when nothing else is available and you don't want your taste buds to suffer. This is a classic beer they drink in Germany, let's give it a whirl. Smells not much different than a macro lager could be a golden lager as far as the nose goes. Pours to a very dark, darker than root beer, color letting just a little light through. Head is micro bubble and creamy. Taste is thinner than I expected, again not much different than an American golden lager, but with the difference being a hint of black licorice. Finish is kind of funky with a bit of mouthpuckering skunkiness. As an afiicionado of darker brews I was pumped for this one, but it is a let down. Won't be drinking anymore of this brew."
"Drinkability was average and didn't impress any. I love beer and I hate wasting money so I will certainly drink it all, but it's nothing better than average."
"Drinkable about like water, I think I'd rather have water."
"Mouthfeel is thin with low carbonation. Inoffensive."
"Served lightly-chilled in a wide-mouthed goblet."
"D - not bad. nothing outstanding, but could work for a session brew."
"D: This is shiners most complex and flavorful beer very good with central Texas BBQ. It has a wonderful dark malt character but is easy to drink."
"Poured a light black (if possible) body with minimal head and a little lacing. Some roasted and sweet malt smells are very minor and not much hops at all. Light bodied with little sweet or roasted malt presence and very little hops but has a little bit of dry crispness in the backend. Goes down easy and is a very simple, rather not much taste at all, but still easy to drink beer and I'm glad I tried it."
"D - Not a bad effort but it lacks some oomph. The carbonation is definitely too high, the flavor too low, but the drinkability is almost there. I could have a few while watching a game, but I'd never look for it again."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 1 inch thin tannish head that leaves a little lacing. The appearance is black with deep mahogany around the edges. The aroma is mainly of roasted malts. I don't pick up any hops at all. The taste is malty with slight hop taste and no bitterness. The feel is surprisingly thin bodied for such a dark beer, but I see that's typical of the style. Moderate carbonation. Very drinkable, this would be a good session beer."
"Poured jet black from a mixed six bottle into my favorite pint. Dark dark dark with a thin tan head and minimal lacing. Smell and taste was roasty toasty. This was drinkable but I don't seem to prefer the roasty beers. No doubt it was good for the style but not my cup of tea."
"D: Pretty solid beer, I haven't had a lot for the style but this is one of the better ones I've ahd."
"drinkability: it is cheap and everywhere, but i wouldnt recommend it."
"The mouthfeel is pretty light, but that's typical for the style and this one refrains from getting too thin. Carbonation's a little high, though."
"I can't believe that a dark beer is this simple and drinkable. Not over carbonated, but has a lighter head and super dark looks. Roasted notes on smell and taste, there's some hops under there too. Taste is one of the smoothest dark beers ever. drinkabiliity is ""session level", it's a great beer overall."
"Drink this is a very easy drinking beer. After two I could easily had more without being overwhelmed."
"Inch of tan head settles to nothing and leaves little lacing. Very dark brown body, practically black. Not much to the smell, but the taste is nice. Dark sweet malts, little bitterness. Smooth at first than some tingly carbonation."
"D- Very drinkable. It flows well enough that its certainly a good session beer (especially at 4.9 abv). not the best schwarz i've ever had, but it's not bad. A pretty simple beer, but I feel like Shiner doesn't get the respect it deserves for making simple, yet good beers. not every beer needs a thousand aspects to it. Black Lager is just a simple, decent beer."
"The body does not match the taste, and the taste is not very smooth, I'll pass."
"Poured into a clear 20 oz pint glass it had about 1/2 inch coffee colored head its lacing of glass was minimal. Roasty aroma, bold taste, hint of coffee,dark chocolately taste. First time trying not bad at all. Would be a nice beer to keep on hand to have once and awhile."
"The body was what is expected for the style, solid, smooth, not sticky. Drinkability was very good, I can see keeping a few of these around for those easy drinkin' moments. Worth trying."
"Great drinkability. When nothing better is available, I never regret filling the night with as many of these as I neeed to get my fill."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. The black lager appears a deep chestnut brown color with about an inch of ecru foam. No lacing to speak of. Nose and flavor consist of bittersweet chocolate, light coffee notes, caramel, toast, mocha. medium in both body and carbonation. Pretty nice."
"D - Uber-sessionable... Not much in the way of complexity, but not every beer needs to be... This is mild, enjoyable, and a beer I would embrace in the future... Not the best Schwarzbier, but a respectably solid one... Never have I had such a wonderful beer with such an average taste..."
"Dark black, no light through. A little bit of head, like the rest of the Shiner Beers, quickly dissipated. Smell is of faint roasted coffee beans. The taste is clean with coffee and a little sweetness, perhaps molasses. Very smooth, low carbonation. Drinks like a light stout. Next to the hefeweizen this would be my next favorite Shiner beer."
"Wow, I was hoping that this would be a better beer, but the DMS is so strong here that I can't pull anything else over it. There is a slight smokiness to the roast but it is shadowed by the veg flavor. I almost wish for diacetyl, as it would be bit expected here, but not DMS."
"D - Between the flavor and the feel, this is definitely a drinkable beer especially in the cooler months. Not fully refreshing with the strong flavor but good none the less."
"Poured a deep brown with a miniscule head that disappeared very quickly into a bare collar. The aroma was similar to the head. The taste was watery, nothing was strong enough to stand out. Carbonation was the closest thing to taste, like seltzer water. The feed was, I don't know, what's lighter that light bodied? Drinkability was OK, but so is water. The only other schwarzbier I have tasted was Xingu and the Spoetzl black lager paled in comparison. It wasn't horrible, just nearly non-existent."
"The mouth is thin and wet. Not much carbonation going on in the mouth. This is pretty tame in the flavor dept, but it's not bad. Some roasty, nutty presence at the onset, and it finishes slightly sweet. This is a bottle of malty goodness here. Not the greatest representation of the style, but a good one nonetheless."
"D: Not hard to drink and not objectionable but far down the list of black/dark lagers and schwarzbiers. A lot of grain sneaks through and more care could be given to the hopping to bring a crisp, more complex brew."
"Worth a try, could drink several in a setting"
"Drinkability: While I can see the appeal of this beer to some, quite frankly it's just not for me."
"This beer taste good and has a nice appearance. Like most things from Shiner, nothing fancy, just a solid beer for those who enjoy a bit of darkness. Not bad at all. Highly recommend the Shiner sampler, as it has some good beers. Was very surprised by the overall goodness and qualtiy. Too bad their staple beer is their shittiest."
"Notes - This is by far Shiner's best beer, since they retired the dunkelweizen. It's flavorful and somewhat complex, but still drinkable. My only beef is that it's too carbonated."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with a couple of fingers of tan head. Malty aroma with cocoa, some noble hops and a little black patent. Starts out with some malty sweetness. Light to medium bodied and fairly drinkable. Lingering dry finish of chocolate. This was decent, not up to the standards of say a Kostritzer."
"Verdict: I remember Shiner 97 when it was fresh having quite a bit more character and depth than this, but that might be because my palate wasn't quite as advanced as it is now. As it stands, Bohemian Black Lager is an inoffensive, but generally unexciting brew."
"Overall: The best Shiner I have had to date. This beer outshines The Commemorator. It should have been their 100th Anniversary beer."
"No head, but it was very fizzy, perhaps a little too much so, but at less than 5% abv and with this great of flavor, I think this schwarzbier defines drinkability."
"Drinkability: Over all i liked it, but i still like xingu more. Have not tried many others in this style. this would go very good with food though, i feel it would add some complexity to pizza and pasta."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark clear umber with mahogany highlights. Decent sized tan head that fizzles a little too quickly. Aroma is quite solid actually, lightly roasted malts and some chocolate and cream notes. Not very robust but a nice nose. Flavor is watered down coffee with a mineral finish. Like when you're at a tasting and you just had a stout in your glass and you pour some water in there to wash the residue away and when you drink the water you're drinking Shiner Black Lager. Pass on this one."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Here is where I get personal. Dark beers are not really my cup of tea, and it's a bit on the fizzy side. Compared to others of its kind, it rates fairly, but its kind overall does not appeal to me. It does redeem itself with a nice buzz."
"this is a good transitional beer, especially for texans. i see a lot of people drinking this that normally wouldn't try craft, simply because Texans are damn proud of their little brewery (for some reason). i pick up some of this every couple of months."
"Pouring from the bottle into a pint glass yielded a dark-black body with amber-red corners and a tan head that fizzed up just like cola and disappeared. Aroma is of sweet raisins. Medium bodied with flavors of vanilla and roasted malt. Finishes clean. This is not bad, but could be done better."
"M/D - Easy drinker, even in July. I see why it's popular in Texas. A very good example of a German Dark."
"drinkability: overall this beer sucks but i love the style so I didn;t kill the score."
"Overall: I think this is Shiner's top offering. It's not special, but it's decent. On par with most in the style, though a bit behind the Sam Adams and Saranac offerings. Nothing stood out really. I think the label is actually my favorite part of this beer."
"Drinkability: So I may not have given this thing straight A's, but this is my favorite of Shiner's regular beer lineup. A good beer in a pretty under-represented style among American breweries and also fairly easy to find. Goes down easy and more than one could easily be had in one sitting."
"It's drinkable, but not memorable.I would order it over budweiser but thats not saying much A poor attempt. But what did i expect from spoetzl."
"D: Low ABV makes this one go down easy. I was surprised at the level of complexity. The acidic finish was the only real mark against this beer. Overall, a nice offering."
"Pours black with a fluffy tan head. Head died down rather quick and disappeared. Smells are of roasted malt, coffee, licorice, and a crisp sweet yeasty aroma. The initial taste is roasted coffee malt and a little bit of bitter chocolate, there is some sweetness followed by a floral hop flavor. Pretty good flavors. The mouthfeel was a little bit watery. It's not that bad though. I could definitely have a few of these. This beer is way better than the bock and in my opinion their best beer (from what I've tried so far)."
"Shiner black has a dark brown color followed by a very light roasted aroma. The smell really seems to be lacking in complexity. Taste is a clean, dry finishing lager with roasted flavors added in. Although the complexity is lacking, its roasted finish makes up for this. It's a lager so, it fits the clean taste well. Mouthfeel is solid and I could easily drink this as a session beer. This is better, in my opinion, than the Shiner Bock brewed by Spoetzl."
"Bohemian Black Lager is an above average beer, but not by much. It's tough to call it disappointing since I wasn't expecting much, but it still is a little. There's not enough of anything here. It needs quite a bit more malt and hops to improve the flavor. It needs a lot of work on the nose and the body (though an infusion of malt would probably help solve that problem). In a word, Bohemian Black Lager is very ""meh."" Probably worth a try, but not much more than that."
"Pours a deep dark brown color with a tan head. Leaves a good amount of lacing as well. This is a fairly good looking beer. Smells of some faint grainy notes, and some roasted malt. I've certainly had more aromatic schwarzbiers but it's still fairly nice. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, and highly carbonated. Roasted malt flavor dominates, but it still finishes fairly dry. I want to say I can detect some floral-like flavors off the hops, but I'm not sure. They're faint if they're there. This is my favorite Shiner offering to date, I think."
"D - Mildly tasty, and lower alcohol. Very good beer to have after your taste buds are shot. Good party beer too."
"D- Not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination. While the aroma was weak, the taste was full. I'm not a huge fan of smoky beers but this one is fine. Don't think I want another right now though..."
"Taste initiates as if this were a stout though surely with less body. Notes of chocolate up front with some hops at the back. A firm carbonation clears things out quickly though there is a bit of lingering dark cherry and caramel on the finish. Good feel though perhaps a bit too much on the carbonation as for the feel, though this also allows for a soda-like drinkability. Decent."
"A very nice dark beer, but not too strong in bitterness. A dark brown color with some red if you hold it up to the light, it forms a nice head upon pouring but it rapidly disappeared, not even any lace on the glass. It has a nice lager beer smell upon opening the bottle, with something a little sweet after it's in the glass. Very good taste - you get a lager up front, then some of the coffee/roasted grain, and then a lager finish which is mild. Nothing very bitter at all. Not too fizzy on the tongue but you'll definitely notice the carbonation. Overall quite good, and it went really well with Swedish Meatballs (with Ligonberry preserves of course) and mashed potatoes."
"D-Drinkable, but not overly impressive. Light and easy to enjoy."
"Drinkability? Very easy to drink and a pretty good example of the style...this is my favourite Shiner beer, hands down."
"Pretty good stuff. Nice head, lots of wonderful roasted malt aroma. Very dark. To me it taste kind of like Guiness, kind of like Sam Adams BL w/o the piney citrus taste. I notice a chocolate/burnt coffee taste, but its all about the roasted malt. Jmho, this is the best beer Shiner makes."
"With the weak flavor and robust carbonation, it's extremely drinkable. My companion who hates malt taste says she could drink several of these in an evening."
"this beer is the reason i found this site and wanted to learn more about beer so i owe it a big thanks for that"
"Not a bad beer, but not one to look for either."
"I think this is an okay beer. Sometimes I really like it, and other times I'm not such a fan. It's a great alternative to a macro style lager, though, and it's a totally drinkable brew. Not the best schwarzbier you'll find, but probably not the worst. Nice on a hot Texas summer day. Should pair well with the chicken-jalapeno sausages I am going to throw on the grill later today."
"I can't say I dislike it, it's just nothing special."
"Pours a black, dark brown colored body, with a big creamy, cream colored head, that is somewhat diminishing. Has a malty nutty taste, not very strong. Watery dusty taste, some malts. More bocky taste than stout. Nutty. Somewhat fruity taste, like cherries. Tasty."
"it smells and tastes off, kind of metallic. its thin and watery in the mouth, but the one thing it has going for it is drinkability. its not very good, but i could see it being refreshing on a hot day if it was really cold."
"Pours black as hell with no head. head disappears into a thin film on top of the beer. kind of oily looking. smell is really strong of caramel and ripe dark fruits. taste is caramel up front, with a cherry after taste. a hint of butterscotch also. mouthfeel is slightly sticky. pretty well carbonated. drinkability is high on this beer. overall average beer, but will be a staple in my new home."
"Medium bodied and medium carbonation. One and done for me. Another typical Shiner, not bad beer, just a bit boring is all."
"Excellent drinkability. Not too sweet or thin bodied, everything seemed in good balance. The fact the beer was a little on the sweet side did not pose a problem because it didn't leave your tounge stuck to the roof of your mouth."
"It's not outright terrible, as the basis of the schwazbier style can be recognized, but it's too frail and flawed to recommend."
"Would have another. Not sure about age of bottle so issues may have been related to freshness."
"Refreshing, I guess. And 4-5 bucks a sixer it's a decent session option, what with the economy and all."
"Tasty, probably Shiner's best year-round beer."
"Of the three I've tried from Shiner, this was the best for my tastes. It won't become a staple in my home, but I'll probably buy it once a year or so."
"Pours an opaque chocolaty-sable with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is rich, smoky and chocolaty, inviting a taste. Flavor is dark and malty, smoky, with a yeasty overtone and undertones of unsweetened chocolate, as well as a hint of fine coffee. Texture is very smooth, and leaves a rather yeasty and somewhat malty aftertaste."
"Pours with a decent enough head that ends up leaving no lacing. Body looks flat black, but is actually a very dark brown. No reddish highlights at all. Smell contains lots of charred malts...a very earth quality to this one...maybe some peat aromas. Not too sweet smelling. Taste doesn't surprise. Just what you would expect after that aroma. Some char, earthy peat qualities, slight hop bitterness with a bone dry finish. High carbonation...not so much in a bubbly way...it just adds a little carbonic bite to it. Not bad for the style. Nice to see Shiner trying something new."
"D - eh, I'd drink it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice, or hundred and first."
"From a 12 oz. bottle purchased at the local grocery store and poured into a Willi Becher style glass. Aroma is of sweetened coffee. Color is a deep brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Thin tan head dissipated quickly. Flavor is a clean lager followed by chocolate and roast with a little earthy hop in the finish. This is actually a very nice, easy-drinking beer like a schwartzbier should be."
"M & D - Good crisp feel when first drank, a little too much of a metallic aftertaste. Lips feel slightly sticky, like after a soda. Overall a good, not a great lager, but worth trying. Wouldn't say no if offered."
"Good beer but I thought it wanna gonna be better.Ive only had the type of beer a few times in the past but Ive had better."
"Into a pint glass, pours a pretty dark, opaque black, some nice head to begin with, but recedes to a ring around the glass. There is some nice lacing too, in thick streaks. The aroma is bland and vague malt, mostly caramelish, some darker molasses-like tones. Tastes pretty ok, but again, flat and uninteresting, malts in caramel and licorice tones. The mouth is lacking good enough body, not bad, but not good, and also the carbonation is a bit too lively. In all, easy enough to drink, not all that bad to drink, but not really that enthralling."
" This beer is okay, not one I'd drink everyday. For a dark chocolaty beer I'd rather have a milk stout. But with the chocolate malts and grape/wine flavor this would be a great pairing with steak or lamb. This is almost like a desert beer in my opinion. I like Shiner's beers and this is another fine example of their line."
"as of right now this is my favorite brew that shiner makes. it has an appealing appearance, (even though the head isn't that impressive) a nice smell of roasted malts and barley, and that leads you right into the taste. great roasted malts and barley flavor. the mouthfeel was a little thin but still ok, and this is for sure a session beer."
"The dark lager provides a little bit thicker keeping it from being a session beer, yet more flavorful than most session beers."
"D: Alright; not the best for the style. I think I'd go for a Sam Adams Black Lager next time."
"i like the drinkaility on this one and the flavors are well balanced. I can taste the roasted malts, but the aroma isn't too smokey. Definitely a decent session beer that I wouldn't normally go to, but I'd drink this again."
"not something i would normally be looking out for, but a good example (i would guess). the contrast of the light body and dark malts seems a bit conflicting to me, but they have handled the balance very well."
"Schwarzbier is a style you dont see a whole lot of and well to be honest I didnt think this beer would be real traditional, but I gotta say I liked the subtle qualities of this.Poured into my Monchshof schwarzbier glass a deep cola color with a fluffy off white head that left shotty lace as it settled.German malt aromas,iron and metallic with some bitter chocolate and earth,with a slight roasted nut element,flavors are quite earthy and dry with some metallic notes and unsweetened chocolate.Toastiness shows thru as I drink more and its quaffable,not bad,not bad at all."
"Drinkability: While the thin, watery nature of this beer lends itself to overall drinkability, the lack of flavor and complexities prevents me from wanting to ever again wanting to drink it in the first place."
"Good beer, highly drinkable, a little too watery, is a local favorite of mine. Only problem i have is the weird metallic after taste that many shiner beers have"
"Pretty solid. Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, ant the taste if nothing to write home about either. Decent drinkability though. Certainly not bad, just nothing to really distinguish it either. Decent quaff."
"Got some from my daughter in Texas as a Christmas gift - it drinks well without filling you up. I poured it into a Pilsner glass for a head of an inch or so. As a porter and stout drinker, I was surprised at the lightness of it given the color, but then, it's a lager. I'd like this on on a warm summer day."
"Drinability. Drinkability was high for this beer. I would pick it up again."
"D. Well, this was a treat. Enjoy this one more than Shiner Bock. This is a fine beverage that I will be buying again. Good session brew."
"NOTE: Make sure you try this one in the bottle, it's really better that way in my opinion."
"It got a wonderful rich nose appeal the flavor is there but not as appealing as the aroma. It is a descent beer."
"There are only a handful of beers I think taste better from the bottle and this is one of them. Try pouring in a glass first and then try straight from the bottle and see if you think the flavor is better."
"Beer pours very dark mahogeny color with ruby red highlights and a nice creamy beige colored head. Aroma is dark roasted malt with some light smoke. Flavor is malty, bready, with a very decent amount of smokiness. A very good beer as far as being from Shiner. Like the label.Drinkable but not special"
"D- Not really my kind of beer so I would't have more than one in a sitting."
"its a good drinkable beer and like other Shiner beers is a good value."
"It has nice roasty smell to it. That is actually kind of odd it is more of a cooked roasted smell than a burnt one. It is a dark and opaque colored beer. It has thin tan head and lace resembles a porter or even a stout. There is some nice lacing though. It has a roasty taste but not over roasted. It is not harsh at all. There is just a little bit of a metallic aftertaste. It is smooth and not much for bite."
"This beer pours a dark brown, almost black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, and not much else. The taste is much of the same. The mouthfeel is medium light bodied, with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this beer is decent at best. It lacks the malty spiciness of a true schwarzbier. I will not be drinking this again."
"Woody leather aroma, quaff turns a bit resinous and hoppy. Not as smooth as I would have liked. Not a bad Schwartz, but not along the lines of the better ones, or the mass market ones (Sammy or New Belgium). Good price, I'd have more if this was the only option."
"drinkability is good. this is a lighter brew with a mildly roasty character, which is what a schwarzbier should be, but the lightness seems to dampen the potential richness of the malt, and the thinness discounts the dark flavors a bit too much."
"If you want to change up your lager selction a few of these won't be bad."
"Overall, a great session beer, and a nice alternative to macro lagers."
"inexpensive tasty thin lager...easily in the same class as sam adam's black lager. buy a case of it to drink while tailgating ncaa football and check it out. beer is an adventure. there are few black lagers on the market to compare it to. drink shiner black lager once and you will drink it again. livestrong. south austin dave"
"Personally I would not drink more than one of these as it is not my favored style of beer."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with red highlights. Thin tan head. Smell is slightly yeasty and metallic. Taste is light; roasted bitterness that fades into a slightly metallic finish. Very little malt or hops flavor. Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation average. Pretty drinkable though, I could drink several of these, though I've had better Schwarzbiers. Overall I would drink this again, but I would not go out of my way to buy it."
"It is...aptly named...black. It has a thin, dense, persistant light tan head. It smells of coffee, cinnamon, and wood. It tastes of roast, roast, and more roast. Almost burnt, really, with a metallic edge. The mouthfeel is thin and watery but slick at the end. The drinkability is, well, as drinkable as the burnt aftertaste allows. Not awful but not....really...memorable."
"A bit too one-dimensional and strong in roasted flavor, not the best example of the style in the world. The price is nice though, being about $3 CHEAPER THAN THE Sam Adams equivalent. If you want to know without a doubt what roasted barley tastes like, buy this beer."
"This beer has restored some of my faith in this brewery. It's certainly better than the flagship Bock. Given its affordability and lack of balck lagers on the market, this might get a second purchase."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. This one tastes and feels fine, it's just a bit on the boring end. Nothing wrong with it though, definitely a nice cheap way to keep around a Schwarzbier"
"Pours a deep amber to a black color, with a small white head. In the aroma, a faint roasty coffee. In the taste, a small dry roasty coffee, yet kind of bland. A small bite and a light mouthfeel, with a dry, roasty aftertaste. Small body and light to no body. Kind of dry and really kind of weak and not worth it."
"Drinkability: a good beer that is well crafted, very drinkable, and widely available. A nice effort by Shiner."
"D- Drinks amazingly well for a dark beer"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, I found this beer to be surprisingly refreshing for a dark beer. It's definitely a beer worth drinking several of if you're in the mood for the style."
"Bottle pours a clear dark brown body with a small beige head. Some scattered lace is left on the glass. Aroma is a bit subdued, but has some toasted malt, baked dark bread, chocolate, and a hint of spicy hop. Medium body and average carbonation. Taste is spot on for style, with notes of fresh baked brown bread, spicy hops, and a hint of chocolate. Nothing to write home about but a solid example of the style."
"A refreshing beer that would be great for a hot day. Also a good session beer."
"D: very drinkable beer, probably my favorite from Spoetzl thus far. nothing amazing, but very good for a larger brewery."
"D - It's a very sessionable brew, if uninteresting. Aside from the slightly offensive metallic character, it's a decent, easy drinking beer for the price. I probably won't buy this again, but I doubt I'll have a problem getting through the six pack."
"Mild roasted malt presence up front. Hint of cardboard. A bit earthy with a mineral edge. Some chocolate mid-palate. Roasted coffee bitterness takes over into a creamy finish. Not bad. Moderate body with a lively feel up front. Maybe a little thin for my liking, but it sure goes down easy."
"d: very easy drinking, not very flavorful. I don't expect much from shiner, but this one is pretty good."
"Overall, a drinkable brew, but not a go-to."
"Too easy to drink and light on flavors, even for a Schwarzbier."
"A pretty good drinker and not bad for an American representation of the style. I will likely revisit this beer once or twice a year in the early summer months with a super fresh six pack."
"Dark brown to black in color. Virtually no head after being poured into a pint glass. A few bubbles of texture and it somewhat causes me to think of ""cola."" Deep roast caramel nose and ""dark"" smelling. Malty but with a lighter attack. Smoky flavors of roast malt and smoke come through but are not overdone. Some grainy ""macrobeer"" aftertaste. It is a good attempt by one of the larger little breweries to make beer that appeals to the niche of some craft beer drinkers. I would grade it a C+ but with some wiggle room."
"This black beer offers a fairly enticing scent, but then surprises the drinker with a taste that is slightly different and also somewhat watery. It does include a roasted coffee and black malt taste, and this is nice, but the flavors don't come toward you with full force like I was hoping. They tend toward the subtle side and the beer finishes a little watery and weak. Not bad for a German schwarzbier, but it would be better with a little more body and a less watery finish."
"Highly recommend."
"D - Overall a decent and average session beer that I could see drinking on a hot summer day. It is interesting to have a dark beer that tastes so much like a pilsner. Could see this as a lager to introduce to people who are scared of dark beers since this isn't too bad and easy to drink."
"The saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes to mind here; it's well-warrented because it's a great beer. If Spoetzl would tap the Chicago-area market more, I would place this into my ""study beer"" category. This is my first review, and I'll say that the only reason that I've had the priveledge of tasting this beer is because I'm in Denver for an internship. Giddy-up Spoetzl - well done."
"D: Low, sessionable ABV and satisfying flavor...past experience tells me this would pair nicely with grilled meat. Certainly I want to try this again; Schwarzbier is a style both my wife and I have grown into and this seems like a good one - just want to try it in the freshest state possible. Looking forward to more coming this way from Texas sometime soon."
"Never could put my finger on what the taste was and maybe I had a bad batch but no thanks on this one."
"M/D - Strong taste but light to medium bodied. Feels a little thin in the mouth. Well carbonated. A drinkable brew, but nothing spectacular."
"d - decent beer but not something i'd seek out."
"Overall, not too exciting. Easty to drink, but I wouldn't go looking for another one of these."
"I have to admit my expectations were exceeded with this finely crafted black lager. I'm a big Kostritzer fan and this little number didn't let me down in the least. Nice texture, mellow and balanced 'dark' flavors in the body of a crisp & refreshing lager. I'm impressed!"
"mouthfeel is crisp, hop bitter, smooth malt, carbonation brings out hop bitterness - nice, i would drink again"
"Ultimately this beer seriously lacks in flavor and what little it does have does not make me want to fish it out of the drain. This is a big disappointment for me, which is a pity as I usually love the style."
"I liked and enjoyed this beer despite the fact it wasn't terribly complexin the malt flavors. Basically there's a really nice roasted malt flavor that provides expresso and dried cocoa flavors. The yeast add a touch of fruitiness and there's also a nice balance of sweet malt sugar with the bitter roasted grains. Worth a try, pretty drinkable and overall a tasty brew."
"A decent beer from Spoetzl but one that I would probably pass by if available around my area. I do love a good schwarzbier but this falls a little flat."
"*I upped my original ratings, as I did end up finishing the six pack (over time) but mainly because maybe this just isn't my style of brew... maybe my palette just doesn't agree with this style... so, benefit of the doubt goes to Shiner's black lager."
"And oddly enough, the taste was actually a little distinct from the smell. There was a slight coffee hint with the roasted malts and a little sweet, then a bitterness to finish it off from the hops. The bitterness was actually pretty well balanced. I would definitely be more jazzed about the beer if the smell had not ruined it for me."
"D - This is a pretty good brew. The coffee taste is unique."
"D: This may not be the best or most complex dark lager I've had, but it is very drinkable. I'd actually buy this again."
"D: Very drinkable because it is so light. Has a bit of heavy taste but nothing dynamic or complex."
"Another beer brought back from Omaha. Not quite up to the Sprecher schwarz's level but not too bad. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: An very good beer IMO. Good enough taste to not be boring or wear you out. I think this is sessionable. This will find its way into my fridge again."
"The mouth is a trifle thin, but this is a easy drinking hot weather type of black lager."
"This is a fantastic beer. Nice dark flavor with a crisp after touch, but almost too drinkable. This beer, even though as dark as it is can be enjoyed by the appreciative and those who don't enjoy good beers. Very smooth across the entire gulp...six pack...or more."
"Darkest brown - more like a German dunkel in color than a schwartzbier. Mild aromas of roasted malts, caramel, and coffee. Once again, it tasted more like a dunkel - a dunkel with more roast to it. Medium body glides around the mouth with ease, leaving a little caramel but mostly dry finish. This is a Shiner I can finally stand behind without hesitation."
"D: A little to bitter to be a very drinkable beer. Other than that there is nothing stopping me from having a few in one sitting."
"D - Eh? Not bad, but not a whole lot of flavor or aroma in this brew. Also, I feel that it is way too carbonated. It's not hard to drink by any means, it's just not all that exciting."
"What a pleasant surprise. Saw this at the store today. A fan of the style, I noted the great ""black on black"" packaging and decided to give it a try. Definitely not on par with the Sam Adams Black or Saranac Black Forest, but a tasty, drinkable option for us Schwarzbier fans. Very dark (cola-black) in the glass, nice foamy head that left quickly. Rich, roasted malt in the nose and in the initial taste. Refreshingly light body. Not bad."
"Texas aint no nuffin about Ales, but Shiner sure knows its Lagers. This brewery does a lot of creative things with Lagers, and they need to keep it up. Back from retirement, and a new label design, Shiner 97... all the things you despise in a lager, plus all the things you love in an ale. Certainly worth trying. They got this one right."
"The black and silver label is great and is exactly how the label on a schwarzbier (black beer) should look. Too bad the contents of the bottle aren't quite up to snuff. I would have no trouble drinking Bohemian Black Lager in a pinch, but it isn't a beer that I'll buy again."
"This may not be over-exceptional but a solid offering that is definitely sessionable. A darker lawnmower offering? Most definitely."
"D - This is a very easy style for me to enjoy as a lover of coffee, lager, porter and German beer in general. I didn't embrace this style until I left Germany, but this has all the finer points of a good schwarzbier. The feel is a bit more crisp and almost chalky, though. I consider this one of the better products Shiner has to offer. I find this very drinkable and would have loved to have a case to share, but they don't sell this, at least I have never seen it around Central PA."
"Not recommended. Flawed and relatively boring."
"D: minus weird smell, pretty tasty, still the bast effort I've tasted from Shiner"
"This one pours a nearly black, brownish color with some deep ruby highlights and a light tan cap. The nose is toasted and lightly roasted grains with some earthy hops and just the barest hints of chocolate malts. The taste is very much the same, with maybe even less chocolate and earth than the nose possessed. The body is medium with a modest and unspectacular carbonation and mouthfeel. Not bad, but not overly complex either. I won't have strong urges to try this one again."
"Drinkability = really really good .. no big flavors to make you ponder. This could also be a gateway for people who think dark beers are ""heavy"". Best Shiner beer I've tasted, so far!"
"The body is light, but this is slightly compensated by the taste. Mouthfeel is excellent making this a good intro to the style. Could actually be a decent BBQ sipper this summer!!!"
"Pours with a fizzy tan head that dissipates quickly. On first glance appears black but reveals a ruby tone with brown edges when held up to the light. Smell is burnt and offensive and a little bit like burnt popcorn. Taste is a bit more redeeming with some earthy hops in the finish and some creamy chocolate flavors combating that burnt. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side and easier on the carbonation than most Shiner products. Finishes dry so burnt taste aside this one is an easy drinker. Not the best I've had of the style but for 5.50 a 6 pack this is hard to turn down."
"Poured a very dark brown that light barely passed through. There was a nice off white head but it dissapeared as quickly as it formed leaving nothing. The beer ended up looking like flat pepsi. The smell was a little sweet with a roasted malt aroma. I really liked the taste though. Tasted of sweet and roasted malts with a nice tartness in the finish. The mouthfeel was a little thin which is good for the style but seems a little odd for such a dark beer. Overall, I really liked this for what it was, a lager that is dark enough for me to enjoy on a regular basis. I'm a big fan of Yuengling and make it my go to beer when nothing else on tap interests me but if I see this in the same place I might switch it up."
"Received in a trade (thanks Deniz). Served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of cola with some deep red highlights. Half-inch off-white head settled into a thin, fairly consistent layer of foam within the first minute following the pour. Some watery lacing, but poor adherence. Very mild smell - A sweet malty nose immediately out of the bottle, followed by more of a persistent smell of grains. Taste is very consistent with nose, with perhaps a slightly watered-done coffee flavor somewhere, but taste is pretty clean with a mild hops presence detectable at the end. Watery texture is somewhat offset by the slightly effervescent mouthfeel. Seems like it would be pretty sessionable and definitely goes down easy."
"Pous like a coca cola. Smell is dull cardboardy malt. Dull similar taste as well with a hint of roast malt in there too. Average body, with a bubbly carbonation. Not too offensive, but not my favorite beer or style. A bit better than their dunkel I thought."
"My first Schwartzbier, and I wasn't impressed. Not enough roasted flavor for me. I know the style isn't supposed to have roasted malt flavor but I was expecting it being that it was a black lager. Much less flavorful than their bock or their blonde. I will not be buying this one again."
"Tasted on 3/6/08"
"D - Well this isn't a beer that will blow you a way it is pretty decent after having the 98 I wanted to try the other special releases worth a try whenever you get to it"
"I probably would not buy this beer again because I am not a big fan of light tasting beers."
"Well, not for me, but a good starter to darker beers. I think the SA Dark Lager would be a better, more rounded choice, but this one was okay."
"I'm glad they decided to bring this one back."
"Light/medium bodied, fairly smooth, easy to drink."
"D - It's nice because of the clean taste, but I wish it had more punch. The flavors are good, but hidden. Like a shy but pretty girl, this one could be a knockout if it would come out of the shadows."
"Mouthfeel is slightly heavily bodied and over carbonated, which attributes to the slamming of flavor on the tongue - which does mellow as the beer warms."
"The beer pours out to a good black color with a tan head. Not too carbonated. Has a very complex taste. Carmel and what chared malt taste. After taste is a little sweet. Very good beer."
"Dark black with a one finger head that reduces to a tan ring around the brew. Smell is nonexistent, not catching anything on the nose, completely dry and aroma less. Taste is dry and after tastes reminds me of Shiner Bock. Not a brew I'm wild about, nothing really impressive or distinctive here. Probably good if you lean more toward the German styles, but thats not me."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is low, lacing is OK. Aroma is roasted malt, caramel and a charred/burnt malt aroma too. However, the aroma is weak. Luckily the taste is stronger. It tastes like roasted malt, coffee and charred/burnt malt. Not much hops from what I can tell, but I think it tastes good. Mouthfeel/body is light, feels a little bit slick but almost watery at the same time. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad beer at all, I liked it. Worth a try for sure."
"Overall, quite drinkable, but not outstanding."
"Pours a deep brwon with some even deeper ruby highlights. A nice one and a half finger tan head, but light bubbling. Very light creamy and heavy toasty, roasty aroma. The taste has a lot of dark polish rye bread. with some very light creamy butter. Very smooth and dark palate, yet light and easy. Great beer."
"Overall this seems like an OK session beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"If you like black beers, purchase a couple. Not a big mouthfeel at all."
"As a side note, I cooked with this beer last night and it turned out pretty good. I used it in a sauce that usually calls for Shiner Bock, but I think it turned out better with this beer."
"Overall impression: Not bad - drinkable, but not nearly my favorite example of the style."
"Overall, it's a fairly well-balanced and rounded dark lager that's got more flavor than the usual. Enjoyable and drinkable."
"Easy to drink, but very uninteresting."
"D - Good overall flavor and light enough to enjoy a couple."
"Prosit!"
"This is a simple beer, but an enjoyable one. A beer I will revisit. A good black lager."
"Drinks good, but needs more malt backbone, still, this is better than I remember the 97 tasting"
"Overall Impression: A solid beer. Im glad to see another Shiner choice out there. This would pair well with some BBQ."
"Im surprised this ones rated as high as it is. Looks like a headless, watery stout. Has an unfortunate lager smell, which is nothing but malt with a bit of skunkiness. Palate is thin, yet somehow filmy. Flavor is malt with a bit of chocolate and maybe caramel. I detected a metallic flavor as well, but no real hop bitterness."
"This was my favorite specialty brew Shiner so far. Easily outshines the Amber, and is well ahead of the 96 Marzen. I think this replaced Shiner Bock as My Beer."
"Drinkability: What happened to the hops? Just to sweet and lacks complexity; easy to drink, however"
"Poured a very dark brown to almost black. Quickly dissipating off-white head. Aroma of roasted malt. Flavor of dark roasted malt and coffee. This is a very tasty offering from Shiner on their 97th birthday. They should consider making this a permanent addition to their beer line-up."
"Again gotta love this little German style brewery from down in Texas and anyone who's ever driven through the lonestar state knows there basically two options that people drink as their local, Shiner Bock or Lonestar. Nice to see other German style popping up from them this one appears a dark cola ruby brown almost dark black nearly opaque...nice sized tan head dwindles rather quickly with light even lace that sticks to the glass well. Aromatics have alot of those dry slightly bitter dark chocolate roasted qualities mild watered down coffee with herbal hop traces going on. Flavor more watered down roastiness with dark chocolate cocoa powder and a subtle caramel sweetness with mild herbal hop finish overall a very light schwarzbier. Mouthfeel is light bodied evenly carbonated nothing too remarkable but definitely smooth going down . Drinkability is decent better than most dark style lagers around but I tend to want more flavor hell with Sam Adams Black Lager there's just no need to ever go for this one again."
"Poured dark, deep brown almost black with little head that was quickly gone. Very smooth with the proper amount of carbonation. I really liked this beer, probably my favorite from the Shiner line. Extremely drinkable and satisfying. One of the better Schwarzbiers I have had lately. I could drink this and Sam Adams Black Lager exclusively for a month or so. Good stuff."
"A nice schwarzbier. Personally I'd prefer a little more sweetness, but plenty good as-is."
"Extremely drinkable. Very nice beer."
"This brew is dark chocolate brown with a thick and foamy beige head that has decent retention. Patchy lacing spattered on the glass. Aroma of malt and nuts, as well as a bit of chocolate. Medium-bodied with a roasty character and dark malt and chocolate flavors. The flavor is pretty good, but the body becomes increasingly thin throughout. The finish is sweet malt and caramel, with a touch of hops on the back. Above average overall, but not by a lot."
"I am in agreement with many of the others that have reviewed this beer. It is just ok. Very dark in appearance but the flavor doesn't quite match the intensity of the color. The smell is hints of cocoa and other various malts, but again, kinda weak and soft. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy which I did like."
"When held up to light, this black lager shows it's ruby hues. Small head that tries it best to hang around till the end. Nose is faint, with a small sweet, chocolate note. Taste is also sweet and malty and comes to a clean finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected. This is what I would call a good dinner beer."
"Cheers!"
"D- Again, like German lagers typically are, this is a very drinkable, ""session"" type beer, which you could have several, and not feel the worse for it. The ABV is not listed on the bottle, but it can't be much over (or under) 4.5% by the way it tastes. This really is a great style, well captured here, for those who won't be fooled by it's color. Don't expect a porter or stout--think while you drink German or Czech!"
"This beer poured a back color with a thin creamy head which lasted a long time. The smell was malty ans slightly sweet. The taste is bitter with a hint of sweetness that makes a nice balance. It has a surprisingly thin mouthfeel. The smoothness and lighter body of this beer make it quite drinkable."
"Drinkability- Overall a pretty decent change of pace. I really like the very slight smokey flavor. Pretty nice."
"Not too bad for the price."
"Overall, a very nice offering from shiner. A well balanced beer with nice roasted flavors. Could enjoy one seperate, or have as a session."
"Drinkability - quite drinkable. Tasty, not too heavy, it's alright!"
"The beer pours clear for a Schwarz, though they are supposed to be clear. I say this only because it is more of a reddish amber than a Black. There was a 1/4"" off white head that fell pretty quickly to end up as a small ring to linger for a while. There is definitely some caramel along with a mild roast. The beer is very dry and well attenuated so that it comes across as a bit dry. There is no real hops apparent, so the malt is about all you get in the finish. Once the malt fades, which is pretty quickly, it leaves you with a bit of sweetness to sit on the palate giving a refreshing finish that borders on wet. This is a pretty good beer...especially for Shiner."
"D - Not a bad beer but there isn't really anything outstanding here. In a forest of American lights I would choose this, but if given a wide choice of brews, I would pass this one up."
"This a decent drinkable beer, the taste is a bit off for me but overall not bad"
"This one has a very lively taste, with a hint a tartness in it, but goes down quite smoothly and is nicely accompanied by a slighty fruity aroma. It pours out with a nice dark amber color to it and it leaves a hint of flavor right in the back of your throat."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, I will for sure have it again."
"D: Overall, makes me think more of a sweet bock or Marzen than a schwarzbier. Really not a bad beer if you can find it relatively cheap, or are just looking for a palate cleanser. This is pretty much what I wish mainstream beer would be in America."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer appeared a dark brown/black color, with a 1/2 inch head, that quickly faded, leaving little to no lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet, mostly chocolate aroma. The moutfeel is medium, thicker than a lager, but about average for this style. The taste is very much like a porter, not as strong, but still enjoyable. This is easily my favorite beer from Shiner. Definitely a session beer, and at a reasonable price too."
"One finger of dark head sits on this dark, molasses colored beer. It leaves a fractured lace and pushes up aromas of fruity hops, light roasted chocolate, and molasses. Shiner 97 has a killer schwarz taste. Light berry notes play over dark but smooth malt base. Very light chocolate and molasses tones with no roasted or otherwise harsh flavors at all. Very simple and delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied with minimal carbonation. Shiner is 2 for 2 with these special releases."
"It's an easily quaffable brew. It is light, and has a decent flavor. Because of that, I'm not sure if I'd seek it out. However, it was quite interesting to drink this dark beer but feel like I was drinking something else. Matched the description of Schwarzbier perfectly. If you had your eyes blindfolded, this could have been an Amber I've had recently, or any number of brews. The flavors were hard to pin down. Checking out some of the reviews here, I'd say everyone had the same difficulty. A deer in the headlights when your eyes see one thing, but your tastebuds seem to be decieved."
"A great beer for a great price. I think this may be my favorite new Shiner beer."
"Pours to a fluffy beige head that falls to a thin ring of foam and bits of lace. Color is dark cola/Dr Pepper. Crystal clarity. Aroma is very mild with pale lager-like malt and spicy noble hops evident. Very faint roast in the aroma. Flavor is very mild and lagery; it has very little in common with its appearance. Saaz hops give nice balance to the mild sweet dark malt. Nice clean finish with residual malt and hop notes. Mouthfeel is light to medium. It has a bit of fullness to it in the finish. Carbonation is moderate. A good beer that is as good as any other schwarzbier made in the USA."
"Certainly drinkable and likeable, but a tad timid for a style considered especially desirable in the colder months."
"Not a bad beer, but I've got too many other good beers to try out to bother with this one again."
"After trying Shiner Bock, I wasn't sure I was up for this offering. This is the second in a series of commemerative beers, leading up to the 100th anniversary of the brewery. Bohemian Black Beer is a pretty good beer. A black color with a thin head. It had a dark, roasted coffee aroma. A coffee taste, with some bread detectable. A little thin in the mouth, but quite drinkable."
"Toasted/coffee flavor with traditional black/ruby color. Soft malt aroma with specific hop presence, but not really out there. I have really quite impressed with this beer, even though it did seem a bit watered down. Most of that thin feeling I think is due to the style, but still satifying. Normally I have not enjoyed Shiner products as much as some of my peers, but this one really brought me around. Will have to give their wheat beer another try. Would be happy to have a few of these black lagers, but no more than three. Nice for a fall sampling to mix up the normal offerings of octoberfest beers or pumpkin beers. Give it a try!"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"All in all, a fairly good drinkable dark beer. The beer's color is a littler misleading, as it's as black as ink. This is only the second kind of schrawzbier I have ever tasted, seems good, maybe just lacking a little on complexity. However, it was very drinkable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"12 oz. bottle that declares they used Czech Saaz and Styrian hops - served in a pilsner glass. It pours almost black with a half-inch khaki head that leaves light lacing and smells of light, roasted malts and hints of earth. It tastes roasted with burnt malts, earth/peat, and light, spicy/green Saaz hops on top of a medium to light body that has light carbonation and a short finish - overall pretty clean but not flavorful enough. Let's hope they're slowly building up to a great #100."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Good head that lasted for awhile and then decent lacing. Had a black color that looked dark ruby against a light. Smell was kinda light with roasted malt. The mouthfeel was kinda watery but overall the taste was pretty good. Wouldn't want to drink several in a session or throughout the week but a good change-up beer. Worth trying and look forward to Shiner 98. (3.5, RR/RB, T, Y)"
"Poured a dark ruby-brown. Frothy tan head which dissipated quickly. Roasted malt and chocolate aromas, but very light. Taste is very similar aroma but with the addition of coffee and caramel flavours. A dry and slighly bitter chocolate finish. Seems perhaps a bit thin, but still very good for the style."
"This is good...very good."
"The beer does not get in the way of the mouthfeel. Alittle dry or charcoal in the finish but still very drinkable with about any meal."
"D - for this style I feel it's a little on the weak side, that being said it still is a pretty tasty brew. I was hoping for a bigger beer for the 97 but I guess the Schwarzbier is still better than the bock. It's worth a try in my opinion, but I wouldn't be heartbroken if you miss it."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with reddish highlights. It has a fizzy off white head which recedes quickly. Aroma is roasted malts. Taste is roasty with some sweetness, reminds me of chocolate. This has a medium body. This is probably the best Shiner has made so far. I like this a lot better than the 96."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Not extraordinary. I still prefer the Monchshof's version of a Schwarzbier over that - even with the price difference."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a mild ruby hue and a short tan head. Roasted malts dominate the aroma along with fainter notes of smoky charcoal and a bit of an earthiness. Taste begins with a bit of semi-sweet chocolaty malt followed by stronger flavors of black coffee. There is a certain dry, crackery and powdery texture to the beer, but it does seem a bit thin. Still, I found it enjoyable."
"It's good that Spoetzl is trying new things; however, this is not that interesting of an effort."
"Mouthfeel is thin but clean. A good effort but rather lacking in depth. I liked this better toward the end of the glass than I did at the start."
"This is a very well made beer by Shiner. It has the feel of a porter, but it's not quite as heavy. A very enjoyable beer."
"Finishes a bit sticky, but it does leave you wanting another sip."
"I really like this beer. A really nice dark color and cream tan head that gives some lacing. The smell is of a clean larger with a slight tilt of roast. Really gave a strong first impression with a nice subtle roast malt flavor follwed by a clean and almost crisp finish. Great med-light body that lends itself to a full night of drinking. This should be added to Shiner permenant rotation unlike the less than spectacular marzen from last year."
"Pours a very dark brown. Black from a far, so it definitely lives up to the name. Frothy small white head. Good carbonation streams, and small trails of lacing. Smell is roasty, with a burnt fringe. Taste upfront has a nice surge of roasted malt. A burnt, smokey taste, that lasts the duration of the sip. Balancing caramel/toffee malts work together near midway, yet only show themselves for a brief moment. Finishes roasty, with slightly bitter hops. Leaves a pleasent smokey bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light, and semi-dry. Drinkability is excellent. The hops on this one really grow on you, they are very subtle, but very smokey and fresh."
"I was worried that Shiner wouldn't be able to pull off another good limited edition beer like the 96, but they didn't let me down."
"Drinkable, though, in spite of the average mouthfeel score. A good stab at the style from Shiner, though you should look for Rahr's Ugly Pug for a more accurate (and somewhat tastier) representation of a black lager. I'll buy this one again, though, as it won't be around for too long."
"Bottle: 10-28-09. Thanks Exiled!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
