"O- The nice clean coffee flavor turns thin and watery and there are no other flavors to support it or pick up the slack. Gets a little drab getting through 12 oz."

"Overall - Wow, this is surprisingly delicious. A great balance of flavours and a nice crisp mouthfeel. Magic hat has impressed me with a lot of their beers. Well worth trying, especially if you are a fan of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Well balanced beer, and the smokiness of the malts makes it a perfect seasonal. Many of this style lack enough flavor, but this one delivers. Good stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A black lager. Pours, well, black, medium size bubbles a little lacing. Smell of molasses cocao, reminds me of a porter. Taste is much the same, strong chocolate and molasses tones, a bit of tobacco too. Leaves a clean aftertaste, fades quickly, very light mouthfeel for what it is. How light its mouthfeel is almost reminds me of an oatmeal beer, like The Poet, though this is a bit sharper. Solid beer for what it is, though a little underwhelmed overall."

"O- A pretty fine example of the style. I have to say I'm kind of impressed. Magic Hat in my past experience is pretty hit or miss, and wasn't expecting this to be the fore, but it is. I could see myself drinking this as a session brew when it's actually out (as opposed to on the sale shelf by the single 12oz). good brew."
"Overall: You don’t see many schwarzbiers and this one could easily be mistaken for a porter. Great start ends up just pretty good, which means that I wouldn’t necessarily seek this one out again, though definitely would have another if the opportunity presented."

"O- Overall, not bad but not something I would purchase again. I would prefer more hops in a beer like this."
""
""
""
""
"a swell offering from magic hat. not as good as Monchshof or Kostritzer, but very close"
""
"O- A good tasting and smelling beer that needs to add some body and/or carbonation for me to want to come back. Simply too thin."
"O - Pretty good when I comes down to it. A lot better than most of the American interpretations Iv'e tried."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent beer by Magic Hat. I can imagine enjoying this with a big fat steak on the grill."

"This is a world class beer."

"Will buy again next time around."
""
""
""
"Comments: Schwarzbier is sometimes called “black Pils”, Magic Hat Brewing Company shows why it is, not as hop dominant as a true Pilsner, but a great German-style lager that presents a full range of flavors without being burnt."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Had the carbonation not been so intense, this would be one the best dark beers that I have had in a while. If you can look past the high levels of carbonation, this is a simple yet good tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really good schwarzbier. Better than SA black lager in my opinion. Good job by Magic Hat."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a very dark color, but not quite black as night as the name would suggest. Had a nice off-white head that dissipated slowly. Smell was of dark roasted malt and very pleasant. Taste was good and much like aroma and I enjoyed it. Mouthfeel was just a tad thin in my opinion. Still I enjoyed this very sessionable beer and would drink again."
"O: Not a bad black lager. On par with some of the other darker brews from Magic Hat. Willing to buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In spite of the subtitled name, Howl isn't quite a ""black as night lager."" Dark brown to black with ruby highlights around the edge that were apparent while pouring. Tan head bubbles up nicely, but dissipates quickly. In spite of being a winter lager, it seems a bit musty in the nose. Some nice roast malt, mineral, light off spice. Roast continues in the mouth, but lacks depth or a layered dimension to the taste and is a bit light and tasteless off the back. Not bad, but not one I would seek out as definitive for the style."
""
""
""
""
"D: This beer was a pleasant surprise for me. It's light in flavor, but still develops plenty of tasty roasty character. A good introduction to the style, especially for people who have a fixed conception of dark beers as ""heavy."""
""
"Overall I gave the beer a 3.5 because the lack of foam, plus it was terribly sweet and not complex in taste. I expect more from something marked seasonal. It is a drinkable beer. I could drink these in lieu of the dessert course after a dinner."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium-to-heavy bodied with high carbonation. Overall, not too bad, not too impressive, but it will do."
"O - This is the first Schwarzbier that I can remember trying, and I found it to be pretty solid. The balance of hops and roasty malts, in combination with plentiful carbonation and a lighter body, make this a tasty and very drinkable brew. I've been in the mood for some lighter, more sessionable beers lately, and this one certainly satisfies."
""
"Poured into my Moncshof schwarzbier pokal a deep chocolate color with a ruby tinge,a thinner but well sustained light tan colored head atop.Chocolate aromas really stand out with a roast uderneath.Earthy and dry on the palate with some roasted coffee notes intertwined with unsweetened chocolate,again not much sweetness to be had here.Much dryer and more earthy than most I have had of the style but I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this one is very drinkable. The taste isn't amazing but its a nice beer to enjoy without any off-putting flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a pretty good brew."
""
"Not as black as the bottle claims, but it is still a bit darker than some black lagers. Light tan head that fizzles to 1/8", plenty of carbonation. Deep red hues. Some coffee, a bit of vanilla on the nose and a hint of smoke. Grainy, smokey metallic taste; woody charcoal, toffee, coffee - all really interesting."
""
""
"O- This is a nice, drinkable beer, not mindblowing, but easy to drink. I can have a few of these no problem. A find this to be a good example of this style, I've definitely had worse schwarzbiers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish black body and a thick beige head. Clean lager yeast smell. Faint chocolate and metal. Light herb and flower. Smoked malt surprises you. Burnt toast. Very subtle chocolate. Faint hop flavor in there too. Well carbonated. Somewhat dry. Complex. Interesting. But I kind of like this style being smooth. Have more of a chocolate feel to it. A bit too coarse for me."
""
"This is a solid beer. It's definitely one of the better offerings from Magic Hat. I have this beer every winter."
"O-it's ok, just not memorable, which I should have remembered from when I had it before"
""
""
"not bad at all but not as hi -end as I expected...."
""
""
""
"Pretty nice schwarzbier here. Complex and balanced flavors, smooth to drink, and at only 4.6% ABV, it's nice to have a few on a long winter's night. The best thing I've had from Magic Hat."
"O- Solid black lager, certainly enjoyable."
""
""
"Poured this Schwarzbier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a black color, produced a nice tan head, decent retention and nice lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma had hints of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Medium in body the beer had a nice roasted malt backbone, with flavors of chocolate and coffee shining through. There is a a bit of a bitter hop bite at the end, very impressive beer. This would make a great winter session beer. Hats off to Magic Hat on this one! Prost!"
""
"O- Not a bad beer. Drinkable but nothing over complex about it. It's just simple. A nice change from the bigger, heavier complex beers."
"Toasty roasty malt notes up front. Light metallic twang. Dark chocolate and coffee bitterness sits over faintly sweet vinous malts. Hops become woodier and slightly tannic. Roasty, dry finish. Moderate body. Pretty tasty and sessionable to boot!"
""
"Overall a decent light bodied dark brew with a nice milky feel to."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark black color. Didn't get much when I smelled it. The beer is lighter in body than it looks, which is typical of this style. This dark beer is actually very smooth and drinkable. The taste is good. There is a malty taste with a hint of chocolate or coffee and maybe a hint of hops in there. Overall, this might be the best I have had in this style. I have only had a few, but they have all been good, so that actually is a good thing. I recommend giving it a try, though you might want to avoid the variety pack and get just a 6-pack of this."
""
""
"O-Overall I enjoyed the beer. After drinking about half a glass I became accustomed to the smokey flavor. It is complemented quite well with the roasty/spicy finish."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I haven't had many Magic Hat offerings in many years and this is not bad at all. I'm also not really one for lagers and this is a good change of pace for me. I would recommend this especially if looking for a beer with alot of flavor and low abv."
""
"O/D-Better than I was expecting. A pretty good glass. Magic Hat will come up and surprise you every-so-often. Hard to find fault with this one."
"D/O: A surprisingly enjoyable beer. When I hear ""Magic Hat"" and ""Lager", my expectations are immediately lowered. But this far-and-away surpassed that. A very drinkable beer, and overall, a treat. I look forward to my next one."
""
"One of my favorite styles, and this one doesn't disappoint. I went into this beer with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised."
"a solid black lager. reminds me of Full Sail's Session Black Lager and brings back fond memories of Buzzards Bay Black Lager (though not nearly as delicious IMO)."
""
""
"Not bad; good sessionable beer"
""
""
"My first sip was a huge surprise, it didn't suck. Not only that but it was an excellent beer, I sucked down that six pack in no time."
""
""
""
"This is another black lager I've enjoyed and now I can say that the only Magic Hat beer I've had is one I've enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
"Give this beer a try, I doubt you'll have any regrets."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good and solid Schwarzbier that managed to stick out from the crowd with some added nutty flavors and aromas that made it one of the more complex Schwarzbier's I have had to date. This beer has good drinkability, it has enough flavor to hold my attention, while going down very smooth and not being too filling, if I had another one I would drink it, I could maybe do four of these in a session without getting bored with it. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, all aspects of this beer seemed to be right where they should be. There wasn't anything about this beer that I didn't like or would change, this beer doesn't need to messed with. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice and sessionable Black Lager, this makes for a good darker beer to have with dinner and it paired nicely with a bowl of chili. I recommend giving this beer a try, the extra nutty flavors make this not your average Black Lager. I was impressed by this beer, I don't have the best history with Magic Hat beers, but this proved to be one solid Schwarzbier that proved to be pretty unique with the added nutty flavors, I know this beer isn't a traditional take on this style, but it comes together nicely and tastes good so I'm not holding that against them. IF you are leery about giving Magic Hat another try, man up and try this beer, it might change your mind about this brewery. This isn't my favorite Schwarzbier but it is one of the better and more unique ones that I have had."

"Not black as night but pretty close and near opaque which is quite a feat for a beer as clear as this. Smell is luscious with roasted grains, cocoa, coffee, burnt caramel and English style hops. Earthy and mild. A gentle fruitiness flows through. Taste is more of the same with a big charcoal bitterness. Dark roasted malt and smokey grains in the front with some mild sweetness. A touch of soap in the finish before more char and leafy hops and hop oiliness. Nice chewy feel that does not impede drinkability with an active carbonation. A very nice winter session ale that is begging for big smokey meats and cheeses."
""
""
""
"Smells like it taste...delicious. If you like coffee/chocolate malty beers this is for you. Smells like chocolate but taste more like coffee with a slight, and I do mean slight, hint of bitterness at the end. An all around good beer especially during those colder seasons or after dinner when you just want a drink instead of dessert."
""
"O - Nice beer. I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Black Lagers."
""
""
""
"VERY GOOD, GIVE IT A GO!"
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark ruby color in a pint glass, this beer really has a forward coffee aroma with some caramel in the nose as well. Taste is balanced but I personally feel like coffee comes to the forefront. Not as aggressive as Sam Adams black and brew as previously mentioned, the coffee is there but also some nice burnt malt finished by a nice slight bitterness. Delicious, very sessionable brew. The mouthfeel is on par with other Schwarzbiers, not thick like a stout, much thinner. Would drink this again, I enjoyed it very much."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: decent for the style, however this is a ""meal"" beer, too heavy for me and with the low ABV, I was confused why it felt as heavy as it did"
""
"Overall I liked this. I have been on a Black IPA search lately so it was nice to have this ""Black as night Lager"". Not an IPA or even an Ale but a tasty brew. Blows Guinness Black Lager out of the water. Thanks to SMason for this extra."
"Pours a very deep shade of brown with large frothy beige/tan head. Head sadly reduces quickly though. Aroma of spiced coffee and Chocolate. Taste is Coffee and hops, perfectly balanced. Good feel on the tounge, warming and welcome."
""
""
"Its light and drinkable, slightly over carbonated, but a tastey brew."
""
"O: A solid schwarzbier that could stand in for a porter or stout on a cold night. Easily sessionable at 4.6% too"
""
""
"O: good."
""
"O. Overall this is not bad at all. One Of the better offerings from Magic Hat."
""
""
""
"A very drinkable beer. This is one of those where you want to have plenty on hand before you open the first bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty good. Appearance left something to be desired, but it tasted good and had a great mouthfeel."
""
""
"Poured into a 13oz tulip glass. Pours a thin looking black, with one inch light tan head, minimal lace. Smell some dark malts, chocolate, hints of coffee, some piney hops, and a little biscuit. Taste is exactly like it's smells. Plenty of flavor for it's small abv, makes it's sessionable. Body is small for a winter beer, enough carbonation, and very easygoing down. Not what I was expecting this time of year, but no regrets."
""
""
"O - I was skeptical from the aroma, but the flavor blew me away."
""
"O: I get a lot of coffee notes from this beer. Odd to me for a Schwarzbier. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I have not had too many Magic Hat beers that I like, but this one is something I would buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall, This isn't bad, but it just feels too watery. The slight smokey flavor is a nice finishing touch to the burnt, bitter chocolate, but I'm glad i bought only one bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Appearance is a let down. Smell is wonderfully rich and makes me want to indulge in a sip. I love beers with an earthly scent. Taste is pretty good. This is my first time having it out of a glass. I have had this before and enjoyed it more out of the bottle. odd. Despite the look and flavor it does not sit too overly heavy. Goes down easily. I would get this again."

"A black beer with a thin head that dissipates rapidly. Smells like black rye bread and chocolatey. Roasted malt taste and a light body. Aftertaste lingers, chocolate and roasted malt coats the tongue. Stings the palette a little bit. Easy to drink. Overall a good beer, not disappointed."
""
"I would recommend this if you are a fan of porters."
"o - Overall a decent schwarzbier; had this right after the Guinness black lager and this was very slightly better. Worth checking out, would probably have it again."
""
"pours pretty dark, but not black, more a very deep brown. Head retention has been amazing. Smells heavily of charcoal, leather and bitter coffee. Not the most appetizing of scents. Medium to light in body with some toffee caramel and chocolate tastes present but coffee flavor dominates the beer once it finishes. I don't know what to pin point about the beer exactly that I don't like, but im not liking. It might be the flavors, possibly if they were a bit subdued it'd be alright but the flavors present in this beer aren't the flavors I wanna be punched in the face with."
""
"This is like most Shwarzbiers I've had... but probably on the good end of them. It had a nice rich color, dark, and a nice head. Creamy bodied with just enough carbonation. It smelled nice, toasty and caramelized. Taste was similar. Sweet and a little bitter coffee-like. Overall, this is just good. Great in the winter."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: After having some magic hat brews in the past, I've don't think I've ever been more then ""eh"" with them. This is is great, but the body might be a little too heavy for the style (but I don't mind one bit.). I really lucked out for this one, it was just being put up on the shelf when I got it, and it is perfect for this deep fall very early winter time. Magic hat impressed me with this one, tons of flavor and you'll be able to drink a couple no problem. You've got to give this one a shot."
""
"Poured a 1"" light mocha head with moderate life. Dark burnt umber brown color, black enough. Smell is very mild, just a little roasted malt. Taste is like a very weak porter: roasted malt, coffee, chocolate. Body is quite light, I'd even call it watery. To me this is OK but it's not a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Although this is a little sweet for the style, I really enjoyed the balance in this beer and it is one of the few beers from this brewery that I would seek out again"
""
""
""
"Pours out jet black, one finger tan head that fizzled out into nothing in less than a minute, body is somewhat thin and watery, smells of roasted malt notes first and foremost, mild weak bitter chocolate tones and that's really all I get out of this one...tastes of mild roasted malt tempered with a finish of spiced hop tones, overall I just wish the body was a bit more robust on this one for my taste...it comes across as only a forgettably average schwarzbier, there are worse and there are better brews than this one."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Klokke Roeland globe, coffee brown and nearly opaque with a pinky-finger of tannish head that receded to a patchy layer; small blotches of lacing here and there. Light aroma of dark roasted malts and grains. A little on the metallic side. Up front, the taste is a mixture of sweet molasses and roasted malts, turning mid-palate to a bitter coffee with lots of graininess, and a bit of smoke. Medium mouthfeel, and quite dry. Nothing great, but not too bad overall."
""
""
""
""
"O- Complex and flavorful, this is a great fall session beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is decent, but there isn't much lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and a bit of nuts. The brew tastes like roasted/burnt malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Maybe I started drinking this a bit too cold, as it tasted better the warmer it got. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and has good carbonation. I liked this brew, it was better than I was expecting it to be. Pretty decent for $1.79 a single bottle. Worth a try, and I'd buy this again."
"I was very surprised with this beer since I don't always enjoy magic hat but they must have used a different yeast on this beer. Overall I wish they sold this by itself."
"O- A well balanced and sufficiently unique beer. If you're looking for something dark and you don't plan on drinking more than one or two this is a great choice. I could imagine pairing this with a savory winter stew or chili and being delighted by the complimentary flavors."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - A decent offering for a lighter winter option. A bit hard to swallow because of the carbonation despite its light body."
"O: A pretty solid American rendition of a classic style if you ask me. I know Magic Hat gets a bumb wrap from the craft brew ""crowd""...but for a 4.6% brew, this thing packs some roast and smoke flavors. I will session with this every year if it's made available...and so far, it's been two years in a row. Rock on howlers!!!"
"This does not make up for the fact that they killed of Heart Of Darkness a while back but I'll take this for now. Damn good stuff here."
"Overall this is a a decent, if average Schwarzbier. Slightly hoppier and more ""American"" in the flavor than other more treaditional German examples, but a decent take on the style. Nothing to seek out and definitely not a must try but decent enough if it's all you find in your friends fridge during a holiday party."
"I really like this beer. It's light yet dark and flavorful. One of the better schwartzbiers I've enjoyed."
"I was recommended by two people to try this. Something finally worth trying from Magic Hat. As of late, they really have been putting out some mediocre brews, except for this dark lager. Even if you feel you have been screwed over by Magic Hat and turned your back away from them; give this beer a try. It reminds me of a porter but not bitter."
"O- A good schwarzbier. One of Magic Hat's better offerings."
"Pours a nearly black chestnut color with a head that initially crests the top of my glass before settling to a fluffy cap. Mild roasted malt aroma with some lager yeast and a clean sweetness. Smooth, mellow malty lager flavor. Nutty with a bit of dark bread, but very simple and clean. Light bodied. A decent, inoffensive stab at the style..."
"Once again Magic Hat makes a beer that gets close but fails before the finish."
"Overall: This is the first Schwarzbier that I've had, and I do like the style! You wouldn't expect such a dark beer to have both flavor and easy drink-ability. It's like the best of both worlds. I would definitely pick it up this winter if you get the chance!"
"Reviewed from notes. In deed, poured black as night with the smell of malt poured into a pint glass. Taste of malt with a slight coffee after taste before finishing clean. This reminded me of a bock really, bought this along with the more common #9 from Magic Hat in order to try two different styles from the same company in one night at a recent gathering w/friends."
"Got to have this up at the brewery before it was even released a few years ago. Kind of exciting I thought. The beer poured out really dark even for being a sampling glass. The light that could get through just gave off a red hue inside the glass. The head was thin but has a light brown color to it. The smell of the beer was a lot like a German Lager with some roasted malts and chocolate in the mix. The taste of the beer gave off a lot of chocolate and dark malt flavors, it had a good bitterness to it as well. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side which I thought was impressive. Overall this beer isn't bad, I got to have it again from the bottle and it was still pretty good."
"The taste is malty up front, but quickly fades to a sweet caramel that lingers after each sip."
"easy to drink, decent flavor and it goes down fairly easily. I just probably wouldn't go for more than a few."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with light carbonation and a medium to heavy body. Medium drinkabiity, as with most winter warmer types, but a very good beer overall."
"The nose is mineral-y and herbal, with just undertones of malt and roast. The flavor delivers a bit more malt and roast, in the form of some burnt toast notes. Mineral and herbal notes border on metallic, but stop short of unpleasantry. There is some unsweet cocoa or chicory astringency that develops, but overall the brew mostly stands out as moderately refereshing and easily drinkable."
"Slightly bitter and well balanced.Black body with quick dissipitating foamy head. Mild roasty aroma. Carbonation is right there and it is appropriate. Decent roastiness, mild coffee. minimal alcohol, this sessionability is appreciated."
"O: Given its low alcohol content, this beer is very sessionable and packs in a lot of flavor."
"When i poured this into a pint glass it was dark as night with a one finger white head to it. The nose picks up a little chocolate and some coffee notes. The taste is of roasted malts and some toffee and just a little bitter on the back of the tongue. This beer has a smooth mouth feel and overall is a good beer."
"Overall, this beer is a bit too much for me to drink regularly. It's not bad, but I'll pass next time."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic, pour was midnight black with a slight white head. The aroma was full of coffe and chocolate. The flavor was full of light roasted coffee and light chocolate, dry finish. The body is light, well carbonateed. A nice black lager."
"a nice amber brownish murky pour with a off white head that has some consistency but you can tell is a lager. nose is toasty and chocolate. the palate sit in the realm but doesn't have a dense one dimensional quality to it. is actually somewhat broad. some apple and toasted malt and chocolate. a bit of a grit mineral of chalk. but the carbonation is good and the beer is a proper form from being to end."
"Ok beer, fairly bland. Carbonation is a bit high for style and a little biting."
"Goes down pretty smooth and for a stout you can drink a good amount of these."
"Poured from growler from consumers beverages into pint glass nice half inch head. Appetizing black red. Slight malty smell. The taste of chocolate is much stronger than the smell. excellent chocolate malt to go with the contrast of a lighter lager mouthfeel. A very new easy drinking smooth feel for so much flavor. I enjoyed this alot."
"Magic Hat is a session brew due to its lower ABV and less filling lighter/mellow flavor - a little thinner than I expected."
"Magic Hat Howl is a nearly opaque dark brown lager with a thin, beige film that leaves good lacing. It appears to have some particles in it. Chocolate and roast are prominent in the aroma, with a hint of vanilla and sweetness. It's medium, maybe medium-light, bodied and smooth. The finish is quick, light and dry. It has a simple, almost delicate, flavor. It tastes just like the aroma: chocolate and roast. The very light bitterness at the finish is wooden and herbal. It's very smooth and drinkable."
"Pours dark brown with almost no head. Slight lacing left on the glass. Coffee and roasted malt aroma with no distinctive hop present. Fairly low bitterness for a dark beer. Light body. I'd prefer this in summer. Flashiness lingers in the finish. Fairly average beer."
"D = The dark color is deceiving, this beer is much lighter in flavor than its appearance might suggest. The smells of chocolate and the hint of coffee add to the mystery of this light dark beer. I certianly enjoyed my first Howl and it helped me warm up after an afternoon out in the snow."
"I'm a fan of Magic Hat and enjoyed this beer, I hope it stays a winter seasonal brew."
"D- Good drinkability. Goes down smooth, nothing offensive about it, but nothing great about it either. For the price i got this at, i will probably go pick up another two, but for full price i would probably pass."
"Overall i really was surprised and enjoyed this beer, not the best beer ive ever had, however i enjoyed the contrast between howl and #9. With some wintery mix falling outside this was a nice warm rich beer for a cold evening."
"Will definitey be looking out for this seasonal offering next fall."
"This has an attractive reddish copper color, clear but pretty dark. The head is solid in stature and a light oatmeal color with fair lacing. The aroma offers malt licorice and hints of blackberry chocolate. Firm and quite pleasant. The flavor brings more of the charcoal and light chocolate with a coffee/grass hop bite that ends dry to the tongue. A bit chalky and slightly aqueous though closer to a medium body brew. Heartily carbonated, maybe a bit much. Very drinkable. Very interesting and perfectly enjoyable by my tastes. Not sure if this is quite like other Schwarzbiers I've had, sort of half stout and half porter, but it's something I would happily drink again."
"Overall I was quite pleased with this beer and found it enjoyable. This is a perfect beer to drink during the winter time and during the times where you just want to relax and have a beer in the cold weather."
"D: My first ""shwarzbier"". Very interesting I need to explore the style more."
"D- a little too full bodied to drink several of, but for a good stand alone beer this one is solid."
"Quite surprised with how much I enjoyed this and how much it strayed from what I've come to recognize as a Magic Hat offering."
"Aroma is mostly roasted malts, taste has the same sort of taste, plus a bit of caramel-like sweetness, small amount of hops. Smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Highly drinkable and only 4.6% abv, not bad. Compared to a German Schwarzbier this probably is worse, but there aren't many competitors in this genre. I'd try it again."
"I can't say that I have encountered a lot of schwarzbiers over the years, but I like this one. It's not something to write home about, but it is very good."
"Dark toasted malt mellows to burnt embers first and foremost. There are some dry hoppy tones lingering in the background but they are as elusive as ghosts when you try to pin them down. A little more carbonation than is necessary keeps this from being a real good black lager. Drinkable but not outstanding."
"Another very good schwarzbier. I love this style, and this one seems like a very good interpretation. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Pours dark black with wisps of white foam on tap. Slight roasted barley smell, but otherwise very faint. Smooth roasted taste, like a light stout. Some coffee notes. Very thin mouthfeel, more smooth than anything. Quite drinkable, lots of flavor, could be sessioned."
"D - All night drinkability. Has a really nice flavor and lower alcohol content that makes this beer one that can be enjoyed all night. I'm impressed."
"Drinkability is sub-par. Getting down a glass wouldn't be tough, but it would be boring. Not much going on here. I wish Magic Hat would focus more on brewing than on advertising."
"Saw this at the store and figured I'd give it a try. This beer was just plain weird to me. It almost had a taste like artificial ingredients or some sort of flavoring was added. For lack of a better term, it taste like it was over processed if you can even say that about beer. Pours dark and looks great. But drinking it makes me want to howl for my money back. I had several other beers from this brewer in a 12 pack sampler-offering. None of them impressed me nor will I waste my time rating them. I know I won't be trying anything else from this group for a while."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Pours a deep black color with a tall, small bubbly head. Aroma has a clean lager smell with notes of chocolate malt and a deep toasted and roasted malt presence. Flavor has an early dark roasted bite moving into a lightly sweet chocolate malt followed by a very nice coffee smoothness and finishes with full combo of roasted and toasted malt notes. Body is moderate with a creamy feeling. This brew wasn't anything special when it was cold but as it warmed up, the deep roasted and toasted malt notes really brings about a barrage of flavors that really do work well together. Going against the grain on this one and don't think this brew reflects the high rankings as portrayed."
"This was my first magic hat beer in almost 3 years. I probably won't have another for at least that long."
"Highly drinkable and for a reasonable price. I enjoy this beer over their #9 during the winter months, but it's not the best winter warmer I've had. I would have enjoyed the infusion of some spice, as it is their ""winter release," but it's a well structured beer even without."
"D: Easy to drink - glad I have a case. I will polish this one off in the next few weeks."
"Very well done."
"Over all I enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, the pleasant flavors outweighed the bizarre body (which eventually balanced itself out) making this a nice light beer. I have been skeptical of Magic Hat, but maybe this will push me a bit to try some other beers that they offer."
"The beer had a lighter feel to it. The beer is smooth and very easy to drink, maybe the best quality of the beer, which made the beer very enjoyable."
"Black-as-Night...Hell to the YEAH! This beer is so black it could be Navy! Does Schwarzbier equal eight parts water, one part alcohol and one part coffee??? This beer, although tasty in a pinch, reminds me of stouts that several fledgling breweries make. There is coffee scents and taste....but not over powering. The low alcohol content makes this an easy session beer. After the pour a nice head forms on this beer and keeps throughout the salutation. Not the best....not the worst....ENJOY!"
"D: Very. Enjoyed this immensely."
"D--Pretty good, but not exceptional. I could see my girlfriend drinking a lot of these (huge stout fan), but I'm just not that big a fan of the style. It's a good-to-above good stout. I would recommend it if you can get it/like the style."
"d: I need more Schwarzbier in my life. Very complex for such a sessionable beer."
"D- A very good, accessible beer. Very easy to drink and can give the recognizable name to others"
"3.5 D: Schwarzbiers are a bit of a sleeper style for me. I never think about them, but generally like them a lot. This one isn't one that I'd want to drink many of, but this one bottle was a good enough experience."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Very smooth and crisp even with some pretty heavy flavors. The carbonation and dry finish also keep the beer very crisp and refreshing."
"D: It's a pretty decent beer, but the medicinal taste is throwing me off. Its light feeling body and deep roasty taste make it drinkable. I will certainly finish my six pack, but i don't intend to seek this beer out."
"All in all I would deem it super drinkable. The taste is staying pleasant from beginning to end. I would definitely have another."
"drinkability: the lighter aspects and the maltiness go well together in this one, definitely worth a try for the holiday season."
"Pretty on par with the style, which is a style that we dig and is rarely explored by Ameri- can brewers. Get some before the season is over and check out the cool micro-site."
"Overall - A decent effort from Magic Hat and most parts of this beer seem to work, but the smell alone keeps me from wanting to return to this beer."
"D - this would be a good opener in a winter beer session. Not heavy, easily drinkable, and doesn't kill your taste buds all while getting the job done. I'm not a big fan of magic hat but I must admit they did this one really well and it's worth buying a six."
"~Adam"
"D- Delicious"
"Pours a very dark brick-red, when held to the light. A light tan, microbubbled head sorta patches to the glass. Smell is a bit of roasted malts and mineral. Taste is pretty mild, but decent. Some lightly roasted malt and cacao mingles with some mild hops. Finish is very dark chocolate-like, dark and mildly bitter. Feels a bit modest, but it suffices for the style. Drinkability good. A fine winter release."
"D - This is kind of like an espresso in a beer glass, just not as strong; definitely unique and worth a try if you're interested in trying something new; I could have a few more of these; great seasonal beer by Magic Hat, I enjoyed it"
"Pours dark brown with a good head and a nice cap and collar on the way down. The nose is faint roast and a good amount of coffee. The taste is similar, though the coffee forces through a bit of added bitterness. The feel is quite light without too much roasted character. Overall, this drinks fairly well and is quite impressive coming from Magic Hat."
"D/M: intense carbonation tingle, drinks heavy but is smooth on the pallet, lack of good taste hurts drinkability"
"Recommended."
"Has a bit of malty but fresh scent, a little underwhelming, personally. The taste is very strong roasted malt with spices. The mouth feel is very surprising - both smoky and fresh at the same time. Overall, a very nice, very dark, lager."
"D - It's very refreshing and PERFECT for the beer drinker who wants the taste of stout but without all the strong characteristics of a stout."
"In my world anything without overpowering hops needs vanilla, chocolate or coffee notes, and this lager delivers!"
"Decently drinkable. Everything seemed to good but there was not much flavor."
"Not something worth trying, but if you're at dinner and in a pinch like me its ok."
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle a cola colored dark brown/black with a foamy, light tan 2 finger head. Can't see how much, if any, carbonation is going on in the inky darkness. Aroma is of licorice, dark unsweetened chocolate, and a hint of coffee and smoke. It's a pleasant, sweet malty aroma. The sweetness disappears on the first sip, it's unsweetened chocolate again, with a hint of coffee (black...no cream or sugar). Those bitter flavors are joined by a hint of hops on the swallow. There is a lively sparkle on the swallow from the carbonation. Drinkability is good...I could down a couple of these pretty easily, but i'd stop short of making it a session beer. Good stuff."
"Drinkability - After the first sip I wasn't sure about this beer. However, the longer I pondered it, I started to enjoy it more and more. It's a bit different for sure, but that can be ok. It goes down relatively easy and doesn't over fill you. Worth a try, just for the experience."
"D: Quite drinkable for a dark sweet beer. Not very alcoholic either. Interesting and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Another solid offering from Magic Hat. They tend to put out well balanced, middle of the road beers and this is no exception. Picked up a 12 pack for a recent get together and glad to have some left over."
"Strolling the supermarket isle and I see a new winter seasonal I haven't tried yet. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top gives me a nice waft of cocoa and roasted malts. Pouring into a tall glass I get a very dark opaque brew with a tan multi-size bubble head. The taste is a very mellow roasted flavor with hints of cocoa and a touch of bitterness but very faint. The flavor is very bold but yet light and refreshing. The roasted malts are prevalent throughout the taste and linger into the finish which is cocoa laden and rich. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and the carbonation is just right. This is and extremely drinkable brew for the flavors it brings and a 4.6% ABV. I could drink this all day long. Right on target for style, a fine selection."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Moderately thick taste combined with carbonation and roasty character.. I could enjoy this very much all winter."
"D: Really drinkable. Wish I had bough a few more of these. A pretty good winter seasonal brew for this style."
"D- It's a really good drinker. I've been disappointed in by the style in the past. This is flavorful, without being overwhelming. It stays refreshing. It's a sessionable winter seasonal. It's good to see more breweries putting out winter stuff that can be consumed in decent quantities."
"D: Not a bad winter brew, nothing too exciting, lacking a bit, but all in all enjoyable."
"I will very likely be seeking out a sixer of the Magic Hat Howl in the near future."
"Very well carbonated and a slightly thin mouthfeel (which is appropriate for this beer). Nice crisp beer. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I didn't necessarily expect it, but thought this was a very good beer."
"D: A very drinkable winter seasonal beer. A nice variation of the style. The low levels of alcohol make it a beer that you could have a few of and not be too buzz to actually enjoy the flavors."
"Nice carbonation not too thin and not syrupy either. Went down easy."
"D - Not bad at all. Smooth, filling, I'd have another."
"D: Immensely drinkable. Indeed, I cannot hardly imagine a beer more so. Still, although it's very good, it will never approach transcendence; that is, it will never be more than ""a damn good beer."" The best schwarzbier I've ever had. Absolutely recommended."
"The texture is nice, it is velvety and smooth, and the appearance is nearly black and appealing."
"D: This is a good alternative to other winter beers. I could drink a few of these. Much higher than what magic hat normally puts out."
"Bottle poured into mug. Didn't know what I was getting into, I don't like black beers. Just saw winter seasonal and snagged it. Poured black with 1/2in light brown head. Smells alright, but the coffee taste just doesn't sit well with me. Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. For folks who enjoy this kind of beer I would recommend it, but I don't think I will be having another."
"D - I'm a fan of the Schwarzbier style, and this one did not disappoint. I could easily stock a sixer of this in the fridge and drink it all day. I don't think it would get old. Kudos to Magic Hat for a finely crafted beer."
"D-Good fit in the winter mix, good for a cold night."
"a very smooth magic hat brew. not as extreme as an ipa or as sweet as say the #9, but this beer is quite good. a very smooth lager which is not typical of magic hat, but it is very good and i enjoyed it. i got it at a local pud and enjoyed it there i really like magic hat."
"Served: December 6, 2010"
"all around a good beer and really the only magic hat beer i really like."
"D- Not to bad at all. Pretty easy to drink. A pretty simple beer."
"I enjoyed this would get it again!"
"D: Very drinkable one of Magic Hat's best."
"Easy drinking and a good example of the style but lacking in the aroma department."
"Enjoy, Cheers!"
"MF&D - Overall not a bad beer. I got much tastier and more pronounced as it warmed. Worth a try."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its complex aroma and the clean follow through of the taste (with a great label to boot!). The apparent exhibition of grape in the nose and heavy barley in the taste make for a unique winter seasonal."
"D: Very drinkable, this has consistently been a ""go-to"" beer for my winter season. I look forward to it coming out each year."
"Drinkabilty was very good-This is one of the easiest brews to drink I have ever had - I would definitely recommend this and will be headed to the store to find some more before it's season is over."
"The roasted characters come out more in the taste, supported by the strong presence of bitter coffee. There is a little bit of chocolate in there, but it struggles to compete with the roasted malt/coffee. There is also a smokiness which is pretty pleasant, probably my favorite part of the experience. Howl finishes pretty dry, as the bitter coffee lingers into a mildly dry, leafy hop finish. I enjoyed the smokiness of this Schwarzbier, but I feel like the roasted flavors overpower some of the more subtle qualities. Overall, it has decent drinkability, but I don't know if I care for it enough to try it again anytime soon."
"D/M: A very big flavored beer that coats the palate but the beer is not strong. I can't complain because its very well done, but I wanted a higher alcohol content to give me more of that warming sensation I was looking for."
"D - goes down easy."
"This beer is not exceptionally thick, but the creamy head is what makes it go down so smooth, I could have easily downed the entire 6 pack in 1 sitting it was so drinkable."
"Certainly a nice beer that fits the style. From a bottle, it poured a nice tall light brown head that persisted some time. It was dark cola in color. The aroma was dominated by dark grains giving it a coffee and low chocolate nose. No hop aroma in this beer. It was well balanced with just enough bitterness to offset the malty backbone but certainly weighted toward the malt. Finished dry and was well carbonated. Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable schwarzbier. I'd like another please."
"I was hesitant to buy this one because there was not any kind of description on the box or the bottle. All I knew was that it was a winter lager, and the boyfriend decided on it. Glad he did--definitely worth it."
"dark brown cola color that has a strong coffee or even chocolate smell with the same flavor of chocolate coffee and toffee. this beer has good carbonation and medium to good lacing and retention. This beer has quite a bitter after taste that stays on the palate. Definitely not a fast drinking beer. Not a big blackbeer fan and would not buy it again but I could drink another one."
"Comes out of the tap a deep opaque chocolaty sable with a fine-bubbled tan head that leaves some decent lacing. Aroma is rich and mainly of quality coffee with hints of molasses and unsweet chocolate. Rich, smoky coffee flavor has hints of chocolate, wood and toffee. Lively, fizzy texture leaves a nice tingle and hints of good mocha."
"This is a solid winter seasonal. It's a great brew."
"d- really enjoyable beer, loved the look, and is easier to drink than many heavily malt roasted porters. Usually not a huge Magic Hat drinker but this is one I'll come back to."
"Added 20 October 2011- I've compared this to the new Guinness Black Lager and hands-down prefer the latter. But this Howl is still a very nice offering."
"D- howl has many attributes you look for in this season. The dark flavor is soothing and engaging at the same time. You will be successful in putting these down"
"More chocolate, minor coffee note noted, dark grains, moderate sweetness. On the lighter side bodywise. Nothing special, respectable dark lager, easy drinker. Nice long finish, with lingering coffee grains and lightly bitter chocolate. More slightly better then middle of the road beer from hit or miss Magic Hat."
"Poured into a perfect pint glass straight from the bottle. A dark coca-cola like color with little bubbles. Some hints on coffee grinds and chocolate. Very little hop character, but true to the schwarzbier style. Not great head retention as expected, but not terrible either. At 4.6 abv, it is could be a decent session brew, however, it feels a bit on the heavier side on the way down."
"D: Very high for a beer that tastes this much like coffee, the sweetness and lower ABV make this an interesting concoction."
"D - Very very drinkable. A joy to drink, with a great flavor and nice palate."
"Far more hop than the smell would suggest. The malt is also more toasted and biting. The brew is a bit watery with a decent amount of carbonation which doesn't help. Not a timid beer, it certainly has a strong flavor profile."
"This is more of a watery stout. Not particularly pleasant but might be a thirst quencher."
"Overall: I agree with most a damn good beer. What a find! This is why I love the world of beers. You can walk into a supermarket, try sometning and discover a taste you never had before."
"Exceptional."
"Pleasant roasty flavor, again more coffee and dark chocolate, slightly creamy. Body was a bit thin with lower carbonation. Roasted barley and husky grain in the background, some low level bitterness also. Overall not a bad Schwarzbier, a style I usually look for fresh on tap at local brewpubs."
"The appearance is dark brown with a medium head. The smell is a little off with a tiny bit of funk to go along with roasted malt, coffee, and molasses. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is average for the style. Overall this is a strange beer that grows on you as it warms."
"I do not like #9. In fact, I have taken it back to the store with the assumption that I had a skunked pack. I realize now how ridiculous that sounds. This was smokier than I expected. It had the winter seasonal taste that I was expecting, without the spicy sweetness of some Christmas style ales. I would be interested in picking this one up on a build your own six pack."
"D- Fairly drinkable. I had it ice cold like most lagers, but I'd be interested to try it at a warmer temperature to see what flavors come out."
"D- Very drinkable, especially for coffee lovers. Mild but distinct coffee tones reign throughout. This is distinct because this isn't a porter. Very well balanced. Dark and dreamy beer."
"D- This was a fine winter lager. Nothing over the top with flavor but it does the job. The lower ABV makes this more of a sessionable beer for those long winter nights."
"D: I like my beer a bit hoppier then this, with that being said, I could slam a six pack around a campfire any day."
"Near black pour with mahogany highlights at the edges of the glass and a small, dense, tan head. The aroma is very modest with light notes of roast, very soft spice, fresh bread and a distinct noble hop twang. The flavor is also very gentle with a fair amount of roast, a little cocoa and soft spice and finishing clean with a mild noble hop bite. Medium, creamy body with soft but plentiful carbonation."
"D - A very good session beer."
"Taste is pretty much similar to the aroma in that it's primarily roasted malt, has that tinge of metal which I'm not a fan of, carbonation is good for the style although maybe a bit too lively, slight burnt malt in the aftertaste, the bitterness isn't really from any hop presence (which is lacking) but from the burnt malt."
"And I have downed more than a few of these on occasion and with no shame I can tell you that they go down real easy. You can put down 3 or 4 before you even know it. Good wintertime drinking beer."
"d: Could easily put a few back on a cold night. Has a very warm feel and flavor. Just an underwhelming nose."
"D - I usually go for stouts but this dark lager is quite drinkable."
"Good brew! I'm not a huge fan of the style but I found this to be very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Very drinkable beer, a very nice seasonal Schwarzbier."
"Notes: Nice beer for a cold day when you want a full flavored beer but something lighter then a stout."
"I really enjoyed this beer and would def buy again...A very nice light alternative to a porter with alot of the same flavor characteristics..."
"The fullness of the grain coats the palate followed by the slight sweetness, then finnishing dry with a slight bitterness. This has balance and complexity - quite delightful."
"[edit] - Tried my second one right from the bottle and the taste came across much better"
"Sampled and brought home growler from Magic Hat. Very dark brown with small head and good carbonation. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee and nuts. Light body but very smooth. Super drinkable. This was my 2nd favorite of the 12 or so beers on tap at Magic Hat. Very enjoyable."
"I need to remind myself not to pick this one up again. The fact that it finishes on such a strong note may leave me with the impression that it was a good beer, but the majority of the flavor is really off putting. It's sad, but my last few Magic Hat beers have really let me down."
"D - I will have to get this again this fall. A very solid brew."
"Decent."
"The body is medium but seems to lack punch. It seems a little flat and could use a bit more liveliness. It's solid, but slightly lacking."
"D- This easy to drink and seems prefect for a cold night. I am not sure if I got a bad bottle or something but I felt that it tasted watered down compared to the look and smell. If it was not so watery I feel the taste and mouthfeel would be 4's."
"Taste is very pleasant as well; balanced roast and milk-chocolaty sweetness. Low on the fruit and a nice bready characteristic from the yeast. Medium-full for the style and there is a nice kiss of hop bitterness on the finish. I was not expecting a whole lot with this one, especially given that the freshness dating is 4 months past, but this is a pretty damn nice Schwarzbier. One of the better American brewed versions in fact. I will most certainly purchase a sixer of it next winter as I do love a good black lager, could easily down this by the liter full. Well done Magic Hat."
"D- magic hat seems to be either hit or miss with me, and this one is a hit. theres a lot of flavor packed into this sessionable beer. something ill definitely be looking for towards the end of this year."
"D - I like the flavor and other characteristics, but as with me and most earthy beers, more than a couple would be a challenge."
"pours a very dark brown almost black with a one finger head and minimal lace. smells of roasted malt taste was same but weak and watered down and with a slight after taste. light mouthfeel. not something i would buy again from magic hat. i am sure the import style of this beer would be much better."
"D - goes down smoother than a stout because it is lighter, but the stout-like tastes isn't really counducive to drinking multiple servings"
"This brew pours clear dark brown bordering on black with a deep mahogany hue when held to the light. The head is moderate tan color but quickly diminished to a thin skim. The aroma is moderate-high roasted malt with a bit of chocolate and coffee. The flavor is moderate-high malt, roast and chocolate with just a but of acidic dryness. The hop bitterness is moderate-low and is complemented by roasted dryness. The body is medium and smooth and carbonation moderate. Overall a well made flavorful black lager that could be drank all night."
"Overall, though I am quickly developing a taste for different beers, this one really stands out to me as something special. It wasn't just another ""elixer"" from the Magic Hat Brewing Company, but I feel it really went above and beyond! The only thing that truly bothers me about this beer, is that it isn't available year round. Superior drinkability and refreshment made me come back to this beer over and over while it was available."
"I'd like to compare it to the Schwarzbier that Schells did a few years ago."
"This is an awesome session beer. I want this beer on tap sooo bad."
"Different take on a Schwarzbier, and a nice one at that."
"D: Very drinkable. There is nothing overpowering or taxing about this beer (or the style in general), and thus nothing to tire your taste buds."
"A really nice example of the schwarzbier style - rich, dark color. Well moderated roasted malt - nice toasty flavors without getting too dark. Perhaps a little more hoppy at the finish that customary for the style, but nicely flavored. A good session candidate."
"This beer is dark with a thick head to start, the head dissipates but remains on the glasses edge. The aroma is full of roasted malts and is very pleasant. The beer starts with a roasted carbonation, and you expect a larger maltyness that never come. The carbonation quickly dissipates while the roasted flavor remains (think a like a stout but with no malt)."
"I like black lagers. I wish there were more easy to get. This one is good but not great. Is not as black as it could be. More dark brown. Not much smell. Taste... Can you say Bacon! Bacon! Bacon! It's Bacon! It has a very pronounced bacon favor that is not unpleasant but unusual. Magic hats has some weird tasting malts in their beers. While not bad I would not rush out to by magic hats again."
"This poured a dark semi-opaque mahogany with moderate tan head. It smelled like bready yeast and cocoa powder, with some roasted barley and light lemon hops. It tasted like rusty copper hops with bready yeast and earthy chocolate, and a bit of burnt barley. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a metallic aftertaste. Overall this just wasn't a very good beer. Neither the scent nor the taste were clean at all or very enjoyable. The body was ok, but a bit weak. I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but I imagine this beer is a poorly executed attempt at it."
"Howl is quite light in body; very refreshing and drinkable. The beer finishes with a drying quality. I enjoyed drinking from this style, and Howl was a nice representation."
"I didn't expect much out of this one but it d"
"don't think I would go for this one again."
"Well this is the second, Black Lager that I have reviewed for the site. The first was the Dixie Voodoo Black. So ill compare the two. If you read that review the Dixie it was clean, crisp, and water-like. Howl, has a TON more flavor. It is smokey as expected from a deep black beer, but has a great settling almost sweetness to it. If I could compare it to a person; remember that gothic chick that was in high-school. Well she seemed dark and probably smoked ciggs cause she thought it was ""cool"". Well then when you got to know her and passed all the black clothes and make-up, she was sorta sweet, but yet still dark. Yep that's this beer. So if your into all that dark stuff I would recommend this beer. It has grown on me throughout the month since I was shipped 12 of these bad boys from the ""beer fairy"" up north (they may make a special appearance some time soon...stay tuned!). Well you cant go grab this one, but if your nice I may share my final three with you! Check it out next winter season, for sure!"
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly lighter then expected giving all the flavor that it has. It's light, smooth and pretty drinkable."
"Lots of mouthfeel and a nice roasted chocolate character without an acrid character. Easy drinking and a nice take on this Munich Dunkel style."
"Tastes like it smells, only a bit more dry. The spices are present but not all that strong. Mostly it's the the malt that's in charge, sweet up front and bitter and roasted in the back. Nice thick body makes it go down like chocolate syrup."
"Overall a very solid little lager and probably one of the better offerings I have had from MH recently."
"Overall, this is a good beer by Magic Hat's standards but is not so very well put together. It does have a lot going on in the taste and nose, but it lacks a smoothness to it. It's not a bad brew, though, and is definitely worth a try."
"M/D - Pretty good brew from Magic Hat. Big on the coffee malt flavor, really a smooth brew. I couldn't have more than a couple at a time though due to the strong coffee flavor. A good brew to have a couple bottles of and move on. I would get this again. A good one to try if you're new to the Schwarzbier style"
"Poured into a pint glass, almost black w/ ruby highlights. 1/2"" tan head, reduces to a film that lingers. Fairly consistent lacing. Faint smell, earthy and roasty. Taste is raisin, caramel, malt in the front and a little hop in the aftertaste. This almost reminds me of New Belgium's enlightened black ale. This is nothing strong but it's very drinkable. I like it."
"M/D: Really light for its color (as is the Schwarzbier style), hits the tongue dry, but goes down easy."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel pretty solid for this beer."
"UPDATE, 12/2/2010: Decided to try the 2010 version and I find it somewhat improved. It is still nothing to get too excited about, but I now judge it a passable winter warmer."
"Still, a decent brew, and quite session-able with the low alcohol,"
"Medium bodied beer with a moderate carbonation. For the most part it's quite satisfying and I can't quite figure how they got so much flavor into a low ABV beer. A very nice brew that is worth getting into on a cold day."
"Poured from the bottle a moderately dark color. There was a pleasant, and rather subtle, aroma of fruity hops. The head was minimal, and what was there did not last for long. The taste was smooth, with a nice toffee (toffee not coffee) finish. Overall a rather pleasing beer which I would recommend giving a try."
"Drinkability is good. Very sessionable beer of a style that I wish more breweries would make. Would drink again whenever I want a light beer"
"Pours a black color. 2/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight coffee, slight hop, and oatmeal. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly creamy, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, slight coffee, and slight hops. Overall, a nice blend, body, and mouth feel."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor profile is nice and the ABV is easily sessionable. This combines to make a solid beer that's really easy to enjoy."
"Very drinkable and tasty. Always a fan of this style, and Magic Hat puts out a solid showing with this one."
"A dark flavorful beer that is lighter than it looks... not bad, give it a shot."
"Notes - Not quite sure I would classify this as a winter seasonal, cuz it just don't seem hearty enough for a cold winter night. A decent beer though and probably worth trying. I'm not that experienced with swarzbiers but it seemed like this could have been a bit more flavorful."
"Kind of a boring beer with not too much going on. Thin, lifeless carbonation, sweet maltiness with a prune or raisin-ish flavor resolving to a sticky, caramel aftertaste. For a dark lager it covers all the bases, but offers nothing special or rewarding enough to merit much consideration. It's drinkable, low ABV, plainspoken dark beer. Not bad by any means but needs a bit more attention to detail and less of a generic flavor."
"Better than most Magic Hat's, but weak in substance."
"D: Definitely a session beer."
"""it's Easy to Talk and Say nothing at the Same"" under the bottle cap."
"Not quite a schwartz, not quite a brown and not quite a stout. Howl is an interesting choice for the winter party goer, and I'd be glad to take it in a mix winter pack but would be reluctant to buy a 6 or 12 myself."
"I'm not sure if a Schwarzbier is what Magic Hat is shooting for; the beer is too sweet and doesn't finish with the powdery dry, yet clean finish that make Schwarzbiers so great. This is a roasty Vienna lager that might be better suited for the Fall season- think Halloween."
"Pours a five finger very light tan head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Roasted/burnt coffee. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is almost sweet burnt/roasted coffee. Burnt coffee after taste. Expecting spices with label saying this is a Winter seasonal. Best by Jan 31, 2010. $1.70 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"All in all its okay, but I doubt I'll see this again."
"D: Swarzbiers are drinkable, if nothing else, and Howl is no exception. Simple, but interesting, and light. A good beer to throw into the wintery mix."
"Magic Hat is one of those classic hit-or-miss American craft breweries. Howl is a hit that should appeal to just about everyone who likes good beer. Now watch them discontinue this winter seasonal in favor of a potato and licorice beer called Crazy Black Tater."
"IMO, this is a completely failed beer. I gave away the entire case. I was that disgusted by its dog poopyness. I will bet that Magic Hat spent more time designing the label for this (alleged) beer then was spent in tending to its brewing. P-U - this beer stinks!"
"This review was originally posted @ http://thelightonbeer.blogspot.com"
"Overall, rather thin and light, but worth a try."
"drinkability: highly sessionable. a tad light but still full flavored for what it is. worth a try."
"Notes: This is quite a nice style of beer. I'ts nice to see a Schwarzbier. This is one is a nice winter brew. Cheers."
"I was really impressed with this winter offering by Magic Hat, mostly because I went in with low expectations. I am not knocking on them as a brewer, some of their beers I enjoy quite a bit, some I dislike just as much. Howl offers some nice taste with a body that allows for consistent drinking. It could be stronger and the body could be heavier, however, it is a good beer for the price."
"Overall, Howl could use a little more punch in the flavor, especially in the form of smoke. Not bad though."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle with freshest by date of Jan 10 on back label Magic Hat style. Poured very dark with almost no carbonation leaving no real visible head. Some malts and a considerable amount of dark fruits in the smell. Pretty drinkable black lager. Malts profile flavor is pretty smooth. Nothing to exciting here. I could drink a few of these with no problem and enjoy them."
"At the Cloverleaf Tavern, Caldwell NJ: poured into an American pint glass, mahogany with less than a finger of beige head and spotty lacing. Smelled of raisins, orange, and malt. Tasted of raisins, dates, molasses, and orange peel, with a dry finish. Medium-bodied; more carbonation than expected. The taste mix just didn't do it for me, hence I wouldn't consider sessioning this beer."
"The lower alcohol content helps in the drinkability department... I'd think it'd be pretty easy to knock back quite a few of these."
"Nearly opaque. Thin and creamy light brown head. Lacing is quite full and intricate. Boy is this a thick smelling beer. Thick with earthy notes, like spent coffee grounds, dirt, mud, tar. I love it. The flavor has a smoothness associated with lagers to it but also a roastiness and chocolatey feel to it. A little underlying caramel. Some char. And a lingering dryness to it. Smells great. Taste decent enough. Goes down just fine."
"Overall a tasty black beer and a welcomed easy drinker for winter."
"Mouthfeel is medium with prickly carbonation. Easy to drink."
"Pours black with a medium off-white head. Smell is mild roasted malt with a faint chocolate note. Taste is again roasted malt. Not particularly heavy. Cocoa note in the back. Low sweetness. Some bitterness throughout from the dark malt. Medium to light bodied. Pretty easily drinkable. I haven't had many examples of this style but this is a solid beer overall."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best by March 2010 indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of cola, with a loose, three inch, light tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent quarter inch cap with a thick band of lacing exposed during the session. Nose is very subdued - a hint of chocolate malt, lactose and maybe dark fruit. Flavors are somewhat watery; a roasted/smokey quality comes out, as well as a touch of chocolate and lactic acid. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a very lively background effervescence. Not a bad session beer, but lacking some of the flavor representative of the style. However, one of MH's better offerings in my opinion."
"It's a very burnt tasting porter/stout. Thick. Hasa very mild chocolate taste. Rough on the tongue. Not smooth, a bit sour."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, low ABV with a lot of flavor. This is a highly drinkable beer that you can sit with for an evening."
"It has a black opaque body with a brown hue. A dark tan almost brown head with very spread out lace. I thought the aroma was faint other than a burnt metal scent. It has a clean roasted malt taste with some mild hop tones. It is mainly like charred wood and grain with some spiciness that I can't quite place. The mouth feel is smooth but somewhat thin."
"Drinkability - excellent drinker. Bigger sips yield a more robust roast element, that's the way to go."
"Pours a very dark brown, looks black until held to the light. Has a nice tan head that fades fast. The smell is weird, some malt, burnt characters. The taste starts malty and doesn't have much depth, and finishes with the burnt characters that stay through the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light, I wish it were a bit heavier, but it still is smooth. This is an easy drinker, nice session beer, a decent beer."
"Black body, light tan porous head. Chunky sections in the foam covering the body, think the United States with 17 random states colored vanilla bean, the other 33 colored root beer. The nose contains very burnt malt notes, again not roasted but burnt. Espresso in the aroma as well as the taste with a small vanilla backing and blackstrap molasses without the sweetness-only a burnt character. Bitter from the semi-sweet malt flavors and the espresso. Mouthfeel is crisp, dry and reminiscent of a plsner-doesn't stick very well."
"D- Good beer, may be able to drink a sixer in one sitting. A bit bitter, but nothing that takes away from enjoying this beer."
"D - This is a pretty fine schwarzbier. Great roasted flavor."
"Conclusion: Nice, simple, flavorful Schwartzbier. I'm not crushed that I can't get this around here, but if it was a local brew, I'd probably pick it up from time to time."
"Had in the holiday pack. Black appearance with some amber in the light. Small, patchy lacing with a very thin head. Aromas were quite good. Burnt coffee smells mixed with some sweet malts. Really delicious, milky taste to the drink. Burnt bitterness follows, but the malts really made this an incredibly pleasant drink. Mouthfeel aids in the taste sensation by giving a creamy texture and light, slightly airy feel to the drink. Overall, a fine drink for my New Years."
"I believe this is an interesting beer but not overly representative of an English dunkel. It leaves a stronger coffee or smoked porter impression."
"I poured this black as night brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was bready smelling and had a big tan bubbly head. The beer had a slight roasted coffee hit with a tad of maltyness. Very nice beer and great lacing. I will buy again for sure."
"(Bottle into mug) It looks nice! Poured a deep black with a half finger light brown head that hung on for quite a while. After that, well... nothing redeeming about it at all. The nose was reminiscent of an ashtray. All I could smell was smoke, and not the nice campfire kind.. the week old Marlboro kind -- it almost seems as the roasting went a little too far. I battled through and took a taste, but again, the burnt smoky flavor was too much. Let this one sit for a few minutes to let the air hit this and hopefully mellow some flavors and draw out others, but to no avail. Took another drink and that was it, I had to pour the rest. Bottle was dated 1/2010 and perhaps this was part of it, or I got a bad batch. I might have to try again next year to see if that was the case."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D: Very smooth, could definitely be a good session beer in the winter months."
"Drinkability gets a lower score due to the weakness in flavor and the somewhat awkward overall character. Other schwarzbiers I've had may surprise you, but they are winning with taste and drinkability. Some tinkering needs to be done to figure out the sharpness and resolve alcoholic taste."
"Overall this is an ok beer. Not the best schwarzbier in the crowd. Nothing off putting about this brew. In the end its a fairly forgettable brew."
"Drinkability is outstanding, favorable but easy drinking and low alcohol so great session brew with tons of flavors couldn't go wrong with this one."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is not a beer I would normally reach for but is extremely easy to drink and rather enjoyable. Very smooth going down and there is nothing offensive about Howl at all. Solid session beer."
"A- I really enjoy this style and I feel like this is a good effort by MH. Especially for these cold dreary post xmas days."
"D, notes: A nice well made, well balanced beer. Very drinkable with enough complexity to keep things interesting."
"Drinkability: If you like your beers dark and with a coffee flavor, then run for this one. The upside on this one, far outpaces the weaknesses....so buy with confidence, but beware: the howl sometimes bites back!"
"Drinkability: All in all, it's a decent, if average Schwarzbier. Nothing to Howl about, but nothing to thumb your nose at, either."
"another wonderful beer from the people at magic hat."
"This is one of the better Magic Hat brands out there. Pours to a dark reddish brown, very little head. Nose is like an amber ale with hops and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium and slightly coating. Flavor includes notes of coffee, chocolate (roasted malts), and nuts with a slight barley character."
"The use of MH's house ale yeast makes this more along the lines of a UK porter/schwarzbier hybrid, though it's definitely cleaner than most MH beers. Interesting addition to the lineup."
"drinks like a schwartzy...this is going down fast....good hits of dark cocoa and coffee on the taste and aroma...lighter bodied but doesn't feel watery...just easy drinking and flavorful...exactly what a schwartzy should be....Not tremendously complex but also has hints of caramel....very well done."
"D: Pretty easy drinker for a winter brew. Maybe a little bit lower ABV then I'd like on a cold winter night, but nothing too challenging here."
"This 12-oz bottle pours out a dark brown-black beer with a small offwhite head that fades after a minute or so. The aroma is malty, lightly roasted. Clean, though slightly grainy, roast malt flavor dominates. Hop bitterness is moderate, but no hop flavor. Malty finish. Neutral texture and mouthfeel."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with the label clipped at March 2010. This beer is still brewed or at least it has returned for the 2009-2010 season. It pours black with a quarter-inch creamy beige head. It carries a nice aroma of chocolate malts and hops. Medium to bold mouthfeel. The taste is smoked coffee with a nice bitter finish. It is very much like a Porter really and enjoyable."
"D: Drinkability was good, perhaps its strongest point, light bodied with just enough roasted character to give it some flair. I could easily drink several of these as a session beer and at 4.6%abv is fairly easy to handle. Six pack worthy."
"An interesting offering from Magic Hat and a great winter seasonal. It has some solid roasted malt flavors and some good hoppy bitterness that coexist in harmony, neither being overpowering. Pours an opaque midnight black with a tan head that recedes to patches of foam on top of the beverage. What really impresses me about it though is its smoothness and supurb drinkability. It is a lighter beer but still maintains lots of flavor. Not quite as bold as a porter or stout but still very satisfying. I would recommend this one to those who are tried of the macro piss-water and would like to venture into the darker realm of beer."
"for all the suggestive notes going on, this isn't thick and sticky in the mouth. tastes great. a very drinkable winter brew."
"Other looks of popular Schwarz's are Sam Adams Black lager and my personal favorite Saranac Black Forest."
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one poured a dark, opaque brown color. There was as small tan head that dropped off quickly. The nose is good. First off you get some chocolate, then roasted malts. The taste is chocolaty, and a bit roasty and a bit dry. Nice."
"Pours the deepest of dark reds with a fluffy tan head that sticks itself to the glass all the way down. Smells of cocoa and milk chocolate, grainy with some roast and dark fruits. Taste is cocoa powder with some dark fruits. Grainy malts with a hint of roast in there as well. Finishes kind of dry with a lingering roasted malt finish. Carbonation is high, very prickly and annoying. Mouthfeel is creamy and the body is medium. I'm confused by this one. Its a decent enough beer, although a bit less carbonation would have helped this out. Its labeled a Schwartzbier, but it reminds me more of a porter. Its a lot better than some of the beer Magic Hat has been trying to pass off lately. I'd enjoy another, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"An aggressive pour yielded a dark, hazlenut-brown hue... Nutty roasty aroma evident on both the tongue and in the nose... Taste could've been a bit richer and thicker... slightly watered-down... Evident malts provide a strong backbone to an easily drinkable beer... Doesn't sit well with me as a winter lager with the flaccid 4.6% abv... Not bad, just not my ideal choice for a Winter-seasonal brew..."
"Anyways, there's an inviting toasted dark chocolate aroma that carries over into the flavor. There's also a surprisingly big kick (for MH) of herbal and citrus rind hops. Dark chocolate, a touch of toffee, and a heathly helping of noble hops - very tasty. I wish this was a regular beer. I'd drink lots;."
"Drinks very well but perhaps ramping this up a notch will make it more impressive."
"D - Ok, very good for winter season and abv is low."
"D: Not so bad, easy enough to drink at well under 5% ABV. Big flavor, just not necessarily a flavor that's desirable, unfortunately. Possibly over-roasted, but a bolder flavor benefits from it. A good beer for a try, be your own judge whether you seek more."
"Overall, this is probably my least favorite offering from Magic Hat that I've had. It's not BAD, I just don't think it has a whole lot behind it that's GOOD. I'll probably give it another try sometime just to see if I have a new perspective."
"Overall, not what I was expecting from the name ""Howl"" and from the winter theme. Previously, all the winter brews I've tried could be described as ""substantial"". Compared to them, this one was pretty subdued, but it's a fine beer nonetheless. However, if I was in the mood for a winter brew, this probably wouldn't be one of my ""go to"" beers."
"A fine winter brew. Nothing particularly great about it, but there are no real problems with it either. Basically a safe bet, and I one I'll forget tomorrow."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, if you're in the mood for the style this is a good beer to drink for a while."
"Pours black in body topped by off-white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of grains, sweet malt, little spice. Lager flavors of some sweetened cereal, dark malts, faint chocolate note toward the finish and then a vague butterscotch aftertaste. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. A lighter winter seasonal than most. A nice crossover for people who wish to reach for something other than macro brews and SA Winter Lager."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a not quite opaque dark brown with a thin diminishing off white head that leaves a slight amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a slight amount of dark malts, not much else. The taste is dark malts with a nice accompaniment of bakers cocoa and slight caramel and fresh ground coffee. The beer is quite light, crisp and smooth with decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, while it wouldn't be my first choice for a cold winter night, it does do the trick."
"I don't regret trying it and may get it again in the future. It seems as if this brewery is going down hill, I feel this is one of the better beers left behind Roxy Rolles."
"D: A pleasant, somewhat surprising schwarzbier from Magic Hat. Easily drinkable and nicely flavored. A solid representative of an underrated style."
"apparently this beer has been retired but this is from a new pack, so they must have just discontinued it. but you can still get it at your local beer spot."
"M&D - thinner than expected, but smooth and highly sessionable, especially at less than 5%, would be great on tap, nice brew MH"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some notes of coffee. Taste is rather mild, roasted malts and little else. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not a bad brew, but less flavorful than other beers of this style."
"Pours a near black, almost cola like color, with a wispy tan head that settles into a sparse cap but left some lacing. Light aroma of roasted malt, caramel and perhaps some chocolate. A nice light roasted malt flavor, some brown sugar, caramel, hints of metal and some herbal notes. Some light tea like characteristics in the end. Very nice flavors, a touch sweet. A light to moderate feel with fizzy carbonation, nice balance between sweet and roasted malt bitterness. I thought that this was a very enjoyable schwarzbier, nice light roasted malt flavor, fairly light body, easy drinking."
"Dark chocolate body with a thin off white head. Body is very clear. Aroma has a hint of bittersweet chocolate but is otherwise very clean. Flavor is roasted malts backed by light biscuit note. A slight bitter edge appears on the finish and it gradually dries the back of my throat. Body is on the lighter side. Carbonation is a litle agressive and combined with the dry finish actually starts making me feel parched. I need a heavier beer after this! The flavor is nice - the finish is not."
"The mouthfeel as really thin, some bitter bite at end. A nice beer not very heavy nor too smokey, I could have had another."
"Not a bad beer, but not what I wanted/expected...lacking in the flavor and mouth feel departments."
"THis is a very good Dark Lager true to class of a Schwarzveir. Very drinkable; smooth with a nice lager yeast bite."
"Overall this was a decent - and low ABV - beer for the style however it didn't really have enough malt presence to be anything more."
"D- A very nice beer that drinks great. A great, richly flavored beer that isn't too heavy... if that makes any sense."
"When I picked this up, I thought it was going to be competition(and similar too) Sam Adams Winter Lager. I was way off from my preconceived notions of this being a mildly spiced dark wheat lager. I knew NOTHING of this beer ahead of time. What I found was a nice, mildly roasted Schwarzbier. MH doesn't have a whole lot of dark beers in their lineup right now...even the occasional ones. This actually reminds me a bit of a blend of Jinx, and Heart of Darkness. Too bad those ones went the way of the dinosaur and only make rare appearances at the brewery. More dark brews, please Magic Hat!"
"Drinkability is pretty good. Flavors are balanced, if not overwhelmingly impressive."
"This is a pretty nice try at a schwarz. Has the dry, slightly roasted malt down. It's not a strong beer, and very easy to drink."
"Pours a dark brown colro with a small tan head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Lagerish aroma of malt and a touch of smokiness. A little bit reserved. The flavor features a lot of smoky flavor, a lot more than what is typical of the style. Hints of smoked meat and bitter chocolate. To the flavor is dominated by the smoke. The body is light like it should be but it seems overcarbonated. Sessionable ABV and body. I would be more inclined to buy a 6-pack of this than have to buy it part of a mix 12."
"D: A good beer to have as a six pack during a cold winter evening. Not overwhelming in taste or feel, but a better alternative to a boring macro lager."
"Surprisingly flavorful for Magic Hat, Howl is spicy and spritzy on the palate with a finish that is hard to place. Actually, the flavors in this beer are more difficult to describe than most I've come across--a hint of chocolate and dark fruit here, a little coffee and brown malt there. Hops continuous in the background, adding earthy notes and a pinch of citrus. Light body with a good carbonation level. Slight drying finish could stand to be a bit smoother. Overall, I found Howl to be a pretty good attempt at a Schwartzbier. Not the best, but certainly above par for Magic Hat."
"Try this beer, it is a great winter beer."
"Magic hat was long overdue for a new and interesting seasonal."
"A pleasant surprise from Magic Hat. Nothing offensive about the flavor. Eminently sessionable."
"I had this on tap at Bobbique in Patchogue, NY and was served this with a platter of ribs. I thought it looked fine with a small head and its aroma was okay with coffee tinged malts, but nothing fancy for a winter ale. When I got the first taste, I thought it must be the bbq ribs, so I had water and bread before trying again. It may have needed a little time to warm up after coming through a cold tap. It tasted like a black version of Euro- pale lagers with nothing in body or taste. Not bad, but no substance to it. I consumed half the pint and then moved on to something else."
"Notes: A nice surprise from Magic Hat and the first one of their beers that I find myself actually recommending to others. Bravo!"
"Drinkability - Very sessionable"
"Not as dark or rich as it could be. Not as smooth as a lager should be either, and carbonation is too pushy. Yet it does have potential. Calming the carbonation and pushing up the malt character might help."
"Medium bodied, slightly dry, and a ticklish carbonation."
"Had a fizzy white head that did not linger long with minimal lacing. Very clear very dark brown in color but could see through my glass. Nice roasted aroma a little more bitter in taste then I was expecting. I think the are better black lagers out there but this one will do and I thought the lable was pretty cool."
"I didn't know this winter seasonal was a schwarzbier until I sat down to review it. I thought I was drinking some kind of porter. In a pint glass the beer was a very dark brown/black color with a small tan head. Sweet, roasted malt, and floral aroma. The taste showed some dark fruit, coffee, and late hops kick. Medium bodied, moderately enjoyable."
"Drinkability: kind of a slow drinking beer and it has little refreshment. One bottle was more than enough in the session."
"D - A decent brew. A nice winter-ish beer. I'd have another."
"A tad thin on the mouthfeel, but that keeps it on the lighter (drinking, not color) side of things."
"I like a good Schwarzbier, they're often a refreshing change to dark ales. This one is pretty good, but not exceptional in my book. It's an essentially black color with reddish hues when held up to the light. Very slight tan head. The aroma is of roasted grain and malt. No real hop smell. It's a bit more roasty than necessary, though. The taste is moderately dry and a little more toasted than expected. It's also a little slick on the tongue. Very smooth and satisfying, however. Flavorful and very enjoyable. Overall, it's easy to drink and could be a good session beer."
"This is a very tasty schwarzbier, with a broader array of flavors than almost any other of its style that I've tried. It also looks amazing: pours a very dark brown with some interesting carbonation cascades that gradually form a craggy grayish head. Aromas are understated given the power of its flavors, which start out very sweet and chocolately before releasing a smokey, burnt bitterness. Finishes long and sweet. A very gratifying brew. I plan to stock up on it this winter."
"D - not bad, but not particularly noteworthy either. Could be good to have a few of these tailgating"
"Ultimately, I'm unsure how highly to rate it just based on the limited hop profile, and a roasted malt flavor that reminds me more of a porter than a schwarzbier. But its good, so I won't be exceedingly harsh.."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability is below par - i am glad i bought a single"
"Take it to the mountains in fall with the leaves changing with crisp air and sunshine."
"Wow! There are few beers I start a review with Wow, but this is one that deserves it. Howl took me by surprize. While I've enjoyed beer from Magic Hat in the past, I've found some to be just so-so but not this one. This beer, poured into a standard pint glass looked just like a still winter night, black, with a head of light brown/beige sky. The head dissipates a bit as one drinks down but still remains till the bottom of the glass,(trust me it's so good each sip will invite you back the bottom of the glass arrive quickly). The nose is a faint roasted grain aroma with a hint of coffee. The taste is velvety chocolate and the suttle aftertaste of a sweet mild morning coffee. The finish lingers in such a way as to invite another sip (that I just had to have right away!). The ABV at just 4.60% make Howl my new sessions beer. If the boys at AB want to really know what the meaning of drinkability is, this is drinkability with flavor. I think I'll Howl but, not at the moon, all night."
"F: Finishes very smoky and pretty dry. The lingering smoke doesn't go away, it really gives you the feeling that you were sitting around a campfire all night trying to eat the smoke. Slightly bitter as well, but its hard to tell if that's from some random hops added or just the charred quality of the roasted/smoked malts."
"D: Interesting style, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of this Schwarzbier."
"I liked this Schwarzbier style from Magic Hat. MH just refers to it as a ""black-as-night Winter Lager"" on the label. First Magic Hat beer I have tried, btw. I first sampled this at a Brewpub, but I am reviewing it after having a full pint. Had about an inch of head at the beginning, but after the first sip it started to dissipate until it just became lacing. The beer is a dark, black Lager, not Ale, with roasted, chocolate-esque & coffee-like overtones. It seemed like a Porter, but the aftertaste, body and finish is very much Lager. I liked that it was smoother than a Stout or Porter, not as heavy. My regret is that I only bought one bottle because this single pint left me thirsting for more."
"Nose is mostly roasty with subtle coffee. Taste brings the same as the nose with a certain earthiness. Not a particularly strong taste. I actually found it a bit boring at first but it got better as it warmed. Mouthfeel is probably medium overall but lighter than it looks. Medium carbonation. This beer actually tastes and feels a good bit like a porter, but with a bit more carbonation. Fairly drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pilsner and patent malt scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a light and easily quaffable patent malt flavor that's earthy and coffee-like with a smooth, dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It's basic, but highly drinkable. It could use some crystal malts to round out the flavor more, but it's fine regardless."
"Overall,tasted like a weak porter, but enjoyable-certainly sessionable at4.6 ABV."
"another great dark beer is here .a roasted , coffee taste and smell but not too much , make a nice drinking beer . enjoyable night when is beer is around. a jet black in color which is the only color beer should be. everybody writes better review then me but try this beer you may like it. it another dark black beer to add to your list to drink . join me in drinking this beer tonite"
"D - Could drink this all night and seems to get better as it warms except for the sour smell."
"The taste is quite light, a tad watery, a bit more carbonated that I was expecting. There is a slight cocoa powder dryness and malty chocolate flavors. There is also a very noticeable hop bitterness on the back end that is very complementary to the dryish malts. This is a very refreshing beer, suitable for all seasons. This is not a thick winter warmer by any stretch, although the labeling could fool you. There are definitely mild roasted notes, maybe a touch of molasses in there too from the dark malts. The mouthfeel is light the aftertaste lingers a bit with some dry nutty flavors and some charred roast. This is a decent beer. There is a slight chalky flavor popping through in parts that the beer could do without."
"D: I loved this beer for its flavor and drinkability which is in great combination. Not heavy or strong but very solid in flavor and it begs you to drink more because it goes down easier than a heavy stout. I was very pleased by this one from Magic Hat and I hope they keep it going."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a 6-pack at Shaw's in Derry, NH. Pours a pitch black body with slight brown-red highlights around the edges and nearly an inch of somewhat short-lived light tan head that clings to the side of the glass. Smells roasty, somewhat nutty - coffee comes to mind - with slight fruit and vanilla notes. Tastes roasty too, with a definite cappuccino-like quality, with some nut, hints of milk, vanilla, and a tinge of butter (I'm guessing from Ringwood yeast?), but not enough to overwhelm the rich sweet roastiness. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. This one is somewhat of a sipper, despite the low ABV and lack of viscosity, due to the complexity of the flavor. Not the best Schwarzbier I've had - I'm guessing this was made with ale yeast? Could stand to be cleaned up a bit leaving it with less-no diacetyl (which is another thing hurting the drinkability of it for me), but overall a pretty good beer, and one of the best that I've had from these guys by quite a wide margin. Glad I bought it!"
"One of those beers I may not rate high, but could drink all night long."
"Overall, this suits the winter seasonal category much better than Roxy Rolles did. I can see why they did not want to have two dark beers back to back for Fall and then Winter but I am still sad to see Jinx go. It was however still on tap at the brewery a few weeks ago so it doesn't seem completely retired. They could have at least revamped Roxy Rolles to fit the fall season a little more, perhaps even put a pumpkin twist on it. Overall Howl is a solid winter beer but reminds me more of a chocolate porter than a shwarzbier for sure. Let's see what the Vinyl spring lager has in store this spring, and I really hope they aren't axing HIPA permanently!"
"Drinkability: An average schwarzbier. Makes sense for their winter pack though. It's got that full-bodied roasted taste you expect from most winter brews but is also light, crisp, and refreshing."
"Drinkability: A nice schwarzbier, could be better if it had a bit heavier of a flavor but overall I like it. Sweeter and less bitter than most of the style."
"Easy drinker on a cool winters day."
"Pours almost black with a fluffy tan head. Excellent retention and a very nice lacing. Aroma is of smokey chocolate malts,and coffee. Body is medium with light carbonation. Taste has a smokey presence throughout. Hints of coffee and dark chocolate,with a bit of spice. Not bad,but the Sam Adams Black ale was better in my opinion."
"Blushing Monk Asheville. A very nice near black pour with a highly contrasting white head. Aroma is mild, roast/burnt malt and nut. Taste has the same, with some dark chocolates, smoke and ash. Thinner body than I would like, just a tad on the watery side. Finish is quite clean and dry. Drinkability is very high, especially with the abv. Aroma and flavor is a bit subdued compared to ones I've had that I liked more. But, I'd say this stuff was pretty good, especially for Magic Hat, which has some pretty mediocre brews."
"One of the better new Magic Hat beers in quite some time. They needed one of these to renew my faith, as the Winter '09 Odd Notion was a disappointment and they have, in general, been playing it safe (ie. boring) lately. Seek out Howl, especially if you're a fan of dark German-style lagers."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours an opaque black color with a decent fizzy light brown head, decent lacing. Aroma is caramel and roasted malts, coffee, and a hint of earthiness. Flavor is roasted malts, wood, nutty, and earthy hops. Mouthfeel medium, well carbonated, kind of chalky at the end. Pretty good beer, good for the style."
"Semi-thin mouthfeel, a little slick upfront, very bubbly, finishes too tingly. Could be more full. Tasty beer, could be more complex, but pretty drinkable."
"Nice pour...little head. i smell burnt & licorice. not too happy to start. nice mouthfeel pretty smooth. wow...this is some light stuff for the color. good taste though. i have to hand it to magic hat...they packed some flavor into this really light beer. you can drink this all night long, but i doubt you will hand one to your bud and say""bro, you gotta try this, it will knock your socks off"". it's pretty good, not great, but good. the abv is appropriate for the feel on this one. i had this back to back with avery's new world porter. not a good move, cuz that one packs a whollop. if you pair this with a bad ass beer it will not stand. on it's own, you should have a pretty good time..."
"The feel is pretty good for this winter beer. It has a great medium body and goes down better than expected."
"MF/D - Easy drinking and surprisingly thin for the deep taste. Would go great with ice cream and brownies."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and light with an edge of graininess to it. Solid carbonation throughout. Pretty easy to drink. Overall, it's a little heavy on the burnt coffee for me, but is still probably one of my favorite beers I've had from Magic Hat. Sessionable."
"I can see drinking alot of this, but perhaps getting a bit boring after two or more. A decent enough Schwartzbier for what it is, being that it's a fairly difficult style to really nail down."
"Pours a blackish body with a tan head that died slowly on top of a malty aroma of roasted/coffee malts along with some bready/herbal sweet malt smells. This beer has a mediumish body that goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry. Has a mild taste that mixes roasted/coffee malts along with some sweetness. Goes down easy although a little dry/rough for a schwarzbier."
"Beer pours a very dark cola color with a brown color head that is very thin and gives way quickly with very little lacing present. The smell is of coffee and roasted malt notes. The taste has a big coffee flavor with a slight hint of coco and a roasted malt backbone. The mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, it has good flavor, and you could have a lot of these because it is not heavy."
"D: Not as heavy as normal lager. so it makes it quite easy to just enjoy and drink along."
"D: A taste was enough for me, but in general it is a fairly good beer, just not amazing. Fine job, now bring jinx back."
"Appears dark black with cola brown edges when held toward the light. Large tan head rises above the rim of my glass, nice chunks of lace spread evenly around the sides of my Weihenstephan glass. Aroma is filled with dark roasts with semi bitter notes. Herbal grassy mildly citrus notes of hops in the bacground, with upfront coffee and dark bitter chocolate. Flavor has creamy chocolate and bitter coffee grinds blended nicely a really nice experience. Like drinking a big stout with a light body and alcohol content herbal hops blend in the mix as well. Heavy on the dark bitter roasts in the finish I like it minimal herbal hops are flowing with persistance. Mouthfeel is medium to lighter bodied with a nice even level of natural carbonation flowing creamy overall with a nice roasted malt bitterness left on the palate with each sip. Drinkability is great especially in the cooler months, I could love on a sixer of this whilst tailgating in the Burgh before the Steelers play down at Heinz Field. I could mix a few lighter beers into the mix and have a black and gold sampler this would be a good staple for the schwarzbier category."
"Overall- This is much better than I was expecting. Solid."
"Gotta love the appearance of this one.. deep black with a hint of redness in the light.. off white head. Smell it a bit roasted coffee smelling.. reminds me a lot of an oatmeal stout. Taste is very smooth with a nice mouthfeel. Nothing too prominent in the particular tasting notes, just some nice maltiness and some of the roasted flavors. Pretty heavy bodied as well which was a surprise, certainly not one to pound down. Nice of MH to mix it up for a winter seasonal, not my favorite but a solid beer in their mixed pack."
"Would be better without the diacetyl."
"D - If this was a little lighter, I'd say it was more drinkable. As it stands, it's hard to have more than two I'd say."
"Smell is some roasted malts, with a little bit of chocolate and coffee. Taste follows the aroma, with lots of roasted flavor. The beer is a little thin in the mouth, but there is a creamy texture similar to what you would find in a milk stout. Overall this is a good beer that has a very good mix of flavor and low alcohol."
"***EDIT: I've had other bottles since that didn't have the strange tangy manure taste. Must've been an off bottle."
"Haven't had many schwarzbiers, but they seem decently straight forward. This one reminds me of Left Hand Milk Stout from what I remember. Pours a pitch black color with a light tan two finger head that retains decently, nice and creamy. Leaves medium lacing behind. Smells of sweets, roasted malts and chocolate, strong nose but not a great one. Tastes of roasted malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel is moderate with a bit of creamyness to it, leaves a sweet grainy taste on the tongue. The carbonation is a bit much, really throws the beer off IMO. No alcohol warming at all. Drinkability is decent, the taste is not bad, the mouthfeel kind of throws this one off, great price, no bad flavors to kill this one, can be sessioned, probably won't buy this one again specifically."
"Certainly not like the (defunct) Orlio Black Lager but still quite drinkable. There are definitely better styles out there but given MH's recent track record, hopefully this is the last ""new"" beer they'll have on the horizon as they've already killed off much better beers."
"Taste is sweet, coffee and chocolate, low carbonation makes it very smooth and rich. Awesome winter beer, very tasty and malty, really surprising this is a lager!"
