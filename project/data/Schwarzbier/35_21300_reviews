"From the descriptions I should have loved this beer but it just didn't do it for me."

"Great for cooking when poured over ribs, okay for drinking when poured into your mouth."

"Overall (3.53) : A decent try but Shiner definitely has this one beat. I like the flavors more and the roast comes out better in Shiner's version. This beer focuses more on milk and honey aspects, not so much on the roast and toast. It's still a decent beer, though, and I'd drink it again."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 8/2014. Pours crystal clear deep brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, plum, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, plum, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, chocolate, roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"what a fantastic black lager. the best of both worlds here, almost as much a baltic porter as a schwarzbier really, robust malt profile, earthy and heavily roasted, with a nutty middle and a lot of body for such a quick finish. dark in color too, pushing black, with a matte finish, well carbonated, and thin on the head. it smells nutty and toasty like good roasted barley, but not bitter or super dense like some can be, this stays light while holding onto that extremely deep dark grain element. really a great success here. lager yeast has a lot of flavor this time around, and with the dark malt, its like the burnt flakes on the crust of a properly cooked wood fired pizza, it has that char and dough thing working well for it. hoppy too for an almost macro brew, biting in the finish, more than balancing to the flavoring level, but its all in excellent proportion. lively carbonation makes it feel rather light for its color, and it ends up being a sessionable and quenching drink. sam adams has some really solid basic beers in their lineup, and this is a prime example that beer doesnt have to be complex to be delicious."

"This beer was pretty good. I like that interesting twist of this dark beer. Very interesting flavor, not very easy to describe. Complex, yet smooth. It has the malty flavor you expect from a dark beer, but different from a porter or stout. I would definitely drink this brew again. It reminded me a lot of Xingu."

"Grabbed a six pack for my wife because she enjoyed the Guinness black lager so much and I was sick of her drinking my beers! Pours very black with a light caramel hue. It goes down smooth, maybe not quite as smooth as the Guinness black, but there is a lot more flavor here than from Guinness. This is a very solid beer, drinks well and has a lot of flavor. Good brew for a quiet Monday night."

"Samuel Adams Black Lager ---3.5/5"
""
""
"This beer has a nice drinkable feel like most largers with this same amount of alcohol. It has a medium to lighter body and is smooth going down."
""
""
"Overall: I will remember this beer for it's roasted, toasty profile. Pretty flavorful."

"Pours a dark brown like cola. A 1/2 finger beige head is seen with a decent amount of lacing. Lots going on with the aroma with burnt brown sugar, chocolate, roasted malts and dark fruit. Even more going on with the taste and sweeter than excepted. Very nice balance of flavors as well as perfect carbonation. One of the better 'black lagers' for sure."

"O-A great Schwarz bier. Sam Adams DOES knock out of the park rare, hardly done styles, (in America) I must say. Black Lager is not a regrettable purchase. But it could be better. You do get a smoked sense with the brew that is pleasant. But drink QUICKLY. And one bottle at a time. Because the qualities will evaporate. Flavors will die and carbonation disappears. Drink this decent beer I say still. And search out for authentic imported Schwarz biers."

"This is mostly a rate from memory as I have not seen this one in a while. Pours a deep dark brown with slightly brownish off white head. Aroma is dark malty chocolate, some definite roast, with bite that makes it not super sweet. Flavor follows closely, with big roast and a bit of bittersweet chocolate. Interestingly, I didn't get much smoke from this, more roast to me. Rather rich mouthfeel for the ABV, and a pretty solid brew."

"I had a great pour with a resultant two fingers of deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep brown with garnet highlights and seemingly good clarity, allowing for its extremely dark color. Nose smelled of cocoa powder and I was reminded of my Lunch Duty partner who seems to to really dig on chocolate. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite cocoa/smoky taste on the tongue. She claims not to like beer, but I would bet that she would totally dig this. For me, it was a bit too sweet, but not cloying, which I really dislike. Finish was semi-sweet and a decent drink for the style, even if not my bag."

"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours dark brown with a thick, light tan head and plentiful rising bubbles in the beer. The head recedes somewhat slowly, leaving some lacing behind on the glass. Lacing is left behind on the glass during consumption. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, toffee, chocolate, and some hints of spiciness from the hop varieties that were selected (spalt and hallertau mittelfruh). The flavor is malty with some mild toffee, mild chocolate, water, and some hop spiciness. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer."

"Coffee notes, dark but not heavy! Easy to drink and very smooth for a dark beer, does not come around often, so grab some if you see them."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A solid dark beer option, and in the same vein of some of my favorite import schwarzbiers. This still tastes like an American take on the style. Tasty beer."

"O - A really bizarre Schwarz from SA. Too many off characteristics that didnt work to be considered a truly good beer. Not a repeat buy."
""
""
""
""
"Pours nice - very black, opaque, nice foamy head with decent retention. What hit me first again was burnt - overwhelming burnt notes. Taste was the same - I couldn't even call it smoky, really. Some malty flavor in there. Maybe a touch of chocolate and toffee. Seems a bit sour as well, especially as it warmed up. I am not seeing how this example matches with the definition of the style - I didn't find any hops character to it. Other than being light on the mouth feel and well-carbonated I don't see it fitting the overall style."
""
""
"Not to say much about this guy... had it a few times in sampler packs. dark beer.. the flavor is okay. not my favorite sam adams but its worth a try. made black and blues with it before def not as thick or rich as other beers that would have worked better with that. wasnt a fan of the after taste."

"Pretty good Schwarzbier."
""
""
"O - Excellent balance of sweet with low roast and mild hop. This is a stout without the stoutiness. A great beer to introduce a neophyte to something with character. This seems like a truly Americanized version of the schwarzbier style."
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing and light alternative to heavier porters and stouts. I like this."

"Overall: Not bad, but could use some better flavoring, maybe a bit stronger on the carmels and toasted malts."
""
""
"Overall, while the beer isnâ€™t quite as black in appearance as the name suggests, the initial aromas were promising and savory. However, the flavors proved watery, especially over the course of several mouthfuls, and the watery mouthfeel further took away from the overall package. Decent fare, and likely excellent entry-level beer for anyone making the transition into craft beers due to its approachability and the fact that it wonâ€™t blast your palate silly, but doesnâ€™t quite keep up with its heavier-hitting peers."

""
"Overall - Feels like a lager, tastes much like a stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black with brownish edges that appear clear with a tan head. Aroma and body virtually match each other with light notes of molasses, roasted barley and an earthiness behind it all. No sweetness in the body. Finishes almost watery though for so much roasted nature, almost like a nitro Guinness. Good enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, its an incredibly tasty beer with the right aromas and feels that makes it almost perfect."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a definite hit from the Sam Adams collection and you won't regret buying one. I'll buy one again. (I would like to try it on tap)"
""
"Mouthfeel and Overall - Very light-bodied and lightly carbonated. Watery at first, but a nice smokey chocolate malt backs it up a bit in the end. With respect, this beer is not terribly great, but it is certainly better and contains more of a body than the Dixi Black Voodoo I just had not too long ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a refreshing beer that is suitable for winter or summer. It has the characteristics of porters or stouts but is much lighter and versatile. A great offering from Boston Beer Co."

"O: Â Mild but flavorful and smooth drinking. One of my personal favorites from the Boston Beer Company. I enjoy this anytime of the year and highly recommend it. Â Not sure how it represents the style because this is my first of this style but a delicious beer none the less.Â "
""
"A deep dark black/brown color! Small off white head. An amazing smell of dark breads and roasted grains The taste is much the same with a brilliant light body to balance out the heavy smell and taste. A great beer the lets your drink a dark or bigger bold tasting beer when you want a light body beer."

"Dark, clear, with a darkish off white head. Nice head and lacing. A light covering remains as I drink. Aromas of dark breads and deeply roasted grains. Some molasses and toasted pumpernikel. A bit of yeasty fruit esters. Taste is much like the nose with a clean crisp signature. Finish is roasty and mildly hopped with earth and a bit of charcoal that folds itself into a dark bread with a thin spread of brown rice syrup. A tea leafiness and lingering dryness. Feel is smooth and crisply carbonated with a medium weight. A solid beer overall with much to enjoy."

"Overall I am really enjoying this beer and will definitely be getting it again. It is a very satidfying and quaffable black lager."

""
""
""
"O- Probably one of Sam Adam's best! Definitely one to have in the fridge. Full flavored, not terribly expensive or hard to get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice offering by Samuel Adams, rich and roasty lager with an uplifting character that does well to adapt to the seasons. Curbing the sloppy finish with the tartness and stick would help this alot. I came away fairly impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent, very drinkable beer. Somewhat simplistic on the palate, but not flawed either. Certainly not the best I've had in the style, but very approachable."

"Overall â€“ This is truly a solid beer offering from the Boston Beer company. I have been a little disappointed in some of their beers in that brewers collection, but this one is good. Nothing to really freak out about, but a solid beer, very drinkable, something a little different for an avid dark beer fan."
"A solid beer at a solid price from a solid brewery. What more you want?"
""
"O: My least favorite from Sam Adams so far. It seems to follow style, but this really isn't that drinkable or good in my opinion."
""
""
"D - Easy drinker for sure."
""
""
"Overall it's very drinkable but decidedly average."
""
""
""
"A nice beer. It is very light and refreshing yet enjoyable with enough flavor to keep it interesting. It's nice that such a common brewery has brewed a style that is rather uncommon."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It was a good match with some egg rolls and duck sauce."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a very dark amber, almost black. Smells of a coffee with toffee, pretty sweet, but not that strong. Tastes of coffee, but not overly strong, and a little toffee notes. Very pleasant. Carbonation is light which leads to a smooth finish. Overall, a very good beer."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. It is a great toned-down version of a classic stout. There isn't a better term than ""Black Lager"". Bitter yet still a little sweet, refreshing, and finishes moderately. Good beer!"
""
""
"O - Pleasantly surprised with this one! Highly drinkable and not too high on the ABV makes this is great widely available brew. Great job Sam Adams!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really good beer and great for the style. A pretty easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyed this one...taste is reminiscent of many stouts but has a somewhat lighter character which sets it apart from those beers...very drinkable and would definitely have again"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It needs some work. A good foundation, but that's all it is at this point."
"One of the better schwarzes I've come across in bottled form."
"Very organized flavors. Rich and robust for just 4.90 ABV! A great session beer anytime of the year. I can't believe I waited so long to try this."
"Overall a solid showing. Goes down easy but still has considerable character. The roastyness and maltyness really stand out in this beer."
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable beer, one of my favorites from Boston Beer Co."
""
"O- good brew that did not let down in the mixer. I could definitely come back to these"
"Pretty solid black tone, purpleish in light, good beige head, great lacing on the sip. Smell is mostly a burnt malt with a fatty sweetness to it. Faint herbal hop characters but barely. Taste is balanced but a bit plain, just some burnt malt and a bit high on carb. Overall missing something"
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice beer. I have only had a few schwarzbiers before and this one was cleaner and maltier than the others i've had. My favorite part of this one is that the chocolate and roast really only added to a really solid malt backbone. A lot of malt flavor packed into a low abv, crisp lager."
"A very respectable dark lager. Nicely balanced and easy drinking."
""
""
"A nice beer that is part of the sampler pack. I really enjoyed it and will have no problem finishing off the rest from the sampler pack. This should be their winter beer, better than the Winter Lager."
"This is a filling beer. Tastes good, a little sweet but not too sweet. I would like more roasted flavor. This is a quality beer I would enjoy drinking and would be proud to give to a friend."
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid drinker. It tastes alright and goes down easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Balance: not heavy, not light; not bitter, not sweet; not complex, not simple. I think Koch and the crew got it right. I've always liked this beer. Since I think smell is a lesser category overall boosts to a 4. At 4.9 it makes a great session beer. Cheers."
""
""
"Drinkability- I thought this was very good. Very refreshing and very smooth. Very good"
""
"Overall, not bad, the flavor is present but finishes a bit watery. Very easy drinking schwarzbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: a nice, drinkable Schwarzbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: A fine beer. But by craft beer standards? It's pretty mediocre. I'd have another, but I won't specifically seek this out."
"O: Before I really got into craft beer full-time, I used to always say that this was my favorite from the SA mix packs. I'm happy to report that after about 1,000,000 beers later, this one still has it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would probably not go looking for this one again. It's perfectly fine but there are better schwarzbiers out there."
""
""
""
"It's great to see my dad branching out a little bit in his beer purchases, and I'm excited to be able to show him a little bit of the BA world. This beer reminds me that I really do need to take the time to review more Sam Adams offerings: I am very rarely disappointed with the quality of their beers, and my experience with their Black Lager is no exception."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours almost completely black, with just a thin white head, a little lace. Smell bakers chocolate, biscuit, and carmel. Taste is mainly the chocolate, very one dimensional. Body is very thin for a chocolate tasting beer, lots of carbonation, lush, and very drinkable. This is a very simple strait forward beer, probably a good beer to start off your craft beer adventure."
""
""
""
"Smells of dark fruit and burnt coffee. pours a pretty clear brown color with amber tints and a massive fluffy off white head. thin mouthfeel but the flavors are good and well blended. nice thin caramel and chocolate flavors on the side of the mouth with a very modest clean finish of coffee and balancing hops. very good in flavors that are blended together well but the watery body doesn't do justice to how much better it could've. balance is there and all it just needs a richer body. The thinness of the beer really hurt this one unfortunately."
"O: a pretty good brew, taste was not as deep as i had expected from the nose but it was still nice, carbonation was far too intense in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - a fine beer, not one that I would seek out on its own but I'm okay with a couple thrown into the variety packs from time to time"
""
""
""
"Overall - Among the better Sam Adams beers, for sure. Definitely the best in the Brewer's Choice 12-pack."
""
""
"Onto the beer. Black in color as the name suggestions. Great head. Looks very similar to a stout. The nose is malty which I was expecting, with some light molasses or perhaps honey scent. Light, but pleasant. I love the taste of this. For 4.9% alcohol, this feels like a very full beer, like there is a lot going on with it. Initially a very sweet malt taste, and as it goes down, the taste leads to some subtle hoppy bitterness, and ends with a smokey whiskey style taste. Love the taste. Mouthfeel has some good carbonation that perfectly fits what this is going for. Definitely will get this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 4.5/5 - A very tasty schwarzbier that hits you with roasted-ness from all sides. It could possibly have more depth, for a 4.9% ABV brew, this one hits the mark."
""
""
"O: This is one of the best Black Lagers I have ever had. Black Lagers for sure aren't my favorite, but this one is solid and I could drink think a lot."
""
""
"D/O: This beer sets a metered pace early and maintains it to a successful, but not very adventurous, resolution. In a style as traditional as schwarzbeer, such a practiced but reverential hand is appreciated when it comes to matters of concept as well as execution. Neither apologetic nor challenging, this beer maintains a sweet spot of appeal that could change a lot of casual minds about darker styles."
""
"Overall - If it wasn't for the very bitter aftertaste it would be one quite tasty beer. If you are a fan of roasted bitter though, this may be for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Personal Note: Awesome with crackers, Swiss cheese, crispy fried garlic and Dijon."
"Overall: This beer fits its style well. Itâ€™s not one of my favorite styles but taking this beer for what itâ€™s worth makes it very good."
"Overall this is fairly tasty, but needs some more flavors to break up the toasty mineral flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is dark, no really dark. Smell is very toasty. Mouthfeel is heavy on the tongue, this does linger a while. Taste is more like a light porter. The toasted malts are nicely balanced with the carmel and chocolate malts. Overall this is a nice brew, but we feel is miss labled."
"O - Black Lager is a solid Schwarz."
"O -- Overall, Sam Adams nails the style pretty handily. Smooth and roasty like you'd expect from the style and just what you'd be looking for if you asked for a Schwarzbier. Yet another 4.9% beer with a ton of character."
""
"Overall, this was one I was surprised by. None of its aspects stands out, but a very solid brew when all put together."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent malty flavored brew with a little sweetness. Nothing about this beer is groundbreaking or special. Worth a drink if you want a mild malty beer but other then that, i could care less to drink this beer."

"Overall not bad but kinda lackluster. That weird flavoring like hazelnut addition takes away a bit, and the lack of clean crisp fruity lager flavors doesn't help either, more like a lighter porter."

"Pours a very dark brown color with a fluffy head that disapates gradually. In the scent, I'm picking up some roasted robust malts, sweet carmal malts, and some toffee. The boldness relaly hits the taste buds. I'm getting some chalky roasted malts and a slighty nutty flavors with a little bit of bitter finish. Drinks quite well on a cold night. The texture could be a little thicker though and if it had a few more bolder elements, this beer would be getting some 4.5's and 5's."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a SA pint glass. This pours a dark brown with a decent tan head. The smells are somewhat light, some roasted and bread malts. Feel is medium. The taste is good, much lighter than a stout, but a nice lighter flavored roasted malt flavor."
"Overall: This is just ""OK"". It tastes like Boston Lager - hops + food dye. Its not bad, but if your going to make a black lager, give it some character!"
"Flavors are very rich for a SA lager, caramel and chocolate malts , a light roasted malt background and some earthy notes coming from the hops."
"O: good for the style and good for me"
"This is a very tasty beer. If you want to impress a newby to the beer world with a nice dark beer this is a good choice."
"This is a good one - could kick back with this all day long."
"O: This is a nice drinkable brew that gives a little extra on the backside. The bitter/sour flavor is nice and lingers a bit."
"It has a light and crisp taste that european versions of this are sometimes missing. The aroma isn't particularly strong, but it is nice. I want more!"
"Overall- It isn't a bad beer, but the hops need to be more present and there is just something off about the finish. It is so close to being really good."
"D - Very drinkable. Pretty solid Dark Lager. Could have used a bit more flavor, but what is there is fairly nice and balanced."
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected or the style with a good balance of crisp, earthy hops and sweet malt notes. Slightly smokey but not burnt or overly roasted. A nice dry, bitter hop presence up front with good puny flavor lingers troughout and provides nice balance. This is followsd by the sweet, slightly roasted malt presence that gives off hints of caramel, toffee, hazelnut and toast. Not overly complex but well balance, flavorful and easy to drink. One of the better Sam Adams offerings I've tried."
"O - A good beer with a nice flavor, personally, I would like the flavor be a bit more heavy. As it warms, the flavor does come out more, though still mild. Overall, a refreshing brew to have in the cooler seasons."
"Much different than the color, this beer is nothing like a stout. This beer is very light in body and very drinkable. It has a very tasty light flavor and I would highly recommend it to try."
"O: Overall a good beer. rather versatile as well. It has the taste to make it more hardy but the body to make it just as refreshing."
"Overall: A solid take on the style. The dark malts are rich and balanced."
"This was a decent schwarzbier. Not the best I've had, but far from the worst. It could use more complexity in the aroma and taste, but in general, this is acceptable."
"O: Overall a nice dark lager. There is a nice roasted note with caramel flavors, and is easy drinking and light."
"My favorite of the five I tried in the Harvest Collection (didnâ€™t count the original Samuel Adams beer). Nice smooth, dark beer."
"Nothing particularly enjoyable about this, and the overly roasted, char notes are fairly unpleasant."
"O: Well, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this is the beer equivalent of cola. That's actually a compliment, as it still tastes like a proper beer at the end of the day. I'd definitely have it again."
"O- I think it's a easy going beer. Nothing to complex. One of the better ones in the Sam Adams fall pack. Will buy again next fall."
"Overall its a decent beer. Taste isnt as full as it could be. I could see this beer being better with some tweeking, but hey, i'm no brewer. Not a bad beer to toss in a mix pack but I probably wont buy any singles or 6 packs."
"Overall: A good beer. I like th ecomplexity of flavors, just wish the aroma was as inticing. One of the better lagers I've had. Full of flavor."
"SKÃ…L!"
"The Samuel Adams Black Lager is a solid dark lager. The appearance as poured into my pint glass was quite good. The color was a dark, nearly opaque, with rich red/amber hue. The head was thin and off-white...some lacing. The smell includes roast and sweet malt...like molassis. The taste had an interesting mixture of roast, malt, caramel, and hops. The combination lent to a spiciness. The mouthfeel is good. A nice beer for the cooler nights. Overall another decent creation by Sammy A!"
"Overall, not terrible. This is not one I'll be reaching for again, but it is not entirely undrinkable."
"I had a much longer review of this beer, but my connection cut out on me. Here's a smaller version of the original: Pours dark brown, black with a red hue in glass, thick tanned head. Aroma has caramel, smoke and coffee. Medium malted body, good sweetness. Some coffee notes comes through, but caramel and smoke dominates. Feel is a bit oily, also some dry feel. Finish has nice hop bitterness"
"D: Really not a complex beer at all, but it goes down easily enough. Â It's pretty well balanced between roasted malt and chocolate, slight bitterness and subtle sweetness. Â Goes down easily, but is overall forgettable. Â "
"O- A good sessionable beer."
"O: Ok. Nothing special. Light aroma and taste. Another beer to get your friends to try some darker beer."
"O: Very well-rounded representative of the style. Really kind of like a winterized light lager. The hops finish seems dumbed down just a bit to retain mass appeal, but a good brew nonetheless."
"not a bad sessionable beer, one of my more favorites in the sam adams 12 packs, but im having a hard time determining if this really a lager or not. definatly not something i would drink too often, kind of like a weak brown ale."
"Overall - Based on the smell, I wasn't expecting much, but this is actually a pretty solid schwarzbier here. Very drinkable and sooth. Would be an ideal session beer."
"O - The Black Lager is an easy drinker, and was an enjoyable, ""good"" beer. It is a solid, though not shining example."
"Cheers!!"
"Pours out a black hue with rubyred highlights that has nice lacing and retention. Dark fruits, chocolate, toffee and some burnt roast gives it a pleasant nose. I get some chocolate, toffee followed by some dark fruits, burnt roast taste in the back with some hints of caramel and citrus hops. Very yummy and well balanced with a nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel that has a dry finished. One of the best beers I've had from Sam Adams. Yummy yummy yummy!"
"Dr: It's very easy to drink but is also bland. The ABV is average. As a schwarzbier, I guess it's a minute success. I won't be purchasing it again."
"O: A good beer. very drinkable. It's also nice because it's so different. Worth checking out."
"This was one of my favorites, back in the days before I drank mostly craft. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my n'Ice Chouffe goblet. Dark cola colored. Almost zero head. No lacing. On the nose, bitter coffee, lots of prominent malt, some light milk chocolate. Not much hop to speak of. A little bit of smoke. On the palate, more of the same. Sour and bitter coffee. The smoke is more prevalent. Lots of malt, but it's dry, not sweet at all. The flavor is almost that of a stout mixed with club soda, which is pretty true to style. Very bubbly. Good beer. Nothing stellar, but one of the better Sam Adams offerings."
"O - Another from the fall pack from Sam Adams. Very middle of the road beer. Just not a lot to say about this. It is what it is."
"Overall: Easy to drink, but not as good as I used to think it was. A good beer if you don't want to pay too much attention to what you're drinking. Pleasant."
"Pretty nice schwartzbier. Glad they packed it into their Autumn Sampler."
"Overall I think it's drinkable but I think I'd rather just get a good porter."
"O-Of the the Schwarzbiers this one is the best so far. Gotta love SA for making some of the lesser known styles and making them well to get into the style."
"A solid black brown color with a reasonable sized light creamy tan head and good lacing. The nose finds deep nutty malt with a hint of molasses. Decent and relatively simple. The tongue detects lots more malt and molasses with raisin apricot hints. This is a medium bodied brew with a smooth, well carbonated and easy drinking feel. I get some brown bread and a vague charcoal ingredient. Itâ€™s a very serviceable brew."
"This beer doesn't amaze me, but it is solid and tasty. The problem is this beer is a tweener; it has just enough flavor to be on the sweet side and therefore loses drinkability, but doesn't have enough flavor to leave a lasting impression."
"Taking the good with the bad, this is pretty all right. I expect no less from Sam Adams."
"Overall a nice drinking beer, easily sessionable, appropriate any time."
"O - Not at all what I was expecting. This beer is fantastic. It's a stout in lager form essentially. I have never had anything in this style before, so my ratings are purely on a self-biased scale, but once I get more from this style, I'll be sure to re-review it within it's own style."
"Damn, that is tasty. A good lager for cooler weather."
"o - a solid beer overall. goes down easy and would make a good candidate for a drinking session. one of sam adams better beers imho."
"	First sip gives me a lot of that maltiness. Itâ€™s rich, but not heavy. Not thin bodied, either, but somewhere in between say a porter and a brown or amber ale. I definitely get a front-loaded sweetness that turns dry on the end. Itâ€™s well carbonated, and the carbonation keeps it from feeling heavy in spite of the malt body. I donâ€™t expect any hop profile but Iâ€™m trying to pick up on the Bavarian Noble hops the label identifies, just for my own edification. Iâ€™d finish the night with this one but I wouldnâ€™t have two in a row."
"Overall: I'm not one to hate on Sam Adams, far from it. The Irish Red in this pack was ok, and the Oktoberfest, Rauchbier, and Pumpkin Ale were enjoyable. This one just doesn't do it for me though. There isn't the nice Munich toasty background, nor the roast intensity that make the good German schwartzbiers, and this tastes more like an ale, with the estery profile. It's not a BAD beer, per se, but I don't see myself ever buying a sixer of it (unlike Sam's Cream Stout, which is pretty tasty)."
"Overall: Good beer with nice taste and good drinkability. Not exceptional, but still a good beer."
"(Notes from 14/9.)"
"A good way to start off the variety pack. Color me imoressed."
"O- This is a solid offereing that I'm proud to drink and can handle quite a bit of."
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the bee pours a ruby-highlighted, very dark brown with a chuny, dense, foamy biege head that starts at a robust two and a half inches but eventually settles into a quarter inch. Aromas are rich and robust, with a heavy sour malt and toasted oats balance. The beer has some interesting flavors, with rich and darkly sweet malt profiles of chocolate and molasses, and a bitter coffee character that balances, along with some roasted highlights. The beer leaves a decent, light lacing along the glass while you drink. The aftertaste is mostly coffee, with a slight linger to the dry-roast taste, and the beer has a tangy, mid-lingering finish. Decent beer."
"O - A good dark lager, if you are in for smokey flavored beers. Something is missing from it being truly outstanding, but worth a try."
"Overall - A very good beer. This could easily become one of my favorites."
"A pretty good brew. The fall variety pack is pretty good this year, and this one adds nicely to the selections."
"The strange smell is weird to me. I never smell something like that, so I really can't describe the smell, but I am sure it tastes better than smell. Somehow I think the smell of this better is horrible. For taste, there is indeed some after taste of little bitterness, and that is it."
"overall - When I see a black beer, I expect something heavier like a stout. I don't think I've had a Schwarzbier before so I don't have a baseline to compare it too, but it was a decent beer. A little more balance to the sweetness would have been nice."
"I really like this style and this is a good representation. Complex and dark flavors yet still crisp and highly drinkable. Well done."
"O - Overall a good tasty lager close to a lighter porter, you could almost call this a porter but I know its different... but how? A little watery and lighter coco/roast maybe. Came with the ""Harvest Pack""!"
"O- Another enjoyable beer from the BBC. They may not do anything remarkably well, but they do everything well enough. Clean and refreshing for something with so much roasted malty goodness, sessionable for the right tastes."
"o- very drinkable, light but perfect for a traditional schwartzbeer. Great black lager."
"O - A decent schwarzbier. Has the light & refreshing qualities of a typical lager, but with a nice light roasty quality to it."
"Overall this is an OK beer with nothing standing out. The Saranac Black Forest I reviewed yesterday was definitely a step above this one."
"O - Very nice for the style. Clean and crisp, yet rich and flavorful. One of the better Sam outings."
"O: A good stab at a schwarzbier. It could definitely be darker, although the malt level is good where it is. Overall, though, I like where it stands in terms of being balanced between the malts and hops"
"Pours a dark black color that show red edges when held up to light. Small, grayish head that disappears quickly. Scent is pleasant malt aromas with a bit of roasted chocolate scents. Taste is a bit spicy with some tasty chocolate and caramel malt flavors. Very smooth roasted flavors as well...a bit nutty. Mouthfeel is light bodied, but with deep, dark characteristics. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is one tasty lager."
"O-solid beer that is not overpowering in any area"
"the sam adams black lager is a rich a hearty beer. The coloris a deep black with crimson low lights and a nice tan head. The smell is of rich chocolate barley. Taste like chocolate and lightly smoked malt. The finish is surprisingly mild and that makes it more drinkable that some dark lagers. People that are scared of dark beers should give this one a try it's much less harsh than some out there."
"A nice combination of sweet and roasted malts in the nose, also some chocolaty mocha hints. A bit more of a roast character on the tongue, but nice. Still pick up on the sweetness especially in the finish, and as it warms. A smooth, medium body with pleasant carbonation."
"Finishes with clean hop bitterness that leaves palate dry and refreshed. Dark unsweetened chocolate notes linger through the end of the finish."
"Easily my favorite out of the fall pack thus far, showcasing a solid take on a rather rare beer style. Cheers!"
"O: Cheers to this tasty black lager."
"Not a bad schwarzbier. Drinkable and flavorful. Sam Adams actually puts together something nice and true to style here."
"Overall fairly decent and surprising, tastes like a schwarzbeir to me and not too bad for one either."
"Drinkability/overall- i found this beer to be quite easily drinkable and had a good level balance and though not really highly complex i did enjoy it, if looking for a smokey roasted black lager this would be worth a look"
"This bottle from current Harvest Collection freshness dated Jan. 2012"
"Overall a pretty good beer from Sam Adams which I have had a few times over the years and always pretty good not great."
"O-Nice thick dark beer. I enjoyed having this in the Harvest Collection 12 pack."
"Overall â€“ I really enjoyed this beer. The flavour was well balanced and it was incredibly easy to drink. I could put back a few of these in one sitting with no issues. I'd buy it again, especially during the fall."
"O - I like it. great fall or winter beer."
"O- This is one of my favorite beers in Sam Adam's lineup. I'm not sure why more craft brewers don't have a go at the style, but I would like to see that change."
"One of my favorite American Schwarzbiers. I recommend this to anyone who want to try a dark beer but is not ready for a heavy roasted coffee and big hoppiness of most stouts and porters."
"Final Thoughts: Pretty good and of the style if I remember it correctly. It's worth the buy."
"O - Overall a nice Schwarzbier. A style I greatly enjoy, and a perfectly adequate take on it."
"Samuel Adams has crafted a tasty black lager here. When the temps drop again, Iâ€™ll be sure to pick up more of these."
"M - Extremely smooth good carbonation very pleasent on a warm Florida night."
"Overall, a tasty and satisfying dark beer. Not too heavy, but probably not a beer you would want to drink a whole lot of either."
"Poured an opaque coffee black, a nice two or three fingers of foamy, tan head that retains and laces well. Good aroma of dark roasty malts, chocolate tones. Taste starts out on the sweet side, chocolatey, roasty, brown sugar, with a transition to coffee bitterness which comes out mid-drink. Some hoppiness, but the malts are clearly in command. Bitter aftertaste, medium mouthfeel, and quite easily drinkable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Dark blak beer with a rapidly fading creamy head.Aroma is cocoa and weak coffee.Taste is chocolate,coffee,sweet cream and a pinch of caramel.Overall a pretty good beer that despite it's dark color is probably best suited for the warmer months.I would recommend and would purchase again."
"Samuel Adams Black Lager is overall a pretty good beer. It has a solid one inch thick head with a deep black/amber color. It doesn't feel as heavy as the color would suggest. The Black Lager has a smooth finish with a raisin like after taste. The first thing that I notice about the flavor is mocha. This beer reminds me a lot of prune juice. At first it may not be very enjoyable to some but it quickly grows on you. I may not buy it again but I am glad that I did at least once."
"Other than mouthfeel this is a pretty good beer."
"a nice soft beer. big mouth feel, but the carbonation lends it a softness. a teddy bear in a glass."
"Pours a nice dark caramel color in the light and dark black color not in direct light. thick creamy tan head that hangs on for a good long time. Smells nice and malty with some sweet and skunky notes. Very malty and subtle sweet flavors. Has that good punchy roasted taste to round out for that familiar black beer flavor. A perfect amount of carbonation really finishes this one off. I am very impressed and as usual Samuel Adams keeps me coming back for more."
"This beer pours out as a really deep brown color with a pretty strong head on it. The aromas of some roasted malts and caramel are on the nose along with some hops. The taste of the beer has a good bitterness to it. There's a light burnt flavor in there too. The mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I expected. Overall pretty good beer."
"Final Notes: Pretty good beer, but nothing spectacular. Very sessionable and pretty ""run-of-the-mill."" Great introduction to the world of dark beer for beginners."
"Very solid beer! This is a great choice if you want the feel and taste of a traditional stout without the heavier body (as a black lager should be)."
"Becoming even more delightful as the beer warms up to a proper temperature."
"Dark brown with reddish edges and an off white head that lasts. Weak aroma of cinnamon, prunes, medicinal notes, maple. Tastes of maple, cinnamon, prunes, some hop presence toward the finish but a lasting medicinal tang takes over in the aftertaste. Light body with medium carbonation. Tangy with spice but a lil too much."
"This is a pleasant dark lager. I was surprised by the burnt taste of the hops and thought that it brought a nice flavor addition to what would have been a normal lager. It seemed to be a nice mix of my two favorite beers, stouts and lagers. I enjoyed this beer and will miss it when I finish the 6 pack."
"Got this from a bottle. Very dark pour with a nice beige head. No lacing to speak of. Slight malt aroma. Beer has a crisp chocolate/caramel taste with no real noticeable finish. Solid Lager, one of the best I have had in a while, would definitely buy again."
"Overall a nice refreshing brew that has an aftertaste that reminded me of a smooth porter. It lack a decent head and a little thin on the mouthfeel or I would have reviewed higher, but the taste was very nice indeed."
"Overall: Very good, reminds you of a stout or porter, but with some differences. I appreciate Boston Beer Co. producing an uncommon style like this, and doing a good job with it."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer pours a dark brown color. It produced a decent off white head with above average head retention. Very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of the Schwarzbier had notes of burnt malt, caramel and chocolate. It has a nice medium body and is malty and hints of carmel. There was also some sweetness that balanced this beer out. This is a nice example of a Schwarzbier- It is a little sweet but it would be a great ""starter"" beer to give someone. This will work for a warm spring or summer weekend."
"Back in the day, I used to enjoy this one more when it was warm than cold, but I'm gonna start off on the latter end of the spectrum this time. Shits and giggles, y'see. It pours a dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of slightly dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises toasted toffee, plenty o' cocoa, and a touch of light coffee. The taste doesn't deviate too far from this, though the cocoa is definitely dominant here (especially as it warms, making a sort of light version of a milk stout after a while). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice schwarz, one of the best regulars Sam Adams puts out."
"Pours a two finger tan creamy head. Mostly black filtered clear body. Smells yeasty, sweet, some dark chocolate and coffee. Tastes sweet and toffee, coffee, roasty malts, some earthy hops. Medium/thin body, medium carbonation. Some lingering hop and roasty bitterness. Overall this doesn't sit too well for me. The roasted/sweet/thin body combination doesn't work well. This needs more body and Carmel malts for me. I barely finished the bottle. $8.50 a sixer, oh well it'll sit around for some friends to try."
"Not sure if I would put this in the ""Brewmasters Collection"" sixes, as Sam has a lot more to offer than this. Overall not bad, but by no means great either."
"Overall - My senses and consciousness are conflicted with complexity versus simplicity"
"This beer produced mixed results for me, it looked and smelled great of chocolate and caramel, however, I tasted it and found that it lacked some flavor and ended being slightly thinner than expected. I'm not entirely let down though, and I would buy it though I hope that it could be improved."
"One of my two favorite Black Beers, the other being the *retired* Orilo organic black lager. One of the top five beers from Sam Adams. Nicely done!"
"Overall: I am pretty impressed. It is a very easy drinking schwarzbier and I can foresee it being utilized in many food pairings."
"O: This was one of my first Schwarzbiers, but I found it to be quite enjoyable and still do."
"This is not something to recommend to anybody without wasting their money"
"Poured black in color with a small light brown head that dissapated in seconds with fair lacing. The aroma was very light with a hint of roasted coffee malts and a light doughy yeast scent. It tasted of burnt coffee slightly sweet with a bitter finish that stayed with you for a while. Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with an oily texture but quite creamy. Overall qiute a nice tasting brew."
"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.9%. Not entirely black colour, rather very dark brown. Thick beige head. Moderate but nice aroma of dark bread, roasted malts and herbal German hops. The flavour is moderately roasty with just a modest sweetness, could be called medium dry. A slight acidity in the finish, more bittering hops would be desirable. Decent enough to drink, but not very exciting."
"D: easy to drink, but from what i have read not the greatest example of the style."
"Light-bodied, and more than drinkable. I'd compare this one to a light stout, maybe. A tasty sessioner here."
"More malty than hops, good color an feel. Easy to drink several on a hot summer day. Much better than the macro breweries offers."
"RJT"
"D: I think this is the typical US take on the Black Lager style. Sort of a light, low gravity, understated Baltic Porter. Mostly just in flavor/aroma profile - it does not have the heft & bulk of a real porter. Flavorful & refreshing."
"D- very drinkable. I like this one"
"Verdict: Still a solid beer by my count, the faith I placed in Sam Adams Black Lager as a beer newbie seems to have been well placed. It's nicely roasty, deep enough to hold your attention, and easily quaffable."
"Low carbonation but a medium/heavy body. Goes down smooth and quickly."
"In closing, this is a nice introduction to dark lagers and is worth picking up on your next beer run."
"Notes: I have never had a bad Sam Adams brew, and the Black Lager is no exception. I have read that black lager is typically light in character, so perhaps the flavor is true to the style. For me, after tasting, I would pass this one up for another style."
"Drinkability - This ale went down nice but could use a little bitterness from the hops or the roasted malt or barley."
"Despite its flaws, Black Lager is drinkable beer for those people who want the that roasted malt flavor without drinking stout or porter."
"Pours a nice two finger head, very pillowy and creamy looking. Smell is very malty, I might detect hints of chocolate notes, but it is very distant. In the taste you get a lot of malts, in the back end you get a slight taste of coffee, which is nice. The mouthfeel is very plain, it almost feels like I'm drinking carbonated water. This beer feels a little too carbonated for the style. The flavor would taste like I'm drinking carbonated water as well, except for the malts and other notes I get. Very average beer."
"Both the mouthfeel and drinkability are good, it's crisp and fairly refreshing for the ""darker"" flavors presented here. Again, it reminds me of Boston Lager in some strange way - this is almost a ""porter-ized"" version of Boston Lager - roast the malts and throw in some coffee and chocolate, and there you go, Sam Adams Black Lager!"
"Sam Adams Black Lager is my first venture into the Schwarz bier style. I enjoyed it...much like a light porter. Black Lager is a nice alternative brew [to Porters and Stouts] for the late fall and winter months."
"Picked up in a mix six pack hope this turns out better than the other two. Poured a nice black ruby color with decent head that was a creamy thick off white color. Smell was toasted and caramel malts maybe a bit of roast. Taste is muted chocolate bit of roasted grain, and dominated by caramel malt. Descent mouthfeel creamy and smooth could be a little bit smoother. Drinkability is nice good refreshing beer."
"I picked this one up in a mixed sixie last week, and I actually had some pretty decently high hopes for it; sadly it let me down. Poured a dark brown color, with a decent light tan head. Lightly roasted malt, decent quality chocolate and some coffee on the nose. Light bodied, with lightly roasted malt, generic chocolate and coffee."
"This was a decent choice in brews that I got in the variety pack from Sam Adams. Pours a nice dark color with a little foamy head that disappears pretty quickly. Not much lacing down the sides of the glass. Didn't really care for the taste as much as other black lagers I've had. It just seemed a bit dumbed down from where I would have liked it to be. If you're looking for an intense flavor this one isn't your beer but it does have a nice flavor considering the style."
"The taste is smooth no harsh carbonation at all. The carbonation is light and buttery on the tongue, much like a well poured nitro stout. The flavor is light roasted barley starts with a sweet malt, the roasted flavor remains throughout and finishes with a coffee bitterness and is dry at the end."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation. Would have liked a little creamier. Its fine, nothing to write home about, but decent enough."
"Beer is thin with a mild roastiness at the back end of the palate, otherwise it's a plain Jane beer. I just don't get much from it, it is unoffensive just not very interesting."
"I'm going by memory on this one but I remember it pretty well. It looked like a porter and smelled of one too. The only thing that separated this and a porter was that this had a thinner mouthfeel and wasn't as thick in body and flavor. It's like in between a brown ale and a porter really. Very nice almost coffee like roasted malt smell and taste. It ends with a tiny bit of Noble hops to match up with the subtle bitterness coming from the roasted dark coffee like malt. Its a very smooth beer that goes down too easily. If you want a dark beer that you can actually have a session with this is your beer most definitely."
"D- On the creamy and roasted side, but slightly watery. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this Sam Adams selection - what a well balanced schwarzbier, with sufficient complexity to make it one of the most worthy of the style."
"I think this is a good example of a schwarzbier to be enjoyed in the cold winter months."
"This is a must try."
"D: Not a bad quaff, but again, and as with many of BBCs beers, I'll save any purchases for a desperate situation, and probably enjoy the hell out of it at that time."
"D - goes down easily. Not too fizzy -- helps here more than it hurts the mouthfeel. Tasty, with character, but never heavy. Totally sessionable if youre into the style."
"D: Very drinkable. Reminds me a little of some non-complex Stouts. Good brew!"
"12 oz bottle. Pour was dark brown with a small tan head. Nose is roasted malt, spicy hops with some coffee and chocolate notes. Medium to full smooth body. Flavors begin with sweet roasted malts, chocolate and some earthy hops, while finish is dry with coffee notes. Quite tasty beer from SA."
"The beer pours a black color with an off-white head. The aroma is very nice. I get some chocolate, roasted malt and a nuttyness. The flavor is heavy on the chocolate and roasted malt, but I also get a little burnt character as well as some cream notes. The beer is a lot sweeter than I expected it to be, but there is a nice bit of bitterness from the hops and burnt malt at the end. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very enjoyable."
"Definitely one of the better black lager beers Ive had in some time. Sam Adams almost always produces a great beer. This beer is smoooth. Not a high ABV for a darker beer, the perfect amont of head, a sweet aroma, and leaves a nice taste on your tongue, but not a bitter aftertaste. Id definitely recommend it, and will check it out again at a later date."
"Almost black beer with a one finger head from the pour. Head is light brown in color, thick foam that evaporated in less than a minute. Tight lace that has little cling. Color is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart, can't get any darker than that, although with a strong light shining through the brew, it is actually a very dark reddish brown. Smells of a hint of caramel, coffee, chocolate, sweet burnt malt, and roasted wheat. Flavor is bold but not overpowering. Sort of a sweet coffee taste with caramel and chocolate. The malt flavor seems to have some cinnamon hints. A little wimpy in my mouth, some sense of fullness, but just not quite the zip I was hoping to feel. The flavor grows on me as I work the level in my glass south. Might have to have another to fully appreciate the flavors."
"This was a bit of a treat, nice and pleasant."
"D- another beer that i could easily sit back and enjoy a six pack off. quite drinkable."
"Pours a very dark brown, slightly translucent. A nice tan head stays around. Smell is nicely toasted mocha, more sugary sweet than bitter. A surprising burst of citrusy hops starts the taste, and compliments the coffe-ish malts. nicely complex. Finishes bitter and nutty. Very tasty. Feel is creamy and smooth, this brew is easy to drink. One of my faves from Sam Adams."
"Drinkability - This is not one of my favorite Sam Adams brews, nor is it one of my favorite styles. This is a beer I can finish, but would probably not go for round two. Every time I took a drink, I continually got the ""buttermilk"" scent. I didn't care for that. Others may enjoy this beer, however I don't think I will try this again."
" Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!"
"D: A good one from Sam. Can't say it's fantastic but it's a good sessionable brew."
"D - I'm actually very impressed by this offering from Sam Adams, I didn't expect this to impress me as it has. Excellent flavor combined with a low ABV makes this a very sessionable beer. I would certainly recommend this to any of my friends."
"Pours dark brown almost black. Nice lasting tan head. Aroma of malts, caramel, hops. Taste is malts, caramel, some coffee, chocolate. Palate some good carboantion, nice medium to full body smooth beer, Finish is malty, caramel.This a very flavorfull beer. Would drink again. I really enjoyed this brew."
"I tried this one a while back and found it undesirable. Now that my taste is more refined I find it, well, somewhat tolerable. It's look is peculiar with the side edges of my perfect pour glass red and the bottom edge brown. There's a thick finger of foam that lasts a few minutes. The aroma is very feint, just a hint of sweet malt. The taste is mild malty but turns slightly sour at the end that throws of my taste buds. I didn't bother to finish the glass because it just wasn't that enjoyable. I'll probably give away my other bottle."
"D: Overall very ""meh."" I liked it but some much of the roasted flavors reminded me too much of barbequed vegetables and corn. The only other beer of this style, Xingu, was much better."
"Spot on the style, and one I really enjoy. Hops waft from this opaque black coloured elixir, with generous light brown head that leads a mastery of spider lacing. More roast in aroma and taste, as the beer settles. Very drinkable. Enjoyed in The Samuel Adams Glass.Middling mouthfeel. SUitable carbonation."
"This is a good tasting beer with a nice mouthfeel, but they both disappear way to quickly. It's as if my mouth absorbs it all and there is nothing left to swallow. This beer has potential but I would like the taste and mouthfeel to last longer."
"This beer pours a dark black, but has an amber hue to it. The head is a frothy white, and seemed to last for awhile. The smell of this beer is of roasted malts. The taste is of burnt roasted malts, hint of coffee. There is a well balanced hop flavor with it. The mouthfeel is medium light. I would say this is a drinkable beer."
"Poured a nice, deep black/deep garnet with hues of such in the light. A modest off white head that didn't lace much and diminished quickly into a bubbly ring. Light fruitiness, touch of metallic, and subtle hints of chocolate, toast, and toffee. I guess the best way to describe all of this is ""delicate."" The taste is a touch more assertive, which I enjoy. It has more of a chocolate/carob character to it and caramel nicely supports it as well. Raisins come out in the finish, adorned by a slightest touch of coffee beans. Mouthfeel is somewhat slick and light with a nicely executed carbonation. Very smooth indeed. I was gonna give it a 3 but that carbonation is just spot on perfect IMO. A good, drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding or ""holy crap this is &%^%*#! awesome"" but not a yuck beer either. Something to grab at the end of a warm day in the middle of cooking up a steak or a burger."
"Notes: A fairly solid attempt at a swarzbier. Hop bitterness and flavor could be taken up just a notch. Mouthfeel ws a bit too thick for the style as well. Still a good beer. I wish more American brewers would brew Schwarzbiers."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer and could drink a few in a sitting."
"Pours a semi-translucent dark brown color with 2-finger off white head that left little to no lacing on the glass. The smell is that of dark roasted malts. There isn't really any hop presence in the smell. The taste is dominated by dark malts. There is a little hop presence at the finish, but not much. There are also some slight notes of chocolate and caramel. The mouthfeel is lighter than I thought it was going to be, and has medium carbonation. I think this is a pretty drinkable beer. It is my first beer of this style, and I look forward to trying more."
"Drinkability: Decent beer that I've enjoyed since Sam Adams started releasing it a few years ago. Not their best, but not their worst and I look forward to it in the variety packs."
"Black Lager--Brewmaster's Collection--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 4.90% ABV--25 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Black Lager--Pours a rich dense lacy tan good retention head. Clear dark black red ruby edge color. Roasted mild floral hop cocoa front. Malty rich dry sweet cloying lager smooth chocolate caramel roasted medium body. Smooth soft hop spice clean dry end. Big flavor.Mild fruit & Porter notes. Sampled 3/2/2010. 6-Pack $6.99."
"D: Decent drinkability. Has a slight crispness to it. Never had a Schwazbeir, so its hard to compare it to anything really. It is different than a porter or stout, thats for sure."
"Lots of roasted and chocolate malts. Coffee and caramel flavors compliment the big malty flavors very well. Very smooth and creamy, which gives a nice contrast to the roasted malts and coffee flavors. A little sweeter than some Schwarzbiers that I have had before, but not overpoweringly sweet, this beer has a nice balance of flavors, with no one of them being huge or overdone. The hop presence is noticable but not one of the key flavors in the beer; just a slight floral presence resting in the background. Medium bodied and mildly carbonated with an almost silky feeling on the tongue. Easy to drink."
"The beer went down pretty easily and quickly and I wouldn't mind having another. Typically I drink a stronger beer (2x-3x the ABV), but sometimes I can't make as much of a commitment to sucking down ethanol. The Harvest collection wasn't too bad, but I still see myself spending the money differently in the future."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. The ABV is well hidden overall. The only downfall is that the aroma is a little muted. Overall a good drinking beer by Sam Adams."
"Overall, I'm not the biggest fan of this. Maybe I don't like the style but this was just unpleasant at times to drink because of the dryness. Worth a drink if you get the variety pack."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a off light brown head of 3"" on top of a nice dark black body. I smell a a hint of chocolate. It has a great taste of chocolate and dark nuts and hops. Also taste as beer warms up is a little berry and hops. It is not as heavy as i thought and i think that makes it have a nice mouth feel and is drinkable."
"I'm not too familiar with this style, but I did enjoy this beer. It's enjoyable at all temperatures, as the transition seems to make certain characteristics stick out more than others all while retaining good balance. I expect quality beers from the folks at Sam Adams and this beer doesn't disappoint. I would have to compare it to other Black Lagers/Schwarzbeirs for a more accurate intra-style comparison, but I would definitely get this one again regardless of the outcome."
"I was not enamored with this beer. It pours great, looks great in the glass so I was expecting big things. However, for me, something is missing. It had a slight bitterness and a slight aftertaste that just didn't appeal to my taste buds. I could probably have a couple and maybe with a good heavy meal it might pair well. However, unless it was free, or the only thing available, I couldn't see myself having a session with this offering."
"D: A good representation of the style. I would drink it again."
"D - The smell seemed to die off as I drank the glass so it was not as off-putting as the first few drinks were. The carbonation was annoying too. Still, I liked the taste."
"Pours a deep amber to a black color with a tan head. In the aroma, light roasty coffee, yet still lager like. In the taste, hints of coffee, dry chocolate, and a hint of caramel sweetness. A small bite, with a light to medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee and light caramel stickiness in the aftertaste. Still quite lager-ish, ok, but nothing too exciting."
"Pretty nice little schwarzbier you've got here, Boston Beer Co. A fine example of the style. This is likely the highlight of the Brewmaster's Collection six-pack that I bought on-sale (other beers are the Irish Red and the Coastal Wheat)."
"D - Very enjoyable fall beer and very balanced overall. Would definitely like to get more in the future."
"D - Well I have a couple more but it was nice to succession a couple of these back to back. Would not be off putting to have again in a variety pack again."
"I got the Black Lager in the Sam Adams harvest collection and it was one of the ones i liked the most. i enjoyed the chocolate and coffee notes in it and i will probably pick up a 6 pack of i see it."
"Part of the Harvest Collection twelve pack. Poured into a stemmed beer glass. Dark brown color with an off-white head. Smell was very off putting. Had a buttery, sour smell to it. Almost like a hint of sulfur. Not a fan of the aroma. The beer did not taste bad though. Nice roasted coffee flavors with just a slight amount of bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was just thick enough so that it felt like it had a good body. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but the smell was disappointing. But I know I've had this beer in the past in six packs and liked it. So I'd probably buy it again sometime in the future."
"I was given this beer when visiting a buddy of mine. It pours a very dark color, but my assumption of a black lager was black, and I can sure as heck see some red in here. The aroma was a lot fainter that I would have anticipated. There are the smells of a dark roasted coffee as well as some chocolate notes. The taste has similar notes to the smell, and it is just as mild. I for some reason seem to taste a bit of corn syrup in the taste, though it may be due to the caramel roast being as weak as it is. It is not bitter at all as I would have expected and it seem to go down very easily. A nice light black lager if I do say so."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby, but the style itself is a bit plain to warrant too much excitement fro me; not heavy at all and a lower ABV certainly wouldn't prohibit this from being used as a session beer; I certainly wouldn't turn it down, but I likely wouldn't say, ""Oh, hey! Look! SA Black Lager! I'm gonna get me some!"""
"D- Nice fall session beer. Goes well with the harvest mix pack it comes it."
"D. I probably would not pick this up again. Its not bad but just not my kind of beer."
"Poured into my Sam Adams Pint Glass a Deep Dark Brown to Black in color with Tan/Creamy head. Aroma was of chocolate and caramel malts. Great chocolate and toasted caramel malt flavor.Very creamy smooth mouth feel, Medium body, and pleasant to the palate. Hops were there at the finish for a nice crisp clean ending, but still a nice malty aftertaste that left me wanting more. Not a typical German Schwarzbier, But Americanized wonderfully. I haven't bought this in yrs. I can't believe I didn't rate this yet, but my neighbor don't like it, so he gave it to me....Thanx Neighbor."
"This is a fairly drinkable darker beer, but it also has nothing much in common with dark beers except the color. I'm not huge on this one."
"D - Very drinkable beer. This particular bottle came out of the harvest pack but I would pick this up as a stand alone sixer for sure"
"Drinkability: By the time I got to the end of the glass, it was getting a little tough to finish. Having one would be good from time to time, but I couldn't drink it all the time."
"Pours a very dark brown with thick off-white head and nice lacing around the glass. Smells of some mild roasted malt and chocolate. Flavour has a nice bitterness and caramel sweetness with some of the roast coming through. Medium body, fairly smooth. Quite a nice black lager. I haven't had any other Schwarzbiers before, but I really enjoy this."
" D-Light enough to enjoy a few. Just boozy enough to relax and enjoy."
"D: Very drinkable as are most Samuel Adams beers. I think they are going for the buy a 6 pack or case and sit down and enjoy it finish to their beers. I really love to have these at relatively normal parties that way not to many people ask for one of your beers but the ones that do, you know will enjoy it."
"Drinkability - good brew and easy to drink and appreciate. Complex enough to enjoy, good tasting, and more toward the lighter side...less filling."
"Well it's not black but it's pretty close. dark chocolate brown with a light tan head. It's pretty good looking poured in the recommended flute (well not quite a flute, but a tall skinny ommegang glass). It's practically scentless. Taste is definitely more lager-esque than I expected. There really isn't any roasty, toastiness from the malts in this one. It's a bit on the sweet side. Light bodied. pretty drinkable actually, but its so ambiguous I don't know what to think. Not sure if the taste/look mismatch is in my head or if I've been drinking too many stouts but I can't get around the fact this one doesn't look like it tastes. It certainly isn't bad, so I can't fault it for that."
"A great beer. Enough going on to keep people interested and good flavour."
"A great choice if you want stout or porter flavors without a heavy-feeling beer. At only 4.9% this is light, but not too light, with nice flavors. It would be nice to be able to session a beer like this too. Probably my favorite Sam Adams."
"Overall I rarely find myself impressed with Samuel Adams brews but this one is right up there with latitude 48 as my favorite beers from them. A well balanced Schwarzbier."
"Pours a black color with a tan head, nice retention, no real lacing. Smells of decent malts and some hops. Tastes really smooth with some nice tasty malts -- a bit boozy (may have a bad batch). Mouthfeel medium, but pretty nice. Overall a fairly bad beer."
"Nice take on the Schwarzbier style with enough dark malt to add some real complexity to the finish. I found it pretty drinkable though I was glad it was part of a mixed case as the sweetness gets to stick to your palate. Sam Adams usually does a good job of creating solid offerings"
"D - not a bad beer, just missing a little control and refinement. this style continues to blow my mind with its bold flavors and light body. a good welcome change-up in the SA mixers."
"Drinkability is exceptional. It is not often I find a beer I want to quaff massive quantities of... Sweet!"
"This is a pretty drinkable beer. I don't think I'd want more than these 12 ounces, as the stickiness and coating may begin to bother me. I think I'll need a glass of water after consuming this beer. I am glad that there is a second bottle in the mix pack, because I will want to revisit this beer soon. It has also inspired me to seek out more beers of this style, as I think there is a lot of potential for some great black lagers."
"12oz bottle poured into River Horse pint glass for lunch. Poured a dark redish brown color with small head. To me it has a strong barley smell and taste. I love dark beers but this one doesn't do it for me. I can drink it but I choose not to. Maybe I need a little more black lager experience."
"The beer comes on a little light on the front end but grows as you hold on to it. The coffee and chocolate flavors hit the back of the palate, however the carbonation keeps it from getting to heavy. The beer is well balanced and unique to the Sam Adams family."
"Black Lager poured a very dark amber color, with very little head. It smells rich, with hints of walnut, or hazelnut. The taste is strong, choclate flavors, pretty malty as well. Strong flavor and good carbination as well. A bit harder to drink because of the heavy flavors. Overall a really good beer, one of my favorite sam adams."
"I guess my only concern is that something seems to be missing in this beer. Almost like they stopped on the flavor because of the mouthfeel and drinkability, which is very good."
"D: It's not very difficult to finish this beer very quickly; the low alcohol content makes this quite sessionable."
"This is a very smooth beer. I like the flavors it presents, and that it does so in a restrained, drinkable way. I believe this is a very good representation of style."
"Pretty solid beer, nice flavor."
"good brew!"
"Clear, dark brown color. 3/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, oatmeal, slight hop, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, oatmeal, slight coffee, and hint of roasted malt. Overall, good appearance, body, blend, and aroma."
"D - Moderately drinkable, especially if you are in the mood for something dark but not as filling as a porter or stout."
"D- really drinkable...its got the taste qualities of a stout without the thick body. Really interesting style, and I want more!"
"D: Quite drinkable for such a sweet and tasty beer. This might be one of my favorites in the SA lineup."
"Pours a very dark brown/barely black body with one finger of tan foam. Aromas are good but a bit subdued. Primary aroma is roastiness, with a light smokiness and a hint of coffee. Taste is a bit strange, in that it initially strikes me (on the front palate) as a rather character deficient, generic British pub ale, before a complex set of roasty, espressoish, extremely dark chocolatey notes suddenly sprout out. The flavor intensity is mellow. The finish lingers briefly on a coffee note. Like most Sam Adams, the body could hardly be better. Not my favorite schwarziber, but hardly the worst. It's a beer I welcome in one of Samuel Adams' mixed cases, but wouldn't buy as a six pack of its own."
"Surprisingly tasty!"
"Pours a deep brown color. When held to light I get some nice reddish hues. Head is off-white and pretty tall. Retention is good. Smell reminds me of shiner bock, it is roasty and caramel-ey. Taste is of chocolate, slight roasty flavor. No major hop presence. Body is a little on the thin side, with appropriate carbonation. I love that this beer has a nice low ABV and a decent flavor. It wound make an okay session beer."
"Before I knew it, my glass was down to nothing. This is quite the drinkable brew. Definitely a pleasant experience for my first Schwarzbier. Different, distinct and wholly pleasing, the brewers at Samuel Adams continue to impress and do the American beer industry proud."
"Drinkability: Big, flavorful, perfect with smoked meat. This is a great alternative to those weary of going with a Rauch or Smoked beer. This also works as a great marinating beer as well."
"Overall it's pretty good but I'm not really a fan of the style. Still a good version compared to the few that I've had. The smoke is light enough that I can enjoy the beer."
"Overall, a very well balanced and tasty dark beer. Well done."
"D-for some reason, although this beer initially tastes good, it is not very drinkable. The main complaint i have is that the mouth feel seems to diminish. it seems to become undesirably creamy and increasingly bitter. the great aftertaste; however, does stay."
"I really like this one. It has a lot of dark roasty flavors with a light enough body to stay highly drinkable. I'll be going back to this one."
"This may be the best offering from Boston Beer Company. Black Lager is very good and was a nice surprise. Good stuff."
"Overall: Roast level lower than expected but not out of style. Well balanced, easy drinking. I would happily drink this anytime."
"Got this one in a Sam Adams fall mixed 12 pack. A tasty, roasted malty brew. It is a lager so it's not too heavy like some stouts and porters, seems just right to me. Sam Adams makes some quality beers and this one has always been a personal favorite of mine."
"mouthfeel is OK but there is significant room for improvement; light bodied and a bit - a bit - watery. but definitely drinkable. all in all, not a bad beer, definitely something you would consider sessioning."
"d 4 maybe it's not my favorite style, but the look and feel are first rate. that alone manages to make this one pretty drinkable."
"Good."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. There is enough bitterness to offset the sweetness which lends itself to be a damn drinkable beer. I could imagine myself enjoying some of these on a cold fall day, sitting in the sun on my porch back home in Illinois. A great addition to the SA Harvest Pack."
"D: A rare dark beer that boarders on the sessionable. Another style well executed by the boys at Boston Beer Company."
"Very deep rubyish brown in color with tan head. Good head retention with nice lacing throughout. Very light aroma of slightly roasted malt, bread, caramel. Good malty flavor, more bread and a touch of caramel with a nice balance of floral hops. Medium body but with a light, airy mouthfeel."
"D-Not a bad beer at all and I'd rather have this in some of the sampler packs than some of the beers that make it in. I have had much better schwarzbiers though."
"Notes: Best before Nov. 2010. A very enjoyable beer that is a good example of the style. Creamy and smooth with a lot of the typical dark, roasted type of flavors but with less of the bitterness that comes with that. Enjoyable to drink beer, although it won't blow you away, it is a solid offering."
"D - Certainly easy to drink and not a style one sees too often. I think I prefer Kostritzer, but I'm okay with this...my biggest complaint is that for me, it was a bit too thin."
"Pours a very dark, but not opaque black brown color with a nice fluffy head and nice retention. Best appearance out of the series so far. The aroma is burnt chocolate, coffee and some roasted nits. The flavor is very roasty with nice background malts. Creamy finish and medium bodied. Bordering on a stout. The mouthfeel is very smooth and really easy to drink. Has too much carbonation for me for this style bit Its drinkable. Drinkability is very high on this as it's got a once low abv and really has a good flavor for such a light beer."
"HIGHLY recommended. Really."
"D - Very drinkable, I remember having this one from Sam Adams awhile ago and it still doesn't fail me, one of the best Sam offerings to me. I could quaff a sixer of this one for sure and I'd definitely buy this one again, great price for a good brew. Cheers!"
"d: Nice, drinkable black lager. 2-3 would be my max."
"Overall a pretty tasty dark lager, definitely sits heavy in the stomach, but the taste is worth it."
"This is fairly drinkable I could drink a few of these though the smokiness of the beer might limit how many I would want to drink."
"D could down three or four in quick order"
"The Sam Adam's Black Lager pours a dark molasses-like brown in the glass with a small off-white froth that dissipates quickly. On the nose are aromas of BBQ smoke, ground coffee beans, dark chocolate, & roasted hazelnuts that follow through on the palate. The beer is light bodied, crisp, smooth, & full of flavor with a pretty aggressive carbonation (kind of like Coke). The lingering flavors on the lasting finish leaves me with an overall good impression. This beer is very sessionable & I could easily see myself grabbing a sixer of this for my next BBQ. Even though I wish the carbonation was less aggressive, the head retained a little longer, & the mouthfeel was creamier, I sill Recommend this beer."
"Black colored brew, the lower half shines amber when held to the light. Small khaki colored head, pretty good lacing. Chocalte lagered malt scent. Pretty big chocolate malt taste, a fair amount of roast. Almost creamy mouth but also fairly wet. Not a bad beer overall."
"D/M: Very clean and not too heavy. Not overly carbonated. Very good balanced flavor."
"drinkability: easy drinker and good session beer. but i'd choose others over this."
"D_One of Sam Adams better beers. This is an easy drinker yet with a full flavour. A very good American Swartzbier"
"Notes: I sincerely like this offering in the ""Brewmasters Collection"" from Sam Adams. Bravo!"
"A nice dark lager, sweet but not too. easy to drink."
" A very drinkable beer that grows on you."
"It's a quenching dark brew, which is a juxtaposition I love. I actually remember this brew being a little bigger and not as watery. But that's not necessarily bad because I believe most schwarzbiers are usually on the thin side typically have lower ABV. Regardless - still a good fall-back on a style I love."
"This is a creamy and smooth treat. The beer tastes of smoke, chocolate, with an herbal finish. This is a great Schwarzbier!"
"I liked this one a lot, I was looking all over for it, and was finally able to find it through a friend. Very satisfying for a lager, and like I said before, it's a beer that I would have no problem drinking all night."
"Balanced Sweetness, low bitter (especially for a dark) and great texture. It runs a little flat so I'd like to see a bit more carbonation but overall one of my favorite dark beers."
"Another solid offering from BBC that I'm glad to have as part of a sampler."
"D - High. Could drink several but will enjoy the one..."
"a rather doughy quality lager with a nice malt quality that give it a bit of body and a bit of sweet foamy lace. coca cola without a light carbonation that is a sharp on the tongue. smell of chocolate and toastiness. but mild to the scent of grass. a good drink for the summer if you're looking for something malty. better than most american black beers."
"D: Very good drinkability. This isn't the kind of beer that's meant to be thrown back, but it will definitely leave you wanting another."
"Overall it seemed a bit average. It was okay and I could easily drink this all night, but there was nothing that would keep me going back again and again - I will be moving on."
"As it warms up, the presence of alcohol starts to show itself. Embrace it. This is a tasty brew. Is it too much to ask for this one to be available on tap in the winter around here?"
"D: Nice at the beginning but rather fast becomes bitter, with a medium lasting and bitter ending."
"O: quite pleased with this sam adams, I was skeptical at first but this is a treat. Nice roasted malts, w a great complimentary chocolate malt profile. Will drink again :)"
"D: Very downable, and a pretty damn good schwarzbier. Not my favourite, but I would definitely crack open a bottle if I saw one laying around. I won't go so far as to recommend it, but I would definitely drink another or three."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this beer, since I am not usually a fan of lagers. It pours a smooth, very dark brown, with a smallish white head. Has a malty aroma, like a porter. The taste is nice, has a good balance between hops and sweet malt flavor. Goes down smooth, isn't as thick as a stout or porter. This is one of my favorite Sam Adams beers, would make a good session beer."
"Drinkability is superb. It's a great session beer."
"D - A rich and creamy beer, one was enough for me."
"Nice shwarzbier."
"D: I could put a few of these back in the winter/fall. Though because of its lightness, it's not hard to put down in warmer temperatures. I could definitely drink more of these in a sitting."
"One of Sam's best."
"The mouthfeel is nice, and it is very drinkable. This is a high quality beer at a very reasonable price."
"D- Great beer to drink with food or alone. Nice to change it up a little. One of my favorite SA offerings."
"D: It's a decent brew that is widely available, but not a repeat purchase."
"D: Definitely good, would go well with grilled meats."
"Drinkability wise I just don't see myself ever drinking this beer again. It has low abv so you could drink a few if you liked it. Only redeeming factor there."
"Overall, a very good beer, one I would definitely buy again."
"This is a very nice example of the style, refreshing and flavorful."
"Drinkiability - Yes please. I can see myself drinking a few."
"D. Very drinkable; light on the tongue, but interesting. Another great BBQ brew."
"Taste is burnt chocolate, dark chocolate, and some significant maltiness. Not a whole lot going on here, but enjoyable for what it has. Smooth mouthfeel, medium heavy body. A litter bitter on the tailend, making this a little less enticing for a long run of drinks."
"I've had this one a few times before, and will grab it again when the mood strikes."
"Run of the mill offering here from SA. Perhaps not there best offering compared to other well made brews from them. Pass this one up if in search of a delicious black lager."
"D- A pretty tasty drinkable beer that I often overlook. Very nice."
" This is a very nice beer and a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, I would definitely pick this one up again. I enjoyed it and if you are a fan of schwarzbiers, take a chance on this one because you won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Great beer. It's a winner. Although when I saw that Sam Adams was making a black lager, I really didn't have any doubts. It's a rich and bold beer that still goes down easy."
"The Boston Beer Company found a winner with the Black Lager. As soon as I poured it from the bottle I was impressed with the rich dark appearance and aromas of chocolate, grain, roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of smokiness. Has a sweet taste but not to overpowering. I felt it was a bit heavier than a typical lager but all in all I like it quite a bit and will buy it again in the future."
"Poured into a perfect pint glass, the beer is black until held up to the light, which reveals nice mahogany edges. The head is light foam about a finger's width. There's a nice cap of retention and good lacing. Aromas include some coffee, with a fitting acidity. Caramel and bitter chocolate on the nose, and it's all followed up with a smokiness that's bordering on burnt but not overwhelming. Flavors are floral in an almost soapy sense, but also not overwhelming or unpleasant. Mild astringency and husky. Big roasty flavor, with an emphasis on the caramel more so than the chocolate. Mouthfeel is crisply carbonated with a medium body and light residuals. Not a bad 6er to hang out with on a rainy day!"
"D- Wonderful taste. Very smooth, easy on the mouth and throat, somewhat heavy on the stomach. Would most definitely drink this again, just not sure how many I could drink in a sitting."
"Drinkability: this is quite drinkable, due to the nice flavor and low ABV. I would definitely quaff a few of these in a session."
"Overall: Of course I'm sure other black lagers exist out there, but I've never had another one, and I don't know many people who have. This is an awesome gateway beer."
"Overall opinion, I wouldn't turn it down but also would not hunt it down."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, as this style should be. Really proves the common misconception about dark beer = heavy all wrong."
"drinkability is not good - if i dont like the flavor why drink it"
"Pours into a glass a nice black with a good head. The smell hints of chocolate and of being roasted. The taste seems to carry over the roasted flavor with a bit of sweetness and finish slightly bitter. It is smooth with a good body and maintains the feel throughout. This is a good beer to enjoy on a winter evening, relaxing next to the fireplace."
"Mild drinking, very little in the way of power or offense here, but not a bad beer at all."
"A nice black lager. Would probably be a good crowd pleaser during the colder months. I could really get into a case of this."
"It's not a bad beer, and it has some really pleasant characters. It's just that they seem either muted or otherwise slightly insipid. Drinkable enough, but not necessarily something I'd seek out or even bother trying again."
"Mouthfeel is medium light and has a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Nothing complicated for the style, but that's not a detraction here. These go down nice and easy and I welcome them into my home."
"D: A very drinkable example of a schwarzbier, albeit more roasty than some, but well within accepted guidelines for the style."
"One of the better Sam Adams offerings IMO."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer. Flavors are pretty easy, almost like a pilsner (due to a load of pils malt I guess). ABV is manageable."
"Comments: Looks very much like a dry stout but tastes nothing like them. A truly delightful brew that will be welcome in my fridge any time."
"Drinkability: Great example of a Schwarzbier, once again proving that Sam Adams can make really good German session lagers."
"terrific beer. one of my favorite sam adams around. dark rich color matches the smell and taste. you really can't drink many of them though, definetely a beer for food and that's about it. it's heavy, malty, sweet, and a bit nutty. it's your typical dark beer...but does everything really well."
"Drinkability: This brewery to me is often hit or miss and this is a definite hit. A really nice beer that while I couldn't drink as a session, I could have with a great meal."
"Expecting a thicker taste after the smell and appearance, I was relieved to find that this brew was still light with plenty of taste. A pretty decent mouthfeel lends greatly to the drinkability."
"If you're a lager person, this is a great brew in my opinion. It's easy to drink and not too heavy. I like it."
"D: Highly drinkable winter beer. Low abv makes it great for a session on cold nights. Lightness and crispness don't weigh you down. Well crafted. I recall this being one of the beers that got me interested in craft brews."
"Provides a nice solid red/brown hue against the light - otherwise appearing a few shades lighter than pitch black. Smells very grainy and nothing else. Nice dark chocolate tones that is also rich with a lot of nutty notes as well - particular to hazelnut. Sits nice and easy upon consumption. Honestly nothing I would have again - I've had better experiences with black beers. This is still a solid work though."
"The pour is very dark brown, but it has lots of ruby highlights showing through when held to light. Smells of bready sweetness along with touches of coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar. Taste was a virtual match with the scent. There's also a slight touch of hops that is palatable in the finish...it'd be nice if this was more pronounced. Feel was a bit thin and watery."
"Poors a rich dark dark brown into my Sam Adams Lager glass. This Light brown head which dissipates quickly. Smell is nutty and roasted and caramel. Good carbonation. Not as rich as I expected from the color. Relatively light on the tongue. Very light lacing on the glass which evaporates quickly. Flavors of caramel, roastedness, and good hops"
"A nice warming sensation, mostly in the throat, light effervescence with a smooth texture. A good brew, especially from a brewery this size. Really good with chocolate chip cookies."
"D - This beer is drinkable but moreso because it is so average. I feel like this is just one small ingredient away from being a very good beer but comes up short."
"A very nice session beer that has a lot of flavor."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I assume that Schwarzbier isn't the mose complex style, but this seems like a good representation of others."
"The lager was poured from a bottle into a clean goblet. Not really impressed with the appearance, the beer is black with absolutely no head. The aroma was average with hints of roasted grain. The beer had a nice rich and smooth flavor of roasted grains with a hint of coffee and hops. Drinkability is good, but this style of beer is meant to be savored not swilled. Pretty good beer but not as good as I had expected."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not my favorite style, but this beer is well crafted for sure. Would gladly drink again, but probably wouldn't purchase with my own money."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of some malts and chocolate. Taste is also malts and toffee,some notes of chocolate, slight bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Serving type: bottle poured into a 1 pint mug."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, but it's a bit heavy (in a non-boozy way) for me to consider throwing back more than one of these."
"Drinkability: Good flavor and being light means this is an ideal brew for spring or summer when you still want to enjoy complex flavors but don't want a particularly heavy beer."
"D: Excellent beer from Samuel Adams."
"D - Good looks and smells but doesn't matter because the taste is too bland and uncharacteristic."
"Value: Decent."
"Kind of like a porter jr. - I really enjoy this style of beer. I've had a few of these tonight, certainly drinkable"
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Nice creamy looking head that goes to a thin film. Excellent lacing. Nice roasted malt aroma. Hints of caramel and just the slightest bitterness of chocolate. Goes down so nice and easy. Very clean finish. I really enjoy this beer and unfortunantly where I live this seems to be the only black lager available. This beer makes me want to try others. Good job SA!"
"Drinkability is pretty high. Overall this is a nice offering from Boston Beer, even if it's no Black Tuesday."
"D- Very drinkable, easily can have more than one. I was expecting a little heavier of a body, but still good. Typical Sam Adams, great quality but nothing to go crazy about"
"Overall Impressions: Well balanced flavors overall. Not as heavy as expected from appearance (looking like a porter or stout). Very enjoyable (drinks like a good lager) and I would certainly enjoy multiple."
"In any case definitely worth getting!"
"D - Decent drinkability, not too much at once and something I could sit and have a few at a time."
"D: This is very drinkable and tasty as a session beer. I prefer a stout over a schwarzbier, but if I was in the mood for something with a lighter body while retaining the malty profile I like in a stout, this is the way I'd go."
"Drinkability - Despite the lighter ABV, this one is more of a sipper than a drinker."
"D: A pleasant surprise. One of BBC's better offerings."
"I'd wager Sam Adams Black Lager is the best schwarbier from this side of the Atlantic; it's certainly one of the best examples I've tried to date. Sam Adams makes a lot of beers and although they aren't all winners, those that are tend to be untypically good. If you like flavourful, malty, clean and quenching beers then this is something that should definitely interest you. It interested me enough to buy again."
"D - I liked this one from Sam Adams...tried it in a side-by-side with Duck Rabbit's Schwarzbier...the flavors are there in this one and come out in good flavor...I would drink this one again"
"D - Respectable, but not much more... Being a fan of both Samuel Adams and Schwarzbiers, I was slightly let down... Pales in comparison to other Samuel Adams offerings... Pales in comparison to other Schwarzbiers... The 4.9% makes it sessionable, but I'm not sure this is something I want to drink more than one of... I'll likely pass in the future when presented with viable alternatives..."
"pretty good schwarzbier . good intro to the style."
"d- very drinkable. light enough and sessionable enough that i think that i shall have another. nothing terribly excting, but it is what sam adams does with a lot of their beers. simple, straight forward, and generally good."
"Overall, this is an enjoyable bier, one of the better sam adams products not named boston lager. I recommend it. Prosit."
"Nice ebony color with a lighter tan head. Nose is all roasted malt, espresso and bitter chocolate. The taste isn't surprising, I've had quite a few of these over the years. Very well done close to a earning a score higher. Black malt and roasted malt with a bitter semi-sweet chocolate backbone. Very tasty but a little thin in the mouthfeel department and could be thicker as well."
"M/D: Very drinkable, doesn't taste like a typical dark malt beer, very smooth and drinkable."
"Dark brown body with a minimalist off-white head. Aroma of nice roasted malt with just a slight hint of hops. The taste is also a smooth roasted note backed by just a touch of fresh malt flavor that has a hint of sweetness. The hops simply balance out the malt and the result is a nice clean finish that just hints of roasted malts. Mouthfeel is about average - maybe just a hair too much carbonation that keeps the beer from being a smooth on the palate as it is in flavor. Drinkability is decent. I would drink it, but I wouldn't buy it."
"D - Supremely drinkable. At 4.9% abv, this is a nice choice for a session brew. Extremely well done. Delicious."
"The clean, crisp taste of a larger with full-flavored roasted malt. light-medium body. slight but tight carbonation."
"Sam Adams you expect that), good drinkability (plan on getting more), easy to drink. Went well with a burger, probably goes well with ethnic food too."
"D-now i wouldnt go pounding these at the bar but definitely something to kick back with and enjoy with a hearty meal. one of my favorites for the fall/winter holidays. i highly reccomend."
"I could drink a six pack of this without a problem, nice beer."
"Smell has a soft roasted aroma along with some sweet caramel, even a hint of chocolate. It's light and clean with a distinct lager aroma to it. Taste also has some roasted malt and some sweeter elements of caramel and chocolate. There's a grainy, bready quality to it, and a bit of bitterness in the finish to balance it out. Clean and smooth. My only complaint is that the flavors are a bit too thin, although the flavor overall is good."
"D: Highly recommended. I'm a big fan of the darker beers and will definitely pick this up again."
"Drinkability: This is a great tasting lager.Easy to drink,and leaves you wanting more, the smokiness of the beer is what keeps you coming back. Highly recommended!!"
"Pours a very dark brown color with a finger of slightly tanned head. Has a sweet nose with a hint of yeasty chocolate. Quite a bit of lacing to be found and the head does not retain long. More smell of malt sweetness. Taste has a medium to light body with slight bitter crisp finish. Can taste notes of both chocolate and coffee. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel welcomes a second beer. As it warms it takes on some toffee taste as well."
"Drinkability: This is a tasty, well-brewed schwartzbier and one I'll be having again. Its easy to drink, just complex enough to be interesting, and just tasty enough to leave me wanting more."
"D- This is a beautiful beer, a good session beer for autumn. Its great to see this style represented and easily accessible."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability is great due to its smooth taste and smooth finish. My favorite offering from Boston Beer Company."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I have had it many of times but I took about a three year break from Sam Adams. I just happen to find this today and really seemed to enjoy it."
"This brew is light bodied - yet very tasty with a good mouthfeel. Case worthy indeed. One of the best from Sam Adams."
"Sam Adams continues to impress. You gotta love a brewing company that gives you a craft beer taste, even when you're in the middle of nowhere (rural Alabama)."
"Overall this is a solid beer but I thought it was more along the lines of a dry irish stout than a full-fledged schwarzbier. Certainly don't avoid this, but I wouldn't go searching for it."
"Very smooth and clean, full of rich maltiness and just a touch of roastiness; easy drinking yet full of flavor. This is a wonderful example of a lesser-brewed style, and proof that low-alcohol German-style lagers can have much more depth of character than pale golden Pilsener-type brews."
"D: I was hoping this one would mature on warming but to me it just kind of got a bit watery and blasÃ©. But hey this is a good beer. In a small town where the selection is minimal its very nice to find this in stock."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours coca cola color with a decent foamy light brown head, fair lacing. Aroma is mainly malty, roasted malt, burnt, coffee, a bit of chocolate, and a touch of hops. Flavor is caramel and roasted malts, a touch of smoke with bit of hops. Medium body, fairly bitter lightly carbonated a bit oily on the tongue. One of the better ones from Sam Adams."
"Overall, a very drinkable, flavorful beer packed full of roasted flavor!"
"I would much prefer my golden lagers and kolchs."
"D: Schwarzbier is great!"
"In the end this what I've come to expect from Sam Adams; a good flavorful beer that serves to introduce new flavors and brewing experiences into the American palate."
"D - Decent version of the black lager, but doesnt stand up to German and Czech versions."
"Very easy to drink due to crisp carbonation and despite having dark roasty malts, not overly filling and quite refreshing."
"I'd have to say this is quite an exceptional beer for the money, but this is one of my favorite styles in general."
"Overall, this has to be my favorite Sam Adams beer. I've only had a few different versions of a black lager including some homebrewed versions. Definitely a great schwarzbier."
"D: They recommended this with BBQ. I had one with Mexican and that was just fine by me. This is my first Schwarzbier. I liked the refreshing lager mixed with malty satisfaction - a real hybrid. I'd really like to try this again. Not blowing my mind but a sound brew."
"Drinkability- Somewhat jives but it doesn't seem to be all that sessionable."
"This is a pretty solid brew across the board. Only my 2nd or maybe 3rd Scwharzbier, but a solid and tasty brew regardless of style. It's light and maybe a tad thin in terms of flavor, but this hit the spot after working my tail off in my new house."
"Notes: Another solid beer from Samuel Adams!"
"Wow! We were hanging out at the Stonewood Ale house in Schaumburg, UIL when I decided to give this a try. Nice rich black color. Not much head. I could smell the chocolate/coffee goodness right away and the taste was right along with that, plus there was a subtle smokiness to the beer as well. The texture is a little thin but it is generally well balanced. I don't think this would be a good session beer."
"Another aspect of note is a characteristic of most Sam Adams beer; the clean and crisp taste. Sam Adams' body of their beers is a foot in the commercial beer and a foot in the craft beer. It does not explode with the pizzaz of a microbrew that's trying to prove itself by overwhelming the tongue, but it also is not as bland and watered down as a Miller or Coors beer."
"Note: Palate becomes shot after half-way through each sausage, as the spice level is so high, so if planning on reviewing this beer, do so before eating too many bites of the sausage ;)"
"I find the Sam Adams black lager to be very drinkable. It's not the tastiest beer in the world but it is a nice beer at the low ABV end (below 5%)."
"Very drinkable. Like a light stout."
"D: Not a bad beer, but certainly nothing exceptional."
"Don't switch from this one to something lighter, though... you won't like either. (We tried a black & white night with Sam's spring seasonal... not recommended.)"
"This is a pretty tasty beer. I could definitely enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"Overall, not too bad. I'd drink it again."
"D- Easy to toss back several of these, compared to average stout i'd say i could put more of these back in a session"
"Pours brown/black with ruby edges, tan head with ok retention and nice lacing. Smell: sweet, dark corn syrup, roasted, pumpernickel, grassy hops in background. Taste: caramel, roasted, on the doorstep of burnt, baker's chocolate, a touch of grassy hops. Medium bodied with fine carbonation and a finish that compromises between being drying and sticky sweet. Tasty, definitely one of their better offerings."
"It is drinkable because it is pretty thin beer, but the bitter taste makes it more difficult to put down."
"m/d - Drys up a bit towards the end but not too much, refreshing. Highly drinkable, lowish ABV and complex taste make for a great session beer."
"D - Not a lager fan, but I'd have this again for sure."
" tastes."
"D: Low ABV means you could put a couple of these away easy; fairly smooth, decent drinkability."
"This is one of the better (and one of the few) Schwarzbiers out there. A great dark session beer with loads of flavor but a lighter body, which makes it easy to drink even in warmer weather."
"A really well-done beer by SA in my opinion. I've been impressed by the Brewmaster's Collection so far; the Irish Red ale was also quite tasty. At just 4.90% ABV, this is a totally sessionable beer, and one that I would happily revisit in the future. Superior to the handful of other American craft black lagers I've had in the past."
"Not a bad dessert beer(for dessert, rather than with dessert)."
"Pours from the bottle a dark black with a finger and a half of tan head that took some coaxing to show up and quickly fades. Smell is a little on the weak side--lightly roasted malt with a touch of hops, and a cream/buttermilk note. Taste has similar flavors, but here the lightness is delicious; there's no burnt flavor, which I sort of expected, and in its place is a pleasant sweetness. As good as Black Lager tastes, however, its creamy, soft body is wonderful and something I've not found in any other beer. As light and pleasant as this beer, I could drink several of them."
"D: It's a lighter beer and very enjoyable."
"D - As schwarzbiers go, this one is very decent but a bit more viscous than I'm used to for the style. Its still a drinkable veer but I think it sits a bit heavier while still lighter than it would appear."
"D: It's good, not amazing. Not sure if I'd shell out for a full sixer, but a worthy variety-pack member."
"I can taste the chocolate and the appropriate hop finish. What surprises me is the smokiness in the beer. It's pretty prominent. Its tasty if a bit weird."
"Nice medium bodied Schwarzbier. Leave it to BBC to get this done right. I could session this all day long."
"Drinkability. I like the style and Sam Adams has produced a nice black lager. I would purchase again."
"Very dark, but not opaque. Clear chestnut colour with a fluffy tan head. Lots of foam off the pour, which settled to a half inch cap and left tons of streaky/clumpy lace on the glass. Malty aroma, hints of milk chocolate and cola nut, roast and caramel. Bitterness melded nicely with the dark grains, giving it a bittersweet chocolate character. Malt dominated, but a kiss of hop flavour and bitterness were evident towards the finish. Texture was alright, a little on the thin side once the carbonation subsided, but still fine. Pretty tasty overall. I'd certainly come back to this again."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear deep dark brown color with about a finger of light tan foam with no lacing to speak of. Smells of medium roasted grains, a bit of caramel, and brown bread. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, sweet caramelized malts, roasted grains, and bready malt. A bit thin bodied with medium carbonation and slightly sticky. I had no problem going through my six pack."
"D- After having some scharzbiers in Germany, I must say that I thought this was a nice representation of the style. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely drink it again."
"This was one of my first craft beers on my path to enlightenment. It's great that Boston Beer Company has made this, being a rarer style. This also tends to be considered one of the better beers that BBC makes, and I agree with that. It is great when you want some chocolate or roasted flavors without the heaviness of a stout or porter. It's not my favorite Sam Adams offering, but it is another good offering from them."
"Drinkability: Yes, more than one!!! It is a good beer, lots of flavor. Even my wife enjoys it, and she doesn't like the ""dark"" beers"
"Drinkability is iffy - just too sweet. balanced for awhile, but more roasty acidity is needed to balance."
"Final Thoughts - Surprisingly light in body and flavor when noticing the intial appearance of the brew. Definitely worth a try in a 12 pack mix or a sixer."
"D- Great session brew. Clean, and light, but lots of flavor."
"Bottom Line: This is an average beer. Nothing great about it, but nothing bad about it either. I don't think I will ever buy it again, but that is not to say I wouldn't drink it again."
"D - VERY drinkable. Not too bitter or too sweet."
"D: easy to drink and with descent flavor it's one you can take a few down and enjoy. But it just didn't offer anything really impressive."
"Sam Adams Black Lager is considerably light bodied--perhaps a touch on the watery side, even--but mellow and smooth. Very high drinkability, and I'd gladly drink multiple glasses of this."
"Very drinkable. I would recommend this to people who don't think that they like malt taste/dark beer."
"Thin-medium in body. It seem almost like a lighter body version of a porter or stout. Higher carbonation than porter/stouts."
"Very black, but red too, not blood red, but more along the lines of a dark unkept redwood set above a fire place mantle in a castle somewhere in medieval Bavaria. Looks a whole lot like a porter, and has a beautiful cream toasted head that smells like caramel and chocolate, not really up front, but there (def. there). Good retention, and leaves a tapestry of along the side of the glass for the duration. It tastes like a porter too, but not in the same burnt way that sam adams honey porter comes across... In fact... it has a subtle undertone of caramel, and is alot lighter than a porter. It has a dry finish, and a nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Buy it, or get the variety pack like I did, and spend the night reviewing 3 good beers."
"D-Light and with a low ABV you could drink quite a few, but I will not buy this again."
"surprisingly nice. thought it would be just ok."
"D: Smooth beer. Nothing too sweet or too bitter. Nice balance overall"
"Would also like to add that it goes very well with my sceczwan stirfry...basically good with spicy food..."
"Drinkability & Notes: Got this in a brewmeister pack, not a bad beer, but not super great either. A nice stab at a Schwarzbier."
"Drinkability: I could easily session this. This is one of my favorite Sam Adams offerings. just unique and smoky enough."
"This is probably my favorite from Sam Adams. Creamy but not too heavy with a great roastiness flavor for a lager. Wish i could buy a case of this."
"In all, a decent beer, but I'll probably stick to Sam's more sophisticated brews."
"Smell is nutty with hits of malts. Initial taste is actually like a toasted pecan. Almost get a slight smoky bacon taste, but beer is lighter than it looks - common for this style. Nice on palate and definitely follows through with a great finish."
"Tastes like roasted chocolate esspresso beans and creme brulee. Very beery though and not at all dessert like. It's a bit nutty."
"Over all pretty good. Nice example by SA of a Schwarzbier. Really need to try this fresh to properly review it, but as is, its still pretty tasty"
"The appearance is dark brown to black with a thin beige head with little retention. The smell is heavy on the chocolate malt. Very little else is noticeable. The taste is chocalately from the malt. There is also a slight spice from the hops, but the malt clearly dominates. The flavor of this is nicely mild and does not overpower the palate, which I enjoy in this case. The mouthfeel is light and complements the mild flavor. This is one of the few beers I can have a lot of without being overpowered by the flavor. Thus I find this brew extremely drinkable and a favorite session beer of mine. Completely worth the effort to try."
"-RR"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Schwartzbiers are pretty hard to find, but this is a fine and easily accessible example. Good fall/winter beer."
"Good beer, but as with many Sam Adams brew, I think there are better options out there in this price range."
"D: The roasty flavor is enjoyable, but could be balanced out by some bitterness. However, this beer is smooth and warming, an easy drinker."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Very smooth. Makes me want another."
"I can't remember the last time I had a beer that felt so good in my mouth. This is a truly great creation from our friends at the Boston Beer Company. It tastes amazing with a deep rich flavor and a deep dark appearance. The only knock I have on this beer is that it isn't particularly drinkable. I can only have two or three of these before my taste buds are overwhelmed. All-around great beer however."
"Not a favorite from Sam Adams. No real aroma too it. The color is a very deep black color. There is little texture and the taste is so-so. You could drink alot of them, because they are in fact very smooth going down. Overall it is so-so, if it is on hand and your other alternatives are bud, go for it."
"Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Wasn't my favorite style but I think it could grow on me. SA Black lager really could be close to a session beer but for me it seems like this one might get a little boring after a while."
"D- Excellent. These go down very easy. Solid, but I've had better."
"D - Very drinkable, though a bit mild in flavor and aroma for a schwarzbier. Given the price, this is one that I'll be picking up again."
"This is a good one to make a regular for someone in a mood for a darker beer."
"Would buy again in the future."
"Cheers!"
"This is my second beer of this style, and I believe this one is closer to a good example than the other I tried. It's definitely worth a try, and it will probably make regular stops in my home."
"Cheers"
"Overall impression - this beer has all of the character you would want in a ""heavier"" beer, but with the drinkability of something lighter. A sessionable beer, but it's not lacking. Full of flavor! I especially love the smoky lingering finish."
"Drinkability- Easy drinking and tasty. A great dark beer that you can session. Normally a single serving will due for a review, yet four were consumed reviewing this beer- so enough said."
"Taste is smooth and moderate for the color of the beer. A bit smoky/hoppy and with a moderate and well balanced malt structure. Noting that this is a Schwarzbier, an unfamiliar style. Yet this is easily the best brew in my mix-o-case from Costco. Inviting and flavorful, I look forward to another."
"D - this was the first beer I truly enjoyed and for a while, it was my session beer. it's a very good schwarzbier."
"A dark red to black color with a dense dark tan head. Aroma of sweet roasted caramel ,and chocolate malt with some light dusty spicyness. Smooth medium body with soft carbonation. Flavor starts out with a quick dark roast malt some dark caramel in the background then you get some smooth chocolately/grainy flavors. The finish has a bit of spice from hops blending into the mix. A very balanced enjoyable,sessionable beer. One of my new favorites from Sam"
"D- Very easy to drink at just 5%, nothing to cloying or overwhelming but full flavored. Very nice."
"D. Very drinkable. Not overly carbonated."
"MF/D: nicely balanced as I said before, very bittersweet in my humble opinion. Nice body on this one, very drinkable for its style"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and thin."
"Deep dark brown with a nice whipped mousse-like three fingers of sand colored foam resting on top that lasts and leaves very little lace. Smells of coffee and sweet malt and something close to a ""Three Musketeers"" candy bar smell. Tastes rich and malty, coffee and chocolate. Decent lighter mouthfeel and good drinkability. Not exactly what I think of in terms of a german schwarzbier but nice and different."
"This is a rather light beer for as dark as it looks. While I do enjoy this beer, when I look away and turn back I keep hoping that it will be as hearty as it looks, but alas, that is not the case. Perhaps a nice change when you're just not up for a heavy stout, but want others to think you're having one. I guess this is anything but a glowing review, but I actually do like this beer."
"Dark black with three fingers of tan, creamy head. Pretty good lacing and head retention. Smells of sweet malts and a slight bit of hops. Taste was much the same. Had a bit of a spicy character, sweet malts, and finished with a bit of black licorice taste. Overall not too bad, a bit of a watery taste. The beer was pretty smooth, not much carbonation, and overall pretty drinkable. Would buy again in the future."
"Pours a deep dark brown/black color, some light falls through. Big foamy head, decent lacing, somewhat lasting. Not a very strong aroma, malts, some hops, weak, but not unpleasant. Watery malty taste, not too strong, just average. Clean aftertaste. Not much else to it."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. Great taste, smooth, and I thoroughly enjoyed drinking it. Will buy again; kudos, Samuel Adams."
"Right for the style -- seems like this should be thicker than it is. Thinner mouthfeel but highly drinkable, a good rep of the style. Not quite as good as some of the real deal German ones available, but if you can't find them, this is a good alternative. I had 3 different beers during the Superbowl, and this is the one I kept going back to."
"D: Big time D here. Low ABV, great taste, makes this a superb session beer."
"I agree with everything written about this beer. You would think, looking at it in the glass, that it would be overpoweringly dense, sweet, or syrupy. On the contrary! Normally I sway to heavy hoped beers, but the level of hops in this one is really nice! A really nice beer!"
"I'm very impressed with this dark lager. A lot of darker beers tend to get too crafty and try to overpower you with bitterness or high alcohol content, this beer avoids these pitfalls."
"When poured from the bottle, there was a nice two fingers of creamy colored fine bubble foam. The color of the beer was just as the label indicated, black and opague. A nice aroma reminiscent of carmelized vanilla and some other spice I can't identify. Slightly sweet in flavor for a beer described as a ""Black Lager."" Would have liked to have more alcohol kick to compliment the mild hop notes."
"MF&D - A little thin but very easy to drink. Would make a nice session beer."
"D= pretty good. I'll have another."
"Goes down very easily. So does the second and the third. Quite possibly my favorited Sam Adams."
"It has a mild smoky flavor to it like a porter, but a smooth, lager taste and mild aroma. Has a rusty feel to it. Tastes closer to a porter than a lager. It's an odd taste for a lager. It tastes very good."
"All around a nice drinkable dark beer."
"I liked this beer and thought that it would go well as an after dinner drink instead of coffee.Not just because of the coffee flavours but its overall profile of smooth and bitter mimics a good Espresso coffee"
"Not my favorite by a long shot, but not horrible."
"Pours black. Moderate beige head. Pleasant aroma with chocolate and smoke flavors evident. Diminishing head with good lacing throughout. Smooth, nice finish. Part of SA Holiday Brewmaster's Pack. Enjoyable but would probably not buy in quantity."
"Near black pour with an off white head. Roast malt aroma. Fairly mild flavors, chocolate/caramel roasted malts. Nothing overpowering, well balanced and drinkable. Not a bad example of the style at all. Pick it over bud or whatever other crap is at the supermarket."
"Love this dark lager. Delicious. Give me more. Why are not on draught in Boston?!? Dark color, decent head, wonderful dark-roasted malts and just the slightest hops. No overwhelming coffee or chocolate hints, and the perfect body for drinkability. Keep 'em comin' !"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very dark and looked like heavy stout. The head on the beer was a nice tan color but it did not last very long. The smell was smokey and a little nutty. The taste was the same with a hint of coffee. i will buy this beer again."
"D - If I'm going to have coffee and chocolate, I want espresso and 70% dark; the hints of both here in the Black Lager just didn't do enough for me. Nobody likes a tease!"
"Drinkability: Overall, I really enjoyed this great SA offering. It's rich, malty, and has the perfect amount of ingredients to keep it interesting. I love how this beer combines the caramel malts with the good roasty flavors, this makes for a perfect winter beer to relax with on a cold snowy day."
"Creamy, robust feel. Very nice flavor, and good solid atmosphere. Good all around quaff."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"There is a little less body than I would like from a great beer, but for the schwarz style it's really not too bad at all. A little watery once again, but it's a decent drinker."
"Good beeer!!!!"
"Overall this one isn't bad, but nothing super fantastic."
"Taste: Smooth, sweet, and malty. Nothing complex, but it's a nice drinkable dark beer."
"(rated Mar 11, 2007)"
"Overall: A good, really dark product from Sam Adams. I would recommend it to most people."
"Pours deep, dark black. Not much head, good lacing. Nose is dry roasted malt. Taste follows suit, some dry roasted cofee beans, a little bit of cookie, bready malt. Palate is more than adequate, creamy. Very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: A relatively good schwarzbier. Not the best I've had, but pretty good. Typical of Sam Adams. Sam Adams seems to me to make a wide range of decent beers in a variety of styles, but nothing too impressive. This is one of their better beers."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and very tasty- I could drink this one after the other without a complaint in the world. My favorite style, and this represents it well. Also my favorite Sam Adams beer."
"Could be a good session beer if you like black lagers"
"Unexpectedly, this is a fantastic beer. Definitely world class, it tasted perfect to the last sip. This one's already one of my very favourites! I highly recommend it."
"D: Drinkable enough. Better if the taste matched up with the smell. Nicley balanced in any event."
"i get some bubbles towards the back of the palate... average drinkability."
"Review this beer on July 15 2007"
"Very drinkable. Good session beer."
"Highly recommended! More proof that Sam Adams is emerging (if not already is) as the king of American beers."
"A great combination of lager smoothness with just a hint of roasted character. No noticeable hop character."
"D - This beer was very interesting, a very sessionable lager that has little hop flavor (but that's what they were going for), but full of something unique, this Schwarzbier is a rare style in America, but Samuel Adams did a great job here"
"Pours black throughout the middle with brownish red highlights at the edges. Smells of sweet molasses and caramel with a smoky background. Tastes sweet and malty with burnt edges. This beer is light and crisp and rather refreshing for its look. Fairly well carbonated and drinkable."
"D: Nice change of pace type of beer."
"to be honest, I've never been a huge lager fan. This isn't bad, but it's still a lager. The elevated malt profile is not bad, but it's just not my cup of tea (as it were...)"
"This beer really slides down very smoothly with great texture to it. This is a very drinkable beer as well. After each sip I looked forward to the next. Most drinkable ""dark"" beer I've ever had, because its light bodied enough that you can have many if you want."
"EDIT: I saw some people saying there isnt much roasted/coffee/chocolate flavors here. That's complete hogwash. Get a fresh one of these and those are the most pronounced flavors."
"D: On the whole, this isn't a bad beer, but it really didn't knock my socks off in any particular way."
"D: An easy beer to drink. I could sit down and have a few at a time."
"D: I could have a few of these and be satisfied. Sam Adams (Black Lager) is a very good choice of a sociable beer. Not a treat by any means."
"Pours mostly black with some translucency and rubyness to it. Nice head retention. Watery and a little astringent, but otherwise very clean. Just a touch of roasted black patent malt, but very clean and appropriate for a Schwarzbier. Mostly clean aftertaste with hints of smoke and charcoal. A faint hop spice accompanies the roasted malt nicely. Medium/thin mouthfeel- the carbonation seems a little excessive. A nice, clean Schwarzbier but I think it could benefit from just a little more flavor overall. It reminds me of the Schwarzbier I used to drink out of a 2 L boot in Germany in terms of its drinkability and overall appeal as a beer."
"D-Quite drinkable, in that I could drink another due to it's smooth lager characteristics. Went down enjoyably. Overall, not my favorite, but a nice one."
"D: Not full flavored, there is flavor but it is not burdoning...the flavor is good, the mouthfeel is perfect, this is a very drinkable beer that is one of my favorites and could easily be an everyday beer."
"D - I was really surprised by this one. Lighter in taste than I was expecting, but it really worked well."
"I love this beer- it reminds me of the dark lagers in Munich that were so much better than some of the light colored lagers. So easy to drink, but also very tasty. Looks nice in a glass with a decent amount of head. Moderate carbonation. A little caramel and roasty in smell and taste, but very clean finish and nice aftertaste. A lot in common with nut brown ales, which I also like. I would say that this is one of Sam Adams better efforts for an everyday beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a tasting glass. The appearance is very dark with 1/2"" head which dissipates to a nice sticky lace. The nose has malt sweetness and figs and coffee, almost like a stout. The taste is really nice and balance initially sweet followed be enough hops to round out the flavor. This medium bodied beer makes you think you are drinking a stout, but the finish is more crisp and refreshing. Really nice drinkability for the flavor of the beer. I wish it was more readily available."
"This is the best value on the american market for beer. Although this is not my favorite beer, it's up there and it's always a trusty option when a bar doesn't have a good selection of beer. You can never go wrong with a Sam Adams product."
"D - A really good call. I had two bottles from my Sam Adams mix pack - I had originally planned on saving the other bottle, but it was so tasty and drinkable, I went ahead and had it. Nothing too outlandish, but a quality beer here."
"All together a nice brew that goes down real smooth. I think I might start being a Sam Adams fan."
"I love this beer by Sam Adams and I think this could be one of my favorite versions of beer. It pours a beautiful dark color and has wonderful rich coffee like flavor. This is one beer I want to enjoy again and again. Too bad it seems to be only available in a variety pack. This is one of Sam Adams very best!"
"D. A good beer that i would get again and surprisingly drinkable"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Deep brown color with dazzling ruby highlights. Ecru head of a half finger that displays average retention and lacing. Aromas of cocoa, milk chocolate, and graham cracker, with maybe a little sweetened coffee. Very alluring smell. Flavor is more roasty, with dark chocolate and some char to go along with some light caramel. Hops play a minor role but are spicy in nature and a welcome spot of balance. Mouthfeel is typically Sam Adams: just a little too thin to support the flavor profile. Still one of the best of their regular lineup."
"A nice schwarzbier, maybe not as flavorful as Sprecher's, but maybe a little easier to drink because of that. A nice beer from a good brewery."
"Overall: do it"
"Poured from bottle to new Sam Adams pint glass a deep dark brown with ruby red hues and an almost non existent cream head that quickly disolved with no lacing to speak of. It had a minimal malt aroma and a trace of caramel sweetness, but not the strong nose I had expected. Tastes like roasted malts with some sweetness of chocolate and caramel. Over carbonated and thin, very disapointing. A very drinkable beer, if you like thin, weak, overly carbonated false advertising. I can not understand the fascination with the swill these guys pump out. I try and go into every Sam Adams beer with an open mind but always walk away scratching my head. Just once I would like to say ""this is a great Sam Adam's Beer!"" Sadly I cannot say that here."
"D: Pretty good. Goes down smooth."
"My bottle of Samuel Adams Black Lager came from a 24 pack Brewmasters Collection. It quickly became my favorite of the box. It pours dark with a small head. It smells of burnt malt with a touch of caramel. It tastes exactly the same way but I can detect a little coffee flavor mixed in as well. This beer has a very pleasant flavor and a fantastic mouthfeel. It looks thick but I soon found out that that the opposite is true. It's light flavor and dark color make one interesting brew. I feel like this beer can stand up to most Schwarzbiers. Very drinkable and recommended."
"Poured this one aggressively out of the bottle and it still yielded little more than a thin tan head. Poor retention and lacing. The aroma was deep and ""blackened"" like charred meat, burnt malt and hints of hops at the end. The flavors were at first of bittersweet chocolate followed by black coffee and then at the end the smoky and blackened flavors kick in. Nice malt and hops balance but the finish is so black I find it hard not to think it would put many off. The mouthfeel is also a little off, too much carbonation causes it to be frothy and hard to enjoy for a beer this dark. It's not a bad beer, but it's also not a good example of the German schwarzbier style."
"A good solid Schwarzbier."
"The Scwarzbier.. don't see too many of them out there but they're unique to say the least. The color is jet black but it's light bodied, which still just stuns me. Tastes sort of smokey and has some chocolate sort of taste as well. Smell is a little below good but the rest of the beer is well done."
"d: Not full flavored, but the flavor is good, the mouthfeel is perfect for the style, a beer that screams session."
"Nice mouthfeel with a moderate carbonation and a nice session beer."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer that I would definately get again."
"Beer Its Not Just A beverage Beer Is Food"
"Good and interesting brew, you don't see this style done much."
"Not a bad beer, but I am not a huge Sams fan to begin with."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours thick and black-a stout like apperance. A decent head forms and a nice amount of lacing. It smells sweet and like chocalate. The initial taste is of sweet molases, followed by a light smoke, finished with a slight bitterness. The beer is medium to full bodied and very drinkable. This beer was much better than I expected, a worth while brew."
"Overall this is a very tasty lager. Big on flavor and body. I enjoy it, but I think I will switch to another beer after this one."
"M D - Medium bodied beer, flowed smoothly down. Very high quality beer, not your big hitter but alot of taste that is very refreshing. Although not my prefered style I could definately knock a couple of these back for sure."
"D - I would definitely have another and would share with friends... but they damn well better not take the last one."
"To my palate most Sam Adams beers are rather pedestrian but I enjoyed this one more than most. The nose is quite malty, reminiscent of chocolate malted milk balls with strong notes of coffee. The dark malts shine in the taste--dark chocolate and coffee with spicy hops providing balance but never stealing the stage. The mouthfeel is spot on - light but not watery."
"Broken record here, another very good session brew from SA. Possibly the best Sam Adams I have had."
"Feel is a little thinner than I would like for the style, although all around enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Very smooth, and sweetish. Chocolate malts dominate, but I don't see myself having more than 1 of these. Overall its decent."
"but not too sweet to be annoying,...very drinkable"
"Comment I prefer other beers over this. A little too sweet for a lager in my opinion. I'd drink it if offered but I'll pass on buying it again."
"A drinkable beer with a nice flavor. It is almost too sweet for me, but I will have it again in the future."
"Drinkability: Overall a very nice lager. Clean lager flavor lets the roasted malts shine. Excellent."
"D- Good beer and overall easy to drink."
"D: I like this one a lot. It's got some nice malt character and decent balance, and it's smooth and agreeable enough to enjoy without really making a huge effort."
"D- The carbonation was really the only off putting part of this beer."
"Poured black in color. Now I know why its called Black Lager. Had a nice head that hung around a while. Also had good lacing that left rings with every swallow. Head reminded me of the inside of caramel candy bar. That color. Kind of tan. Smelled of smokey malts, caramel, and coffee. Tasted like it smelled. Burnt or smokey malt. coffee and caramel. Mostly of coffee. Felt good in the mouth. Head felt thick in the mouth. Had some body. Very good beer. Sam Adams did a good job on this one."
"This is good, but it's a bit stout-like for my taste. I mean I love a stout, but this is a schwarzbier. Still very bood but needs more depth."
"Pours a pitch black into the Sam Adams specialty glass and is finished with a nice dark tan head. Head retention is excellent with a thick lacing left all round the glass. Smells of caramel, tea and subtle roasted nuts. Tastes of almost hidden smoked malts, some hops and a subtle base of sweetness. The paradox of color vs. taste is pleasing. You're expecting a heavy brew, but you get a tasty, but very drinkable beer here."
"I would recommend giving this a shot if your looking for a nice dark beer. Goes down well, and the tastes will have you nodding your head in agreement."
"The body and mouthfeel is much lighter than it's appearance suggests. Nice brew if feel like something lighter and not in the mood for a big satisfying malt bomb. An interesting style indeed."
"From a mixed 12 pack. I'm surprised that I liked this as much as I did. Pours a very deep amber, almost black color with a nice tan head. Aroma is chocolate with malt. Flavor is roasted malt, hints of coffee and chocolate. Very well balanced and a pretty good drink."
"I was pretty stunned by this one. Not at all what I expected and not bad."
"D- Goes down smooth and easy on the palate."
"I actually caught the caramel in the taste. Along with some coffee and dark chocolate as well. I thought it was a surprisingly deep beer and finished smoothly."
"I was very impressed with this beer. I never really expect anything exceptional from Sam Adams but this stuff is damn good."
"D - A great lager for sure, and an easy drinker. It is a little heavy and the dark malts make for a slightly more intense brew, so I doubt I would drink this all night long. A couple of these wouldn't be bad though."
"Poured a deep black into my glass mug from the bottle with a tan, fluffy head. Holding it up to the light, I could detect nice rubies around the edges. The head left a somewhat decent lace down the walls of the mug also. It has a nice sweet malty smell with a little hint of something else that i can't quite place. On the first sip I taste some nice malts and a little bit of that Schwarzbier tang that I've come to enjoy. The taste gets richer and more complex as it warms up. Add to all that a nice smooth finish and mouthfeel and you have one damn tasty and drinkable dark lager."
"Excellent product here, fantastic Schwarzbier by Sammy. Sweet aroma with some burnt notes,not too prominent but still enjoyable. Great pour, rich amber color with a really fluffy tan head and tons of lacing. Creamy as can be mouthfeel with a thick finish. Good flavor, sweet and tangy with roasted malts and that burnt taste found in the aroma. My 2nd Schwarz and I can now detect the common underlying flavor, different for sure this style can be very good as seen with this one."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite beers, that I don't see done a whole lot. Goes great with grill food."
"Af. A very pleasant and mild aftertaste of wheat bread and nuts."
"definately a good beer, something I would eat with brautwurst or another greasy smoky meat. A little thick and was not a fan of the syrupyness"
"Good departure from the average lager."
"The black lager lived up to its name in color. I was expecting a very rich flavor, and while sweet, it was lacking depth. Still, the sweetness lingered in the end and was not all that bad. It just tasted a little too thin for such a dark beer. Then again, this was my first beer of the schwarz variety..."
"D- I would rate this fairly high. Its good."
"From here, I'll stop. The beer is terrible. I highly suggest you avoid it."
"This beer poured a near-black with a brown tint and a big tan head with decent lacing. The smell was some bready malt sweetness. The taste was mostly sweet slightly-toasted malt with possibly some chocolate or coffee porter-like bits in the middle with a bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit watery with a surprising amount of carbonation. This beer sits a little heavy, but I could still imagine having two or three in a sitting without feeling too full."
"D-I would grab it again maybe would for sure drink it if it was around somewhere, would really like to try this one on tap"
"D: Drink this one year round it is very flavorful, satisfying also as an easy drinking session beer! Well done!"
"This beer is dominated by roast. There may be a bit too much for style but it is hard to argue with the end result. Black in color with ruby highlights. Good persistent head. Nice mouthfeel. Again lots of roast in this beer. Roast in the front and the back. Good beer."
"Very nice color, mahogany with red sides. Good head that lasts a while, and gives a nice creamy feel. Very nice nutty, chocolatey taste that stays on the palate. The smell is how it tastes, not overpoweringly strong but pleasant. This is one of my favorites for relaxing in the evening."
"This is a very nice example of a the rare (fom my experience) Schwarzbier style, and it's a great year-round brew."
"Pours a nearly black color with an average off-white head that settled into a cap. The aroma is malty. Roasted malt is quite present with other aromas of nuts and coffee, and perhaps a touch of wood and charcoal. The taste is a nice roasted caramel malt that reminds me of a mocha. Hints of burnt wood and bittersweet chocolate linger in the end. Not super big on flavor but in perfect balance. The feel is moderate with soft carbonation leading to a nice silky feel; finishes with a roasted bitterness and slight hop spiciness. Quite an easy drinking brew considering the nice roasted malt flavors. Just a nice combination of flavors and feel."
"This would be an easy beer to drink quite a few of. Plenty of character, and a very good interpretation of the style."
"This my second review of this beer. In the first one I said there was not much head. I don't know what the hell happened there but I got a lot of head when this one poured out. Must be because the bartender did it. Maybe beers on tap ARE better than from the bottle. It still has that delicious Hershey's Special Dark flavor and it's still creamy and smooth with little carbonation. For some reason I like it a little bit better this time. Perhaps it's because it's only my second beer of the day and I can judge it better or something. I like it. Very bood beer."
"Too understated and unremarkable for my tastes."
"This beer is decent, there are not too many schwarzbiers to choose from that are widely available, but there are some better ones out there. Probably would not buy a whole sixer of these, but it was nice to try a couple and certainly would not turn one down if offered!"
"Drinkability - Went in with low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. This is a solid brew that I will likely purchase more than once again."
"d- a good, solid beer. I'd have it again and I probably will buy it, but it's not an everyday type of thing."
"Poured from a bottle, with a drink before 9/08 date, into a pint glass. The pour is moderate that resulted in a 1/2"" beige head that fades kinda fast. Roasted, chocolate and coffee aromas dominate the nose. Coffee and chocolate are the initial tastes. Finishes a bit sweet. Could use more bittering and a drier finish. Good tastes but sweetness lowers the drinkability but still good enough for a couple."
"D - Great cheap beer to share with friends. This is one of my everyday beers when i'm not trying something new. It's good for any occasion. It's not special just good."
"This beer drinks very easy."
"Love this beer and would drink many more."
"I'd buy this again in 6-pack form but would be tentative to put it on tap."
"Recommended..."
"Scharzbier?? I'm in. The part of this site and tasting beers that I love is that now I will have to go search out for the ""best"" of the Schwarzbier's to try them."
"Closing: This brew, the Honey Porter, and the Irish Red are in the current Brewmaster's 6-pack and all three are tops for Samuel Adams beers, which to me still sets the standard for all the other micro-brewers out there!"
"Medium bodied and dry, just what I'd expect for the style that is essentially the lager version of a stout. Very clean, roasty and satisfying. A very solid brew and a great style; I wish other brewers would make more attempts at the Schwarzbier."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I'll definitely drink it again. Oh, and it left a pretty good lacing, too."
"Slick with a tingle of carbonation and slightly juicy; excellent drinkability."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with mild to moderate carbonation."
"A great beer from SA! I just wish this style was more widely produced."
"D: The flavor was very rich. Drinkability was nice, moderate by flavor, an easy drink."
"A good beer to bridge the gap"
"Overall and easy drinking beer that is very sessionable ."
"This pours a pale black color from the bottle and presents a beige head. The nose has lots of burnt and toasted malts followed by a quiet caramel presence. The flavor is also predominantly roasted malts with a gentle hop bitterness. The body is a bit too light and fizzy, but this is still a decent black lager."
"Pours almost black. Ruby highlights when held to light. Foamy tan head,with very good retention and lacing.Smell is of chocolate,and honey with maybe. Body is medium with some carbontion. Taste is of dark fruits,and chocolate.Hints of honey through out,and a black licorice in the finish. Really good!"
"D: A good drinkabale beer, I prefer only 1 or 2 of these, but worth a try."
"A great addition to the commercial fleet of Boston brews. May the Schwartz be with you!"
"D: Very drinkable. Easily my favorite Sam Adams. Has some complex flavors but is not too heavy. Very enjoyable."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew a nice offering from sam adams"
"MF & D- medium body and medium carbonation, mild in flavor make for a good drinker. non aggressive taste yet still an obviously americanized brew."
"D - Only thing that makes this beer less drinkable is the rich flavors of the malts. All in all, a very drinkable beer"
"I don't usually drink dark lagers or stouts, this beers smell and taste are a nice balance of beery goodness that delights my palate. The roasted caramel and chocolate malts give this beer a stout like taste with medium consistancy of a lager. Despite the interesting taste, I still think some complexity could be added to this beer. I think Samuel Adams brewers should try emulating Rogue Brewery beers which are complex but very drinkable."
"Overall, I think this is a fine beer, both in taste and going down, but the aftertaste is a drawback."
"D: A light bodied beer with nice complexity...definitely good sessionability. I must say I'm impressed with this one. I came in expecting less and got more."
"This beer is a Guinness wanna-be. I think it's a good beer, and I'd drink it again, but if I were in the mood for a Guinness I would probably just drink a Guinness and leave this one for the less sagacious of beer drinkers i.e. those who are not attending the TAP festival at Hunter Mountain this weekend."
"This is probably the beer that got me into Sam Adams again. In fact, having this one in Vegas right before my first poker tournament to calm the nerves is what inspired me to get the variety pack and try some others, such as the Scotch Ale, Brown Ale, and Boston Lager. This one was my favorite!"
"D - A good solid beer. This one is one of SA better beers. I wouldn't say it is terribly refreshing but this would be nice in fall or spring."
"D: A good representation of a oft overlooked style. If you're a Shwarzbier fan, go for it."
"The bottle claims a medium mouthfeel, but I would say on the lighter side of medium. A solid offering, but pales in comparison to the other SA brewmaster beers."
"D/O - A great session beer whose style is often forgotten about. This is one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams and I will definitely be drinking more of these. Cheers."
"D- Definitely drinkable. If you are looking for something refreshing on a hot day this might not be it. However a nice beer to go with dinner."
"T/M/D This is a very smooth drink. Not too much of a bitter taste is noted. I will be enjoying this one with its 5 friends."
"D: With such a light body, this beer is definitely drinkable. The taste is decent and the beer isn't too filling. Probably the most sessionable dark beer I've had."
"Drinkability: Definitely a drinkable beer. Mostly clean and light alcoho."
"D = This is a decent quaffing beer, would make a nice session beer, not sure I'd use it for much else though."
"I drank this one down pretty quickly, but it left a bit to be desired. I think I would just like more presence from all of the flavors involved. I enjoyed them very much, so give me more."
"Best by July notched on the bottle. Served in my SA Sensory Pint glass. Poured dark brown, almost black. Some red-brown highlights when backlit. Two-inch light tan head stretched from the stripe surrounding the glass, up to the lip and slightly over the top. Head was almost Guinness-esque out of the bottle, finally settling into a thin consistent layer of foam. Fair amount of lacing with decent adhesion. Scents of roasted malt and coffee; not overpowering but nicely balanced. Taste similar to nose with the addition of a subtle chocolate character and a mildly bitter hops presence at the finish. Lightly carbonated and also somewhat silky/milky at the same time. I really enjoy this brew and find it extremely sessionable; light bodied with presence."
"M/D: Slightly bitter leaves a slimy film in the mouth but is drinkable like a good Sam Adams brew."
"The nice thing was that it was on sale for only $12.50 a 12 pack, and at that price it maintains some good value. At it's usual price of $15.99 a six pack it's value is far less. It is smooth and engaging."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is very good. This is a very smooth beer that goes down extremely easy. I could drink this all night. Overall, it's a very good beer. Highly recommended."
"Usually Im not a fan of super malty flavored beers. But the roasted smokiness of the malts in this beer put it right up my alley. Beer looks good, smells good and tastes good. Not great but good. Feels great in the mouth. A very comfortable beer. Definitely a beer I could enjoy from time to time."
"Drinkability: It's very easy to drink; very smooth and appetizing. A delicious beer that is light enough to enjoy a few in a sitting."
"Sam Adams Black Lager pours a very, very dark brown which is actually a deep, dark red when held to a bright light. A nice, two-finger tan head forms but slowly settles. The beer smells of roasted coffee with a bit of fruitiness. The taste starts with some sweet chocolate followed by some roasted coffee notes. A slight bitterness shows up about five second after the swallow. The mouthfeel starts very smooth and a bit creamy, followed by a pop of carbonation on the tongue. Pretty tasty."
"Sam Adams' Black Lager is a unique beer. Rubied motor oil in color, when held to light. Traditional lager with a huge malt flavor and thick on the roasted coffee notes. big chocolate and caramel malt influence. not much for hops in this one, just a touch to spice it up a touch. drinks easy, although it's robust character and complex flavors might hold you down to a couple or three. not a traditional swilling lager."
"D - I love this beer. It is very complex for a lager. Highly recommend this and is relatively easy to find now a days."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my smokestack goblet. Pours an opaque black with just a little frothy head. Aroma is dark chocolate with a creamy coffee. Taste is bitter chocolate with a bit of smoke that comes through. Mouthfeel is thin and finishes dry. All and all this is a pretty solid beer."
"Drinkability would be average as this is almost cloying on the malts sweetness and sourness."
"D- I can nurse about four a day no problem. Very good but not something I'd just pound."
"All in all, not something I seek out, but I won't shy away from it in multi-packs."
"Drinkablity: A satisfying and refreshing brew. Unique."
"Good beer, try it."
"D: Overall not bad, well balanced aroma and flavor an enjoyable beer if just a tad on the bitter side. Good representation of the style and quite the easy drinker as well."
"Not particularly impressive."
"Taste is rather creamy, taste is mostly contributed by the roasted malt with some coffee bitterness contributing, some spice and even a little hop presence to balance things out a little bit, not overly sweet but just right."
"On a cool evening or sitting indoors I could drink a few of these. Good Stuff!"
"Not a bad lager..."
"Okay, so the beer pours dark maroon. The head is not that stable, but the lacing is nice. Smells like roasted malt, and spicy hops. Clean lager like taste is pleasing. The roasted character is quite well incorporated. Bitterness is mild, and lets the malt show its face. The carbonation lightens the brew up in texture a bit. This stuff is quite drinkable."
" Poured a dark brown almost black...looks very similar to coke. A small head which died in a minute to a ring around the glass. The smell was weak but i detected a little roasted coffee and chocolate smell. As for taste i was a bit disappointed. It was similar to the smell but not as much as I had hoped. It finishes good and is very drinkable."
"A good example of a similar style is New Belgium's 1554. Dark in color, yet highly drinkable and full of flavor."
"Very dark amber pour. Light carbonated head. I was a little surprised by the smell. Smoky maple syrup. There is also a slight artificially sweet smell. Not really happy with the nose. Very complicated flavor. smoky, burnt chocolate and a little fruity. Good mouthful and pretty drinkable. Fairly decent overall."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but I don't think I could enjoy more than one or two in a row. Definitely a good one to sit and enjoy though."
"D- Very drinkable. Fairly light and doesn't fill you up too quickly. Drinking a six pack in an evening isn't a challenge."
"Black with amber showing around bottom of glass. Two finger fizzy head on a good pour, sometimes I get carried away with agressive pour and this guy goes everywhere. Head reduces to ring and leaves solid lacing of small, almost soda like bubbles. Smell is solid, molasses, caramel and chocolate are represented. Taste is good, chocolaty and malty with dry finish. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable as it tastes great and isn't overly filling."
"I am not a huge schwarzbier person but I have had others that excited me more than this one, this one was very average. Appearance black with hints of red, one finger tan head that dissapeared a little quick. Smell was chocolate and malt taste was much the same with very little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel light to mediem body and mediem carbonation. Drinkability I supose I could have a few but I could do without it just as well."
"overall, i could drink a couple of these. a nice offering from sam adams."
"D-This is very easy to drink, and quite good."
"Pours a gorgeous nearly opaque dark brown with red ruby highlights. A huge head is formed, very off-white near tan color and great tracing. Lots of caramel, sweet malt, slight bitter chocolate, and some floral hops; coffee in the finish. A medium-thin mouthfeel, with flavors of light chocolate, slight roastiness, but not bitter. Overall it is very smooth, a light drinker with lots of flavor, and extremely clean. A moderate amount of Hallertau hops without any bitterness, but a balanced finish. There's also an interesting cola like flavor in the middle. A very enjoyable beer and a nice style, will try again."
"Drinkability- Perfectly fine schwartzbier. In fact it's rather good and quenching for sure. Not the best, but certainly worth trying. I'll be having another sometime down the line."
"A little less drinkable than better black lagers I've tried - again, a little heavy for the flavor profile. Solid commercial effort."
"Thick but watery. Has a bit of staying power. Enjoyable though not incredible. Highly drinkable."
"D - Very good, if I saw 12 packs of this I'd definitely indulge. This brew single-handedly changed my opinion of this brewery, I must admit the Cherry Wheat turned me off to them, but that was silly I know. More of a subconscious notion perhaps, but now that it's all behind us, I'll be looking out for more of their stuff."
"D - While subdued compared to other black lagers, the coffee-like finish makes it a bit less drinkable."
"Had before in the mixed case, tried here after several packaged all by itslelf. Pours black with some browns that come out in the sunlight. Thick white tan head has decent lacing and retention. Toasted malty nose. Flavors of cocoa, molasses, and cola come along rather smoothly. Mouthfeel started off creamy, yet finished rather dry. Pretty drinkable brew that reminded me of the better brews in the Czech Republic."
"D - easy to drink and at just under 5% abv, this is a nice refreshing beer to enjoy more than one of."
"D - Very drinkable, great version of a Schwarzbier. Good effort by Sam Adams, recommended."
"D - I could drink two or three of these. Easy to drink and a good transition beer. One of my favorite Sam Adams."
"d- one of my favorite session beers, its not spectaculare but its very enjoyable"
"Despite the color, my experience has shown the style to not be a good deal heavier than it's lighter German counterparts. This, on the other hand, is a touch thicker. Still, the carbonation is just fine and the overall drinkability is exceptional. It's a good thing I can't find this in anything other than the Brewmaster's Sampler because I'd drink far too much of this. Stands alongside the Oktoberfest as SA's best beer in my estimation."
"d - a very good beer. A nice bridge between a crisp lager and a strong stout. One of my favorite sam adams, especially since this is readily available in a 6 pack."
"Drinkability is fairly good for a dark beer. If you get the chance, try eaten a roasted malt before drinking this beer. It really brings out the burnt flavor and enhances the beer."
"I liked this one alot. I've only had a few of this style, but BBC has done a very good job on creating a very drinkable, sessionable beer. Hop heads will be disappointed, but this is a Black for the ""masses"". I will definitely drink this again. Good job BBC."
"Drinkability is pretty good - I wouldn't mind having a few of these, although it wouldn't be the first beer (or even the first Sam Adams) I would go for if I were out."
"Note: I plan on retasting again because while doing this test, I think I might be feeling a cold coming on and I would like to retest to make sure I didn't miss sense or taste anything."
"Pours what seems like a cola color, but held to light is more ruby red but not copperish. Poured a mountainous head that didn't die down to some heavy carbonation. There is a malt presence, perhaps you can pick up some smoke, in the smell but there's no defining smell. The taste picks up coffee and chocolate malts, more of the later because there isn't a drying, sharp afterbite at all. The label says caramel, and I didn't really taste it, but that coupled with the less hops could be why it is a very smooth, slippery beer. Almost like a stout-light, to bastardize it, this is a very nice beer to have."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is alot lighter and smoother than I expected it to be making it a bit more sessionable brew than a stout. It wouldn't be uncommon to be able to drink a few of these in a row."
"I think I like Schwarzbier! This is the second one I've had and it's really pretty good. Because of its mildness and hint of sweetness, I think this would be pretty good with spicy or heavily seasoned food. And contrary to its dark heavy look, this really doesn't have a very heavy taste. Good stuff."
"D: This is easy drinking but something that I would enjoy one or two of evry now and then. Not something I would have for a session."
"It's nicely carbonated, standing well during a sporting event and allowing the flavors to work their magic. It's quite good, and is a slightly smoother version of Sprecher's excellent Black Bavarian. Grab it and thank yourself later."
"Overall, I really love this beer. Probably my favorite from Sam Adams."
"Black but clear (i.e. not cloudy), this brew greets you with a nose of sweet and Worcestershire sauce. The flavors reveal tar, and syrup, with perhaps fewer hops than I'd hope for. It's also kinda spritzy. The finish is ok, but nothing to write home about. Overall, not bad, but too sweet and chocolately for my liking."
"D: A little on the heavier side... a tasty enough beer, but I might find myself taking it pretty easy on this one when all is said and done."
"Medium bodied and featuring a pretty high carbonation level - I repeatedly swirled much of this out until the beer was more satisfactory. I'd have it again - quite refreshing."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, a good session beer on a cold night for sure. I like the flavor and want to drink more."
"This was a very pleasant lager. The yeast gave it a smooth taste and the choice and amount of malt used were appropriate to keeping this as a drinkable lager. I felt it was very soft and very drinkable. At a modest price, it should be tried by anyone who has access to it."
"A very pleasant surprise from SA. I was not expecting this to have nearly the complexity that it does. It pours a very ruby dark color, although clear when held up to the light, with a tannish head that hangs around for a little while and does lace. The smell is molasses, caramel, burnt malts, some chocolate, and some toffee. This is a medium bodied, moderately carbonated lager, with a very creamy mouthfeel and taste. This is a rather chewy beer with lots of character. I'm tasting some sweet malts, toasted bready grains, caramel but not overly sweet or cloying, some cocoa hints, maybe a tad bit of heavy fruit of the prune or fig variety. There is some lingering aftertaste that is a tad bit sourish, tart, and not too terribly pleasing, but aside from that one weakness which diminishes its drinkability, this is a very nice beer well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Yet another impressive selection from Sam Adams. I had to wait a while for my local beer store to get this in because it seems to sell out as soon as it hits the shelves around here. It was worth the wait."
"D--Maybe one of my favorites from SA. Very refreshing beer. Nice switch in the winter from heavy ales."
"D: very drinkable. a tasty Black Lager."
"Overall its a decent six pack, one of the better Sam Adams I've had; it does the job its been asked."
"This is another let down for me with the Brewmaster's Collection. I remember liking this beer a few years back, I guess my palate has changed. I don't think I will try this again."
"It's a good beer and one that I would probably drink again. It's a little heavier than I was expecting in all areas, but in and of itself, great, great flavor and aroma."
"Pours a nice dark caramel color, not quite black. Head is thin, lacing OK. Smell has chestnuts and sweet malt with pepper and chicory in background. Taste has a nice toasted malt which is slightly sweet. Finish is smooth with a little roasted pepper in the background. Mouthfeel is good with enough carbonation. Drinkability is very good. This beer just sits well with me. I could drink one after the other (if I didn't have to be anywhere the next day)."
"pours a very dark color like color with a dark colored head. smell is kinda weak, some obvious strong malt character, also some chocolate and toffee scents run through as well. taste is really enjoyable, it has a wonderful creaminess to it, especially the head. almost like vanilla ice cream, the thick mouth feel is accompanied buy a rich maltiness. very good beer, possibly my fave from sam adams, i had this ages ago when i first got away from BMC, and i remember hating this, now conversely as i've opened my beer horizons i really enjoy it, it s a good beer for sure."
"Pours a dark brown rather than black color as the name would suggest. Small head but after it diminishes it does hang around pretty well. The smell is raosted nuttiness --hazelnuts, chestnuts and lots of other good ones. Taste is much the same with some robust barley and malt flavor up front followed by the nutty elements on the finish. This is an excellent and extremely drinkable beer . I guess I am fairly new to trying this style. I like it a lot."
"Good drinkability as the ABV isn't too high and it's not too filling. I could drink a few of these back to back."
"I enjoyed this beer today in a pint glass out of a 12oz. bottle from the Brewmaster's Collection Mix Pack. It looked delicious and dark with a robust white head. The malts were apparent in the nose and there was a hint of rich fruit as well. The taste is the star of the show is this brew. The people I tried it with all recognized the uncommonly long, blooming finish that this beer has. The beer is extraordinarily well-balanced and enjoyable to drink. I'm usually not quite this enthusiastic about Sam Adams brews but the people at the Boston Beer Co. have a real winner with this lager."
"D: Nice, sweet taste with roasted notes makes in an overall good beer and easy to drink. Silky smooth body makes it easy to go down."
"I'll drink another one though."
"A remarkably smooth and very well made black lager. This beer has an enticing chocolate aroma with some good looks, too. The color is a very, very, dark brown. This beer poured with an incredible amount of foam that slowly settled to an off-white, rocky head and then later, a collar of foam. The chocolate flavors are good, the hop bitterness is right, but perhaps this beer is a bit too thin? Never mind, because this (very) dark lager is so smooth and I can overlook the almost watery body. The finish is very pleasant with an almost molasses-like character that briefly show up beforehand. A very delicious and very drinkable dark lager."
"I've been eyeing this stuff for some time, never wanting to commit to a 6-pack ""sight unseen"". I finally got a chance to buy a single bottle as part of a mix-you-own 6-pack so here I am trying it. It pours a nice dark brown-black color with a thick head. The aroma is roasted malts, not quite burnt. The flavor was pretty good, a little chocolate and roasted sweet malts, a hint of bitterness at the end of each drink. Very good schwarzbier, at least comparable to the very few others I've had."
"Pours a dark, blackish red. If that makes sense. The appearance is the best thing about it. I'm not overly familiar with the Schwarzbier formula, but there should be going on here than a deep malt taste, right? There's no roasting, not much in the way of hops, fruits, chocolate, etc. .... just malts. It's a solid beer, but nothing special."
"Pours a very dark red color with a thin lace of head. Smell is very malty and a little sweet and fruity. Goes down very smooth and is lightly carbonated. Taste is malty and dank with a little bitterness to it. It's been awhile since I've had this one, but it's an above average beer. Only schwarzbier I've had, but I give it a thumbs up."
"D, notes: I canÂ’t believe itÂ’s taken me 170+ beers to review a Sam Adams offering. Highly drinkable. Meets all the flavor characteristics of a Schwarz. Refreshing."
"I am not a SA cheerleader by any stretch of the imagination but this...this is a damn good beer. Cheers!"
"Overall a good beer, a rare style. Nice to see it. Would purchase again."
"Easy to drink, but a bit of a letdown after the SA Honey Porter I was just drinking. My first schwarzbier so I can't compare with others of the type."
"This is a great drinkable beer. It is submitted for style as a schwarzbier but that is not what I would categorize it as. Has a great dark head that did not dissipate.A little overcarbonated. Smooth taste with a nice malt profile that does not overwhelm. The hops are perfectly balanced in the background with little to no hop flavor or aroma."
"Mouthfeel, is medium."
"A nice schwarzbier from a macro company that continues to surprise us. I would recommend New Belgium's 1554 over this one, but if you see it pick it up for the hell of it. For the price its a great buy, comparitively."
"D - This is a very good dark beer. Very sessionable."
"This is one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams. This pours a beautiful dark brown, almost ruby red color with a nice head that lingers for a few minutes and does leave some lacing. It's got a dark, malty flavor with just a hint of hops to it that doesn't try to do to much. It's very drinkable, a nice cool weather beer that I enjoy on a regular basis."
"Drinkability - Very nice beer, would be a good choice for a flavorful session. Very smooth and well balanced. Tastes similar to SA Honey Porter, just lacking the sweet honey aftertastes."
"The aftertaste is strong and the roasted malts just linger on my tastebuds. Really a nice beer and I am glad that Samuel Adams decided to make this beer."
"love dark beer! this is one of my favorite sam adams brews. It has a deep sort of coffee roasted flavor. i think if you like strong stouts or porters and like a good lager you will like this. my favorite out of the 6 pack with brown ale, honey porter and black lager definately worth a try and a good beer thats easy to find"
"Mouthfeel is is medium bodied, slightly spiced, with a dry finish."
"D: Never had this style before. All in all, a very interesting beer. The style description says ""...looking for a lighter beer, but one with depth of colour and taste"". I think that sums it up, this is a lighter beer that has more going on than a BMC but won't kill you with alcohol. Definitely worth trying."
"D- Fairly drinkable, good with meals mostly. Worth having around, but I probably wouldn't drink more than two or three."
"D- Not bad, I would not turn it down if offered to me, and may buy again in a variety pack. I would not go out and search for a six pack of it."
"Overall, this is a good solid beer. My favorite cold weather lager. I have fond memories of drinking this brew while it snowed outside my window. Of course that was before I moved waaay south!"
"D - Easily drinkable but not a lot of flavor or complexity. It is quite clean, however and overall it is a decent example of a black lager."
"Not too bad. Nothing too complex but good over all."
"I really enjoyed the taste. Not a big beer but has the flavors of the heavier brews. Malt, chocolate, and coffee all come through to make for a satisfying experience. It might be a little overcarbonated but I didn't mind. This would make a good introductory to people for a wider beer perspective. Being Sam Adams it should be available just about everywhere also. Is it just me or does the name ""Black Lager"" seem unappealing? I think that is why it took me so long to give this beer a taste."
"I drank this one down pretty quickly, but it left a bit to be desired. I think I would just like more presence from all of the flavors involved. I enjoyed them very much, so give me more."
"The appearance was great. A dark, roasty pour made me anxious to try it. The smell however was a bit weak. The basic ingredients could be smelled: chocolate, caramel and sweet spice. But I really wanted something strong to smell and this drink lacked that kind of punch. However, the taste was amazing. Not heavy at all, and yet all those typically thick ingredients were apparent. Because of its relative lightness, this is definitely a drink many people could enjoy, especially with its flavors that are often found in heavier drinks."
"Drinkability- A solid brew, a little heavy, but a couple would be no problem."
"D: Could put a few of these away, a fine Schwarzbier, one of my dad's favourites, a very unique style to be had for sure."
"Another from the sampler, #2 Pours deep root-beer brown w/ a creamy head which dissapates quickly, good lacing; very malty nose w/ a ""baked"" aroma, hop aroma does come through w/ a poss. diacetyl undertone; the flavor of roasted & chocolate malts really complement the sweetness slight hop prescence also; nice rich med bodied, very dextrinous; quite drinkable, this is really good, i can see myself knocking back quite a few of these this winter"
"Not as thick as you would expect from a lager, but brewed very well nonetheless."
"Poured into a pint glass, Poured a very dark brown, almost black color, with a whitish cream head. The scent was of roasted malt and kinda smoky. The mouth feel was suprisingly light. The taste was coffeeish with a caramel hint. Very good to my suprise. Definatly one of the more intriguing beers I've had. Wouldn't mind getting more of this for future drinking pleasure."
"Medium body with a dry, slightly astringent finish. The carbonation is persistent enough that even at the end of my glass, I feel the tingle on my tongue. A very drinkable offering from Koch & BBC, perhaps my favorite of their beers that I've tried."
"Poured a dark brown color with a light brown head that leaves lacing on the glass. Smell was good hints of coffee. Taste is very enjoyable malts stick out. I was expecting this to feel heavier than it is good body and smooth. This is a very easy to brink beer not too heavy and very smooth I would get this again if I ever see it at the store again."
"12 oz. bottle from the Samuel Adams mix pack. Wonderful smell of roasted caramel and coffee, but not very powerful, which isn't a bad thing, in my opinion. The taste was wonderful. Roasted caramel, coffee, very smokey flavors, but not overpowering like some porters and stouts. A perfect break from those stronger drinks, but still getting that distinct flavor. I was seriously considering giving this a 4.5 on taste, but might hold off on that. Overall, delicious beer and probably my favorite from Sam Adams now, but not sure if I could down too many as it was medium-bodied and the flavors remind you that you're getting full."
"I found this beer in the brewmaster's collection at my local Kroger. Poured into a chilled lager mug. The first thing you will notice is how dark it is. When they said ""black"" lager they mean't it! It has a nice creamy head. It drinks VERY smooth! That should be expected for a lager. Really, this brew reminded me of a dunkel I brewed in my basement. This is certainly worth picking up again. Give it a shot before beers prices go through the roof!"
"Overall this is built for drinking. Dark in appearance but lighter in body. This one could fool you."
"D: A lot of burnt dry flavor which makes this more of a novelty in my book."
"Drinkability - This beer wasn't bad. I like the dark beer taste without the heaviness."
"VERY smooth for as dark as it was. I was really surprised. I'm not a ""hophead"" so this was my favorite in the Brewmaster's Collection case. Hardly any hops to speak of, and such a smoothness...even in the finish. Very nice. Smooth, slightly creamy, yet thin enough to drink a few. HIGHLY recommended by me!!!! Remember though...one must not be in love with the hop flower to appreciate this malty lager. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Overall - A very good Schwarzbier - as good as any German versions i've tried... recommended..."
"Rather tasty and enjoyable."
"Pours with a one finger head. Looks more dark brown then black, with a small hop smell. Not very malty or hoppy, but first you taste the hops, then you taste a wide sweet malt. Not a terribly complex beer, but good, and a potent potable. If you like the style, then get a sixer."
"Could not drink a lot of these, heavy for style of beer"
"Pours a dark black color with a one finger head. Aroma is smooth and malty, with roasted characteristics that are reminiscent of a porter. Taste is very smooth and roasty, flavorful and yet, finishes clean just like a lager. I'm loving the aftertaste here. A second sip confirms more of the same. Mmm. So smooth, roasty and very much like a lager as the style dictates. I love this beer. One of Sam Adams' better efforts."
"Drinkability is great! Wish the bottled version was so rich. This is definitely for the on-tap version, distinctly superior to the bottled version last sampled a year ago. Beer compares very favorably against German and Czech import schwarzbiers."
"D - Lowish ABV% and full of flavour but not too full on - If it was more readily available here it would be a regular in my drinking line up."
" Overall I am still not really sure what a black lager is supposed to be other then a light porter which is really what I reviewed this based off of. I thought it was a more then decent light porter and in facr quite drinkable. Worthy of being in the brewmaster selection, sure. This was really pretty good. My only thing I would have liked to see would have it be a little thicker. Other then that I thought it was quite good and would defiantly try one again."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a slight hint of amber red. It had a heavy head that settled into a nice lacing. It had a roasted dark chocolate smell with a little bit of a malt quality. The taste is roasted and smoky with sweet malt back. It has a very creamy feel but a light finish. And not too much bite. ItÂ’s a subtle beer with a rich flavor and a light body. If you like dark beers this is an easy one to drink but it lacks the heaviness that you may be looking for. Sam Adams never disappoints and this beer is certainly worth a try."
"One of my favorite Sam Adams brews. It has a wonderful black appearance that allows just enough light to shine through when you hold it up to give it a little shine. A very nice earthy, rich, coffee scent to it. It goes down very smooth, with a wonderful rich, dark, coffee-like flavor. Definitely worth a try or a six-pack if you like dark lagers."
"loved everything about this beer-"
"D-Not very drinkable. I don't like heavy, thick beers. I like a lot of flavor (e.g. a Vienna or an IPA), but I don't like a heavy beer that drags you down. To date, Sam BL is my favorite daily drinker, so this one was a let down. Got it in a seasonal sampler."
"Notes: this beer is upfront. it's not like the west coast craft beers that come off so sweet and complex. this is for people that like their coffee black. it's all coffee basically. i like this beer with sweet barbecue. the sweetness from the sauce adds sugars to it and brings out more candied fruit notes."
"A nice beer if you're in the mood for something dark, reminds me of a porter."
"Overall, good brew. Very drinkable."
"Sampled from 12 oz. bottle as part of a mixed 6 pack. Pours very dark almost black, but when held to light its more of a deep cranberry red. Nice 2 finger tan head intially but quickly dissolves leaving a thin layer behind. Very little last. Smell is off coffee and chocolate. very dark smell to it. Taste is pretty good, coffee and dark chocolate dominate the flavor but there seems to be a hint of hops. Lower carbonation and somewhat creamy taste, medium mouthfeel. Overall a pretty good beer, almost got better as temperature increased. Not a bad offering from Sam."
"Drinkability: A very good beer, goes down smooth and has good solid flavour."
"1008"
"M/D- Much lighter than expected, and for such a dark beer a bit watery. Interesting flavors, and I can see why some might love it, but not quite my thing...I do imagine that I will drink another one or two this winter though."
"As you would expect from a beer called black lager, this nice looking beer pours a dark brown or garnet with a medium head with great retention. Aroma is malty, milk chocolate and light molasses. Despite being as dark as a stout, the taste is light and chocolaty with a smoked characteristic. Not much of an appearance by the hops, but that is to be expected. Not much bitterness, but this beer is quite refreshing, like a lager. One of the few dark beers I wouldn't mind having on a hot day. One of Boston Beer's best offerings in my opinion."
"I decent brew but I hope that Sam Adams can give it a little more balance in the future."
"I imagine this would pair well with some hearty grilled fare."
"D - I plan on stocking some in the fridge for the next couple of weeks as they are so easy to get a hold of and so easy to drink"
"Black beer with a finger of white head and nice lacing. Looks great, although its my first schwarzbier, so it might just be average for the style. I'm giving it top marks anyway. Nose is licorice, coffee, some spices. Light sweet malt shows up too. Taste is roasted malt up front - almost stout-like. Some spiciness. It's good, although not particularly complex. Solid hoppy aftertaste. Feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. I like this one a lot. Seems like it'd be a really good session beer."
""
"Wow, what a tasty beer! The semi-sweet chocolate and bitter coffee bean flavor really come through, and the sweet caramel malt compliments the rich flavors nicely. The mouthfeel is medium and somewhat creamy. Overall I'm a big fan of the seldom-used Schwarzbier style, and I'm glad to see Sam Adams made such an excellent version of one. Recommended highly."
"Notes: Deceptively light-tasting for the color of this brew. With the opaque blackness I was expecting something very filling, but that just goes to show how things do not always meet the eye, especially with beers... At 4.9% this is a great and surprisingly sessionable beer. If you love the roasted and deep chocolate flavors in beer, then this one is for you. Compare to a stout or porter..."
"D: This black lager has its better qualities, however there's something about this beer that feels like it's holding back. For the style, it's not a bad representation, but it doesn't deserve an excellent rating."
"Although I usually steer towards ales, I enjoyed this lager very much. Poured very dark brown to black from bottle with creamy white head that it didnÂ’t retain very long. Rich malty flavor with a hint of hops. I think the Boston Beer Company is under-rated as they make a great variety of good beers. As they have become available nationwide I think they are taken for granted and are not the ""in"" beer like the regional micro-brews."
"Opaque and sable, it looks like a porter or stout. Aroma is stouty and inviting - strong roast smell with overtone of molasses and a hint of salt. Flavor has both malt and hop components with smoky and coffee tones and just a whisper of sweetness. Though it does not have quite the nice thick feel of a good stout or porter, it is very satisfying and enjoyable. Very different from any lager I have ever tried!"
"All in all, the experience of drinking this from the new glass is a favorable one to when I reviewed this 1 1/2 years ago. I have unjustly ingnored this beer in the past, along with the style (granted, there's not a lot of schwarzbiers in my neck of the woods), but I think I'll be getting it more often."
"DA: ooooh yeah. This beer in this glass is pretty satisfying."
"A tasty beer. Probably would trade some of its sweetness for additional dark malt, but it's to style and quite good as-is, thanks."
"D- Not bad for an Amero black themed lager...errr I mean Schwarzbier lol"
"A fine beer which is great for all occasions. The smell is sweet and thick with no off tones. The appearance is beautiful although the head thick but dissappointingly short lived. This is a great tasting beer that is not overpowering. I highly suggest trying this beer. Its certainly not a favorite of mine but I would never turn it down. For the money and the style, another great Sam Adams."
"I poured it into a glass and got a nice thick tan head that covered a dark brown, almost black, body. The head lasted for some time and has some excellent lacing. I must admit that on this beer I could barely smell anything, just a few malt odors and a mild coffee aroma, even after I agitated this lager in the cup for a bit I could only make out these two faint aromas. The taste on the other hand was absolutely great, it is very sharp and crisp when it first hits your tongue, slightly bitter afterwards and goes down with a semi-dry bitter aftertaste, and it has a sweet undertone overall."
"d: Very drinkable, balanced."
"Drinkability: About as rousing and stirring as a light lager can get!!"
"Not a bad choice. But if you're looking for more complexity in this mix pack, I'd select the Honey Porter."
"Overall, this is a delicious, refreshing and reasonably-priced brew that will definitely remain in regular rotation in my fridge."
"Overall a good beer that I think will be a staple in my fridge."
"Pours a not quite opaque black that shows some dark ruby highlights and presents a decent frothy head. The aroma is dominated by dark malts with just a hint of hops. The taste is a good blend of chocolate and dark malts against a decent hop backbone. The beer is light and crisp with decent carbonation. Even on a warm early summer night, this beer provides all the refreshment you'd expect from a much lighter lager."
"Overall, quite a tasty brew. Looking at Sam's limited releases, they are quite nice. This is a beer that I'll happily drink again, and would be a good ""transitional"" beer, for those that are afraid of ""those dark beers""... Recommended."
"D - Overall a pretty refreshing and quaffable brew, just not that big on taste."
"this brew is very well balanced. the roastiness is not overdone (easily accomplished with a schwarzbier), and the caramel and malts are left to the background, letting the roastiness take the focus. cheers to Sam Adams, you've created another phenomenal brew."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is reasonable, overall very smooth with a nice touch of roastiness to give it some character. Very drinkable, would have it again, and would also consider it a session candidate."
"Pours from the bottle a clear dark brown color with subtle burgundy hues. Faint, subdued aromas of toasted wheat bread and malt, dark caramels, molasses and chocolate. Maintains a beautiful thick and dense tan head with intricate lacing patterns throughout the glass. Palate is pleasantly thick, full and creamy. Flavor profile much more satisfying and assertive as comapered to the aromas. Nice notes of dark roasted malts, burnt caramel candies, cocoa, with a faint hint of molasses-like sweetness and Noble hop spiciness in the finish. Very drinkable as a session beer and a solid rendition of the style."
"Drinkability is also good, if you like your beers on the sweet side. Still easy to drink with a good heft, and a good choice if you're looking for something lighter than a porter."
"A few months after this review, I got some more of this. No changes in the score, but I popped the top of one that had in sitting in my trunk for a week. In other words, I consumed it at room temperature. It was pretty tasty, and the intensity of the flavor is greater. Try one out the next time you get a 6-pack of this."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a decent head and very spotty lacing. The nose is lightly sweet and malty followed by lightly toasted grain. The taste is similar- nicely balanced maltiness and toasty grain, but relatively dry. The mouthfeel is soft, rounded and creamy. Even though there is a little sweetness in this one, no real stickiness. Nicely done, and a very nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth velvet, the fine carbonation feels really good on the tongue."
"D: Quite enjoyable. I found this to be very refreshing and dare I say, sessionable."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. This is one for all occasions."
"The taste was not quit as bad as the smell. The taste had a sour and tart feel on the palate. It was not a pleasant lager flavor. The sour taste of the roasted malts turned me off!"
"Goes good with Saurkraut. And potatoes. German cuisine."
"perhaps with desert as well"
"This beer pours a very dark, if not black, color with amber highlights. The smell is mild with a hint of roasted malt. The taste is rather strong of the malt. The mouthfeel is similar to a porter. This is a heavy beer, as one might expect, and is therefore not good as a session beer."
"An easy-to-drink crossover beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark brown to black in color, but this is a much thinner pour than other dark beers. The head is white and strong. A bunch of lacing is left on the surface. Licorice, chocolate, and roasted coffee are present in the smell, which is good, but none are dominant nor are they all that inviting. There is a citrus hoppy sourness that is immediately evident in the taste which is then followed by a touch of chocolate and finishes dry. Mouthfeel is thin - not that this is bad, but with darker beers I expect more creaminess or body, this is quite thin. As alternative to heavy dark beers (i.e. russian imperial stouts), this is a great thing - a dark beer that drinks like a much lighter style. Recommended."
"D: Great black lager from a large brewery. Nice flavors, great smell. Little too sweet, and the hops are easy to miss, but this is a good find in a local convenience store!"
"Beer truly is a black beer. It had no distinctive smell. I enjoyed the sweet caramel and roasted taste. I found it to have a good deal of carbonation that one usually sees with a lager. It had a sweet caramel flavor but not overwhelming where it would be considered too sweet. I have not had too many of Samuel Adams beers but I would rate this as my favorite. I would be able to have several of these to pass an evening."
" ~ I would order another Samuel Adams - Black Lager. This is a beer that's easy to drink with it's watery finish. I'd really like to give this a try from a tap. Anyone know where I can get a Black Lager on tap?"
"This is by far my favorite sam adams and I've had virtually all of their non limited edition beers."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark chocolate, with a decent tan head - nose of sweet roasted malts , some bitter sweet chocolate , and silky Â– taste of bitter sweet chocolate , malt , mild bitterness , and hint of espresso - body is light , silky , and with medium carbonation Â– aftertaste of chocolate , malt , and roasted"
"There's hardly any carbonation, but I wouldn't call it a ""heavy"" beer. Not bad, but I won't be rushing back for another."
"Good flavor, solid mouthfeel and low ABV make for one sessionable beer. Nicely done."
"D - A great american black lager. Sweet, supple and bready flavors make for a brew that is quaffable, delightful, sessionable, and easy to enjoy in a variety of settings. I happened to enjoy mine with a cheesesteak pizza."
"Highly recommend trying this and right now with the Brewers Special Pack, you get to try several different styles at a great price. (The Anderson's has it $3 off )"
"Appearance has a deep dark reddish brown having a off white healthy head. Smell of roasted malts, slight dry fruits, but not much else. Taste has a good balance between the malt, hops and carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good, but leaves a slight bitter and dry aftertaste."
"D: Definitely a nice beer and definitely one of BBC's best. Smooth and easy to drink. Recommended."
"I'm not in love with the black lager, but I could take down a few without really thinking about it. I like the balanced and understated profile (almost like a ""light"" version of some porters). Has its pros and cons, overall it's okay."
"Very drinkable when cool. More flavors come out when it warms slightly"
"Pours a totally opaque black that betrays only the slightest ruby highlights when held up to direct light. Very nice aroma of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and some dextrine vanilla notes. It's a smooth, almost creamy aroma. On the palate, this beer is big and juicy, with plenty of active carbonation and a texture that treads perfectly between creamy smoothness and a light, racy touch. Malt bitterness is pronounced up front before morphing into something a that's a touch sweeter and acidic. Hop snap toward the end. This is an excellent beer and one of my favorites from Sam Adams. It's got rich flavors, sessionability and authenticity. Very well done."
"pours almost pitch black with hints of red. kind of a fizzy looking head. not really spectacular. the smell is definitly giving off some fresh chocolate notes. slight roasted aroma, some sweetness. the taste is real nice. mellow on the roast, sweet chocolate, decent hop balance. pretty damn drinkable. i'm kind of suprised. real nice."
"The beer poured nice smooth into the glass. It was a very dark colour with a tan two finger head. The smell was a warm smokey malt taste and was sweet-esque with a nice caramel under tone to the scent. The taste was definiatly above average. It started very rich and smokey but had a nice sweet after taste. The mouthfeel was rather satisfactory; not too heavy but definately not too light. It went down semi smooth. Drinkability was above average."
"The beer pours black into my glass with an off-white head, leaving a little lacing as I sip. The aroma is moderately roasted, a little sweet, and there is a hint of spicy hops in the background. The flavor is a nice balance of medium-low sweetness, moderately roasted, and a moderate hop/roast bitterness to balance things out. There is also a little bit of hop flavor that hits at the swallow. The mouthfeel is rather creamy, medium body, and carbonation moderate. Overall this is one the best offerings by Sam Adams. The nose is inviting, flavor has good balance, but still leaves you with a little something after the swallow. The creamy mouthfeel and medium body mean this is quite a drinkable beer. Grab a 6er!"
"Could drink a sixer of this quite easily. It's not world class, but it's simply a well made beer. The Boston Beer Company gets flak in some beer circles and sure they aren't Stone or Bells.. but man are some of the better efforts they put out ever drinkable."
"Drinkabilty- Very good, no matter what styles of beer you drink. Like somebody else said, this is a good a comfort type of brew!"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Wonderful dark color with very little light getting through. Nice head that hangs on thru sample. The smell of the roasted malts is nice with a slight smoky smell behind it. The taste is more towards a porter IMHO. The mouthfeel is even, not too heavy and certainly not light. The roasted coffee and caramel taste coats the mouth and lingers . This was a nice beer and would get it again."
"D: If your into darker beers, then I highly recommend this tasty concoction. It's perfect for year-round consumption, but I have a feeling it would go well with a nice summer BBQ (mmm...ribs!). This is by far a comfort type of brew!"
"D - Overall pretty tasty but overly carbonated."
"The beer poured nice and dark with a light brown head, but the head was thin. It smelled a little of coffee and chocolate. It tasted of coffee as well, but was not a strong flavor. It was dry, as a schwarxbier should, not sweet like a Bavarian Dunkel. It was well carbonated as well. I could enjoy this beer anytime except for hot weather."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty smooth, but very malty. since its think I probably couldn't drink more then one or two of these a night."
"Poured into a nonic -with sevral pours- great, voluminous head on this, medium-tan in color, and with nice lacing as well. Nose is pretty much on-par for the style, which is a very good thing indeed - notes of toffee, caramel, roasted malts, and a hint of molasses. This is my kind of beer! Color is a dark brown with a touch of crimson, and brilliant. Carbonation seems rather gentle on the tongue, and overallthis seems to just glide effortlessly across the palate. The base of this drinking experience is provided by the roasted and dark malts, with echoes of the toffee and caramel from the nose, along with a lighter taste of espresso and just a touch of light biterness. Yet there are some delicate fruit notes as well, light notes of ripe red apples and sour cherry, and yes, it's also a touch metallic - but in a good way. Samuel Adams Black Lager might strike some as light or thin on the palate, but it's on style, and moreover is far less a 'big beer' than an excellent session drink. I look forward to finding this on draught!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on the label. Got as part of a sampler. Actually the 3rd time I got this in a sampler and it's the 1st time that the beer wasn't horrible off. The quality of SA here is very hit or miss. The distributor really needs to step it up. Anyway....was a black color with dark mahagony highlights. The smell was faint but had dark roasted malts. Mouthfeel was average. The taste was just alright. I've really gotten in this style this year and have had several and this was in the bottom third. Mostly bland with no risk taking at all. I really don't get the Sam Adams hype. Other than the Boston Lager, the rest of just average at best. Overall, average beer that is not worth seeking out unless you find in a friend's fridge and just want to try it. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Bottle courtesy of Shp555: Poured a deep black color ale with a nice foamy head with some pretty good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some chocolate notes is quite good. Taste is a nice mix between some chocolate malt and some roasted slightly bitter malt. Body is slightly above average with some medium to low carbonation. I thought this was nicely done and fits nicely into style without breaking any barrier."
"porued into my yuengling beer glass barely had any head which quickly disapated. first tastes were what i was expecting hints of a burnt chocolate taste and somewhat nutty flavor. very enjoyable. mostly into stouts, and this was a pretty good alternative as it's lighter on the stomach. definately would drink again"
"Overall, it's an OK schwarzbier. I didn't particularly care for it - a little too sweet and watery."
"One of the better beers I've tried from Sam Adams. I would have hoped for even a little more bitterness in the finish to provide balance. This would have helped round things out and increase overall drinkablility. As it stands it's worth a try..."
"Drinkability: Great, good everyday beer. Great session beer."
"Drank a 12 oz. bottle of this from the Sam Adams' holiday collection. Has a best-by May 2007 date. Poured into a pint glass - it pours a deep black with ruby edges. Thin, white head. Okay retention. Smells of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. Hints of carrots as it warmed. Tastes, too, of dark chocolate and coffee, the roasted malts, a touch of warming alcohol. The alcohol comes out more as the beer warms to room temperature. Mouthfeel is a tad watery, although good for a lager. Overall, a good beer. I liked it better as it warmed."
"Poured deep amber/brown, about like a cola. Nice off-white head that stuck around and left medium lacing. Aroma is very nice, toasty caramel malt. A lot of caramel and chocolate in the taste, malty rather than hoppy. A nice beer, and somehow more ""honest"" than I usually find Mr.Adams' offerings to be."
"D: A bit sweet without enough bitterness to balance things out, but note a bad beer at all, and a nice change of pace."
"Beef Notes: A nice schwarzbier here but I wonder if it fell a little short of its potential."
"This schwartzbier is way too sweet for the style. The noble bittering hops were either missing or in such small quantities that the taste profile suffered. This is a disappointment as SA usually brews some very nice classic beers."
"I thought this would be a porter until bringing it home and reading what a Schwarzbier is supposed to be. With this as my only experience I can see this is a style to search out. The color was a reddish black with a thick head which faded quickly. The smell was a roasted nutty scent however the highlight was the taste. A flavorful and balanced beer with just a little of the bitter after taste I've come to expect from my porters. Very drinkable and one I would seek out for a season other than winter(this is being typed after shoveling the latest 8 inches of snow)."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is light bodied, and seemed just a touch on the thin side to me, but the drinkability was very good with the light body, and relatively low alcohol."
"From a 12 oz bottle. Purchased as part of a ""Brewmasters Collection"" pack. Pours a deep dark choclatey(sp?) color w/about 3/4"" inch head into my globe glass. Smells lightly toasted, tastes faintly sour, not bitter at all. Very easy to drink. Finishes nicely. Very highly reccomended. DEFFINETLY wouldnt mind having this again."
"Very nice indeed. Most beers I tried in this or similar styles often suffer some from a little bit too much sweetness in the aftertaste. Not this one. Very well balanced. Not sure if it's according to style, but very good drinkability."
"Poured a dark brown color, almost black, with a 1 finger tan head that left a good layer of lace on the glass. Aroma was very malty with strong hints of roasted malts and coffee in the nose. Some spicy hops were also noted in the aroma. Taste was very roasty and coffeeish. Lots of flavors of chocolate and coffee with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel was fairly light for a such a tasty beer. Drinkability was good and the relatively low abv makes this highly sessionable. I'm not too familiar with the schwarzbier style, but this one is pretty damn good. Another solid beer from Sam Adams."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is black...go figure, with a minimal off-white head. Smell is sweet, with chocolate and caramel malt, not much of a hop presence. The taste however does have a fair amount bitterness to it, as well as the chocolate and roasted malt taste. There is also a metallic tinge that seems to be fairly prevalent in SA products. The mouthfeel is quite light, has bubbly carbonation and leaves a feeling of dry mouth. This is a drinkable beer, but the metallic taste ruins it for me."
"Very dark brown with a medium-sized, tan, frothy, slowly diminishing head and attractive lacing. Smell is of nutty roasted malts, a large dose of chocolate and some light hops adding balance. Lots of deep chocolate malt flavors without feeling heavy. Caramel, light citrus, spice and some earthy yeast. It has a medium body, moderately dry texture and low carbonation. This is super-easy-drinking while still having the nice big dark beer characteristics. Solid and enjoyable."
"D: It would be easy to drink several of these, but I never seem to be able to do so. Probably more due to the scotch ale in the mixed packs being more of a favorite of mine. A good initial foray into darker beers for the neophyte craft beer drinker and not much beyond that."
"A nice creamy head during the pour that quickly dissapears. A fairly high level of carbonation that takes away from the potential smoothness of the beer. Aroma is very malty and nutty. Similairly nutty flavor to the beer. It finishes well with a nice bitterness. Overall a pretty good example of a black lagar."
"Gave a 1-finger light tan head with lots of big, airy bubbles. Color was a very deep ruby, almost black. The head faded down to a covering within a minute and left some lacing. Smell was of light roast and caramel. The taste of this beer started off with a delicate roastedness with caramel sweetness and finished with a slight noble hop bitterness. It was medium-bodied with a high amount of prickly carbonation, which I thought was a little distracting. This is a nice, clean tasting dark lager that highlights some light roasted flavors and is easy to drink. A good alternative to some big, thick porters and stouts if something lighter is desired that still has some roast in it."
"Beer pours an opaque black with a > average head. Spicy aroma with dark malts evident. Roasted flavor upfront that gives in to the sweet malts. Smooth aftertaste that is a bit watery. Overall effect is a very pleasant mild beer. Very sessionable and would be a good introduction for someone just getting into craft beers."
"OK for those occasional jaunts out side the HOP LIMIT...."
"Drinkability: after years of drinking this beer, I appreciate it more and more. Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Overall, this is a beer that I could drink again, but I probably wouldn't order it if other options are available. For platforming I don't recommend this beer, just because of the unique tastes that drown out the classic beer tastes."
"A pretty good black lager from Sam Adams, and probably one of the best black lagers I have had out of a bottle."
"D - Enjoy several."
"nice earthiness and flavor for an extremely accessible dark beer. Shouldn't take off too many for mouthfeel as this is a dark lager/swarz.... and they're not typically as thick or chewy as stouts... more like a old age porter in mouthfeel... this also has some of that old age porter bitterness which I absolutely love... this is a good beer for something you can get at the grocer for 8.29-8.99 a six... will revisit often...."
"Intriguing black with placid head. Notes of caramel with some subdued smoke, dark chocolate. All of these flavors on a crisp smooth lager canvas lead to more delicate flavors, but flavors and complexity still quite notable. Lacks much hop presence at all, the end notes get a little sweet and could use a little IBU power to subdue them. A good non-offensive Schwarzbier that I wish would be a little more assertive."
"All the flavor compacted into this bottle made it an enjoyable experience, but one that left me with a bit of a headache. If this is right up your alley, then you'll have to go out & buy another mix pack, because there's only two bottles in here. :)"
"Drinkability: I got two of these in a mixed 12 pack. I would gladly buy a 6-pack of this without hesitation. With an ABV less than 5% this one is also easily sessionable. I can not believe it took me so long to try this. One of my favorite Sam Adams beers."
"Drink-Ability: I really enjoyed this brew and I would recommend it to someone looking for something new."
"The Black Lager pours its namesake color with some dark red around the edges with a tan head that laces as the the beer is drunk. There are some roasted qualities to the smell, otherwise there isn't much there for me. The taste has some nice roastiness to it and perhaps a little smoke. Mouthfeel is better than average. The beer is quite drinkable. You wouldn't do yourself wrong to try this one."
"Tingly, smooth feel to it. Not quite as refreshing as Negra Modelo - I'd be less likely to have this one with steak fajitas - but a beautiful brew to have on its own or with German dishes."
"Paid $12.99 for 12 bottle Samuel Adams sampler box at Liquor Barn Hurstbourne"
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a pretty tasty beer, my first schwarzbier. It's a good intro to the style and I look forward to trying more in the future. I'd get this beer again, it seems like a beer that fits a certain mood, this would be a good beer for New Year's Day dinner."
"not amazing but not a disappointment, just like the rest from sam adams"
"While its nice having a beer or twelve on Sunday's while watching the game I've come upon S.A. Black Lager. It has tossed me back in my lazy-boy a few times. Big in flavor, heavy in smell, large in body. These three cryteria are very important on any given Sunday!!!"
"Smells of maltiness and chocolate and evokes images of something old or antique. Has a very thick mouthfeel but without too much cloying that usually accompanies such a thick tasting brew. Taste is very good. Dark chocolates, malts, peat moss, and some ""dull"" hops (for lack of a better term.) Another solid brew from Sam Adams."
"This beer pours a very dark purple/brown,with a nice tan head w/ good retention and moderate lacing.Essences are mild caramel with strong coffee. Tastes are fig/dates with the caramel/coffee overtones. (The coffee scents and flavors increase significantly as the beer comes up in temp.) There is minimal carbonation and a good although slightly thin mouth feel for a beer this dark in color. Good smooth finish with very pleasant after tones. Would certainly drink again."
"Poured a deep black , clear yet almost opaque with darkness. The head was a half inch , tannish , and dissipated to a ring. The aroma is roasty malt , some chocolate , faint coffee, and a bit of bready quality. Mmmm , a refreshing , light-dark beer! By light i mean in body/ overall impression. Pleasant deep roasted character , darker chocolate flavors , some light sweetness in the form of caramel , very lightly spicy hops keep things clean and fresh near the finish , ends with a bit of dry , bittersweet chocolate. This is one of my favorite beers from the BBC. Great to grab when you want something fairly light , but full of roast and flavor. A refreshing black tonic!"
"Nicee first review done."
"D - Quite easy drinking. Not heavy at all, but still full of roasty character."
"D: Another straight forward and solid beer from Sam Adams. This beer won't dazzle you but its really hard to find a negative aspect to this one. Not enough black beers on the market IMO so I'm thankful for this one."
"Got this out of a sample pack of winter sam adams. The last black lager I had was saranac black forest lager and it was horrible so I wasn't expecting much. Turns out it was a very pleasant tasting beer. The maltiness and roasted taste was well balanced and right on the money for my taste. It was almost like a porter but not and chewy and sweet. Very nice."
"Highly drinkable and very sessionable. A great repesentation of the style."
"As for drinkability, I would definately have this again. Perhaps I'll pick up a sixer or three and share at my next household gathering!"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and one of the best I have tried from Sam Adams. I have noticed that he likes to have one particular flavor stand out in the beer, and in this one it is the sweet chocolate. I really wonder if this is the base beer for his Chocolate Bock as the impression is very similar. I would drink this beer again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"This is a real find. Since I'm not real familiar with which Boston Beer Co offerings are permenant and which are one-offs I can only say I hope they keep this one. This was one tasty brew. The color is, as you might expect, a pretty solid black. The head wasn't especially substantial compared to the Boston Lager, but it was still fair sized and on the creamy side. I've always liked the looks of black beers anyway, so I rate the appearance of this one pretty high. Smell is pleasant. Dark roasted carmel malt, a slight hint of coffee, and alcohol. Not very hoppy. Taste was great. Its smooth and rich with a little sweet, and a little bitter, with some coffee in the background again. Hop presence is not strong here either. Mouthfeel was also pleasant. Unlike a stout, this is a medium bodied beer. The drinkability is pretty good for the same reason. Its not very heavy and the bitterness doesn't weigh you down. This is a real winner here. Sort of like the Yuengling ""Porter"" (to which this is actually quite comparable since Yuengling uses a lager yeast for that beer) taken up a notch. This will be a regular so for me so long as the Boston Beer Co is kind enough to keep brewing it."
"It's drinkable, but not out of this world."
"Woudl definitely have one again. This is on my favorites list. Very easy to drink and very memorable."
"A slightly unbalanced Schwarzbier in terms of flavor: sweetness, spiciness, and robust malt richess; but a nice effort at a more unusual style."
"This beer poured a black color with a reddish hue. The head was thick and retention was good Â– as was the lacing. The smell is a bit sour. The taste is malty with a hint of roasted coffee type flavor. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, but not heavy. This beer is smooth and quite drinkable."
"It comes in a 6 pack, but I bought it in a mixed pack."
"Very high drinkability for such a tasty beer, not a great beer but a good option if you want to drink a lot of beer and still want some taste."
"Pours dark brown with a reddish hint with a good head with great retention. Smell is a bit sweet. Taste is again pretty sweet and above average bitterness, I'd say the taste is a cross between 2/3 Sam Adams Boston Lager and 1/3 Cream Stout. Very drinkable. Aftertaste is bittersweet, could have been a bit more hoppy but otherwise a great beer."
"This is right about what I'd shoot for, mouthfeel-wise in this style. A full mouth, enough (but not too much body, and an excellent carbonation rate. This is one easy drinking brew, and probably one of my favorite Sam Adams creations."
"Drinkability--Quite nice. All around a very drinable beer."
"d - easily drinkable but i wasn't dying for another after i finished this one."
"Dark maple syrup color and an airy tan head that just layers the top. Big malt nose with notes of coffee, mild fruits, and roasted malt. Really nice taste with big roasted malt characters, burnt toffee sweetness, smokey notes and a good amount of hops offer up some floral notes and a little bitter bite for texture. The finish starts out hoppy but quickly evolves to smokey and some soft fruit notes. Full body and a terrific mouthfeel with carbonated froth surrounding the mouth."
"Poured dark as night with small tan head that laced the glass. Smelled of coffee with some creamy scents. Tasted of coffee with a malty flavor, espresso like aftertaste. Not much carbonation, some creamy mouthfeel. Goes down fairly smooth, enjoyable beer. Sam Adams makes some good products."
"D: If you find a six-pack of this, I wouldnÂ’t hesitate. West coasters typically need to look harder for this one, but itÂ’s worth it."
"Color is comparable to a very dark molassas. You can smell a strong malt along with a roasty caramel. Carbonation is moderate and very bubbly, head is a tan white and starts out strong and slowely disspates to small, leaving a excellent lacing down the sides of the glass. Taste goes along with the semll, strong malt with a very roasty caramel flavor. Goes down real smooth, leaving no bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This beer is very drinkable and one that i will enjoy for a long time. I will make this one of the beers i have in my refer to enjoy after a long day."
"This beer is dark brown with a nice tan head to it. Fairly thin in appearance when held up to the light. Smell is sweet with hints of caramel and mollasses. Taste is very smooth, almost creamy. Well balanced and refreshing. A great change of pace beer for a hop head like me. Overall extremely drinkable. A great session beer. If your looking to turn someone over to the dark side, then this is your beer."
"D: Easy to drink. I love KÃ¶stritzer, but this isnt quite as good."
"Dark, black color with very minimal tan head. Malty aroma. Taste is a burnt caramel, very malty with a fair amount of sweetness and almost no hop flavor. Very easy drinking beer, with just the right amount of carbonation. My first venture into this style, this is a beer I could drink all night."
"Black in color with some ruby red highlights that emerge only if held to a bright light. A bubbly tan head that clings very nicely. Burnt malts, cinammon-sugar and roasted dark coffee beans, n-ice. The body reveals some coffee beans, dark chocolate and becomes acidic and sweet within the same breath. Enjoyable. The body turns a bit dry, but not over the top; barley notes and roasted malts are further revealed. Traces of sweet caramel round out the finish. Drinkability is high, as the flavorings meld well with the creamy like body. A sessionable-Schwarz? Do it!"
"The black lager pours a dark, umber brown, topped with a creamy whitish head. Good head retention and lacing, good clarity. No complaints. Looks solid so far. The nose is rich with caramel malt, softly roasty, with that signature bit of Sam Adams ""bite"". It's hard to place. I'm not sure if it's a slightly agressive hopping, or some extra graininess to the malt. Whatever it is, it comes through as some harshness in the flavor, as compared to european style couterparts. The black lager is one of the smoothest of the Sam Adams offerings, probably a great beer to get started on dark beer. Anyways, the flavor comes off a bit different than the aroma. Much smoother, most notably. Very european, with a silky smooth texture and fine, tingly carbonation. Mellowed caramel sweetness is tempered by some roasty, toffee-ish notes. Very clean. I can't pick up any off flavors. Perhaps a bit of plum esters, which only works with the beer. Mild noble hops in the finish, riding out clean and dry. Solid roastiness in the end, kinda coffee-ish. Present, but not dominating. Maybe a little fuller flavored than the average german schwarzbiers, but nothing stands out enough to make this particularly unique. They nailed the style, for sure, and it's very drinkable. I'll have to pick up a sixer of this next time I'm heading to a party."
"This beer pours very dark brown almost black that shows deep red when held up to a light, with a thin light tan head. The head doesn't last long but leaves some bubbles and lacing. The smell is of chocolate and roasted malts with a touch of spice from the hops and maybe a little bit of sweetness. The chocolate and roasted malt comes through in the taste a bit of spice is evident too. The body is light, smooth and a little bubbly. For some reason this doesn't seem to have great drinkability for me maybe the malt flavor is a bit sharp and unbalanced for my taste a good beer all the same."
"I also got mine from the Mix Pack but tasted earlier this year. Poured a neat brown the shade of maple syrup with a tinge of garnet coming through with the light. Not much head with a few spots of lace. Aroma-roasted malt. The dark or roasted malt gives it just a little extra body without deviating from the lager style. Nice crisp clean lager taste. The mild hops mix well with the dark malt for a nice earthy and balanced taste. Tannins are present and it finishes clean."
"Picked this one out of their Holiday mix pack. Pretty good collection here, but I haven't tried the cranberry lambic yet. Thought I'd had this before but I guess that's what BA is here, to tell me I haven't. Very smooth, creamy like schwarzbier, great example of the style. A bit malty but not too heavy at all. This is a great example of turning someone on to a darker beer."
"i recommend this as something different to try for stout drinkers. a great lager for the winter time also!"
"Flavor is primiarly full roasted malts with edges of caramel. Floral hop accent. Flavor is excellent, but could be more robust. Very drinkable."
"Served in a pint glass, the Black Lager pours dark brown with a long lasting off-white head. There's a decent bit of lacing with this beer too. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and a bit of nuttiness. It tastes like roasted malt, bread, caramel, and semi-sweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is light and a bit watery. The drinkability is pretty good, it goes down easy. Not a great beer, but a pretty good one. Not a bad choice as a session beer either."
"This is a very good Lager, I had one yesterday that I enjoyed very well and had this one today. I'll probably have one tommorrow. This is something to drink and enjoy."
"Probably wouldn't get this one again and it's not my favorite style. Had to drink it since it's on my beer tour."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of Mar.2007, into a pint glass. The appearance is dark brown, almost black, with a 3/4 inch head, with slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is a bit weak, with hints of chocolate in the nose. The mouthfeel is about medium, not thin like most lagers, but not as thick as a porter or stout. The taste is very similar to a porter, just a little weaker, with notes of chocolate dominating the flavor, but still extremely enjoyable. This is a beer that I will continue to come back to. Good job Sam Adams!"
"The best Sam Adams I've ever had. I have just recently reopened myself to Sam Adam after a few years and I have to say this beer gives me hope for bigger and better things."
"Pouring vigorously into a clean weizen glass produced a thick tan head that slowly faded to a thin coating atop the wetline of the glass. A nice crisp lacey residue left on the glass. Color ranged from amber, to chocolate, and finished an opaque ebony with the glass filled. The nose was malty with a hint of hoppiness at the end. Mouthfeel was a little thin almost watery. Flavour was malty with crisp hoppy highlights and no perceived bitterness. A well balanced beer. I will definitely drink this again."
"The beer pours a nice clear dark amber with a bit of efervesence, and a tan head. The aroma is of sharp toasted malt with some hints of dark fruit. The beer tastes of toasted malt then rounds out to a very sweet coffee taste. The feel is medium and a bit oily. This was a pleasant beer almost a light stout feel to it. Definately one I'll sample again."
"nice very dark almost black color with a two or three finger creamy tan head with fair retention and lacing. smell is bready, caramel, slighty fruity. caramel and toasted malt, a very small hop taste at the end and slightly sweet. light mouthfeel but not watery, very smooth going down. very nice beer to drink."
"I really enjoyed this one and I'm glad they sell it on its own instead of making you buy a holiday case to get two bottles of the stuff. I've bought 6-packs of this before and I will continue to."
"Samuel Adams Black Lager was a dark brown color with good clarity. It had a thick light tan head with good retention and left a sheet of lace behind. The aroma was sweet and toasty dark malt. The taste was sweet dark malts with a little chocolate and roasted grain. It finished dry and a little bitter. It was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a very good dark lager."
"Simple American Schwarzbier. Almost feels like a watered down Porter, emphasis on the water. The flavors are not bold or daring, and could be better melded. To my tongue the bitterness was completely absent; this contributed to lack of balance and direction. Black Lager is not wonderful, but definitely not bad."
"Black Lager sounded much more powerful than it was. I never knew it was a schwarzbier, nor what a schwarzbier was. Now I understand the subtleness. Maybe this is just not the style for me. Too mild, but not bad!"
"Another beer from the Sam Adams mix six pack, Black Lager pours a deep ruby red black with a light brown head. I smell sweet caramel malts as well as a slight roasted aroma. Taste is deep caramel and raisin, with a slightly astringent bitterness from the roasted malt. No hops to be found, but that fits just fine. I'm kind of confused with the name black lager, not too discriptive, but I guess many other beers are just Ale or Lager so not too big a deal."
"Overall, well it tastes like black. I suppose that's good. Flavors are a bit odd for me though. Tastes like motor oil."
"Overall a good shwarzbier. Lots of grainy notes along with a bit of balancing hops. Good fall/winter beer. Recommended."
"Overall- A damn tasty offering from Sam Adams. Very refreshing very tasty I would definitely recommend this brew to anyone."
"At last this arrives in Salem,Oregon. Nice dark brown beer with a large, tight,creamy tan head, very attractive. Light roasted malt aromas, some hints of semi-dark chocolate.. as the label says there is a quite luxuriant malty taste to begin with and this coats the front of the tongue, then some hops make an appearance and the beer finishes semi-dry. Some hints of coffee, and English toffee in the malts, quite nice. Nice mouthfeel it starts off quite smooth and thickish but thns out near the end for an almost crisp finish, not quite though. Overall a pretty good beer and worth drinking. I enjoyed this."
"Pours black with tinges of garnet at the edges. Nice, somewhat frothy 2 finger light tan head that settles to about 1/8"" with good lacing. Smell is of caramel and sweet and roasted malts. It is fairly subtle and less aromatic than any other Sam Adam's I've had before. Taste is roasted malts with some bitterness followed by some nice caramel sweetness. I also tasted subtle hints of chocolate and coffee flavors. Nice mouthfeel, fairly light in body which is generally representative of the style. Great drinkability. Low ABV, light body and the balance and relative depth of flavors make this an easily drinkable brew."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. It's good to have sometimes, but it always leaves me craving a Guinness. I don't know if it's the dark color or the sweet taste, but after drinking one of these, I just want a Guinness."
"Drinkability-- the strong taste belies a minimally 4.9%ABV. Aside from a slight full-feeling from the carbonation, this is a very drinkable beer, in single or in-session."
"If they had this as a seasonal choice at a bar, I'd pick it over BMC but it's ""eh"" otherwise. Average."
"Overall, a good beer that is a little more drinkable than the orginal Sam Adams Boston lager."
"This is a damn fine lager, and has moved to near the top of my choices for the genre. I would drink this again, recommend it highly, and could session it as well. A very pleasing dance between interesting deeper tastes associated with other, heavier genres, yet still light & refreshing. Looks like my friends were right on about this one!"
"With an emphasis on caramel and sweeter than the German examples I have tried BBC's Black Lager still deserves a try due to its apperance qualities. IMHO a lighter caramel emphasis would improve this beer but then a lack of decocted melanoidins may then become an issue. A satisfing dextrinous mouth feel is correct for the style and dark roasted and chocolate malts are well balanced by hops that dry the sweet flavors. I will have a hard time passing by a sixer the next trip to a liquor store."
"I've definitely had better of this style, but this brew is hardly a slacker in the Schwarzbier department. It holds it's own as a solid session beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer as it goes down fairly easy but seems to be very flavorful as well. I have only tried one of other beer of the style, but this is by far the best of the two."
"Overall, the flavors were competent but unremarkable. It's well-crafted, but this is a ""what you see is what you get"" affair and I'm not sure that I knew anything about this beer after two pints that I didn't know after two sips."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a pitch black with a fluffy foamy head that leaves sick lace. Smell is pretty sweet with hints of bitter. Taste is smooth and refreshing very malt and roasted like some warm nuts on a fire, a good offering from Sam Adams. It was included in the winter sam pack."
"I felt like I was drinking a malt flavored soda but I liked it. I would drink it again but I can't imagine a situation in which this would be available and there wouldn't also be choices I prefer over this."
"Smell is of sweet, dark malts, chocolate, a little bit of coffee. Taste is really good consisting of tons of roastiness that follows through with the aftertaste. Cofffee flavors, chocolate, tons of chocolate malts, some caramel toffee flavors...good stuff. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Extremely drinkable. Great for sessioning. This is a unique beer from Samuel Adams and can say that I am thoroughly impressed and is one of my favorites from them."
"Beer poured an opaque black with a nice tan head that is leaving a lacing. Nose is of roasted malts. Taste is a nice combo of roasted chocolate malts with a very light hopping. Flavor is deceivingly sweet. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth which lends to an enjoyable finish. Overall drinkability is good. At 4.9 abv, this is a sessionable beer for those that enjoy this style."
"I really like this one. Not complex, but hands down one of the easiest drinking dark beers I've had in a while. I do wish I could get this in bulk."
" A session dark lager,very tastey and quite pleasing,easy drinking.A very good beer.Worth a try!"
"A good beer, but a little two sweet to be a daily addition to the fridge."
"Pours a deep clear very dark brown with a two-finger head that dissipates moderately. Visible carbonation leaving delicate lacing. Nice malty aroma. Taste is well balanced and very tasty and clean. Surprisingly light and very drinkable. One of the better offerings from Samuel Adams."
"Samuel Adams Black Lager pours, appropriately enough, a black color with ruby around the edges with a thin off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is caramel malt and sugar. The taste has nice roasted malt flavors and is on the sweet side. I like it, it's a pretty good interpretation of a schwarzbier."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. About a finger and a half of head, but not much lace at all. It smelled like an Irish Stout. Very very smooth. No bad after taste. I have enjoyed this Sam Adams the most out of all the Sams I have had. Don't drink and review."
"This beer is extremely drinkable. A great session beer that I will pick up again. Very nice."
"After the Double Bock and Cream Stout, this is my favorite brew by Sam Adams. Pours out a really nice dark color and smells good. Its got a nice body to it and goes down beautifully. I tasted some nice chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt taste. Finishes off with a nice bitter taste. Good stuff."
"Satisfying dark malt taste with roasted coffee leading the aftertaste. Could stand some thickening in the body but doen't suffer as much from skinny mouthfeel as a lesser brew would because the flavor still stands up well and there's plenty of it. A little overboard on the carbonation but still drinkable and surprisingly smooth. I would definitely seek this out again."
"D: This is good stuff, and I can think of quite a few porters that aren't this good. I'll be getting this again. Smooth, well-balanced, tasty."
"This is actually the second time I've had this beer and it was much better this time than I remembered. A great brew I think, I will drink it again."
"Drinkability: A nice, flavorful beer."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown head and is vivid black color with ruby red highlights, quite impressive for a lager. Smell is of roasted malts and a little hint of chocolate. Taste is very smooth and crisp, with lots of malt and caramel notes. Mouthfeel is just what a lager should be smooth and clean and thats just what it was. Hopefully I will look around and try to check some of the same style out."
"Slainte!"
"No alcohol is present here and this might be a session beer, depends on who is drinking this."
"Overall: Not much to say here..."
"Pours a very dark brown that flirts with the idea of black, but not quite. A thin head with minimal lacing appears. Smells of roasted coffee and a bit of chocolate as well as a bit of hops. The taste is quite sweet with more milky chocolate, some caramel, coffee, and a hint of licorice. Good, but a tad sweet. A mild mouthfeel with light carbonation. Drinkability is limited by the sweetness and it could be a bit more dry."
"Pours deep black ruby in color with a creamy light tan head. Aroma is a bit subdued but there are scents of roasted malts and chocolaty caramel detectable. The same roasty chocolaty caramel in the aroma comes across in the taste along with a bit of coffee and dark fruit. Hop bitterness seems at a minimal level."
"Very happy that I found these Sammy mix packs...it has allowed me to try many different beer styes, as I am somewhat new to beer exploration (have drank beer all my life, but never really worried about styles and such, just gimme a beer, plz)"
"D - Very easy to drink, even for a darker beer. Straight 4s across the board. A very solidly good beer. Don't hesitate to pick up a 6-pack."
"Very drinkable beer and a very nice offering from a large brewery. Easy to have a few of this easy drinkin' good tastin' beer."
"Pours out a dark dark brown almost to the point of being black. Some dark ruby hues. You can just barely make out your fingers on the other side of the glass. Thick almond head that settles down to .5"" and leaves thick lacing patterns. Smokey, roasted malts stick out in the nose along with some chocolate, dried fruit and clean lager aromas. Smoky, roasty, lightly chocolatey, slightly acidic, and clean in the finish with some hop bitterness and mild astringency. Has an interesting malted milk ball flavor thing going on. Mouthfeel is fairly light with some prickling carbonation. Tasty and drinkable."
"D: All in all, a pleasant surprise. Dark color, smelled fairly serious and heavy. However, the fruit flavors and light mouthfeel really provided a pleasant surprise. I could session this one, for sure."
"Another good one from Sam Adam's. This is another style that I am not very familiar with, so I don't really know how this stands up to other schwartzbiers. It was kind of stout-like, but cleaner and with a milder flavor, kind of like I would expect from a lager. It wasn't the best beer in the world, but it was tasty and I would drink it again. Recommended."
"Pours an almost pitch black/dark brown color with a creamy light tan head. Aroma is sweet chocolate, caramel and a little bit of malt. Taste is roasted malt, chocolate, caramel and a bit of hops. Wow, this is definately better than expected. Overall, this is a great Schwarzbier that is recommended. I am quite impressed with this offering from Boston Beer Company."
"On the palate this beer is light bodied, well light for a dark beer...I guess that meets the style guidelines. Carbonation is in check. Would be nice if the beer were a little bit creamier as the appearance of the head suggests. This beer is easy to drink and is very refreshing; especially after a long day of brewing, not to mention my first all grain batch. This beer comes as a well earned relief. I'd definitely buy this beer again, but probably not before I've had other Schwarzbiers."
"Sam Adams once again outdoes its' self. Another soon-to-be classic."
"CONDITIONS: MOWING/WORKING ON CAR- n WITH FRIENDS- y SIPPING- n GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"Food craving- Fat slab of pork and kartoffel salat."
"This is an excellent sessioner and a good food beer for the fall, but it isn't very deep. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, but that is probably par for the style and doesn't hurt with food paring IMO. I would pick this up again ...I'm thinking cookouts, bonfires, and tailgating!"
"Samuel Adams Black Lager is a very heavy, filling beer. I would not have another right after, but I will definately enjoy another in the future."
" This is, of course, nearly black, with a hint of deep red. Nice tan head which persists and coats a mug. Smells very good-- roasted malt and coffee. very little hops but just a hint of spice. The taste is well balanced but less roasted malt and sweeter than the smell suggests; it's noticeably less bitter than Black Forest. It's medium/light in body, smooth texture medium/low carbonation. Very pleasant and drinkable."
"Healthy two-to-three finger light tan head with black but very slightly opaque body. Smells VERY malty, with some caramel notes. Sweet and malty, roasty. Lighter flavored and bodied than i anticipated, though it is by no means light in either. Tasty. I've never had a Schwartzbier, but if this is what they're like I'm trying more! Reminds me in some ways of Ayinger Cellebrator Dopplebock..."
"My first black lager. I look forward to having more examples from this style. I would buy this beer again."
"A one."
"Schwarzbier is my wife's favorite style--high malt, sweet, low hop. And, Sam Adams Black Lager is a very good representative of the style and I think a good choice for a transition beer for those moving into the micro world. Beer pours a dark brown to black, but has enough copper tones around the edge as to not be too scary. Head is thick and rocky, and the colored of the inside of a malted milk ball. Which is appropriate with the strong chocolate taste and a not so subtle hint of coffee underneath. No hop aroma, and the nose is very light but some fruity undertones. Very smooth and easy to drink, except for a bit of a carbonation bite. I like the beer a lot; however, the mouthfeel is a bit light and doesn't fill up my mouth with the taste and the end of the beer is watery with no final punch. Pick it up like I did, in a variety pack if you have the room on the beer run."
"This opaque and flat black beer has a minimal eggshell-colored head that fades fast. Smell is very strong, very tasty, and actually has a mouthwatering, rich coffee character to it. Start is somewhat sweet but very oaky and heady. The beginning of this drink reminded me of a porter. Settles full-bodied and bitter with some malt smoothness. Flavors are coffee and caramel. Finish is bitter and dry with a rough aftertaste that vanishes quickly."
"A nice drinking lager with a roasted taste. No problem drinking a few."
"Smell this beer, and you know what you're getting: roasted, malty flavor that's occasionally chocolatey or even nutty. That said, this is no stout. The flavors are subtler, and the beer is lighter and altogether more drinkable. Tasted just as at home with a chicken sandwich as it did with a piece of fine dark chocolate."
"Quite a quaffable brew."
"Drinkability: I find this beer quite sessionable, and easily consumable. I'm almost through my first six pack, and will be buying more. I can't wait to go back and visit Boston this winter (hopefully finding this on tap at Doyles...)"
"Overall, a worthy offering from Jim Koch and friends. It takes the lager to new worlds as should be the case when 85% of the world drinks tasteless fizzy yellow bile."
"The clean finish makes this very drinkable. I believe this is my first schwarzbier, and I look forward to a few more."
"IÂ’d drink this as a summer beer, but I can see it making a really good autumn-winter drink. Solid work."
"Drinkability: I wish this beer was a 6 pack of black lager, not the 6 pack of variety beer, because this one you could drink all night."
"This lager reminds me of a local brewery, Oak Pond Brewery in Skowhegan, ME., that makes Laughing Loon Lager which has many of the same characteristics as the Sam Adams Black Lager. MMM deeee-licious!"
"Drinkability: Pleasant and drinkable"
"Rather quickly disappating head. When held to light it reveals a deep red coloration not apparent in a dimmer environment. I smelled notes of salt water taffy but this was very subtle and the smell is rather weak overall. Malts give a roasted character to this while allowing hops to balace very well. It has a light bodied refreshing feel to it and has a slightly lingering malt aftertaste as well."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but I think if I want a seriously dark beer, I'll go for an ale and get a broader array of flavors. Thickness detracts a bit from drinkability."
"It pours black with ruby highlights. The look and smell of this stuff does a pretty spot on impersonation of a porter or stout, although the roasted malts are far less intense in the taste than those in dark ales. Brown sugar, yeast, chocolate, and Central American coffee, roughly in that order, round out the taste. I appreciate how much BBC is pushing a fairly adventurous style, all things considered, like this one."
"A fair amount of chocolate comes through in the smell and leads into the taste. Coffee flavor is present but minimal, giving way to more malt and caramel. The mouthfeel is medium, while drinkability is very good."
"I really enjoyed the look and eroma, very subtle nutlike smell. Bottom line: Smooth, good tasting beer. Could be a little stronger with taste and alcolhol, but still really good. Seriously, I'm just getting nit picky, this is a good beer. Well worth a try."
"A coarse mouthfeel spils an otherwise excellent beer, with a rich bodied roasted coffee flavor that is slightly sweetened, reminiscent of a classic porter. This goes down easy (maybe too easy), though at 4.9%, and with only 2 in the holiday pack, I'm in no danger of OD'ing on this Black Lager."
"This is an enjoyable brew and another quality beer from Sam Adams."
"O my good daddy who built me with my knockers on the low! I love this sap! It is the perfect accoutrement for the low-class denizen desserter of Keebler cookies and Chips Ahoy! I'm not a fan of coffee but this reminds me of coffee with a dark chocolate brain. It thinks burnt but says savor. I could easily become a drunk rotting my teeth out further on this brimmed black wizened wine of puddings! All stars here along with his step uncle SCHWARZ!"
"Poured this one into a pint glass from 12 oz. bottle. Dark brown/black color, off white head. Aroma of roasted malts. Taste is roasted malt with some malty sweetness. Seems light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. I could easily drink another. This is a good beer, but if I'm looking for a Schwarzbier I think I would opt for Rahr's Ugly Pug if I have the choice."
"Pours to a dark chocolate color. Nice clingy beige head. Roasted chocolate malt starting like a stout with a robust lager finish. Good carbonation and a slight lager characterictic bitter flavor, with a smooth non-bitter finish. A good hearty beer to enjoy with a hamburger or a nice thick steak. Yet another tasty selection from Samuel Adams who never dissappoints!"
"Drinkability Â– This was a tad off-style but is an excellent drinker and incredibly smooth. ItÂ’s an obscure style but Sam Adams gave us a nice rendition here."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer. I personally prefer a bit more hop presence in the flavor, but a decent offering. If I were more familiar with the schwarzbier style, I might rate this higher or lower."
"Appears a near black color with a nice tan head. Aroma is malty and roasty. The taste is a smooth balance of sweetness and roasted malts and a touch of coffee with just a nice hint of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is good and this beer is very drinkable, especially at only 4.90% ABV."
"One of Sam's best brews, and definitely one I can recommend."
"12 oz. bottle from Sam Adams Mixed 12 pack. Appearance was a dark mahogany color with red highlights. The beer was clear, but almost opaque. Moderately tan head. The aroma was malt, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Taste was similar, with a balance of hop bitterness which was present mainly in the finish. The mouthfeel was medium in body, moderately carbonated, and somewhat drying. A very drinkable beer."
"I would buy this again, I usually like a little more hops in my beer, but it's nice for the style and a good malt fix."
"Drinkability: A moderate to low abv and great taste? What's there not to like. I am thoroughly impressed by this."
"Black with a crown-amber hue that peeks through in the light. Yields a thin but very creamy almond colored head. Smells sweet and thick, with a distinctly german lager aroma. Tastes sweet and roasty but no harshness to speak of, mostly just dark sweetness. Very non-threatening, sweet and rich with an extremely slight alcohol aroma in the finish. Caramel malts are dominant but the darker malts add great complexity here. Very appealing. I'm new to this style. It's darker than a brown ale, and definately not as intense in the dark malts as a porter, and distinctly a lager for another twist. Mouthfeel is thich and full, but slightly more carbonated that desirable. Excellent drinkability and all around, this is Sam Adams? Impressive. I actually think I'd reccomend this beer more often than I'd drink it most likely. I doubt I'd buy a sixer of it too often, but I can see friends enjoying it and picking up a single for myself from time to time. with my only concern being that most people might at first be unaacustomed to the german hops and lager yeast characteristics when expecting a dark stout like beer by appearance. Overall, a great offering."
"A very good evening session beer when you want that malty lager that will go down fast."
"Chocolate and heavy malt was evident in the aroma immediately. Appearance was similar to a stout, dark in color with a foamy tan head. I didnÂ’t note much of a spiciness in this, but the malt and chocolate/carmel were very evident and consistent throughout the glass. Tasty beer with a good finish."
"Easy enough to drink with a mellow ABV, worth a try but wasn't impressed."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty drinkable brew. Not something you can get drunk of because of the flavors, but this is definetely enjoyable amongst friends."
"I've never liked S.A.'s Boston Lager, but figured I'd give them another chance by giving this a try. Good thing I did, because I really enjoy this beer! Definitely not an everyday beer, since it's quite rich and a tad heavy, but it hardly has to be one of those ""special occasion-only"" beers. Give this a try if you haven't already."
"black color with a nice creamy head that stays around a while. the smell is of roasted caramel? (hell, I'm no expert on smells, I just know it smells good!) Mouth-feel is good; not too fizzy, and goes down real good with just a little lingering after-taste that some may find objectional. I my-self really enjoyed this brew and look forward to getting some more."
"Smooth, creamy and easy to drink. Slightly spicy finish with a bit of coffee aftertaste. Possibly a bit lighter in body and taste than some versions but this just seems to make it easier to drink. A good introduction to the style, I suppose."
"Eric"
"drinkability: I'm unimpressed. This is something interesting to try occasionally, probably best when paired with strong meats or cheese. By itself it is not particularly refreshing or alluring."
""
"D: Well, it's very tasty and very light, so I can see myself having an entire six of these no problem. Everything about the beer is pleasant; it could just be more so. But, even without more taste or more body, it's extremely drinkable."
"D: Drinkable, but eh. A good change of pace, but not sure i'd go after this one again. Nothing special here."
"Overall a successful treat from Sam Adams, not one of their best but certainly worth picking up for its better attributes. Just a few steps over from a porter or stout, but less heavy in terms of body and ABV."
"I liked the appearance of this beer, deep brown almost black in color, with some burgundy around the sides, and a deep caramel colored head. I found the smell and taste quite similar, coffee and dark roasted malts with a bit of a nutty flavor. This is a smooth and semi-sweet beer, the finish has a nice slightly hoppy flavor as well. There is nothing inherently bad about the drinkability of this beer, but I think I would get bored with it after a few."
"Refreshing, though overly sweet and thin in flavor compared to aroma."
"Drinkability - Fantastic, a great session beer!"
"Pours a very deep chestnut color, almost black. A few ruby edges around the sides of the glass. A rich off-white frothy head forms, and remains intact throughout the life of the beer. Aroma of caramel, and chocolate. Nice flavor of sweet charred caramel, followed up by hints of chocolate. Hints of toasty flavors. Finishes with enough noble hops to balance things out. I have had some of this style that finish so sweet and cloying, however this one does not. A very nice effort, highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"This is a beer I've only had a few times before. Overall, it isn't a bad beer. It's not something I'd drink often, but it's still heads and shoulders above the usual macro stuff."
"This beer is decently complex and easy to drink. A well crafted session beer."
"This poured a very dark brown with a light head that didn't last very long. Virtually no lacing. The smell is kinda nice, mostly caramel and malt. The taste is not nearly as good as saranac Black Forest but it is good. Caramelly and malty as fuck. There are soem coffee hints also. Flavor is nice but doesn't really grab you. Kinda leaves a yucky porter like aftertaste. The mouthfeel isn't bad but kinda watery. It is pretty slick to the tounge. Kinda drinkable but it leaves such a blah taste in your mouth. Try a black forest instead."
"Overall a nice easy drinking beer."
"Good option for those establishments where the best they serve is Sam Adams and you want something a little different."
"light for such a dark, malty beer (it is a lager...). I could have a few without complaint."
"Into a pint glass, pours a brownish black, with pretty good long lasting off-white head, and thin lacing. Aroma isn't that strong, chocolate and roasted malt, some caramel in there, pretty pleasant, just a little weak. Taste is really nice, one of my more favorite lagers i've had. A nice chocolate malt and molasses is matched with a almost thickish, creamy smooth body, and a slightly ever-so-present floral hop that balances it out perfectly. Very nice to have before, after, or with a steak, btw."
"Not a bad example of this style, though I've had several better. It's certainly not one to turn down, and worth buying if better ones are not available (which is often the case with this style, unfortunately.)"
"Overall drinkable and pleasant enough but there's not much personality here. It's almost as if Sam Adams brewed a 9% beer and then cut it in half with water. It's quite light and refreshing for a malty brew but probably not a great 'lawnmower' beer."
"A smooth-drinking, solid black lager. The only downfall is a lack of depth. There isn't much else to say. Another solid beer from Sam Adams."
"Overall: A good dark lager, definitely worth a try."
"Not much of a lager fan but this one was recommended to me by a friend. I enjoy roasted flavors so this one hits the spot. It gets an A in my book."
"For someone with a little experience as I have, I find myself very surprised that I prefer a strong Guinness over this black lager. I certainly wouldn't choose this beer again."
"This beer is one of the more consistent ones I have tried. Appearance, smell, taste and mouthfeel all flow smoothly across the board. There are no strange aftertastes."
"damn testy and sessionable, a really good one from a macro company, worth checking out."
"A very drinkable beer - and surprisingly light. An excellent Schwarzbier."
"Taste and Mouthfeel- A light/medium to medium body with a nice amount of carbonation. Malt dominates the flavor with chocolate being the top dog while caramel malt plays a back-up role. A slight nuttiness comes in play at the end of the sip. Very very subtle hints of fruityness. Quite drinkable as the flavors are delicious and many."
"Drinkability it right there folks. Open up and pour it down. You could drink this all day. Enjoy MK"
"I love this stuff. Very dark dark brown when poured this stuff is nice. The smell of coffee and chocolate fill my nose. As it goes down the same flavors are there with maltiness making this beer great. Very easy to drink and pleasing. I got to give it to the Boston Beer Co. on this one."
"D- I liked the SA Black Lager quite a bit more than the Brown Ale I had in the same session. They were pretty similar, but I thought the Black Lager had more to offer."
"Yeah I could drink this stuff even often but I usualy wait for my buddy to buy it in a mixed sam adams pack."
"Very drinkable scharzbier. A nice alternative to a brown ale or imperial stout."
"Brew is very smooth making is have decent drinkability but can't say much else."
"I am about to say screw dark brews until I get my hands on some more Guinness, or until I try Murphy's of Beamish."
"Appearance was cola-like dark brown with a large bubbled head that faded to a thin, fizzy film and eventually disappeared. Typical lager head really. Smell is sweet dark malts, quite inviting. Taste is mildly sweet, mainly caramel with a little dark bread and very little hops. The dark brown color had me expecting a cocoa flavor but alas, caramel is all I got. Pretty easy to drink overall but not enough flavor or spice to keep me interested."
"Overall, i just think this could be a much better beer. It's good, but there are better out there. This one just seems so close to being a great beer, just wish it was a bit more mellow."
"Drinkability: Good stuff! I could drink many of these."
"Me: It did the opposite of grow on me. At the end of the glass I realize why I liked it so much more at first sip than I remembered."
"After having mixed reviews of different Sam Adam's beers, I was happy after trying this one. It poured out to a nice brown color with an average amount of head. The smell was that of roasted nuts and barley and the taste is the same. My favorite part of this beer was the taste when compared to the texture and mouthfeel. I enjoy stouts and other dark beers, but having a good dark lager is like a less-filling stout. I could definitely drink this beer all night and still enjoy it."
"Drinkability- i didnt enjoy drinking it alone, I would prefer to pair it with food"
"Pours black with a tan head, a great site to see! Roasted smell with hints of chocolate and other sweet characters. A very inviting smell. I love the balance of this beer, not over powering just the right hints of sweet and bitter. This beer is thin like the lager name suggests but packs a flavorful punch, and because of such a great mouthfeel it drives the ease of consumption. If you are a person who likes the flavor of stouts or porters but dislikes the heavy feel to the beer then this lager is right for you. I recommend this beer to anyone because it has something for everyone, one of my two absolute favorite sam adams beers. Cheers!"
" Though its easy to drink, this seems more of a have one and move on beer, not because its bad, it very good, just because i think that youd be wasting a wonderful sensation for your brain and taste buds if you try and session this beer. Much to complex for that."
"D- sure, id probably drink it again if it was on tap or in the single's rack of my favorite liquor store."
"Black Lager...a name much more mysterious than the taste itself. A pint glass reveals a nice deep, very dark chestnut (no it's not actually that black) hue with a rapidly dissipating burnt ivory head. In fact you have to pour somewhat aggressively to achieve a decent head to begin with. Roasted toffee greets the nose as you notice a chocolaty malt flavor, followed by an almost Dry Irish Stout-like bitter finish. The medium body however lends itself to more social drinking, but I'm not so sure I could drink to many in one sitting. I'll try. Have this American Schwarzbier with any meat & potato combo, or a roasted poultry & veggie dish. Enjoy"
"Easy to drink but IÂ’m uninterested. Sure, I could drink it again but it is nothing IÂ’m picking out of an impressive line-up. Give me MÃ¶nchshof any day. I purchased a six-pack in Sioux Falls, SD but I have seen it in Nebraska since. It is decent. I am happy Sam Adams has beers like this on the market. Props to SA!"
"Black, peat-like, with a dense creamy, light andy head. Roasted malts, coffee bitterness on the nose with some sugary malt sweetness. Tobacco leaves too. Nice, sweetish malt melds with singed, roasted character on the palate. Leathery-tobacco notes. Roasted coffee bitter finish. Medium-bodied to light with moderate carbonation. A great offering from SA and I can only hope to find this on tap as frequently as I find the Boston lager..."
"drinkability: this is a disapointment. i'm still waiting to find the perfect shwarz, but am still looking. this is not it. still, this is decent, but i certainly wouldn't seek it out."
"Drinkability: Like the Lager but not the Black Lager. All show and no go."
"One of Sam Adams better offerings. Medum body with a powerful, yet smooth, with a powdery roasted flavor and texture. Black at first sight, but then allows amber highlights to perminate. Promising, lightly tanned head retention starts off thick and creamy, but fades quickly under the lighter than expected body. Moderatly malty sweet with roasted grain (not quite coffee) bitter balance. A light cocoa flavor adds character and complexity. Low hopping allows for grain to supply bitterness. Finishes nicely clean and lightly charcoal-like. Quite enjoyable and remarkably easy to drink despite it's bold roasted character."
"Clear burnt mahogany, tight head of foam. Very light aroma of dark roasted malts...I might be able to pick up some weak chocolate if I use my imagination. The taste is more bold, with the roastiness showing off a bit and the chocolate being actually noticeable. A thinnish body with modest carbonation. Nothing too memorable for me, but it's alright for the style."
"Appearance wise, I don't think you can get better for the style. Black color with a tan head that stays throughout with spotty lacing. Smell is of coffee, toffee, and roasted grain with a hint of hops hidden. Taste hits me with some burnt caramel flavor, with coffee kicking in right behind it, no real detectable hops in the taste, but it doesn't need them. Pretty light bodied with average carbonation, but seems just about right. Very drinkable, this would be great with a meal or just having a couple whenever. Definately a good decision."
"-Oelergud"
"Drink up. I will."
"I was able to pick up just one bottle to try. Appearance is dark brown with copper, a beige foam and some lacing. Aroma is of charred oak, toasted grain, semi-sweet dark chocolate. Initial taste is caramel and chocolate followed by a few bitter hops that try but cannot overcome the caramel sweetness. Kind of watery and over carbonated. Acidic finish. This is a good beer for a schwarzebier, but I keep thinking: with a little more body it would make a decent porter Â– I miss the creaminess. Not sure it is my style, or that I would try another."
"Pours a clear brown/red, small tan head forms, goes fast and leaves some spots of lace. Smell is sweet cherries, lots of roasted character, chocolate, dates and some floral. Taste is slightly oxidized, some dates, chocolate, roast, and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly sweet, low carbonation and a watery finish. Pretty good."
"Drinkability - decent, could have another, but probably won't for a while"
"Overall this beer is my favorite out of the current Brewmaster's Collection from Sam Adams. If only we could have just this beer alone in a 12 pack..."
"I have to admit I've stayed away from Sam Adams brews for years. Why? No valid reason whatsoever as I've discovered recently. They are consistent, drinkable, fundamental offerings."
"Drinkablitiy: With Sprecher around, this just isnÂ’t up to par."
"A good stab at the style and, overall, a pretty tasty and drinkable brew. But, just like most of the other beers from Sam Adams (Boston Beer Co.) itÂ’s solid not stellar. However, I do think that the Boston Beer Co. deserves a little more credit for this one: they were actually bold enough to market a beer style that most average beer drinkers no doubt found unusual but perhaps even a bit intimidating (Â“if itÂ’s dark, it must be really strong!Â”). But, by all accounts, itÂ’s been well received. Recommended."
"DidnÂ’t expect a coffe, almost stout like, aroma. Plenty of malt aroma and a little chocolate as well. Dark brown with ruby tones and a firm finger thick head. Ok this tastes like a watery porter. Very roasty with a lot of coffee notes. Malt sweetness there with a touch of chocalate again and some vanilla. It is actually a solidly good beer. It just tastes like a porter and not a Schwarzbier"
"I am looking forward to trying more of this style beer, iti s one of my favorites and another triumph for the Boston Beer Co."
"Drinkability Â– My first in the style, very interesting. Quite drinkable. Hopefully a good introduction to the style."
"A less than careful pour yields a 2-inch rocky tan head atop a garnet-brown see-through beer with meager carbonation. Subtle spicy noble hop aroma with yeasty sourdough notes. Tastes sweeter than the aroma, but in a very pleasing way: doughy-caramel sweetness of malts are nicely balanced by some Hallertauer spiciness. Creamy mouthfeel, light-to-medium body -- actually, more like medium, it's just lighter than I expected. For my buck, I think I prefer a more local offering of the style, but this is a fine beer nonetheless. Recommended."
"I'm not picking up much in the way of bitterenss, no aspect of the flavor seems to linger too long for me. It's dry and pleasant. I dig it."
"Overall: I wasn't sure what to expect in this one, and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth a try if you've never sampled one."
"Appearance was black with ruby colors around the edges. Off white head that was a bit thin. The taste had some dark chocolate and slightly coffee flavors. There was a very slight amount of hops in the after taste. Mouthfeel was nice and not as watery as some stouts can be, of course I guess that's because it's not a stout. As far as drinkabilty goes I guess you could knock back a few. If you get the Sam Adams Holiday pack this has the lowest alcohol in there so it would probably be the only one you could have a few of and not lose your legs."
"This beer was a dark brown with a hint of red. It had a small coffee-colored head that had good retention. Some nice lacing. A sweet caramel odor, don't get too much of the roasted grain. Tasted chocolate and coffee, with a minimal hoppiness. A smooth , not substantial feel. Pretty drinkable."
"This is a pretty good shwartzbier, I have only had a few and recall those being a bit more flavorful but this is a pretty tastey beer."
" This was enjoyable and would make a great after-dinner or session beer. I couldn't taste the alcohol in this, and the combination of flavors works well together here. I look forward to sampling this again in the near future!"
"The roast comes out most in the taste. Chocolate and coffee come mid-way, and the hops end it. A good balance"
"smooth toffee, rich caramel. minimal bitterness but detectable hop flavor. munich malts, maybe with some special B as well, give a nice smooth roasty character with a great subtle chocolate finish"
"Pours dark brown to black with medium to large head and good lacing. Smells of coffee and cream, chocolate, malts and hops. The taste is lacking for a dark lager. I little too on the coffee end for my preference. Leaves too much of a sour taste as well. All in all, this is a beer I would drink over many (i.e. the Bud Lights of the world) but its nothing to write home about. (sorry dave yoder!)"
"Smooth & malty beverage with a slight bitterness on the back end. Also quite a presence of thick, chocolate malts that add a degree of sweetness. A very hearty mouthfeel and a very tummy-warming experience, overall."
"An excellent session German style lager."
"ffrom the bottle. poured ruby black with a tan head that left some lacing. aroma,a little on the thin side caramel hits the nose first, than malts, chocolate, hops. flavor, malts, dark chocolate, hops, spices. not to bad easy drinking, could throw down a few of these with that low abv."
"Poured a deep , opaque ebony with garnet hued edges. Half finger beige head fell fairly quickly to light lacing. Smells rich and sweetly of chocolate maltiness undertoned with caramel/toffee aromas alongside. Taste is roasted malt and sweet chocolate, with hints of slight citrus present as the creamy milk-sweetened chocolate passes. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy, goes down with a superb smooth quality only hindered by a being a touch heavier on the carbonation, although not in excess to the point of ruining the brew. Very drinkable, excellent bier, very impressed all around. One of the best Sam Adams I've had the pleasure of sampling from the Boston Beer Co."
"But everything else to this beer was just top notch and hopefully they will sell this in six packs in my area. I will be a beer advocate on this one!"
"This bottle was part of a winter mixed pack. The label is notched as best by April 2006, and the code C27850005 is printed on the neck of the bottle."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. Overall a very creamy texture. A bit on the sweet side and maybe a little more hoppyness would be in order. A dam tasty beer."
"D - Better than most of Sam Adams's beers. It would work with many foods and as a session, but it is hardly a spectacular beer. Like your average Sam Adams, drink this cold, lest the offensive flavors come out to play. I mean it, drink this before it turns into soy sauce! Maybe it would go well with sushi?"
"Pours a really dark amber color, but not black exactly, with a dull white, foamy head. Smell is pretty sweet with burnt caramel/sugar aromas. Taste is still pretty sweet, with some decent roasted malt and bitter hop flavors. Lots of caramel flavors, not a lot of chocolate flavors. Not exactly complex, but well balanced. Mouth feel has plenty of carbonation as well as body. Overall, a decent brew, and probably my favorite offering from Sam Adams."
"Nicely done."
"It wasn't a bad beer, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
"I enjoyed this beer. It is a nice dark lager. IÂ’m sure it is billed as a seasonal (winter) offering, but I would be inclined to drink it occasionally year round. This is a very pleasant and drinkable dark beer."
"Pours nearly black, not much head. Light to moderate carbonation. Nose is light, malty, slight coffee notes. Taste is light as well, smooth sweet malts, coffee and milk. Mild and smooth. Pretty good and quite drinkable."
"Overall, excellent beer for a domestic. Very impressed with the Sam Adams I've tried thus far."
"Pours a schwarz-y black with a finger of eggshell head and passable lacing. Nose is husky, toasted malts, old, charred coffee grounds and a splash of bittersweet baking chocolate. Flavor is all malt - toasted bread with notes of burnt toffee and coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is actually a little creamy which was surprising - one of the more substantial schwarzes I've encountered. A nice offering from Sam Adams here, though it doesn't quite compete with Wisconsin's own Black Bavarian/Moravians. I've had 5 or 6 of their brews now and have yet to be disappointed."
"I enjoyed this beer a great deal, so much so, that it prompted my first beer review. Execellent smoothness and taste. My only complaint about this beer is that to the best of my knowledge, it's only available alone in sixers or variety packs with other Sam Adams beers. 2 per 6-pack; 3 per 12-pack. I don't mind trying the other beers but I would like to buy this beer in alone in a 12-pack or larger."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Head rises but to only about 1/2 finger befor settling to a nice bubbly tan cap on the beer. Lacing stays about 1 inch above the beer down the glass. The nose on this one is sweet, some sour dark fruits and slight sugary grains come through....if the aroma was more robust it would command a much higher score, but it is a bit faint. I really enjoyed the flavor of this one. Smooth slightly grainy with that sour dark fruit mirroring the nose. A neat mellow burnt flavor fin the finish but an overall smooth sweet and inviting taste. Very nice. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and adequately carbonated. This is very drinkable beer, smooth, sweet, mild and not too heavy easily sessionable. A nice choice for the cool months of winter."
"Overall--a great Sam Adams dark beer to drink in the winter. Glad I picked it up!"
"Overall: I donÂ’t get to drink that many Black Lagers, IÂ’d be hard pressed to name more than a couple of US versions of the style, so this is a solid change of pace and it is nicely done. I would but this again. Enjoyable!"
"D--a very nice sipping lager. Great on a cold Minnesota night!"
"Nice creamy mouth. Very easy drinker here. Well done Sam Adams!!"
"cheers..."
"Body between medium and light. Soft creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. Not bad at all!"
"I don't much care for lagers, so I won't lie and pretend I liked this one. It's just strange... I mean, if I want stout, I'll drink stout. If I was partial to lager I'd drink cat piss -- I mean, lager. I guess this could be a good cross-over beer for the lager fan who hasn't gotten into darker beer. Kind of mixed on this one. It's not an awful beer but you can get a lot better. Props to the BBC for trying something different, in any case."
"Cheers!"
"12 oz bottle pours a dark brownish almost black color, nice wispy brown head that leaves a good lacing in my glass, faint roasted coffee and chocolate aroma, decent roasted malty flavors, light bodied with a somewhat watery mouthfeel, it has a nice roasty bitter finish, average for the style, decent"
"Notes: A great style, one that I am new to, but will certainly seek out more examples of. As I said before, the idea of a lager with the taste complexities and appearance of an ale (almost a porter) intrigues me, and Sam Adams does this to near perfection."
"Song Listened to Whilst Enjoying this Beer: ""Such a Little Thing Makes Such A Big Difference", Morrissey, off the Bona Drag LP(1990)."
"Overall, the best offering I've tried so far from Sam Adams. A definite buy-again."
"Good beer all in all."
"drinkability is downright dangerous, i could drink these one after another without a second thought. the one i am drinking right now tastes great with vanilla ice cream."
"All in all the mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery, but this also kept the beer crisp...and gave it infinite drinkability in an on-tap type setting; so what this lacks in depth and sophistication, it certainly makes up for in seesion-factor, if you will, in my opinion."
"This is a damn tasty and drinkable beer, one of the best Samuel Adams beers. I had this a year ago in Ohio at a party and it struck me as sort of a light porter that was just OK as a beer. Now that I have seriously tasted this it is an exceptional Schwarzbier. No doubt some of the goodness here is having an outstandingly fresh bottle that hasn't made the sea journey from Germany. Having qualified this it is a very good example of the style."
"Like a good schwarzbier, this is deceptively light bodied for its appearance. This beer samples from the best of two more common styles: great roasted malt characters, hop bitterness and aroma in a lighter bodied beer that isnÂ’t out of whack. A nice take on a rare style."
"Mouth feel is on the light side of medium bodied and actively carbonated."
"Taste is smooth with a hint of roast and toast flavors matching nicely with the sweet. The hops just peek through at the end to provide a pleasent finish. It's quite drinkable. A very nice, mild, somewhat subtle, beer."
"The Sam Adams Black Lager might not be quite as robust as some of my favorite styles, but I definitely enjoyed drinking it, and am looking forward to my next one..."
"It looks like your typical schwarzbier and tastes like your typical schwarzbier. No schwarzbier isn't really typical in itself, but this is as close as I've seen to a run of the mill example of the style. Very clean yet full of rich burnt flavors and relatively light in the stomach. Not very complex, maybe some of you find it to be, but I think it could have been alot more interesting. It is what could be considered a session brew, but I keep such wide variety, that I rarely drink two of the same type in a row. Recommended."
"Easy to drink."
"This poured nearly black with hints of red. The head was not the best. The most overpowering smell in this beer is the malts. As the beer is tasted you can really sense roasted malts. The beer is not overly hoppy but there is a good level of bitterness to it. There is a good level of carbonation and there is a welcome thickness it your mouth. This a fantastic beer and is especially welcome during these winter months."
"Overall, one of my favorite SA products. Exceptionally pleasant and very well composed, medium bodied beer. I would recommend this all year round even though it is somewhat hard to come by in my neighborhood. It is excellent to have a dark beer that is not a stout or a porter every now and then."
"This is a pretty interesting beer for Sam Adams to make. They take a lot of flak for pandering to the lowest common denominator, but they're just smart business-people. As long as they keep making beer like this, I'll continue to be a fan. The Black Lager pours black, as the name suggests, with a thin tan head. The aroma opens up a bit as the beer warms. Filled with a malty sweetness with some chocolate and perhaps caramel. The taste is mostly sweet chocolate and caramel, neither of which ever becomes overpowering or cloying. There's a bit of a biscuit element in the background. It finishes with a slight roasted bitterness and an even slighter bit of hoppiness. The mouthfeel is a bit light, but no more so than most Schwarzbiers. You can definitely tell this is a lager. The drinkability is superb. This is a great tasting beer that would be great to bring to a party. None of the tastes overwhelm or challenge your palate, but they all come together to form a tasty beverage."
"Drinkability: Despite having the horrifying descriptor ""clean finish"" (re: flavorless shite) in the packaging, this actually is a nicely balanced beer with a tight finish. Not a world beater, but a nice session; it'd be a a good transition beer for the marco crowd."
"Pours dark black with a tan head that stays for a while. Smells of malt and chocolate with a hint of caramel. Taste is surprisingly great. Sweet malt, chocolate, and caramel. The blend of tastes is superb. Very smooth. Due to the beer being sweet I couldn't drink too many of these in a sitting. I really enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying more of this style. The inclusion of this along with the Holiday Porter makes their holiday 12-pack better than ever."
"Another solid offering from Sammy A. The carbonation was not obtrusive at all, and all-in-all, this was a great, very drinkable beer; I could drink a sixer myself, given that this is so much lighter in body than most dark beers like stouts and porters (which I gather Schwarzbier is supposed to be). Too bad, again, that I can only find this in the holiday mix pack."
"I hope they keep carrying it."
"Beer is indeed black with a nice tan head. The aroma features a hint of caramel and slight malt and not much else. Flavorwise the beer doesn't have the bittersweet nature of a porter - rather, its clean, with a maltiness and some caramel notes blending with a faint chocolatey character. Hop presence seems just there to balance. Overall a decent beer but slightly tame - probably not a bad example of the style, though I suspect it could be a little more robust in its toasted / roasted malt character without overdoing it too much."
"Drinkability: great as this can be quaffed all night long. One of Sam's better brews."
"Oh My Gosh, this is really good. Smooth mouth feel with a malty sweet sundry fruit backbone that is well balanced with the bittering of hops, I do hope that this one stays around."
"Pours the deepest, darkest crimson red to bitter chocolate hue, nearly opaque. Creates a fine offwhite head. Aroma is burnt malt and smoke. Flavor is mildly bitter with an array of subtle tastes of smoke, chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel. Medium to light on the palate, crisp lager like carbonation and a spicy dry finish. Hmm, its like a lagered porter, pretty nice and the first Schwarzbier that I have reviewed."
"A great example of the style, suprising that Boston Beer Co would take such a risk."
"The roasted character here is soft, and you really wonÂ’t find the astringent, harsh roasted bitterness roasted barley imparts to stouts and some porters. In the finish, the roasted character becomes more noticeable, but the beer still finishes creamy and smooth. There arenÂ’t a lot of hops here, either, just a touch. Amazing."
"Nicely drinkable. If it were from GLBC or Bell's people would be buying this up like crazy. It is a real craft brew made by a brewery that many BAs think of as a second choice brewery."
"Strangely, every time I go to drink this beer I expect to experience the same slight disappointment I get with Saranac beers (they sound and look great, but just don't really hit the spot) however, Sam Adams is not Saranac and I should know by now that they consistently deliver the goods on a regular basis."
"This is one of SAs better efforts, can't wit tofind some on draft where they know how to talk care of the product!"
"This beer pours a dark brown / ruby color with a light brown head. the head fades slowly leaving a good amount of laces. This beer is a somewhat thin malty aroma. It has a biscutlike aroma. Not much hop aroma. It also has a slightly nutty aroma. This beer has a clean malty taste. It has a biscutlike flavor. It has a slightly nutty flavor also. It has very litle hop flavor. It is kind of boring. Not too much to say. This beer might be a little overcarbonated. It goes down smooth leaving a slightly malty aftertaste. This beer might make a good session beer, because it is low in alcohol, but as far as the flavoe goes, I usually look for a little more. Worth a try though."
"Mmmm Lecker!"
"This is one of my favorite offerings from Samuel Adams. I could drink many of these in a row."
"Pours a liquid oil black with a beautiful mocha head that rises and maintains nicely. The smell is of roasted marshmellows and toast, a nice malt honey with bits of cherry. The taste deep roasted character with a marshmellow chewiness. This is a fabulous beer. Medium bodied and very drinkable, great session beer for these winter months."
"This is a pretty tasty beer, but I wouldn't drop $8 for it again in that its just not that particularly memorable. Good conversion beer for those 'afraid of dark beer' nancies."
"Easy enough to drink. Probably better than the Koestritzer I've had."
"12 oz., with purchase before Dec. notched on the side. Pours into the pilsner glass almost black with cherry red tinges and a 2 finger khaki head that leaves some wisps of lace. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and mild hops with caramel showing up 1/3 of the way through. First sip has lots of roasted and hop bitterness with raisins, coffee, chocolate, earthy malts, and floral/spicy hops that show up toward the end. Caramel also shows up in the taste 1/3 of the way through and the roasted/hop bitterness evens out as I drink. It has a medium body, but seems thick for a lager, coating the mouth well. Pretty good, but not great."
"Suprisingly satisfing. A good 'whenever' beer."
"I picked this up on a whim, being a fan of the Saranac offering of the same type. Since then, I've bought a few 6'ers and found each bottle consistently high quality, smooth, drinkable with a very rich taste. This is definitely a beer to be savored. Smell is rich and malty. Taste is rich, with hints of carmel, but much more carefully balanced than some. Full mouth feel with just the right carbonation to be refreshing. What can I say? It's great! I hadn't always been a huge Sam Adams fan until this came along. Those Boston Beer guys (and gals) know what they're doing!"
"-Cheers2Beers"
"I love this stuff!! Sam Adams may be a huge company now but they still put out some good product and this black lager is one of my new favorites. So far I've only gotten it in the mix packs, so mix packs I'll have to buy. Dark ruby/black color, nice smell, taste is a mix of dried fruit, caramel, roasted malt done very well. This is the first black lager I've tried, now I'm looking foward to finding more of this style."
"Appearance: Dark ruby brown tone only when held up to the light, forms a fluffy tan two fingered head leaves behind evenly dispersed fine chunky lace. Aroma: Dark roasted malts mild chocolate with an herbal German noble hop tone going on, standard for a schwarzbier. Taste: Easy drinking caramel flowing malt backbone blended nicely with the cocoa slightly burnt flavor, herbal German hop character is subtle but dances nicely in the whole mix. Mouthfeel: A nice medium bodied black lager goes down very smooth carbonation does tickle the gullet just a bit, overall easy drinking. Drinkability: Great representation of a schwarzbier Sam Adams does a nice job brewing this German specialty, the only other version I have had that blows this away was Heavyweight's Black Ocean which was a small beer version of Perkuno's Hammer not mindblowing but solid."
"This is a quality Schwartzbier, and at the affordable Sam Adams prices- quite a find."
"Smooth mouthfeel, kind of creamy or oily. Mostly grainy flavor. A very good beer and I'm glad it was included in the holiday pack."
"Very drinkable. I was recommended this beer by a co-worker. He's right, it's very good. Now that I have tried it in the variety pack, it could easily become a regular purchase in the standard 6-pack."
"Good session beer here. Seems like a lighter alternative to a stout - malty and sweet. Enjoyable and not to be overlooked."
"Pours very dark, but you can see through it in the light. A very dark red. Thin, tan head of medium bubbles. Aroma is of roasted grains. Slight coffee. I immediately taste black patent malt. Seems this is where the dark color comes from. (note: the bottle says Â“Specialty roasted caramel and chocolate maltsÂ”, but the taste to me is all black patent and a bit of crystal 120). Light body. Nice and clean in the finish with the burnt character lingering for a while balanced with a bit of sweetness. A Â“porter lightÂ” without the sweetness."
"Drinkability: The lightness of this brew and it's pleasant flavour make it easy to drink as a session beer. This is something I could drink all day, and I say that about very few beers."
"This was a another nice offering from S.A. Pours a deep chestnut color with a large frothy tan head that holds for a good amount of time. Aroma is a bit weak but definitely had a baker's chocolate, nutty, and toasted grain element to it. Taste is really quite nice. Begins with some toasted grains. Then moves to a more creamy, milky flavor. Chocolate sits in the background until the finish which leans on the sweet side. Hops are there and provide balance and some bitterness the whole way. Mouthfeel was leaning on the thin side but it wasn't too thin. This does have a lager feel to it and is quite a nice drinker. Worth trying."
"If blindfolded I'd probably have guessed it was Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter. I wasn't sure what to expect from this aside from the usual reviewed adjectives (chocolate, caramel and malts). It is much more than that. Indeed a pleasant surprise."
"Easy to drink yet flavorful, a rare style that may gain some popularity."
"A two-finger tan head is produced by this dark brown, almost black beer. Garnet-hued light can be seen through this darkness. Frothy head went down slowly and left good lacing. Aromas of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Smooth coffee like feel with dark chocolate notes. Not bitter at all with a nutty finish. Balanced in the mouth. A highly drinkable beer."
"Overall: A rather unique departure from my normal lighter-bodied beers. Very drinkable, and would make an excellent introduction to darker beers for those just getting into craft beers."
"Drinkability: This is a solid beer, quite enjoyable. Another fine offering from Sam Adams."
"Definitely my favorite of Sam Adams' Brewmaster Series."
"My first Sam Adams! This beer is a very deep burgundy. A thin head rides atop this bad boy. The smell is unique. It has a fruity aroma to it. The taste is pretty good too. The mouthfeel is affected a small amount due to a weird burn but not too much. I could drink several of these if I had em'. I'll probably run across one of these again."
"First of all, the beer looked beautiful, kind of reminded me of Guinness. I loved the thick, tan head. Smell was decent. The taste is the best (and most important) thing about this beer. Wow. It was deep an chocolatey (sp?), but with a few hints of honey and not very bitter. This was my first schwarzbier, and now I'm anxious to try some more."
"Dark with a good fluffy foamy head that has nice retention. Very complex smell. Kind of reminds me of grilled steak. Very rich and complex taste. Lightly roasted. Spice. Kind of chocolate milky sweet. Almost too much of a mixture. Very crisp and warming in the mouth. Complexity makes it less drinkable than it could be, but overall still very drinkable. This is a very good beer that I will look for in the future."
"Very dark color, with a lacing that doesnÂ’t move at all giving it a thick consistency. Smell is terrific, much like German Schwarzbiers with a hint of fruit and a big presence. Taste has same big dense fruity taste with a hint of smokiness. Mouthfeel is a little light, and even though the first taste is big, the swallow is pretty light like a lager. This makes it very drinkable, and the layers in the taste add to this."
"The name of this brew holds true as it is a black lager. It also has a very light tan colored, creamy head. The aroma is malty with the usual lager smell. The taste is nice. Sweet and with spices mildy poking through. Not nearly as spicy as other schwarzbiers I have had, but refreshing none the less. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew."
"This was a nice attempt by the BBC to brew something a little less mainstream and I would say they pulled it off really well. I would even suggest this to beer newbies who don't want to delve too deep into the world of darker beers right away. This beer is flavorful and well-crafted, but certainly not intimidating to the uninitiated. Recommended!"
"A full two finger head with a dark black color.This has a nice malt and chocolate aroma.Sam's has made a very nice dark rich coffee/chocolate beer with alot of flavor.Almost like a light stout.I was happily surprised when I tried this.This is probably the best beer I've had from Sam Adams."
"This beer was a suprise and I am glad that I tried it. It started out with a nice pour and had a great dark brown color with a light brown head that left great lace and stayed till the end. The smell was nice with some sweet malt scents and molasses and some bready-ness to it. This beer's flavor was very nice with a very light smokiness in the beginning and the light airy mouthfeel really added to the overall sensation. The beer finnished with a bit of sweetness and faded away very dry and made you want to come back for more. This is my favorite Sam Adams release in awhile!"
"Smooth, and fairly drinkable, although not as complex as I prefer a schwarzbier."
"Pours a dark brown in color with a light tan head. Aroma primarily consists of chocolate malt. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. Grainy, chocolatey flavor upfront and carries midway though. It turns slightly vinous toward the finish with a lingering bitterness. Pretty straight-forward. I guess I was expecting more. This isn't a bad beer, just not overly exciting."
"Very drinkable and I'd never refuse one of these. However, if I wanted a cheaper black lager, I'd still go with Saranac Black Forest. Possibly a good beer for someone just starting to try darker beer."
"Sweeter than I would prefer, but not bad at all. I could session this for a while, but I would eventually switch to something more bitter."
"Pours black with a very nice two finger head. Smell is chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is dominated by roasted malt- chocolate and caramel flavors are present and there is just a bit of hops in the finish. Quite sweet and very tastey. Mouthfeel is medium and not a lot of carbonation which actually I think suits this beer. Overall quite drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Flavor is slightly roasty, but the chocolate is fairly prominent. The caramel comes through in a kind of roasted toffee flavor that's quite nice. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it's not entirely detrimental; I just think a little creamier would hold up to the sweet flavors a bit better."
"Head dissipated fairly quickly, with just a fine lacing on the side. Pleasant smell of roastiness followed by excellent roasty flavour with hints of chocolate. Plenty of complexity and still a smooth drinker. A very good candidate for a session beer, imho."
"I was happy to see they have added this to the Holiday Pack."
"Best before Dec 05. Pours a black color with some carbonation and a little head, some nice lacing throughout. Scents of hops, and caramel, chocolate. There's a nice sweet taste which I liked and you still have the lager presence. Medium body. Very drinkable, a must session beer for this style. Will put this on my list to buy again."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable - not the best schwarzbier I have ever had, but very approachable. Another nice beer from Sam."
"Damn this is a good beer. Considering the other mellowed beers the BBC has released I was expecting this to be just a boring dark version of Sam lager or something. This borders more on a mildly smoked porter. Really an outstanding beer. Makes me want to try more schwarzbier. A fantastic session beer."
"Cheers"
"Pours almost black with red tinges around the edge. Formed about a 1/2"" tan head that faded fairly quickly. Aroma of roasted malt, almost molasses like. Taste is very smooth with hints of caramel and chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a bit of hop bitterness showing through on the tail end. Overall a pretty nice brew and well executed. I gave a lower score on drinkability because I find it to be a rather filling beer and I really don't think I could drink more than two of these in a row. Makes a great after dinner brew though."
"Flavor is slightly sweet up front with a hint of brown sugar and then gives way to roasted malt and some espresso like flavors. OVerall the beer is sweet and mild which makes it incredibly easy to drink. Not a big thinking beer, but for sure a tasty one!"
"Loved the black color in the glass, with the tan 1"" head, very inviting. The pour showed a deep ruby color that you couldn't see in the glass. Sweet caramel, with a bit of coffee and some roasted almond smokiness in the smell. The taste started like a bitter chocolate, then some molasses, and ending with the bitter chocolate with a very clean finish, nothing left behind. There was low carbonation and a medium body making the beer very easy to drink. I really liked this. I only tried two other black or dark lagers (Victory and Weeping Radish) and this beat both of them."
"poured a deep brown, almost black color with tannish puffy head that lasted throughout the gflass. Some reddish tints noted. Smell is toasty with caramel in the background. First taste is very good with chocolate, coffee, and caramel found, but as the beer starts to warm the taste become less impressive. Finishes very mildly. An OK beer, but not great."
"An almost black appearance with a two-finger width head that dissipated rather quickly. A faint smell of raosted malt. Highly drinkable with a heavy raosted taste that lingers for awhile, with hints of fig. Like a medium-roast coffee that can be gulped instead of sipped."
"Pours opaque, nearly black with a ruby tint. A tan, three finger head with a creamy consistency and good retention that leaves spiderweb lacing. Noble and floral hops in the nose, with a roasted malt aroma and raisin or fig scent. Bitterness is mild, and comes mostly from the hops. Sweet dark fruit flavor from the malt gives it a decent balance. Mouthfeel comes off very smooth with a middle of the road body and carbonation; but the hops fail to dry the sweet finish, and the drinkability suffers."
"Best before Sept '05 on the bottle. I'm pleased anytime an American brewery crafts their version of a Schwarzbier. This one pours a deep mahogany, not quite black. Thick foamy head quickly reduces to a thin lace around the glass. Nose has some charred malt and hazelnut aromas. Imparts some dark chocolate and a nutty peanut buttery flavor balanced by a quick mild hop zing in the finish. Love the fact that its sub 5%-ABV...such an easy drinker, and a true session beer for sure. Mouthfeel is a bit acrid and spritzy on the tip of the tongue at first, but graduates to a smoothness in the finish. One I'd gladly take a few of, and a bit more flavorful than their standard ""lager"" offering."
"Overall this isnt a bad beer, especially for the price, but is a far cry from other blacks."
"Mouthfeel is lager thin, but clean and refreshing, and easily drinkable. Pretty tasty, and went down very easily."
"Mouthfeel is relatively flat and smooth. Subtle chocolate and mocha notes make themselves known before the brew settles into a common hoe hum finish. I could use more hop kick, but then again I have never reviewed a Schwarzbier so this could be the norm. All in all not a bad brew from one of the more mainstream craft breweries."
"My hats off to SA...my new favorite of their offerings and one I would gladly enjoy again."
"I think of this beer as a porter fermented with lager yeast. Lots of deep roasted malt flavor like a strong porter, but just a bit smoother from the lagering. I believe this one only comes in the case of the Brewmaster's collection, similar to the way they only sell Old Fezzi in the Holiday collection."
"Whatever the case may be, this really is a good brew and if it becomes a year round brew that's easy to find, I could see it making its way into my rotation of session brews."
"The aroma is very malty, with hints of caramel and dark chocolate. The taste is good with a very balanced mix of malt and hops. It is not very chewy like a stout, but is medium bodied. There is a good sampling of hops in the aftertaste. Overall, a very good beer."
"Very nicely done! And interestingly enough, the caramel character of this one reminds me very much of my other favorite Sam Adams beer, their Cream Stout. I could enjoy this beer year round, and I think it would be just as appropriate at a bachelor party, poker game, summer BBQ, ski trip, company picnic or Thanksgiving Feast. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: Light enough in body and not bad at all. It could be a bit more interesting."
"Another very good beer from Sam Adams. They don't get every style right, sometimes not even close, but this one is a keeper."
"Pours to a thin off-white head with bits of lace. Color is deep, brilliant ruby. Aroma suggests a lagerlike slickness blended with the roastiness you'd expect from a porter or stout. Low amount of noble/spicy hop aroma. Flavor is sweet malt dominant, not really roasty at all. It is on the sweet side of the style--almost too sweet. I was expecting a drier beer. Mouthfeel is medium. Finishes slightly roasty and malty. Could use a bit more bitterness, but overall a pleasant experience."
"I never know what to expect from Boston Beer Company. Some of their offerings are yawners and others are very good. Black Lager is closer to very good and was a nice surprise. It's only my third beer of this style and is clearly better than the two German schwarzbiers that preceded it. Good stuff."
"The beer is a pitch black that lessens on the side where a dark amber allows a little light through. It poured with a finger of head that didn't leave much, if any, lacing on the glass. The beer's aroma swept over my nose with a caramel maltiness that is intoxicating in itself. Something to really close your eyes and just linger over as you allow that idea of the taste to just appear in your mind. The taste mimics the smell but with a bigger chocalate character that introduced itself as it started down my throat. The mouthfeel was definitely on the lighter side. I'm a big fan of porters, and this reminds me of something like a porter light, almost reminiscent of what a Pino Noir is to other red wines. This beer is not overly heavy, and something that has made me want to finish a few more of these tonight, and explore this style more - if not this particular beer."
"Pours a translucent blackish-brown with a thick tan head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is roasted chocolate, molasses and light grainy scent. Taste begins with a chocolate and roasted flavor, followed by a thin grainy flavor that subsides into a molasses sweetness, and a light hops bittering at the end that meshes well with the roastiness. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, even for a lager really. Drinkability is quite good, another very drinkable and flavor offering from BBC."
"Pours with a thick, frothy full tan colored head that sits atop a deep amber colored beer that shows clear ruby highlights when held up to the light. The aroma is fairly tame with notes of chocolate, and astringent roast coffee. The taste is smooth and almost creamy up front, it then moves to a malty sweet note that accentuates the notes of chocolate that are also found in the taste. It finishes with a bit of hoppy spiciness and a lightly biting bitterness. The chocolate notes of this beer are the most noticeably and make for an easy drinking smooth beer. This is a pretty good attempt, but I must admit I like a bit more smooth roast character in my Schwarzbiers."
"This brew is a very dark, nearly black, liquid with a slight reddish hue. Moderate size on the cream-colored head. The aroma is very nice: dark chocolate and coffee. ItÂ’s a very roasted, even burnt aroma. ThereÂ’s not a lot of sweetness in this brewÂ…just a hint in the foretasteÂ…instead, the flavor centers on the nice roasted characters. ThereÂ’s a little caramel, a little charcoal, and a little chalkiness. Just a small amount of hop bitterness in the finish, which is pretty dry. This is a very nice brewÂ…one of the better from Sam AdamÂ’s in recent years."
"Overall, I ended up liking this Sam Adams brew. Easily drinkable and showing decent breadth of character. Recommended."
"A fine anytime brew."
"D: Really good beer, especially for a relatively large brewery."
"The taste was cocoa bean right on the front of the tongue. Mixed with a barley made a good combination of flavor on the palate. The toasted malts came through in the aftertaste. The taste was well preserved as time went on. I thoroughly enjoyed this different Sam Adam's brew."
"I'm not an adams type of person, but this is an exception! Try it!"
"This beer was smooth and poured quite nice. It had a darkish tan head the led to some even lacing around the glass. Very dark in color almost a real ruby black color. Smelled great with hints of coffee or chocolate quite malty. It was a very enjoyable beer and went down very smooth and refreshingly. It is a great beer by my opion. It is nice to have the stronger malt and coffee flavors come through in a lighter brew rather than a Porter or Stout which usually has these flavors. Samual Adams does a great job accenting the distinct flavors in their brews. Very enjoyable and would recomend others to try."
"Pours a fluffy medium tan head over clear deep brown liquid. Sweet malt and light chocolate nose. Subtle chocolate and roasted barley flavors with brief fruity note. Light yet palpable hoppiness. Lingering roastiness makes this lager lip smacking good...very good. One of the better Sam A brews"
"Dark, dark looking beer. Smells... coffeeish, caramel, a hint of some spices. Taste is great- more coffee, some chocolate, a nice amount of caramel. A bit of roasted flavors as well. This tasted to me like a light stout- same bold, tasty flavors, but it wasn't nearly as heavy or filling. In fact, the mouthfeel on this was quite nice- a bit bubbly, chewy, and not heavy. Very drinkable. Very tasty."
"Deep chestnut brown in color. Slight tan head and some good lacing. Very low aroma-some caramel notes. Slightly sweet. Good malty flavor-low roasted bitterness. Hop flavor only slightly discernable. Nice mouthfeel. Full yet somewhat crisp. A good beer from Sam Adams. Hats off to them for doing a style that not a lot of breweries try. Well worth having."
"Tasted: 06/26/05"
"Little to average carbonation on the sip, followed by a bit of smooth buttery richness is the body of this. Pretty full-bodied, making it tough to drink more than one or a few of these."
"Pours a very dark brown with reddish tints and a thin beige head that quickly fades to a thin cap. Aroma is chocolate, currants, caramel, and some roasted malts. Taste starts out as dry unsweetened chocolate, moving into a mild roasted bitterness and then a pleasant hop bite that lingers for just a second. Mouthfeel and carbonation are both medium for a creamy smooth feeling. This is a drinkable summer alternative to a porter or a stout that I quite enjoyed."
"This beer pours black with an off-white head that faded into a ring around my glass. The aroma is predominately chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is of chocolate, roasted malt, mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent. Medium body and carbonation. It's a pretty good tasting beer. It's better than I had guessed it would be."
"12 ounce bottle, best before September 2005."
"The best Sam's I've had so far. Pours a dark dark brown but notably not blackish. Dense tan head that laced well. You've get hints of amber in the sunlight. Smelled malty, a bit of coffee, and pleasantly sweet. The nose didn't require deliberate effort, it just wafter off into your senses. The taste was nearly exceptional with a smooth consistent malt/baker's chocolate/coffee/barley taste that even my beer fearing GF loved. Creamy smooth, carbonated just right, with no bothersome residue and very drinkable."
"It was kind of twisty and turny, in that it never seemed to finish an impression before it moved on to the next one, but the sum of the part is tasty enough to make it an easy quaff. I'm not about to sing its praises, but I will gladly have another...just not likely on my dime, thank you."
"Had I tried this beer last week I would have entered it as my pick for the ""what is your go to session beer"" thread du jour."
"This one pours a dark brown color with a tall off-white head that has good retention and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has a light coffee and chocolate thing going on - smells pretty good, but also very mild. The flavor doesn't have the same level of coffee, but it has a nice dose of the chocolate. Pretty creamy body for a schwarzbier. The drinkability is very good. I'm very impressed with this beer. As good if not better than any other schwarzbier I've had."
"Pours from the bottle charcoal black with a slight ruby tinge. Light head that tapers off to a nice lacing. Aromas are typical for a schwartzbier/dark lager. Roasted malts, barley, etc. Taste is fairly one dimensional. Dark roasted malts, slightly sweet up front, slightly bitter finish. Someone thin in the mouthfeel. I've found this with a lot of schwartzbiers though, so I think some of my opinion may be based on the fact that this is not one of my favorite styles. I do give SA credit for branching out into an often overlooked style which tells me they're quite all about profits yet. Its a quite drinkable beer though, wouldn't make a bad session brew I think. I'd be curious to have it on tap."
"Took a surprisingly long time for this to show up in sixers around here. Nice dark color with a touch of ruby at the edge. Gentle, sweet malt aroma. Straightforward roasted malt flavors - no straying into coffee or chocolate here - just moderated roastedness. A little sweet marshmallow in the back, and finishes with enough tannic astringency to clean up. Nicely done, particularly for what is now a ""better quality macro brewer."" I also give them credit for going with a fairly stark, but accurate name for the beer, rather than some catchy mass-marketing name."
"Pours a nice black color, or maybe just very dark brown, with tan- tinged head, that thins out quickly. Slight roast smell with a little toffee- sweet smell. Tastes a tiny bit sweet with mild roast malts balancing it well. Feels nice and crisp in the mouth, but surprises me by giving a decent fullness in the mouth midswallow. Light enough to drink several of. This is nice- it's kind of like a very light stout, but has enough flavor and balance to make such a light beer tasty."
"A very nice offering from the Sammy beer folks. This one pours out to a nice, blackness in the glass with a slight head. At first glance you think you are about to imbibe on a stout or porter only to be surprised at first by how light it is, then impressed at how flavorful it finishes. This one starts out a bit slow but builds impressively on the mouthfeel to deliver tastes of chocolate, coffee and malt. Very nicely done. A fine Schwarzbeir."
"Sampled as part of the Brewmaster's Collection mixed sixpack. The color is almost black with a ruby glow when viewed against a light source. Head is average-sized and light brown. Retention is pretty good for a dark lager. Aroma is a little too low key, but nice bready malts are noticed with just a touch of spice. The taste is primarily of an excellent chocolatey malt. Subtle flavors of roastedness, nuttiness, and spice add layers of complexity. For me, Samuel Adams Black Lager is addictively tasty. Now if they would only start selling this by the sixer around here, I would have no problems with the Boston Beer Company."
"Pours blackish to dark brown in color. Head is tanish and overfills the glass. Aroma is almost non-existent. Not any distinguishable aroma. First sip reveals a roasted taste. Some charcoal and sweetness in the aftertaste. Tastes of ashes and sweetness. Very typical schwarzbier taste. Not my favorite style but definitely a credible example. Part of a variety six pack. Best before Sept. 2005."
"Pours a dark (duh) ruby red brown, not qiute black. Has a creamy 2 finger head and very nice lacing. Smells of a slightly roasted malt with hits of coffee. Smells more on the sweet side than roasted side, good chocolate smells as well. A fine tasting schwarzbier. Mild roastedness with some nice sweet malts with some coffee and chocolate flavors. Not a bunch of hoppiness to speak of but just enough, maybe even a bit lacking. High carbonation. Crisp. A nice session beer."
"Overall-a nice suprise, between this and Saranac's Black Forest Schwarzbeir I'm beginning to like the style but this is fantastic, a great surprise, very flavorful and unlike anything most have tried. A good way to get others into the darker spectrem of beet that isn't called ""Guinness"""
"I think this is a great session beer. It goes well with bread, and even with ribs. I recommend this as a great way to introduce someone to darker beer."
"Praise again to the Boston Beer Company. This is a helluva beer. Pours out to what appears to be a dark brown color, but when held to the light, appears more of a burnt rasberry red. Odors of carmel and chocolate were noted, although they were very weak. Also had a earthy character. Flavor was much lighter than expected, not saying this is a weak or wimpy beer by any means. Complex flavors of malt, caramel and herbs were most present, as was a slighly smokey quality. Mouthfeel was smooth and slighly creamy. Recommended."
"pours out a nearly opaque black colour, with ruby hues and crimson edges. a fine and short lived creamy head leaves just traces of lace. light cocoa aromas with a hint of caramel and another hint of fruitiness. upon tasting, a fine chocolate and caramel candy bar flavour hits me, like a liquid milky way...very satisfying. i would compare this to the chocolate bock recipe sans the added real chocolate. quite tasty for a dark lager or schwarzbier. there is a hint of spice and smoke which adds an added depth that keeps thing interesting and keeps me sipping. this is a really nice brew. mouthfeel is medium to light as a lager of this caliber should be, lightly carbonated and not too prickly. quite smooth and soft and highly drinkable, although maybe after three or four one might find themselves wanting to move on to something else. finishes dry....this flavourful lager is never sweet or cloying, making it quite impressive within its style. i'm impressed. i'd definitely buy this again should i see it in six packs."
"Bottle. Pours deep mahagoney, almost black, with a small tan foamy head that dissipates to a thin rocky film. Roasted and caramel malt aroma with a dark coffee, chocolate finish. Faint hop notes rise into the air as well. Initially smooth sweet dark chocolate flavor. It finishes lightly hoppy and spicy. Medium body and fizzy, a bit butpy, and crisp finish."
"Poured out a light black color with some ruby tones with a good looking head. Smell consisted of burnt grains, chocolate (sweetened and bitter), with some malts and caramel sitting in the background. Taste was pretty decent. Sweet malts with caramel start out with an underlying of coffee and toffee which linger into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a let down. Finished a little bit too sweet and was quite watery I thought. Other than the mouthfeel, it's not a bad beer."
"I'll have to try this one again to develop a firm opinion."
"Only the second schwarzbier I have tried to date with Saranac Black Forest being the first. The first one was a truly great beer, so I had high expectations for this one. Nothing wrong with the appearance. Very dark brown almost black color with a small tan head. High in carbonation and not too much read retention. Mild aroma with some roasted malts poking thru. The hop bitterness resulted in a great taste, but a dry mouthfeel and a bitter aftetaste. This beer was a little tough to finish but tasted good. My enjoyment of the beer decreased as it got warmer."
"The after its extraction from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the class a very deep ruby color with a substantial frothy light tan head and lots of sticky lace to cover the glass. Hints of caramel, malt sweet, somewhat coffee like, with the start nicely malted and a bit sweet, top is moderate in its feel. Finish is sternly acidic with the hops delightfully spicy, quite dry and somewhat tart aftertaste, a drinkable beer."
"The finish on the beer is a bit bitter, but overall the brew is pretty nice, and I think it's pretty drinkable. I really prefer the Sam Adams Cream Stout to this one, if we're comparing SA dark beers, but this was certainly worth the try and if I can ever find it in a six-pack by itself I'll probably buy it."
" The mouthfeel was smooth, creamy with a slight burnt after-taste. Drinkability is great, mild and easy. Not much in the way of this beer to hinder drinkability. A true easy drinker, thats just delicious."
"If you like beers that are sweet-but-not-sticky, and if you're not a huge hophead, I can't imagine a more perfect beer, at least not for the price (as long as I don't think of it as $6.99 for a 2-pack)."
"Not bad at all."
"Good olÂ’ Sammy. Decent black pour with dark mahogany edges, topped off by a foamy tan head Â– which dissipated a little too quickly. Rich, malty aroma with underlying biscuits and bread. Tastes included above, along with the standard black beer notes of leather and earth Â– although generally a tad weak. Still a good medium to full bodied, very drinkable with meals, frosty. Side note: compared with 1554 from New Belgium, would go with the 1554."
"Overall = Interesting style that I've never tried before. I do recommend this if you've never had it although personally it's not my preferred style. I can respect it and think it's an above average brew."
"Surprise, surprise. Very nice. Pours very black with a slight head. No lace. Nose is of toasted malts and just slightly of yeast. Flavor is surprisingly really good. The toastred malts come through strong, but not swinging for the fences. Also got tones fo sourdough bread in there. Hops are there to give it a nice and subtle balance. Mouthfeel is fairly light but the flavor sits on the tongue after a while. Very drinkable, goes down smooth."
"Good job, guys. The Black Lager is a winner."
" There are alot of earthy, musky smells at first. Then there is some creamy, chocolatey, toasted maltiness as well. The toasty malt comes across even better in the taste. Very full flavored, like strongly brewed coffee. I only get phantom wafts and tastes of the hops.. it's in there, but the malt is the dominant characteristic here. Medium bodied, very strong carbonation.. a bit too much. I can't make up my mind about the drinkability.. it has some good taste qualities, but the carbonation is way too strong.. you be the judge."
"Nice example of a style we don't see enough of around here."
"I bought the sampler pack that came with two bottles of Black Lager. The beer pours out a nice dark mahogony with about a 1/4"" tan head that left a nice lace on the pint glass. This was a very good beer! I love black beers (1554, Kostritzer) and Sam did not dissapoint. Good aroma of roasted malt. The flavor was the same with very good earthy, roasted, coffee flavors. Highly drinkable(possible session beer?), well balanced beer, the two I bought left me wishing it came in it's own six pack. I will definitely look forward to trying this again. I guess I forgot that Sam makes a decent brew and right now for $5.49 a six, a poor man has to take advantage!"
"TO likes TO some TO. Well, I like me some schwarzbier. This is a pretty good one."
"A damn tasty Schwarzbier! Nice to see a large craft brewer release such an unknown and uncommon beer style."
"After mostly stouts and porters that were dark as night, the first gulp was quite refreshing - nice and smooth in the mouth, like a lager should be, and imparting those general roasted dark flavors subtlely but effectively. It wasn't comlex and interesting, like a stout or a porter is, but instead it was, like I already said, refreshing and pleasant to drink. It went down easy, and for something other than ales at the end of the day, this was a goody."
"Doesn't really do anything for me, but this has never been one of my favorite styles. I'd drink it in a pinch, but it tastes like a macro-micro, like a Pete's or Saranac. Yeah, pass on this one."
"this one reminds me of the heineken and beck's ""dark"" that i would drink back in the day when i was just getting into beers that weren't bud. smell and flavor taste along the lines of a dark euro. from memory i would say that this beer is better than those that exploit this style the most. color is a very dark ruby if you hold it up to the light, head is nice. smell is of course roasted malts, hints of coffee and chocolate. taste is roasty and malty. so there you go, cheers."
"Pours a nice dense black color with a head of foam that disappears quickly. It has a chocolate malty smell that is very nice. It has a nice roasted chocolate taste that stays for a little bit. Overall this an excellent brew from Sam Adams that I would buy again."
"Pours with a three-finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Color is opaque and black. Medium bodied. Nose is roasted chocolate. Medium carbonation. Starts with a sweet roasted chocolate flavor, finish has just a hint of hops. One of the better offerings from Sam Adams. $1.85 for a 12 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Highly recommended to anyone who love roasted or even burnt malt flavors, but also enjoy something lighter and more drinkable than your typical darker beers."
"Way to go BBC! Nice brew."
"On a side note, my dad is not much of a beer snob at all - he'll buy whatever micro/import is on sale, but he doesn't really care too much what he is drinking. He has really taken to the Black Lager, to the point where he is seeking it out in six packs. So this beer could be a good opportunity for advocacy."
"The beer is dark reddish brown and almost black with nice lacing. The smell is of chocalate,caramel and light coffee with a roasted character, a sweet smell more like a stout. The caramel malts really come through in the taste section and a good bit of the roasted flavor towards the end, but finishes crisp and smooth. I don't really taste the hops, but the label says it's lightly hopped, so maybe the sweet malts are just to powerful for my taste buds. I found this beer to be refreshing and quite easy to drink, but maybe not completely true to the style."
"Very cool that Sam Adams took a run at such an obscure style... and they did a very nice job of it, too! Pours dark brown with a healthy tan head. Head has decent staying power and leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell is lightly roasty, with carmel and chocolate notes. Taste is initially sweet followed by the chocolate and carmel. Mild floral hop flavors... could maybe use a bit more hops. Has the smooth mouthfeel typical of a lager. A very drinkable beer!"
"Emminently drinkable beer- in the syle. Would work great with spicy food."
"Very well done, and a good effort by Sam Adams. I really enjoy the Schwarzbier style and this one is very enjoyable, if not spot on for style."
"Nice brew, a good show by SA"
"Not all their beers are mindblowing but Sam Adams beer are always extremely well crafted. It is appreciated."
"Pours a brownish-black color with a medium thin light tan head and thin lacing. Aroma of chocolate and coffee as well as a hint of nuts. Medium-bodied with a sweet malt and chocolate flavor. Trace amounts of coffee and hops are present too. The finish is smooth and dry but not too flavorful. As with many of Sam AdamsÂ’ one-offs, this is above average."
"Medium bodied with a slight creaminess and healthy carbonation. Quite an easily drinkable brew here...a six pack is a good party option. One of my new faves from Sam Adams."
"This seemed a little off style. It was much more body than I'd expect from a schwartzbier, coming across more as a lager stout than a schwarz. That said, it was a fairly interesting beer. The whole thing was roasted malt and it was quite assertive. It had a great head and perfect hue. My main complaint was it was just too heavy and not that drinkable. It'd be a perfect 4 oz sample."
"It was much lighter in flavor than I had desired. Mouthfeel was also somewhat thin. But easily drinkable."
"I found this to be very enjoyable...nose borders on a 4.5 as it is very nice with milk chocolate and caramel...body is medium...clean...good flavors...sweet milk chocolate...a little bit of camael...just a very fine noble hop finish...the more I drink this the more I like it....not my favorite style but I'd buy a sixer of this on occasion as a changeup..."
"Drinkability/notes: A decently crafted beer, a bit off-style, but still quite drinkable."
"I can't see this becoming a favorite style of mine, but I'd like to try more, as this was pretty good. It seems like for me, lately Sam Adams is hit or miss, and thankfully this one does the job."
"Overall Impression: Flawed. My review doesnÂ’t capture the off flavors. All I can say: artificial, burnt, wrong. Avoid."
"Nice and straightforward beer. Smooth milk chocolate malts and sweet caramel backdrop. A tad of biting hops on the finish, but the main flavors in this beer are the smooth malts. Solid drinkability level and another nice alternative to the Sam Adams Boston Lager. I paired this up with a spinach pizza and it worked very well together."
"This is a really solid beer all around. I heard it was a new product so I deicided to pick some up when I saw it at the store and I'm glad I did. Pours a very dark brown, almost black as the label suggests, but not opaque, you can deifnately see through the sides, a tint of red there too. Small head. Smell and taste are really spot on for the style, which I am newly getting accostomed to and liking a lot. I pick up a nice creamy milky character, nice burnt malts, and spicy dusty notes which I really love. Almost dirty smelling but in a good way. Really great smooth mouthfeel. I think I'll be adding this beer to the regular rotation. Go try it if you haven't yet."
"I have been anxiously awaiting to try this brew ever since reading about it in BA. Finally found it as part of a brewmasters collection six pack. Pours a beautiful mahogany brown (almost black) with a thin, dark tan head. Aroma is of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Taste is pretty much the same, it could use a little more hop bitterness however. An outstanding offering from the guys at Sam Adams! I wish there was more than two of them in the six."
"A short description would be a ""lagered porter", meaning it doesn't have the roundness of typical fare. Working from memory, this is a more flavorful schwarzbier than others I've had. Worthy of a six-pack."
"dark brown with a thinish tan head, that fades. toasted aroma with chocolate and a bit of coffee. clean chocolate and caramel sweetness, attempt at balance with a little toasted cofee, and a little hops. a little buttery in the back. gets a little more interesting as it warms. medium bodied but a little soda like in the mouth, but this doesn't detract too much. pretty drinkable and a good attempt by sam adams to attract their audience to something a little out of the ordinary."
"I've had a few bottles of this one out on the town, and also purchased a sixpack. I think this is the last of that, oh well. Pleasantly surprised by this one, I thought it was a pretty decent offering, especially by a US brewery of a style that not just anybody brews up on a regular basis. Pretty dark cola in color, but there's some nice reddish highlights in the bottom of my glass. Head when poured was like 1.2 inches thick, but has since died down to the top of the brew, very thin now. I think the aroma is the most 'authentic' aspect of this brew...it is right on as a German Schwartzbier. Rich malt, natural breadi/yeastiness that has a prescence, but isn't overwhelming. Tastewise, the first sip is really good, nice and malty. Seems to get a wee bit sweeter while drinking, but really an easy beer to turn into a session when you don't want to go overboard. Medium mouthfeel. I'd get it again."
"This beer pours a nice black color. Very dark, almost pitch black. It also has a great brown extra-frothy head topping off the glass. Smells of chocolate, molasses, maple syrup, and burnt toast tantalize my nose. The taste is very similar to the aroma, with hints of caramel malts and a load of coffee adding to the collection of intense flavors and scents. The taste also finishes clean with no lingering bad aftertaste. The mouthfeel is just shy of a heavy-bodied beer. It goes down very smooth. My glass was emptied much sooner than I expected. I am highly impressed by this beer, and I'm sure it will soon make its way in front of me again. CHEERS!"
"I'm excited to try this one. I've been enjoying schwarzbiers more lately. It pours a rubied dark-brown color wtih a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer generously. Its a touch light in color for my liking. The nose is robust, with a bit of roasted nuttyness and a very nice roasted maltyness, maybe a touch of coffee. The flavor is nice as well. Slight coffee, fairly healthy roasted nuttyness. Not a bad brew. The feel is moderate to full with a medium carbonation. I think I am going to have to grab a full 6 of this beer. I could be happy to drink this one often."
"Notes: Jim Koch did very well with this one simply an amazing beer very drinkable to get one through a cold winter night. Cheers"
"Clear and deep burgandy appearance. Thin cropping of bubbly tan foam. Lacing iis adequate. Nice tones of chocolate, roast, vanilla and caramel on the nose. Really solid nose. The flavors aren't quite as nice as I was expecting from the nose, but they are good. A nice combo platter of roasted bitterness, baker's chocolate and sweet caramel. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly. Body about medium. It's good to see another enjoyable schwarzbier on the shelves."
"Drinkability & Notes: Very drinkable, however, with the amount of sugariness, IÂ’d need to cut it with eating something, preferably desert. Although initially finishes clean, the last few drops lingered, leaving a sweet aftertaste. Not overly bad, but cuts back on its session beer qualities."
"Drinkability is good only my second of this style should have rated the first better but didn't know so at that time. This beer is fine little lager I would recommend you atleast try. Its nice to have a dark beer thats almost light and refreshing."
"Nice to see that Sam Adams can still make some goodies while still catering to the masses. Recommended."
"One hell of a beer."
"This brew poured to a very dark brown color, maybe even black in color with some light filtering through. It was poured with a fair sized light brown head that broke down quite quickly but left nice rings of lace down the entire brew. The aromas of this brew are nice; solid chocolate and roasted malt flavors that might even be leaning to a burnt smell. The taste is definitely of roasted malts along with a chocolate flavor that seems to me as being quite smooth. Also notice a nice slight hop taste at the end that goes very nice with this brew, think you could completely miss it unless you are looking for it. Over all I think this is a real good brew, will get some more as I feel that the taste of this will appeal to some of my less adventurous friends."
"This black beer poured a clear, dark, chestnut red-brown color with creamy, tan foam that persisted and clung to the glass a fair amount. The smell was dark malt with a bit of molasses. The taste was lightly sweet malt with a touch of molasses and caramel and a hint of yeast. Very low hop presence. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and modest carbonation. There was a mildly malty aftertaste. This was a pretty good schwarzbier, but perhaps just a tad too sweet."
"This pours into the pint glass a ruby black with a tan head about 1/2 inch high. Slight lacing. Aromatic toasty malty chocolatey nose...love the smell. Tastes malty sweet with chocolate notes and crisp like a lager (like I'm drinking a crisp stout). Little hop taste at all though some must be there to provide what little balance there is. Mouthfeel is creamy and sweet. Nice carbonic bite in the finish. The roasted maltiness is felt throughout. The only thing that keeps this from being a top notch session brew is the sweetness...that would start to wear on the palate after two beers."
"Some potential as a session beer. Very drinkable indeed."
"My first Schwarzbier, so I was not quite sure what to expect. Looking through the BJCP guidelines, I think Boston Beer CompanyÂ’s product meets all the requirements."
"Fairly strong, moderately sweet dark roasted malt aroma mixed in with some thick chocolate syrup. Dense, foamy, hazelnut colored head leaves a sheet of lace. Deep brown colored beer with a cola colored hue around the edges. Dark roasted and chocolate malt carries over into the mild flavor and mixes in with a bit of marshmallow. Dry roasted malt finish. Body is on the light side; mouthfeel is kind of a mix between soft and watery. Reminds me a bit of a dry stout; quite tasty."
"This is a solid offering from Sam. It was slightly fruitier than I expected, which didn't make it bad, it just made it more porter like. I'm glad to see Boston Beer continue to make seasonal brews, instead of just pushing Sam Light."
"I didn't know what to expect from this Schwarzbier style. But I had to try it and see exactly what was going on there. It was a nice black/amber huge, with a small light brown head with very little retention. But it presents itself well! Sweet smelling with chocolate and roasty smells. A nice grainy mouthfeel and nice chocolate and roasted malt taste with a hint of burnt wood. Very very impressed, I will definitely pick up a six pack again soon."
"Didn't know what to expect, but overall not a bad beer from ""micro-Sam"" Couldn't get Porter out of my head as I waited for the beer to settle, still kinda can't (by apperance). Chocolatey taste, then nothing, very hollow. This is the type of beer you won't mind having a couple of-basically just to get rid of. Not overly disappointing but will not buy again."
"Certainly drinakable. The Stout character is tempered by it's lager roots"
"Part of the Brewmasters pack I wish I could get the Scottish Ale again,anyways pours a near black but with some ruby highlights thru out some bitter chocolate deep roasted grain in the aromas just smells sweet.Taste of chocolate and sweet caramel with heavily roasted malt but the caramel sweetness almost becomes cloying after awhile.Wow SA wasnt playin around here making a real sweet scharzbier here would have like a little more drier balance liek others I have tried of the style,well to each there own."
"Included in the recent variety pack. Clear dark brown with mahogany highlights in bright light. Head levels out quickly, big bubbles help it fall in about 50 seconds. Laces minimally, fat strings on one side of the glass. Roasty aroma but not burnt, like a well done glazed pork roast, sweetened by a caramel impact. Medium mouthfeel but lively carbonation. Flavor is pleasant, balanced by dusty hop and a mild astringency, however malts win the day early with chocolate infused whole grains and caramelized sugar. Comes off as a drinkable brew to me, maybe a touch too sweet in early impression and aroma."
"D- definitely a unique style of beer. I expect a stout but it has a very smooth lager taste. It is a refreshing change from porters and stouts but I still enjoy those styles more frequently."
"This is a great beer. I bought a sample pack with Black Lager, Hefeweizen, and Boston Lager and this is by far the best of the bunch. Pours dark like a porter with a nice head. Malty in aroma and taste with a touch of caramel. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable. I think this would be a great ""transition beer"" (one going from a light pilsner or lager to a darker, fuller, more flavorful beer.) I definitely recommend this anyone."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" brown head above the very dark mahogany brew. Head fades holds its own, and lacing is good. Aroma is hearty dark malts, with a slight associated bitterness. Taste is just what the nose portended. Dark malt bitter aftertaste lurks in the mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasantly thin, but not too much, just right, and drinkability is excellent. Hope this one finds a permanent place in their lineup."
"I'm not much of a fan of SA's Boston Lager, but I did like this beer quite a bit."
"Roasty, malty, a little bit of smoke flavor in this nice and smooth lager. It has a light mouthfeel of a lager with a dark roasted malt color. Interesting experience since you expect a beer of this color to be heavy and full flavored. Lightly hopped and crisp. I would have enjoyed a more bitter character if the malts were a little darker roasted (i.e. black patent)."
"The body is light and glassy, as expected. This is one of SA's best brews. Let's hope this beer is successful."
"Pours a dark, ruby red color and has a thick tan head. The aroma is of chocolate and coffee... Definitely a lot of malt in here. The flavor is exceptionally balanced. There is no really overpowering flavor... a nice meld of the coffee tones from the roasted malt and a nice chocolate flavor as smooth as any fine chocolate beer, but balanced in a way that it does not become cloying at all. The label says it all when it comes to the finish... Smooth, spicy and very clean for all of the flavors going on here. I really like this beer and I hope it becomes a regular in the BBC lineup."
"I gotta say, it's a good beer. Could down a few of these at a time, it's light which belies it's taste and color, which I am aware isn't ALWAYS typical. Anyway, it is a delicious brew and one of the best Sam offers."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet sweet malt scent that boasts of chocolate and caramel malts and a lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has an extremely dry, dark malt flavor which is rich in pale, caramel, and chocolate malts. It goes down easy and finishes with an earthy dry lager yeast feel. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking Schwarzbier. I wish it wasn't so dry, but overall it's a fine offering."
"Drinkability - this is one of those rare beers that is best enjoyed in the bottle to keep those metallic odors bottled up. I really wanted to give a higher Taste score, but the smell dragged it down too much for me, affecting Drinkability as well. It is an otherwise delicious beer worth a sixer."
"Pours an almost-black, reddish brown with a thick head. Retention was pretty good, and there was excellent lacing. The smell is full of chocolate and coffee notes. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but it's smooth as silk despite the carbonation. The taste consists of chocolate and coffee elements that blend seamlessly into the slight bitterness in the finish. The bitterness is at a perfect level, countering the smooth sweetness of the beer without decreasing drinkability. This is a delicious, extremely drinkable beer that I could spend all night with."
"Very easy to drink, nice smooth finish and great flavors. I still stick to my stouts and bitters but not a bad alternative now and then."
"Served at cellar temperature. Deep chestnut color with ruby highlights and a fat, thick head of beige foam about a quarter inch high that hangs in there. Aroma is deep and rich - roasted malts, cocoa, leather and smoke. Flavor is roasty, with dark malts, chocolatey, not bitter, not sweet. No noticeable hop presence. Body is light, but mouthfeel is even, round, and full. Sheets of lacey legs slide down the sides of the glass. A pleasant surprise from ol' Sam."
"A dark brown/ black beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a Small dark beige. There is a deep roasted malt aroma with a coffee background. A prickely carbonation opens the way for the warm roasted malt flavor to cover your tongue. There is a coffee like bitterness on the finish."
"Good offernig, pick some up"
"This is an easy drinking, well balanced, malty beer. Although, I was looking for some more smoky flavor. I had to go to three different stores before I found it! Looks like it may be a new favorite for many people."
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this 'Brewmaster's Collection' offering. I give them credit for a solid attempt at a swarzbier, but I'll stick to Kostritzer for about $1.00 or so more a 6 pk. But not much tops Einbecker!"
"Overall, this one is a nice session brew that's packed with flavour and is hearty without moving outside of the style. Well done."
"Being new to the style, I was pleasantly surprised. For some reason I thought schwarzbiers were lighter bodied. This is definitely one I can come back to."
"This beer is the best of both worlds, it's a damn fine porter and a fine stout. The flavor is more like a good stout, but where the stout harshness would normaly begin the porter sweetness kicks in. This could become my normal stock of beer in the fridge."
"poured a dark brown, decent head that slowly diminished leaving a nice rich collar all the way through, hints of chocolate in the aroma, but not a very strong aroma, taste is of chocolate and coffee, fairly rich and pleasant, bit of sweetness, smooth and creamy, moderately carbonated, drinkability is good , I wanted to make my 100th review something special like St. Bernadus, but I wasn't able to get to that store tonight, and my eagerness to get my 100th review in, won out, so there it is, I hope I've learned a bit by now, well, this is a decent beer and worth a try. cheers!"
"Black in color, but reveales some dark brown, slightly red translucent. Big tan head, retention is not the best, but fades to leave a small creamy head with lots of foam sticking to the sides of the glass. Smell is very rich with toasted malt and strong chocolate and medium hops presence. Taste is very roasted and slightly carmel. No flavors are overwhelming and the sweetness stops just short of cloying. Maybe a little too much for a schwarzbier, but still not bad."
"Sam Adams is very good at introducing good new product. This is no exception. Pours a dark chocolate with a decent head and lacing. Smell is smoky malt with coffee undertones. Taste is lightly sweet with a slightly tart finish. Hint of chocolate is also present. Mouthfeel is very stout like, with a nice dry feel and great dry finish. Very easy on the drinkability scale..refreshing with that great dry finish."
"Pours a rich chocolate brown with a reasonable light khaki head. Aroma is of toffee and chocolate. Smells rich and creamy. Taste follows aroma. Nice rich toffee notes. Kinda like a subtle Heath Bar with chocolate and toffee notes. A little sweet and perhaps a little lacking in hops to balance, but seems to be on for the style. Mouthfeel is good with a decent amount of carbonation to balance out the sweetness. Drinkability is good, but I dont think I could do more than a couple due to the suiteness. A good solid brew from Sam Adams. I really wish they would but this in a 6 pack instead of the mixed six with the weak Hefe. My friend seems to think that SA got the idea for this when they were contract brewed at FX MATT and ripped off from Black Forest. This is much richer than that. Overall one of the better offerings from SA."
"This beer is a pleasant surprise and one that will always have a place in my ""usuals"" roster. Now if I can only find it in 6-packs..."
"Pours a pitch black color with a tan head. Great head retention. Sweet roasted malts, chocolate, and some coffee come out in the aroma. The taste was sweeter than I would prefere, but either way is was fine with me. Chocolate, carmel, and some hop flavor. Mabey the hops could have been stronger, but the bottle did say ""lightly hopped"". Had a medium kind of silky mouthfeel. I enjoyed this beer, and I would buy it agian."
"Nice to see SA continue to produce quality seasonals to go with their popular standards. Poured a dark brown, tinged with a bit of garnet, that looks nearly black when the glass is full. The head and lace were adequate. The taste was excellent, with an underlying sweetness balancing the dark malt flavors of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and a touch of coffee. A slight bitterness in the finish, which is covered well by this beer's distinctive feature, which is the pleasing length of the dark blend of roasted flavors."
"This lager has a nice dark cola color with a pretty decent tan head. The head collapses fairly quickly but laces the glass well. The smell is very inviting. The main scent is chocolate. The taste is also full of chocolate. Its not too sweet and not hoppy at all. The mouthfeel is very good. When I first poured it mouthfeel is where I was afraid it would disappoint but it did not. Drinkability is very good. This is a great beer to share with those people who are afraid of anything darker than MGD. It might open their eyes."
"As a style that I love for it's character as well as it's drinkability, this come up partially short. It has some flair and up-side, but it's limited by a heavyhanded, undying sweetness, and thus is a chore to drink in succession."
"Drinkability & Notes: I wish there was a bit more hop bitterness to this I tad too sweet for my liking, either way itÂ’s a delicious beer."
"Very decent schwarz! Sam Adams recent offerings (this, their Vienna Lager, and Holiday Porter, etc) have almost all very good, and excellent examples of their styles. The Boston Beer Company can certainly make a good beer when they try."
"Pours out a deep dark brown with a nice full tan headskie. Full roasty flavor with thin mouthfeel. Hop balance is there, but not perfect. This is a very decent lager worth checking out. It is so good to see Boston Beer Company checking out new styles."
"Part of the ""Brewmaster's Collection"" series in the winter 12 pk sampler. Pours an opaque brown/black with a thick and firm espresso colored head. Smell is mildly chocolate with a big wiff of coffee mixed in. Tastes quite malty a rich. Lots of roasted malt meets you in the front. Coffee switches to a slightly sweet caramel, that is shortly lived. Almost a little milk creaminess for a second, and then a long moderately bitter/dry finish. Carbonation is well felt and mouthfeel is medium like a porter. Decent brew. I could have two, but to be honest, if you told me it was a porter, I'd never know otherwise."
"I would certainly drink this again. Perhaps before their flagship brand, but after the Boston Ale. Its worth a shot, but if it is a porter you are looking for, get a porter. This will disappoint on that count. But definatly worth a try. Once again Sam Adams gives a good, solid if not spectacular effort."
