3.88,15.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Ah, Saranac. It's been over a year since I had one after moving from Ohio. Good college memories of hanging out in the Adirondacks drinking these. This one survived the journey west and is at least a year and a half old, however it doesn't seem much worse for the wear. This was from the winter seasonal pack I believe, and in typical Saranac fashion, the seasonals are of much higher quality than the standard fare. Easy drinking, that stays true to a somewhat rare style. A bargain for less than a buck a beer.","Bockrules","Dec 23, 2010"

It pours a clear, surprisingly light garnet-brown with about a finger (more or less) of light ecru foam. The nose is roasted (the whole damn thing, I'm tellin' ya!), with some accent lighting from some chocolate, soil, and floral hops. So far, not all that different from the other schwarzes (save maybe that asshole from "A Christmas Story"...). The taste doesn't deviate all that much, either, with notes of caramel, bitter dark chocolate, minor hoppy bitterness, and a tad bit o' greenery. The body is light, just an itsy-bitsy-teenie-weenie-yellow-polka-dotted bit lighter than it seems it should be, with active carbonation and a drier-than average finish. Still, this just kinda serves to make this brew a little easier to down than other schwarzes. Not bad, but not quite as good as that cute wittle bear...","TMoney2591","Apr 18, 2010"

The beer is very drinkable and a good example of a dark lager.","wilbrew","Feb 22, 2010"
3.22,-4.2,3,3.5,3,4,3,"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark copper color with barely a finger of tan head. The head quickly became a tiny collar that left thin, sliding lacing. The aroma was very grainy and full of dry chocolate malt, toasted malt, coffee and a little German malt. The flavors were an exact extrapolation of the aroma and distinctly European. But despite my repeated attempts to enjoy it I kept thinking it was sour, off or just plain awkward. I couldn't put my finger onit (it was trying so hard!) but it just kept letting me down. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. I give this one points for getting the style correct, but when I really boiled it all down it just wasn't enjoyable to drink!","thekevlarkid","Feb 22, 2010"

3.58,6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This beer poured a dark brown with some ruby highlights. The smell is some sweet lightly toasted malts with a bit of breadiness. The taste reflects the smell, with a tiny bit of hops in the finish. A surprisingly small amount of hops for Saranac. As a side effect, this beer ends up being quite a bit more drinkable than a lot of Saranac's offerings. Stylistically, this beer is almost exactly like their Black Forest, and in fact may be a rebranding of that one they've had forever.","TheTrevor","Jan 24, 2010"
3.27,-2.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark amber color with some red and browness about the edges as well. Has more than a finger of slightly tanned head that receeds sticking all about the glass. Aroma of hops and a bit of malt with a touch of some sulfur notes as well. Taste is a little roasty malt with some hops that leads in to a bitter crisp finish. Light feel and moderately carbed. All around not bad but again for a Schwarzbier it seems a little light in both the color and flavor. Still it is quite drinkable but it just seems like it is a little lacking in flavor.","stakem","Jan 21, 2010"

Nose was lightly cocoa-sweet. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a light cocoa sweetness on the tongue. The bottleneck mentioned "dark chocolaty flavor", but I did not feel it was all that. Chocolate, sure, but not dark chocolate. Finish was slightly malty-sweet with that chocolate malt taste, but it probably would not satiate any self-respecting chocolate lover's dream. Still, for the price, not bad.","woodychandler","Jan 15, 2010"

Flavor is very disappointing compared to the color. It is very drinkable but nothing I would go out of my way for. I expected more of a malt or coco flavor. Or maybe some dark fruity flavors.

Flavor has a slight tart sourdough edge to it creamy milk chocolate notes with herbal hops and harsh carbonation, that sour twang throws me off a bit. Mouthfeel is a bit acrid with a harsh tartness to the finish, light bodied sturdy carbonation. Drinkability is solid okay darker brew bring back the old formula.","WVbeergeek","Nov 19, 2009"

The aroma had a bit of hops and nuts but it was somewhat muted and not very enticing. The mouthfeel was not too bad...a bit on the high side of medium body with a honey like smooth texture. I found the flavor to be more sour and bitter than chocolately and coffee-like as marketed. This beer had some likeable aspects to it but it did not live up to its marketing campaign.

Luckily, I love me some black lagers so although this may be a clone basically, it's still enjoyable. I do like the black forest better, due to its hint of caramel and more roastiness in there, but this black lager is still solid with some decent roastiness.

Light roasted malt, grainy. Kind of a roasted macro though no rice/corn flavors. The feel is light with light carbonation. The feel hold ups, not watery, decent.

It seems as though they added chocolate malt only to a traditional lager. I guess it works. The taste is good. It's light, yet full of flavor. There is a dry, roasted character, but also a really sweet chocolate flavor in there as well. It's pretty damn quaffable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.
