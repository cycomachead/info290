"Best beer I had on oceania"
"Shit yeah coffee chocolate notes ash as well not bad"
""
"3.5/5 because it's a well made beer just lacking that extra something of a really great beer."
""
"Overall: a very nice dark beer from Monteith's. I headed into this one with a little trepidation, as Monteith's is a bit hit or miss. Well complex and easy drinking. Great for a price of AU$55 a case of 24 x 330mL also (2014)."

"the ice cold serving temp probably doesn't help its cause. just another brew that I won't remember down the road."

"Overall: No thanks. I didn't enjoy this at all, but am not sure if it is the beer or just the style, as I haven't had another Schwarzbier before. I think I can understand what it is trying to achieve, so I will try to find a better example of the style."

"A lot better than I thought it would be and could well be my highest scoring beer of this style so far."

"I cant believe i have not reviewed this ive had it plenty a time but to be honest its been a while and thought why not,it pours a dark ruby brown hue with a three finger creamy head that stays and leaves heaps of lacing,the smell is black coffee,caramel malts,herbal hops and dark chocolate,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and very sessionable and has tastes of dark belgian chocolate,caramel malts,herbal hops,cocoa and finished just like a black coffee bittersweet and overall i like what someone stated earlier Monteiths is just like Australias James Squire its above average and usually best option at a country/or lame pub but theres way better out there thats for sure cheers."

"O - Not a bad beer but lacks a little in complexity to really make you wanting more. A little disappointing in the finish."
"Food match: [Copy and paste from the 4 Pines Stout] rack of roasted meat (any dark meat), side of roasted vegetables and heavy gravy, or a nice warm stew. Dessert: dark chocolate. Follow with a glass of port."
"I expect a schwarzbier to be a little darker. The beer appeared black until the light hit it, and then it was a little too light, a little too brown. I got a good roasty smell from the beer, and the taste did not disappoint. More roasty goodness. The mouthfeel was OK. It's pretty easy to drink, I could have more without a problem."
""
""
"O/D - Not a bad schwarz but largely forgettable. Not a whole lot going on. Pretty average."
"Served a bit cold and with a smallish, light tan head plus some lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is malt, roast, dark ripe fruit, gravel. Flavor is like nose, more robust, plus carbonic tang, hint of coffee. Body is a shade thin, good carbonation. Finish is like flavor, on short side in length, and balanced. One of the better Montheith's I've had here."
""
""
"A light carbonation and lightly bodied considering the style."
""
"Thin mouth feel, low fizz and not much head. Smells of charcoal malts with a slight hint of vegemite. Low acidity and very clean on the palate for a dark beer, without much of an aftertaste. The flavour is fairly straight forward, with hints of caramel biscuit as it warms up. Very smooth, easy drinking."
""
"Poured a dark chocolate, almost black with a foamy head that left a fair bit of lacing down the glass. Smells of malt, coffee and chocolate. Tastes very much like it smells with the malt, coffee caramel and chocolate with a slight sarsparilla aftertaste. Not a very heavy on the mouth beer for what it is but still nice and smooth. Really enjoyed this and will seek it out again."
"O - A very drinkable dark beer. The first Monteith's Ive enjoyed this much. Good session beer."
"O: suprisingly good, i'd drink more of these. not a challenging dark beer for a beginner."
"Overall Impression- Since I'm not sure if I've had this style before, very easy drinking and nice! Roasty, flavorful German lager that ends up being one of my favorites of the month from an import. WIsh this was available in the states. Would like to enjoy another one."
"Could do with more carbonation."
"This beer poured out with a dark black body, the head was fluffy and ran colored. The smell of the beer was roasted and had some acidic aromas to it. The taste of the beer was like light burnt coffee with some nuts and a touch of hoppy bitterness to finish things off. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side and wasn't too bad. Overall it was a pretty typical black lager, not too much to rave about."
"O: Good malt character and fair balance. The acidic note and seeming masked hopping were drawbacks for me."
"I had this on draft at the brewery and bottle from store. Very nice flavor compared to other NZ beers but not great by US craft beer standards. Was my go to while in NZ. Malty and smooth, not a lot of hops in this at all, it's black, thick head on the pour but went away quickly and a light drinking beer."
"D - Good in places but bad in others"
"Dr: It's a good beer at a high price. Its ABV is moderately present in the taste, which is problematic. All around a beer worth trying."
"Good session beer from the Kiwis."
"Dr. Very good, but not great. Can't figure the off odor/taste that showed up a couple of times."
"D: This is an OK beer overall. The acidic finish keeps this beer from garnering a higher score."
"pours out a dark black beer. Shows light very faintly through with red tones. Tan head small and weak. Smells mostly of coffee ,slight smokiness in the background. Taste of coffee, much like a stout,,a dry beer, and has an astringent feel. Besides the astringency i like this beer. No mouthfeel to speak of. A very drinkable beer, slightly dry but not enough to make unpleasant"
"Bottle: Poured a light black color beer with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with light lactic sugar notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some roasted malt and light sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing earth shattering but well brewed and enjoyable."
"Overall - A very pleasant find this one... nothing groundbreaking but a well made and very quaffable example of a Schwarzbier.... worth a try..."
"Pours a deep dark near black with minimal cap of khaki head, little retention and lacing. Scent is dominated by roasted yet sweet malts with the faintest hints of earth, coffee, chocolate and fruit. Taste brings the same qualities of the scent, nothing overpowering but none of the ingredients evene stand out. Lighter side of medium bodied, smooth and lightly carbonated. A decent drinkable beer that does nothing wrong, but doesnt wow in any way. Heck, I really just wanted to try a bee rfrom New Zealand, so no loss."
"This isn't bad. It isn't very complex, but it is nicely brewed and smooth."
"Drinkability-A drinkable brew from Monteiths one of the better beers they brew and it's good beer for the price."
"Easy to drink, and a very nice example. Glad I picked this up."
"Not a bad stab at the style but you can do better. Worth a try but only if there aren't any other options available."
"My first Kiwi brew (and without kiwis no less...). It pours a translucent ruby-brown topped by over a finger of ecru foam, which leaves some decent lacing behind as it fades. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, and light florals. The taste holds notes of these elements, though instead of straight flowers, a light floral bitterness pervades. The body is a fairly light medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a solid schwarz. I hope I can get some more Kiwis if they're anything like this one."
"Overall: Overall the beer was enjoyable. I thought the flavor was very good with great notes of chocolate and roasted malts. Very drinkable, I would recommend most beer drinkers try this. It's a very easy drinking dark beer."
"Really drinkable, good take on the style, this held up well considering how far this had to travel to get down my neck. This one far exceeded my expectations!"
"Schwarzbier style- 5.2% abv. This poured a dark black brown, slightly clearish. It smelled of light roasted malt, some espresso and a touch of vanilla extract. It tasted light, with a good chariness to it, toasted malts and roasted espresso. It had decent drinkability because it was such a light drinking beer. Hands down, the only decent one that is passable for Montieth's if you have to go there- which I advise that you don't."
"taste is a little better than the nose...some flavor...very smooth but nothing amazing. nice creamy mouthfeel with a slight crispness making this drinkable and sessionable but not sure i'd want to get too bored. one of the lightest black beers i've ever had. a great beer for after mowing the lawn if you want refreshment and some flavor."
"D â€“ Nice enough brew."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of roasted malts with a touch of coffee. Taste is mild compared to the smell, again malts with a hint of coffee. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly decent beer."
"Fairly average schwarzbier. Pours a nice deep ruby brown with pretty good lacing. Aroma is mostly malty caramel with a touch more roast and a bit of nuttiness in the flavor. I guess if schwarzbier is your thing then you'll like this one. For me, it's all a tad thin and uninteresting and doesn't quite stand up to American and German versions."
"The palate opens roasty and smooth (it could use a little more roast). Toasted bread (burnt on one side?), light roasted coffee, a little cream mid-palate with some cocoa. Mildly nutty, especially towards the finish. Very clean, I can't pick out any off-flavors. Hops are light but present with a touch of bitterness. Medium light in body with a medium level of carbonation, this finishes great with some mild bitterness. While a touch watery mid-palate, this is a drinkable - and cheap - schwarzbier."
"Black, well deep brown in the glass with a nice head of tan foam. Subtle carbonation visible. Coffee roasted malt in the nose with a pleasant citrusy hop overtone. Initial taste is the same with a smoky, bitter aftertaste. The thinner body was refreshing. All well balanced and extremely smooth. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"A lighter style dark (which I normally don't like) but I think I could have a few of these and enjoy them all."
"Mouthfeel is accurately described on the label as ""never heavy in texture", but the label doesn't mentioned that that makes it a bit thin instead. There is enough body to elevate it above the 'watery' level though. Drinkable enough beer but not very hearty. All in all a bit blah."
"[1xBOA]"
"D - This is easy enough to drink. It goes down smoothly but lacks the interest and punch to make this a really drinkable beer."
"Funnily enough...it's black. A 2cm off white head that laced pretty well. Soft coffee notes among the roasted malt. A little sweetness on the palate with some biscuit and tidy bitterness. A very easy drink on these chilly nights. Worth buying but not hunting for."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkablity-Very drinkable for a dark beer and a great option for those who want flavor in their beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium, creamy & full bodied, with a soft but alive carbonation. This was a very easy drinker & a six pack is on the cards next time (only tasted tested 1 stubby this time)"
"I thought this was a stout before posting my review here. Still, it is a better than average beer, good value (like all the Montheith's range), plenty of flavour, not too heavy and quite easy to drink. Not much wrong here, thumbs up from me! I'd choose this over a Guinness Draught (yes, even on-tap!)any day!"
"D - Probably the most interesting beer from Monteiths that I've had. A good alternative to the heavy stouts and porters that I love so much. All the flavour without the bloated feeling."
"A nice deep coffee/coke colour with little head or lacing. I got hardly any aroma from this except a faint coffee malt note. Flavour is great and full of coffee, dark chocolate and malt. Quite sweet but very well balanced. A bit like treacle in flavour too but for a full bodied schwarzbier not sticky. This makes it more drinkable than some schwarz I've had even though the flavour is more restrained. I had this beer years ago and loved it. Now that I can get it easily I think it will be a regular. It's cheaper than the German gear and unlike those (which I love a lot) I can drink a few Monteith's without being overwhelmed by their bigger flavour. This is the best Monteith I've had so far."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with a fair amount of tan head that fades away pretty quickly. Smells of sweet roast malt and a little coffee, very pleasant. Tastes drier than the smell led me to believe. It's sweeter than average, but most of the flavor is just roastiness. Not much in the way of hops or bitterness but that would be too much I think. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy. A little harsh on the tip of the tongue, with light carbonation all over. All in all, it's very drinkable, fairly well balanced, nothing is really overpowering. I like it, I'll probably get it again."
"Poured a pitch black color with a nice looking white head that stayed pretty constant until the end of the brew. Aromas of mild iced coffee and chicory permeate the beer, not half bad. Taste was rather chocolaty with some soy sauce characters in there as well. It was also much more hoppy then I had anticipated. Mouthfeel is light to medium, more on the medium side if you ask me. I could see myself having a few of these, not bad at all. I like the fact that it shares some qualities with porter while at the same time being so different. Cheers"
"A very easy drinking beer which fits the scwarzbier style well."
"I dig this beer. Its not very complex and is lacking in some areas, but for a readily avaliable drop this is a good soild tight dark beer. Get into it."
"im not used to pairing beer with food, but this would have to go pretty good with dessert."
"this is a dark beer you can drink cold, or warming up. in winter or summer, and with many different kinds of food. its just so subtle, and for me thats where the charm is. not to mention it can always be got for a reasonable price. and in that regard, adding to everything else i have said about its standard, montieths black is pretty close to my favorite session beer as far as dark ales go."
"Once again with Monteith's beers, the head dies really fast, inoffensive, bland, slightly hoppy, a bit burnt, slightly artificial with some chemicals present, I would drink this again, only for the fact that i bought a 6 pack."
"A slightly above average schwarzbier, burnt roastiness on the finish, thinnish body, bit of brown sugar flavour in there which i didn't particularly like, but a nice enough brew."
