3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, light char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, light char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Minimal roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig light char, and roast/yeast earthiness. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is a nice Schwarzbier style. All around good complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to drink. A fair bit fruity in the nose and taste, but not by an overwhelming amount. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 13, 2014"

I was enjoying it initially with the darker, roasted malts starting things off but these flavours disappeared far too quickly for my liking and the beer just seemed ordinary and plain by the end. Definitely better than Xingu Gold but not a beer to buy on it’s own right.","flyingpig","Sep 28, 2014"

3.5,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"this is better than people give it credit for being. a boldly flavored and intensely roasty black beer, but light on the palate, almost even thin in body, and quicker finishing for the style. its got an almost lagered yeast character to it, and a pretty solid off white head. its clearish beer too, which is cool, different, and welcoming. its a lower abv beer which makes it drinkable, and i think it fits in all seasons. i get a dried fruit thing here, not raisin but something like it, even prune or plum in the taste before the burning malt takes over. carbonation is great from the tap, although i have had less impressive bottle experiences. i think its one of the more underrated beers in the style, and if i was actually in brazil, this would be far better than almost anything else on offer. the whole thing is impressive if you take in it context, of course its a letdown against the schwarzbiers of old world germany, but its not that far off.","StonedTrippin","Sep 22, 2014"

It's really not bad at all- as long as you aren't looking for intense flavors or a stout -like experience. It is somewhat thin and somewhat simple, but its redeeming features are its subtle roastiness, and especially, its slightly nutty graininess/grassiness (reminds me of wild rice) that adds an interesting note. Pleasant enough once in a while.","Georgiabeer","Jan 08, 2014"

Taste was a redeeming factor, as it was not too bad. Had some rich flavor of chocolate and dark malt. Pleasantly surprised here. But the mouthfeel was another area that could improve. It was smooth and enjoyable, but had a somewhat slick aftertaste that I couldn't overlook.

Even the white bits was black! I may get an Ace of Spades tattooed on my shoulder, or one of my ass cheeks, or better, on the inside of my thigh to let people know how I roll. Time for some accompanying music - you guessed it, Motorhead and ""The Ace of Spades"". Nose had a slightly grassy hoppiness and a slight malty sweetness.

The nose comprises caramel, light candi sugar, and very light cocoa powder, all of which come in sorta faintly. The taste holds notes of caramel, toffee, cocoa, mineral water, and a touch of sweet flowers that keeps everything from coming up too malty for its own good.

Literally tastes like it was made with Sweet-n-Lo and facewash. At first I thought the most objectionable aspect to this beer was the unrelenting syrupiness but now I'm thinking it has to be the gross finish. Total NSAID bomb.","illidurit","Jan 27, 2011"

Slight roasted character, but only once it warmed. Sweet and malty flavour, some caramel and brown sugar, slight nuttiness, grainy. Bitterness was muted, but served to somewhat balance the malt character. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture. For a malt forward beer, this works for me.

It tasts very thin, very light, and very sweet on the exhale. I'd call it a plum taste, or a ""datey"" perhaps. Definitley worth a try.

There doesn't appear to be any freshness date so I can't tell how old this beer is but based on the fact that it came from Brazil all the way up to me in Decatur IL, I'm guessing it wasn't brewed last week. The taste is more of the same with the sweet and grainy malt coming out with a more definite skunkiness. The only clue that this beer isn't a pale euro lager is the finish is a bit dryer.

Rather, when the glass is raised and tasted, there is a wonderful smoothness about the beer that is like drinking black silk. Not sweet, but flavorful; not complex, but highly drinkable. And with a reasonable ABV, it was like a ""perfect storm"" of drinkability for me. Fanstastic. And to think I passed on this offering from Brazil so many times in the store. Rich malt, with just a tiny bit of bitterness in the aftertaste to keep the tastebuds wanting more. Fortunately, I have two more bottles. Then I'll have to head to the store for more.

Noble hops give it a good mouthfeel... carbonated spicy feeling. Yeah I could see how someone might find this sorta like cola but I don't find anything coffee-like in here (I hate coffee). It really isn't a strong beer in any sense. Well I like malty beers and enjoy this flavor, but its almost like a watered down bock. Not overwhelming.

It actually smelled a bit like dark wine. The taste was very similar, in that it didnt taste like it appeared. Light grape wine flavor, along with a detectable hop presence. Simple and smooth. Very clean mouthfeel. For a lighter beer, this is very drinkable. Overall, not a bad beer, and one that I would try again.

It tastes a bit sour, and also a little like sweet malt and grain. Not impressive at all. Mouthfeel is light/medium, with good carbonation.

It was the only bottled option besides Antarctica available in singles at the loncheria down the street from our hotel in Curitiba. Then I discovered Bohemia Escura at the supermarket on the other side of the park, and left off Xingu until now, two years later in Buffalo, NY, where this is the only Brazilian beer available (in fact, I think that this might be the only Brazilian beer imported to the U.S. -- somebody please correct me if I'm wrong!). If memory serves (which it might not), the non-export (i.e. domestic Brazilian) bottle looks slightly different -- that is, aside from not having any English text on it -- but I can't remember exactly how. More elaborate, maybe. Anyhow -- after twisting it open, Xingu pours dark brown with bright garnet highligts and a creamy meringued khaki head. The nose is subtle, with sourish malts and a leafy-earthy hop presence, almost like an English porter. Certainly sweeter than any other Schwarzbier I've ever tasted, but I do remember this being maltier when I tried it in Brazil, almost like an alcoholic Malta Goya. There are vinous notes, prune juice and a spicy hop ballast to temper the sweet flavors. Sticky rings of lacing appear. Noticeable metallic aftertaste. Medium body, certainly far from heavy, and the mouthfeel is a bit chalky and dry, chewy in some places. Moderately drinkable. I really don't think this is a Schwarzbier, but perhaps I'm wrong and this is just a very liberal take on the style. With that in mind, it seems to be more of a singular creation; interesting, novel, and really not too bad overall. Saude!","orfeu","Jun 03, 2006"

Maybe the malt was charred, but it's hard to tell through the brawny sweet caramel flavor. To steal a phrase from Charlie Papazian, this is a ""constant crescendo"" beer, which makes me think ""not terribly drinkable."" Brazilians and Argentinians do eat a lot of meat, and this is a meat-eater's beer. I guess I'd drink it if I were eating some sort of juicy, over-sauced beef.","ecoboy","Mar 05, 2003"
3.36,-3.2,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This was once available in my area, and I visited it often in the dawn of my beer exploration. I thought it exotic then, with the label and locale, but forgot that it is rather rudimentary. I thank Uglyradio, for the reunion.","feloniousmonk","Jan 10, 2003"
4.06,17,5,4,4,4,4,"I've had this in both the small 12oz bottle and the larger black 1.5l bottles, which taste the same but damn that big bottle was cool. This is a fine example of a good drinking schwarzbier -- not heavy or chewy like a porter or stout, but flavorful and rich nonetheless. My second (or third) of these started to taste a bit flat, but maybe my tongue was simply going numb.","suglis","Dec 21, 2002"
3.38,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The beer pours a nubilous blackberry red; the head is moderate in size, creamy, light chocolate brown, the lace glutinous and long lasting. Nose is malt, sweet, molasses and coffee like tones also noticed. Front is overbearingly sweet, the top has a light mouth feel, the finish is unsubstantially hopped, very light carbonation, the aftertaste malt and quite dry. ""Cadaverous", which sums it up for me.","Gusler","Nov 16, 2002"
4.08,17.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This rare find is one that is so unique that I can only compare to that of a brazilian beauty. The dark chocolate roasts are present along with a nut flavor that makes this beer so smooth and refreshing. The best way to characterize this beer is that it has the body of a porter with the taste of a nice oatmeal stout. As my warm hand slowly grasped the sweaty bottle of Xingu, I inquisitively peered at the mysterious Brazilian brew. Pouring its contents into my pint glass, I cautiously approached the mouth of my pint glass as if I was standing at the mouth of the Amazon River. I was now ready to let my tongue dance the samba with this dark beer that provided a copious amount of intrigue to its tasters. Like a fine Brazilian beauty, Xingus dark body was sensual and satisfying to the eyes and the tastes buds. A smooth dark roasted malt flavor finishes the flavor of this beer to create pure enjoyment.","WVbeergeek","Oct 14, 2002"
3.8,9.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a beautiful beer...extremely black with a tan (almost brown) head that leaves a thin trail of lace. There's a grainy, almost smoky aroma with hints of dark fruit. The taste is of roasted malts. Somewhat sweet, and a big, soft mouthfeel...finish does dry out, and becomes grainy, with maybe a little tannin. It's an interesting and unique beer.","Suds","Sep 22, 2002"
3.03,-12.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"The label says ""Black Beer"" so I have to go with the Schwarzbier tag. Nice pour, black with a tan head that starts off well but fades to a thin collar. Interesting first taste, sweet, almost grape like, no hops to talk about. I could not distinguish the malts, a slight creamy smoke taste, but no big finish as the beer looks like it should have. It was talked up so much at my local pub, I had to try. Not impressed.","HopheadEd","Sep 22, 2002"
3.88,11.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Wow! I got far more than I bargained for with this one. First off, there's not a shot in hell that this is a German-style Schwarzbier... but, on the other hand, I don't know what category it should be put in either. It's hazy (bottle conditioned), and brown/black in color. It pours a good size orangish-tan head that holds very well and leaves some lace. It offers a bold aroma of dark dried fruit with prune, plum, cherry (with pits) and some nuttiness as well. It's medium to full bodied with a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is fruity and sweetly malty, with some chocolate, dark sugar, a light acidic sharpness, and a somewhat woody character. It finishes semi-dry with lingering fruit & malt notes as well as a gentle touch of soft licorice. Very odd, but enjoyable. Intriguing. A style apart.","NeroFiddled","Aug 23, 2002"
3.48,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,2,4,"Very dark, no light coming through at all. Tan head that leaves nice lace. Smell is malty with a bit of licorice. Roasted flavor with some chocolate, licorice, and molasses. A little too watery, which takes away some of the taste. Mouthfeel is thin and light. Dry finish and little hop presence. A very different beer. Tastes good as it warms too. Nice as a change of pace.","Lupe","Aug 14, 2002"

3.09,-11,4.5,3,3,3,3,"A lovely black with thin tan head that dissipated quickly.  The aroma was highly malt with sort of a off/hay smell that I did not care for.  The taste was more of the same-not good.  The mouthfeel was thin, and watery and the flavor was gone before I knew it.  I was let down on this one as schwarzbier is my favorite style.  I will revisit again sometime and give it another chance, but for now it is poor.","ryanocerus","Jul 11, 2002"
3.9,12.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This ebony beauty pours with a fantastic mocha colored head that just refuses to settle down. Once it does, it's on top of a nearly opaque dark red/black brew. Nose is coffeeish, roasted barley...very stout-like. Taste is bittersweet, a bit thin bodied, with minimal bitterness present. Finishes up a bit sweet, with notes of roasted malts. A great beer in the robust porter/stout/black lager style, try it!","beerluvr","Jul 01, 2002"
4.23,21.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer was a pleasant surprise.  A nearly-black colour with a enourmous, brown, foamy, chunky, sticky head that lasts throughout and leaves big, ugly rings.  Billowing sweet-malt scent fills the nose. A big toasty malt-sweetness with very little bitterness, but balanced flavour.  Nice, slick, deep medium body with slight bite on the tongue.  One beer drank real smooth, two would probably be a treat but any more would wear on you.  Try one out and enjoy, the Schwarzbier style is great.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jun 16, 2002"
3.35,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Cool packaging.  Nice dark tan head that lasts.  Aroma of molasses and burnt malts.  Flavor is a little weird.  Heavy on the dark malts but finishes quick, clean, dry and very light bodied.  There's an acicity that borders on sour.  Worth a try, but I won't go back.","pbrian","Mar 11, 2002"
4.09,17.9,5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Sweet molasses up front, then coffee bean and alcohol notes intermix. The finish softly lingers as a charcoal bitterness.  Pleasant but subdued aromas of coffee and sweet molasses.  Unfortunately this brew lacks a heavier body to support the fullest of flavor.  The flavor is excellent, however it is short lived.  Prost!","Jordan","Beers"
4.53,30.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Coal-black with a thin, tight-bubbled tan head. Deep malt nose. Peeking it's head from behind a profoundly roasted barley flavor is a lurking sweetness. A complex and tasty brew from our southern neighbors. Body on the light side is characteristic of the style. This won't be the last time I enjoy a Xingu.","inebrius","0"

4.66,34.3,5,4,5,4,5,"Brewed in Brazil, this is a very interesting beer.  A black beer, the body was intentionally light but still had a lot of roasted caramel/molasses flavor, and yet was not too sweet.  Sort of a ""lite stout.""  Worth a try for both porter and stout fans.","Brent","0"
