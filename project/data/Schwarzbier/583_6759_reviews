"Overall this is a good, refreshing summertime/session lager."
"Nice color with slight clarity. Dense creamy head with good lace. Clean aroma and flavor with just a hint of roasted malt and cooked corn. Light bodied. Average carbonation. Highly sessionable. A little boring in my book but I could drink several of these in one sitting."

"12 oz can in a basic pint glass. The brew pours a dark chestnut brown, quite hazy, with tan head and lacing. I don't get much in the way of smell, maybe a slightly caramel flavor, but that is to be expected with a lager. The mouthfeel is bright and bubbly, and light-to-medium bodied. The initial taste is nutty, bitter, with some toast. There's not much in the way of aftertaste. At 5%, this is highly drinkable. Overall I enjoy this and would buy again."

"In finishing I think the beer is much better in glass after it's warmed...much smoother with it's sweetness cutting some of it's bitterness. My review will be as drank from a can...good not great. A few changes to the recipe and bottled and this black lager could be great."

"Overall, this is far from being a bad beer. It's clean, it has all the right flavors and aromas with nothing standing out where it shouldn't. No off flavors that I could detect. It just seems a bit shy, like a wallflower at the homecoming dance. The biggest complaint against this beer is not about what it is, but what it could easily be. It's a solid ""almost"" brew, and one I'd almost grab off the shelf again."
"O: Still a really enjoyable beer to drink, this isn't available locally but would probably be a go to session beer, easy to drink from the can and tasty, if it was"

"The Crack was loud and inspiring, so I employed an inverted Glug into my Schlafly CAN Sessions CAN-shaped glass. I had two fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. Color was garnet (?)/ruby (?) (SRM = > 34, < 44) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled very chocolaty and I was ready for some beer to hit me. Mouthfeel was big and full and the taste was both caramel and chocolate and I was really digging it. I ate some spicy curried chicken for lunch and this was a welcome respite from the heat. Finish was smoky, chocolaty and caramel. This was more in line with what I expect from Schlafly and I wish that I had another for the upcoming Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually). Man, I really dig drinking well-made lagers when there are so many crappy ones on the market."

"just short of black, extremely dark brown. very white creamy thick head. great retention and lacing. not much aroma. nice smooth flavors in the taste - just a touch of roast and some sweetness, some faint mild chocolate. thicker mouthfeel, slick, moderate carbonation. Easy drinkin' ."
"Another canned beer from the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is damn near non existent. The faintest notes of malts. Taste is light, mild, some roasted malts, really not much going on. Feels light in the mouth and overall nothing special about this beer, mediocre at best."
"With the likeness of stout-like char upon a body of Lager, Schlafly's Black Lager is easy drinking and characterful but without the challenge of highly complex flavors or high alcohol rates. It's ideal for barbecue and chocolate desserts."

"Overall, a very drinkable brew. No wonder they canned it and made it part of their Can Sessions lineup."

"The black lager introduces a strong roasted and smokey flavor to the wheat taste of a basic lager. It can best be described as an alcoholic iced coffee with a little wheat to it. I personally love it, but it wasn't released in 2012. In 2013 Schlafly released a canned version which i'll review separately after i've given it a try."
"Overall, not as roasty as I had hoped. It's pretty sweet for the style and lacks complexity of the malt character."
"M - Thin mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Feels for the most part like a lager, but the hops were a little aggressive and took away some of the smoothness that I normally look for in a good lager."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 12/9/2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mahogany brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Both the head retention and lacing are decent enough. The brew smells like roasted and bready malt, coffee, nuts and some chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some caramel and a bit of an earthy flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and goes down easy. I think it's a solid brew overall. I'd buy this one again, hopefully a fresher bottle next time around. Still, even now it's worth a try at $1.75 for a single bottle. Purchased at Party Town, Florence, KY."
"Not a complex beer but tasty."
"Overall: B"

"O: It's a very drinkable beer, I'd stick with the APA but for something different pick it up and try it. It's much better than a standard lager."
"It doesn't take much to drink it swiftly; And the flavor doesn't take much getting used to, because there is none. This beer is paltry to a beer advocate. The only application I can think of is someone who enjoys bland lagers, but wants to be seen drinking something ""heavier""."
"Overall, quite a tasty Schwarz. Everything I'd expect- clean, dark and quenching- but it's that persistent pecan note really making this delicious."

"O: Very enjoyable offering. Not an overpowering beer, but still a beer with lots of character compared to other of this style I have tried. Well worth checking out."
"Overall, this beer is true to style and pretty authentic. It's a pretty good beer."
"Overall a thin and somewhat unbalanced beer for this style. Looks great, but doesn't taste amazing."
"The mouthfeel is above average for the style. It is light like a lager should be. It's a wet, sweet beer but it isn't too slick like poor lagers can be. Overall, this is a pretty average schwarzbier. Apart from the appearance, Schlalfy made a faithful rendition of the style. Merely being faithful doesn't make this a good beer, but it certainly isn't a bad one."
"O: This is a quality schwarzbier. Schlafly continues to impress me."
""
"Overall Impression- While having this many times before, once again, great! Would enjoy many more to come! This is one of my favorites from Schlafly this month and will be going back to this. Would recommend grabbing a 6-pack of this because your friends will also enjoy this smooth, easy going black bier. Enjoy!"
"Good take on the style, easy to drink. As usual these guys do a good beer at a nice price"

"Overall- I was expecting this one to be a little more hoppy, but the malts taste great and the feel makes for a great drink. The nose does all right, but it could have more to offer. Try it if you see it."

"Overall I am pretty impressed with this Lager. Light enough to drink a few, but flavorful enough to bring satisfaction. I recommend it."
"Medium body with a lightly roasty aftertaste. I'm glad I bought a sixer of this one."
"O - This is a very solid schwarzbier. Schlafly is so consistently good with everything they brew."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, yeast, pale malt, slight chocolate, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight hops, slight chocolate, hint of pale malt, and a hint of yeast. Overall, great appearance, good blend, body, and aroma."
"Pours deep brown with tan head. Aroma was mostly malts. Malty flavors with some caramel and coffee and some fruity esters. Low carbonation Medium/thinnish body and nearly watery mouthfeel hurt by low carbonation, its finish somewhat bitter (less from hops and more from black patent or dark roast malts) but clean and palate clearing lager nevertheless. I found it very refreashing."
"Guess I sampled the late 2004 batch. I liked the pour, deep brown with good lite brown head that left small laces. It had that black beer aroma to it, earthy, grainy  just a hint of malt. Taste was very good, low carbonation with almost no hop kick. Nice lite to medium texture thoughout the pint. Could drink many of these  if the Taproom didnt offer so many other enticing libations."
"The nose is of light malt and not much else. There is no strong sense of roasting or other delightful dark beer taste. The feel is light and finishes thin, but not lifeless. It is not so much that this is bad beer, but rather that this is just so average."
"Dark brownish almost black in color, nice wispy brown head that leaves a good lacing, faint roasted coffee malt aroma, thin and watery mouthfeel, decent roasted malty flavors, light bodied with just not enough carbonation, it has a nice roasty bitter finish, pretty average for the style."
"Pours a deep, clear reddish-brown with a light tan head with good retention. The aroma is all malt, with hints of coffee and caramel. Starts off with a bit of malt sweetness and roasted grains, then opens up to a smooth caramel/coffee/smoke balance. Ends with a slight earthiness, along with a touch of roasted grain bitterness and toasted malt. Thin-to-medium in body, with a mildly acidic finish that adds to it's clean and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, a solid schwarzbier."
"Schwarzbier is not a style I have a lot of experience with, however this one definitely seemed to be inconsistent with the style, other than the color.  That being said, it was a pleasant quaff, but I only had a single pint, before I returned to the excellence of their cask-conditioned pale ale."
