"I'm conflicted, there are a lot of stout (going to porter) elements, with a lager body, but it fits nicely, it makes a ""fresher", more sessionable dark beer"

"Bottle: Poured a deep black color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of dry roasted malt with light bitter notes. Taste is an easily drinkable mix of dry roasted malt with light dry bitter notes. Finish is lightly sweet. Body is light with good carbonation. Not bad though a bit more simplistic then I had anticipated."
"O - Good beer, price wise it wasn't too bad compared to some other beers here in Sweden. Wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"M&O: refreshing on the palate while being only moderately carbonated, medium-bodied against a truly decent flavour profile, this “idiosyncratic black lager” comes across as a fairly successful product by Brewdog, which is not that renowned for its lager bier making. Very likable and very… mixed. Definitely not fitting in with the classic “schwarzbier”, though, IMO."

"Medium to full body with light carbonation with small bubbles."

"This is one of my all time favorite beers. I first tried it two years ago when I was beginning to become a beer connoisseur. Just absolute magic. The flavor is complex and the color is beautiful. Zeitgeist translates to ""The defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time."" This beer is my defining spirit!"

"As has been mentioned before, decent but pricey on this side of the Atlantic."

"Dr: Average ABV, wonderful quality, an extraordinary mouthfeel, and an obscenely high price (per Brewdog tradition). Worth trying once, but not as special as Brewdog's gimmicky marketing would like to have you believe."

"Nice - I like this one. Easy drinking, but possesses more bitterness and roasted malt than most dark lagers. Well balanced. The only downside is the watery mouthfeel; it could be more substantial. A solid brew - worth sampling."
"Overall, this is a really nice beer! I'll have to see if I can get some more!"
"dark, rich looking dark brown with a small one inch head of off white that capped the top of the glass very, very nicely before it settled down leaving with it some nice lacing up and down the sides of the glass that seemed to really thicken up and push through as the time went on. Aroma is smoked malts right off the top. Dark, evil, with hints of campfire, peat, dark roasted chocolate and a good bit of almost a licorice touch to it. As I take the first sip a rich and creamy feel overloads the senses. Wonderful and rich, dark and foreboding, it seems that it is just meant to be evil and dark. Loads of roasted and smoked malts just rolling across the tongue. Lightly dry finish leaves just enough room for a small amount of smoky flavor to pop its head in"
"Medium bodied with light carbonation. I thought it was a little syrupy, but not overly so. Goes down smooth. Pretty sweet for the style. I would have it again, but it's not the best schwarzbier that I've had."
"If it was available locally I would certainly buy a few."
"One of the better beers I've had within this style, not as watery as most and with a deeper depth of body."
"O: Interesting black lager with good flavor and mouthfeel. Would definitely drink again. Enjoyed it."

"This was the first beer I had on tap at the Bethlehem Speakeasy back in late 2009. The beer was poured out as deep dark looking brew with a big fluffy tan colored head. The smell of the beer was of Chocolate and roasted malts. It smells pretty typical of a Stout or Porter more so than a Schwarzbier. The taste of the beer had most of the same things going on that were on the nose. The mouthfeel was smooth and had a light carbonation to it. Overall I found this to be a really good brew that was sure to be a good memory for years to come."
"A solid Black Lager. It is strong in all the main areas and provides a very flavoursome yet crisp taste. Would be great as a session beer or savoured on its own."
"D - Quite a nice one, balances between a light body and deep taste that would work well as a session or by itself."
"It's an OK beer."
"Beer pours a deep dark brown, very close to black, with a soapy tan head that leaves nice lacing around the glass. Smell is biscuity malt with a slight tinge of roastiness present, but i would prefer to get a little more in the smell...fairly one dimensional and thin in the nose. Taste is a decent roasted malt with a little bit of bittering hop presence. Again, the taste is a little thinner than i would like. I would prefer a little more toasted flavor here. Beer is veer drinkable and goes down smooth. I could put a few of these down but likely wont revisit at the price point when i can find more readily available US versions of the style."
"The beer pours a dark brownish-red color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the toasted malt with some toffee and grass notes. The flavor is toffee, coffee and roasted malt. Overall, the beer smells and tastes about like I think a schwarzbier should taste like. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the better BrewDog beers I have tried."
"D: Smooth and drinkable once you get past the initial hit of sweetness."
"Maybe not a classical schwarz, but easily drinkable and definitely pleasant."
"Very nice beer, clear and clean, but with a robust dark character to add a deal of interest. I like it."
"D: A very good beer. I like the bottle, I like the marketing, I like the beer. Interesting, appealing, and very consumable. I wouldn't mind knocking back a few of these. As schwarzbiers go, this is the top of the class."
"O: Nice to drink, but not a personal favorite of style."
"330 ml bottle, best before 6/21/2011 (USA). Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a dark brown/black color with about a half inch cola-like tan head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but stronger, with a good roasty flavor and a bit of smoke. However, there's also a chalky flavor that I don't exactly care for. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it seems a bit thin, and it's well carbonated. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and not hard to drink. Overall I think it's a decent brew."
"Not the most subtle, but then it is Brewdog. The aggressive end of schwarz, good for pounding porter flavors if that's your thing."
"D - Overall, pleasantly surprised by this offering, but my expectations were rather low. I wasn't a fan of their Hardcore IPA, so was half expecting a disappointment. Quite light and drinkable, the flavours were noticeable, yet not overpowering. Recommended to anyone who's seeking a dark lager with a lighter twist."
"Not bad at all, rather much flavor and good balance."
"330 ml bottle, bought at Systembolaget, Sweden. ABV is 4.9%. Black colour, dark brown in the highlights. Moderate beige head. Very nice roasty aroma with notes of chocolate and coffee, hints of liquorice. Fresh mouthfeel with hints of fruity acidity. The flavour is roasty with notes of coffee, fairly dry. A pronounced roasty and hoppy bitterness in the finish."
"I know when I think of the term ""zeitgeist", I think of goth sheep. At least I think that's what's depicted on the bottle... If only I'd had the bottle to look at while sampling this brew... It pours a very dark, though still clear, garnet brown topped by a finger of tan foam. Schwarzbier all the way so far. The decline of this dark (and apparently self-aware) civilization begins in the nose: floral hops, dry dark coffee, dark wheat, and an obvious note of chalk. It is this chalkiness that will serve as the dagger that eventually brings this brew down. The other elements of the nose reprise their roles for their debut on the tongue, though the coffee is heavily watered-down. Some dark chocolate powder makes a cameo appearance, but it makes the most of its few lines, inciting a riotous laughter that elicits praise from the critics in attendance. Unfortunately, it couldn't make up for the absolutely hammy performance of the chalk, whose scenery-chewing and over-the-top ""emoting"" (think some of the stinkier performances from MST3K films) drag the whole production into the crapper. Had Bialystock (...that's how his name was spelled, right?...) and Bloom had produced this script, their scheme would have gone off hitchless. Thankfully the body is light, as is the carbonation; otherwise the whole thing would be abysmal. Instead, it's just kinda bad. Big letdown from the boys from Scotland."
"Beer is medium body and the smoke that was the star of the aroma is kind of subdued on the palate. Its quite a good schwarzbier. Its mildly smokey, dark, medium bodied, clean finish without an aftertaste. Nice balanced malt presence. Very nice."
"Price is a deterrent, otherwise a decnt Swartz."
"D: Goes down easily, somewhat tasty, not a bad beer but I've had better of the style that I would opt for in the future."
"Easy to drink, the bubbles feel small. The flavor could be a little more full-bodied, but I did buy this beer on sale due to a passed expiration date..."
" I'm not a lager drinker so didn't know what to expect (I've had Budvar Dark and found it disappointingly thin) but 4.9% should buy some more body and backbone.I feel that this could be a decent brew if better balanced."
"I must admit I did like the label a little more then the beer inside the bottle. I'm not saying this is a bad beer but it's not my favorite from this brewer, and it's a little pricey for what it is"
"A very good Schwarzbier, had I not known it was a BrewDog beer, I would have guessed that it came from a top German brewery."
"This is the worst beer I've had from Brewdog and I will avoid this beer at all costs in the future."
"D: decent brew, very desirable."
"Enjoyed in Sam Adams glass. Black with fast disapearing light brown head. Leaves lace spidering. Slightly roasty, slightly lagerish aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Understated carbonation, which is good. A little mollasses, only slightly sourish. A little drying. Decent interpretation of style."
"Light body and carbonation work well with the clean lager flavours."
"D - Eh, interesting to try but not much here really. I was expecting more from Brewdog - I just hope the Punk IPA and others are better"
"This beer pours a nice cola colour with average carbonation that leaves a one finger head that dissaptes quickly with sporadic lacing,it has a nice sweet roasty malt aroma to it with some bitter hops present aswell,it has an average mouthfeel with tastes of roasty malts and some bitter hops towards the end but not as complex as i expected but netherless a very easy drinking sessionable beer."
"This is not bad at all and is considerably better then some of the brewdog beers I've had of late."
"D: If you're comparing this with a lager it's very drinkable. If you compare it with other schwarzbiers then this one is milder, lighter and sweeter than other ones - this may be right up your alley (if you think Schwarzbier is to complex)."
"D: Decent. It get quite pointless after a while. The best thing about this beer is the artwork on the label."
"Milder and sweeter than most Schwarzbiers. Still a highly drinkable and enjoyable lager."
"Very dark with little head. An little aroma, but it does taste rather lovely. Although drinking it straight after a bottle of their outstanding Bashah, it does lack something in depth and complexity. So, not one of BrewDog's best, yet still a very fine beer, and an unusual style. And why not."
"Beer pours a dense brown, nearly black body with a slight off white ring on the top, not thick or lasting. Aroma showed a slight citrus character and roasted malt. Taste is of roasted malt, slight chocolate tones as well. Balanced with some coffee notes on the tongue"
"d- very drinkable. dark and accessible, yet not mild in flavor by any stretch of the imagination. It is at once tactfully stylish and tactlessly brazen. Try it."
"M&D - Rich and creamy, heavy on the palate which is nice for this style. Great medium carbonation that I could drink all day. Went well with dinner (a heavy pork stew - Dinuguan)."
"Tap @ Hamilton's. Poured black, could be very dark brown, with a short, creamy off-white head. Good retention with small amount of lacing. Smoky, burnt coffee aroma with caramel, cereal grain, and tobacco. Flattish mouthfeel that varied between slick and lifeless. Very nice smoke and roast malt flavors. Earthy cocoa, like carab, and cream. Nice bitter hops from time to time. Admittedly, I have not had as many schwarzbiers as others, but I did enjoy this beer."
"D: A nice black beer that has great flavour and is real easy to sit back and relax with. Perhaps the first BrewDog I have really liked aside from the Scotch-barrel aged stuff. Just wish it was less expensive."
"Pint at Beachwood BBQ for $6.50 tonight, surprised to see this beer in California under this serving style, great job once again Gabe on getting awesome beers in here, color is a very dark brown nearly black, 3/4 inch creamy slightly off white head that does not last long, some nice lacing though, aroma consists of coffee, smokiness, caramel, roasted malts, raisins, tobacco, toffee, leather, and very dark chocolate, flavor starts off with some roastiness but is a pretty light flavor, some burned malts in the middle, leathery finish with some dryness from strong coffee, does not change much as it warms, pretty light overall for the style, would expect a bigger roasty presence, dry, chewy, and slightly roasted mouthfeel, medium bodied, medium level of carbonation, taste did not linger long and it was thin at times, could drink another glass or two, light and cannot taste any alcohol, not a real flavorful beer though which is unusual for the style, drinkability is there but overall feel and taste is lacking a bit, not a bad beer, probably would not pay nine dollars a bottle like I have seen it at a few places, still a decent brew from the UK, might drink again, worth trying"
"This is not really a Schwarzbier more of a strong beer along the lines of Eisbock barleywine or Doppelbock ONLY that it has none of the alcohol, fruitiness or carmel notes of these beers so overall not too bad but a bit of a letdown in many ways - not what it claims to be but also not what it aims to be"
"D - Nothing mindblowing but decent beer that I'd drink again and could have a few of in a winter session."
"This tastes pretty much like a few of BrewDog's heftier RIS offerings, only dialed back in intensity, and definitely in weight. I've come to expect schwarzbiers to be thin, mild dark lagers, but this far exceeds my expectations (admittedly borne of limited experience with the style)."
"This is a nice enough beer which packs plenty of flavour for its average ABV."
"Um, pretty bland when all is said and done, especially for the price tag, not on par with the calibre of this brewery. Otherwise an unintimidating dark beer for those looking for a stepping stone into the style."
"Taste is roasty with nice maltbitterness. This is like a dark pilsner, with the dark malts adding a strong dark taste. The light body of the beer seems to be a little out of balance by the roast. Drinkability is a little inhibited by this."
"Mouthfeel is a bith thin and watery, yet smooth enough to please the palate and soften the carbonation."
"Overall - An excellent example of a Schwarzbier... definitely recommended..."
"A nice rounded body makes it a satisfying drink, which is nicely balanced and easy to imbibe."
