Very nice dark brown to black color, with very little head. Aroma was nice and toasty, with slight coffee and chocolate hints. Mouthfeel was light. Excellent stout-like flavor, without being overly powerful. A great drinkable beer with good flavor and balance.","KWrightVT","Dec 31, 2014"

Also have not had much of this style so not sure what to expect or compare it to. Love the look of the beer, dark and clean. Very easy to drink with some nice flavor. Very interesting style and beer. A lot of the aspects of a stout but very drinkable which would make it a session beer. Overall a very good beer that I enjoyed very much and would not mind having again. No idea what a six goes for but an interesting beer to keep in the fridge to share with others.","JamieDuncan","May 11, 2014"
3.34,-12.3,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"my first beer from these guys is a bit of a let down. it tastes a bit stale, like a crummy euro dark lager all extracty and weird. dark in color, more like a porter in looks than a dark ale, rather dense and not super heady after the initial gush fades down. a nose of tale dark roasted grain and lager yeast, nothing seems alive or fresh about it, flavors are all muted, and the yeast is just weird. i have heard these guys make some great stuff, but this is a pretty uninspiring introduction to this brewery. lacking the nice carbonation and quick finish of the better schwarz types, and not really giving me much grain character at all. it makes me thirsty for a good one. it also seems a bit thick and under carbonated, not the feel i am really after in the style. all up, there is nothing particularly bad about it, but it just never really comes together, something with the yeast i think, but this one is forgettable for me.","StonedTrippin","May 10, 2014"

3.88,1.8,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.75,"A solid and satisfying, easy drinking beer. It probably could use just a bit more body or fruits to give it more oomph, but it still is pretty tasty. Probably my favorite beer from this brewery so far. A good sessionable beer to go with food, since it won't fill you too much.","Beer-A-Lot","Mar 20, 2013"

Definitely better than the macros. but a bit of a let down for those with a more adventurous taste.","obywan59","Mar 11, 2013"
3.93,3.1,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"On tap @ the brewpub. Pours black with a sturdy light mocha head that rings the sides with rich swathes of lace. Smells floral and green with citric hops. This blends in with a combo of cocoa powder and some sweeter toffee flavors, while a firm roastiness shores up the back. The taste is similar, with a smooth blend of cocoa, caramel, dark malts and a crisp citric bite that leaves a touch of bitterness and roast in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean and tight feel all around. Flavorful and very drinkable, this is one of the better Schwartzbiers I’ve had lately.","Kegatron","Mar 09, 2013"
3.85,1,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured a blackish body with two finger offwhite head that took forever to die and left sticky lace. Hearty, roasted malt aroma with good notes of dark chocolate and some caramel and I don't pick up too much of a hop presence but it's there. Light to medium bodied and easily passes the tongue but not watery, a touch of fluffy yeast for that fuller bodied sensation but mostly an easy passer. Taste is mostly the malts, a good balance of roasted malts and bready dark chocolate with some caramel, and a nice if not equal job done by the hops for balance and a little citric hop flavors in there. Not the most flavorful or exotic beer one is going to find but this hits all the basic attributes just fine and is an easy to drink beer that one can relax with.","clayrock81","Mar 08, 2013"

3.26,-14.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Just not a very flavorful beer, which is a big knock in my book. However, given that this generally is not considered to be a very ""flavorful"" style - in my opinion, at least, and I know there are likely many who disagree (perhaps my palette is simply not ""refined"" enough) - I can't necessarily knock it too much. At 4.9% abv, it's also not terribly unquaffable, regardless of the flavor-quotient. It's worth a try once, but like with so many DBB brews, I'm not sure if I'd come back for a second glass.","CrellMoset","0"
