"Looks way darker than it tastes. Hints of molasses.  Good."
""
"I love the chive.  And so I wanted to love this beer.  But instead I just like it a little.  Decent taste but misses the mark overall.   But they done good for a first beer.  I'll try they're new stuff."
""
""
"It was ok.   Not my favorite black lager."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger fizzy light tan head, with some nice sticky lacing, which disappated quickly. The nose is malty. The taste is malty, not much going on with this one, watery. Light body, with a slightly dry/bitter finish. Overall, too macro for me."
"Dark, slightly malty, finishes with a nice  light hop memory"
"Very drinkable, not a 100% spot-on for style, but no real complaints.  Worth a try"

"Always like a black lager, a style that imparts a dark beer to a classic style so let's give this one  a whirl.  Popping the top I get wafts of cocoa and roasted malt.  Pours into my SAPP a light root beer color with a multi-size bubble head that recedes quickly but doesn't lace.  On the taste this brew has a nice cocoa and roasted malt up front on the palate followed by an ever so slightly bitter metallic like middle and a sweet yet slightly chaulky bitter aftertaste.  A very easy drinker with albeit more flavor in my opinion than your run-of-the-mill lager.  A good sessioner, I would pick up again."
"Good beer. I'll have one if its on a menu and nothing else appeals. Not too bad."

"Super dark mahogany pour with thin , light tan head.  Sweet and lightly toasted with a very smooth mouth feel.  Very good and closely resembles a sweet stout.  Very easy to drink & interesting."
"An OK, if unremarkable, lager.  Meh."
""
"This is a decent easy to drink Black Lager.  Pours a very dark ruby with white head that is not lacing.  The scent and taste follow most black lagers malt with touches of smoke and peat.  The body is light with smooth carbonation.  Overall its good."
""
""
""
""
"Love the chocolate and coffee flavor. Extremely smooth and perfect for any occasion."
""
""
"It would sell as well as a cheap-O beer, it's like Steve Martin in the jerk, trying to be classy but has no idea what it's doing."
""
""
""
"This is an OK offering. Not sure why it took a colab between Resignation and Red Hook to come up with such a typical brew. Very sessionable. Perfect for quenching your thirst while shoveling snow."
""
""
""
""
"So not quite a black and not quite a brown, good malt favor and an enjoyable taste."
"HOME RUN. Walk the line between a porter and lager. Fantastic all around winter beer."
""
""
"Drinkable, but was looking for a bit more flavors."
"12 oz bottle from BevMo. Opaque, dark caramel color with beige head. Aroma is burnt grains and mild chocolate. Taste is malty, roasted grains, earthy with hints of coffee. No bitterness. Palate is light-bodied, slightly thin with a dry finish. The flavor of a porter, yet moderate and easy drinking. An excellent Schwarzbier."
""
"Favorite Black Lager, great job on the consistency."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wasn't expecting much from this beer and it surprised me. No, it isn't the best thing out their, but Schwarzbier is an under-represented style that I've always liked. This is a solid representation of that."
""
""
"Enjoyed from the 12 oz bottle in an Elevator Brewing Company pint glass, this nice black lager pours a dark brown with red tinges, a nice frothy light tan head that dissipates to a thin layer and clinging fine beaded lacing.  Nose of chocolate malts, light coffee, and roasted grains.  Flavors are chocolate malts to the front and sides, light coffee bitterness to the rear, with some roasted grain flavors following through on the aftertaste leaving a lightly bitter aftertaste blending with roasted coffee.  Very sessionable black lager with a wet smooth mouth feel.  Nice solid collaboration beer."
"It has a great taste and it has great flavors of oak barrel taste."
""

""
"There is not a whole lot to this beer. It tastes fine, but is lacking the toasted maltiness and flavor of coffee. Was hoping for a little bit more out of this one."
""
"3.31 with beeradvocate formula aka.. 66/100"
""
""
"It essentially has the general feel of a watered down porter, as others have said before, but it would be a great alternative for somebody who is a fan of Guinness."
""
"It may have a chocolate or coffee note at the beginning but has a mild tart finish that reminds me of licorice.  My favorite beers are IPA's but this is a pleasant change. And if my local distributor still has it on sale at $17 and change....I would but another case."
""
"i think this is a great beer!...... people complain about the lightness of this stout-like lager, but i think it is a unique perspective and good in its own right.  coffee and chocolate notes on a full flavored black lager yet is lighter then most porter or stout beers. this lager is a great dark beer to get wasted on! very comparable too guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff tastes like a good stout or porter that is watered down and leaves you hanging. I was told over and over that this is good stuff so I dropped 9 bucks on a sixxer and was seriously disappointed. High price for a lager that tastes like watered down chocolate and coffee. Won't buy again. Bud light black crown is better and cheaper. Crap beer. Don't waste your money"

"O: OK, excepting aroma, but a notch below average for style overall."
""
"Nice. Pours black, workable foam but nothing too substantial or lasting. Bright off white lacing. garnet or mahogany and bright in the glass. Slight toasty roast in the nose (briess blackprinz/midnight wheat?)light sweet malt. faint herbal hop, maybe minty? Horizon? Medium light body, moderate malt, low hops, noble and minty. Clean finish, slight soy sauce on the outbreath, herbal, quick."

"Nothing i wished for in a beer i dreamed about. Huge hype around this beer begin as its the beer of The Chive, cracked the bottle and immediately got smacked with a delightful smell of bold dark flavors and hints of coffee, but the taste dosnt compare, leaves you wanting more, wishing it had that one last thing to make it a great beer. It begs for a bite at the end and it dosnt deliver.  and to add to the all around flavor its flat as a pancake. very let down by this beer."

"sure it's a little light in body.  that is well within the style profile, so I'm ok with that.  taste, mouthfeel, aroma and appearance are just what I'd look for in a black lager - perfect for a fall day session."
"Overall (3.11) : Again, not for me. Better than Guinness' offering but not by much. The gym sock finish destroys the beer, as does the pig farm aroma. If you're looking for a good black lager, Shiner's Bohemian Black has been the best I've tried thus far. I've still yet to try N.B.'s 1554, so I'm still optimistic. My advice? Skip this hybrid."

"The look of a porter with the taste and feel of a mass produced lager. Meh."

"A thin brown color with a thin off white head. There isn't a lot of smell, but most of what I get is malt. The taste was very underwhelming with a bit of malt, a spike of hops, and then a semi sweet aftertaste. Was not a fan myself and found this beer to be highly forgettable."
""

"Crisp carbonated light porter taste, all after taste"
"No this beer should not be allowed on the market"

"Pours a dark brown with a medium beige head, light lacing. Aroma and Taste is sweet mild roasted dark caramel malt, grains with some light chocolate and coffee notes and mild bitterness. A crisp medium body on the palate with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a mild dark roasted malt, some chocolate and coffee and mild bitterness on the end for balance. Overall good drinking mild session style brew."

"Pours out to a generous beige head that laces well and very deep brownish black color. Aroma is slightly nutty, coffee-like malt with a good dose of Munich and pilsner malts, much like a Dunkel. Flavor is a blend of sharp roasted grains, sweet decocted malts and a touch of noble hops. Mouthfeel is medium-light and refreshing. Overall a good call."
"Not one I would seek out all the time."

"If you know anything about my operations here at Chez Woody, you know that I often (usually) employ a very heavy hand in conducting my pours. This is especially true when it is a dark-colored beer as it makes the pseudo-cascade that much more visible. I watched gleefully as it settled into two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, light-tan head with good retention. My BJCP app tells me that the color is Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, "

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 4/23/2014. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, herbal, light fruits, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and light hop/yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, herbal, light fruits, and roast/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of roast/bready malt and light hop/yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good schwarzbier style. Nice complexity/balance and solid robustness of roast/bready malt and light hop/yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: a very drinkable beer for the long haul. After you have had your 90 minute."
"Do you really wanna name your brewery after what you feel when you sadly settle? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear midnight garnet topped by a finger of glowing wan khaki foam. The nose comprises mildly roasted malts, cocoa powder, light coffee powder, toasted rye bread, and a touch of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, though the rye (now slightly less toasted, the underlying bread clearly visible) is now more potent and more upfront and self-confident. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little schwarz, nothing truly special, but something I wouldn't mind occasionally indulging in."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Promising aroma leads to just a decent flavor. The smooth malts in the smell get mixed up with a decent lager yeast profile and it feels a bit watered down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Porter taste without the porter feel. I enjoy chocolatey porters more than any other beer; I honestly wasn’t expecting that flavor with this beer. I was just expecting a regular lager that happened to have a dark color. I was greatly surprised and pleased. On a hot day like today, it’s refreshing to get such flavor from a light-feeling beer."

"Overall- A decent beer but nothing really noteworthy."

"12 oz single bought from Roths Sunnyslope Market. $1.67 Cola brown coloured beer with a large frothy light tan head. Brown bread malty aromas,slight milk chocolate and a touch of hop. OK Toasty caramel malt flavour ..again a touch of chocolate and some coffee in the back..slight ash taste. Palate is thin and too carbonated..but not terrible. OK just ..way too expensive at $10 a six pack up here.Its not moving"
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours dark black with little to no head. Smells like Bud light. Tastes fairly bland. This beer was very underwhelming. It starts watery and ends creamy. It tastes a lot like marshmallows. Some coffee notes find their way through as well. Overall I was not impressed. It's a decent beer but not the full-bodied experience I was expecting. It's OK."
""
""
"I bought a six pack of this beer a few days ago. The first one I tried seemed to be overly toasted, to the point of tasting like coffee that's been on the burner too long. I don't know if there's some variety between bottles, but this particular beer lacked the over-toasted, charred flavor, or perhaps the biscuit just balanced out the toastiness better. Above average scores all around."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"not a bad beer it s dark it black i right to the point there nothing hiding in the beer if you like this kind of beer then grab a six pack taste great going down and loooks great in a glass the the darkness you deserves it a black lager that you can enjoy anytime i know i will"
""
""
"I'm starting to get into black lagers more and more now so I will revisit this beer later and see how I feel about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The label reads, ""black lager"" though, this is reminiscent of a brown ale. Roasted malt, caramel/molasses sweetness and faint nuttiness. Not bad at all."
"Bottle at the local BWW. This pours a dark amber color with a slight head. The aroma is slightly malty with a hint of burnt malt. The taste is smooth and simple but very drinkable. There is a slight chive finish but nothing over the top. Simple and nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer had its moments. Some good things and bad things, but I’ll finish my six-pack and move on."
"The taste profile could be smoothed out a little but everything good is there."
""
""
" The taste is good with dark toasted grain and nutty flavor with light caramel accents and light hint of nutty toffee with some earthy and dry finish with almost spicy taste from high carbonation. The overall take is it is a decent dark lager with some interesting malt yet it is not really a standout style wise."
"Taste-Pale malt, lager yeast, faint chocolate note, light-bodied. Easy-drinking and pleasant, a sessionable brew to pair with a burger or a plate of nachos."
""
""
"Starts off with a good look and a decent smell, however the overall taste disappointed me. For a lager as dark as it was, I expected more, however what I found was a beer that tasted watered down. Honestly, it could have been a very good beer. It had all the elements in place, but something in the process held it back. A little more heft, and a little more kick, and they might have something good. Not bad, but certainly not great. Mediocre at best."
""
""
"Keep Calm and Chive On !!"
""
"Overall: It's pretty decent. I wouldn't call this beer bad. It's quite good actually, but I've had some very remarkable stuff, so it's up against some stiff competition. I've been wanting to try to for awhile. Glad I came across it. I'd have it again, but nothing I""m going to seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Not bad, but it feels more along the lines of a standard dark lager and not so much a full-on Schwarzbier."

"Overall It was not bad. A good dark/black lager. However dark/black lagers are a in between category to me. This one is not a porter not a stout, but is trying to be both. However it's lower ABV and IBU's so its highly session-able, which is good. But at 10 bucks a sixer not so good. I would rather have my go to porter (Edmund Fitzgerald) which is a buck cheaper and worlds better. This was a good beer, but this black lager just makes me want a porter or stout."

"O – I am an unabashed Chiver but did not expect much here. I was pleasantly surprised but that does not mean the craft world will love this one. This is a very easy drinker and a good brew to enjoy on a picnic or a hot day. I dug it and the wife loved it and well that helps me out. Worth a try."

"Nice for a dark American lager, but a pretty bland beer overall. Crystal clear pour with rapidly fading head from a 12oz bottle. Pleasant roasted taste. Notes of chocolate flavor. Thin mouthfeel with pleasant above average carbonation. Overall, it's a fine American Dark Lager."
"Overall ok, nice malt profile, but a little thin and watery, and little yeasty. Nothing too special."
""
""
""

"As a fan of The Chive I wanted to give the KCCO Black Lager a try when I saw it in my local bottle shop. As a whole I am not much of a fan of Black Lagers anyways but still kept an open mind and didn't expect anything earth shattering. This was a HUGE disappointment as I either got an infected bottle or this is just a mindnumbingly bad beer. Tasted and smelled of roasted ammonia. Two sips and I had to tap out. Hope it didn't kill the grass where I dumped it over my deck."
""
""
""
"The dark malts are more notable in the taste but something still seems a little bit off. It evolves to a slight hop bitterness at the end. Relatively drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear dark brown color with ruby highlights and a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Caramel malt with a hint of chocolate and crusty bread makes up the majority of the aroma. The flavor is what I expected from the aroma. Toasted bread and light caramel and chocolate. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick smooth mouthfeel. Decent beer but less chocolate creamy mouthfeel than I usually expect from the style."

"The light carbonation supports some crispness in a light body. It's a bit smooth, but it could use more than just simplicity to make it lighter and join the ranks of great Schwarzbiers."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is smokey, some firewood. Taste is light, smoke, some bitterness, a bit on the mild side. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not a bad beer, just seems to be lacking any omph."
"Bottle courtesy of D-Day served in a pilsener glass. Pours a translucent mahogany with a loose, 1/8th inch, cream-colored cap. Nose expresses chocolate malt, a hint of char and perhaps a trace of something metallic. Taste consistent with nose but comes off a bit dull-chocolate character in the nose is lacking and overshadowed by the char. Finishes with a kiss of noble hops and a trace of wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just shy of prickly and a slightly dry finish. Overall, this beer comes off a bit dull and flavorless for the style."
"O-this was a smooth and crisp beer that has a great balance of malt and hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark reddish/brown in color with a very thin off-white head that looks like that till the end. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip. Average carbonation. The aroma dark-roasted malts with brown sugar. Very pleasant. The taste is the same and goes down easy. Just a very slight dry finish. Overall, a decent brew."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted malt, and slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet toast and roasted malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but pretty sweet in the flavors."
"OK, so I'm suppose to tell you why I dislike or like it and be constructive too. It is basic, light on carbonation, lacking in aroma and has a mediocre flavor compared to others in its class, like good Schwartzbier or a complex Black Lager!"
""
"RJT"
"Overall: This beer was too harsh all around, feeling like a cola with a macro brewery taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent mouthfeel here but it is not a very drinkable Black Lager because it doesn't create any excitement for my palate."
""
"I am going to say that this is a skip going forward."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid black lager. Not great but definitely not bad. Had higher hopes being a chiver and unfortunately this beer fell a little short. Not great flavor, almost watered down to be honest. A decent finish to it. Improvements could definitely be made. Not a go to for me, but a novelty at the least."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice foamy head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is lightly roasty with a bit of a floral tone. Rye bread with a little peat. Overall, this is decent quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a few others have noted, this beer will not win any awards, but it certainly isn't a waste of your time or money unless you are a snob with unreasonably high standards. Not bad at all. Seems to taste even better when wearing my BFM shirt and looking at FLBP. Smells and tastes kind of roasty. Has a nice drunkness effect after 4 or 5. Much better than any macro, but still perfectly drinkable. Dare I say it has ""drinkability""? Pick up a 6 and keep 5 for yourself, or fewer if you have more friends than me. RAK it!"
"KCCO is not going to blow a seasoned beer drinker out of the water, but the easy going nature and pleasant malt flavors should keep one interested enough to enjoy. I would gladly have this again."
""

""
""
""
"Drinkable as hell."
"Overall pretty tasty, still not going to replace Kona Porter in my refrigerator."
""
""

"Tasty yet somewhat weak overall. The flavor doesn't quite live up to the aroma and comes across somewhat weak after the initial impact wears off. Decent enough but not a must-have."

"a collaboration with red hook, make your own judgments on their direction. a beer for the chive, which is apparently some college kid website, I don't know. what I do know, is that this brew is hopelessly average. its a dark amber color, not black, and has about an inch of caramel colored head, but it fades fast. light and easy drinking, the lager characteristics are quite pronounced, with just a medium roast on the malt, and a bit of a watered down vibe. easy enough to drink and not off in any way, but boring in terms of flavor. a little sweet, quick finish. one thing I will say for it though is that at least its a dark beer. I mean, there are enough crappy low budget college guy beers out there, I am glad they went a different direction with this, but it offers just a few of the elements of a truly craft black lager, or a german schwarzbier. this doesn't have any of the richness or the grain character, but it gets a passing low C grade from me."

"BLAND!!! Nothing about this brew makes me want to drink it again. But, it's ok, I'll keep calm and Chive on!"

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a deep mahogany amber with a fine, one finger very light tan head with good retention and lacing. Mild aroma of biscuit malt with bare hints of toastiness, similar to an average lager. Flavor also mild, light toasted biscuit malt, slightly sweet, finishes with a suggestion of grassy hops. Surprisingly medium body with hints of creaminess. A very subdued and bland schwarzbier, touching on but not grasping the elements of the style. An odd, mild astringency in the finish that would not have been a problem with a bit more robust flavor. Contract brewed by Redhook and the kind of safe, bland beer I've come to expect from them days. Since there were no reviews of this, I did some internet searching to try to find out more about this odd beer that someone at a craft beer store just gave me (I think it was a review bottle). Everything about it seems to be a sea of red flags. It is apparently a brewery launched as part a ""branding"" exercise for a website (The Chive) that specializes in boob photography (but in a ironic way, understand). I have nothing against boobs nor their photography, but it does not necessarily bode well that a ""craft"" beer was chosen as a adjunct to the project unless there is some brewing vision. They named themselves Resignation Brewery although there is no brewery and this is produced by Redhook. The choice of Redhook, which once, but no longer really has much craft beer following and has become rather pedestrian, is not promising. Then the website is simply a graphic of a running ostrich, that's it (branding!). NO text or information. Further internet research finds lots of news releases on the Chive group starting brewing, but virtually nothing beyond boilerplate about the beer or why they were motivated to start brewing beyond expanding the brand. Sorry, but brands without content or purpose are not of interest to me. So I guess if you are a Chive fan and appreciate the ironic premise of the site, this may well be an excellent brew to quaff while perusing the site. Otherwise treat it like any other Redhook beer or branding exercise. Not too bad for a mild intro level schwarzbier, no major flaws (as I would expect from Redhook). Otherwise, only Chive fans and sad ass tickers like me should apply here. It's worth checking the website right now for a great example of vacuous information."
