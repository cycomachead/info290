"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big roasted espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, toast, molasses, light char, licorice, raisin, light alcohol, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of big roasted espresso, dark/roasted malt, and light yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big roasted espresso, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, molasses, light char, raisin, light smoke, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark roasted espresso, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, molasses, light char, raisin, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of roasted espresso, dark/roasted malts, and light fruitiness; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome coffee infused Baltic porter. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of espresso, dark/roasted malt, and light fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Overall, this is an excellent beer. It has great flavors, a fantastic smoothness, and drinks surprisingly easy for the ABV."
""
"Overall: Awesome beer, probably one of the best ""black beers"" I've had. Would love to have again and if I see it again might have to clear out the shelf. Grab a glass and fall in love. Salud!"

"Poured into a MS cervoise, an opaque obsidian color, with a tiny rim of dark brown around the edges. A full finger of rich mocha head receded to a thick ring and held there, leaving splotchy lacing on the glass. Sweet dark malts in the nose, coffee, light fruit esters, doughy, with a scent of lager yeast. In the taste, dark malts and coffee, roasty but smooth with a slight bitterness, unsweetened cocoa, uncooked dough, lager yeast, some neutral alcohol detracted from the taste a bit giving a sensation of oxidation, but it was still within tolerance, and faded a bit as the beer got closer to room temp. It is 9.7% after all, and there was some heat. The coffee wasn't overdone at all, which--based on other reviews--makes be think this bottle had some time to mellow out, though it did come out more as the beer warmed. Mouthfeel was nice, smooth, bordering on porter territory, medium body, moderate carbonation, dry finish. My only gripe was the higher alcohol that left a bit of an uncomfortable aftertaste, clashing with the roastiness, but again, this started to fade when the beer got closer to room temp, so I guess I shouldn't have refrigerated it that long. Good brew overall."

"O: Interesting brew, a schwarzbier with coffee. Very fruity, very earthy. Feels way lighter and smoother than 9.7%. Easy drinking for a big coffee beer, I think the lagering process is responsible for that. Almost no bitterness at all which is surprising given the coffee. I give it extra points for mouthfeel and drinkability but I wasn't really a fan of the flavors on the whole. Not sure if the coffee works quite right in a schwarzbier. Maybe I prefer the bitterness of your typical coffee beer? Not really sure."
"a bit underwhelming for me. not bad but there is no brutality to brewtality (yeah... I thought of that all by myself). This is worth checking out but is no means the best coffee brew around, but to be fair I like bitter ass burnt as shit coffee, like only starbucks dark roast or brooklyn gorilla stuff... so keep that in mind when I talk about coffee, I drink it with maybe some milk, usually skim and no sugar, that doesn't make me bad ass, it is just the way I like coffee"

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown that is opaque in the glass, with a half finger brown head that dissipates slowly to a thick ring around the glass. Aroma of quality coffee, toasted malt, dark chocolate and a hint of alchohol. Flavor is wow, rich latte coffee, toasted malt, chocolate and coffee liqueur, wonderfully integrated. Finishes with sweet coffee, light lactose, licorice and sweet dark malt. Creamy medium to heavy bodied. This is a beautifully made coffee ale, with great balance of flavors. The alcohol in the aroma is well covered in the taste, but this is warming and warm. If a great bartender made a mixed drink out of a well made light stout and a quality coffee liqueur, this is how I imagine it would turn out. This could be my favorite coffee beer I've ever had. Well done and recommended. Not available in Seattle, but bought this in southern California. (Most Midnight Sun is available here). Hope some fall off the truck on the way down next year. Beer distribution is so utterly weird."

"Atmosphere is really nice. Slight head, effervescence, and slight yet persistent lacing. Nose is coffee, black licorice, dark chocolate, and brown sugar. Char roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate and a nice balance of licorice and molasses. Boozy with a bit of a peaty finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"This is a really memorable and unique creation. Probably one of the best coffee-infused beers too."

"On the lower end of medium body with tight carbonation and a bitter, deeply roasted espresso/coffee bean flavor that dominates the palate. Doesn't live up to the aroma with a light mouthfeel, a bit too much carbonation and slightly one dimensional flavor profile. Dry and bitter with a slightly burnt, acrid espresso flavor with hints of smoke, charcoal, barbecued meat and burnt toast. Under all of the roast, there is some nice coffee flavor and sweeter chocolate malt notes. The high ABV is well masked but it's still a bit too harsh and roasted/burnt tasting for my preference."
"This review is a bit of a love letter to one of my favorite beers. Essentially this beer is a double espresso in beer form, but it is so much more than that. The beer looks fantastic Jet black in color, but not terribly thick w a coffee tan head that lingers down the entire glass... The smell is the only thing that isn't perfect for me, faint coffee and chocolate scents but it is nothing powerful like the taste. Full of rich dark french roast coffee transitioning to a mocha flavor and finishes slightly bitter and surprisingly dry and smooth, the alcohol is totally hidden as well. The mouthfeel is also masterful not much carbonation, which is perfect for a coffee beer and the schwarzbier aspect is what gives this beer a light feel making it the most refreshing black beer i've ever had. One of my favorite beers of all time and anyone who likes coffee and beer should try to hunt it down."
"O: An interesting beer which marries espresso and malt while leaving out the hop bitterness. In a hop dominate craft brew world this beer is interesting and refreshing."

"O: The alcohol is well hidden and this beer is easy to drink - definitely the best schwarzbier that I have ever had. Wonderful flavors and aromas of coffee."
"O: This beer is a refreshing change of pace for lovers of coffee beers as it drinks smooth and has virtually no bitterness or roasted flavors. It also hides its alcohol rather well."

"Pours a thin looking deep brown with a small light brown head. Smells of red grapes, plum and raisins. Taste is very sweet up front lots of dark fruit and some slight smoke flavor and goes down with a light espresso aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thiner side with pretty low carbonation. Overall a very good beer...not much coffee going on but still very good."
""
"I stand by my review. Not much if any coffee flavor. The beer itself is good but I don't get much coffee at all, thus my grade."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is much the same with a really nice coffee flavor and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: I was expecting something quite different when I saw this was listed as a Schwarzbier, but the sweetness here is just a bit overwhelming"
"O: An amazing, intense, incredibly flavorful beer, a really interesting take on the coffee beer. It would perhaps be even better if it toned down the sweetness just a touch, but it's already wonderful as is."
"Unique, interesting, tasty, but not mind-blowing."

"The sweetness of this beer may be too much for some, but I love the way it offsets the stronger coffee notes. Another great brew from Midnight Sun."
""
"O - Overall this was a delicious beer. Excellent coffee notes just too sweet for my tastes. Still, well executed."
""
"o - overall, i'm pretty blown away by this beer. i had no expectations coming into this just that it was newly out of retirement and appeared locally from one of the better breweries to recently hit new york. this is quite a surprise and really an out of this world beer. i WILL be picking up additional bottles of this."
"O: the only German black beer (bier) I've had - som my flavor comparisons are mostly from American black ales, as well as ales from the porter and stout family... I thought it a nice beer - a lager, based on the label, thinner than the American versions (which are ales), but just as formidable. I drank it slightly colder than I would an ale, supposing it appropriate. It nicely melded that light, lager fell with darker, more complex and rich flavors."

"OVERALL: I would like to shake this Jeremiah’s hand. When beerfiend sent me this a while back, I had never even heard of it. It sat in my parents’ basement for a year before I was finally able to open it, and holly Christmas was this ever good. I don’t know if the extra year of age improved the beer or not, but this is drinking superbly right now. Lots of big, bold, stout-like flavors that I love, with a full, creamy palate to support it. A wonderful finish on this one as well, making it surprisingly easy to drink. I polished off this bomber in record time and was checking my basement for more. Disappointed, I moved on to something much worse. Thanks again akbeerfiend. This was outstanding!"
"O - Solid beer, although it was kind of a srange combination. Not bad, I liked it, but didn't love it."
"overall a wonderful beer that straddles the lines of many styles. would not mind having another at all!"
"Pours a dark, almost black beer with a light brown head that dissipates quickly. Aroma- roasty, maybe black patent(?) and chocolate malt. Light sweetness on the nose. Taste- heavy chocolate, roast, and espresso (kaladi brothers!). It's almost as if you had a mocha in beer form. Heavy raw malted barley flavor. Palate- Full bodied, tons of residual sugars with a crisp, lager finish."
"D: Not bad at all. A bit higher in alcohol than I was expecting, but at least it wasn't boozy."
"Poured a very dark brown with brown highlights that had a half finger of tan head and left some frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was filled with espresso notes chocolate malts, roastiness, vanilla beans, and slight caramel notes. Like the nose the espresso character dominated the taste long with chocolate malts, caramel, and roasty accents. It also had grinded down coffee bean and vanilla bean notes mid palate. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, chocolatey, slight astringent, roasty, creamy, and mild dry finish, it drank really good and was really tasty. It was one of my favorite from the brew crew series."
"Reviewed from notes, thanks to Alex for bringing this. Poured into a tulip, color is opaque brown with a small tan head, good retention and some lacing. Smell is chocolate, espresso, raw grains and molasses. Bitter coffee dominates the flavor followed by some hops, roasted malts, some sweetness, and finishes with more coffee. Medium bodied with a light carbonation. This is a decently drinkable beer, maybe a bit high on the ABV for the style, although the alcohol was not present in the flavor or smell. Probably a bit more coffee bitterness then I would have liked for the style. A good beer but probably not the best schwarz I have had (although it definitley falls in my top 5 coffee lagers, thanks again Alex!)."
"I like sweet, but this might have been a bit too sweet for me. Would really have liked to have tried this right after it came out as it sounds like it had a much better coffee presence. But as always, a very good beer from MS and one of the better black lagers I've tasted in awhile."
"D - Yum! Got my coffee fix along with a nice malty beer. If you're into malts and coffee, this is your beer. Recommend."
"This has the makings of a good beer but there's something that I can't put my finger on that I don't like."
"D - Probably not something of which I could drink a ton, but definitely quite enjoyable. Best coffee lager I've ever had, and highly flavorful albeit a touch monochromatic."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, it's one of the better coffee showcase beers out there as the other flavors augment rather than overpower. Well worth a shot."
"Awesome for the style. Would like to have tried this fresh, but am impressed with this even with a year or more on it."
"Pouring black with a dense brown head with good retention and lacing, this is one good looking beer. The nose is wonderful - chocolate, roast and coffee, all excellently balanced. The coffee has a lot of depth to it with a nice richness. This translates to the palate as well, with the blend of chocolate, coffee and roast being quite harmonious. Quite unlike any other schwarzbier I've had, but still very good.Again, I can't stress enough how much depth there was to the coffee flavor. Rich, creamy with moderate bitterness and a nice dark chocolate finish, this beer is quite excellent. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this is far out of the norm for the style, but an enjoyable beer, one that I drank multiple pours of."
"OVERALL Very unique and interesting. THe sour spice is a nice touch, whatever it is. Probably oughta be sipped, but the flavors keep the sips coming at short intervals. A good beer, worth trying if you get the chance (and you probably won't)."
"D: Great, this is a wonderful coffee beer. One that the coffee beer lovers MUST seek out!!!"
"Tasty stuff."
"Drinkability is very good, a great coffee beer. Split with my dad, we savored ever drop. My first strong dark larger, a true hybrid, with both great vision and execution. Really happy I got to try this, thanks again Jeremiah!"
"Black and completely opaque with a thin cap of dark tan. Espresso on the nose - that's about it. No real malt to speak of, just intensely overpowering espresso. It's nicely expressed, however, and doesn't smell like a stale cup of coffee. The flavor is equally coffee-forward, but the base beer thankfully shines through a bit more. Chocolatey malt, light bittering hops and a touch of molasses shine past the punchy espresso flavor, though just barely. Bitter, semi-dry finish."
"Solid standout brew and very good for style."
"4/4.5/4/4/4"
"Honestly, this one really blew me away, though my love of coffee in beer probably contributed a good bit. It's certainly the most original and probably the best schwarzbier I've had. Just another great beer from Midnight Sun and I'm really excited about the new series."
"Overall defenitely a good first ""signature"" brew for Jeremiah. Although slightly one dimensional, that dimension is the one you want in a coffee/espresso brew...coffee. If you are a coffee beer fan, do NOT miss out on this one. A respectable kickoff to the 2009 Crew Brews, looks like yet another classic series from the crew at Midnight Sun. Excited to see what Gabe and Yukon Cornelius come up with. Anyway, a good espresso beer, and good start to the series. Get some and Chug-0-lug-0-yo coffee mug."
