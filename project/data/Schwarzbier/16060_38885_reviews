"An OK swartzbier, not the best but still OK. I had this for the first time at my first Penn State beer festival in 2006 and haven’t seen it at ant other northern fests. The first beer I ever ordered on line was a case of this in bombers a couple of years ago (They no longer ship beer). My expectations were high; unfortunately the reality didn’t meet them."

"Overall: not a bad beer by any means but misses the style just by a bit. could use a little more hops for balance."

"A pretty decent lager that Iwish I had tried a little earlier in my possession but still pretty tasty. I would like t try another bottle fresh."

"O: a solid dark lager. Easy drinking and probably the right beer for warm summer months. As mentioned earlier, paired great with brats & homemade sauerkraut."

"O: Probably my favorite offering from the brewery and one that I have had numerous times before both in bottles and on-tap (though before I started actively reviewing beers). I could easily have a couple of these since both the aroma and flavor are nice and light."

"Comes out of the bottle a bubbly, translucent mahogany with a thick and rather persistent pale tan head. Strong, malty aroma has smoky and dusty hops notes and a hint of caramel. Malty flavor has a firm note of woody hops, rather like hay, with a caramel touch. Texture has above average strength and fizz, leaving a malty and woody finish."

"This is a decent beer, but it's light, thin at times, and under flavored. All the basics are there. A bit more flavor would do this beer a great service."
"Dark, chestnut brown. Not a schwarzbier color wise. Foamy, off white head. caramel, sweet malt aroma. Almost a raisen like tang. Malty enough flavor upfront. Presents a somewhat metallic/sulfury taste. Slight hop bitterness in the fade. Nice full mouthfeel. Overall there is better out there. I hate to dis Weeping Radish but for me the have never been the same since the move from Manteo. I try them each year and it just is not there for me."
" The taste is good a very nice lager with some yeast notes and raisin twang from specialty malts with s subtle hint of green apple and plum with a nice woody nuttiness in the flavor, The caramel sweetness seems to balance a little of that though. The overall impression is a good black lager. I remember the original and this is still a good one although there are many I prefer in this style."

"O: Different, but not in an exciting way. Frankly, the tartness is the most noticeable characteristic, and it's a little distracting, but it isn't unpleasant either. The second half of the bottle was drunk with food, which helped temper the beer a bit. I finished it easily, but will cross it off my list for future trips to the store."
"O: Overall a good beer with a full flavor not to familiar with the Shwartzbier style and not to bad to me. The more I drink I get a chocolate flavor."
"Decent brown, but I wouldn't call this 'black.'"
"O: Not what I was expecting and/or hoping for, but still drinkable. If I scored it strictly against the style, it'd get an even lower rating."
"At first sip I taste and smell hint of caramel in this light bodied dark lager. It drinks very smooth and I should emphasize the light body. It does not appear that it would have as a light a body as it does. The light body also seems to give it a mild flavor. There isn't a lot going on with this brew. It's simple, refreshing, and somewhat unique because the style is not available at most breweries. I picked it up in a 22oz bottle and at $4 I'd say it was overpriced. I would get it again particularly at a better price."
"O- A nice session beer that could be enjoyed year round, especially in the winter. Nothing really jumps out, but worth trying."
"Overall a good beer but flavor is lacking as in diluted or watered down."
"O - Not overly complex, but for a sessionable beach beer it's pretty good. Wish I had time to stop my the brewery, maybe next time."
"I'm writing this without having read any other reviews, so I'm just giving my initial impressions. The beer looked very promising upon the poor with a nice head and a rich dark brown/black color. However, it was fairly unremarkable otherwise. The mouthfeel was thin, and I tasted a hint of a porter with cocoa and coffee but that was about it. That said, it might be a good session beer if it's not going to be the focus of the session."
"O: I would drink another."
"Overall, I have only Sam Adams black lager to compare with, but this is not nearly as good as the SA. A ver drinkable beer, and certainly not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it."
"D: This was not a good beer. The scent and taste were dirty and not enjoyable. The body was acceptable at best. Not really worth drinking, so drinkability is low. This is probably the worst of the Weeping Radish beers I've tried, and the others weren't very good! Definitely not recommended."
"Overall a decent beer, but lacking in any serious flavor. Not bad though."
"D: Seems like the draught versions are superior to the bottled version. Too bad. When it's fresh, it's one of the best schwarzbiers around."
"overall a really solid beer and one i would not mind trying again."
"Mouthfeel is light but not too thin. Very smooth. Goes down real easy. Drinkability is fine. This would be an ideal session beer. Very nice."
"Good beer"
"Pours dark brown, near black, with minimal foam. Does not lace. Light sweet roasted smell. Very clean taste with espresso notes. Smooth finish, with an ever so mild hop .Notes of chocolate. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable and tasty. Nice brew."
"Pours a dark hazy deep brown. A little reddish when held up to the light. Nice big head with good lacing on the surface. Smell is yeasty and somewhat phenolic. Nice sweet malty flavor. Some bitterness from roasted malt. A bit light bodied and well carbonated. Easily drinkable. Decent overall."
"Picked up a bomber from Harris Teeter for $3.50, but was not impressed even at that price. The beer was oxidized and tasted like creamy, cocoa newspaper. The oxidation isn't awful, but this beer is a mess. Avoid this one, it's not worth your money. Go buy a sixer of Kostriker if you want a good black beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Black Radish appears a brown color that when held up to the light shows off it's clarity and ruby colored depth of light brown/redness. Initially appears with a finger of slightly tanned head that receeds fairly fast and leaves faint spotty lacing on the glassware. Aroma has a caramel-like sweetness with a touch of butter and a mixture of minerals and some hops in the backend. Taste includes the flavors led on by the aroma; buttery dark grain flavor with a bit of a mineral taste and some clean hop character brings in the finish with a bit of dark grain flavoring. Slight bit of the alcohol is evident in the back of the throat. Quite a crisp finish with a distinct buttery dark grain flavor that is left lingering in the mouth. Medium to light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nothing over the top but a fairly decent representation for the style."
"D: A decent brew, but it misses the roasted, lightly smoky character and instead leaves a buttery, sour brew that isn't commanding a second one."
"Very nice cool weather drinker."
"Thanks Radek. Black with brown spot of smoke,and lace. Creamy mouthfeel,caramel but not thick, that evolves into sourshness, and then a drying finish. Lots of coffee, some cocoa. Decent shwartzbier characteristics, but too much on the sourish part in lieu of hops."
"Blipped ""Radishes"" by the SnakPak Five"
"Dark murky brownish black with little head. Smells funky with some roastiness burried underneath - not what I was expecting. Taste is dominated by a harsh acidic sourness - very tangy. Some roasted malts underneath all the mess add some coffee and smoky flavors. Either this is a bad bottle or this is a very odd beer for me. I tend to dislike sour beers, but that isn't what I was expecting from a dark German lager. Mouthfeel is slick and watery, but fortunately not overcarbonated, so it could definitely be worse."
"Overall Impression: I think this is a great easy drinking beer to enjoy. It is definitely a session beer. I like how the malts are not lingering around which makes you want to have another drink."
"This is a quaffable German Swarzbier brewed to style."
"This was an ok schwarzbier. The appearance had a thick little head, but it was very bubbly, I guess a little over carbonation. The smell was very malty, with a little hop spike. Along with the strong malt smell, was a faintness of smoke. Taste was kind of like a porter light. Chocolate malt and a smokey finish were the predominate tastes. Drinkability was kind of average. Nothing really stood out for me."
"Its a ""soft"" smooth drinking beer but the flavors and smells are not exactly what I was hoping for. I received this bottle from a friend in NC that mentioned this one being a little strange and I'd have to agree now that I've experienced it."
"Drinkability: Very very drinkable...nothing better than a cold beer on a hot summer night."
"M/D: Good mouthfeel, creamy. Drinkability is fine. A decent brew overall."
"Mahogany brown with ruby highlights and a fairly thin head that is gone to a ring within a minute. Good smell of dark roast malts and a light, delicate sweetness. A touch of molasses is also noticeable. Taste is very complex for such a small brew. Some chocolate and toffee with an underlying nutty flavor. Hints of coffee. A hop bitterness is noticeable toward the end, very evidently a German variety. A little more carbonation may have helped this one with its texture. Just a tad thin, becoming a little dry but not crisp in the finish. Not as big in body as it should or could be. Aside from this small quibble, it's still pretty easily drinkable. I actually wouldn't mind another bottle right now. Probably something I'll revisit down the line, recommended."
"I would love to land a few more bottles. I think this would do well in a heavier option. Maybe some oak againg. Though not sure how lagering would be effected."
"D, notes: I feel like this is a schwarzbier more than a dunkel lager. The mouthfeel and acrid bitterness gets in the way of this beer's drinkability."
"500mL bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a nice deep almost opaque black with a thin head that diminishes to barely a ring. The aroma was some dark malts, slight caramel and chocolate notes as well. The taste is a nice blend of roasted malts and slight chocolate with a distinct wheat beer touch. The beer is light with decent carbonation. This was a moderately enjoyable beer, but not likely one I'd try again."
"I enjoyed this, not the greatest but a very drinkable beer."
"This is a good, medium-bodied brew that had some creaminess and smoothness to it - malts noticable like chocolate, coffee and some roasted. It is a little simplistic, and there are better stouts out there. Still, a good beer and I wouldn't turn it down if offered again."
"Drinkability: Now I know what that poor radish is so sad about."
"Pours rusty. brown and cloudy yellow with a light 1/16 inch head. Below average lacing. Under carbonated with a sweet flowery malt/hop smell. Very fruity light flowery malty hops taste. It finishes with a light mild sweetness with a hint of bitterness. This is a disappointment."
"This is a nice one. Dark lager to me have always had a nice balance of rugged roasted flavour and some smoothness as well and this one is no exception. Enjoyable indeed."
"D - Not bad, I'm not sure I could do more than one though. A decent brew that's a bit outside the box, gotta give props to Weeping Radish for putting out something offbeat."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black and had the smell of coffee. The head was not good and went away very fast. It was tan though while there. The beer was a little sour tasting as have been all the other bottled WR beer I have tried. Itt is a shame as I bought these right from the brewery in NC. So I would think they would be fresh and good. This is not the case and I guess they have some kind of problem there with cleanliness. I will not buy again but I will stop there next time and try the beer on tap to see if there is a difference."
"Quite good, nice session beer. Well balanced. I would certainly drink again."
"The taste and smell is of roasted malt with a hint of chocolate and coffee. This is a very full beer and one of the best offered from Weeping Radish. Very similar to a porter or stout so don't let the word lager fool you, this is a hearty beer and is very well rounded."
