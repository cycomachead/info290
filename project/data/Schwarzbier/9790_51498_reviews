"Once more, I heard a hissing when Pop!ping the cap, so either it had a snake in there or it was heavily carbonated. As I began even the gentlest of pours, it quickly became obvious that the latter was the case. The four-plus (!) fingers of light-tan head were dense and long-lasting, adding to my frustration. It just sat there like a dollop of coffee ice cream, refusing to fall and evidencing great retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM =44) with NE-quality clarity and garnet highlights. Nose had a rich coffee-like bitterness along with a dark chocolatiness. Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery, despite all of its carbonation. The taste was very evocative of a dark chocolate candy bar! Dark chocolate, coffee-like bitterness and even a charcoal smokiness made up the taste in this one. Finish was dry, bitter, kind of like powdered cocoa."

"The beer is black in color and just barely allows light to penetrate it.  A fingernail thin khaki colored head rests on top.  Aroma of dark malt,chocolate,and a bit of black licorice.  The taste is of chocolate and dark wheat with an edge of bitterness in the front of the palate.  The fade is sweet dark malt.  The mouth is slightly sticky from the malt."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown-to-black coloring, with ruby highlights, and a thin, off-white halo of head. Nose of subtle smoke and char, richly sweet nut and earthy tones in the backbone. Flavors are an earthy and smoky blast forward, with bitter coffee and bittersweet chocolate in the backbone. Smoke and peat permeate every sip, on a slick, light body. The aftertaste is very bittersweet, with a solid, subtle, smoked linger. Slick, solid, lingering finish. Very well crafted, balanced brew."

"I will have to try this again later, but for now, with nothing to compare it to, this review stands."
"Poured a deep, almost black, brown. A thick creamy tan head caps it and holds on, leaving great lacing throughout the beer. The aroma is delicious in and of itself with a huge roasted malt aroma, deep and rich. The taste is equally malt-forward with just a subtle hint of earthy hops to balance against the malt assault. It has a nice mouthfeel, not too heavy or light. This is a great example of schwarzbier."
""
"Overall /Drinkability: Nicely bitter but in a very refreshing way. Overall I found the beer actually quite nice - it paired well with food (sloppy joes) and I think I could sip and savor one as well. Interestingly, despite how much I enjoyed it, I only want one right now. 12oz seems to be a perfect serving for one evening. So in that regard, it is overall very satisfying to the point I don't want another one. Or at least another one this evening. I might have to get a six pack and try it over a few nights and see my enjoyment carries past one evening."

"Duck Rabbit's Schwarzbier is one of my favorites. It's a little richer and heavier than some of the best German examples and even shows some porter-esque characteristics. Any time I have a chance to grab this beer in the future I will snatch it up. Thanks again, Ryan!"

"Pour is dark brown and transparent, plenty of tan foam billows up and laces very nicely on the glass. Frothy around the edges, a patchy skim floats in the center. Mellow but roasty aroma, clean and dry. Crisp body, deep roast malt taste, light lingering bitterness. Well rounded, very roasty and smooth. Earthy chicory, roasty coffee flavors. Easy drinking for sure. A classic example of a Schwarz."

"O: This is a really nice schwarzbier - well brewed and to style. Lots of complexity and roastiness to the flavors/smell of this beer. Definitely worth grabbing again."
"Overall: I’m very surprised by what I got from a “black lager”…I typically don’t choose lagers when selecting beers at the store, but with this being a Duck-Rabbit production, I took a chance…unfortunately, I only got one because this thing drinks very easy and packs tons of dark, malty flavor…this is a great brew for hanging with friends around a fire or watching some football in a recliner…yum! certainly a seasonal that is fading out, if you see this hanging around your beer store, grab one and enjoy! (3.5/5)"

"Pours nice and thick, dark, oily. A nice thick medium brown head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and toasted bread. Some hops in there as well. The upfront taste is a relatively strong hop bitterness, this quickly turns to sweet, smoky coffee and chocolate. Slightly smoky, excellent flavor. Consistency is perfect, medium bodied and very drinkable; low carbonation. Overall an excellent beer. I haven't had many of this style but I can't imagine there are many that are better than this one."
"Smooth and crisp, slightly bitter but pleasantly so. A very good American-made example of the style. Ham and aged gouda would be heavenly paired with this."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a reddish black with a large light brown head. Smells of fruit notes in the dark roasted malt with very slight hints of chocolate. Tastes of dark roasted malt, slight caramel, and slight fruit taste, a little different. Beer is light bodied and sessionable, carbonation is perfect. Overall, an above average beer."
""
""

"O: definitely on the bolder side (roasted and bitter flavor) for the style, but more or less pretty true to its mild finish and overall weight"
"Pours a dark brown to black with a decent head at pour the disappates to a little foam around the rim. Smell is sweet and chocolately. Flavor is dry up front and dark malty through the middle but converts to a nicely balanced chocolate taste on the finish. They really eeked a lot out of this sessionable but flavorful brew!"
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. A nice beer for sure."

"a nice offering from this brewery.. they sure do like their dark beers!"

"Great to try this but I would not seek out again. Overall an enjoyable easy drinker."

"O: Good black lager, but I'm not sure it's much better than the Sam Adams black lager. It looks pretty awesome in the glass."
"Overall, a great, tasty brew - great roast presence, nice sweet balance and great smooth finish"

"Pours a clear black with brown/red edges and a finger's width tan colored head that leaves rings of lace on the glass. Sweet roasted honey malt and chocolate aroma. Initial flavor is roasted malt with dark chocolate and a bit of sweet grain. Finishes sweet with a big roasted malt flavor and a touch of floral hop. Feel is light with good carbonation. A bit bitter from the roast, but mostly sweet. One of the best Schwarzbiers out there. This is a full flavored black lager."
""
"Appearance is dark brown-to-black with a finger of head that dissipated rather quickly. Good, hearty roasted malt profile upfront, but this offering thins out at the end. There is also an odd sour taste on the finish that I cannot quite place, but it is less than pleasant."
"The roasted malt comes out straight away, and I like that. Loads of powdered black chocolate and a bit of toasted coffee. But it competes with sour cherry from what I think is that awful ""I" word. I like the base Schwarzbier. Its very toasted and roasted malt, and with no real body."
""
""
""
""
"It has the same roast, chocolate flavors one would expect in a mild stout or porter, but has a distinctly lighter finish. It's a nice addition to the belgians/wheats that I've been drinking all summer. I'd seek it out again."
""
"overall one of the best from duck rabbit."
"Pours an extremely dark brown/black with a small off-white head. Smells is a fantastic roasted malt and chocolate, but with a bit of something maybe cola-ish in there as well. It's really quite enticing! Flavor is amazing - to me, this is the best-tasting schwarzbier out there. It's got a very heavy roast going on, but it also manages not to be too bitter and has a great lightness to it that makes it incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is also quite fantastic, highly carbonated and light, which is just as it's supposed to be, goes perfectly with the roasty flavor. Overall, this is the best schwarzbier out there and right up there with Moonlight's Death & Taxes as the best dark lager in existence. To me, this is absolutely underrated style that incorporates the lightness/refreshing aspect of a lager with the roastiness of a stout/porter, and this beer does it better than any other."
"I'm always happy to see Duck-Rabbit coming out with new styles, especially since so few breweries are committed to dark beers year-round. The pour is gorgeous--as black as beer can get. The nose and taste aren't quite on par with the best schwarzbiers yet; the Einbecker Schwarzbier is much more robust and malty. Still, it's exciting to see an American brewery giving this style a go. Definitely worth checking out."
"This is a solid schwarzbier though it's a bit bitter and a little bitey. The chocolate and roasted malts give it a great flavor. It's highly drinkable and very enjoyable. I'll definitely have this again."

"I was enthusiastic after the smell, but the taste let me down. Not bad, and among the more refreshing dark beers I've had. But not great."
"Overall a decent beer. Couldn't drink it in large quantiities though."
"I feel that this could be a phenomenal brew. I'll need to get another bottle to confirm that this is an anomaly. If I can, then I will surely change my score in the Taste category."
"Wow - fantastic! Not sure it quite matches the traditional style, but an excellent beer nonetheless. Roasted malt and coffee notes take your tastebuds hostage. A top notch brew - don't hesitate if you have the chance to try it."
"Overall a very decent Schwarzbier and one that I'd happily have again!"
""
""
""

"o - Overall I thought this was a great schwarzbier. Lots of roasted and caramel notes to it, and creamy and easy to drink. Would certainly have it again."

"I love this style, but have a hard time finding it. I occasionally find Palone, this is much better. Purchased at Bruisin' Ales in Asheville while on vacation last fall. One bottle made it home for the review."

"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Rich, deep brown/black with nice 2 finger tan head. Minimal lacing, spotty at best. Smell is of rich malts, some notes of cocoa and brown sugar, a hint of coffee. Not a strong aroma. Taste is sweet and a bit on the chocolate end of the spectrum. A little hint of coffee, similar to the nose. A little hop ending to even out the sweet beginning. A good balance of carbonation to wake up the tongue. Creamy and silky to round it out. Overall- A very good schwarzbier that is complex and smooth. Roasted malts and sweet chocolate with coffee blend with a decent amount of carbonation. A solid brew I will seek out again- Tasty"
"O: Good beer. Could drink this on a cool summer night in volume. (4)"
"D/O: pretty good drinkability, though I personally wouldn't down more than one of these in a sitting. Great example of a craft brewery's take on the schwarzbier style."
"The body is medium with lively carbonation. Overall a solid offering here. Reeal enjoyable on a nice Autumn afternoon."
"Overall: Very good. Roasty but super easy to drink because it's so smooth. Would definitely have another."
"Really impressed with this one. I think the ""true"" style is a little lighter bodied with a touch less malt, but this is delicious."
"I'm hoping this was a bad bottle. There is nothing here besides burnt earth."
"Pours black & opaque.Small bubbles create a beige, close & dense foam with a good retention.Toasted grain aroma.Dry nuts & toasted malt at first zip.Coffee flavor palate.Sweet coffee notes on the aftertaste.Very good drinkability.Correct carbonation & gentle bitterness.ABV is well hidden in a very well balanced flavor."
"O: A good schwarzbier, though a bit on the heavy side for the style and more like a stout. Still, it's quite tasty."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good steady carbonation. A really solid brew as the weather turns a bit cooler outside. I wish I could get this locally as I would love to drink this more often! Thanks much to smokeypeat for sending this my way."
"The roasty deliciousness of this beer is outstanding, I really enjoyed it. Like a thin, light stout. I am definitely a fan of this style in general."
"Overall though, the great nose does not bring the wonderful taste expected, but it is still another enjoyable beer from the Duck."
"Overall this is another fine beer from duck rabbit, who, for my money, is the most consistant brewer in the state of NC. I wish they would brew this one year round, as I enjoy it ever so slightly more than their milk stout or porter (and certainly more than the brown or amber ale)."
"O - Not too bad. I enjoyed it for what it was I just think it was a bit too old. I may have to seek out a fresher bottle of this one in the future."
"This is another all around solid beer from The Duck Rabbit."
"O - Not a bad beer, particularly for a style that often ends up boring. Would drink this again."
"O: lagers aren't my forte, but I like this, roasty and toasty not heavy at all. Easy drinking beer."
"4/3.5/4/3.5/3.5"
"The appearance is dark brown, with a decent head and fair lacing. The aroma brings lager scents, malt, roast, chocolates, and toffee. The taste is really enjoyable, with a prominent chocolate malt presence. This beer doesn't really proclaim schwarzbier to me, or truly embody the style, but is tasty nonetheless. The body is a bit thin, with a light coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall, a very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"D – Very drinkable. Solid schwarzbier."
"Great flavors for this style, but way overcarbonated. This is a huge problem as a lot of subtle flavors are lost due to the overcarbonation."
"That's all. I could drink them all night. But I could drink a lot of beers all night."
"The CPJ"
"all in all, this is a solid schwarzbier. the carbonation is a bit tough to get by, but the flavors and aroma are really top notch. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dry caramel and a small smoke presence. In the taste, small roast, small smoke, and a hint of fruitiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry smokiness in the aftertaste. I thought this was a nice representation of style. I really enjoyed it."
"Thin to medium mouthfeel and a carbonation level that is a little higher than normal for the style."
"D: Goes down easily, very tasty, not too filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. I highly enjoyed this beer - it's one that I would revisit often. The only down side for me was that the carbonation was a touch too much."
"Finishes fairly dry with flavor lingering on your palate nicely. Although there was tons of foamy head initially, carbonation ends up being perfect. Very smooth, drinkable beer. Perfect lager for wintertime."
"I tend to stay away from lagers in general, for the most part, as I mostly don't like them. Duck-Rabbit has come through for me again though, by producing a lager that I'd actually enjoy drinking."
"D: Very tasty. Like a light-bodied porter. I would have more of these."
"Huuuge head on this beer. Dark beer settling at the bottom with brown head. Smells malty. Hints of some smokiness. Not sure what else is going on. A bit weird. Tastes stouty roasted and smoky. Solid mouthfeel and fairly drinkable but overall not that great"
"I'll look forward to the 2011 rendition."
"4.5 D: Solid beer. I've had more than half a dozen of this style now and I'm really starting to appreciate it. Each one has been noticeably different. This one is definitely the roastiest one and is something I'd like to drink at least once a year. Anyway, good drinkability. Tasty and interesting enough to warrant another."
"A really well done Schwarz. Pours a heady (very heady) deep, almost black with a fluffy pale head. Lightly roasted notes come through on the nose, accentuated on the palate, with a nice balance of earthy, faintly citric hopping and a crackery body. Medium to light bodied with an acidic finish. Could drink it all evening."
"D: nice drinkable brew.. It actually blew me away a little.. Wish I had another.."
"D: Good I really like it."
"D - It's a fairly solid American take on the Schwarzbier. The carbonation issue knocks it down a bit, but otherwise it's a reasonably enjoyable brew."
"D: Really nice drinker for a cool evening. We have snow on the ground here so it was time. I have had their super rare one off stuff but their normal seasonals should not be overlooked."
"Light in body, very flavorful, very well balanced, crisp - very nice beer."
"Bottle. Pours a, you guessed it black color with a nice fluffy tan 2 finger head. The aroma is a fairly light roast coffee smell. The mouthfeel if pretty light with a good amount of carbonation. The taste starts off with a roasted coffee flavor with some chocolate sweetness that then has a strange and bad tasting metallic flavor. Some smokey type notes as well. The carbonation level is too high for me on this one and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the beer. The flavors are decent but the off metallic is not pleasing. No lace left on the glass."
"Overall, I just wasn't digging this one and I normally like the style. Way to fizzy for me and has an overdose of roasted malts. Not very drinkable for me."
"D: This is a very tasty beer without the heaviness. I love Duck-Rabbit beers but the ones I've had pretty much taste the same."
"Overall a pretty solid and complex beer. I will definitely be buying this beer in the future."
"Drinkabilty - I would buy this again. I reminds me alot of a smoked porter but its a little more bitter and hoppy. DIfferent, tasty and enjoyable, could drink a few of these"
"Thanks to BucketBoy for the generous extra. 12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best by 11/11 notched on the label. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, one inch, khaki-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid skim with thick swaths of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests cocoa and lactose (similar to what I get from a milk stout) as well as a hint of wheat. Taste consistent with nose - chalky cocoa and a light metallic character and a slightly watery quality. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with an even carbonation. Easy drinking and flavorful, but I've had better examples of the style. That being said, it still goes down quite easy."
"D: Not classically a schwarzbier, but still very drinkable."
"Drinkable and complex, great beer from ""the dark beer specialist."""
"D: A fantastic schwarzbier. Quite drinkable and complex, with a fantastic mouthfeel. Well done, Duck-Rabbit."
"D-Great session lager for the late summer and early fall. Really wish more breweries would put beers like this out. Sometimes you just want something flavorful but still nice and easy to drink. This one fits the bill quite nicely. Definitely worth picking up a sixer during its seasonal release."
"Very impressive offering from ""the dark beer specialists""..."
"This beer goes down very easily and is a wonderfully sessionable beer. I had tried and enjoyed many Duck-Rabbit beers at fests before, and I am glad I finally got around to reviewing one."
"Drink well my friends."
"12oz bottle purchased from Beverage World in Ft. Oglethorpe $2. These guys are the dark beer specialists so I'm sure this will be cool and if they were going to make a lager I guess it would be a dark one. Dark brown, almost black. Smells like rich malts, not bad at all. Flavor is dark lager, reminds me a bit of Full Sail Session black but might be a notch up taste-wise. I would love to be able to get Duck Rabbit Porter and Milk Stout on a regular basis."
"Thanks to Alex for a nice D-R, 12oz bottle into a Bells tulip...Pours a dark brown, looks a little watery though, a small off white head, not much retention or lacing...Aroma is nice smoke right off the bat, hints of peat, coffee, and chocolate...The taste is really roasty, coffee, smoke comes through. Not overly complex but good, add some more depth and this would be great."
"Pours a very dark brown with a cola colored head that retains well. The aroma has some chocolate and espresso notes upfront, with some dark fruits and burnt bread, molasses, cola and a hint of smoke. The flavor is similar with dark chocolate and espresso notes initially, along with some burnt bread, molasses, prune, smoke and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is appropriately light, and drinkability is very good. Another quality seasonal from Duck Rabbit, and it's nice to have darker beers available over the summer."
"drinkability: world class scwartz. i expect nothign less from this brewery."
"Definitely the most robust Schwarzbier I've had to date, pretty good stuff."
"D: Pretty good drinkability. The initial flavors are pretty good, it goes down easy and is on the thin side."
"Solid two fingers of dark brown foam, somewhat delicate as it dissolves down swiftly to a full layer across the surface, not much lacing left behind. Very, very dark brown but not quite black colored liquid, turns to a zinc orange around the rims where it displays much clarity. The nose comes across as much roasty/toasty than smoky, freshly ground dark roast coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, crème brülée, chicory, all accompanied by red grape, plum, cherry fruit scents and then a brush of oats and whole grain bread, suggestion of orange peel, however, remains firmly malty. Medium-bodied, same general impression in the mouth of more basic roast than smoke, the chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel flavors dry and about 2/3 bitter, 1/3 sweet. Given the dry mouth feel, the plum, cherry, blackberry fruit flavors have less of an impact here. The carbonation is moderately high and stirs things up consistently. More sweet grains than dough or bread, staves off some bitterness. Not a lot of refreshing lift but keeps plowing straight ahead, no questioning the length of the finish. Wish it had more of a smoky edge, however, it is absolutely a pleasurable beer to quaff with very good drinkability for the type."
"very easy to drink."
"A drinkable, good beer, I would have liked it better if it had alittle more body."
"Drinkability: A quality Schwarzbier with its light lager qualities but still plenty of roasty, malty goodness."
"The mouth is the weakest part of this beer. It's a little too thin for my liking; could stand a bit more depth in this dept. All is forgotten when I taste this though! Wow! Great chocolate-y flavors, with some light bitterness. Warm bready flavors as well. Slightly roasted as well. Excellent finish. This is one of the best of the style I've ever had. Great representation. Get some if you have the chance."
"This beer is one shade above black and pours with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Rich mocha aroma is quite appetizing and demands a taste. Smoky flavor has tones of quality roast coffee and sweet chocolate, rather like a good stout. Texture is tingly, lively and fizzy. Finish is chocolaty and slightly sweet. Recommended."
"very drinkable."
"F: A little more roasty earthy bitterness coming on the front end of the finish. Some lingering roasted malts, more chocolate than before comes out on teh finish, a little dark fruit as well. Dries off a bit and finishes pretty clean, most likely thanks to the lagering. A touch of residual sugar. The smoke also seems to stick to the mouth and leave it's memory."
"D: Another nice dark beer from Duck Rabbit. The alcohol never gets in the way of the over-roasted malts."
"D - why havent i had this before? awesome representation of a cool style...will make a great winter beer, loaded with flavor yet light and easy to drink. DR impressed again."
"D - Well I didn't love it or hate it but I don't think I will ever pick it up again. Still very interesting beer but wasn't as bad as expect. Meh."
"Aroma is roasted malt but without any smoke. It's got a nice bitterness to it but not from hops, just from the roastiness. Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation is fairly high. Certainly the drinkability doesn't suffer from the (presumably) low ABV, but I got a little tired of this one. If you're looking for a good Schwarzbier, this one delivers the goods; it's just not my thing to have more than one or two of them."
"D- This was a very good beer for a company whom I've not had much from. I think this is a wonderful style that most people overlook. I would love to get my hands on more of this!"
" D- The full rich but lagered flavor has some nice roasted character but still smooth and very drinkable."
"D: This is a unique beer that I thoroughly enjoyed, and hope to have again, but not one I think I would like all the time."
"I was really impressed with this schwarzbier. More so than the few others I've tried from Duck Rabbit. Overall, it isn't the smokiest schwarzbier I've tried, but it is one of the best."
" "
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I wish I could buy a mixed case of all of their beer releases!"
"D-Very easy drinking. I wish I had regular access to this one."
"Nice drinking beer. Very good representation of style."
"tasty and full enough for the winter yet light and drinkable for the summer too!"
"Big aroma of roasted malts and a light smokiness hits you, as you sit by the glass. The flavor is roast forward as well (coffee and bitter chocolate), but the feel of the beer comes into play as you drink it. This is nice and light in your mouth, so you know it's a lager. This one has a sweet finish in the flavor. It is a pleasure to drink. This is my first Schwarzbier and I know it won't be my last"
"Drinkability is very good, this has a lot of the flavors that are in a good stout except it is lighter and a lot more drinkable. Another excellent dark beer by Duck Rabbit in my opinion."
"I fell in love with this pitch black beer whilst drinking in Pittsburgh a week ago. Piper's Pub was pouring some fine wares the night of our visit but between heavy hitters from Victory, Terrapin, Duck Rabbit, Sierra Nevada, etc the Duck Rabbit Scwarzbier was the best of show. Appears pitch black body with a cocoa tan head forming thick. Minimal lacing forms with each sip. Aromatics bring to mind cocoa, coffee, creamy toffee and caramel notes. Flavor sblend everything including a hell of a roasted malt flavor, malted milk ball chocolate tones, this is an excellent representation of the style herbal hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied never cloying I again fell in love with the silky smooth finish. Drinkability solid from every perspective I could have and should have drank this all night long great beer I'm glad I found a taste of it."
"This is one of the best schwarzbiers I've ever had. It's full bodied with tons of complexity and a great mouthfeel. Towards the top of the Duck Rabbit list for me."
"D - An excellent Schwarzbier... Nothing less should be expected from the self proclaimed ""dark beer specialist..."" Stands along with Rabid Duck as Duck Rabbit's best offerings... I wish I had me some more..."
"D - The bitterness in the aftertaste interferes slightly with the overall drinkability, but overall this stuff goes down quick. Definitely something I could have at least two of."
"This beer blew my mind. I had never had a Schwarzbier before this one. The color of the beer made me thing ""oh here comes another heavy weight"" while the viscosity should have tipped me off otherwise. The taste of this beer really reminds me of good coffee and smoldering embers. The beer is black, and i mean BLACK. It's really nice looking in a glass mug. Really happy with the results and I am on the hunt for more Schwarzbiers!"
"Pours a shiny crude oil black, minimal khaki colored head, little to no retention and lacing. Scent is of dark roasted malts, esspresso beans, chocolate, slightly burnt. Taste follows scent with a dark roasted, sometimes burnt blend of malts, esspresso beans, cocoa powder. Definite hop presence noted as it warms and a lager like twang on the back end. Body is lighter side of medium, enough to hold the dark malt charachter. Very nice Schwarz... a style more Stout/Porter and Imperial Stout heads should give a shot."
"D - This was my first Schwarzbier and I did a side-by-side with the one from Sam Adams...this was a nice beer but it reminded me more of a milk stout/regular stout...I'm looking forward to try Duck Rabbit's other dark beers"
"Pours inky black with a very silky head and superb lacing. Smells deeply robust with loads of bitter chocolate and some creaminess. The taste is similar, but with a fair dose of ash which is a little distracting. Bitter and rich and just a tad lighter than I would like."
"Pours a slick black with mocha highlights and a quickly fading tan head that recedes to a thick ring with little lacing. Roasted, smokey malt aroma, with coffee and chocolate notes, very rich and full. Creamy, medium-full body with soft carbonation and a fairly dry, smooth finish. Flavor is roasted and burnt barley and malt, with mild coffee and chocolate notes providing a little balancing sweetness. Also some light fruitiness near the finish that is unexpected but pleasant. I like black lagers and this is one of my favorite beers from Duck Rabbit (I've been hit or miss with them in the past)."
"Pretty perfect, chocolate, coffee, Julie Newmar purrfect."
"Overall I have to admit schwarzbiers still are far from my favorite style but it's apparent that this is a good one. Well worth a shot, even more so if you're into the style."
"D - Very tasty beer. Almost like a diet porter. Good nutty smokey flavors from the roasted malt, but enough hops to give it some character. The body is not very thick, making this an easy drinker."
"This is probably the best schwarzbier I have had.Poured a oil slick black,I mean no ruby tint here at all,a 1/2 finger off white head atop.Aromas of deep roast and molasses with just a hint of citric hop.Deep dark roasted notes on the palate mixed with black licorice and molasses,just a hint leafy hop in the finish.Wow this a great black lager,full on roast with just enough sweetness,but light enough to have a few.Hell yeah."
"Excellent beer though not to style it is something that I would drink if available to me."
"Drinkability: This black lager has lots of dark, burnt flavors that could become cloying after a few beers. For that reason, it isn't so much of a session beer. Good for the cold fall and winter nights."
"D - not a style I go after often, but had this beer in my beer of the month selection, enjoyed it much more than expected, great for the fall, and enough complexity for an after dinner drink"
"Duck Rabbit knows how to do dark beers and this attempt at one of my favorite dark styles didn't disappoint in the least. Massively roasty yet balanced with a nice sharp crispness to the feel and drinkibility. I wish that I had more than just this one bottle."
"Very solid offering here from Duck-Rabbit, a brewery semi-new to this area that fails to disappoint."
"Very drinkable. If only I could find this locally."
"Drinkability: Quite possibly the best schwarzbier I have ever tasted, this beer packs a lot of flavor"
"A little strong in coffee flavor for me (though I see no references on the bottle or online to any actual coffee used in the beer) but this is a good beer."
"M&D- The feel on this was smooth as hell, almost like a milk stout. the body was light and the carb was on point. no rough spots, very creamy. The lightness makes this a real winner and a huge drinker, will get more for the upcoming cold months."
"Don't drink and review."
"Overall: My new favorite Schwarzbier!!!"
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee, vanilla. The taste is sweet, malty, nice little bitterness, chocolate/toffe, slight vanilla note. Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice Schwarzbier, thanks Chuck."
"D: I assume that this does not have some gigantic ABV but it doesn't lack flavor at all and is very easy to drink."
"drinkability: good"
"D - I'm a fan of dark lagers, and this is a good one. It has the signature Duck Rabbit flavor that I taste in all their beers, which I like, but I'd like prefer them to branch out a bit more. Still it's a nice addition to the lineup from a great NC brewery."
"D: A very good brew that really raises the bar for this style done in the US. It's still very easy to drink and a great beer for dark malt lovers. This may well be Duck-Rabbit's best beer."
"The Dark Beer specialist did it again! They made yet another great dark roasted beer. I could see this as a dark roasted session beer."
"D: I'd definitely buy this if it were available in my area."
"M + D: Lighter in body, easy going and smooth drinking. This is a very nicely done beer, certainly accessible and easy to drink. I look forward to imbibing in many more of these as long as it lasts! Recommended drinking."
"The mouthfeel is very nice with littlr to no cloying. The gravity feels like its about where it should be for the style, making this a very drinkable tasty."
"Purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Notched freshest by 11/09. The lager appears a nearly opaque dark chestnut color with about an inch of creamy light tan foam. the foam lingers for a bit before settling to a thin layer. Awesome dark roasted grain and bitter cocoa are the first notes to attack the nose and taste-buds, followed by notes of slightly burnt caramelized malt, a touch of smoke and char, grassy hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. Very nice!"
"Ah, a Schwarzbier. Served on draught at a local beer bar in the D.C. area. Dark, like black, in the pint glass. Thin brown head, the first smell I got Bock, the second I got porter. I could smell the malt, the alcohol (even though its low) and the smoke. Strong roasted malt character, I like this beer. Darks aren't my forte, but this was quite good. Smoke appears in the aftertaste, schwarzbiers are the porters of the lager world. Drink and enjoy, cheers."
"I'm always a big fan of schwarzbiers and think they're one of the most drinkable lagers. Although this one is heavy on roast flavor, it is still really easy to down and potentially one of the best American renditions of this German style."
"On-cask at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. Appeared pitch black in my pint glass with a short tan head. I'd never had a cask schwarzbier before, but I'd have one again. The roast was heavier than most beers in the style and reminded me of lighter stout, but I'm not complaining. There was a delicious mocha and black barley taste with hints of bitter chocolate and licorice. Give this a try if you can find it."
"This is a fantastically easy drinker...not sure on the abv, but this one goes down smooth. Definitely a sessionable beer with a ton of flavor. The only other schwarzbier that I've had in quantity is the Sam Adams Black Lager, and I think the Duck Rabbit is head and shoulders above. I would love to see DR add this to their standard lineup, as it could become a go-to."
"Nice brew! Another fine brew from Duck Rabbit."
"Definitely a Shwarzbier worth having. Recommended."
"4/3.5/4/4/3.5"
"Tasty for sure. I'm glad DR decided to put out a summer seasonal with some real drinkability. Being the ""dark beer specialists", a schwarzbier seems like a logical choice and they pull it off very well."
"Schwarz is just such a nice style. I think if more people got over their OMG A DAAARK BEEER fears this style could be a hit. It is so enjoyable to both the enthusiast and the layman. It is interesting and can be complex enough for the enthusiast but it is just so damn smooth, rich and clean for the layman. Easily approachable. I've had some success recommending Schwarz to folks looking to get into non-Lite beer for those reasons. Rich and tasty yet smooth and easy to drink."
"I wish more breweries would focus on this style, this is the session beer for the dark beer fan."
"This poured a nearly opaque dark ruby color with a fair amount of tan head. It smelled like roasted barley with muted caramel and coffee and some smoke. It tasted like roasted coffee and burnt barley, with some oak and smoke. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this had an interesting taste that was heavier and smokier than expected from a schwarzbier. Almost seemed more like a smoked porter to me. It had decent body, but nothing great, and was pretty easy to drink. The taste wasn't perfectly clean, but it was generally enjoyable. Given the limited nature of this beer, you can skip it without worrying about missing too much."
"The drink is medium-bodied and highly quaffable with mild carbonation that suits the brew and this drinker just fine. An excellent first-time offering that I hope to see in D-R's rotation again."
"Drinkability: Good to know that Duck Rabbit is branching out. I missed their doppelbock when it was around (""around"" being a relative term, as Duck Rabbit kegs only occasionally make it up here to Virginia and less frequently to Charlottesville, but I imagine the doppelbock was not one of the few we got/get), but I hear that - in addition to this Scwarzbier - they'll be bottling their doppelbock next year as well as adding a Marzen to their lineup in the next few months. A trio of difficult-to-properly-pull-off styles from the ""dark beer experts"" (a tagline I still dislike, as I think it smacks of beer stereotyping, but I digress) has me looking forward to the next entry. Kudos, Duck Rabbit."
"D: The smokiness that adds to the taste score slightly decreases the drinkability. By the end of the beer, I've had enough smoke for one night. On the other hand, that makes it a good 6pk purchase as it should last for the better part of a week!"
"sampled subsequently on tap at Bierria Paradiso DC and have found it to be considerably more appealing in bottled form"
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation is medium. Drinkability is very good. A superb schwarzbier."
"The flavor is some sweetness upfront followed by a sharp kick of roasted malt and dark roast coffee. Slightly acidic per style. Lighter mouthfeel with a sharpness from decent carbonation. I have tried about five other US brewed swarzbiers and this stands out as being much darker (DR style), less chocolate and more coffee, and a bit hoppier in the finish."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a dark almost opaque black with a decent head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is a decent amount of roasted malts, dried fruits, cocoa and slight coffee. The taste is a nice subtle blend of roasted malts with subtle yet present coffee, cocoa, and dried fruits with a decent hop backbone. The beer is quite light and refreshing, even on a hot summer day. This is a very respectable version of the style."
"I had this beer at the release party in Raleigh Flying Saucer. The coffee and caramel on the nose hits pretty well, and gives the illusion of being a big bold stout. Very black with a nice tan head that doesn't go away too quickly. The mouthfeel was very ""thin"" and I did not percieve it to be a big bodied beer. The taste was of coffee, caramel, and very crisp like a certain pilsners I've tasted. Overall, this beer was very good, and I was excited to be one of the first to try it at the Saucer in Raleigh North Carolina."
