review_text
"S1nist0r Black Ale.  A schwarz bier fermented with ale yeast -- or, as previously stated, a black ale.  Perhaps a black Kölsch would be a better description.  22oz bottle served in a curved stout glass.  Beer pours on the brown side of black, with a thin tan head, and yields a mild, malty aroma.  Flavor is mild and fizzy.  Like, a lot mild, though what flavors there are (nutty, hazelnut) are pleasant enough, except for the high carbonation this could be a legitimate session ale."

"Overall this is not something I would buy over and over, but its a nice beer to sip while maybe smoking some nice herb (I'm in OR its legal). A decent brew that would please a newcomer to craft brews."
"I was expecting an aggressive Black Ale... so that didn't work out for me lol.  This was like a sheep in wolves clothing to me.  Intimidating exterior, but tame and mild in reality.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I was looking for either."
"Overall - Pretty good black lager / scharzbier, especially condsidering the style. It's a difficult style to pull off, IMO, because it doesn't quite excel in any particular area. This one has some uniqueness, and it's undoubtedly due to the ale yeast used. Don't go out of your way for it, but definitely something to try if readily available."

"I wasn't sure what to expect approaching this one, and I clearly didn't read the description on the bottle which clearly identifies it as being a modified schwarzbier as opposed to the CDA I was anticipating. This is not a bad thing: far from it. While I don't have a ton of experience with schwarzbiers and they're not my favourite style (especially in the dark category), this one is enjoyable. I was wary as I began my decent into it, but by the finish it demonstrated something I didn't even know I was looking for. Tasty. Try it."

"Appearance is a very dark brown color supporting a healthy dissipating head leaving nil lace. Smell of the roasted malt with slight dark chocolate and coffee. Taste of the roasted malt giving it a slight bitter astringency with a light sour note. Moutfeel is medium light with good carbonation."

"This is plenty drinkable, though a little flabby somehow. If this is a Schwartzbier, it's still better than most. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Central Market - Shoreline in north Seattle."

"Overall - A drinkable ""winter"" beer. In a category by itself and won't compare to overbearing , stomach filling, fancy spiced constituents. It truly is one of a kind."

"Overall: This beer is truly mixed up and does not fit a style, but it is quite tasty. I would seek this one again."

"O: A very nice Schwarz. Not my style but I can spot a good one and this is pretty good. Easy to drink, by the books. I requested the style be changed to properly reflect the style of the beer, Its not a CDA, or a Black IPA or as somewhat called it ...""brown ale"". Its a German lager aka a Schwarzbier. Geez, do some homework people."
""
""
""
"Overall- Mediocre beer. If you like black lagers, this is worth a try. If you want a real black ale (a black IPA or a CDA), then you should ignore this."
""
""
"This is a real gem!"
""
"Pour is black with red edges and lots of tan head and a few larger bubbles. Nose is dark malt, lightly smoked, light hop presence behind with a bit of herbal green hop behind. Taste is not super expressive, dark black malt that is lightly smoked, the hop isn't as prevalent, still a touch green, bitter coffee towards the finish and lingering. Well carbonated smooth medium body. Not bad."
"O- Nice Black IPA or Pale Ale, not much bitterness and unique lemony hop profile. I enjoyed it."
""
""
"An average beer at best. Everything was just a little on the light side for my tastes."
""
""
""
"Overall: a good beer indeed, although perhaps miscategorized. This is, by simple definition, an ""American Black Ale", but it definitely does not fit the old ""Cascadian Dark Ale"" or ""Black IPA"" categories which ""American Black Ale"" implies."
""
"A well done beer, definitely more similar to a Schwarzbier than an American Black Ale in the flavor and mouthfeel. Very little hop presence with a smooth, mocha profile."

"Big thanks to the BA who sent this one out to me as an extra in a past trade. Shared this one with my doppelganger after a day at the gun store. Served from bottle into a New Jersey Devils (my inner Penguins fan is pissed!) shaker. Poured a massively dark amber brown with a four finger off-white head head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, earth, earth hop, and subtle spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, spice, earth, earth hop, fruit, dark chocolate, and subtle fruit hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. For the style there really wasn't a lot of roastiness going on in this one as it was more sweet and earthy than anything else. While this was kind of surprising, I really didn't mind it too much if I am honest. This did keep it quite enjoyable throughout the beer, but it just fell a little short of what one would expect from the style. Still a good brew, but just not up there for the style. Worth your time trying at least once, but if you enjoy the roastiness this one MIGHT not be for you."

"A bit of advice to people adding beer in the near future: Please read the label and review the beer then choose the style that is the closest based on the characteristics."

"A pretty good black ale."

"Finally got around to trying this. Black Ale that was made like a Schwarz Bier sounds interesting...especially the ale yeast instead of lager yeast. Pours out like a porter. A good dark brown and as it settles in the glass its dark as night. No light gets through the brew when held up to the light except for the top of the rim of the beer. It has kind of a light brown hue. The head was a thick creamy khaki color that faded away quickly with a very thin head stay around. The smell, when cold has a hint of bread and chocolate at front and a subtle roast in the end. The taste has a very sweet flavor with a hint of roasty peat and bitter chocolate. No hops at all. Very sessionable dark beer with flavor that does not stick around. Its tasty and makes you want some more. The mouthfeel is very thin. Not too carbonated. Very watery texture. Its not bad but its color yells thick dark goodness but the low 5.7% abv is most evident in this portion of the beer. I have had 8% dark beers with a thicker mouthfeel but similar flavor. However, this is not a negative, just a part of the beer that is hard to anticipate when pouring it out of the bottle. Giving a second pour I looked more at the liquid and it looks like cola, which confirms the very thin mouthfeel to this beer. This is a good beer. Not something that screams buy again but its definitely one worth trying. Its an interesting beer. It has properties like a porter and of a schwarz bier. And overall, for under 4 dollars, worth the price."

"absolutely deliscious darlk and yet very smooth no bitterness at all amazing. If you like dark beer this is a must try. It's definitely in my top 5 of all time favoriet beers I absolutely absolutely love it. Dark and deliscious just like I like it. Everyone who like dark beer must ry this beer"
"O- I think I very well might have got an infected bottle. The taste is making me sick. Ugh."
""
""

"Overall: Tastes more like a Schwarz than an American Black, to be honest, and if I were reviewing it as such, the scores would be a tad higher; easy to drink, though I would like to see a bit more hop balance, particularly given where the beer was brewed"
"Where's the flavor? The smell is really nice, but the taste doesn't follow it at all. An odd experience."
""
""
""
"The body was typical for a CDA, which is what I think this beer is. Drinkability was very good, especially considering that CDA's really aren't my favorite style and the age of this brew. It appears that the brewery is still making this brew, it's worth a shot if you see it."

"O: My first beer from 10 barrel brewing and it was good, I hope the rest of their offerings are just as good. Well balanced brew and doesn't have that bitter bite from the black malt like some beers do. And at a price of <$3 I would buy it again for sure."
""
"This beer is above average. It is not a beer I would go searching for. It still needs work. I have had better dark beers. It was like drinking a medium porter with a pale ale quality. A little confusing. However, it will quench your thirst while enjoying a marble rye reubon with brown mustard. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed with that combo."
""
"The appearence of this beer is more like coke or pepsi, not black. Almost a ricey like smell along with light oak and smoke aroma. Very little alcohol smell. Smooth and easy to drink with a little malt and even less hop. Also a bit of a yeast taste. Will most likely pass on this beer in the future, but its not terrible."
"O- just a sub par black ale, nothing too special here. Just taste like a dark ale that is pretty light a good for drinking casually. Get something else"
"The flavors and aromas of this beer are a little out of the ordinary (especially considering they are all elements of one beer) but it is very drinkable. I definitely found that it grew on me after I got over the initial confusion of the smells and flavors. Not exactly what I've come to expect out of a Cascadian Dark/Black Ale, but appealing nonetheless. This might be able to be refined a bit to make into something truly special, but it is good as is and it is nice to see brewmasters thinking outside the box."
"O: Not at all what I was expecting, this brew could really use something else to ramp it up, like the addition of coconut, or wood aging, or chocolate malt. As it sits, its a very pedestrian brown ale."

"Overall an interesting and good beer, but not remarkable. I'm not sure what style they were after (if any) as it has characteristics of several. I had a higher opinion on the first glass, but the impression lessened as I worked through the bomber."
"A nice, sessionable Black Ale. Solid."
"D - Decent beer - lots of flavor for the lower ABV, but otherwise nothing exciting or special. If this is cheap, you could do a lot worse as this manages to avoid the harsh bitterness and astringency of other black ales."
"O: This is a pretty tasty beer wasnt expecting it to be as I didn't really care for most of the other 10 barrel beers I've had. This one is good though."
"Seemed a little thin to me, light-bodied with none of the stickiness-on-the-tongue that makes spaten and doppelbocks sippable...Dry and thirst-quenching, but not really memorable."
"Comes out of the tap a barely translucent reddish sable with a nice pale tan head that leaves behind substantial lacing. Aroma is smoky and malty with a coffee tone and some subtle nuttiness. Smoky roast coffee flavor has nutty, caramel and toffee hints. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy, rather pleasing."
"Narrative: The hackneyed carriage clipped along steadily over the cobblestone streets and the slick London night was further obfuscated by misty clouds. Sir Grimsly peered at his silver pocket watch and sighed at how long the opera had taken. His finely tailored suit of rich velvet fit precisely and his jet black hair was slicked with a fragrant pomade. “Carlton, please, slow a bit!” He called to the carriage driver. He lifted the lacy ebony curtain and looked out into the dark night and noticed a single cat, staring intently upon the carriage as it slid to a stop. The cat peered knowingly and its obsidian coat shined in the night. It appeared to nod and signal to the magistrate. With a blink it disappeared. Sir Grimsley looked up and noted the mandate from today’s proceedings laying on the adjacent seat, unexecuted. With a forceful sigh, Sir Grimsley signed the stay of execution and set the prisoner free. The night shone with a furious depth, the slick streets ploshed with knowing applause."
"Overall, nice beer, easy drinker, low ABV for sessioning with the pals. I like that they are a small brewer and they have great potential!! I would retry their brews if I had the chance but they seem a bit immature still."
"One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing over dark brown/almost black opaque body. Nose features good dose of roasted malt balanced by floral hops. Taste is predominantly roasted malts, picked up some faint chocolate notes once it warmed significantly, citrus hops, no bitterness to speak of on backend. Medium mouthfeel, decent effervescence, a wee bit sticky. This is what they are talking about when they call CDAs hoppy Porters. I know I'm spoiled by my proximity to Barley Brown's Turmoil, the benchmark for the style evidenced by first Gold medal at GABF in the category, I just didn't find this that interesting and certainly not hoppy enough for my liking."
"Overall a very nice simple ale that has a nice flavor."
"Drinkability is also good. The more I drink this the more I think it could be a black lager. Interesting and tasty whatever it is..."
"Drinkability-Smooth and drinkable, but frankly a bit boring. Billed as as black ale, this beer is a darker brown ale with a bit more roast."
"poured a dark brown in color with brownish yellow highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was filled with toffee character, slight hops, various grain notes, and an slight spice. The taste was also dominated by the toffee like a dopplebock with caramel, various grain, and mild citrus notes. There was a touch of hops but were very subtle and mild spice on the backend. The brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a grainy, slight sweet, but malty finish. It drank good but was not my favorite from the nite. Definitely a session beer after a long day at work"
"When properly carbonated, S1nist0r (note the buried '10') Black Ale is probably about as good as this brewery's Apocalypse IPA. If it was more easily available, I'd give it another go round to see if my suspicions are correct."
"Picked up in Oregon, brought back. Into a Bernardus chalice, this is a very dark, oily black beer with a head that receded nearly immediately, leaving a light film on top. Chocolate and cocoa, slightly powdery smelling, dominate the nose. Pretty good flavor, with lots of chocolate malt balanced by moderately high bitterness (no hop flavor though), and a very light roast overlaying it. Not complex, but a good enough generic dark beer."
"And hey, a nice herbal burp results with this one! Overall, Sinister (or S1nist0r) is an enjoyable and solid beer that offers a somewhat interesting take on the well-worn brown ale style."
"More of a schwarzbier IMO"
"3.5/3.75/3.5/3.25/3.5"
"Imagine a decent american porter flavor profile but strip away the body, replace it with the mouthfeel that approches light lager territory. I enjoyed it, but it just didnt fully come together for me."
"- This is quite good, balanced, and tasty.... caught me a tad off guard... especially after reading some of the previous reviews. I am seeing that some are just not very fair. This brew deserves more credit!"
"D: This is meant to go down smooth and does so very nicely."
"D - ABV is pretty low, and it goes down easy enough. But, I would pass on buying it again. Was expecting a lot more with a name like Sinister (no matter the silly spelling)."
"Other comments: Tastes a lot different than I expected. It's basically a porter."
"Pic Added"
"The aroma is malty with no much hop aroma. The taste is smooth with a faint raisin in it. The mouthfeel is a little silky and overall not a bad black ale. Overall not my favorite style but a easy going drinker."
"Either way the beer is smooth, but not impressive."
"Pours with a nice head settling to a decent lace; good and dark. Aromas are mostly malty, dark, roasted with fresh coffee and roasted nuts. The flavor is rich and polished with deep, dark flavors. Has a great texture and balance. Finishes smooth and balanced but with a slight edge from the alcohol. Very nice!"
"D: Tasty and 'sessionable' (though not beholden to the strictest definition). Have enjoyed, if not raved about, this beer whenever I've had it; certainly worth a try."
"Either way, Wildfire's Black Ale gives me no cause for complaint, for it is a genuine pleasure to consume. It is a very chocolaty beer not far removed from a brown ale but in a darker shade of chestnut. It has a chocolaty aroma, a solid head, and wild abstract lace. The body appears clear in the sense of lacking haze or particulate matter, but is nearly opaque brown. It tastes smooth and malty with solid but not overpowering bittering courtesy of Perle hops. Worth seeking."
