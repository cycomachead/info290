4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Rail Dog Smoked Black Lager Brewed by Thirsty Dog Brewing Company. This brew has an ABV of 6.70% The brew pours out a dark brown color with a nice light brown head.  Rail Dog has the look of root beer.  The smell is smoky with grain and malts.  There is a mild sweetness at the end of the smell. The taste is bold and smokey. You pick up on grains and a hit of hops at the end. There is a lot going on in this brew. Rail Dog Smoked Black Lager has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. The mouthfeel is rich and fulling. You pickup on the smokiness in this brew, but it has a clean smooth finish. Overall I'm giving Rail Dog Smoked Black Lager a solid 4 out 5.  I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Nov 25, 2014"

4.23,6.8,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pitch black pour with a normal head, lacing and retention.  Rich nose of roast and dark chocolate over a touch of smoke.  As it warms, the smokiness becomes a bit more pronounced, but still subtle.  Light body with a slightly smooth texture which is spot on since this is a lager.  Above average carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout.  The flavor profile is simply outstanding - complex, balanced and intense. It begins with a slightly sweet roast character that flows into a roast bitterness with chocolate underneath.  In the middle, a light sweet bitter chocolate predominates in an effervescent rush.  In the somewhat dry finish, smoked malts take command and leave you with a campfire like smokiness that lingers.","tillmac62","Oct 12, 2014"

3.95,-0.3,,,,,,"Pours a perfect pitch black. No light escapes, no edges and no hues.  One finger of mocha colored foam, that falls well and leaves some wet lace to slide down the glass as you drink.  The nose is a bit of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of char and smoke.  There is a faint whiff of the "meaty scent" like you get in all smoked beers but it is perfectly under control and very faint.  This has a creamy soft body with plenty of malt that has been blackened. Brought to it's driest to it's richest without bitterness. it's crisp malt.  The chocolate is light on the palate but just keeps up it's appearance. The smoke is a bit of char and a faint bit of cherry wood.  Lovely beer. My only complaint is that it drinks a bit thin and could use a couple more bubbles from carbonation.  Finishes just dry and with only a slight bitter which is lovely next to that light smoke.","utopiajane","Aug 08, 2014"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nearly cola colored dark roasted malt color with light beige tan head, fine speckled lacing. Aroma has smoked malt complexity a touch of campfire, nice dark roasted malts (hints of iced coffee/caramelized sugars) and just barely a hint of anise crosses the senses. Flavors meld nicely balancing the caramelized sugars/dessert qualities that I smell are more of the black patent dark roast, iced dark coffee nuttiness, and cherry wood smoked qualities (no clue which wood they actually smoked the malt with). I like the bitter/dry finish it provides here. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied smokey dark lager, slightly burnt acrid finish. All of the flavor components come together I'm a fan.","WVbeergeek","Mar 22, 2014"

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, smoke, light char, coffee, dark bread, toast, light raisin, and roasted/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of smoke and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, smoke, raisin, light char, toast, dark bread, toffee, and roasted/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, smoke, light char, dark bread, toffee, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and yeast flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked schwarzbier. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 09, 2013"
