"O:  interesting mix of darker malt with floral hops ... a darker beer in which you can really detect the hops; good brew, tons of flavor and very drinkable.  this brewery is good."

"A pint at Radio in 9/4/14. A nice roasty schwazbier from ABW. Not as heavily hopped as some west coast Schwarzbiers, so the roasted malt characteristic shine. Decent balance, though, as it the malt isn't in your face. Drinks like an aggressive porter. Muted aroma, but big coffee flavor. Medium carbonation and body. Clean finish with a hint of bitterness."

"Nice job with this one Austin Beerworks! Offering up a good, drinkable, unique style brew is always a welcome choice."

"Pours dark brown, looks nearly black without direct light but it's quite brown when lit. The head is medium-sized and tan in color. Good retention. Lots of bubbles sticking around, coating the top of the beer. Cleanly malty aroma. Nutty with caramel depth. Very light coffee roast. It's a nice, round malt sweetness. Taste is mild and nutty, again. There's some malt sweetness. Caramel in the finish. Solid grain flavors. Mouthfeel is pretty normal. Relatively light, medium carbonation. Good beer."

"O: clean, easy drinking ""dark"" beer that would play well on a long day of drinking at the park on mid-october. Maybe too watered down for the style."

"Covers a nice range of malty flavors starting at cracked pale grains and ending at a freshly roasted pot of coffee. A dark beer by color but drinks as refreshingly as any brew."

"Overall- the malt prominence deserves worthy praise and is well balanced, not too big, not too light, good for a few"

"Thanks, Phoenix2443, for the opportunity"
"Fair shwartz. Big white head on black body. Aggressive carbonation. Significant acid. Drinkable beer, it grew on me.It was only an extra, thanks Steve in Austin for some fun. Some burning tummy. Good roast aroma.Some chocolate. Lots of Rough patches."

"a nice sweet yet dark schwarzbier. very good in the flavor department with a really nice mouthfeel."
""
"O: Not a bad beer."
"This beer is advertized as a German-Style Schwarz but I think it's pretty close to a lot of porter and stouts I've tried with the dark coffees and dark chocolate aspects. A pretty tasty drink."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O - Light and roasty, pretty simple."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is pretty easy drinking and nice and crisp finishing. A depth of character here between the hops and roast of grain. Overall a solid interpretation of the style."
"O- I haven't had too many schwarzbier to compare this to, but I thought this was a pretty decent beer. It had a nice appearance and aroma and a pretty nice taste (not the best aftertaste in the world, but not bad). It was easy to drink and I definitely enjoyed it, nothing that stands out about it though. Glad I got to try it, thanks Sam!"
"""SCHWARZBIER!""I like yelling that and sounding all in-charge and what not. And speaking of in-charge (that's called a segue), this beer is all in-charge up in here. Though not much to look at with its not-so-black appearance and lack of bubbly head, it smells heavenly sweet and inviting. Pretty sure I smelled some hops, but who knows. A little too bitter to be refreshing, but I do sense that said bitterness is a function of hops. And that's OK."
""
"Black with a thin skim, earthy roast aroma and flavor. Thin ring ofthe edges, reddish copper color in the light. Dry and roasty aroma. Dry bitter flavor, some woody smokiness, with traces lingering nicely in the aftertaste. Dry and savory, would pick this up if I saw it, it's a nice Schwarzbier."
"O - Overall this had potential to be a decent beer, however, that off metallic taste and aroma really ruins this beer for me."
""

"O: I like this beer. It's not amazing, but it's solid. The look and smell of this beer are it's high points. I though it was a bit lacking in flavor."
""
"The first thing that hits me is the astringent bitterness. Terrible! Terrible hops and way too much for a dark beer. I know that hops are supposed to supply the bitterness in a schwarz, but the idea is that they aren't as bitter as stronger-flavoured dark beers, right? This bitterness hides all the lovely flavours that could be lurking underneath. This is not refreshing at all."
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a single-finger tan head that goes away fairly quickly without leaving much of any lacing behind. The nose has faint roasted malt with a touch of chocolate and coffee. Flavor is quite similar, with roasted malt dominating (though not being over the top), with some chocolate in the background. Light-medium body with slight chewiness and a semi-dry finish. A pretty decent example of the style, though I could use a bit more depth."
"O: Best on tap, but the cans are great too, poured into a pint glass."
""
"The flavor is a bit thin and too sharp in its acridity. Still, the nutty malt backbone isn't without merit, as it finishes clean and dry with a bit of bread crust and a raw, leafy hop bitterness to round out the profile. Mouthfeel is light with big carbonation bubbles that add to the sharpness. Overall, not my favorite ABW beer, but I'll still happily imbibe the remaining 5 Black Thunders in my fridge."
""

""
""
"Initial taste matches the aroma, then becomes oddly neutral before a grainy, roasted wallop to the back of the throat that, well, tastes kinda like a roach. (Not the crawling kind.) I can see how burnt flavor could be overpowering to some, but to me it was delicious. Of the few schwarzbiers I've tried, this is indisputably the best. I hope they can this stat."
""
""
"I really love Austin Beerworks, and was very excited to try this. Though Black Thunder is just a bit to burnt and charred for my tastes. Worth a try, but not one of ABW's better offering IMO."
""
"Hopefully this beer is canned because I could drink this all day long."
