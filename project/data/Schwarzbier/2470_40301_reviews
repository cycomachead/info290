"I like it. This is a great beer for when your are not in the mood for hops. The 9% abv adds a nice punch to the liver. It pairs well with Spaceballs the Movie which I am enjoying both immensely."
""
"This is a very nice interpretation of a schwarzbier – the alcohol is well hidden which makes this very drinkable. The appearance detracts somewhat, but still a very desirable brew. I first had this at a beer fest – based on this beer alone I made the Brew Kettle a routine stop when I’m in the Cleveland area."

"Overall it's quite a good beer but it seems with the addition of more malt it lost some of its smokey character. I would have loved it with more smoke."
""
""
""
"Far different than I expected, this is definitely a dessert/guilty pleasure beer. Certainly sweet, very chocolatey. I can understand why some may not like it, but it's right up my alley...minus the metallic note."
""
""
"Overall - tasty and somewhat interesting, a little dicey at that strength though."

"O - felt like I was drinking a thin porter. Great beer but no lager. Will have again"
""
""
"Dark fruit on the nose and on the tongue. Not quite as clean/crisp as I expected for a black lager. The imperial nature certainly bumped up the body on this one. Solid beer with a lot of flavor. A great diversion from the IPA/stout/sour rat race. Certainly worth trying if you like dark fruit flavors in Quads."

"Missed the mark for the style. Oddly sweet and lacking that roasted lager thing almost entirely. It's not really a bad beer, but it's not what it claims to be and warming almost kills it."
"This is a pretty thick beer. And really, everything about it screams baltic porter to me. I like this one a lot. Pick it up if you see it."
""
""

"Pours a very dark brown with a small layer of off white head. The head goes away rather quickly. The nose is sweet with a smokey undertone. I'm getting some dark fruit and a cocoa note. There is a lot of malt in the flavor, but I would say that the smoke ends up being the dominant taste in the finish. There is a dark fruit note and a malt sweetness. Reminds me a little bit of a strong brown ale that has had a cigar dropped in it."

"O: Interesting beer here. I generally love me some high ABV dark beers, but this one just didn't do it for me. I would probably drink it again if someone gave it to me, but its not something Id purchase. Wish he would have sent me the White Rajah."

"O: This beer seemed rather unbalanced to me, with sweet cola and licorice really dominating the flavor profile as the glass went on, making it rather cloying. I would have liked to been able to enjoy the other flavors present, and maybe seen more bitterness coming from hops. Though it would be a totally different style if it even exists, this seems like what an imperial cream ale might taste like. If you're a fan of really sweet beers (or hey, pop/soda in general, which is usually too sweet for me) this one might be worth your time. I remain curious about the bready, fruity characteristics that many other reviewers noted but didn't seem apparent in my glass– maybe I'll need to revisit this, far off in the future."

"Pours a deep amber to black in color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet caramel and a small fruitiness. In the taste, a roasty note of caramel and a fruity sweetness. A small bite, but mainly smooth, and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice balance between the fruit and the roast, a nice body and very enjoyable."
""
"O: Interesting flavor. I was expecting more of a Black Ale/IPA, this is not that. Still, very good. Smooth and very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: A fine Schwarzbier of imperial strength. Lager's answer to the Imperial Stout. Very tasty and worth the purchase."
""
"I would recommend this if you are looking for an interesting sweet, dark beer."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours clear extremely dark brown color with a foamy 1-2 finger khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, banana, clove, bubblegum, raisin, nuttiness, roasted malt, biscuit, and pepper. Some pretty nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, raisin, clove, bread, banana, nuttiness, and pepper. Lingering notes of pepper, clove, chocolate, roasted malt, banana, raisin, caramel, and molasses on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9% with only a small warming after the finish. Overall this was a very nice schwarzbier. Nice balance of fruitiness and roasted flavors; with good complexity and smoothness."
"O- The more I drink this the sweeter it gets. Reminds me of the Black Rat Imperial Stout from Cellar Rats I had recently. A really unique beer style to try out, but I don't see myself getting this again."
""
"This was a pretty decent beer and had some good qualities in the flavor, but was not very aromatic."
"Subsequent drinks really show off the balance. Could use a bit more flavors for the unique Idea of an Imperial Schwarzbier."
""
"4.0 D: I very much enjoy a good Schwarz and this is one of them."
""
""
"Overall - Nice malty and bold fruity flavors. Really smooth and easy to drink being Such high alcohol. The malts are really present but the downfall is the other flavors are a little to mild and forgetable. Still soild and a good drink, worth a try for sure from the excellent brew kettle brewery."
"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit and it has held up nicely. Lots of roasted malts and easy to drink. Would like to have it again."
""
"Not quite mid bodied, a little thin, but drinks much easier than the high abv. Really not bad, but has the flavor profile of a much smaller beer."
"This has never been my favorite from TBK.. but if you like schwarzbiers, give this a try because it's unique and not your ordinary. I appreciate they're doing something different with this one, I guess it's just not really for me.."
""
"Pours a deep dark brown color with ruby highlights and a smallish tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of light chocolate and caramel with a bit of earthy and floral hops playing a supporting role. Taste is chocolate and caramel with a bit of ash. Earthy bitter hops mix with a hint of alcohol to counter the malt sweetness. There's a hint of melanoid in there that makes it a little interesting. A bit of a lingering alcohol burn on the finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. I thought this was only ok. It seems like a kicked up version of a macro lager with a bit of chocolate malt."

"D - A very drinkable offering from Brew Kettle."
"I really enjoy dark lagers, so it was interesting to try an imperial version of one of my favorite lager styles. The brew kettle did a good job with this one. It's not outstanding, but it's still very good."
"O: Overall I am really impressed with this beer. Big, malty, and roasty. Fine work."
"Pours a very dark cola like color with a two finger dark khaki colored head which gives way to some strings of lace. The aroma is of some roasted malts along with a hint of dark fruit sweetness as well as toffee and some dark chocolate. The taste has a roasty and caramel malt backbone with a dark chocolate and coffee bitterness. There is also a hint of dark fruit sweetness that rounds out the flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. It is not slick with alcohol. Overall it is a solid beer, it has a good flavor but left me wanting just a little more out of it. It was however, very enjoyable."
"I bought this beer at Rozi's in Lakewood, OH."
"Pours from a 22 ounce bottle into my nonic style pint glass. Pitch black body with a tan full thicket of head, I love the name the reference to Space Balls and the quote on the bottle...""May the Schwarz be with you"". Fine even lacing left behind very nice look to this beer. Aromatics have some up front dark fruit with hints of toffee and coffee dark chocolate roasted malts. Much like a Baltic Porter a big nine percent black lager. Flavor is a warming roasted dark malt adventure from dark licorice notes with dark chocolate bitterness to hints of fruit (ripened plum hints of raisin). A finishing breeze of herbal hops overshadowed by the bitterness of the dark chocolate nearly burnt roasted dark malts. Mouhfeel is medium to fuller bodied excellent well crafted stuff coming out of the Brew Kettle I can't get over the quality of their beer. Moderated carbonation finishes dry with a nice balance, their beers are wonderful go try some of the Brew Kettle offerings...I can't wait until they bottle White Raja IPA. Overall this is quality I've never had another Imperial Schwarzbier to compare this to but this is excellent stuff."
"Pours nearly black, though it is still slightly see through. Thin of-white head forms at the beginning and offers a good amount of lacing. The nose is nice with some roasted malt and a bit of coffee. There's a touch of licorice there in the background as well. The taste is pretty similar; there's a touch of roast and some light coffee. Mild anise in the background. Fairly tasty, though the finish is a bit too bitter with far too much alcohol for what it's carrying. Pretty good, though the finish was far too harsh."
"Medium bodied with lots of carbonation, this beer fizzes on your tongue and leaves little residue. The carbonation may be a little excessive, but it does allow this beer to be more than a sipper."
"Surprising dark fruitiness for a lager, but I guess sometimes that profile shows in a Baltic Porter. Touch of bittering hops meld with the roast and make it a bit biting on the finish. Light(er) body feels more lager-esque as does a pleasant smoothness. Drinkability is damn good for a 9%'er. This beer grows on you as the ounces pass and is strangely attractive and drinkable. The bomber went down with much ease. Thumbs up, you little Dark Helmet, you."
"Not sure about this one. The grape soda flavor is a bit of a put-off."
"Just a shade lighter the your basic black. Decent enough head on top at first. Rather 1 dimensional aroma. Faintly metallic and sulfury-not a great presence smell wise. Malty flavor dominates-has a very prominant toffeeish/caramel like flavor upfront. Mild grainy and roasted flavors. Just enough hop bite to know it is there. Finish is somewhat sweet. Very smooth and silky body wise,almost ale like, but the clean and crisp character of a lager is there. Very enjoyable and delicious. Has some of the fruity notes of a mild stout or dark ale but still very good and an interesting twist."
"Drinkability: Not bad -- I don't typically drink a lot of lager-styles but this one definitely warrants getting picked up on occasion (if The Brew Kettle continues to make it); it would probably be a little better in the early spring or fall, and at 9% it would need to be a little limited."
"Dark Helmet Imperial Schwarzbier isn't bad beer. Nor is it especially good beer. It's my least favorite of the handful of The Brew Kettle brews that I've had so far."
"Drinkability: Not a poor beer but nothing too special either. For 9% ABV I would want a bit more going on to say it has good drinkability. I find it to be pretty one-dimensional."
"The taste is where the roasted malts show up, but only a little bit. The first thing you can taste is sweet flavors, maybe a little bit of esters too. I could almost place the taste as being more like some Belgian strong dark ales than a dark lager, but that just shows how much overlap there can be between species. The body is a little heavy for the style, but everything on the label prepares you for that. Very good, not just a gimmick."
"An easy drinking brew I finished my glass with no problem and was left wanting for more. A good Schwarzbier, I buy the beer just for the label it's that funny."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a nice smooth medium body. The beer is on the sweeter side but not cloyingly so. This is an easy drinking kicked up brown ale. I wouldnt go so far as to call this a smoked beer. Probably wont be seeing this beer in my glass again."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours brown with a half inch tan head that went away pretty quickly. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, caramel and some coffee. It tastes like dark fruit, roasted malt, coffee, nuts, chocolate and a bit of booze. Mouthfeel/body is low/medium, it does seem a bit thin and has low/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is alright, it is smooth and easy enough to drink. Overall I think this is a decent enough brew. It's not something I would buy all the time, but it's definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is average. Was worried it would be a bit flat based on the appearance, but it's OK. Nice for a change of pace, but not the new holy grail for schwarz lovers."
"Not the best Schwarzbier but worth trying nonetheless. I would like to see more balance. Less sweetness, more roastiness and chocolate notes would improve this beer."
"Drinkability: An example of what lagers can be; not just watered down rice water, but flavorful and nuanced dark beer."
"Sampled May 2008 but I forgot to upload my review and this notebook has been sitting in a suitcase since then."
"Mouthfeel is thin, medium bodied, sugary, and syrupy in the finish."
"Poured a deeper reddish-brown color with a very small sized off white head. Aromas of nuts, roast, and I was getting some dark fruits. Tastes of chocolate, lighter nuttiness, raisins and plums. This one was very sweet. Not cloying, but getting there."
"D- Not all that great not all that bad, if you like sweeter beer with heavy malt and yeast presence here ya go"
"I can see it now... Imperial Schwarzbiers are all the new rage. I was surprised to find that this beer did not fall on a dry stout, porter, brown, or any other heavier concoction. But it does show a strong schwarzbier character, but in an amped up form. Muted aromas with a dry, roasted character makes me beleive that there's not much there. Flavors, on the otherhand, beg to differ. Big, clean roasted notes with a slight touch of fully-attenuated caramel and a hint of lactose. Otherwise, no fruits, fermentation byproducts, phenols, sweetness, or sulfers-- just a crystal clean beer. The body seems higher, but remains chalk-dry with a soft roasted coffee astringency that balanced the beer. Finishes quite the same. The flavors are the same as good schwarzbiers, but the weight is increased-- why not."
"Chocolate malt, a bit of bittersweet chocolate, and a slight roasty component. Medium body, a bit creamy. Very easy to drink."
"Caramel malty mouthfeel with chocolate undertones and bits of dark fruit. Creamy smooth and drinkable"
