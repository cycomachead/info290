"This a great example of the style. Malty, toasty, a tiny hint of smoke, faint bready and sweet malts. Clean crisp dry finish, medium bodied with good carbonation. Refreshing balanced and flavorful. So on point for the style."
"Nice flavor, not too heavy. Very drinkable"

"Pours brown with white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of grassy hops, grain, caramel and bready malt and some black cherries. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of caramel malt, bread crust and herbal hops. Finish is long and herbal, semi-dry. Overall it is good brew, but taste more like Dunkel than Schwarz beer."

"Smelled of some sweet malty notes, roasted grains and coffee I n the background. Tasted much like it smelled and it was quite enjoyable! Would drink this again and considering its so local, gotta love it!!!"

"I tried looking for thier summer rental this year, I'm glad to get the winter rental."
"O- Not bad. A few more IBUs might cut the sweets."

"O - I appreciate the attempt at this style, as there aren't enough good ones domestically. But Winter Rental doesn't have enough to keep me coming back. Would work for those that like the sweetness of a doppelbock without the thick feel."

"Clearly a ""lower tier"" and cheaper brew, but surprisingly good for being such."

"O- Glad I tried it but I probably wouldn't seek it out again. It might be a good beer for when you're snowed in."

"O: Overall easy drinkability, sweet with a nice roastiness, good enough for props, light enough for multiples. Its a schwarz people not a stout, and a pretty good roast backing for one at that."

"I dont really get any hop presence and there is no alcohol to speak of either. The beer is easy to drink, but almost to a fault. Not too much going on here and only the faintest of roast malt on each finish reminds me I am drinking a beer. A little disappointed here, but wasnt expecting to be blown away anyway."
"Overall I might have to see if I can get this again. Possibly fresh next winter release. Not a bad beer overall."
"Pours a dark black with clingy tan foam. Laces. Chocolately malty smell. Some coffee notes. Taste is a light creamy dark malt. Coffee flavored. Very mellow. Little hop bite at the close. Milky. Pretty good beer."

"The pour was as I expected - dark, a bit of head, and nearly no carbonation. There was virtually no lacing here either and this had a pretty thin appearance and taste to it. Lots of pumpernickel and a strong roasted presence to this but both of those faded quickly after each sip. Had this been a bit more creamy, it would have reminded me of an Irish Dry Stout, but there's just not a lot here to remember. This was like a flat soda without the caramel and sugary aftertaste."

"Overall, Winter Rental is an enjoyable beer."
"This poured out as a dark brown color with a fizzy cream colored head on top. The head fades away and leaving just a small foamy ring around the edge of the glass. The smell of the is lightly roasted with the earthy funk of what most lagers have. The taste is malty with some decent toasted notes. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, decent carbonation also. Overall it's not a terrible brew. Its better than I remember it being the first time I had it."

"Picked up a single from the Wegman's in Allentown. It pours a dark brown with a tall off-white head. The body is thicker and creamy, like an oatmeal stout. There's a little roast in the aroma and flavor, a hit of dark fruit, and a mild dry cocoa flavor in the finish. There's a bitter bite in the finish a la Irish stout for a pleasant finish. The mid-flavor is a little bland, the flavors aren't popping, but it's still a tasty beer worth checking out."
"Overall: A decent session beer, nice to have on a cool fall night. As long as you don't grab a bottle of this expecting to get blown away, you will not be dissapointed. Consider this a decent alternative for someone who drinks Newcastle, but wants something a little more mild."

"Like I said before, an awesome winter session beer!"
