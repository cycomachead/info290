"Enjoyed from a 22 oz  bottle in a pint glass.  This fine black lager pours a thick black with a fantastic brown head of dissipating foam that dies down to a thin ring and light lacing.  Nose of chocolate, light smoke, sweet malts, and black raisins.  Flavors are strong sweet up front, a raisin note come through on the rear blending in nicely with the chocolate notes.  This is a seriously slick brew with light carbonation for a lager with a smooth mouth feel that finishes lightly bitter from the malts and lightly bitter hops.  Nice."
"I was highly disappointed by this beer. I didn't really have a lot of expectations, but I didn't expect this. I had the Guinness Black Lager recently, and loved that. So I thought, ""hey, a black lager, this should be good"". But this was way worse. Again, a lot of this is just personal preference, but I just don't like the flavor profile and/or balance of this beer. It's far from terrible. But I think the smokiness is just really out of place in a lager."

"Overall rich, flavorful, and clean—loads of roasted malt and hops. The fairly full texture helps to smooth out the otherwise sharp bite of the roasted malt and hop acidity, though the roastiness is still a bit much. The aroma is wonderfully appetizing. Very tasty and bold on the whole."

"Serving type: bottle."
"Pours a near black with a brown/tan foamy one inch head.  Not much lacing along the glass as you finish.  Smell: dark chocolate, roasted barley, malt, caramel.  Taste is very bitter -- this is not for the faint of heart.  Solid, crisp chocolate bite heavy on the malt.  With all organic ingredients, this is a very complex, interesting beer.  There was a slight sourness in the finish, but I would definitely pick this up again for a great Thanksgiving or Christmas meal."

"O: Obviously, this is not an orthodox schwarzbier, but it is a pretty much exceptional New World take on the style. This lager is proof that Rogue still pumps out worthwhile beers with regularity."

"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Amazing in its opacity, pitch black with no light getting through the murk, capped by a rich cafe latte-colored head. Nose features some very pleasing malt acrobatics, prunes, raisins, dark roast coffee, a whiff of caramel, and some earthy herbal hops. Palate includes all these elements plus some dry chocolate flakes and light ash for good measure, starts sweet and roasty, almost stout-like before going very crisp and dry for the finish, as per the style. Nice creamy mouthfeel adds to the stout-like vibe, as does the low key carbonation. Some noble-type hops add a little pepper and vanilla perhaps. Great stuff and manages to deliver more robust flavors than maybe one would expect from a lager of this ilk. Is is TOO sweet? Perhaps. Here's where I channel my Micheal Jackson-like disregard for uber-rigid style guidelines in favor of just enjoying the show."

"Now, I'll start off by saying I'm not the biggest Rogue fan around, as a matter of fact this is the first beer I've drank of theirs in a few years. With that said, Dirtoir Black Lager is one of the best schwarzbiers I have ever had. It's up there with the likes of Monschof, Black Bavarian, and Duck Rabbit. It drinks more like Duck Rabbit's than the previous two with the weight and boldness. A great beer. Toss this into six packs and I'll be a happy camper."
"What a beer! Well done, Rogue. You still got it."

"This beer was well made and great for those enjoying the doppelbock or even stout styles. The color was intense; motor oil with a deep brown rim. The aromas were malty, bitter cocoa powder, pumpernickel and dark spices. The flavors were similar to the nose (with accentuated rye bread/pumpernickel, and bitter chocolate tones), with a touch more astringency on the finish than I anticipated. This was truly bread in a glass, and is great for someone looking for a well made, malty and thick doppelbock style beer without the intense price tag."

"I enjoyed the flavors of the smell but it was a little muted. Cocoa hides behind dark malt. The taste in the mouth has no such shortcoming, with strong and well balanced flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and full, and I could use another."

"Interesting that roasted malts won the battle against hops, well, otherwise it would be an imperial stout. This is much heavier than a Schwarzbier, still pleasant to drink. Nice that they could get all that flavor out of a lager. Recommendable."

"Overall- This was one tasty brew. It had the right level of bitter hop and sweetness to complement the darker and roastier chocolate and coffee/espresso flavors of the brew. Well done."
""
"Dark and rich, what you would expect from Rogue a tad bit more, a little over the top. Very pleasent beer great hop flavor, you just feel the freshness comeing out of this one. All of the brews in this series are wonderfull hope John comes up with more!"
"Cold 22oz bomber pours jet black with a healthy dark brown head in pint glass. This is seriously dark stuff. Surprising rich malty aroma, even for a schwarzbier. Flavor is fairly hoppy. Hops seems a little muddled...I'm not really familar with Independent and Revelolution. Flavor through the middle is roasty, with more of a burnt aftertaste. Carbonation is relatively light, barely cutting through the (compartively) heavy grain bill. Seriously, I feel like I can taste little particles of nearly ashen roasted barley on my tongue. Of course the beer is too opaque to see if there's actual grain or any other sediment suspended in it. Compared to this, other schwarzbiers are lagers with food coloring added. This is an enjoyable expression of the style."

"Black with little transparancy and an etched dark mirror surface accented by slightly mocha foam. Some soapy bubbles around the perimeter and center. Smells of dry toasted malts, some coffee, some dark cocoa, some soil and a little bit of almond. Nice nose. Taste is dry and toasted with a slight sweetness and a ton of coffee ground and soil character. Medium light bodied with lower carb and an appropriately dry finish. Nice beer, I hate Rogue, but this is a good Schwarzbier."

"this is one of the best beers ive had in awhile. it took me totally by surprise how much i got off on this stuff. it pours jet black, dense looking for a lager, with a tall and lasting coffee colored head of tiny bubbles. the nose is really dark roasted barley, nearly burnt, with notes of coffee and raw black chocolate. its earthy and organic smelling, dank in a way, and more hoppy than i expected, but not quite in the cascadian dark ale range yet (at least as far as the nose goes). the flavor is amazing, it starts off really bitter, like espresso but not acidic, its got a touch of smoke to it, black soil, and then comes the hops, slightly citric, but more bitter than anything, adding a nice compliment to the already dry bitter malt profile. the beer then smoothly but swiftly transitions in a crisp black lager, lighter than its been until now, suddenly being at one refreshing and warming. the heavy cloud has lifted, and the beer finishes like any lager should. what a journey. mouthfeel follows suit, starting heavy as hell, like a massive stout, but it then relaxes to a lager feel, crisp and clean. there is so much flavor brilliantly packed into this beer, which starts sturdy and ends delicately. this may be the best rogue beer ive ever had, and it has inspired me to buy some of the other grow your own series beers from them, as this is simply exquisite. the first beer to blow my mind in a long time. it went expertly with spicy blackbeans and escargots over angel hair. what a gem this is!"

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer worth drinking for while if you’re in the mood for the style but there are other similar beers that I would choose first."
""

"Black Lager pours a black color, with a very small tan head. There is a nice strong malty and coffee aroma. The taste has a nice coffee bite, very full bodied, good malty backbone. Good full flavor, very easy to drink, and would want more. Overall a fantastic example of this style, a must try."
"Taste: Roastiness right off the bat. Followed by the mocha and chocolate right behind it. Little mixes of oatmeal and coffee grains. Very smooth mouthfeel but not really heavy at all. Super easy drinker. Being a big fan of stouts I like having something easy to drink like this in between to have. Great job."

"overall, i like it. it's heavy, and i was expecting a MUCH LIGHTER brew (it says LAGER, for dog's sake...) , but there really hasnt been a LOT of beers i dont like, so maybe beer tasting really isnt my thing. but i WONT drink BUD, so i do have some class."
""
"Rogue's Ditroir Black Lager disappointed me. It is a very nice beer, but fails to compare with others in both the Schwarzbier style and beers with similarly dark, roasted flavors in Rogue's line. Give Dirtoir Black Lager a try. Then treat yourself to a bottle of Rogue's Chocolate Stout. You'll see what I mean, and I doubt you'll pick up another bottle of the former. I know I won't."

"slight astringency on the back end with lingering roasted malt and smoke flavor."

"O- Great beer! Rogue has never disappointed me, not once. I would definitely recommend trying this out, and I know I am looking forward to the other two beers in their Chateau series! Worth the buy, hands down."
"The mouth is creamy smooth and heavier than I’d like. This is really odd for a Schwarzbier. Not as easy-drinking as expected. Really big flavors of chocolate, roasted malts. These flavors are usually nice and mellow with this style, but this is just way too ‘big.’ Imperial Schwarz? Glad I tried this, but this isn’t what I’d reach for when in the mood for this, one of my favorite styles. A miss for me."

"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours black with a dark brown head with good retention, leaving lacing. Light roasted and sweet malt chocolate aroma. Flavor dominated by very roasted malts. Burnt chocolate, coffee and a bitter middle taste with lingering non-hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Interesting, but could use some balance. A good schwarzbier."
""
"Overall it tastes OK but in my opinion is FAR from anything that in the Lager style of beer. Seems the brewer went all EXTREME on this beer and made an Oatmeal Stout out of a Schwartzbier."
""
"Pretty nice Schwartz here. Don't think I could drink it all myself. Thanks for the try TATURBo."

"Note to self: Ranked #2 Top Beers - Schwarzbier when I tried it."
"The taste is just good, but not great. Where the earthiness and soy come in, they replace some sweetness, like Jolly Rancher candy, that some/most German schwarzbiers give me. Not that this is bad. Just different. And it's good. Quite good"

"22fl oz bottle. Mahou Pokal glass. Enjoyed on dec´11. Pours dark mahogany, dark copper to the light. Beige .medium size bubbled,creamy foam. Thick layer crown.Lasting with copious rings. Toasted,not burnt,malts, hints of black chocolate to the nose. Dry malts at first sip.Slightly smoked in the middle. Gentle dry & malty palate.Very soft bitterness.Medium body, flavorful. Medium carbonation. Refreshing & pleasant drinkability.An incredible malty beer with an outstanding malty balance."

"I keep thinking I'm rating this too high but damnit, this was a surprising beer to me and one that blew my socks off. I'm a sucker for intense roasty goodness in beers and this one brings that more than most. I am oh so grateful that I decided to buy this beer. Great job, Rogue!"
""
""
"In my notes I wrote “blacklight safe,” but I think this refers to something on the tap handle perhaps? Although it did pour a solid, roasty black with some light showing through so maybe that’s what I meant. Anyways, there’s a great roasty malt aroma on this with some chocolate notes. Flavor is all about the dark chocolate and roast. There’s a sharp hop bite with a malty roundedness and a smooth finish that ends sweet. It warms well, and remains pleasing throughout. You know what? I liked it."

"O - Not bad, it's an intriguing beer. I love stouts and this kept my attention."
""
"O - This is a schwarzbier that I'd certainly come back to again. With the inclusion of smoky, nutty, and chocolate flavors/aromas, this beer is unique for the style, but a very good offering for sure. Rogue did a nice job with this beer, which leads me to wonder what sort of creations other respected American brewers could offer in this underappreciated style."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black with a nice 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with nice retention that reduces to a minimal cap eventually. Not much lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, charcoal, smoked meat, wood, coffee, caramel, dark roasted malt, vanilla, and some herbal hops. Wow, nice aromas here that threw me for a loop. I was not expecting to be hit in the face with smokiness. Taste of big dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, smoke, wood, caramel, nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Decent bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, smoke, and caramel on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and body; with a highly creamy, lush, and smooth mouthfeel for a 6% beer. Hardly any alcohol present other than a slight warming after the finish. Very drinkable stuff; and it is also very robust in flavor for the gravity. Overall this is an outstanding schwarzbier; with a very robust flavor profile, and easy smooth drinking. Definitely surprised me with the smokey profile at first though."
""
"O- A very tasty dark beer that I wouldn't mind having a few of. Worth a try."
""
""
"Overall-- it's probably a nice refresher beer. It's lighter falvorand body make it easier to enjoy..."
"Pours a very dark brown with off white khaki colored head and lace. Aroma of roasted, smokey malts and a coffee like presence. In the taste, upfront are roasted malts and a twang from the hops and smoke. Mild citrus notes beneath some coffee, cocoa and smoke. A small alcohol presence is noted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low carbonation. Overall, a half decent schwarz but next year would probably be better."
""
"Overall: a very drinkable dark beer; the lager yeast really smooths and balances things."
"Pours a dark black color with a smallish tan head the leaves good lacing. The taste is somewhat fruity with some coffee and chocolate overtones with additional spiciness. The sweetness is due to heavy dark roasted malts with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is medium to full. It looks like a Stout, but tastes more like a heavy Porter. There could be some oak flavor in the background."
""
"A very tasty schwarzbier with emphasis on the smoked and roasted malt flavors. The bitterness, tanginess, and other components blend well with the sweetness. The only thing I'd like to change would be the body's low weight and its carbonation. Regardless, one that I keep returning to when I see it."

"A bit chocolatey for a traditional schwarzbier, but I'm not complaining. Quite tasty and very interesting, with the smoky and earthy notes. Not something I'd go for all the time, but I would definitely buy it again-I liked this one a lot."
"Overall -- Solid American Schwarzbier. Leans toward the chocolate malt spectrum, which I prefer. Surprisingly good for how old this bottle probably is."
"O: This is a damn fine schwarzbier if I do say so myself. Enough characteristics to show that it's a dark lager and not a stout or porter yet enough taste and flavor to make it great. I'd recommend this one for sure"
"Note: Until I read the BA reviews for this beer, I was pretty sure that the bar mixed up the taps and this was the Rogue Chocolate Stout; I'm glad it was not, but boy are those 2 beers similar. Luckily both are quite tasty even though they are completely different styles. A very good beer that I was glad to stumble upon."
"Overall: not too bad. More of a stout than a lager. Not getting the lager yeast."
"O-one and done on this one,just was not impressed was very thin"
"Tastes like a watery stout, smells like chocolatey porter."
"O: One of the better American versions of a schwarzbier, even though it doesn't really taste like one."
" Rich roasted malts and a smoky sort of peat like smell coming through off of this one right way. Very rich with a touch of bitterness-hidden way in the back, I had a feeling this was going to be good now. Very nice earthy and grassy touches throughout as well, with a touch of molasses maybe as it warms up. Rich chocolate like flavor almost coming through in the beginning and then turning over to a more roasted and smoke like flavor. Lots of different earthy tones here were coming together rather nicely. A touch of caramel or molasses like sweetness in the middle and some of the bittering effects in it towards the end. The finish was quick and clean with a nice smoke flavor in the finish, albeit lighter then what you would typically think of a smoked flavor being."
"Overall: A slow drinker, but very hearty. Several people around me agreed that this one would go great with a steak."
"O: An interesting brew, especially considering the “Grow Your Own” theme; I’d definitely have it again, although I wouldn’t have more than a couple in one sitting."
"O: The beer is packed with interesting flavors and is very easy to drink because it isn’t very filling or high in alcohol content. This is a fine example of the style if you are looking for a sessionable dark lager."
"o - good beer overall and one i'd go to again. kudos to rogue for gyo."
"O- Somewhat disappointing although I do commend them for the GYO dedication on this brew. This bottle could have been a little old as well adding to the lack of hops in the flavor."
"O: Overall it's a good beer, but I felt it could have used a unique character to identify itself. With the body and flavor as strong as it was, I'm surprised it's only 6% ABV. I would drink it again, but I probably wouldn't buy it. It's just to average of a beer to crave."
"O- I like this beer, creamy body with nice roasted malts. pretty good alround."
"O - recommended for fans of schwarzbier who also like an imperial stout: This schwarzbier heads in that direction."
"From a bomber with no date into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!). This one is engine oil black with a thin, dark brown cap that fades at a moderate pace to a thin ring. Very nice looking dark brew. Nose is sweet to very sweet, with lots of chocolate/smoky notes. Toasted malt and burnt toast, powdery cocoa, hints of coffee. In the mouth, it’s not nearly as sweet as the nose advertises. There’s a definite burnt character, and flavor is surprisingly dry compared to nose. Hints of mild coffee with dark chocolate bitterness. Firm but not overwhelming; enjoyable. Mouth is a bit thin and watery, bubbly, and quenching. Overall, looks and smells great, though a bit underwhelming taste. Overall good for style. Tasty and quenching, traditional. Not an “extreme” beer by any stretch, but good overall."
"O - another great brew from Rogue, the richness of flavour really drives this one home"
"One of the better beers of this style that I've had."
"Good, but not stunning. Perhaps I expected something different."
"I think the style is more inline with a Baltic Porter."
"O- If you are expecting a traditional schwarzbier, you'll be dissapointed. But if you can adjust your mindset on the fly, and perhaps pretend that you are drinking a coffee porter or imperial stout, you'll like it more. Above average beer."
"Very easy drinking beer, it's definitely thin, but I feel like I could have had six or seven glasses at the bar, it pours with limited carbonation and is dark as the style would indicate. I had it next to the Left Hand TNT, which was outrageous in style and smell, making this beer seem quite bland, but, again it was pretty good for the style. I wouldn't go out my way to have it again."
"It carried a rich mouthfeel - very nice with ample carbonation."
"This is a better than average beer, it just doesn't blow me away like I expected based on its look and smell."
"This poured a jet black, motor oil like color into a standard pint glass, and showed a most remarkable black/tan head several fingers thick. Its smell was sugary like ripe fruit, and its taste was clearly heavier than your typical lager. There were noticeable tones of dark chocolate, raisen, and perhaps plum with a touch of smoked cherry. This made me think it would be an ideal winter sipper as it has lots of charm. Its mouthfeel felt flat across the front of my tongue, with a mellow hop finish. This really is a unique product, and I suggest you try it if you enjoy a porter or dark lager."
"Overall this was a decent brew."
"Outstanding beer."
"All in all a very nice beer that I would drink again."
"O - Overall a little disappointing. Nothing spectacular or overly memorable, though not to be interpreted as offensive. Some more bold flavours could enhance this offering, though given the style, I would suspect it captures the the flavours well."
"By far my favourite ""Chatoe."""
"O - Good taste and pretty drinkable with a relatively low ABV. Not too filling either."
"Very clean taste. The grains were well balanced between malty sweetness, and a gently roasted flavor. The hops play a subtle support role in rounding this delicious brew. Mouthfeel is on the medium/thin side, with assertive carbonic sharpness."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-/C"
"Pours out an oily black with a crazy charcoal/brown head which is thick and bubbly. Chocolate nose with a dark fruitiness some figs and raisins along with a lot of earthy hops. Some dirt with a good amount of roast.A lot of dry dark roast. Chocolate and roasted barley. A fruity and roasted middle with an extremely dry finish. For how it pours out the body is extremely light. It is an interesting combination of heavy chocolate and roasted malt characteristics with such a light body. More of the dry and roasted notes pop out and the hops are less subdued than with a heavier body."
"22 oz from ""Habits"" in S.Salem. $4.89 I am going to ggive this a perfect ""5" for appearance..it is a thing of beauty , a work of art. Deepest obsidian body with a largeish frothy,thick,bubby tan head. Aroma is nice a deep and malty,dark chocolate,toffee,toasty, very nice. Taste very smooth yet great esspresso coffee bitterness, slightly nutty with a touch of cream, then a little buzz from piney hops.More roast than the aroma. Delicious. Excellent palate to this one..thick but smooth, the hops break it up a bit at the end and prevent too much ""coating"". One of the best beers I have had from Rogue in years."
"O: Pretty good for the style, and I really like that Rogue finally has some beer that I know is fresh, despite the fact that this doesn't have a bottling date anywhere except that I know my local store just got it in in 2011."
"O - I would not have pinned this as a Schwarzbier but anywho it was pretty good...this bottle was shared with two people and we all seemed to enjoy it...I liked the addition of the hops because they made for an enjoyable finish...the chocolate was a strong characteristic"
"this would be great during a transatlantic journey on a steamship. or if you hunt."
"Pours a jet black color with a khaki colored two finger head that stays and leaves very nice lacing. The aroma is of dark chocolate and bread along with a hint of fruits. The taste has a roasted malt backbone along with a toasty backbone, on the top are hints of chocolate, coffee, and the marzen yeast, while at the very end their is a hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly creamy. Overall it is very solid, the nose is just slightly weak, but the flavors are very complex and well balanced. The beer is also a very easy drink, this is one to recommend."
"D: Reminiscent of a German lager and American porter fused together, Dirtoir is a nice hybrid brew that satisfies both parties at a robust 6% ABV. Not your typical scwartzbier, but still a very nice black lager."
"D: I drain poured this beer a couple of sips in and I decided to open something else. I seem to not like the style, for some reason."
"Taste is quite a bit more delicate than expected after the robust appearance and smell. Brilliant blend of malty flavors ranging from roasty to toasty to chocolate. Maybe I like it because it is a Rogue beer without the signature Pacman yeast? Just enough bitterness to clean up the finish nicely. I have thoroughly enjoyed both of the First Growth beers I have had from a brewery I typically am not a big fan of. Kudos!"
"D: This beer reminds me that I need to pay more attention to dark lagers. I forget how much I enjoy them!"
"Grow Your Own, bitches!"
"D - Quite a drinkable beer."
"D - This beer is light and very drinkable. Good taste, not too heavy, not too strong. I could definately see myself buying another one of these in the future."
"Overall this is a good beer, a lot different than I remember it being in the bottle, but still enjoyable. This is by far one of the most flavorful schwartzbiers I have ever had; totally dominates any German variety out there. Definitely the highlight of the Chatoe series."
"D: Fantastically sessionable. Went through the 4 pint without any trouble what so ever. My first of this beer style, and I must say i'm impressed as a ""lightweight"" stout."
"Opinion: Well, this is a really nice tasting beer, but it doesn't really come close to a Schwarzbier. Typically this style will be clear with a reddish tint and an almost white head and tons of toasty Munich notes. This beer is really clean, but the dark malt profile is more reminiscent of a Porter than a Schwarzbier. It is a GOOD porter and probably too clean for that actual style with the Lager yeast that was used in this beer. I don't know. Try it for yourself and see what you think. It is a good drinker, but not very German."
"i agree with a previous reviewer that this crosses into porter territory with it's abundance of characteristics screaming thus. very tasty brew nonetheless and definitley recommended!!"
"D: a good brew overall, but hardly a Schwartzbier."
"Overall, the drinkability of this beer is outstanding. Nice balance and overall feel to the beer. Lots of character and flavor that seems to be blended together just right. ABV is moderate, so no need to split a bomber with this one. 2 thumbs up."
"This beer definetly crosses style borders a couple of times. The yeast almost seems to be the only reason this beer could be considered a lager."
"Over the years, my fondness for Rogue beers has slowly been eroded by a lot of mediocre products. However, it's a beer like this that reminds me that there is still a very capable brewer at Rogue, and that they know how to make good beer. This is pretty impressive."
"I will say I have had nothing quite like this in my life, though I have never quested for the schwarzbiers before. That will change after this enjoyable experience. Thank you once again Rogue!"
"Taste begins with the same dark maltiness, a slight acrid flavor in the middle, and closes with some coffee character. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is oh-so easy. One of my favorite of the style so far."
"After only one try this is in the running for the best beer I've ever had. Fantastic. I love it."
"Pours black in body with everlasting coffee head. Roast, dirt, and hops in the nose. Tastes of milk chocolate, earth, hop dryness and tang towards the end. Remarkably smooth in mouthfeel with light carbonation. A tasty black lager that is light in body and easy drinking."
"I got a foamy two fingers' worth of deep-tan head off of my pour that slowly fell, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. Nose was chocolaty with some smoke and charcoal, also. Color was an inky black, I do not think even dark-brown fits into this equation with ZERO light penetration. None, not even on the sides or at the edges. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a taste like dark chocolate, very roasty, lightly smoky on the tongue. Finish was likewise chocolaty, slightly smoky. Now, I want one of those fudgy brownies that I passed up at the Holiday luncheon on Wednesday ..."
"A jet black brew with a decent light chocolate colored head and good lacing. The aroma is decidedly coffee and chocolate malt, sweet and bitter, nicely blended. The flavor gets into the same idea as the aroma with a little less chocolate and more into the coffee bitterness. It's medium bodied with subtle carbonation, tingly and a bit of a charcoal dryness, almost a smokey overtone. It has a sort of ""green"" quality, a sharpness that bites a little. Medium drinkability. A quality brew for sure."
"Overall, this is a solid beer but has some room for improvements in a few key areas. Quite drinkable and worth the purchase, but I don't know how many more of these I would have."
"Overall decent beer. Porters and stouts are not really my thing and this beer reminds me of them. Nice light beer for the winter months though if you like these sorts of beer."
"Drinkability: This is heaven in a bottle. Nice combination of flavors. Typically I don't like lagers, but this is pretty drinkable."
"D:  there is a slight astringent quality from the roasted malt that hurts the drinkability but overall this is a solid beer. In fact it has made me rethink trying rogue's other offerings, which I have typically been avoiding."
"This is a rich and complex tasting beer good for one or two at a time to savor."
"VERY dark in color...almost surprisingly so. A ""Schwarz"" bier through and through. A good looking thin brown head that does not stick around as I hoped it would... instead it dissipates rather quickly. A faint smell of roasted barley. A delicious black rye bread taste with the slightest trace of hops. Mouthfeel was a bit thicker than I expected for the schwarzbier style. Overall a very drinkable schwarzbier but a bit heavier than most."
"Tasty, drinkable, and a great concept."
" D- The big layered stout is a nice hardy beer but it has a bit to much roasted bitterness and sour notes to drink this as a session beer. It is not your typical schwarzbier but it has some nice black roast qualities. I actually think some age might help the beer mellow but I'm a bit worried that the sour band-aid flavor might get worse."
"This is one hell of a fantastic Schwarz, but that might just be because it tastes a lot more like a porter than your traditional black lager, and I (and most people) seem to like porters more than blacks. But whatever. It's traditionally brewed, reasonably priced, and delicious."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a lot of roast in the back. There is a strong aftertaste / late taste of coffee that comes in after the swallow like an avalanche. Its creamy and nice, its got some really nice flavors in there, no real sweetness. Its a good beer."
"Pours black with a nice dark brown head and a very nice amount of lacing. Nose is very nice--plenty malty with a good amount of roast. Some dark chocolate and coffee come through along with some hops. Taste is quite similar with a bit more hoppiness coming out. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth with good carbonation. Quite tasty and went down easily."
"As to the hype about ""grow your own"" malt and hops, I suppose someone crass, such as myself, might wonder if a byproduct of this would be cutting out the supplier and keeping production cost down? Just a thought."
"mouthfeel is a little light for my taste but drinkability as pretty nice. I could put a few of these back real easy."
"D: this is an excellent beer with a very diverse flavor profile that is heavy but not overbearing, get some."
"D - Not hard to drink but I won't have another. Not close to a session brew for me."
"A tasty drop but it comes across a little harsh in places."
"Pour from bottle into snifter. Nose is heavy coffee and malt, taste is the same. Thin, rust-colored head that recedes into some lacing; a more aggressive pour is needed for head. Completely opaque body. Very little carbonation for a smooth but almost blank mouthfeel. The flavor itself is smooth; bitter but not overpoweringly so, even on the hoppier aftertaste. Quite drinkable for something this dark and thick/heavy tasting."
"One of several beer birthday gifts from my wife a from May. Poured it into a Duvel Tulip glass. This was by far the best looking schwartzbiers I've ever had. It pours out pitch black, much like a heavy looking Russian Imperial Stout or Double Stout. The darkness consumes the glass, no highlights can be seen. The beer produces an insanely big dark brown colored head, initially it looks like some pretty good lacing, but it doesn't really stick around that much, it leaves a ring around the top. The initial pour comes up big and almost produces like a nitro type effect. The smell is good, much of it smells like dark malts, slight hints of dark chocolate and coffee. Not as much of a hop presence as I expected, but present and accounted for, earthy/spicy. The taste is good, I feel as if it is a little more complex than the smell. Big dark malts again, dark chocolate and black coffee. Hops are a bit stronger, they blend nicely, still a bit earthy. Call me crazy, but I detect a smokey flavor that I didn't notice in the smell, maybe some peat or a German smoke malt. The mouthfeel is incredibly excellent. It's a full bodied big feel, yet at the time it's both soft and smooth. Slight bitter finish at the end, I'm digging it. Drinkability is good. I'm liking this beer more and more as I drink it. I thought I read somewhere that the ABV was around 9 but it's only 6. I might have had it sooner if I had known that. When it was cold the hops weren't as noticeable so I'm wondering if they dulled out at all over the last 3 months. Nevertheless I really liked it, very good beer clearly quality ingredients"
"D. Easy drinking. Is more stout like for me than black lager. Must be the only thing that distinguishes it is the lager yeast. This is a good easy drinking beer."
"a chocolate earth molasses coffee lean feel with a nice creamy body. this beer looks like a porter and feels one but doesn't have the heaviness. nose is all that with a mild citrus pine that broadness to an nice apple as it warms to room temp. palate is a nice balance and a floral palate cleanser that mixes very well. a great feel that has a body that replenishes itself."
"Chatoe Rogue First Growth Dirtoir Black Lager is yet another wonderful brew from one of America's best breweries and is one of the finest schwarzbiers that I've consumed in many a moon. Drink it now while the hops still have some kick."
"D: A rich roasty treat that was still surprisingly smooth and silky going down. Big flavor with a bomber that will leave you satisfied. Worthy of a purchase."
"Very good for the style, if you want to call it a schwarzbier."
"D- Great to drink all night. Not overpowering, yet full enough to satisfy"
"Supremo! Poured with a lovely large foamy frothy brown head that subsides quickly and a little lace. Nose is quite roasty malt nutmeats licorice leather tree bark. Color is opaque black with very slight brown highlights. Flavor is like aroma but with a bit of acid. Great body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and lasts for a while. Easy drinking session beer."
"Good stuff -- I always find that barnyard character intriguing, & find it here in force. May have something to do with the ""dirtoir"" thing & the freshness of the ingredients, who knows? One or two is fine."
"This is a very tasty schwarzbier with reassuring, feel-good politics behind it (sustainable, estate-grown hops and malts). This beer is worth buying not only for the statement but for its deliciousness."
"Purchased a bottle on Friday night to drink with a friend. Poured into two stemmed glasses. Probably the blackest colored beer outside of a stout that I have seen in a long time. Big thick tan formed. Smell was intense and inviting. Had the smell of roasted coffee, campfire embers, peaty malt scotch, and potting soil. We both couldn't stop smelling it and rattling off something else we each smelled. Taste was just as delicious. Very intense bitter dark chocolate, espresso, molasses, and brown sugar were flavors that I detected. Mouthfeel was much more thicker than I was expecting. It left lager territory and was borderline porter. Thick and creamy on the palate. This was a great beer to drink with a friend, and I could have easily drank this myself. I really like what Rogue created here."
"It's an Americanized flavorful roasty dark black lager, not the average Schwarzbier by an means go and seek this one. Dark bitter roasts may seem more stout/porter like than the average watery Kostritzer Schwarzbier but an awesome experience nonetheless. I enjoyed my sample with my bro, who's a dark beeradvocate at heart."
"Good dry taste, very comparable to Black Butte, but maybe a little more bitter and that dry aspect big time. Good roasting. Hops play well, if you like black ipas, you'll prolly be more than down with this. Call it a winter beer, but this would seem quite enjoyable any time of year. Nice mismarked price in WY where I got this . . ."
"D-quite nice; it really is a nice alternative for winter beers as in the style description, but its nice anytime of the year"
"I love the concept, but love the beer even more."
"Loved this beer overall. I think the GYO aspect was really awesome and Rogue did a great job. One of my favorites from this brewery and this beer was very reasonably priced. This is up there and possibly tied with their Mocha Porter offering (which was my favorite Rogue beer prior to this experience)"
"Served from 22 oz bottle into Ommegang Flute. Pours as black as can be with a two finger tan head. The aroma is comprised of malts and a slight hint of coffee. The flavor of this brew has a nice malty flavor with subtle hints of coffee and with a slightly bitter aftertaste when swallowing. This brew has a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. There is minimal lacing throughout. Overall this is a very nice low intensity flavor for a black lager. It is easy to drink and very enjoyable. This is a very nice brew by Rogue. Definitely worth a shot if you have the opportunity."
"i recommend it."
"and a ABV to work with. But for 8.99 i'll have to limit the session drinking for now."
"M/D - Thin mouthfeel but appropriate. Slight residual sweetness but again nice. Ends strong with coffee and leaves a nice taste on the tongue. Easy to drink, slightly sneaky considering mouthfeel vs. abv."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is medium full. This beer is deep, rich and full of flavor. This beer is wonderful and very tasty. I am very glad I got to drink it. This is my second favorite Rouge beer."
"Split a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer with a couple friends. All agree this was a thoroughly tasty beer. For the most part, it reminded me more of a porter, but a great one at that. The flavor, in addition, to the bready cocoa notes also had an unusual earthy spice that I really enjoyed and set this apart. I just wish the body was a touch light to make this more drinkable."
"Wonderful shwartzbier, sent by Presario. Pours beautiful black, looks thick, crowned by a small white head. Very roasty aroma. Slightly malty, roasted coffee-ish, chocolate taste. Above average mouthfeel. Satisfying, good moderate maltiness that aids drinkability."
"Another great Rogue stout made with a lager yeast -- will probably drink it again, especially as I'd like to support the Grow Your Own cause, but I wish it was even a little bigger up front and a little cleaner in the finish."
"Medium body with light carbonation. Pretty decent all around, but probably not something I'd be looking for again. Still was worth trying at least once."
"This isn't a beer I could drink a lot of or often but it is an interesting and enjoyable beer. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is good. Most dark beers just come on heavier than this one. A lot of flavors for such an easy drinking beer. Thanks to all the BA's who advised me to go with this one based on my food pairing--grilled chicken shish-ka-bobs with onions, peppers, pineapples, tomatoes."
"D: OK. Like I said, I didn't think the flavors melded all that well, and there was too much smoke and char. Glad I had the chance to try it (a friend brought over the bottle), but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Poured jet black. This is about as dark as any beer I have ever had. Had nice fluffy brown head that lasted a long time. Very smooth and pleasant mouthfeel. Has an earthy, smoky flavor to it. Nice aroma as well. This is a well-crafted beer that I enjoyed. Drinkability is pretty high."
"Medium body with crisp, airy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall an easy-drinking beer with lots of flavor and complexity going on. Basically the drinkability of a lighter lager with the complexity and robustness of a stout."
"All in all, a decent beer that I'm glad to have tried. I appreciate brewers like Rogue that have the guts to experiment like this!"
"D-highly drinkable in one of my favorite styles"
"Not bad at all. Certain aspects just don't come together all that well for me though. Like the odd mineral character. Though worth a try if you see it."
"D: A boldly roasty, flavorful schwarzbier from Rogue. Color me impressed. Despite the firm flavors, this drinks very well and is quite smooth. I was skeptical since I'm not typically a huge fan of Rogue beers, but this is worth picking up."
"A very interesting beer- my first schwarzbier. From a beer drinking perspective, its light body and drinkability are surprising. From a coffee drinker's perspective. it is exactly as black coffee flavored and slightly bitter as I would expect."
"Rogue is a great brewery but I haven't been impressed with their First Growth series."
"This is certainly a beer where the bite was worse than the bark. Based on the color and smell alone, I was expecting a truly astounding schwarzbier. However, what I got was a slightly ill-conceived rendition of the European style that still has some obvious rounding-out to do. It might be highly drinkable if you're a fan of the style and can stomach the weirder sour-bitter flavor near the front but for me, this just didn't quite work. Sometimes, a special edition beer is a good thing-you won't have to see it around for very long."
"D - Good overall. If not for the chalky and overly sweet feel, would be great."
"Any time is the right time for this black beast."
"An interesting and laudable foray by Rogue's DIY, GYO, whatever it's called venture - they can be proud of another West Coast brewing effort taken to an unexpected extreme. This time, they really, really put the schwarz in schwarzbier - there's just gotta be a Spaceballs joke in there somewhere."
"D - This may be my favorite Rogue beer at the moment, and I'm looking forward to seeing how their GYO system progresses. I think this is very nicely balanced and easy to drink. The relatively modest ABV makes this sessionable."
"Easy to drink with a nice roasted malt flavor for such a light bodied beer. Personally I'd rather have a porter or stout with more robust body when in the mood for a darker beer though."
"I was pleased with this beer, I was surprised by how dark it was right out of the bottle and It was full of favor. This was a perfect beer for this chilly spring day"
"D - This beer is more akin to a Porter than a Lager. The lighter finish makes it more drinkable than a normal dark beer."
"Drinkability - excellent session beer for cooler temps, I'd imagine. I love a roasty malty beer like this that isn't overly sweet or high in abv."
"Pours out really black with very small bubbles and 1 finger of tan creamy suds sit on the top. Lacing clings nicely as you sip the beer, and sticks to the mustache (save for later) As the suds subside I smell dark chocolate and creamy, burnt malt and a slight smokey aroma. While there is some dark fruit, it's the yeast that burns the nose. No alcohol detected here. Taste is coffee and bitter charred malt. No alcohol here. While this could be a tad bit sweeter and less one-sided , it still has a great flavor. Mouth feel is clean and refreshing. Rogue Rocked another one."
"i'm loving the sustainability behind this beer. it's just not one of the best beers i've ever had."
"Dark brown bordering on black in color. The big and bubbly mocha head slowly dissipates. Some random-sized spots of lace are left behind. Smells of sweet chocolates, yeast and some vegetal notes. Tastes a bit grassy and malty with some floral hops in the back. The chocolate notes are by degrees more obvious to the nose than on the palate, and move toward the bitter end of the spectrum. A little woodiness exists in the aftertaste. Has a light to medium body and goes down a little creamy. Good stuff all around."
"D: I love the idea behind this brew...GYO. It has good sessionability, but not sure it maintains my interest for very long. I like this style of beer and am glad Rogue gave it a shot."
"D= Excellent beer. Really tasty and unique. I enjoyed the hell out of this beer just because it's clean flavor. Nice work Rogue."
"Pours a surprisingly opaque black with the darkest tan head I've yet seen, which lingers for quite some time. The nose is chocolate, soil, coffee, and a bit of florality. The taste is pretty similar, with the chocolate and coffee really coming through, along with a slight bit of bitterness. The body is a very light medium, with a nice kiss of carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a surprisingly great schwarz that stands as very highly drinkable."
"Everything is great about this beer, but the way that it finishes so blandly takes a big chunk of the enjoyment away for me. Overly carbonic and acidic, taking away from a lot of really great stuff going on."
"Poured a black color with good carbonation and a tannish head. Nose is smoke, dar, bitter cocoa. hops. Taste is immediate smoke, and very subtle smoke, with cocoa, big dose of hops and very tasty. Mouthfeel id hearty with hops, smoke, cocoa and some coffee weighing in. Very good indeed."
"I hadn't had a Rogue beer in a while, but when I saw this I knew I had to try it. And I'm glad I did."
"This is a deeply satisfying and rich Stout made with Lager yeast. This is quite enjoyable and better than I was expecting."
"Unusual dark roastiness for a schwarzbier. Actually, this is more like a stout brewed with lager yeast. Strange, but enjoyable."
"D - Quite drinkable and a somewhat darker than normal malt character for the style. There is significant roast character in the aroma, both coffee and chocolate. The flavor is roasty as well, though a bit more mild in terms of roast and with a total lack of the chocolate character from the aroma. A nice beer overall, it comes a little closer to being a lagered stout than a true Schwarzbier, but it is well made and very enjoyable."
"I was quite excited to grab one for rainy day, relaxing in the man-cave-keller-record library...and it definitely did not disappoint! A viscous black pour into a nonic pint glass resulting in a solid black appearance with thin reddish dark tan head that stuck as lace in a minimal way. The aroma lent towards a smoked or rauchbier style, as well as dark coffee and a hint of lemon hop. The flavor was a near-burnt smoky malt with black coffee, dark chocolate and bit of hop to round it out. Not on the sweeter end of schwarzbiers/black lagers. Nice body & mouthfeel with presence of alcohol, but not overwhelming or distracting. Hearty sipper that did not push any extreme...nicely balanced."
"This poured a nearly opaque black with moderate dark tan head. It smelled like roasted barley and smoke and burnt coffee and dark chocolate, with a little lemon. It tasted like burnt barley and smoke and charred mocha, with a little copper hops. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter smoky aftertaste. Overall this was the perfect schwarzbier, for my tastes. It had a great smoky profile that was bold but not overwhelming (like rauchbiers). It had a very nice full body too, and was pretty easy to drink. Maybe a little harsh for some drinkers, or maybe not entirely true to the history of the style, but I loved this beer."
"D- Slightly rich, but very enjoyable. For the ABV, this is a bit of a sipper. Highly recommended."
"Enjoyable take on the style for a newcomer!"
"Like this one...very stout like less some hops"
"Solid and drinkable."
"Drinks fairly easy, roastyness slows me down a bit. Started reminded me more of a stout as time went on, so I believe this strays a touch too much for me style-wise, but a easily sessionable none the less. A nice stab at the style that only had some minor flaws"
"Another interesting brew from Rogue that ive been looking forwards to trying,it pours a jet cola hue with nice carbonation that leaves a chocolate/mocha coloured one finger head and some subtle lacing,the aroma is unbelievable almost like you have walked into a coffee shop it is that strong just a roasty expresso smell that oozes fresh coffee and one of the strongest i have encountered very impressive,it has a nice easy mouthfeel which is very sessionable and just slides down with beautiful hints of mocha,cappicino and dark,dark expresso and finishes nice with that touch of bitterness that makes you reach for another taste straight away,overall this brew is almost like a coffee beer that i really rate and if you havnt tried it,like coffee and see it i definately recommend you give it a shot as it is a top quality brew."
"drinkability: i absolutely love the concept of estate ales. massive props to the people at rogue for making this beer from scratch and providing me and others with a product that is all natural and affordable as well as great tasting. i bought two bombers tonight and i am feelin great."
"MF/DK: Quite dry. Some ghostly acidity. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Lingering roasted bitterness. A little acrid I might add as well. Maybe at titch much of the black patent?? Solid overall though."
"D-High. I definitely didn't have a problem finishing the bottle."
"D: very easy to drink, especially since its not thick like i was thinking it might be."
"Royal black, opaque in fact, with dark brown head. Nose is a whollop of lovely roasted malts. On the palate this beer comes across more like a true dark & bittersweet chocolate than any other in recent memory. Loads of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Finish isn't too sweet, yet plenty of roasty bitter dark chocolate to take away with you."
"Drinkability: I am usually left a bit disappointed from Rogue, but this one is a big winner. Very good for the style and super drinkable. I had no idea this was six abv and could have several. Nice, good, and clean. Not the most complex beer but one that is executed excellently."
"Pours a deep dark black with a thick and beautiful chocolate milk colored head. Powerful aromas and flavors of dark chocolate and espresso. The concentration and intensity of these two notes is remarkable, but not overwhelming. A strong black coffee flavors lingers long after swallowing, practically penetrating my pores. One of the very best schwarzbiers I've had."
"D: Off the charts. Finishes a little dry like a stout but not as filling and extremely quaffable. A great example of a schwarzbeer."
"D: A bit extra roasty for my taste, considering the lager characteristics allow for much less esters and such. Other than that though, a very refreshing beverage."
"Post script: I appreciate Rogue's attempt at a Terroir take on beer."
"D - a roasty delight. Close to Shakespeare stout -- another Rogue favorite."
"Magnificently pouring beer: I decanted the bottle into a tall pint glass... at first, the surface was milky smooth during the pour, but then a colossal inch and half thick head formed on top of tannish-brown foam. It's fading now but leaving excellent lacing. The aroma is good but not very assertive, with a sweet, bready, very lightly toasted scent. Excellent flavor, offering a bready taste of sharp, bitter dark chocolate, some notes of coffee, and bitterness on the high side of moderate. Lingering malt after the finish. Tasty. The body is a bit thin and watery, but otherwise, a quite decent beer."
"Overall, I like this beer quite a bit and wish I had access to this one... I know this is a limited one but it's a killer offering from Rogue... I love this one..."
"Drinkability is pretty nice. Better than average but not amazing, I think. Hoppy dark beers are something I find tasty, but something I want to chug all night generally."
"but it looks like tall glass of chocolate milk. The smell is nice with roasted malt,coffee,and some chocolate. The taste has alot of roasted malt with coffee,and very porter like. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. A good beer that really is a porter."
"d - Overall this was a pretty good beer. The appearance and smell is that of a stout, but the taste was much more hoppy and bitter, and it was somewhat lighter than a stout. I enjoyed it and would definitely try it again."
"The color when poured, was so dark, it really could pass a black. But, it was a very dark brown, with a fair amount of tight medium tan foam and lace from to of glass to finish. The smell was of chocolate and roasted malts. But, the taste had loads of roasted malts, simi-sweet chocolate, kona coffee, with the slight bitterness of hops. A nicely balanced black lager. I could say this is my favorite black lager since I can't remember when!"
"A seriously nice beer."
"In a pilsner glass this beer was jet black with a thick orange/brown head. The head provided a nice contrast to the beer. There was ample lacing. The aroma was chocolate and roasted malt. Interesting taste. Definitely chocolate, but also a sweet/sour fruity taste. Some bitterness in the finish. I thought this beer was rather unique, and enjoyed it tremendously."
"D- Don't know about the ABV, but I will be definitely finishing the bomber on my own. Don't know that I would immediately move on to number, but this is a fairly easy drinking, not-too-thick brew with a good complex taste."
"taste is great. black roasted toasted burnt malt, but not overwelming. flavor subsides to a nice smooth slightly nutty toast flavor. Like well toasted whole grain bread. Very smooth as well, and exceptionally drinkable. I will have this again if an opportunity arises."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is pretty high. Drinkability is nice. Smooth beer. Very good beer."
"D - Obviously a more ""stout like"" take on a schwarzbier but I find it enjoyable."
"Drinkability: this beer was nicely quaffable. Decent version of the style."
"Even with a fairly careful pout you get three fingers of dark microfoam, craters as much as dimples, takes a long time to dissolve down to the surface, leaving noticeably thick streaks of lacing behind. Indeed, the nose is super-smoky, yet at the same time, there's a counter-balancing sweet milk chocolate side as well, followed on by licorice, caramel, banana compote, charred driftwood, mixes in cookie dough and uncooked oats, admirable complexity. Full-bodied with little heaviness, the smokiness creates enough perfume that maybe you just ignore the weight. Along with the burning kindling you get pork rinds and general grill fat notes. Bitter coffee grinds, dark chocolate, cocoa, anise seed play big roles. Hard to find any real fruit or citrus flavors in there. It's almost like a dessert created on an open pit fire. Lasts for a good while at the end. Can't say it's a ""classic"" Schwarzbier but it is a very good domestic take on the style."
"Enjoyable, but halfway through the bottle I already got the point and was losing a bit of interest. Still, it's pretty solid."
"I think the schwarzbier is a really developed taste (I've only had the Duck-Rabbit schwarzbier before this) and I don't think I quite have it yet but I can't say I've seen a more beautiful beer. Pick up some good smokey cheese and quaff a bit of this and you'll be extremely satisfied."
"Whatever the ABV is on this, I can't say I'm tasting it. Drinkable, could roll with a bunch of foods. I'd class this as very good, but falls short of greatness."
"nice, thick tasting but lighter than the flavor punch"
"Drinkable, most definitely. I think I wanted this beer to be more than it is, which left me feeling ""All hat and no cattle"". I think it just smells much better than it tastes, which isn't all bad. Glad to see the GYO philosophy at work."
"For a beer so intense, this is really easy to drink."
"I got quite excited on the pour, this is one of the best looking beers I've poured myself to date. The drinking is solid, but not quite exceptional. Worth checking out."
"Overall, very drinkable and flavorful-A bit lighter alternative to a stout or porter but with all the flavor."
"Still, not a bad beer. I bought 2 bottles of this at Blacklick Liquor in Columbus."
"A: Absolutely pitch black without the slightest hint of light passing through, head is dark brown and tightly packed, as the head drops it shows some spots sticking to the side of the glass - 4.50, S: Massive amounts of coffee and chocolate on the nose as well as some burnt molasses or caramelized brown sugar which gives the beer a defined sweetness - 4.00, T: Hops are quite noticeable on the palate and provide a distinct bitterness, the flavor profile includes a hefty dose of ash, coffee and dark chocolate, definitely a lager yeast but otherwise the beer edges towards that of a stout - 3.50, Faintly creamy -3.50, D: A fine beer and one I would happily drink again - 3.50"
"D: Quite drinkable, due to typical Rogue high price don't think I'll be seeking out again but very glad I had this fine brew."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! My lord, what a dry, earthy, black malt scent. It's bitter with a light hint of chocolate malt. The taste is great as well. It has a stiff, black malt flavor along with a just a touch of chocolate malt sweetness in the finish. It's like a double stout lager. It's incredibly dark and full bodied; more than any other black lager I've had. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little less than adequate carbonation. This is a damn good lager. It's in your face with the black malts."
"Overall, a really good beer. Not really a traditional schwarzbier is my option. More like a porter or a stout in my opinion. Either way, a flavorful and balanced beer. One of Rogue's better seletions and certainly worth trying."
"An interesting beer and an interesting concept from the folks at Rogue. Definitely worth a try."
"After a vigorous pour with beer is black with a half inch head that sticks around long. The aroma is of roasted malt, some graham cracker, hints of baker's chocolate. This smells like a stout....a nice stout, but a stout nonetheless. The taste isn't same burly as the aroma, but it is still very stout like. In fact it reminds me a lot of a good Irish Dry Stout. There is some nice, light roasted malt with some light graham cracker too. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer is certainly not a Schwarzbier. There is nothing about it that indicates it was brewed with a lager yeast. The front of the bottle calls it a lager, but the back simply says it is brewed with ""German yeast."" The thing is German yeast isn't a lager yeast. Germans brew ales too. And if memory serves me right Rogue considers its pacman yeast a german yeast. Thus, I consider this to be a good stout brewer with Rogue's signature yeast. Whatever it is, though, I think it is very good, and would like to see it in six packs."
"Pours viscous and jet black with a chunky brown head that leaves a lot of sticky lace. A very roasty nose with some earthy hops. Smooth, chocolately and highly roasty, but not burnt or toasted. Fairly chewy mouthfeel but very smooth and fairly clean. Hops are barely discernible other than providing a fresh, minty bitterness to support the roasty malt. Finishes pretty long and roasty but clean. Drinks more like a milk stout than any style of lager, although it shows lager smoothness and clarity of flavor. A supple, round, stout-like lager; very tasty."
"D - A tasty black lager I would certainly not hesitate to try it again if I saw it on tap, but the price of bombers doesn't make this seem like a good value -up near $10 from what I am told which comes out to around .45 cents an ounce - I understand the terroir involved tends to increase the price, though"
"D: Although the pac-man yeast puts that good 'ol Rogue stamp on this one, it's as good as any German schwarz out there. Another great beer by Rogue."
"A very drinkable stout, I mean, schwarzbier. Honestly it's hard to find much of a difference between the two with this beer. Very drinkable. The nose is a big downer for me though. Everything else about this beer is right on, but their is something going on with the scent. This beer would still appeal to a lot of people."
"This has to be one of the best examples of the style, if not the best."
"CHEERS!!"
"D - A nice drinking beer here in the cold snowy night. I can't say I've tried many black lagers but I'm afraid my plebeian palate can't taste a big difference between this and porters in general."
"So the appearance, aroma, and NOW the flavor all suggest very little ""Schwarzbier"" and much more ""Porter"". Not saying Dirtoir is a bad beer (quite the opposite), but don't advertise a Lager and give me something that looks, smells, and tastes like an Ale. Roasted black chocolate malts add a healthy dose of perceived bitterness; hops are earthy...soil and coffee grounds in the finish. Decent mouthfeel, a bit on the thin side but nicely carbonated and smooth across the palate. All in all, a tasty entry into Rogue's catalogue. Looking forward to the ""Second Growth"" series...I wonder if they'll make a hop-forward beer with the first generation of their hop plants?"
"Drinkability? Hell this is an easy drinker. I know I'll be picking up more. Well done, Rogue."
"D: Very drinkable, sessionable brew. I really enjoyed this beer. I look forward to some more of the GYO's from Rogue"
"Significantly richer, thicker, and maltier than a typical Schwarzbier. Delightful."
"n.b. - I'll cheer to any attempt to source local ingredients in any culinary endeavor. This new(ish, but truly ancient) model that Sierra Nevada and now Rogue are trailblazing - i.e., estate beer - is a fantastic development for the industry. Salute, and may others follow your lead."
"Mouthfeel: Has a thinner feel than I was expecting. The poor made me think it was more viscous, but the feel is right in line with what a schwarzbier should be."
"Almost carries itself like a rauchbeer, but this beers use of balancing flavors makes it more appealing."
"I have to admit, this one caught me by surprise. I love the Dunkels and Dark Lagers. Big fan of New Belgium 1554. This one just knocks the socks off everything, though. Such a drinkable beer... great job Rogue."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer. My local beer store told me Rogue called them directly and that they would only be selling these Chatoe Rogue beers to smaller mom and pop type beer stores, so I was a a little skeptical as to why they would do this, and not release it on a large scale (I guess it has to do with the whole grow your own thing). This turned out to be a good beer and I hope they make it more widely available in the future."
"Toasted and lightly roasted malts up front. Dark chocolate bitterness and roasted barley are front and center. Earthy tobacco and peat flavors enter mid-palate. Flash of chocolate-y sweetness before a spicy, coffeeish, herbal bitterness. Lingering roasted sweetness. Medium-bodied with a sticky feel. Nice drinkability. Maybe not a prototypical schwarzbier, but whatever you want to call it, it is damn good!"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a very dark brown color with about an inch and a half frothy brown head. Head retention is good, and there's also a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and some coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like burnt/charred and roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some hops noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and quite enjoyable to drink. I think this brew seems more like a robust porter than a schwarzbier, but I'm not complaining at all. I think this is a pretty good brew, it's worth a try if you come across it."
"Body and drinkability were both very good, different from what is expected for the style. Overall, a very good beer that would have scored if called a different style, like maybe a Baltic Porter. Worth trying."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a large, mocha-colored head. The aroma is roasted malt and coffee. The flavor is bitter chocolate, burnt malt and coffee. The aftertaste is hop bitterness and burnt malt. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Dry finish. Overall, an interesting beer that doesn't really fit the style for schwarzbier, but I am not sure what else to call it. A nice hybrid."
"Pours jet lack with tons of fine and slowly forming foam, a la nitro. Foam is quite tan and leaves a ton of lace. If you handed me a glass of this without knowing, I would thank you for the wonderful looking stout. Lots of dark roasted coffee, chocolate and a touch of smoke in the nose. Lighter than it appears, the crisp effervescence makes for a nice mouthfeel. Taste is lots of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a very modest touch of fruitiness among the light smoke. The finish is a lasting smooth bitterness that is manifested in a dark chocolate sensibility. Very cool beer, and quite delicious but I think it may be a bit more toward the porter end of the style for my liking. Still very yummy though. It's also pretty cool to see Rogue grow all their own ingredients and I'm eager to see what else will come of this!"
"I enjoyed this one. Seems I've been trying a few black lagers as of late and enjoying the trip as well. Smooth and roasty works for me every time."
"Taste mimics the smokiness of the smell. Very deeply roasted and dry malts are joined by just a touch of sweetness. There's really no hop presence to speak of, and the alcohol is very masked in the smooth, dry, rich-tasting beer. Feel is moderate but could use a touch more carbonation to keep it fresh. Drinkability is pretty high. This bomber went away quicker than expected."
"Drinkability is good here, Rogue did a great job here."
"D: Not too shabby. Bought this on a whim but will seek it out next time I'm at the store."
"Pours an opaque sable, nearly black, with a very thick chocolaty-tan head that hangs around for a while. Rich, smoky aroma is like a fine roast coffee with a firm undertone of unsweetened chocolate and just a touch of molasses - very tempting! Flavor is smoky and oily, slightly sweet, rather like a high-grade mocha. Texture is very smooth, somewhat fizzy, with a subtle fine graininess to it. Definitely worthy."
"i then to like black lagers (schwarzbier ... is that a proper noun?) the more I encounter them. This one has got to be near the top of my list for the style. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Well done."
"D: Decent amount of flavor, but light and refreshing. Very session-able."
"Drinkability: While I would say it's a tad more bolder than a standard Schwarzbier, it is by no means overblown and is actually a very enjoyable beer (or at least I thought so). Go on, friends, give it a try!"
"D: Very easy to consume. This may be the best American interpretation of this style that I have tried thus far."
"Nice! I love a good Schwarzbier and this one brought the goods with a deep mix of roast and hops and a super smooth feel that kept the drinkibility of this way up. A good entry for sure here from Rogue."
"overall a very nice brew, the smokiness grows as you drink."
"Nice to see another beer produced with locally grown ingredients. I would have picked something other than a black lager to show off the hops, but to each his own. Pours a very dark brown with a nice creamy head that leaves some dark lacing and persists for a bit as a thin cap. Smells chocolatey and slightly roasty, with some citrusy hop aromas and a bit of creaminess. Quite bold and rich in flavor with a nice combination of creaminess, vibrant citrusy hop presence, some light roastiness, and a bit of sour graininess. Silky smooth, but the slight sourness is distracting. Nevertheless, a fine drinking beer. Kudos for the series as well."
"This beer took me all by storm. When your not in the mood for hops, but want to get into some hairy malt profiles American style. Aromas and flavors of big up front roasted malts - all chocolaty and warm. Big big roasted malt character. husky, grainy, like dirt for chocolate. I did it. medium full body and more roast on the finish. It felt good. This is the answer to extreme hops...extreme malts. Yet smoothed out with a lager yeast."
"I enjoyed this beer very much. While it is richly flavored it is able to maintain a very enjoyable lightness, which makes it very, very drinkable."
"D: Aside from the minor mouthfeel problems which really weren't a big deal to me, this is a very good black lager. Certainly one of the better Rogue's I've had. I'm not the biggest Rogue guy, I've had enough B beers from them, but this is really well done."
"Taste has a lot of coffee and chocolate as well. It's got a rich and creamy bitterness with a very light coffee bitterness."
"This beer is just awesome to look at,it's the blackest schwarzbier I have seen,jet black with a large fluffy deep mocha colored head that settles very slowly into a creamy froth.Big fruit aromas jump out with a tinge of coffee.A great mix of earth and smoke mixed with dark fruit on the palate,the coffee tones are great mixed with some bitter chocolate.Hands down easily the best of style I have had,I know its not nearly true to style (more big American stout),but its fantastic!"
"-the roastiness and smokiness is a little overpowering for me. it is a pretty decent beer, but i couldnt really go back for it or take in 2 in a night. so overall, it wasnt that great for me"
"A ""desert"" lager... A delicious drink that has some ties to a traditional German schwarzbier, yet has an ""American"" bigness. The Rogue house character isn't there much (since a German yeast is used rather than their Pac-man), but this still has a ""Rogue"" character - in a good way! If you're looking for a rich dessert lager...here it is!"
"Well, this is one of the better Rogue beers I've had in a long, long time, and one of the top few schwarzbiers I've ever had. It's complex and unique for the style with a hefty hop presence compared to other versions I've had. Very well crafted."
"Overall I was a big fan of this beer and while I wouldn't call it a quinessential schwarzbier it very well may be my favorite that I've tried. Definitely worth a shot."
"D-this has a nice flavor to it and brings a well done balance between the roasted flavors and some hops at the finish. very enjoyable."
"This is yet another fine beer from the folks at Rogue. Not my favorite style by any means, but it is well done and easily drinkable."
" a fine brew."
"Quite an enigma with the high level of roast, sour-bitter finish, and full-to-fleeting procession, it's hard to know what to make of it. Where are all the fruity notes and English-type sweet maltiness for which Rogue is known? Those could really have helped out here."
"D-This is a nice American brewed schwartzbier. It's nice to get this style fresh."
"Pours a thick, pitch black cola like body that gives off a tan head with minimal lacing on top of a very coffeeish, espresso aroma with some roasted malts as well. More of a stout to me, it has a chewey medium body that the hops stick out but gives off more a dry, coffee stout but not completely balanced as the backbite is extremely dry and balanced. A sipper that I could drink after dinner but definitely too much to session."
"I really wish more brewers would focus on a good schwarz. Drinkability through the roof to go along with flavors a porter/stout drinker can appreciate. Could drink a lot of this, was really pleased with this Rogue offering. Been a long time since I've had a Rogue, since they were much less expensive in Michigan than in NC and there are so many more brews to try now."
"Almost too thick and roasty to be a schwarzbier. However, it's tasty enough to warrant a try, even if some might balk at the price (as always). Made with locally grown hops and malt, which I feel is a big plus."
"4.5/3.5/3/3.5/3"
"Mouthfeel was creamy but thinned out. Moderate carbonation."
