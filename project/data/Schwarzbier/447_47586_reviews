"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with a medium lasting beige head. Aroma and Taste is mild dark roasted caramel malt, yeast notes, grains mild hops bitterness. Palate is a medium body. moderate carbonation. Finshes with dark caramel malt, mild roasted malt and grains and mild hops. Overall an ok drinking brew."

"Overall a tasty ale."
"Average overall, this might fit the style profile, but unless I was at McSorley's in NYC throwing back a few, then I doubt that I’d seek this out again. Extra points for being easy to drink."

"Overall, I would say that this is an excellent Schwarzbier at the least. I would totally seek this out AND recommend it to the beginning craft beer drinker as a good transition beer as well as an alternative to a stout in which they may not like. It is a great alternative to the latter in the winter as you feel like you can session this 5.5 % ABV beer without getting bloated and hammered. 4 out of 5!"

"Gotta love the chops on ol' McSorley's jowls, yo! Anyway, this stuff pours a deep sienna topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa powder and a kiss of roasted malts, both thoroughly intertwined (as much as they can be, given the mass discrepancy) and fairly faint. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong contingent of cola. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little schwarz, though it's Irish-ness doesn't really come through (whatever that would mean, anyway)."
""
"Texture was a bit off but overall pretty solid for the style. Nothing fancy but a solid session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Quite nice and easy to drink with some decent roast and malt flavors. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this a decent mild and mellow brew, that I'd love to try out on tap--preferably at McSorley's Old Ale House."
""

"Got this one trade. A black lager, dark like cold coffee in a glass, without ice. Black hole like. Nose is ripe fruits and raison and caramel and floral...OK. Taste is light malt and prune and then some bitter...overall quick and somewhat watery, not chewy or overly rustic. Seems much like the other black lager I've tried. I guess overall, however, I'm lukeW on the style."
"This is the best American dark lager available. It has incredible roasted malt flavor and drinks smooth like a dark lager should. Sure, I would prefer Kostritzer on tap but in the US this is not a real possibility. I actually prefer this beer to the original Kostritzer in the can or bottle and I can afford it as a retired beer lover. At a price point lower than most American adjunct lagers, this flavorful brew is affordable and readily available. Kudos to Pabst for making it available and affordable."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is quite crisp and easy drinking. Overall it was a pleasant take on the style but not something I would seek out regularly."
"Poured a dark brown with ruby edges and over a finger of beige head. The head dissipated very quickly and left very little lacing behind. The nose was bready with a trace of roast. There is also a hint of roasted malt in the flavor profile, but the taste and body of this beer are pretty thin. There are both light sweet and bitter notes on the finish."
""
""
"O: Very nice Schwarzbier, i've enjoyed this on tap at my local watering hole for many years around St Pattys Day."
"It almost looks as if I have Coca-Cola in my mug rather than beer, with its similar , almost translucent deep brown color and thin fizzy head. The aroma is like that of a sweet stout - giving my nose the pleasure of milk chocolate, roasty malts, and a hint of grapefruit hops as well. The light bodied beer coats my mouth nicely with its oily mouthfeel, and as the beer traverses my palate, I begin to again notice a nice mix of sweet stout flavorings, and this time in the taste itself there is a definite pronounced hop bitterness, especially in the finish. This is an excellent everyday beer - very straightforward and mild. I am particularly fond of Schwartzbier, although this is no Kostritzer. Ultimately you really need to take a trip to McSorley's Old Ale House in NYC, get a table, and knock back a bunch of these with some rowdy friends!"

"This beer is decent, but not great. I probably won't try it again."

"3.0 D: Fairly tame schwarzbier, but not bad. Goes down quite easy."

"Pours very dark black with some brown tinges. Very little foam remains. Light chocolate nose. Smooth, even keeled dark chocolate malt taste. Light, almost watery underneath. Mild bitter long into the finish. Pretty good beer. Enjoyable."
"McSorley's may have an Irish name, but it's a German-style beer brewed by an American company. Too weak for stout lovers, this black(ish) beer may be a good introduction for those too timid yet for the dark roastiness of authentic Irish stouts. And when viewed in this regard, it's not too bad an offering at all. I'd happily have another."
""
""
""
"notes: this is good. This is very good beer,"
""
"A rather good black lager. Relatively light in body feel but with a nearly full, luscious dark malt roundness. Flavorful and smooth. Goes to show that decent malt-y dark beers can be made with lager yeasts, too."
""
"Served a black color with a nice tan head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of malt with a trace of caramel. There is also a bit of coffee and nut in the background. Taste of malt, coffee and some bittersweet chocolate. There is a nice bitterness throughout and a dry finish. Medium body, crisp and smooth. Nice balance. Easy drinker, nice beer for the style. I think having this on tap at an Irish pub enhances the character of this beer."

"Conclusion: This is the second beer I have had from this brewery and it is by far the best. There is good balance and complexity in the feel and flavor and this beer hits the style head on. I think if it was smoother and less carbonated (cask anybody?) it would reach new heights."
"Not a bad brew, but nothing spectacular in flavor or aroma. Glad it's something different in style with such wide availability."
""
""
""
""
"(D)- A good little lager, though extremely straightforward and thin; even for the style itself."
"Nice simple beer, very drinkable!"
"Overall, a simple beer, that goes down quite well! Would make a great session beer."
""
""
"D - Good flavors and a nice balance. I'd have it again."
"D"

"O - It is an enjoyable brew. My sample was laser stamped on the neck with 071311. I assume that is a date but I'm not sure if it is a born-on date or a drink-by date. Either way it was pretty good."

"O - The overwhelming dry, dirt-like component to this beer definitely doesn't do it any favors. McSorley's Irish Black Lager is not something I'd be interested in having again."
"I loved the fact that it's American made by Pabst; we can sure use the jobs! It's a 'real' dark beer, not at all like Miller's Lowenbrau Dark."
"This is a very easy to drink beer. I enjoyed relaxing with it."
"Yeah, my sponsor's not going to like that. This was supposed to be a ""step down"" beer, but it further proves to me that Pabst brews beers I like. Shh."
"Over all, a surprisingly good beer and one I'm glad a snagged in a make your own sixer"
"There is a bar of the same name in Manhattan that serves this, though they have nothing to do with brewing."
"D- Such a solid beer should not be so easy to drink, but sure enough, it is. I can and have easily made an evening out of this beer. Well balanced, delightful stuff."
"Beer is thin to medium in body with a mild tartness on the finish and a roasty aftertaste. The forward of the beer is minimally sweet and the overall beer is fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it again and I would outright recommend it either but overall this is an OK beer."
"Guinness is my de facto standard beer for Irish drinking, but it casts its shadows on other up and coming Irish brews - similar in their dark and malty flavor delivered on a light palate, these beers sacrifice tradition and history for flavor and innovation. McSorley’s Irish Black Lager is the newest beer in this category. Like any other dark lager, it promises some of that dark maltiness in a refreshing beer - perfect for easy drinking with strong ale-like flavors. The smell resembles coke, with touches of raisins. The biggest difference between this and any kind of dark ale is the notable absence of fig aromas. That textured sweet smell is gone, leaving a dark yet simpler aroma, clear and clean through the nostrils, and inspiring clear headedness. This straightforward cleanliness paired with flavor is duplicated in the taste, where a nice, dark, roasted malty sweetness hovers along the palate, off-set by a kind of alkaline baseness. Complexity is shunted to the side in this easy drinking beer, itself a fine rival for my attention against Guinness. Guinness, however, continues to be my favorite beer for recipes that call for something dark and sudsy to enrich a dish."
"Overall, I liked this. Easy to drink, not overdone or over-carbonated. I'd have this again."
"Smooth full mouthfeel, goes down smoothly. Not a bad beer at all, I was surprised to see this coming from the Pabst company. Goes to show you shouldn't judge a beer before you taste it."
"Overall a solid black lager, a good thirst quincher with full flavor."
"Overall, this is a good black lager, but I wanted more bite and wildness to it; I found it slightly too watery, and thought the flavors could have been better emphasized and drawn out."
"O: Good drinking beer. Won't blow you away."
"D - Another cheapish alternative to the popular and easy to find Guinness. Pleasant and quite drinkable but not so remarkable."
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color. The head was ok, but nothing rave about. The smell of the beer is roasted and had some hops on the nose too. The taste of the beer has some decent roasted flavors going on that finish with a decent bitterness. The mouthfeel is light. Overall it's a very light beer for such a dark color. It's probably worth checking out."
"Overall: A good dark lager that is what you expect from the style. A lighter brew with some darker flavors."
"O- Pretty good drinking beer. I could drink this one again."
"Overall - I enjoyed this beer and found it interesting. It has many of the characteristics that I would normally associate with a Baltic porter or a dry stout, without being as rich. Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for something dark but don't want to crack open one of your bigger beers."
"When you have the name Irish on your beer there are expectations. When you also stick the word ""black"" on the label the expectations increase. This beer poured a dark dark brown and even looked plain brown for the last third. A nice tan head with a scent that said ""welcome old friend."" Smelled just like a beer should. I need McSorley's to make a candle of this beer. Taste was rich not overbearing - I could make a night with a few of these - Very very smooth."
"Brew is very drinkable for sure. Not a ton of flavors, but enough to enjoy a few. Pretty good stuff."
"D: Easy to drink for sure. Lacks character to be a regular beer though."
"Okay, objectivity didn't work out so well."
"Miedium roasted malt flavor with the astringent hops from America, and a an effervescant yeast gives a little dry palate. The finish is a little musty, but still very drinkable. This is a perfect local pub session Irish lager."
"Overall, a nice beer for the price. It was pretty drinkable I thought."
"This wasn't too bad. It had a roasted coffee like aroma, slightly robust. The taste was similar but it was a little thin. Again, it had a roasted nature. It was like mixing a light stout with a well carbonated lager. Overall, I thought it tasted a tad generic. It wasn't bad and for the most part I was happy with my 6pck purchase. I bought it on sale on Sat 12 when every store was having an Irish beer special. So it was worth the price on that day, but I wouldn't go flocking back unless it was on sale."
"Notice a high score for appearance and nothing else...they got the color of the style right but that's about it. No yeast funk like there should be...the malts lake depth...the hops are forgettable, even though this isn't supposed to be a hoppy style anyway...tastes like an adjunct version of a schwarzbier, which I suppose is what it is...was cheap anyway...avoid"
"This was my first experience with a McSorley's brew. Didn't expect much as they're part of Pabst, but overall not a terrible beer. For about a buck a bottle, it's a good value."
"The CPJ"
"McSorley's Irish Black Lager is a very dim brown beer with a thin, sald colored head that fades to a film and leaves decent lacing. It has a sweet, malty aroma with a lot of roasted coffee and a touch of greenness. It's medium-light bodied, a little watery, pretty smooth and the finish is chalky. It's pretty lightly flavored. It's roasty and tastes a lot like dark malt extract. There's no bitterness, really. It's not sweet or dry. Roast lingers in the aftertaste. It's nothing stand-out. It's a pretty bland session beer with no glaring faults."
"Very drinkable. At the price and at 5.5% I won't be slamming these down, but I'd be happy to have this with a meal."
"D- A decent drinking beer, but nothing that will blow your socks off. Simple and light."
"A good entry beer here, I think. Drinks very easily and has good flavor, even though it won't punch you in the face."
"D: I don't know what the abv on this beer is, but the only downfall I see in drinkability is its dryness. Other than that, it is a tasty, smooth, and very drinkable lager."
"A solid beer, nothing too fancy, just good."
"Light thin coffee finish."
"Easy to kick back a bunch, just wish they cranked the flavor up a notch or too, it would still make it a session beer, but a more enjoyable one."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its deep and dark aroma. It was certainly unexpected to have such roasty malts, but it was considerably more surprising to find robust chocolate and nice buttery character. The taste followed through for the most part, lacking only in the same assertiveness found in the nose."
"There is nothing that is blatantly wrong with this beer, but there is nothing that makes me want to buy it if I have the choice between other beers. It's not bad by any means and for some it may be a good choice however it doesn't do anything for me."
"I really loved this beer. I had never heard of it before and found it on tap at one of the local Bier Stubes. It was a very dark beer. Similar to a stout. Smell and taste of coffee/chocolate. The great thing about this beer is the lack of aftertaste. Most beers like this have a strong bitter aftertaste that lingers. That wasn't the case here. I will definitely have this beer again."
"This arrived deep, dark brown (almost black) color with a half inch of slightly tan head. Foam quickly melted to a thin cap, thin lace lines left behind. Smell had some roasted malt, a bit nutty and bready. A solid Euro dark taste, some coffee notes with nice malt character. Touch of bitterness to finish. Body was a bit thin, but appropriate. Refreshing and drinkable, but at the same time nothing too memorable."
"Beautiful black/red color and a nice thick head with a light brown color. Not too impressed with the smell, simply a bold malty scent. Impressive roast flavor at first and then finishes with a mild chocolate/coffee flavor and a good bit of carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is very impressive considering its dark reputation. I have had this on tap and in bottle form and will definitely drink it again."
"D: This is drinkable but could be much better."
"Drinkability: I note that this beer is now brewed in Latrobe, and I wonder a bit whether the recipe has changed; certainly, I was more impressed than I expected to be reading the reviews of others"
"This beer is a wonderful dark color, nearly black with red hues. The aroma is layered with lots of chocolate malts. There's little hop aroma at all, just lots of specialty grains, backed by a touch of alcohol. The taste is similar. It's a dry beer, very clean, with a lot of heavily roasted malt. Balanced, slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is just a touch oily and slick. Easy to drink, and worth a try."
"This beer pours pitch black. It has a slightly spicy aroma. I don't believe it is brewed with rye but it has an aroma of a bit of rye and a hint of smoke. It tastes of dark roasted malt, a hint of coffee, a hint of smoke and a hint of sweetness on the back end. It is flavorful yet not heavy."
"D- Very good. I love this stuff for happy hour in the afternoon. That ""in-betweeness"" makes it very attractive for a stout drinker like me. Not TOO heavy if the weather isn't right or you're just not in the mood, but not water thin either. Rightly nice in the middle. Very, very pleasing find."
"Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. The upside of the thinness is that McSorley's is very easy to drink. It's the versatile kind of beer you could enjoy on your own or take to a (non-college) party."
"D- Because of the low ABV and the smootheness of the exprience overall, I could drink a few of these in a session."
"D= very drinkable and a contender in this class."
"on tap it was dark brown/black color with a tan head,,smell is sweet malts and toffee with some hops..taste is good with hops and toasted malts a touch of nutmeg some light coffee..mouth feel is on the light side with all the flavors not bursting out at you..easy to drink and pretty tasty though try this one"
"great drinkable and a good overall beer even better from the"
"Overall, an average beer, nothing more, nothing less."
"I wouldn't dink much of this. I drink it until I can't drink anymore when I'm at McSorley's, but with the bottled variety, I am good after one or two."
"Great dark beer, quite a find in a middle of nowhere IL bar in the middle of summer (otherwise"
"Overall: nice but not a really interesting beer. Easy to drink and easy to forget."
"A nice every day drinking beer."
"This was an interesting experience being my first time with this style of beer. I didn't know what to expect and even afterwards I still wasn't sure what I got. It wasn't as simple as was described to me, as just being a brew with the taste and smell of lager that just happened to be black. Naw, doesn't work like that, but McSorley's did manage to throw all of my senses together in an array of confusion. The color was indeed black, with little to no head or lace. The smell came up and grabbed my nostrils with a clean and crisp, simple oat-like malt, with a very plain and simple hop note. The taste echoed the smell with very little residual. I was on the fence with how I liked the feel of it, telling myself that maybe the black color of the brew was biasing my opinion of what the feel should be like, but it was that of a medium body, with a few harsh bubbles here and there draining down the sides of the palate, the refreshment hits in the middle-back of the tongue. I'd like to try McSorley's again, I think it has potential. Probably need more time and concentration to really get a feel for it."
"Situation: A Good Friday three-meal ender... Glassware: 22 oz. pilsner... Appearance: thin white head sits atop a black body that befits the label and approximates a black and tan appearance... Aroma: sweet burnt aroma that suggests a porter; malts are roasted and hops are subdued... Palate: smooth, slick body--a moderate to full-bodied lager; slight effervescence; a bit creamy too... Taste: a bit toasted in its maltiness; bread notes remind the drinker that this IS a lager... Overall: rather flat and nondescript overall appeal; a bit of a warmer for February and March, but with a bit of sweetness, this can be a nice after-dinner glass"
"Mouthfeel is kinda weak due the watery nature of the beer, but I'd definitely have another. Which is good, because I bought a 6-pack."
"Aroma is smoky with a yeasty overtone, not strong but OK. It pours a semi-transparent Coke brown with a fluffy and thick, if not persistent, pale tan head. Flavor is a bit weak, but malty and smoky with hints of spice and molasses. Texture is smooth and fizzy, just a bit watery. If they can ""thicken"" this beer it will be a winner."
"I picked this up at Hannafords for 7.99 a six pack. Poured into a pint glass and noticed a thick puffy head a foam. Very dark in color, but light in texture. Similar color to a draft stout, but with the consistency of a lager. Nice roasted malt flavor, and very drinkable. It is listed as 5.5% alcohol, but it doesn't seem like it is that strong. A good beer to mix in every now and then."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown color with a small tight tan head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of very light roasted malt, mineral/metal scent, burnt grains and some chocolate/peat. All are quite subtle. The taste is of light roasted malt, grainy and the beginnings of a chocolate or coffee flavor. Not too bad, a bit grainy. I would like to see a touch more of the roasted flavor. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation, very burpy. Fairly sweet all around like a macro. A very easy drinking beer, one that could change some ""dark"" beer haters. Could use some more flavor but it is servicable."
"I'd have to say a was surprised at how good this little beer was.... I might come back again for this one."
"This beer can give the generally well-regarded Sam Adam's black lager a run for its money. Black with caramel highlights and a moderate tan head. Nice roasted malt flavors, with a clean, slightly dry body. For a brewery that produces a variety of labeled products, Lion nailed the style on this one."
"d - I've had this on tap an McSorley's in NY and really enjoyed it, but it wasn't as good from the bottle. A little bland in the smell and taste. Would probably only have again at McSorely's."
"Overall, I was impressed."
"D: This beer goes down very easily; I could drink this stuff all day long so is quite sessionable. It's not a bad choice if you are looking to drink a lot of something that has some flavor."
"Granted I did drink this a little warmer than I should have, but being ice cold just covers up all the flaws, so now they are all brought out."
"Notes: This isn't anything special, but it isn't really supposed to be a roasty beer. It is just a euro lager that is colored with some malt flavor. However, that doesn't mean it is a bad beer. I like it for a session beer because it is more flavorful while still light."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. When I saw the style my expectations dropped, but it was pretty good with some intricate flavors."
"D: A decent beer you could stand to have few of. If you have nothing better, you could session with it."
"Not much in the way of drinkability. Skip this and you will not have missed a thing."
"D- This is a good average drinking beer. Nothing over the top but gives enough flavor that makes you want to come back for more. Plus the story BA Lukafer has about the actual bar is amazing. Don't trust me? BM him and ask!"
"You can drink it but I'm not sure you can enjoy it. Middle of the road and there are better examples out there."
"Taste is slightly better than the aroma. Still has the base of caramel malts and toasted grains, but it is off set by a faint hop bitterness. Nothing crazy at all, but teh slight bitterness makes it enjoyable enough and makes you enjoy the subtlety of the malts more than I could in the aroma. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, and it maintains a nice level of carbonation throughout. Not a great lager, but definitely enjoyable."
"I would say this falls closer to a Schwarzbier with the more pronounced roasted note. Whatever you want to call it it's another underwhelming lager in the vast world of lager beer."
"Overall, a solid brew for my first taste of Lion Brewery. Definitely worth a try -- it's an easy drinker for being so dark."
"McSorley's Black Lager is pretty average for dark lagers- a caramel, malty base is met with heavy toast and even roasted grains. No fruitiness and the beer shies away from coffee or char. Still dark brown, much darker than it tastes; a little softer on the palate but still not a Schwarzbier either. Heavy carbonation and minerally flavors make the beer taste and feel a bit abbrasive. The beer needs a maltier base and more creamy texture before fading into dryness and lightness. It's an ok beer that has a hard time competing with German Dunkels but has too much roast to even compare."
"D-Very smooth, a lot better than I expected."
"This beer is very soom and creamy almost guiness nitro creamy which makes it easy to go down and rounds out the beer great."
"D: This beer has more to it than I expected. It's quite good, and easy to drink as well. A good session brew."
"Drinkability: A simple, drinkable brew. Not bad, not great; it gets the job done."
"Medium bodied, fairly smooth and very drinkable."
"Drinkability- I was expecting something different from this beer, not that thats a good thing or a bad thing. Its flavors are rich and overall its decent but its wouldn't be the first dark lager I'd pick up."
"SkÅL!"
"So, this is what they are drinking at a small joint in NY. Maybe someday I'll see it, but until then, this is a good sturdy bottle of beer I wouldn't mind having again."
"Highly Recommended."
"My inner drunk likes this beer, high drinkability. My only complaint is that it kinda leaves a dry mouth behind, but that encourages more drinking. If you wanna get solidly drunk at 6.99 a 6 pack (Louisiana), pick this up."
"D: Pretty decent drinker actually. And sort of an interesting concept. It does have some quirks, but is really quite well put together. Still you do get the feeling that the name preceded the brew (those rascally marketing guys)."
"D - A lot like mixture of Killians and Guinness Draught - darker and perhaps a bit more flavor than either. Not something I'd buy again, but I've certainly had worse."
"Ordered a bottle at the Lansdowne Pub near Fenway. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown almost black color, with a thin white head that faded fast. Smelled a bit like cola syrup. Tasted was interesting. Reminded me of a combination of pumpernickel bread and black licorice. Very thin mouthfeel, with a weird fizz and an acrid aftertaste, like burnt coffee. I can see how some might enjoy a big mug of this, but I don't think it was good enough to encourage me to order another."
"D- not recmoned for a six pack.. try one and see how ya like it.. different tastes for different poeple.. but not for me... cheers"
"D- A generic dark lager. Drinks like one. Drink it and forget it."
"D: A dark or dunkel lager fan might session this as the ABV seems modest and flavors are alright. If you can have it for a good price and there's really not much available, I'd condone picking it up. Although if there were something available in the way of a true schwartzbier I'd easily leave this one behind."
"RJT"
"drinkability is decent. for a brown, this is a decent brew, but it is a bit weak in the end. could be better."
"Drinkability: fairly high drinkability, but again nothing too special,"
"The mouth was slightly thick with low levels of carbonation. Could be a session beer for some."
"Pours a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Just about black with no highlights. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Light roasted coffee nose. Flavor has some sweetness - a malty coffee. Best by May 18 2009, bought in May 09 and forgotten - still good. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"D-I'd get this at a festival and drink it from the bottle. Honestly, I think this might taste better that way. It was cheap, and it's okay, but I don't think I would buy another one at a beer store or restaurant, even though it was relatively cheap."
"Definitely a dark lager in terms of taste, body and crispness. Note of black patent malt and mildly burnt toast. Thin body and relatively high carbonation. Light hop in the swallow. The aftertaste is a combination of two bitters--hop and dark roast malts."
"I bought this for a friend's party. He grew up in Manhattan and I knew it would have sentimental value. I don't drink a lot of Euro Dark Lagers so I have nothing to compare it to. It was ok but no great shakes. Impressive dark color, good tan head. Aroma is almost non existent. Mouthfeel and drinkability are ok and this beer would be good for almost any season."
"Overall this beer didn't seem terribly clean, and while not terrible it's not worth seeking out."
"I found it enjoyable and drinkable, relaxing but not refreshing, i could see it going good with a meal and a cigar, i was happy with the beer and ill most likely purchase again in the future."
"D: A good beer. I have not had many of these black lagers, but I could see myself getting a case of this"
"Pours a dark black with ruby highlights when held toward the light, head is light tan forms nicely with a sturdy pour into a tulip chalice from the dollar store. Aroma slight milk chocolate with roasted dark malts and light coffee characteristics. Flavor hits me with a wicked lactic sour note that I wasn't expecting, still has roasted malt dark chocolate with a hint of coffee but there's this wild ripe fruit note with the souring effect I didn't care for in a black lager, but it honestly reminds me of a lighter Stegmaier Porter in a weird way. I think they mixed this recipe with the Penn Dark recipe, because this looks moore like the Penn Dark of old than the newly bottled stuff from the Lion does. Really solid dark lager when said and done and after the slightly sour twang goes away it gets better with each sip. Mouthfeel is creamy with sturdy carbonation a very velvety feel to it all. Drinkability overall is quality impressed to see a decent beer coming from a McSorley's label I remember an Irish Red that was pretty shitty at one point in my drinking career."
"12 oz. A very dark brown pour, limited off white head. Some chocolate and roast, malt and earthy peat. Good smooth light/med. lager body. Taste has some chocolate and roasted tones. Has that pronounced lager yeast. Good amount of carbonation. Clean slight roast/bitter finish. A pretty darn good drinker. Euro-dark lager, not sure what that is, but I like this one."
"Notes: Overall this is a very enjoyable and very drinkable black lager."
" Not bad stuff."
"D: Enjoyable for a few, fairly smooth going down with a fullness that can be appreciated without weighing you down."
"D: Very drinkable, I liked it, good lager."
"Flavor is nice. Not fantastic or full-bodied, but enough character with the roastiness, peaty malt and potent tanginess to keep me interested for the drink. Not too bitter, but definitely dry rather than sweet and malty. Tart hops. Carbonation was a little high for me, and the mouthfeel wasn't too persuasive. Overall, pretty good and very drinkable for the flavors it packs. Though, I could do without the hoaky McSorley's Ale House history and other gimmickry suggested by the label. Come on, it's a contract brew. But a good beer nonetheless."
"I think this is an exceptional find for any Irish stout lover. The overall characteristics are very similar to the Guinness 250 Anniversary edition brew. This has the same sourness that Guinness is synonymous with (especially the foreign or extra stout strains). While not as complex as Guinness foreign stout, it seems very similar to Guinness 250 edition. It has slightly more mouthfeel and slightly less maltiness (due to it being a black lager to be sure). If you find it cheaper then Guinness at your market, then this is a definite buy. I'm comparing this to Guinness simply because it seems to emulate it so much: it has the same basic acidity and maltiness of the recent 250 variety (IE it has more flavor then the Guinness draught versions but it's not as heavy as the ""foreign stout"" versions). The main thing that I like about this beer over other Irish ales is it seems to have the same Brettanomyces strains of sourness that I like in Guinness. This is the first time I've had a McSorley's, and from what I've gleened, this is a relatively new contract from Lion brewery. Will be interesting to see if this keeps going: I think it's good for what it is: a lighter Guinness foriegn stout."
"D: Flavorful, goes down easy, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a beer that's ok to drink for a while if you want a darker beer that isn't too heavy, but it's not something that I would choose unless the selection were limited."
"Not sure exactly what makes this Irish... It's pretty dark though - I see bare hints of red through my weizen glass. Head is moderate and drops quickly to a thin covering sheet. Nose isn't strong - coffee and some tobacco. Flavour is fairly smooth, somewhat acidic, a little bit fruity with a decent hop. Takes a while but burnt and coffee flavours appear as well. Dry with a moderate mouthfeel and a medium carbonation. Pretty smooth and NOT toasty for such a dark beer. FWIW though, easy drinking with some good balanced flavours and pretty accessible for beginners."
"Overall it's a fairly drinkable lager with a nice character, but nothing special."
"Pretty solid atmosphere. Nice appearance and pleasant, although simple, nose. Flavor is much the same. Not complex, but tasty. Solid feel, good drinkability. Solid quaff."
"Drinkability - wow, for all the flavor and nice mouthfeel here, this beer's damn drinkable! No ABV listed, but I can't feel it halfway through so I'm guessing it's in the 4-5% range. Also, this beer was VERY cheap considering. I want to pick up a 6 pack in the future."
"What a unique find! Black lagers other than German Schwarzbiers aren't too common. This beer has a great roasty aroma with no hop in the nose at all. It pours a deep brown/black color. It is very light on the tongue, and very clean like a schwarzbier. It isn't the most impressive beer, but very drinkable indeed!"
"Mouthfeel is true lager upfront with a nice roasted linger to make you wan another sip this is highly drinkable and a refreshing example of the style... Not standout but good and worthy of a try"
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, pale, crystal, and chocolate malt scent along with some slightly fruity yeast esters. The taste is decent. It has a smooth black and crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some light earthiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carobnation. This is a pretty good black lager. I like a little more crystal malt flavor, but this is a fine representation of the style."
"Enjoyed while watching the Australian GP last Sunday. Black/brown in the glass, decent (short lived) head. Smoky ""stout-like"" scent in the nose and in the initial taste, with a fairly rich dark malt flavor, though somewhat smoother (obviously, a lager) than a stout. Not quite as much of the rich, roasted flavor of a Schwarzbier, but very much like a quality Dunkel. A bit of astringent alcohol flavor emerges as the beer warms, reducing the ""drinkability"" rating a bit. Great offering, however. And thanks to ""N" for bringing it by."
"This beer is listed on BA as being brewed by Lion Brewery, but on my bottle it says McSorley's Brewery. Anyway it was hard as hell to find on BA. I poured the beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was really black. No head much and no lacing. Smell was slighly nutty as was the taste. A bit of chocolate made the beer tasty. I will buy again."
"D- I might've had another if I had one on hand. I feel like this is a beer you need to be in the right mood for. Not my favorite style, and I never would have ordered it in a bar, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I'd have it again if offered."
"Drinkability is rough on this beer. It isn't all that bad, but there is a bit of a dry and scratchy aftertaste that ruins the sip. It makes it hard to drink."
"The mouthfeel was medium to heavy and somewhat creamy. The taste was very much like its aroma of licorice and smoke with a vibrant but subtle hoppy sensation. Wow, I wish I picked up a 6-pack of this one."
"Overall- Not bad at all. The best that McSorley has to offer.?"
"i found this beer in wiiliamsport pa . pouring into a glass , it pours a nice black color , and if you like black this is for you , smell well it smell like beer, taste like nice dark larger that you want to drink again. good mouthfeel starst off nice and only get better drinkability is wonderful i think i found my beer to drink for a while until i get bored if you like dark euro largers or beers black in your glass i think there nothing better seeing black in your glass then try it you may like it"
"Pitch black beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is basically nothing.Taste is sweet with a hint of chocolate.Very watery and weak flavor.This is not by no means bad but it is not something I see myself buying again.I would probably recommend to try at least once but don't expect to get your socks knocked off."
"D - fairly easy to drink."
"It taste was grainy and even somewhat sour. It actually tasted like sourdough pretzels. It's sort of smooth, but just a bit too sour. I think I had this before at McSorley's bar in NYC and liked it better. But can't remember."
"Anywho, their is no website where this product is listed at all and googling ""Irish Black Lager"" turns up nothing on google... so the style of it is kind of a mystery. Could be a swarzbier, but played it safe with the ""Euro Dark Lager."" Pours a very dark brown with a small tannish colored head. Doesn't seem to offer too much smell wise, taste is a little underwhelming as well. A little bit of a smokey taste, light bodied, slight hop sweetness on the swallow. Not much going on here.. tried something new and can't say I enjoyed it too much, here's to trying the Irish Pale Ale next."
