"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of a Schwarzbier, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but when it came down it I found myself wishing that the roasted aspects weren't so covered up by the other aspects, but I thought the rest of this beer was pretty well done.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, fairly creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention so one bottle is enough for me, I don't have any urge to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, they were both good and they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the roasted malt aspects were very restrained and I wish they showed up more.  I don't think I would buy this again, but I wouldn't turn one down and I can't say I would recommend it as a great example of a Schwarzbier, but if you really like the style then it's worth trying.  All in all I liked this beer but I didn't love it, it was solid, but it still needed some work.  It's not my favorite beer from this brewery and i would say it's just  little above average for the style.  I think it's solid, but with a little more work it could be very nice, better luck next time guys."
"A lot lighter than it looks.  Some chocolate sweetness that is nicely countered by dry a dryer finish.  Very drinkable."

"Overall: Really sweet, toasted. Great flavors."
"I give this beer excellent marks, not only for it's complexity and drinkability but also its price- only 3-something for the bottle, which will be refilled many times with homebrew.  Purchased at Hennessey Grocery in Butte, Montana."

"Dark black in color and barely penetrable to light.  Light Brussels lacing.  A fingernail of khaki head covers less than a third of the top of the beer.  I smell plenty of dark and sweet mat.  There's a hint of smoke in the aroma.  The taste is comprised of sweet,dark malt.  The mouth is slightly sticky for a lager,but it is due to all of that dark,sweet malt."

"Overall not bad but not what I expected, not very good either for a German beer... plenty of nice toasty malts, but lots of grainy husky wheat and hay like flavors, not what I expected for a schwarzbier, also no real dark malt notes other than some caramel, and lager notes aren't the best even. The nice smooth soft feel was quite nice, and what I expect from a beer like this, but the rest was meh."
"O- Really good, well done."

"Overall Pretty cool schwarzbier that I have never seen before. Found it in JP and figured I really don't have much to lose. I could enjoy more of these in the future."
"500ml bottle. Nonic shape Mug. Very dark brown color & deep ruby tints to the light. Light beige froth, brief crown. Roasted & floral aromas, metallic hues. Burnt & dried upfront. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Watery texture. Black grain hints, smoky touch, & clean bitterness in the middle. Bitter cocoa & dried nuts notes in a long bitter finish. Licorice candy on the aftertaste."

"Nice version of the style. Drinkable and multi-layered. A very soft beer. Smooth. Worth trying."
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark chestnut amber with a one finger light tan head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass with wispy lacing. Aroma of sweet toasted malt, molasses, light nuts and a hint of hops. Flavor follows with toasted malt, a slight nuttiness, rye bread, finishes slightly dry with light grassy hops, faintly metallic. Light bodied with nice carbonation. The flavor is subdued, but very nicely balanced. Flavors are good enough that they make me want a slightly more intense version. Still nice schwarzbier that popped up in our market and is apparently a one time only arrival. I'll have it again if it shows up."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Poured from a bottle while in the Stuttgart area. This is a nice dark brownish black color. Smells are predominantly caramel and graham cracker. Tastes are light and sweet with more caramel and graham cracker and maybe some marshmallow. Very light bodied and light alcohol. Easy to drink and tasty."

"O: This beer is easy to drink but the taste lacks complexity."

"Taste wise it came to life a little: malty, semi-sweet and lively in the mouth feel. I've struggled with this style before: having trouble finding any strong flavours and any depth, this was better than most. Far from robust and flavoursome it did however have something about it. There are chocolate and coffee notes in the taste and it does feel a little richer than most German Black Lagers I've encounted. Considering the price (less than two pounds): this was a good deal."

"O: I’ve had a couple of Schwarzbiers and they all seem to have this same bland yet smooth flavor and aromas. It’s not a bad beer but nothing in it really stands out."

"Light on the palate. The flavors all meld together so well that you can enjoy it all in harmony without thinking about it, though it is more fun to do so. I could drink this with a chocolate mousse, a burger, or down a few of them just for fun. Not overly complex, but I think that's the point."
"Overall: an ok beer, didn't blow me away or else, would have it again but in somebody else dime."
"Rich malty aroma. The tatse is smooth and silky. There are not hops present. This is about the easiest drinking beer I have ever had. I could make this my everyday beer if it was available in the US. Thanks to my friend Georg in Baden Wuerttemberg for this and two other fantastic German Beers in my Christmas package."
"0,5 liter bottle. Pours an opaque coca-cola black with a nice frothy light brown head, good lacing. Aroma roasted malts, chocolate, bread, and a hint of spicy hops. Flavor is burnt and roasted malts, bread, a touch of metal, and a slight bitter finish. Medium body, dry on the tongue, fairly carbonated, and a slight bitter finish at the end. Decent schwarz, pretty drinkable."
"500 ml bottle. Black colour, brown head that dissipates too quickly and leaves no lace, not what one expect for the style. Bad start. Smell is roasted, some coffee and a bit metallic. Taste is a little better, but very fainty, coffee, caramel, roasted. I was expecting much more from this one. At least is drinkable."
"Loved it."
"Prosit, MK"
"Overall, an incredibly standard schwarzbier. Well-done, but nothing special."
"Very interesting style, I'll look out for more ""blackbeers"" in the future."
"Drinkability: A good sipping beer. Sweetness of the malts not too strong and a slight essence of the hops to let you know they are there but not so pronounce as to deviate from style."
"I was expecting a little more from this, the appearance was great but thats where it ended."
"This brew is light in alcohol but full in body. Definitely this is good to go with venison or some smoked cheddar."
"Drinkable, but not character. Drinkable, but anonymous."
"This was a good black beer but is by no means the best."
"Almost black with light tan head, and good lacing. Smells spicy and sweet with a hint of cocoa. Taste is very sweet with little bitterness. Mouthfeel is mediud-full with good carbonation. This beer is a nice change of pace, but I could not drink it too often."
"Taste is sweet, malty, litle oxidised but still fresh mostly cause there seems to be a lemon/lime arome with it. Aftertaste misses litle bitterness but is clean and sweet. The thickness opf the brew makes mouthfeel ok but it misses some bitterness( in my opinion). Drinks easy but sweetness is so big that for me this 0.5l botle was enough. Good beer especially for sombody who likes it sweet and without to much bitterness."
"I really enjoyed this beer (several actually) and would pick it up if I ever see it again."
"Stern."
"The blackest of black lagers. Malty, bready nose. Dark, dark brown color that leads to a tobacco-y taste support by pumpernickel flavors. A little chocolate and nutty. Bitter, dry finish. Overall quite thin with a gritty mouth feel. Roasty taste is fantastic until the end when a metallic overtone takes charge and ruins the follow-through. OK offering, but not great. Fine hop character, just wish they would lose the metal taste."
