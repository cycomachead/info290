4.33,20.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This a great example of the style. Malty, toasty, a tiny hint of smoke, faint bready and sweet malts. Clean crisp dry finish, medium bodied with good carbonation. Refreshing balanced and flavorful. So on point for the style.","dorosjim","Jan 24, 2015"

3.54,-1.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours brown with white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of grassy hops, grain, caramel and bready malt and some black cherries. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of caramel malt, bread crust and herbal hops. Finish is long and herbal, semi-dry. Overall it is good brew, but taste more like Dunkel than Schwarz beer.","mikeg67","Jan 24, 2014"

2.86,-20.3,4,3,2.5,3,3,"I dont really get any hop presence and there is no alcohol to speak of either. The beer is easy to drink, but almost to a fault. Not too much going on here and only the faintest of roast malt on each finish reminds me I am drinking a beer. A little disappointed here, but wasnt expecting to be blown away anyway.","sulldaddy","Jul 04, 2012"

3.45,-3.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dark black with clingy tan foam. Laces. Chocolately malty smell. Some coffee notes. Taste is a light creamy dark malt. Coffee flavored. Very mellow. Little hop bite at the close. Milky. Pretty good beer.","KTCamm","Apr 13, 2012"

3.5,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The pour was as I expected - dark, a bit of head, and nearly no carbonation. There was virtually no lacing here either and this had a pretty thin appearance and taste to it. Lots of pumpernickel and a strong roasted presence to this but both of those faded quickly after each sip. Had this been a bit more creamy, it would have reminded me of an Irish Dry Stout, but there's just not a lot here to remember. This was like a flat soda without the caramel and sugary aftertaste.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 08, 2012"

3.53,-1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This poured out as a dark brown color with a fizzy cream colored head on top. The head fades away and leaving just a small foamy ring around the edge of the glass. The smell of the is lightly roasted with the earthy funk of what most lagers have. The taste is malty with some decent toasted notes. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, decent carbonation also. Overall it's not a terrible brew. Its better than I remember it being the first time I had it.","Knapp85","Jan 15, 2012"

3.73,3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Picked up a single from the Wegman's in Allentown. It pours a dark brown with a tall off-white head. The body is thicker and creamy, like an oatmeal stout. There's a little roast in the aroma and flavor, a hit of dark fruit, and a mild dry cocoa flavor in the finish. There's a bitter bite in the finish a la Irish stout for a pleasant finish. The mid-flavor is a little bland, the flavors aren't popping, but it's still a tasty beer worth checking out.","tempest","Nov 15, 2011"
3.88,8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: A decent session beer, nice to have on a cool fall night. As long as you don't grab a bottle of this expecting to get blown away, you will not be dissapointed. Consider this a decent alternative for someone who drinks Newcastle, but wants something a little more mild.","benetoh","Oct 26, 2011"
