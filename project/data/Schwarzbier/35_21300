3.53,-4.6,,,,,,"Overall (3.53) : A decent try but Shiner definitely has this one beat. I like the flavors more and the roast comes out better in Shiner's version. This beer focuses more on milk and honey aspects, not so much on the roast and toast. It's still a decent beer, though, and I'd drink it again.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 28, 2014"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 8/2014. Pours crystal clear deep brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, plum, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, plum, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, chocolate, roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 27, 2014"

3.94,6.5,4,3.75,4,4,4,"what a fantastic black lager. the best of both worlds here, almost as much a baltic porter as a schwarzbier really, robust malt profile, earthy and heavily roasted, with a nutty middle and a lot of body for such a quick finish. dark in color too, pushing black, with a matte finish, well carbonated, and thin on the head. it smells nutty and toasty like good roasted barley, but not bitter or super dense like some can be, this stays light while holding onto that extremely deep dark grain element. really a great success here. lager yeast has a lot of flavor this time around, and with the dark malt, its like the burnt flakes on the crust of a properly cooked wood fired pizza, it has that char and dough thing working well for it. hoppy too for an almost macro brew, biting in the finish, more than balancing to the flavoring level, but its all in excellent proportion. lively carbonation makes it feel rather light for its color, and it ends up being a sessionable and quenching drink. sam adams has some really solid basic beers in their lineup, and this is a prime example that beer doesnt have to be complex to be delicious.","StonedTrippin","May 22, 2014"

But it could be better. You do get a smoked sense with the brew that is pleasant. But drink QUICKLY. And one bottle at a time. Because the qualities will evaporate. Flavors will die and carbonation disappears. Drink this decent beer I say still. And search out for authentic imported Schwarz biers.","shacawgo24","Jan 13, 2014"

Aroma is dark malty chocolate, some definite roast, with bite that makes it not super sweet. Flavor follows closely, with big roast and a bit of bittersweet chocolate. Interestingly, I didn't get much smoke from this, more roast to me. Rather rich mouthfeel for the ABV, and a pretty solid brew.","BMMillsy","Oct 17, 2013"

Color was a deep brown with garnet highlights and seemingly good clarity, allowing for its extremely dark color. Nose smelled of cocoa powder and I was reminded of my Lunch Duty partner who seems to to really dig on chocolate. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite cocoa/smoky taste on the tongue. She claims not to like beer, but I would bet that she would totally dig this. For me, it was a bit too sweet, but not cloying, which I really dislike. Finish was semi-sweet and a decent drink for the style, even if not my bag.","woodychandler","Mar 16, 2013"

The head recedes somewhat slowly, leaving some lacing behind on the glass. Lacing is left behind on the glass during consumption. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, toffee, chocolate, and some hints of spiciness from the hop varieties that were selected (spalt and hallertau mittelfruh). The flavor is malty with some mild toffee, mild chocolate, water, and some hop spiciness. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Feb 03, 2013"

Taste was the same - I couldn't even call it smoky, really. Some malty flavor in there. Maybe a touch of chocolate and toffee. Seems a bit sour as well, especially as it warmed up. I am not seeing how this example matches with the definition of the style - I didn't find any hops character to it. Other than being light on the mouth feel and well-carbonated I don't see it fitting the overall style.","LeRose","Nov 27, 2012"

Decent fare, and likely excellent entry-level beer for anyone making the transition into craft beers due to its approachability and the fact that it won’t blast your palate silly, but doesn’t quite keep up with its heavier-hitting peers.","jondeelee","Aug 13, 2012"

3.6,-2.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark, clear, with a darkish off white head. Nice head and lacing. A light covering remains as I drink. Aromas of dark breads and deeply roasted grains. Some molasses and toasted pumpernikel. A bit of yeasty fruit esters. Taste is much like the nose with a clean crisp signature. Finish is roasty and mildly hopped with earth and a bit of charcoal that folds itself into a dark bread with a thin spread of brown rice syrup. A tea leafiness and lingering dryness. Feel is smooth and crisply carbonated with a medium weight. A solid beer overall with much to enjoy.","scootny","May 04, 2012"

The nose is malty which I was expecting, with some light molasses or perhaps honey scent. Light, but pleasant. I love the taste of this. For 4.9% alcohol, this feels like a very full beer, like there is a lot going on with it. Initially a very sweet malt taste, and as it goes down, the taste leads to some subtle hoppy bitterness, and ends with a smokey whiskey style taste. Love the taste. Mouthfeel has some good carbonation that perfectly fits what this is going for. Definitely will get this beer again.","ely2000k","Jan 19, 2012"

The boldness relaly hits the taste buds. I'm getting some chalky roasted malts and a slighty nutty flavors with a little bit of bitter finish. Drinks quite well on a cold night. The texture could be a little thicker though and if it had a few more bolder elements, this beer would be getting some 4.5's and 5's.","Lemke10","Nov 11, 2011"

A nice dry, bitter hop presence up front with good puny flavor lingers troughout and provides nice balance. This is followsd by the sweet, slightly roasted malt presence that gives off hints of caramel, toffee, hazelnut and toast. Not overly complex but well balance, flavorful and easy to drink.

The head was thin and off-white...some lacing. The smell includes roast and sweet malt...like molassis. The taste had an interesting mixture of roast, malt, caramel, and hops.

No lacing. On the nose, bitter coffee, lots of prominent malt, some light milk chocolate. Not much hop to speak of. A little bit of smoke. On the palate, more of the same. Sour and bitter coffee. The smoke is more prevalent. Lots of malt, but it's dry, not sweet at all. The flavor is almost that of a stout mixed with club soda, which is pretty true to style. Very bubbly. Good beer.

3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"	First sip gives me a lot of that maltiness. It’s rich, but not heavy. Not thin bodied, either, but somewhere in between say a porter and a brown or amber ale. I definitely get a front-loaded sweetness that turns dry on the end. It’s well carbonated, and the carbonation keeps it from feeling heavy in spite of the malt body. I don’t expect any hop profile but I’m trying to pick up on the Bavarian Noble hops the label identifies, just for my own edification. I’d finish the night with this one but I wouldn’t have two in a row.","elNopalero","Sep 17, 2011"
3.27,-11.6,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Overall: I'm not one to hate on Sam Adams, far from it. The Irish Red in this pack was ok, and the Oktoberfest, Rauchbier, and Pumpkin Ale were enjoyable. This one just doesn't do it for me though. There isn't the nice Munich toasty background, nor the roast intensity that make the good German schwartzbiers, and this tastes more like an ale, with the estery profile. It's not a BAD beer, per se, but I don't see myself ever buying a sixer of it (unlike Sam's Cream Stout, which is pretty tasty).","BedetheVenerable","Sep 16, 2011"

Aromas are rich and robust, with a heavy sour malt and toasted oats balance. The beer has some interesting flavors, with rich and darkly sweet malt profiles of chocolate and molasses, and a bitter coffee character that balances, along with some roasted highlights. The beer leaves a decent, light lacing along the glass while you drink. The aftertaste is mostly coffee, with a slight linger to the dry-roast taste, and the beer has a tangy, mid-lingering finish.

Very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of the Schwarzbier had notes of burnt malt, caramel and chocolate. It has a nice medium body and is malty and hints of carmel. There was also some sweetness that balanced this beer out. This is a nice example of a Schwarzbier- It is a little sweet but it would be a great ""starter"" beer to give someone.

It pours a dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of slightly dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises toasted toffee, plenty o' cocoa, and a touch of light coffee. The taste doesn't deviate too far from this, though the cocoa is definitely dominant here (especially as it warms, making a sort of light version of a milk stout after a while). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice schwarz, one of the best regulars Sam Adams puts out.","TMoney2591","Apr 15, 2011"

The roasted/sweet/thin body combination doesn't work well. This needs more body and Carmel malts for me.

The only thing that separated this and a porter was that this had a thinner mouthfeel and wasn't as thick in body and flavor. It's like in between a brown ale and a porter really. Very nice almost coffee like roasted malt smell and taste. It ends with a tiny bit of Noble hops to match up with the subtle bitterness coming from the roasted dark coffee like malt.

Color is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart, can't get any darker than that, although with a strong light shining through the brew, it is actually a very dark reddish brown. Smells of a hint of caramel, coffee, chocolate, sweet burnt malt, and roasted wheat. Flavor is bold but not overpowering. Sort of a sweet coffee taste with caramel and chocolate. The malt flavor seems to have some cinnamon hints. A little wimpy in my mouth, some sense of fullness, but just not quite the zip I was hoping to feel.

The aroma is very feint, just a hint of sweet malt. The taste is mild malty but turns slightly sour at the end that throws of my taste buds.

Light fruitiness, touch of metallic, and subtle hints of chocolate, toast, and toffee. I guess the best way to describe all of this is ""delicate."" The taste is a touch more assertive, which I enjoy. It has more of a chocolate/carob character to it and caramel nicely supports it as well. Raisins come out in the finish, adorned by a slightest touch of coffee beans. Mouthfeel is somewhat slick and light with a nicely executed carbonation. Very smooth indeed. I was gonna give it a 3 but that carbonation is just spot on perfect IMO. A good, drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding or ""holy crap this is &%^%*#! awesome"" but not a yuck beer either.

The taste has similar notes to the smell, and it is just as mild. I for some reason seem to taste a bit of corn syrup in the taste, though it may be due to the caramel roast being as weak as it is.

On the nose are aromas of BBQ smoke, ground coffee beans, dark chocolate, & roasted hazelnuts that follow through on the palate. The beer is light bodied, crisp, smooth, & full of flavor with a pretty aggressive carbonation (kind of like Coke). The lingering flavors on the lasting finish leaves me with an overall good impression. This beer is very sessionable & I could easily see myself grabbing a sixer of this for my next BBQ.

Bitterness melded nicely with the dark grains, giving it a bittersweet chocolate character. Malt dominated, but a kiss of hop flavour and bitterness were evident towards the finish.

The taste is chocalately from the malt. There is also a slight spice from the hops, but the malt clearly dominates. The flavor of this is nicely mild and does not overpower the palate, which I enjoy in this case. The mouthfeel is light and complements the mild flavor. This is one of the few beers I can have a lot of without being overpowered by the flavor. Thus I find this brew extremely drinkable and a favorite session beer of mine.

A faint hop spice accompanies the roasted malt nicely. Medium/thin mouthfeel- the carbonation seems a little excessive.

The nose has malt sweetness and figs and coffee, almost like a stout. The taste is really nice and balance initially sweet followed be enough hops to round out the flavor.

Flavor is more roasty, with dark chocolate and some char to go along with some light caramel. Hops play a minor role but are spicy in nature and a welcome spot of balance.

It had a minimal malt aroma and a trace of caramel sweetness, but not the strong nose I had expected. Tastes like roasted malts with some sweetness of chocolate and caramel. Over carbonated and thin, very disapointing. A very drinkable beer, if you like thin, weak, overly carbonated false advertising. I can not understand the fascination with the swill these guys pump out. I try and go into every Sam Adams beer with an open mind but always walk away scratching my head. Just once I would like to say ""this is a great Sam Adam's Beer!"" Sadly I cannot say that here.","Pleepleus","Oct 03, 2008"

It smells of burnt malt with a touch of caramel. It tastes exactly the same way but I can detect a little coffee flavor mixed in as well. This beer has a very pleasant flavor and a fantastic mouthfeel. It looks thick but I soon found out that that the opposite is true. It's light flavor and dark color make one interesting brew. I feel like this beer can stand up to most Schwarzbiers. Very drinkable and recommended.","BeerMark","Oct 01, 2008"

The aroma was deep and ""blackened"" like charred meat, burnt malt and hints of hops at the end. The flavors were at first of bittersweet chocolate followed by black coffee and then at the end the smoky and blackened flavors kick in. Nice malt and hops balance but the finish is so black I find it hard not to think it would put many off. The mouthfeel is also a little off, too much carbonation causes it to be frothy and hard to enjoy for a beer this dark. It's not a bad beer, but it's also not a good example of the German schwarzbier style.","thekevlarkid","Sep 30, 2008"

Hints of burnt wood and bittersweet chocolate linger in the end. Not super big on flavor but in perfect balance.

It still has that delicious Hershey's Special Dark flavor and it's still creamy and smooth with little carbonation. For some reason I like it a little bit better this time.

Two-inch light tan head stretched from the stripe surrounding the glass, up to the lip and slightly over the top. Head was almost Guinness-esque out of the bottle, finally settling into a thin consistent layer of foam. Fair amount of lacing with decent adhesion. Scents of roasted malt and coffee; not overpowering but nicely balanced. Taste similar to nose with the addition of a subtle chocolate character and a mildly bitter hops presence at the finish.

There is a malt presence, perhaps you can pick up some smoke, in the smell but there's no defining smell. The taste picks up coffee and chocolate malts, more of the later because there isn't a drying, sharp afterbite at all. The label says caramel, and I didn't really taste it, but that coupled with the less hops could be why it is a very smooth, slippery beer.

This is a rather chewy beer with lots of character. I'm tasting some sweet malts, toasted bready grains, caramel but not overly sweet or cloying, some cocoa hints, maybe a tad bit of heavy fruit of the prune or fig variety.

The chocolate flavors are good, the hop bitterness is right, but perhaps this beer is a bit too thin?

A perfect break from those stronger drinks, but still getting that distinct flavor. I was seriously considering giving this a 4.5 on taste, but might hold off on that.

Its a subtle beer with a rich flavor and a light body. If you like dark beers this is an easy one to drink but it lacks the heaviness that you may be looking for.

A bunch of lacing is left on the surface. Licorice, chocolate, and roasted coffee are present in the smell, which is good, but none are dominant nor are they all that inviting. There is a citrus hoppy sourness that is immediately evident in the taste which is then followed by a touch of chocolate and finishes dry. Mouthfeel is thin - not that this is bad, but with darker beers I expect more creaminess or body, this is quite thin.

Color is a dark brown with a touch of crimson, and brilliant. Carbonation seems rather gentle on the tongue, and overallthis seems to just glide effortlessly across the palate. The base of this drinking experience is provided by the roasted and dark malts, with echoes of the toffee and caramel from the nose, along with a lighter taste of espresso and just a touch of light biterness. Yet there are some delicate fruit notes as well, light notes of ripe red apples and sour cherry, and yes, it's also a touch metallic - but in a good way. Samuel Adams Black Lager might strike some as light or thin on the palate, but it's on style, and moreover is far less a 'big beer' than an excellent session drink.

Would certainly drink again.","builder53","Jan 16, 2007"
3.95,6.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured a deep black , clear yet almost opaque with darkness. The head was a half inch , tannish , and dissipated to a ring. The aroma is roasty malt , some chocolate , faint coffee, and a bit of bready quality. Mmmm , a refreshing , light-dark beer! By light i mean in body/ overall impression. Pleasant deep roasted character , darker chocolate flavors , some light sweetness in the form of caramel , very lightly spicy hops keep things clean and fresh near the finish , ends with a bit of dry , bittersweet chocolate. This is one of my favorite beers from the BBC. Great to grab when you want something fairly light , but full of roast and flavor. A refreshing black tonic!","Byeast","Jan 14, 2007"

This was one tasty brew. The color is, as you might expect, a pretty solid black. The head wasn't especially substantial compared to the Boston Lager, but it was still fair sized and on the creamy side. I've always liked the looks of black beers anyway, so I rate the appearance of this one pretty high. Smell is pleasant. Dark roasted carmel malt, a slight hint of coffee, and alcohol. Not very hoppy. Taste was great. Its smooth and rich with a little sweet, and a little bitter, with some coffee in the background again. Hop presence is not strong here either. Mouthfeel was also pleasant. Unlike a stout, this is a medium bodied beer. The drinkability is pretty good for the same reason. Its not very heavy and the bitterness doesn't weigh you down. This is a real winner here. Sort of like the Yuengling ""Porter"" (to which this is actually quite comparable since Yuengling uses a lager yeast for that beer) taken up a notch. This will be a regular so for me so long as the Boston Beer Co is kind enough to keep brewing it.","casualbeerman","Jan 02, 2007"

The nose is rich with caramel malt, softly roasty, with that signature bit of Sam Adams ""bite"". It's hard to place. I'm not sure if it's a slightly agressive hopping, or some extra graininess to the malt. Whatever it is, it comes through as some harshness in the flavor, as compared to european style couterparts. The black lager is one of the smoothest of the Sam Adams offerings, probably a great beer to get started on dark beer. Anyways, the flavor comes off a bit different than the aroma. Much smoother, most notably. Very european, with a silky smooth texture and fine, tingly carbonation. Mellowed caramel sweetness is tempered by some roasty, toffee-ish notes. Very clean. I can't pick up any off flavors. Perhaps a bit of plum esters, which only works with the beer. Mild noble hops in the finish, riding out clean and dry. Solid roastiness in the end, kinda coffee-ish. Present, but not dominating. Maybe a little fuller flavored than the average german schwarzbiers, but nothing stands out enough to make this particularly unique. They nailed the style, for sure, and it's very drinkable. I'll have to pick up a sixer of this next time I'm heading to a party.","UnionMade","Dec 07, 2006"

The chocolate and roasted malt comes through in the taste a bit of spice is evident too. The body is light, smooth and a little bubbly.

And, Sam Adams Black Lager is a very good representative of the style and I think a good choice for a transition beer for those moving into the micro world. Beer pours a dark brown to black, but has enough copper tones around the edge as to not be too scary. Head is thick and rocky, and the colored of the inside of a malted milk ball. Which is appropriate with the strong chocolate taste and a not so subtle hint of coffee underneath. No hop aroma, and the nose is very light but some fruity undertones. Very smooth and easy to drink, except for a bit of a carbonation bite. I like the beer a lot; however, the mouthfeel is a bit light and doesn't fill up my mouth with the taste and the end of the beer is watery with no final punch.

Caramel malts are dominant but the darker malts add great complexity here. Very appealing. I'm new to this style. It's darker than a brown ale, and definately not as intense in the dark malts as a porter, and distinctly a lager for another twist. Mouthfeel is thich and full, but slightly more carbonated that desirable. Excellent drinkability and all around, this is Sam Adams? Impressive. I actually think I'd reccomend this beer more often than I'd drink it most likely. I doubt I'd buy a sixer of it too often, but I can see friends enjoying it and picking up a single for myself from time to time. with my only concern being that most people might at first be unaacustomed to the german hops and lager yeast characteristics when expecting a dark stout like beer by appearance.

This beer is thin like the lager name suggests but packs a flavorful punch, and because of such a great mouthfeel it drives the ease of consumption.

A pint glass reveals a nice deep, very dark chestnut (no it's not actually that black) hue with a rapidly dissipating burnt ivory head. In fact you have to pour somewhat aggressively to achieve a decent head to begin with. Roasted toffee greets the nose as you notice a chocolaty malt flavor, followed by an almost Dry Irish Stout-like bitter finish. The medium body however lends itself to more social drinking, but I'm not so sure I could drink to many in one sitting. I'll try.

Black at first sight, but then allows amber highlights to perminate. Promising, lightly tanned head retention starts off thick and creamy, but fades quickly under the lighter than expected body. Moderatly malty sweet with roasted grain (not quite coffee) bitter balance. A light cocoa flavor adds character and complexity. Low hopping allows for grain to supply bitterness.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a damn tasty and drinkable beer, one of the best Samuel Adams beers. I had this a year ago in Ohio at a party and it struck me as sort of a light porter that was just OK as a beer. Now that I have seriously tasted this it is an exceptional Schwarzbier. No doubt some of the goodness here is having an outstandingly fresh bottle that hasn't made the sea journey from Germany. Having qualified this it is a very good example of the style.","Zorro","Dec 01, 2005"

As long as they keep making beer like this, I'll continue to be a fan. The Black Lager pours black, as the name suggests, with a thin tan head. The aroma opens up a bit as the beer warms. Filled with a malty sweetness with some chocolate and perhaps caramel. The taste is mostly sweet chocolate and caramel, neither of which ever becomes overpowering or cloying. There's a bit of a biscuit element in the background. It finishes with a slight roasted bitterness and an even slighter bit of hoppiness. The mouthfeel is a bit light, but no more so than most Schwarzbiers. You can definitely tell this is a lager. The drinkability is superb. This is a great tasting beer that would be great to bring to a party. None of the tastes overwhelm or challenge your palate, but they all come together to form a tasty beverage.","Hagbard","Nov 28, 2005"

The blend of tastes is superb. Very smooth. Due to the beer being sweet I couldn't drink too many of these in a sitting. I really enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying more of this style.

Flavorwise the beer doesn't have the bittersweet nature of a porter - rather, its clean, with a maltiness and some caramel notes blending with a faint chocolatey character. Hop presence seems just there to balance.

Then moves to a more creamy, milky flavor. Chocolate sits in the background until the finish which leans on the sweet side. Hops are there and provide balance and some bitterness the whole way.

3.53,-4.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,2.5,"Pours opaque, nearly black with a ruby tint. A tan, three finger head with a creamy consistency and good retention that leaves spiderweb lacing. Noble and floral hops in the nose, with a roasted malt aroma and raisin or fig scent. Bitterness is mild, and comes mostly from the hops. Sweet dark fruit flavor from the malt gives it a decent balance. Mouthfeel comes off very smooth with a middle of the road body and carbonation; but the hops fail to dry the sweet finish, and the drinkability suffers.","PBRstreetgang","Aug 25, 2005"
3.7,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Best before Sept '05 on the bottle. I'm pleased anytime an American brewery crafts their version of a Schwarzbier. This one pours a deep mahogany, not quite black. Thick foamy head quickly reduces to a thin lace around the glass. Nose has some charred malt and hazelnut aromas. Imparts some dark chocolate and a nutty peanut buttery flavor balanced by a quick mild hop zing in the finish. Love the fact that its sub 5%-ABV...such an easy drinker, and a true session beer for sure. Mouthfeel is a bit acrid and spritzy on the tip of the tongue at first, but graduates to a smoothness in the finish.

Aroma suggests a lagerlike slickness blended with the roastiness you'd expect from a porter or stout. Low amount of noble/spicy hop aroma. Flavor is sweet malt dominant, not really roasty at all. It is on the sweet side of the style--almost too sweet. I was expecting a drier beer. Mouthfeel is medium. Finishes slightly roasty and malty. Could use a bit more bitterness, but overall a pleasant experience.","EagleTalon","Jul 29, 2005"

3.89,5.1,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer is a pitch black that lessens on the side where a dark amber allows a little light through. It poured with a finger of head that didn't leave much, if any, lacing on the glass. The beer's aroma swept over my nose with a caramel maltiness that is intoxicating in itself. Something to really close your eyes and just linger over as you allow that idea of the taste to just appear in your mind. The taste mimics the smell but with a bigger chocalate character that introduced itself as it started down my throat. The mouthfeel was definitely on the lighter side. I'm a big fan of porters, and this reminds me of something like a porter light, almost reminiscent of what a Pino Noir is to other red wines. This beer is not overly heavy, and something that has made me want to finish a few more of these tonight, and explore this style more - if not this particular beer.","edmundfitzoil","Jul 25, 2005"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,2.5,4.5,"Pours a translucent blackish-brown with a thick tan head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is roasted chocolate, molasses and light grainy scent. Taste begins with a chocolate and roasted flavor, followed by a thin grainy flavor that subsides into a molasses sweetness, and a light hops bittering at the end that meshes well with the roastiness. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, even for a lager really. Drinkability is quite good, another very drinkable and flavor offering from BBC.","silver0rlead","Jul 19, 2005"
3.78,2.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours with a thick, frothy full tan colored head that sits atop a deep amber colored beer that shows clear ruby highlights when held up to the light. The aroma is fairly tame with notes of chocolate, and astringent roast coffee. The taste is smooth and almost creamy up front, it then moves to a malty sweet note that accentuates the notes of chocolate that are also found in the taste. It finishes with a bit of hoppy spiciness and a lightly biting bitterness. The chocolate notes of this beer are the most noticeably and make for an easy drinking smooth beer. This is a pretty good attempt, but I must admit I like a bit more smooth roast character in my Schwarzbiers.","Gueuzedude","Jul 17, 2005"

Its a very roasted, even burnt aroma. Theres not a lot of sweetness in this brewjust a hint in the foretasteinstead, the flavor centers on the nice roasted characters. Theres a little caramel, a little charcoal, and a little chalkiness. Just a small amount of hop bitterness in the finish, which is pretty dry.

I've found this with a lot of schwartzbiers though, so I think some of my opinion may be based on the fact that this is not one of my favorite styles. I do give SA credit for branching out into an often overlooked style which tells me they're quite all about profits yet. Its a quite drinkable beer though, wouldn't make a bad session brew I think.

A little sweet marshmallow in the back, and finishes with enough tannic astringency to clean up. Nicely done, particularly for what is now a ""better quality macro brewer.""

The taste is primarily of an excellent chocolatey malt. Subtle flavors of roastedness, nuttiness, and spice add layers of complexity. For me, Samuel Adams Black Lager is addictively tasty.

It wasn't comlex and interesting, like a stout or a porter is, but instead it was, like I already said, refreshing and pleasant to drink. It went down easy, and for something other than ales at the end of the day, this was a goody.","MDekker","Apr 30, 2005"

The caramel malts really come through in the taste section and a good bit of the roasted flavor towards the end, but finishes crisp and smooth. I don't really taste the hops, but the label says it's lightly hopped, so maybe the sweet malts are just to powerful for my taste buds.

Pours a very dark brown, almost black as the label suggests, but not opaque, you can deifnately see through the sides, a tint of red there too. Small head. Smell and taste are really spot on for the style, which I am newly getting accostomed to and liking a lot. I pick up a nice creamy milky character, nice burnt malts, and spicy dusty notes which I really love. Almost dirty smelling but in a good way. Really great smooth mouthfeel.

Pleasantly surprised by this one, I thought it was a pretty decent offering, especially by a US brewery of a style that not just anybody brews up on a regular basis. Pretty dark cola in color, but there's some nice reddish highlights in the bottom of my glass. Head when poured was like 1.2 inches thick, but has since died down to the top of the brew, very thin now. I think the aroma is the most 'authentic' aspect of this brew...it is right on as a German Schwartzbier. Rich malt, natural breadi/yeastiness that has a prescence, but isn't overwhelming. Tastewise, the first sip is really good, nice and malty. Seems to get a wee bit sweeter while drinking, but really an easy beer to turn into a session when you don't want to go overboard. Medium mouthfeel. I'd get it again.","PatandDavid","Mar 31, 2005"

The taste is very similar to the aroma, with hints of caramel malts and a load of coffee adding to the collection of intense flavors and scents. The taste also finishes clean with no lingering bad aftertaste. The mouthfeel is just shy of a heavy-bodied beer. It goes down very smooth. My glass was emptied much sooner than I expected.

Its a touch light in color for my liking. The nose is robust, with a bit of roasted nuttyness and a very nice roasted maltyness, maybe a touch of coffee. The flavor is nice as well. Slight coffee, fairly healthy roasted nuttyness. Not a bad brew. The feel is moderate to full with a medium carbonation. I think I am going to have to grab a full 6 of this beer.

It was poured with a fair sized light brown head that broke down quite quickly but left nice rings of lace down the entire brew. The aromas of this brew are nice; solid chocolate and roasted malt flavors that might even be leaning to a burnt smell. The taste is definitely of roasted malts along with a chocolate flavor that seems to me as being quite smooth. Also notice a nice slight hop taste at the end that goes very nice with this brew, think you could completely miss it unless you are looking for it.

3.73,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Black in color, but reveales some dark brown, slightly red translucent. Big tan head, retention is not the best, but fades to leave a small creamy head with lots of foam sticking to the sides of the glass. Smell is very rich with toasted malt and strong chocolate and medium hops presence. Taste is very roasted and slightly carmel. No flavors are overwhelming and the sweetness stops just short of cloying. Maybe a little too much for a schwarzbier, but still not bad.","TastyTaste","Feb 02, 2005"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Sam Adams is very good at introducing good new product. This is no exception. Pours a dark chocolate with a decent head and lacing. Smell is smoky malt with coffee undertones. Taste is lightly sweet with a slightly tart finish. Hint of chocolate is also present. Mouthfeel is very stout like, with a nice dry feel and great dry finish. Very easy on the drinkability scale..refreshing with that great dry finish.","edchicma","Feb 01, 2005"
3.78,2.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a rich chocolate brown with a reasonable light khaki head. Aroma is of toffee and chocolate. Smells rich and creamy. Taste follows aroma. Nice rich toffee notes. Kinda like a subtle Heath Bar with chocolate and toffee notes. A little sweet and perhaps a little lacking in hops to balance, but seems to be on for the style. Mouthfeel is good with a decent amount of carbonation to balance out the sweetness. Drinkability is good, but I dont think I could do more than a couple due to the suiteness. A good solid brew from Sam Adams. I really wish they would but this in a 6 pack instead of the mixed six with the weak Hefe. My friend seems to think that SA got the idea for this when they were contract brewed at FX MATT and ripped off from Black Forest. This is much richer than that. Overall one of the better offerings from SA.","TinusTime","Jan 31, 2005"

3.7,0,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a pitch black color with a tan head. Great head retention. Sweet roasted malts, chocolate, and some coffee come out in the aroma. The taste was sweeter than I would prefere, but either way is was fine with me. Chocolate, carmel, and some hop flavor. Mabey the hops could have been stronger, but the bottle did say ""lightly hopped"". Had a medium kind of silky mouthfeel. I enjoyed this beer, and I would buy it agian.","Luigi","Jan 28, 2005"
3.95,6.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Nice to see SA continue to produce quality seasonals to go with their popular standards. Poured a dark brown, tinged with a bit of garnet, that looks nearly black when the glass is full. The head and lace were adequate. The taste was excellent, with an underlying sweetness balancing the dark malt flavors of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and a touch of coffee. A slight bitterness in the finish, which is covered well by this beer's distinctive feature, which is the pleasing length of the dark blend of roasted flavors.","farHillsBrewer","Jan 27, 2005"
4.1,10.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This lager has a nice dark cola color with a pretty decent tan head. The head collapses fairly quickly but laces the glass well. The smell is very inviting. The main scent is chocolate. The taste is also full of chocolate. Its not too sweet and not hoppy at all. The mouthfeel is very good. When I first poured it mouthfeel is where I was afraid it would disappoint but it did not. Drinkability is very good. This is a great beer to share with those people who are afraid of anything darker than MGD. It might open their eyes.","bigbubba","Jan 25, 2005"
3.5,-5.4,4,4,3.5,3,3,"As a style that I love for it's character as well as it's drinkability, this come up partially short. It has some flair and up-side, but it's limited by a heavyhanded, undying sweetness, and thus is a chore to drink in succession.","cokes","Jan 25, 2005"
3.57,-3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability & Notes: I wish there was a bit more hop bitterness to this I tad too sweet for my liking, either way its a delicious beer.","Jason","Jan 25, 2005"
3.95,6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Very decent schwarz! Sam Adams recent offerings (this, their Vienna Lager, and Holiday Porter, etc) have almost all very good, and excellent examples of their styles. The Boston Beer Company can certainly make a good beer when they try.","allengarvin","Jan 18, 2005"
3.79,2.4,4.5,3,4,4,4,"Pours out a deep dark brown with a nice full tan headskie. Full roasty flavor with thin mouthfeel. Hop balance is there, but not perfect. This is a very decent lager worth checking out. It is so good to see Boston Beer Company checking out new styles.","scottum","Jan 09, 2005"
3.65,-1.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Part of the ""Brewmaster's Collection"" series in the winter 12 pk sampler. Pours an opaque brown/black with a thick and firm espresso colored head. Smell is mildly chocolate with a big wiff of coffee mixed in. Tastes quite malty a rich. Lots of roasted malt meets you in the front. Coffee switches to a slightly sweet caramel, that is shortly lived. Almost a little milk creaminess for a second, and then a long moderately bitter/dry finish. Carbonation is well felt and mouthfeel is medium like a porter. Decent brew. I could have two, but to be honest, if you told me it was a porter, I'd never know otherwise.","yankeeheel","Jan 03, 2005"
3.78,2.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"I would certainly drink this again. Perhaps before their flagship brand, but after the Boston Ale. Its worth a shot, but if it is a porter you are looking for, get a porter. This will disappoint on that count. But definatly worth a try. Once again Sam Adams gives a good, solid if not spectacular effort.","TheJudge","Dec 27, 2004"
