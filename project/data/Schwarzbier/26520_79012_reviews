"16.9 oz bottle drank as part of a BJCP tasting group (Category 5: Bock - tagged on the drunken end) on 01/14/2015, poured into a snifter glass and drank over 15-30 minutes"

"The palate opens with juicy, bitter grapefruit juice and pine before segueing into a blend of caramel, toffee and cocoa before finishing with a wonderful juicy hop bitterness. Nutty, earthy, with hints of burnt sugar, the blend of flavors is particularly harmonious here, bringing to mind one of the better ABAs I've had, Hill Farmstead's Jimmy. Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is soft and creamy on the palate. The finish is just fabulous, especially the balance between the flavors of citrus hops, pine bitterness and the roasted malt flavors. Awesome stuff."

"Lovely balance of hops and roasted malts/coffee. Really high drinkability."
""

"Black with a plentiful fine foam head. Lots of glass sticking lace. Both the aroma and taste are a strong and well balanced combination of roasted malt and piney c-hops. Neither overpowers the other. Medium bodied and light carbonation, one of the best bottled beers I can recall."
"This one has a subtle devil may care attitude but respects the style completely. Wonderful!"

"o. Eeeked in to the Outstanding - especially given the lager category."

"Pours a clear dark brown with ruby highlights at the edges and a creamy fluffy tan head that persists forever. Aromas of floral spicy resinous hops with bits of bitter chocolate flakes and a hint of coffee. The flavor is rich chocolate and hints of coffee with a solid shot of earthy resinous hop flavor. Moderate hop bitterness lasting long into the finish of each sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Very nice black ipa, but it really does straddle the line of being a porter."

"O - The only prior experience that I have had with such a beer has been Wookie Jack, which I did not like. Perhaps I got an old one? Needless to say I was thrilled with the quality of this one. It was excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to those who enjoy IPAs, Porters, or anything in between."

"Overall I've always been a Schwarzbier fan and this one it top of its class. Mouthfeel of a stout with the hop bitterness of an IPA."
""
"Pours very dark mahogany into the Weyerbacher-labelled tumbler. Two-and-a-half fingers of tan, rough-topped head leaves attractive lacing. Really nice, pronounced olfactory presence: toffee, chocolate milk, roasted grain, alcohol. Taste is that of a quality schwarzbier with a certain hoppy tang that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms to a proper serving temperature. It's not outstanding, but certainly respectable and serviceable. Mouthfeel is a little aggressive, but adequately thick."
""
""
""
""
"O - The taste is what makes this beer worth seeking out. It has a distinctly old-school Pacific Northwest hop character that blends perfectly with the slightly bitter character of the roasted malt. And the lack of esters remind you this is 100% lager."

"The beer pours a deep, chocolaty brown with a massive head of creamy, sand colored bubbles. The head sits two finger’s widths above the glass with a nice lasting retention and a puzzle grid of thin lacing. On the nose, the beer smells delicately of roasted coffee beans and damp pine forests. Smooth dark chocolate works its way into the nose alongside musty earth and subtle dankness. The balance on the nose between hops and malt is quite nice and intriguing. As I sniff for longer I start to sense oranges dipped in chocolate, which is quite inviting. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with roast and hoppy bitters. The finish brings a splash of sweet chocolate and bready malts, and a pop of citric acidity also lingers in the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet citrus lemon, quickly falling into bitter pine resin and decadently toasted bread, blending roasted coffee and espresso bean flavors through rich dark chocolates. Subtle grass and herbal hops work their way into the finish alongside a beautiful burp of milk chocolate and toasted oatmeal bread. The aftertaste is of moderately bitter pine resin, which sticks to the roof of the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a middling carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel that provides nice drinkability and scrubs away some of the heavier roast and bitter flavors. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left with slight spittle in the cheeks, soft bitter burn down the middle of the tongue, and a sticky resinous feel on the roof of the mouth. Overall, this is a beautifully balanced hoppy lager. Terrific pine and roasted malts tango on the tongue in a way that I very much appreciate. The closest thing to compare this to would be an American Black Ale, but this beer is miles ahead of that style in terms of balance. This could please a hop head and a roasted malt lover at the same time. Another superb beer from Jack’s Abby."

"Pretty good beer in a relatively unexplored style for me. From the taste alone, it reminds me of the lager version of a ""black IPA"" when you take a porter malt bill and mate it with an IPA hop bill, only in this case, using bottom-fermenting yeast and a cold fermentation. I wish I had more of the style to compare to, but it's pretty good nonetheless, if roasty and piney are your thing."
""
""
""
"O - Roasted and chocolate, but no hop flavor, just the bittering."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Did age hurt this, was it this muddled from the get-go? I like Schwarzbiers and the prospect of a hoppy one was exciting, but this just seems like one that got overhopped, yet, not hoppy enough. I'd like to revisit this beer when it's fresher."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent enough brew. For me, the hops clashed just a tiny but with the roasted characteristics. Glad I had it, seems fairly representative of the style, but probably not a regular for me."
""
"Overall: Another nice Americanized interpretation of a lager by the folks at Jack's Abby"
""
""
""
"Overall - Underwhelming. It's good for a lager, but that can be said of most of Jack's Abby beers."

"Overall, this is great. Not sure if it would have been better back in March vs. May, but another solid Lager from Jack's Abby."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, definitely a solid beer. Tasted blind, I would have guesses this was an american porter. Would have liked to see the hop presence kicked up a touch more, but a very solid overall brew."

"Cheers!"

"The CS poured frothily from the .5 liter bottle, piling the tan head way over the top of my pilsner glass. Color is a deep rich brown and the aroma is primarily dark malts. with a hint of hops. This is an extrememly tasty beer, just fine for a cool spring day. Although the significant hopping does not intrude on the overall balance, this beer could use a little more ""middle"". This is obviously amped up from the traditional style but still in the family. I wonder what the draft version is like?? This one was kindly laid on me by Jamie Magee during a visit to Iron Hill Lancaster."

"O - A pleasantly hoppy schwarzbier, this was damn tasty and JA continues to amaze me with their innovative lagers."
""
""
"Pours wall to wall black. No color to be found. Beige head. Puffs up big with the initial pour. Good lacing and retention. Nailed the look. The aroma is heavy on chocolate, molasses and doughy malt. Some pine and citrus hoppiness in there, as well. There’s more sweet roasted malt character than I expect from the style. It’s a pleasant aroma, but it’s more of a schwarzbier on steroids than a hoppy schwarzbier, at least in my opinion. I’m getting a fair bit of roast fruitiness. Pretty rich. Clean lager flavor. The taste is fairly sweet and still quite rich. Lots of fudge and treacle. Big coffee and pine needle finish. Again, over the top for the style, but still a very well made beer and quite tasty. I’m still not convinced that big hops and big roasted malt works well together, but this is a pleasant enough attempt, and I’m sure fans of American Black Ales and whatnot will like this beer. Very creamy mouthfeel. A bit much for the style, but who cares. This is a very good beer, and I would have called it an ale in a blind tasting. Knowing it’s a lager, I can bit out some of that clean yeastiness, but the hops and malt are too big for me to have guessed right."

"I am a huge fan of what Jack's Abby does. They really did a nice job with this style beer."
""
""
""
"O: really yummy beer. Could be considered a black ipa. Nice mix of black patent and citrus hops. A great beer by Jack abby. Not surprisingly."
""
""
""

""
"O: My first review for this beer was with a less-than-fresh bottle but this time around it shines. A great beer for the transition from Spring to Winter. Another knockout from Jack's Abby."
""
""
""
""
"If the bottle didn't tell me it was a lager, I wouldn't believe it. A great balance of roast, burnt, and hops. The mouthfeel really elevated everything."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty much a Black IPA in lager form. Good stuff."
""
"It was hard to tell if i liked the flavor. I want to like it, as i absolutely love schwarzbiers. But the dank, green, tea-like hops dont mesh well with the malt flavor. Its strange because i typically love black IPAs, so I'm not aversed to dark malts and hops getting along. Ultimately, i think the strong cascade hop presence here ruins the schwarzbier rather than compliments it. As i drank it I wished i was just drinking a traditional black lager."
""
""
""
"O/D-Another Jack's gem. I wish all Schwarzbiers were like this. Would be one of the better Black IPAs I have had if it was one. A solid way to enter into the 1,000 review club."
"O: Black IPAs are all the rage these days, and Jack's Abby decided to get in on the action. Don't think for a second that this is simply a reflex 'jump on the bandwagon' type of reaction though. Never content to just follow the trends, Jack's Abby has put their own unique spin on the style, essentially creating a 'black IPL'. Lagers are, after all, the only thing they brew. This is a well made beer from start to finish. Clean and drinkable. Nice roasted but not burnt malt base, impressively bold and spicy hop profile. Yet another great entry into the increasingly diverse Jack's Abby portfolio of brews."
""
""
""
""
"Man, I love this beer. I really have no idea what a schwarzbier is supposed to taste like. All I know is this beer is delicious."
"Can't wait to try the Kiwi Rising I have stashed in the fridge downstairs in the cellar..."
""
"A black-brown color, thick and covered with a reasonable layer of light oatmeal colored head with fair lacing. The aroma is a smokey charcoal with a tart pear idea. Very pleasant. The flavor brings a tart malt and more smoky charcoal. There's a subtle herbal hop but it's really pretty simple and plenty good. Medium-light bodied with a fairly aqueous but slightly chalky feel. Carbonation is very refined but more than adequate for this style. I liked it and recommend it."

"Very impressive stuff. This bottling is fairly old from what I hear, but it has held up well. Hops have been reduced to more of a background note, but the excellent dark malt foundation is enough to carry the beer."
"Pours a very dark brown, but not quite black with a fluffy tan head. Smell is a really nice mix of hops and roasted malt/chocolate, not unlike a black IPA. The flavor follows the nose, thought it doesn't quite come together as well I had hoped after an awesome aroma. Both the hoppiness and roastiness of this beer are quite nice, but there's a bit more of a clash in flavors than I had hoped for. The two types of bitterness don't quite coincide as well as I've experienced in the best of black IPAs, and thus it comes off as a little overly bitter. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for the style and carbonation is high. It doesn't detract much from the experience, but it could use a little more body. Overall, this may be the first Jack's Abby beer that I wasn't absolutely in love with. I love schwarzbiers, but black IPAs are hit and miss for me and this beer comes closer to a black IPA than a schwarz. There's certainly a uniqueness to it, as it has some lager characteristics, but it could be a little more balanced."
""
""
"An enjoyable hoppy black lager that doesn't attack you with hops but uses them strongly and tastefully. I like the pine and spicy hop profile."
"I'm seriously impressed with this creation. I was worried about the hops dominating and destroying the flavor components that make a schwarzbier and schwarzbier, but the brewmaster certainly knows how to employ just enough to get the best out of the hops without compromising the style's key notes."
""
"Overall: Man, I think Jack's Abby is just killing it. I've had three of their beers and loved them all. This no exception...dark, roasty and hoppy. Very nice all around."
"D - Very drinkable. Really great smoothness and texture with a great balance of flavors. A really nice dark lager."
"O - Overall this is an excellent lager. Really delicious with wonderful aromas. Another great lager by Jack's Abby."
""
""
"Usually not a style I go crazy over, but I found this one quite pleasant. It was crisp and refreshing yet still maintained good roasty qualities."
""
"Taste is chocolatey dark sweetness to start, malts continue through rich body of the center, and hoppiness comes on strong to the close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is great as well. Nice one here."
"Notes: The up front hopiness is a little bit different but the smokiness makes up the rest of this vert tasty beer. Cheers."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a while."
"The feel of this beer is pretty smooth with a nice drinkable feel. This seems to just slide by with little effort I almost don't notice how much I have had."
""
""
"Nice concept and well-executed. I think this could use a touch more in the nose, but other than that this is a really nice brew."
""
"D - I don't think I could tell this is a lager in a blind tasting. However, I would still think it is a very enjoyable Cascadian Dark Ale. Kudos to Jack's Abby for bringing bold flavors to the lager side of things. Chris and I easily finished the 500ml bottle, and I'd have happily done so on my own."
""
"Overall- This is a great beer. Very easy to drink and it is not trying to be something it is not. Very well crafted beer. 4.5/5"
""
"Overall: Super drinkable nice and dry. I think this drinks a bit more like a black IPA than a schwarzbier. One of the better newer beers from Massachusetts. Also the price cannot be beat. I will get this again."
"A very tasty and fairly well balanced beer, however I found the body to be a little thin."
""
"Overall: Overall an enjoyable beer. Roasty flavor and bitterness the dominate characteristic in aroma and flavor. Color a bit dark for the style but otherwise appearance spot on- head was excellent! Beer finished dry and besides very minor astringency, mouthfeel was spot on for the style. Use of American hops with citrus aromas and flavors differentiates this from other Swcharzbiers, but not in a bad way. American hops worked well with the roastiness. Clean lager fermentation. A smooth roasty lager. Thank you Jack for providing non-traditional craft lagers to MA!"
""
"I'm looking forward to more from Jack's Abby. Congratulations!"
"Overall, a really nice and tasty offering from Jack's Abby. The lack of carbonation hurt this a bit, but I still really enjoyed it and found it easy to drink. I'm sure better QC will fix that in the future and make this even better."
""
"Taste-The taste was ok just a bit hoppy but I couldn't really taste much do to everytime I drank from my snifter I got the smell of marijuana in my nose and mouth. I would just recommend for the brewery they just tone down the hops a little bit."
"O- a great beer, i really love these beers, everything I've had from these guys have been impressive, and this is no exception."
""
""
"O: Jack's Abby does it again. Easily the #1 schwarzbier I've ever had. Tastes not far from a black IPA or american black ale or whatever you want to call it. Similar to the Hoppy Feet I had not too long ago. A little less hoppy makes the hops not stand out so far but the balance and drinkability is better. It's crisp, well balanced and very tasty. Hard to beat."
"Chocolate tastes a little funky with punchy citrus hops. No noticeable technical flaws in the beer though, very well crafted. My palate desires something else."
"A very good beer and another winner from Jack’s Abbey. Man, I love having these guys in our backyard."
""
"O: Really impressed with this black ""lager"". I definitely want to try more of their products."
"Overall very nice, the malts take the lead with nice caramel and chocolate, and a not of the lager comes through but it ads a nice crispness and soft feel. Hops are done well, it would be very easy to over do them, and all the flavors blend well to a really nice drinkable well done beer."
"What can you say, another great beer from JA. Again, tastes more like a stout or porter to me than a schwarzbier, but still... a great session lager."
"A bit thin feeling for all the flavor. This is a unique beer that is well worth trying. I really like the experimenting this new brewery is doing, blending American influence with traditional lager styles. Well worth checking out. I look forward to seeing how things develop at Jack's Abby."
""
"Prost!"
"hmmm. I love it, to be honest. Jack's Abby has found a niche. do what American Craft brewers have been revolutionizing over the last decade but apply it to traditional German styles. Its unique, but it falls somewhere between a nut brown ale, euro dark lager, black IPA, and baltic porter. It works very well for me. I could drink this by the growler-full."
""
""
"Overall, my first taste of this brewer, and I liked the twist on the style. The hop-driven brew, with a good sized kick of abnormal alcohol made this one unique and enjoyable. Clearly not an ale, but has a lot of characteristics of a black IPA. I actually like this better. Very worth a try."
