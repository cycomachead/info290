4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"My first Kiwi brew (and without kiwis no less...). It pours a translucent ruby-brown topped by over a finger of ecru foam, which leaves some decent lacing behind as it fades. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, and light florals. The taste holds notes of these elements, though instead of straight flowers, a light floral bitterness pervades. The body is a fairly light medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a solid schwarz. I hope I can get some more Kiwis if they're anything like this one.","TMoney2591","Apr 28, 2010"

It tasted light, with a good chariness to it, toasted malts and roasted espresso. It had decent drinkability because it was such a light drinking beer. Hands down, the only decent one that is passable for Montieth's if you have to go there- which I advise that you don't.","femALEist","Mar 10, 2010"

Mildly nutty, especially towards the finish. Very clean, I can't pick out any off-flavors. Hops are light but present with a touch of bitterness. Medium light in body with a medium level of carbonation, this finishes great with some mild bitterness.

Flavour is great and full of coffee, dark chocolate and malt. Quite sweet but very well balanced. A bit like treacle in flavour too but for a full bodied schwarzbier not sticky. This makes it more drinkable than some schwarz I've had even though the flavour is more restrained. I had this beer years ago and loved it. Now that I can get it easily I think it will be a regular. It's cheaper than the German gear and unlike those (which I love a lot) I can drink a few Monteith's without being overwhelmed by their bigger flavour. This is the best Monteith I've had so far.","rjimlad","Apr 06, 2006"

Tastes drier than the smell led me to believe. It's sweeter than average, but most of the flavor is just roastiness. Not much in the way of hops or bitterness but that would be too much I think. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy. A little harsh on the tip of the tongue, with light carbonation all over. All in all, it's very drinkable, fairly well balanced, nothing is really overpowering.

Mouthfeel is light to medium, more on the medium side if you ask me. I could see myself having a few of these, not bad at all.
