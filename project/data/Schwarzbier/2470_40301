1.97,-47.5,3.5,1.5,1.5,4,2,"O: This beer seemed rather unbalanced to me, with sweet cola and licorice really dominating the flavor profile as the glass went on, making it rather cloying. I would have liked to been able to enjoy the other flavors present, and maybe seen more bitterness coming from hops. Though it would be a totally different style if it even exists, this seems like what an imperial cream ale might taste like. If you're a fan of really sweet beers (or hey, pop/soda in general, which is usually too sweet for me) this one might be worth your time. I remain curious about the bready, fruity characteristics that many other reviewers noted but didn't seem apparent in my glass– maybe I'll need to revisit this, far off in the future.","AwYeh","Jun 11, 2012"

Pours clear extremely dark brown color with a foamy 1-2 finger khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, banana, clove, bubblegum, raisin, nuttiness, roasted malt, biscuit, and pepper. Some pretty nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, raisin, clove, bread, banana, nuttiness, and pepper. Lingering notes of pepper, clove, chocolate, roasted malt, banana, raisin, caramel, and molasses on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 9% with only a small warming after the finish. Overall this was a very nice schwarzbier. Nice balance of fruitiness and roasted flavors; with good complexity and smoothness.","superspak","Apr 23, 2012"

Earthy bitter hops mix with a hint of alcohol to counter the malt sweetness. There's a hint of melanoid in there that makes it a little interesting. A bit of a lingering alcohol burn on the finish.

Pitch black body with a tan full thicket of head, I love the name the reference to Space Balls and the quote on the bottle..."May the Schwarz be with you". Fine even lacing left behind very nice look to this beer. Aromatics have some up front dark fruit with hints of toffee and coffee dark chocolate roasted malts. Much like a Baltic Porter a big nine percent black lager. Flavor is a warming roasted dark malt adventure from dark licorice notes with dark chocolate bitterness to hints of fruit (ripened plum hints of raisin). A finishing breeze of herbal hops overshadowed by the bitterness of the dark chocolate nearly burnt roasted dark malts. Mouhfeel is medium to fuller bodied excellent well crafted stuff coming out of the Brew Kettle I can't get over the quality of their beer. Moderated carbonation finishes dry with a nice balance, their beers are wonderful go try some of the Brew Kettle offerings...I can't wait until they bottle White Raja IPA.

Muted aromas with a dry, roasted character makes me beleive that there's not much there. Flavors, on the otherhand, beg to differ. Big, clean roasted notes with a slight touch of fully-attenuated caramel and a hint of lactose. Otherwise, no fruits, fermentation byproducts, phenols, sweetness, or sulfers-- just a crystal clean beer. The body seems higher, but remains chalk-dry with a soft roasted coffee astringency that balanced the beer. Finishes quite the same.
