Not as full as a Brown Ale or a Porter, this showcased the Lager aspects of it while being similar to a Vienna Lager when it came to the hue, body, and range of flavors. This would make for a decent dessert beer as the flavor profile led itself to that. Enjoy this class while lamenting that more examples of this aren't readily available - this style certainly has a lot of untapped potential.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 27, 2014"

APPEARANCE: very dark brown color with ruby highlights. opaque. thin tanned head with below average retention. TASTE: light sweet malty flavour with light roasted notes that linger into the finish. low bitterness. almost absent hop flavours. clean lager profile. PALATE: low body. medium-low carbonation.

Very much like a light German pilsner but with a bit of a doppelbock aspect to it. It refreshing and something you could call sessionable. If I saw it on tap and wanted something light I wouldn't hesitate to order one. I've had a few American examples of the style and they weren't quite as good as this one.","PaulyB83","Jul 21, 2014"

3.73,-4.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a pretty nice example of a Schwarzbier, it had everything that I would expect from a classic German example of the style. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, not too crisp, a little silky, dry finish, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, but after that the lack of carbonation might start to wear on me and I think this would make for a nice late summer and fall time beer. What I like the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it had just about everything that I look for in the style. What I like the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was bad, but it needed a little more carbonation. I might buy this beer again when in the mood for a Schwarzbier and I would recommend it to just about anyone who's a fan of the style. All in all I liked this beer and I was pretty happy with it, it's nice to have a nice canned Schwarzbier that's readily available. This made for a nice first impression of this brewery and I would be interested in trying more of their beers. It's one of the better German made Schwarzbier's I've had. Nice job guys, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Jul 15, 2014"

Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, raisin, fig, toast, molasses, brown bread, light roast, light floral, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity esters. Taste of caramel, raisin, fig, toast, molasses, brown bread, light roast, light pepper, light floral, and earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, toast, molasses, brown bread, light roast, light pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier style. All around nice balance and complexity of flavors with good robustness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 23, 2013"

This beer smelled of stinky cereal when it was first poured, but once it settled, I get some smoky, nutty, and some spiciness to it. For all my apprehensiveness, this beer hits it out of the park. The malty flavor takes over the palate. The hop character is downplayed, but I enjoyed the malty backbone on top of the unmistakable Germain crispness that their lagers tend to have. The body is light, and very lager-like. Overall, I'd definitely drink it again. I'd say this is a perfect Fall beer for all you porter and stout fans. A great buy.","BeerAficionadoMCMXC","May 18, 2013"

I don't know why, but the yeast just isn't doing it for me here, adding too much flavor for a lager, and there is enough sweetness from the malts that it just doesn't crisp up, sort of a weird mix. maybe more hops would fix this problem, but things are just out of balance for me. long funny finish. im sure this is far superior on tap at the source, but in the imported can context, it just doesn't stack up. thin medium body and comfortingly brisk carbonation, but this was a miss for me in many ways.","StonedTrippin","Mar 26, 2013"

The taste is more coffee and roast notes, with the molasses/malt sweetness in the background and just a hint of hop bitterness on the finish, with more roast notes. It's a little thin with almost no carbonation noted, but given the flavors, I think a thicker beer would be overwhelming after a while.

4.48,14.6,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The loud Crack was music to mine ears and the Glug was a pleasant accompaniment. I achieved a finger of dense, foamy, mocha-brown head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with mahogany highlights at the edges. The visual is why one should always deCANt from the CAN into a glass. I had to hold it to the light to get the full effect. Nose was filled with grassy hops, just like in the Bros.' description on this site. I was ready to swoon. I CAN honestly say that I had no appreciation for lagers until I embarked on The CANQuest (TM) and found out that not all lagers are created equal. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness, but not quite achieving it. The taste married the grassiness of the hops with the bitterness of anise and molasses, undoubtedly from the malt. Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. The low ABV makes it a good CANdidate for the cooler and I would recommend it to those who say, ""I don't like dark beers."" Sheesh. Get off of your high Lovibond horse and join the party!","woodychandler","Oct 14, 2012"

It was rich and creamy at first, but the more you drank, it got smoother and smoother. A very easy beer to drink. Tons of flavor, and at under 5% abv, it's a beer that you can enjoy for a session.

There are a generous amount of mahogany highlights, and about a finger of khaki colored highlights. Head retention is brief, and there's not realy any lacing to speak of. The nose is lightly roasty, with a suggestion of milk chocolate. There's also an earthy quality there. The flavor takes that roasty, chocolaty base and adds a subtle nuttiness as a second background note along with the earthiness. The body is pleasantly full for a relatively low alcohol beer. The carbonation starts off fairly bubbly, but mostly dies off by mid palate. Schwarzbier isn't a style I find myself ordering all too often, but Kostritzer's renditionof it is fairly enjoyable.","axeman9182","Dec 05, 2011"

Taste is mildly roasty malts with a clean streak, moving to breadiness and some coffee, finishing slightly sweet on cocoa and dark fruits like raisins.

The taste is a little course which was nice to allow the flavors to come out. A nice malty start with some mild coffee and burnt grains and the finish was a decent hop balance that was left in the after taste.

Soft malts and toffee scents stiffen from the pumpernickel, rye bread element, raisin, date and fresher cherry scents blend in nicely and are sweetened by cinnamon spice, only the slightest roasted qualities and with minimal hops presence. Medium-bodied, fine carbonation dances across the palate and keeps things lively. Coffee roast tightens up the malts, dark chocolate powder and focuses the clove, cinnamon spice as well.

Some chocolate aromas and a slight alcoholic aroma which is surprising based on the %4.8 ABV. The flavors are nice roasted malts, slight nuttiness, Slight bitterness at the back end. I do have a few knocks against this brew, first it seems a little watery and second it seems to be missing something as the flavor starts nice then breaks to a hollowness where it almost feels that something is missing though I can't figure out what. The alcohol aroma does not translate to the flavor at all. The aroma was much better than the flavor.

Can smell bread and roasted malt. Smell def. leans towards a lager. Can taste nice bitter hops hidden behind a front of roasted malt and creamy coffee taste.

Sweet malts like cocoa, toffee and bread mix with roasted and coffee malts for a balanced beer that has both sweet and dry spots. It gets smooother as it warms and also finishes a little dryer w/ a more pronounced alcohol burn as time passes also. Didn't really notice much hops at all.

I've tried the bottled version a few times but had my first draught experience recently in Berlin (in a Vietnamese restaurant of all places!) and was very impressed. It's pitch black, much darker than a dunkel, and even though it wasn't nitro-tapped it had a remarkably thick and creamy head. It left serious lacing and the taste is just great - a nice roasted chocolate-malt sweetness but not at all syrupy.

The mouthfeel has a creamy character to it, but it is not heavy by any means and makes a great session beer. Recommended.","biggmike","Jan 31, 2009"

Strong caramel and cocoa notes in the flavour, which is refreshingly light, and has a pleasing bitterness at the edges. The body is on the light side, and carbonation is medium. This would make a good session beer, as no one flavour overwhelms, and the lightness of the body sits well. I could definitely have a few more of these!","bobsy","Aug 11, 2008"

3.95,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Served out of a tall can which reads ""Germany's #1 Black lager beer"" and ""seit (since) 1543"". I'm skeptical: how many beers claim to be #1 or the oldest? Don't be intimidated by the jet-black appearance because this is very drinkable. Pours with a half inch of head which mostly dissipates. Smells a hint of spices and something sweet. Tastes great: hints of caramel, coffee, malty, with a bite in the aftertaste. Tastes dry the more you sip. Good lacing. Perfect level of carbonation. This is very refreshing. Great for a hot day. I would consider this a ""session beer"". I'm glad I picked up a case. You can knock these back like an American lager but they taste so much better.","tubaguy","Aug 04, 2008"

Taste is amazing as well. Some toasted grain, chocolate (dark and bitter), a bit of grass/straw and a slight bitterness, very slight, on the back of the tounge. High carbonation leads to a very thin, crisp mouthfeel. Overall a very good beer, I dont think I really have a complaint about it.","bunnyhustle","Jul 09, 2008"

Light bodied beer, with more burnt than roasty malt tastes, and a very quick finish and thin taste. Watery overall, with a slight bit too much carbonation for a darker beer, I thought. At times tasted lightly of biting on foil, and a bit metallic. On the palate it was such that I couldnt seem to taste this with my whole tongue, but it seemed to only strike flavor sharply on the sides of my tongue.

Smells very sweet with roasted malts. A roasted malt flavor with some honey sweetness as well with just a touch of hop bitterness.

Taste is pretty simple, a dark bread with a little caramel that's never sweet or cloying. Bitterness is minimal. Carbonation is very fine, probably due to the unique dispenser.

It's not as heavy as a stout or porter in the roasted flavors and malts, but it has a nice subtlety to it and I really like the toasty malt flavor in it.

Had a couple fingers of brownish head that settled to thin foam with little lacing. The smell was weak roasted malt and hint of chocolate. I tend to find most in this style have weak smells so fits average. The taste was nice and light. Being so dark you think of a stout or a porter and expect a heavy taste but this goes down like a lighter beer. I've really gotten to like this style in the past year and find them to be good session beers or good when you want something darker but not in the stout or porter vein.

Bready aroma with hints of sweet malts underneath. What I will call the ""brown bread crust"" aspect of the aroma is gorgeous. On the palate, doughy right off the bat and very dry. Roasted malts come out to play next, displaying pronounced malt bitterness. No sweetness comes out in this beer at all. The finish is bone dry and very long. Mouthfeel is huge for such a low gravity beer, thanks mainly to the effervescence of the carbonation. This is one excellent schwarzbier.

The start is sharp put then the palate fills with a smooth mild roasty sweetness balanced with an understated hop dryness that prevents any cloying effecthints of charred rye bread, dry but not overly sothe hops come in the dry roasty finish.

3.63,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark ruby brown in hue, it is almost black but not quite. When held to a light the ruby influences are more discernable. Still, it is too dark to see any effervesces. The head was beige in color, almost two fingers in height before slowly fading to a half finger cap that sat there, very sturdy. Very good head retention. Subsequent lacing was clumpy in spots but naked in others. Excellent appearance. The nose is very soft but articulate. Faint notes of licorice, milk chocolate, toasted sugar, earthy espresso and just a kiss of char. The potency is low; even though I have to sniff hard I like what I smell in the bouquet. It is well organized. Overall the aromas are very pleasant in a soft, gracefully kind of way. Nice. The palate is not as thoughtful as the nose indicated. Still there is good flavor here, dry, roasted malts with not much sweetness, not much caramel (but there is some). Vague earthiness. Espresso. Cocoa. Hints of licorice. The palate isnt as put-together as Id like, there isnt anything wrong with it. Hell, it is quite good really but it seems to be missing something. Maybe Im looking for just a little more assertiveness maybe this is as loud as I can expect from a Schwarzbier. Tasty. Medium-light in body, its a tickle too thin, the carbonation is a bit low and the mouthfeel comes across too slick. The mouthfeel isnt an issue but it could be improved, IMO. Very drinkable, this beer is a lovely quaff especially when the modest abv is factored in. Id certainly drink a few at a bar if I want to keep the alcohol intake low. I think this beer is available in Omaha but I purchased this bottle in West Des Moines. I should have tried this beer sooner but I guess Im just a moron. Oh well. Good stuff.

There are tonnes of bubbles emerging from the blackness, its very interesting to look at. The taste is of roasted malts, rye or pumpernickel bread, chocolate malts and very subdued hops.

Some deep ruby tints when the glass is held to the light. Only a fine edge layer of tan head is left when the pint arrives. Aroma is mild but roasted malt and faint smoky scents are present. First sip reveals a slightly bitey carbonation that is more than I expected and a thicker than average body. Flavor is malt and malt with some roasted hints and also a mild coffee hit. Finish is some toffee and a little grainy. Overall a tasty brew but the finish is a little lighter than I would have thought.","sulldaddy","Apr 24, 2004"

The smell is very enjoyable. Dark, almost roasted malts, woody. Some refreshing winy grapes aspects. Some chestnut maybe. The mouthfeel is great and full, no bitterness, a floral hoppiness.

Taste backs up that sweetness. Very sweet malty taste, this would definately be a dessert beer for me. Mouthfeel is very light and thin for me.

A tan head, about 1 and a half fingers to start, leaves patchy rings of lace down the glass. Smell is a mixture of dark bread and malty notes.

Firstly, it was very fresh - it had a pleasant surprising on-tap taste. Second, I fortunately drank it out of a suitable beer mug displaying its pretty dark brown colour. It's very creamy initial pour settled in a moment. Very pleasant with understated roasted malt and hint of coffee. Stands by itself and certainly works with food. Had it on tap in May 2005, didn't stand up as good, maybe the way they had it on at Ludwig's.","Sammy","Jan 22, 2004"

Wonderful coffee and ruby hues, fantastic light brown head that takes a long time to settle. Smell is crisp, perhaps a hint of Saaz hops. Toasted and roasted malts are very distant in the background. The taste is very smooth. Bready malt character is supplanted by a very light hop bite, and then a faint hint of roasted malt in the finish. Hints of chocolate, perhaps a bit of nuttiness? Mouthfeel is light and balanced, carbonation is very prickly on the tip of the tongue. Drinkability is very good, but I really wish it had a bit more toasted malt character to it.

Fairly generous initial, cocoa colored head-marginal lace. Nice medium roast malt-not too much mind you. Just right for the season. Very much like an infant doppelbock with mild chocolate, raisin and some nuttiness evident. A little too carbonated for my taste though. Finishes with cleansing bitter.

Good, strong medium and bold body, smooth, but dry feel. some of the notes can be a bit perplexing. The fruit note is like a dry raisin of fig.

Becomes richer as it warms and smoother too, but with increasing bitterness. Medium mouthfeel with lower carbonation that helps add to the pleasure. Very good overall beer. A beer that's good for starters and experienced drinkers.","garymuchow","Feb 19, 2003"
3.39,-13.3,4.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer poured deep, deep black from the bottle and had an abundanct brown head. Its apperance was the best thing about this beer. The aroma was subtle at best and even though it had a great head, I did not notice much in my nose. The taste was good and favored the malt. I did not taste any hops. The mouthfeel was medium and had a very slight amount of carbonation on the tongue. This was an exceptable beer but I would recommend this only as an introduction to a schwarzbier and not to an experieced drinker.","LarryKemp","Feb 19, 2003"
3.93,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall a pretty good brew. Pours a solid black with fair head. Malt flavor dominates without overpowering. I was surprised at how thin it was even compared to others of the style. Faint chocolate, but nothing really stands out. Good beer in large quantities, you won't get tired or burnt out on. Not the best of type, but worth a try.","Sixpack595","Jan 25, 2003"
3.63,-7.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The appearance of this brew would make any stout proud. Pours almost completely black, with the tidbits of light that get through displaying dark ruby highlights. A substantial beige head that breaks down relatively quickly, leaving clingly lace. Smell has a creamy grain texture reminiscent of Guinness with some hops detectable as well. A pleasant but rather weak nose. Smooth and somewhat sweet at the onset with a taste of somewhat bitter chocolate. Crisp middle transitions to finish characterized by dryness at the back of the tongue and a little twang that seemed even a bit metallic. Chocolate notes linger. Seemed somewhat watery, though that certainly did not hurt the fine mouthfeel. Quite drinkable as well, though rather uninspiring.","BitteBier","Jan 24, 2003"
3.73,-4.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a light black colour topped by a thick head that settles down rather easily. Aroma and flavour are malty with hints of roasted coffee. To be honest i expected mouthfeel to be heavier, due to the dark looks of the beer. Average drinkability. Last word: I was a bit dissapointed by this German beer. Still good but i expected it much much better","ipogios","Jan 15, 2003"
3.56,-9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours black ruby in color with a thick and rocky tan colored head that eventually dissipates into a creamy and sticky lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts and grains. Taste is dark coffee and bitter chocolate. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy but is a bit thin. A nice Schwarzbier, but nothing special.","Morris729","Jan 15, 2003"
3.68,-5.9,4.5,4,3,3.5,4.5,"I've been trying a lot of great, strong tasting beers this past couple of weeks, so my judgement may be a little skewed on this one. Poured about as nice looking a glass of beer as you will see. Jet black (are there really any black jets?), large head which lasts, with some lace throughout. From there however, nothing extraordinary. Certainly smooth and quite drinkable, but not really much of a flavor profile. Not overly hoppy or malty, just kind of clean and smooth. I will try it again some other time, but a little plain for my tastes.","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 05, 2003"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep amber brown... almost black, with a thin head.  Aroma of sweet and roasted malt.  Flavors are malt sweetness upfront, with some very mild coffee-like notes, as well as flavors of pumpernickle bread, and a touch of hop bitterness to round out the flavor nicely.  Thin to medium body, with a slightly rough mouthfeel.  This is a very easy drinking bier.  Prosit!","zerk","Nov 11, 2002"

4.21,7.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this at ""Conmux"" in East Berlin, but also throughout Berlin at various bars and cafes. It's without a doubt one of the more popular Schwarzbiers available in Berlin, and one of the most tasty. It was so nice to see this hard to find and underrated style. Highly drinkable. Highly recommened.","Todd","Oct 18, 2002"
3.78,-3.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Almost opaque black, a little brown light transmission at the bottom.  Good 1/2 inch tan head that rises on a hard pour.  Sweet malted milk aroma.  Caramel and slight nutty flavors, approaches a chocolate milk in mouthfeel -- less than medium-bodied but low carbonation gives a nice impression.  Little sense of hops and a slight fade to wateriness at the finish.  All-in-all, very drinkable and completely pleasant.  Maybe my tongue wanted to be challenged just a little more.","ADR","Oct 07, 2002"
4.21,7.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The dark ruby/near black color and huge caramel head are very inviting.  The smell is malt and bread crumbs, but faint.  The taste is slight roasted, big malt and slight toffee with a faint hops presence to balance.  The mouthfeel is very smooth, but a bit thin.  Since this is my favorite, it is hard for me to stay impartial, but this is very drinkable.  I had to save this for my mug club entry and I revisit it every chance I get.","ryanocerus","Oct 06, 2002"
3.66,-6.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a very dark almost black laced with garnet on the edges with a tan 2 finger head.  The smell is that of sweet malt and a bread-like aroma.  Very smooth flavor that reveals a light roasted malt and a very slight bit of maybe coffee.  The very thin mouthfeel is finished off with a semi-dry taste with still a clean, thin finish.  Very lightly hopped and pretty smooth overall.  A pretty good non-offensive beer to perhaps turn someone on to dark beers without shocking the taste buds.  Prosit!","BeerAngel","Oct 05, 2002"
3.81,-2.6,4.5,3.5,4,3,4,"""Das Schwarze mit der blonden Seele."" Fairly weak but decent aroma, smells like German Schwarzbrot. Roasted malt flavour with coffee and burnt toast. A bit watery mouthfeel (is that what the brewers describe as the ""blonde soul""?) By all means, this is a very drinkable Schwarzbier, but the style unfortunately seems to lack the rich velvety mouthfeel of a stout or a Baltic porter.","Sigmund","Sep 20, 2002"
3.88,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A nice clean lager. Ample flavor with roasted malty taste along with a mild bitterness, but, not over powering. This is in line of a German Lager. Nice black color and a little of the thick side when pouring. Pleasant drink even on a hot day or just sitting around shooting the bull!","BeerManDan","Sep 07, 2002"
4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer was good, clean fun.  Looks good in glass, black with ruby edges, rocky tan head, nice lacing.  I liked the interplay of slightly roasted malts, noble hops, and a clean lagered feeling.  Classic example of style.","pbrian","Aug 28, 2002"
3.91,0,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Good beer. Dry, roasty and ""lagery"". Dry finish. Ruby color and nice permanent head. Some ""lace"". Smells of typical German lager. Signature German dry finish. A very good beer. May the ""Schwarz"" be with you! American brewers often can't replicate this style very well. Having a Köstritzer is the way to go.","EagleTalon","Aug 23, 2002"
3.91,0,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Rocky tan head that lingers and laces down glass topping pure nearly-black color -- looks great in glass; aroma mild with hints of coffee in background, hop aroma not noticeable at first.  taste: mild...biscuity flavors perched on top chocolate followed by mild hop bitterness; full-bodied but without cloying maltiness.  Very good beer.  I imagine it would be a fantastic with a steak or roast beef!","brakspear","Jul 23, 2002"
4.23,8.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: I like this beer a lot, not just because this is one of my favourite style but because it keeps it real with flavours that are a bit complex yet not to the point of taking away from actually putting one down if not a few. A damn good pick for the style.","Jason","Jul 19, 2002"
3,-23.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Dark brown and only slight transparent with a white head.  Despite the inability to see through it, high carbonation was evident on the sides of the glass.  Overall I found the beer to be quite watery and the flavor profile pretty, for lack of a better word, blah.","jreitman","Jul 16, 2002"
4.15,6.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Another good Schwarzbier.  Another nearly-black colorur and enourmous, tan, foamy head, but does not maintain as well as others (but still great).  Pleasant, not-overly sweet, toffee sent, big and black malt.   Great sweet-malt, but not as roasted as others.  Not bitter, but balanced.  Lighter body than other Schwarzbeirs, but still smooth.  Another great Schwarzbier, but a slighty watery import.  Definately drink and enjoy, experience the Schwarzbiers.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jul 11, 2002"
3.8,-2.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is an easy drinkin' black lager. Light lager body and clean flavor. Light bitterness and roasty malt flavor that lingers slightly. Could have used a little more dark raosted flavor to puss it into the 4.0 range but it looked and smelled good. All and all a good Schwarz.","mattmaples","Jun 26, 2002"
4.36,11.5,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a most excellent dark bronze color, with an appealing ruby tint and a nice almost beige head. There are faint malt aromas on the nose. The flavors consisted of malt, toasted dark bread, grains, lightly hopped, herbsall balanced well for a moderately sweet / clean taste on the palate.  Mouth feel and body  are slightly thin/watery but smooth. Overall a  very enjoyable black lager.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 02, 2002"
3.75,-4.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Thick tan creamy head.  Black with ruby hints.  Sweet complex alcohol nose.  Blackberry currant.  Initially sweet then smoky, chocolatey and coffee like.  At once dark and creamy.","Andy","May 30, 2002"
3.6,-7.9,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Mild darkly roasted grain notes in aroma along w/ rich dark Munich malt as well.  Deep garnet clear hue and topped by a beautiful thick & dense tan head.  Contrary to the appearance, roasted grain flavors are clean and light. Grassy Hersbrucker hop flavor.  Hop bitterness does a good balance of balancing the residual sweetness and the beer is thus balanced all around. Finishes dry w/ pleasant roasty notes on the back of the tongue.  Quite flavorful and very drinkable.  Keep in mind I've been drinking Utah beer for the past couple days.","marc77","May 23, 2002"
2.63,-32.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,2,"Even though this is a ""black beer", the beer isn't black.  Rather dark ruby.  A full rocky beige head.  Some slight caramel tones and milk chocolate on the nose.  There's a soapy taste in this beer.  It has a light to medium body.  I perceive some bitterness, albeit not a pleasurable one.  There are some very slight roasted and chocolate tones.  Very uniteresting beer.  Compared to one of the only other Schwarzbiers I've had, Sprecher Black Bavarian, this beer is not even in the same universe.","Bighuge","May 16, 2002"
3.06,-21.7,4,3,3,3,3,"Slight burnt malt and caramel flavor.  Had to deduct points for it has a slight metallic ring on my palate. (this is a no-no)  Sweet on the nose.  A mellow and enjoyable drink.","Jordan","Nov 16, 2001"
