"Overall: I'm not too familiar with this style (Schwarzbier), however this beer seems to fit for the most part. Pretty refreshing and not completely flavorless. Opposed to the season suggestions for this style (winter), I think this beer goes great on a warm early summer night."

"Mouth: Carbonation light for a lager which really allows the creaminess of the malts to bloom on your tongue. Light bodied considering its strong malt presence."

"An enjoyable and approachable schwarzbier, the roasted character doing well to branch out, spread itself around. My experience thus far with this style has unfortunately mostly been with thin, overly lagery versions, so this is a nice surprise - fuller, but still a lager, the smoky essences not totally overriding that."

"Pours opaque black with minimal head. The aroma has a nice deep and dry roasted barley note followed up by notes of pumpernickel and dry lager yeast. Taste starts with a neutral malt flavor and quickly becomes intensely roasty. The roasted notes bring on smokey flavors towards the end. Finish is clean and dry. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a light to medium body. Overall, lots of flavor packed into this, but it was a bit one note. Would have nice to have a little more depth to all of the roast."

"Overall - maybe I'm not a huge fan of the style, but other than easy drinking just an ok beer."

"The Crack was followed closely by an inverted Glug which produced two fingers of thick, deep-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing light penetration only near the top of the glass. It was as deeply dark as Rader's heart must have been to commit such atrocities. Nose was rich with a smoky chocolate scent, like a liquid dark chocolate bar. Mouthfeel was medium and the chocolate taste even more pronounced on the tongue than it had been on the nose! Understated hops? More like unspoken. This was very sweet, especially on the finish and between that and its > 4% ABV, I would not find it ""sessionable"". Hey, that was their claim, not mine. Stylistically, I have no problem with it, but the style is just not my cuppa meat, dig?"

"Where Wynkoop's Schwarzbier favors boldness and ale-like roughness, its a bit more assertive for the classic taste and texture of Schwarz. But its taste is firm and favorable throughout and is sure to appease the fans of dark lagers throughout."

"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cola like color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of coffee. Taste is a much stronger coffee, some malts, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

"Overall Wynkoop's created a great session beer. It's light, slick, flavorful and refreshing. The biggest problem I see is that I really had to search for any substances in the first swig. Though all of the characteristics of something great are here, they're so subtle that the beer might teeter on the edge of blandness."

"A decent beer that I found mildly enjoyable on a crisp fall morning."

"A great Schwarzbier IMO. Full of malty goodness. Well done and something I would highly recommend."

"It might be worth mentioning that in my experience bottled/canned beers with smoked malts tend to have that come on a bit stronger than a draft version. On tap I'd say that the smokiness in B3K is barely perceptible."

"poured into a chilled pint glass down at the pearl street grill. black with very little head, almost watery looking for a darker brew. nose is dark roasted malts, sharp hints of licorice in there as well. taste is slightly bland, coffee notes with the almost burned malt flavor. very low carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bti strange. i havent entirely figured this beer out yet, but i have never had more than one in a sitting. something is a little off here"
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, sweet malt, and slight oatmeal. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight earthy malt, roasted malt, slight coffee, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, decent appearance, good body, and good feel."
"Good schwarzbier. Poured brownish-black with a moderate tan head. Dark roasted malts in the nose, caramel and dark chocolate. Similar taste, with big roasty malts, licorice, and some cocoa bitterness. Smooth and silky, not quite full-bodied, and very drinkable."
"Pours an almost opaque dark brown color with a 1/2 inch beige head that fades to a thin cap. Random legs of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells malt/biscuit, some fruitiness, and a slightly smoky aroma. Taste is exactly like the smell. This beer has a high level of carbonation which makes for a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and the first of the style I have ever had. My first beer from Wynkoop."
"Nice dark lager, not opaque but certainly quite dark. Not too much lasting head. Dark brown amber highlights to light. Smell is clean, dark malts, coffee notes, hint of spice, like caraway or cinnamon. Taste is of smokey charcoal, slightly sweet dark malts, some balancing hops. Clean finish. Thin in tastes, a little metallic. Not great, but certainly drinkable."
"On tap at gaetano's, I've also had this at the Wynkoop so I didn't hesitate to order it. Dark black color, smells a little grainy. Tastes fine and reminds me of full sail dark black lager. This is a pretty good beer although I wish the smell was more robust."
"D: A nice example of this style. The lightness makes this an easy drinker."
"Drinkability is OK, I didn't love it, but warmed up to it somewhat after an off-putting first sip."
"The beer feeling light, which is what was expected from the style, and it was smooth and easy to drink with a good carbonation feel to it. The beer finished with a dry aftertaste. Overall, not bad beer but not a great one either."
"Would have again, but not my first pick at Wynkoop."
"This falls somewhere between a pilsner and a porter, if that makes any sense. Somewhat similar to 1554 but with a more assertive spicy hop character."
"Dark brown color. Small head. Moderate carbonation. Minimal aroma, slightly roasty, not much else. Fairly sweet, caramel to start. Some coffee roasty flavors, chocolate through the middle. Finish is lightly roasty. Easy to drink, good mouthfeel. Ethanol light."
"Drinkability: Had only read about these beers so I was surprised at its drinkability."
"The body is light but leaves a sweet finish. Sweet but still feels full attenuated. Hard to explain I guess. Some silkiness and a very light carbonation. Overall a good beer but not a schwartz."
"Not really recommended."
"D- This beer has nice big malt flavors with some fruity ale qualities but it still has a very smooth quality to it. Nice session beer."
"Malt aromas, some roasted grain smell, but not the smokiness I was expecting. Flavor was malty, somewhat complex, but not overly powerful. No real hop taste or finish in this one. Thin mouthfeel kept it light and quite drinkable. Good, but not great."
"Has a porterish roast coffe aroma with mild stewed raisin notes that are more baltic porter than Schwarz....but hey maybe that suggests it is actually a lager. Red tinted black body with a pinky thin tan head. Light roasty flavor in the fore. Amazingly narrow flavor range and not much real taste concentration or or presence ont he tongue...a watery weak porter really. Shameful."
"Flavor makes this super drinkable, a really nice schwartz!"
"Ordered this on-tap at the Wynkoop Brewery in downtown Denver. Poured a dark black (hence the schwarz = German for ""black"") color. Nearly opaque. Little off-white head to it. Not a complex flavor or aroma - mostly hops in there. Flavors of hops linger just a bit, then fade. Light carbonation, good for sipping. Amongst the beers I tried at Wynkoop, this one wasn't exceptional, although it wasn't bad by any means. I would definitely try another pint of it."
"Complex malts with a light mouthfeel made this one appear quite drinkable."
"Light to medium bodied, very smooth with good drinkability."
"This is a smooth beer with lots of chocolate. It's tasty and easily consumed."
