"A very good Schwarzbier."

"O:  Very impressive with a lot of complexity and flavor without being a heavy hitting beer.  Definitely a pleasure to drink."

"O: this bottle may very well have been a bit old, but the beer was still quite drinkable... downed it relatively swiftly... would love to try this fresher or on tap"

"It's been years since I've had something from Einbecker, so I'm interested to see how my feelings have evolved. This stuff pours a clear smoky topaz topped by a finger of charred cream foam. The nose comprises mild roast, light toast, and a touch of cashew. The taste intensifies the roast a bit and replaces the cashew with a bit of rubber. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an odd little schwarz, really. The rubber character is pretty off-putting, but the rest seems to finish rather cleanly. I have no idea how old this bottle isw, so perhaps age has had an effect, but it seems fresh enough, just lackluster."

"Nice beer for the style."

"This is one of the nice dunkel German beers. I enjoy one of these after a hot day of riding steam trains. This beer on has a bit too much bitterness for me. It has a nice balance of hops to dark malt something that is not easily accomplished. If served cold it has a wonderful head and one of the nicest aromas of the dunkel beers."
"Interesting and one of the better German brewed Dunkels I've had so far."
""
"This Schwarzbier is a dark-red color, transparent, with a slightly tanned neck. The aroma emanates caramelly malt tones with vigor, with noble hopes in the background. The taste displays medium carbonation, the same caramel, and coffee tones. The sensation is very refreshing, and very soft, and the taste is super fast - the beer slides fast in the palate. The aftertaste is malty and shows noble hops. Definitely a good pick for the end of Winter."
""
"Whatever style it is, it's another awesome brew from Einbecker."
""
""
""
"Einbecker, I won't buy another one of your beers until I see it in a brown bottle."
""
""
""
"I don't think I'll seek this out again."
""
"Beer is medium bodied with low to medium-low levels of carbonation. Resulting mouthfeel is smooth, not creamy or fizzy. Closes out dry, with little stickiness across the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted/toasted malt and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same but slightly watery. There is a very mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice smell but the flavors are pretty thin in my opinion."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and enjoyable. With the lower ABV and not too intense flavor, this beer is easily sessionable and definitely one that I would try again."
""
"RJT"
""
"Pours a nice clear Coca-Cola brown with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled and rather persistent pale tan head. Strong, malty aroma has an overtone of pear and is on the sweet side. Flavor has a malty core and tones of caramel, licorice and fruit and a hint of grass. Smooth texture has a decent amount of fizz and about average body. Overall, not outstanding but definitely worth a try."
""
"DRINKABILITY: Definitely repeatable, easy to drink and a good, but not great, schwarzbier. It's just a little too sweet for my taste, but that's a minor point. It provides a good price to value profile and I'd buy it again, particularly for a long night of beer and conversation with friends."
""
""
""
""
"Feels like liquid bread crust, not crunchy or rough, just firm and a medium to low dryness. Light carbonation."
"Overall more of a bock rather than a Schwartz this beer is boring and forgettable."
"Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character. Still not my favorite, but not too bad afterall!"
""

""
""
"O - I couldn't drink this all day long and wish Adjunct Macro Lagers were of the same calibre. I also appreciate the opportunity to have tried this beer. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere."
""
""
"D: Super high drinkability. Quite refreshing, could drink this one all day long."
""
"Pale and fruity for a Schwartz - more properly called a Dunkel. Light, smooth, lots of Vienna. Just enough going on, but drinkable over challenging."
"Not what i was expecting from a schwarzbier but a good one though."
"O-Very drinkable, an interesting style since it has quite a bit of aroma but a much more faint taste."
"The body is fairly light, with plenty of carbonation to go around. The drinkability is pretty solid, even it does drink like something at a higher ABV. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It's a good, flavorful schwarzbier."
"Overall: More of a dunkel than a schwarz, this one is a bit watery and insipid; perhaps it was a bit old as other BAs have reported a hoppier profile than what I tasted"
"This is one of the best schwarzbiers that I have had. I would highly recommend this beer."
"O - A good choice for a dunkel. This beer isn't what i expected from a schwarzbier but it is still a great choice if you like darker beers with the drinkability and body of a session beer."
"Drinkability: A thumb's up. Though I like my dark beers thick and creamy, the light mouthfeel of this beer does not take away from the bolder (""darker"") flavors."
"D- A good brew, very easy to drink at the sessionable ABV and the light body makes it even more so"
"D: very refreshing and enjoyable with little to no alcohol taste present"
"D: Do not drink this beer cold, room temperature only, recommended for all."
"Pours a dark brown color with medium, fizzy head. Aroma is caramel and cereal malts. Taste is heavy on the roast grains with a hint of chocolate and nuts. Flavors then move into a slight grassy hops into the finishing. The beer is pretty light-bodied for a Dunkel, almost watery. Not terribly remarkable but a decent speciman."
"O: A pleasant, fruity Schwartzbier, with interersting smoky overtones"
"Note; it might be better to call this a Dunkel, under that sort, I would say it's the best in the world."
"Tastes like slightly over-toasted bread. There's a mild grainy bitterness, a touch of sweetness and raisin. The body is appropriately light, but not as thin as something like Kostritzer. Finishes with a mild bitter bite. Enjoyable stuff, not particularly outstanding, but good."
"Drink well my friends"
"almost crisp-bodied with sensible nutty malt flavor. plenty of hops all around, though. you'd think a black beer would be less hop forward, but they're very significant. spicy flavor from them, with a spicy and floral aroma. more bready in the flavoring. bitterness is mild though not entirely absent. just...mild. it could probably stand augmentation, but hardly necessary"
"Yum. This is a pretty good beer. It finishes moderately dry, its light in body and has minimal carbonation on the palate. The dry finish reveals a slight bitterness from grains and the forward is all plisen sweetness. Its appropriately restrained and not overbearing, really drinkable. I like Einbecker."
"D: An ok beer, but definitely not my favorite representation of the style."
"Pretty meh beer, i found most the flavors pretty lacking and the mouthfeel was pretty bad. Too bad."
"The appearance is brown with a small head. The aroma is faint with toasted caramel malt, chocolate, and a touch brown sugar. The taste is like the aroma but it's not as good. It's more acidic and astringent. The palate is thin but decently carbonated. The beer isn't that great overall but it's OK to drink."
"It's one I'd have again, but it's not one I'd search out. it would depend on what's available."
"Drinkability is good. Not overly impressed, but nothing offensive enough to detract from the drinkability."
"Cola colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is butterscotch.Taste is butterscotch,caramel and a hint of cocoa.Flavorful and refreshing goes down nicely.I would definetly recommend and I can see myself buying this again in the near future.Good job by Einbecker Brauhaus!"
"D: I thought it was a lot more drinkable when i started on the glass. It was colder then, so, yeah, very drinkable at temp."
"Drink: Easy to drink, very light. Great smell, but the taste was a little lacking for me."
"Overall, a decent schwarz, but a little bit too mild, IMO. It is nice to see this end of the spectrum though, less roasty and more lagery. A decent session beer, and one i wouldn't mind drinking again."
"D: Drinkable. One of the better Schwarzbiers I've tried."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is medium. Drinkability is good, probably the best quality of the beer. Pretty solid beer."
"Like all Schwartzbiers and Dunkels, it is at the height of beer drinkability but I would take a Koestritzer over this."
"D â€“ The ultimate in chug-ability."
"I really like this one, aside from the name not quite being true. This one pours to a dark amber brown color with a thick foamy head about 1/3 of an inch. Aroma is of coffee and chocolate. And it has a sweet character. There is a bit of barley, malt character. It has a smooth clean finish."
"Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a small tight egg-shell colored head which settles into a light cap. Quite light for a ""black beer"". The aroma is of a light roasted munich malt, quite doughy and sweet. Some grassy peppery notes as well. The taste has a nice but very light roasted quality which rides shotgun to a big munich malt presence. Big doughy flavor with some caramel, raisin, and grassy/peppery notes. Tastes more like a dunkel than schwarzbier. Moderate feel with tingly carbonation, lightly sweet. It may not be the best tasting schwarzbier out there but it has good flavors and is very easy to drink. The low abv is nice. More of a dunkel but a good dunkel."
"D: This is a an average representation of the style and goes down easily."
"11.2oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in a pilsener glass. Poured a translucent mahogany with a rocky, two inch, tan-colored head that settled into a half inch cap. Thick clumps of lacing were exposed during the session. Nose was chocolate, lager yeast, a bit of skunk, and some citrus notes in the mix. Taste reveals some acidity that hits upfront, followed by toffee and cocoa, combined with some euro lager skunk. Mouthfeel was light/medium with a subtle background carbonation. Decent, but not my favorite Schwarzbier. I'm not sure if this brew might have been past its prime."
"Interestingly, I think this smells similarly to an American Amber--more malty (with light crystal malt) than bitter. It doesn't seem like a dunkel to me. The flavor does revert to style with stronger darker malts coming through on the tongue. It also has the warming characteristics of a much higher alcohol beer. The body is light as expected. The aftertaste is bland but well-balanced."
"The taste is quite clean, some roasted caramel malts, a tiny bit of hop to balance out the deep roasts, there is a touch of some chocolate in the beer. There might be a slightly nutty slightly fruity quality in there underneath. The beer is just right in its consistency, not too creamy, not too prickly. The toffee and caramel flavors are quite nice. This is a fairly light bodied beer once it settles in, easy to drink, very enjoyable. L'Chaim."
"Overall, a number of things in this one check and balance drinkability. Lighter body makes this one go down easy. Lighter flavors make it a quicker drink, but not necessarily a better one. And I was lucky enough to find an orphan bottle (a single outside of the six -- they sell singles at this store, but I won't break the cardboard encapsulated style apart to get one -- just not cool in my opinion -- but luckily someone else did). But a $15.99 a six-pack, I doubt I'd be reaching for 2-3 of these anytime soon. Better reps of the style out there. This is not horrible, but just ok. Still worth a try."
"D - I think it's a little too subdued to be called a schwarzbier, though it is easily drinkable."
"cheers!"
"The drink is medium-bodied and lightly carbonated with superb silkiness and good drinkability."
"Pours a dark brown with almost no head--just an off-white ring. No lacing. Smell is smokey with toasted malts & caramel. Taste is bitter, some toasted malt & molasses. Mouthfeel is carbonated, acidic. This is not think, and it's actually kind of watery. Kind of an odd combination of smoke flavor with the caramel notes."
"Pours a clear, deep amber color. Good 1 inch head of an slightly off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of malts and slightly of lager. Seems to fit the style. Average carbonation, crisp, and slightly chewy. The bitterness of the hops is present on the tongue, but not strongly in flavor. Mostly a good malt flavor along with some lager background. Slightly sweet, but that lessens the more you drink. Overall, a good bodied beer with an easy drinkability - worth a try."
"(rated Aug 1, 2007)"
"This beer poured a deep dark brown with a single-finger head. The smell is filled with candy-like malt with some caramel and toffee. The taste starts off with a little hit of hops that gives way to some roasted caramel-tasting malt with a hint of nuttiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is slick and slightly thick without a ton of carbonation. A very tasty beer that is also fairly a drinkable, a great choice that everyone who's interested in the style should try."
"I know some folks have dismissed this beer & schwarzbiers in general, but I love'm! Einbecker is no exception. I picked up a six-pack with a couple porters & had a fine and tasty night (the pork chop dinner certainly helped!). The 11.2 oz bottle poured an amber-honey color at first with a nice beige head and lotsa lacy-ness. A smoky honey and malt aroma and taste with a mild, silky feel to it. Give me more!"
"D: The beer drinks very smooth, has a very good grain bill per style as well bitterness and perhaps one of the better schwarzbiers I have probably ever tasted. A dark roasted bitter-sweet treat definitely worth seeking out."
" This is a fine session beer, with the ABV% being at 4.90%. I could down a few of these at one sitting, but seeing how plain-jane this is, I doubt that's gonna happen anytime soon. A good bock or dopplebock would be a better warm weather choice than this, and if ya want a dark beer, just go all out and get a Rogue or Stone bomber. This is worth a shot once, if for no other reason to say that you've had a German Schwarzbier."
"Draught: This one poured an extremely dark, copper color. It seemed fairly clear, and only had a very small tan head on it. The aroma was decent, although a little light. There were caramel notes, as well as a faint tinge of roastiness. The taste was good. It was medium bodied and very smooth. Just a hint of sweetness in the taste. Very subdued notes of caramel and dark fruits. Not bad."
"Drinkability - I'm thinking I got a bad bottle, because this is reminding me nothing of the rest of the reviews. I will need to try another bottle of this to make sure, but its not a keeper based on this one bottle."
"Not a bad beer by any means. I was a little put off by the cherry aftertaste but not so much that I wouldn't try again."
"Pours a transparent burnt copper with a tall light brown head that retained well leaving some very light lace as it slowly fades away. The nose smells like dark soda,slightly sweet with some faint hints of chocolate and a bit of noticable hoppage. This Schwarzbier is loaded with caramel,sweeter than I'm used to,not bad,and quite enjoyable. An underlying nuttiness and very obviously hoppy finish bring this back within the realm of the style. The body is on the light side and the mouthfeel it quite creamy and soft. This is a very drinkable Schwarzbier as are most,probably the best green bottle I've had in recent memory."
"Overall, this schwarzbier didn't have much in the flavor department, but it was easy to drink."
"11.2oz green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a dark copper brown with ruby-red highlights and a thin light tan head. Smells strongly of caramel with coffee and chocolate playing strong supporting roles. Tastes very roasty with chocolate and coffee at the fore. Caramel and hints of continental hops are also present. Flavors are a bit more subtle than expected but mesh rather well. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Not the most robust Schwarzbier I've tried, but there's nothing wrong with this one. It's tasty and very drinkable. A solid Schwarzbier."
"Very disappointed."
"Drinkability is high for me. If I could find a 6 pack or anything I'd be sure to get more."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color, mahogany highlights with a weak half inch head with no sustain. Aromas are initially minerally and a little sulphur, subtle roast, even more subtle chocolate and coffee notes. On the palate, things taste old. I get some medium toasty malt flavors, a firm finishing bitterness, but overall smooth and very dry. This has got to be a really old bottle, I don't suspect oxidation, it just tastes old."
"Poured a 33cl bottle into my Val-Dieu goblet. Poured a dark cherry brown. The red really shows through when its held to the light. There was very little head with a hard pour and it left no lacing whatsoever. Aroma is a bit weak. There is definite notes of roasted malts and hints of sweet milk chocolate. Taste is creamy up front with the roasted malts coming out in the finish. Mouthfeel is thinner for the style and finishes slightly dry. This is a very drinkable beer."
"D: My first exposure to a Schwarzbier. A good beer that just surprises with it's milder flavors, smells, and ABV considering it's appearance. I knew what to expect, and still I was surprise. A great beer for when you want multiple darks."
"Poured from the bottle into my Rare Vos glass. It pours a cola brown with a great 1 1/2 inch tan head that settles into a thin foam. I smell pilsner hops, toasted malts, and caramel undertones. The flavor is great. Nice and toasty, with a light body and creamy body. The malty body is delicately balanced with the slightly skunky hop flavor. The carbonation is noticeable and it adds a little bit of dryness and spice to the drink. At 4.9% ABV, this is plenty sessionable. I love a good schwazbier. It's also a good thing to spring on a newer craft beer trier that ""doesn't do dark beer"" because it is so light and well balanced."
"Einbecker Schwarzbier pours a dark brown that on closer inspection appears to be a dark ruby red with an off white head from a green 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is malty. The flavor is dark malty goodness. There's nothing flashy about this beer, but it's a solid easy drinking lager. Sessionable."
"Poured from a green bottle (sigh) looking dark brown, clear, and with head retention. The aroma is roasted and malty with a touch of sulfur. The flavor starts with dark roasted malts, not burnt, but there's a slight coffee note in the aftertaste. There's a little bit of grassy hops there as well, but it's a bit bland overall. The mouthfeel is medium and just a touch on the heavy side, well-balanced with high carbonation. Overall, there's a nice balance of hops and malt, a little sweet, btu good."
"The taste is more of the same. Adjuncts, sweetness, and a touch of caramel. To be honest it tasted like your generic Euro Lager (think Beck's) in dark form. No thanks. I'm a big fan of schwarzbiers, but this one was a let down. Mouthfeel was light and carbonated. This could be a session beer if you wanted it to be, but to be honest, I was good with one. Wouldn't go back to this one."
"Weak and small Head. Pours Dark Brown. Malty and almost pilsner aroma. I found that this is good meal beer because it doesnÂ’t have a lot of carbonation. Probably better labeled as a dark pilsner as opposed to a traditional schwarzbier. Serve colder to get a better woody, smoky flavor."
"Brew poured to a brown color but your able to see through it, has a medium sized light tan head that had very limited retention. No lacing to speak of. The aroma seems to be pretty good, nice strong malt scent that gives off the idea of caramel also giving a sweet smell. The taste is a letdown IMO, the malt scent does not carry over to the taste. Seems very watery, what is there reminds me a bit of caramel but also finishes a little odd. Has a sweet flavor and has a slight hop ending. This brew was a let down, I enjoy Schwarzbier very much but IMO this just did not meet the cut. I feel that there are many other offerings that are much better than this one."
"Pours a clear but dark ruby with no head. Nose is very slightly smoked it seems. Very minute malt character there too. Overall it seems to be very subdued on the nose. Flavor is a bit meaty with a slight woody, inky edge to it. Feel has a nice bubble to it, though I feel like there is a thick ink character in this one that stays on my tongue. Feels kind of odd. Drinkability is good. It is a smooth brew, with some unusual characteristics from the style. But overall it is no homerun."
"Into a pint glass, pours a clear dark brown, not much head, then nothing, almost no lacing. The aroma is sparse, mineral infused, a faint caramel, nothing much else. The taste is a speck better, good bitterness, but really needs more carbonation and body to hold up any flavors that might be there. Forgettable."
"Drinkability is probably about average. I didn't really want to finish mine, but I did. I imagine that fans of the style may be more inclined to enjoy it. Personally, I thought it tasted like a more expensive version of Negro Modelo, but that might just be me."
"Mouthfeel is light with a smooth carbonation. Interesting step out of the ordinary for me."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable although not the best Schwarzbier I've had"
"I love Einbeckers, but this was my least favorite. Not bad by any means. Hardly spectacular."
"Very drinkable!"
"Good schwarzbier, it's dark and drinkably mild."
"drinkers who like sweet and smokey brews will not be dissapointed by this one. it is complex and unique to the style, which makes it a worthy try for any fan of beer."
"Well, I wasn't expecting this beer to have a skunky hop characteristic - so I am left to assume that the single green bottles under the fluorescent lights at the shop are the culprit."
"Drinkability - Good beer."
"with gust"
"Not thrilled with this one. Something about it is drinkable, but the aroma and taste need a boost."
"Drinks easy, but off-style to be sure. This brewery didn't impress in Germany & still doesn't here"
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, and I really like the malt presence. I like all of the beers from this brewery, and I certainly wasn't disappointed in this beer. I would drink this beer (and many others from this brewery) if they were available regularly in my area. For now, I will just savor the few bottles that I brought back from Missouri."
"Of the Schwarzbiers out there, this one is my favorite. And I found a fairly fresh (kept in a cooler/beer cave) batch at Shawan Liquors recently. Rich roasted flavor without the ""smokiness"" you sometimes get, and no green bottle skunk or off flavors this time. Really enjoyed it."
"Good beer."
"Drinkability: I have been on a darker lager kick lately and this one gives me reasont o keep checking them out. Great flavor, reasonable ABV, a good candidate for a few more."
"Pours nearly black with hints of reddish brown at the edges with a huge 3 finger foamy head with good retention and sticky lacing. Smells of nice dark roasted malts and some molasses. Taste is predominantly of dark roasted malts with some molasses and what seemed like a hint of dark chocolate at the finish. Good mouthfeel, nice light body, seems to fit well with the style. Good drinkability, very enjoyable."
"This isn't really roasted in any way which leads me to think this is more of a Bavarian dunkel than a schwarzbier. In fact, this is only labeled ""schwarzbier"" in America. Let's just say its a good, easily drinkable German dark lager of sorts."
"D: Tasty, not very filling, very easy to drink, certainly poundable due to the low ABV. Overall itÂ’s a decent beer but not my favorite within the style."
"Overall a very nice and quaffable schwarzbier. I am convinced that this is perhaps the most underated beer style."
"This beer pours a clear dark brown color with amber hues around the edges. The head is solid, tannish-white, and long lasting. The aroma is of a generic dark lager. Caramel malt is nice, but the is nothing special about this beers aroma. This taste is a mirror image of the aroma. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated; so much so that it is annoying and certainly takes away from the taste. Overall, this beer is a major disappointment, and I'm not even sure if I would drink it again if it were free."
"Pour is a nearly opaque black with a garnet tint, where the light barely creeps through. Smell is very mild roasted malt, not too easy to pick up on. Taste is clean and smooth, again hitting the roasty note. Very easy to drink 2-3 and not blink an eye..."
"Not a bad schwarzbier in my book."
"Fairly drinkable in the right conditions. If you're just drinking, the taste gets old, but if you're eating a steak dinner its very drinkable."
"The drinkability is also very good. A very fine example of this style. Prosit Und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Looks good from the pour, a brown with ruby hues, a thick peachy brown colored head that sits nicely in an oversized pilsner glass. Smells is german, slight alocohol, sweet malts, and that mild earthy hop aroma. Nothing special. And for the taste, again, nothing staggering, mostly pale, with a little sweet malts (by the color I'd have guess differently than I'm percieving in taste), bit darker in the finish, but mostly hi-fi and watery. Bland, and rather bright for a ""dark"" beer. The aftertaste lingers with the dry unsweetened cocoa note and sime residual hop spice. This saves it from being swill. Motuhfeel is medium and the carbonation is just fine. I wouldnt borther drinking this again. I was searching for an imported schwarz to get better aligned with the style without knowing what to pick and grabbed this one because it was there, but it seems this may not have been the best pick. For now, taste-wise I prefer SA Dark Lager."
"A really good Schwarzbier IMO."
"Good beer that is often overlooked. Great for those times when you want a flavorful, but soft and delicate beer that is not overly sweet or heavy. Very stout-like in it's toasted / roasted flavors, but Dunkel-like in the texture and cleanliness. Looks, well, black without looking viscous. Has a very roasty flavor with a light grape and licorice notes. Very clean flavor and well brewed. A Dry Stout charcoal finish. Crisp and abrupt. Good beer with only a light malt sweetness to balance."
"Poured transparent dark brown with small white head that disappeared very quickly; decent lace. Smells predominantly of caramel with toasted bread notes and leafy hops. Flavor is quite weak; clean but thin and watery toasted malts with a slightly drier leafy finish. A touch of unpleasant diacetyl aftertaste. Thin body up front, develops some oily creaminess towards the finish."
"Poured a deep-reddish brown color with Modeerate tannish head. Nice lacing. Smell is a mixture of molasses, brown sugar, toasted malt and caramel. Taste is similiar to the smell, but after several tastes it slowly dissappears. Finished with a somewhat thin feeling in the mouth with little if any body. Easy drinking, but rather bland."
"Drinkability: This beer has session written all over it! I'm just glad that since it was in a green bottle and sitting on the shelf in the light that it wasn't skunked."
"The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it. The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it. Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it. This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer. Despite this, the beer is quite tasty."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite of mine. Won't return to it. Not horrible, but it just doesn't do anything for me."
" This is definitely not my cup of tea, but it is interesting and fairly tasty, although its shortcomings in appearance and smell hurt the drinkability a bit. An intriquing selection..I won't look for this beer again, but I would give the brewer another shot because this example shows some craft brewing chops."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty light and a lot of great carbonation that really lifts up malts well and really makes this beer so easy to drink. Its not even gasey. At least as any beer can be."
"Einbecker's version is a valid one, although I find myself wishing for more of... pretty much everything. The 11.2 ounces disappeared in a flash, so I must have found something to like. This one is worth a look if you're a schwarzbier aficionado. Probably not if you're not."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable"
"A good beer from a brewery that has consistently managed to make superb German lagers. A tasty and drinkable beer with a great roasty, malty flavor. Highly recommended!"
"I was hoping for more from this beer. Maybe because I adore their Maibock so much. Don't get me wrong, the craftsmanship and construction of this lager is top-notch. I was just left wanting more. A good beer to introduce newbies into 'dark' beer territory."
"Overall: Nothing outstanding, a so-so Schwarzbier that was a little too heavy on the burnt sugar and molasses for my taste."
"Light to medium bodied, easily drinkable."
"This is a decent drinkable beer but nothing to get excited about."
"Pours a dark clear reddish brown, big loose head forms but leaves just as quick, not much lace to speak of, beer is rather dull. Smells like iron, roasted malt, sweet also a dark fruit smell. Tastes sweet, with some light roast flavour and dark fruits. Also an iron flavour in there. Body is pretty light, very low carbonation, tastes like a weak doppelbock, not so good."
"Looks almost black in low light, but some maroon coloring is seen when held to light. Creamy tan head, abot 1/2"" then fades slowly to a 1/4"". Smell is light grassy malt and some roasted malt, slightly buttery. Taste is dominated by grassy malts, some burnt flavors, about what you'd expect from the style. Decent hops finish lingers with the burnt tones. Well carbonated mouthfeel. Pretty good beer."
"While I'm not impressed, this would be a good choice for someone who is starting to drink non-macros."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a towering offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a roasted crystal malt scent that is sweet and slightly dry. The taste is average. It has a thin and light crystal malt flavor that seems a bit watered down and weak. It goes down easy and finishes dry and watery. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This beer has good aroma, but it's really weak in the flavor and mouthfeel. It drinks easy, but it's one and done for me."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with little lace. Smells somewhat like granny smith apples with a slight noble hop aroma. Taste is dry, crisp but somewhat metallic. Good malt backbone but very slight to no roasted flavor. If eyes are closed, tastes more like a MÃ¤rzen than anything else. Overall, I'd say it's slightly above average."
"It poured with a tannish, somewhat creamy head and a very deep auburn, but not quite opaque, body. The nose is chocolatey roast malt. A full figured mouthfeel, amazingly quite smooth. The chocolate malt is prevalent and I am surprised at how subdued the roasted aspect is. A little underwhelming actually. The finish is somewhat creamy with some bitterness that accompanies a fading chocolate note. Its ok, not outstanding. Frankly I was expecting a little more smokiness or at least roastiness."
"Drinkability Â– This is a good, solid entry into the Black Beer market."
"Addendum: Smells a bit like old tree bark, and leather. Clearly sepia; beautiful transluscence with a healthy froth. The lace slips down easily like garters on prom night. Delicious malty darjeeling. Unsweetened baking chocolate, walnuts, dark brown sugar. Give me a pitcher with rye bread, radish, and a nutty, strong cheese."
"Pours more of deep red than black with a one finger head that settled into a thin layer coating the top of the beer,nice subtle complexities in the aroma I got some buttery notes as some caramel and even a touch of iron.Taste has almost a spiced coffee cake flavor to it some baking spice and brown sugar are big with some coffee thrown in.A nice brew here not overly complex but there some nice flavors in there,interesting."
"Pours with a three-finger cream head that some lace. Clear deep amber color. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Slightly malty nose. Starts sweet finishes mellow, a good schwarz even with the green bottle. $1.90 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Very drinkable but not nearly as good as Kostrizer Schwarzbier in flavor or smell. Nor was it a compelling as either the Ur-bock or Mai-Ur-Bock from this brewery."
"a shameful excuse for a schwarzbier..."
"A very nice and mellow beer. I can see how some might be disappointed with it due to the lighter than expected flavor, but what is present here is quite pleasing. If in a quaffing mood, this might be one of the easiest dark beers to chug. I can imagine pairing this with a roast beef on dark pumpernickel sandwich. This beer is worth a try, especially if you've yet to have a schwarzbier."
"Overall, I'd have to say that the appearance, smell, and taste were exactly what I was expecting the moment I saw this brew on the shelf! Quite impressed indeed, and will most certainly buy again."
"Medium-full feel. A bit plain, not something I'd go for often."
" Taste is caramel malt, roasted grain, and a hint of herbal hops. This one seems to become thinner in body, as it warms. Slight, hops bitterness at the finish evens out the sweet malt profile enough to earn nice marks for drinkability."
"It pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a tan head that lasts. It has a malty licorice aroma. The body is light, but it is very flavorful. There is some chocolate and raisin notes with a slight spice. It finishes crisp and dry with some delicate noble hops. A good starting point for those shy about dark beers because it is so light in body."
"Dark brown pour with some reddish light transmission. Nice head of 1/2 an inch of rising foam and with excellent lacing properties. Smell of light nutiness, malty sweetness and just a touch of grape. The mouthfeel is shy of medium but with a sharpness lent by fresh and grassy hoppiness that reminds me of its Mai bock cousin, and a beer I've had a soft spot for. Biscuity and honeyish malts compete early, but the attenuation is very nice and the beer dries to a satisfying finish. Well-balanced and more interesting than some other Schwarzbiers, slightly skeletal in body but with an added complexity."
"This beer goes down pretty smooth and has a great taste. This is a top pick of the style for me."
"I didn't have real high aspirations for this beer, as I have been unimpressed by the style in the past. Maybe it's because I had this after a couple of pilsners, but I really enjoyed it (particularly the taste). This is to Celebrator what Blanche de Chambly is to La Fin Du Monde. Nice, chocolate malt flavor, smooth and tasty. Somewhat thin and watery, and ultimately inconsequential. Nonetheless, a nice beer. I liked their pils quite a bit, also."
"330ml bottle labeled Einbecker SchwarzbierPoured an ice tea color brown with a thick head that is slowly settling down. Aroma is slightly roasted with a note of caramel. Body is a bit on the flat side. Flavor is a bit sweet and a bit weak also. Finishes dry. Overall very average and not worthy of future consumption."
"Color is a bit off with a clear chestnut brown with a ruby-like glow within, the head more then made up for it though, solid, finger high, thick and firm off-white top that sat a good while before fading down to a thick skim, globby small lacing. Aroma is roasty and sweet of malts with some plum and raisin undertones. Flavors are sweet and lightly dry of a roasted quality that aren't withstanding some length or boldness, not that its really all that necessary for the style but it seems to be over quickly. There's some nice subtlities to the roastyness with toffee, caramel, dark fruits, and grasses that help keep its pleasing tone, the finish is fluffy clean and slightly dry which is nice as well. Slight metalic bittering sneaks in nearer the finish. Feel is lightly creamy with a smooth light carbonation and hold of drying qualities within its medium body. Its a nice little drinker, mild and easy."
"Nice beer."
"The taste is clean, crisp, and warmly malty. Not that complex, but a nice, pleasant afternoon drink."
"slightly tannish head with a deep garnet dark brownish color. skunky aroma...that's it nothing else is decernable. smooth balanced with a slight bit of malty (munich?) background, no hop character at all but I wouldn't want one either. nicely balanced and very easy to drink. this would be excellent on tap."
"Tan colored head doesn't leave any lace, but clings to the sides as it sinks. Light caramel smell, but mostly malt. The beer is dark brown in color, with a ruby hue. An even mix of toasted malt with a pinch of caramel and a floral hoppy bitterness make up the taste. The carbonation is pretty evident in the mouthfeel, and the finish ends slightly bitter."
"Drinkability: While a very enjoyable beer, the dryness is a little more than I care for. I could not drink many of these back to back. Maybe after repeated exposure I will adjust to the dryness."
"This beer pours a clear dark reddish brown color with a moderately large rocky tan head. The smell is of sweet roasted malt. The taste/mouthfeel was moderate to thin with a sharp effervescence and little of the maltiness that was promised by the aroma and very little aftertaste. I thought I had a great beer from the aroma but was sadly dissapointed at the flavor. What was there wasn't bad but there just wasn't enough of it."
"An excellent dunkel. I've never tried anything by this brewery, so it was a pleasant surprise. Very clean flavors, with an excellent smooth malt profile."
"This was one pretty looking beer. Deep brown in color with lots of colorful highlights shining through. Taste was very even and went down really well. Flavors came at me with a sharp crispness. Toasted malts were there, caramel malt flavor followed, a roasted bitterness came through after that. Dark fruit taste was in the mix also. Well balanced and well crafted."
"Named Einbecker Dunkel in Europe - allegedly the same beer (the Schwarzbier label is supposed to look trendier in the US). And it's definitely a Dunkel, not a Schwarzbier! Reddish brown colour, bread yeast and just a hint of coffee in the aroma. Flavour leaves you with the impression of drinking this beer in a bakery (this is not necessarily an insult to the beer - it's probably an OK accompaniment with a few sandwiches or even Danish pastry). Drier than I expected. Not as good as the Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel (and not nearly as good as Aass Bock, which I enjoyed 1 hour earlier) - a bit watery, but still a drinkable dunkel that won't offend anyone."
"This beer poured a very dark brown (almost black) but clear with hints of red if held to the light. The foam was creamy and tan, and it clung to the glass and left some lace. The smell was modest but cocoa, caramel, and malt could be discerned. The taste was cocoa, mild chocolate, and caramel malt with very low hop presence. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with a slightly bitter, crisp finish. The body was medium with moderate carbonation feel. The drinkability was very good. This beer was easy to drink."
"This beer pours a very dark amber color with very small head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity - very pleasant. Alcohol is also slightly apparent in the nose. Malt is very apparent in the flavor. It is very smooth and the mouthfeel is very good. The fruit taste is pretty strong in the taste, making it very pleasant on the tongue. Great beer."
"pours out a clear and dark garnet colour with deep ruby hues. very pretty! a light tan head appears and slowly dissipates to a thin fine lace. lovely dark fruit and candy malt aroma with the typical german hop notes wafting about. a quite reserved but tasty dark malt flavour hits the tastebuds...light choco and caramel...sweet dark fruits peek through...all rounded out by some noble hops in the end. a somewhat skimpy, but silky smooth mouthfeel lets it slide right down my throat. a hint of crispness in the finish and you're left wanting to take another sip quite quickly. damn easy drinking and rather tasty to boot. a fine german brew."
"This brew poured a medium tan head with small to medium bubbles. The lacing was very sparse on the sides of my mug. I had a hard time trying to figure out the aroma on this particular brew. It had a smooth taste, but it was on the watery side. There was no bitterness noted with this brew. It lacks character and I was not very impressed with this drink."
"This is a beer searching for more character, still it is a very enjoyable beer even if it does not match the more superior beers in its style."
"Dark brown coloring with a reddish hue. Fruity aromas of grape/date with some maltiness to boot. Taste is dominated by tangy/fruity notes--apple and appleskin come to mind. A little bit of malty sweetness comes into play as the beer warms, but it remains a tart sort of brew all the way through. Solid but unspectacular."
"Sometimes a guys gotta' wonder if there are drinking the same beer as others are, but my experiences differs from many on this one, especially with the aroma, which was all hops (including a noticeable aroma upon opening the bottle). Now a nice german lager hops, but no indication of malt. Dark brown to black with hints of garnet when held to the light. Clear. Short and thin head. Starts as a European pilsner and that's a taste that remains throughout. Middle to finish brings on the roasted malt flavors. The longer the beer sits the more the malt comes through. It's all very short lived. Interesting mix of flavors. Medium to high carbonation. Interesting beer, probably more of a dunkel than schwartzbier."
"Mahagony in color and only slightly transparent with a light tan head.  Very interesting and complex nose.  Pretty well rounded with a medium body.  Caramel contributes to the generally sweet taste of the beer. Light bitterness in the finish."
"Mouthfeel was nice, let you know you are drinking a beer, a bit of a musty back of the mouth taste tho,  other than that an excellent version of Black Beer"

"Notes: An outstanding Schwarzbier/Dunkel. Balanced, tasty and an absolute treat for the taste buds. I highly recommend seeking this beer out."
