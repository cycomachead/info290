3.82,-5.2,3,3.5,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear dark brown color with a small foamy light khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, toffee, molasses, light dark fruit, and roast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roast/bready malt and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, toffee, molasses, light dark fruits, and roast/yeast earthiness. Light amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, toffee, molasses, light dark fruit, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt and yeast ester flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a very nice schwarzbier style. All around good robustness and complexity of roast/bready malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 07, 2014"
4,-0.7,,,,,,"I hated to break the seal on this wonderful bottle, but once it was Pop!ped and the swing top swung, I began the pour in earnest. The pseudo-cascade was quick and formed a finger of dense, deep-tan head that looked like a muffin top. Color was Opaque/Black (SRM = 44) with NE-quality clarity and garnet highlights at the edges. Nose had a pronounced maltiness, almost like being in the malt room itself. It was earthy, slightly grassy and exactly what I was hoping for. Mmm. I broke out the pretzels for this one! Mouthfeel was full and creamy. The taste was chocolaty, slightly grassy, eminently drinkable. Finish was semi-sweet with the malt really leading the way, but not so aggressively as to be cloying.","woodychandler","Oct 06, 2014"

The splendid taste had more of the aforementioned aspects, as well as chicory and coffee, and some faint hops. All very, very balanced and smooth. What a full mouth feel one gets with this for such a low ABV beer! Truly a triumph of a Schwarzbier, definitely my new favorite of the style (I love German Beer).

The taste starts off with some toasted caramel malts that gives way to some subtle hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation, and the beer is very drinkable.

The taste is of a watery milk chocolate, similar to Nestles Quik. There is also a raisin & carob presence. The roasted malt is very light and does not add much flavor to the brew. The feel is light with soft carbonation; finishes sweet and slightly sticky. A very average swarzbier. I was hoping for more of a roasted malt presence. I always question the freshness of these German brews that I get, perhaps this was on the older side. I still prefer the Sam Adams or Sprecher Schwarzbiers.","Gmann","Jan 08, 2010"

Semi-transparent mahogany brown to red-orange in color, especially further out from the center. Hard candy caramel and toffee scents in the nose, red grape and cherry fruit, glazed biscuit and bran muffin notes, roasted pecans, some mocha dust comes out as it warms, the hops have a serene consistency that just about eliminates any undesired sweetness to the nose as a whole. Medium-bodied, creamy textured with a soft, pliable carbonation which helps it cling to the mouth pores more than scrub at them. Admirably smooth, the chocolate, toffee, butterscotch flavors pair with the grape, cherry, red berry fruit to guarantee that the mouth entry will be sweet. This even as the hops more pronounced and apt to add a sour twist towards the end. Actually not overly smoky and you're more likely to discern white citrus or rye/wheat notes than smoke specifically. Drinkability is high and the dryness at the end contributes to this. Not a lot of ""wow"" factor yet it steadily wins you over.","farrago","Jul 19, 2009"

I guess I should rate this down since its not black like the style suggests, but it looks nice so I'm not. Smells roasty, and of dark chocolate. First thing I noticed about how it tastes is that it has a earthy, somewhat metallic character to it. Not what I expected but I like it. Chocolate and roasted flavors dominate. Creamy head, but sharp, highly effervescent finish. I liked this beer. The earthy character makes it stand out I guess.","drunkboxer1","Jun 06, 2009"

4.19,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Just arrived today at the store. Looks more like a Dunkel when it is poured. Dark brown with big bubbles. Aroma is faint, but it expresses the roasted malts and light hops perfectly. I could almost mistake this beer for an English mild. Looking one more time at it into the light, it resembles burgundy with head. The flavors are amazing. Bready and toasted, with hints of caramel, and mocha, followed with a dry hop finish that is almost non-existent. This beer is so smooth, I could have a few at a time if I could afford it.

Tastes of earthy malt up front, yeast cleanliness second, then the sweet malt and hop background come through, the finish is a bit sour/bitter with hints of roasted malt.

A full tan head of 2 fingers sat and left some good lace while drinking. The aroma was a deeply roasted malt with nuts and a hint of toffee in the vein of a nice porter. The flavor was a great rich continuation of the aroma with the hint of espresso added and a nice hop edge at the end with a wee tad of lemon.

Tastes of roasted malts with an elusive hop finish. There's just enough taste and body to this to make it interesting, and just enough drinkability to make it fun and sessionable.

A billowing tan head forms and sticks around for a long time. Even after dying down a bit, there is still a full finger of foam on top and fantastic lacing on the glass. The best looking lager I've seen. Smells strongly of dark roasted malt with light hints of cocoa. This carries over to the taste, where dark malts are dominant, along with hints of chocolate, some nuttiness, and a slight metallic taste. Hops are noticeable in the lightly bitter, dry finish, but are low-key otherwise. Good, thickish mouthfeel, especially for its strength.

The beer pours a wonderfully dark brown color with nice clarity, creamy head formation and stubborn 1/2"" retention. Laces well. Aromas a light on the roasted end, giving a chalky, powdery scent. A boost of light caramel supplies the scent of malt, but no real hops detected in the nose. Flavors of well-attenuated caramel malt sets the stage, while the black malts give a mild, dry, coffee-like nuance to the edges. Hopped only to offset sweetness, the hops to marry into the bitterness of black malt well for a complex bitterness that doesn't overwhelm the light caramel flavor. Texture is medium- better than most lighter Schwarzbiers. Powdery, chalky, and dry in the finish with a light linger of coffee and caramel. Not my everyday beer, but pleasant nonetheless.","BEERchitect","Mar 26, 2008"

A good burnt grain aroma coming off of it. A touch of caramel with some nuttiness to it. The taste was nice and smoked, very well done. Not over powering at all, just enough of a hint of it against the grain back to let you know it was there. A touch of yeast in the front and a dry finish. Great light feel and a medium bidy went down well with amble carbonation. I easily could have had another, but they charged way too much for the one bottle to begin with.

I love the taste even more! Perhaps it was complimented by the delicious roast duck tenders that arrived at the same time, but this just seemed almost too refreshing for a beer with it's dark color.

Smells slightly yeasty (hefe wiese yeasty lager yeasty) with subtle notes of roasted barley and chocolate. Very clean no fruit in the nose, obviously because of lager fermentation. Taste is not terribly out going or crazy flavorful very smooth and subtle. The flavor play really operates on a low level. Roasted barley is present with notes of biscuit, with a slight caramel hint.

Other than that I have to say the beer was a bit on the week side, not a strong smell, not many specialty malt flavors or perceptable hop flavors, and a bit of that baking soda/carbonation taste as well.

Tall dark ivory head thats firm and pretty thick with good consistency of a whipped cream frothy look. Lacing in thick strings and large blobuels. Not much on the nose here, just an openness that has some light roasty tones and dryness to it. Some small phenol and sweet notes sneak in as it warms. Taste is mild with a roasted sweetness, has a dryish cocoa under tone and it survives a fairly sufficent descent throughout its tenure. Which menas it seems to last a good while eh. It has a very slight burntness gettting close to coffee with some heavy roasted nuts. A gentle but raw husky grassy finish helps out a bit and late effecting cocoa notes subside. Easy, clean feel, medium bodied, nice mild little sweetness and roasty tone. A good drinkin' beer. Not much for the nose but it makes up for it with a nice, easy going pace with flavors and body. On another note, I'll be keeping this bottle with the swing top stopper for the reason that it has three labels on it?

First the appearance was a dark amber with a substantial head that dissolved into some of the best lacing I have seen. Aroma was light and malty, but inviting. Taste was light to medium, and as it warmed became more pronounced. Mouthfeel also became a bit oily, but not in an unpleasant way. Very easy to drink, could definitely have two or three.

It's a bit sharp on the mouthfeel, mostly due to a bit of carbonation. The taste is quite pleasant, with a well-rounded nuttiness and a sweet malty aftertaste.

Aroma is comprised of lightly sweet, soft nutty malt with hints of dry cocoa and subtle dark roasted grain. Trace herbal hop nose. Stately and pleasant aromawise. Mellow combination of dehusked chocolate and black malt bitterness upfront in flavor is ensued by a light toasted, bready Munich sweetness, which lingers briefly. Mild hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness promptly and complements roasted grain presence, lending a dry, bittersweet overall character. Lightly bodied and well attenuated, but appropriately so as to facilitate easy quaffing. Judiciously dextrinous. Finishes crisp, with notes of faint herbal hop and savory dry biscuit. Not complex, but well balanced and flavorful. Soft on the palate and mellow.","marc77","May 11, 2003"

Starts like your taking a nip off a piggy bank, buds awash in metallic flavors. Fortunately these pfennigs quickly melt away to reveal a liquid malt center that soon succumbs to the juju of spicy hops. But not for long, as these same hexing hops concede to a more beguiling roastiness sporting a lanky finish. Curt and clean through the beer hose. Not quite as complex or satisfying as some--really more like a decent dunkel with some roasted malts thrown in--but still rather flavory.","inebrius","Mar 04, 2003"

3.78,-6.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Nice appearance with a clear deep-burgundy/dark-mahogany color and a full tan head. The head dissipates shortly to a thin collar but it can be brought back up with a simple swirl of the glass, and it continues to leave spotty lace throughout the serving. The nose is limited but clean, and displays only a mildly nutty touch of caramel and some minor deep roasted malt. It doesn't do anything to draw you in, but it certainly doesn't push you away - it's simply neutral. The body is light/medium with a very fine carbonation that's gently crisp in the mouth. Again, it doesn't add to the beers character, but it doesn't detract either. The flavor, thankfully, offers more with some light toffee and caramel upfront, followed by a mildly chocolate note that dissolves into gentle roastiness and light acidity in the finish. It's dry with some lingering maltiness and a touch of leafy hops that leave you looking for more - and yet that adds to its drinkability!
