"Overall – A decent schwarzbier. Light in abv. with a decent amount of roasted and toasted flavors. A rather good session style beer."

"Pours a clear dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, toasted malt, and cocoa. Taste is much the same with a slight smoke flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that has a somewhat dirty flavor and a better smell in my opinion."

"this is a very true to style beer, not hardly deviating at all from the traditional recipe. the pour is black but letting some light pass. the head is huge, three inches at least, foamy but airy, and with good staying power. i smell roast coffee, chocolate malt, and a lager yeast that is working wonders with this complexity. the flavor vindicates that, with some burnt sugar on the front end and bitter cocoa on the back end, tempered only by a touch of sweeter german malt and a yeast that has a tendency to calm everything down. this slides down the throat with real ease, and is much lighter than it looks is so many ways. it feels like a classic german dark lager, mellow fizz, creamy oaty feel, and a full body that doesnt limit how easily and quickly it can be consumed. this was delicious. not intriguing or challenging, but a beer you keep coming back to because its consistently well made. bravo for this."

"Overall: a tasty, satisfying and highly drinkable schwarzbier. Good stuff!"
""
""
"Medium bodied with a sharp effervescence up front that drops off quickly. Drying finish, cleaner than I thought. A decent brew but nothing special."
""
"Had on tap at a GB restaurant. It's got that deep black body, medium tan head. Dark roasted malts are apparent on the nose and palate. Slightly bittersweet, pretty well-balanced. GB definitely does malty stuff well, and their Schwarzbier is as expected. Nothing fancy, but enjoyable."

"My first time with the style and I liked this one. Poured brown with a big fluffy white head and lots of bubbles flowing through. Aroma of light roast, smoke, some chocolate sweetness. Flavor follows with roasty chocolate and a hint of smoke, but very light. Kind of a very light porter with the roasty chocolate smell and taste. Finishes well with just a hint of smoky bitter and roasty chocolate lingering on the palate. Good beer."

"Came out a deep unassuming black. A small beige sheet of head capped it off. The nose carried notes of coffee, mild cocoa powder and faint aromas of leafy veggies. Moderate carbonation here. Decent feel. Good roasted flavors noted, as well as a bit of a hop smack on the finish. Semi-sweet dark chocolate, mild graininess. This was a good beer, and really hit the spot on this mid-afternoon stop. I'd like to see this one in bottle form."
"O: This is very good and interesting beer. It is dark in color yet light in taste and abv. Lots if flavors and aromas here. Very enjoyable and smooth."

"Overall:	It might be my favorite from this particular visit."
""

"Enjoyed this beer after two straight bad ones. It may be my non-seasonal-go-to-beer from GB now."
"On tap @ GB in KCMO. Pours a really nice dark brown, almost black. Smells of some caramel malts, a little smoke, and some toasted malt. Taste is similar to the nose. Some caramel malts open this up. These fade to a little smoked malts and a touch of fruits. Watery mouthfeel that also translates on the palate. This is a decent beer. Worth a shot, but I was ready to move on."

"At 4.3% ABV, this is highly sessionable from the tap. We were in at happy hour on Saturday during football and received $1 off each beer. It's great to wash down the salty happy hour special appetizers (e.g., house made chips with blue cheese, scallions, and bacon; mini pizza). I would entertain this with a good hot dog loaded with sauerkraut and mustard."
"o - Overall a pretty godo schwarzbier; up there with their Marzen as one of their better beers I've had. Easy to drink and vey roasty, I'd order it again."
"There's a black patent malt presence to the otherwise mocha-ish flavor. Body is appropriate for the style (watery), which translates to being thin. Good hop ending that blends well with the darker malt flavors. The aftertaste is of toasted nuts and dry coffee grounds."
"Had the Schwarzbier at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a deep dark amber with ecru head that laced slightly. The aroma was sweet with hints of malt and espresso. The taste was a very good balance of grain, hops and malt with roast/coffee following. The was a slight sweetness that made the beer smooth to drink and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was ok, I need a little bit more body was coffee flavor is present, so I probably would not coose to session with this one."
"Anyway, this poured a dark brown with a thin, off-white head. Dark malts in the nose, moderately roasty. Not much else to speak of, as would be expected in the style. Dark roasted malts in the taste, hints of coffee, and not much else; little to no hops detectable. Medium bodied, and perhaps a bit thinner than some of the world's better schwarzbiers, but still good, and really the only GB selection, I desired to have more of."
"O - A little too light for schwarzbier but other than that very good beer."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice bit of foamy head. Smells of roasts, malts and grains. Tastes much the same with hints of chocolate, burnt grain, malts and a nice smooth, dry, roasted finished. Very easy to drink, although fairly simple and forgettable."
"O- It's a good enough beer, but there are some tweeks (particularly with the finish) that could make it a better beer for me."
"D- It was an ok beer but not the best. may have to try this one again to make sure it was not a bad batch."
"Very good. This is one of my favorite beers."
"Sampled at Gordon Biersch restaurant in Dallas, TX. Pours almost black hue with a thin, white head . Aroma is coffee, nutty and some toasted malt. Body is creamy, medium-full. Taste is similar to the aroma. Long coffee like finish. On the whole, it is a nice session brew."
"D: Very easy drinking beer, very easy to have several of these."
"D - Easy to quaf, just not all that interesting."
"The taste is a bit more subdued. There is some nice roast, but the chocolate and earthy notes from the nose are quite a bit more muted. The feel is nice and pretty roasty. Fairly dry in general with a nice finish. Drinkability is decent enough, but there's not enough there to keep me hanging on."
"Pretty good drinking beer in and of itself. However, it seemed to me leaning more in the porter direction. Again it was served with a small, off-white head, and good lace, which seems to be policy at GB. Color was an opaque black brown. Aroma was malt, roast, vanilla. Flavor was similar plus was fairly dry, and well balanced. Body was full and round with good carbonation. Finish was like flavor and of medium length. Session beer."
" ~ Would I recommend this beer??? I suppose, but not too highly."
"O: Great example to style, but would have liked an increase in hop aroma and caramel upfront, otherwise the initial taste is a little watery on the palate, otherwise a finely crafted beer. I paired this with the steak frite done medium w/ garlic fries drizzled in marzen sauce and I am in my place of zen, especially getting to use my AHA pub discount benefits » this beer set me back 2 bucks. Its good to be a homebrewer / aha member!!"
"D - This is a nice schwarzbier. They really do a nice job with all these Greman brews."
"Enjoyed at the San Jose location with my meal, this German style brew shows a deep black mahogany color with a modest off-white head and very little lace. The aroma is mild coffee grinds and delicate prune. A bit too subtle but not bad. The flavor brings bright cracker and weak coffee. Generally weak in feel with a medium light body and fair carbonation. There's a slight citrus hop idea and dry finish. Pretty crisp and refreshing, interesting but kind of wimpy. It's drinkable enough but not something I would necessarily nominate for sessioning."
"Overall: Highly disappointed with the Schwarzbier. It's definitely ""bier"" but not ""schwarz."" Definitely didn't reach expectations."
"I'm not a huge fan of this style of beer, but what I had here was decent. Pour a cloudy, dark brown with a creamy white head. I definitely got some roastiness in the mix and tasted some light hops, but overall the flavor was mild and uninteresting. I didn't dislike this beer, but it was rather dull."
"The best I had from the brewpub. Decent, and worth a look. Simple, but enjoyable."
"D: Drinkable. Maybe slightly better than average. I would get it again."
"Easy drinker with the light abv."
"D: Very easy drinking... the dark color may scare some away who aren't familiar with the style, but they should really give it a try. A good sipping beer."
"Tastes medium intensity roast with mild sweet underneath. Roast is coffee and char-like with a gentle sour edge. Mild hop grassiness. Drying finish due to good attenuation and a slight alcohol cleaning. Light body, but some creaminess. Modest carbonation. Nicely hopped for the style, but a bit too charred for the style."
"This is another great beer at GB in Rockville. In the German language, this beer actually means ""black beer."" One would think there would be a heavier body, but did not come across as heavily bodied as one would think. It had a chocolate-esqe flavor to it and had a dark brown tint. A very good Schwarzbier. Definitely give it a try."
"Goes down smoothly, really a wonderful beer, provided I pretend it's a porter. I'm hoping that maybe that some malt that was roasted too long went into it; I'll try it again with another batch in a few months to see if that's the case."
"D: Excellent Schwarzbeir. The roasted grains and organic feel make this top notch."
"This beer is pretty boring, which I guess is a fit with the style (I find Schwarzbiers to be pretty unexciting), but this one registers with me overall as just sort of OK. Dark, not too roasty, inoffensive. Dry? Yes. I just can't say much about this beer - there is not much here to describe, but there is certainly nothing off or offensive either. I don't know whether to recommend or not...I am stumped."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable dark beer; versatile"
"Pours from the tap to an old motor oil black (expected of a Schwarzbier), with a thick foamy tan head that lingers well thru the entire drink and leaves decent lacing. The nose, while somewhat muted, is licorice and a hint of roasted nuts. Mouth is very tingly, albeit a tad weak, with the taste again leaning toward licorice. Finish is of medium duration and a little watery, but overall a pretty decent beer."
"Overall, great interpretation and really loved the roasted qualities in addition to the more traditional flavors for the style. Check it out."
"A pleasant surprise from a place that I seem to go to once every 10 years. Would come back to have some more of this beer."
"This schwarzbier comes out of the tap a deep, opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head. Rich aroma is primarily of roast, smoky malt. Strongly smoky flavor has coffee, nutty and caramel hints. Texture is smooth and has a good, strong tingle to it."
"Rather light bodied and easily drinkable. Crisply - maybe slightly overly - carbonated, becoming creamy only after its been swirled around the mouth a bit."
"T&M - Bold, dark roasted malts up front with sweetness in the background. Not much carbonation here. Somewhat thin in the mouthfeel and the taste leaves something to be desired. I wish there was more depth here."
"Poured dark mahogany brown (almost black), with a thick creamy tan head. Foam lasted almost the whole pint, and left nice looking lace. Toasted malt smell, a touch of smokiness. Flavor of smoky toasted grain, good balance between sweetness and hop finish. Dry and clean mouthfeel. One of the better schwarz'z I have tried."

"I enjoyed this Shwarzbier and felt it was pretty smooth. It was a nice beer to sip while watching a football game after my meal. Recommended. One of their year round choices."
"The fifth in the line of the 6x Sampler at the Rockville restaurant. This is the one I went to try and, while it was good, there were a couple of other pleasant surprises in the sampler that were strong competition for the Schwarz. The beer looked dark brown to black in the glass, with brown and ruby highlights--like a real syrupy Coke. Slight head retention with some bubbles visible on the sides. As with most craft-brewed Schwarzbiers I've tried lately, the smell was more ""stout"" than ""dunkel"" and, while perhaps not on par with the best Germans of the style, extremly fresh tasting and enjoyable. Nice roasted malt in the flavor... and that's about it. Nothing particularly complex, but extremely tasty and enjoable. Another one that would go down easily."
"Draught @ Washington, DC location: This one pours an opaque brown color. There was a tight, off-white head on it that didn't last too long but left some lacing. There were some roasted and caramel malts to the nose. It also had some earthy hop notes. The taste was along similar lines to the aroma, and was nicely balanced. Some roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, but no real sweetness. Earthiness and a touch of biscuit also. Perhaps a little nutty also. Nice."
"A surprisingly good one, enjoyed at the Washington DC outlet. A bit of carbonation, and chocolate malt. Light browncolour with a white head. Creamy, drying finish. Abit of sourness. It all worked and was very drinkable, despite having a few other beers that day, though none that burned the palate. Perhaps Jason tinkered it well, his last day cheers!"
"The mouth could be beefed-up a bit, but this is an easy drinker. Would be an easy beer to use as a crossover."
"But is it any good or not? It's a very fine beer, but I find the malt character takes on a clean, caramel flavor that chases it through to the finish. This leaves the beer a little sweet and less dry than classic German versions. The added sweetness allows the beer to sit heavy on the toung and coats the palate with the muted carbonation. Otherwise, great head formation and retention with a nice roasted aroma / flavor, and a powdery sensation in the drinkability. Similar to dry stouts, but cleaner (due to lagering) and lighter."
"I was served this beer from the tap & it was poured into a Nonic. It's very dark brown with a thick, dark beige head. It smells of toasy malts, smokey. The taste is roasted malts with scalded coffee & a hint of wheat. Not much aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little strange--a little watery without much carbonation. Overall, a fairly drinkable beer that is just a bit on the heavy side."
"D - Light bodied, low ABV, and some nice flavor make for a pretty sessionable schwarzbier."
"D- I do enjoy this style of beer and this was a pretty watered down version. It tasted like a very light beer that had just a bit of black patent malt dipped in it. No much depth of flavor or interesting qualities."
"Pours a nice black color with a slightly off-white finger of head that dissolves fairly quickly. No real lacing, but not a bad looking beer, with some nice brown highlights. Nose is mild roasted malt, some smokiness and a hint of coffee. Very light hops. Taste is likewise, fairly mild, but good if you focused your energies; smoky malt. Feel is medium to thin bodied, but not bad for the style. Overall, not a bad beer, and a good intro to the shwarzbier style."
"A brownish body with small head and little lacings. Dense beer that has a slight coffeesque smell but is full-bodied and not only has a malty taste, but reminded me of an oatmeal stout. This went down extremely smooth and was a tad milky/sweet. This is a good beer and up there with the Hefe as the ones to get at this GB."
"D - Good, but you wouldn't want too many of these. This could be a meal replacement. Good big old black lager from Gordon Biersch."
"Roasty coffee smells from a dark brown/black pour, with some malty drying tastes. Light bodied, like all schwarzbiers despite the roasty character and isn't very full bodied I thought. This is more a knock against the style than the particular beer though, and it is decent for a schwarzbier. Not my favorite, but drinkable."
"Poured into regular pint glass by informed waitress. Jet black in color with a half a finger of head, laces remaining throughout. Coffee aroma from the roasting but not overpowering. Quite smooth in the delivery to bely the imposing color, My first schwarzbeir, so i likened it to a sweet porter. An excellent batch and style in general."
"It had a big, thick light-brown head upon arrival. The beer itself was a deep, deep-brown color with NE-quality clarity when held up to the light. The nose had a pleasant charcoal smokiness. The mouthfeel was thin-to medium with a lightly smoky taste on the palate. The finish had a lingering smokiness, but not necessarily a dry one, as suggested by the menu. As it warmed, I even got a black pepper bite on the finish."
"Had this one again today but never rated it before. Poured a deep deep amber color, so dark it was brownish even. I was sitting in the sun so it could have cast a different color. Anywho, Came with a nice frothy head, good retention. taste was of some cholocloate, roasted malts and something else that I could pick out. Decent beer."
"D- Very drinkable, not the best dark beer they have, that would have to go to the winter bock, but defiantly worth a try and would not pass one up if it was offered to me. It is one of the better beers that the brew, just not the best one"
"D-I didn't love this beer but I could have another if I had to."
"The beer from the tap a deep brown to black with nice ruby highlights, the head a perfect two fingers, creamy tan in color, evaporates slowly, leaving a thick sheet of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose has a toasted grain aroma, sweet with hints of smoke, caramel, maybe a licorice like tone, mouthwatering. Front has a splendid toasted malt presence, sweet with a delectable hop spicy bite at the back. Finish pleasantly acidic, hops spicy and delightful, dry lingering aftertaste, a great representative to the style."
"Brown-black color with a reasonable head. Solid malts in the smell, most a caramel. Nice flavor with the nuttiness (the food not the personality) coming through and some caramel and a touch of chocolate. Again it's awesome to see lagers can have an awesome flavor profile. Mild hops. Medium body and medium-to light carbonation make this beer super-sessionable. But that's my bias. Keep this in mind: beers do-not have to be light, crisp, and hoppy to enjoy in the summer. I tried this in the July heat of Tempe as was very pleased and refreshed."
"I received a half-liter of pitch blackness. Some lighter orange hues showed up at the base of the glass when I held it up to the light, but otherwise this was a nice, dark beer. As served to me there was little head on it, but it did leave some lace on the glass as the beer receded. The aroma evoked a strong roasted coffee smell. I also got a smoky scent from this beer as well. Very appetising scent. It tasted crisp, clean, and dry. Notes of roasted malt showed up prominently, as did coffee and baker's chocolate flavors. Some dark fruit flavors as well, but I had a hard time placing them. The mouthfeel was weak; watery, but with a dry finish. I would have liked some more body in this department; this beer deserved it. Still, it was an enjoyable, highly drinkable beer, especially if you can get past the watery mouthfeel. Give it a try if you find yourself in a GB one day. Their beers aren't great, but this one passes muster."
"This Schwarzbier poured a very dark, nearly opaque, brown-black color with creamy, tan foam that slowly settled. The smell was very modest with a note of malt. The taste was mildly roasted malty with mild cocoa and chocolate notes and even a hint of ""malted milk"" and coffee. The hoppiness was modest. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The finish was dry with the moderate hoppiness lingering. This was a good, drinkable Schwarzbier."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this and is a bit more flavorful than the standard golden export offering from GB. Defintely worth having if on tap."
"I found this to be an interesting schwarzbier... it lacked the underlying hoppiness I'm used to, but made up for it with an interesting malt character. It was fresh, which helped out, and tasted a little bit like my most recent homebrew (insert positive bias here). The mouthfeel was somewhat weak... it fit the profile of a schwarzbier, but lacked a little kick that I'm used to. It was, however, incredibly drinkable, and I would stick to this beer if I return again to the Tempe, Gordon Biersch. It was a pretty standard color, with the head being very nice, and longer lasting than most lagers I've had. Overall it's an impressive attempt, but not amazing."
"Gordon Biersch has a good atmosphere and brews some tasty beers on the premises. I had a couple of pints of the Schwarzbier. with dinner. Good appearance, dark, dense color...no light getting through. Good size head that slowly dissipates to a solid ring around the glass. Average lacing. Taste was good, malty, smoky, slightly bitter but much more subtle and light than a porter or stout. This is a beer that could be sipped or guzzled with equal enjoyment. Nice rich mouthfeel for this style. This is a highly drinkable beer. I look forward to going back there and trying their other beers."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant before the BCS National Championship game in Glendale, AZ (Go Gators)! This beer is dark black in color with a finger light tan colored head. The aroma features dark roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is much like the nose with a lot of roasted malts and a burnt chocolate flavor as well. Light-medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, this was a solid brew that I really enjoyed."
"Deep mahogany with ruby highlights and topped with a cap of small bark brown bubbles. Eventually the head disappeared completely leaving no lacing or trace of its existence. Aromas of gentle spicy hops, dark berries, and long-toasted bread. The lightly spicy hops cross the palate first, followed by a slightly sweet and nutty malt flavor that finishes with more hop spiciness. Medium-light body with a smooth, but crisp mouthfeel. The roastiness stands out during the middle, but it is the hops that fill out the finish. Not overpowering in any one area and easily drinkable. The low alcohol makes for a good session beer."
"The beer is dark but a tad watery looking for this style. the head is a foamy light brown from too much carbonation. Very little aroma, a tad burnt smelling. The taste is dominated by stale coffee but very little bittnerness. It's thin and uninteresting in the mouth. I'm glad to see people try this style, which I like, but this is mediocre."
"On tap at DC location. Color is a cola-like dark brown. Supports a thin off-white head with fairly good durability. No lacing. A restrained aroma of roasted malt, toffee and some chocolate. Mouthfeel was light and spritzy with a slightly watery texture in the finish. Clean, uncomplicated and mildly sweet flavors of dark roasted malt, burnt toast, chocolate, mocha and caramel. Shows a nice balance between the sweeter malts and more bitter, acidic roasted malt contributions. A simple and refreshing beer which is a nice rendidtion of the style."
"In a GB Becker, the pour forms a massice rocky two finger head, which falls slowly to a glass ring. Very nice black-ruby when backlit. The nose is mildly caramel sweet, and roasty. Taste is a bit overly roasty, not much lager character. Mouthfeel is smooth, with medium carbonation. A good, mild drinker."
"This beer is a very deep brown, almost black in color. Very thin white head disappears very quickly. Some roasty and toffe-like aromas. Dark malt, slightly roasty, and a hint of chocolate flavor combines with some subtle earthy hop flavor. Not a sweet as I would want. Light body, with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Not a bad exmple."
"Presented as a deep brown beer with tannish puffy head. Smell is a nice combination of roasted malt and toffee. Taste adds to the toasty flavor with caramel and a bit of sweet coffee. Nice refreshing beer with a pleasant feeling at the finish. Very easy to drink. Could be a good session beer."
"Very enjoyable. Good black bier with slight leaning munich dunkles, but tasty just the same!"
"Another fine beverage sampled at the Washington DC location. The pour was a beautiful deep ruby to brown with the ruby highlight glowing around the edges. The pour was capped with a medium off white head and carried nice lace on the glass. Carbonation was medium to low. Nose and flavor were big and malty as designed the finish carried out a vinious tasting and was wrapped up in a short quick aftertaste. Very nice beer."
"Very nice and one of GB's better beers that I have not seen at their other locations. A shame since this is my favorite regular beer of theirs."
"Schwarzbier is almost black in color with a solid, creamy head. The smell is of dark roasted malts with a notable coffee aroma. The taste is very similar to the aroma, dark roasted malts provide chocolate and coffee flavors. Schwarzbier is very rich and flavorful, but not as heavy as it's color and taste would seem to indicate. This was the best beer of the three beers that I was able to sample at this GB. I would come back for this brew alone."
"Smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes the same, light carbonation and smooth creamy texture, washed my heavy cake down better than milk. More sweet than bitter. I consider this schwarzbier superior to my last bottle of Köstritzer."
