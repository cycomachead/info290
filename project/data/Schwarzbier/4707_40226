Smells of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of chocolates and sulfur. Faint earthy hops try to provide balance but can't muster the strength to battle the maltiness of this brew. The flavor follows the aroma with sugary malt and a hint of chocolate and some miner off flavors. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet crisp mouthfeel. Decent beer, but really nothing special. Thanks for the state tick, but not a great beer for the style.","johnnnniee","Oct 26, 2012"

3.41,-4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is kind of like a crisper, more refreshing brown ale. By that I mean it's lightly bitter, medium bodied, and really drinkable. Only instead of going for nodes of nuts and biscuit, this tries to be like a really easy drinking, lagered version of a stout. In that respect it succeeds pretty well.","mynie","May 15, 2011"
2.96,-17.1,3,2,3.5,3,3,"Enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, ok in a standard pint glass. Pours a thick dark brown color with no head at all. Aroma is very week with smoke and malt characteristics. The taste is very smokey and malty, with some hints of chocolate and coffe. The mouthfeel is fairly empty an watery. Overall worth a try because it's cheap.","csiewert","Dec 31, 2010"
3.63,1.7,4,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"12 ounce stubby bottle. The label classifies this as a black lager, and the pour doesn’t disappoint. The color is a dark brown bordering on black, with a slight head that is more foamy than it is creamy. Head retention is better than what I’ve seen in other Choc beers. Likewise the aroma is strong, with some notes of coffee – specifically dark and earthy like coffee grounds. Some chocolate is there but it’s a supporting note and not the main focus. The first taste reveals a charbroiled meat, caramelized steak like afterfinish. One thing I can say for the Choc beers: The flavor profiles are certainly unique. Further exploration of the taste profile yields a nice chocolate note that really shines at the end of the taste. Toasted malt is present throughout. My only complaint is that I’d like this beer to be more chewy, as the relatively thin body sort of washes away under the complex flavor profile. The carbonation seems to be a little heavy handed as well. This is a beer that I think could benefit from a bit more of an aggressive streak, as the flavors would work great in a robust Baltic Porter or Russian Imperial Stout. Here however, they all come rushing out in the beginning but are washed away much too quickly.","eclaycamp","Dec 14, 2010"

Nose was heavy with a toasted chocolate and caramel, with a hint of coffee. Drink was surprisingly smooth, and unlike other schwarzbiers I have tried, the roast was not overpowering, but well proportioned with the other flavors.

Sometimes you just need to leave the complexities of the world behind, thus the Miner Mishap was a no-brainer for me today. A very hard pour results in virtually no head, but after a second a little fiz rises to the top, through the middle of the dark brown brew. Smells of roasted nuts, toasted malts and maybe a few hops hiding deep in the shadows. The taste of the malts is a bit sweeter than the aroma, and there are some very subtle caramel notes as well as some hops and maybe some coffee beans. This fit the bill for what I was looking for. And while it's could use a bit more in the taste department, I'm not complaining, and am going to have a few to take the edge off the day.","stephens101","Dec 26, 2008"

This beer should probably be drunk a little warmer than most to allow the full flavor to come through. A tasty brew but I don't care much for the finish.

Flavor is a mild blend of caramel malt and black malt. Hints of dark chocolate are evident and a good dose of noble hops to balance the malt. Not very sweet and somewhat sharp tasting. Finishes malty with a lingering roast and vanilla character. It is dead on for the style as far as the yeast contribution to the flavor--that is to say there are no esters to speak of due to the lager yeast fermentation. As for the malt flavors it edges into dark brown ale/porter territory such as Turbodog. I've had the homebrew version of this when I lived in OK and this is just as good as that one if memory serves me.","EagleTalon","Jul 10, 2008"

3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a snifter. Miner Mishap pours a cloudy mahogany with a slightly off-white head. Decent head retention and pretty nice lacing for the style. Very faint aromas of cabbage at first, some white pepper, actually I am picking up some vinegar as well, but these aromas are not powerful. Very pleasant sour flavors. Slight hints of roasted malts. The finish has some cabbage and metallic flavors. Mouthfeel is a little thick, but the beer is crisp. Carbonation level is a little high for the style. Overall, Miner Mishap is not bad, but schwarzbier are not my style. I feel the beer could improve on certain points, but it is a good representation of the style.","paulthebeerguru","Feb 04, 2008"
3.66,2.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink to drink for a while when you're in the mood for a Schwarzbier.","TheManiacalOne","Dec 24, 2007"
4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Would purchase again. This beer has first-sip likeability if you're in the mood for sweet. Very easy to drink and a good transition beer to the darker side.","TYE","Dec 24, 2007"
3.75,5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark black with a quick fading tan coarse head. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, roastedness, and some hops. Taste is tight and somewhat complex. Initially presents with a dark silky roastedness with some more chocolatiness that transitions quickly to tingly, spicy hop notes. The finish lingers for a bit. A good Schwarzbier and a nice offering from Choc. Definitely worth checking out.","timbro81","Beers"
3.85,7.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a pitch black, with a medium tan head. Smells of chocolate and toasty malt. Tastes like dark chocolate, and roasted malts. A nice kick from the bittering hops. Mouthfeel is full, slightly high carbonation levels. Quite drinkable, this would make a good session beer.","tronester","0"
