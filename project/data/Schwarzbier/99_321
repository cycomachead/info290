There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Black Forest has a nice balance to it. The sweetness in this brew is just right. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Matt Brewing company did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving this 4.5 out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jul 27, 2014"

Very light despite that heavy look. Wish it had a bit more malt or stout notes. A little too light for a dark beer. 3.0 out of 5. Okay. Not as good as I remember it.

The body is medium, and the aftertaste, relatively short, leaves us with a delicious and subtle hop taste. Great dark Lager.","HabiMendes","Feb 23, 2013"

Flavors are dark fruit sweet, with bits of currant and black cherry, and a heavy dose of dark chocolate and coffee on the tail. Very interesting blend of flavors.

What remains is fruityness and a bit of hop bitterness and floral hop flavor. Kind of nice, but not really that special. The mouthfeel was nice and light which is nice and refreshing.

Aroma consists of something like earthy hay or dead grass (not a negative comment), toasted malts, burnt caramel, a little bit of mocha, and cashews. Tasting this is just splendid: lightly toasted malts (not roasted), molasses, and slight bittering hops. This is medium-bodied and only stings the palate a little bit. The beer is gentle in complexity. This beer is NOT good when taken right out of the fridge. I'm not sure what temperature everyone else is reviewing at, but make SURE this beer is served on the warmer side...even at 5.5%. Otherwise, you will not taste any of the aforementioned flavors.

Nose is fairly light but suggests cocoa and a hint of lactose.

The liquid is a dark brown and has lots of rising and clinging carbonation bubbles. If I didn't know better, I'd say this looks like a glass of Coke. The aroma has some sweet malts and piney hops. The combination reminds me of black licorice. The flavor is tasty. It has a mild sweetness, some wheat, and a good bitter character in the finish. I don't like black licorice or black jelly beans, but this beer seems to have the good aspects of those candies. It has a medium body, but little coating; it ends up feeling a bit watery. The carbonation level is a bit above average. There aren't any major lingering flavors. Each sip goes down well, and the taste is very good, but there's something that makes me think I wouldn't drink too many of these. I obtained this beer through a Saranac mix pack.

Lacing is light and almost non-existent. Smells of roasted malts and some bread-like smell. Not a very strong smell at all but it is not a very bad smell either. Tastes of roasted malts, a decent hop presence and maybe some fruit (raisin, citrus). Not the most complex taste but a pretty good one overall, I like the dark malts balancing with the good hop presence. Mouthfeel is definitely light as called for by the style, carbonation is slightly a bit overkill (stings the tongue a bit) and the beer is pretty smooth, I did however get a TINY bit of alcohol coming through towards the end. Drinkability is good, the taste seems like it would be fine and no off flavors would kill the beer in the long run, the light bottle enables me to drink several of these and the price tag is worth it for this product, cool.","cbutova","Sep 17, 2009"

Somewhat aqueous but very sprite, more like a refreshing summer beer. There is a subtle nut background I think. Pretty simple stuff and nothing special at all. It's pretty drinkable other than I just would't be interested in having more than one if there were any kind of choices available.

The taste also lacked some punches, but it had a good bitter taste. One thing this drink does have going for it is its above average carbonation which makes it really crisp and refreshing.

The mouthfeel is pretty slight, maybe a little on the refreshing watery side. The aftertaste is slight, just a tinge of hoppiness on the back end, but you have to look for it.

It slowly dissipates to a solid surface layer; this looks appealing! On my nose, I can get the hint of some dry, and dark roasted malt, along with some chocolate and sweet toffee. Fairly sweet smelling with some floral hops aroma also balancing it out a bit. Sipping reveals a strong brown malt flavor, which lacks the chocolate I sensed when smelling which is a little disappointing, but the hops quickly swoop into balance out the toffee sweetness and instead leaves a drying floral hops flavor in my mouth by the swallow. A bitter flavor remains in my mouth between sips; interesting, but not quite what I expected (I expected maybe just a bit more roast) but this suits the style I guess. Carbonation hits the sides of my tongue right away as I sip it. The body is relatively light, and the finish is rather dry for such a low alcohol brew. I have a quart, and I plan on drinking it. A nice little winter brew that isn't too warming, but actually is better for drinking than being a winter sipper. Cheers!","Fish113d","Jan 25, 2007"

The nose is nice, a good mix of roasted malt and a bit of fruit, somewhat sweet with a little bite to it. The flavor and mouthfeel aren't what you'd expect given the apperance and aroma of the brew, but is consistent with the Schwarzbier style. It's got the roasted malt and caramel and coffee you'd expect, but not as intensely flavorful as most stouts and certainly no where near as thick as one. Think of it as an easy drinking stout.

Mild in hops but not menacingly sweet either, a bit of spice and minimal bittering. The carbonation isn't overpowering, but it does burn the tounge--not exactly smooth carbonation. The beer is medium-light in body. I wouldnt mind this beer on tap. There isn't anything particularly bad about this beer, and it's not dissapearing-flavored macro swill.

Fruity taste, again with cherry and plum and some roasted malt but not as much as you would think for a beer this dark. Nice roasted bitterness. Hops are detectable but not predominate.

The body was a very dark amber color, almost black when you looked at it a certain way. The smell was alright, just nothing was too overbearing, so it all worked together smoothly. There were hints of hops, some lightly roasted malts, some faint spices, and some darker fruits. The taste was a little bit better. Again, everything worked together well, but the caramel malts were evident, as well as the little hop finish it had. Very creamy beer, coated the mouth nicely. I was expecting something a little heavier, but instead I got a dark beer that was pretty light and easy to drink.

We would be so excited when that happened and would camp out at either Duffs or Maxfields up in Potsdam. Well it has been many moons since then, but this is still one of my favorite brews for a number of reasons, the memories, the price and that it is a good brew. Pours to a dark brown color with a tan head that has good retention and leaves some lacing down the sides of the glass. The aromas of dark malts lead to chocolate and coffee scents along with some noticeable hops. The taste is very good; malt dominates up front highlighting chocolate, coffee and nuttiness flavors. Also notice a hop sense in my mouth even after I am done with the sip, not over powering at all but it is there in the background. A fantastic brew and one that will always remain one of my favorites!","Stimack","Nov 09, 2005"

The aroma is of malt and raisins, deep and earthy, though maybe a touch of citrus develops as it breathes. The taste is similar- not much up front, mostly raisin and dark malt in the middle and end, and slight piney hops appearing in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but somewhat dry, adequate carbonation (though it could handle more). By this time the head is gone but thick lacing remains. This is a narrow beer with both the scent and taste consisting entirely of dark earthy bitter tones at the back of the tongue, just a little smoky malt on the middle of the tongue, and absolutely nothing up front. In my opinion though it is quite good and drinkable, I would want to switch to something more well-rounded after one or maybe two of these at most. A good beer to try, but have something else around as well.","BeerNinja007","Mar 24, 2005"

Pours a very dark almost black color with some red showing through, looks thin though. Smell is fairly subdued, a little malty and grassy. Taste leaves a lot to be desired, it's pretty one dimensional, and at that it's not really even that impressive. Malty, sweet and caramely, a tiny bit of hops. Way too watery and none of the complexities I look for in a beer of this style. It's kind of a little syrupy, like a Coke or something. Not really worth it, but I guess it's a relatively cheap fallback beer.","twelvsies","Mar 14, 2005"

Taste is actually pretty good on this one. Initially a bit of toasted malts coming through and a slight bitter finish. The flavor is very crisp.

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Deep ruby brown almost black if not held up to the light, forms a very nice mountainous tan chunky head leaves behind thick coating of lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma: Delicate toasted malts paired with very nice herbal German Hallertau hops in there they definitely arise in the aroma. Taste: Perfect blend of sweetness from the dark roasted and caramel malts kicks up the hop flavor very much so authentic tasting just tasted a Schwarzbier from the subsidary of Kulmbacher yesterday and this is even more drinkable and more favorfully hopped. Mouthfeel: Light to medium body in the spectrum but has a nice soft carbonation not overcabonated at all. Drinkability: Best of the bunch from Saranac I definitely am going to pick up a sixer while supplies last down the street at the liquor store good brew to have on hand.","WVbeergeek","Dec 09, 2003"

Mouthfeel is pleasantly well balanced. Taste is complex, with hints of rye bread, chocolate malt, and currants. A likeable speciman here.

Its heavy on roasted and gets its bitterness from black patent instead of hops, or so it seems. Finishes clean but then a tart feeling sneaks in at the end. Sort of a dark wheat, but has charecteristics that keep it out of that class too. A tough beer to judge, an easy beer to drink.","UncleFrank","Nov 26, 2003"
3.71,-0.3,4,3,4,2.5,4.5,"Dark clear chestnut hue. Dogged, pitted dark beige head leaves muddled lace. The aroma is a combination of dry baker's chocolate, subtle carob and dark lovibond caramel malt with a roasted tinge. Trace herbal hop twang. Toasty Munich malt sweetness upfront in flavor yields to rounded notes of dark chocolate and smooth, perhaps dehusked chocolate malt. Surprisingly assertive roasted grain bitterness lends a refreshing, carbonaceous dryness. Hop bitterness is appropriately mild, and adequates tapers residual sweetness. Understated herbaceous hop flavor darts in late along with hints of cola like caramel. Unfortunately thin in overall body like most of Saranac's brews, with a lanky, over attenuated mouthfeel. Finishes with wisps of salty, grainy toast, but otherwise clean and abruptly. Quite an enjoyable and unique take on the style, with an agreeably pronounced roasted grain presence. If Saranac fermented this with their ale yeast, it would surpass their Stout in all respects. Quaffable, indeed.","marc77","Nov 25, 2003"

The roasted malt was most prevelent with a slight hint of bitterness. Somewhat thin bodied and slighlty crisp on the tongue. The roasted malt lasts into the aftertaste for a short time.

I don't know if I would go running out to buy more when there are so many better beers to choose from, but that is not to say that this is a bad beer. Just not one that sticks in my mind.

3.98,7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"As a rule, I enjoy most of Saranac's output as session brews and at parties where economy comes into play. This one is my favorite of them all, since it is one of the darkest and heartiest that they brew. All chocolate malt and roasted grain, with a nice hop balance that leaves minimal bitter aftertaste. The finish is relatively dry with a little too much carbonation for the style. I would prefer it to be a little smoother. Overall, one of the best you can try from the Matt Brewing Co.'s line of beers.","steelreign","Aug 28, 2003"

Here goes: while not overly intricate in its taste, this was a refreshing and pleasant brew, highly carbonated with lots of gentle sweetness. The pour is dark, almost black (no duh; it's a black beer), and the head, though thin, is a nice contrast. The smell is roasty malt, tinted with ginger. The taste is similar. On the label, they advertise ""caramel malt sweetness, medium body..."" I'd say truth in advertising. And I'd have another.","longpondbeerman","Jul 01, 2003"

Little balance here and a bit thin and watery. Surprising taste for the look. You expect lots of smoky flavors but that's not what this is about. It's smooth, sweet, and all about malt.

3.48,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Strange pick for Matt Brewing to mass produce (schwarzbier). It was just about a black color with a creamy tan head that stuck around nicely. Also had good german-style natural carbonation rolls on the tilt. The nose was of roasted wheat, some caramel malt. Taste was a quiet dark malt, roasted wheat, and a slight fruit from the hops taste. Had a thin body and character, yet a nice dryness during the finish though it fades moderately fast. Almost an oily mouthfeel with a strange feeling cloy after the finish, like an acid burn. A good Saranac beer? It may have been if they hadnt filtered it, and gone through with the heavy elements of it.","nomad","Apr 13, 2003"

Medium body to the beer though the finish starts out unsatisfyingly light, almost watery. Things improve as the beer warms, however, with a nice toasty aftertaste developing to compensate somewhat for the thin body. Flavor begins with a strong taste of caramel malt and a mild (too mild, IMHO) roastiness. Hop flavor is understated.

Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation level and lightly creamy mouthfeel. The malt flavor is apparent up front, mainly of a very nice, gently sweet caramel backed by bittersweet chocolate. As it crosses the palate a distinct, grassy hop flavor comes forth. A solid bitterness that never oversteps its bounds balances the palate before receeding into a lightly dry finish with some residual chocolate-like notes. An exceptionally well done beer that deserves more attention.","NeroFiddled","Aug 22, 2002"
