4.12,9.6,4.5,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Great look with a huge fluffy head that clings to the glass and has great retention. Smokey and sweet malt with earthy hops and a light lingering bitterness with some charred wood and bittersweet chocolate lingering. Crisp feel and very smooth With a drying finish. Terrific flavor for such a light beer. Nicely done and cool to see it is organically made as there are not many options in the category.","jera1350","Saturday at 07:44 PM"

4.23,12.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours pitch black with a lingering head. Smell is of wonderfully charred malts. Taste is full of roasted malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Hops provide just enough bitterness. Feel is absolutely velvety smooth. Light and very easy to drink. Tons of flavor for 4% ABV. One of the best black lagers currently out there IMO.","AtomicHippo","Mar 23, 2015"
4.54,20.7,5,4.75,4.75,3,4.5,"Very good. Appearance is a thick light tan, long lasting head with lots of lace and an almost opaque, but clear black brown color. Aroma is roast up front then dark leather, meat, coffee, malt. cocoa. Flavor's like nose, dryish at first, then with the other qualities including tang, there's a bit of sweet in the finish. Body is good, tho perhaps a bit thin. Very quaff-able. I'd like to have another right away.","drpimento","Mar 22, 2015"
3.93,4.5,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,4,"3/19/15 (Can) - Dark black pour, roasted malt and coffee scents were very strong and desirable. Taste was even better, excellent roasted malt and chocolate. Very smooth to drink, minimal carbonation, light in both texture and ABV. Nice paring with desert. Overall very good offering!","dukeandduke","Mar 20, 2015"

Also, I found the roasty charcoal aspect to be a bit much, which negatively affects the drinkability/ sessionability for me. Still, I respect what Uinta has done with this: it seems like a no-brainer session beer for a porter/stout lover.","Redneckwine","Sep 14, 2014"

3.85,2.4,4.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Poured on tap at the brass tap in Tallahassee into a pint glass. Pours jet black with extremely low clarity, when held up to the light you get slight reddish brown flecks on the side but still holds an extremely dark complexion. The thick tightly woven desert sand colored microbubble head sits firmly on top of the beer holding very firmly for a number of minutes. It was about half an inch at the pour and has deflated down to a quarter and still holding strong. As the beer goes down it leaves large sheets of webby lace. This is an amazing looking beer. Aroma consists of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee , sweet fresh bread , milk chocolate and roasted malt. Lots going on here and all of it very pleasing. The aroma isn't overpowering but complex and enjoyable, I find myself smelling it over and over looking for new subtleties. Taste is sweet on pallet entry with a touch of citrus that quickly fades directly into roasted notes, next comes dark chocolate which leads to a finish of sweet milk chocolate and finally a touch of dry roasted flavors and a touch of hop bitterness. All and all a good flavor profile. Some may find this a bit too bitter or astringent but this would be a delight for black coffee drinkers and anyone who drinks IPA's would most likely never notice its bitterness level. I wish there was a little more oomph from the malt here but that's nitpicking as I feel the drink ability is higher this way, especially if consumed by the liter. The mouthfeel is good its almost perfectly full but it does have a little fizz to it. I feel this keeps the beer interesting where the flavors fall flat a bit but I would prefer a beer that has both full flavor and a full mouthfeel. All and all a great beer. Drinkability is high and flavor is complex and tame at the same time. I cant decide if I want more out of it or less really but I will say its one of the best looking schwarzbiers I have ever seen. Looking forward to trying more options from these guys, lots of good stuff coming from Utah it seems.","Fieldzy27","Jul 28, 2014"

Aroma is crisp, showing itself as a lager, with a clean roastiness that gives off some coffee and dark chocolate components, and a little bready. Flavor lacks the punch of the aroma a bit but definitely grew on me the more I drank it; sharp roastiness that is more coffee grind than chocolatey, a touch of some bread, and a nice charred and slightly bitter finish. Both the aroma and flavor comes out big time as it warms up. A crisp, light active mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice sessionable beer here. Uinta with a winner.","denver10","Sep 29, 2013"

The pour left a small amount of head, but definitely left lacing on my 16 oz non chilled pint glass. The taste does not overpower which is a big plus in my book. Black anything tends to have a very powerful taste which removes any chance for enjoyment. This tastes very smooth. Goes down like a nice chocolate malt. The mouth feel is sooth, and yet has nice texture. Reminds me of the mouth feel of a good British ale. It ha the same light carbonation too. The flavors are subtle but present. Rich coffee, malt, maybe a hint of hazelnut. All and all a must try.","GernBlanstonInLove","Sep 06, 2013"

Color was a deep, dark-brown with garnet highlights. Nose had a pleasant smokiness accompanying a dark chocolate semi-sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but approaching. The flavor was smoky, slightly bitter with an underlying chocolatiness. Finish was semi-dry and the flavor of chocolate lingered well pat the swallow.

A light, sparse, filmy, light tan surface coating of head. Aromas of toasted grains with a hint of sweet molasses and some dark, old world fruit sweetness. Flavors are sharp initially, with a date and fig sweetness quickly overridden by a bitter and roasty coffee character. The bitter and sweet work into a balance, with a touch of sharpness at the end of the palate. The sharp feel is amplified by the light body.

The flavor translates this interplay nicely, giving equal strength to the malt base and the complementary sweetness of the other included sugars. To this point no flavoring is explicitly overwhelmed, but the ultimate taste is a bit basic.

Nice balance and robustness of flavors. Fairly dry on the finish with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very nice schwarzbier. Very nice balanced and robust flavors for a 4% beer; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable stuff. If I could get this around here, this would definitely be a nice session beer choice.","superspak","Oct 02, 2012"

3.6,-4.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"this is a heavy duty beer for a lager. pours midnight black and dense as anything, with a one inch light brown head. the nose is roasty dark malts and bready yeast. It so far is much more of a porter than a black lager i think. the flavor is very robust. burnt malt dominates the mouth, while some bitterness rises u in the finish, more from the darkness of the malt then from the hops. mouthfeel is pretty heavy again for a lager, lots of body in this one, and good carbonation. a nice bitter roasted flavor is left in the mouth for awhile, which is nice this time of year. overall a good fall session beer. super low abv makes it an all day beer.","StonedTrippin","Sep 30, 2012"

The nose gives up lots of roast, chocolate powder, café au lait as well as a nice spine of herbal matter, no real fruitiness, same for broad hop based scents, there is some country style bread, barley and oats, leans heavily on malts for effect. Medium-bodied, acts like it is trying to develop some bitterness, light grassiness and pine then yields to all that roast and toast, coffee beans, dark chocolate, malted milk balls and sweet bread dough.

Maybe its because this is the first euro dark lager I've had, but I'm pleasantly surprised by this one.

3.5,-6.9,4,4,3,4,3.5,"Picked this up recently for $1.50 for a 120z bottle. Dark black with brown accents at the edges. Smells like burnt toast but in a good way as well as a honeyed cereal that I can't quite put my finger on, good smell. Taste is more like a standard black lager, a tiny bit of roasty malt, not nearly as good as the smell.","ArrogantB","Oct 21, 2011"
2.89,-23.1,4.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Overall it seems like the marketing males this beer more than the beer itself. Cute labeling, special bottle, and USDA Organic slapped on it make it stick out yet it yields something akin to Canadian made Guinness.","JoeAmerican77","Oct 16, 2011"

3.92,4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, with a nice fizzy tan head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, with some nice little chocolate notes. The taste is sweet, malty, very slight hop note, and caramel. Medium body, with a nice crisp feel. This is a pretty nice brew, one of the best Uinta makes at 4% ABV.","Wasatch","Oct 09, 2011"
