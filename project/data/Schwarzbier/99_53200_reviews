"O: Almost an amber lager like a vienna with a hand full of chocolate malt. The chocolate character is pretty light and would benefit from more support from complimenting roasted gain character."

"Ah, Saranac. It's been over a year since I had one after moving from Ohio. Good college memories of hanging out in the Adirondacks drinking these. This one survived the journey west and is at least a year and a half old, however it doesn't seem much worse for the wear. This was from the winter seasonal pack I believe, and in typical Saranac fashion, the seasonals are of much higher quality than the standard fare. Easy drinking, that stays true to a somewhat rare style. A bargain for less than a buck a beer."
"I don't want to go overboard, but I really like this beer. Moreover, it seems to be a perfect interpretation of its style. I'm not going to hold back on my rating."
"Reviewed on 2/15/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear dark brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, sweet malt, light nuttiness. Flavor of sweet malt, some residual sugars, some roasted malt. bready malt, light chocolate malt. Pretty decent, very drinkable."
"D-Drink this...hell yeah...all night long, along with the balance of the winter pack. These guys may not brew the best beers, but I never tire of their seasonal offerings. Kudos..."
"D - either black lagers aren't my thing or saranac isn't my thing. i'm guessing the latter"
"Aww, that li'l bear on the label is sooo cuuute! I'm not sure if I can actually call this brew ""cute", per se, but it's good-looking enough, I suppose. It pours a clear, surprisingly light garnet-brown with about a finger (more or less) of light ecru foam. The nose is roasted (the whole damn thing, I'm tellin' ya!), with some accent lighting from some chocolate, soil, and floral hops. So far, not all that different from the other schwarzes (save maybe that asshole from ""A Christmas Story""...). The taste doesn't deviate all that much, either, with notes of caramel, bitter dark chocolate, minor hoppy bitterness, and a tad bit o' greenery. The body is light, just an itsy-bitsy-teenie-weenie-yellow-polka-dotted bit lighter than it seems it should be, with active carbonation and a drier-than average finish. Still, this just kinda serves to make this brew a little easier to down than other schwarzes. Not bad, but not quite as good as that cute wittle bear..."
"Drinkability: A very acceptable Schwarzbier; balanced and easy to down."
"Dark ruby red with a creamy tan cap that leaves some decent looking lace on the glass. Mild cocoa, black and chocolatey malt in the nose. Nice, mild roasted malt flavors with a touch of wintergreen and honey. Light and easy drinking with mild carbonation. A decent black lager."
"Notes: Overall I would say that Saranac's Black Lager is very drinkable but there Black Forest is a much better interpretation of a German Schwarzbier."
"Some roasted grain...and even a bit a spice.."
"Poured into a pint glass with a reddish brown color that lets through a bit of light. Two finger tan head which dissipates quickly with a decent amount of lacing. Biscuity aroma with a chocolate malt flavor. This beer has a mellow hop profile and just a hint of alcohol is noticeable. The beer is very drinkable and a good example of a dark lager."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark copper color with barely a finger of tan head. The head quickly became a tiny collar that left thin, sliding lacing. The aroma was very grainy and full of dry chocolate malt, toasted malt, coffee and a little German malt. The flavors were an exact extrapolation of the aroma and distinctly European. But despite my repeated attempts to enjoy it I kept thinking it was sour, off or just plain awkward. I couldn't put my finger onit (it was trying so hard!) but it just kept letting me down. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. I give this one points for getting the style correct, but when I really boiled it all down it just wasn't enjoyable to drink!"
"Just not enjoyable for me."
"Overall it was fairly session able I have to admit. Not as full as I would have liked to have seen but I think it worked for what it was. Pretty solid."
"Drinkability was fair, the ABV cooperated, but the flavor was not up to snuff."
"D: Very drinkable. It's not my favorite from the 12 beers of winter but it'll do in a pinch."
"Being a big fan of the Black Forest by Saranac, i had high hopes for this one, and was not disappointed."
"The mouthfeel is nice and smooth. An easy drinking dark beer."
"Overall, a drinkable brew but this isn't something I would reach for over other schwarzbiers..."
"This beer poured a dark brown with some ruby highlights. The smell is some sweet lightly toasted malts with a bit of breadiness. The taste reflects the smell, with a tiny bit of hops in the finish. A surprisingly small amount of hops for Saranac. As a side effect, this beer ends up being quite a bit more drinkable than a lot of Saranac's offerings. Stylistically, this beer is almost exactly like their Black Forest, and in fact may be a rebranding of that one they've had forever."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with some red and browness about the edges as well. Has more than a finger of slightly tanned head that receeds sticking all about the glass. Aroma of hops and a bit of malt with a touch of some sulfur notes as well. Taste is a little roasty malt with some hops that leads in to a bitter crisp finish. Light feel and moderately carbed. All around not bad but again for a Schwarzbier it seems a little light in both the color and flavor. Still it is quite drinkable but it just seems like it is a little lacking in flavor."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a reasonably drinkable black ale for the winter months. For the most part, Saranac seems to make brews that both a novice and a veteran beer drinker can enjoy. No one will get offended by their brews, but also, there's nothing that truly makes them stand out, either."
"I got almost two fingers' worth of light-tan head with decent retention off of my pour. Color was a deep-brown with ruby highlights - very pretty. Nose was lightly cocoa-sweet. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a light cocoa sweetness on the tongue. The bottleneck mentioned ""dark chocolaty flavor", but I did not feel it was all that. Chocolate, sure, but not dark chocolate. Finish was slightly malty-sweet with that chocolate malt taste, but it probably would not satiate any self-respecting chocolate lover's dream. Still, for the price, not bad."
"D: Not bad, not great: Average. One could work through a few of these with no problem. Don't drink it too cold or you'll miss out on some subtle notes. Try with meatloaf and mashed potatoes."
"Full flavor with a reasonable after taste. Thumbs up, though I bought in a variety pack, I would purchase a full case for one of the up comming ""Beer Club"" events we have coming up."
"Poured out a 12 ounce bottle. Very dark almost black. Little or no head. Its a plainer and less flavor than the winter lager. Flavor is very disappointing compared to the color. It is very drinkable but nothing I would go out of my way for. I expected more of a malt or coco flavor. Or maybe some dark fruity flavors. If you are looking for something special look again. If you want a solid drinking every day brew, this is it."
"Drinks suprisingly well (for one) though very mild all-round. Had to dig for character though was the first beer I had for the day. A schwarz light...lite..."
"very drinkable. best to session with a few other Saranacs. actually, as simple as this seems, i'd love to oscillate on a do nothing evening with this and a nicely contrasting Saranac from this winter pack. nice to see some new entries into the lineup this season."
"Drinks easy, but not that great a Schwartz bier, could drink 2 or 3 before boredom sets in..."
"Drinkability: A bit disappointed with the bitter flavor on this one; verging on sour, it reminds me of nuts that have gone off"
"D: Decent drinkability, easy enough to consume in multiples but wonder what my tolerance would be. A decent session minded beer for the casual craft drinker."
"Drinkability: Smooth beer with deep contrast. The beer is enjoyable, though I would not actively seek it out."
"I'm a big fan of the style and this fits it very nicely. Well balanced and drinkable with some nice lightly roasted characteristics."
"Watered-down and lackluster are the best adjectives to describe this sampling experience... An American stab at a traditional German style that fails to capture the richness of this unique style of beer... Flavlors were sadly lacking... Nothing of the ""chocolate malt"" profile was evident... Nothing special..."
"M/D - A relatively easy drinker that is superior to lighter beers in the winter. Mouthfeel is quite light and doesn't leave a lot of taste in the mouth after you swallow."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Very dark amber, clear with reddish-orange highlights. Nice creamy head that dissolved into a thick film. Laces really well. Slight roasted aroma. Faintess hint of coffee bitterness. Very smooth in the mouth. Highly drinkable. Not the best black lager out there but pretty good."
"D- all in all a very drinkable brew, i think their black forest is a tad better tho"
"D - A good beer to drink when you get home from work or with some food, but too simple to be a sipper."
"Solid drinkability. Good flavors that work well together. A good example of the style, which I am a fan of."
"Last of the Saranac Twelve Beers of winter beers for me to try.Poured a nice dep chocolate and ruby tinge,a large fluffy almond colored head atop.A mix of German malt and spice in the nose,not strong but quite nice.Really not much to say about the flavors because there were not many,light iron and chocolate is all I really picked up.A little thin in the mouth made it even less drinkable in my mind.Eh,it started out ok but really seemed to fizzle out in the end."
"T- Tastes kind of like cotton (to be honest, not sure what this means, but it's in my notes). It's very, very dry and has a sour, malt taste to it."
"Very tasty beer (not sure I'd call it a Schwarzbier like the label says) that goes down smooth and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The Saranac 12 pack variety packs always provide a lot of enjoyment and this year's winter selection is on target again!"
"Quite drinkable, not incredibly complex. In other words, a very nice schwarzbier. If someone likes Guinness, this may be a nice beer to introduce them to the world of craft beer."
"Beating a dead horse here but this is no typical schwarzbier. Must be that it was brewed with a lager yeast, but beyodn that it drinks a bit more like a porter. It's not really true to style, but it is pretty good. This Winter pack is pretty solid so far."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: Average for the style. Nothing overly exciting, but nothing bad either. Glad to drink the two in the sampler, would not get a six."
"Pours a cola brown with ruby highlights a large beige khaki head forms and leaves evenly spread lacing around my imperial pint. Aroma is heavier on nuts and caramel than the dark roasts like coffee and chocolate edges. The Black Forest Schwarzbier used to own this, no where near as traditional as that offering. Flavor has a slight tart sourdough edge to it creamy milk chocolate notes with herbal hops and harsh carbonation, that sour twang throws me off a bit. Mouthfeel is a bit acrid with a harsh tartness to the finish, light bodied sturdy carbonation. Drinkability is solid okay darker brew bring back the old formula."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer at all."
"Taste was fine, nothing exceptional, but fine. Bit of roast, little bit of hops and a fairly thin mouthfeel. Not hoppy enough to be a schwarzbier. Just a light, slightly roasty but fairly neutral beer."
"D: While I haven't been able to find the Saranac Black Forest around here, I can't see how this can be much different from that beer. Overall very drinkable schwarzbier, that has made me want to try Black Forest."
"D: A nice crowd pleasing black lager."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle numbered 2879-0918. Sampled on November 13, 2009. The pour was noit as dark as I expected with a kind of ruby red-mahogany tone with little to no heaf and light lacing on the glass. The aroma had a bit of hops and nuts but it was somewhat muted and not very enticing. The mouthfeel was not too bad...a bit on the high side of medium body with a honey like smooth texture. I found the flavor to be more sour and bitter than chocolately and coffee-like as marketed. This beer had some likeable aspects to it but it did not live up to its marketing campaign. Nothing extraordinary here."
"Kinda weird, Saranac already has a black lager called 'black forest', looks and tastes mostly the same to me but whatever. Luckily, I love me some black lagers so although this may be a clone basically, it's still enjoyable. I do like the black forest better, due to its hint of caramel and more roastiness in there, but this black lager is still solid with some decent roastiness. Not as as good as the big moose ale but another solid Saranac winter mixer."
"Overall a decent lager, not as good as Black Forest. Easy to drink for sure."
"Overall- Started off weak but improved further into the pint."
"Saranac Black Lager is a dark and clear tawny brown beer with a thick, lumpy, light beige head that has oily bubbles; outstanding retention and lacing. It has a sharp, metallic aroma that's a touch cheesy. It's smooth and medium bodied with a pretty clean finish. It's pretty dry with a roasty note of coffee and a light, green bitterness. The aftertaste is metallic. Yeah, that metal taste really throws it off."
"Pours a cola like brown color with a small tight khaki colored head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of a toasted/slightly roasted malt, a bit of a caramel sweetness. Lacks that nice roasted malt kick. The taste is grainy and metallic. Not sure where this schwarzbier is going. Light roasted malt, grainy. Kind of a roasted macro though no rice/corn flavors. The feel is light with light carbonation. The feel hold ups, not watery, decent. I would say a below average schwarzbier. The roasted malt flavor is just not there."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a seasonal 12-pack at Shaw's in Windham, NH. Pours a dark brown to black copper crystal clear body with a half inch of short-lived khaki-colored head. Light aroma, hints of roast and caramel. Robust roasty flavor with some nuttiness and hints of earthy herbal hops toward the finish. Clean finish. Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. Tasty and drinkable for sure, probably one of the better beers from this variety pack. Good stuff!"
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted scent that's also a bit chocolatey. It seems as though they added chocolate malt only to a traditional lager. I guess it works. The taste is good. It's light, yet full of flavor. There is a dry, roasted character, but also a really sweet chocolate flavor in there as well. It's pretty damn quaffable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a better than average black lager. It seems as though the malt bill is quite simplistic, but who cares? It tastes good to me. Cheers!"
"They should stick to Black Forest as their flagship schwarzbier. This beer just reeks of desperation to fill up a holiday pack with ""new"" beers. The Winter Lager and even the Maple Porter offered more when compared to this."
"Overall not bad, but definitely the weakest in the winter pack which is otherwise quite good this year. If I were buying a six pack I would opt for Black Forest over this any day."
"Drinkability: It's interesting. I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's my first beer of this style, so I can't really say if it's typical of the style or not. That being said, it's a solid beer. Easy to drink, but nothing spectacular. I don't know if I would seek this one out again, but it was worth the try."
"D. This lager stars bitter and ends bitter. Not alot of sweetness to balance it out but a pretty decent brew none the less."
