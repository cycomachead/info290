"Dark dark dark crimson.Smell is roasted malts. Taste is very smoky, dry, slight bitterness. Has a little cigarette ash taste to it"
""
"overall:  this has all the elements, some of which are emphasized just right, but... the way it all adds up leaves me wanting something to be a little different.  I did it side by side with the Bauhaus Schwarz, which doesn't have as much smokiness and has more mellow chocolate, which I preferred a bit.  In the right mood, this is a solid choice and I don't turn it down."
"Overall, it's very good."

"Thanks, DaftPatrick, for the opportunity"
"Overall (4) : This beer is a double edged sword - great for easy-drinking beer nights, and great for rich and flavorful beer nights. It drinks like a lager, but tastes like a hand crafted ale. I highly recommend Schell's Chimney Sweep. Cheers!"

"Overall: Good dark beer, with a good bitterness but not overly strong in comparison to other styles."
"Chimney Sweep mucks about on the nose for sure, too soft and not smokey at all. The palate finally introduces the smokiness and roasted qualities, with a pleasant splash of sweetness. Again, the flavors could be more bold, but try to drink this and not enjoy it!"

"Overall - Pretty decent beer but was hoping for more smoke"

"I think this beer is misclassified; it should be a smoked beer. To me there's nothing ""subtle"" about the smokiness. Poured at a good temperature with a modest light tan head that soon settled to a large island, ring, and some lace. Color is a clear mahogany with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is smoke dominated and then malt and a bit of spice. Flavor's like nose plus has some tart. Fairly dry. Body is slightly thin, carbonation ok. Finish is like flavor, some change to medicinal, gradual taper, not really for me. Wish it had been a traditional schwarzbier"

"O -- Overall this is a great seasonal brew for the cold weather months. Not the typical spiced, strong seasonal, but very flavorful and robust to stand up to the winter air."
""
""
"Chimney Sweep is a good, medium bodied black lager and a beer definitely worthy of a try. It’s considered a seasonal brew, but it is bottled and sold over both the Fall and Winter so there is plenty of time to seek it out and give it sample. Give it a shot- you won’t be disappointed."
"Surprisingly good, I had a few Schell's beers that really weren't that good."
""

"O Great beer. Schell's puts out some top-notch stuff and this may be my favorite of their's. They stay true to the style but still find a way to expand and leave their personal mark."
""
""
"O - nice schwartzbeer. I have always liked this style and this is a pleasant american version. Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd be in no hurry to probably ever buy this again but , oh well ."
""
"Softly roasty aroma, sweet fruity plum, carob or cocoa. Dry taste, less sweet than the aroma lets on, though there is a slight amount. Dry cocoa, light unsweetened chocolate, dried dark fruit. Light and drinkable, though not without substantial flavor. Drinks like a nice porter more than a schwarzbier, and that's a good thing."
""
""
"It's near black with some nut brown hues below a fine creamy toasted sheet. Smells nice and roasty with soil, char, toast, some prunes and cocoa. Flavor follows suit with some nice roasted malts, dry soil, some hints of cocoa and leather - a really nice beer. Nice light body with a crispy carbonation and a wet finish (surprisingly). I like this beer quite a bit."
""
"dark brown amber, soapy khaki head. smell is light and grainy. taste starts light and grainy, with a smooth roasted malt kick at the finish. vanilla, cocoa beans, and charred wood."
""
""
"The body is medium-light in weight, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a surprisingly full, foamy, smooth, and creamy mouthfeel. Closes semi-dry with a bit of astringency from the dark malts and hops used."
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty good. It's a pretty good Schwarzbier, but the addition of the smoke makes me really enjoy it!"
"Great beer. Easy to drink. I love the smoke!"
"O: It's a good black lager, nice balance, not to smokey for my taste, would go great with a burger or brat. It's warm smokey, clean and dry. The mouth could be a little more for me and the flavor isn't so bold. But it's another solid well crafted beer from Schell's."
""
"Mmmm, mmm, good beer and you can drink it."
""
"O: This is a perfect example of what Schell's is good at; making incredible lager beers that drink like ales. If you've never tried Schell's, this is an GREAT place to start."
"Not a fan of liquid smoke. A rare Schell's miss for me. Not a good beer."
"Enjoying how this beer packs a dense load of flavors without being a huge, highly alcoholic imperial. A great beer in a style lacking for great, widely available options in the U.S. This is up there with Black Bavarian."
"Overall it's not that great but an above average take on the style. Worth picking up for a cheap Schwarbier."
""
"This warms nicely too- the caramel flavors start to show through without any excess sweetness. Seems to hold some ale qualities, but clearly a lager, and an enjoyable one too."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: If it's offered as part of a variety six-pack or you can find one bottle it would be worth the purchase. However, I couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these in an evening. If you like smoked beers (and lagers) then this would be one to 'tick' for you. Would I drink it again? Doubtful."
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Probably."
"Overall - This was pretty good. The flavor is nice and balanced and it's easy to drink. The scent lead me off at first but the end result was a pleasant surprise."
"This pours a very dark brown color with a slight, light brown head. Some roasted malts in the aroma; otherwise it’s just a slight smoked scent. The flavor is quite bold with deep, rich malt flavors. Lots of bread tones with a hint of smoke in the flavor. Finishes with a chalky after taste. Pretty decent winter brew that if full of flavor and yet is easy to drink!"
""
"O: Fairly solid. Decent drinkability. I'm a little bummed this replaced Schell's Stout though. Looking forward to see what they replace this with once Spring roles around since this is their extended winter seasonal."
"O - This is a very nice schwarzbier. Another good beer from August Schell in a style that most overlook."
""
""
"overall i'm yet again impressed by another new offering from Schell's. definitely recommended. a great winter drinker here."
"O-This is a really nice beer. i enjoyed it the first time I had it and am enjoying it again as I review...relatively unique in the U.S. beer landscape these days..."

"O-Other than the smokiness, which is rather subdued this is kinda a disappointment from Schell's. I had there schwarzbier a few years ago at a pub and remember it being a bit better than this."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with ruby hues along the edges of the glass. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, roasted malt, toast, smoke, and hints of milk chocolate. There is a lot going on in the aroma of this beer, and the taste is no exception to that. There are lots of caramel and roasted malt notes with a subtle yet apparent smokiness that permeates the palate tying everything together. Like the aroma, there are some nice backing notes of toast and chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really, really well done beer in a style (Munich Dunkel/Schwarzbier) that I enjoy immensely. I can see myself drinking a lot of this over the course of a tough winter and wet spring."
"Overall: A really good version of a dark Germain style lager. Good dark roasty taste while still keeping it fairly light and balanced."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a tasty schwarzbier, I wish I had picked up a Sprecher to compare it to. Nice balanced flavor with sweetness and roasted notes. Not as much smokiness as I was hoping for, but it does show up. Creamy, easy to drink. A good one."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation and a slight roasted malt and smoke aftertaste. A nice subtle beer which accommodates food nicely. This would be great with pizza."

"August Schell's Chimney Sweep pours a deep cola-colored brew under a cap of loose tan foam. The nose is dark malt and a bare hint of smoke- applewood, maybe? Up front is a good dark roasty/bready flavor and that note of smoke, off the back, mildly bitter herbal hops for balance. It has a medium body to my taste, off dry, and very drinkable. I'll miss Schell's Stout (which Chimney Sweep is replacing)- I imagine it was a bit out of August Schell's institutional contort zone, though their Chimney Sweep is German all the way…"

"Overall --- I did not know what to expect from this, but figured I would give it a chance. I was initially curious about it, and the description on the packaging sold me on the purchase. Smoked beers are generally hit or miss for me, but this one I genuinely enjoyed. It is easily my new favorite winter seasonal. A very well done offering by Schell’s. If anyone is on the fence when coming across this one, I definitely recommend a try. Prost!"
"Picked up a bottle at Four Firkins and paired it with a piece of Thanksgiving pecan pie. The aroma has a clean mix of caramel and cocoa malts, with a mild roasted edge. The flavor mixes in a touch of smoke to the dry chocolate and toffee to make a tasty black lager that's not too thick, but by no means simple. Give it a try."
""
"Overall: Fantastic Schwarzbier with some Rauchbier thrown in for shits and giggles. This is the fifth new beer I have had from Schell's this year, and it is the best."
""
"A very dark, lightly smoked lager bier from New Ulm Mn. Mild dark chocolate, caramel and smoke aromas. Milk chocolate, honey and bacon flavours. Um, yeah, sweet smokey bacon goodness. Not raw and in your face. Very subtle. Delicious. Finish is balanced, slightly sweet, vague smokey astringency. Did I say delicious? Is this what they drink in Franconia? Lucky Deutchelanders."
"A combination of a schwarzbier and a rauchbier. Not as refreshing and easy to drink as other schwarzbiers because of the smoke and roast, but this is unique and should definately pique the interest of smokey beer lovers."
""
"A really nice beer here that drinks wonderfully. I could easily consume a few of these in a sitting. I was personally hoping for more of the smoke to come through, but that's just me. A wonderful addition the the winter lineup for Schells."
