"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some roasted malts. Taste is smooth, roasted malts, some hints of chocolate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall an easy drinking and solid beer."

"Overall a real nice refresher.  Doesn't quite remind me of schwarzbier, but a solid dark ale if there was one."

"O. Satisfying and recommended."
"Tasty, seems a bit porter like at first, but easy enough to drink & comes around"

"I had this beer during a recent trip to New Orleans. When I first ordered this beer, I thought it was going to be more stout like and heavy. Good for sipping, but not something you want to drink when it's hot and humid outside. I was pleasantly surprised upon my first sip. The beer was light and smooth, easy to drink. There was a nice nuttiness to it, with a slight bit of hops. Overall, a good dark beer to drink during the summertime."

"O- Pretty decent Schwarzbier. That strange aroma is something that I've encountered in other Bayou Teche beers as well as some of Lazy Magnolia's. I wonder if these breweries use tap water to brew and it's similar since they're within 150 miles of each other. Or it could be the yeast. Puzzling."

"Poured into a shaker pint glass. The beer pours black with a finger length light tan head. The beer smells like dark roasted malt and toffee. Very straightforward. The taste follows the nose. You get the toffee and dark roasted malt and not much else. That's not a bad thing. It's pretty tasty. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. This beer drinks like a sessionable beer. This is a good beer."

"O- this one is quite refreshing, but I expected a little more of a malt presence"
"12 ounce bottle poured into a small snifter. Off white head, low retention on a dark ruby but clear body. Minimal lacing. Aroma includes caramel, coffee, roasted malts and some nuttiness. Taste follows suit with some bitterness in front, then yielding to the other flavors. Pretty tasty and quite easy to drink."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a dark black brown with a bit of see through amber. Really nice roasted malt and coffee/chocolate aromas. Taste doesnt quite live up to the aroma, but its still pretty good. Definite coffee flavor, with hints of chocolate; but its all mild...but a little more in the aftertaste. Its a bit over carbonated, but still easy to drink. Overall, a pretty good brew and worth a try. Nice to see a dark beer from a Louisiana brewery."

"Overall not bad. Nice to see something like this come out of Louisiana."

"EDIT: After making it through half the glass (and eating some food), the beer is starting to grow on me. Perhaps I was a little harsh. Bumping the Mouthfeel from 1.5 to 2.0 accordingly. It's still not great, but it's drinkable."

"It's not a bad beer but certainly not in the league of some of the best schwarzbiers our there."
"O- Liked some aspects more than others. Complexity was a fresh breath of air in this style I love, but crisp hops weren't there. Would visit again, perhaps next time on draft if possible."
"Pours a deep brown color that when held to the light reveals rich ruby hues in the body. A thin, one centimeter layer of khaki head formed; it slowly dissipated to a ring of frothy bubbles around and numerous legs through the surface of the liquid. The aroma is of grain, a german yeast/funk, faint caramel malt, and a cinnamon apple (think an apple crisp) note on the finish. Very intriguing and inviting. The taste is very similar, with the yeast and malt making a pronounced appearance in the front, followed by various grains, some caramel, and the same cinnamon apple finish. Mouthfeel is crisp on the tongue, but a bit resinous on the finish. Overall, an enjoyable and refreshing brew that did well to break up the clutter of stouts and porters released this time of year."
"Overall: definitely LA 31's best offering. Goes down easy. This was a favorite at the Top Of The Hops Fest in Jackson. I'd drink another. Good brew, Bayou Teche!"
"Overall: I like it OK...Nothing to really complain about, but nothing to compliment on either. Roasted flavor is good, so its worth a try. Also would probably make for easy drinking in a session."
"Overall, I think this is one of my favorites that Bayoue Teche has done thus far. Nothing phenomenal, it's easy drinking and tasty."
