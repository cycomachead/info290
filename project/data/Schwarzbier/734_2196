3.68,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Lovely big head on this ebony-brown beer, pearly beige and very tall - unfortunately it doesn't last very long. Nose is a bit mild and mannered, but full of good nut and chocolate aromas, plus toasted grainy bread, caramel, and coffee. Hops cast a faint evergreen shadow over an otherwise completely malty nose. Like the aroma, the taste is mild yet lush - notes of cocoa and coffee mingle with buttery caramel, honey, and biscuit flavors. There is a surprisingly forward element of spice from noble hops and a bit of spirited alcohol, mostly to add a bit of balance and robustness. Pleasantly chewy and thick, but also well-attenuated and dry. Not my favorite schwarz, but one I would happily have again.","soulgrowl","Apr 24, 2008"

Drank a few of these style beers when in Prague and it reminded a little of the bottles of Guiness you got years ago before the draught one caught on. Quite a bitter, dry finish which makes you keep sipping or is it gulping. It gets better the more you try it. Only £ 1.40 for a 500ml bottle.... Get in there.","cyanidesid","Mar 19, 2008"

The smell is really great, lots of roast and toasted malt, caramel in the nose, but not overwhelming and no hint of coffe. The roast continues in the same vein for the taste, clear, no coffee, very nice roast malt taste, a little chewy but smooth as well. It is a spicy bite as well, but again light from the carbonation and hop that is very balanced with the malt.

Nice black malt flavors with some sugary notes somewhere between chocolate and vanilla. Not to say this beer is very sweet, but there is some residual sweetness countered with plenty of bitterness. Yet, that is not to say this beer is hoppy, because there is not much hop that I noticed, but mainly malty bitterness. The mouthfeel is spot on for the style, with a lager-like crispness and velvety richness. This brew is nice and complex, yet is not overpowering in any one way.","zjungleist","Dec 04, 2005"

4.41,10.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,5,"This beer is similar in color to a good porter. Just a bit of light gets through. Very little head, only a small ring around the edge. The smell is pretty faint. Maybe a little hint of roasted grains. The taste is of roasted grains with a slight cola-like taste thrown in. The mouthfeel and drinkability lift this beer up high. There is absolutly no negative aftertase. A very smooth beer. Slight bitterness is noted. As for drinkabilty, this is one of the best that I've had. I was somewhat relunctant to try this one but now I'm sorry I waited so long. This beer will be on my list to try often. This was my first from this brewer. It makes me want to try their other selections. A good beer worthy of much praise.","Enola","Oct 31, 2005"

4.4,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"500 mL bottle with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours black - between that of a porter and a stout - with ruby highlights and a 1 finger brown head that leaves some lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, figs, apples, and a hint of metal right as I opened the bottle. There is both sweet and bitter chocolate on the palate, along with toasted malts, coffee, figs, a bit of raisins, apples, and green/spicy hops. Kinda like an imperial stout - quite nice. It has a medium to light body that is tingly like a lager yet smooth. A delicious lager that's better than Köstritzer in my opinion.","mmmbeer","Oct 13, 2005"
4.12,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D- This is a good solid schwarzbier that has a nice complexity to the dark malts and a smoothness to the finish. It would be nice to see a hint more hops for balance or some alcohol warmth (I know that is not to style).","rhoadsrage","Oct 11, 2005"

Good malty, bold flavor with a blend of roasted and chocolate notes. Theres a tad hashness I cant place my finger on it almost seems as it might be a freshness issue. Overall the flavor is well done just this one element of it. Good body for style. A very drinkable beer. More roasted flavor then a lot of schwarzbiers I have had.

3.4,-14.6,4,4,3.5,4,2,"Pours a dark brown - almost black. Had a tan colored head that lasted a minute or two. The taste is very mellow, with very little evidence of hops and no bitterness. The aftertaste is reminscent of coffee. Would make a good dessert beer, and I think that it would go nicel with a piece of dark chocolate. It would be a poor choice for a heavy drinking session, as it has a somewhat cloying effect. An interesting beer, though not one that I'm likely to get again any time soon.","WMBierguy","Jul 22, 2005"
3.93,-1.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Again, the same coffee flavors as on the nose, but more pronounced on the tongue. Mild flavors of toasted malts.

4.19,5.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Pours an opaque black with slight ruby highlights and a thin tan head. Aroma begins with a chocolate and roasted coffee aroma, followed by a currant and spicy saaz hops aroma. Taste begins with a nice chocolate, roasted coffee, currant and smoked meat malt profile, followed by a spicy and earthy hops flavor (i love those saaz hops). Mouthfeel is thin and suits the beer well with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. An excellent and very complex brew, definately a quality schwarzbier.","silver0rlead","Jun 19, 2005"
4.05,1.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured a deep brown color with boisterous tan head that lasted throughout the glass. Color appeared more reddish when held to the light.

There was a hint of chocolate in the taste, some molasses in the maltiness, could have been a little crisper. The mouthfeel was a touch disappointing. It started off much too light, almost watery, then the flavors kicked in and saved it. I'm not sure what causes this phenomenon, it could have been me.

The creamy, light tan head holds quite well and leaves some nice splashes of lace about the glass. Mild darkly roasted grains appear in the nose along with some grainy Munich malts. It's medium bodied and smooth across the palate with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation that lightly caresses the tongue. In the flavor it's maltiness dominates: caramelish, chocolatey and roasty. Some light, grassy and floral hop flavors appear, unfortunately followed by some unwanted fermentation esters. It's well balanced, and it finishes dry and lingering.

3.89,-2.3,4,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This was an interesting beer. The pour was black, with a very thin light tan head. The aroma, which was really the high point of this beer, was quite terrific -- roasty malt with hints of chocolate and black cherries. The taste, however, was a bit hard to rate. The first sip was utterly disappointing -- seemed watery in feel and in flavor. After the beer had warmed, however, or after my taste buds adjusted and became better able to pick up subtleties, the chocolate and roasty character of the beer really came out, as did a nicely bitter finish. Even still, though, the aftertaste seemed to fade rather quickly, and left me with a rather watery feeling/flavor in my mouth. Not a bad beer, but overall I think a bit too mild to really impress me.","mzwolinski","Nov 07, 2002"
4.28,7.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"My first Schwarzbier so I went into it not knowing exactly what to expect.  The pour was nice with some ""cascading"" action going on in the bubbles, creating a nice creamy, smooth, tan head which lasted forever.  It was a lovely, almost black, ruby color which you could only make out at the edges.  The aroma was malty, chocolates, and some caramel and a hint of roasted malt right before the beer hit my tongue.  With the way it looks and smells you expect to find a heavy full-bodied beer like a stout, but this isn't a stout.  The taste begins where the aroma left off with the roasted malt flavors, with hints of chocolate and caramel.  The beer has a very nice, crisp and clean flavor to it reassuring you that it is indeed, a lager.  Near the end, the roasted, coffee bitterness leaves you wanting more.  This combined with its clean, roasted flavors, and it's medium-low body make it a very refreshing and easy drinking beer.","comat0se","Oct 15, 2002"

4.22,6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Deep garnet hue w/ excellent clarity.  Beige head settles in to a dense, tight layer that leaves lace.  The aroma is comprised of nutty and toasty Munich malt, mellow dark chocolate, & hints of black malt sharpness.  Beneath the dark caramel profile lies a lightly herbal Hersbrucker hop nose.  Quite appetizing aromawise.  Clean roasted grain bitterness upfront fades into a combination of dark caramel sweetness & subtle prune - like fruitiness, while bittersweet dark chocolate is present as a constant from start to finish.  Dryish mouthfeel.  The light hop bitterness allows black patent bitterness to dominate. Finishes w/ a light brown sugar sweetness fading.  Although abounding in malt character, this brew retains a refined, elegant dryness of a well lagered brew.  Very enjoyable.","marc77","Apr 21, 2002"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Black with a nice light brown head.   Noticeable chocolate aromas in the nose.  Taste was a whole lot of malt with nice burnt character.  Moderately bitter finish.  My first schwarzbier... I think I will be trying some more.","jreitman","Dec 12, 2001"
4.38,10.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It's desert. Desert. At first glance most people are turned-off. It's dark with a dark head. At first sip people are suprised. It smells like burned cookers chocolate. Definatly one to try and make a seasonal habit of.","packetknife","Nov 30, 2001"
4.7,18.1,4,4,5,5,5,"Very fresh, clean and smooth.  Burnt malt aroma and flavors with hints of Saaz mingled into both as well.  The finish lasts forever, leaving you with a lingering malt bitterness at the back of the throat making you want for more.","pbrian","Beers"
