"Another beer I picked up in bottle from a sampler pack.  Was really good, surprising that my wife liked it too.  Very nice color and aroma with just right taste and balance for me."

"Pours clear, deep reddish-brown color.  Small head that dissipates quickly.  Some minor lacing.  Notes of caramel and burnt coffee with a mild bitterness.  Full flavored without being heavy.  Excellent!"

" This is not a bad beer but not great either. It might be good for a cool day when you do not want something too heavy.  It does taste light for such a dark looking beer."

"Saranac Black Forest brewed by Matt brewing Company with an ABV of 5.5% This brew pours out a dark brown color with a nice off white head. It put you in the mind of black coffee. The smell is rich with sweetness and some grains. The taste is sweet and smooth but rich. There is a lot going on in this brew. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Black Forest has a nice balance to it. The sweetness in this brew is just right. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Matt Brewing company did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving this 4.5 out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"O: I think this has some sessionability. It is not overly complex or deep. I think I could kick back with a few of these on a hot day. It is not my favorite beer but it brings a little something different to the table."

"O- A decent entry level beer for the style, but nothing that stands out."
"Like I said, it really could really use more alcohol for sure."

"O: I think this is a pretty interesting beer with nice flavors/aromas for a less common style that is easily accessible. Easy to drink and definitely one I could have a couple during a single session."

"O - Again, kind of disappointed. Due to the fact that this beer is rated high, I will try the other that came with the 12 Beers a Falling variety pack. Maybe it'll be better. But based on this, it's not a beer I'd buy again. Not a bad beer, but a cheap sweetness in the aftertaste kills a decent tasting ""in-mouth"" beer."
""
""
"Overall, not something I would buy again."
""
""

"Overall – A decent beer overall. A little on the sweeter side, but tasty overall."

"very dark, almost a purple / black color with mild carbonation and mild head. Toasted, dark chocolate malt aroma. Too carbonated. Chocolate and toasted caramel notes for taste. Tastes almost like a light chocolate lager. Balanced mouthfeel, apart from the carbonation. Good schwarzbier."

"A simple dark lager that's good for drinking a few. The flavors and complexity won't knock your socks off, but it's still pretty flavorful, and one of Saranac's best beers."
""
""
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed. A schwartzbier can be very simple and still very good, but this seems to flounder a little. It doesn't reach deep complexity, nor does it stay truly crisp and brittle. Either direction would have improved this beer."

"Saranac Black Forest (2013) - Creamy head reduces to good lacing. Thick black color. Good carbonation. Faint smell. Black berries. Thick malty body. Sweet nose. Light malty note. Thin mid-palate berries and syrup. Faint stout bitter note in back palate. Little to no after taste. Very clean. Slight chocolate stout after taste. Very drinkable. Very light despite that heavy look. Wish it had a bit more malt or stout notes. A little too light for a dark beer. 3.0 out of 5. Okay. Not as good as I remember it. Matt's tends to have the occasional iffy beer. Their consistency is sometimes hap hazard and I think that might be the case here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid schwarzbier, no attributes are over the top, but it holds a nice color and a decent taste. A good dark beer to take a break with if drinking some heavy hitting stouts wears you out."
""
""
"Tastes kind of like a dark banana bread made with very ripe bananas, rye bread, caramel/toffee malt, slightly burnt maple syrup. Mouthfeel is light/average with average carbonation. I dont think I've ever had a Schwarzbier before, but I like this one."
""
""
""
""
"O: While the burnt and roasted malts are a minimal element and though flavors these are a staple of many schwartzbiers this still beer works well as is. Black Forest has been around upstate NY on tap and in mix packs for years and is a solid mellow winter beer."
"Picked up this beer randomly in the liquer store.Not bad at all. This is how a dark beer should taste. Nice foam and really dark, dark colour. This beer is German style for sure being sweet and not bitter. Different styles here, either sweet or bitter. I prefer sweet, but that is of course matter of preference. This beer was a pleasant surprise !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Definitely worth trying. Captures roasty chocolate and caramel qualities while at the same time remaining thirst quenching. Because of that it is a great dark offering for the summer months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This very dark beer has actually a very dark red tone against the light, and looks really elegant. The smell is an obvious caramelized malt, with well-harmonized hops. I can say the same for the taste, where you also see, in the background, some characteristic notes from darker malts: chocolate/coffee. The body is medium, and the aftertaste, relatively short, leaves us with a delicious and subtle hop taste. Great dark Lager."

"Overall: It was a good beer but nothing I was shocked by , like their other brews. Pretty solid but not astounding. Probably wouldn't seek it out but it was good."
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (from a Saranac Adirondack Trail Mix 6pack) into a pilsener glass. Poured a beautiful deep garnet red with a half-finger head that dissipated quickly with little to no lacing. Tastes very clean and refreshing, with a watery but smooth mouthfeel. Fairly weak-bodied, but it's a schwarzbier, not a porter. Overall this is one of my favorite beers; absolutely delicious and easy to drink. Too bad the mixed 6 pack only came with one of them..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: great aroma, a bit thin and lacking on taste, gets creamy in the middle but fades, could use a bit more toast/roast"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of those beers that is so smooth it leaves me scratching my head in amazement"
""
"Overall quite enjoyable. Subtle flavors but an overall easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice sessionable black lager here. A party pleasing dark brew that can be approached and enjoyed by all fans of beer. Good stuff here."
"O- Lighter and less flavorful than I expected it would be and would have preferred, but the benefit is that it is highly drinkable and one could have a few of these and not be weighed down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 1.5"" mocha head with medium lifespan. The body is a deep but clear burnt umber brown. Alas my sample really doesn't smell of anything at all, even after full room temperature. The taste is a watery lager with just the slightest hint of dark roasted malt. And there's not much of a finish. To me this is what you get when you go for a look to a beer instead of just brewing to see what you get."
"Ive had this beer countless times, on tap and bottle. This review is from a 12oz bottle. Poured into HF Wine Glass. Pours a deep black color with slight off white head. Very malty slightly roasted aromas. Taste is very nice fruity malt, but very mild. Great brew from saranac, an all time classic go to brew for me"
"O- Nice dark beer. A little light for my taste, but good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very fruity for the style. Had a nice roundness of roast and bitter to battle the sweetness. Decent mouthfeel too. Not bad. Not something I would seek out but I'm glad I had a chance to try this out."
"Pretty good for one of those light dark beers."
""
"Overall a solid beer for Saranac that I've been enjoying for years. Consistent, light and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Light to medium bodied and pretty effervescent. Dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with copper edges. The half finger of beige head does not linger very long. The nose has a touch of roast. The dominant flavor is light roasted malts with a nice tingling bitterness on the finish. This is a respectable offering, but not an extraordinary example of this lager style."

"I feel all dark beers should be drunk in the european manner, room temprature and in a pint glass. I think it brings the maximum amout of flavor to the drinker. This beer proved my belief is correct. This beer has made my buy list and will continue to be a choice for serving guests."
""
""
""
"DRINKABILITY: This beer is definitely repeatable and would make a decent, if unusual, session beer. The body should be a little heavier to support the taste. It's a good but not great example of its style but nothing really stands out. Nonetheless, it's easy to drink and presents good value for the money. I'll buy it again."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black as the name implies. The beer poured a nice tan head but it did not hang around long. The smell of this beer was just okay, I thought it smelled a little sour at first. The taste was nice, a little sweet kinda caramelly but not too much. I liked and will buy again."
""
""
""
""
"O - The big presence of fruits in this beer was quite surprising to me. I really don't think it's a bad thing though as I found the aroma and taste to be pretty enjoyable. There's a lot of sweetness in this beer that, while it didn't turn me off, would prevent me from having too many of these in succession. Overall, I think this beer really stands out within the style and is one that I'd like to have again in the future."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a black with a very small brown head that dissipates very quickly and disappears entirely. Has a strong fruity smell, with not much of a hint of malt or hops. Has a slight malty taste, but the fruity taste does dominate. Carbonation is perfect and goes down smooth with no aftertaste or ill tastes. Overall, a little above average beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a decent beer but not what I was expecting. A little too sweet and out of balance."
""
""
"Overall: decent, worth getting in the Trail Mix 6-pack."
""
"O-A very good beer from a great brewing company. Definitely one worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very average beer at best due to it lacking in so many departments"
""
""
""
""
"by far my favorite of saranac's year-round offerings. pours a barely see through dark red/black color almost purple with a nice head. german malts are present in the flavor and a sharp yeast nose peaks my interest. taste is old world bavarian dark beer to me, drinkably malty, old and refined in character. roasty but not heavy. i like it a lot better on tap than from the bottle, but this is a good representation of what saranac is capable of."
""
""
"Overall: I picked up a mixed six pack from Saranac and this was probably my least favorite out of all of them. Good brew but not my favorite."

"O: good for the style and good for me"
""
"Feels great, great body."
"Overall because I can't find it all the time (only in cases) and it's not as dark or aromatic as German counterparts but would enjoy it again if I could."
""
""
""
""
"O= very drinkable! Ticks me off that they apparently only sell it in their Adirondack Trail Mix although I found out that they do indeed sell this beer in cases-- depends on your local beer store."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would be a great desert beer. For a schwarzbier (dark ale) this beer is as good as ive seen. For a mid level brewery, this is a refeshing high end style beer."
"12oz bottle. Pours a black color with dark brown hues and almost no head. No lacing. Aroma is earthy with caramel malts. Taste is more of the earthiness paired with the caramel malts. A bit bready with hints of dark chocolate near the end. Somewhat sweet. Very tasty and drinkable. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. This is one of Saranac's best offerings. Overall, worth grabbing often."
"easy to drink."
"O: This is an excellent schwarzbier. I generally feel that the Saranac line is hit or miss, but luckily, Black Forest is not a misfire. Just as good as some of the classic German schwarzbiers."
"wont' be thinking about it the morning after. ;-)"
"Pours a rich, brownish-black. Tannish head. Smell is nice, roasted caramel malts. Taste blended well with perfumy, sweet hops. Finishes tight and dry. Decent, full-bodied brew."
"Overall - A very unique beer and style and Saranac pulls it off quite well. One of the bolder flavored beers in their quiver."
"Overall: This beer has a delightful nose. The taste is also pretty good. The appearance is right inline with what's expected of this style. The mouthfeel was the detracting part of this beer; it needs to be heavier. However, it is an all round good beer. I will try this one again sometime."
"Notes: First had this beer beer a decade ago, not sure why I waited so long to go back. This is a tasty, nicely made lager full of richness, inviting flavors which seem feel like brownies in the oven made with dark chocolate and walnuts. Will rotate in for the fall."
"Sweet rather than bitter with just a tang in the aftertaste. Overall a nice brew for a wet autumn day!"
"My first foray into the diverse world of Saranac. Bottle with best by Jan 2012. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Nice brown frothy head, dark almost black color. Nice lacing. Smell was mostly smoked malt, some smoke and mild hops. The taste was light, not as heavy as you'd think with the color. Website said to pair with Mexican so I had a taco with it. Nice match. Mouthfeel was light and easy drinking. Pretty good stuff. Almost like a porter."
"O: I don't understand the sub-par reviews on this one. I found this one to be a very nice.... especially for the price!"
"O- Overall a decent beer but it could use a bit more of everything to really thicken up the flavor profile."
"Although I am not as familiar with the style, this beer seems to have a lot more flavor for its style in comparison with other Saranac beers. It is surprisingly drinkable, and for the low price (the variety 12 packs often go on sale for about $12), this is definitely worth a try, especially if this is not a familiar style and you want to try something new."
"D: refreshing, flavorful, and oh so drinkable. Nice full of character malt base with good depth. I especially like the dark fruit note. Avoids the temptation of too much roast. Instead it focuses on lighter malts. Good amount of sweetness, but not at all heavy. Nicely to style and quite approachable."
"I really like Saranac and this was an OK offering from them. It was certainly true to the Schwarzbier style and extremely sessionable. Perfect for working out in the yard on a cool Autumn evening."
"O-Remember having Magic Hat's and Sam Adam's from last year but there is a lack of carbonation in the beer compared to those."
"This beer is highly consistent all around - It reminds be strongly of Sprecher Black Bavarian. For a heavy dark beer with some flavor to it, but without the extremes of a Russian Imperial, this will do the job admirably."
"Poured into my pint glass a clear, dark brown with a slight redness. A big bubbly head about an inch high forms but it trickles down to only a ring around the glass. Nose is light with some toasty dark malts and some hints of piney hops. Taste is thinned out roasted barley and subtle metallic/baker's chocolate twang. The metallic/chocolate flavor gets nearly drowned out almost instantly by an earthy pine bitterness. Nothing to complex or outstanding but it is a beer I could drink a good amount of over the course of a night."
"Not terrible."
"Not a bad beer at all. I definitely enjoyed it more after the beer warmed and all the different malt flavors were able to come through."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with nutty brown highlights. The beer carries a tall, chunky, dense chocolate milk colored head that settles fairly quickly, and does not linger a bit. The nose is a tangy sweet, with a honey character and slight sour tone. Flavors are dark fruit sweet, with bits of currant and black cherry, and a heavy dose of dark chocolate and coffee on the tail. Very interesting blend of flavors. Aftertaste is light, and mostly chocolate and fruit. The finish is light and smooth. Interesting twist of flavors, and an interesting brew overall."
"Fluffy and smooth mouthfeel. Not heavy."
"O - a great craft from a great company who rarely, if ever, will break your wallet"
"Pours near black with a very thin off-white head that falls quickly, leaving behind a thin ring of lacing. Some spots. The nose carries a bit of light roast and chocolate. Everything very faint. Flavor has just a touch of light roast, mild toffee, and not much else. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Decent enough, but not something I'd come back to."
"I'm not sure about the lame head or lack of aroma from the tap, but overall this isn't a bad beer at all."
"The beer is dark brown with 1/2"" of tan head that settles to a thin cap within moments, leaving a nice sheet of lacing as it recedes. The aroma identifies this as a lager, with some chocolate and malt scents. The flavor is ok. Malt forward, with light roast, the finish brings a touch of hop bitterness. Not nearly my favorite of the style, this is a middle of the road example of a schwarzbier."
"D- Sits a bit heavy, but generally a good beer. Nice flavor with a moderate body. Solid B+ brew."
"O: Easy to drink but could be more full flavored."
"A German style not known for wild and crazy antics, so this seems in keeping with a tradition. Maybe a better quaff in a big stein with the smell of sizzling pork nearby."
"O - Not a bad little beer here, but I would have enjoy more aromas than what I got."
"Drinkability: This has been the best beer I have had from my mixed six so far. However, this is not available locally for me to obtain more."
"This beer pours out smoothly into a pint glass. The color is a deep ruby reddish black color. The head is a nice shade of tan. The lacing didn't really exist at all. The aroma of the beer was much like a German lager with just a little bit more of a roasted smell to it. The taste of the beer is pretty good, has a strong roasted backbone to it with a subtle German lager aftertaste. The mouthfeel isn't heavy at all for a dark brew. Overall it's pretty good."
"Overall not a bad beer at all. Really a very intresting take on the style with a light spiceness that really made it stand apart."
"This beer pours with a small light head over a deep deep ruby liquid. The smell is fruity with a nice caramel sweetness. Not that great, but pretty good. The taste doesn't reflect much of the nose. The maltyness i expected to translate into a little bit more full flavor, but the caramel was mostly gone. What remains is fruityness and a bit of hop bitterness and floral hop flavor. Kind of nice, but not really that special. The mouthfeel was nice and light which is nice and refreshing. Overall, this is a nice beer. Nothing super special, but definitely something that would be nice for a BBQ or something like that."
"A nice brew - I was initially unimpressed with their IPA, so this was a nice pick-me-up. Sweet, bready, but not oppressively so, meaning this would be a nice session brew for the evening (low ABV, good flavor). Quite nice."
"O - A little bit weak and watery at the end."
"My new favorite beer. Wish I could find it in other than a variety pack. I found BF growlers on vacation and bought a whole case. I tend to enjoy english-style ales, but there's nothing like watching a hockey game with a few BF's. Would very much like to try it fresh from the tap someday."
"Overall a smooth easy to drink brew that was quite flavorful and left and very satisfying aftertaste that lingered on the taste buds, but not for to long."
"Drinkability - Delicious, i could put a few of these back and feel all sorts of creamy inside. Great mellow finish. I would like to try this in the fall seasons."
"A deep cola brown with a light brown head and sits of lace here and there. Smell is caramel and malt with a soft fruitiness. Nice roasted grain body as well. Sweet caramel and light smokiness are followed by a mild dark fruit blend and very dry hop finish. A bit of lactic sourness. Superbly balanced with a quenching feel and softly active carbonation. Weight is just a little heavy for a lager with a touch of syrup. Drinkability is top shelf. Another great winter and fall session beer from Matt brewing."
"Overall: Be carefull cause you could easily enjoy this a little toom uch too soon good brew nice and smooth"
"Well, the mouthfeel is a bit light, there isn't much bitterness at all, and the flavors are a bit dull. It's not bad at all, but it's not outstanding in any way. Theres some very light roastiness and a bit iron flavor to it, but it's just 'meh' to me."
"D- nice beer to try but wouldn't recommend more than a couple. Very filling compared to Saranac's Caramel Porter."
"All in all, this is one of the better beers from Saranac. Worth a try."
"Very drinkable, pleasant beer; comparable to a Sam Adams black lager"
"D- Delicious beer that leaves me wanting more. Rich but not so heavy that I can't drink a few."
"D: Goes down well but sits a little heavy. Cant see myself drinking more than 1, maybe 2, in a sitting."
"Drink ability is: if you're paying I'll have another. The taste isn't there at all. If it's free, like this one was, I guess I'd take it. I'd never pay for it though."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Sits a little heavy, but is still nice."
"D - Highly drinkable. I have to agree with Jason Alström that there are far too few Schwarzbiers on the market. Enjoy this one as well as Sam Adams Black Lager when and where available."
"Overall this is a nice beer, very drinkable. I'm impressed with the balance"
"Song pairings: ""Aliah - Tell me your that somebody," ""A Tribe Called Quest - Anita applebaum," ""Pink Floyd - Learning to Fly"""
"Overall, what was best about this brew was its inclusive flavor profile. While there was much to boast about in the flavor, no ingredients took on a robust role. Had there been an amplification of the nice flavors that are present, the beer would have packed a bigger punch and been, ultimately, more memorable."
"Overall, nothing surprising from Matt Brewing Co. Their beers are kind of gateway beers into serious craft beers and they are very accessible but if you have anything approaching a sophisticated palate, this will bore you. Good to give to beginners or people used to BMC. I wouldn't bother and my girlfriend and I only popped these because we needed to make more room for beer in her fridge."
"Got that lager taste and the malts are great. Like it."
"D - goes down easy, but hindered by an aroma modestly attractive ."
"D - Very drinkable. Goes down easy and leaves you wanting more. One of the best Saranac brews I've had."
"MAKE SURE YOU DRINK THIS WARMER THAN NORMAL. Drank at 50-55ºF, poured gently into standard nonic glass, color is dark dark dark brown with 1-finger caramel-biege-colored head, excellent retention and gorgeous lacing. Aroma consists of something like earthy hay or dead grass (not a negative comment), toasted malts, burnt caramel, a little bit of mocha, and cashews. Tasting this is just splendid: lightly toasted malts (not roasted), molasses, and slight bittering hops. This is medium-bodied and only stings the palate a little bit. The beer is gentle in complexity. This beer is NOT good when taken right out of the fridge. I'm not sure what temperature everyone else is reviewing at, but make SURE this beer is served on the warmer side...even at 5.5%. Otherwise, you will not taste any of the aforementioned flavors. I recommended drinking this beer with dessert, such as chocolate cake or chocolate mousse."
"D: Big malty beer may be fairly filling. Lingering sweetness."
"Drink - I really liked this beer and I think it would make an excellent session brew. This is one of the better beers from Saranac."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Pours slightly darker than cola with an almost opaque clarity. Head was 1.5 inches, loose and khaki-colored and eventually settled into a skim with a tight band around the edges and a few dollops of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is fairly light but suggests cocoa and a hint of lactose. Taste consistent with nose, but flavor profile comes across fairly flat - a generic, toasted malt character suppresses some of the qualities present in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a fairly clean finish. Somewhat average for the style, but goes down fairly easy."
"I think it would be good with steak or a grilled meat."
"drinkability: it has the enhanced attributes on would expect in a dark lager, bold and consistent, very pleasant to drink."
"Slick and creamy with a definite 'fluffiness' for lack of a better term. When held in your mouth the bubble structure makes for a nice lightness on the palate without underplaying the roast in the flavor. A very drinkable, flavorful, well crafted beer; typically what I've come to expect from Saranac selections."
"D - An OK beer for a session."
"meh. not terribly offensive, but i'd rather not drink this and save the calories and money for something better."
"Very appealing deep brown color with a creamcolored smooth head. The smell hints caramel and banana flavors which will intensify after tasting. After a few sconds the aroma of hops adds a sweet bitterness to the beer. Nice balance. The head does not hold to long.I like the beer very much and will buy it again. Great job Saranac."
"this one is definatly an easy drinker, great session beer, exspecailly for the low price. all around a pretty decent swarzbier, i wouldnt go out of my way, but if i came across this, i would drink it again."
"Pretty good. For the price, it can't be beat. Now, on to the others in the sample pack..."
"Not bad, maybe a touch too sweet. Simple, easy drinking, cheap."
"It's certainly drinkable, but there just doesn't seem to be much here. I'm looking for more complexity and character. I just don't get that here."
"D. I can't tell after the first one but I can't see having too many of these. Would be great with a steak though."
"D: Not an exemplar of the style, but nothing I'd turn away from."
"This beer is black with a good head that lasts for several minutes. The smell is weak and has the flavour of caramel and malt. The main flavour of this beer is malt but the hops shine through at moments too. This beer seemed a bit thin in the mouth for a dark beer."
"Not bad, its just too bad that it didn't have a nice big head. Oh well, still good!"
"Final Thoughts: Would certainly recommend, but would probably not buy again."
"Drinkability: I finished it quickly because it was so good"
"Drinkability - A decent beer that I would never turn down, but wouldn't necessarily seek out. Seems to be lacking a little something in the flavor department to make it really shine. Still, an easy drinking beer."
"D: Well done. Excellent Swarzbier"
"Black Forest reveals the brewing expertise of the Matt Brewing Company. A very fine American example of black beer. Should be compared with Kostritzer. Easy to drink and admire. One of the better offerings made in the United States. Flavor complexity is enjoyably relaxed."
"Bottle was part of the variety twelve pack. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color with ruby highlight at the edges. Thin but substantial head. Smell was like wet coffee rinds. Taste was very good. Lots of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and black licorice. Very enjoyable. Mouthfeel was thick enough to notice but smooth enough to be an easy drinking beer. A nice combination for a successful schwartzbier. Drinkability was on the high side as it had a great flavor, was very light but had presence in the glass. One of the better Saranac beers in this variety pack."
"D - Goes down easy and smooth. Could drink one after another."
"Mouthfeel is well carbonated, working well with the flavor profile. Drinkable."
"This is a good beer overall. I would recommend it."
"Drinkability: Due to the heavy flavors and mouthfeel, it's hard to have more than one or two of these, but they are really good."
"Poured into a pint glass a deep dark brown with a slight amber tint. Nice beige one finger head to start with but fell quickly to a slight cloudy ring consistent with the style. Smells pretty sweet, like caramel, raisins, and fruitcake. Sweet and sour taste like prunes, dried figs, and black licorice. Light carbonation and medium body. Quite enjoyable with good personality. I love Schwarzbiers and this brew is a true specimen to the style. Hands down the best of the Saranac Trail Mix sampler."
"D: It is a wet beer suited for summer. It is also warming so it would be good in the winter."
"M- Very dry and very prickly. It finishes pretty clean, very dry and crisp."
"Very drinkable. I'd prefer this in the fall or the winter, like I would a stout, but I can definitely see me picking this up when it gets colder. Surprisingly good for Saranac, I wonder how it compares to Sam Adams black lager."
"Drinkability: The only problem I have with this beer is that I can't drink much of it at a time. For dinner, or just one or two hanging out in the pub, fantastic...but for an all nighter? not so much."
"D: Consuming this beer is a breeze; I could easily have several of them in a single sitting. Despite the dark appearance, it's not too strong or heavy so it has year round drinkability."
"Kind of disappointed that there was only one bottle in the sixer... I liked this one."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a tumbler glass. Big brown head, made of many sizes of bubbles. The liquid is a dark brown and has lots of rising and clinging carbonation bubbles. If I didn't know better, I'd say this looks like a glass of Coke. The aroma has some sweet malts and piney hops. The combination reminds me of black licorice. The flavor is tasty. It has a mild sweetness, some wheat, and a good bitter character in the finish. I don't like black licorice or black jelly beans, but this beer seems to have the good aspects of those candies. It has a medium body, but little coating; it ends up feeling a bit watery. The carbonation level is a bit above average. There aren't any major lingering flavors. Each sip goes down well, and the taste is very good, but there's something that makes me think I wouldn't drink too many of these. I obtained this beer through a Saranac mix pack. I wouldn't skip a purchase because a mix contained this beer, but I also wouldn't buy a six pack of just the Black Forest."
"Overall impression: The pape"
"The addition of caramel syrup is a no-no if you believe in following the Reinheitsgebot (sp?)."
"Pours very dark brown with small off white foam. Mostly dissolves, but leaves some volume around the rim. Light roasted malt smell, slightly sweet. Creamy caramel taste, very smooth. Surprisingly punching carbonation - small bubbles. Good drinkability. Nice beer."
"d - Not a bad lager but nothing special. Some nice caramel and roasted malts in the smell and taste and pretty easy to drink. Wouldn't seek out but would have again."
"Notes: For the style I think they did a pretty respectable job. Not really my cup of tea but they hit what they were going for. Still a solid-offering."
"Aroma is the strong point of this beer, it's really let down in other areas. The carbonation problem is a real worry."
"Overall, this went down quick and easy. Flavorful, not heavy, nothing off, and enough flavor to reach for another. surprise from Matt's, and one of their best brews."
"Pours a dark brown color with some redness about it and more than a finger of tanned head. Decent retension and sticky lacing around the glass. Nose is a bit mineral-like with some notes of citrus hops. Taste is also quite mineral filled with citrus hops present both upfront and with a touch of bitterness in the crisp finish. Slight grainy malt character comes through as it warms. Medium body with a flavor profile that just barely suggests dark grain but doesn't quite get there with the flavors. Regardless it is a pretty decent lager that is easy drinking and modestly carbonated."
"D: Well balanced and very easy to drink! It begs for another."
"Very good and very drinkable beer - the color is deceiving as this looks like a stout or porter in the glass, but goes down much easier."
"D- 2 of 3 excellent drinking beers from Saranac so far. I'd put a bit of these in my fridge if i had a good price and availibility."
"I'd buy this one again, but there are several others that I'd rather pick up over Saranac Black Forest."
"D - A bit one dimensional for me. The roast malt character is appropriately light, but the beer lacks the body and depth to back it up. The cola flavor is not entirely pleasant and seems to be one of the dominant features of the beer as it lingers in the aftertaste. Not something I would seek out again."
"D- Very drinkable. A very schwarz. Up to this point, my favorite saranac beer."
"Got this in an Adirondack Trail Mix sixer, and I can tell you this is the jewel of the trail mix. Poured a black ruby color with decent head, but not much in the way of lacing. The smell and taste is chocolately and rich like your usual black forest cake. Mouthfeel was medium and creamy, and this beer was very drinkable."
"Drinks ok, goes done well at 5.5, sessionable."
"Ebony with rosewood highlights and a thin cap of tan colored foam that leaves behind fine lace on the glass. Lightly toasted malty caramel and honey with a faint touch of nice aroma hops in the nose. Caramel malty sweetness with some nice noble hop bite. Medium light bodied with bright carbonation. A decent brew for sure but at around $10.99 a sixer a tad over priced in this area."
"The beer is a very dark brown with reddish color apparent on the edge. A thick light brown head which dissipates after a short time leaving a fair amount of lacing. The aroma and taste both have a caramel malty flavoring with a slight hop profile. There is also an earthy component to the flavor. The beer seems a lightly carbonated and does not feel as thick as one might expect. This is probably my second favorite Saranac beer."
"Would buy and drink again though."
"Sure it's drinkable but mainly because there isn't enough flavour to really be a factor."
"Drinkability: A great schwarzbier. This beer is exceptionally drinkable and quite tasty. Certainly one of Saranac's better offerings."
"Poured into a wheat style glass. Walnut in color with red highlights. Nice tan head that quickly goes to a thin film and not much lacing. Aroma promises a good malty brew and that is what you have. Hints of chocolate and caramel can be found. I enjoyed this beer. I had heard rumors that this recipe is based on the old Prior Double Dark which I enjoyed in my college days. Guess it has been too long for me to say they taste the same but I did enjoy drinking both."
"This beer pours a nice jet cola colour with decent carbonation that leaves a two finger foamy head and average lacing,the aromas are subtle dark roasty malts,dark fruits and some berries aswell,it has an average mouthfeel with the dark roasty malts hitting the palette first followed a nice array of tastes of dark plums,cherries and berries followed by a subtle bitterness but not overly noticeable at all,even though there is nothing wrong with this beer i just feel personally i have had tried better examples of this style."
"Has that Saranac not bad, not good, really easy to pass over quality about it."
"I got this as part of a Saranac six-pack sampler, but if I can find Black Forest in a six-pack you can bet I'll pick some up."
"Nice body, really smooth, nice sweetness and a little hint of roast at the end, very subtle. Easy drinking, beautiful beer. I was not sure what to think from the aroma or the look but this is a really nice tasting beer and finishes completely. Wet, no bitterness really or hop flavor. Nice connected from and back."
"The Black Forest conjures up images of a deep, dark, rich, malty German doppelbock. Or even a schwarzbier, if done right. Sorry, but this brew doesn't have the chops to match the awesomeness of its name."
"Drinkability: A good beer, but drinks a bit more like a stout than a schwarzbier. Still, it's good an I approve."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Has a slightly sweet malt aroma. Taste is primarily of malts, maybe a hint of chocolate. Feels creamy in the mouth and goes down fairly smooth. Overall this makes for a quality brew."
"D- Pretty smooth and easy to drink but that being said I probably wont go for this one again, too sweet for my tastes."
"dr. This is a easy, light bodied dark beer with full flavor."
"Drinkability: I'm not a lager fan generally. But this rare style is a gem. Its clean, crisp flavorful and light. Reminds me much of a sweeter and lighter bock. Its a great reminder that dark beers don't have to be heavy. This is extremely session-able and refreshing. A dark lager that doesn't have the alcoholic harshness that dopplebocks or bocks can have. This is the best beer I've had from this company"
"d- goes down easy geat price... i honestly cant get enough of this stuff. saranac black forest has been a favorite of mine for a long time and i finally got around to reviewing it. highly recomended to those who prefer a dark but not heavy or strong beer."
"Not a bad beer, but it seems like a light version of the style. The beer should be a little more aggressive than this."
"I don't really think that the flute helped. In the future I'll probably serve my Schwarzbiers in a regular pint glass."
"Overall: I hate writing reviews like this, but I thought it was necessary. I have heard good things about this beer, but the six pack I bought was bad. I will try it again, and hopefully I got a bad batch, I will update this review if the next round is better."
"Saranac Black Forest is a dim red brown lager that's nearly black. The head is light brown, thick and foamy and shows excellent retention and lacing. It has a faint tartness in the aroma, which includes notes of metal and weeds. It's smooth and medium bodied with a clean, crisp finish. It tastes a little roasty and a little bitter and tastes a bit like Coke syrup without the sugar. There is a faint hint of coffee in the aftertaste. It's not super, but it's a good session beer"
"D: Overall, Matt Brewing has made a good textbook brew of this style, though I can't say I enjoy the style all too much. Still, it's good and unique to try at least once."
"Pours an opaque black color with a hint of red, a one finger creamy tan head dies down to a thick blanket around the edge of the glass and random spots on top of the beer. Lacing is light and almost non-existent. Smells of roasted malts and some bread-like smell. Not a very strong smell at all but it is not a very bad smell either. Tastes of roasted malts, a decent hop presence and maybe some fruit (raisin, citrus). Not the most complex taste but a pretty good one overall, I like the dark malts balancing with the good hop presence. Mouthfeel is definitely light as called for by the style, carbonation is slightly a bit overkill (stings the tongue a bit) and the beer is pretty smooth, I did however get a TINY bit of alcohol coming through towards the end. Drinkability is good, the taste seems like it would be fine and no off flavors would kill the beer in the long run, the light bottle enables me to drink several of these and the price tag is worth it for this product, cool."
"Drinkability: It does go down smooth but in the taste department...not very drinkable, it has this aftertaste that will keep me away and probably most of you,"
"Overall: This is quite the weak beer, there had to of been food coloring added because its such a light-bodied dismal brew. Saranac can put out a better brew but this one should be dropped like a bad habit."
"Definitely one of the better offerings from Saranac, along with the Pumpkin, Imperial IPA, and Pale ale. A good introduction to a style that I'll admit I'm not terribly familiar with."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch and a half of tan head. I is dark in color and appears garnet when held to the light. There is not a whole lot of smell, some bread and some roasted malt. There is not a lot of taste either. It reminds me of a bock. I get some roasted malt. I like it. It is a good session beer. It is not over the top in any way. I could drink a few. It's good but not spectacular in any way."
"Pour is sort of not-very-black, quite cola-like but sits in th glass much darker and produces quite a foamy head. Aroma is subtle but all black malt. Maybe some caramel and a bit of pale malt as well but by no means apparent. Very subtle. Flavor is a dark, roasty malt presence that finshes with a light hop bitterness. Fairly reserved all around. Mouthfeel is also fairly cola-like. A light-medium with strong carbonation. Drinkability is one of those beers where it would be easy to drink a bunch, but there isn't too much that grabs me otherwise or makes me WANT to have more."
"D) A very good brew. I'd definitely drink another."
"D. I really like this beer I drink it quite frequently. The balance between sweet and bitter is right on."
"drinkability : very enjoyable ."
"Very drinkable."
"This is one of the nicer Saranac brews. Dark brown appearance. Thought the aroma was weak, almost non-existent. Right on Par with most satisfactory Bavarian Black Lagers that I've tasted. Caramel notes with roasted malts. Nice clean finish. Mouthfeel is like a lager, but with the extra flavor of a Porter or Extra Stout."
"d: Not the kind of beer you would have a lot of but it is amazing for a few."
"Thin, lagerish mouthfeel, somewhat drinkable, my first schwarzbier and not disappointed!"
"Pours a deep brown color with a tan color head. The smell and taste are not what you would expect. Both the smell and taste have fruity undertones which you wouldn't think of with a dark beer. It is more along the lines of an ipa than a stout or porter. Very dry mouthfeel."
"Drinkability- A pretty decent example of the style, and a refreshing dark beer for the summer with lots of flavor."
"Drinkability: Good for swilling; average at best"
"Hey, this is a solid brew. Pours fairly dark brown and has a solid tan head with thick rings of lacing. Smell is somewhat light but still nice. Light caramel, chocolate, and a touch of coffee. Some earthy hops as well. Taste is good. Very well balanced between sweet and roast with moderate hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body and very, very smooth. I could have a couple of these with ease if not more."
"I remember drinking this stuff a couple of years ago in my Saranac mix pack and being fairly impressed. With schwarzbier, so you shouldn't go into the taste test expecting too too much, and Black Forest is no exception. Where I find this excels is in sweet flavor and appearance. This is a beautiful beer with a solid deep red color and a huge rocky head. Taste is pretty light, a mix of malty sweetness and roasty bitterness that was really easy to quaff. Not a special beer by any means, but good solid stuff."
"Final Thoughts: Find more schwarzbiers!"
"Part of a Saranac variety pack. Poured into a pint glass. Appears a dark reddish brown color with a light brown head. Aromas of mostly chocolate and caramel. A good roasty taste throughout with the chocolate and caramel creeping in nicely. Very smooth and creamy and very easy to drink. Pretty good beer."
"I could drink a hundred of these, which may or not be good...Right now it feels fantastic."
"A drinkable but not outstanding black lager. Worth a try."
"Its ok, nothing to right home about."
"O: Pretty good brew. It kinda stunk to drink it before it got cold enough, but I just couldn't wait. It sounds as good as it is. I think I've just become a schwarzbier fan! It's really that good if you ask me. Thinking about drinking one of these colder or even from a tap is making my mouth water already."
"D: Solid brew for the style and just overall. Really enjoyable, easy rinking beer. Its light on the palate and sits light in the stomach. Sessionable and would be easy to kill a sixer of this brew. I will have to keep an eye out of sixers of this to keep on hand for a thirst quenching brew with some flavor. Would absolutely visit again."
"Final Thoughts: A very enjoyable beer. I liked very much. Its a local brew so i have to give kudos"
"I really love the color of this beer, its a beautiful deep dark reddish brown when you hold it up to light and it almost looks black just normal. It has a fairly complex smell, with some sweet caramel malts, chocolate and coffee, and some light hints of citrus. The caramel and coffee really come through in tasting it, and there is a slight bitter aftertaste. It's got an appealing medium mouthfeel, and for a darker beer I think it is surprisingly drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler. Appears a clear medium brown color akin to root beer with almost an inch of dense light ecru foam. No lacing to mention here, but still, a nice looking pour. Smells and tastes of toasty bread, sweet caramel malts, and a touch of molasses, chocolate and bitter hops. A bit more than medium bodied with ample carbonation. One of my favorites from Saranac, but I only ever see it in their mixed twelve packs. I'd like to see this one in sixers around here."
"Taste is sweet and creamy an a little thick on the tongue. Has some bitterness hops in the dry aftertaste."
"Not overly outstanding but extremely drinkable. It reminds me more of a sweet porter than a traditional bavarian beer. This, fortunately, is a style that can be paired with a wide range of foods; but is probably best paired with baked potatoes, fries, or pizza."
"Overall - A surprising gem from my Saranac variety pack. Big on 'dark' flavor, but not heavy nor highly alcoholic. Thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"D - I love the head on these beers and their maltiness. I could easily drink more of these."
"The dark ruby color mentioned a couple reviews below is a perfect description of the color. The main taste was sweet and roasted malt. This beer resembles a stout somewhat in taste and smell, but it is very light. It's actually refreshing to drink. I was expected a thick mouthfeel, but was pleasantly surprised to find an easy drinking beer with a pleasant taste."
"1 quart growler. Pours a dark black, with dark reddish brown appearance in light. Not much head at all, just some tan bubbles. It smells of malt, not much in the sense of smell, or maybe my nose is off today. The taste is very good! It tastes malty, a little bit of caramel, and you can also taste a hoppy bitterness. There is a nice amount of carbonation. It tastes very good! Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, it feels very light. I am very pleased with this beer, it was only $3 for a quart. Well worth it!"
"very drinkable in being a dark but not thickish brew. would go well with all sorts of food combinations. tex-mex to brick oven pizza. seems versatile and would please a broad spectrum of folks. not my favorite style, but this is a great represenative for sure."
"this beer was first put in front of me by a good friend of mine,,i had never even heard of it but then as of now i have beed inroduced to some very good beers (thank you susan) . must say the smell did not impress me much but the look the taste,,the drinkability was amazing to me ..since then i have tried many a good great and not so great beers with my friend and niebor ,,,she trylu saved me from bad beer,,,this beer as well as other from saranac.should be tried in my opipion..."
"D- This beer has some smooth easy drinking qualities and some nice malt notes but it is very one-dimensional and I got a bit bored with it after one glass."
"Drinkability: This is my first taste of a Schwarzbier and this was graciously provided to me by my Mother :) This style to me is really nothing more than a lightly roasted black lager. It's not bad, but the lager yeast just doesn't do it for me. Nice to try, but I probably won't be buying it on my own. As always though, I definitely need to explore the style further."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep dark black with a thin white head, no lacing. The aroma is full of sweet chocolate malt. The flavor is sweet, creamy and smooth. The beer is a bit on the thin side and easily drinkable. A good offering from Matt Brewing."
"DAN - you would like this one..."
"Very light mouthfeel on this one. Crisp with a short bite, but light. Slight tingle on the tongue when sipped. Tastes of fresh bread and molasses. Kind of a syrupy aftertaste in there as well. Not bad. This is my first adventure into the Schwarzbier category, and I'm not disappointed. I'll venture here again. Recommend."
"12 oz. Poured black/brown with a good sized cream head. Light roast malt aroma. Smooth mouthfeel. Roasted malt and coffee, just a hint of sweetness that finishes pretty clean. Has more body than some of Matt's other brews, pretty good example of a schwarzbier. Very drinkable. This is one of Matt's Brewing's more respectable beers."
"a drinkable brew, very enjoyable."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle no. 3537-03227. Sampled on Feb. 15, 2009. The pour is a very dark ruby red and brown with a little beige head that does not last terribly long. The aroma is of roasted sweet malts. The mouthfeel is pretty good. Bitter hops are the first sensation I get in the flavor followed quickly by sweet, sugary malts. Overall a sweeter brew."
"It's a shame, too, because the makings are there for a quality brew but the execution just fell fall short. Disappointing."
"Schwarzbiers excite me. This one pours a dark mahogany with a big tan head that smells of coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Taste is very mellow and approachable. This is the sort of black beer and that even my unadventurous girlfriend could handle...it doesn't have any sharp corners that could challenge the palate. Its flavors are roasty but not charred, tending toward the sweeter side of the dark spectrum rather than the bitter, burned end. Very drinkable."
"Pretty good beer. I would like more bold flavors, but it fits the style. A dark beer with light flavors."
"Almost black as night with some ruby tones. Good carbonation with lasting thin head. Hints of caramel and even some coffee(?) in the nose with all that roasted (caramel) malt. Impressive in its balance of malt and aromatic hops. Creamy mouthfeel, and it goes down easy. Delicious beer from Saranac at an economical price."
"I'd say pass on this beer. Nothing that special about it."
"I am a fan of Saranac beers, this is the first one that I have not been all that fond of - I will chalk it up to the style, just not one to my liking."
"Notes: Buy the trail mix if you can, you def won't be disappointed."
"An all-around good delicious schwarzbier, which I am an eager fan of (got a Monchshof right now!). This offering good ol' Matt's Brewery (great source brewery: Saranac, Brooklyn, Harpoon-for a season, and others including the infamous Billy Beer!)I got to visit when I was a kid & was fascinated, although all I got at the end was great root beer (alas!). This great beer poured a rich dark brown amber with a nice light brown lacey head. A full & deep malty aroma with smoky nut hints was enjoyed by the nose, while the flavor brought more of the same along with a slight roasted cherry and chocolate-licorice tones. More, I want more!"
"Longneck dispensed into a Harpoon Munich Dark glass. Best before date of March 2009 stamped on the neck of the bottle - first I've seen of this from F.X. Matt. Very deep ruby brown color with a large, dense, light tan head. Caramel, light chocolate, grain husk, and some toast in the nose. Light caramel flavor to start off followed by some darker toasty tones. Finishes off with some light roasted flavors and floral hop flavor/bitterness. Very smooth and somewhat creamy in the mouth with moderate carbonation - light-medium feel. Easy drinking with pretty neutral flavors for a darker colored brew. The mellow flavors merry well, making this go down easy. Overall, one of my more preferred offerings from Saranac. A style that is not that easily found on shelves of American Craft Brew, but one that is done very well."
"Pours a dark ruby, almost purple with a strong light... Aroma is sweet malt, with some grassy notes. Flavor is too sweet for me, but seems to hold to hold true to the German/European style of this beer. Best description for me of this style would be a hard roasted marzen/octoberfest... I need to explore this style a little more before I'm too critical of the beer..."
"D - very drinkable for a 'dark' beer. you know you're drinking a beer, but it wont fill you up too quickly. also, as the alcohol content is rather normal no need to worry about falling over after one. likewise w/ the hops. very subtle. good session beer."
"Overall drinkability is excellent."
"(draft @ The Distillery - Rochester, NY) Pours a lovely deep and rich red/brown color with a pale brown, yet thin, head. Very dark color. A slight odor of coffee and chocolate mixed together, but not too overpowering. Initial slightly bitter coffee taste (similar to Guinness but less dry) which leads to a very smooth aftertaste. The only problem with this one is that it's a little thin, and not as rich and creamy as it looks."
"This ""Bavarian Style Beer"" was a deep, wood-stain brown approaching black out of the bottle. The tan head was small, only as thick as a pencil and the retention no so great either. The aromas were very soft, hints of chocolate and barley. The flavors however were good, some hoppy notes first soon followed by a rich maltiness. Hints of nuts, fruit and some chocolate. The body was medium/full and the mouthfeel creamy. I was not blown away by this and it sounded darker than it was but I still enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Overall, a good drinkable beer that is just missing a bit in the flavor department. Would like to try it at least once again."
"D: Definitely a dessert beer."
"I have to say this, it's one of the better Saranac styles."
"Nice artwork on the lable. Another fine addition to my collection. (1060 labels so far)"
"This is a nice beer overall. The only place it sort of misses the mark a touch is the mouthfeel, and the thinness is certainly tolerable and far from offensive, and likely a victim of personal preference more than anything else. Would like to see it more often on it's own in six packs, but the Saranac regular and seasonal mixed sixes and twelves seem to be the norm more often than not around here. Certainly worth a try if you see it."
"D. An easy drinker with lots of flavor. A well balanced beer that goes down easy."
"This is my first schwarzbier. If they're all this good, then I'm a fan for life."
"Pours a very dark brown that approaches opaque. Tannish head. Nose is kind of maple-ish. Overall seems a bit one-dimensional. Interesting. Flavor brings an interesting sweet tone. It borders on being too much, but by just a hair it keeps it tolerable. An earthy tone gets in on the mix as well, but the sweet, vaguely honey edge keeps control over things. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation, with the liquid being a bit sticky. Overall a nice drinker. I've had better examples of the style, yes. But this is still a solid enough offering."
"overall, a solid beer, there are just not enough of this great style produced in the US, my favorite is Sprecher's Black Bavarian but I can't get that here in Maine, Saranac Black forest is an acceptable substitute."
"My first stab at a Schwarzbier here. Pours an extremely dark but free flowing oil black (not like a a highly viscous RIS). Smells of caramel and many other things. I could not believe something that pours this dark and was so light bodied and easy to drink. Definitely a unique style that I was impressed with."
"D = This is an excellent beer to sit around and enjoy."
"Drinkability: This was from a 6 pack variety pack with 6 different beers... props to Saranac for that... I would search this one out as something to bring to a novice as an excellent intro to dark beers."
"Drinkability. I would say that drinkability is low as the sweetness becomes somewhat cloying as it warms up."
"After reading the reviews in here on this beer I thought I would really like it. I was a little disappointed. This is a very dark looking beer, dark brown with hints of red in it. The advertise a thick creamy head but I just didn't see it. The flavor is caramel and malty but it smelled and tasted almost a little skunky. Definitely tastes lighter than it looks and the mouthfeel is a little tart. It wasn't a terrible beer but it wasn't good either and I was expecting more."
"M/D - Rather thin on the feel. Very well carbonated. A good beer that would be great to have around if you love malty beers."
"Drinakability: It's okay."
"D_This is a decent but not great Schwartzbier. It is pretty refreshing but could use a bit more of that roasted quality. I would have it again it offered but probably would no go out of my way for it."
"Mediocore stuff..."
"Pours a nice black with ruby highlights and a good looking light tan head that leaves good lacing. Nose is kind of fruity with slight roast, and a bit of grain. Taste follows with a lot of graininess and next to no roast factor. Some fruitish flavor in here, and lagery smoothness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkability is good. Overall an ok beer, but certainly doesnt compare to a top notch shwarzbier. I think this would be a good conversion beer to get bud drinkers to like dark beer. A good conversion beer. certainly not a bad beer, just nothing to write home about. Thanks again to orcasteve."
"Love it, buy it if you can."
"By far my favorite Saranac brew."
"D: I liked it. Not sure how easy it will be for me to get locally. It is something I would keep my eye out for to share with my drinking buddies."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish black color with a creamy light tan head that possesses good retention and lacing. The aroma is sweet malt with caramel and hints of roastiness. The taste is rich and smooth malt with some caramel and a mild hop finish. The moutfeel is smooth and creamy, very nice. Overall, Saranac Black Forest is a pretty decent Schwarzbier that is worth a shot."
"Pours a dark brown blackish color, and has a tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of roast anc chocolate malts. Tastes slightly sweet and slightly acidic as well. Mouthfeel is average, and it leave a little behind in the aftertaste so it isn't totally dry. Easy to drink overall. I think this is quite impressive for an American made Schwartzbier. I would seek this out as a decent example for the style, especially since it will be fresh in the US and fairly cheap."
"Special thanks to Steve for bringing this in for me to try!"
"Because of the delicious flavor and crisp taste, it's very drinkable. This is probably my favorite in the trail mix variety pack."
"Appearance is near black brown color with a bunch of lighter brown highlights. Nice big bubbled head that dissolves quickly down to nothing. Very mild nose of roasted malt and light citrusy hops. Very light chocolate. Flavor is similar. Tons of roasted malt, and a bunch of citrus. Light caramel. Solid hop character. A nice flavor. Feel is appropriate for the style, with good carbonation. Another solid brew from Saranac. I haven't been disappointed yet."
"D : Easily drinkable. I could session this one"
"Drinkability is good. Saranac/UC/FX is right down the road from me, so I consider this commercially available as I don't have to go to a specialty shop to get it, and for a commercially available version of my favorite style, it's pretty decent."
"Light-medium bodied and smooth with a slight astringency cut with a nice juicy finish. Very light and refreshing with excellent drinkability."
"This is the best Schwarzbier I've ever had. But that isn't saying much as I've only enjoyed a few of them."
"D, notes: Good drinkability. This is a solid well balanced beer. Roasty but not overpowering."
"This beer had a good head. It was creamy off-white head. The beer was thin and dark (a reddish-black). It reminded me of a cola. The mouthfeel was thin, dry and smooth. It was not bitter. This beer was highly carbonated. I'd have another one of these beers."
"D - The intensity of the phenolic and hoppy taste mid-palate combined with the increasing bitterness makes this a little difficult for me to drink. The taste itself is so heavy and obvious that having more than one or two would be a chore. Not bad at all though."
"Pours a very nice dark color, nearly black, with some nice head and great lacing. It has a very nice scent, nicely balance between hops and malts, with a little bit of coffee aroma, although it is a very slight scent, not very strong. Great taste, a nice light beer with slight burnt grain flavors and a small bitter aftertaste, a nice balance. It goes down fine, a nice beer to try, one of my favorite Saranacs."
"Drinkability: This is really good. I don't want to put down the glass. By the time I put the glass down, I'm already reaching for it again so I can get another smell or sip. This is a really nice experience. It seems to have a lot more character than some of the other schwarzbiers I've had."
"It pours a dark reddish brown with a big creamy tan head. The head makes nice lace that slowly slides down the sides of the glass. Its aroma is sweet with roasted malts and caramel. The flavors of the dark roasted malts and caramel dance on the tongue as nice bitter notes slide in from the sides to finish slowly with a light bitterness. It has a smooth and creamy palate with soft carbonation that sets you up for anther sip."
"D: Easy drinking for such a dark beer, I miss the esters I would get were this an ale."
"Feels really smooth in your mouth, goes down surprisingly fast."
"Saranac brews are generally disappointing, given the fact they all taste almost identical save a few minor details. However, the Black Forest, with it's menacing black bear on the label, is a keeper."
"Lots of flavours but still balanced and highly drinkable. Nice done."
"The heavy, thick mouthfeel decreases the drinkability somewhat, but I wouldn't refuse a second (or maybe a third) bottle."
"So once again: another? - Why, thank you! Yes, I just think I might! (So he did, and thus lived moderately happy ever after)."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. At first glance, it just looks dark brown, but hold it up to the light and dark ruby highlights come out. A light beige brown head disappeared pretty quickly leaving no detectable lacing. Aroma is caramel and just a touch of chocolate. Taste is really the same. There is a hint of astringency, like strong coffee but not much else. Mouthfeel is creamy up front but it finishes pretty thin. Its another solid beer from the Matt Brewing Co."
" I think it must be one of their best beers.This beer is not complex and it does not need to be,it is just fine the way it is."
"D - A very enjoyable Bavarian brew... A highly enjoyable session beer..."
"This is a very good dark lager from Matt Brewing. It poured with a black body and and a small light brown head. It had a rich taste featuring delicious dark malt with hints of rich fruit with a smooth lager finish. Well done, one of their best."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable Schwarzbier."
"A nice solid schwarzbier. Love the bottle/growler."
"A gem from Saranac, well worth grabbing and enjoying, and one of my favorite Schwarzbiers."
"Verdict: A decent schwarzbier. Drinkable and comes in a neat little mini growler. One of the better beers from Saranac."
"Appearance black almost no light came through. Smell was malty and a bit fruity. Taste was malty fruity with a hint of licorice bitterness was just enough to keep the sweetness balanced. Mouthfeel was mediem body and the drinkibility was not bad I like this style and this is one of the better american versions out their."
"The appearance of this beer lives up to its name--it pours black with a slight, slight red/purple hue to it, containing a small tan head that dissipates quickly leaving only a fair amount of lacing on the glass as you finish it off. The smell is really great--a nice, sweet aroma with hints of malt, alcohol, and even licorice. The taste is strong, bitter, slightly fruity, sweet with a very nice 'after-kick' in the back of the mouth. However, it is very easy to drink. Really impressed with this brew."
"drinkability - Enoyed the beer, not a roasty beer, but a very good dark beer."
"D - Overall this beer is easy to drink and has a clean finish. Not one I will focus on, but good enough to recommend trying."
"OVERALL???- One of Saranac's best"
"Had to ding it a little because it's to high in alcohol for the style, but a nice beer if you're in the mood for something light and roasty. I'll keep an eye out for it again."
"D: Extremely enjoyable and a nice, lighter change from the usual winter warmer."
"D: Very easy to drink, its for any season. This beer has a little sentimentality as well, so I'll never turn it down."
"Overall, I'm not a big Saranac fan, so this was a nice surprise. Not something I'd go out of my way to get, but I wouldn't turn it down, either."
"A very nice, malty lager. Flavorful yet balanced, it is a beer that would be easy to down in good numbers. Too bad I only get it in variety packs with two Black Forests."
"This beer poured a beautiful dark black with reddish highlights when held up to the light and a frothy three-finger head. The smell is of roasted malts with some coffee hints. The taste is like a muted porter, there are some smoky elements with some hints of caramel that give way to hints coffee and maybe even some nuttiness with very little if any hop bite. This is a nice beer that's got a good mouthfeel and I could imagine having a couple in one sitting."
" Pretty enjoyable, and pretty simple, nice flavor with more heft needed in the feel."
"Very clear and dark brown with ruby highlights. It had a tan head that showed decent retention and a bit of sticky lacing. The aroma was mostly malt, with brown sugar, grain and caramel dominant. Low bitterness with very mild chocolate. It's sweet, but the malt still seems a little thin. Hop flavour kicks in towards the middle, mostly citrus. The body is on the light side and there's some obvious residual sugar in the texture. Carbonation was decent. Fairly drinkable, but pretty average and inoffensive."
"Black brown brew with a fizzy limp head and minor lacing evident. Smells like coffee-nut with a touch of molasses. The taste brings on lots of charcoal and a grassy bitterness with a peppery fizz. Definitely leaves some bite on the tip of your tongue. Somewhat aqueous but very sprite, more like a refreshing summer beer. There is a subtle nut background I think. Pretty simple stuff and nothing special at all. It's pretty drinkable other than I just would't be interested in having more than one if there were any kind of choices available. It didn't go well with my meal that night which included baked potatoe and cole slaw. But I wouldn't turn this down either, it has a decent charcoal flavor that is pleasant at moments."
"A sample from the sample pack. The appearance is delicious-looking: a really dark color with a quickly thinned-out head. The smell was not too great or special. Definitely had a good roasting flavor, but it lacked specific ingredients' essences. I wanted to smell more of that malt and nut/woody flavor but it seemed overpowered within the roast aroma. The taste also lacked some punches, but it had a good bitter taste. One thing this drink does have going for it is its above average carbonation which makes it really crisp and refreshing. Overall, not too strong on flavor but a decent drink in the end."
"Drinkability: I could see myself drinking more than 1 in a night."
"D - Fairly high I'd say, I could make this my beer for the evening if I only had a few more. Overall this is a decent brew and one I would recommend to anyone looking to try new things, enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Fantastic! This is a beer I could drink all night. A wonderful session beer."
"Easily one of Saranac's best beers. A good call anytime for a nice Bavarian-style Schwarzbier."
"D - 4.0 - I've had this before and never quite appreciated this untl now - this is a great beer from Saranac and probably the best I've had from them. I had two of these on tap at the brewery tour ... now I remember why I finished them so fast."
"# 3 is my favorite Saranac brew; pours a deep cherry-cola color w/ a slight tan head moderate lacing; a rich toasty malt aroma w/ some faint hop undertones; nice sweet malty, almost ""coffee""-like flavor balaced w/ the hops, a little more ""watered down"" tasting than my usual on-tap version; good med body, though once again being alittle thinner than the tap version; all in all a very drinkable beer.."
"D: Very good. Goes down easy."
"This is a really good attempt at a Schwarzbier, but when it comes to Schwarzbiers, Köstritzer is easier to get and it's better."
"Dark chocolate colored beer.The taste was like a chocolate-caramel bread that was cooked in an open fire pit.I do mean this is a good way though! Great taste from top to bottom of bottle smooth with pleasant aftertaste.I will recommend to anybody!!!!"
"Very nice lager. I really enjoyed it."
"Light bodied and definitely drinkable. Not sure how it lives up to the style but I will drink it again for sure."
"Saranac brews this product using caramel and two- row barley malts, Hallertauer and Mt, Hood hops, and lager yeast to produce a smooth, easy to drink dark beer. The alcohol level is 5.5 percent by volume and there are 173 calories in a 12 oz. serving."
"Mouthfeel: light bodied, though could have been slightly lighter. well carbonated, this beer was bubbling til the dire end"
"D: Pretty high. A nice alternative to a heavv, wintery beer when youre looking to have a few. Ive bought it by the six-pack frequently, and always call dibs on it when I split a variety pack with a friend."
"Easy drinking, very sessionable and nice flavors."
"D: curiously interesting beer, but drab and boring at the same time."
""
"After sampling the traditional lager, thought I'd try the dark side of Saranac...pleasantly surprised by the look of dark cedar, almost mocha body with short-lived head...malt is heavy, creamy, with a hint of metal in the scent....a thin, fleeting mouthfeel with soda pop bubbles when chewed...odd taste--I'm about to take a Dorito to chase it...overall, better straight than chewed....only a few schwarzbiers sampled, mostly Japanese and of course Xingu... not in that class, but a nice find in the winter sampler..."
"Not a bad beer. It pours a pretty dark, rubyish color, with a little head that dissipates quicly. Decent to average lacing. The smell is malty, molasses, metalic, sweet fruits. The taste is caramel malt, some molasses, maybe a little coffeeish, maybe some raisin flavors, maybe a slightly burnt quality to the barley. This is medium bodied, slightly carbonated, but not overly so. It leans towards the sweet malts rather than the dryish hops. The mouthfeel is pretty slight, maybe a little on the refreshing watery side. The aftertaste is slight, just a tinge of hoppiness on the back end, but you have to look for it. Not a bad beer, not exceptional by any means. Schwarzbier (if I'm spelling it correctly) is a better Bavarian Dark."
" This is highly drinkable and I think its easily a session beer.. This is becoming one of my favorite offerings on saranacs long list and I look out for it...I was happy to find this mini grower from them since I cant ever seem to find it in a pack that isnt a mixed pack"
"D- I enjoyed the smoky and dark flavors of this beer, certainly a sessionable dark beer."
"D- great dark lager. good session lager."
"D: A good beer that follows the style very closely. i was suprised and would enjoy another one"
"This beer poured a dark brown/black with ruby undertones and a nice tan head. Nose is of sweet caramel malts. Taste is of those sweet caramel malts with a light hop finish to balance things out nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. This is a nice representation of the style and a nice change of pace for me!"
"D  Highly drinkable, a good dark session beer akin to a dunkel weizen."
"- Bottle pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"Creamy mouthfeel. Pleasant taste, mainly malt, finishes a touch on the sweet side but restrained hops provide a solid backbone. The Mouthfeel and slightly sweet finish makes this beer feel like it has a lot of body and substance. The sweetness reduces its drinkability for me. Tasty but not too exciting."
"overall this is a very nice brew i enjoyed it a lot, thanks to my friend for sharing this with me"
"One of the better beers in the sampler but still not great. I enjoyed it but don't think i would go in search of more."
"From the bottle: ""Deep in the heart of the Adirondacks, there is a place where even light is scared to enter. The Black Forest! It inspired us to brew this delicious Bavarian style Black Beer with caramel sweetness, medium body and our trademark rich, creamy head. Look for the delicate brownish-red color. Don't be afraid of the dark!"""
"Poured a nice dark brown with minimal head. Soft malt, slightly dark aromas- smells like a nice version of this classic brew. The tastes are there- the cooling roasted flavor of the semi-sweet malts, slight hop bitterness and some complexity. But this lasts only for a second, then all is replaced with a dull watery seltzer. What a shame- good flavor out of the gate with none at the finish. But still one of saranac's better beers."
"I drank my 2 and wish I had 2 more!"
"A nice blackish color with a solid tan headskie gives good brew-hope... Taste not quite where I'd like. Balance is ok, but something lacking in malt profile. Smooth enough to make for easy drinking, but do I really want another? Perhaps, but I think I can do better."
"I remember this beer being much better in the past, perhaps this was an old bottle? No freshness date is present on th bottle; I will have to revisit this one in the near future."
"Without looking at my other scores, I think this is my favorite beer from this brewery. This is tasty, on target for style and easy drinking. I really like how the hop flavors lay out on my tongue and blend so nicely with the roast and sweetness of the malts."
"Pours a burnt, rasberry chocolate color (okay dark brown with lots of ruby tint). The head exceeds 2 fingers and is the color of hazelnut creamer. It slowly dissipates to a solid surface layer; this looks appealing! On my nose, I can get the hint of some dry, and dark roasted malt, along with some chocolate and sweet toffee. Fairly sweet smelling with some floral hops aroma also balancing it out a bit. Sipping reveals a strong brown malt flavor, which lacks the chocolate I sensed when smelling which is a little disappointing, but the hops quickly swoop into balance out the toffee sweetness and instead leaves a drying floral hops flavor in my mouth by the swallow. A bitter flavor remains in my mouth between sips; interesting, but not quite what I expected (I expected maybe just a bit more roast) but this suits the style I guess. Carbonation hits the sides of my tongue right away as I sip it. The body is relatively light, and the finish is rather dry for such a low alcohol brew. I have a quart, and I plan on drinking it. A nice little winter brew that isn't too warming, but actually is better for drinking than being a winter sipper. Cheers!"
"Poured a bottle of this after another frigid day in Syracuse. This beer doesn't taste quite like a schwarzbier, but its still pretty good. Aroma of dry cocoa and barley with a semi-bitter chocolate flavor and smooth finish. Not an amazing beer, but well-balanced, tasty, and very drinkable."
"D - Again, not bad, but not great. Kinda boring, but inoffensive."
"32oz mini-growler from Lou's in Augusta. Dark brown/black body with slight ruby-red highlights and only a thin film of light tan head. Caramel malt dominates the aroma with just a hint of hops, though the smell is a bit weaker than expected. Roasty malt sweetness characterizes the flavor, but does not overpower, with hints of hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Definitely quite drinkable, due to both the pleasing flavor and lighter-than-expected body. Only the second Schwarzbier I've had, and I really like it. I've been lukewarm on Saranac's offerings in the past, but this is probably their best one. I'll probably get this one again."
"Worth trying in their mix pack at least once."
"It's okay. Another decent but underwhelming Saranac offering. Their Caramel Porter is still my favorite."
"Drinkability--Goes down easy enough, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this one out."
"Medium-bodied thickness, but is clean and doesn't linger too much. Pleasant nut-malt aftertaste. As far as stouts go, this one is delicious and very drinkable. Feels like it has a kick but is quite the enjoyable stout."
"Poured a deep dark brown with traces of amber, not much head or lacing. Caramel/roast malt smell, not very distinct. Caramel malt flavor with hints of chocolate, followed by a metallic hop aftertaste. Moderate mouthfeel, crisp, decent carbonation. Goes down easy, some bitterness that lingers. A decent lager overall, I can drink a few."
"A very nice offering, a great combination of aroma and taste. This would be a great beer to have with sauerbraten. Pick this one up as a great beer for a chill winter evening."
"Yet another Winter pack beer....Pours a dark brown color with a reddish tint, and little head, retention, or lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Has a fruity smell to it with a hint of caramel. Tastes fairly fruity, too. Has a good balance between the malts and hops. Not overly bitter. Tastes suprisingly light in the mouth with a good amount of carbonation. Overall a decent beer...worth a try."
"The taste echoes the smell for the most part, although there is a slight metallic taste for some reason. The roasted nuts is the lasting flavor on the pallette, although the chocolate and dark fruits are the upfront flavors. Body is thin, and the beer goes down smooth. Quite drinkable. I've always liked Schwarzbiers for being dark and complex yet not overly heavy. This is a good example of the style."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. Nice, dark body but almost no head at all and no retention. Smelled kind of like a light beer with not much of a taste to it either. Mouthfeel was a little more than thin, about what I expected for this beer. Not too drinkable of a beer in my point of view but everyone else seems to rate it fairly highly. Maybe I got a bad sample in my bottle, but overall I was not impressed by this brew; it did not meet what I had expected."
"One of the better beers from Saranac in the mixed twelve. Not a fantastic schwarzbier, but a pretty enjoyable beer in general."
"pours very dark brown with hint of red, head about one finger, tan color, fades too soon with some lacing. smell is bready with coffee in there also. taste slightly sweet, burnt coffee, caramel and malt with some hop at the end a very good mix. mouthfeel medium and smooth very enjoyable beer. very drinkable beer."
"wow. pours deep deep brown. i'd dare to call it black. smells of sweet caramel, definitly sweet smelling. the taste is really well rounded with caramel notes, hints of coffee, slight fruit-like flavor. goes down real smooth. actually a lot more drinkable than i would have thought from the pour. refreshing. i could see myself having a few of these. love the mini growler. definitly makes it stand out on the shelf. would love to try this on tap."
"I poured from a 12 ounze bottle into a glass. It was very thick, producing not much head and even less lace. The smell was very bland. The taste was pretty solid, very well mixed. Out of the 5 or so Sanarancs I have tried I probably like this one the best. I really enjoyed this brew. Don't drink and review."
"I will buy this beer again!"
"For mostly sentimental reasons, this gets a high drinkability from me. Easy to drink, widely available in my area, a rare style, and cheap. Black Forest won't dissappoint."
"Overall: Poured into a pint glass. Very decent dark beer, stouts are my favorite. I would definatly buy again. This time in a six pack."
"D-I like this beer,I could drink a few,I think the darker the beer from Saranac the better it is.I would reccomend this beer to beer drinkers.I wouldnt buy the mixed case again,I would just stick to seperate 6 packs of the beers I found appealing."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth."
"Opinion:	 I thought it was a excellent beer for smoothness and session recurrence"
"D: Yup. Saranac does have some pretty boring brews, but this isn't one of them. I love the mini-growler; it ran me $2.99 and yielded two pints. It's not hugely roasty, but it's not supposed to be, really. It's well-balanced, easy to drink, and has a very nice flavor."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, sessionable. I have only had it in the mix pack and this and the black and tan are typically the first to be grabbed by everyone."
"Saranac's Black Forest is a pretty solid representation of the Schwarzbier style. It looks very much like a good stout, it's nearly black with a touch of red when held up to the light and has a great big light brown head on it when poured into a stein. The nose is nice, a good mix of roasted malt and a bit of fruit, somewhat sweet with a little bite to it. The flavor and mouthfeel aren't what you'd expect given the apperance and aroma of the brew, but is consistent with the Schwarzbier style. It's got the roasted malt and caramel and coffee you'd expect, but not as intensely flavorful as most stouts and certainly no where near as thick as one. Think of it as an easy drinking stout. Where a good stout leaves you filled after a couple, you could easily drink this like a lager and have several. It's well balanced and goes down very easily."
"D- One is enough. Very bold heavy flavor. Nice change-up from a light beer for a night."
"Disclaimer: Schwarzbiers are a favorite and this one is easily the best of the US craft-brewed varieties. Deep black with red/brown highlights; moderate head retention, though it laces the glass nicely. A bit of malty lager in the nose, but the taste is a wonderful blend of crisp lager and dark coffee/carmel malts that is at both incredibly complex and yet delightfully refreshing. A real winner."
"The flavors seem a bit diluted, especially considering the milky consistency and the bold malty smell. It's not really a problem when I sip it but if I drink a little faster--which it really invites with the carbonation and the thin, sweet taste--I end up missing most of the flavor. That said, once I've gotten used to the wateriness it becomes actually quite nice: refreshing and easy to drink without sacrificing flavor complexity, only strength. I'd come back to this one."
"Pours the darkest of browns. Thin tan head. Not much retention, but decent lace.Body is light, with just a bit of carbonation. Smell is of dark chocolate, sweet roasted malts, and a hint of hops. Taste is like the smell, only stronger. Has a nice smooth finish. Not bad at all!"
"D-This is an easy drinker. Goes down smooth and finishes nice."
"A very dark brown/chestnut, opaque beer with medium body and medium/low carbonation. Thick, finely beaded and relatively stiff head. Nice roasted malt aroma but surprisingly little hop boquet considering taste is to the bitter side. Flavor is rich with evident caramel malt and notes of coffee and yeast. Maybe not on a par with the premier Bavarian Schwartzes it seeks to emulate but a great American lagervery solid beer and my favorite of the many Saranac brews."
"M&D - smooth and well balanced, a great taste, inoffensive and easy down, the Bud drinker i shared this with enjoyed and had a top off, a high quality brew from a great brewery"
"Medium-light body, moderate carbonation. A little watery for my taste. Balance is decent, but it would be better if the darker roast elements were a little more prevalent. Not bad, and could be a session beer."
"Average attempt all around. The bitterness in the flavor is too unbalanced making it a little less drinkable overall."
"Drinks okay, A half-hearted attempt at the style IMO. A good one to have newbies cut their teeth on, of you don't be overwhelmed by flavor, pretty good values for $ for the impovrished BA who still wants to represent"
"Mahogany tinted black with a one finger head that is darkly tan, and has a few large bubles. When this fades, it leaves a film and not much lace to speak of. This smells more like a pilsner to me, bit of spicy hops and pale malts. Tast is surprisingly bland, not heavily carameled, and mostly paler malts here with a tiny bit of caramel and a note of darker malts in the finish. Mild in hops but not menacingly sweet either, a bit of spice and minimal bittering. The carbonation isn't overpowering, but it does burn the tounge--not exactly smooth carbonation. The beer is medium-light in body. I wouldnt mind this beer on tap. There isn't anything particularly bad about this beer, and it's not dissapearing-flavored macro swill. But the across the board 3.5's to me spell out b-o-o-r-i-n-g. It's not BAD beer but it's hard to be enthusiastic about this beer (and this beer company in general) and think of it as hand crafted. Really--why bother drinking a booring beer unless you can't find something better? I can."
"Drinkability: The ale is quite drinkable and a good intro for someone who doesn't like dark beer."
"It's a big so what...."
"Very drinkable, I coud have several."
"Drinkability is also good. I could easily drink several, but I might hold back as there are other fine choices. MK"
"drinkability: pretty easy"
"32oz mini-growler yields a nearly opaque black pour with a nice thick tan head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma has big roasted notes of coffee and dark chocolate, as well as some caramel sweeetness and some lightly bitter floral hops. The flavor also starts out with some nice roastiness (expresso and dark chocolate), along with some toasted bread, caramel, floral and mineraly hops and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and appropriate for the style, while drinkability is slightly lacking. This is a well constructed schwarzbier, tasty and complex...cheers to Matt brewing for a fine beer."
"Well, it's going down smoothly and quickly enough so I'll give Black Forest a thumbs-up. Worth picking up."
"Not bad....give it a try."
"Da: Medium-Low. You're regular dark beer drinker would be happy with this offering."
"This is best at a warmer temperature. Solid all around and quite the enjoyable and drinkable schwarzbier. I've ignored this beer too many times..."
"12oz. bottle poured out brownish, black. It had very little head. It smelled like malt and chocolate. Its flavor was sweet and malty. The malt flavor really stood out. It also had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was very sharp. It went down smooth and was quite drinkable."
"The first Schwarzbier that I ever tried was Sam Adams Black Lager, which I liked a lot. It made me very curious of what other beers in this style tasted like. So far, this has been the only other beer that Ive been able to find in the style and although its a good beer, it pales in comparison."
"Not a lot of oomph or complexity here, but straightforward and would complement some junky food well. Goes down smooth and easy."
"pours with a brownish-tan head that doesn't get very big or last for long. Very dark, only letting you see hints of reddish-brown around the edges of the glass. Spicy, malty aroma, but not too strong of an aroma overall. Taste follows with the same spicy, malty flavor, also not too strong. Very light bodied in the mouth for a porter. To me this seems to be a sub-par porter. Nothing really special to offer and not even as good as I hoped it to be."
"Wow! Actually after reviewing three other Saranac products, this brew actually has some aromatics to it (barely..) Medium-Dark coffee colored with a short lived off-white head; this brew has a nose of sweet slightly roasted malts with a touch of caramel. On the tongue the flavor is slightly acidic and lean, generally refreshing with a hint of sweetness and a slightly oily finish. This is a good grub-food kinda' beer, you know burgers and the like; anything with fat, as the slightly acidic nature of this brew will cut through it providing relative refreshment from this relatively decent beer. It won't irritate you nor will it impress you."
"Overall, it was disappointing. There are better, more complex examples of this style. This was weak."
"A 32 ounce growler, poured a dark brown with a fairly thick coffee-colored head. It had a sweet, roasted grain odor, and tasted the same, with some hops. Rather nondescript taste. Mouthfeel was a little thin. An OK beer, but not one that I'd want to drink a lot of"
"Very drinkable for its style."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I'm a fan of the style and could kick back with a 6er of this for some NCAA action quite happily."
"Maybe intended to be a Stout until the malts and body didn't show up. Nevertheless, good for a Schwarz. A thin, roasted grain flavor and texture takes on boldness upfront, then disipates to a lighter body and finish. Would be chalky or coal-like if not for a moderate malt sweetness that is displayed mildly over the roasted graininess. Still lacks the clean quality in the finish and the sweetness is a bit too dominant. Still a good brew if you like the flavor of a Stout without the chewy texture."
"Medium body with a high degree of carbonation. I'll pass on this one again as it fits the bill with most of the rest of the winter mixed 12: blah."
"Overall, a nice schwarzbier, but I've enjoyed some of the imported ones much more."
"Pours a three-fingered light tan head that fades to a ring leaving traces of lace. Nearly black color. Very light carbonation and medium bodied. Mostly malty/chocolate nose. Starts sweet but there hints of bitterness, finish is on the thin side. 12 oz bottle from their winter sampler 12-pak $9.99, Market Basket Concord, NH."
"One helluva well made Schwartz.... Pours out to a rich, dark reddish black color with a small brown / tan head of foam. Some notes of lacing and medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of nuts, roasted malts, caramel and some minor dark fruits is astounding; it's not often a beer of this style has such pronounced aromas. Taste is medium full bodied, and comprised of roasted malts, grain, molasses, wheat and some rye bread flavors. Nice. Mouthfeel is good, has some viscosity to it, and the carbonation is not too high. Very good drinkability; wish this was available in MI. Recommended. Special thanks to conneticutpoet for the sample."
"Cheers!"
"Stewed raisins and lots of dark fruit in the aroma. A hint of chocolate as well. Dark brown to black with a limp head. Raisins a bit of licorice some roasted malt and a hint of dark fruits. Very low carbonation, but an enjoyable beer, if not one of the better schwarzbiers out there."
"Not the best beer I've had recently, but this is an enjoyable bottle out of the holiday pack, and good alternative for those who don't like bitter stouts or porters. If only the other brews in the holiday pack (so far) measured up to this..."
"This beer pours a somewhat dark color out of the bottle, as is to be hoped for. The tannish head is moderate but short lasting. The smell is of sweet malt. The taste is also malty, with bitter undertones. The mouthfeel is rather watery. Not worth searching out. But if the opportunity presents, give it a try."
"Okay so it pours out a dark black with a red hue to the edges. has a thin flimsy collar of foam on top. slightly off white in color. not that impressive of a look to it. It is a very sweet smelling beer with good hop feel to it. Very sweet tasting beer. Definitely a caramel undernote with some sweet piney hops to it. tasty. a good standard, but nothing exceptional. The mouthfeel is great. very light and unoffensive. it has a nice flavor but none of the body. great when you want something light. as a result this is a very drinkable, super drinkable beer."
"Rubied brown with a big foamy beige head that steadily fades to a sticky cap. Doughy yeast and caramel malt aromas mingle with a leafy hop presence. Starts out with floral noble hops and sweetish nutty malts with somewhat of a mineral aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and medium-bodied. Lingering bitterness, but the malt nuttiness persists as well. Eminently drinkable. A solid offering I'll certainly look for again."
"My first schwarzbier. Enjoyed this one will and seek out the style more often to compare."
"Finally a decent beer out of the Saranac Holiday 12 pack. Pours a dark garnet almost balck color with a thin tan head. Smell is of deep roasted malts and coffee. Taste is sweet and malty with a medium body. Slight hop bitterness. A decent offering from Matt Brewing."
"Flavor is quite muted. I just tried the Black & Tan and I honestly don't see much difference. Has a slight hint of carmel sweetness which the label boasts about, but nothing major."
"good drinkability, easy drinking and flavorful"
"Pours a deep garnet, with ruby/mahogany highlights and good clarity. Pale brown sugar colored head of one finger has a fizzy consistency and shows both a lack of retention and lacing. Roasted barley and chocolate malt nose, with a hint of english hops and a faint butterscocth aroma. A strong roasted flavor upfront, with a chocolate malt sweetness. A dry, english hop aftertaste creates a superb balance, while keeping the finish more bitter than residual sweet. The carbonation is medium, and the body is light, giving the mouthfeel just enough crisp to keep the rich malts from becoming slick. A very drinkable beer with a healthy dose of rich malt and bitter hops."
"The beer poured a dark amber with a tan head. The aroma was of sweet malt and dark fruits. The taste was malt with a tanin bite it was neither sweet nor hoppy. The body was medium and dry. This was a bit disappointing the label sold it as a dark spiced lager so I reviewed it as such. Getting on here and seeing it listed as a Schwartzbier it might make some difference although I didn't pick up any smokieness. I wasn't impressed and I doubt I would try it again. To me it was an example of the big fib. The look and aroma said sweet dark fruits, but the taste only delivered a washed out tanin flavor."
"Pours almost black with hints of red. Tan head, thick and tall, also stays a bit and fades to a thin lace. Aroma is malt and something sweet, chocolate? caramel? Mild notes of hops noted. Taste is sweet but not a uncanny sweet but a nice malt sweetness. Hints of nuts and a touch of hops mixed in. Thin feel in the mouth, Nothing overwhelming to brag about but an ok brew."
"This is a yet another solid Saranac beer! It is very damn drinkable. I would love to buy six-packs of this (does it come in six-packs?) but I cant get it locally (okay, I might be able to get this one in Iowa). I will buy more the next time I see some. This offering was part of a 12-beer sampler that I purchased in Lawrence, KS. Very good stuff; try one."
"Overall = My first Saranac from the 12 pack. I had high expectations for this one as I've heard it's their best but I must say I'm disappointed. It's still an Ok beer, though I'd never buy it on my own again."
"The carbonation and body were really nice. There was no roughness, and the body was just thick enough to match the taste. The taste and smell were fairly interesting, and I kept sniffing it to figure out what that smell I could place was. Definitely something I will buy again, and drink more than one of."
"Just less than astounding, this is a good beer to relax with. Not overly complicated or bold. Just a good ol' fashioned black lager."
"Drinkability: This is a very easy beer to drink a good sessionable beer. Plenty of flavor without being beer crack."
"A good session beer, for when you're planning on having more than one."
"This was nice, drank it after a long day outside in the cold. A good winter beer. No head, laces the glass well. Nice deep amber color. Sweet aromas, nice sweet notes. Good malty flavor with a sweet caramel finish. Very clean, and smoothe. It was very tasty!"
"Drinability is good also due to the light feel, it is flavorful but not overpowering. A good mix."
"D - Goes down easily, would make a good breakfast beer! (For those who start their mornings right!) I never tried a Saranac beer before, for the price, I couldn't pass up the twelve beers of winter. If half of the others are about this good, then it was money well spent."
"I woldn't go out of my way for this one again but it's a cool style, I'd definitely like to see more examples, just not from the Utica crew."
"Just got finished decorating the tree, so time for a cold one!! Pours a very dark ruby red with a 1 finger head and good lace. Smells of a fruity caramel malt, more sweet than roasty. Cherry and plum with hints of vanilla. Fruity taste, again with cherry and plum and some roasted malt but not as much as you would think for a beer this dark. Nice roasted bitterness. Hops are detectable but not predominate. Crisp and somewhat refreshing. I think I would like another. A decent brew."
"This beer's not worth the price of admission."
"An interesting Schwarzbier. Not overly complex, but it is fairly drinkable. Somehow this beer separates itself from the very average array of Saranac beers..still nothing too spectacular, but worth a try at least."
"This beer is much more than I was expecting. This has to be one of the smoothest beers I have tried. The mouthfeel is incredible. It poured out with a small head. It is a very deep brown in color. The smell is of toasted grain. Possibly some caramel notes in there as well. That taste is outstanding as well. Not very bitter. Just very smooth. The mouthfell, as mentioned above, is near the top in my book. This style of beer lends itself to being very drinkable. I could drink these all night. This is a great beer. I bought a sampler and now can't wait to try others by Saranac."
"All and all a descent version of this style. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: A solid, drinkable brew from Saranac. I could make a session out of this. With some push this could be excellent, but as it is it's pretty good, and I could definitely drink some more."
"This is the best beer out of the sampler pack by far. It had a very thick/fluffy head that had great head retention. The body was a very dark amber color, almost black when you looked at it a certain way. The smell was alright, just nothing was too overbearing, so it all worked together smoothly. There were hints of hops, some lightly roasted malts, some faint spices, and some darker fruits. The taste was a little bit better. Again, everything worked together well, but the caramel malts were evident, as well as the little hop finish it had. Very creamy beer, coated the mouth nicely. I was expecting something a little heavier, but instead I got a dark beer that was pretty light and easy to drink. I know that's a common misconception among beers sometimes, because it was prooved wrong here. Worth a try if you can get it."
"This pours a jet black with a small one finger tannish head.As with all Saranac beers the head is small and disappears quickly.The aroma has a slight roasted malt scent,but not much else.The taste is a little malty with coffee.To me, it tastes like a flat Coke with iced coffee in it.It's not bad,but Sam Adams version is much better.The m/f is light,weak,and watery.This is my 12th of a Saranac Winter 12 pack.I was pretty disappointed with this brewer,and I really can't imagine having another Saranac."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, but with a lightness and carbination that keeps it from being mistaken for it's dark breathren."
"Probably my favorite brew from Saranac. Can remember back to my college days when this would be on tap and only on tap. We would be so excited when that happened and would camp out at either Duffs or Maxfields up in Potsdam. Well it has been many moons since then, but this is still one of my favorite brews for a number of reasons, the memories, the price and that it is a good brew. Pours to a dark brown color with a tan head that has good retention and leaves some lacing down the sides of the glass. The aromas of dark malts lead to chocolate and coffee scents along with some noticeable hops. The taste is very good; malt dominates up front highlighting chocolate, coffee and nuttiness flavors. Also notice a hop sense in my mouth even after I am done with the sip, not over powering at all but it is there in the background. A fantastic brew and one that will always remain one of my favorites!"
"Not super drinkable. I'm not flying through it during the review. The mouthfeel is kind of oppressive, as is something maybe a little sour in the taste as the pint is drained. Nothing great, I guess it is a pretty stock schwarzbier, not bad, just not the bomb. Mouthfeel could be friendlier..."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color beer with a huge dark head with good retention. Aroma of slightly roasted malt. Taste is comprised of roasted malt with some subtle bitter hops to finish. Body is way too thin and there is a definite lack of coffee in here. Not bad but not close to being great either."
"Drinkability: It's easy to down a couple of these, and it's a beer I could drink daily. Quite refreshing."
"Perhaps this is because the mouthfeel is a bit under-carbonated- or like juice in the mouth and cheeks. It does feel intentional, and this is a great addition to the subtlety of the flavor. Too much carbonation with be undrinkable here. It was just the opposite. Its nothing to write the international beer judging committee about, but it is a very nice product and one of my new favorites from Saranac."
"Deep, deep chestnut brown color. Not quite black but damn dark. Nice 1/8"" head. Low aroma-whats there doesnt have any real characteristics-just ""beer like"". Good flavor. Malty with just a whisper of roasted malt. Some hop flavor. Nice mouthfeel to balance the flavor. Very drinkable beer. Even though it doesnt have a lot of the flavors and notes of a true schwarzbier its pretty good. Decent enough US example."
"purchased as part of sampler pack. Poured a deep brown color with tannish puffy head that quickly fell to a mild ring. Smell is mostly of caramel and very refreshing. Taste is nice and malty with more notes of caramel. Finished with just enough hop btterness to compliment the malts. Easy drinker."
"Pours a deep brown infused with hues of red, a medium coffee-coloroed head that fades down to a lingering cap and some lacing. Nose is faint, but a nice roasted coffee and caramel. Taste is very nice--lightly toasted malt, coffee, caramel, and vanilla with a nice dose of floral hops at the end. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, although a little thin. Overall this is a really nice drinker---easily the best from the Saranac sampler."
"This is an easy drinking, yet tasty and interesting beer. Lots of character, lots of flavors. A good effort from Saranac. Recommended."
"Dark brown color, with red highlights. Thick tan head, great retention. Great amounts of lace on the sides of the glass. Sweet toffee nose. Caramel like sweetness, almost too much of it. Not much roasty flavor. Not very much bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel, with low carbonation. This was too sweet for me, needed some bitterness to balance it out."
"An easy drinking and smooth beer."
"Body is surprisingly light with a smooth, yet at times watery mouthfeel. Actually quite thirst quenching on a HOT June day in NC."
"D: Nice beer to have on a cold day I would say."
"MMM this is a special one. This pours a nice dark borwn with a little red tint to it with a nice tan head that dissipates very quickly. The smell is light but noticeable faintly is coffee and caramel. In the taste the toasted malts come through and it finishes off sorta bitter. Sorta hoppy. Very crisp but creamy at the same time. The mouthfeel is sticky yet moderate. I could drink many of these."
"Overall, not bad, definitely a nice choice."
"Black with dark cherry tones, small quickly dissipating white head. There is little in the nose either good or bad. Taste is slightly malty up front with a mild anise finish. Mouthfeel was thin, but the flavor lingers for a minute or so. This is smooth and easy to drink. We're having it with German sausages and kraut for lunch."
"The mouthdfeel is medium...good malt spine with light Caramel toasty ,malts bucking toned back grassy hops ..finish is wet with some cocoa tones...very tastey and thrist quenching the two characteristis one needs in a Schwarzbier...this is as good as Kostritzer any day."
"The foamy 2"" tan head fades to a 1/2"" trace and leaves bubbly lacing on the glass. This dark opaque beer reveals a red hue when held up to the light. The aroma is of malt and raisins, deep and earthy, though maybe a touch of citrus develops as it breathes. The taste is similar- not much up front, mostly raisin and dark malt in the middle and end, and slight piney hops appearing in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but somewhat dry, adequate carbonation (though it could handle more). By this time the head is gone but thick lacing remains. This is a narrow beer with both the scent and taste consisting entirely of dark earthy bitter tones at the back of the tongue, just a little smoky malt on the middle of the tongue, and absolutely nothing up front. In my opinion though it is quite good and drinkable, I would want to switch to something more well-rounded after one or maybe two of these at most. A good beer to try, but have something else around as well."
"This an ok beer, but I've had way better schwarzbiers. I just kind of got into the style after trying a Monschoff (spelling? it seems to be different everywhere) at the Moan and Dove. This one lacks a little bit. Pours a very dark almost black color with some red showing through, looks thin though. Smell is fairly subdued, a little malty and grassy. Taste leaves a lot to be desired, it's pretty one dimensional, and at that it's not really even that impressive. Malty, sweet and caramely, a tiny bit of hops. Way too watery and none of the complexities I look for in a beer of this style. It's kind of a little syrupy, like a Coke or something. Not really worth it, but I guess it's a relatively cheap fallback beer."
"Nearly black in color with a transparent red body. Off-white head bordering on tan in color which disappeared quickly. Smell is of toasted, sweet malts with some chocolate characters. Again I pick up a common aroma Ive detected in all of the Saranac brews that I just cant seem to place. Its almost a bit metallic. Taste is actually pretty good on this one. Initially a bit of toasted malts coming through and a slight bitter finish. The flavor is very crisp. Mouthfeel is good as well and relatively medium to full bodied. This is the first of the sampler pack Ive reviewed which I would say I would be glad to drink more of."
"OK I'm editing this review because I had another bottle, and it was MUCH better. Didn't have that metallic ass taste, though it still had a slightly metallic finish. Texture was much better and it had a nice soft carbonation that the first bottle didn't have. Bad cap maybe? Also more fruity that I remember the first bottle being."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a really good example of the style, I think this could make it into my top 10 if it was more readily available at home."
"Drinkability/comments: Highly drinkable and a good representative of the style. While it's no Köstritzer, this is a fine beer. Saranac's best, in my opinion."
"Drinkability and Overall: Saranac's best without a doubt. Smooth, fruity, and enough complexity to keep most every palate drinking. I only had one Schwarzbier before this and it was Specher's Black Bavarian, and I loved it as well. Good beer."
"I would definitely go back for more of this one."
"Sampled a 12 ouncer that came in the holiday 12 pack, no freshness dating to be found. Pours dark brown, tan head, minimal lacing and just a faint coffee nose. Cant say I'm overly impressed with this one, why do so many of the dark beers from Saranac taste so similar?? Seems they put a differant label on about 8 beers, but the contents all are so similar. Drinkable, middle of the road stuff, but nothing to seek out."
"Pours a deep black with ruby highlights and a thick, coffee-colored head that hangs around for a while. Deep roasted malt aroma with notes of mocha and maple. Nice, rich, creamy mouthfeel is very pleasant. Sweet roasted malt dominates the palate, accented by brown sugar and dark fruit (fig?). Not much aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"A very pleasant beer, the first from Saranac that I actually craved more of when I was done. Nice job."
"I was not impressed by this particular beer. It is drinkable but rather bland and watery. The head was minimal and short lived. no lacing whatsoever. The color was rich and somewhat attractive, though the smell and taste were rather bland compared with thier other offerings."
"Only complaint and this seems to be very noticable lately for me with the Saranac line of beers is that their beers taste watered down. The mouthfeel is a little too thin. If they could bulk this beer up a little more, it would do wonders."
"A pretty good domestic version of the style, which makes this one worth trying on its own. Nothing special, but not unpleasant or obtrusive either."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark tan/light brown head above the dark mahogany brew. Head fades but doesn't totally disappear, and lacing is the best of the Saranacs I've reviewed to date. Aroma is sweet dark malts, with some fruit tinges as well. Taste consists of fleeting dark malt bitterness, giving way to a slightly sour fruit note, and then back to some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is a tad thin for a schwarzbier, but drinkability goes up a notch because of same. Nice brew from Saranac."
"Brew poured a deep, dark brown into a logo pint glass. Very little head, though it was a nice shade of beige. A slightly sweet bouquet is present - just a barely perceptible hint of ""roasted carmel"". Taste was dissapointingly flat, with no strong flavors coming to the forefront. It remains a well-brewed lager style, (not sure how it got the schwarzbier label in BA?). Mouthfeel was not engaging, nor was it objectionable. Brew was easy to drink down, as there is nothing present to really endear or distain."
"The Fourth Beer of Christmas."
"One of the better Saranac offerings I've had. A dark, brooding sort of burgandy that borders on black. I'm most struck by the authenticity of the beer -- great flavor with a nice, smooth, somewhat thin German lager body. Lots of caramel in the aromas and in the flavor profile. Maybe a little sweet at points, but the leafy German hops balance it all out nicely. I love schwarzbiers, and this is not at all a bad rendition in my book."
"Good, but not as good as I had expected. Pours a very nice dark amber color with a decent amount of head. Has a nice sweet, maybe slightly fruity smell to it. Not overpowering in taste by anymeans, but saying that I think it could use a little more taste. Not an overly distinguishable beer, but a decent drinkable beer and a good fallback if you can't think of anything else to drink."
"Dark appearance. Some grassy hop flavour. The Schwarzbier style is passable, and this is typical for it. Not missing anything here or for most Octoberfest beers. On-tap at Clark's Ale House #6. Somewhat sweet and a touch of roast. Doesn't work for me."
"Appearance is very dark brown with a slight reddish tint as you peer through the glass and see light on the other side. Small foamy head developed from moderate pour and it went down, but left a nice ring about the glass. Seems very carbonated and looks like coke. Nice roasted malt and chocolate aroma. Nice rich roasted malt flavor. Mouthfeel is a liitle disappointing because of too much carbonation. I can't really shake the idea of this being a coke. Aftertaste, however, is pleasant with hints of nuttiness. Overall, not bad, but not as good as I hoped."
"The name Black Forest just sounds nice. Appears darker than a porter, yet light than a stout, this Bavarian style held little head or lacing around the glass. Smells of slight hops with a hint of caramel. Very active in the mouth. Not sure what Schwarzbier or Bavarian style is like at its best, but this was a mit malty, bitter, and with a slight bit of sweetness. Reminds me of an IPA."
"My first experience with this style. I was a little skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed this beer, and I hope to find some others of this style in the future."
"Many say that this is Saranac's best. It is one of their better ones, but I feel that this is a good but not great beer, and it simply didn't seem deep enough for me. I would try this one again in the future if given the chance (I don't see this particular Saranac around too much in my area)."
"Overall-a hard style to find, even harder to master I've heard, yet this is a more than solid beer that definitely needs to be on your wish list in the winter. Goes fine with many meats and breads or even better on it's own. A great beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability and overall: A very enjoyable brew. This was my first schwarzbier and I will come back for more. I like the fact that it's a dark, complex beer but it's not so heavy and overpowering which forces the drinkability to suffer. Don't get me wrong, I love my Russian Imperials but this would make for a nice session."
"A decent Schwarzbier. Something in this brew limits it's drinkability...it just doesn't appease to me tonight. Seems very average in most respects. Schwarzbier may be a rare style here in the US, but perhaps it's rare for a reason....it's just not something I would care to drink very often. Despite this, it's a well-crafted brew from the boys at Saranac."
"Had this on tap at Hard Times in Herndon Virginia. This came out looking a brown color with ruby highlights when the light caught it just right. There was a light tan head that wasnt much more than a collar that left some lace in patches. The aroma was of sweet malts and fruit mainly. There was a light hop aroma complementing the malt. This one tastes of sweet caramel, nuts and a slightly tart finish. A little too sweet at times for my taste. This has a light to medium mouthfeel good carbonation and a lingering taste. First time having this style of beer so I was not sure to expect. Overall a pretty good beer and I shall seek out more this style."
"Drinkability - um, whatever? Nothing wrong with it, but if they decide to go back and make this only available on tap again, I won't miss it."
"An excellent brew by Saranac. I almost wish all 12 of the beers in the pack were Black Forests, but I am excited to try the others as well. This has quickly become one of my favorite beers and I would definitely get it on a regular basis. Highly recommened, enjoy!"
"If you can find it, give it a go."
"Black Forest practically lives up to its name in appearance, pouring dark brown and blending to a pitch black color. A thick tan head forms over your glass and fades rather fast. This beer smells of caramel and sugar, and lacked any distinct aromatic quality, though I thought the sugar I smelled was maple. Black Forest starts smooth and soft. It is full-bodied with oat and caramel flavors. A malty sweetness is present throughout the entire drink. This beer finishes oily, wet, and saves its sharpest flavor bite of all for the last few drops on your tongue. Finally, this beer's aftertaste is fortunately mild, but it has a tendency to sit on your tongue for quite a while."
"This is my first experience with this style of beer so I have absolutely nothing to compare it to. I enjoyed it, but considering the ""averageness"" of the other Saranac beers that I have had, I am sure that there are much better renditions of the style to be had."
"Thinner than I'd like, this dark beer is flavorful, aromatic and very drinkable."
"Nothing really stands out as exceptional or bad. It is smooth and well balanced but not exactly exciting."
"This is my first try with the Schwarzbier style, and overall I like it. Pours a very dark, near black color, except in light there is red elements. Head is moderate and frothy off white. Smells like a dark lager, sweet and crisp. Taste is interesting, almost like a herbed beer. Not very sweet and not very hoppy, but a distinct taste of...cinnamon? Mint? Hard to place. Not bad, and recommendable, but not my favorite."
"Char"
"This beer is my first step into the world of Schwarzbiers. I don't care much for it. The appearance is dark and cloudy. There is a thin head that leaves a little lacing. There is a sweet carmel taste but it doesn't come through too much. There seems to be a lack of maltiness in this beer that makes it seem watery. Maybe I don't know enough about Schwarzbiers, but I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"This is drinkable beer no overly bitter of off flavors and a pleasant blend of flavors. Another solid Saranac offering."
"Pours black but with a few red tints thrown in there with a light slightly off-white head,not much aroma to it slight chocolate and fruit.Taste is pretty lively and fruity with a light roasted nut flavor as well.Well a better than average brew but nothing to write home about here."
"The taste started to a light floral bitterness which continued to the end. The dark chocolate theme continued but quickly balanced well to the malts...leaving a bitter/sweet after taste."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick tan head. The aroma is is good. It boasts of roasted barley and crystal malts along with a bit of yeasty scent. The taste is malty and smooth. It has a creamy finish. The mouthfeel is good. This is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine sessions beer; a real good drinker."
"This beer pours a dark copper color with a small tan head that quickly dies off and leaves almost no lacing. The aroma is nice: chocolate, malts, and dark fruits. The flavor is complex, but very good. The flavor is much like the aroma - chocolate, malt, and fruits. Very good beer."
"I'm not very experienced with schwarzbiers, I would have though this was a porter. If it's available on it's own I could easily drink a few, I found it in the holiday 12 pack. I know what I'll be looking for on my next trip to Lake Placid."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown almost black if not held up to the light, forms a very nice mountainous tan chunky head leaves behind thick coating of lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma: Delicate toasted malts paired with very nice herbal German Hallertau hops in there they definitely arise in the aroma. Taste: Perfect blend of sweetness from the dark roasted and caramel malts kicks up the hop flavor very much so authentic tasting just tasted a Schwarzbier from the subsidary of Kulmbacher yesterday and this is even more drinkable and more favorfully hopped. Mouthfeel: Light to medium body in the spectrum but has a nice soft carbonation not overcabonated at all. Drinkability: Best of the bunch from Saranac I definitely am going to pick up a sixer while supplies last down the street at the liquor store good brew to have on hand."
"Drinkability: This is not a style I can claim much familiarity with, but this example seems a bit too anemic and acidic to be truly great. Good, yes... great, no. Worth a shot if you see it, but I wouldn't set up a trade for it."
"My first introduction to the schwarzbier style. This is an excellent, complex brew that I'll try to track down more of. Kudos to Saranac for including this in their winter 12 pack."
"My 3rd bottle out of the 2003, 12 beer sampler box. Pours a rich dark mahogany with garnet hues around the edges of the pint glass. Beige head is decent enough and hangs around long enough to leave some delicate lacing. Nose is surprisingly impressive, chocolate malt, dark fruit, and some floral hops. Mouthfeel is pleasantly well balanced. Taste is complex, with hints of rye bread, chocolate malt, and currants. A likeable speciman here. Exceeded my expectations for a brewery that puts so many styles in one box."
"A thick rich head adorns this deep blood red beer. A smell of coffee and chocolate (I guess that would be mocha)gives me high hope and anticipation for what's to come. A semi bitter coffee and chocolate taste perfectly matching the smell. Creamy and very palatable. I amy very impressed. Good job Saranac. You have done it again."
"Deep dark brown beer with a caramel hue. Thick foamy light brown head leaves a solid ring of lace. A bit of hops in the aroma, light caramel malt in there as well. Sweet malty flavor with a solid hoppy backbone, well balanced and tasty Barely bitter carbonated aftertaste. The body is a little on the light side. A pretty good beer that saves the day in many drinking establishments across central NY."
"Overall, a decent Schwarzbier that I would recommend!"
"I dont like Schwarzbier, I like this though. So its hard to tell if this is a bad Schwarz or a good roasted porter with a thin body. The taste isnt burnt. Its heavy on roasted and gets its bitterness from black patent instead of hops, or so it seems. Finishes clean but then a tart feeling sneaks in at the end. Sort of a dark wheat, but has charecteristics that keep it out of that class too. A tough beer to judge, an easy beer to drink."
"Dark clear chestnut hue. Dogged, pitted dark beige head leaves muddled lace. The aroma is a combination of dry baker's chocolate, subtle carob and dark lovibond caramel malt with a roasted tinge. Trace herbal hop twang. Toasty Munich malt sweetness upfront in flavor yields to rounded notes of dark chocolate and smooth, perhaps dehusked chocolate malt. Surprisingly assertive roasted grain bitterness lends a refreshing, carbonaceous dryness. Hop bitterness is appropriately mild, and adequates tapers residual sweetness. Understated herbaceous hop flavor darts in late along with hints of cola like caramel. Unfortunately thin in overall body like most of Saranac's brews, with a lanky, over attenuated mouthfeel. Finishes with wisps of salty, grainy toast, but otherwise clean and abruptly. Quite an enjoyable and unique take on the style, with an agreeably pronounced roasted grain presence. If Saranac fermented this with their ale yeast, it would surpass their Stout in all respects. Quaffable, indeed."
"Give it a shot!"
"Poured a deep dark brown with an off white head that produced some lacing through the drink. A slight roasted smell was detectable. The roasted malt was most prevelent with a slight hint of bitterness. Somewhat thin bodied and slighlty crisp on the tongue. The roasted malt lasts into the aftertaste for a short time. Drinkable, but overall an average attempt in this style."
"Very decent schwarzbier, especially from an ""economy"" craft brewer such as Saranac. I found it very drinkable with a nice malty taste with hints of caramel sweetness at a touch of chocolate and hops. I don't know if I would go running out to buy more when there are so many better beers to choose from, but that is not to say that this is a bad beer. Just not one that sticks in my mind. Maybe the fact that there are so few schwarzbiers on the market to compare it to have left it in a sort of gray area in my mind."
"This was one of my favorite beers from college when I needed a well-priced, but interesting beer. I'd probably even say it was one of the main players in my transition to quality craft-brewed beer. So it has a warm place in my heart, and I feel validated to say that I can honestly still enjoy it for the same reasons I used to, even after having learned a great deal more about beer since that time. Ich will ein mehr!"
"A very delicous, reasonably priced dark lager. It starts off with a nice sweetness that segeues into a restrained but noticable hoppiness for a wonderfully balanced, full tasting beer. I don't think they could make this beer any better. This is probably one of the best values out there."
"Not the greatest schwarzbier in the world, but I still like it, and it definitely hits the spot. Simple and light. It's good to have beer that you don't have to pay quite so much attention to, and just enjoy good company. Easily my favorite from Saranac."
"As a rule, I enjoy most of Saranac's output as session brews and at parties where economy comes into play. This one is my favorite of them all, since it is one of the darkest and heartiest that they brew. All chocolate malt and roasted grain, with a nice hop balance that leaves minimal bitter aftertaste. The finish is relatively dry with a little too much carbonation for the style. I would prefer it to be a little smoother. Overall, one of the best you can try from the Matt Brewing Co.'s line of beers."
"Deep brown color with ruby highlights where the light sneaks through. The head rises and falls quickly, leaving a layer one bubble high with light lacing all around the glass. Smell is initially of raisin, some sweet malt, and some roasted caramel with hints of hops. Flavor is warm and rich. Roasted malt and molasses, with hints of brown sugar and caramel. Slightest hint of an alcoholic aftertaste. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for a darker beer."
"Had this at a party the other night(always nice when yuor friends decide to buy a barrel of something good). Poured a deep brown with plenty of ruby around the edges and a creamy small brown head. Smell was a tad indistinct with some earthy malts and sweet caramel as well. Taste was sweet and smooth with lots of chocolate, caramel, and dampness. Perfectly tasty beer on tap. I also like the bottles."
"Light brown in color, thin, yet foamy head, decent retention, stringy carbonation noted. Sweet, malty and some floral notes on the nose. Medium to full bodied with a caramel malt sweetness taste noted up front. Creamy, some light coffee beans noted, and the hops come through nicely towards the finish, a light toasty finish. Smooth for a darker beer, very tasty and well balanced, one of Saranac’s top brews!"
"As the bold print so clearly notes to me, I have never reviewed this type of beer before. So, I'm operating a bit in the dark (which is not altogether bad, is it?). Here goes: while not overly intricate in its taste, this was a refreshing and pleasant brew, highly carbonated with lots of gentle sweetness. The pour is dark, almost black (no duh; it's a black beer), and the head, though thin, is a nice contrast. The smell is roasty malt, tinted with ginger. The taste is similar. On the label, they advertise ""caramel malt sweetness, medium body..."" I'd say truth in advertising. And I'd have another."
"Thanks to UncleJimbo sending it out."
"Great looking brew. It is dark mahogany; looks very much like a porter. Two fingers plus of creamy beige head. Diminishes too quickly, but it leaves super sticky lacing all over the glass. Nose is malt and some caramel squeaks through. The flavor is sweet malt and lots of it. Little balance here and a bit thin and watery. Surprising taste for the look. You expect lots of smoky flavors but that's not what this is about. It's smooth, sweet, and all about malt. Enjoyable and drinkable it is a good beer that surprises the palate. Just a bit of roastiness creeps in at the end."
"Strange pick for Matt Brewing to mass produce (schwarzbier). It was just about a black color with a creamy tan head that stuck around nicely. Also had good german-style natural carbonation rolls on the tilt. The nose was of roasted wheat, some caramel malt. Taste was a quiet dark malt, roasted wheat, and a slight fruit from the hops taste. Had a thin body and character, yet a nice dryness during the finish though it fades moderately fast. Almost an oily mouthfeel with a strange feeling cloy after the finish, like an acid burn. A good Saranac beer? It may have been if they hadnt filtered it, and gone through with the heavy elements of it."
"PROSIT !!"
"Pours a deep brown color with a medium-sized, bubbly tan head. The head loses its retention with each drink, leaving a thin film on the glass. The nose is primarily toasted malt and a caramel. There was a nice, rich sweetness blended well with the malt and slightly bitter hops flavor. The finish was very light and dry. This is a well-balanced beer thats easy to drink and quite economical."
"I'd recommend this to anyone that hasn't tried this style. A great offering by Saranac, probably their best year-round beer...if not their best over all."
"This beer poured out a dark and rich mahogany color. The head was a good size - creamy and tan colored. Sweet chocolate and caramel in the aroma. There is a nice roastiness in the flavor - a little bittersweetness with a hint of green apples. The beer was light to medium bodied. Good drinkability and an overall interesting beer. I would have this again."
"This is the most flavorful lager I have ever tasted. It's dark yet very easy to drink. It's sweet, but not yucky sweet (like Saranac's Caramel Porter). It's dark but not heavy. This is my favorite Saranac beer. Lately my buddies and I have been keeping six packs of this in our refrigerator in case of emergencies."
"Wonderful looking Gore Mtn. Garnet dark reddish-brown color with nice off-white/tan head. Lace hung around for the duration. Sweet and appealing smell that is mostly malty, with a bit of caramel and hops thrown in. Taste is very smooth and crisp, very enjoyable. This is easily the best Saranac has to offer, and is even better if you can find it on-tap."
"Dark brown/ruby in color with a fair sized, medium-tan, creamy head. Nice lace in the glass. Very appealing, sweet malty aroma with caramel and toffee notes. Medium body to the beer though the finish starts out unsatisfyingly light, almost watery. Things improve as the beer warms, however, with a nice toasty aftertaste developing to compensate somewhat for the thin body. Flavor begins with a strong taste of caramel malt and a mild (too mild, IMHO) roastiness. Hop flavor is understated. Drinkable beer, but too wimpy to be a a great schwarz."
"Right away this brew is looking good & thick. The only light to penetrate this brew comes out blood red. Other than that, it's black, hence the name. Huge frothy head. Looks can be decieving though. This beer is about as thick as your average pale ale. Still nice but no motor oil here.Smell is nice & malty, with some hops peeking through. A decent sweet malt taste, not overbearing at all. Drinkability is niice here. Not a ""Big"" beer, but great beer"
"F."
"Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights and comes with a massive tan head. The head slowly shrinks down into a lumpy froth that lasts and lasts. The smell consists of faint burnt malt and a slightly twangy hop. Again the taste is also slightly faint but has a nice combination of lightly roasted malt and an earthy grain with very light hops. It is incredibly smooth and drinks down easy. It is light bodied and finishes just a lightly dry bitter. Nice brew! Thanks again to BIGDEB for sending me this brew! Cheers!"
"Cheers to my friend BigDeb for this sample."
"I was given a 6 pack of Saranac's black forest by a guy at work.I was mislead by the name ""Black Forest"" assuming it would be real dark and thick.Upon drinking I found it was quite the opposite.I had a nice creamy head and poured a brownish-red color.It has a malty taste with a little bite upon swallowing.A little taste of hops and wheat but nothing overwhelming.I really enjoyed this beer and would buy it again."
"Not quite sure what we were drinking here...The color was dark but in the glass wasn't dark enough - looked like someone had added a little dark food coloring. Couldn't tell if this was a lager, an ale or whatever. No discernable taste to say wow about - wouldn't try it again unless I was stuck in the airport and this was all there was."
"An awesome awesome brew. One of my favorites from Saranac. Everytime my buddy goes home to Fredonia, NY I always give him cash and beg him to bring back a few 6'ers. Flavor is that of lighter stout but carries some hoppiness to it. Color is dark but not super dark like that of an imperial stout or even a heavy porter. Very drinkable, I think its pretty light for the flavor it packs (this is not to say this is a light beer by any means or stretch of words). A very enjoyable brew. I have to say I am a huge fan of the Saranac assorted 12 packs."
"prices are unfortunately going up: $6-$7 in central to northern Jersey."
"Great session beer !  Great on it's own but doesn't really stack up to the true European varieties..."
"A very unique and satisfying brew."
"Pours a deep brown with a full, big bubbled tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some good lace. The dark malt and slightly hoppy aroma is surprisingly apparent. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation level and lightly creamy mouthfeel. The malt flavor is apparent up front, mainly of a very nice, gently sweet caramel backed by bittersweet chocolate. As it crosses the palate a distinct, grassy hop flavor comes forth. A solid bitterness that never oversteps its bounds balances the palate before receeding into a lightly dry finish with some residual chocolate-like notes. An exceptionally well done beer that deserves more attention."
"Taste is rather unique... decently hopped like other Saranac styles, almost to a point of fighting with the caramel malt.  Too smooth and hoppy and not bitter enough to consider a stout, but fits the BA classification of ""Schwarzbier"" very well."
" Smooth with a medium body that I would just love to fill up a bit. The roasty malts are there, but way toned down. The grassy flavor is also a bit light. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Definitely a brew that you could have a few of. Ah, a few minutes warmed in my hands, and a touch more flavoring comes into play. It is still lacking, but never the less it is a good beer."
"This brew's a nice garnet color with a good creamy head.  Problem is....it's gone within a minute.  Aroma is indistinguisable.  Seems like a sour fruity aroma that is out of place for this style.  Taste is pretty bland.  The only positive thing I can say about this beer is that it is not bad.  The tastes that I perceive are all slight:  caramel malt and a grainy dryness.This beer does not hold a candle to the Sprecher Black Bavarian.  I am going to go confirm that right now as I have one Black Bavarian in the Fridge."
"Almost black with a thick (and solid) tan head. Roasty on the nose but nothing nice. Smooth and malty with a slight hop kick. When chilled it has an odd sharp edge on your tongue. Let it warm slightly to enjoy. As in three/four minutes before the pour. Just thick enough without feeling Stout-ish."
"I really like this beer.  I am not usually privy to lagers, but this one changed my views.  A beautiful deep amber color and foamy head introduce a sweet aroma and malt flavor that is unique.  Goes down smooth and easy.  THis is especially good for those who wna tto have the health benefits of a dark beer, but not the body of an dark ale."
"This was the beer I was most looking forward to in the Saranac sampler and I was not disappointed. I have entered the Black Forest and am never returning."
"Most Saranac products are good, but not outstanding; this is an exception.  It's a nicely balanced, interesting, and well-brewed beer.  I can't find any faults with the beer, and it's terrific to see a large regional brewery take a stab at an uncommon beer style."
"Pours a nice dark brown (almost black) with a nice creamy head.  Subtle malt and light noble hop aromas.  Great smooth malt taste with just enough hops to balance the brew out very nicely.  Crisp and smooth on the palate and highly drinkable.  A few more breweries need to brew beers like this."
"Notes: Too few Schwarzbiers out on the market, this is the one to drink. Very drinkable and very enjoyable, top shelf."
"Now, this is a good beer, Saranac's best in my opinion.  Dark color and retentive head. Quick malty flavor that gradually mellows to a toasty fade in the back of the mouth.  Nice, rounded sweet malt flavors, good stuff."
"The color was deep black, and the head a amber/caramel brown color. After pouring the beer into my glass the smell & look was even more inviting. On the nose there is a slight roastiness, grainy, toasted bread aroma. On the palate the same flavor, toasted bread, caramel, nice sweetness.Th is my favorite from the Saranac line of brews. If you let it warm up a bit before pouring it into a glass, it will bring out more flavor. Schwarzbiers are becoming one of my favorite beer style its to bad that not many breweries make this style."
"Perhaps I forgot to turn my taste buds on, but I found this beer to be surprisingly light on flavor.  Great dark color - but almost none of the malty sweetness associated with a schwarzbier.  A little tart and astringent up front, and then it just sort became nondescript in overall flavor.  Maybe this is one of those beers that is really good on tap, but does not bottle well.  I would sum it up in one word - ""bland."""
"Impressive brew from Saranac. Great tan head laces all the way down the glass as you pound this lip smacking beer. Clean, crisp, roasted malt flavors go down easily with a pronounced smooth mouthfeel. Finishes with a balanced hop bitterness. Got this one in the 12 Beers of Christmas case."
"Re-rate:  I'm lowering my rating on this after tasting it again after having a ""real"" schwarzbier (Herold Black). I don't know if the Saranac itself has lost some of its oomph or if the bar has been raised because of my experience with Herold, but this beer is just a very basic example of the style."
"didnt really like this one. it was dark, but not very smoky and it left a metallic after taste that i just didnt enjoy."
"Possibly the finest American made schwarzbier. Excellent."
