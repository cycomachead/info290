"Not a lot of BAs like this style, and I certainly understand that. I know I'm a bit of a wierdo for enjoying malt-forward beers like this. If you like bready beers like Skullsplitter and Robert the Bruce, you'll really enjoy this. It's an imperial version of a classic, underappreciated German style crafted by two fantastic breweries - one of which (Great Lakes) just might be the single best brewer of domestic lagers that there is."

"Dark brown in color with ruby edges.  Creamy mouthfeel. Touch of sweetness on the flavor profile that is probably coming from the malt.  The finish was dry and bitter but there was also an odd aftertaste as well."

"a fine offering."

"Tons of roasted notes coming off this one. A nice hint of honey as well. The taste has a lot of those roasted flavors but they seem toned down. A heavy dose of chocolate has added a heap of sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is medium to full. Nice collab, they should do this again."

"Pours a dark brownish black color with a whitefish head. Aroma of roasted malts and creamy grain, a bit bready from lager yeast strain. In the taste, big roasted malt and a small earthy, woodsy flavor. Malts are full of charcoal, dark chocolate, and coffee. Well rounded bitterness keeps the beer balanced. Full bodied brew with a creamier feel. Overall, this is a big ol schwarzbier but at the same time drinks like a much lighter beer. Does damage to sobriety but certainly not to the taste buds. I'd have another one of these."

"12oz pour at the World of Beer. I was hyped for this beer because I have had some great Cigar City beers, and love our (somewhat) local Great Lakes. Big mistake. Very dark body (deep brown with a bit of mahogany in the sides), and a finger of tan head. Weak on the nose... a hint of a coffee note and then something (disturbingly like B.O.) uncharacteristic of a nice, clean beer. Malty, just a bit of bitterness, and some alcohol. Wife had a sip as well, and was not impressed either. Watery for a dark beer (characteristic of schwarzbier style?). Overall, I was completely underwhelmed. Save your $$, get an Edmund Fitzgerald instead."

"The beer appears dark brown, nearing black, with a thick, soapy beige head. The aroma offers pine, alcohol, roast, chocolate. Lots of chocolate in the flavor. Moderate bitterness with a touch of coffee. Hop presence in the finish. Medium bodied with a light alcohol heat in the back end. Pretty good."
"If this was placed in front of me as a judge I'd knock it substantially for the lack of smoke and roast but as a casual drinker who likes a nice stout I mark this as a worthwhile endeavor."

"Cola brown pour, pretty opaque, topped with a small tan head; moderate retention and some lacing. Weird aroma, aside from caramel and toasted dark bread, I picked up a strange vegetal scent distinctively reminiscent of fresh peas. This was a blind tasting, and though I had no idea what it was, the lager yeast definitely came through up front in the taste, malty, nutty, sour pumpernickel--and once again, tasted like there were peas in my beer. No mistaking a flavor that distinct. Some DMS off-flavors, if I had to guess...maybe this one is on the road to infection, if it's not there already. Light-medium body, but about right for the style. Not something I'd want more than a sample of. There was something off here, and I wasn't digging it."

"Appears black under a beige head that fades to random bubbly patches. Smells dark and malty...nutty and toasty with toffee and a dark fruit note reminiscent of plums and dates. Deliciously sweet malty flavor: berries, cherries, sweet dark bread, and chocolate. Medium-plus bodied and creamy with a lingering sweetness and a very slight tangy quality. Easy to drink for its strength and despite the sweetness. Imperial Schwarzbier? Seems like a ""style"" worth exploring based on the results here."

"Pours with a minimal head on a roasty coffee bomb... with mocha lacing, loads of dark roasty grains, very unexpected flavor in this lager thin brew. Complete surprise. Faint sweetness in the finish too. Very nice brew - one of my faves from the series."

"As an imperial schwarzbier, I think that this beer does quite well. However once that medley of flavors hit the tongue, the expectations of imperial stout mount. And that's simply something that this relatively delicate beer is incapable of contending."
""
"Onyx, frothy, lingering tan head, with aromas laden with chocolate and light roast malt. Hints of coffee in the aroma, but chocolate dominates. Flavor is slightly sweet, but more chocolate and roast malt heavy. Body is fairly full, with carbonation slightly fuller than expected, and heavy alcohol warmth. There's a note of dark fruit and phenols. Definitely more characterful and less roast than most."

"O - This is a thick beer for a lager, and it is loaded with flavor. Plus the abv is nothing to overlook. I like it because of its stout-like mouthfeel and flavors. It's almost like a light stout."
""
"Local Roots will have it on tap the rest of the week. Hurry and get a growler before its gone."

"O: A unique and enjoyable beer, not a favorite but recommended and I would definitely buy more if it wasn't a one-time collaboration"

"Final verdict: killer Black Lager and I would love to see it again~"

" I liked it and thought it was one of the better collaborations I have tasted from Cigar City, and being done with Great Lakes. Glad I got to try it when I visited Great Lakes as it is a very limited release."
"Overall: Now here is a beer with a difference; a beer with a strong chocolate character and a crisp lager finish; an Imperial Schwarz - I just love it"
"O- This beer has a great mouthfeel, but overall it is just too sweet for me to want to order it again."
