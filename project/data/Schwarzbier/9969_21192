4.43,22.7,4,4,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Very dark red color. Aroma if clean with hints of roasted malts. Flavor is mild and smooth with roasted malt and hints of chocolate, isn't overpowered by the roasted malt like most dark (almost black) beers are. The body is on the light, but not watery, and is oddly refreshing. Overall an amazing beer, and I was extremely shocked. Usually I tend to like my lagers on the lighter side (pilsners, helles lagers).","Joe_Howard","Feb 13, 2015"
3.86,6.9,3.75,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"O:  it's full of toasted-malt flavor with a ton of sweetness, and the oak-wood/baker's chocolate aftertaste is very nice ... the sweet knocks down the bitterness a bunch, which makes for a pretty taste, easy-to-handle brew.  a beer I'll definitely grab again.","Premo88","Feb 07, 2015"
3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Color is black initially and dark reddish brown in the light. Thin layer of khaki foam that parts after the first couple sips. Aroma is mild with a light amount of roast. Taste is lightly bitter and roasty, feels mildly astringent. Dry with zero sweetness, vague carob and ash. Light dry roast lingers in the aftertaste. Overall it's lightness is an asset when paired with heavier food like BBQ.","emerge077","Feb 03, 2015"

It fades rather quickly after swallowing to some sticky sweetness with a little bit of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is very light, typical of a lager, though I feel it could have been a little bit heavier and it would have satisfied me quite well. It's refreshing and something I could drink after a hot summer's day, but probably not something I would buy on the regular, though if I had the opportunity to try it on-tap I would probably bump my score up a little bit. As far as Texas beers go, however, this isn't bad at all.","Caj1","Jun 22, 2013"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that tastes better than it smells in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","May 30, 2013"

Hoppy turned into black ale and pilsner turned into hefeweizen. A bit of a strong aftertaste, but it is to be expected from a dark beer. Over all an enjoyable experience.

There's a nice, finger length head left atop the beer. The aroma is of slightly sweet and dark malt that almost smells charred from the smokiness. The taste is dominated by the slightly smoky dark malt that is slightly sweet in the background. The hop presence is minimal, so the malt gets to shine with this beer. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is clean. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Jun 29, 2012"

It makes a good Schwarzbier session brew and its easy- going nature makes it a good choice for newbies to the style. It would be even better with a slightly heavier, chewier body but it is definitely a respectable effort in its own right and certainly a beer worth trying.","BryanCarey","Jun 20, 2012"

The roasted malts really give you that big flavor of coffee.

The smell is of toasted malts with a hint of coffee and cocoa in there as well. The initial taste was a little bizarre - very biting and almost minty. There is also the sweet roasted malt backbone, but it's masked by the opening astringency. The mouthfeel is fairly light with decent carbonation.

Aroma is hearty dark grains, some burntness in there, but a tart fruitiness in the middle I'm not wild about. Taste is not as intense with the dark malts as the nose, but the fruit I was scared of isn't here either, which is nice. Closes with a light bitterness that seems more coffee than hops.

Medium carbonation, with bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Aromas are welcoming; yeasty malty notes swell in the nose, with hints of grain and bread dough in the wings. Nice.

Taste is chocolate, but very watered down. This isn't a bad thing considering this is a lager, but I would have liked to see more complexity rather than chocolate and grains.

The taste has a strong element of roasted flavors upfront with hints of chocolate popping through towards the middle through the finish. The necessary sweetness rides in alongside the chocolate flavors and keeps the roastiness from going overboard. Personally, I find the roastiness to be too strong for a schwarzbier, with levels almost reaching a weak dry stout.
