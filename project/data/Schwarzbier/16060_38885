Strong, malty aroma has smoky and dusty hops notes and a hint of caramel. Malty flavor has a firm note of woody hops, rather like hay, with a caramel touch.

Presents a somewhat metallic/sulfury taste. Slight hop bitterness in the fade. Nice full mouthfeel. Overall there is better out there. I hate to dis Weeping Radish but for me the have never been the same since the move from Manteo. I try them each year and it just is not there for me.","lackenhauser","0"
3.77,10.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4," The taste is good a very nice lager with some yeast notes and raisin twang from specialty malts with s subtle hint of green apple and plum with a nice woody nuttiness in the flavor, The caramel sweetness seems to balance a little of that though. The overall impression is a good black lager. I remember the original and this is still a good one although there are many I prefer in this style.","Slatetank","Feb 17, 2012"

The second half of the bottle was drunk with food, which helped temper the beer a bit. I finished it easily, but will cross it off my list for future trips to the store.","TappaKeggaBrew","Nov 02, 2011"

4,17.6,4,4,4,4,4,"At first sip I taste and smell hint of caramel in this light bodied dark lager. It drinks very smooth and I should emphasize the light body. It does not appear that it would have as a light a body as it does. The light body also seems to give it a mild flavor. There isn't a lot going on with this brew. It's simple, refreshing, and somewhat unique because the style is not available at most breweries. I picked it up in a 22oz bottle and at $4 I'd say it was overpriced. I would get it again particularly at a better price.","dball","Jul 12, 2011"

The beer looked very promising upon the poor with a nice head and a rich dark brown/black color. However, it was fairly unremarkable otherwise. The mouthfeel was thin, and I tasted a hint of a porter with cocoa and coffee but that was about it. That said, it might be a good session beer if it's not going to be the focus of the session.","BuzzLitebier","Mar 18, 2011"

2.54,-25.3,3.5,2,2,3.5,3.5,"D: This was not a good beer. The scent and taste were dirty and not enjoyable. The body was acceptable at best. Not really worth drinking, so drinkability is low.

2.43,-28.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Picked up a bomber from Harris Teeter for $3.50, but was not impressed even at that price. The beer was oxidized and tasted like creamy, cocoa newspaper. The oxidation isn't awful, but this beer is a mess. Avoid this one, it's not worth your money. Go buy a sixer of Kostriker if you want a good black beer.","tempest","May 25, 2010"
3.77,10.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Black Radish appears a brown color that when held up to the light shows off it's clarity and ruby colored depth of light brown/redness. Initially appears with a finger of slightly tanned head that receeds fairly fast and leaves faint spotty lacing on the glassware. Aroma has a caramel-like sweetness with a touch of butter and a mixture of minerals and some hops in the backend. Taste includes the flavors led on by the aroma; buttery dark grain flavor with a bit of a mineral taste and some clean hop character brings in the finish with a bit of dark grain flavoring. Slight bit of the alcohol is evident in the back of the throat. Quite a crisp finish with a distinct buttery dark grain flavor that is left lingering in the mouth. Medium to light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nothing over the top but a fairly decent representation for the style.","stakem","Dec 25, 2009"
3.28,-3.5,4,3.5,3,4,3,"D: A decent brew, but it misses the roasted, lightly smoky character and instead leaves a buttery, sour brew that isn't commanding a second one.","argock","Aug 19, 2009"

2.36,-30.6,3,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Dark murky brownish black with little head. Smells funky with some roastiness burried underneath - not what I was expecting. Taste is dominated by a harsh acidic sourness - very tangy. Some roasted malts underneath all the mess add some coffee and smoky flavors. Either this is a bad bottle or this is a very odd beer for me. I tend to dislike sour beers, but that isn't what I was expecting from a dark German lager. Mouthfeel is slick and watery, but fortunately not overcarbonated, so it could definitely be worse.","NCBeernut","Mar 24, 2009"
3.8,11.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall Impression: I think this is a great easy drinking beer to enjoy. It is definitely a session beer. I like how the malts are not lingering around which makes you want to have another drink.","edmedina","Feb 23, 2009"

3.2,-5.9,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This was an ok schwarzbier. The appearance had a thick little head, but it was very bubbly, I guess a little over carbonation. The smell was very malty, with a little hop spike. Along with the strong malt smell, was a faintness of smoke. Taste was kind of like a porter light. Chocolate malt and a smokey finish were the predominate tastes. Drinkability was kind of average. Nothing really stood out for me.","JISurfer","Nov 05, 2008"

4.07,19.7,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Mahogany brown with ruby highlights and a fairly thin head that is gone to a ring within a minute. Good smell of dark roast malts and a light, delicate sweetness. A touch of molasses is also noticeable. Taste is very complex for such a small brew. Some chocolate and toffee with an underlying nutty flavor. Hints of coffee. A hop bitterness is noticeable toward the end, very evidently a German variety. A little more carbonation may have helped this one with its texture. Just a tad thin, becoming a little dry but not crisp in the finish. Not as big in body as it should or could be. Aside from this small quibble, it's still pretty easily drinkable. I actually wouldn't mind another bottle right now. Probably something I'll revisit down the line, recommended.","ncvbc","Sep 09, 2008"

3.43,0.9,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"500mL bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a nice deep almost opaque black with a thin head that diminishes to barely a ring. The aroma was some dark malts, slight caramel and chocolate notes as well. The taste is a nice blend of roasted malts and slight chocolate with a distinct wheat beer touch.

So I would think they would be fresh and good. This is not the case and I guess they have some kind of problem there with cleanliness.
