If you like bready beers like Skullsplitter and Robert the Bruce, you'll really enjoy this. It's an imperial version of a classic, underappreciated German style crafted by two fantastic breweries - one of which (Great Lakes) just might be the single best brewer of domestic lagers that there is.","deadonhisfeet","Oct 14, 2014"

3.78,-2.6,4,3.5,3.75,4,4,"Pours a dark brownish black color with a whitefish head. Aroma of roasted malts and creamy grain, a bit bready from lager yeast strain. In the taste, big roasted malt and a small earthy, woodsy flavor. Malts are full of charcoal, dark chocolate, and coffee. Well rounded bitterness keeps the beer balanced. Full bodied brew with a creamier feel. Overall, this is a big ol schwarzbier but at the same time drinks like a much lighter beer. Does damage to sobriety but certainly not to the taste buds. I'd have another one of these.","Stinkypuss","Jul 28, 2014"

Very dark body (deep brown with a bit of mahogany in the sides), and a finger of tan head. Weak on the nose... a hint of a coffee note and then something (disturbingly like B.O.) uncharacteristic of a nice, clean beer. Malty, just a bit of bitterness, and some alcohol. Wife had a sip as well, and was not impressed either. Watery for a dark beer (characteristic of schwarzbier style?). Overall, I was completely underwhelmed. Save your $$, get an Edmund Fitzgerald instead.","Mikus","Jul 27, 2014"

Weird aroma, aside from caramel and toasted dark bread, I picked up a strange vegetal scent distinctively reminiscent of fresh peas. This was a blind tasting, and though I had no idea what it was, the lager yeast definitely came through up front in the taste, malty, nutty, sour pumpernickel--and once again, tasted like there were peas in my beer. No mistaking a flavor that distinct. Some DMS off-flavors, if I had to guess...maybe this one is on the road to infection, if it's not there already. Light-medium body, but about right for the style. Not something I'd want more than a sample of. There was something off here, and I wasn't digging it.","Rifugium","Beers"

Medium-plus bodied and creamy with a lingering sweetness and a very slight tangy quality. Easy to drink for its strength and despite the sweetness. Imperial Schwarzbier?
