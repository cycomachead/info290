"Black in color with little light seeping through.  A fingernail of khaki colored head covers the majority of the top of the beer.  The aroma is of sweet dark malt,molasses,and a hint of smoke.  The flavor is packed with sweet and gently smoked sweet dark malt.  The mouth is thick, silky, and viscous.  This has a ton of flavor and body for a lager!"

"Very even balanced Schwarzbier. Certainly has the light to light-med. body with the moderate level of roasted malted sweetness. A-very dark brown to black, except when held to the light where it turns a very dark red. A single finger of tan, caramel head that remains throughout, even if very faint near the bottom of the glass. S-very roasty, pretty well burnt, toasty malt aromas. T-really awesome combo of the roasted malty nuttiness with an under abundant very dark chocolate bitter finish. I didnt get a whole bunch in the way of hoppy bitterness or earthiness.O-fantastic, well balanced Scwarzbier, by well balanced I mean not too sweet or over-roasted bitter. A really tasty, lighter bodied ""blackbier"""

"Picked up this little beauty after my beer guru clued me in on Sprecher. Gould it at Super Subs and Six Packs in DuBois. Outstanding looking beer with plenty of malt and smoke for the nose. Very tasty beer that is very easy to drink. A very tasty beer that I hope to have again in the future and I hope to try other of the Sprecher beers."
""
"O: A tasty, very drinkable beer. This American-brewed Schwartzbier gives any German-brewed example a run for its money."
""
""
"Overall: A marvelous beer- light in body and soft in flavor, but still immensely flavorful. Paired excellently with my slow-smoked ribs. A great beer and one that I would highly recommend. Could be a great beer as a soft introduction to roasted malt beers."
""
"This is a tasty beer, fully deserving of the high rating it gets on BA."

"Highest rated beer in found in the cooler of an out of town beer dispensary. Good choice, repeatable. Good beer"
""

"Pours very dark reddish-brown, almost black really, with about a 1-finger beige head that lasts a long time with some spotty lacing seen around the glass. Aroma of roasted and chocolate malt for the most part. The taste has more going on with toffee, caramel, molasses with light coffee. Lots of flavors going on but not overwhelming like some others. Smooth taste with just a very slight bitterness at the end that didn't linger. Overall very pleasing. I like this one."

"Pours a dark brown body with good head and minor lace retention. Aroma is roasted malts and grainy lager like with touches of caramel and dark chocolate. The beer is smooth and easy to drink with balance of roasted malts and chocolate/caramel sweetness and finishes dry. This would've received a higher score but for some reason at times I get this weird oily aftertaste which I assume must be something only I have encountered b/c it doesn't make sense."

"Overall- Very nice beer, easy drinking. Flavors are balanced and go well with a cold winter night or hot summers day."
""
"Not the first Schwarzbier I've had, but it seems to be the first one I've reviewed. I enjoyed this one while cooking up a huge pot of pasta sauce and planning a lecture on the nine point circle for a Geometry course I'm teaching next academic year. My mom is from Germany and she told me once that Schwarzbier is what German women drink when they're pregnant. Perhaps that explains a lot about my own personal love of beer. Cheers!"

"O - There's a good reason Sprecher's Black Bavarian continues to command medal after medal in world-renown competitions; it's that good. This is a dark beer that's a great training-wheel beer for people who ""don't like dark beer"". It's also a great dark beer for people thirsting after a dark beer without the hefty body or higher alcohol. Black Bavarian has the perfect malt combination to balance sweetness with chocolaty, lightly roasted notes for exceptional smoothness and drinkability. May the Schwarz be with you."
""
"O: A very good beer. The flavor and mouthfeel make it a nice sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
"Wish the acrid/metallic character weren't evident. Good combination of roast and toasted malt. The acrid/metallic character goes away eventually, so my score is reflective of that."

"O: Delicious. I have a soft spot for black lagers and this didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed its deep bitterness and it's carbonation is more than I am used to since I drink a lot of porters and stouts, so it was very nice for a change."
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent example of the style. Dark, smooth, well-balanced. Very enjoyable black lager!"

"This beer is the highest rated of all of Sprecher's. It is possible that German Beer is just not my thing but I was underwhelmed. It was sweet, but not in the way of hop lacking. It might just not be what I am used to. I have never been to Bavaria, but from the taste of this beer, I'm not going there anytime soon either."
""
"O: One of the better Schwarzbiers I've tried. A great sipper. Even better as it warms."
"O) Still plowing through the Christmas leftovers. This is one of Sprecher's better offerings."
""
""

"Dark brown approaching black. The flavors of the roasted malt, the sweetness, the coffee tones, the tang from the acid... I feel as though all of these are more pronounced in a schwarzbier than in a porter or stout. The lager yeast just doesn't impart as many flavors as an ale yeast. Not a negative or a positive just an observation. I don't know how traditional this beer is as it's very well hopped. There is a firm bitterness throughout. Personally I feel like this is a good thing because many of the German beer which include a lot of dark roasted malts are overly sweet. All in all highly recommended."

"what a wonderful beer i frist smelled malty and i was was worried but the taste is wonder full tastey wow just a great beer i want to drink all night just a renowned smoothness and a creamy tan head that i lovve enjoy people its a winner for a winter night it warms the soul on a summer night it continues life love this drink smile enjoy"

"Overall, this is a must try if you like to try different beers and I do. This would be a great beer with German food. It's a great beer to just enjoy too. The low abv makes it sessionable."
""
"O: This a good brew – easy drinker – and lots of flavor and aromas."
"Pours out to a nice tan head that laces a bit and sticks around. Black color. Aroma is malty and slightly roasted but very muted which is on style. Flavor is more of same with sweet malt balanced by the black malt and soft hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is on heavy side, but slick and smooth. I love the way this brew feels. Overall, a very good Schwarz."

"Pours a very dark brown with a few ruby, blood-range highlights. A sizable, inch of head, dark tan, that stays with it. Roasted coffee notes, bittersweet chocolate, some smoky aromas, malt. For a black lager, this one has some umph to it. It is sweeter than most black lagers, and while the sweetness is up-front, it's not dominating. Tastes of chocolate liqueur, candied plums, good coffee, malt, peat, a bit of smoke. It's heavy at times, a bit viscous, but not syrupy. A highly satisfying and well-crafted beer. I'd happily drink it again."

"O: I wasn't sure what to expect from this one - it's a schwarzbier, yet one of the top examples of the style according to BA. Luckily, I'm finding this one pretty damn good. Probably the best schwarz I've had yet, in fact."
"Honestly, before trying this beer, I only thought of Sprecher as a good soda company...I have always overlooked their beers. I've definitely learned my lesson and will try more of their beers in the future."

"The beer has a near black body with a soft, creamy, khaki colored head. The aroma brings dark chocolates, roast, charred malt, a bit of dark fruits, bread. Nice flavor. Easy to drink. Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. A touch of molasses in the flavor as well. A solid example of the style. I would drink this again."
""
"O-a tasty beer with great body and easy drinkability"
""
""
"Black beer (go figure) with a thin tan head. Smells of roasted malts leaning towards coffee and a whiff of eurohops. Flavor up front is very malty with notes of caramel. I perceive more bitterness from the hops rather than from the roasted grain. Finish tastes roasty, burnt, ashy and almost smokey. Carbonation isn't too strong. A little heavy and sticky. Overall this is pretty tasty, but the mouthfeel kind of weighs it down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured a couple of times, due to its desire to jump up to the top of the glass. Once it finished, I had a finger of dense, deep-brown head that sat atop the beer like a petulant child who refuses to go to their room when directed. I was going to spank it before i realized that it had the power to spank me tonight, Color was a deep, dark-brown that allowed just enough light to penetrate to show off its ruby highlights. Showoff! Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Hey, is this a lager or a milkshake?!? The taste reminded me of Spike's request for dark chocolate-enrobed coconut eggs for Easter. Spike is NOT The Old Lady, but instead both a departmental colleague and my Lunch Duty partner. She helps me with the curriculum and I ply her with chocolate. In the meantime, this was a great pre-Easter beer. Dark chocolate, coconut, smoke and perhaps some wood all interacted to create a phenomenal lager. Finish was semi-sweet and I felt satiated on chocolate for the foreseeable future. Man, thanks to tone77 for a really memorable beer."
""
""
"This beer pours up very black with a one finger tan head, decent retention, and some lacing. Nose is faint, but mostly malt and caramel. Taste is similar to the nose with there being several sweet flavors including malt, chocolate, and caramel. A small bit of coffee can be detected on the finish. Mouthfeel is okay, but not particularly memorable. A decent beer, if somewhat indistinctive."

"Poured from a brown 16 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some roasted malts. Taste is also mild, light coffee, a bit of roasted malts, easy drinking but just a bit bland. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer but nothing great."
""
"This is the brew that converted me to American craft bier (7 years ago), and I'm glad to see it's still great. Just a fantastic example of the style."
"O: Schwarzbier is one of my favorite styles and until I get a chance to visit Germany, Black Bavarian will be my benchmark to what all other schwarzbiers are compared (and even then I might) so far non have come close. Find this beer, drink it, buy some more. You won't be disappointed."
"Really, really nice Schwarzbier. One of the better examples I’ve had. Robust, rich, yet easy to drink. Nice ’un."

"16 ounce bottle into imperial pint glass, bottled 3/29/2012. Pours crystal clear extremely dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, raisin, toast, nuttiness, and light herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, raisin, roasted malt, nuttiness, light coffee, biscuit, earthiness, and herbal spiciness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, toffee, molasses, roasted malt, toast, raisin, nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; nicely robust with zero cloying after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice schwarzbier! Nicely robust with good balance and complexity of flavors; very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
"This is an amazing beer! It drinks like a sweet, malty dessert. Tons of caramel and chocolate, malty without being cloying... in general, a fantastic late winter brew. It's mouth filling, but finishes wonderfully. The somewhat high alcohol content is not obtrusive because the beer invites slow savoring. As the temperature of the beer warms, the flavor profile becomes more pronounced and encourages even more measured drinking."
""
""
"O-A good beer to have when you crave the taste of a dark beer but are looking for something with higher drinkability. Pretty solid but I think the malt used is just a bit overcooked as it's a little too burnt for what I'd like in a dark lager. Another solid beer from Sprecher."
"O- Some really nice dark flavors yet very drinkable and probably a little too thin. I like this beer every once in a while."
""

"Overall- Great drinkable German dark beer and the best beer from Sprecher."
""

"This beer pours black, period. It has a 1/4 inch head and thin lace. The aroma is of anise, molasses, and burnt toast. The flavor opens with dark roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and coffee notes with a hint of wood and smoke. The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Sprecher Black Bavarian is a good brew, recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A well crafted beer that any stout lover should try."
""
""
"Overall: this is a tough style to do well. It has all the elements for a good schwarzbeir but just not strong enough in the flavor."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite tasty with a pleasant and easy to drink flavor. I think this beer is very sessionable, even in the summer. Definitely one to have again."
""
""
""
""
"Black Bavarian schwarzbier is a subtle, drinakble, and surprisingly variable beer that shows more flexibility than is normal for the narrowly focused style."
""
""
""

"This is one excellent black lager, smooth yet rich. Well-balanced throughout and presenting a lot of dark beer complexity to your palate. Well worth checking out..."

"Edit: Wait, this is the highest ranked schwarzbier on the site? *facepalm*"

"Drink- I am glad I was able to land of one these from a generous BA. Nice balance with good hoppy bitter, roasty flavors."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: What a remarkable lager very well done. Cheers."
""
"D/O- Sooo incredibly easy drinking. Sprecher nailed it...a first for me. If you ever get the ""dark beer is so thick!"" from others then this may be a prime example of how that's just plain wrong. Sixteen ounce bottles...brilliant!"
""
""
""
""
"O: A combination of light, drinkable malts and some darker smoke and wood flavors. Overall pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good example of an American attempt at the Schwarzbier. Very drinkable and interesting. Warming complexity is excellent on a cold, winter night."
""

""
""
"Overall: I would recommend it."
"M- a bit thin when compared to the big taste"
""
"Overall I had to take the overall score down since I can't find this around my area but it was a very good black lager. Smooth and drinkable!"
""
""
""
"o - like I said, one of my favorite Sprecher offerings. Not an overpowering Schwarzbier, but one that's quite palatable..."
""
""
""
"Always nice to come across this beer. One of the bigger examples of the style out there and one of the better in my opinion."
""
""
"O - Surpisingly well-balanced. Really enjoyed this one."
""
"Easy drinking not a palate killer with the heavy malts."
"Pours a dark dark brown. Almost black. Some light white head. Smells roasty but mostly non-aromatic. Tastes sweet and malty. Definitely a lager. Well carbonated. Good mouthfeel. Overall very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall one of the best schwarzbiers I've had to date!"
""
""
"Of the few schwarzbiers I've had, this is an excellent one. I might actually prefer the Rogue version to this, but for price and availability, this is top."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the aroma, but it is definitely worth a try."
"overall: a unique beer from a very good brewery. there is complex flavors, but its not a fill-you-up type of beer like some complex stouts. probably one of, if not the, best beers made in milwaukee. definitely a must try for those in the area"
"Overall it's a nice beer, the only example I've tried of the style."
"I do give two Schlitz for Sprecher Black Bavarian. If you're fortunate to be in an area that distributes Sprecher products, this is worth tracking down."
"Overall: I'm not sure I understand the love for this brew. It tastes pretty pedestrian to me. Just a whole lot of nothing. Unoffensive, but not something I'll seek out again."
"O: Remarkable balanced for big malt bomb. Lots of flavor, not too sweet, sharply bitter in the finish."
"Still getting used to the style, as it looks and smells like a porter or stout. The smell especially reminds me of a quality porter, with rich cocoa/coffee aroma, with perhaps a slight medicinal/bandaid to it. It is in the taste and mouthfeel that I recognize this is a lager; there is nothing that especially makes me want to keep this on the tongue, nor am I reluctant to drink it in gulps. It's a good beer but I'd be hard pressed to find the right occassion for it. Perhaps if you're in the mood for a dark beer on a warm summer night."
"Overall- I did enjoy it alot, was not disappointed overall and would try again to see if it grows on me even more. Cheers!"
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small streaks of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, molasses, and burnt sugar aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, campfire smoke, and some molasses flavors. A very mild roasty bitterness quickly fades after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good schwarzbier with some nice roasty qualities. I am glad I picked one of these up."
"Pours a nice dark blackish brown color, light brown head forms over an inch. Aroma of roasted malts, bready, and alittle floral. In the taste, classic schwarzbier, black malts, dusty cocoa, and a moderate level of bitterness. Very nice roasted malt flavor, mimicking porter and coffee flavors. Easy drinking, dark, roasted brew. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice richness. Overall, this is an impressive schwarzbier. Sprecher does German styles better than most."
"{some revision done with tastings on May 2012 & Feb. 2013}"
"They leave me feeling like they can get the flavor profile they want and deliver, now just follow through on the whole experience and this could be a “HOLY SMOKES THAT’S SOME GOOD BEER!” easily."
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with a long lasting head of light brown foam. Scent is interesting with a mixture of malts with hints of cocoa and coffee. Taste is very robust with roasted and carmel malts, little bit of cocoa, and a little bit of a nutty aftertaste. Has a very nice texture and the taste lasts well after the swallow. Erupts the taste buds very nicely. Makes for a very good slowing drinking beer as it's not something you should consider chugging down."
"Good example of the style. Really drinkable and a great beer if you're in the mood for a dark one."
"O -- Overall, this is a very pleasant dark beer if you're looking for that typical roasted malt hit. But I wish there was just a slight bit more sweetness and smoothness you get from a classic Schwarzbier."
"Overall this is a really good beer that has a high drinkability, good stuff."
"Overall a decent beer. Would have it again for sure."
"A very nice dark German lager, with great toasted malt and coffee notes. Goes down very easy and does not overwhelm, despite its pronounced malt flavor and complexity. Definitely worth repeated pours."
"Drinkability is great with absolutely no trace of alcohol at all. By far the best Sprecher product I've tasted yet."
"Finally a beer from Sprecher that actually impressed me. This beer poured out as a reay nice deep brown color. The head lasts for just about entire time you're drinking the beer. It doesn't leave a lot of lacing but it still survived for a while. The aroma is a really nicely roasted smell was minor hints or chocolate. There wasn't too much of a grassy lager or pilsner aroma which very good. The taste of the beer had a really nice flavor to it. Malty and roasted leaving a dry mouthfeel. Overall I'm very glad to say that I found a brew the I like from Sprecher, finally."
"o. It's a very good stout. Smooth, not too tart, but good flavor."
"Bizarre Food Pairing Note : Coincidentally this beer paired so incredibly well with my french onion soup I was having for lunch, that I really have to recommend snacking on anything with caramelized onions, onion rings, a burger with fried onions on top, etc. Seriously, both the onion soup and the brew got significantly amplified in deliciousness when tasted together."
"A nicely done beer. Lacking in aroma, but that may be the tulip I used (only clean glass I had today). a good surprise from a brewery I have never heard of and I would pick it up again."
"Regardless, Sprecher should stick to world class sodas."
"Excellent example of one of my favorite styles of beer. I seriously thought this was from Germany until I reviewed it and saw it's actually from WI. Nice job, cheeseheads!"
"O= one of the best and robust Schwartz' I've ever had. Don't ruin it with food or worrying about pairings."
"May the schwarzbier with you..."
"o 4-4.5 by about the 13 oz mark this became a sentimental beer for me. it makes me wander nostalgically through distant memories of my german youth, even though i have never been to germany so far as i know. it's the first sprecher beer i've tried, but probably won't be my only. drinking this stuff is not like drinking most beers, for me at least. if i ever find myself defending it, i'll have to resort to something related to my defense of listening to the grateful dead. it's not about technical virtuosity or brilliant anything, it's about the mood created and the communion with ... now how did that defense go? ah well, peace!"
"A solid, pretty much by the book black lager here. Those who are looking for a sweeter, richer schwarzbier are going to have to look elsewhere."
"I'll admit that I was skeptical about this brew when I bought it, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of this beer. Smooth, tasty, nutty, I'd definitely have this brew again."
"O - I did enjoy this beer and would seek it out again."
"O- Very solid brew, 1st time I had it I think I served it too cold, and it wasn't nearly as good. This is a solid, easy drinker that I'm quite impressed with."
"D: One of my favorite session beers. A subtle beauty. Brings back wonderful memories of discovering craft beer and enjoying this one from a keg on a sunny spring day for a friend's bachelor party. Awesome."
"D - A very nice black lager. The strong roasted malt profile reminds me of a stout, however."
"D: Having been let down by the dark lager style before, I approached this beer with low expectations. I went away favorably impressed, finding the multi-layered complexity remarkable. Between the hints of smoke in the smell and the clean roasted flavors, this beer begs to be paired with other savory flavors. As American-brewed dark lagers go, this one is top-shelf--even better than Moonlight's Death and Taxes."
"World class beer... Its ridiculous... Deserves the rating it has..."
"D: A nice malty beer that well represents the style; one of my favorites from Sprecher"
"call me crazy, but if given the choice I'd take a Sam Adam's black lager over this - despite this having that 'exceptional' look and mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel is slick, silky, just a bit creamy. Very light, tiny bubbled carbonation provides the perfect amount of tingle. Drinkability is class-defining - delicious, balanced, and mouthfeel is just spot on. Truly a great example of one of my all-time favorite styles."
"O: I would definitely drink this again. As far as Schwarz's go...this is on my menu due to its reasonable price and freshness from ""across the WI border"". I may find another that I prefer after more tastings but this one works well for me."
"Highly recommended."
"Best schwarzbier i ever had, really enjoyed drinking this one."
"Drinkability: It isn't something I'd seek out, but it's adequately drinkable as well as enjoyable."
"Flavor is light chocolate and some very mild coffee. There's some light roast malt there as well in addition to a very light amount of caramel. Mouthfeel is light and airy without all that much carbonation. This finish is moderately dry. Pretty good, but nothing fantastic. Definitely not a mind-altering schwarzbier."
"D: Satisfactory, in my opinion; nothing too crazy, yet not bad... middle of the road brew for me."
"D: This is a nice Schwarzbier overall. It's a bit heavier than I was expecting, but its moderate strength was a nice compliment to a cold autumn day."
"Taste has a fruity edge to it that doesnt seem to fit in a schwarzbier style profile. Decent roast and hop bitterness though. Malts are abundant, but not as sweet and full as I would like. A little more robust than it really needs to be and I get a bit of cooked veggies on it. Decent enough, I was just expecting to be blown away by it...I like Kostritzer and Monchoff better, even with the travel across the big pond."
"Drinkability: It's a good schwarzbier tweaked with less than traditional ingredients, though I am not willing to say it is a great one."
"Beer tastes better than it looks and smell, fortunately. Its sweet at leadoff and medium bodied. The beer is smooth and creamy with an ashy bitterness at the back of the mouth. Finishes a little dry but not too bad. Overall its a decent beer, but I don't think its my favorite schwartz."
"A very nice beer and spot on for the style. A good all around beer that drinks easily."
"Medium body, light to medium carbonation, this is an easy drinking and super good example of the style. Maybe the best US sample that I've tried."
"Cheers.."
"Revisited this beer on tap after having had a number of enjoyable bottles. While the appearance resembles a porter in color, it is actually a lager and tastes as such. Hints of cocoa, but not as drinkable or tasty as a porter...in fact, it would have been hard to distinguish this beer from, say, a decent lager, in a blind taste test...well, you could taste a hint of roasting, but not much. Still, a decent once-in-awhile beer."
"Everything is great about this beer. My only qualm is that there was no head to speak of and in a black beer there really isn't much to rate it on besides the head. Regardless, just enough roast barley to give that roasty toasty taste without becoming astringent. Great balance between specialty grains and the hops. And it doesn't taste like 6% either."
"Finish is a pleasant light coffee bitter. Nice flavor profile save this one and it's a nice ""lighter"" dark beer that's pretty drinkable. Finish is a pleasant long bitter coffee that leaves you wanting more."
"D: A nice alternative for porter fans. Very smooth and not as filling"
"I drank this beer with nothing holding me back... this is by far one of my top 5 beers to date. I can't think of anything bad about this beer being the style it is. I started with craft beers knowing I loved Black Beers and being a schwarzbier is just that. If you haven't had this beer take some time and get to know it, I really do think this beer deserves no explanation other than a strong push in the, ""Go get this beer"" category!"
"I'd buy this one again."
"You get three fingers of dark tan foam with a center glass pour, moderate density with nice retention, leaves a few thick streaks of lacing. Pure black liquid, a thin aura of orange at the rims and glass bottom. Good deal of smokiness to the nose, sharp but not acrid, furnishes coffee, dark chocolate, mocha, coconut flakes first, slowly blends in licorice, white grape, apple, pear fruit and a glance of burnt grill fat, basic country style white bread, brazil nuts, subtle length. Full-bodied, foams up during the mouth entry but recedes swiftly enough to let its full weight soak in. Pleasing bitterness, the hoppy grassiness and grains play well with the resonant smokiness, more of that mocha and cocoa dust, coffee bean, grilled nuts and vanilla powder, mouth palate coverage. The pork rind and meat fat persists, a nice bonus. Sufficient sweetness to boost drinkability, the fruit more muted and indistinguishable here, close to no citrus presence. Hard to get the residue out of your mouth, takes more than a glass of water."
"Drinkability: I'm definitely enjoying this one and finding that each sip follows the earlier one quite naturally and easily. I'd be happy to have a second one and it's a certainty that I'll be having this one again. Indeed, one of the nice things about this beer is that while it has the rich complexity that is so nice with this style of beer it does not have the intensity or ""in your face"" character that some stiyles have that make you think ""only one tonight."""
"Liked this beer a lot. Sprecher has really shot up in my book lately. My last three beers by them have blown me away. Go sprecher!"
"Pours an extremely dark brown color with a thick cola colored head that retains impressively. The aroma is all dark chocolate, coffee and molasses, with hints of pumpernickel, tobacco, smoke and a hint of earthy hops. The flavor is similar with serious dark chocolate and coffee notes initially, along with blackstrap molasses, roastiness, smoke, earthy hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich and drinkability is good but limited by the intense roast flavors. Very good schwarzbier, a little more intense than a lot of the domestic versions but very solid nonetheless"
"all of the big flavor of a stout, with earier drinkability. could pass as a porter"
"Thanks Nate!"
"At 6%, this is a highly sessionable drinker."
"Deep, dark blackish color, showing a subtle mahogany glow at the bottom of the glass. A small, creamy tan head sits on top. Lightly sweet, clean roasted malt aroma...light notes of molasses and dark chocolate. Roasted, somewhat smokey malt flavor; clean and lager-y. Rich German malts: bread and caramel with light noble hops and a faint frutiness. Light and fluffy in the mouth...creamy and bitter. More and more chocolatey as it warms. This is quite the tasty Schwartzbier!"
"Cheers!"
"A: Thin layer of head, dark coffee in color, no noticeable lacing - 3.50, S: I know it's not your typical aromas but I'm getting a good deal of smoke and jerky, charred coffee and burnt sugar, mildly sweet aroma in a dark molasses way - 4.00, D: Like the nose there is a good amount of smoke on the palate, heavy on the coffee and dark bitter chocolate, mild hop bite as well as some earthy hops, mostly toasty rather than sweet malts - 4.50, M: Medium body and slick mouth feel - 3.50, D: All around a very enjoyable and drinkable beer - 4.00"
"Drinkability: Excellent Schwarzbier that may almost have too much flavor to be as easy drinking as some within the style."
"Drinkability -- Overall, not bad. Would've preferred it have a lighter body, but still a nice option for summer if you want something dark and rich, or winter if you want something with great roast flavors but don't want another heavy stout."
"D: I could probably drink a few of these. And it's pretty because it looks like a stout. Gorgeous."
"d-my kind of lager! friggin great. i'd say better than their amber and pub brown. very happy. schwarzbier's: who knew? i might start buying these more often!"
"Overall although not huge in the nose and taste it's well done for the stlye and super easy to drink."
"Delicious, but much more reminiscent of a porter than a Schwarzbier, as this brew possesses nowhere near the finesse of the finest examples of the style. Pleasing in itself no doubt, but whereas one expects Pils-like drinkability from a Schwarz, this might actually fit in better with an American-style Porter or even a Baltic Porter for that matter."
"It is a good try for an american company, but there are a few German examples that I would rather have."
"I'd drink 'em if you got 'em... but wouldn't get 'em to drink 'em."
"O: If it had a richer nose, it'd be exceptional. Still plenty of nice roasted flavor that's in balance with the beer. I like the touch of sweetness that makes this very drinkable."
"D Good from start to finish and low enough ABV that I didn't hesitate to order another."
"D: By far the best Schwarzbier I've come across. Perhaps I have to get out more often. This beer is perfect for its style. You need some time to put back this 16 oz stubby bottle. It disperses so many roasted flavors on the tongue that you can't stop sipping on it."
"Overall - A solid Schwarzbier"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable, even during the warmer months of the year."
"One of the better beers I've had from Sprecher."
"Porter like in flavor initially with a smooth lager finish, yet one that never gets thin in body. Notes of dark cherry and coffee abound, and finishing with a coarse graininess that belies the style a bit and with a return of chocolate on the close. Feel is pleasant and rich, though perhaps a bit too much for a schwarzbier which limits the drink a bit. Interesting and complex, tending towards an ale in body and character."
"Black coffee with crimson highlights and a finger of whipped mocha foam that leaves superfine lacing behind on the glass. Tootsie roll and cocoa are heavy duty in the nose with a bit of roastiness as well. Rich and chocolatey with plenty of caramel malt and a perfect hop bittering to balance.Full bodied for a lager and creamy with silky smooth carbonation. I'll admit this is not a style I often seek out but Black Bavarian is a fantastic Schwarzbier with perfectly balanced complex flavors."
"I was amazed to find a twist off top underneath a wax coated cap. Is this laziness or intentional to have a twist off under wax? :)"
"Drinks very well-sessionable with the best of its style."
"This isn't a very strong beer and I hardly felt the alcohol when I was drinking it. Sure, it has a nice mellow roasted feel to it, but I guess that a German-style beer would be a bit more bold. I probably need to try out more from this style, since the range is probably a lot greater than the few that I've had would indicate. This would certainly fit the bill for a session-like winter beer for the novice drinker..."
"D: great flavor but not overwhelming, well balanced. also a great value. this is a beer i could have a few of without tiring of it. also the abv is low compared to many craft offerings, another bonus for me in this category."
"D - Being a fan of Schwarzbiers, I was rather disappointed with this offering given many of the reviews I've read... Average for the style at best... Nothing memorable... Really lacking in terms of complexities in all facets that I expect from top notch Schwarzbiers..."
"Mouthfeel, a little thin, but doesn't devolve into something I don't like. Pretty drinkable, not too challenging, enjoyable and reasonably priced."
"An interesting combination of strong burnt and light malty flavors."
"The mouthfeel is full bodied and rich but my the carbonation is too high for the richness and distracts from the taste. The weird thing is this drinks very similar to 8-10%ABV RIS with all the richness but is less than 6%. Usually it is the other way around. What this means to me is although I am sipping this in a pace similar to an RIS I was able to have three 16oz. bottles in one night without feeling full or drunk which was a huge plus."
"This was fantastic!"
"D- This beer is good....not great but good. I wouldn't mind have a couple pints of this and then move onto something a little more....less heavy feeling."
"I could drink the whole four pack."
"I do love this beer, and it makes for a perfect winter sipper. Glad I'm back in WI where they have this on tap at a bunch of places. Gotta be one of my favorite beers."
"I see this as a dark session beer. Not blown away, but would make for a good start of the night beer. Thanks to nappie for this one."
"D - Pretty nice example of the style here - a dark lager with a somewhat roasty character that still maintains a highly quaffable nature that you don't usually find in darker ales. A good one for getting stout and porter drinkers to come around to lagers, or vice versa."
"D- very good, not thick or overwhelming but pleasant flavorful. For me it wasn't enough to order another but I enjoyed it from the top down."
"D - A tasty little number, and I'm proud it is locally brewed. The fact that it is locally brewed means it's CHEAP locally, which adds to its drinkability. (It certainly doesn't hurt that it is delicious either!) I would certainly recommend it to my friends."
"Rich, heavy dark lager. Embodies all the good qualities of the style, and proof a beer doesn't require heavy amount of alcohol to be complex. This will likely be my go-to schwarzbier as Moonlight Death & Taxes is unavailable outside of Northern California."
"D - This is a very drinkable black lager. The malt is rich and complex; so much so that it is almost too intense for the style, bordering on being a schwarz-bock. Nicely balanced and drinkable, with light hops but enough bitterness to keep the sweet and rich malt in check."
"Had this beer from a 16 oz. bottle tonight. Pours a deep black with a good off white head. The bottle says that the beer has a very good malt back bone, and it is right on in saying so! Never have I had such a full bodied lager, amazingly tastes of caramel and malt. An overall fantastic beer! So tasty and amazingly drinkable. My new favorite german style beer."
"Decent brew, I like it."
"-not great for me, my mouth feels like i just took a shot of jager and in that case i wish i would have just taken a shot of jager"
"Purchased from the Sprecher Brewery giftshop in Glendale, WI. Pours a pitch black body with a thick tan head. Aroma of toffee, chocolate and roasted peat. Medium bodied this beer is a blast of roasted malt in your mouth with a touch of smokiness. Mild carbonation gives it a silky mouthfeel. Pleasant sweetness in the finish. This is what a dark lager should be. Terrific beer."
"Average drinkability. I enjoyed the beer, but given another chance, I probably would have ventured elsewhere on the menu."
"Drink: This is a tasty black brew, but just a pint will do. Enjoy the rich flavors slowly."
"D - With the style in mind this is a great beer. I could have a few in a sitting."
"Poured from the usual Sprecher big bulbous 16oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. Smell of thick sweet molasses out of the bottle. Pours a black that on closer inspection in the light is actually a very deep dark cherry red, with about two inches of cherry-tinted foam. The foam recedes without leaving any lace. The taste delivers on the scent - the main character is sweet caramelized malt, with a little bit of bite to it. It does have a slight charred aftertaste I'm not fond of. While the BA description of a schwarzbier suggests they're often light in flavor, this one resembles a porter more than anything else. My favorite Wisconsin dark."
"The mouth is smooth and creamy with just a touch of carbonation bite on the tongue. Big warming bready flavor is all over this beer. Subtle chocolate notes mixed with fresh buttered-bread and light coffee flavor makes this a wonderful drink. There is so much depth to this 'lager,' I could drink this all night. Absolutely wonderful."
"I give this high marks for drinkability. Might be a little fuller of flavor than most schwarzbiers, but not cloying or heavy by any means. Still keeps the lighthearted nature of the style."
"(D)- My personal favorite schwarzbier. Easy to enjoy; balanced and goes down smooth. It is simple but rewarding. Even better fresh. The smell certainly waned due to its age."
"D - Pretty full and filling... great malt flavors and low ABVs make this a drinker"
"Drinkability: I could do a session with this, but probably not now in the summer. More of a fall or winter beer. It's definitely got a unique taste I could see myself craving at some time...I love rye bread and rye flavors, so I will be having this again."
"Thanks to my in laws from bringing me cases from WI every time they visit."
"Sprecher Black Bavarian is a solid black lager with a fluffy brown head. Wooden spice, sweet malt and roast are in the aroma. It's medium-full bodied and incredibly smooth with a slightly astringent finish. Big, chewy roasted malt is the flavor here. It's balanced, bold and simple. The wooden spice is in the taste too. It's almost a touch tart. This is very enjoyable-- a supreme lager!"
"Black in color with light mocha head that quickly dissipates. Roasted malts on the nose. Clean attack that gives way to a heavy flavor of lightly roasted malts (if that isn't contradictory). Sweet towards the finish but still finishes as clean as it starts. There is a mild smokiness to the aftertaste and it leaves just a little bit of sweetness on the tongue. I must say that this is for sure my favorite of the Sprecher beers that I have tried."
"A stubby 16 ounce bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a clear deep chestnut brown color with about two fingers of light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of dark roasted grains, mild coffee and chocolate, caramel, earthy bitter hops. Falls somewhere between medium and full bodied for a schwarzbier and is amply carbonated as well. Certainly worth your time."
"Drinkability well this is just a wonderful beer will definitely search out more in this style"
"Very drinkable dark lager, although not sure I could do more than one or two in a session because of the sweetness."
"D - I only rated it average. I was very gung-ho about drinking it at first, but the sweet flavor just kept building up in my palate to the point where I couldnt finish it. If you sip it slow, its a great beer; don't go overboard."
"The malt has definite sweetness and a little coffee bitterness. This beer has a very nice dark taste, but is appropriately medium-bodied. Not a lot of carbonation or hops, and I like it that way. It's creamy, actually, not thin, and goes down very well."
"Note to Self: Ranked #1 Schwarzbier when I tried it."
"16oz. Pours near black with some ruby and chestnut hues at the edge of the glass when held to the light. Foamy tan head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves nearly no lacing on the glass. Aromas are mainly roasted malts with hints of bittersweet chocolate. Tastes are again roasted malts and chocolate - also espresso. Finishes slightly bitter and dry, but very crisp. Love this style, and this is a great example of the style for a great price - paid $5.69 for a 4-pack of pint bottles!"
"Pours a pretty dark brown that shows light. Sizeable tannish head. Mild nose. Flavor is bringing a lot of flavor. Nice malts, noticeable cooked (but not roasted) grain tones. The malts really seem to thicken up to me as time goes on. Mildly sweet as a compliment to everything else. Feel has a nipping carbonation. Liquid is slightly thick. It's a shame that Sprecher isn't more widely distributed here (as far as variety goes). I'd be very open to trying anything they brewed."
"this brew pours up a dark brown color with a quickly fading tan head... the nose smells like an ale! chocolate malts and subtle caramel... the taste is toasted malts, chocolate, subtle sweetness, very crisp... medium bodied and low to medium carbo..."
"Drinkability= High I guess. Nothing is bad about this beer, but nothing really stands out. It's great on tap if you can get it. Nothing I would seek out on a consistant basis."
"D: This has been at my local liquor store since I began shopping there over a year ago. I always passed it up. Recently I read the reviews on this one and thought at 5.99 for a 4pk/16 oz, I am silly for having passed on this on so often. This is easily one of my favorite lagers as it has a great deal of complexity. I really like the smokiness of it also, not too much but a good amount."
"D: Overall very good for the style. At 6%, if schwarzbier is your thing, Black Bavarian is sessionalbe. Will be having this again. Skal."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink. Very good overall."
"A very smooth beer that covers a lot of bases. Body is medium, but can feel thicker and thinner at times. Weird. I guess that's the beauty of a schwarzbier, big bold malt flavor packed into a lager. An excellent take on the style."
"Recommended..."
"Perhaps it will be a bit better as the beer warms as I think I have my beer fridge running too cold."
"d - very drinkable beer, i could have had another one, but decided to try something else."
"Good job!"
"Overall a well-crafted beer that pushes the schwarzbier flavor envelope without shredding it."
"Overall, a really good beer that just misses being a great beer for me. Needs a little more bitter to balance the sweetness. Since no date on bottle, can't tell how fresh it is so would like to try at least one more to validate the review. It's not available here in Texas but if it was it would make it into the rotation as change-up/semi-regular in the session mix. Do recommend but don't go too far out the way."
"D - I would definitely have another one of these. It's pretty filling for what I consider to be a pretty low ABV brew."
"Good one."
"22 ouncer, with gold wax/rubber covering the cap. No freshness info. Pours the expected black, just a bit of a head, quite quickly departing and then leaves some fine, splattered lace. Nose is of a chocolate milkshake, with a hint of coffee and lightly roasted malts. Pleasant enough stuff, notes of more light chocolate and cafe au lait. Allowed to warm up this one shows some moderate complexity and more nice soft chocolate notes. Nice beer. Worth trying especially for dark lager fans."
"Overall It was very drinkable and and great tasting, if I find this in store I'll pick up a pack for sure."
"Overall, a very tasty beer. Pretty easy to drink. I would have to recommend this one."
"Pours a dark cola like color with an average tan head that settles into a light cap. The aroma is sweet; chocolate malt, caramel with some vinous characteristics. The taste is of stale coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, light caramel sweetness, and a hint of burnt wood. Some nice flavors for a lager. The brew has a moderate to chewy body yet retains the crisp lager trait, prickly carbonation, the finish is sweet. An enjoyable schwarzbier, very good in all aspects."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Pours a dark brownish black with some purplish red hues. 1 finger of creamy tan head has good retention and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of sweet malts and fruits, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and some earthy hops. Tastes of ripe fruits up front along with some molasses. Roasted malts gives nice change in flavor then more sweetness from chocolate syrup, caramel, and vanilla. Finishes slightly bitter with some coffee and earthen hop notes as well as a slight smokiness. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and creamy, sweet, roasty, and bitter. A great Schwarzbier with a lot more sweetness than expected but still providing that nice roastiness. Very easy to drink and sessionable."
"Sprecher Black Bavarian poured a very nice dark brown, even appearing black. Very little head. Smell was of sweet malts, hints of chocolate as well. Taste is sweet and dark malts, hints of chocolate and even a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel was ok, IMO a little thick for this style of beer. Drinkability was ok as well, again felt a bit filling for the style. Overall this is another very good beer from a very good brewery. I have yet to drink a Sprecher that I have not enjoyed and wanted to buy again."
"Clear black pour. Slight brown head that dissappated fairly quickly. Pretty good roast malty aroma. Good roast flavors, malt, nut, some coffee. A bit of poundcake or something like that to make it solid medium bodied. Soft mouthfeel almost creamy. Roastiness lingers in the finish. Has hints of stout/porter, but is neither all together. A good black beer and very drinkable."
"D-A highly drinkable brew. Smooth from start to finish, easy to drink, and still a high-quality and flavorful beer."
"D- I could sit back with these all night, except that I have a plane to catch in the morning :("
"D-Quite good"
"D- a good session brew. something i could have about two of before wanting to switch to something else. pretty good bargain as well."
"Definitely a soild dark brew. Pours very dark brown. I'm picking up a bit of a smokiness in the nose but its mostly just malt complexity. The same follows after the first sip. Rich, slightly sweet, complex malts, very 'full'-tasting- and again with a slight smokiness, some toasted and nutty flavors as well. I really enjoyed this brew- and honestly, I wasn't expecting to. I like the 16oz serving and its a twist off! It paired nicely with some aged gouda."
"D: This is a very drinkable brew. The thin body makes it just slide down."
"Light to medium body. Good carbonation. Easy to drink. A good ol' mil town brew."
"I have no experience with Schwarzbiers but if this is any indication of how they should taste, I really like them, and want to try some more."
"The beer is black laced with hints of amber. Nested on top is a creamy tan head that does not leave much lace. The aroma is full of chocolate, toffee, and caramel. The flavor is much of the same, full of smooth chocolate, toffee and amber. The beer is medium-full bodied, slightly less than your average porter with an incredible creaminess and smooth carbonation. Overall, a great Schwarzbier, very nice."
"Downright tasty."
"Great Schwarzbier!"
"Drinkability is good, goes down easy. Nice to have two in a row. Not the best Schwarz but pretty good nonetheless."
"Comment had this from a sample pack and wish the 8 pack was 4 of these and 4 of the Special Amber, two very good beers that I'll get again."
"The taste did not disappoint either. I was a little surprised on the backend hop flavor that I got, but the bittering overall worked well. Following in kind with the nose my first impression was a toasted dark chocolate bread with a burnt caramel topping (is it lunch time yet?). I did not pick up much of a metallic taste as other reviewers noted, fine by me. Overall this was extremely smooth and relaxing, perfect for a crisp sunny autumn day/early evening. I will absolutely be seeking this out again and again."
"I enjoyed this one very much. I don't usually see this around but if I do I might have to get some more of it."
"Opaque black body with a soap-bubble-like tan head. Smell is sharp and chocolaty. Taste is smooth, sweet, but finishes with a bit of tartness. Nice balancing act between the malt and hops. There's not much to dislike about this beer other than my taste buds can't handle a lot of sweetness in one sitting."
"Drinkability: HUGE. Incredible. As quaffable as a cold iced tea on a hot day. This beer does not beg another sip, it seductively demands one. Velvet smooth."
"A great beer that ranks up there with Köstritzer, the East German classic that rules the roost."
"T: Medium body with very strong carbonation. Starts with a rich, roasted malt flavor and finishes slightly more acidic, but still sweet. In between, toasted, coffee flavors persist. Very creamy and smooth, despite slight bitterness and acidity. Lingering roasted malt flavor. Very good, I like this beer a lot. Very drinkable."
"D - A really nice lager from Sprecher. Perfect with bratwurst I would imagine. Easy drinking despite its dark flavors and appearance."
"""I get a little bit of beef jerky... well, maybe not beef jerkey... maybe soy sauce."""
"Pours a nice dark brown, held to the light is slightly opaque. Nice light brown head leaving decent lacing on the glass. This brew has a nice deep aroma with hints of finely roasted malt with hints of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The taste is bold, but smooth. Chocolate malts with roasted caramel hit the palate with nice balance and a smooth taste. This is a nice brew near my home town in Milwaukee...drink up!"
"The balance leaves you with a beer that's at once complex and hugely drinkable. Starts out with very ripe fruit, super sweet, and balancing that out you have a more mundane, caramely sweetness. This then falls back into a more traditionally Schwarzy middle of dark roasted chocolate malt, earthen and bitter. The end is dry and bitter."
"The sweet malts coat my mouth, yet this is a pretty crisp brew. This is a very flavorful lager. Although not my favorite style, I'd recommend trying this one."
"This was just a really good lightly roasted black lager. I pictured being able to drink this in a half liter mug in autumn and I think it would be perfect for that. Light enough in alcohol and body to be able to quaff yet high enough in flavor to enjoy thoroughly. I love how the mild roastiness and semi-sweetness of the malts comes out over the fairly light body. Really good. Sprecher is becoming one of my favorites, especially since they make the best Root Beer ever, but I digress."
"Very nice. I could drink a few of these pounders. If the price was right, a case seems nice for a warm afternoon with friends."
"Pours a virtually opaque, very dark brown which looks black when it's not held up to the light. Small tan head doesn't last long. Not a whole lot in the nose. I mean, it smells like beer, but that's about it. I can't detect a whole lot in the smell. The nose is misleading though, because the taste is pretty huge. I taste caramel, as well as a roasted, smoky taste. This is an excellent Schwarzbier. Not quite as smooth as some of the others I've had, but excellent nonetheless."
"The flavor is impressive with lots of roasted malts going on, coffee, with sweetness in the middle, and dry bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable even if it is not as smooth as typical schwarzbiers."
"Reminded me of a lighter rauchbier more than a schwarzbier... Poured thick dark brown/black out of the bottle with a tan brown head that only reached about 3/4 of an inch high and didnt last long... Smelled great... bread, toffee, and lightly meaty. The taste however integrated some light flavors of rauchbier with a smokiness and some jerky flavors and sliiight coffee but accompanied by some sweeter malt. This is a good beer to bridge the gap to a more flavorful in your face rauchbier or stout... other black beers I've had were a bit sweeter and subtle. This has a bit more taste and is restorative."
"drinkability - Very nice beer. #1 for this style. i can see why."
"Overall, this is a very easy to drink schwarzbier with plenty of roasted goodness to enjoy."
"Overall, a very good brew. Not the most drinkable - I can't see having more than one or two in one sitting - but on a bottle-by-bottle basis, a nice drinker."
"D - An excellent example of the style. This is so smoky that it's almost like a rauchbier. I would definitely pick up some more of this great brew."
"Nice one Sprecher."
"I vividly remember first trying Sprecher Black Bavarian. It took one sip for me to deem it the best Schwarzbier I had tried to date. Admittedly, I didn't know much about the style back then. But having gained a lot more experience since, I still think it's probably one of the best there is."
"The pour is a clear dark brown color but in the glass the it's too dark to see through. This one has a shallow wispy tan head that fades quickly without leaving much Belgian lacing. Warning, I'm not a big fan that this is a twist off cap...i don't trust'em. The smell is unique. The aroma isn't completely 'roasted', but it's earthy and malt-like with a musty sort of character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied. There is a tangy hop to it but i'm a little distracted that the earthy musty thing has carried into the flavor. Full flavored, the taste isn't chaulky but it's quite earthy. There's some chocolate malt and something that i'd loosely characterize as caramelized. This one is not getting it for me. Feel free. Pour...a person has to know there limitations."
"looks pretty black with a tan head that shrinks up slowly to a lace. the aroma lives up to the dark malts the appearance promises... chocolatey roasted goodness. the malts live on in the taste with a good bit of roastedness, it's well attenuated, with a fine crisp mouthfeel... a pretty good beer."
"Easy enough to drink, but by the bottom of the bottle, I was about dome with this one. Well, it WAS the fourth pint that night..."
"D: A great quaffer for a hot day."
"I heard a lot of good things about Specher and Black Bavarian delivers on those. And I think I picked the perfect day for it. This is exactly what I wanted."
"Really a great beer.Part of a sampler pack from my visit to Illinois so I don;t know if I will ever try it again."
"Overall a stellar beer. I've had one other schwartzbeer, but I don't really remember it. This beer is definitely memorable and is a worthy adversary to any porter out there. The great thing about this brew is that it is so damn easy to drink. Goodbye 4-pack...."
"The taste is similar to the aroma, but lighter. It has toasted malt, chocolate, coffee, licorice, other elements of flowers and spice, a tad like a little good root beer. It has a nice sweet-bitter balance. The flavour is strong and lasting, but incredibly smooth. Despite appearances, it is actually lightly carbonated and has a lively yet creamy feel, and is highly drinkable."
"Bill is the man..."
"16oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. The aroma is sweet roasted malts, molasses, toffee and hints of coffee. The taste is dark and roasty with a good dose of slightly burnt malts, caramel and a touch of smoke. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is spot on. Overall, Black Bavarian is a beer that I really enjoyed and will purchase again in the future. Recommended."
"Very nice to drink - I wish we could get more of this around here."
"Drinkability is average, this is a heavy beer that for it's weight is lacking in complexity for it's weight on the mouth."
" Sooo drinkable. Black, yet crisp and refreshing. (the perfect brew?) Very well done."
"D: I'm generally not a fan of Schwarzbier, but this one is quite drinkable."
"The body is creamy and lightly carbonated. A nice smooth texture. Overall this a great example of a Schwartz."
"this one came highly recommended ; huh, a screw-off top w/ no date, pours a deep garnet brown w/ a thin tan head which dissipates quickly leaving some lacing behind in my nonic ; a sour roasted malt smell similar to an imp. stout w/ coffee & floral/piney hop notes throughout ; a rich, burnt-toast & coffee flavor initially w/ some piney hop as well, followed by dark fruit (dates) and roasted nuts, a smokey, slightly metallic note to the finish ; surprisingly light for a beer this rich, the co2 makes this a creamy delight ; an excellent brew, not just for a schwartz, but in general, a must try for sure..."
"Pours a nice dark black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, very nice tones of toffee/chocolate/caramel. The taste is malty, big on toffee/chocolate/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty Schwarzbier."
"Wow, I absolutely love Schwarzbiers and this was definitley one of the best I've had. Just a fantastic roasty feel that is perfectly balanced by it's complimentary sweetness characteristics. This was my first beer from Sprecher and the great flavor and big drinkibility of this guy have left a favorable first impression!"
"16oz. brown bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a deep brown/black with about a finger of fine bubbled white head. Lots of chocolate and cocoa in the aroma. Rich body with plenty of roasted malt bitterness. Long dry coffee finish. Great complexity, bold flavors. Good stuff."
"D: A good black lager but not a style I'm generally a fan of."
"D-Seriously...this is some great stuff. I was skeptical at first but upon the first sip I was hooked! I have had quite a few German schwarzbiers and while they are one of my favorite lager styles I have had NONE that have this much flavour. Well done Sprecher!"
"Overall a very tasty schwarzbier and representative of the style."
"This beer came with a really nice head and lasting lace. The mouthfeel was incredibly smooth. This is an incredibly drinkable beer."
"Not too bad all around but something like this I'd expect to be a bit more smooth."
"D - This is a very good schwarzbier."
"I would suggest trying the same, easy to drink, good taste, and overall a high-quality bier."
"My first review of a Schwarzbier. I really like the style and plan on seeking out more."
"Medium-bodied and with moderate levels of carbonation. Smooth but just a bit sticky. I remember having this on tap a few weeks back and wasn't impressed; I am glad the bottled version is much better."
"D: smooth, tasty, not terribly complicated, low abv, well done"
"Appears a nearly black ruby tinted mahogany brown hue forms a nice thicket of tan head textured with dimples as it dwindles definitely arose above the rim of my 1/2 liter mug. Lacing is fine and intricate spread evenly, very nice look to it. Aromatics nutty roasted qualities touch of dark cocoa powder with sweet acidic fruit notes arising as well. Flavor is akin to iced black coffee with dark chocolate roasts, toasted nuts, and a touch of creamy caramel. What dominates is a dry powdered dark cocoa, but more flavors arise as it warms up. Light herbal hop presence felt at the end but no hop burps to report. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is lively and the end is dry with slightly burnt coffee roasts and dark chocolate cocoa. Drinkability is nice all around one of the best Schwarzbiers I've come across, excellent."
"I've been very pleasantly surprised by Sprecher's wares, and Black Bavarian will find its way into my fridge again soon. VERY good."
"D: Excellent Schwartsbier...dark malts with subtle sweet and smokey flavors. It is a pleasure to drink and goes down easy. A great session beer."
"May the shwarz be with you."
"i wish i had more access to this as i would drink it on a regular basis."
"The Black Bavarian has a chocolate dark in color beer body with a tan in color foamed head. A malt flavored beer of caramel and chocolate. It is a very smooth and warming beer. I would definitely like to have this beer again and would recommend it in the future."
"Nice dark, almost black body with a rather thin whitish head. Aroma is clean, with just a hint of malt and noble hops in there. Overall, it's just a really fresh malt aroma. Taste is also clean and a bit malty. A nice hop balance in there, but not much hop flavor - just bittering. Mouthfeel is solid. Better than average, not exactly memorable. Drinkability is very good. I really wish this beer was available near where I live. While not the amzing revalation I was hoping for, it would be a staple lager for me to complement my occasional Prima Pils and Paulaner O'fests."
"Drinkability- Was good easy to drink but I had better in Germany but not bad for an American Schwarz."
"I have only had a couple of schwarzbiers, but this is without a doubt my favorite."
"Very good example of the style, better yet its brewed less than 15 minutes from my house!"
"Pours a clear dark red, almost black, hard to see through, big thick tan head forms, drops down leaving lots of lace, solid layer. Smell is sweet and fruity, some anise, caramel, touch of chocolate, iron, cherries, bit of maple, not bad. Taste is nice, iron, caramel, light roast, fruits, rich chocolate in the finish, some licorice and solid roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty smooth. Solid Shwarzbier, best Sprecher I've had."
"D: Smooth and a pleasure going down, by far the best schwarzbier I have ever had, Sprecher has truly made a classic. Highly recommended."
"This brew pours a opaque black color. The head in one inch in height, light tan in color, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, chocolate, and toffee. The taste is like the aroma, but with a little more caramel and a little less chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is one of the most authentic German style beer I have had in America. It brings back found memories of some of the great beers I had while I lived in Germany. I will certainly drink this again."
"The malt is definately on display here. Hints of bitter chocolate and espresso add to the complexity. I don't sense much for hops in aroma or taste which I think would add to the beer as it is very sweet. It feels heavy for a Schwarzbier (Sprecher calls it Kulmbacher) but has a excellant creamy, smooth feel. Just mild carbonation tickles the tongue. Feels a little heavy as I think it could be confused for a stout so it doesn't have the consumption rate of other black lagers and their drinking appeal."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent kick, excellent representation of style. To quote respected fellow BA IntriqKen, “Now THIS is a Schwarzbier!” This is definitely a beer that I could for a very long period of time and was certainly worth the wait. The only thing that I don’t like about this beer is that I haven’t been able to find it in my area."
"Pours a dark black with a one finger tan head that quickly dies down to a thin layer that seems to stick around for a bit. Stickiness could use some help, but there is some. Smell is a sweet molasses with some caramel malt and leather. Some roasted barley as well as a tiny bitterness in the nose. Taste has some toasted malt and a sweet brown sugar. I detect a hint of coffee/espresso as well, but not overpowering at all. Aftertaste has a bit of a hop tingle to it as well as a hit of tobacco. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, and full with a good amount of carbonation. This is a damn good beer, I was quite surprised. Nice to have a beer like this every now and then to take me away from my everyday IPA lifestyle."
"D- a solid lager."
"An extremely flavorful Schwarzbier...almost with porter like characteristics."
"Almost completely opaque black body, slight brown hues when held to the light. Small brown head tops it off. Big chocholate malt scent, some slight roast to it. The main gist of this one is chocolate malts, good amount of roast to them. A touch of bitter hops in the backround. Big, creamy mouth. Not a bad drink."
"D-This is a good Swartzbier but not on par with some of the European classics. Is a bit sweet for my taste but this is a good one to have on hand."
"Drinkability - Big pimping brew here folks, this is a must-try and a gem from the midwest. It's definetly turned me on to more dark lagers and I look forward to more like this bad boy (though sadly, I only have one more of him)."
"Overall: I really liked this brew. I still prefer my stouts and porters but that is not to slight this one in any way. It drinks like a porter or stout but is lighter in body. The taste is in the same ball park, but this one is a little more flat than most. All that being said you have to remember this beer is a Lager... Impressive, I don't generally like Lagers. Sprecher made a great beer here there is no doubt about it. I am not real familiar with the style, but I plan to go in search of others."
"D: Was a little bitter on the back end but maybe that's because I was eating pickels before trying this beer. Very tasty and drinkable dark beer, fits well any time of year."
"Drinkability is excellent."
"Drinkability: bold flavors make up a nicely drinkable beer. This bottle was consumed quite quickly and too bad there wasn't another one around."
"16 ounce bottle served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch and half frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells very malty, like coffee, chocolate and molasses. It's very tasty, it tastes like chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, coffee and also a bit of a smoky taste. For the most part it's a sweet tasting beer, with some bitterness too. Mouthfeel is medium, with a good amount of carbonation. It's smooth and a bit creamy and slick with a dry finish. Drinkability is good, it goes down very easy and it's hard to stop drinking this. I think this is a good beer, I like it a lot and I'd definitely recommend it."
"Very nicely done. Enjoyed it tremendously!"
"Beer pours a jet clack with an OK tan head. Nose is of roasted malts. Taste initially was a blast of those roasted malts. Later sips produce notes of chocolate and a bit of molasses. Mouthfeel is medium bodied as this glides very nicely across my palate. Drinkability is near perfect. This is one solid beer that I wish I could put into my rotation!"
"A medium/full body with a nice smooth aftertaste that just slowly fades away. I could find nothing wrong with this beer at all. Extremely good, great even. Try two or three."
"Drinks very easy, a pretty damn good schwartz, the equal of anything I had in Germany! Shame about the visual, might adjust this if I see better results next time"
"yet to taste a loser. Tasty."
"overall deffinatly one of the better beers ive had"
"Got this as part of Sprecher's Beers of Old Bavaria - very tasty. It reminds me more of a baltic porter and Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout (when it's mellow). The aroma is a bit weak, and the taste is bland at first, but then it explodes with rich chocolate. There's a roasted edge to it that's more barley than coffee, but quite nice. There's a decent bitterness and I wouldn't call this a schwarzbier by taste, but it's quite good regardless. Worth finding."
"overall this is a great schwarzbier. definitely one of Sprechers better brews. try it in a snifter, the scent of this one is wonderful!"
"This beer is a decent beer to make a session out of, but there are better schwarzbiers out there. I'm glad I tried it though. I would definetly order it at a bar."
"Highly recommended. One of my favorite schwarzbiers - and from Sprecher no less."
"This beer pours an opaque black with an attractive amount of durable head. Aroma a light roasty. Flavor is very roasty (lots of ""burned pizza crust"") balanced with a bit of sourness. Mouthfeel is very dry and smooth. Unlike most of its Sprecher brothers and sisters, this is a very nice beer."
" ~ Had I been staying at Scott Street for more than one beer I most certainly would have indulged in a few more drafts of this fine beer. I look forward to my next trip to Wausau so I can stop in and have another. If you get the chance don't pass on the this one."
"Drinkability is very good. Might be a little heavy and earthy for some, but it's bread & butter here. Very enjoyable."
"Black but slightly red. This beer smells like goodness. Roasted, malt, a little coffee. It is one of my favorite beers right now. It is super drinkable and it can sit it my mouth before it goes down smooth and awesome! It has a bitter taste, but it is still sweet and rich. It has a burnt caramel aftertaste that leaves my lips smackin'. If you haven't tried this beer and you like porters, you've got to try this one."
"Poured near black with mahogany highlights. 1/2 an inch of light brown foam dissipated quickly. Smelled crazy malty -- roasted, sweet, even a little burnt -- but not much else in the nose. Some complexity came out in the taste -- the roasted malts diverged into the sweets and a prominent nuttiness (hazelnut?), before a bitter, slightly sour finish. I think it sounds better than it tasted because the nut flavor was too big for all of these other subtler things to come out. Pretty big mouthfeel, and it went down easy enough, but I didn't want another (as opposed to Kolstrizer, which has gotten lesser reviews, but I can down all night)."
"If you're a big fan of Porters or lighter Stouts, try this one out..."
"D- complex and tasty (though that stale flavor felt off, and carbonation felt awkwardly flat at times), enjoyable and drinkable, worth a shot, i'd have another"
"Another beer that reminds me of a porter. This one's a lager so points for originality. Reasonably priced and tasty to boot. Good stuff."
"One solid lager. Bold and with good complexity and a round full mouth. Again very clean and refreshing. Moderate carbonation, and the ability too session for...well a good long session. Toffee from the nose is leaning more toward caramel, and a slight floral hop bitterness helps round out the finish."
"Once in the mouth, this Schwarzbier opens up full throttle. Running straight up to the roof of your mouth, exploding with malts, coffee, and sweet spice; all gently falling back on to the tongue, wrapping around the sides of your mouth, then drying out and disappearing leaving only a desire for another sip."
"overall, this is a very easy-drinking and enjoyable take on the style, i love the 16 oz bottle as well. this one is a staple for me."
"Drinkability: Do you enjoy refreshing, flavorful, light beers? If you do, then you should pick up or trade for this one. Would I drink it again? I sure wouldn't mid another one. If I'm ever in the mood for a light flavorful dark beer, then I'm going to definitely going to pick up a more bang for your buck 16 oz. pint bottle of Sprecher's Black Bavarian."
"Cheers."
"I was somewhat full after 2 of these. Maybe it was just me, not the beer."
"This beer pours a nice head that doesn't dissapate easily and leaves a little lacing behind. It's black and beautiful. The smell is coffee roasted malts that are great. The taste is a bit bitter, but not overly bitter with coffee taste. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. Overall this is my favorite lager to date, so I will be having more."
"This is quite an enjoyable brew, and I am quite happy that it came in a 16oz package as it is the perfect beer to have more than twelve ounces of. Perhaps a touch to hard with the acidity and bitterness in the finish, but enjoyable all the same. Before I know it this beer is gone, so I must have liked it."
"Pours an opaque black color with a 3/4"" head that disappates firly quickly. Could be bar glasses cleaning that makes the head disappear, which always makes it hard t judge beer in bars. The aroma is coffee, chocolate. Taste is smoky, black malt but not overpowering, smooth with a dry finish. This is a good example of a schwarzbier. I would like to try a bottle to see if the appearence and head is different"
"D - My favorite Sprecher beer and possibly one of the best Schwarzbiers I have had."
"D: Seems more like a porter than a Schwarz, but it's good enough that I don't really care."
"This is an extraordinarily pleasant beer. It pours a midnight black with a very slight head that dissipates fairly quickly (a Sprecher trait perhaps?). The smell of this beer is just about right--a yeasty malt that hints at its flavor. This brew drinks very pleasantly. It has an almost sweet, malty flavor that is backed up by significant body. Unlike some of the other darker beers I enjoy, this beer actually lives up to the billing advertised by its appearance. This brew has a very nice body to it that lends it a significance. It is not at all watery and is chock full of flavor. The only downside to this heft, however, is that it tends to make this a beer best enjoyed in moderation, as it quickly gets a bit filling."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a great beer all around. I wish I had more of this, because I could drink plenty. Unfortunately for me, my buddy only picked up two of these for me on his most recent Wisconsin trip."
"A good, drinkable lager. Not only is this sessionable, but it would stand up to more than a few porters and stouts. Will be drinking this one again."
"This beer is great because of well balanced flavors. The dry, toasty malt pairs well with the lingering soft bitterness. At less than 6% the result is a beer with excellent drinkability, highly sessionable in my opinion. Thanks to demcorhip for picking this one out for me...."
"Wow, is this a rich one. Full of chocolate and coffee malts, bursting with terrific high tailed, nutty flavor. Very robust and creamy, great mouthfeel as it is very full bodied. Pours a dark black with a nice pillowy head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. Slight bitterness on the end, but initial booming maltiness. A top flight beer no doubt!"
"A 16 fl oz bottle, this beer has a nice dark color, with a smell of caramel and chocolate that actually resembles a porter, except not as bitter. Smooth and creamy, good flavor to withstand a cold winter night without a large amount of alcohol - 5.8% ABV."
"D: Nice balance and easy drinking. Very good but nothing stunning IMO."
"I first had this beer in 1997 and was my first introduction to the Sprecher Brewery. I enjoy its full body and malty flavor. Typically I like beers that are hoppier. The Black Bavarian offers a a nice balance without being too sweet. Very drinkable even for people who don't like dark beer."
"Thanks to BA JeffKrenner for the bottle!"
"I really enjoyed the flavor of this one. Ill have to find others of this style to try."
"New in town. Aroma is sweet malts with a metallic twinge and extremely faint smokey and chocolate hints. Body is dark brown approaching full black and sports a rapidly diminishing tan head. Coffee, chocolate, dark roasted malts. Has an almost porter like flavor at first, but with a lighter mouthfeel. Slight hints of molasses through the middle with a bitter lingering finish. At times it has porter and dunkel flavors, but never truly gets all that schwarzbier-y. Still decently tasty."
"Drinkability  This is one of the best Schwartzbiers that Ive ever had, to include the six years that I lived in Germany."
"Pours a rich black hue with light brown highlights underneath a formidable semi-creamy, semi-foamy tan head that subsides rather quickly. Aroma of dark roasted malt and a touch of a nutty character that's hard to pin down. Palate is again mostly roasted malt, with a touch of chocolatey lactose sweetness and some more nutty notes. Body is richer than I would expect for a schwarzbier, with a full-figured creaminess more characteristic of a porter. Very tasty and very drinkable; I'm pleasantly surprised."
"An opaque black brew with tiny hints of brown, and a thin tan head that fades quickly. Looks nice! The nose is syrupy coffee and roasted chocolate. Taste is sweet plums up front, followed by strong coffee and hints of caramel. Coffee taste lingers. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both slightly above average. One of Sprecher's best brews."
"Drinkability: Fantastic; if only other breweries would try brewing a beer in this style, lagers wouldn't have such a bad rap"
"Drinkability: Sessionable and pleasant. This was the perfect complement to the baseball game I was watching at the time, and definitely a beer I'll return to. Does a good job avoiding sweetness and remaining true to the style."
"Drinkability is very high in fact about as good as this style can get. The beer is full and rich, taste and smooth. It is well balanced with enough edge satisfy lovers of both lighter and darker styles. Prost und Zum Wohl! MK"
"D- This beer has nice complexity but is smooth and light making it very easy to drink. The chocolate malt and cream offer a great flavor without being overpowering or sweet."
"Black? Yes, black indeed - coal black. Had I been given this in a blind taste test, I'd bet a significant amount of money that this was a robust porter, along the lines of Rogue Mocha Porter. Dark roasted malt, without a hint of oxidation (of course, I do have the benefit of drinking the brew in its home state). Thick bitterness at the back of the tongue and a distinct coffee note. Picks up some sweetness at the finish, with a lingering bitterness that is still fairly clean. Whatever the style, this is a nicely done beer."
"Really a very nice schwarzbier. A big bitterness and some dark malts. If you're in the mood for dark lagers this is a winner."
"Mouthfeel- The malts were awesome moving over my mouth. They mixed well with my garlic enveloped pizza. A little cloying...maybe. The malts I mean."
"Pours a deep black with just the slightest ruby tones around the edges, a thick long lasting tan head, bubbles here and there, lacing sticking to the glass, breaking up into strands on the way down.. quite nice. Aroma, as advertised, is caramel and chocolate malts, taking on faintly roasted and spiced tones. Taste is a nice slide from roasty malts to a dry, bitter, and almost hopped end. Notes of chocolate and espresso, molasses and burnt malt. Mouth is a not as thick as it looks, which is a little disappointing, but otherwise good, mostly smooth with a slight spring to keep things interesting. And while it isn't as thick as I'd hoped, it makes it a little easier to drink, and combined with the good look, smell, and taste, I'm thinking I'll stock this a little more often now. Definitely Sprechers best offering, a classic midwest brew."
"Cudos and thanks to shbobdb for hooking me up with this excellent midwestern brew. I had never even heard of it. Oh, the joys of a blind trade!"
"Well done Sprecher!"
"Muy bien!"
"Very drinkable. Very delicious. It's smell is forgettable, but this beer isn't!"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice complex malt scent that boasts of crystal, chocolate, roasted, and black malts. It's sweet smelling with chocolate notes along with a slightly earthy/roasted edge. The taste is good also. It has a smooth chocolatey flavor that goes down easy and finishes sweet and a bit dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good dark lager. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"Picked up a single at Riley's while visiting Madison, WI. The characters 30108 FL 92701210 are printed on the neck of the bottle. Damn good beer."
"Drinkability & Notes  A tasty lager and my second favorite shwarzbier behind only the fabulous offering from Moonlight. Not exactly to style, but I'm not complaining too much."
"Drinkability: Bold and complex, this is something that should be emjoyed one at a time. Would pair nicely with roast beef or a rare steak."
"Who says there are no good lager brewers in the U.S.?"
"Brew pours to a black color allowing a slight amount of light through with a fair sized head that has some retention. The aroma is of roasted, burnt malts that give of scents of coffee, caramel, chocolate and toffee. Overall an excellent smelling brew. Has a nice flavor to it, with the malt dominant, caramel, chocolate and toffee like tastes. Also a very dry feel to it. This is a extremely excellent brew, one of my favorite styles as well."
"Drinkability: Above average."
"Overall a very nice beer and easy to drink. Sprecher continues to be one of the great underappreciated breweries specializing in quality lagers."
"Fairly dark, basically black (just like the label suggests), with a lively tan head. The smell is nice and malty, with some coffee, chocolate, and a hint of herbal hops. I was shocked at the first sip, quite bold. Lots and lots of burnt malts and a fair amount of hop, with a lager-yeast taste as well. In truth, the taste is a lot like an American double stout, but the mouthfeel is thinner and more carbonated. It lacks the alcohol punch of a stout, but the flavor is nearly as complex as a sipper. It's hard to call this one refreshing, but it is satisfying for sure."
"This is only the 2nd Sprecher I have tried ( I sippped on a maibock in chicago this summer) but I will probably try to sample some more of their stuff in the future."
"Overall, a really nice example of the style, one I wish I could find out here. Definitely worth picking up if you can."
"It finishes dry with a lingering note of dark chocolate."
"If Sprecher Black Bavarian contained cherries, it would be a dead ringer for the beer equivalent of Black Forest Cake. Come to think of it, that's not a bad idea. I'd hate to mess this one up, though, since it's such a fabulously complex, delicious beer as is. Is it the best American schwarzbier in existence? If not, it's damn close."
"dense but clear pour with blood red highlights. thin film of foam on top, very creamy. nose is very nutty with a big hit of vanilla. oatmeal drizzled with clover honey. expands as it warms. tastes great with a big thick and creamy mouthfeel. big roasted malts and overly hoppy for a schwarz. grassy finish thanks to the lager character and hops. oh, and there is a nice even bitterness that hangs around for a few. wow this beer is drinkable and a great example of american craft understanding of a rare euro beer style. havent been the biggest fan of sprecher but this one is the cat's meow"
"Beer is good."
"This is definitely an interesting beer and an interesting style, but I can't say I'm extremely fond of it; it's a camel, with parts from a bunch of different styles. Still, it's easy to drink, so impress your friends and chug a really dark beer!"
"16 ounce bottle. Thanks MABZ!"
"I've never seen such a dark lager before, pours porter black with a decent creamy tan head that fades to a spotty coating. Nose is subtle, slightly hoppy lager smell, with faint chocolate/coffee malts at the tail end. Taste follows suit, bitter chocolately malts balanced out by mild hops with some dark fruity notes. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but its decent carbonation makes it refreshing on a summer day like today which is bordering 100 degrees. Gotta love Wisconsin summers. A pleasant surprise from Sprecher here. Their Special Amber was pretty good as well, but as a dark beer man, I enjoyed this one considerably more. Give it a try."
"Drinkability is good, and ABV isn't quite out of control, but nonetheless I couldn't picture myself sessioning these. It is too rich, and is better enjoyed at a snail's pace. Pick it up if you can."
"Anyways, it pours a beautiful dark ruby tinged brown with a long lasting 2 finger beige head. Aroma is intially very sweet, maybe overly sweet but nice little roasted notes round out the nose. Taste brings me back to Brazil where Schwarz's are fairly common. There is a nice interplay between the sweetness and slightly bitter roastiness that makes this a very versatile beer; great for sessioning or sipping. Top class beer from Sprecher and a great intro into Schwarz's as a style."
"16 ounce bottle. Pours out a dark brown, tinted red. There is not much head. The aroma is dark malts with nuts. Dark roasted malt flavor at first. The hops come in with some spiciness. Medium mouthfeel, but big on flavor. This beer has a great balance between the malt and hops. I haven't had many schwarzbiers, but this is a very tasty one. Putting it in 16 ounce bottles is a nice touch, since 12 ounce bottles occasionally leave you thirsting for more."
"Pours a deep brown, almost black, with a mediocre head. Smells malty, though there's a bit of cream and sugar scent to it as well. The malt appears to be more roasted in the flavor, the roastiness creating sort of a burnt bitter crunch at the end, backed up by a small amount of hops. I'm getting some molases flavor, as well as some milky creamy notes and a nice dusty character that I'm always happy to see in this style. Really a lot of dark flavors in there with out the thickness and heaviness of a stout or a porter, a great alternative. Full of flavor with a medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable. If I didn't know it was from Wisconsin you could probably fool me into thinking this was an authentic German brew."
"A big thanks to goes to Ben for this tasty brew. Pours out pitch black with a good sized foamy tan head. Decent retention and lacing are left around the glass. Roasty chocolate malts are in full force with a great caramel sweetness backing it up. Some bitter dark chocolate and a small amount of dark fruits aromas are in there as well. Very rich aroma. Taste starts off with a dose of caramel before the huge roastiness comes through. Chocolate is noted as well and this ends with a nice bitter roasty finish. Mouthfeel is medium and very rich and creamy. Goes down quite smooth, I could drink a large number of these. I wish I had a large number to drink as this would make a great session brew. This is really an excellent example of the style really wowed me."
"Finishes with a few seconds of lingering bitterness calling for a bite of Brat and cheese at the end of each drink of this fine brew, but alas have none."
"Overall, a very good beer."
"Pours a ruby dark brown/black with a fizzy tan head. Smells of roasted nuts and slight coffee, very mild smell. Taste is exceptional. Slight coffee and chocolate notes, a definite acidic bitterness from the malts shines throught. Hopping is mild. Yeast makes a small twangy appearance towards the end. Mouthfeel is great, very smooth, and full, yet light, making this beer very drinkable. A top notch session dark beer. I love this stuff and am thankful to live in Milwaukee because this stuff is readily available on tap. It is even better on tap."
"I too was impressed with the black pour from the 16oz bottle, with good inch tan head. Could see the ruby/brown undertones when held to the light. Nice, choc lately malt aroma, smooth easy taste. Not quite as much *earthy, grainy* taste as other black beers. Good lite to medium texture and tingle in the first half of the pint, but the tingle died somewhat by the end. Should have had a couple more to double-check drinkablity."
"One of my favorite offerings of all time. Too bad the only local source for this beer seems to stock older bottles. I am sure that a fresher bottle would exhibit atleast some hint of coffee, and have a more pronounced feel to it. I get this as often as I am able to and I enjoy every sip!"
" Drinkability is good very tastey lager will be adding this to the short list of the other two lagers I actually enjoy. Hope I can find this down south."
"16oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep black color with two fingers of light tan head. There is just a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich in roasted malt. There's lots of chocolate and a little touch of smoke to the nose as well. The taste is chock full of burnt malt. A bit of caramelized sugar and a sweet finish. The mouthfeel is solid and smooth. The drinkability is good as well. A big thanks to Kevin (kmpitz2) for sharing this during the UK/Arkansas game."
"Texture is a bit dry, but not bitter at all. Drinkability is very easy with this one....thanks again onecrazymofo....you know a good beer when you drink one."
"I really enjoy this style, and this Sprecher is a fine example."
"Beautiful beer!! Man do I love these dark lagers. This is a dark dark beer, black as hell and a larger rich staying tan head that stayed through several sips and gave a little lacing. It has a good smell of dark and roasted malt with a dollop of fruit-hopiness. This is pretty much how it tastes except much more intense flavor and the fruity hops are a nice aftertaste that stay well with the roastedness of the malt. I could drink this one year round and will add it to my list of things to bug my store about. This is a great beer, thanks to Cretemixer for the gift."
"Thanks to Bashiba for, yet another, great great brew."
"Cheers"
"Good job Sprecher!"
"The label doesn't lie, all black body, tan well-lingering head. Smell is of bitter chocolate malt, the overall malt smell is dominating and rich. Taste is also extremely malty. Very bitter and rich chcolate flavors. Body is fairly thin for the beer, but this is still a good brew."
"This beer pours a very dark color with a small head that leaves a little lacing on the glass once it falls. It has a slight smell of the 'lager stank' at the beginning, but there are some malty notes in there. Some roasted malts, mostly. The flavor is comprised mostly of the roasted malts (coffee), but there is a little chocolate flavor in there as well. Finish is dry. Drinkability is nice. Body is a little light for me, but still good."
"The beer pours a very very dark brown, wtih a finger of tanish head that falls to just coat the beer. The nose tells me I'm drinking a lager initially, but as the beer warms, this lager scent fades. The overriding tone in this one is bitter coffee, with a hint of caramel sweetness. I ding. The flavor is huge on the coffee flavor, with some hints of bitter dark chocolate. The feel is thick, with a nice balance of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good as well. This is a really nicely crafted beer. I like it."
"I typically dislike lagers but this one had a wonderful taste that will bring me back."
"This is an awesome schwartzbier. They must have really ""used the schwartz"" when they brewed up this one. A dark black beer with brown edges and a small chestnut coloured head of foam. The aromas are spicy and nutty with roasted malts in the mix as well. This smells just like a schwartzbier should to me. The taste is spicy up front with a nice roasted nuttiness. The middle is sweeter, and more full with a distinct roasted maltyness. Finally, the finish is dry, refreshing, spicy, and faintly hoppy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfect, as is the drinkability. A first class lager brewed in the good ole' USA."
"Aroma is Dark chocolate and some butterscotch, maybe a hint of roasted malt too. The beer exhibits an average body with a slight syrupy texture. Small yet prickly carbonation awakens my tongue as I drink. The flavor is roasted malt and almost bitter coffee (black patent malt?), I almost want to say smokey as well. Verynice finish of roasted malt and coffee in my mouth after I swallow. THe beer is smooth and easy to drink. A tasty treat for sure. Now if these only came into CT!"
"Drinkability: a very good schwarzbier. good complexity and great staying power. an above average example of the style."
"I popped the cap and there was no sound at all. I was a bit nervous about the carbonation but it turned out ok. Pours out a very dark brown color with a tan head that is kind of small. Sweet caramel and roasted malt come out in the smell. The first thing you notice in the taste is the smokey notes. It then turns more sweet like caramel and chocolate. Very smooth and well balanced. The smoked flavor is not too overpowering which is something I hate. This is perfect. If you are nervous about trying a beer that has smoked flavor, this is a good starting point."
"Appearance is very nice, impressive opaque black. Rich, coffee coloured brown head. Aroma consists of chocolate, deep roasted malt, toasted caramel, molasses and brown sugar. Flavors translate into a blend of the pleasant aromas while shifting from a black coffee bitterness to a chocolate and natural sugar cane sweetness. A touch of black licorice is underlying. Strangely these flavors tantalize but trail off way to soon with none of the oscillating lingering roasty bitterness and dark chocolate sweetness typical of the style. Seems to thin as it warms. A decent brew with good drinkability but as I finish the brew there's nothing left to remind of which brew I just drank."
"This Schwarzbier (?) poured a clear, very, very dark brown color with red highlights, with tan foam that settled and coated the glass a bit. The smell was fruity with light caramel. The taste was fruity (raisins) with caramel and malt. The hops were very light, but there was a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium body and moderate carbonation. The flavor lingered lightly. This was a nice beer, though it did not seem to be a typical schwarzbier."
"6% beer is very good. Best I have had for style."
"Had on tap at Redbones. Pour appeared almost compelely black, opaque, with some cola colored highlights. No head to speak of. Aroma was slightly syrupy and licorice like. Medium mouthfeel, predominatly malty, I found some roasty and smokey notes in the finish that gave some interest to this one."
"Light-medium body, but felt thicker with the dark tastes"
"Pours with a light brown, three-finger head that goes slowly and leaves a good lace. Light to medium carbonation. Very dark almost black ruby color. Nose is chocolate malt. Starts with a rich coffee and chocolate flavor. Finish is sweet with some hops. $1.95 for a 16oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Really, really nice stuff. I wish more breweries took a stab at this style, because it's lovely. I like the 16oz size, it's a nice touch to get a full pint in every bottle. A welcome addition to the MA distribution line-up."
"Very easy drinker. Good lager in that sense. Flavors present more as warms, yet remains light to drink. Very nice lager. Went well with some dark chocolate I was eating."
"This brew is presented nicely with a jet black appearance that includes a decent head and ok lacing. Smell was a bit earthy with a definite malt presence. Malt flavor came through in a semi-sweet character...some smoke notes with a slightly tart finish. Mouthfeel was medium, with slightly oily qualities. Drinkability was just ok, not overly smooth with a slight catch in the throat."
"Dark pour nice but quickly disappearing head not to much aroma on first whiff, it got chocolately on the second whiff and mocha malty on the third, chocolately malty taste with a wonderful smooth aftertaste, theres a little bitterness, chocolate and malt hang around till end, on my top 20 list"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2 inch tall latte-hued head which quickly faded to a small layer of foam. Very dark in color, yet still the slightest of translucency in this brew. Heavy malt nose, with coffee and burnt amlts predominant. Excellent malty flavor, with undertones of coffee, yet smooth like silk. Drinkability is superb, an excellent offering from Sprecher, my definite favorite of the 8-pack."
"Maybe the best dark lager I've had in years. Nearly black with a thick head and excellent retention. Aroma is of roasted malt with a smokiness in the background. Body is full and smooth and the flavor of this brew is fantastic. Smoky malt with notes of chocolate and dark roast coffee. Finishes with a slight bitterness which adds some balance."
"It poured charcoal black with a quality tan beady head. I got a nice smoke and chocolate smell. The mouthfeel is big, full, and very smooth. Excellent. There is a definitely a chocolate overtone to the taste. Great balance within though. Certainly some carmelized malts involved as well. It finishes quenching and toasty. At the very moment you think its fading to oblivion, you are treated to the slightest roasty bitterness. Amazing how it lingers. Really a treasure, I'm very impressed with Sprecher's offerings."
"Among the pale pilseners at the downtown Chicago Kristkindl market is a keg of pale pilsener's evil twin. Pours with a hearty brown head over a body that looks solid black in a plastic cup, then shows brown highlights as I drink it. Kind of a black bread smell thats not as prominent as a stout. Definite dark roast malts against a German hop profile. Leaves a taste at the back of the palate where bitterness and astingency are detected. Roast coffee taste, perhaps a note of pear, subdued by its ""clean"" lager finish. Brings up a bit of a burnt toast taste toward the end that may not be to everyone's liking, but I like its complexity."
"Overall impression is that this beer drinks pretty much like a stout. It has a bit of the creaminess of a Schwarzbier, but none of the sweetness, with the strength of a bock and because of this I've rated this beer a little lower. I've had some difficulty finding fresh Sprecher beers for awhile, but I'm happy to report this is no longer the case."
"Sampled 9/21/03"
"This has got to be the best schwarzbier I've ever had, and I'd be only too happy to try any challengers. If they can taste better than this, bring 'em on!!"
"The taste starts very stout like with a big rush of dark malt but quickly turns bitter and burnt, but without a lot of hop bitterness. Scant taste of licorice at the end. A very interesting brew. My first schwarzbier"
"This is better than I remember Kostrizter(sp.) being, certainly seems to have more body and bitterness. Overall, acts like a thin porter. Real good, but not very substantial. Definitely a quality brew, but this style has yet to totally impress me, as it is so thin. Chocolate and coffee notes (although subtle), very good balance overall. Real cool bottle, though. Thanks for the sample, Monk."
"Black as night with a creamy tan head that fades out quickly while leaving ample, well placed and delicate lacing. Sweet chocolate malts rise up from the glass. In the mouth a sheer delight. Lovely, intense bitter chocolate and a touch of malted milk, followed by creamy mocha. Medium to full bodied yet balanced just right-never over assertive in a sweet cloying way as some Sprecher brews have come off to me. This may be the first Sprecher product that I've wanted to re-visit other than the sodas which are first rate."
"Drinkability: Rather potable. This would definitely be one to have lying around were it available in my neighborhood. One of the better bottles from a recent trade. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the opportunity to sample a world class beer."
"Clear black brew that sparkles with hints of brown and red in the light. Pretty thick black foam tops it off. Aromas of burnt grains. Fairly malty and sweet up front. Hops are lightly herbal with a little bit of a kick. Some very faint chocolate or sugar hints throughout. I think a good schwarzbier packs a lot of flavor and a deep color in a medium-bodied package, and this does that well. Not a standout brew in general, but very drinkable and pretty damn good."
"Thanks tavernjef!"
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is roasted coffee. Medium bodied. Deeply roasted malts. Chocolate is the predominate flavor, but there is a touch of coffee and nuts. Somewhat earthy tones as well. Slightly sweet. Somewhat porter like. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"The aroma is of roasted coffee and chocolate along with a bit of a nut sense. This is followed in the flavor where nice complexity is noted. As with other Sprecher beers an initial sense of sweetness is followed by an amazing dryness in the finish. It's as if the taste evaporates as it fades from the tongue. A lovely finish to a very nice beer that has decent feel and good drinkability."
"Smells of roasted malt coffee and chocolate. The taste follows right along. Decent carbonation and malt up front. Malt and chocolate and coffee in the taste. Good mouthfeel. I don't like drinking this too cold. It actually tastes better as it rests in the glass."
"A Vielen Dank to BigHuge for this American-Germanic Schwarz-Lager."
"The color a deep incarnadine with a resplendent head that is a winsome light tan, the texture that of whipped cream and as it disintegrates a glutinous sheet of lace welds itself to the glass. Nose is deeply malt with hints of toasted grain, somewhat sweet a real treat to the senses. The start is malt-laden and ambrosial with the top intermediate in its feel to the palate. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops purposeful in their spiciness, quite dry and lingering aftertaste. A real treat for me as its been years since Ive had a beer from this magnificent brewery, my thanks go to tavernjef for this bottle gracias tanto mi amigo."
"This one poured a dark brown tansparent color with a tan head that lasted only a few seconds. Aroma was bold of roasty malts almost too harsh for my nose. Taste showed me that roatiness again. Very roasted. Molasses was dominant along with caramel as a secondary malt flavor. Not any hop bitterness but this beer shouldn't have any. There was a chalky yeasty finish that wasn't nice at first but improved as I drank it. This wasn't good at first drink but by the end I wanted another immediately!"
"Feel is solid medium body smoothness picks up some fullness in the middle and finishes smooth, lightly crisp with a mellow tangy smokey lingering dryness. An incredibly drinkable, yummy showing of the style; well rounded and smooth."
"It poured into the glass a very dark brown color w/ some reddish bricking. It was translucent. The head was a tightly bubbled tan color that started out quite large and diminished slowly. The nose had some heavy, sweet, malty tones in it. The flavor has a touchy of smokiness along w/ some hoppy notes. Very enjoyable, very drinkable."
"A beautiful black color with red highlights, it's topped off with a creamy tan head that hangs for a while. Malt, this style features malt and it begins with the aroma, rich malt,slightly smokey, and a hint of earthy hops. The complex malt flavor is chewy caramel, with a nutty,smokey,toasty finish to dry off the malt and keep the beer close to my lips.It has a nice medium body and a very creamy texture with maybe a hint of roast malt thrown in to complete the malt maze. A classic rare style, a little larger than a dunkel but very inviting as a session brew. Yum!"
"One of the breweries I miss most not living in the midwest anymore,all of Sprcher beers I have had I really enjoyed.This one is one of the few I like in this style,and I really like it.Black with some ruby highlights with great creamy head,very malty fruity aroma very appetizing.Sweet but not overly sweet tasting with roasted malt the biggest flavor component,but also chocolata and a very appetizing caramel background.For how rich it looks its very easy to drink.Loved it and will be enjoying again soon."
"This is a very nice American Schwarzbier... nice to see someone doing such a good job with this all-to-neglected style."
"Rich dark cherry in color with a rather good sized dark brown head. Roasted malts dominate the nose. Flavors range from a subtle chocolate to a moderate roastedness. Observed a light-moderate nuttiness that seemed to fade as it warmed. Smokey flavors underscore everything and hurt the drinkability for me. A fine brew that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to try if it weren't for cokes."
"Wow, I can't wait to get some more! Head is solid, but thin and dissipates fairly quickly. Color is a deep red appearing black untill held up to the lights. Very drinkable, with strong chocolate and coffee flavors. New to this style of beer, and getting over a head cold...can't wait to see what else is hiding in that bottle."
"Poured black in color with red hues apparent where light hit on the bottom and sides of the glass. Foamy tan head. Aroma had a roasted malt sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Thin body. Finish has a bitterness to it combined with a robust chocolate malt flavor. Slight nuttiness to it. Smokiness present throughout also. Excellent beer to combine with hearty German fare or BBQ. Definitely one of Sprecher's finer offerings."
"I just wish this was more easily available around here."
"Beautiful mahogany color and a tan head that struggles to maintain. The roasted malt is soooo roasty here that I hazard a guess that some of it has been subjected to a smoker, a la Bamberg Rauchbier. The neck label claims it as a ""Kulmbacher"" style, one that I'm not familiar with. Flavorful sweetness combines with coffee grounds, and bitter chocolate. The finish is medium in length with a breath of stainless steel. Not bad. Unique."
"Cheers to Jon for the sample!"
"This one poured black, just like the name would imply. When held up to the light, it shows a little burgundy color, but still, this sucker is black. I smell roasted malt. The taste is of roasted malt with a very faint hop bite. It has a bit of a coffee-like mouthfeel, which is pleasing to my palate. This is an excellent schwarzbier from the great brewery that is Sprecher."
"Being a Schwarzbier lover, I thought I would have liked this better.  It poured with a thick tan head and deep black in color.  The malty aroma was a little too prominent for me however.  The roasty flavor is much heavier than other schwarzbiers I have had also, but as the long lasting flavor lingers on the tongue, I enjoy it more.  Not a bad beer, just not my favorite schwarz."
"Good head on a hard pour, medium bubbles and a stiff one inch layer.  Color is a ruby-black, lets light through.  A little yeasty in smell, mostly sweet.  Malty flavor but not overly sweet, close to rich and nutty but attenuated.  A little on the light bodied side, but fresh tasting.  Drinkable but not as tasty as a Saranac Black Forest..."
"Lager, porter, stout, beer of some sort. I know its a lager, but it had me confused. Very porter-like in appearance and taste. Coffee taste is prevelent but not overwhelming. Lots of malt in this one. I liked it."
"Big rocky head on top, then microbubbles.  Black body with ruby highlights. Chocolate, coffee, and hops in the nose. Wonderful smooth across the tongue. Great malts, but with perfect balance between sweet and bitter. Could be drunk as a session beer, except it could spoil you. This might be the best dark lager I've ever had. What can their Imperial Stout do as an encore?"
"A beer above all others. THIS should be the beer that made Milwaukee famous!  The other reviewers have perfectly described the way one taste of this beer informs you that no other Bavarian style beer brewed in America can hold a candle to a malty taste that is so rich and complex followed with a burst of coffee and hop sizzle.  Midnight color that revealed a ruby undertone when held to a strong light. If you can find it in a bottle great...but if you can find it on tap....thank whatever god or goddess you pray to...."
"This beer seems black and has a small tan head that is gone within seconds.  This is a beer that you can seemingly smell the thickness.  Great malty, toasty, roasty bitter aromas.  What a creamy mouthfeel.  Feels like velvet as it rolls across the tongue.  Great complexity to this brew.  There aren't any overbearing tastes, but many underlying ones that mesh well together:  coffee, roast malt, biscuit, mocha and toffee to name a few.  I just love the taste of this beer.  It has been one of my reliables ever since I tried it about 5 years ago.  There aren't too many Schwarzbiers available these days, but I'd guess it'd be hard to improve much on this one."
"As a footnote, those of us in Southern Central Wis. should count our blessings, as we have two great schwarzbier offerings to enjoy.  The other being Tyranena's Rocky's Revenge (sadly, only a late-winter seasonal).  You can't go wrong with either."
"Thanks again to Genevieve Futrelle for sharing her treasured Sprecher with us."
