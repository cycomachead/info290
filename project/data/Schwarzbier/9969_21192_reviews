"Review is optional but now it is telling me I have to write one. Well my husband and I are Guinness fans and this reminds me of that beer but little bit lighter."

"Very dark red color. Aroma if clean with hints of roasted malts. Flavor is mild and smooth with roasted malt and hints of chocolate, isn't overpowered by the roasted malt like most dark (almost black) beers are. The body is on the light, but not watery, and is oddly refreshing. Overall an amazing beer, and I was extremely shocked. Usually I tend to like my lagers on the lighter side (pilsners, helles lagers)."
"O:  it's full of toasted-malt flavor with a ton of sweetness, and the oak-wood/baker's chocolate aftertaste is very nice ... the sweet knocks down the bitterness a bunch, which makes for a pretty taste, easy-to-handle brew.  a beer I'll definitely grab again."
"Color is black initially and dark reddish brown in the light. Thin layer of khaki foam that parts after the first couple sips. Aroma is mild with a light amount of roast. Taste is lightly bitter and roasty, feels mildly astringent. Dry with zero sweetness, vague carob and ash. Light dry roast lingers in the aftertaste. Overall it's lightness is an asset when paired with heavier food like BBQ."

"Easily one of my new favorites for the price and availability. You can even buy it in drugstores in texas. It's brewed locally and I have never seen it outside texas."

"O: A great beer! This is one of those that you can session pretty often. I love the black lagers and this one did not disappoint."

"A tan froth quickly folds into a thin layer atop this dark brown brew. Aroma consists of caramel malt and milk chocolate. Tastes of grain, roasted malt, subtle dark chocolate and tea. Light bodied and smooth. This is a flavorless beer with no oomph. Moving on..."

"O: A simple but tasty schwarzbier. Nice toasted malt and chocolate flavors meld and balance nicely."
""
""
"The taste is creamy, with burnt toast, malt and a hint of hops at the front, also with some faint mineral flavor. It fades rather quickly after swallowing to some sticky sweetness with a little bit of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is very light, typical of a lager, though I feel it could have been a little bit heavier and it would have satisfied me quite well. It's refreshing and something I could drink after a hot summer's day, but probably not something I would buy on the regular, though if I had the opportunity to try it on-tap I would probably bump my score up a little bit. As far as Texas beers go, however, this isn't bad at all."

"Pours a clear super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that tastes better than it smells in my opinion."

"I have seen this trend in alot of texas beers . Watery beers that are probably thirst quenching but not conforming style-wise. This beer just is weak. Way too watery tasting, not enough malt umph nor enough noble hop character. Hops taste weird too. Off, almost catty"

"O : wanted more character, but not unpleasant for lager"
""
""
""

"The beer is black with a half inch of beige head. The aroma offers light roast, chocolate, lager yeast, bread. Creamy feel and nice balance. Bready chocolates. Light to medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. Silky smooth and easy drinking. Good stuff."

"Overall - A nice drinker but really lacking the taste I was expecting"
""
"O - Very light, but nice roasted and nutty flavors."
"Tastes like a porter made with lager yeast, complex but ultimately light bodied, perhaps a tad bitter. Wish I could get a hold of this one in my neck of the woods, got this sucker from a beer trade."
""
""
"This is really easy to drink, especially for a dark beer. I'll have another some time, though it wasn't love at first taste."

"Overall: Got this as an alternative to the BMC on tap, and it was clearly better than those offerings, but again - only got it because it was all I could, and would only get again in the same situation."
""
""
""

"A very dark beer. I drank this from the bottle so I couldn't measure the head. The smell was very hoppy with a kind of a pilsner smell. Tasting it the smells changed. Hoppy turned into black ale and pilsner turned into hefeweizen. A bit of a strong aftertaste, but it is to be expected from a dark beer. Over all an enjoyable experience. I look forward to trying more of Rhar & Sons products."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours deep, but still slightly transluscent, dark brown with a biege head that dissipates slowly. There's a nice, finger length head left atop the beer. The aroma is of slightly sweet and dark malt that almost smells charred from the smokiness. The taste is dominated by the slightly smoky dark malt that is slightly sweet in the background. The hop presence is minimal, so the malt gets to shine with this beer. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is clean. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
"Ugly Pug has a lighter body than average, but it does manage to assert itself with its malty, creamy body. It makes a good Schwarzbier session brew and its easy- going nature makes it a good choice for newbies to the style. It would be even better with a slightly heavier, chewier body but it is definitely a respectable effort in its own right and certainly a beer worth trying."

"Glad I was able to try one from Rahr & Sons. Wished I could have had their scotch ale!"

"The mouthfeel has a much more thin and light consistency than I would have desired. Overall, a decent brew."

"O: Good beer but not great beer. A feeling that it is lacking."
""
""

"O: I love going to the Rahr tour and having this on draft. It is a good beer and I love getting it once in a while. This to me is Rahr's most popular beer."
""
"This will probably be my go-to brewery whenever I find myself in Texas."
"This beer pours cola-like with a lot of foam that doesn’t dies down. Impressive appearance, but that’s the extent of it. Not much on the nose. There’s very little roast but a lot of lingering maltiness. A bit of an unwelcome sour bite. Cloyingly sweet. Thin bodied, which makes it drinkable. Dial up the viscosity and I’d call it a good sipper if I was in the mood for something after dinner. I can see why this is a favorite for some but it just doesn’t work for me."
"Overall-I do not enjoy Rahr and Son beers but going to a local beer store that didn't have anything that I wanted to buy I just bought this single for 1.50 so I didn't walk out w/ nothing. However, this is the best of all the Rahr and Son brews i've had."
"Very easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Very underwhelming in most aspects. There was not as much full flavor that you might expect from a black lager. The aroma was very soft and did not tease me into the drink. Never while having it did I want to continue my drink. Easily said, it was very boring. There was nothing great or even good about this beer."
"O - This is a solid beer. It's unspectacular but it was a nice thirst quencher for me that I killed in about three minutes. Wouldn't mind it again after a workout."
"Ugly Pug is a really cool brew. You get a pretty big, though not overwhelming taste of a dark beer while still being able to enjoy a rather light body. That's the schwartzbier style. I haven't had a ton of different schwartzbiers, but this is definitely far from the worst of the lot I've tried. The roasted malts really give you that big flavor of coffee. It's very drinkable, due to it's lighter body, so get ready to put down a few of these without feeling like you made a mistake."
"D/O - Drinkability is low. Besides a slight coffee finish, the flavors are nearly non-existent after about 5 minutes. At that point I am almost drinking watered-down coffee... Would definitely help if the flavors had any staying power, but even then, they weren't incredibly noteworthy to begin with."
"O-well this is definitely a good tasting beer. its fairly mild yet fairly exciting at the same time. its refreshing to get this sort of taste from the low ABV and lager format. i'm impressed with this attempt at the style."
"A little too light for a Schwarzbier, but its highly drinkable. Very nice session beer."
"Overall: This beer strikes an excellent balance between strong roasted flavor and a clean finish. It is good for sessioning and an upgrade from light lagers for sunny summer days."
"Definitely not boring. The smoky bitterness adds a nice pop as well as the roasted malts. This would pair nicely with a grilled steak."
"Nothing too extreme here, but better than I expected. Solid B."
"O: A tad thin for me."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, I picked this up from Central Market in Fort Worth while we were staying with a friend. Pours a jet-black, with no head. The nose had slight toasted and sour malt characteristics. Flavors were dark roasted, with a sour malt backbone. The beer has a good balance, with a smokey-sweet aftertaste. The beer has a mostly crisp finish, with a slight linger to the smokey characteristics. Tasty."
"Dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation under one finger tan head, minimal lacing and quick dissipation. There's some mild roast and floral hops in the nose and a bit of caramel sweetness. Taste mirrors the nose. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, not a lot of effervescence. Extremely drinkable, not heavy at all. While this doesn't rise to the level of Moonlight's Death by Taxes (what does?) this is a fine Schwarzbier and worth seeking out for fans of the style."
"The beer is almost black with cranberry colored hues and a foamy sandy head that stuck around. It smells of toasted caramel and chocolate with a bit of smoke. Tastes like a campfire. The flavor is dominated by coffee and roasted malt. The beer feels light with a lot of soft carbonation and a dry, smokey finish. The Ugly Pug really impressed me, I have passed it up many times at the store and now I'm glad I got to try it, for free. I may have to get me a 6-pack now."
"The reason I like Ugly Pug is because of its ""heavier"" flavors while remaining a very drinkable beer. I don't find it to be a watery beer either. I definitely recommend drinking it after it has warmed a bit."
"Light in body, extremely smooth and pretty refreshing, drinkability is good, certainly something I'd have in the summer or spring, good beer I'll take this over most lagers any day"
"D - Overall this beer was a disappointment, I tried three bottles of the six pack so far and they all turned out the same way, I was hoping just one or two bottles were duds or something. This beer tastes and feels like it's been sitting in an open glass in the fridge for the last few days."
"D: Not a bad schwarzbier. I would have preferred some more intense flavors and aromas, but it's good."
"This is a nice black lager. I have never heard of the brewery until jenray hooked me up with two of their beers. I am looking forward to trying their other stuff. Thanks jenray."
"Drinkability is better than I expected when I added up the scorecard. I'm happy with this brew."
"D: The light body of the beer and the great flavors make this a very, very good session beer. Especially in these winter months."
"easy-going session beer to the max."
"12 oz. bottle (thanks to kjkinsey) poured into a tulip glass. Dark brown appearance with shallow tan head that dissipated quickly. No lacing. Aromas of toasted malt, black coffee, metallic/mineral. Nice dark coffee flavors, dark chocolate, a little bit nutty and sweet like roasted pecans, and some tea-like puckering tannins in there as well. Like the smell, there's a mineral quality in the taste. Moderate carbonation with larger bubbles. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, as with many lagers. Clean finish. Somewhat watery. Flavors are good but don't linger very long. Highly drinkable.I've become a fan of this style lately; and so it's always good to try another interpretation when possible."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with red highlights and a white head. The aroma is roasted malt and chocolate. The flavor is more of the same. Other than the roasted malt and chocolate malt, I don't get much else other than a little bit of cream. The beer has a light to medium mouthfeel with the beer being a little bit watery. Medium carbonation. The beer is fairly drinkable and one of the better beers from Rahr's."
"Overall: This was not indicative of a true German Schwartz beer. However, it is very drinkable...but not to style. I was intrigued by the top beers in Zymurgy mag, but it looks like this was a ballot stuffer. =)"
"i must say a good surprise of dark dark lager with a nice head. smell is just mild chocolate. palate is that of schwarzbier but quite thin, as expected, but didn't allow for much latitude. the beer tasted earthy... and chocolaty... mild bitter and washes thin. not much else. no fruit. and not particularly overly sweet which was a plus."
"very drinkable if you like this sort of thing. not a bad crossover beer for those on the fence about craft beer, as it has the light lager taste."
"The mouth could be a bit heftier, but it does make it easy to session. Give me more black lagers!"
"a decent schwarbier. quite well rounded. nothing really stood out but everything complimented each other. i would drink this again, a fine example of the style."
"I like this beer a lot! Great job!"
"This is very close to being a porter...if it was a tad darker I'd say it was. If you can find it on tap it's excellent...the bottle falls a bit short of this score in the mouthfeel department but it's still good."
"This beer seems to follow what is becoming a Texas tradition of light bodied maltiness with a light hop presence in beers, going by the styles of St. Arnolds, Real Ale, and Spoetzl."
"mouthfeel/drinkability: felt like a meal while drinking, the combination of a dark beer and the bite it had didn't feel right to me"
"Pours a nice black color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger fizzy/foamy light tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some roasted nuts, toffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some roasty notes, and a nice little touch of toffee. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty little brew."
"d - good drinkability, lucky to live in DFW, i can find the rahr beers in many places. i've had ugly gug on tap in several restaurants and it always impresses."
"D - easy drinking in most every respect save the fairly unusual flavor"
"D- I only got about a third of the way through this one before it went down the drain. I'm assuming it was a bad batch and if I ever get to try it again I'll update the review."
"D: Decent beer, I've better of the style, but it's tasty and goes down easily and given the ABV easily one to sit with for a while."
"Drinkability: Not really enjoying the twangy aspect and the ashen flavors are also a detriment; I like the brown bread elements but the beer just doesn't come together very well"
"Drinkablity - Easy to drink with a very pleasant aroma and flavor character. Great session beer, I would recommend this one for you malt heads."
"It could use a bit more heft in the body, but overall a tasty brew."
"Drinkability - this style is very drinkable and very tasty. I can't say that I would go and search one of these out but for the few I had, I enjoyed it. The better of the Rahr brewery beers I've had."
"Not as black as a lot of these beers tend to be. Deep brown, chocolaty color. Smells sweet and like roasted malts. A good amount of dark malt character in it, with a small amount of hops balancing it out a little. One of the better interpretations of this style I've had."
"M/D - A little on the thin side. Good carbonation and well balanced flavors make it very drinkable."
"Easy enough to quaff, but just not as satisfying a flavor as I would like. Sam Adams(black lager) seems to have the six pack a day schwarz down pat. But hey, I drank two as a capper. It can't be too bad. :)"
"D: This was a pretty above-average beer. Definitely my best choice on tap and probably the best beer I had in Dallas, however my experience was limited to Shiner, Negro Modelo, and Sam adams. It paired well with my sirloin steak, but I was longing for a bit more flavor. Worth a try."
"Dark black and opaque kind of purplish. Head foams up to a finger width and then is gone. Smell is caramel and malty. Little smell of hops. Taste is a bit spicy and slightly peppery (very subtle). There is a maltiness that is all around and then comes in a touch of hops to balance it out at the end. Mouthfeel has some body to it with a nice level of carbonation. Drinkablity is pretty high."
"Clean and dry with some bumps and bruises in between, but that's better than sliding down so easily you didn't even know it was there."
"I was hoping for a better brew here. A little disapointing though."
"Verdict: A nice enough beer, but not my favorite Texan Black Lager (that award goes to Shiner 97). Everything here is tasty enough, but there's just not enough of it if you catch my drift. If this was just a little more intense and full, it could be a winner."
"It's the kind of beer you sit on the porch with and watch the cars go by."
"Things go a bit downhill in the taste department, as a blandish roasted malt presence tries its hardest to suggest powdered cocoa, but really only attains a slight caramel biscuit note. Not much in the way of hops, either, and the overzealous carbonation level and dry finish kill off much of the crispness and refreshing qualities for which the style is known. Still, Ugly Pug is a nice interpretation of a Schwarzbier from Rahr & Sons, and one I could see myself having again."
"Pours a dark brown black color body, with a tannish, creamy looking head, okay sized and somewhat lasting. Dark roasty malty aroma, some coffee. A little skunkiness. Some fruitiness too. Enticing. Creamy mouthfeel, light fruitiness, like a hefe, some banana. Not as stouty as I was expecting. Very tasty."
"Kind of bland. Decent, but nothing I would recommend with enthusiasm."
"It's light bodied with nice carbonation and a dry finish."
"D- Easy to drink with a very pleasant aroma and flavor character"
"Taste is smooth, malty, tasty. Chocolate malt, very mellow and understated. Excellent drinking, but not too complex,...just something tasty you can drink again and again. Nuttin'wrong with that."
"Overall a pretty solid beer. Not a huge fan of this style, but I kinda like this beer."
"Overall: This is a very good example of a Schwarzbier and I can't find anything to complain about with it. But I would love to try the exact same recipe with a slightly higher malt bill."
"A very average Schwarzbier, but not bad."
"D- not bad. i could not drink more than a few."
"D: Good schwarzbier, flavorful. One that I'd be glad to drink again."
"Overall a very, very solid beer here with a fantastic flavor. Really snck up on me as I really did not think it would be this good, but this one is defintly a keeper/"
"Pours a nice dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. Nice size off white head dissipates quickly. Aroma of Smoky nutty roasty malts. Not much hop to be found in the nose. Tastes like it smells, roasted malt bitterness in the finish. Bubbly creamy mouthfeel. Medium to thin in the body. I thought the carbonation seemed a bit to high and lessened my enjoyment of this brew. Overall a decent brew, I could see myself enjoying a few of these."
"Overall: Nice beer. A little boring, but not bad at all."
"Pours a dark brown with a slight 2 inch head that doesn't stick around and leaves no lacing. The aroma reminds me quite a bit of a pilsner or a dunkel. The nose is slightly grainy, a hint of sulfur, and roasted malt. The flavor follows suit, without the sulfur. It has roasted malts, sweet candy sugar, and just a hint of chocolate. It's really goes together well. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and slightly under carbonated. This is a really drinkable beer. Good stuff."
"Cheers!"
"All in all a good, refreshing brew I'd like to try again to check on the soap taste though."
"OVerall, an ok schwarzbier, but not the best. A decent beer"
"Drinkability - schwarzes are all or nothing for me. I like a good roasty taste, but a little of something off and I'm not on-board. Such is the case with this one, the tart bit kind of messes up the good roasty flavor, though the second one of my stash went down fine at a street party this weekend, preceded by a handful of Eliot Ness and OTR, so the tart bit was less of a factor."
"Pours dark, dark brown with mahogany tones when held up to the light. Even with an aggressive pour, there is little head and no lacing. The smell is of toasted malts with a hint of coffee and cocoa in there as well. The initial taste was a little bizarre - very biting and almost minty. There is also the sweet roasted malt backbone, but it's masked by the opening astringency. The mouthfeel is fairly light with decent carbonation. The astringency takes away from the drinkability a little bit and this is below average as far as scharzbiers go."
"This beer has a lot of potential, but it lacks fullness on the palate and needs a little tweaking. Howver, I could still have a couple of these. The mouthfeel is a total buzzkill."
"Drinkability is nice but it suffers from the feeling that the beer is a little light. Not bad at all, just no something special."
"When it comes to what are probably the two most well-known beers of this style in Texas, I'll have to give the slight edge to Ugly Pug Black Lager over Shiner Black Lager. Both need a big shot of personality. Bottom line: this little pug ain't ugly, but he ain't no beauty king of a schwarzbier either."
"Not outstanding but definitely has potential to be a nice little session brew.... This is a good little black lager.. Not my favorite style but I enjoyed this..."
"D: Very good. This is a very good example of a schwarzbier, not my favorite style but I will buy it again."
"Overall impression: Nice and drinkable - nothing overly exciting, but a solid beer."
"There is a smokey taste, with a hint of licorice. The flavor goes away fast, there's not much of an after taste to it. There's really nothing to it, which IMO is the wrong way to make a black lager."
"Cheers."
"D - A little too much of a one-note beer. It's not bad, but all there is is roasted malt."
"D-Easy to drink. Light and smooth but still has character. Not really my style, but pretty impressive."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, I could stick with this beer for a while, it’s a good beer to drink when you want something on the dark side but something that isn’t very heavy."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and balanced."
"Very drinkable & very nice take on the style"
"The best of Rahr that I've had yet. Easy drinking. Definitely a keeper."
"Overall, a nice black lager, almost porter like in taste (a smoked porter), but not mouthfeel."
"Thanks CRWills for the trade!"
"This is hard to describe, but, overall, the flavors fail to stand up. I one homebrewed a low alcohol beer that used very few fermentable. That beer was liquid with little flavor. This Rahr beer is similar in that it lacks the intensity one would expect. Honestly, though, I find all Schwarzbiers to share this attribute. So, I guess this is typical for the style."
"Refreshing brew. I disliked it at first, then it grew on me. Tastes like a watered down Porter/Belgium ale mix."
"Maybe my favorite swartzbier"
"Kudos to Travis for getting this out to me and giving me the chance to savor a nice, easy drinking black beer from Texas."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker, I enjoyed my 6-pack. Drinkable yes, but not real memorable."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with garnett highlights when held up to light. Tan head quickly recedes to a ring. Aroma is roasted malts. Taste is chocolate & coffee, finish is roastiness and bitterness. Medium to light bodied, lots of carbonation. This is a good one, a good session beer and not as sweet as some Schwarzbiers. This is a regular in my fridge."
"Thanks to Quaffer for the bottle via trade."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the clear ruby brown brew. Head fades to 1/4"" and holds steady, with lots of sticky coating lacing. Aroma is hearty dark grains, some burntness in there, but a tart fruitiness in the middle I'm not wild about. Taste is not as intense with the dark malts as the nose, but the fruit I was scared of isn't here either, which is nice. Closes with a light bitterness that seems more coffee than hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and soft, and drinkability is pretty good as well. Not a bad Schwarzbier."
"One, no more. This is an average beer, but it can still be enjoyed."
"Though a Black Lager, color is more deep brown. Pours nice with nice head. Head dies down quickly though and carbonation is light. Smell is of coffee and toffee. Mouthful is light. Malty taste with those same roasted qualities of coffee and herbs but not real strong though and body is light. Easy drinking but only partially satisfying."
"I might chalk this up to it being from a possibly not-too-fresh keg, or perhaps this is just one of those beers I like better from the bottle."
"A pretty good interpretation of the style. Pours out to a lighter brown color (sorry, not black), with a light head of off white foam that about 1/2 inch. No lace. Medium carbonation, with bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Aromas are welcoming; yeasty malty notes swell in the nose, with hints of grain and bread dough in the wings. Nice. Taste is fair; toasty malts and dry grains, a touch of mild hop essesnce, some grassy elements. Very easy drinking. Mouthfeel was decent. A fair beer overall. Worth a try. Special thanks goes out to assurbanipaul for the sample."
"Pours a plummish brown with little head, a color I've rarely seen in my glass. I should note this is my first beer that I've had of the style, (glad it's from texas, ya'll). Smell is grainy/smoky, the grain is something I've noticed with the other Rahr I've had. Taste is chocolate, but very watered down. This isn't a bad thing considering this is a lager, but I would have liked to see more complexity rather than chocolate and grains. The mouthfeel is good, and it isn't an insult to call it middle of the road.. not too heavy or thin. The drinkability is high and I would love to pair this with a burrito."
"Very drinkable with a nice taste. Could use just a bit more body."
"I really liked the Ugly Pug. Pat him on the head if you see him, or better yet, take him home for a couple of beers."
"The crisp mouthfeel of lager with the rich malt character of an ale. The dominant flavor is of roasted coffee beans. Just the right amount of hops combine to give a pleasant medium finish"
"Medium-to-dark brown with ruby highlights. Head is small and fleeting. The odor is quite light. Lightly roasted aromas are short-lived, giving way to something approaching skunk. Flavors are of roast and coffee, with that light, crisp lager feel that gives this away as a lager. The mouthfeel, understandably, leans away from being full and chewy, but in the process I think it's a little too thin. I know my scores are pretty low, but this really isn't a horrible, offensive beer, it just doesn't do much of anything for me."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Damn nice black lager. Slightly chilled pours black tinged with red covered in a thin white head. Smells of clean lager with a malt roasty character and a touch of spicy hops. Taste is mild delight, smooth roast and creamy malt slight chocolate after taste that mixs well with the delicate hop bite. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable, Texas is lucky to have this beer and I would not mind calling it my own."
"Opinion: This beer is not a Schwarzbier. I don't really know what to call it, so on it's own merit it is quite out of balance for just about everything. The hops were very reserved to showcase the malt, but there was too much Chocolate and/or Carafa malt to give the beer the edge. There was a lot of toastiness going on here, but too much for the base malts. This was probably my least favorite of Rahr's beers."
"Very drinkable, certainly a beer I could have a few of in one sitting."
"Overall impression: Highly sessionable. Kind of 1 dimensional. Would benefit from some increased malt complexity but overall a very nice take on the style. Recommended."
"This beer was hard to make out, but very easy to drink."
"I dont have much to say about this beer. It is not for me, but not a bad beer on the whole. The label alone is worth buying a sixer. The picture is great and there is a little story on the bottle about the name of the beer (if you are interested in that sort of thing). It is worth a try."
"Deep chestnut color-nowhere near the darkness Id expect from a schwarzbier but a nice color none the less. Good, low roasted aroma. Very nice roasted flavor. Somewhat coffee or espresso like. Good body-holds the whole package together. Overall a very drinkable schwarzbier. Well worth a try. Thanks mushroomcloud."
"Picked up in OneBoxBIF from assurbanipaul. Thank you."
"12 ounce bottle."
"The color is dark brown, with an average-sized, light brown head. Retention is okay. The aroma is a sweet smelling combination of chocolate malts and roastiness. The taste has a strong element of roasted flavors upfront with hints of chocolate popping through towards the middle through the finish. The necessary sweetness rides in alongside the chocolate flavors and keeps the roastiness from going overboard. Personally, I find the roastiness to be too strong for a schwarzbier, with levels almost reaching a weak dry stout. Still, this is a good beer and easily the most interesting choice from the three standard Rahr beers."
"Hands down, the best Texas brewed Schwarzbier I've ever tasted."
"Note about head problems: I have had this from a keg and experienced none of the above troubles with the head. From everything I hear, my particular six looks to be the anomaly."
"Rich, full creamy mouthfeel. Very different from the other two or three schwarzbiers I have tried. This one is a little more robust. Good drinkability. Left me wanting another bottle."
"This is a very drinkable Schwarzbier; I enjoyed every sip. If this were a local, I would quaff it often. It is flavorful and easy to drink what more do you want in a beer? Nothing. Give me a six-pack and a glass and I am sound as a pound. Thanks assurbanipaul. Tasty beer. Great label. Thanks. Try one!"
"I really enjoyed this beer and will definately have another."
"A lot of malt/oaty taste with a bit of sweetness like a porter or oatmeal stout but not as heavy. Light bitter finish with a pleasnt aftertaste."
"Pours out a ruby-tinted brown with a slight off-white head. Aroma is lightly roasted. Taste is a mix of roasted, coffeeish graininess and pleasant bitterness. Finishes dry and quite clean. Moderate body and medium carbonation. I've enjoyed this beer more on draught, but never tooks notes. In the bottle, it's a fairly ordinary dark beer."
"Pours a dark brown mahogany color with a short tan head that fades into a creamy lace. Nose is dominated by roasted coffee beans with some fainter notes of dark cherries in the background. Taste begins with roasted malts and fresh espresso followed by notes of bitter burnt coffee and spicy hops. The bitterness remains in a lingering aftertaste. A pretty interesting beer and another winner from the boys in Fort Worth."
"Recommended!"
"Overall, this beer showed no off aromas or tastes. I will try this again and probably edit this review. When drinking it at the brewery, it was my favorite from Rahr. At the Flying Saucer tonight, it left me a little less enthusiastic. I guess this means I will be forced to go drink it free at Rahr Brewery on Saturday."
"Mouthfeel is light, slightly acidic and biting. Leaves just a touch of stickiness on the lips and tongue. Easy to drink, very true to style."
