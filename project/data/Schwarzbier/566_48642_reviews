"It's good tasting but nothing that stands out among the others."
"How have I not tried this stuff before?  Rectifying that, it pours a deep midnight smoked sienna (nearly black, frankly) topped by a finger of sandstone foam.  The nose comprises mild maple syrup, roasted malts, and a hint of greenery.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with some grass and a twinge of cola near the finish.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish.  Overall, a pretty nice schwarz.  'Nuff said."

"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, molasses. Taste is malts, sweet, somewhat like the non alcoholic malta drink. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an interesting take on this style, and a good beer."

"Overall: Solid German craftsmanship, generally clean, to style, and enjoyable."

"Overall- A decent session beer, refreshing but nothing special."

"The flavor follows with a light porter-like roasted malt. Then onto a hint of German spicy hops. A decent amount of metallic flavor and lack of mid and back palate."

"Overall-Not bad. Easy drinking for something so dark. Clean even though the sweetness on the palate may be a little overpowering."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of beer form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is mainly of malt and caramel-like aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt and burnt toast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an pretty good beer that is easy to drink but the flavors are better on the aftertaste than at first sip."

"Overall. a decent schwarzbier but a little underwhelming. I prefer the original pils."

"O- Very impressed. The body of a lager, with the taste and aroma of something more. Easy drinking, sessionable, and very good."

"Roasted, but carbonated, bubbly crisp and some metallic twang to teh flavor and palate. Some earthy hop flavors helping to balance the metal flavors. Sort of easy to drink, but too metallic for my taste."

"Overall - It smells better than it tastes unfortunately. Still a pretty decent beer but not something I would pick up again. It's just a tad too boring. I can see how this would be a session beer however; especially given the ABV."

"Not bad, but not particularly substantial. The aroma and flavour are rather one-dimensional, just mild caramel malt and little else. I guess I'd like to see a more robust malt character and perhaps a hint of roastiness/bitterness to complete the flavour. Still, it goes down easily - this would be a good choice when you don't want anything challenging. Worth trying."

"Poured into my Monchshof Schwarzbier glass a medium chocolate color with reddish hue through out a 1/2 finger off white head atop.aromas are light with some choclate and mineral notes.somewhat bready with a real tinny/metallic element to it,a doughy chocolate finish.It's decent,not overly sweet by any mean but not overly complex either."
"O: Very easy to drink, enjoyable, and sessionable. Though this appears as a dark beer that might put some people off, this is light enough to be a very enjoyable summer beer. I like the flavor quite a bit."
"O: This beer goes down very easily and is rather drinkable. It is a good representation of the style."

"Poured into a pilsner, it’s a tempting dark amber/brown, almost black, color topped off with a two and a half finger thick tan head that slowly tins out to about a 1/8 inch of bubbles with a tick lacing. There’s a good caramel aroma mixed in with some chocolate, figs, and raisins. It’s light bodied, bitter overall with a good orange zest flavor. Sweet undertones are present and there’s a slight alcohol and raisin flavor in its aftertaste."

"Picked up a single from Euro Market. Not a bad beer, but it comes off like a Euro dark lager. This beer has a touch of roast, but no cocoa. Instead, the malt character has a stronger fruity barley. It's a smooth beer with a slightly dry finish. Not bad, but not a schwarzbier. Eh."

"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."

"Definitely sides on the macro lager side of the style - it's not Guinness black lager, but it's not a great advertisement for Schwartz. A quencher with a twist, but look elsewhere for quality."
"Overall: A little bit to light for me, I don't want to bash the beer, but I could see it being a little more in flavor and balance then it is now."
"Overall: Inoffensive, easy drinking. Just as the Krombacher Weizen was a bit on the ""light"" end of the flavor spectrum, so, too, is the Krombacher Dark a wee bit wimpy."
"A light easy drinker, not bad."
"O - easy recommendation for malt lovers, this one has plenty of rich dark malt flavor, mostly dark roasted without any off- or burnt-flavor qualities. A very fine German dark beer. Reminds me of the world-class Andecher. Despite nearly identical ratings, the taste is better than the aroma and really outstanding for style."
"Pours dark brown with good clarity, and small head that doesn't last long. Nose is light and toasty, with gentle brown sugar baked goods in the background. On the palate, good carbonation, roasted malts, and grainy sweetness. Light bodied. Easy drinking."
"Wasn't expecting such a good beer to be honest, glad I bought it. Easily the highest scoring beer of this style I've reviewed (this is the 12th)."
"Comes out of the tap a deep warm sable with a thick, fine-bubbled light tan head. Malty aroma has a smoky undertone and subtle chocolate and coffee hints. Crisp, malty, lagerish flavor has nutty and coffee undertones and a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Smooth, fairly fizzy texture is rather pleasant."
"A pretty good, decent beer."
"Light body, good carbonation - what you expect from a lager. Very nice schwarzbier, and with a low ABV easy to drink."
"Good taste and low alcohol keep this beer in high drinkable side."
"A generically flavoured, yet suitably agreeable black lager, a kind of macro-Euro essence seeping out of the edges. Not all that complex, but it of course went well with the spicy Neapolitan pizza and expense account."
"D - I keep going back for more. Carbonation seems overpowering below 10 deg celcius."
