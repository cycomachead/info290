review_text
"This is my first review of a schwarzbier. I can't say this one did much for me. Poured a black color without much head; nothing special to look at. Not much aroma; maybe a hint of medicine and booze which I wasn't crazy about. Taste was o.k., it was clean and smooth like a lager. Feel was good. Refreshing. I need to try other beers from this style."
"Cheers!"
""
"I really liked this one"
"Nutty, toasty, malty; a nice Swartz bier that's easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Not really worth paying a premium for, however for someone afraid of getting into stouts and darker beers this is a great introductory selection.  Like a black pils."
""

"Very good beer. Was suggested by local regular. Glad I had one. Tasty."
"Quite a dark lager, almost gives itself stout qualities in taste, but it's lager qualities keep it sessionable, a great lager, and would probably be a good transition beer for someone wanting to get into stouts as well."
""

"not bad but could be better"
""
"The smell was a bit stale. Looks like a standard black lager. Weren't very winningly hints of much. Nice mouthfeel though. Minimal carbonation but still enough."
"Dark but no very much so for a schwarzbier. Mild head and carbonation. Chocolate and roasted malt aroma. No surprises there. Chocolate coffee flavor that's well rounded. Some bitterness. Hint of herbal."
"Dark brown with crimson edges.  Very sweet aroma with caramel, nuts and persimmons.  Tastes sweet with roasted malts and a hint of bitter in the end.  Some dark fruitiness exists.  Light bodied.  Excellent balance on this tasty classic."

"I like this beer. I acknowledge that it is light for the style, but I personally prefer this to a more stylistically accurate version."
""
"O: [3.25] Ironically the taste is the best thing this littel beer has going for it  The appearance is pretty bad, no head or lacing at all.  The nose is too weak to get anything.  The taste was straightforward but pleasant.  The mouthfeel was a little off too.  I really like Unitas Baba - which is a 4% ABV Black Lager and it does a lot more than this one at 5.4%."

"Not a bad dark session lager.  The appearance on this was lighter than I was expecting.  It is a clear, dark red-ish brown that holding it up to the light looks like a nice strong tea.  The half-finger of beige head disappeared quickly but left a small ring around the glass throughout.  The nose has nice earthy tones of straw and wood with perhaps a hint of chocolate.  Its body is smooth with just enough carbonation to notice.  Yet seems exceedingly thin for a dark beer.  All things considered I'd have this again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a short-lasting off-white head. Slight lacing. The aroma is dark fruit, roasted malt and a little bit of earth. The taste is similar. The body is is thinner and smooth, with just a hint of carbonation as it finishes. It doesn't have the depth of a Kostritzer, but is still a good beer."

"Bonus was the bottle. Though it is only 11 ounces it totally fulfills my ""dare to be different"" desire."
"Agreeable taste but not the most complex or satisfying beer in the world."

"It may be unfair to judge this beer with an eleventh hour expiration date and crappy storage. But even with that, it is fairly solid as a mild, easy drinking dark session brew."
""
""
""
""
"I also liked that this was affordable in a case of 12 with the cute bottles and fun caps (rock-paper-scissors) !"
""
""
"O: Very nice black lager that is malt dominated yet balanced. Extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a truly sessionable beer with a light easy feel that had almost no weight in the stomach and slid down smoothly. Great part about it is the flavor as it is quite remarkable for what it is. Chocolate malt forward I got a little molasses, a tinge of hops and some fudge brownie. Tastes a lot like a brown ale with easy lager drinkability."

"Nice beer but lacks any kind of layering of the malt.  Kind of one dimensional"
""
""
"i liak it"
""
"Overall- Above average to good, solid beer- pretty much in the middle. Worth at try and you just might find out why this is a repeat purchase for me. A very good choice if you want to kick back and have a few beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is an okay beer, I just wish there was more flavor beyond the plum sweetness."

"O. Excellent beer, glad I chose it with a great pizza"
""
""
"Overall where this beer shines is easy to drink attributes. Tasty but hardly strongly flavored you could give one of these to anyone and they would like it."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a deep, brownish-red colored beer. It has a darkens, but underlying clarity. The beer has a modest head, off white and soapy. The smell is grainy and smokey...slightly acrid and a bit malty. The taste is slanted sweet, but overall balanced. Not really bitter, but the finish is abrupt. Medium in body and solid. Drinkable and aptly named."
""
""
"Mouth: More heavy bodied than your typical lager, which compliments the sweet side of this brew very well. Less carbonated than your typical lager. Overall light considering the formidable malt presence."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another reviewer used ""cold coffee"" as a way to describe this beer, and while it is nowhere nearly as hearty or roasty as you'd imagine that to be, there is definitely a light and bright ""breakfast coffee"" character going on. Low part of roasted malt on the palate with anise and some woody, herbal qualities in the hop bitterness. The bitterness is low but crisp, and the mouthfeel is silky and smooth due to the low carbonation and full body. Sessionable for sure; the easiest drinking dark lager around."
"D: A nice little dark lager. Fair amount of coffee roast and licorice flavors packaged up in a nice sessionable format."

"Not really black, it pours a clear, deep mahogany with thin off-white head and little to no lacing. Aroma of roasted malt. Coffee and faint dark chocolate notes dominate the palate. Light bodied with light carbonation. Overall, a drinkable beer that has light attributes for a dark beer."
""
"O: A decent stab at the style. Perfectly drinkable, though not as technical and well rounded as the better Schwarzbier-type brews out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich and smooth, has some heft without being debilitating. This was my first beer of the fest, and was a good way to kick the entire session off. In a perfect world, I would have made several trips to the Full Sail booth and imbibed this all afternoon long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not a bad brew but I think the excessive burnt roasted malt goes just a tad overboard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol was good in this and had I bought more, I could have downed a few more in one sitting. Even though it's muggy as anything outside, I enjoyed this beer and thought that it fit the description of what a good Schwarzbier should be. Not as roasted as a Porter, full as a Stout, or roasted and sticky as a Scotch Ale, this has a nice niche of its own and is one of the few dark beers that could be enjoyed year-round. Certainly worthy of the ""Session"" on the side of the bottle!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a pill bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a ruby-brown coloring with a thin ring of film on the surface. Aromas of sweet nut and hints of smoke, with a grainy backbone and charcoal notes. Flavors of smoke and rich, robust toffee and nut. Very balanced, but light. Thin, smooth body with a crisp, clean finish. Smokey sweet aftertaste, with no real linger. Very easy to drink."
"Tastes just like the old school dark lagers you used to find at Shakey's and the other pizza joints. Actually, it's a lot like Pabst Bock from the 70s, though this does have a hint of hops. From the 12 oz stubby bought at Trader Joe's."
""
"Overall: A nice, sessionable, yet flavorful Schwarzbier, and a fairly good example of the style. The watery quality does detract from the beer, however."
""
""
""
"Appears a beautiful black beer with ruby cola highlights, dark tan head light whimsical lacing left behind it's everything I want in a beer so far. The nose is earthy hops with a kiss of roasted far caramel notes. The flavor is just as expressive with dark malts and pure sexiness than any other dark lager on the market these brewers nailed the essence of a session beer! Light bodied on the palate but balanced to perfection never feeling watered down this is beer everyone can and will embrace."
""
""
""
"Notes: It's good to see this style there are not too many of them and this one is very drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's not going to make the front page of the NYT for setting the beer world ablaze, but it's certainly quite drinkable, and was well worth the price. A tasty beer doesn't have to set records or blaze new territory to be enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent roasty, easy-to-drink black lager"
""
""
""
"small bottle big taste best schwarzbier i have had in a while pours black in a glass of course its short dark and drinkable so enjoy smells cold and crisp taste smooth and nice a easy drinking beer sit back and enjoy this beer not a bad sip in the whole glass drink and enjoy and smile when you do it"
""
""
""
"O: A simple dark lager that gets the job done, but not in an interesting or flashy manner. Not bad, just simplistic to a fault."
""

"A nice Schwarzbier worth checking out if you're a fan of the style."
""
""
"Though it might lack in flavor and depth it is a good beer and I could drink it all day."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 11 oz. bottle.Yes, 11 oz. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some smokiness. Taste is roasted malts, smoke, a bit of hops, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a pretty good beer."
""
"Overall a fairly well done Schwarzbier ""light"" worth a single purchase but I would still reach for better crafted takes on the style with the same ABV and more flavor. German made ones to be more specific."
""
"My aggro pour created a cascading action that eventually settled into nearly three fingers of dense, deep-tan head that looked like the top of a root beer float. Its retention was such that I held it up to the light to check for color and clarity only to be flabbergasted by its ruby color and stunning clarity. Nose smelled of dark chocolate and freshly dug soil. Earthy as all get-out! That they could accomplish this in a lager is amazing. We make some great lagers here in PA, thanks to our German heritage, but this is great for a west coast concern. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and I was getting flavors of dark chocolate, smoke, tobacco and earth in the mouth. Finish was semi-dry and very tasty with the smoky chocolaty flavor really lingering. I might try this out on my work colleague, Spike, who is not generally a fan of beer. I almost forgot to mention the lovely sticky lacing that remained in my glass. It may require a jackhammer to remove."
""
""
"O - the look and aroma were marginal but the flavour and drinkability tke this brew home, a nice example of a style that I don't see very often, alway nice to find a dark flavourful brew that is light in body"
"O-This beer is a pleasant surprise for me. In particular, the mouthfeel is a nice match for the flavors. It is a touch sweet and not terribly complex, and if I were really a stickler for judging on style, my rating would drop a bit, but for being a month past due, I find it reasonably tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Can only be consumed in pairs, as the cap has Rock, Paper, or Scissors printed underneath ;)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Knowing Full Sail, this does what they meant it to do. Not approaching a German Schwarz for depth or roastiness, but so drinkable. ""Session", indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: lightly flavored and smooth for the style, clean finish"
""
"O: a decent Schwatzbier. Would have liked a tad more earthy flavors and char. Seems just a tad sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from an 11 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a black color (no shock) but with very little head, leaves a tiny bit of lacing. Smells of dark roasted malt, a little chocolate, not much else. Tastes of dark malt, not much else, but quite watery. Beer is slightly overcarbonated, but its light body makes it quite sessionable. Overall, a very slightly above average beer."
""
"Food pairing - I try the beer with Spanish Olives, sharp cheddar, white Colby cheese, sweet chicken, teryiaki pork. All foods did not pair as well as I had expected."

"This is a premium dark Lager. Very simular to Black Butte Porter. My all time favorite in the dark variety is, the Abyss and the Dogfish, Paulo Santo Marron.I would consider this in a very simular field. If you are looking for a high quality Dark Lager this is a fantastic choice."
""
""
""
""
"This beer comes in an 11oz stubby bottle similar to red stripe Jamaican lager ,just the bottle .it is a dark cola color lager ,the aroma is slightly sweet but not to much just right for my likeing ,chocolate nicely carbonated just makes it a very drinkable beautiful bodies beer ,my brother introduced the red session n i desided to try the session black ....now easily one of my favorite beers gotta have a pack in my fridge typa beer I love it ! Thank you full sail brewing company :)"
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is light, refreshing and easy drinking. The name session is fitting here to the fullest extent. You could effortlessly crush several of these in a sitting. This would be an interesting introductory brew for people who are scared of flavor or dark beers. Think premium lager but with a visual identity crisis and the faintest amount of dark grain flavor that is quite soft and squishy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Session Black pours from the 11 ounce stubby bottle a deep, deep ruby red with a decent cap of foam above. The aroma is flush with dark bready malt and a very subtle underpinning of chocolate. The beer is carbonated on the palate and smooth as it rolls back. Cocoa flavors mix into a pleasant malt profile of dark bread, becoming slightly bitter at the end. The hops add additional earthy bitterness and leave the palate dry. This is an easy drinking brew, and tasty to boot."
"There is plenty to enjoy with Session Black Lager. It's very well constructed across the board."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not much going on here. At least it goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I received my first sample of Session Black Premium Dark Lager free from a good friend. Was not sure what to make of this beer from the looks, I was expecting a normal stout. Pulled from the cold fridge and poured into a glass, out flowed the deepest mahogany color with an off-white head. I wanted to allow time for this beer to breathe, nonetheless for unknown reasons I was compelled to quaff it down and was hit with pallet punch of flavors. The aromas of coffee, black cherry and licorice are mixed in with lightly roasted malts and a bit of dark chocolate. I enjoyed every minute of this beer immensely, regrettably some people might find this similar to Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose is malts, a little citrus fruit, and maybe a touch of coffee. Tastes more strongly of coffee than in aroma, with same citrus tang which seems to provide the flavor balance rather than a pronounced hop flavor. Dry, brittle molasses and malt provide the majority of the body. Plenty of carbonation and lack of stickiness or heaviness do make it quite sessionable, along with low gravity."
"Smooth medium sized body with brisk carbonation. Roasted malt with a touch of caramel flows in pungent chocolate which is washed away into an amazing balancing act thanks to the hops. While the flavors are mostly subtle except for the pungent flavor bomb on the mid-palate, theres lots of subtle complexities of charcoal and dark fruit, plums, black berries, cherries and raspberries. Extremely sessionable with bold flavors, and subtle ones if you want look for them. This beer is meant to be drank cold though! and actually, i think it tastes better straight from the bottle rather than a glass. Once this beer warms, those nice roasted chocolate notes become harsh and medicinal. Just keep it cold and you have one of the most flavorful session beers around."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has some roasted malt, as well as some cocoa and a hint of dark fruit. The aroma is fairly sweet overall. The flavor is has some roasted malt and chocolate, as well as a hint of smoke. There is also a little bit of hop bitterness, but not any real hop flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Medium-light body, crisp but smooth carbonation, drinks clean and goes down pretty easily. Refreshing and certainly sessionable but bland and ultimately forgettable."
"Overall, this is a reasonably priced and very refreshing drink but I doubt that I would want to purchase it again. I would like to try some of their others and see if they can do a decent ale."

"average beer all the way around, but very easy to drink in ""session"". nice color, no smell to speak of, no real taste, but an easy going, easy drinking dark lager which is a little easier than its 'lighter' cousin which is only a 5.0%..."
"Almost no noticeable smell, if any, slight coffee."
""
"Overall - A fine drinking black lager. Nothing great, but it lives up to it's namesake; definitely a Session beer."
""
"I dig, got a 12er and you could drink the whole thing in one night for sure if you really wanted to."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - True to it's name this is the near perfect session beer. It's easy not to over-think this one, just drink and enjoy. Probably the best taste-to-price ratio in it's class. I could easily take down a 12 pack over a weekend, and it packs a good buzz, too!"
""
"D - The aroma is surprisingly excellent but the flavor profile doesn't quite follow through on this. In addition to being a bit less complex than the nose, it has an unbalanced sweetness that hurts the overall drinkability."
"Poured into a 12oz. dimpled mug. Light tan head, deep brown almost cola-like color. Sweet malt nose with some dark roastiness backing it. Sweetness giving away to roasted grain then a hint of cocoa. Light refreshing mouthfeel. Gentle carbonation, finishes light and slightly chocolaty. The name says it all, a great session beer..picked up a 12 pack of the stubby bottles and will surely put most of them away by evening's end."
""
"A very delicious dark lager. Rich without feeling or tasting heavy. Plenty of dark grain taste wrapped up in a lager smooth body. This is a year-round standby for me..."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep coppery brown with a decent, if not persistent, pale tan head. Malty aroma has a caramel undertone and a hint of coffee. Firm flavor is mainly malty plus notes of caramel and coffee of typical quality, as well as just a hint of cloves. Body is about average, though there is a decent amount of fizz. Yes, a good sipping beer, to sample now and then whilst taking in a good book or hobnobbing at a party."
""
""
""
""
"11 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours brown with a thick, long lasting beige head. Aroma is of bready malt and grassy hops. Body is medium, slightly crisp and creamy. Grassy hops, toasted, bready malt and brown sugar fill the mouth. Finish is long astringent with some saltiness. Not a bad brew but the finish spoils impression."
"O= overall I sure wish they sold this stuff on a regular basis around here, especially at the $11.99 for 12-pack price quoted in an earlier review. A decent solid entry in the traditional Schwarzbier category."
"Overall: I don't like licorice so those notes I want to avoid. Its better than I was expecting but the body wasnt as full as I wanted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can definitely see myself enjoying these on a regular basis. That would almost seem to be what Session is going for. It’s different, but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t good. Full Sail claims that Session will appeal to all beer drinkers, whether they be the craft beer-types, import drinkers or those looking for something to drink while they mow the lawn. I don’t know how well those claims will really hold up (there are some fairly rigid personalities in those demographics), but I can see someone who just likes good beer making Session one of their regular brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though it is somewhat average, I will definitely be buying this again. A bottle 12-pack costs about $15 in my area."
""
"Pours a semitransparent quite dark brown raising very minimal head that dissipates to a tan ring. Looks like flat cola. Aroma is roasty malt, molasses, licorice, and lettuce/brussels sprouts. Has a decent swarzbier taste, roasty malt with sweetish notes of molasses, licorice, coffee, dark chocolate followed by a leafy, lettucey hop character. A bit misnamed to me - I wouldn't session this; decent enough but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer and definitely an easy one to drink. I could easily go through a couple of these in an evening."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid brew for the price, I picked a 12-pack up for $8.99. Perfect for beer hanging out with some friends and knocking back a few."
""
""
"O - For the price of a (relatively) cheap 12-pack you get a wonderfully well-rounded and extremely drinkable beer. I bought this beer with low expectations and wound up loving it. Full Sail's Session series is exactly what the name implies; these are lovingly crafted beers that taste great but yet are light enough to drink as session brews and not get tired of them. I would HIGHLY recommend this beer to everyone who has yet to try it. For that reason, overall this gets a 4.5"
"interesting from a marketing standpoint, but i feel like im being cheated an ounce of beer here. smells bitter and roasty, like a cold cup of black coffee. flavor is malty and smooth, a touch of smoke, and just a hint of hops in there at the end. feel is nice, down really easy and still strong enough to warm you up on a chilly day. overall nothing special here, just as it says, a throw them back style session beer with a lot more to be excited about than a budlight or someother can of crap. not sure ill buy this again, but it serves it role."
"Overall been pleased with the session line-up. Most of the time they are well priced and always easy to drink. My favorite from the session line-up...for now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and fairly flavorful and straightforward."
""
"Overall a nice mellow dark brew, very easy to drink, yet still having that wonderful dark beer flavor. Absolutely a great session beer, hence the name..."
""
""
"O - Overall, I enjoyed getting to try this beer from Full Sail. The strongest point is its nice balance of leafy, caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors, as well as its nice drinkability. I could easily put a few of these away in one sitting and plan on trying this one again in the future for sure."

"a decent enough beer that is easy to drink and wont leave you pondering too much in your brain as you tip it back. Worth trying and good to have around to quaff and not think too much."

"Reviewed on: 03-26-2011 01:36:36"
"Pouts a very dark red-brown with an off white head that stood about 1 finger tall after the pour. Retention is decent. Spots and rings of lacing are left in my glass as I drink. Smell is of roasted grains, Caramel, and dark fruit. Taste is primarily of roasted malts, grassy hops, a bit of malt sweetness, dark fruit and then some chocolate in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but carbonation is good. I have I say that this is one of the most under-rated beers ever. It is a beer with a fantastic amount of flavor considering its price point. I know Full Sail has won a lot of awards for this beer and they are well deserved, my only complaint is that it isn't actually very ""sessionable"" at 5.4% ABV, if it was 4.8% or under I would make this a go-to. Also, great beer to keep around to share with guests."
""

"While Session Black Lager is a nice but non-descript dark Euro-lager, there's a few minor characteristics that make it more of a Dunkel than a Schwarz."
"This says ""premium"" on it - and usually that's a warning sign. In this case it deserves the description. Too bad this bottle is a bit small because I ended up looking for more. This is a nice ""session"" beer. If you're looking for an easy-drinking dark lager, this one is definately worth choosing!"
"Overall: A good beer that's very representative of its style, but doesn't offer anything to set it too far apart from the herd. Worth a try and very sessionable."
""
""
"Around a finger of deep tan foam, lots of larger bubbles interspersed creating a dimpled surface, not much retention and dissolves to the surface quickly, any lacing evanescent as well. Rich brown to orange in color while remaining fully transparent, shines vividly in the glass. The nose is not really that smoky and puts the spotlight on caramel, honey dolloped breads, brown sugar, cola bean and a touch of café au lait, minor element of grains and yeast, the plum to black cherry fruit has some prune in it, average length and staying power. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is not that big, however, it does steadily churn across the tongue and relieves some sweetness. That said, the smokiness here too is a barbecue grill nature and plays to the molasses, caramel, brown sugar, grilled nuts, cola and mocha chocolate. More breakfast danish sort of breadiness than dinner breads or pretzels, no pronounced hops presence. The fruits more a mix than distinct flavors, dark berries and cherries. In the end it’s the carbonation which saves it and allows it to be “sessionable.” Could put back 2-3 before getting bored."
"This is a beer I always seem to have a 12 pack in my fridge at all times. looks, smells, and tastes great for being a lower abv and lower priced beer. extremely easy to drink, but still has a great flavor to it. obviously not overly complex, but it does what it can for being a session beer."

"Clear, dark chestnut color under a fleeting off-white head. Smooth nutty aroma...roasted malt, creamy caramel, and a touch of coffee. Sweet roasty/nutty flavor. Chocolate, earthy hops, coffee, and some syrupyness. Pretty clean and drinkable. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Not a bad drinker..."
"Insanely drinkable Schwarzbier. Good price. Very available. I will buy this again."

""
""
"Overall - I'm not really a fan of dark beers but I've had enough to know that this isn't a bad one.."
""
""
""
"I'm ok with this one, but the only reason I'd session it is because I had to buy a 12 pack to try it. The stubby packaging is cool, but the beer is very average, and sub-average for the style (in comparison to german versions). It is ok, and I'll kill the rest no problem, but won't buy again."
"Taste is creamy and rich with ample coffee and toasted notes. The balance is a little better than expected, especially in the aftertaste, although it is far from hoppy. The finish is cleaned than you would think although the texture could stand less carbonation. This is a solid, drinkable dark lager, I could definitely see sessioning this with ease, so to speak."

"Other than the mouthfeel, nice beer, schwarzbier is kind of an underrated style. I do prefer Sam Adams Black Lager to this, but I wouldn't mind sessioning this one sometime."

"If I could rate this on value alone it's an A+ for sure. This is a delicious lager without any downside I can see. I enjoy this style, and this particular example makes me think I've been overpaying for others in the past. I'm guessing this beer is overlooked because it comes from a more average craft brewer, and is packaged like a macro. But don't assume anything about it, try one and enjoy it."
"OK 5.4% is NOT a session beer. It doesn't meet the BA rules which are already very ""American"" in their 1% bump on the english rules. Ding would not approve. This beer also is fairly heavy for what it is trying to be, yet it lacks the extra sweetness feel that are needed to really make a dark lager work. See Sam Adams Black Lager for an example of how to do this style right."
"Easy drinking, pleasant tasting. Guinness Black Lager? Why would you. If you want a sessionable dark lager look no further than this."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall, not the best schwarzbier I've had but its nice to see a black lager from an American brewery. Easy drinking and enjoyable nonetheless."
"O: I think if you take this beer in it's style - essentially a session schwarzbier - it's incredible. Insanely drinkable, good flavor and relatively cheap. These are always in my fridge just inc ase."
"M: thinner body, nothing offensive or off-taste but just light in body"
"Three words: thin and metallic. A beer should never taste metallic, imo. To be blunt, this tastes like the first beer I brewed, when I didn't know what I was doing. I kinda feel the same way about it too: it's not bad, because it's beer, but it could be so much better. Add a little hops and switch up the yeast (or baby it a little to make sure it does its magic properly next time) and you will have a good beer. I'm still going to try their lager, but with much lower expectations than I had going into this one."
"Drinkability is awesome. There is a reason this is called a session beer. So many good tastes going on that balance out so well. These beers were meant to be drank all day and they can be. Immediately moves into one of my favorite beers."
"O: An excellent American cross between a German and American lager you can have plenty of these over the course of an afternoon."
"Overall - I enjoyed this beer as an easy drinker with good flavors. Light and refreshing and chocolatey."
"Overall – Not sure I'd really classify this a session beer, but it still fairly drinkable. There was nothing about it that really stood out though. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this again."
"O: I do not normally purchase 12 packs because I get tired of drinking the same beer. I bought this one because it was on a ridiculous sale $8 for the pack. I am glad I did. This was very nice and it is incredibly drinkable. I will not hesitate to pick this up again."
"Overall: Hmm… Great beer! Not much else to say. I wouldn't drink it all the time but definitely a great brew to pick up every now and then."
"On the high end of light bodied with vigorous carbonation, it could use a little less of the carbo but it works; drinkabilty is pretty damn good. Overall, a nice Schwarzbier for a very good price. I like."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer, my only problem is the carbonation. Otherwise its a nicely done simple, dark lager."
"It is a medium bodied beer and it had a bit more carbonation than I would want. Overall a good beer that I would drink again if I had the chance to."
"O: Another great porch/deck beer with awesomely retro bottle and styling. Just as good as it's pale lager cousin, and really hit the spot since I've been craving a good dark beer lately."
"A very crisp dark lager with some roast and malt flavour."
"Looking foward to Session Fest"
"Well, this is one well-named beer - lots of flavour, and goes down very easily, the extra few percentage points of booze only a consideration if you really take the concept to heart..."
"Cheers!"
" Very much like a light porter with lager-like yeast which is very nice."
"D: Quite quaffable."
"The aroma was deep with peat and roasted malts. Almost a touch of rye floating in there as well. Decent caramel after it starts to warm coming through now. The flavor was even more of an adventue. Started with a nice mellow flavor of roasted malts that quickly melted over into a smokey, peat like taste. Very full profile here with a nice touch of spicy, pepper like rye in the finish that just pushed it over the edge. Light hops as it drew to a close were just enough to make me come back in for the next sip"
"This one pours black with brown highlights, a nice mocha head that fades quickly. The smell is of roasted malt, sweet notes, a hint of cocoa. The taste follows the smell, big malt backbone, the roasted flavor is the driving force here. It is not very sweet, a nice mix of flavors. The mouthfeel is light, which definitely makes this a heavy beer flavor with a light mouthfeel, allowing the drinker to have a few of these without feeling full. This is a summer dark beer because of these qualities, still good for sipping on a hot day. Overall enjoyable, nothing out of the ordinary but solid flavor, and a well done beer."
"O-Great value. A good take on the style at a good price."
"Almost as flavorful as a stout. Definitely would drink it again."
"Pours a semi-clear dark amber color with a 1 inch light beige head that fades to a thin cap. Thin broken rings of lace form along the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and slight caramel. Taste is of toasted malt with a caramel/toffee aftertaste. Slight roasted bitterness quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer from Full Sail but I don’t like it as much as the Session Lager. A good deal for the price for sure."
"Until my next pour, O!Red says, Raise your Glass, I'd Tap That!"
"o - Overall a pretty good beer; seemed a bit porter-like to me. Liked it better than the other Full Sail Session beer. Would have it again."
"Overall-a lot more going on here than I expected, a nice Scharz, well made and easy to drink. Well worth a try."
"You know, I fully support the idea of breweries making low ABV, FLAVORFUL beer. I can't get behind this one though because it tastes too bland."
"It is not overwhelmingly exciting, but rather a well-made and delicious unassuming dark Beer."
"A simple and uncomplex beer, but tasty and drinkable."
"This beer was poured in a pint glass by the bar, it has a medium size white head, it smelled of pure roasted coffee beans. it tasted of roasted coffee with a very light body, slight malt in the finish but very clean and short. This beer makes me want to open a second one. It was probably the most refreshing dark beers I have had, plus for the price point you can't get any better."
"Overall, a very tasty and super easy to drink sessional beer."
"Overall, this beer is quite good. Served cold, there is a lot going on in it. It is flavorful, refreshing, and delicious."
"It is more than drinkable, but not for too long."
"D - very easy to drink but nothing outstanding making me want to go back for more"
"I loved it. Great price and great taste. Dark beer with a delicious flavor. I highly recommend it. To be fair, I am a fan of dark beers already. I saw that this particular beer won a gold medal in 2010, so I tried it. I am a big fan now. Hopefully I can find 6 packs at Total Wine or elsewhere. So far, I've just been buying them in singles to try. Purchased at Total Wine in Sarasota, FL"
"D - Very smooth, and...sessionable."
"Quick review: pours dark brown with soapy tan head. Nose is creamy and roasty like dark coffee with a splash of creamer. Palate is a bit wanky but it was on clearance for a buck (code 082110). Flavors are good though, some coffee notes and a little woodiness. Decent finish but clean. Would try again fresher for sure if I ever come across it."
"It's probably the style more than anything, but this one's not doing much for me. Some toastiness with the thin mouthfeel of a lager is not a good combination, at least where I'm concerned. Have to admit there's nothing else to complain about though. But nothing to compliment either."
"I drank this beer straight out of the bottle, which is how the bar i was at served it. However it was a stubby gernade bottle, so if it is going to be in a bottle, it might as well have some personality. This beer isn't extraordinary or over the top, but for what it is, a session beer it is really good. Malty, roasty, easy drinking and delicious. Knocked back 2 with no problem, could have drunk a couple more. Even my wife, who drinks Miller lite, liked it. I would definitely order this beer again in the right situation."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. While there were slight hints at adjuncts, and filler grain, it smelled very much as a Schwarzbier should. It had nice deep malts, with a toasting, and a mild sweetness to carry through with the balance. Where we lost points was in the lack of flavor. The malts were there, but we would have like to see something a little stronger."
"O: I enjoyed this beer."
"A real 'meh' schwarzbier as there isn't nearly enough roasted flavor and it tastes more corny and grainy then anything else."
"O - I typically avoid lagers but this beer is a definite exception. I enjoyed Session black and I'm sure I'll be enjoying it again soon!"
"Overall Drinkability - Great balance. Good beer overall. Much better than the Xingu I had recently."
"This is easily the most mellow shcwarzbier I've ever encountered. And honestly, I think this is a good thing. I could easily drink a lot of these, which fits the ""session"" concept. I really need to try the Session Lager."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"overall - an easy drinking and mildly flavored beer."
"I liked this beer. It reminds me of the German blacks like Köstriker et al but with less mouthfeel and a bit more macro in flavor. I prefer it to the red labelled lager. I would like to try it as a draft but I don't think they have it. At least not in NYC. Overall a good pounding beer!"
"D/O: A great beer here, although not a true ""Session"" ale if you want to get technical per the traditional definition... that being said, it is highly ""Session-able!"" - really good stuff, and so far my favorite Full Sail beer. I really enjoy knocking back a few of these at cook outs, tailgate parties, etc."
"O: I thought the regular Session Lager was pretty decent, but this really blows it out of the water. Solid beer."
"However, it is packaged in an adorable little bottle so how can you not like it?"
"Overall not bad, light and crisp, some nice toasty malts, definitely sessionable."
"Overall its pretty average, but it is fairly true to its name."
"Not undrinkable garbage, but very plain."
"Overall, this is an alright beer. I don't see myself buying this again, but if someone rolled in with it, I wouldn't refuse it."
"Overal - It's everything you might want in a session beer. Nothing outstanding, really, but one that you have no problem just sitting there enjoying. I think this would be great in the summer if you're sitting around a campfire, or just knocking back a few with friends."
"O- This beer was a fantastic little find. The flavors were not over the top which helps to the overall drinkability. Lighter ABV also means it can be could drunk in a little larger amounts. A nice easy drinker from Full Sail."
"Session Black Lager pours an almost black color that shows red highlights with a tan head from a twelve ounce stubby bottle. The aroma has a touch of hops and a bit of a roasty malt smell. The flavor is nice, malty, a hint of chocolate, a bit of roast flavor is the most noticeable. Easy drinking, a nice session beer."
"This is a really good, and aptly named, session beer. Enough interesting flavor, but not so much that it gets old. A really nice, well priced beer. I'll have to get some more of this for certain guests."
"Pours a good one finger head, it looks a little soda like though, not the best looking head I've ever seen that's for sure. Body is dark brown, not at all black though. Appearance is ok. It smells very good though, it just smells really really smooth. On the smell all you really detect is malt, maybe some chocolate notes too, but not much else, it just smells really crisp and very smooth. Wow, very robust taste that just hits you up front and stays with you for a while. Yeah there are some definite chocolate notes in here, and of course I taste a lot of malt, it's a very simple beer, but really well done! It just tastes like there is nothing wrong with it at all, they didn't do much, but what they did, they did it really really well. I might be picking up a tiny tiny hop bite in the end, but not much at all. For this being a ""sessionable"" beer, it's really very robust and well done. Is it the best beer I've ever had? No, but I'm very surprised and pleased at how good it tastes. The mouthfeel is more than I expected, it doesn't have a watery feel at all to it, it's a legit mouthfeel. The drinkability I expected to be high and it did not disappoint. I don't know what else to say, very surprised by this beer and very impressed!"
"very good beer for the price and they go down very easy. recommended."
"I am loving the black lager trend. Such a great looking beer with some real presence, but so thin on the tongue. It's a combo that I think leaves a lot of dark beer drinkers wanting more, but only because it is picked out of place. I love the crisp lightness paired with an actual toasty goodness. Bottle is a nice change."
"Session black goes into the glass a few shades shy of shiny black. Up to light, some browns towards edges. Tan/white cap with bubbles, semi stick. Smell is somewhat english malt, dark bread, hops are dead at this point, peat. Taste is off the beaten path with the above additions. I really can't explain it. Feel is less than medium, with a light fizz and a low drinkability. Next."
"D- its alright not one that will make an impression on ya. Nothing unpleasant by any means but nothing to write home about either."
" Bravo Full sail"
"This beer has a good balance of hops and malt but it just doesn't taste very good and I had a hard time getting through the 11 ounces."
"I love this. Without a doubt the best thing I have had from Full Sail. This is really an excellent lager. Everything is so clean, subtle, and enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"A little metallic note that contributes to an aspirin-like quality of Session Black is my only drawback to this otherwise easy drinker. Light side on the body spectrum, and the carbonation is well-restrained too. Easy does it."
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, a bit chewy. Drinks surprisingly smooth and easy, the alcohol is invisible. This is one of those beers where I expected to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised."
"Dark brown with a small white head. Smells lightly of some toasted malts and caramel. Not much in the aroma though. The taste follows the aroma, once again not too much flavor but some toasted malt flavor. light bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Goes down real easy but it isn't something I really would care to drink a lot of. Worth trying but not really for me."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the taste packs in a lot of flavor. I would definitely consider this to be sessionable."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are both superb - the mouthfeel here is just a hair thinner than I'd like, but is otherwise perfectly crisp and smooth, and the drinkability is extremely good, this goes down way too easily. Another solid brew from Full Sail."
"This is a great, full flavored, session brew."
"D: A pretty nice beer but what's with 11oz bottles -- that's a European trick!"
"D: just a really easy drinking schwarz. i know this is unrelated to the beer review, but i dig the short stubby bottles. they are pretty fun to drink out of if im not in the mood for glassware."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-/C"
"A nice cola brown with a large creme' & cocoa head. Head is big, retention good and lace is nice. Smell is roasted malts and yeasty bakery breads. Some fruitiness that is more english ale than german lager but still appealing. Taste is light roast and some malt body but I want more presence from a schwarzbier. A touch of tannic sourness and sweet light coffee verging on mocha. Feel is quite good, light with a touch more carbonation than the Session Lager that moves me. A refreshing and drinkable beer."
"It is an easy drinker that is a true session beer."
"Drinkability - not a bad tasting brew, but not complex in character. Interesting to taste a schwarzbier."
"Drinkability: A decent enough Schwarz but nowhere near the top of the heap"
"Pours brown with amber hues and a thin tan head. Not much retention and no laceing. Aroma is of grainy caramel malts,dark fruit,and brown sugar. Nice but a bit weak. Body is thin and carbonated.Taste is of fruity malts,and maybe a bit of coffee. Refreshing, but a bit on the weak side. Still worth a try."
"This beer has a nice brown amber look. It smells inviting with notes of nut and caramel without being over powering. The taste is good with nut brown notes with hint of sweet caramel. Lacks any hops or bitterness which is nice for a change. Goes down smooth. This is a very drinkable beer. I enjoyed it overall and will plan on getting it again."
"Beer is thin with no carbonation in the mouth, an odd forward sweetness that is really mild that almost gives way to a sort of caramel-like nothingness with a finish like water. At least this one didn't tempt me to spit it out. I won't have it again."
"this is a very simple beer with drinkability at the forefront and i think this is exactly what there going for. nothing great to write home about, but i would drink it again, and i would recommend it for $1.50 a bottle."
"A bit lighter than my fav schwartzbiers, but not bad at all. Worth a sample or two."
"The palate opens with flavors of coffee grounds, a mild tartness with some fruit (plums?). Mild sweetness is present in the mid-palate, with dark caramel, a little burnt sugar and some charred grains. The husky character of the nose isn't present on the palate. Drying on the finish with a mildly acidic character, a blend of carbonic acid and acidic burnt grains, this beer is medium-light in body with high carbonation. A touch too high in ABV for a session, but still, I could drink a few of these in a session. A good example of the style."
"The taste is a touch flat, there is a smooth caramel uncarbonated malt running right through this beer. The beer is a touch herbal, there is a bit of a metallic tinge before the beer settles. This beer isn't complex in the least and what you get on the first pour is what you get through to the last. There are some dark malts, some sweeter notes, a touch of hop in the finish, mostly a bit of caramel and light molasses. It's okay, easy to drink, nothing special, just wait a bit so the beer can settle in."
"Lovely little beer,lovely malting, easy drinking. A nice balance of chocolate and roast. Middling mouthfeel. Black colour with significant lace. Very good drinkability. Neutral at best aromas.Very fresh.I would love to have this regularly in the fridge."
"tastes more of the same, fairly watery, small hop presence, not much to say. is it drinkable? definitely. is it noteworthy? meh... i cant find a whole lot of words for it, its pretty simple, but hey i still rather enjoyably killed off a 12pk."
"From 11 fl. oz. old style stubby bottle no. 030311-12:49-FL. Sampled on January 6, 2011. It begins with a dark amber-brown pour with nice highlights glistening through but little head. The aroma is a combination of baked malts and nuts. Decent enough medium body. The taste also has a molasses-like maltiness that remind me of candied yams followed by a subtle dry ending."
"I am a fan, and I don't think I will have too much trouble putting back this twelve pack over a short period of time. I'd rather spend the extre dollar and get these than the Bud, Miller, Coors type."
"D: Super duper high here would give it a 6.0 but I can't. BMC take not this is a brew that has just enough flavor and still gives you the easy of slugging them down and not feeling bloated doing it."
"Overall I found this to be exactly as advertised, a dark beer that's easily sessionable. Worth a shot."
"I'm a Schwarzbier fan and I was excited to try this one. Something short of black in the glass... about like a good Coca-Cola with a tan head on top. Malty with a (fruity?) hops presence but very subtle. Taste was caramel and biscuity malt with the same hint of fruity/bitter hops for balance. A residual sweetness that hinted of alcohol, but everytime I thought the sweet would become cloying or the alcohol overpowering, it seemed to back off and the flavor remained fairly balanced. A bit on the thin side and lacking any real dramatic flavor, but I get the ""Session"" tag. Not bad. I'll stick to a more flavorful beer, but this one would be good on tap with food."
"Poured into my schwarzbier glass a deep chocolate brown with a fluffy but quick to fade off white head,some light chocolate and mineral notes in the nose but both are pretty light.Chocolate malt flavors with a bit of licorice,and iron.Subtle flavors lends to easy drinkablility,this would be a good tailgating beer or all day sessionable lager."
"D -- Buy it and drink it. Solid 'session' beer. Pun intended."
"These bottles were badass in my mind till Peace Tree hit the scene, word. Despite it, this beer pours a beautiful black color which is really more of a ruby red when held up to the light. The head is medium and fairly right. There is a moderate lace on the glass. The aroma is clean with a nice rye bread and grainy character. There is a distinct fruity and yeasty note as well, one thing is for sure that this does not smell like your typical lager. The first thing that strikes me about the flavor is the nice smokiness and the sharp bitterness. There is a lot of nice bits of fruitiness both in the hoppy and malty sense. Very straightforward and tasty."
"Reviewed on: 12-03-2010 19:46:25"
"Drinkability: very easy to drink this beer. It has a bit of a refreshing quality to it too."
"Note: I would have upped some of the ratings if this were listed as a ""American Lager""."
"Moderate body, with ample carbonation. Light feel for this ""heavy""-looking beer. Nice mild bittersweet chocolate, light toasted flavors, and a bit of a hop kick on the back end. Another good representation of this style. I wish more American brewers would attempt this one. Becoming one of my favorites. Recommend."
"The beer pours a black color with a thin tan head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a grainy roasted malt scent along with a tangy zing that I can't put my finger on. The taste is decent. It has a grainy, dry roasted flavor with a hint of caramel malts. It does down easy and finishes bone dry with some black malt bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an easy drinking, ""sessionable"" beer, but not the greatest black lager."
"The name doesn't lie--this is pretty easy to drink. Tastes just as good out of the neat, stubby bottle; I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
"Pours a dark brown with red highlights. Not even close to black. Thin tan head. Very unusual sour smell. Taste is a hint of sulfur up front, along with a hint of wierd sourness. Middle is light coffee flavors. Juicy fruity finish with a hint of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is bland and watery. Low carbonation. Not all that drinkable, many real session beers (less than 4% abv) are richer and have more flavor. I guess compared to a dipa this is sessionable, but it really isn't that good of a beer. It's only a couple of months old too so it hasn't gone bad; I am pretty dissapointed with this one."
"Final Notes: About as light bodied as darker beers come, but for the price (just a bit over a buck a bottle), it's hard to beat this for decent beer on a shoestring budget. I'll be returning to it."
"Session black is pretty drinkable and for the price I wouldn't be surprised if I picked up a 12 pack at some point to bring to a party or something along those lines. I could see either of full sail's session beers being good as an introduction to non-macro beer."
"The head on this beer isn't to great fades very fast, but the color is real nice. A honey color deep brown. Aroma is pretty clean with a hint of roastyness. Really nice taste for a session lager, clean, crisp a little smoke and chocolate notes. Sharp tingly mouthfeel lively and refreshing. This beer will probably become a regular in my fridge for sessions and ball games."
"Very drinkable. Lives up to it's name. Looking for something in bulk, find this on sale, its a no-brainer."
"Full Sail was obviously going for a sessionable beer for beer geeks, as unlike the pale version, the dark color and roasted character may scare away some pedestrian beer drinkers. In my opinion, they nailed it with this one, balancing great character with overall drinkability in a style of beer rarely brewed in the U.S. Just a couple of suggestions---Although the brewery advertises just drinking this straight from the bottle, like every other good beer with this much character, it greatly benefits from being poured into a glass. Also, don't drink this one as cold as you would a pale lager, as it definitely masks the roasted malt character which is the best part of this brew to appreciate."
"D: A fantastic value and a great beer. For $9.99 a 12er this and its lighter brother are 2 of the best deals in all of craft beer. The B belies my true feelings on this brew."
"Great mouthfeel. Think a thinner version of a porter with not quite as much bitterness but still a little chewy. I'd put the body at medium and the thinner amount of carbonation really let's the grains shine. Quite a tasty brew that's well worth checking out."
"D: Nice warming flavor, yet somewhat light and very drinkable. Nice session beer for a cold, rainy day. A little bit of a metallic taste disappears as the beer warms, otherwise very enjoyable."
"Not really my thing, decent enough, but not likely I'd go for this one again real soon."
"D - All day long. It is a ""Session"" beer after-all. Those who appreciated a little more flavor in their lagers will enjoy this even more."
"ahh shucks, from the cute little stubby. full sail's new classic. dark, almost black, licks the glass. slight roast and chocolate, not a whole lot of aroma, tastes nice, not an overabundance of flavor, but the little roastiness provides a slight abrasive edge to what is otherwise a very smooth drinking dark lager. that edge is what makes this such a distinctive beverage."
"Its very drinkable that being said i couldnt help but feel the flavors were almost muted other than that though i could session with this beer any day"
"D: This had a decent smell and taste and body, but nothing too delicious or unique. It was definitely easy to drink, so it fit the bill as a dark session lager. But I couldn't shake an apathetic feeling from drinking it."
"D) A nice, low budget brew that tastes great. I'd have another."
"Overall: A very nice beer at an excellent price. The only problem I have with this beer is that it is only 11 ounces! I want my 12th ounce!"
"Another winner, like Full Sail's Session lager but with a bit of roastiness from the dark malts. Nice, agreeable, and drinkable."
"A fantastic Schwarzbier and, true to its namesake, a great session brew. A rather low ABV and a balanced, interesting flavor profile make it extremely drinkable."
"D - This is a tasty, easy drinking lager. Nicely done by Full Sail, again."
"Has neither flaws nor any particularly attractive or special qualities. Still, easy recommended as an economical session beer."
"The drink is very high, this is honestly be a great session beer (yes, if its name it...it better fit the description) Might have to buy this more often for events I dont want to savor every drop, but still drink."
"D - Very drinkable, I definitely see why it's labeled as a Session beer."
"D: Low ABV and great flavor makes this a rather good session beer. Just as the name says... Session.... Worth picking up."
"This is a great session beer and one of my favorite styles so I might be a bit biased."
"T/M - Clean with a dry finish...malt sweetness is very low and the roastyness of the malts give a slight hint of chocolate. The body and carbonation are both medium."
"Conclusion: An interesting example of the style. There is room for improvement, but then again I have not sampled many scharzbiers, so maybe this is spot on."
"Value: Recently, I saw this on sale for $10.99 for a 12-er. Goood deal."
"D - It's not bad. I think it needs some vanilla ice cream though! Beer float time!"
"Overall impression: I'm more of a fan of the regular Session, but this one's not bad at all. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I find this to be a nicely refreshing and flavorful beer. It proved at hit at my band practice last week, so what else can a guy ask?"
"MF/D: Light/medium in body, smooth and mellow going down. Alcohol is virtually not a factor at all."
"All in all pretty good beer."
"What a disappointment. I bought a twelve pack of this stuff, too."
"Nothing bad about this beer and it drinks well. The difference between this and the regular session is the sweetness with a bit of sour."
"Very high. Light bodied, but very tasty beer. I would drink this beer again."
"12 ounce shortie bottle. Pours a nice ruby black with a full foamy tan head. Initial aroma is of roasted coffee. Looks like a cola. Tastes of roasted malt with very little hops - what is there is earthy and dark as well. Molasses and toffee are present, adding to a semi-sweet mouthfeel. Almost feels like I'm drinking a porter. Suprisingly drinkable with a light finish. It's called Session for a reason, I guess. This beer isn't overly complex, it just aims to please with the roasted choclate and toffee flavors. Good dessert beer."
"I tend to really like Schwarzbier and this was an excellent take on them. Pours dark (almost black--hence the name) and foamy. Pronounced aroma of roasted malt and malt sugars. The flavor is excellent, a very drinkable mix of dark caramel, medium alcohol levels and sweetness--sort of like a good porter in lager form. The carbonation tastes almost like nitro, making this a very smooth and easy to quaff beer."
"D - Very quaff-able, I really enjoyed this one and the price was extremely affordable, which will probably keep me coming back for more. Not my favorite of the style but for the price, I'd buy again. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation. It's lightness in body makes this very drinkable and the slight dryness keeps me coming back for more. A good Schwarzbier but i prefer others over this."
"quite a drinkable 12 pack. if you're gong to go that route. a weak schwarz quality. nose of nougat and toastiness. and palate that is back with a nougat and smoked quality of sour apple finish. not a bad one as the brown sugar quality give it a bit of balance and the malt was rather sufficient. i was pleasantly surprised. drink if you have to... but to experience the schwarzbier."
"This one impressed me far more than the regular Session Lager, it's a nice standard dark lager that should be in the running for regular for anyone who likes the style."
"The beer pours a very dark brown with a tan head. The nose is dark malts and some chocolate. The drinkability is great especially for the style as some Schwarzbiers are very dry on the finish. Unlike the regular lager this beer has lots of nuances in the finish. Could drink a bunch of these and it is very food friendly"
"Drinkability - Not a bad drink for a dollar. If they still have a couple at my beer store I bet I'll pick a few more up."
"Drinkability Thank you sir ill have another."
"single from an SLC liquor store"
"overall pretty good for a schwarzbier, a bit on the lighter side, which is good for a beer you are going to drink all day."
"Mouthfeel is similar to Session Lager, which is to say, not bad at all - medium-light body and a light carbonation with just the right bite for maximum drinkability. I would buy this over the Session Lager for at least 8 months out of the year I think. Just a nice little, unpretentious beer that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish."
"D: the brew is named session for a reason, and you get a group together you can play rock-paper-scissors with the caps."
"drinkability - a light beer that has some flavor and aptly named as a session beer"
"D: This is one of those beers that's drinkable, but not overly memorable."
"I say better) than the acclaimed Kostritzer Schwarzbier"
"D- Quite drinkable in such a cute, little bottle"
"Taste follows the nose with semisweet chocolate and offers a grainy consistency. Finishes with a bit of charred malt followed by a slightly creamy sweetness. Rather full in body for the style and without the usual crispness I would associate, in fact a bit porter-like with warming."
"M + D: Light body, maybe a little bit slick. Drinkability isn't really in question, outside of the matter of sweetness noted in the flavour. I've found myself returning to this one a couple of times now and would happily pick up a 12-pack at this point."
"Mouthfeel is light, but the carbonation has a pretty smooth feel to it."
"The beer had a sweet smell. The beer was a little bitter but not too bad but just did not taste black. Just nothing great here. I will not buy again."
"This beer pours a clear brown color with amber hues. I guess Full Sail doesn't think I know what black looks like. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes within twenty seconds into almost no lacing. This is not a very impressive looking beer. The aroma is of caramel, burnt chocolate, and malt. It is a moderately strong aroma, but is rather simple. The taste is like the aroma, but weaker. Even with its simplicity it would be nice if there were a little more pizazz to it. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. Again not very impressive. Overall, this beer is quite disappointing. I expect a lot more from a Schwarzbier."
"B"
"It's quite worthy, but mainly from a better-than-macro standpoint. Or easily better. This just wouldn't be my first, second, or third choice for a proper dunkel or schwartzbier. But it would be in my top choices if I was going to grab some fast food and go eat and drink by the river with some friends and goof off."
"Scwarzbiers are session beers to begin with, so it's not as though there's a need to make one ""sessionable"" if that was the intent. It pours a medium caramel-brown, similar to popular colas. Head is large and retains a medium sized layer well. Nose is light and with some herbal notes. On the palate it is light and watery, with some faint malt and roasty components there, and pretty much screams that it is a ""3.2 beer"" from Utah or other similar state (but it isn't!). Not a very good Schwarzbier, IMO."
"Pours a clear dark amber brown with a pale oatmeal head that leaves a good amount of lacing behind. The smell is lightly roasted malts, with light hints of chocolate, anise, and wheat. The taste brings back those roasted malts, starting off light and becoming increasingly roasted as the taste floods across the tongue. There's a healthy amount of wheatiness in their as well, not unlike a dunkelweizen with less yeastiness. A slight woddy/nutty quality is also present, but very subdued. The body is on the lighter side and very smooth, allowing this brew to live up to its name."
"Totally drinkable, complex for a dark lager yet not heavy on the palate."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of the taste, to fakey, but I could see others liking this one if you like smoke flavored things."
"From the stubby 11oz it poors a nice black, big head. Smells kinda odd hard to place not much do talk about. Taste kinda spicy/burnt with an odd bitter not really hoppy but kinda hoppy taste. Feels a little thin but what I was wanting tonight. Easy drinking and priced rite I could easily put back a few."
"I'm impressed. This beer comes across easily drank without completely abandoning its dark aspirations. It's more versatile with food than most dark beers out there and quite affordable (I found mine for around $10 for a 12 pack). Too bad Full Sail's twist off caps are so hard to twist off. That's the biggest thing keeping you and me from the next one."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite of the Schwarzbier style (that honor goes to Sprecher) but not bad either. A good fall/winter brew."
"D: Actually very easy to drink for what it is. It's a decent beer at a very affordable price. One of the better American interpretations of a Schwarzbier..."
"D - Very refreshing and flavorful, this one definitely stands on its own."
"Good example. Not the most thick, vicious or complex but tasty. Black body with a light tan head. Sweet roasted malt notes in the nose with a brown sugar presence. Sweet but not cloying, medium thick body with caramelized molasses, espresso notes, anise and sweet brown sugar. Mouthfeel could have been bumped up if a little less sharp. Still well done, tasty and a great session black. Looked very average by the bottles appearance but well worth it once you taste it."
" Cheers, Matt"
"M/D- light body with decent carbonation, goes down with the greatest of ease- it's a perfect beer to offer to those friends of yours who's only experience with anything darker than a BMC was a Guinness, showing a much wider variety than they previously knew about"
"M/D - Real smooth, slight carbonation, light body. While average, the flavors are enjoyable and nice on the palate. Very drinkable, of course."
"Drinkability: Why, that's a pretty tasty beer, actually! If it's time to have a fine, flavorful beer with a reasonable amount of alcohol then Session Black is a good place to start."
"Overall: The mouth feel is a medium carbonated, slightly dry, and smooth. The body of the beer is a medium light and the finish medium light. This is the first schwarzbier that I have tried and it is descent. There is nothing about this beer that stands out to me."
"D: Pretty high for any fan of dark lagers, and as pedestrian as this may seem, it tastes great straight out of the bottle, too. I can't say this is my favorite black lager, but it's definitely a keeper for parties and gatherings, considering its fairly low price point."
"Finally saw the black session so picked up a 12 pack. It's a nice little schwarz that meets the requirement for an upscale session beer. Easy to drink and the stub bottles are cool too."
"Session Black pours out a little sandy foam over a black brew. Nose is nice and toasty, with notes of baker's chocolate. Flavor is mild and slightly sweet, again, with toasty malts predominant and notes of mocha and maybe a little licorice. Mouthfeel is crisp and light with a mild toasty aftertaste. This has a lot of flavor for such a modest brew- but not in a way that makes it off-putting to people used to drinking crap beer and lurch into this (or the original Session). As such it's another perfect gateway beer. As with the first Session, this has the rock/paper/scissors game under the caps, though the half cases they are sold in also have a word search printed on the bottom. Nice party beer!"
"Drinks really easy, will pick this one up again if I can get it fresh. Nice Schwartz bier"
"D-Very easy drinking. Disappointing that it is only an 11 oz. bottle."
"A big fan of Session Lager, I sprung for a twelver of big brother Session Dark. Taste is surprisingly appealing for a dark lager, though fairly uncomplex. A nice, nutty nose with dark molasses and coffee undertones, this is a supremely drinkable dark beer. Reminds me a bit of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, which is meant as a compliment. A perfect starter on a cold autumn night as your palette works it way to bolder offerings..."
"Overall, a nice surprise. This is a very tasty schwarzbier. The first sips are really good, but as it warms I like it a bit less."
"D: True to it's name, it's drinkable like a session beer should be."
"D: That being said, the beer is as drinkable as you can get. Good aroma, good taste, good aftertaste, balanced, light mouthfeel."
"This was a very tight well constructed lager. Pours a shining dark brown/black with an airy tan head. I looked for smoke on the nose but couldn't really pick it out. Smells very toasty and roasted, malty, sweet, hoppy, crisp. Taste is very clean and nutty. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great, one of the fullest and creamiest lagers out there."
"Appears clear dark brown with a little off-white lacing. The aroma is rich with roasted barley, bread crust and dark chocolate. The flavor follows up with the same tasty roast followed by a big candy note that reminds me of chocolate-covered caramel. There's a light kick of herbal hops and the beer goes back to the dark, smokey grains. Not too heavy or sweet, just tasty and drinkable. A fine beer, reminds me of Kostrizter Schwarzbier, but a touch lighter."
"Just because a beer is dark does not mean that it is heavy, in fact some of the most famous darker beer are actually quite light. The darker color of these beers comes from the use of roasted malts, which is basically barley or wheat roasted until the grain has a dark brown color. The Sessions Black Lager is truly unique with its old school squatty bottle, its retro looking label and great flavor. The beauty of Sessions is that it is not a microbrew, not a macrobrew nor an import, it is all of them and none of them at the same time. The beer itself is smooth, dark and surprisingly refreshing with initial tastes of chocolate and caramel malts with a touch of citrus. The hops and malts are balanced nicely providing a long, smooth and slightly bitter finish. Definitely a beer I will drink all summer long!"
"This was flavorful and easy drinking but I was maybe looking for a little more roastiness to the overall profile. Still darn tasty though."
"Paired with Hamburger Helper Lasagna. Chocolately brown color. Not really black. Smells like roasted grains. Drinks easy, thin mouthfeel. Printing ""Session"" in fancy-assed lettering on their bottle probably helps it seem that way. Reasonably-highly carbonated. Little or no bitterness. A little metallic, maybe from the hops. Not bad."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, some red on the edges. Small off-white head, diminishing. Chocolately roasted aroma, some sweetness. Sweet and enticing. Sweet taste, roasted and chocolate flavoers. Very chocolately very good. A little too sweet after awhile, it would be hard for me to drink this as a session beer."
" check it out, and pour some for your four legged friend!"
"As a schwartzbier it is not one of the tastiest brews you will have but as a session beer it has been brewed to be tasty enough to keep your interest and light enough to be drinkable. It definitely achieves both of those goals."
"For some reason, Session Black Lager isn't quite as good as Session Lager. Call me crazy, but when a beer contains the darker malts, I want to taste them as well as see them. Under the cap: paper. So if you have rock, you have been pwned. Stubbies rule!"
"Finishes crisp and clean. Definitely a sessionable beer. It has enough character to not be boring, but can still be enjoyed without too much thought."
"D-Very drinkable indeed. I don't think I'll go out and buy more of this, but it's a solid beer, and I enjoyed it."
"It's an easy beer to drink, not challenging or complex, but yummy enough that I would stock up a little so that I can have a cold one when I fancy it."
"As Schwarzbiers goes this is pretty solid and definately takes on its namesake of 'Session', ad it truly takes that on with ease. Very drinkable and mildly subtle with a nice craft about it."
"I've already drank about two cases of this over the last two months, very sessionable. very dark brown, not quite black. The aroma is a subtle bit of malt followed by a very malty flavor, chocolate bits, good flavor. This is a very good companion to the regular session and in fact I like the Session Black more."
"Very refreshing, easy-drinking beer. Notes of caramel, toasted and roasted malt and just enough caramel to add depth without cloying sweetness. Light to medium mouthfeel, great for session drinking (hence the name, I guess), finishes with medium roasty character. I really like this beer, it will be a great ""fridge standard"" for the after-work refreshment."
"D - This was a good beer that guess what I could session easy to drink with a good taste worth trying sometime"
"A welcomed addition to the Full Sail linecard."
"Dark amber to cola brown body. Thick finger of dense, dirty khaki head. Good lacing. Traces of roasted malts on the nose mix with licorice, tobacco, and scorched caramel. Some good smells, but a little subdued overall. Lightly roasted malts and mineral-y bitterness up front. Earthy, tobacco-y malt flavors come in. Mineral-y bitterness and a little cardboard around the edges. A little licorice and fruit in the finish, but mostly tinny roasted bitterness. Watery body with gentle carbonation. Goes down easy enough and tasty enough to session."
"Pours a dark brown color with two inches of off-white head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass surface. Has a sweet malty aroma with just a hint of floral hops. I would of like to have more of a hop presence. The flavor consists of a slightly sweet malt with a hint of floral and herbal hop flavor. Bitterness is low. Light body with nice carbonation for a session beer. Very easy to drink with decent flavor. Just needs a little more hops and bitterness in the finish."
"D: As the name suggests, this is a sessionable beer. Not quite as sessionable as its fairer brother, but still very nice."
"Pours a clear dark orange/light brown, pretty thick off white head forms, drops to a thin ring and leaves some sporadic spots on the glass. Smell is nice, very malty, a touch of chocolate and roast, slightly vegetal, caramel middle, biscuit, a bit sugary, pretty neat but I could use a little more roast character. Taste is solid, toasty and biscuity, caramel, quite malty, lightly sugary, some bready malt, light chocolate, clean finish, again needs a bit more roast. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, goes down smooth. Lives up to its name, great session lager."
"This is a decent sessionable schwarzbiers, but in judginf to the style, there are some technical flaws."
"Like the ordinary session beer, I don't find anything appealing here apart from the cute old-fashioned look of the packaging."
"The body is light.. and looking at the label... I'm honestly surprised this is a 5.6% brew... NEVER would have guessed it... Drinkability is amazing... I am seriously digging this one and hope that Full Sail makes this a year round offering.... I buy the regular Session quite a bit just to have in the fridge... but this adds a nice dimension and I will certainly buy again... probably often."
"As far as Schwarzbiers go this one is fairly light all around. This is a nice easy drinking session brew. When I need a dark beer fix this will gladly do the trick. It may not be on par with the style, but that is not a bad thing."
"Roasty malts are prominent and there is a bit of a black licorice flavor in there. Fairly thin bodied and a fair amount of carbonation. A bit too much roast for me to want to 'session' more than a couple of these. I like the red label better for what I am buying it for. Gimmie a German dunkel before this anyday."
"Tastes good & isn't watery or light. Medium to heavy body. This is a great food beer. I could enjoy a few of these but I'd need something salty with it to fully enjoy."
"- Sessionable as the name states, and a nice difference in comparison to the standard Session.. quite drinkable and unique!"
"D: Like Session Lager, Black is eminently drinkable. It has just enough complexity to keep me interested, and a low enough ABV to feel, well, sessionable."
"This beer is cheap ($8.99 for a 12pack), and I am very fond of it. The temperature hit 110F today, so I am sure I will be enjoying this beer for a while during the hot summer months. Hats off to Full Sail for this one. Really a pleasant surprise."
"** I find it odd that they decided to call this beer ""session black."" I guess they decided that ""session medium brown"" probably didn't have the marketing power that they were looking for."
"D: Fairly drinkable and pretty reasonably priced. Pretty average for a dark lager."
"I almost wish this was a heavier beer to slow me down, because it truly is a fantastic session lager. It disappears quickly, and tastily."
"Pours a black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some slight hop notes, and caramel and slight toffee. The taste is sweet, malty, slight hoppyness, lots of caramel, and some toffee. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew for a $1."
"Living up to the name, this is a great session beer - light and refreshing, with just enough going on to hold your attention."
"Lackluster at best. Comes off as a watered down porter to me."
"Overall, really i am quite suprised. This is a fine example of a dark lager and one i will probably revisit when craving a session ale with that little kiss of roasted malt. Really much more than i usually expect out of full sail. Not a bad price either. Overall a solid summer or fall BBQ choice."
"Remember this is a review for the style a Schwarzbier/Black Lager."
"I can't comment much on the color or smell of this black lager. Neither quality extends beyond the brown glass of the stubby and this of course limits the beer's appeal. But unlike the pale Session lager, the Black has a discernable flavor along the lines of black-and-sweet coffee with an agreeable finish that scoffs at the hops gods. Enjoyable. Remind me to try this one from an actual drinking glass next time."
"Overall impression: Another nice offering from Full Sail .. I imagine I'll be consuming quite a few of these in the future.. Session is always a favorite at parties and this looks to fit the bill just as well."
"Picked up a bottle today at Colorado Liquor Mart. Dark amber/copper color, little to no haze, and a white head. Smells of malty goodness, a tad of caramel, and chocolate. Taste too. Somewhat sweet. Mouthfeel on the lighter side. Very nice drinkable session brew. I appreciate Full Sail's effort to provide a sessionable option in a smaller bottle A refreshing break from all of the beers unnecessarily bottled in 750 ml and 22 oz format."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Appearance is a dark amber with light head and lace. Smell of roasted malts with a very light sweet toffee. Taste of bitter roasted malts with some earthiness to it. Mouthfeel is light with a light spike of carbonation. A good beer, but a bit roasty for me if I were to drink it as a session."
"D: this is a good beer. I find this to be a very good session beer and with its flavors makes for a nice treat. Anyway, this is a tasty little ringer"
"D: Eminently easy to drink, I consumed at least 4 of these at last night's Independence Day get-together with friends, feeling no effects other than a reduced inhibition around strangers and a rampant patriotism. Not the style of beer to 'wow', but definitely an everyday drinker that's sure to be a hit around these parts. I'm very happy with the trend towards drinkable lagers with flavor; will be picking up a case from time to time. Good job, Full Sail!"
"Personally, I feel that the dunkel style would've been more approachable to most people, but that's only a tiny gripe. It's great that Full Sail has taken the idea of a session lager and merged it with a tasty schwarzbier. My one concern is that I'm not so sure it'll really accomplish its goal. I can see casual drinkers thinking it's ""too roasty"" and bitter (roasted bitter, not hops). Hence, why I would've favored the dunkel route instead."
"The color is a dark brown with a single finger head. It smells like roasted malts, a bit of chocolate and crisp hops. It's quite the bubbly beer. Tastes like a lightly hopped lager with some chocolate, and dark malts. Taste a bit like a black and tan, with a much lighter body. Very drinkable as the name may imply. This so easy to drink, some ex-girlfriends may be getting texts at 2 in the morning."
"Pours a clear deep brown with a slightly tan fizzy head that quickly dissolves into a thin ring around the glass. Aroma is a nice balance of caramel and roasted malt. The flavor is sweet upfront with chocolate-like flavors. Its light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable dark lager with really no bitterness to speak of. Something to mix it up for those Mexican dark lager drinkers."
"The body was as expected, thin but appropriate for the style. Drinkability was of course, very good. These would go down smoothly and easily with or after most activities."
