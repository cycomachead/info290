"Simple as an earthworm, but much tastier. Nothing groundbreaking here, just a good, solid brew."

"This is my first experience with this style of beer and I must be honest, I'm not sure what to make of it. It pours a very dark opaque black with a tan head that quickly disappears to nothing. It leaves virtually no lacing and little to no legs. The nose is roasty with coffee and dark chocolate but lightly scented. The flavor is slightly sweet with a good amount of coffee and chocolate but also a little hops. It is very light on the palate. Im not totally sure how to judge this one. I enjoy it but at the same time don't. Can't wait to try other beers of this style so I can get a better idea of what it's going for."
"I honestly had no idea what to expect when I opened this brew other than the Shorts name. Glad I picked it up."

"O - Not bad by any means. Reminded me more of a watery black IPA. Would make a nice winter session beer."

"O: This beer seems to taste like a hybrid between a schwarzbier and a porter."

"Gotta be honest, impressed. I like the depth of flavor on this beer. I had no idea this was being bottle released this year, but saw it in my bottle shop and decided to give it a shot... so incredibly glad I did. It's reminiscent of a porter, but adds more smoke/char to the flavor, and there's that great sort of nutty aftertaste. Wish I had purchased more."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 10/3/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with light-moderate yeast ester presence; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, light char, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with light-moderate yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice schwarzbier! All around nice robustness, balance, and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a great example of the style, I still think I like Sustenance Black Bier a little more, but this beer was pretty close to being as good and it reminded me a little of their Uncle Steve's Irish Stout. It had everything that I look for in the style with some great balance. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not too filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink lots of this stuff without getting bored with it, it's very sessionable. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was and how drinkable it was, those two things really made this beer stand out as a well made Schwarzbier. What I liked the least about this beer is that it's not available on it's own, this would be a great seasonal beer to release in six packs at the start of ski season. I would for sure buy this beer again, I'll try to stock up before it's all gone and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style or dark beers in general. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I already knew Short's had some skills when it came to this style and they didn't disappoint. Great job guys, thanks for another impressive Short's brew and keep up the good work."

"Pitch black brew with nice mocha head that leaves some spotty lace after each drink. Malt forward with a dry bitter finish. Smells nice - malt, black licorice, some spice bread. Solid brew - glad I tried it. I'd love to have this again at Shanty creak on a winter day."

"O: Overall I was quite impressed with this one. It was well balanced, not too sweet, not too dry, an overall good lager."

"	Overall, the best thing about this beer is the beers flavoring, especially when coupled with the soft feel and great ease of drinkability. We thought long and hard about the aroma, which was pleasant and fit right to the style, but was pushed a bit into the extremes of the “ashtray” nose. This did, however, add to the ultimate thrust of the beer in its entirety, rounding out its presentation. This is an odd style to attempt these days, but we found this effort to be much appreciated from the point of variety. This is an easy beer, and although a bit bright around the edges, this would suit any craft beer drinker looking for something new and strongly executed, or someone looking to get into the style outright. This beer is also highly characteristic of Short’s, and it fits their brand wonderfully."
