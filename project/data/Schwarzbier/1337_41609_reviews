"Overall: awesome drinkable lager. very enjoyable"
"Pours black, not a hint of light gets through. Thick foamy head, almost rootbeer-esq in appearance. Smooooth.. good mouthfeel, very drinkable. Smell roasted malt, coffe chocolate, very nice. A lot of porter characteristics, yet lighter in body ike a swartzbier. Very good beer and highly recommended."

"excellent black lager, love the surfing theme too. it could not be priced any better, at under 3 bucks a bomber, this could become a go to for me. dark brown pour with a lively rising mocha head, looks like a good porter. smells like heavily roasted malts, more than the normal schwarzbier calls for. chocolate too, dark and rich, and lager yeast. the depth of flavor caught me off guard, lots of complexity and layering here. chocolate is really forward, cool in a lager, and the roast of the barley is about as dark as it can be. lager yeast doesn't do quite enough to lighten it up and shorten the finish, that part is a bit out of whack for the style guidelines, but I almost prefer its chalky long bitter finish because I really like the flavors here. a touch thin on the body for all the depth, but it is a lager I suppose. an excellent beer overall, one of the better black lagers ive had."

"O: Fantastic example of the style. Recommended."

"Overall, this beer was a really nice black lager; well balanced and flavorful. I had 2 pints which is uncharacteristic of me when there's sooo many beers to try. (p.s. The food was great too!)"
""
""
"Pours a black color. 2/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, hint of smoke, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, hint of smoke, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, good appearance and blend, but the bitterness that the roasted malts impart it too strong for a Schwarzbier."
"O - If you like stout, black beer, you must try this."

"O - I got this 1 pint 6 oz bottle for $2.99 at my local beer store, Jack's Wine Sense. Can't beat that."
""
""
"Overall - It smells like a Schwarzbier but has the flavour of a RIS or a porter. Regardless, it's very good and packed full of flavour."
""
""
"Pours a dark black with a khaki, creamy head, fitting the style nicely. Coffee, light roast, cream soda, wheat bread crust, and bitter chocolate round out the aroma. Flavor starts with sweet chocolate, a hint of lactic sugars, turns quickly to bitter, burnt toast, and dark, slightly chalky chocolate. If there are hops in this, they are well hidden. I'm guessing earthy English hops, since I don't get any nectar you find in noble hops. Feel is creamy with a slight chalk to even it out. Finish is slightly dry. Loving all the diversity of flavors in this sessionable lager."

"I picked a bomber of this in Western Mass. Poured into a pint glass and it pours a black color with a thin light brown head, which continued to sit with a nice ring throughout consuming the beer. Its` nose has coffee, over cooked malts, some caramel. The taste is roasted malts, smoky, while a tad watery. Mouthfeel is very nice, it is creamy and finishes clean. All things considered, this is an enjoyable beer and while I was on the fence when I see it in the aisle (for the 10th time or something), I am glad that I finally picked it up on one of my infrequent visits to a bottle shop in my neighboring state to the north."
""
""
"O - A great tasting, light, stout. I had this one after a Guinness, and it kicked the Guinness's butt. Very tasty and it won't knock you out like an imperial stout!"
"Pours an opaque black. No head at all. Mouthfeel is wet with slight carbonation. It could've been a bit creamier. Aroma is pretty disappointing. Smoky like a burnt piece of toast. Pretty weak flavor of dark roast malt. Some underlying notes of plasticky cream. I'll never make this mistake again."
""
"The smell of roasted malts, yeasty bread and a hint of herbs had a pleasant and soft aroma. The taste was different than the aroma. The taste had a bitter flavor of roasted malt (maybe over roasted, which gave it a smoky flavor). Also, a hint of an herbal nature. For me, not a Lager I would buy again. My first disappointment from Port Brewing!"
"It is what it is. Easy drinking and a little on the boring side."
""
"OVERALL: Not a bad schwarzbier, highlighting a rich, malty flavor. Enjoyed this bomber for what it was and it did drink easily. A little loose around the edges, but still a solid dark lager."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled on 12/20/2011. Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger foamy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, toffee, caramel, coffee, light char, grass, and herbal. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, herbal, grass, and earth. Lingering notes of cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, herbal, and grass on the finish for a bit. Nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; no cloying flavors at all on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly creamy, chalky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent schwarzbier! Very robust and balanced roasted flavors; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. Really enjoyed this one."
""
"D - Not bad, it is a little outside of the traditional German mainstream for the style, but that is to be expected from port. It is perhaps too roasty and smoky for the style but still white drinkable in the end."
"Overall: I have limited experience with this style. This one is very flavorful and full bodied but still light going down making it very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall – Roasty and tasty. While one I would not take as a session beer, it is one to have every once in a while."
""
"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black. Light to medium body. Thick medium tan head and lacing. Roasted malt, hops aroma. Strong stout-like coffee, chocolate and roasted malts up front. The middle and end are not as robust, but still pleasant. Flavor rapidly tapers off, probably because of the low ABV. As it warmed, the finish got a little bitter and sour. A tasty schwartzbier. An above average low ABV dark beer."
"As a beer, this is good. But if the aim was a schwarzbier, then it seems to miss the mark a bit, to be honest. It strikes me more as a kind of smoky porter than a schwarzbier. But for what it is, it certainly is consistent. Nice and smooth and fairly deep. Probably just a bit too deep for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Mouthfeel is excellent- medium light body (on the lighter side for such a dark beer) with moderate to full carbonation. Very drinkable brew but maybe not quite as full of a body as I would've liked. Get it if you like this style."
""
"If this was offered in 12 oz. bottles, I would have had a few of them, given how low the alcoholic content was. Most people wouldn't think of this as a session beer but if a Stout or Porter is too heavy for you, this would easily suffice instead. This was a textbook example of a style that isn't widely available but is certainly worth a try nevertheless."
""
"O: Wow. An amazingly easy to drink beer. I could reach for this all day."
"O - I give it a boost for an uncommon style just done well. May the Schwarz be with you!"

"Overall – not a bad brew. It’s not quite what you’d expect at first, but it’s good-tasting and decently interesting."
"Overall: For an American Schwarzbier this is very good. I love the combination of the lightness of its body and the smokiness. The smokiness is prominent but does not come close to rauch levels. This is a solid beer that I will get again."
"Overall: a good schwarzbier. I don't see a lot of American craft schwarzbiers around, so it is good to find one. I'd definitely have this again."
"I really liked this beer. Just a smooth and consistent easy drinking beer."
"O - I cannot say enough good things about this beer. The drinkability for these flavors is quite high, which I find relatively rare. On tap it is as good as I could image, fulling realizing the potential I thought possible when I had my first bottle around one year ago. I will state a bit of bias in that this is a personal favorite combination of tastes and such, but regardless this beer should be sought out by anyone looking for a complex dunkel."
""
"22 oz bottle from Windmill Farms market. Quite drinkable, but definitely on the blackened side of the flavor profile."
"O: Overall a black lager with a smooth easy yet respectable roastiness that is quite relaxing."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balance of coffee and chocolate flavors with some complexity added with the smoke flavor."
""
"The predominate smell is burnt white toast. First impression of the taste is affected by the thin body. The flavor matches the smell with lots of burnt bread notes. The aftertaste is dry and short. Overall, it reminds me of a strong, dark Euro lager."
""
""
"o - Overall an okay beer, but not Port's best offering. Bosy is a bit thin and the taste is a bit bland. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"B-"
""
"Pours a deep brown color with a fluffy coffee colored head. Cocoa and bitter coffee on the nose with some earthy hops. Pungent nose. Cocoa nibs and bitter black chocolate bitterness up front complimented by a layer of coffee flavor. Medium in body with thin carbonation. Deep roasted malt flavor comes through. A complex brew at 5% with quite a few layers of flavors and big flavor at that. Thins out slightly on the finish but otherwise good beer."
""
"Not equal to my favorite schwartz, Black Bavarian, but tasty and a surprise in the IPA and Imperial Stout dominated Port line-up."
"O- for a beer weighing in at 5 % alcohol, this brew has a very nice body and is packed with flavor, one I look forward to drinking every year, mighty delicious. A great session beer!!"
""

"Overall, this is a very nice beer. Not the most traditional example of the style, but quite enjoyable none the less."
""
"O: I really enjoy this beer, it's simple and very easy to drink. I'm glad Port Brewing finally came to New Jersey so I can enjoy brews like this."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. A latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and roasty coffee and cocoa bean aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and some cocoa powder. A nice roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Slightly too much carbonation in my opinion. Overall, this is a great schwarzbier and quite a surprise really. I wasn't expecting this beer to be so good. Very tasty and very drinkable and it only packs a 5% ABV."
""

"O: This beer is easy to drink and is also quite sessionable. It is a good representation of the style."
"O: Not a great example of the style and nothing special about this beer in particular though it is quite sessionable."

"Overall though, a very pleasant and enjoyable beer, one I would most certainly drink again without prompting."
""
"O- For the style this is just ok. One of my favorite styles, but I didn't find a wow factor, or a flavor that really pops in this one. Would drink again, but not go out of my way to get..."
"Super drinkable and approachable Schwarzbier that would definitely be a go-to if I didn't live 12,000 kms away."
"Very impressed by this, cannot think of a better dark lager that i've come across. Easy to drink, complex, full of flavour and aroma."
"The Port Brewing Black Lager that I picked up is called Midnight Sessions....name must have changed over time. The appeance is great dark....opaque...nice tan head which seems to be lacing. The smell include roast with hint of espresso and hops. The taste is common of most black lagers, light/medium body, with good roasty tones with touchs of coffee, caramel, and hops that help to clean the pallet. The Mouthfeel is very good as well very easy to drink with not overbearing ABV. I am guessing they changed the name because it is a great sesson lager. Overall a very good beer."
"All in all a 'surprise'. Not a session beer, even at 5%"
"Pours a dark as night kola hue which leaves a two finger bubble laden khaki laced head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is dark roasted malts,dark cocoa,roasted expresso and black forest cake,the mouthfeel is nice,light and very sessionable with tastes of dark belgian chocolate,black forest cake,burnt toast,molasses,a touch of dark fruit and finished like a nice black roasty expresso and overall i definately would this again and another great lager from this great brewery."
"I see why the beer was originally called Moonlit Sessions - it's the kind of thing you could stay up drinking until way past your bed time. This may arguably be the most agreeable, widely approachable offering this side of the colour spectrum - that's what you get combining a German brewer's engineering with the ingenuity and skills of a true American artisan."
"Overall, I find it to be quite good and is another great addition to the Port lineup."
"A world of flavor in such a low ABV package. Really an incredible treat. A delicious black lager."
"Overall it's a good beer but I was a little disappointed. I just had higher hopes. Was looking for more depth in flavor and there was virtually none. Its seems like a homebrewers first attempt at the style."
"O - Moderately drinkable, but not something I'd go out of my way for again."
"Pours deep amber to black in color with a tan head. In the aroma, malty and hints of caramel. In the taste, caramel, chocolate notes, and a hint of coffee, quite porter like. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry coffee and chocolate aftertaste. More of a porter than lager and/ or schwartzbier with the big coffee/ chocolate roast, but nice nonetheless."
"Drink-  A little bit different than I thought. Tasty, malty and a little dark hops.  Unexpected flavors but probably not coming back."
"O - Quite a good brew for the style. A bit all over the place, but still a good brew. Thanks for the great trade ShogoKawada"
"O: I picked this one up on a whim and it didn't disappoint. I plan on trying this style a lot more throughout the summer."
"Tasty black lager. Pours a nice opaque black with a finger of tan head. Nice roasty aroma, nutty, with some coffee bitterness. Similar taste, big roasty malts, coffee and cocoa, and a touch of raisin. Smooth, medium mouthfeel, and highly drinkable."
"Poured from the bomber a jet black color, with a creamy light brown head on top. Aromas of roasted malt, dark chocolate and smoke. On the palate, this one was medium bodied and fairly crisp, with flavors of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, nuts and smoke."
"Overall: I like this beer. Good for the style. Can't say that I'm a Schwarsbier enthusiast, but if I'm in the mood I'll look for this guy again."
"O - Generally Black Lagers don't do too much for me but I'm really enjoying this one I like the flavor profile and the abv point makes this a very good beer one that's worth getting if you seeit around"
"O: Very smooth and easy drinking. I wish I hadn't shared the bottle, as I could have done the whole thing! Precisely what I was looking for tonight."
"My favorite dark lager that I have tried. Supremely session-able, and refreshing. I'm kinda bummed I never gave this a try before, because I think it's gonna be a new staple in my regular line up."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good drinking beer. I am VERY hard-pressed to call this a Schwarzbier. It is a mostly malty beer with some toasty notes and other components that make up a Schwarz, but there isn't enough toasty notes to push it over to a Schwarzbier. It is really rich, so is more like a mild Porter fermented with a Lager yeast or something. Again, it is a good beer, but don't go looking for a Schwarzbier with this one."
"I really enjoyed this one from Port."
"This brews taste is confident and solid, yet delicate and restrained. A great schwarzbier that definitely respects the style's heritage. I'd buy it again for sure."
"Aroma is rich and smoky with undertones of malt, molasses, yeast and coffee - very like a good stout or porter. It pours a near-opaque sable with a thick, fluffy, fairly persistent light tan head. Flavor is mainly malty with an undertone of roast coffee and hints of molasses. Texture is fizzy as cola, dancing on the tongue and all the way down."
"The beer had a Lighter feel to it and perhaps the carbonation was a bit light. The beer was smooth, clean and very easy to drink. Overall, this is the second beer for this style and I am quickly determining that it is not one of my favorites. Not a bad style, just not for me, but I can appreciate it and will probably try to give some of the higher rated ones a try."
"The body is very good, solid but not heavy, and crisp. Drinkability is very good, a 22 went down very easily. Overall, I found this to the best beer I've yet tried from this brewery. Worth seeking out."
"There's a decent mouthfeel, but the sweet malt stick around a bit too long to make this a session beer for me. I'd more likely turn to a Full Sail Session Black."
"Final thought - One of the best lagers I have had in a very long time"
"Damned good Schwarzbier, right there with Duck Rabbit's excellent interpretation of the style."
"Mouth feel is lush and decadent. Quite drinkable, as well."
"Decided to pick one of these bottles up before they changed the name of it. Pours black with an extremely tiny tan head that disappears in the blink of an eye. Scent is burnt toast, chocolate cocoa, sweet malts, and coffee. This taste is not what I was expecting at all! When I saw this was a lager, I was not expecting it to pour black, nor was I expecting it to smell and taste like a porter. I get tons of chocolate cocoa flavors with light hoppiness. The burnt malts flavors complement the coffee and chocolate flavors quite well. Flavors all blend together great! Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing. I find the mouthfeel the most distinguishable thing between this beer and a porter (ale). Drinkability is high."
"D-I like this beer. Nice and complex. Very different for the style. I would drink this beer again. Probably a great food beer."
"Nope, this feels like something of a miss to me. It has some pleasant characters, but some slightly unpleasant ones as well. Not Port's best offering, that's for sure."
"D - A good tasting beer just a little different than most schwarzbier's that I have had."
"This is a quite good offering from Port Brewing. A flavorful Schwarbier that is quite sessionable and pleasant to drink."
"Drinks so easy, a great example of the style, a tad too much coffee, but still wish I could pick this up on a regular basis"
"D- I know people all the time talk about Port Brewing in a negative light. I have yet to have something terrible from them and to be honest this beer was fantastic. Port please keep doing what you are doing and I will keep trading for you until you decided to come into Indiana (cough cough)."
"Medium high carbonation, thin body, with flavors encompassing bitter chocolate, roast barley, and a coffee middle. Bready as well, but smooth and effervescent on the palate. Moderate bitterness with only the faintest hint of astringency. Finish is medium in length. There is definitely a crisp and clean pale malt support structure in this one. Another good offering from Port."
"Appealing, quality beer from Port Brewing. Not my favorite from them but this is definitely worth trying."
"- Medium bodied and rich dark roasted feel and creamy... Not a bold as I would imagine. Very smoothe and very drinkable."
"So yeah, I totally bought this by accident when seeking out Hop 15 for some friends. Just grabbed the wrong bottle and did not realize it till I was in my car. Oh well, on to the review. Pours completely black and quite opaque, very stout like, with a tan head that slowly fades and leaves just a ring around the glass. It has okay lacing, but nothing to write home about. The aroma is full on roasty goodness with plenty of coffee and cocoa notes. Not really much else showing in the nose. The taste is also very roasty and full of coffee like flavors from the dark malts as well tons of bitter chocolate and a bit of licorice. The malt character is that of brown sugar with a nice toffee edge to it. Exceedingly clean with just a hint of herbal hoppiness and a very firm bitterness. This is definitely one of the more flavorful schwarzbiers I have had. It could easily be mistaken for a stout, even with its smooth clean character. The mouthfeel is medium and the finish is a bit astringent, but not at all unpleasant. It lingers long on the palate with some nice residual sweetness. Pretty drinkable, but not as much as some other dark lagers I have had. A surprising beer and one that I am glad I partook of."
"d- really nice, this went down a bit too easily, i will definately drink this again. here is yet another top notch brew from port."
"D: A very good lager. Tasty and full bodied yet clean and drinkable."
"Nice. I'd like it a little lighter, actually, but a good brew."
"M/D: Light body but head and heavy carbonation stay with this the whole way through."
"D - A solid and enjoyable Schwarzbier... Easy drinking and utterly sessionable... Nothing detracting and nothing spectacular, just another fine offering from the folks at Port Brewing... A terrific value at less than $6 per bomber..."
"A really dark lager,/swartzbier, midnight is jet black with a slight ring of foam around the glass. The surface foam did not 100% cover it's parts. The color was off ivory with small tannish colors. Loose lace. Nice dark looking beer. Smells consist of cocco and roasted malts with a touch of peat/smoke and some caramel A small bit of grain, but i could be reaching there. Taste is slight toffee/ caramel, roast, slight coffee. Cocco powder and a little peat in taste. There's a little of everything here, even some earthy, floral hops hanging out back. Body is a bit thin although it looks bigger, Id say way less than medium. Carb comes through the lightish body quite easy. More smooth than crisp though. This is easy, I drank it quick and did not feel it in the least, 5% beer is alright with me. Will drink again. With the carb issues port/LA gets in a bottle, Im fortunate to find this stuff on draft, cant risk it. This is good beer."
"For a being called lager this is very dark, not a bad beer, but not outstanding either. Lacks depth in my opinion, after the coffee taste there is not much else following that up in my opinion."
"Drinkability: for the style this beer has a bold flavor profile that keeps you wanting more. Great on tap."
"Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Not good, not bad. This was fine, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"Chewy full body with a nice lactic creamy feel along with a beautiful smoked malt character that isn't overpowering at all. Deep roasted flavor with hints of nut, toffee, chocolate, caramel and burnt toast. Slightly bitter hops provide the perfect compliment to the smokey roasted notes. There is also a subtle dark fruit presence, especially dark cherry thatnprovides a nice sweetnessto the deep roasted notes. This beer is perfectly balanced and extremely quaffable. This is a nice introduction to smoked lagers. No too overpowering with a lot of comlexity balancing it out but ruach/smoked beers fans will love this beer. Highly recommended!"
"D: I'd definitely have this again. On tap only, though."
"D: Really enjoyed this beer. Bought this beer cause I forgot if I had tried it before, most likely I did but I just have a bad memory."
"Pours deep black with a slight head. Aroma is sweet, malty, and roasted, more like a porter. The flavor is malty, woody, surprising robust, with cherry and chocolate. This is much more like a porter. Mouthfeel is rich and milky."
"Not bad at all. Nothing that jumps out though. Subtle and enjoyable. Worth a try if you see it."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with a khaki head leaving little lacing. Smell is of dark roasted malts, coffee beans, nuts, toffee. Taste is of bitter dark roasted malts and coffee, backed by a toffee sweet and nut flavor... borders on stout in its profile. Light bodied, almost watery and a slight bitter aftertaste. A nice brew... nothing spectacular but does a bolder version of the style well."
"Taste is very nice, dry toast, dark caramel hint, some coffee, light sweetness with light singed-leaf- roasty-coffee bitterness. Initially it tends slightly to the sweet side before quickly becoming dry with a flavourful dry,roasty finish and dryish aftertaste leaning slightly to peppery bitter side with dark chocolate."
"For a Schwarzbier, it's not to style, but that's what makes Port Brewing Co. so good, they brew some really unique stuff."
"D - Aside from the phenols and the astringency, this was a good beer. The complexity is there, but it appears the mash was too hot."
"all 4's"
"Thanks to MASPuros for this one. 22oz. bomber served in a SA Perfect Pint glass. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of tan head. Bottle conditioned. Chocolate malt with some noble hops in the aroma. Medium bodied. Lots of chocolate malt in the flavor. Porterish flavor profile. Roasty and malty with a long lingering chocolate malt finish. Different take on a schwarzbier."
"This was a pretty interesting SChwarzbier. I was definitely expecting something a little lighter on the palate, but Midnight Sessions was relatively dense with some pretty vivacious malt character. Pours a dark char color with a cream head; nominal lacing. Lots of roasted malt character for the style with some pretty nice smoke notes as well. Just a hint of hop bitterness that balances the malt notes nicely. A bit less crispness than I was expecting, but the nose was still pretty pleasant. The body is pretty dense for the style with a nice smoke and roast quality to the malt. Although the hop qualities were not as pronounced to me as some other posts, enough bitterness was present to balance out the malt. All-in-all a really nice pour and light enough to make me want another once the first disappeared. I really like this one, but knock it a few points for being off style in my opinion."
"O - Nice session beer, a little harsh on the roasty taste but very drinkable. Another amazing beer from Port Brewing"
"It's difficult to find a good American-made schwarzbier on the shelf. Midnight Sessions is made for sessions not just for midnight, but for any time of day. Damn tasty stuff; now it's my new favorite of the Port Brewing line."
"Pours black with a two finger off white head. Good retention and a light coat of lacing. Smells and taste of roast malts, some earthy and citrus peel hops, some smoke and a bit of yeast. Mouthfeel is moderate with nice low carbonation. Leaves a coat of roasty hops. Low bitterness. Certainly a nice laid back roasty lager at a good price. Could session this one for sure."
"this was super easy to drink, nice low ABV, great flavor with nothing really dominating. i drank this rather quickly."
"overall a good schwarzbier that is more bitter than most."
"D: Thoroughly enjoyed this. Definitely would have it again and could easily make this a go-to beer when I'm in the mood for something roasty like this."
"Nice to have a good dark lager brewed locally!"
"D - Drinkable, but not something I'd turn to for a Schwarzbier. It's light enough that I'd be able to enjoy a few should the mood for multiple smooth, smokey beers strike me."
"I Was told to give it a try and I did... not to impressed."
"I could enjoy a couple of these bomber bottles every night, at Midnight, earlier, or later. Terrific."
"Overall, an excellent Schwarzbier, that exceeds expectations and demands returned helpings. Especially for a 5% beer."
"Overall this was a very well made beer, I can't say how to ""style"" it was being so dominant in the coffee and chocolate flavors but it doesn't really matter to me as long as it is good. This actually reminds me a lot of some Duck Rabbit beers, maybe the porter."
"Pretty weak effort by Port here, in my opinion -- I like most of their offerings, but this just seems like a bit of an afterthought beer."
"drinkability is ok - this is a session beer like the name says - i am just not a big fan of this style"
"3.5 D: Like I said before, this is okay, but not my schwartzbier of choice."
"D: An enjoyable beer overall. It's sort of a Stout/Schwarzbier hybrid in presentation and certainly a nice change of pace on a late night."
"22oz bottle. Black with a thick tan head. Roasted malt, burnt and caramelized sugars and light acidity in the aroma. The flavor is smooth and has plenty of dark chocolate in a light and drinkable package. Lightly burnt roasty finish with light hops. This is quite flavorful for 5% but drinks very easily with only a light lingering bitterness in the finish fatiguing the palate."
"This one pours opaque dark dark brown with two inches of tan head. The aroma is huge, chocolate, charred malt. Taste is mellow as you'd expect from the style--chocolate, coffee, charred malt. The charred flavor tends to stand out. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth despite the huge head. Very drinkable, highly recommended."
"The taste is of the nose. Some roastiness, with a very slight bitterness that is detracting for the style. There are slight hops, but minimal. Decent Black Lager, but not great."
"D: Good drinkability, as you would expect from a lager."
"NOTE: this is before i started hearing that the recent batches of older viscosity, BA santa's little helper, etc are still coming out flat. i was willing to give port/LA another chance (thus why i still went and bought this bomber), and knowing that this is from the second runnings of serpent stout, i was considering trying that too. but now i'm unsure if i want to keep supporting them. they need to get their act together."
"This texture and a mild ABV make it really easy to consume and this night surfing inspired German lager is world-class and definitely worth the search."
"Bomber from Ledgers. Nice super dark brown color with auburn highlights. Decent cap of tan foam but it's a little fizzy. Roasted malt aroma, grains, sweetened coffee, brownie mix. Flavor is not as good, one-dimensionally roasty and a little ashy at the end. Some extremely dark chocolate creeps into the aftertaste as well. Body is too thin for sure. Not bad, the aroma alone makes it better than several German schwarzbiers I've had."
"Side note, more brewers need to focus on a quality Schwarz, it is the session beer for the dark beer folks."
"I like the style, and buying the bomber at Gordon's in Watham, I was a bottle past my 12-packer for the plane. Hence an enjoyable and informative sharing with Jeff at Jaspar's in Nashua. Roasty aroma, black body with permanent off-white little head, with a great drinkability, and this is 10 minutes in the fridge on a warm day. Balanced with a tad of fruitiness, and complexity in the roasted black malt."
"22oz bottle for a very reasonable price. I bought mine at Ledgers in Berkeley. Pours a slightly murky very dark brown with a thin pancake head that sticks around for a while. Very roasty aroma, almost coffee-like. This surprised me, not your average dark lager. The taste is also quite roasty, and there is a fairly earthy/hoppy presence as well. Add in some light bubblegum flavors, some more coffee notes, and a light chewy graininess and you have a pretty interesting beer. There is a bit of a fade on the finish. Grainy and medium-bodied in the mouth, I altogether found this to be a pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability is stellar, as expected. Light but full, somewhere between a slow sipper and a session beer. This beer is whatever you want it to be. Love it."
"Overall this was much roastier than other schwarzbiers I've had (though I haven't had many). Still, it was balanced by the hops and chocolate flavors. Worth a shot."
"The appearance of this beer is jet black with a thin brown head that didn't hang around long. The nose was full of coffee and roasted barley smells. That is where the style portion ends, because when I drank this beer it was more like an ale then a lager. Lagers should be crisp and clean tasting dark or not and this was more like a porter. Don't got me wrong I liked this thought it had all kinds of great flavors, I just wanted a Schwarzbier, and this wasn't it. Won't stop me from drinking another."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. I could sip these all night."
"This is the first time I have had this type beer and I am curious if this is a fair representative of that style. Would like to try other beers from Port Brewing and I would also like to try another Schwarzbier as well."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with strong carbonation, a bit too much for me."
"This is an excellent schwarzbier with high sessionability!"
"Port Midnight Sessions lager is a love story. A hearty porter meets a delicate lager on e-harmony.com or somewhere and they fall in love. It's a healthy relationship. They share and compromise where they have to. The porter gets the appearance; it pours a dark, impenetrable brown with a red hue. Light, fluffy and wispy mocha head sits atop and stays for a short while. It shies away to a modest covering... like the morning dew on the grass, it is beautiful and noticeable and also delicate. Its aroma is dominated by roasted malts and coffee tones. The crispness and smooth lager qualities combine with the coffee and roastiness in the taste. It's an alliance, unlike China the the USSR in the 1950s, there is no ego war here. No ambivalence, just harmony. The mouthfeel is like listening to Bob Marley. Peaceful, jovial, pensive, mellow... but not Jamaican. The drinkability is superb..."
"One of the finest porters I've had! Oh... it's a black lager? Well, then, it's still one of the finest porters I've had. Blacker than black and visibly thick as it generates a fat, dense, dark brown head when poured into the glass. Extreme roasted aromas are evident at a distance of three feet, and a balanced dose of roasted malt along with a hoppy bite as it goes down. Dense body but still quite drinkable, especially with the 5% ABV. As black lagers go, this one isn't-- at least, not compared with the others I've had. Stack this one up against Berkshire's Drayman's porter or even a good bottle from the UK. Definitely worth a try."
"""It smells like pencil shavings."""
"D: It's certainly drinkable, but it's a drinkable style and there's a bit too much bitter astringency in the aftertaste for me to give it a higher score."
"D: The smoky peaty like flavors coat the mouth a bit making me go a bit slow between sips. The low ABV and thick creamy nature help to counteract that a bit though."
"Overall, a good but not great beer. Love the style so was a bit disappointed. Always on the lookout for a good schwarzbier. Mild recommend if you can easily get it. For me, I'd try another just to make sure my sample was good (it did go thru 2 shipments) but unless it improved it'd be a one and done."
"Looks like an English stout. Black with dark brown highlights. Not much of a head after the pour and no foam or film. Chocolate, just a hint of non dairy creamer, an overall great roasted to burnt malt aroma. Extremely roasted, almost burnt malts add a note of coffee to the dark chocolate taste with maybe a touch of milk. The palate is grainy and dry, but pretty full. Each sip leaves a little prickle on the tongue. Great sessionable and very flavorful schwarzbier."
"Verdict: Not sure why I was surprised that it was so dark, given the name. It's like a big stout with an unexpected finish, and without the alcohol."
"M/D: Medium to full body, not huge though. Easy to go down but probably not quite as a good a representative of the style as say the Sam Adams version. A good beer for sure, but just too much like a porter when I wanted a nice black lager."
"A stout for those times you want to have several. Nicely handled, with an American twist on a firmly German style."
"Recommend this one to anyone who can get it. You wouldn't think house of wax with Paris Hilton was any good, but it was decent."
"D - Goes down easy - definitely appropriate for a midnight session (which is right about when I finished it). The roasty bitterness gets a bit tiring, but the carbonation and ABV make it eminently drinkable."
"Drinkability is great, a really nice schwarzbier. Big flavor without being to heavy or robust, if this was available in more reasonably priced six-packs, it would be a great session ale."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color lager with a large dirty brown foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sumptuous black coffee with some dry roasted malt notes is really enjoyable. Taste is a very nice mix between some dry coffee notes and some roasted malt with some subtle black chocolate notes. Body is full with nice creamy notes and good carbonation and no alcohol. Very well done and perfect representation of the style."
"Really good stuff and one I will buy again. The only knock is that I did enjoy more on draft than from the bottle."
"Overall impression: One of my favorite styles, and a nice example of it. Heavy on the roasted flavors and highly drinkable - I certainly wouldn't mind several of these any time of year."
"This a somewhat drinkable brew, especially if you're looking for something in between a lager and a stout. Normally, I'm not. But for those who like this sort of thing, it will probably make you happy."
"D - As one who really likes smoke, I was quite happy with this one. No major complaints, just wouldn't have minded a bit less esters in this one. A fine American Schwarzbier, and price seemed right at $5.99... Had with some Hoch Ybrig (firm cheese, raw cow milk bathed in chardonnay) and it seemed to work, brought out sweet malt and hay in the beer, and seemed to match strength... but I'm an amateur..."
"T + M + D: Dark chocolate, nice malts, but on the lighter side. Body is suitable for the flavours. Another nice one from Port, and I'd like to try it again."
"Drinkability: This was a very good beer, and one I'm glad to have tried. Extraordinarily sessionable at 5.0% abv, rich and tasty while not being overly sweet or one-dimensional, and creamy and easy-drinking, this one comes recommended."
"Interesting solid brew."
"I liked this batch more than when I tried the Moonlit Sessions during the summertime. Would work well with some barbecue."
"Update - I had this one again almost a year later and it is still a very good drinker. I got more from the nose than I noted in my original review but otherwise the flavors and smells are right on."
"Not a bad Schwarzbier but I have had better. Need to make it a bit sweeter so more of the chocolate comes through."
"Dark black with an aroma that is so roasty it makes me think of a stout which is no surprise given that this is a byproduct of serpent's stout. Roasty flavor and reminds me again of a stout but is distinctly different. Excellent drinkability and a really robust flavor make this very easy to throw back."
"I should mention that my bottle says ""Midnight Sessions"" (the label matches the photo though). I am fairly confident it's the same beer. Perhaps, they had to change the name for one reason or another."
"I'm not much of a lager fan, but this is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability- Not really my cup of tea. A bit to roasted and smoky for my tastes for a schwartzbier."
"Even a great brewery can't make me love this style. That said, it's a good, not great example. The mouthfeel is really excellent, not too heavy or bready. But the smokiness is definitely a little much. Sort of like a smoky Guinness. Or even the Old Viscosity w/out the bourbon booziness. An interesting beer, but once is enough for me."
"This brew poured a nice two finger head with good retention. The aroma of fresh gorund coffee and black licorice on the nose. The taste starts off with a hop bite and piney resin flavor that quickly fades into a heavy malt backbone with more intense coffee flavors. The drinkability is smooth with a good long finish. Cheers to Pizza Port for making a Schwarzbier."
"I'm a little confused about the name because I could have sworn it was midnight sessions that I had so not sure if it is the same beer or not. Pours a very dark brown almost black color with a small tan head. Good lacing. The aroma is of dark chocolate with some coffee notes. Flavor follows with the coffee and chocolate up front with some residual sweetness. Everything is balanced out nicely. Not my favorite Port beer but good nonetheless."
"D- Easy to drink for sure. The smoky taste does get a bit overpowering."
"I'm becoming a big fan of these types of beers--all the flavor of a stout but not weighed down by the heavy mouthfeel. This isn't as good as the Death & Taxes I recently had but still tasty stuff."
"I love it when I find this beer, my favorite schwarzbier."
"Medium bodied with nice carbonation and a dry and sticky mouthfeel. A truly sessionable schwarzbier. I have little experience with the style but this is very enjoyable."
"Wow. Black pour with a cascading tan head. Rich aroma of coffee, cocoa, cream, and roasted malt. Taste of the same, plus cereal, caramel, and a nutty smokiness. Bittersweet offering with the hops and caramel/chocolate flavors balancing each other out. Never disappointed. Dwarfs other Schwarzbiers."
"overall a damn good session lager. Loving the brews coming out of Port/LA"
"D: Pretty easily drinkable and low ABV. Pretty damn flavorful for a 5% brew."
"This is an excellent schwarzbier, probably one of the better ones I've had. Highly recommended."
"Notes from 4/25/08"
"Thanks again, numbeercruncher!"
"should be something more than lager on the label. Either say it's a black lager or a Schwarzbier. Someone expecting a lager might be very disappointed with this one. But I guess that's part of the beauty of a Port Brew, always a drinking adventure."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this beer has all of the characteristics to make it a sessionable dark lager, but I think that there are more flavorful beers in that category."
"D: The beer tastes bigger than it is. A 5%, this is a nice change of pace that I could sip all day."
"Very good brew from Port, my first I have tried from them. Looking forward to trying the other three I have."
"Drinkability- Although this brew sort of turned out being exactly the opposite of what I was expecting it was a amazingly nice surprise. I really like how it turned out to be light and un-sweet. I think that really helped the drinkability a lot. This is a tasty beer that I really appreciate being able to try. Thanks again Tom!"
"D - Lots of bang for your cuk with the flavor in this brew. Would make a great session beer."
"Very drinkable dark beer. Worth seeking."
"A full flavored, roasty, mix that went down way too quickly, this is very solid example of the Schwarbier style. Now excuse me while I go find another bottle..."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a nice burnt tan head. Good retention and lacing. Smells of fresh brewed coffee, roasted malt, and a touch of grass. Tastes of caramel and roasted malt, followed by bitter coffee, grass, and a touch of citrus in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Great roasty flavors but not too overpowering, smooth and creamy with a nice bitterness. Seems low enough in alcohol to session and is easy to drink."
"D: Great beer all around although it leaves a bit of burnt aftertaste."
"Thanks, BrewBakerE, for the opportunity and to mdaschaf, for the chance to re-visit"
"D- absolutely amazing! complex and sessionable!! shame this brew isn't year around. just one hell of a drinking experience this brew is a must try"
"Moon Lit is a quality and sessionable schwarzbier from Port. One I would like to see around here because I get in the mood often for schwarzbiers and there aren't many examples around these parts. I wouldn't hesitate picking this one up if I lived in the distribution area. Thanks again for the treat Bill!"
"D, notes: This is the best domestic Schwarz I have had. Will win awards. Kick ass - highly recommended."
"D: mighty tasty and sessionable"
"Light-medium bodied with great drinkability."
"Very much a session beer. Taste character of a stout, with the mouthfeel of a lager."
"HV"
"Port Moon Lit Sessions Lager is delicious beer. That's no surprise given the brewery that created it. Although it might not measure up to the style's heavy hitters, it's a dark lager that I would love to drink again. And again. And again."
"A very good Schwarz from Port Brewing Company, glad I had the chance to try it."
"Moonlit sessions is an extremely heavy schwarz. Pours a very deep black with some ruby brown highlights and a good fluffy tan head. Nose is mostly some roasted malts and good porter like burnt flavor. Taste follows. Huge roasted malts with lagery (thick lager) graininess. Gets a bit smoother as it warms. Carbonation is ample. a nice creaminess in there in the middle. Reaching towards a baltic porter type of robustness. Mouthfeel is nice, but is a bit heavy for the style. Drinkability is dampered by the thickness of this one. Overall very heavy and big for the style, but a very good brew. One I would surely return to if it were readily available. Big thanks to tayner for the chance to try this one and all the other fabulous beers she has sent me."
"D - VERY interesting beer and glad to try it. Would get tiring fast, though."
"Dark brown, nearly black with ruby edges. Quickly diminishing foam. Smells like a Schwarzbier should with notes dried chocolate, cocoa and dried coffee grounds. Flavor is well balanced, with schwarzbier dryness and notes of dried chocolate and fruit. Let's not get carried away here. It's a well made beer. I think Kidd Lager is better."
"Notes: From what i heard, this was brewed from the second runnings of the Serpent Stout. It does show some stout characteristics but is recognizably a great schwarzbier."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal uneven head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. What head there is slowly recedes to the sides of the surface, with average to good lacing. Aroma is dark malts, coffee, and an underlying fruitiness. Taste follows the nose, with slightly acrid coffee lingering after the swallow. Mouthfeel and drinkability both pretty good. Overall, not quite what I was expecting from Port, but not bad at all."
"Port did a really nice job with this one. I'm really impressed. I was expecting a good beer, but this is actually quite a bit better than I was expecting. I'm really not sure how the flavor could be improved. Perhaps it could be a little more complex, but that could potentially weaken what's a pretty good damn beer as it is. Check it out for yourself. Good stuff."
"D: Tons of flavor for a low abv beer. Excellent session beer/"
"Notes: A nice shift from the usual hoppy beers I regularly consume. My first Port Brewing beer, but hopefully not my last. Definitely a good session beer."
"Drinkability: Geez Louise, this thing's more roasty than some stouts, yet it still retains a pleasingly crisp body. Good stuff!"
"D - A tasty sessionable schwarzbier. I wish more breweries would make this style."
"Big thanks to Himerman for hooking me up with this tasty treat as part of the BIF Race '08."
"Very dark and opaque in color. Some decent head going on. Mellow aroma-some roasted and chocolate highlights. Soft malty flavor. Just great chocolate tinge to it. Mellow roasted flavors. Nice graininess. Very full and malty body. A great, great beer at 5%, so the label states. The whole package makes for a great schwarzbier. The great flavors and full body almost make me think of it as a porter. Would do this again and again and again."
"Notes: Great stuff, highly recommended."
"It has a light body , which I expected, the carbonation is fairly brisk, also expected, and it finishes with a bitter bite from the roasted and dark chocolate malt. A very nice and quite bitter brew."
"Man this a big beer for 5% alcochol. Just loads of coffee grinds and dark bitter chocolate flavors. A hint of caramel, comes through with a bit of a piney hop on the finish. Bready in the middle with a mollasses touch. Very dry and creamy in the mouth. A good beer but not neccesarily one I would session. Very complex Schwarzbier."
"Overall an interesting beer that is extremely sessionable (though the sticker price here in PA might be a bit much for most to have a true session with). Recommended."
"This is a style that I don't get to visit often, so It was nice to see a brewery like Port brewing one. Pours a cool black color, with very minimal heading, mostly just a small white lacing around the rim of the glass. Aroma has a very big presence of cola, smoke, and roast. Taste is roasted, with bits of mocha and chocolate coming through here and there. Body is medium, with some very nice carbonation in there to keep the feel lively. At first, the drinking of this beer seemed like a bit of a chore, but after one glass, I kept going back for more. by the time I was done with the bomber, I was craving more. This is an extremely drinkable dark beer. I knew Port wouldn't let me down with this one. Grab one or two if ya see it around. Cheers"
"A well-made effort of an entirely underrated style shows considerably more complexity than a traditionally light-bodied lager. Its smoky nature lends itself to savoring only 1 or 2, but an enjoyable 1 or 2."
"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured an opaque black with ruby red highlights around the edges. One inch tan colored head eventually settled into a thin consistent skim of foam. Scents of chocolate and roasted malt. Some thin lacing with decent consistency present during the session. Nose consistent with flavors, as well as the presence of coffee and some lingering hops bitterness at the finish. Not quite medium-bodied, with a lively mouthfeel and a mild carbonation burn. Consistency is somewhat similar to a stout, but light enough to be sessionable. I've been drinking quite a few schwarzbiers lately, and this one is quite good; however, not the best I've had. A little to much lingering bitterness makes this less of a go to for me relative to the style."
"D: at 5% and the amazing flavor, this beer is a great ""session"" brew. extremely drinkable."
"I like this beer, and while I could drink several pints in a sitting, it might be wise to change it up as the flavor gets a bit one dimensional after while. Overall: Recommended..."
"D: Pretty good, light alcohol and light feel make this sessionable, for sure. Flavor is pretty basic but solid. Don't have anything to compare this to, the closest I can get is a basic porter, and this is probably as good as any of those I've had. Doubt I would rush out to get this again (not that I'd be able to find it anyway), but a decent brew."
"Overall, a nice take on the style. At 5.0%ABV, it's definitely got the makings of a good session beer."
"Overall, I thought this one was outstanding. One of the lighter of the brews for LA and it still works very well. I could easily see myself drinking this on more then one occasion and I ma glad I bought a few more to enjoy. A quality ale here for sure that I would have to recommend you to pick up."
"Glad to see Port took a break from making all the strong beers and thought about some light stuff for once, not that anything they have ever done has been bad, will be drinking this again, good beer at a great price, recommended"
"Thanks to seaoflament for another great trade...time to get to a couple from the first! :-)"
"Pours a full black with a creamy one finger tan head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is very minimal, but some is there. Smell is of roasted grains, smoked barley, and some burnt popcorn. There are weak chocolate and caramel malt aromas in the nose as well. Taste is bitter coffee grinds and charred grains. Bitter earthy hops and scorched marshmallows on the tongue as well. Such a flavorful lager, perfect for this time of year. Somewhat dry and smokey in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and soft with a steady carbonation. What a perfect session beer. Lots of flavor which leaves the taste buds begging for more. I wish I had more lower abv. beers like this in my fridge."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability of this one are the strongest points. They call this one a session beer, and that's a great name for it."
"Interesting brew."
"Well carbonated, and thin mouthfeel. This wouldnt work for a stout or porter, but for a session lager it has a great mouthfeel. I think because it is a dark beer with a lot of the same flavors associated with stouts and porters people forget it isnt one and doc the mouthfeel for being too thin.. but that is why i like this one. A true 5% abv session beer that is full of flavor with out the alcohol to limit me to one. I could easily session this one all night, and at $3.99 a bomber it gets a good drinkability mark for me."
"D: Kind of a disappointment from Port, at the end was not really enjoying this one, a fair effort."
"Highly recommended."
"22oz bomber bought at Walnut Liquorette, poured into a pint glass. Dark, opaque black with an ample brown head. Good chocolate and coffee aroma and flavors. Medium-light bodied, and very drinkable. Went through the whole bomber before I knew it! I wish I had more!"
"Bought from South Bay Liquor. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Dark with a small brown head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. But in a soft way, not like a stout. Tastes exactly like it smells. Chocolate at first, then coffee, finishing with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is unfortunately on the thin side. Not a complex beer by any means, but extremely pleasant and very easy to drink."
"Recommended. I need to find out if this is a true schwarzbier (instincts say no), but at 5% this makes for a really flavorful session beer. This is most definitely worth a try."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Probably the best black lager I've had so far."
"Drinkability is moderate, this is a solid lager from LA with a good malt profile, big coffee/roast/smoke works well for this style, the alcohol is well-masked, this hints at the quality and body the Serpents Stout will bring"
