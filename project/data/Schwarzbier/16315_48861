Very likable and very… mixed. Definitely not fitting in with the classic “schwarzbier”, though, IMO.","wl0307","Feb 01, 2013"

Aroma is smoked malts right off the top. Dark, evil, with hints of campfire, peat, dark roasted chocolate and a good bit of almost a licorice touch to it. As I take the first sip a rich and creamy feel overloads the senses. Wonderful and rich, dark and foreboding, it seems that it is just meant to be evil and dark. Loads of roasted and smoked malts just rolling across the tongue. Lightly dry finish leaves just enough room for a small amount of smoky flavor to pop its head in","mikesgroove","Oct 11, 2011"

The smell of the beer was of Chocolate and roasted malts. It smells pretty typical of a Stout or Porter more so than a Schwarzbier. The taste of the beer had most of the same things going on that were on the nose. The mouthfeel was smooth and had a light carbonation to it.

Taste is a decent roasted malt with a little bit of bittering hop presence. Again, the taste is a little thinner than i would like. I would prefer a little more toasted flavor here.

Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a dark brown/black color with about a half inch cola-like tan head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but stronger, with a good roasty flavor and a bit of smoke. However, there's also a chalky flavor that I don't exactly care for. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it seems a bit thin, and it's well carbonated. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and not hard to drink. Overall I think it's a decent brew.","bluejacket74","Jul 17, 2010"

2.91,-20.3,4,3,2.5,3.5,3,"I know when I think of the term ""zeitgeist", I think of goth sheep. At least I think that's what's depicted on the bottle... If only I'd had the bottle to look at while sampling this brew... It pours a very dark, though still clear, garnet brown topped by a finger of tan foam. Schwarzbier all the way so far. The decline of this dark (and apparently self-aware) civilization begins in the nose: floral hops, dry dark coffee, dark wheat, and an obvious note of chalk. It is this chalkiness that will serve as the dagger that eventually brings this brew down. The other elements of the nose reprise their roles for their debut on the tongue, though the coffee is heavily watered-down. Some dark chocolate powder makes a cameo appearance, but it makes the most of its few lines, inciting a riotous laughter that elicits praise from the critics in attendance. Unfortunately, it couldn't make up for the absolutely hammy performance of the chalk, whose scenery-chewing and over-the-top ""emoting"" (think some of the stinkier performances from MST3K films) drag the whole production into the crapper. Had Bialystock (...that's how his name was spelled, right?...) and Bloom had produced this script, their scheme would have gone off hitchless. Thankfully the body is light, as is the carbonation; otherwise the whole thing would be abysmal. Instead, it's just kinda bad. Big letdown from the boys from Scotland.","TMoney2591","Jun 09, 2010"
