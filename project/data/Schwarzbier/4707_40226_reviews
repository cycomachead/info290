"Pours a slightly hazy reddish brown color with a thinnish off white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of chocolates and sulfur. Faint earthy hops try to provide balance but can't muster the strength to battle the maltiness of this brew. The flavor follows the aroma with sugary malt and a hint of chocolate and some miner off flavors. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet crisp mouthfeel. Decent beer, but really nothing special. Thanks for the state tick, but not a great beer for the style."

"Tastes of roasted malt, burnt grains, light caramel, smoked or burnt wood, yeast, light hops and a little citrus zest that leaves a slight bitter pucker; malty, smoky flavor overall that's decent, but not very complex. Heavy body with medium carbonation and a light, smooth mouthfeel. Overall a decent beer."

"O - Good beer, glad to have the chance to try it and would definitely like another, hint, hint, like to give other beers from this brewery a shot."

"It's a decent beer, but no head turner. Seems it was more enjoyable from the tap."

"Beer is medium in body and quite sweet but not in a cloying way, it is almost boozy but the finish is excellent. I would recommend this beer as a sweeter interpretation of the schwartzbier category to anyone interested in dark lagers."
"Roasty, clean, with just a touch of smoked malt. Pumpernickel bread, grassy, earthy ops, and just a little watery coffee. Good session Schwarz!!"
"Overall, not bad but not special. I prefer the Samuel Adams Black Lager. if they were to remove the lactose sweetness, give it more body while also giving it more of a bite. probably would choose a different schwarzbier if one was available"
"This is kind of like a crisper, more refreshing brown ale. By that I mean it's lightly bitter, medium bodied, and really drinkable. Only instead of going for nodes of nuts and biscuit, this tries to be like a really easy drinking, lagered version of a stout. In that respect it succeeds pretty well."
"Enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, ok in a standard pint glass. Pours a thick dark brown color with no head at all. Aroma is very week with smoke and malt characteristics. The taste is very smokey and malty, with some hints of chocolate and coffe. The mouthfeel is fairly empty an watery. Overall worth a try because it's cheap."
"12 ounce stubby bottle. The label classifies this as a black lager, and the pour doesn’t disappoint. The color is a dark brown bordering on black, with a slight head that is more foamy than it is creamy. Head retention is better than what I’ve seen in other Choc beers. Likewise the aroma is strong, with some notes of coffee – specifically dark and earthy like coffee grounds. Some chocolate is there but it’s a supporting note and not the main focus. The first taste reveals a charbroiled meat, caramelized steak like afterfinish. One thing I can say for the Choc beers: The flavor profiles are certainly unique. Further exploration of the taste profile yields a nice chocolate note that really shines at the end of the taste. Toasted malt is present throughout. My only complaint is that I’d like this beer to be more chewy, as the relatively thin body sort of washes away under the complex flavor profile. The carbonation seems to be a little heavy handed as well. This is a beer that I think could benefit from a bit more of an aggressive streak, as the flavors would work great in a robust Baltic Porter or Russian Imperial Stout. Here however, they all come rushing out in the beginning but are washed away much too quickly."
"(from notes - tasted May 2010)"
"This beer looked great coming out of the bottle; thick foamy head and rich black color. The beer was definitely lighter in body, almost watery, and not refreshing of lifting. The taste was pretty flat, not very much bitterness. I was expecting more aftertaste but not much to be had."
"Lighter body, with too much carbonation. Almost a prickly feel. However, that would be my only real complaint. Pretty simple and clean."
"D: Easy drinker, goes down easy. Good for a couple as it is a bit filling. Well worth a try. Never expected a quality brew like this from an Okie brewery."
"D: Great drinkability, the drink lends itself to being a good ""after dinner"" beer, although it definitely lends itself to all occasions."
"I'm trying to think what this lacks compared to others of this style that I prefer. Drinks fine - reasonable taste, lighter body."
"Good mouthfeel with just the right amount of mouthfeel. And very drinkable. This one disappeared fast."
"This is a smoky/toasty beer. It's chocolate and coffee flavors are pronounced but not too bold. Goes down very smooth. Highly sessionable. I will definitely be picking up more of this brew."
"D-Carbonation is an issue here but overall this drinks pretty nicely....pretty heavy on the roasted malts and cocoa....would love to see a bit more carbonation and some noble hops added to the mix to tone down the sweetness a little.."
"Overall, this was a pretty good black lager. A little too heavily roasted for my taste to have more than a couple, but this is a nice, flavorful beer worth trying. Thanks to Chris for the opp!"
"The body wasn't too heavy, given it's still a lager it was quite easy to drink. The carbonation was sharp and left a nice tingle in the mouth after the brew was a memory."
"D: A very nice, mildly sessionable beer. Would go great with certain food/dessert pairings. One of the more enjoyable lagers I've had. Mmm"
"The beer is pretty sessionable, drinks easy."
"d - Tastes alright, but I wish you could taste some of the sweet in the malts rather than all burnt bitter."
"d - I did not care for this at all was very hard to drink for me however i know a few people who love this type of beer so i will be getting it for them...just becuase i did not enjoy it i would discuarge"
"d - I kind of liked this black lager. I enjoyed the smokey chocolate taste it had, but wish I could have tasted the sweet malts a little more. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this again, but if I saw it I might give it another try."
"Overall a decent offering. Much more mild in character than expected, but there were no off flavors."
"Very drinkable and top notch Swarz."
"(12 oz. bottle into mug) Poured a rich black color with a creamy tan head that left little to no lacing on the glass. Nose was heavy with a toasted chocolate and caramel, with a hint of coffee. Drink was surprisingly smooth, and unlike other schwarzbiers I have tried, the roast was not overpowering, but well proportioned with the other flavors. As the glass warmed a little, this smoky flavor faded, and the chocolate malt took the fore. A very very refreshing drink after my meal. The perfect pick me up on a snowy day!"
"D - This is generally a style that I don't care for much bit I'm enjoying this one its got a good taste thats easy to drink worth getting sometime to try"
"very tasty. i could have a couple of these back to back. this one went down quickly"
"Buy this beer. For sure."
"A nice beer that goes down smooth begging you for another taste."
"D - Nice flavors, not overpowering, not a lot of hop bitterness or flavor...nothing over the top. All this makes the beer very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is a nice combo of prickly bite & creamy foam, medium body. I have a feeling I'm going to buck the overall trend in the ratings -- I was pretty impressed by this low-ish ABV lager, flavorful without weighing too heavilyon the palate. I would've mistake this for a porter if I didn't know better."
"D: Easy to drink and pretty flavorful in the nose and mouth."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured into a standard pint glass, pitch black with a slight white head. The nose was slight, perhaps roasted malt. The flavor was sweet with roasted malt. The finish lingers with a mild bitterness. This is light in body and easy drinking. Even though this is not my favorite style I enjoyed this."
"D: Definitely an easy drinker in terms of alcohol ""punch", but the acidity/sourness detracts somewhat from the drinkability."
"Medium bodied and carbonation is spot on. Overall, a solid Schwarzbier with a little bit more roast than traditional German examples and enough hops to balance it all out."
"D: flavor kills it."
"The beer is well carbonated and has a nice body and crisp finish. The low alcohol combined with the coffee flavor is a nice combination."
"If I get another chance, I would like to review this one again."
"Drinkablilty is excellant. Could be a nice session type brew."
"This is a great beer. Choc continues to impress me with drinkable and subtle beers like this one."
"Pours a black tinted mahogany with a thin tan head. Nose has roasty malts, chocolate, light hops and tart fruits. Taste has a strange blend of sour rotting fruit, sweet caramel and black malt. Terrible balance, hard to finish the bottle. Had to kind of chug this one. The sourness really ruins the beer. Thin body a bit syrupy. Definately unique, but nothing close to even a moderate example of the style."
"Overall not a bad beer at all. Really a very intresting take on the style with a light spiceness that really made it stand apart. Overall I have had better in the style, but this one was still pretty damn good."
"Taste is a touch on the sour side lending a bit of an acidic flavor. The large amounts of chocolate maltiness found in the nose are not near as prevalent upon tasting. Body is about right for a lager and carbonation is decent, if not a bit high. Not a bad brewski, and is one of the better Choc beers I have had."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, but see Smell and Taste notes above. Wouldn't say 'never', but there's not alot bringing me back to this one."
"Drinkability: ""Miner Mishap is truly a one-of-a-kind original."" They're right in that regard. Seemed like this would've been the one to have potential were it not for the quality control issues."
"Pours a dark root beer color with a small tan head that quickly dissipates. Smells of sweet fruits like apricots and plums with a ton of adjuncts and an awful chemical note present in the nose. First sip is all cereal with a chemical favor that is from the turpentine family. Nothing special here. Turn a way. Close the mine."
"I always love trying to find local Oklahoma beers and I picked up a 6 pack of this up at Joe's Place in Norman. Pours a dark brown with a thin bubbly head with no lacing. Smelled mildly of coffee, sweet chocolate, caramel. Tasted like a mix of a porter and a pilsner if you ask me. All the other Schwarzbiers I have had don't taste like this. It was good though."
"I'm amazed that this comes in at a B- overall on BA. Perhaps I'm not completely up to the style guidelines for this one, but I prefer to judge a beer on how I enjoyed it rather than style."
"Nice offering from Choc."
"Thanks to mugglesandhops for the beer. It's my first OK beer."
"Didn't enjoy this very much and wouldn't return. Seemed a one-trick pony, and the trick (roast) isn't all that impressive to begin with. It's also not a favorite style of mine, but even when holding it up to others in the category, it pales."
"poured dark brown almost black looking, then when held to the light looked more of a dark red color. nice 2 finger head which quickly dissipated, light lacing. Smell has a lot of malts and chocolate, sorta had a espresso smell to it. It was a bit more watery then i had expected from the looks and smells of it. flavors are pretty much like the smells, except im picking up a strong flavor of metallic. not a bad brew, but i was hoping for more out of this one."
"A nice example of a style I haven't had too many times from American brewers. Its also one from a state I've not yet had a beer from! Thanks htomsirveux for this via trade."
"Sometimes after a hard day a good simple, straightforward beer is what you need. Sometimes you just need to leave the complexities of the world behind, thus the Miner Mishap was a no-brainer for me today. A very hard pour results in virtually no head, but after a second a little fiz rises to the top, through the middle of the dark brown brew. Smells of roasted nuts, toasted malts and maybe a few hops hiding deep in the shadows. The taste of the malts is a bit sweeter than the aroma, and there are some very subtle caramel notes as well as some hops and maybe some coffee beans. This fit the bill for what I was looking for. And while it's could use a bit more in the taste department, I'm not complaining, and am going to have a few to take the edge off the day."
"I was very impressed by this one. Had the big flavor of a robust porter with a light body that was very drinkable. Could've sessioned these all night."
"HV"
"This is only my second schwarzbier, so I can't speak for how well it represents the style, but I enjoyed it. I couldn't see drinking too many of these in a sitting but two or three aren't out of the question. I'm almost tempted to drop a scoop of ice cream in one."
"pours a thin red orangeish black with a heavy thick tan head that disapers to a thin lasing on the glass, the taste is rich carmal and chocalat malts and powerfull hops that are kind of piney also hints of coffiee. the malt starts off sweet then gets sour and is overpowered by bitter. very little carbonaation in this one for a lager, this is a decant beer that i got in a bif that i am glad to have had a chance to try, would love to have more some day"
"Smells of cocoa licorice and maple syrup with floral hopping. Pours to a translucent dark brown with a medium bubble tan head. Taste is also a roasted flavor with a sweet middle and a chocolate dry after taste. Very light for the amount of flavor. Mouthfeel has good carbonation but is a little thin. This beer should probably be drunk a little warmer than most to allow the full flavor to come through. A tasty brew but I don't care much for the finish. May be the style but I would hop it a little more on the bitter side. Very unique and different but not something down my alley."
"D: Not a terrible beer, but I think it resembles a porter in the taste department despite its lager origins."
"Seems to me that the flavor and the appearance of this beer really don't match. It looks like this brew is going to be thick and dark, but the flavor is very light and a bit watery."
"Drinkability is very nice and I could make y way through a couple of these brews."
"Drinkability: Overall a pretty tasty brew. I'm not always happy with the selection of the beer of the month club, but this was pretty good."
"D - Very tasty, but not what I expected as a scwarzbier. Overall pretty decent stuff."
"D - This is a very tasty, very easy-drinking schwarzbier."
"Pours to a thin tan head. Color is hazy dark brown/black. Aroma is malty, with mild roasty chocolate notes and a bit of vanilla. Flavor is a mild blend of caramel malt and black malt. Hints of dark chocolate are evident and a good dose of noble hops to balance the malt. Not very sweet and somewhat sharp tasting. Finishes malty with a lingering roast and vanilla character. It is dead on for the style as far as the yeast contribution to the flavor--that is to say there are no esters to speak of due to the lager yeast fermentation. As for the malt flavors it edges into dark brown ale/porter territory such as Turbodog. I've had the homebrew version of this when I lived in OK and this is just as good as that one if memory serves me."
"This is a medium bodied beer. The carbonation bites a little on the tongue."
"D : Not bad but not a schwarzbier. I'd rather go for a beer truer to the style."
"Tasted on 6/22/08."
"D - Despite it's somewhat disappointing flavor, it's a drinkable beer."
"Beer of the month June 2008 selection. Into a 12-oz mug, this is a dark, slightly cloudy beer with a very thin layer of foam on top. Nose is cocoa-ish... actually it resembles the milk chocolate mix for chocolate milk, kind of dry and flaky. Taste borders on unpleasant, to me. Raw chocolate with an unpleasant sourness. Odd tasting. I couldn't finish the glass."
"Pours a dark brown, a bit murky after I poured the bottle's sediment. (Side note, this is a very tight twist off, use an opener.) This beer isn't bad once it warms up, but cold or even cool, it's bit bland. Now the aroma has a lot of milk chocolate with a hint of burnt grains and husk. The flavor has a dry, slightly bitter cocoa (call it semi-sweet I guess) taste that dominates. There's also a bit of sour malt feel, sort like in an Irish stout. All in all, this is a fairly tasty schwarzbier, but there are better options out there."
"Drank pretty good to me, not a bad Schwartz, a bit too dry for me"
"Drinkability here is average. I applaud the makers as its not bad at all, and if I'm in the area I'll be sure to try some, hopefully on tap. Thanks again Tim."
"This review is edited because my last beer of this beer a year ago has changed 180 degrees. I believe the beer I got last year was either old or a bad batch. I have had several now in the sample packs sold and I find it to be one of my favorites. Completely different than the beer I tried and reviewed a year ago."
"Drinkability is excellent and makes this one a perfect session beer when your tastes run darker and roasty. MMM roasty"
"Poured into a snifter. Miner Mishap pours a cloudy mahogany with a slightly off-white head. Decent head retention and pretty nice lacing for the style. Very faint aromas of cabbage at first, some white pepper, actually I am picking up some vinegar as well, but these aromas are not powerful. Very pleasant sour flavors. Slight hints of roasted malts. The finish has some cabbage and metallic flavors. Mouthfeel is a little thick, but the beer is crisp. Carbonation level is a little high for the style. Overall, Miner Mishap is not bad, but schwarzbier are not my style. I feel the beer could improve on certain points, but it is a good representation of the style."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink to drink for a while when you're in the mood for a Schwarzbier."
"D - Would purchase again. This beer has first-sip likeability if you're in the mood for sweet. Very easy to drink and a good transition beer to the darker side."
"Pours a dark black with a quick fading tan coarse head. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, roastedness, and some hops. Taste is tight and somewhat complex. Initially presents with a dark silky roastedness with some more chocolatiness that transitions quickly to tingly, spicy hop notes. The finish lingers for a bit. A good Schwarzbier and a nice offering from Choc. Definitely worth checking out."
"Pours a pitch black, with a medium tan head. Smells of chocolate and toasty malt. Tastes like dark chocolate, and roasted malts. A nice kick from the bittering hops. Mouthfeel is full, slightly high carbonation levels. Quite drinkable, this would make a good session beer."
