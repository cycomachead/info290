4,0,,,,,,"Once more, I heard a hissing when Pop!ping the cap, so either it had a snake in there or it was heavily carbonated. As I began even the gentlest of pours, it quickly became obvious that the latter was the case. The four-plus (!) fingers of light-tan head were dense and long-lasting, adding to my frustration. It just sat there like a dollop of coffee ice cream, refusing to fall and evidencing great retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM =44) with NE-quality clarity and garnet highlights. Nose had a rich coffee-like bitterness along with a dark chocolatiness. Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery, despite all of its carbonation. The taste was very evocative of a dark chocolate candy bar! Dark chocolate, coffee-like bitterness and even a charcoal smokiness made up the taste in this one. Finish was dry, bitter, kind of like powdered cocoa.","woodychandler","Sep 12, 2014"

The taste is of chocolate and dark wheat with an edge of bitterness in the front of the palate.  The fade is sweet dark malt.  The mouth is slightly sticky from the malt.","Franziskaner","Aug 05, 2014"

Nose of subtle smoke and char, richly sweet nut and earthy tones in the backbone. Flavors are an earthy and smoky blast forward, with bitter coffee and bittersweet chocolate in the backbone. Smoke and peat permeate every sip, on a slick, light body. The aftertaste is very bittersweet, with a solid, subtle, smoked linger. Slick, solid, lingering finish. Very well crafted, balanced brew.","GarthDanielson","Jul 23, 2014"

The aroma is delicious in and of itself with a huge roasted malt aroma, deep and rich. The taste is equally malt-forward with just a subtle hint of earthy hops to balance against the malt assault. It has a nice mouthfeel, not too heavy or light. This is a great example of schwarzbier.","delta490","Jul 08, 2014"

4.01,0.2,4.25,3.75,4,4,4.25,"Overall /Drinkability: Nicely bitter but in a very refreshing way. Overall I found the beer actually quite nice - it paired well with food (sloppy joes) and I think I could sip and savor one as well. Interestingly, despite how much I enjoyed it, I only want one right now. 12oz seems to be a perfect serving for one evening. So in that regard, it is overall very satisfying to the point I don't want another one. Or at least another one this evening. I might have to get a six pack and try it over a few nights and see my enjoyment carries past one evening.","damndirtyape","0"

Smells is a fantastic roasted malt and chocolate, but with a bit of something maybe cola-ish in there as well. It's really quite enticing! Flavor is amazing - to me, this is the best-tasting schwarzbier out there. It's got a very heavy roast going on, but it also manages not to be too bitter and has a great lightness to it that makes it incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is also quite fantastic, highly carbonated and light, which is just as it's supposed to be, goes perfectly with the roasty flavor. Overall, this is the best schwarzbier out there and right up there with Moonlight's Death & Taxes as the best dark lager in existence. To me, this is absolutely underrated style that incorporates the lightness/refreshing aspect of a lager with the roastiness of a stout/porter, and this beer does it better than any other.","starrdogg","Jul 22, 2012"

Smell is of rich malts, some notes of cocoa and brown sugar, a hint of coffee. Not a strong aroma. Taste is sweet and a bit on the chocolate end of the spectrum. A little hint of coffee, similar to the nose. A little hop ending to even out the sweet beginning. A good balance of carbonation to wake up the tongue. Creamy and silky to round it out.

Very, very dark brown but not quite black colored liquid, turns to a zinc orange around the rims where it displays much clarity. The nose comes across as much roasty/toasty than smoky, freshly ground dark roast coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, crème brülée, chicory, all accompanied by red grape, plum, cherry fruit scents and then a brush of oats and whole grain bread, suggestion of orange peel, however, remains firmly malty. Medium-bodied, same general impression in the mouth of more basic roast than smoke, the chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel flavors dry and about 2/3 bitter, 1/3 sweet. Given the dry mouth feel, the plum, cherry, blackberry fruit flavors have less of an impact here. The carbonation is moderately high and stirs things up consistently. More sweet grains than dough or bread, staves off some bitterness. Not a lot of refreshing lift but keeps plowing straight ahead, no questioning the length of the finish.

It has the signature Duck Rabbit flavor that I taste in all their beers, which I like, but I'd like prefer them to branch out a bit more. Still it's a nice addition to the lineup from a great NC brewery.","gabe23","Sep 08, 2009"
4.1,2.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D: A very good brew that really raises the bar for this style done in the US. It's still very easy to drink and a great beer for dark malt lovers. This may well be Duck-Rabbit's best beer.","argock","Sep 02, 2009"

4.22,5.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Notched freshest by 11/09. The lager appears a nearly opaque dark chestnut color with about an inch of creamy light tan foam. the foam lingers for a bit before settling to a thin layer. Awesome dark roasted grain and bitter cocoa are the first notes to attack the nose and taste-buds, followed by notes of slightly burnt caramelized malt, a touch of smoke and char, grassy hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. Very nice!","ClockworkOrange","Aug 24, 2009"
4.1,2.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Ah, a Schwarzbier. Served on draught at a local beer bar in the D.C. area. Dark, like black, in the pint glass. Thin brown head, the first smell I got Bock, the second I got porter. I could smell the malt, the alcohol (even though its low) and the smoke. Strong roasted malt character, I like this beer. Darks aren't my forte, but this was quite good. Smoke appears in the aftertaste, schwarzbiers are the porters of the lager world. Drink and enjoy, cheers.","drabmuh","Aug 23, 2009"
4.27,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"I'm always a big fan of schwarzbiers and think they're one of the most drinkable lagers. Although this one is heavy on roast flavor, it is still really easy to down and potentially one of the best American renditions of this German style.","deapokid","Aug 20, 2009"
3.95,-1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"On-cask at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. Appeared pitch black in my pint glass with a short tan head. I'd never had a cask schwarzbier before, but I'd have one again. The roast was heavier than most beers in the style and reminded me of lighter stout, but I'm not complaining. There was a delicious mocha and black barley taste with hints of bitter chocolate and licorice. Give this a try if you can find it.","tempest","Aug 19, 2009"
4.32,8,4,4.5,4,4,5,"This is a fantastically easy drinker...not sure on the abv, but this one goes down smooth. Definitely a sessionable beer with a ton of flavor. The only other schwarzbier that I've had in quantity is the Sam Adams Black Lager, and I think the Duck Rabbit is head and shoulders above. I would love to see DR add this to their standard lineup, as it could become a go-to.","dgfair","Aug 15, 2009"

3.91,-2.3,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Schwarz is just such a nice style. I think if more people got over their OMG A DAAARK BEEER fears this style could be a hit. It is so enjoyable to both the enthusiast and the layman. It is interesting and can be complex enough for the enthusiast but it is just so damn smooth, rich and clean for the layman. Easily approachable. I've had some success recommending Schwarz to folks looking to get into non-Lite beer for those reasons. Rich and tasty yet smooth and easy to drink.","nms1987","Aug 11, 2009"

3.83,-4.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This poured a nearly opaque dark ruby color with a fair amount of tan head. It smelled like roasted barley with muted caramel and coffee and some smoke. It tasted like roasted coffee and burnt barley, with some oak and smoke. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this had an interesting taste that was heavier and smokier than expected from a schwarzbier. Almost seemed more like a smoked porter to me. It had decent body, but nothing great, and was pretty easy to drink. The taste wasn't perfectly clean, but it was generally enjoyable. Given the limited nature of this beer, you can skip it without worrying about missing too much.","Pencible","0"
4.33,8.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The drink is medium-bodied and highly quaffable with mild carbonation that suits the brew and this drinker just fine. An excellent first-time offering that I hope to see in D-R's rotation again.","cvstrickland","Aug 06, 2009"

I missed their doppelbock when it was around (""around"" being a relative term, as Duck Rabbit kegs only occasionally make it up here to Virginia and less frequently to Charlottesville, but I imagine the doppelbock was not one of the few we got/get), but I hear that - in addition to this Scwarzbier - they'll be bottling their doppelbock next year as well as adding a Marzen to their lineup in the next few months. A trio of difficult-to-properly-pull-off styles from the ""dark beer experts"" (a tagline I still dislike, as I think it smacks of beer stereotyping, but I digress) has me looking forward to the next entry. Kudos, Duck Rabbit.","CrellMoset","Aug 04, 2009"

Lighter mouthfeel with a sharpness from decent carbonation. I have tried about five other US brewed swarzbiers and this stands out as being much darker (DR style), less chocolate and more coffee, and a bit hoppier in the finish.","rtratzlaff","Jul 31, 2009"
3.97,-0.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a dark almost opaque black with a decent head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is a decent amount of roasted malts, dried fruits, cocoa and slight coffee. The taste is a nice subtle blend of roasted malts with subtle yet present coffee, cocoa, and dried fruits with a decent hop backbone. The beer is quite light and refreshing, even on a hot summer day. This is a very respectable version of the style.","atsprings","Beers"

The taste was of coffee, caramel, and very crisp like a certain pilsners I've tasted. Overall, this beer was very good, and I was excited to be one of the first to try it at the Saucer in Raleigh North Carolina.","jhamilton84","0"
