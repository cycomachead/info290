Smell is of roasted malt, toasted malt, and cocoa. Taste is much the same with a slight smoke flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that has a somewhat dirty flavor and a better smell in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 12, 2013"

3.68,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"this is a very true to style beer, not hardly deviating at all from the traditional recipe. the pour is black but letting some light pass. the head is huge, three inches at least, foamy but airy, and with good staying power. i smell roast coffee, chocolate malt, and a lager yeast that is working wonders with this complexity. the flavor vindicates that, with some burnt sugar on the front end and bitter cocoa on the back end, tempered only by a touch of sweeter german malt and a yeast that has a tendency to calm everything down. this slides down the throat with real ease, and is much lighter than it looks is so many ways. it feels like a classic german dark lager, mellow fizz, creamy oaty feel, and a full body that doesnt limit how easily and quickly it can be consumed. this was delicious. not intriguing or challenging, but a beer you keep coming back to because its consistently well made. bravo for this.","StonedTrippin","Nov 18, 2012"

Aroma of light roast, smoke, some chocolate sweetness. Flavor follows with roasty chocolate and a hint of smoke, but very light. Kind of a very light porter with the roasty chocolate smell and taste. Finishes well with just a hint of smoky bitter and roasty chocolate lingering on the palate. Good beer.","BMMillsy","Jun 08, 2012"

It's great to wash down the salty happy hour special appetizers (e.g., house made chips with blue cheese, scallions, and bacon; mini pizza).

3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"There's a black patent malt presence to the otherwise mocha-ish flavor. Body is appropriate for the style (watery), which translates to being thin.

3.63,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Had the Schwarzbier at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a deep dark amber with ecru head that laced slightly. The aroma was sweet with hints of malt and espresso. The taste was a very good balance of grain, hops and malt with roast/coffee following. The was a slight sweetness that made the beer smooth to drink and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was ok, I need a little bit more body was coffee flavor is present, so I probably would not coose to session with this one.","WoodBrew","Aug 08, 2011"
3.53,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Anyway, this poured a dark brown with a thin, off-white head. Dark malts in the nose, moderately roasty. Not much else to speak of, as would be expected in the style. Dark roasted malts in the taste, hints of coffee, and not much else; little to no hops detectable. Medium bodied, and perhaps a bit thinner than some of the world's better schwarzbiers, but still good, and really the only GB selection, I desired to have more of.","Rifugium","Jul 22, 2011"

The aroma is mild coffee grinds and delicate prune. A bit too subtle but not bad. The flavor brings bright cracker and weak coffee. Generally weak in feel with a medium light body and fair carbonation. There's a slight citrus hop idea and dry finish. Pretty crisp and refreshing, interesting but kind of wimpy.

3.94,6.8,5,3.5,4,4,4,"This schwarzbier comes out of the tap a deep, opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head. Rich aroma is primarily of roast, smoky malt.

3.38,-8.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"T&M - Bold, dark roasted malts up front with sweetness in the background. Not much carbonation here. Somewhat thin in the mouthfeel and the taste leaves something to be desired. I wish there was more depth here.","MrIncognito","Dec 12, 2008"
4.03,9.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured dark mahogany brown (almost black), with a thick creamy tan head. Foam lasted almost the whole pint, and left nice looking lace. Toasted malt smell, a touch of smokiness. Flavor of smoky toasted grain, good balance between sweetness and hop finish. Dry and clean mouthfeel. One of the better schwarz'z I have tried.","BigBry","Beers"

4.3,16.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The fifth in the line of the 6x Sampler at the Rockville restaurant. This is the one I went to try and, while it was good, there were a couple of other pleasant surprises in the sampler that were strong competition for the Schwarz. The beer looked dark brown to black in the glass, with brown and ruby highlights--like a real syrupy Coke. Slight head retention with some bubbles visible on the sides. As with most craft-brewed Schwarzbiers I've tried lately, the smell was more "stout" than "dunkel" and, while perhaps not on par with the best Germans of the style, extremly fresh tasting and enjoyable. Nice roasted malt in the flavor... and that's about it. Nothing particularly complex, but extremely tasty and enjoable. Another one that would go down easily.","tugdriver7","Jul 03, 2008"
3.68,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Draught @ Washington, DC location: This one pours an opaque brown color. There was a tight, off-white head on it that didn't last too long but left some lacing. There were some roasted and caramel malts to the nose. It also had some earthy hop notes. The taste was along similar lines to the aroma, and was nicely balanced. Some roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, but no real sweetness. Earthiness and a touch of biscuit also. Perhaps a little nutty also. Nice.","Boto","Jul 02, 2008"
3.9,5.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"A surprisingly good one, enjoyed at the Washington DC outlet. A bit of carbonation, and chocolate malt. Light browncolour with a white head. Creamy, drying finish. Abit of sourness. It all worked and was very drinkable, despite having a few other beers that day, though none that burned the palate.

3.63,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"But is it any good or not? It's a very fine beer, but I find the malt character takes on a clean, caramel flavor that chases it through to the finish. This leaves the beer a little sweet and less dry than classic German versions. The added sweetness allows the beer to sit heavy on the toung and coats the palate with the muted carbonation. Otherwise, great head formation and retention with a nice roasted aroma / flavor, and a powdery sensation in the drinkability. Similar to dry stouts, but cleaner (due to lagering) and lighter.","BEERchitect","May 24, 2008"
3.58,-3,4,3.5,4,3,3,"I was served this beer from the tap & it was poured into a Nonic. It's very dark brown with a thick, dark beige head. It smells of toasy malts, smokey. The taste is roasted malts with scalded coffee & a hint of wheat. Not much aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little strange--a little watery without much carbonation. Overall, a fairly drinkable beer that is just a bit on the heavy side.","theghost3","May 14, 2008"

2.65,-28.2,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"D- I do enjoy this style of beer and this was a pretty watered down version. It tasted like a very light beer that had just a bit of black patent malt dipped in it. No much depth of flavor or interesting qualities.","rhoadsrage","Mar 18, 2008"
3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a nice black color with a slightly off-white finger of head that dissolves fairly quickly. No real lacing, but not a bad looking beer, with some nice brown highlights. Nose is mild roasted malt, some smokiness and a hint of coffee. Very light hops. Taste is likewise, fairly mild, but good if you focused your energies; smoky malt. Feel is medium to thin bodied, but not bad for the style. Overall, not a bad beer, and a good intro to the shwarzbier style.","soupyman10","Mar 01, 2008"
3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A brownish body with small head and little lacings. Dense beer that has a slight coffeesque smell but is full-bodied and not only has a malty taste, but reminded me of an oatmeal stout. This went down extremely smooth and was a tad milky/sweet. This is a good beer and up there with the Hefe as the ones to get at this GB.","clayrock81","Jan 31, 2008"

Light bodied, like all schwarzbiers despite the roasty character and isn't very full bodied I thought. This is more a knock against the style than the particular beer though, and it is decent for a schwarzbier. Not my favorite, but drinkable.","JDV","Jan 21, 2008"
4.57,23.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into regular pint glass by informed waitress. Jet black in color with a half a finger of head, laces remaining throughout.

An excellent batch and style in general.","Brianmerrilyn","Jan 18, 2008"
4.1,11.1,4,4,4.5,3,4,"It had a big, thick light-brown head upon arrival. The beer itself was a deep, deep-brown color with NE-quality clarity when held up to the light. The nose had a pleasant charcoal smokiness. The mouthfeel was thin-to medium with a lightly smoky taste on the palate. The finish had a lingering smokiness, but not necessarily a dry one, as suggested by the menu. As it warmed, I even got a black pepper bite on the finish.","woodychandler","Dec 18, 2007"

Nose has a toasted grain aroma, sweet with hints of smoke, caramel, maybe a licorice like tone, mouthwatering. Front has a splendid toasted malt presence, sweet with a delectable hop spicy bite at the back. Finish pleasantly acidic, hops spicy and delightful, dry lingering aftertaste, a great representative to the style.","Gusler","Jul 13, 2007"
3.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Brown-black color with a reasonable head. Solid malts in the smell, most a caramel. Nice flavor with the nuttiness (the food not the personality) coming through and some caramel and a touch of chocolate. Again it's awesome to see lagers can have an awesome flavor profile. Mild hops. Medium body and medium-to light carbonation make this beer super-sessionable. But that's my bias. Keep this in mind: beers do-not have to be light, crisp, and hoppy to enjoy in the summer. I tried this in the July heat of Tempe as was very pleased and refreshed.","wcdoyle","Jun 21, 2007"
3.62,-1.9,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,4,"I received a half-liter of pitch blackness. Some lighter orange hues showed up at the base of the glass when I held it up to the light, but otherwise this was a nice, dark beer. As served to me there was little head on it, but it did leave some lace on the glass as the beer receded. The aroma evoked a strong roasted coffee smell. I also got a smoky scent from this beer as well. Very appetising scent. It tasted crisp, clean, and dry. Notes of roasted malt showed up prominently, as did coffee and baker's chocolate flavors. Some dark fruit flavors as well, but I had a hard time placing them. The mouthfeel was weak; watery, but with a dry finish. I would have liked some more body in this department; this beer deserved it. Still, it was an enjoyable, highly drinkable beer, especially if you can get past the watery mouthfeel. Give it a try if you find yourself in a GB one day. Their beers aren't great, but this one passes muster.","Atlas1","May 09, 2007"
3.71,0.5,4,3,4,3.5,4,"This Schwarzbier poured a very dark, nearly opaque, brown-black color with creamy, tan foam that slowly settled. The smell was very modest with a note of malt. The taste was mildly roasted malty with mild cocoa and chocolate notes and even a hint of "malted milk" and coffee. The hoppiness was modest. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The finish was dry with the moderate hoppiness lingering. This was a good, drinkable Schwarzbier.","UncleJimbo","Feb 15, 2007"

It was fresh, which helped out, and tasted a little bit like my most recent homebrew (insert positive bias here). The mouthfeel was somewhat weak... it fit the profile of a schwarzbier, but lacked a little kick that I'm used to. It was, however, incredibly drinkable, and I would stick to this beer if I return again to the Tempe, Gordon Biersch. It was a pretty standard color, with the head being very nice, and longer lasting than most lagers I've had. Overall it's an impressive attempt, but not amazing.","dbalsock","Beers"

Good appearance, dark, dense color...no light getting through. Good size head that slowly dissipates to a solid ring around the glass. Average lacing. Taste was good, malty, smoky, slightly bitter but much more subtle and light than a porter or stout. This is a beer that could be sipped or guzzled with equal enjoyment. Nice rich mouthfeel for this style. This is a highly drinkable beer. I look forward to going back there and trying their other beers.","JayQue","0"

3.53,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Deep mahogany with ruby highlights and topped with a cap of small bark brown bubbles. Eventually the head disappeared completely leaving no lacing or trace of its existence. Aromas of gentle spicy hops, dark berries, and long-toasted bread. The lightly spicy hops cross the palate first, followed by a slightly sweet and nutty malt flavor that finishes with more hop spiciness. Medium-light body with a smooth, but crisp mouthfeel. The roastiness stands out during the middle, but it is the hops that fill out the finish. Not overpowering in any one area and easily drinkable. The low alcohol makes for a good session beer.","hopsaplenty","Aug 30, 2006"

A restrained aroma of roasted malt, toffee and some chocolate. Mouthfeel was light and spritzy with a slightly watery texture in the finish. Clean, uncomplicated and mildly sweet flavors of dark roasted malt, burnt toast, chocolate, mocha and caramel. Shows a nice balance between the sweeter malts and more bitter, acidic roasted malt contributions. A simple and refreshing beer which is a nice rendidtion of the style.","macster","Jul 22, 2006"
