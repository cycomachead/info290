"To quote Lloyd Christmas, ""I like it a lot."" I have enjoyed Face Plant on tap and from bottles during my last two Montana ski trips. Both versions pour nicely, with about a inch of foamy head that does not hang around. The strength of this beer is the taste - wheat, dark malt, and what I can only describe as ""Cadbury Fruit and Nut Bar."" I enjoyed this on a chilly New Year's Eve while watching he torchlight and fireworks."
"Overall – This is a quite tasty doppelbock.  Not super wheaty, but smooth, sweet, slightly fruity and rather easy drinking. And for the nice price, this is a good winter go to."

"I love Bayern brews, one of the best breweries in the state of Montana for sure, i love the dark taste of the Faceplant beer, I always look forward to the end of November not only for the start of ski season, but also the release of this magnificent brew! Cheers!!"

"Overall: I've been drinking Bayern beer since the 80s, and have never been disappointed. This genuine brewmeister makes the best lagers in this region, hands down- and perhaps in the entire country."

"O- Not my favorite style, but not bad by any means. Balances the hops and sweet malts well. Above average. Enjoyable."
"This is what we in the beer-geek world would call a “malt bomb.” Explosively complex, the decoction mash is tooled here with precision to create this amazing brew with tons of malt depth. Another beer that shows that German Wheats brewed by American brewers don’t have to be clove-and-banana palate killers."
"Overall: if you are really into bocks in general, this beer might work for you. I just think it could be a bit cleaner."
"12 oz single from ""LifeSource"" Salem. $1.79 Pours very dark brown almost black with a quarter inch tan head..daker than all the weizen bocks i have had. Very little aroma..which is a surprise for style what there is is spicy bubblegum Again the flavor is very poor for a Doppel weizen..its non-descript..yeah iots pleasant anough but not what i expected..malty,sugary. Palte is fine to be sure..soft and thick Very very dissapointed"
"Appearance is a dark amber brown supporting a steady healthy head leaving spotty lace. Smell is faint with dark malt, dark fruits and yeast. Taste of the dark malt, prunes and a little spiciness from the yeast. Mouthfeel has a medium body with a good spike of carbonation. For an American Weizen its not bad with the extra kick."

"Poured into a weizen glass. Pours a very dark red brown, two finger fine light tan head with great retention and lacing. Looks nice. Aroma of sweet malt with a hint of wheat. Flavor is rich sweet malt and dark fruit, only slight wheat and clove weizen elements. A slight rye-like sourness, but melds with the sweet malt nicely. Medium bodied with slight creaminess. Finish is a bit dry and has a slight hop kick with lingering malt flavors. Nice flavor integration. I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall, this is very similar to Bayern's other beers in that it is a very solid, highly drinkable representation of the style without standing out in any particular category. I'm happy to drink this at $7 a pitcher."
"3.8/5 Maybe...stats lie though....I will give a .2 margin of error."
"Overall: Drinkable beer but not worth seeking out."
"Overall (4): A tame beer for its dark colour, high alcohol, and 'bock' name. The weizen traits really shine through in the light malty wheat flavour and the creamy and easy-drinking mouthfeel. The power of the double malt is hinted at in the aroma and the colour. The higher alcohol content is effectively masked. Well done on an original style."

"Overall, I love this beer more than any other. It is sweet with a nice slightly roasted, chocolate type malt complex that is also blended with the flavors of a dark hef."
""
"Overall this is a decent beer that is worth a try. It is definetly different as you get bock like notes along with some traditional weizen notes."
"Would like to make the trek to SW Montana an try this on tap..not a bad substitute if the better Bavarian beers are not available.."
"Thanks, sholle, for the opportunity"
"While it's no Aventinus, this a solid beer and as best I can tell, a pretty authentic Weizenbock. Maybe just a little more malt to balance that sweetness, but this beer definitely grows on me the more I drink it."
"The body was thin for the style, a bit too thin IMHO. Drinkability was OK, I enjoyed the couple I had, and would have more, but it's not the first example of the style I'd seek out. Worth trying if you see it."
"3.5/3.5/3/3/3.5"
"It has a very light moutfeel, very easy drinking for the 7.5, something that really seems to warm up a winter night."
"Drinkability-A tasty beer and about as faithful representation of a German style as an American brewery makes. Overall nice, but not outstanding."
"Overall nice ale that is worth trying. It is quite unique because of the hefe aftertaste for such a heavy beer."
"D: At 7.5% this is very drinkable and smooth. Overall, pretty good especially for the price point in a sixer..."
"Dark brown body 1/2 finger white head, quick dissipation and minimal lacing. Big malt presence in the nose, not too sweet more bready, but some subtle hops on the back end. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel, it's obvious this brewery does lagers right. Too heavy tasting for my liking have to admit this isn't my favorite style. A big burly bock to be sure."
"Overall, a good beer, although I would recommend don't finish a six pack although you will live up to the name of the beer!"
