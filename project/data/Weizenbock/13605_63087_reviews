"Pint enjoyed on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. Obviously this hilarious politically-themed label has caught my eye during many trips to the bottle shop but for some reason I never did pull the trigger. Oh well. Here we go. Color is somewhere between golden amber and orange marmalade, with a light dusting of off-white foam, more lace on the glass than anything. Aroma is rather nice, the expected banana and clove notes accompanied by bright grapefruit and orange citrus. Palate is malt-forward but everything is well-integrated: Banana nut bread, golden raisins, marmalade, even something tropical (guava perhaps?). Body is solidly within medium territory, smooth and drinkable for a ""big"" style with a moderate prickly ""bite"". Finishes fruity and spicy, citrus and curry perhaps. Nothing sticking out like an ill-advised long gun registry. Nice winter brew that compares favorably with a few of the German classics."

"A%3A Pours a clear peach colour with 3 fingers of off-white head which quickly dissipated to a think film over the surface with plenty of lacing. %0A%0AS%3A Lightly spiced Belgian yeast with white pepper paired with overripe bananas. Strong malty backbone with a balance of hops. %0A%0AT%3A The spiciness of the yeast is much more apparent than was detected in the scent. Great malt backbone with a slight hoppy bitterness on the finish. %0A%0AM%3A Light to medium bodied with high carbonation. Refreshing and clean. %0A%0AO%3A Another great brew from TD which we are now lucky enough to get in BC."

"If I had known how refreshing and agreeable this beer was, I wouldn't have waited for a blustering cold November night to open it. Weissbier is for the summer. Bocks are traditionally for the spring. This beer is an amalgam of the two seasons, showcasing budding florals, greening spruce trees and fresh (not fermented) fruits. Shawinigan Handshake definitely isn't your Großvater's Weizenbock but it's a must try - especially for hop-heads."

"Overall. Tastes more like a hoppy belgian pale. Really nice stuff."
"Overall - Really nice, big time smell and flavor and great feel to the beer. Went deliciously down with my leftover Thanksgiving (Canadian) lunch."
"O - from what I remember seeing the original shawinigan handshake was much less pleasant than this, an oustanding way to commemorate a very funny piece of Canadian history, merci Jean Cretien!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of citrus and floral hops from the Chinook are dominant. Taste is also dominated by the hoppy notes form the Chinook with some citrus and floral notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. I thought this was an APA all along; the hops level overshadows the wheat notes."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"Bottle pours a hazy golden colour with brassy notes. Impressive retention on the white head and decent mouthfeel. Bready aroma is heavy on the wheat and German yeast. Appropriate for the style, but not my own personal preference. The banana elements are more obvious in the taste, within which the Chinook citrus notes really shine. A decently bitter finish that has a good crispness despite the lingering wheat background."

"Overall i was pleasantly surprised by this Weizenbock mainly because of the level of hops noticed yet still manages to maintain the style. Quite well balanced."
""
""
"Overall - A good weizenbock with traditional flavours (clove, banana, bready malt). Appearance could use some tweaking to hit the right colour palette and have better head retention, but otherwise a good show."
""
"Proper wheat beer to taste. Bitter citrus and fruitiness from hops on the palate. Quite tasty, not overpowering.Noticeable yeast to smell and taste. Slightly dry, lingering finish. Lots of things happening front to back which makes this an interesting beer to drink."

"Hazy golden orange colour, 2.5 fingers of white head with a good amount of lace. Lots of citrusy-fruity hops here, lots of orange and pineapple before the wheat aspects come through, banana and a light spice as well. Taste is loaded with fruity hops and banana, orange and tropical fruit, spicy with a nice drying bitterness, fruity in the aftertaste. medium carbonation and medium bodied. Solid stuff, could easily revisit this again, very drinkable."
"A nice strong weizen. Lots of flavour, intriguing and appealing palate construction."
"This is certainly a flavourful interpretation with lots of flavours vying for the spotlight. This has some cool interplay of fruity and yeasty character with the sprucy and peppery hop bitterness really dominating the finish. Balance issues at times, with aggressive flavours, but on the whole I found it an enjoyable and unique hopped weizenbock. Worth a try for sure. Tasty stuff. 3.75"

"Final Grade: 4.19, a solid A-. Le Trou Du Diable's Shawinigan Handshake is damn tasty stuff, although not exactly what I would call a 'traditional' weizenbock - the hop choice is decidedly North American in flavour, which causes this to come across as an IPA crossed with a weizenbock. Hop heads like myself will no doubt appreciate the interplay, although fans of classic weizenbocks like Aventinus or Vitus may be caught off-guard by the astringency. This is a beer I'd certainly recommend, though probably only to fans of hoppy brews in general - it's a quirky wheat beer, which, given the name and label art, isn't terribly surprising. A solid offering, and I am eager to try more Trou du Diable brews in the future."

"M - Medium body. Dry and slightly sticky. Moderate carbonation."

"A rather tasty weizenbock, bolstered further by the added kick of the west coast Yankee hops. So, a beer is a beer. What kind of beer? It's a beer. A beer is a beer. And when you have good beer, it's because it's beery. Q.E.D. - tabernacle!"

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, peach-gold coloring with a frothy, uneven, off-white filmy surface coating of head. Aromas of banana bread, cloves, subtle bubble gum sweetness, and sappy spruce tassels. Flavors are bready on the forward tongue, with heavy clove spicing and spruce. Banana and orange fruit sweetness blend together, but get outweighed by the initial flavorings. The carbonation in the beer and the light body results in an almost astringent, sharp feeling on the forward tongue when you drink. There is also an acidic characteristic on the initial taste that slowly calms as the beer passes through the mouth. Seems lighter in mouth than what I would expect for the aromas and the flavors. The aftertaste is woody and roasted, with a hint of spicing that lingers on past the quick, effervescent finish. The end of the beer is almost astringent again as it clears the palate. Decent flavors throughout, but the body makes it a tough one to drink for me."
"(3.75) D: This was tasty and something I would pick-up again. Likely not the most complex weizenbock but a very well put together offering that is both fresh tasting and smooth."
""
"O/D - Not too excited about this one. Spice was a bit much, and while it redeemed itself a bit later on, but I couldn't really get into this too much. Very simple stuff in my glass. Solidly crafted, but I expected lot's more. Wouldn't grab another."
""
"A very tasty brew indeed, a wheat beer with a bit of American hops (Chinook, in this case). Though it seems like an odd combination, it somehow works quite well"
"O - Came off as a strong hefeweizen with a good dose of hops. Quite drinkable."
""
"O - This stuff is incredibly drinkable, loads of flavour and I will definitely be grabbing more. Here's to hoping that more of TDD brews are included in the LCBO seasonal releases, because I'm loving what they're bringing to the table."

"Overall – I was expecting more from this on based on other reviews. There's just a bit too much of a rusty/acidic/metallic flavour and scent in it for me."
"I try not to judge books by their cover and if I were to judge a beer by its label this one would be one of the best. the liquid itself is also quite nice and I'd drink it again for sure, thanks again Yannick for the want"
"Bottle at Barhop. A weizen bock is only part of the story, fresh and well hopped. Banana and hops, lots of fruitiness. Fuller mouthfeel. lasting head and thick looking. Not something to have every night, and is a nice production. Aromas are toward wheat and spice."
""
"Overall, good stuff. Would certainly like to have this again."
"In the nose, it explode with hefeweizen notes and some hops that makes everything shine. Bananas with tropical fruits. Excellent aroma. Taste is another wow... so tasty, so good. Bananas and tropical fruits again... Brewery should make more beer tasting like this... and TDD should make this one a regular! Dry finish. Bitter. Some spiciness in the mouth. Slightly effervescent. Warmth. This is almost perfect beer. Next time I buy a case of this one!"
"Overall: A real nice hybrid of a beer. Worth enjoying but don't hang on to it too long as there's no potential of aging that i can see."

"This won't have me switching over from Weihenstephaner any time soon, but nevertheless, this is a very nice take on the style."
"Excellent example of the style, with a bit more bite than the German versions. Hits all the right notes of malt and spice. Highly recommended."
