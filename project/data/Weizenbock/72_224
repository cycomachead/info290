Tons of tiny, tight bubbles shoot up from the bottom into a large, merengue-like beige-tinted head. Carbonation dominates the thick-and-heavy mouthfeel.  There's a slight sweetness, with some banana, buttered popcorn, berry cobbler and a pepperiness, too.  The alcohol's also very present.  Great beer.","thebeers","Friday at 06:40 PM"

Decent complexity, malt gives this a medium-body, with a spicy, warm, slightly alcoholic addition and a long honeyed finish with hints of metallic carbonation. Slick, oily and pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. Aftertaste is sweet with toffee and bready malts, convert to a warming feeling in the stomach. Yeast does a lot of work here, without creating the usual "Weizen" impression. This is a warming and refreshing beer at the same time, with a great fruity body, completed by spices and a pleasant sweet finish.","aleigator","Oct 29, 2014"

Beeradvocate lists this as a "weizenbock" but they take different approaches to the style. Excuse my memory, but the Ayinger version seemed more what I would imagine a weizenbock to taste like. This reminded me much more of a dopplebock. While I will certainly drink a dopplebock, it isn't my favorite German style (although my second highest reviewed beer is a dopplebock... go figure). If I were to compare this to Ayinger's dopplebock: "Celebrator" I'd have to rate this one below that beer. Celebrator is at the top of the charts. This Schneider seems like a hybrid weizenbock and dopplebock together. I can respect that. It's tough for me because I'm not sure what I should review this as. A Weizenbock, a dopplebock, or just the pure enjoyment of the beer. The thing that this beer has going for it is that it seems like a dopplebock you can enjoy all year round. Celebrator is one of those beers you enjoy during the cold months. Its meant to be drank at a warmer temperature. This one seems like it would work even during warm days because its like it is asking to be drank at a cooler temperature. idk, just my take on this beer. Good stuff!","Fear4Beer","Oct 05, 2014"

And then the rich, powerful flavors grab a hold of you and won't let you go. The flavors are deep and complex, very intriguing with wild zig-zags of sugary sweet surprises all tempered with a tempered boozy edge and and most sublime bit of hop bitterness to temper the sweet peaks. The wheat really adds a nice fruity character to things. A nice hyper-hefeweizen/doppelbock synthesis.","beergoot","Jul 01, 2014"

4.43,2.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy chocolate brown pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and great lacing. Big malty, bready nose with hints of banana, cloves, chocolate, dark fruits, brown sugar, licorice, and caramel. The taste is rich and bold with tons of malty sweet brown bread. banana, plums, caramel, cloves, tobacco, chocolate, anise, apple skin, and some nice subtle citrus hop notes. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with prickly carbonation and a creamy and slightly oily finish. Overall, another great offering from Schneider Weisse. Kicking myself for living in Germany all these years and not giving Weizens a second chance. Will definitely have this stocked in my beer fridge in the future!","beerdrifter","Mar 04, 2014"

4.17,-3.7,2.75,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Summary: This beer packs a flavorful punch. It can almost be described as rich. Yet you cannot taste a bit of the alcohol. There's a definite sweetness. Again, not the most attractive looking of brews, but its drinkability makes that easy to forgive. It's smell is not strong, but very pleasant with sort of a combination of raisins, cloves and bananas? (I am just terrible at describing beer odors.) The glass I am using could be withholding some of its aromas. I may be writing sacrilegious nonsense, but this reminds me of the Rochefort 8 and I like this better. I recently had a Spencer Trappist Ale (see my review from yesterday) and I can draw comparisons between that beer's smell and taste to this Aventinus. There is an excellent finish with a very nice aftertaste. This is a great beer, but it is probably even better in the right glass with a slower pour and a more educated beer drinker.","kbrokhoff","Feb 09, 2014"

At university I’d routinely drink 2-3 of these bad boys when I’d sit down to write an essay. This beer made a significant contribution towards my graduating from that institution. Tap 6 Aventinus will always be a special beer for me and as such it’s hard for me to separate my assessment of this beer as a beer from the many happy memories it has provided me with and long nights it has accompanied me on. Funnily enough I started drinking it for purely pragmatic reasons; it provided the best balance between affordability, flavour and high abv., but over time I really started to appreciate it for the classic brew that it is.","abeeronthebeach","Feb 04, 2014"

I poured the bottle into a weizen glass and it appeared a nice dark brown color that produced an off-white/tan-ish colored, rocky, dense head that was very well retained. Loads of carbonation. The aroma was a wheat and some other spice or aroma that I could not pin down, but whatever it was really made the beer. The taste followed the nose perfectly and was followed by a nice sweet finish. If there is a better tasting beer for this style, I would be shocked. The beer had a medium body to it, it was extremely smooth, and had excellent carbonation. The only downside was that I did not have another bottle. As I said before, this may be one of the best beers that I have had, of any style. Outstanding and a must try for any BA.","PhillyStyle","Dec 10, 2013"

Pours up a beautiful reddish brown murk with ample light tan foam. Aroma grabs you by the olfactory bulbs with sweet brown apple, poached pears, molasses, caramelized bananas, and ample spice. The aroma is just a prelude. Palate is rich, full, sweet, and complex, with a ton of clove and cassia spice phenolics like its lighter Schneider weisse cousins (albeit on steroids), rich toffee, the aforementioned caramelized bananas, dates and plums, and a little wood or dry cacao powder to provide some bitterness. Chewy syrupy body stands out but the spicy punch prevents things from being overbearingly saccharine and I can certainly understand the comparisons to a Belgian dark ale. After a while all the spicy notes get earthy and bitter. Nevertheless, still has that wheaty refreshing character that you get from the best weizens. Another great "dessert beer", like Christmas cake in a bottle except infinitely better than the brick-hard shit that hides in your grandma's deep freeze. A world-class brew and I don't think the high ratings I have provided are too generous. If you are interested in more background info about this beer, read "Brewing With Wheat" by Stan Hieronymus. There are tech specs in there for this beer and Tap 7. Old school stuff.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 21, 2013"

The ruby red color and little head was different. This smelled so fruity I was surprised. Had Belgium all over it which is great. It is a yeasty malty wheat beer with the perfect blend of fruit.

4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, bottled on 9/22/2012. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, banana, clove, toast, raisin, prune, toffee, brown bread, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, banana, clove, toast, raisin, prune, pepper, brown bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy pepper/clove spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, banana, clove, toast, raisin, prune, brown bread, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely incredible balance and complexity of malt, yeast ester, and hop flavors; with an awesome malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and smooth mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Weizenbock! Big complexity and great balance of malt, yeast, and hop flavors; and super smooth to drink for 8.2%. Amazing.","superspak","Aug 19, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability to it, it was smooth, with lots of nice flavors to hold my attention, but it's a little on the sweet side so I think one 500ml bottle is the perfect amount. What I liked the most about this beer was everything, all aspects of this beer were right were they should be and done very well. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of single thing that I didn't like about this beer. I would for sure buy this beer again when in the mood for a really good Weizenbock and I highly recommend this beer to everyone. All in all I was very happy and impressed with this beer, it's the German Weizenbock I've been searching for and I'm glad I finally found it. I still think I like Black Forests Weizenbock just a little more, but for being available year round and I'm sure this will be my go to Weizenbock. I can't say enough good things about this beer, it was very good and everybody should try it, enough said.","StoutHunter","Jan 24, 2013"

But the reason I wanted it so bad was to try the original German version of Texas's Live Oak Primus. Don't get me wrong. Aventinus was good, but not nearly as good as Primus. It had a staleness to it. It didn't taste as alive and primal as Primus. It was therefore more boring. It had a good mustiness to it, but not much accompanying banana flavour that I liked so much about Live Oak's weizenbock. Still a very decent beer, though. I'll probably have it again one day.

Slight acidic twang mixed with the sweet roasted malt finishes it off perfectly. Cloudy and complex yet very drinkable and goes well with food. One of the best Bavarian beers available in bottles in the US it is a must try.","wattoclone","Jan 18, 2013"

Nice wheat flavor in this with a bit of spice. The spice and fruit allow this to finish with a smooth sweetness on the palate, and crisp enough to make very drinkable. Very nice beer, and my first of the style.","BMMillsy","Jan 16, 2013"

Poured a dark red brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, banana, spices, milk chocolate, and sweet fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, dark fruit, milk chocolate, spices, banana, fruit, grain, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The age really did a lot of good stuff for this one if I am honest. The flavors were quite complex and the aroma had really developed into something special. The alcohol aspect was completely gone and made this one really easy drinking for something with this ABV. I suggest setting a few of these aside to age in your cellar if you have the patience as this one was awesome at 6 years old.","thagr81us","Oct 27, 2012"

There was nice layering to the taste; I could taste malt, phenols, and wheat at different times which is a great and elongated flavor. Had the correct body and sweetness but did lack on carbonation.

This beer is very bready, has a lot of dark fruits and a caramelized taste and feel. This beer has a rather smooth feel but is still a rather massive beer. There is a slight sour bitterness to this beer that seems a bit out of place but doesn't hurt the beer, rather then set it apart from the others.

Nose is incredible. Typical weizen characteristics with bubblegum, green apples, banana and cloves. Taste follows the nose quite closely. Big malt notes with a nice touch of the dark notes which is a bit different than the hefe. A hint of fig on the end and a great complex blend which makes it hard to sit down. Hides the 8.2% ABV well. Feels is nice, but a bit watery. Good carbonation aand a bit lively on the tongue. Overall- A great effort and tastes like a hefe on steroids! Great fruit notes on the front, complex throughout. Love the apple quality and the blend of malt bomb and adequate hops. The fig hit was also a welcome surprise. Very solid brew that I will hit again-","TheDinger","May 13, 2012"

It appears to be well carbonated. There are smells of sweet malt, esters such as banana and bubblegum, and alcohol. There are other dark fruits such as raisin and prunes in the aroma as well. The flavor reflects the taste. There are sweet malts, fruit, and bubblegum flavors. There is some alcohol in the taste, but it's not very strong for a beer above 8% ABV. There yeast is also in the taste. There's a mild aftertaste. The body is light with abundant carbonation. The carbonation helps chase away the aftertaste, making this very easy to drink.

Smells of deep dark fruits, cherry wood, banana like yeast characters, and boozy red wine finish. Sour fruit hits the tongue with a bold cherries, grapes, raisins and figs and closes with a boozy spice finish. Medium bodied, bold and smooth, velvety on the tongue. Overall; this beer is great, and always at a fair price, very hard to pass up.","gabedivision","Feb 17, 2012"

4.4,1.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I'm a big fan of hefeweizens but not too crazy about this one, the alcohol is very apparent in the beer and takes away from the delicious fruitiness of the complex yeast. Drinkability is lower than weissbier due to the high alcohol. On the plus the darker beer brings out some interesting smells and tastes of dark dried fruit that you don't get in the lighter hefeweizen. Despite the aforementioned negatives, I do like the beer, just not something I would get very often, just too boozy. A weizen for the colder months.","VaterRoss","Jan 27, 2012"

Now I'm having it out of a bottle and it tastes much more like its own animal than like a dark Hoegaarden. Still some of that wheaty taste, but not nearly as pungently Hoegaarden-y. Tastes more like its own thing, almost like they aged it and it became more mature and some more sweet notes developed. I actually like this bottle version better.","BrownNut","Jan 23, 2012"

4.39,1.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is another example of why properly cellaring bottle-conditioned beers is a great idea. When this beer is fresh I find the yeast flavors to be too dominant with way too much clove, banana and spice, but here they play a lesser role to the dark fruitiness and the caramelized toasted malts. Really well worth the $7 outlay and I will definitely be purchasing this again (in bulk) next time I see it.","claspada","Nov 11, 2011"
3.43,-20.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Weizenbocks are not what I normally drink which is why I rated it lower than a Weizenbock drinker would have. It is worth trying if you want to try different beers.","jvillefan","Nov 09, 2011"

4.3,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours the color of a strong cup of tea with a two-finger head, the bubbles turn more into a nice froth on the top once the initial pour dies down. Smells of muted dark fruits, cloves, and a light winey character. The taste is round and very smooth. The dark fruits and cloves dominate but are all slightly rounded and nothing seems to overpower the rest, great depth with a slight sweetness and a dry finish - all this without tiring the palate. The mouthfeel is creamy and very nice. This is a great beer! The alcohol is hidden and no doubt this is a well made beer overall. Add to that the fact it's widely available and reasonable priced make me think this will be added to the lineup often. A local shop has some 2004s wrapped in paper that I think I'll have to grab just to see what this thing does with some age.","plumcrazyfx","Nov 07, 2011"

Poured from bottle into Aventinus tall glass a wonderful caramel color with a good amount of dense tightly condensed head of effervescent bubbles. Taste of malt and a very floral and carbonated burst of flavors all at once with a smack of warmth from the alcohol, but remarkably smooth and totally drinkable which can be a dangerous combo as I have had more then one or two in a sitting and found myself feeling no pain. Good good stuff that I could drink anytime and need to keep on hand more as my glass gets lonely for this dark amber colored devil.","Blueribbon666","Oct 01, 2011"

4.41,1.8,4.5,3.5,5,4,4.5,"O - I wish there were more doppelbocks like this. Very true to style, and very true to its composition. I find many doppelbocks too heavy, lacking finesse.

4.14,-4.4,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Initially it smelled and tasted a bit boozy - it does little to hide the 8.2%. I assume the bottle I bought was neither too old nor too fresh.

4.23,-2.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown w/ a slight crimson tinge if held up to the light. Nice two finger cocoa head that lingers for a bit. Good carbonation and decent lacing. Nose is that of caramel, apple, pear, malt, spices. Nose isn't as strong as I'd like, but it's still pleasant. Taste is the same profile as the nose, w/ noticeable carbonation. Goes down pretty smooth, w/ big malt/fruit feel to the beer. Fairly dry in the finish and aftertaste- really dry (but not bad). This is a really nice tasting brew.","jayhawk73","Aug 19, 2011"

4.07,-6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"From the bottle marked 10.315-0685-2822. Sampled on August 11, 2011. It pours into the Dopplebock glass an attractive looking dark amber with hints of ruby red and a significant fluffy off-white head that eventually settles to a ring. There are plenty of wheat and sweet malts on the nose with a minor whiff of hops but no alcohol given its 8.2% ABV. At first the body felt bold but then it seemed to feel thinner, more like the texture of red wine. A beautiful balance of sweet caramel malts and wheat grab the tastebuds up front, which are quickly followed by a solid sting of dry hops and a battery of spices. Nice beer.","puboflyons","Aug 11, 2011"

Here I sit wishing I would have bought a second bottle. I figured being an 8.5%'er, this would take me longer to finish, but I couldn’t wait until the next sip so it went down with ease. This is an outstanding Weizenbock beer. Too bad I can’t find it around in a 1/6 keg. I would easily invest the money in this one.

The average blonde haired blue eyes Utahite would saunter in with a sweet tooth for a simple Snickers or a Chic-O-Stick and be welcomed with Truffled Cocoa with dried ahi tuna or muddled marshmellow foam imbued with beef stock marrow. The price of Gretchen’s goods would leave a sour taste in the mouth of the most proper Latter Day Saint. Ultimately, Ms. Dulceberg’s sweet tooth was too obtuse for the average Mormon, but in Dresden, this place would have been a dunklesmash.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 15, 2011"

The aroma was complex with a dark chocolate malt and a sweet earthy yeast that had notes of clove, banana, vanilla and a mild alcohol scent. It tasted sweet and acidic with a mild hint of banana and chocolate in the begining and the become mildly sweet with a yeasty-sour flavor that had a nice spiciness at the finish with the flavor lasting only a short time.

Weizenbock can be tought of as (Doppel)bock whose grist bill includes some wheat malt therefore its organoleptic qualities should be a mixture of (Doppel)bock and German wheat beer. So,...the aroma is bock-like melanoidins, bready malt, ripened plum, clove phenolics, banana esters and evident alcohol. The palate is on the sweet side with bock-like melanoidins, dark fruits (plums and raisins), wheat flavor, clove and spicy alcohol that helps to balance the malt and brings warming sensation.

4.43,2.3,4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Aventinus pours a very dark purple, threatening to cross into brown. There are noticeable light red highlights around the edge of the glass. The bone colored head is dominating the glass, five fingers plus right after the pour, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon. Only downside is that lacing is a bit weak. The nose to me is like a clove forward hefe on steroids. A ton of clove, some banana, and a fair amount of vanilla-esque sweetness that I always get from wheat. No real hint of the darker malts used in this one though, which is a bit of a letdown. The flavor makes up for it though, as in addition to the aforementioned hefe notes there's a generous dollop of caramel and a dash of fruitiness (almost straight plum). The final piece that elevates Aventinus to true greatness is the slight, pleasant warming sensation from the alcohol. The body is great, nice and full without spilling over into a stout-like richness. Carbonation is similarly top notch, a bit on the low side but very sharp nonetheless. There's just something keeping it from perfection, I think maybe the body could stand to be just a touch bigger. This beer is just another reason (along with the eisbock, hefe, and Brooklyn collab) that Schneider is my favorite German brewery. A true classic.","axeman9182","Dec 30, 2010"

Heavy apple nose and present in the taste; interseting, and only revealed by aging. Curiously transparent ruby body, mucho sediment. Quite sweet, almost like a cider (Unibroue's Ephemere comes to mind), apple and honey are dominant. Wheat is curiously absent, considering the style (and the flavor of a young Aventinus). Mouthfeel not exceptional, some prickling from coarse carbonation. Taste is incredibly drinkable, but the price for a vintage is prohibitive. For those capable of cellaring their own, that might be an option. Drinkability is high unless you cloy at sweeter beers.","zaphodchak","Aug 28, 2010"

Rich, bready with a wonderful yeasty phenolic character, some chocolate, dark fruit (specifically plums and raisins) a mild clove character, a little bubblegum... this really is complex and wonderfully balanced. Caramel, a little vanilla and brown sugar are also present. The palate is just as remarkably balanced. Banana bread with chocolate chips drizzled with warm caramel and brown sugar come to mind, and despite plenty of sweet flavors, this never gets tiring on the palate. The wheat is noticeable, but never distracting, presenting a freshly baked dark wheat bread-like character. Clove, a little nutmeg and some cinnamon sugar are also present, particularly on the mid-palate. Raisins and plums also appear closer to the finish. The yeasty flavors aren't as prominent as the nose would suggest, though some phenolic character is present. Mildly sweet on the finish with a touch of alcohol, caramel and brown sugar, this is fabulous stuff. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this feels almost exceptional on the palate.

I can't say enough good things about this beer - every time I have it I am reminded of why I love real beer so much. The combination of flavors in the beer also makes it a terrific pairing with so many foods. Almost anything rich that has been grilled or seared is going to be great, rich tomato pastas and lasagna, hearty cheeses and thick soups work brilliantly too. The best may be desert though; flourless chocolate cake with a plum and raisin reduction sauce is the ultimate pairing for this game-changing beer.","StephenRich","Aug 23, 2010"

The taste is on point with a touch of astrigenty alcohol bite on the finish. Sugary, but on point with the style. Has a nice toasted marshmallow component on the finish. Mouthfeel is very very nice as its carbonated to all hell with a semi dry finish.

The taste is amazingly complex, balance like the smell with the taste of some cloves, and bananas. Excellent mouthfeel, and very drinkable, with the alcohol hidden well.

The body is full of dextrins -it is full with a smooth carbonation that keeps it from being cloying. Yet, both the front end and the middle of this beer have all of the flavor of a Wiezenbock. Spicy cloves, bannana, and bubble gum can be detected. Yet, the phenols are by no means over powering. This beer finishes with a clean, dry, crisp ending that is quite refreshing. Alcohol cannot be detected until the finish, but it doesn't overpower. Which makes this beer quite deceptive. It"s 8.2% ABV demands respect.

Settles in a murky deep brown, reddish color with plenty of sediment. A large, light tan head slowly fades to a finger thickness and streaks of lacing. Aroma is yeasty, dark fruits, cloves and bananas, but fairly mild and restrained. Flavor is as expected for the style and the most balanced representation I've tried. Strong weiss flavors of banana and clove with rich malt complexity like a bock. Very smooth, full body with light, but sharp carbonation. Finish is mildly sweet, fruity and clean. Alcohol is warming, but never really presents itself in the flavor.

Clove is present as well as plums and the slightest hint of chocolate. It's an earthy aroma. The chocolate makes itself more present in the taste. There's also a dark fruit mixture (figs, plums, raisins, and cherries) going on. Clove and nutmeg also make an appearance. It's got quite a bit of carbonation, but feels creamy and of some viscosity. The hefe-weiss aspect of this beer really helps with the drinkability. I tend to find most doppelbocks too sweet, but this didn't have that effect at all. In fact, drinkability is downright scary. No doubt I will be having this one again.","alkemy","Apr 22, 2010"

Good, but I had to hunt for some of those. Taste follows suit. It really is a good beer, though I remember that I liked it more the first time I had it.

Aroma of clove, banana, brown sugar and plum. Taste is sweet with plenty of caramel and brown sugar, as well as fruity notes of dried fruits like raisin and plum. Clove and banana dominate. One of the more clove heavy brews I have had. Wheat really only comes through in the very finish, but adds a great smoothness. Medium to full body, but with a great smooth texture that is all weizen, with none of the cloying stickiness that I take issue with when drinking bocks.

The beer has a sweet ice tea aroma, but with chocolate, cinnamon, and light clove. The blend of aromas is wonderful. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet beer, but the extended aging has imparted a lightness and delicacy that is remarkable. The sweet malt shines through beautifully in this beer, but with just enough underlying spice to counter the sweetness (which age has dialed down anyway). Mouthfeel is light, rich and long lasting... this truly is just an incredible beer. Drinkability is so good, that this beer is dangerous.

Also a nice malt backbone with a firm wheat flavor and a nice additional raisin/green apple fruitiness. Some added spices are noticeable as well like a bit of nutmeg. Hops are minimal and seem to act only to keep the beer from cloying. The fruity and spicy yeast-derived flavors are the real stars here. Huge carbonation as one would expect from a bottle conditioned beer of this style. Very refreshing with it's light body and massive carbonation. This is one of my all time favorite beers.

3.45,-20.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured with a nice off white head, deep amber color. Very nice looking beer. The smell was of banana, clove up front, alcohol towards the back end. Taste was pretty delicious, even though I am not a big fan of clove, estery tastes, this was a pleasant beer to have. It almost tasted of banana bread, with the banana, spices, and wheat and yeast combining to give it a bready feel. It has a nice body, a bit syrupy as it warms. Citrusy finish that stays in the mouth for a while. Overall I did enjoy this beer, perhaps the size of the bottle was too much, a 12 0z size might be more enjoyable. I would recommend this to any beer enthusiast, no matter what your style of preference.","Lldeegan","Oct 27, 2009"

You can pick up a little bit of sweetness from alcohol on the front end, but its not warming. Malt character makes the beer full bodied, thick, and hits the midpalate nicely. Drinkability is high, but due to high alcohol and overall heaviness of the beer, a slight deduction. I love this beer.","drabmuh","Oct 15, 2009"

When done right, this beer is quite a sight. The glass itself is quite a vessel to drink from. Huge white foamy head graced the top of the glass. Dark cloudy brown colored body. Has a spicy, dark fruit smell, almost like an aged rum. Very complex taste. Had all of the classic hefe flavors: banana, clove, bubble gum. Plus, the bock aspect of this beer really added a second layer of flavor - dark and malty. As one complete beer, it formed a champion of the style.

Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, with a tangy finish. Solvent character comes forward in the nose as the beer warms, but remains muted in the taste. It's like I can sit here and come out, sip after sip, with something different each mouthful. A hint of raisin? Medium bodied and finely carbonated. Smooth, creamy, and a little bit syrupy.

This beer brings a lot to the plate with the flavor profile. The wheat feel is big and rustic while being crisp. Yeasty maltyness carries with it graham cracker sweetness and an array of dark bold fruits including some raisin and fig notes. Mouthfeel is very full and much like sweet bread, overall very nice.

Aroma of caramelized bananas, like bananas fried until a dark brown color. Add a little bubble-gum, nut liquer, and clove spice, and you have a pretty sweet aroma happening. The flavor has a rich caramel quality, with bubble-gum sweetness, bread, and a hint of alcohol. Banana and clove are their, but don't manifest as assertively as in the aroma. full bodied with the same effervescent carbonation that you would find in a regular hef.

The dark fruit flavors and Complex Malts are made dominant due to the carbonation and Alcohol. The taste is just amazing and it does not feel like brew that would weigh you down and allows you to keep drinking. Carbonation is not over done but the Alcohol level may sneak up on you.

It was Schneider's creative response to bottom-fermenting doppelbocks that developed a strong following during these times", and I feel blessed to be able to drink "the original".

I unknowingly had a glass from the brewery from a previous trip to Bruisin' Ales that just happened to be the only glass large enough to hold the beer. I have not had any Weizenbocks before this so I did not know what to expect. It had a sweet taste and quite a bit of head which left some nice lacing on the glass as I drank it down. During my last trip to Bruisin' Ales I picked up a 2004 bottle of the Aventinus to try side by side against a regular bottle of it to see how it changes as it is aged.","eruckart","Feb 18, 2009"
4.6,6.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"For those who have not tried it and are skeptical about its universal round of applause: yes, Aventinus really is all that! It pours an extremely cloudy spectrum that ranges from a hazy yellow at the thinnest points in the glass to an impenetrable brown at its deepest, with a big, frumpy, tan head standing on top of it all. Its aromas span the spectrum of straightforward wheatiness at one end to complex dark fruits and spices at the other. Yeastiness also comes through loud and clear on the nose, as it does on the palate. Dark fruits including prunes, raisins, and berries, along with a nice toastiness and yeasty softness all blend on together in perfect harmony. For the past 5 years I've been having perhaps two or three of these per year. No matter how many beers in the same or approximate categories that I try, Aventinus remains one of my all-time favorites.","droomyster","Feb 18, 2009"

The flavors are clear and simply excellent. Rich sweet malt flavor with a slight chocolate and vanilla hint (upfront), clearer clove and banana flavors mixed with an inviting alcohol taste at the tail end. Spiciness sticks around at the back of the mouth for a bit. Nice amount of carbonation plays well with the flavors.

Medium-bodied with a great deal of agility, never once feels as if it has soaked into your palate until it has. More of that clove and anise spice, good deal of carbonation keeps any given flavor from achieving dominance. The fruit lowered in favor of wheat, half-baked bread although more banana here.

4.32,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a murky dark ruby brown in color (though it can be as light as a dark amber depending upon the point in the glass) with about two fingers of moussy, long-lasting light tan head. Aroma is quite complex and very intriguing. There is lots of bready malt, spicy clove and vanilla phenols, lots of dark fruit esters, some banana-like esters and a touch of perfume-like (roses) alcohol. Taste is much like the aroma. Lots of bready malt, some melanoidins, and a soft wheat undertone. There may be a good bit of malt character here (both wheat and barley) but the focus is the yeast character. The dark fruit esters (think plums, prunes and maybe raisins) are a bit more restrained in the flavor than the aroma but still present. The phenols range from clove to indistinct spicyness to hints of vanilla. The esters that are a bit more prominent are those classic to weissbiers: banana with just a mere hint of bubblegum. Alcohol is again present but it again lends a pleasant flavor component without being overwhelming. Mouthfeel is pretty good, body is a bit on the light side at only medium and carbonation is moderate. Alcohol is noticeable but its presence adds to the depth of flavor and isn't at all hot or solventy. Drinkability is pretty darn good. This brew is complex but nicely balanced and fairly nuanced.","mnj21655","Jan 10, 2009"

Well carbonated and spicy, the medium-full bodied mouth feel is creamy and complex...in a way that compliments the flavors nicely.

A little bit sticky, though. No bitterness to speak of at any stage, nor any hint of the alcohol content. There is seriously no alcohol burn at all.

The alcohol was quite well integrated to begin with but; with warming, it took on a sherry-like warmth and texture. Nice malty impressions, some bitter chocolate, all in all well balanced for a big beer. This beer is probably not for novices, I recall having it for the first time a bit over a year ago and I was a little swept away by it. This time, I appreciated the unravelling of different layers of spice, chocolate, malt and wheat that made it well worth drinking slowly, which I suppose is warranted with the large alcohol presence. I could do with another of these, highly recommended provided you don't rush it along too much.","ThatWineGuy","Nov 28, 2008"

2.22,-48.7,4,2,2,3,2,"This beer was tasted on 11/24/08, a 500ml. bottle out of a Duvel tulip glass. The beer was bottled on the 109th day of 2008. Initial appearance was a beauiful reddish-brown amber colour with a mouth watering 2 finger cream head. Unfortunately the smell and taste did not compare to the look. All I could smell was active yeast which overwhelmed any other flavours the beer might have had. The taste was the same yeast, yeast, and more yeast. I would say at least for me the beer is not very drinkable considering it was the first beer that I have poured in a long time. Not a big fan of German beer styles though, more of a Belgian guy, so I hope this brew will improve with more age. Overall, at this point of bottle ageing was very disappointed by this brew which is listed on BA's top 100 list.","mikeyv35","Nov 25, 2008"
4.45,2.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Aventinus pours with a big bubbly head, justifying the champagne glass-shape of the prescribed glassware. The settled beer is a rich amber-brown with excellent lacing. The smell is just superb. It's a spiced fruit cocktail, cinnamon sticks and nutmeg stewed with pears, apples and ripe bananas. It's close to a spiced mead without the syrupy sweetness. I appreciate the taste more than the related eisbock. The eisbock is great, but the taste of wheat wine tends to drown things out. This beer showcases a range of flavors and is, in my opinion, an extremely easy beer to like. It is a great beer to spring on the wine crowd because there is a lot of fruitiness with a superb wheat backdrop and a touch of the wine-ish qualities of the eisbock. It packs complexity and steadiness into an incredible wheat ale. Schneider must have sold his soul for the recipe to this bit of alchemy. It is a unique flavor of beer, at least to my palate, and a marvelous bit of respite from the unrelenting onslaught of pale ales and stouts. This is one of those few beers that I could drink for the rest of my life and be happy. I love Belgians and gigantic American styles, but the Germans really know how to make a beer that you could drink at any reasonable time, and, even at 8.2%, I wish I had an entire three liter stein of it. You give me three liters of Aventinus and I'm willing to be fairly lax on the issue of the propriety of the glassware. Great, great beer. Thank heaven, it's widely available these days.","popery","Nov 24, 2008"

Overall this was much more Belgian and less dark (lacking malt) than I expected. It was clean and drinkable, but didn't have a flavor that I particularly enjoy.

The smell was all banana and cloves, which seemed to mask the wheat but it was quite a pleasant aroma. The flavor was much like the smell, but without any one flavor being too overwhelming. It's medium-heavy body was smooth and delicious all the way down. Definitely recommended.","jeremyd365","Jul 11, 2008"
4.17,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a cloudy tan-brown color with a light brown/cream colored tall head in a hefe glass. Smells strongly of banana, yeast, and clove... malt is just lightly detected in the smell as the head lowers. Tingly hop and carbonation, nice moderate smooth mouthfeel, bready malt and yeast, creamy, fairly spicy, pepper/clove... slightly medicinal/phenolic, fruit sweetness and banana... this is definitely more reminiscent of a hefeweizen than a doppelbock. Not in-your-face heavy malts, but it does have the "restorative" effect of a doppelbock. Suggested.

I mean to be cellared and cared for a full year to be enjoyed by two fellows in armchairs watching the Nationals being swept by the Reds it was a pleasant experience but I just don't know if it would be good one after another. As we didn't have anymore because we only had the two bottles I couldn't tell you. But for drinkablity I had to give it off for a few points because I think this would make a horrible session beer. For something you want to enjoy while watching the worst team in baseball get pummeled it really takes the edge off. Fantastic to drink but every once in a while.","ghostmech007","Jul 07, 2008"

Nose is all over the place, hugely wheaty, with dried fruit, yeast, a ton of spices, roasted malt, raisins. Flavor is totally similar, and amazing. A ton of mixing flavors and fruit, citrus, prunes, raisins, yeast, wheat, caramel and roasted malt. Man is this a delicious brew. Feel is fairly full bodied and perfect for the style.

4.45,2.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured 500ml bottle into my Duvel glass. Beautiful cloudy brown beer with significant head that left a wonder silk lace. Definately smelled of bananas,clove, vanilla, and "beer goodness". Taste - Wow! I really love, not like, this beer. It was a dessert for me. I really kept turning the bottle hoping more would fall into me glass. Mouth feel - Big foamy head is reminiscent of sweet frothy milk. I could definately drink 2 - 3 500 ml of these, and I don't think I would want another beer after Aventinus in the same night.

A nice fruitiness full of plum and banana open it up, followed by some nice phenols and cloves backed with some nice alcohol, which really works to enhance everything. As it warms the wheat begins to become noticable, as well as what tastes like some very light roast. Throughout the drinking experience the carbonation is lively and wonderful.

The complete lack of noticeable alcohol, combined with that indefinable drinkability that comes only with wheatbeers, makes this a real guzzler.

4.1,-5.3,4,4,4,5,4,"The flavor opens with sweet, honey glazed wheat malt, nice and chocolatey up front. With some years on it, this has become very much like a strong belgian dark. Full bodied, with a dry, powdery feel. All the carbonation is still there. Sherry-like, and very vintage. Lots of dark fruit, though black cherry comes forward most. Aged, dry wheaty sourness in the finish, balancing and wrapping things up neatly. Some of the complexity seems to have dropped out in favor of the typical aged beer flavors. Maybe a little past it's perfect time, but still quite good.","UnionMade","Jun 02, 2008"

4.23,-2.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This is one of the first Weizenbocks I ever tried, and so it has always held a special place for me. Pours a somewhat murky light amber color, darker towards the top, and gets lighter as you go down. A big cloud like poof of head shows itself early, fades a bit, but holds up very well mostly. Smell has some spicy clove, strawberry, prune, wheat, cinnamon and much more I am sure. Taste is extremely juicy, and busting at the seams with fruit flavors, spice and wheat that mirrors some of the smells mentioned above. Body of the beer is medium, and has a certain degree of heat, but not to the point of being offensive. The tastes do a good job of masking the higher ABV. Although many have called this one a sipper, I could gulp this stuff down easily. I will agree that this is one of the best for the style. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 20, 2008"
4,-7.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured a cloudy plum color with a rocky off-white head that took up half the glass. Excellent retention and a fair amount of lacing that adhered to the sidewalls of the glass during the tasting. Scent of dark fruit and bubblegum. A slight medicinal quality, not at all unpleasant, and clove present upfront in the flavor profile. Dark fruit is again revealed somewhere in the middle (seems to be raisins and prunes) followed by a tart and spicy finish. Lots of effervescence with quite a bit of burn throughout the mouth. Alcohol is well hidden, but complexity of flavor limits drinkability to one bottle tops, but quite enjoyable nonetheless.","Jwale73","May 20, 2008"

It's sweet with a malty aroma that has all the character of a big doppel. The flavor lacks the burn of an 11% example of the style and the wheate gives it a very "drinkable" profile.

On the palate, the chocolate becomes more evident along with dark fruits, raisins, a little vanilla, some cinnamon in the finish, ginger, along with an astringency.

Very malty and sweet for sure, but what it is that makes it so amazing, I do not know. Is there some black cherry in there? Maybe some toffee..Moderate to high carbination. Hops help to balance with a bit of bitterness but no noticable hop flavor, which doesn't take away from it at all. You would guess it had an above average abv based on the thickness alone, but its so tasty that it doesn't take away from the drinkability.

Smell initially is of alcohol and some fruit but I cant put my finger on what. Grape? Cherry? Something, just cant distinguish. Taste is very good. Again, alcohol is present (almost a little too much) however there is a slightly sweet chocolate taste, its very subtle, but there. Overall good balance and leaves a bread/grainy aftertaste as with many wheat beers. Moderate carbonation leaves more of a crisp feel to the drink which I felt was enjoyable.

Smell is classic and very aromatic with lots of "banana nut bread" hints of spice and fruit from yeast not exactly fermentation temps? Hops are not very present in the aroma, the yeast backed by malt are really the showcase of this beer. Flavor is very rich and malt forward hops are are not very present in the flavor other than a contribution of bitterness. Yeast has played quit a large role in shaping the taste of this beer which is very nice. As mentioned in the smell clover banana nut bread with a touch of sourness toward the finish.

This would easily be one of my "five desert island" brews. I used to enjoy many other German-style hefeweizens, but Aventinus has killed my enjoyment of most other "regular" hefes. I've had the Aventinus Eisbock on several occasions as well, but I enjoy this version the most. This has an incredible mixture of the classic German wheat beer flavors, while condensing them, yet not over-doing them. The spicy, clovey phenolics are in perfect harmony here.

Just from the 16.9 oz. bottle it felt like I had to do a Guinness pour just to get the whole damn bottle in the glass. Good off the bat. The smell has a whisk of alcohol to it already and this is dead "bock" cold, and it shows in the taste right after the immediate sip is taken. Has alot of character to it underneath though, its just the alcohol masks it fairly heavily unfortunately... ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WHEAT INFLUENCE!!! The mouthfeel is quite good, and makes for an interesting mix of wheat ale character and bock sweetness. A very interesting beer, however not my style. Well...not yet at least. I recommend it as something every BA should try.","MusicmanSD","Apr 12, 2007"

The taste is huge on banana & the spicy clove character as well and the finish is dry and slightly citrusy - a perfect dessert beer. This is a well carbonated beer, but a little more creaminess and this would be better off.

Cloves (lots of long-lasting cloves) and cinnamon-sugar toast are the really nice flavors in the finish. To me, that palate-smacking tannic finish detracts from the drinkability just a bit--it's just very very, dry. I can easily believe that this is a perfect example of this style.

The taste is complex and multilayered with deep wheaty malts and bready notes followed by sharp spicy phenols with significant tart character. The mouthfeel is warming from the alcohol to be sure and very carbonated and crisp, almost sharp. The finish is long and not solventy, but a bit hot.

A spicy, cinnamon aroma, along with a peculiar sweetness I associate with canned corn dominate the nose and taste. The relatively high alcohol content also contributes to the flavor; I definitely welcomed those esters for adding an additional dimension to the otherwise clobbering maltyness. To that end, I found that a few bites of dark chocolate brought out a crispness that I might have otherwise overlooked.

Upon pouring there was a nice firm tan head, and a murky, turbid, brown body that reminded me of swamp water...unreal. Then poof, the heads gone, not a trace, not even a whisper of head or lace for much of the drink. Aromas were thick with a yeasty, fruity, clovelike smell, that was very hard to decern. The taste also, was very complex wtih fruit and floral flavors and a hint of bitterness upfront and fading alcohol on the back end.

Coming through the palate is Yeast, breadiness, coriander, honeydew, some cherries, a little anise, bananas, and an unbelievable clove finish with some alcohol warmth. Extremely complex brew here and ridiculously YUMMY. One of the better tasting beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, velvety, and moderate-high carbonation.

The best way to describe the flavor of this beer is chocolate drizzled and lightly clove spiced banana bread. Tastes like a pumped up dunkelweizen all around. Just a hint of alcohol. Additional flavors of raisins, dates, and other dried fruits. There is also a very bright tart and sweet combination in the finish that prevents this from becoming to tiring on the palate. Mouthfeel is of sturdy body with pleasant viscosity combined with lively bubbles. With excelent body and flavor makes this a great drinker.","goochpunch","Aug 25, 2006"

The bubblegum flavor is present, not quite a hefe weissen taste, its labeled as a Wheat DoppleBock and thats really what it tastes like a wheat beer crossed with a dopplebock.

Weak noble hops in the aftertaste, semi-dry with a hint of cocoa. Medium carbonation and medium full body, lots of texture from wheat and yeast but also crisp.

High level of carbonation with very tiny bubbles gracing the surface; seemed like I was dreaming. An incredible number of aromas seemed to come out including honey, grains, earth, sweet fruit, and alcohol. The taste was dominated by that of dark fruit and wheat. Subtle earth (mud) and smoked flavors added character and depth. The texture was slightly chewy with a medium-finish that seemed to involve figs and dates.

I guess it would be a caramelized malt, but it does not have nearly the impact that color would make me guess it would have. The other thing is that the alcohol is extremely well masked.

As an interesting experiment, I recommend trying this (especially alongside a bottle of regular Aventinus), but I, personally, can't imagine drinking this vintage beer without pairing it with very specific food items (the most sugary roasted sweet meats, some desserts).

That lessens my overall scoring in the smell and taste category, as well as this one.

There are tons of carbonation streams charging to the top through a beautiful burnt amber, copper-highlighted liquid. Smells fruity and rich with cloves, bananas, and raisins. Distinctly wheat. The first taste is initially bracing with alcohol, but this immediately disappears and the rich malty sweetness with the cloves and bananas appear. There are lingering alcohol notes which are warming. Medium bodied with vibrant carbonation. Slightly slick, but relatively light on the tongue. Absolutely drinkable, perhaps dangerously so. This was fantastic and worth tracking down.","hopsaplenty","Jan 04, 2006"

The Aventinus has a certain lightly spiced caramel apple fruitiness to it, (which surfaces in the aroma, too) that is rather tasty, and hides the alcohol content of this brew pretty well. I seem to remember the spiciness being more assertive, but perhaps my palate has changed, and not the beer. I found lots of yeast in the bottle and I tried to rouse it so it would fall into my glass to add more flavor. I did appreciate the soft mouthfeel of this beer and it's surprising drinkability, but for all the hype I think it could be a bit more complex.

Taste began with an astringent taste that dissolved into a citrus flavor. I have had some problems with strong astringent tastes (like Konig Ludwig Hefe Weizen). This beer is so nicely balanced that it just shows you an astringent taste and quickly dissolves to at citrus taste and a rich mouthfeel.

There are so many delicious flavors in this beer, and they work so well together. The sweet and sour flavor lets you know this is a weizenbock, but I think of this as a great beer that just happens to be a weizenbock. Mouthfeel is creamy.

4.62,6.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Aventinus is one of those beers I have always consumed and almost take for granted. Recently I ordered a batch from my local store though--it had been a while and I felt like rediscovering it. In its absence I found a new appreciation for this phenomenal beer. Just seeing the attractive purple-labelled bottle is enough to make me salivate. I want it at my local store for good, because this is truly a world class German beer. It always pours into my weizen glass nicely, if done slowly and carefully. The head can be as enormous as you see fit. Ultra-creamy, off-white bubbles form and give off the wonderful aroma very intensely after pouring. Sheets of lace cover the sides, sticking tenaciously, or sometimes running down the glass. The beer is full of colour: purples and burgundy, caramel or murky brown, ruby, maple and amber. Always impermeable too: the beer looks thick and hazy. The beer's appearance literally induces drinking. The first big, chunky aroma from this beast is the banana. Fresh, strong, almost rotten banana smells. Dried banana. The intense banana is not artificial smelling at all, as some unfiltered wheat beers smell as though they have had banana extract dumped into them. This is refreshing, natural and extremely appetising. Behind the fruitiness is the strong sweet maltiness with a little of the warming, port-like alcohol. The yeastiness is delicious, reminding me of the very first German hefeweizens I ever tried. Dates, prunes, light licorice, plums, and red wine. The malts add some saltiness, some meatiness. This is one beer very easy to over-sniff: the aroma is massively complex, yet very powerful. Sometimes you can smell it too much and it numbs your nose for a few minutes. The aroma is intense and can be overpowering, but only if you let it. The aroma is like a very good hefeweizen, with the addition of more alcohol and more maltiness, which begs the question: Why are there not more weizenbocks in this world? Again, I could go on and on about the smells in this beer's aroma, but we must move on to the taste. The taste could inevitably be compared to rich red wine. There literally is a very strong red grape taste in the beer. Even the tannic dryness is present. The finish clearly evinces that this is a beer though--strong banana yeastiness, perfumy hops and rich malting. The alcohol does come through quite strongly in the middle, but it is never overpowering--instead it reminds me of the taste one might get from warm brandy. Delectable dark fruits and mouth-filling maltiness. There are enough strong tastes here to deter the second sip of a beer-neophyte, but once this beer hacks its way to your beer-heart, this is at once both one of the most refreshing and complex strong beers you could ingest. Think the revitalising characteristics of a cold hefe with the arcane complexity of an aged barleywine. The carbonation on this beer is medium, the mouthfeel definitely full. A beer equally satisfying on a cold night or a warm one. I have tried Aventinus with a variety of different cheeses, and they all complement it very well. Try aged cheddar or gorgonzola--they were particularly good with this beer. This is one of those beers that truly does make Germany the preeminent beer producer; and it is one of those beers that we should feel privileged to experience every time we take a sip.","Cwrw","Nov 03, 2005"
4.35,0.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Typically not my style of beer BUT, I'm really starting to like Weizenbocks. Super easy to drink, alcohol well hidden. Malty and sweet.

Smell is rich and full of banana bread, clove and loads of yeast spice--malty and sweet. Taste upfront is deep caramelized banana wheatiness. The hefe characteristic is magnified to epic proportions. Very round flavor. Then there's a slow progression into a warming clove finish. Hops are nominally present for bittering only. Delicious. Delicious banana burps. Mouthfeel is low medium but the carbonation is strong, working to create a very creamy mouthfeel, not unlike some belgian strong ales.

Aromas are that of a light barleywine with bubblegum (juicy fruit) and esters (banannas and cloves). The flavors are intensely similar. Bigger and bolder sweetness than expected in wheat beers but complex and bold nonetheless. More akin to and Urbock. So is the body, texture, and mouthfeel.

It was orginally a workers residential area but was quickly gentrified and filled with villas, baths, and temples (the most famous being the one devoted to Diana, the godess of nature).In the middle ages the hill was apppropriated by monastic establishments, and they are still there. Enough of that. It's a beer review. Aventinus the Beer rules the Weizenstarkbiers. The foam, the sweet smell, the distinct taste of wheat and hops.

I had this with the intention of a pre-nightcapper but I could see this as an after dinner brew to seal the deal. Something strong enough to compete with the dinner yet rich and easy drinking not to bloat or disturb. mouthfeel was awesome creamy, some oils, carbonation makes its point then fades quickly like alot of german brews.

I rarely drink wheat beers in general unless they have a ton of funk from the Senne Valley. This is the only other wheat beer that I will drink on a regular basis because of the simple fact that it is incredibly tasty.

The flavors of Schneider's Original Weisse are all here: whole wheat, banana bread, lots of yeast.. except they are all magnified threefold. Plenty of the caramelly doppelbock character, and a very smooth mouthfeel. A bit of alcoholic zing is there, but nothing suggesting the 8% abv. Of course, you'll notice the 8% by the time you're finished with the bottle, but what the hey. Aventinus is a world-class, luxurious beer from one of my absolute favorite breweries.

The result is quite yummy. Pours light brown in color with a haze. Smell is of bananas and yeast. Taste is heavenly. Bananas, lemon juice, minimal cloves. I wish I had a new one to compare against. Perhaps this is worth another trip back to the store! $5.49 for 500ml bottle. If you see it, it is worth it. Label says hints of softer chocolate, clay, and sherry when aged.

Before the yeast it is brown with a reddish tint and after it is close to maroon and opaque. Lots of phenols. Bananas, cloves, pepper, lemons, chocolate, alcohol, yeast, and sweet sugary notes in the aroma. It has a medium body, a carbonation that is a bit sharp at the beginning, and leaves a warming sensation. Flavors include bananas, cloves, pepper, grass, caramel, bubblegum, chocolate, raisins, plums?, a sugary sweetness, alcohol, and yeast.

Interesting flavors, not too strong, yet in no way is it mild.... Nice and malty, just slightly dark. There is a hit of sasafrass and a lot of nice clove in the finish, even a bit of a clove tingle on the tongue -I like that and have always loved the taste of clove.

Head is relatively resilient, and lacing is minimal, both of which are acceptable to me with an aged product. Aroma is of caramel malts, with light tinges of dark fruits and hops character. Taste is initially of biscuity malt, fading into the minimal fruit and hops notes as hinted in the nose. No hint of relatively high alcohol content here. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and drinkability excellent as well. Worth searching for.","ppoitras","Dec 13, 2004"

Aroma of ripe fruits dipped in caramel and molasess dominate with smells of light spice and toasted malt also but in backgroud. Taste is sweet fruit to start aided by some caronation. Then the toasted malt makes a brief apperance followed by light bitterness and spiceness that begins after your swallow is resting safely in your tummy. Mouthfeel is right side of medium its chewy and full tasting, but not a heavy beer goes down easy and smooth finished before done typing.

This is, without a doubt, my favorite current beer. It pours with a huge head and leaves a nice lace while drinking it in my awesome Aventinus glass. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 on appearance is that I compare everything against beers like Westy or Rochefort or the like. The bubbles seemed to be a little large and the lacing wasn't top notch as some beers I have had. The scent is heavenly. Smells of so many different things. Cloves, spices, anise, chocolate, bananas, toffee, port like wine. So many different scents to amaze your nose. Taste is just as good. Mostly I taste the cloves, spices and bananas. Perfect carbonation for this style beer which makes it very smooth going down. The high alcohol content is the only reason it doesn't get a 5 on drinkability. Two of these is plenty for me before it ends being as enjoyable. A really good afterdinner drink if you don't wan't something super sweet like a port, barleywine or eisbock. Can't say enough good things about this beer. Even the price is good. About $3.29 at my local bevmo for a 16.9 oz bottle. I always have at least 4-6 or these on hand at all times.

Dark fruits, malts, bit of spice and banana, so chocolate creeping in. Has a surprisely light mouthfeel, which was unusual yet appreciated and the high ABV is so well hidden it is quaffable (although you'll want most of it to land in your mouth so it is not a true quaff).

3.07,-29.1,4.5,2.5,3,4,3,"Pouring this, I was rewarded with an initial 1.75 inch, hi density off-white foamy head and the color of the beer is a burnt caramel. The carbonation is at the initial pour, almost champagne like in intensity, with bubbles ascending from all sectors of the glasses interior. The nose offers copious quantities of clove and fennel which somewhat dissipates revealing the yeast and a hint of dark chocolate. The initial mouth feel is quite creamy, as a portion of the head exists throughout the tasting. The finish is quite crisp, due to the persistent carbonation. For me, the clove-like underpinnings remind me somewhat of a "seasonal" holiday flavored brew, and somewhat detract from the overall drinkability of this beer. The combined expansive nature of the style, and the prominent clove / fennel like flavor deeply embedded in this beer is a bit "over the top" as I began to get subtle indications that having gone onto a second bottle might have encouraged my gag reflex into operation. It is the nose of this product that has an enormous weight on how this beer will be generally perceived, evaluated and ultimately enjoyed. The taste is moderately potable, but there is no escaping the outgassing of odoriferous emanations. Although interesting to try, it is doubtful that this beer will find a place in my cellar now or in the future.","barknee","Oct 17, 2004"

If you ever put a dark stout up to the light and saw the bit of red that comes through, then you'd recognize it, because it's very close to that aura of colour. Creamy, two finger head. Though their isn't much lace, the glass was recently washed before I poured this beer. So that may affect the lace. Ripe, juicy dark fruit smell, bit of caramel, sweet malts of wheat and barley, and even a slight cheese smell from the yeast. Bit off, yet still pleasant. Tastes damn good. More ripe fruits, with plums and cherries dominant, sweet malt followthrough all up to the aftertaste, which is similar to a dark bread. Creamy, thick mouthfeel coats your teeth, gums, cheeks, tongue and throat. Nice, very nice. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking this again, and again, and again...

The taste starts of with slightly sweet fruits and a good amount of carbonation as well. There was a good malt flavor over the middle before a slight bit of hops and wheat come in at the end.

4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The reddish orange to burnt amber looking body surprised me with its initial clarity and the lack of cloudiness. The second pour however had a large number of floating clumps of the little friends. The initial head was an inch and a half in height with a fizzy carbonation. The head did not last very long at all, and there was no lacing to speak of. The smell was perfumey to medicinal alcohol with underlying banana, clove, and ripe cherries. The taste was initially quite sweet with lots of fruity esters and spices typical for a German wheat beer. The alcohol appears to be very well hidden at first, but as the beer warms up, it starts to step in front of other flavors and introduces a lot of dryness in the mix. Towards the end of the glass, the hops make a surprisingly strong appearance. There is a faint smokiness to the malt that is like a wispy ghost. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I had hoped for, and the yeast adds a mildly unpleasant metallic twang. Very complex beer that starts out easy, and then changes its tune a couple of times as it has your attention.","rajendra82","Apr 26, 2004"

The locals at the table tried their hand at English with us, giving us the warning that this beer was not for amateurs. Taking a sniff, you could tell this beer was in the 8% range. Pretty alcohol smelling. As I took the first sip, my worries of it tasting like pure alcohol were put to ease. While there was a bit of an alcohol taste, there was plenty of malt here to balance that out. A bit of a clove taste followed it as well. It was a lot crisper than I was expecting.

With temperature that tanginess tames to the point where some banana shows. Sweet fruit in the middle with some cream. The creaminess builds as the beer warms, turning almost milk-chocolatey. Tangy again in the finish; toffee, some bread, lots of spice. Some alcohol in the aftertaste. This beer really needs to warm up to bloom. When cold, the tangy fruit is almost overwhelming. With temperature, the fruit softens considerable and the thick, malty, creamy, chocolatey malt starts to shine through. Stunningly good when warm.

Aromas are all over the place: fruits by the truckload, with ripe banannas and granny smith apples leading the way. A spicy, almost peppery zip as well. I didn't note the chocolate that others have smelled. Flavor is complex. Large dose of grain-like flavor initially, followed by a quick burst of sweetness, then ends with a strange mix of peppery bitterness. Almost an acidic-dry finish. Warming effect from the alcohol becomes more prominent at the very end. Decent body and carbonation. Drinkability is good as well.

I first had this beer at the Silver Swan in New York City while eating wild boar and venison. It is a great beer to accompany a heavy meal. It is a great dark weisse and right after you open the bottle you can smell the distant smells of banana and cloves. Once you taste this beer you will be astounded by the flavor. It is 8% alcohol but goes down smooth and if you aren't careful, after a few you will definitely feel it.

Sweet dark fruity malt up front followed by clove and some yeast notes. A touch of citric hop comes in towards the finish.

Still a little sweeter than I would ideally prefer. I expected the mouthfeel, while hardly classifiable as thin, to be slighty fuller. This is a wonderful beer.

4.62,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"2000 Vintage, caved aged for 36 months in Aventinus' ice cave in Germany. The appearance is very similar, if not the same as regular Aventinus. A dark, yeasty, murky brown colour with a humungous tan/beige head of foam. If swirled or allowed to garner up a big head, the aromas of this are also very similar to the regular Aventinus. I smell cloves, various fruits and esters, slight spicy alcohol, a bit of malt, and very, very slight floral hops. The aromas are actually a bit more well integrated than the aromas of the regular Aventinus, but at the same time, they are also less pronounces/pungent and complex. The taste is more subdued than that wild-fresh Aventinus, but all of the same major flavor hints are still there. Slight bitter-sweet chocolate, dark fruits, german yeast, malt and hops, alcoholic spiciness, and spicy clove hints. The mouthfeel is a bit creamier and more smooth in the mouth than fresh Aventinus and the drinkability is excellent for an 8.0%ABV wheat beer. Please remember to serve this cool, not cold at cellar temperature, because this is were Aventinus is at it's best. Since these 99 and 2000 reserve bottles have been aged in an ice cave for 36 months, they should be served straight from you ice cave (ie: cellar) or brought up to cellar temp, by sitting in the fridge for 30-40 minutes.","francisweizen","Dec 17, 2003"

The beer itself is well-carbonated, though, with plenty of streamers rising through a light-chestnut colored brew with highlights that border on amber. Immediately weizeny aroma up front, with the distinctive refreshing, near-citrus tartness; there follows a banana-bread mealiness in the middle; with toffee malt rounding out the back. Flavor is of clove and slight cinnamon; sour-wheaty with suggestions of bubblegum and melon in the midpalate with spicy clove; highlights of raisin and white grapes. And oh yeah, a lot more clove--so much that it almost borders on black pepper. If you don't like clove, then forget it. Mouthfeel is spicily dry, effervescent, champagney with more peppery tingle; yet somehow quenching in the back of the throat. This combination of spiciness and quenching character infers a high drinkability. I could drink this in session if I wasn't feeling the alcohol already...

Fades slowly to a heavy skim always present but very little lace sticking, most drips back in. Aroma is citrusy and spicy with mild lemon and orange zest mostly coming through, lighter wheat and malty sweetness, musty yeast, and clove spices engaged within. Taste is a total brigade derived from the smell, pretty sharp toned up front with a strong wheaty carbonation that grabs hold right away and sticks with ya the whole ride through. Middle strikes with a yeasty take and citrus zest of lemon and orange, carbonation finally settles out and leaves prickly notions of malted sweetness with some dark fruityness of banana and starfruit tangyness and spice that lingers with a light chewyness that smoothes it out some but that carbonation really stands out and adheres to your mouth. Quite a ride in the feel dept., lots of hold and carbonation that creates lots of those little burps at first but as it warms it mellows and becomes more gratifying.

I have to admit I prefer it on tap over bottled (though Aventinus Wheat is still one of my favorites in the bottle.) The color (deep brown) and flavor (fruity with a bit of cloves) are still excellent. I think the tap controls the carbonation better, cutting the head down, making it a bit heavier and giving it an even smoother mouthfeel and drinkability than the bottle. Feels a bit more like a 8.0 ABV beer on tap, and it will catch up to you after the second 16oz one, believe me.","PopeJonPaul","Nov 08, 2003"
4.5,3.9,4.5,4.5,5,3.5,4,"Cloudy deep red to brown color. Very fruity smelling, notes of ripe plum, a bit of banana, and some definite clove in the aroma. Well carbonated, pours with a rousing head. Tastes sharp from the carbonation. There is some definite banana flavor in the finish. This beer is lightly sweet, has a light bit of astringency in the finish. the dark malt adds a richness to this beer, in combination with the yeast, it gives the beer dark fruit type flavors. This is like a richer, more chewy, fruitier older brother of a great Hefe-Weizen. All of the characteristics are here, just more so. My only complaint is that I wish it had finished with a slightly higher final gravity, a little more thickness & sweetness would have been ideal.","Gueuzedude","Oct 26, 2003"

The liquid has a creamy brown color to it. The alcohol aroma carrys over into the taste, and ends up as a warm feeling in you belly. The taste is just a little bit sweet, with maybe a little caramelized banana in there. Strong, but smooth beer, maybe more of a fall beer than a summer one.","HappyHourHero","Oct 25, 2003"

When held up to the light the redness can really be shown, but in a medium lit room it is a very nice, not quite black amber. The most distinguishable characteristic of this beer is banana. It is overall fruity and quite sweet, but the banana overshadows all. Other flavors present are chocolate, cola nut, and apple. there is not initial hit to the pallete, rather the malt steadily accumulates, first with banana flavor, then trailing with the others. As it warms up the flavor changes noticably, becoming even sweeter and more balanced amongst the flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit more carbnated than most other dopplebocks, and I like it. Perhaps I'm partial to my celebrator, but this beer makes a great substitute for dopplebock when you need some variety.","gnaussea","Oct 14, 2003"

The nose is full of life with , caramel, bananas, cloves and even a almost light tobacco. The taste is the nose times three.. All of the sences are hit with the fruity, spicy, and almost cola like sensations. The carbonation just lifts these onto the palate and makes the tongue dance with joy.. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation keeps this from being to heavy.. This would be a great beer to through back if not for the fact that 3 or more will leave you hurting due to its ABV, which is not even noticable. An all time favourite.

The taste is also packed with malt and cloves, and also contains some fruity esters. There is a bit of yeast to the finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and super smooth.

Rich tastes of dough up front with sweet dark fruits in the middle smoothed by a banana flavor from the yeast and some cloves and a warming alcohol sensation on the finish. This beer is 8% abv?!

There is a definite carbonic bite in this one that somewhat detracts from the flavor. Very smooth clean finish with a hint of alcohol and a lot of clove and spicey esters.

But that soon fades away, leaving me to deal with the matter at hand. The nose is quite nice, never noticed it much before now, rather inviting. Spicy and rummy, hints of preserved fruit, like the jarred cherries my Baba used to make. Quite intense. Flavour is very similar. It's something I've yet to find the words for. Wet IKEA throw-rug is not it though, I stand corrected. Like spiced buttered rum mixed with fruit, and then that elusive special ingredient (oh yeah, banana, that's it!). Yeah, this is pretty good stuff. Not the cat's ass like everyone else makes it out to be, but not as bad as I first took it to be either.

The fruitiness is faint, while the waves of flavor attack with cheerful willingness, over and over again. A warmth from the alcohol is present throughout the experience with some noticeable heat on the palate. In addition, a near perfect bitterness keeps the beer in check. This is cool stuff, but after one I'm done for a while-kinda like cheese fries. The low drinkability reflects my personal idea of drinkability, which perhaps reflects the season In which I have sampled a particular beer.

A great roasted taste is combined with a fruity, bready, yeasty component, all well balanced. A touch of bitterness is in the finish, along with the characteristic wheat crispness. The aftertaste brings to mind chocolate covered bananas, with just a hint of cloves. The mouthful is creamy, feeling sinful on the tongue. I think I could drink these all day long! I bought this particular bottle in November to celebrate a pending job (so I thought). I cracked it open tonight to celebrate a different job that was just finalized.

Initial taste was of sweet fruit, followed by a bit of hop bitterness, then the alcohol, and if that wasnt enough there was a spicy zing of cloves at the finish. The only mouthfeel complaint that I have is that there was a bit too much carbonation, it think it distracted me a little from tasting all the flavors that that this beer contained.

4.78,10.4,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"A remarkable looking beer, this one poured into an official Aventinus wheat glass, with a very full head. Not only was the head nice and full, but as the beer sat the head expanded. It didn't bubble down to a thin layer, but it started to expand until it rose above the rim of the glass. I watched the beer for at least two minutes before I even took my first sip, it was just amazing how long the head was lasting, unlike any beer I have ever seen. The dark brown amber body complemented the creamy brown tone of the head so well. The sweetness in the aroma carrie wheat barley along the alcohol. The nose was like a sweet fig brandy with raisins to complement the complex full aroma. The yeast character from the banana esters were also detectable with in the scent of the beer. The lace formed perfectly and full as I sipped on this huge beer. It is so full bodied with a creamy thick and chewy mouthfeel, that this beer is a meal by itself. The same yeast flavors of the banana and clove is here with buttery notes of apples and raisins. A wonderful aftertaste full of malty goodness laced with alcohol on the tongue. I would love to enjoy this beer regularly, but too many of these put down could equal quite a mess with the high alcohol and full body these are meant to be enjoyed one at a time. I wish I could put more of these away, because it is amazing in every way.","WVbeergeek","Feb 17, 2003"

4.7,8.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This was one of my two lunch beers today, and it's a classic that I've enjoyed many times -- this time in a bottle. Deep copper brown color -- like mahogany furniture or something, really. Head dissipates a bit faster than most wheat beers, but the aroma is strong. Raisinets and wheaty lemon zest. Tastes great as well. Someone put their Christmas gift basket of fruits and bittersweet chocolates in this beer. Wheat finish with a stronger malt presence up front. Overall a nice combination of flavors. Great beer. The vintage 1996 and 1999 are, to my recollection, even an improvement upon this.","marburg","Feb 07, 2003"

Aroma is strong on the banana, with some clove sneaking in, too. Flavor is also strong on the banana, with some slight hints of chocolate, and ending with some clove and spiceyness. In the mouth, it has some tingly carbonation, and a tiny hint of alcohol as it gets warmer.","goz","Feb 04, 2003"

The carbonation is fine with great mouthfeel and this is an altogether extremely pleasing brew.","doho95fu","Feb 01, 2003"

Nose is wonderful overripe banana, clove, and nutmeg with a touch of light caramel. Leaves me almost drooling to take a sip. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is quite fruity with notes of sweet malts, spicy clove, molasses, and a mild alcohol bite that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. A truly wonderful beer. Perhaps the finest Weizenbock Ive ever sampled.","Morris729","Jan 20, 2003"

Well, here's a great combination of the two. Refreshing, easy to drink, and plenty powerful! Pours large head (as to be expected), dark and creamy. The alcohol makes itself noticed, and the clovey-spiciness is prominent (along with the taste of banana). Overall, one of the absolute great beers.

I have tried it several times now, and I find it no better than drinkable. Way too fruity for my tastes, but it does improve as you go. Strong bannana and a bit of clove and raisin. A complex beer, if you enjoy the style you will likely find this a rewarding taste. I try to rate with the style in mind, otherwise this beer would have a very low rating from me. Its not the beer's fault I think the style tastes like ^%#@.","Sixpack595","Jan 13, 2003"

Pours out to a plum darkness in the glass with a light brown head that reminds you of brown sugar. The aroma is that of fruit. The taste. Man, the taste. Where to begin? Initially, there is a presence of nutmeg, cloves and banana, much like a regular wheat beer. But just when you think this is what you get, the beer transforms as it warms and the clove/banana taste leaves and a warm fruit taste of raisins takes over. A wonderful beer that truly hides the 8% ABV very well.","proc","Jan 13, 2003"

On tap this stuff has no business going down as easy as it does with an 8% abv and tons of taste. Cloudy orangish/brown with a nice head that dies quick..but who cares? This beer still tastes great down to the last sip! A welcome fruity taste but not overbearing by any means. Definitely bananas detected, some other slight tropical type fruit tastes. Has a slight alcohol bite to let you know what you're getting into, but really adds to the overall taste. Two twenty oz. glasses and you're feeling grand, but could easily drink many more.

Strong yeast character in the nose, a bit sour, almost like vinegar.  Fruity and malty undertones are also noticeable.  As it journeys to your palate, you find a very spicy dried fruit character with an underlying chocolate maltiness, and then a unique spicy finish, which the bottle describes as "clove-like".  A smooth, yet exciting mouthfeel from the carbonation and spiciness.  This reminds me of a Belgian tripel in many ways.  This is excellent!

The combination of banana esters, toasty munich malt, subtle chocolately notes and dark caramel is reminescent of a banana split topped with chocolate syrup and roasted pine nuts.  The overall flavor is incredibly smooth, sweet and is comprised of a fine melange of wheat tartness and residual and caramel malt sweetness... The fruitiness from the yeast adds complexity yet doesn't detract from the mellow chocolate notes.  Full in body and quite rich, but there is nothing cloying overall at all in this fine brew.  Flavorwise, this brew truly exhibits a fine balance between the rich, melanoidin qualities of a doppelbock and the lighter yet complex fruity notes of a German wheat.  The finish is sweet, a bit tart, but an enjoyable dark Munich malt toastiness lingers.  Smooth, satisifying, alcohol warmth coats the throat several seconds after the sip is done.

4.88,12.7,5,4.5,5,5,5,"The pinnacle of wheat beers. This classic became a favorite of mine since my first sip over a year ago and still is. Head froths up even with a gentle pour and is hard to contain in the glass. Delicate brownish color and hints of banana fruitiness in the nose. Banana-clove, chocolate, caramel, and alcohol flavors all mingle together and is offset with just the right amounts of hops to subdue the sweetness of the malt. Has a creamy mouthfeel from the yeast and is much easier to drink than the 8% abv suggests. IMO, the world's greatest beer.","Longstaff","Jun 17, 2002"
4.97,14.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Looks like a pilsener shaped tootsie roll with a bone white beard in the glass. A cream puff doused in a pear and brandy sauce might smell something like Aventinus. Still a hefeweiss, but a hefeweiss with a serious malt base. The malt is kept in check with bittering hops while the typical hefe lip-smacking tartness asserts itself by stepping all over spicy clove toes. A myriad of flavors compound to make this one outstanding brew. If you like hefeweissbiers, than I beseech you, try an Aventinus.","inebrius","May 23, 2002"
3.72,-14.1,4,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Weiss Doppelbock:  Good looking, nice smelling, but man that Weiss/yeast flavor is over the top. It was just too much for me, as I’m not a huge fan of the style, but if you are, this is the one to go to.  It is the Weiss beer on steroids.","jackndan","May 18, 2002"
4.87,12.5,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Man oh man, what a treat. First off, I love the look: deep caramel, almost brown with an orange tinge, and yeasty cloudiness. Nice, foamy off-white head that dissipates a bit quickly. The smell is unique, not quite a weisse, and not quite a doppel. I swear it smells like a cross between a weisse, a doppel, and, of all things, a Belgian dubbel. Huge fruity flavors, banana and raisins and tropical fruits, with the traditional wheaty clove finish. Quite a bit more tang than a doppel bock! Carbonation is also reminiscent of a Belgian more so than a traditional weisse or doppel due to the bottle fermentation. Despite the 8% abv, I find this to be incredibly drinkable, and not just in cooler temps, either!","mophie","May 12, 2002"
4.48,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"A chill-hazed amber-orange appearance with carbonation evident.  Very nice clove and nutmeg on the nose.  Tangy wheat malt aroma also present.  What strikes me on first tasting are 2 things:  One, this is a very easy drinking beer foe 8% a/v.  Two, this isn't overly sweet like I was expecting.  On the buds, you get some of your typical weizen characteristics:  Phenol, Clove, Vanilla and Banana.  The phenolic character is really kept in check nicely.  Must be some nice hopping in this brew to keep what could be a very sweet beer (and style) from becoming too sweet.  Was surprised I never tasted the alcohol in this one.  Great brew.","Bighuge","Apr 24, 2002"
4.37,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Dark caramel color, medium bubbled thick head that is charged from bottle fermentation.  Slightly marmalade and malty aroma.  Nice smell...Deep maple, raisins, and spice flavors, fades just about perfectly.  Just a touch of wheat acidity.  Nice medium body that's not at all sticky.  Finishes as diminished spicy and raisiny, not cloying, adding to drinkability.  Dang fine brew here.","ADR","Apr 19, 2002"
4.85,12,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"amazing.  pours out an off brown, and after you work up the yeast, it turns a more milky dark tan.  the nose is unbelievable...ripe fruit, ripe bananas, clove, some caramel and chocolate malt.  an intoxicating wine like aroma to adds to the sensory overload.  taste is of caramel apples, with prune, plum, banana and clove on top of  a slick, buttery mouthfeel. the addition of all the yeast really expands the taste.  some light spicy hops to add an ending crispness.   you have reached german beer nirvana.  the best of both worlds in a bock and wheat.  a perfect selection for the first warm days of spring.   outstanding.","budgood1","Apr 13, 2002"
4.66,7.6,5,4,5,5,4.5,"This beer really impressed me. Dark amber brown with a big white foamy head. Thick rich taste and feel for a wheat. Heavy yeast flavor, almost chewy, but delicious. Hints of roasted malt and nutty as well. Is there brown sugar in this ? It tasted great. 8% ABV warms you quickly, but easy to drink. 1/2 hour after drinking, I was wishing for more. I only had one bottle, comes in a basic brown bottle with a purple label. A beer worthy of a national championship game or a holiday meal !","StevieW","Apr 06, 2002"
4.97,14.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Reminds me a lot of the Hacker Pschorr Weiss Dark that is my favorite summer brew....Really charged up on the pour..bubbly head settles down quickly....The aroma is what I would expect of a dark wheat...banana, cloves...citrus..brown and cloudy in color, this is one tasty beverage...sweet and fruity...plums..banana's...oranges...covered in brown sugar...an excellent beer.  One of the finest I have tasted for this style.","ZAP","Apr 05, 2002"

3.57,-17.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Thick head with lacy bubbles on a hazy caramel colored beer. Strong straw-like yeasty smell, laced with plums, banana, and rum-alcohol. Thick and syrupy on the palate, with a strong earth yeast character, rich sugary plum, and heavy alcohol. Almost no bitterness of hops. Thick on the mouth, with a near perfect carbonation. All in all, perhaps a little sweet for me, a very very good beer, but a tad sweet.","hooligan","Mar 01, 2002"
4.87,12.5,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Every time I have this I wonder why I don't stock it more often.  Simply a world classic.  Take all the properties of your favorite dunkel and combine them with your favorite bock and you'll get close to Aventinus.","pbrian","Feb 19, 2002"

4.47,3.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Are there any others like it? Banana, clove, bubble gum -- all the classic weisse flavors -- plus caramel and a strong alcohol kick. Very effervescent. This is the original weizenbock and it's still the champ. At least, I think it is -- what's with Schneider's relabeling of all their beers with the Tap numbers? Regardless, I love it.","BKotch","Oct 03, 2001"
4.27,-1.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: A massive wheat brew that is unsurpassed by any other of its kind. Unpasteurized, unfiltered, top fermented and original bottle fermentation. The yeast in this brew, make the brew. After pouring, there was enough yeast to begin propagation. This is by far one of the best bock beers tasted to date.","BeerAdvocate","Feb 24, 2001"
