"Bottle. Pours brown and seemingly hazy. Small pour so I have no idea how it looks at its best. Concentrated Hefe yeast aroma. Banana and the like. Also dark malt smells. Flavor is wackier than the nose. Very faint hints of sourness which clearly is unintended. Unripe banana, caramel, wheat, plum, brown sugar. Booze is not something that come into my thoughts while sipping this beer. Soft bubbles. Creamy. I didn't enjoy this."
"750 ml bottle.  Pours dark amber with white head.  Aroma is of funky yeast, piney hops and ripe fruit.  Body is medium and smooth.  Plums, sour cherries, spicy yeast, caramel and herbal hops fill the mouth.  Finish is long and spicy. Delicious brew."

"D: An interesting brew, but too sweet for my taste.  This one does improve with warming though, so be patient. (3.5)"

"taste is a little dank. a bit sweet like a dopple, some wheat in there, but certainly not of the same quality of many of its german counterparts. it's not bad, it's actually good, but I think the dank, mustiness of the aroma is a huge turnoff as that is the first tactile sense one gets..."
