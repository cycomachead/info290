"Aroma dark fruit, earthiness, cherries. Taste acetic cherries, wine."
"I'm obviously not getting this beer. The pinot noir flavor dominates to the point that I'd rather have a glass of the real thing."

"(O)- A very nice array of flavors and blending involved to make this beer. Subtle wine notes really make this shine."

"Pours into my Schneider &Brooklyner Hopfen Weisse glass a deep somewhat murky chesnut brown with deep reddish hue,a billowing light tan colored head atop that leaves no laceing as it settles slowly.Wow the Pinot Noir barrel really stands out but doesn't overwhelm the nose,musty phenols and a hint of sherry vinegar rounds the aroma profile out.Very low carbonation with a fuller feel,very mellow.Pinot noir grapes are really big on the palate along with oak,the weizenbock flavors come into form the more I drink,some spiced phenols and faint chocolate come alive as it warms.Very interesting and as others have said it's good to see an old school traditional German brewer try things like this.It's a sipper but it's complex and different."

"D - I'm excited to see German breweries stepping outside their comfort zone a little. This wasn't mind-blowing, but it demonstrated solid craftsmanship and the willingness to experiment. I wish it smelled a bit more like it tasted, as the aroma was a bit too conservative to justify the marked price increase."

"Medium bodied with tart sourness and a very strong vinous barrel character that dominates the flavor profile, lingering over the malt backbone into a dry acetic finish. Almost all barrel until the finish with toasted oak, vanilla and dominant vinous red wine flavor with dark grape, tart cherry, currant and other dark berries. Underneath, there is some faint roasted malt but it's overpowered by the barrel and acetic acid. As it warms the acetic character stands out a but more with strong vinegar in the finish. Still, it's not solvent like and it blends well with the tartness and vinous barrel notes. Flavorful but kind of one dimensional with all elements of the base beer completely obliterated. I wish that there was a touch of weizenbock flavor but any can't pick up anything that resembles the style."
"This beer was putried cold, but got better as it warmed. It still didn't really do it for me. I would've preferred some more barrel character and a bit of sourness to make all the flavors shine. To me it was just sort of a weizenbock with some extra flavors thrown in that didn't really mesh."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. I really enjoyed the aromas and flavors created by the barrel aging."
"O: Very enjoyable but this is a sipping beer that needs to be enjoyed slowly and is best shared between a few people. The barrel aging really adds to this beer and contributes a lot of flavors/aromas and mouthfeel."

"This is a strange beer. I can't find this beer entirely convincing. It is somewhat overly fruity to my taste with the wine notes that I normally like being overplayed once the weizen comes into it."
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. The base beer which I believe is a take on Aventinus is works extremely well in conjunction with the Pinot wine barrel flavors. The vinous wine notes do not overpower but instead work seamlessly with the base Weizenbock in a beautiful melange of sweet malt, oak tannins, fruit and spice."
"Very syrupy mouthfeel. Really the main problem I have with it. Unlike other Weizenbocks of similar strength, this does not have the carbonation to carry all the flavors to a happy place. Just too sticky. A 750ml split between 2 would have been better split between 3 or 4. That said, a worthwhile experiment. I want to love it and I'll buy another bottle just to see what happens."
"A stunner for sure, on par with the illustrious original."
