3.41,-6.8,3.25,4,3.25,2.5,3.5,"It's an interesting beer—not unpalatable, certainly—but it's a little too much along several axes, and a little not enough along others.  The mouthfeel is somehow both a bit syrupy and a bit thin; the prominence of the chocolate exaggerates as the beer warms and sits with you; and while there is a ""hint of banana from the yeast"" on the nose, there's much more than a hint of the yeast in the beer itself.  Still, Terrapin admits this Side Project (#22) ""is clearly a hoax"" of a rendition of the style, so some deviations are forgivable; nonetheless, it seems ""the addition of cocoa nibs and orange peel for a greater depth of flavor"" failed to actually provide much depth of flavor, beyond big orange and thick cacao notes, so it's hard to be especially enthused about this Moonray.","OrestesMethuon","Nov 08, 2014"

3.38,-7.7,2.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: This was a fairly ugly beer, with tons of yeast floaters. Not a deal-breaker there, but needs to be pointed out. The flavors were decent, but neither the chocolate nor orange had the large presences I expected. It also lacked some of the clean lager flavor appeal that makes the weizenbock a good style. An interesting concept, but I feel like the execution could have been better.","macrosmatic","Oct 02, 2014"

It pours orange and is very light in texture. It was very sweet with a strong orange taste until the end where you get the chocolate. It did get a little stale tasting after the finish.","Metaldude05","Jun 01, 2014"
