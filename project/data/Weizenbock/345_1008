Pours a dull brown, somewhat reminiscent of prune juice in color and clarity, with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head.  Nose expresses grape notes and yeast.  Taste consistent with nose; however, it's all a bit dull.  There's also a suggestion of bubblegum, as well as a hint of noble hops towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a prickly carbonation.  Overall, a bit bland for a style I generally like.  The alcohol is certainly well-hidden on this one, however.","Jwale73","Jan 06, 2015"

Smell: sweet wheat bread, caramel, big clove, and a banana pudding (chemically banana) note. Taste: banana pudding made with cloves, topped with caramel. If you made this, it would taste just like this beer. There's really nothing else going on... a note of brown bread. It's enjoyable and, well, it's hard to completely whiff on this style, but it's not even on the same field as a poor-man's version of Aventinus. 2014 fall bottling.","babaracas","Nov 18, 2014"

4.22,4.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had all the key aspects that I look for in the style with the carbonation being the only aspect that felt a little out of place.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, just a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think two would be my limit, anymore than that and i think the prickly carbonation would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, aroma and appearance, they were all very nice and they worked really well with this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but I felt like the carbonation was  a little too lively for the style.  I would buy this beer again if I see it and I will for sure get some next year if shows up in my area.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the style, it does a good job at showing what the style all about and it's good example of a American made Weizenbock.  All in all I was very happy with this beer, it did a good job at satisfying my urge for a good Weizenbock.  It isn't my favorite of the style, but it is one of the better Victory beers I've had.  Great job guys, this was one tasty Weizenbock, keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","Nov 12, 2014"

Pours hazy reddish copper color with a 2-3 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Incredible appearance. Aromas of big banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible weizenbock! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 27, 2014"

Over time, the spice from the yeast takes over the finish and prevents the cloying that makes many a one-glass option. Towards the end of the growler, a sense of cinnamon emerged. Barrel aging would sand this down a bit and make the sugars more complex. A late fall beer, I can see this pairing well with pumpkin pie, paired against its spice and real whipped cream. Or with a rubbed-and-grilled pork roast and sauerkraut. In any case, this is a beer constructed to be drunk slowly and matched with food and/or a cigar with body. 3.75","BuckeyeSlim","Nov 02, 2013"

Some nice lacing on the glass. Some stickiness in the fluid evident. Smell is sweet with banana, alcohol and caramel. Lovely warm dark bread aromas. Taste is full of overripe banana and clove. Raisins and dark fruity sweetness. Wheat malt twang cuts through with a dark toasted nuttiness and caramel vanilla notes.Alcohol is well integrated and not overpowering. Fell is velvety with a silky carbonation and a smoothness to the swallow. Aventinus sets such a high bar to touch that I am doubley impressed by the overall excellence of this brew. It is so close that I would not be surprised by someone preferring the domestic version. It's that good.","scootny","Nov 23, 2012"

Caramel malt, wheat, banana aroma. .A pleasant weizenbock with some dark fruit flavors. Typical weizen clove spice, orange and sweetness at first, dark fruit and light malt middle and a bit of hops at the end. A light metallic flavor on the finish mars an otherwise very nice beer.

The nose I get is mainly clove, banana, apple, malt, bread. Very nicely blended into a good cold weather brew. Ah... The taste takes it up a notch. Everything in the nose is here- and it's blended very well. It's close to a 4.5, but I'll leave it at a 4 for now. The flavors really come alive in this beer- and the spices are very well done. Feel is medium-full, w/ some big time carbonation on the back end, and aftertaste. Big spices on the aftertaste as well. The only complaint I have is there isn't more presence from the malt.

Scents are mainly fruity - orange peel and lemon - with a little wheat as well. The smell could use a little more oomph though. There's a lot going on in the taste - it combines the flavors of a wit with a hefeweizen - and boy is it good! Banana and bread give a bubble gum-like sweetness, and a twinge of lemon gives a perfect amount of tartness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, though carbonation is high.

Insanely drinkable given the complexity and alcohol and it constantly draws me in to drink more. And with every sip you get different flavors as the temperature change draws out different elements.

It pours a murky rusty sunset sienna topped by a finger of dusty cream-tan foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, light nutmeg, rye bread, dark wheat, and a touch of raisins. The taste brings in more of the same, with an emphasis on the wheat, banana, clove, and raisin. A touch of cinnamon is added in for good measure. Everything just melds beautifully and tastily. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a highly enjoyable weizenbock, one of my favorites of the style, baby!","TMoney2591","Oct 10, 2011"

4.52,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Flavors of banana and spices create a rich, full flavor that follows through in every sip. A unique yeast strain gives this beer a distinctive taste on the back of the palate that rounds out the big banana notes. The spiciness is very prevelant, as well as a hint of cinnamon, giving the spices a sweet, almost pie-like taste. Other spices are remeniscent of an herb garden, but it blanaces and works nearly perfectly in this beer. The alcohol is not in your face, but is noticeable when looked for. It creates a deceptively easy to drink beer, as it goes down fast and easy. The mouthfeel is as silky smooth as the head looks, with a clean and dry finish that complements the flavors oh so well. The mouthfeel here actually makes the beer as awesome as it is by adding a layer of texture that is nothing but pleasant. This beer is very complex, but so enjoyable and full-flavored that its simple to drink. I really like this one, and once again Victory has impressed me.","chodinheaven","Sep 18, 2011"

Despite the half-full bottle being given an energetic swirl to homogenize the yeast of this weiss beer, it still poured as described. Its saving grace is that the yeast is never felt on the surface of the mouth.

The smell is bread, clove, banana, fruits like fig and raisin, and a mild yeast. Taste starts off spicy with clove, moves to banana peel and yeast, and finishes bready and sweet. Very little fruit maybe a mild fig but it's really covered by yeast. More bitter than expected but the ABV is well covered. Drink ability is pretty nice but since fall came and went I may still be able to find old bottles but I really didn't love it. Was less drinkable than the Hofbrau version since the bitterness but more drinkable than Aventinus. A sort of average middle ground but great rep of the style.","DrDemento456","Nov 29, 2010"

The taste is delicious with really sweet malty flavors leading the way. Lots of fruit, including bananas are coming and going. There are plenty of flavors that I cannot put my finger on; this is definitely not a boring or mono-dimensional brew. The mouthfeel is thicker than a hefeweizen and less than a dobblebock, which is to say just about perfect for me. A little more carbonation might be nice, but who knows? Despite the slightly high ABV this is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is extremely well hidden which I appreciate. If Moonglow has any faults it's the lack of a head and it could be too sweet for some. Still, I'm quite impressed. This is my third in three days and the other three will disappear quickly.

The bananas were still there with some clove, but there seemed to be a bit of booze flavor that mixed with the flavor of the plum. Nothing else seemed to get through. There was a distinct bitterness to the beer that was unpleasant for the flavors involved. The mouthfeel was still fairly smooth despite the astringent nature of the beer.

The malt is rich and substantial and it provides a solid base from which the yeast can branch out with a variety of flavors. There is a lot of spice and some dark fruit with clove, banana, vanilla, and light smoke being the most prominent. These yeast derivitives work very nicely with the toffee and caramel of the dark malt and create a complex, sweet beer that is as much a dessert as it is a beverage. Weizenbocks are not always my favorite beers as they can be really cloying when the yeast notes and sweet malt don't work well together, but in this case everything harmonizes quite well and I have a hard time imagining a better example of this style.","nickfl","Oct 26, 2010"

Nose is a bit subdued but the expected elements are detected- semi-sweet, dark dried fruits, banana, earth, yeast. It makes me think of dried chocolate-covered cherries even though there's nothing explicitly chocolatey about it. The mouthfeel is moderately thick, but thinner than expected. A swirl of the glass brings an explosion of fizzy carbonation and head that settles almost as quickly as it rose. Taste is toffee, dried cherries, a bit of banana and stale cinnamon warmth.

Spiced orange peels, orange pekoe tea, cloves all up in the nose, apricots and touch of banana, sodabread, curiously the scents never get as sweet as you first expect, however, by the same token minimal wheat presence. Full-bodied, spreads its ample heft across the tongue and even the slight prickle from the carbonation isn't getting it out of the beanbag chair. More orange, tangerine citrus, large presence. The wheat more noticeable due to overall dry texture, even in the face of apricot, peach, apple, fig fruit and clove, cinnamon spice. Honey and caramelized brown sugar there is judicious proportion.

4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The first sip reveals a great mouthfeel on this one, and the wheat provides a great softness that keeps the carbonation just the right side of aggressive. The flavour is lighter on the banana than a lot of weizenbocks, and goes heavy on the clove. At first I didn't like this, but once the palate became used to the flavours everything seemed better integrated. There's a nice prominent wheat backbone, and its slight sourness helps to alleviate what could rapidly become a sweet and spicy disaster. Instead, what we're left with is a nicely balanced weizenbock that's spicier than most, but no less drinkable.","bobsy","Jan 17, 2010"

It seems to detract from the other weizenbock qualities. The taste is a lot like the aroma. Again, it has some nice banana, and clove to it, but way too much alcohol for my liking. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a texture that leaves things to be desired. Overall, this is a decent beer, but not a very good weizenbock.

Has an unmistakable wheat beer smell. It has a nice sweet flavor up front. There are some fruit notes, but they are very subtle. The sweetness is balanced very nicely by malt character of the beer.

Quite fruity, I get a faint bit of mango-like character too. Bready mid-palate before a pleasantly phenolic finish with some spice (clove). Medium in body with a touch higher carbonation that it needs (but it dies off fairly quick) , the finish makes for an enjoyable beer. Another mildly disappointing aspect about the mouthfeel is that despite its heft, it doesn't really leave a lasting impression on the palate.

Full bodied, high carbonation, very pleasant with a rich, flavorful sweet aftertaste with a mild alcohol presence. Flavor would be scored higher if not for a slightly medicinal taste that lingers stronger in the finish as the beer warms up. Otherwise, flavor follows the nose, more fruity than spicy, banana and apple with clove and corriander spices in midbody for balance.

It's interesting to finally go back and taste this brew after many years. On that note (and after having quite a few other quality weizenbocks over the years), I don't think this brew is as good as I previously thought. It's not bad for an American attempt, but there's a moderate grape soda flavor mixed in with a hint of plastic/Band-aid which I don't care for in the style.

Looks fine when first poored, with a nice orange base and a rocky tan two finger head. But the head quickly fades and with little visible carbonation, the beer looks more like an uncarbonated cider. The nose is sweet and a touch of alcohol pokes through occasionally. The taste is also sweet with a slightly prickly carbonation that leads to a dry peppery hop finish. A little odd actually.

Flavors are of over-ripened bananas, plums, and cherries, with hints of currants as well; nice malty sweetness; bready yeasts; and somewhat of a fermented bitterness that provides some balance.

The color is beautiful on this one, and it is an easy drinking, yet warming brew. A solid offering from Victory, they have gained back a bit of my respect with this one, which they had nearly lost for good (aside from the staple that is storm king).

This beer is full-bodied and a thick; a great sipper. All packed into this beer is a creamy body that has a sweet, sugary taste along with both dark and tropical fruits like banana and apple (not tropical, I know) and sweet malts.

Apple, banana, clove, vanilla bean, caramel, even some grapefruit...very "to style". Rich, fruity flavor complimented by peppery phenols. Light banana bread too. Creamy yet light on the tongue from the lively carbonation. A slight warming sensation in the throat is the only hint at its strength. Good weizenbock.","wedge","Dec 01, 2008"

Musty, old flavor with a slight refreshing sweet hop aftertaste. Honestly this is not what I expected. I thought it was going to be more of a strong, lighter, high alcohol beer.. sort of like Hevelius only lighter. But I'll take this as a learning experience. The BA description of Weizenbock basically describes it as a strong Dunkleweizen and that's exactly what it is and they do it well. It's fruity, sort of like overripe apples, with a lot of banana flavor from the yeast exactly like Franziskaner Dunkleweizen. The alcohol mixes really nicely with the Dunklweizen flavor and makes it very enjoyable. I once bought a case of Franziskaner Dunkleweizen and after 20 of them or so became increasingly intolerant of its musky Germanness and this is definitely bringing back those memories. Really amazing to see such a dead-on German style from an American brewery and so well done.","wiseguy142","Nov 13, 2008"

The taste isn't bad or off but it's not well balanced, and the huge presence of bitterness pretty much lowers the drinkability of any wheat-based beer, and all that alcohol pulling through makes it hard to appreciate the mild and sometimes subtle fruity flavors going on.

Mild but attention getting. The taste brings a creamy and deliciously mellow blend of wheat and apple, very consistent with the aroma. It's nicely carbonated, refreshing and flavorful. A Christmas inspired taste I would say, but nothing goofy, very "tasteful". Lot's of clove, licorice/anisette with a near perfect body.

The taste is of banana and bubble gum but is quickly followed by a big toasted malt presence. There is quite a balance by the sweet weizen phenols and bitter toasted malt.

About 20% into the taste a sizable wave of the medium malts creeps up from behind and surprises the back of the tongue.

The wheat is forcibly sweet, but in an enjoyable assertive way, and the bountiful fruits are a gracious zymurgian gift. The ABV is about as crafty as one could be, sneaking up as you drink, imparting a comforting warmth while it zotzes your synapses. In spite of that, it is quite easy to drink, but it requires a knowing caution, if you value your next-morning well-being.

3.77,-6.9,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured from the bottle ("Enjoy by Sept. 15, '07" written on label) into a weizen glass. Pours an interesting range of colors, from light orange/amber at the base and top to deep reddish-brown in the heart of the body. It's a pretty beer alright. A nice two-finger head settled after the pour, but dissipated quickly leaving no real evidence of lace. The aroma is sweet with notes of apple, raisin, plum, and pear. Some cinammon stick is hidden deep within, as well as other holiday season spices. Also I can smell butter crust. Is it me, or does this thing smell like a fresh fruit pie? A damn good fruit pie at that. The taste is refreshing. I can detect some banana, apple, pear, and even some orange in here as well. There's a woody feel to it as well. It has a pleasant balance between the malt and hops. It's a fruity weizenbock, to be sure, but the malt holds its own, and the hop content keeps the whole thing from getting too carried away. The 8.7% ABV could easily sneak up on you; the heat is completely overshadowed by the beer's overall flavor. A bit weak in the mouthfeel, in my opinion, which is too bad. It doesn't linger in the taste buds like some of Victory's other beers, or like some other Weizenbocks for that matter. As a result, though, it comes up short in the end. For such a nice beer, it would be great to have it resonate in the finish a bit more. Still, it's a thirst quencher and a fine brew.","Atlas1","Jan 20, 2007"

Pleasant, full, round mouthfeel with just the right amount of tingly carbonation for the style. Taste is sweet, reminiscent of banana-nut bread, caramel apple, crystal malts, fresh yeast and mild spices. Finishes with the slightest presence of hop bitterness to tame any cloyishness. 8.7% ABV is non-detectable; very smooth and stealth.

Heavy malt with mild bitterness. Things blended together to give a banana bread-like character. Full bodied (just short of chewy) with medium/low carbonation. Off-dry.

It doesn't have much aroma at first, but when it comes around I detected bananas, yeast, a good spiciness, wheat, and maybe some sweet fruit/bubblegum aroma. The first flavors are spiciness and alcohol, but when it warms a bit, there are notes of bananas, fruits, faint hops, spicy phenols, and some tangy wheat in the background.

4.5,11.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Since todays moon is nearly full it has peaked above the horizon just as I have finished raking leaves and stopped to try Victory Moonglow Weizen Bock ( bottled six days after The August 2005 Full Sturgeon Moon. A clear caramel amber Bock with a careful pour- although I know better I did not swirl up the yeast in the pour. Well carbonated a 1-11/2 finger creamy moon colored head that could have given this Bock its name, persists and slowly becomes a full fat disk of bubbles outlined by a raised meniscus that rings the 0.4 L rastal sniffer. Tilted to my nose I notice the legs and lace on the sides of the New Belgium glass. Bananna esters and faint clove allow more faint fruit aromas to emerge - plum and perhaps pear. Alcohol more in the aroma than the taste helped by my choice of glassware and the 65Â°F room temperature of the beer. At 8.7 this Weizen Bock is smack in the middle of the 7 - 10 % abv range for the style. The alcohol warms but is completely hidden in the not quiet full bodied sweet caramel laced with spices and fruit flavors. A few of these and you will howl at the moon! Truely a thing of beauty - finally I swirl the 12 oz bottle and rough pour in the "magical yeast strain" responsible for this nearly excellent Weizen Bock. Nice yeast taste that muddys and moderate the aroma and flavors I have described above. I would have missed a lot of the joy of this beer had I swirled in the yeast at the first pour. Either way, I am moon struck by this haunting seasonal brew.","karst","Dec 13, 2005"

The taste was again very similar to a hyper Hefeweizen, with every phenolic element present, but only more so. Reminiscent of liquefied banana nut bread with spices, this beer went down very easily with not a single hint of the high ABV content. To add an American twist to the style, a definite hop bitterness was detectable towards the end of each swallow. Carbonation was extremely fine and gave this a creamy mouthfeel. What a dangerously drinkable beer! I can see this one getting someone is trouble quite easily, as it packs quite a punch that you can never see coming.

The taste is a spicy complex mix of sour cherries, tart apples, and bitter grapefruit with a balancing malt sweetness. It all goes down pretty easily with a medium body and warm alcohol. There is no hop flavor or aroma, just enough bitterness for a bitter finish after the sweet and sour flavor. This is a fine brew.

The alcohol is not terribly noticeable, but you'll feel a little warmer towards the end of the glass. Definitely one that could be sessioned, albeit dangerously.

3.57,-11.9,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours with very little head that quickly dies to a thin, patchy cover of slick-looking, tiny grayish bubbles with zero cling. Carbonation is visible despite the murk of yeast particles suspended in this sienna or iced tea-colored liquid with foggy orange highlights. Aromas of gingerbread and dried banana chips with hints of dried apple, clove, and bubblegum are initially pleasant, with a big finish like vanilla extract. Prickly nosefeel full of acid and spice is a bit thin. And then, everything gets washed out by alcohol. This is just a hint of things to come: flavors bitter with clove, sweet like bubblegum being slathered on banana bread, hints of raisins, and alcohol. Aftertaste is a vise grip of nutmeg, clove, SenSens, and alcohol. Intense, tingling mouthfeel practically numbs the palate with carbonation or... could it be... ALCOHOL? Surely, intrinsic flavors are being masked here. At 8.7 abv this is a one-at-a-time type of beer befitting an autumn afternoon, but other than that, somewhat heavy-handed. Complex for sure, but what's the point when it's got a body like mouthwash?","NearerMyBeerToMe","Oct 13, 2004"

Other BAs had been sipping theirs out of nice Hefeweizen glasses, but our pours came in proper Aventinus glasses. Hmm, was this beer going to be worthy? Halfway worthy? Well, by golly it was, and even I thought so. In fact, if I didn't know it was from an American brewery, I would have thought it was German. Dark amber in color, wheat colored head was impressive (hey, it was in an Aventinus glass). I got yeast and alcohol off the aroma. Faint clove and banana. Taste was medium in body, well-rounded, full of flavor, but not so much I was gasping. Kind of hard to describe..everything was all nice and balanced, and luckily, I wasn't left thinking cloying, or bubblegummy, or... Solid malt. Smooth Wheat.

Not as dark as other weizenbocks I've had. Smells of winey grapes, bubble gum, slight burned bananas, and alcohol. Tastes much like the smell, with steady sweetness throughout. Wheat tang finish with residual sweetness. Good stab at this style, and better than my homebrew WB, but no Aventinus...","alexgash","Feb 05, 2004"

The smell was somewhat yeasty and musty, with attractive granny smith apple and banana aromatics. The taste was lovely...a tart zip start joined by soft malts, with tartness and banana in the lingering finish. Extremely tasty and full flavored with refreshing crispness. The medium body and carbonation of the beer matched the set of flavors well. Moonglow was very enjoyable and satisfying. Big thanks to weefishheads for making this beer available for tasting!","HiroProtagonist","Jan 18, 2004"
4.62,14.1,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a not quite clear copper amber with a two finger beige head that fades into nice sheet lacing. The label is one of the more attractive ones I've seen, and was imprinted with an "enjoy by Aug 20 04" date. Nose is complex, bananas, oranges, pineapples, toffee, cloves, and hints of Belgian yeasts. Crisp and well carbonated in the mouth, yet creamy and medium bodied. Taste is of toffee and caramel soaked in a fruit basket. Ruby red grapefruit, bananas, oranges, and pineapples. Carbonation keeps it all vibrant all the way to the end. No presence of alcohol is noted, in spite of the listed 8.7abv. This is an extraordinary brew from the folks at Victory. Very well crafted and pleasantly complex. Highly enjoyable.","merlin48","Jan 09, 2004"

Taste was very weird. It was like a tug-of-war between the fruitness and the spiciness. The battle was still going on while I swallowed it. But the aftertaste was too much for me. There was just too much spiciness at the end and I could taste the alcohol at the end too. Had a hard time finishing this beer because of the aftertaste. I will try it again someday, perhaps my tastebuds had a night off or something.","necoadam","Jan 03, 2004"

There were some aromas of pear and overripe apples. the taste was real clean and the wheat flavors dominated. Same fruit flavors as I smelled were present in the beer. Good mouthfeel, well balanced carbonation and a nice balance to the flavors of wheat and mild hop background. The beer finished dry and after some time the residual hop flavors really came out. A long finishing beer that was quite enjoyable","counselor","Dec 31, 2003"

4.4,8.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"This beer poured a rich cherry wood color with a ruby red glow about it. It was very clear with a first pour and well carbonated. After the send and most generous pour I partook in the yeast on the bottom for the true effect and it became noticeable cloudy and a shade paler. The head that was produced was creamy, rich, and thick, about 2 inches of dense foam. It was light tan/vanilla cream colored and it lasted for some time before I could actually take my first sip. Then after it fell it a skim on the top and a healthy ring on the edges. There was a lace present that seemed to be in sheet form almost the whole way to the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly rich, aromas of dark fruit (plums), some bananas, rich sweet malts, spices and yeast all were present and quite distinctive. The tasted that rolled over my tongue were sweet, rich and at times tangy. Flavors of bananas, plums, some dark berries, a slight hop bite, tad wheat grain flavors in the middle along with big sweet malts, spices, near the swallow, a pine presence came and went, alcohol was present throughout the sip and finished with a yeasty malty flavor. The aftertaste was dominated with fruity, yeasty hops. Not lasting on the pallet but present. The body was more of a medium to medium heavy on the mouth. What can I say, this beer got better from the day I first got the case a few months back. I did notice that when allowed to warm a few degrees the flavors and aromas became more rich and noticeable. A really good beer and another hit for Victory.","Jarod","Dec 20, 2003"

Big ester nose on this one, with a background of anise and brown sugar. Nice medium and creamy mouthfeel, flavor starts with pleasant banana and pineapple (slightly lactic), just a touch of tartnesss, and transitions to a light fruit syrup impression that's touched by some herbal notes. No strident lemon notes. Sense of alcohol. Slightly granular in texture. Decent entry, a Weizenbock is one of the great uses for wheat in a beer for me.","ADR","Dec 16, 2003"

3.73,-7.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Super nice concentrated color, looks like a solid glass of dark caramel, some yellowness peaks around the edges, a thin loose tannish head emerged that didn't last and the lacing is very minimal. Aroma is super tangy of fruity citrus, ripe melon, orange peels, mango, peach, dulled grapes, quite a fruit juice effect in the aroma, underlaying sweet malts and musty yeast, notes of ethanol. Taste is a lip smacking attack of tangy dullish citrusy fruits, mostly orange peels and peach skins with some mango and light banana mixed in. Pretty sweet and quickly tangy, malty, twingy with notes of raw orange peels coming through late in the finish as it drys out somewhat and keeping a sweetly souring, almost puckering tang. Feel is a bit thin at first but begins to fill in as it goes and drys out some in the finish. Sneaky alcohol hits your head after half the glass. A pretty decent brew, the tangyness is pretty high with a overall orange peel effect throughout its character. I can see where some would like this, but I don't think I'd try this again, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered either. I'm kinda torn with this one, I want to like it cuz Victory makes some fantastic brews, but something with this beer keeps me from thoroughly enjoying it.

Yes, Moonglow tastes spicy, almost a sour fruitiness to it too. It's very drinkable, it feels soft in my mouth, and I tend to forget about the alcohol content in this stuff.

Appearance is a nice auburn, just a tad hazy. Smells like a hefe on steroids, very wheaty and malty, but with strong scents of banana and spice competing for attention. Body is quite full and taste is initially sweet and very wheaty/malty, then followed by a big fruit presence reminiscent of apples and of course bananas.

Banana and cloves wrapped in alcohol sweetness with a bread chaser greets the nose. The taste is surprisingly tart, similar to a berliner-weisse, but it has a thick, roasted background. Tartness fades to a smooth, refreshing sweetness mid-palate. The finish is somewhat clean, with a lingering roasted note and a touch of bitterness. There's a lot going on in this beer, and it seems like the beginning is at odds with the end, and all the flavors in between do is antagonize the whole situation. This is an enjoyable beer, but perhaps there's such a thing as too much complexity? That being said, I'd buy it again.

The Moonglow is the ultimate chill evening beer, as it is guaranteed to warm you with its 8.7%. It pours a deep reddish brown with a whispy yellow-tan head. The smells are of banana, clove, and vivacious fruit. The taste is very strong, beginning with a fruity blast of again, banana, along with other organic aromatics. The finish is tart, and leaves a slick feel on one's pallete. Not surprisingly, the aftertaste is very reminiscent of another big abv Victory beer, golden monkey. The thick fermented wheat taste is what lends the slight sour finish. I can't get enough. The complexity of this brew is what really stands out for me though. I enjoy beers that challenge a pallete, and just because it doesn't taste like my Hop Devil doesn't mean I'm apt to write it off as being 'less than what I expect from Victory'. I love this beer. It has everything you could ever want. Let it warm to 60 F, sip it slowly, and let the flavors interplay.

I bought it thinking that, being a Victory, it had the potential to rock my world. In the end however, I wish I would have sought out a store that sold it by the single, instead of $11 for a sixer. Funny how I can say this is both one of the best beers I've had recently and one of the most overpriced I've had ever.

The appearance was stellar. It was a murky amber color with a beautiful head. The head was super thick and very frothy, which lasted quite a while. The smell was a mixture of many things. It was very strong in the area of fruits, like citrus, plums, and grapes. It was also had a subtle pumpkin pie smell to it. This also came out in the taste, which had both clashing together. I thought it was waaay to sweet and was more like fruit salad, than beer. I am definately going to stay clear of this one.

Although the brewing expertise of the boys at Victory shows, I have to say that this was one of their worse ideas. Moonglow is a very well crafted beer. The mouthfeel is great and it looks fantastic, but I just think that the flavor is awful. It's not that the Victory boys didn't achieve what they set out to accomplish, it's just that they probably shouldn't have done it in the first place. I think that this stuff tastes horrible, and I'm certainly not planning on buying it again, but I think that this is a result of personal tastes, not the quality of the beer.

Taste is buttery smooth and rich with alcohol soaked bananas, apples and pears. Pretty sweet and definite alcohol presence. Thankfully though it doesn't fail to show me the yeasty esters toward the end. This guy's more carbonated that the few other weizenbocks around.

Sweet and sour start, the top middling in feel and the finish mildly acidic, hops are forceful in their bite, quite dry aftertaste.

This had a big malty flavor, with fruitiness and bitterness blending well together. The malt is thick on the tongue, and then a sour sensation kicks in.

This beer is strong and proud, and all of its bold flavors meld together wonderfully. The dark caramel malts back up the yeast flavors and leave a little bit of sweetness that the german hops cannot fight. Possibly a little thicker and a little less carbonated than I would like.

Had to pour roughly to get that hefe head going and then it settled rapidly without even leaving a thin film on top. Aroma is that typical of a Dunkle Weizen with wheatish, apple like aromas. What surprised me is the sourness of this beer. It reminded me of drinking a sour belgian brown ale. There were some cherry flavors mixing with apple, plum, and slight chocolate notes. Could have used a little more sweet chocolate flavors to balance out the sourness. Mouthfeel was smooth and slippery.

I gave this an average score for drinkability because although I enjoy the taste of this beer, it would not be my first choice to pair with food, or even to crack one open for the game. This beer is a special treat to be enjoyed once and awhile.","pezoids","Sep 11, 2003"
4.3,6.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Words to the Wise: Let it warm up toward room temperature, put it in a flute-like glass as if it was a hefe-weizen as well as pour in the yeast. Cheers to V-Town for making a very rare style and doing it well.","nomad","Sep 08, 2003"
4.42,9.1,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Appearance: So here I am listening to the sounds of Neil Young's "Harvest Moon" imbibing upon one of the most appealing to the eye weizen bocks in existence, well the Moonglow of the deep amber mahogany body with a ruby brown tinted massive head leaving complete webs of lacing around my glass just reminds me of that glowing amber moon that sometimes mysteriously appears in the sky. Aroma: Where do I start, banana sauteed in a light pear liqueur and the presence of the wheat malt along with the magnificent tones of the yest born bliss. The alcohol nose isn't overbearing but blended across a spectrum of fruity yet musty tones of paradise, this beer has to be one of the most enticing aromatic creations ever to come across my path. Taste: Even as it warms the sharp wheat based malt sweetness mixed perfectly with the alcoholic tone fruits such as pear, banana, and mild apple tones over a brown sugar base arise and soar over the palate oh "come a little bit closer hear what I have to say", "just like children sleeping we could dream this night away", "but there's a full moon rising, let's go dancing in the light". Wow, this is an experience whoever samples this beer must pop in some Neil Young it's awesome together. Mouthfeel: Slight sense of chiunkiness to it medium to full bodied luscious wheat ale, a must try for all German style beer lovers, props go out to Bill and Ron on this one muchas gracias guys for creating not just a sessionn of exotic ale sipping, but one that will be emblazoned in my memory as one of the most skillfully constructed good times I have shared with true art. Drinkability: Well, I don't even know what the ABV of this beer is but I can tell you that after one I am feeling on another level of relaxation and at peace with the world. We all need that push to get us through the day, and to picture an evening with my own family someday and a night cap in the form of a Moonglow each day will be more blissful than the next.","WVbeergeek","Sep 02, 2003"
4.37,7.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I sampled the 2003 version on tap at Victory on 8/19/03. This year's version is totally different than last year and probably the best batch of Moonglow ever. This unfiltered, wheat beer pours a beautiful, brown earthy pastel with a robust off-white head. If your a fruit lover, the aroma will remind you of a bouquet of freshly picked apples with a hint of cinnamon. The flavor is dominated by a very delicious malty, spicey sweetness. The aroma translate to a taste of a refreshing fruit appetizer of apples, peaches, dates and rasions. A very tasty brew, but also a very deceptive brew. The finish displays a token amount of hops lurking in the background with this tinge of alcohol that lets you know that this can be a dangerous brew.","rotsaruch","Aug 20, 2003"
4.25,4.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Originally sampled from bottle on 4 November 2002. This beer was a pleasant surprise. Victory is very hard to get in my area, so when I noticed this seasonal I picked up a couple of bottles. What a nice flavor. Beautiful slightly cloudy amber color, w/ a hint of sweetness on the palate. Excellent beer!","jcalabre","May 26, 2003"
3.7,-8.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours to a deep copper color with a tan head. The aroma is sweet, fruity, and yeasty. The flavor is malty, sweet and fruity. It is a medium-full bodied brew with a sweet finish. It is a warming, spicy beer. It was not at all what I expected, but good none the less.","BeerBuilder","May 12, 2003"
3.48,-14.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours a brownish-cherry color with a thin tan head. Highly carbonated and hazy with slight suspended sediment. The aroma is a mix of citusy and grassy wheat smells, with a hint of yeastiness. This brew has an underlying sweetness that is presented at the first sip, and a full-force tartness (bordering on sour) that sticks through the aftertaste. It's really a refreshing, but slightly heavy beer. Not really what I expected, but it's very good.","Suds","Apr 13, 2003"
3.28,-19,4,3.5,3,4,3,"I am going to admitt this off the bat - it had gone spoiled. However, I am not letting that affect my ratings in the sense you might think. I think the tartness that was produced by "aging" ,if you will, had an interesting effect. The color was a cloudy, ruddy, orange. a good amount of head also seems to comes w/ each bottle. It was almost like mixing a sweet-tart and wheat beer, and I did enjoy the results.The thing is, in alot of way, it was like a cider, but a sour apple cider, quite interesting.Also by this time you could taste a hint of the ABV. I do wish to sample this fresh, but you know what, spoiled is an interesting and enjoyable alternative","PSUDREW","Apr 02, 2003"
3.9,-3.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Cloudy, darkish amber in color, with a thin, even head and a tart, fruity aroma. The flavor is sour in a tropical-fruit sort of way, with some definite spicy notes. Medium-full boided and a bit sweet, with a gently dry finish. I wasn't overly impressed, but got the impression this would be a nice beer on an Autumn evening. I was shocked to see the ABV on this beer is 8.9%. It doesn't show at all.","mzwolinski","Mar 02, 2003"
3.83,-5.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"It pours a really pretty golden-red with a thin white head the almost completely disappears. The smell is most definitely clove, but other spices are noticeable. In addition to clove, slightly fruity flavors are present. Citrus flavors become more pronounced working through the beer. It also seemed to become a bit too sweet and almost cloying as it warmed. It has a nice body and doesn't go down like a beer with an 8.7% abv. It's not the best beer Victory makes, but it's better than most beers.","mickeymac","Jan 09, 2003"
4.32,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The deep amber color , the soft head , the taste of banana , citrus, berry, and hints of spice gave this a good fresh taste to cover its high ABV. This one for me is one of my favs list, the full flavor that it provdes while mysteriously masking the ABV is very clever. A good desert for me.","stoutlove77","Jan 05, 2003"
4.17,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured out a rather nice red-gold colour with a good amount of murkiness. Moonglow is an apt name, as this almost did glow... Head wasn't huge, and settled back to a very thin layer for the rest of the glass. My problem here - floaties. Big chunks of yeast floating around in my glass. Maybe it could've been poured with more care, but there shouldn't have been that much and such big flakes. I took them a while to settle, as well. The taste was excellent. A very belgian style of a german beer. Lots of fruit - banana from the yeast, orange and lemon. Plenty of spice as well. Quite the beer. Would've gotten a five on the appearance if not for the floaties.","the42ndtourist","Dec 19, 2002"

3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Murky red-orange body, topped by a rapidly decaying off-white bubbly head. It's alive - lot of traffic in the glass as bubbles rise to top and yeast gently floats to bottom. Nose is dominated by apples, with bananas and clove in support. The apples and bananas are joined by more spices, and a wall of malt in the taste. Very full mouthfeel, smooth, but there is a hint of alcohol buried in the sensation. An autumnal warmer, a late night sipper, a bridge to the imperials, strong ales, and barleywines of winter.","RonfromJersey","Nov 17, 2002"
3.87,-4.4,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Perhaps the first Victory I wasn't totally blown away with (hey, nobody's perfect). I may also have been thinking Aventinus when drinking this, which isn't necessarily fair. Anyway, the beer has a nice copper color, slightly hazy, with a small tan head. Dark flecks floating around in the glass. Aroma is fruity and sweet, banana and spice, typical weiss aromas. Taste is also fruity and sweet, rich caramel, banana, spices (mostly clove, perhaps some nutmeg). Oddly, the taste is at once creamy and thin. Again maybe the Aventinus influence, but I wanted a bit of a richer, fuller flavor. Still, this is a nice beer, just not necessarily one that sets itself apart.","mophie","Oct 11, 2002"
4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Cloudy. Deep orange with a brownish cast, topped by a frothy deep tan head that drops but holds well. The aroma is fruity, lightly tangy, and sweet with some banana, vanilla and spice (which includes clove, but is not necessarily limited to it). The body is medium with a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation. The flavor is quite rich, starting with a very creamy and lightly caramel maltiness, turning fruity, yeasty and lightly tangy with apple notes, then revealing some banana and vanilla before it finishes with a lingering spiciness. The alcohol is fairly well hidden within the flavor, but it's strong enough that you feel it before the glass is through. 8.7%... whew! Surprisingly complex. An interesting and enjoyable beer. Well brewed.  This is a fall seasonal packaged with Halloween in mind, and I can't think of a better, or more appropriate time to enjoy this. The perfect "warming" beer for sitting on the back porch on a crisp evening with the smell of damp leaves and wood smoke wafting through the air.","NeroFiddled","Oct 07, 2002"
3.15,-22.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a foamy tan head of about an inch that settles quickly to almost nothing..a cloudy/murky gold in color...the nose has a sour apple nose and a faint wheat aroma...the taste is thirstquenching but it is a very sour apple flavor with little else emerging...It has an OK malt backbone, but I expected more of a spiciness and bananna flavor as well....very good but well below Aventius in my opinion....","ZAP","Jul 10, 2002"
4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Brown with a good amount of white head and a bit of haze.  Very nice aroma.  Light - medium bitterness.  Nice malt, almost nutty, character with sweet undertones.  Finishes with nice bitterness.  Really smooth and nicely drinkable.  Victory, again, does not fail to impress.","jreitman","Jun 04, 2002"
4.7,16,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy light amber with a nice creamy head.  The smell is wheat with a lot of yeast and some fruity undertones in there.  Taste starts off with a nice wheat flavor that slowly turns to yeast then banana and finally into a slightly tart apple flavor.  The tongue is left with a yeasty taste that leaves you wanting more.  Very creamy and smooth and extremely drinkable.  Damn this is one fine brew, but what else do I expect from my favorite East Coast brewery.","Murph","May 13, 2002"
