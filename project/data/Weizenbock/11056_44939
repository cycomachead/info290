Pretty much the same in the flavour, grain and banana with dried fruit and caramel sweetness. Faint roasted character and a bit of alcohol warmth/flavour in the finish. A bit cleaner than I expected. Full bodied with low carbonation. I liked it. Well balanced for a big beer.","DrJay","Beers"

I don't notice any hops, which is OK, instead I get a little spiciness though I can't pin down the spice. I don't pick up anything I'd associate with wheat, the fruit flavors dominate. Overall, it's a tasty beer.","deg","Jan 21, 2014"

For such a heavy-duty ale this Trois Mousquetaires beer has a significant claim to the cellar - it's the kind of offering you can sit on for as long as you like, until you're fully prepared for its thundering, forcible presence.","biegaman","0"

3.74,-2.1,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"A ruby red pour, a very low if not faint in hops. Malty and sugary this is, and this very much masks the abv content of the brew. Apricot and dates, caramel, grainy, this is a tick taste! The surprising thing about this brew it is strong & surgery in taste, the time at which it leaves the palette is a snap. This is a very drinkable beer, I would recommend only a medium chill.","Electros","Dec 18, 2012"
3.97,3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy brown with a foamy orange-khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and a variety of dark fruits. Taste is much the same with a distinct grape juice flavor. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 16, 2012"

4.15,8.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a dark maroon, mocha/dark cream coloured head modest retention and lacing. Nose has some deep, dark fruit notes, plums, light chocolate, grapey and lightly vinous/herbal. Tastes of plummy and sweet dark fruits, light wheat character. Sweet malt profile with some brown sugar. Sweet, sticky and full feel, only light alcohol. Low carbonation. A solid dunkelweizenbock, a little sweet but some nice flavours and complexity.","liamt07","Aug 21, 2011"

Not bad but didn't knock me out, would like to try this with 6 months to a year on it to see if it rounds out some of the rougher edges.","peensteen","Jul 04, 2011"

To open a 750ml of this by yourself is just stupid. Buy one of these, stash it away for a couple years and pull it out at a dinner party to split amongst a table of people; that seems to be what would best suit this brew.
