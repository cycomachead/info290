Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with earth, caramel, banana, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great smell, but the flavors are more earthy than I was expecting.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 07, 2014"

I got a yeasty aroma of clove, and just strait up yeast. For the flavor I was picking up on some wheat and other malt flavors with a slightly sweet finish. Not sure if the looks of the beer caused my to think this, but to me the beer almost tasted like graff. A malty mixture with some slight apple notes and a similar mouth feel minus the acidity. Very interesting beer I would love to know how they brewed it.","i4ourgot","Feb 20, 2014"

This beer pours a very cloudy burnt orange color, with a fingers width of off white head. The beer smells of yeast spice and citrus. Taste does pack a punch of yeast spice, banana, some cloves and citrus. Way to much banana and yeast spice for my liking. On the other hand It does leave a nice lingering tangerine after taste.

It's very rare that I would say this about the aroma of an American edition of a German style, but it competes with the best Germans. Taste follows suit, with big wheat and fruity characteristics.

Seriously, this stuff is like the beer-form of vanilla wafer & banana pudding. Succulent finish of orange peel and creamy wheat malts. Mouthfeel is perfect, with a medium body and light carbonation level. All in all, this is not only the best of the SN Beer Camp 12-pack, but one of the best Weizenbocks I've had (it helps that it is uber-fresh). Not exactly typical of the style, but definitely in the same vein as Brooklyn/Schneider's Hopfen-Weisse.

3.83,-4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D: It is very easy to drink and you won't mind drinking a few of these. It is quite tasty without being overpowering. It successfully blends the wheat and spices to create a fine example of a weizenbock.","BilbosNuts","May 09, 2011"
4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Included in the ""Beer Camp"" mix pack. Big punch of banana ester at the front, followed by more fruity esters and a candy-sugar sweetness that veers perhaps a bit toward Belgian influences. Substantial malt body leaves no question as to the bock aspect of the beer. Quite nice.","Brent","May 09, 2011"
2.93,-26.6,2.5,2,3.5,3,3,"After 3 successes, I was excited to try this last bottle. However, I was greeted with a bit of early disappointment. completely impenetrable orange liquid with a smallish head. bananas and bandages, a little clove. a bit offputting on the nose. flavor improves though, slightly sweet, bananas, vanilla, clove, licorice. Sweet banana is nice, but overall I'm just not all that jazzed about this brew. Cold and cool the bandage aroma was apparent, warm, it faded into the background behind the clove. Glad it wasn't a total fall, but much lower than the other 3 beer camp performances. Maybe I'll try another bottle..","dragonWhale","May 09, 2011"
3.53,-11.5,4.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Pours a VERY murky, unfiltered golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very yeasty with some strong clove and banana aromas. Also a bit of floral as well as earthy notes reach my nostrils. Taste is very yeasty, with nice balance of green apples, banana, spices, and light citrus. A little overly sweet for my liking though. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied, almost thick, yet refreshing. Drinkability is fairly high, as if it were less sweet, it would be a much better beer. Overall, not a bad weizenbock. Not even close to being my favorite style, but not bad for what it is.","DovaliHops","May 09, 2011"
3.97,-0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A little dry and thin to be considered among the giants of style. Kudos to the effort.","BretSikkink","May 09, 2011"
3.85,-3.5,4,4,4,2.5,4,"Pours a classic milky, dark golden orange with a frothy cap. Nose hints you in the face with clove and coriander followed by sweet spicy yeast notes, classic banana and maybe a touch of foreign citrus (kumquat yuzu?). Taste brings more of the same along with some a bit of pepper and cinnamon. It does finish a bit dry and astrigent and that would be my only knock against it - it doesnt leave my palate refreshed and ready for more. Very nice beer overall for the style.","Trilogy31","May 09, 2011"
4.03,1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Weizenbocks are one of those styles that I like, but only in small doses. This beer is no exception, as I enjoy it, but would not want to have another this evening. I bought this as part of SN's Beer Camp mixed 12 pack. I'm looking forward to see how the other offerings taste.","TheHoppiest","May 09, 2011"

4.39,10,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"IMO, the best of the beer camp mixed pack. A rough pour rustled up a thick foamy head that left plenty of lacing in the glass. Mega cloudy with a deep yellow color with orange highlights. Insane hefeweizen yeast aroma that had a nice balance of banana like esters and pleasantly smoky band aid phenols which also presented a melange of tropical fruit, floral, and even a bit of a soapy (like kid's bubbles) background. Balanced yeast flavor carried over into the flavor making it somewhat similar to a sweet apple pie. A little sweet and thick to the palate, but not enough to become too cloying. Only critique I have of this beer as that it needs more hop character to give a bit more dimension and drinkability - a bit more bitterness and just a little hop flavor would put this into another tier of its own.","Longstaff","May 08, 2011"

4.5,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beatiful clouded banana smoothie hue with a bright slightly off white head forming thick with creamy textured head. Fine speckled lacing with chunks mixed in the pattern. Labeled as The Best of Beer Camp: Weizenbock #37. Aroma has sharp wheat with banana bread and citrus notes arising strong. Flavor is everything I enjoy about kellerweiss with a bit more punch to it. Sharp citrus/wheat combonation with hints of spicy yeast/banana/clove esters coming forth this is a very satisfying wheat beer, I had not idea that Sierra Nevada were actually wheat beer pros that hid behind the the Sierra Nevada Wheat with the red label for years, which was a dull American Wheat without any yeast fireworks from the German versions. Mouthfeel is satisfyingly carbonated with enough texture and girth the keep any craft beer drinker happy, a touch of alcohol in the back end but it's well orchestrated within the context of different flavors offered from this beer. Overall damn quality Weizenbock that I wish more craftbrewers would perfect like this.","WVbeergeek","0"
3.61,-9.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability- Not the most complex beer in the world but it’s decent. A tinge too sweet for my liking but I’d never guess this beer was almost 7%. Maybe a bit more yeast spiciness would add something else to kick it up a notch. Decent but not my favorite.","younger35","May 07, 2011"
4.5,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is great, nice and spicy with mild spices, strong banana and clove flavors and an unreal bubblegum flavor. This is by far the strongest ""original bubblegum"" flavored beer I have ever had and i would say this is the best beer in the mixed Beer camp package. There is a medium to thicker body for a weizenbock which is really done well. I would get this year round if they were to offer it.","alpinebryant","May 07, 2011"
4.1,2.8,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A little too sweet for me,nonetheless it is very pleasant esp for hot and/or humid summer days and nights. A little more complexity and maltiness would help restrain the sweetness and balance it out.","happy4hoppybeer","May 07, 2011"
3.8,-4.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"O - I like the big, bold smell and flavor. It's a little too big to be a thirst quencher but if you like a strong wheat beer taste, this is good stuff.","Tucquan","May 06, 2011"

3.85,-3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Found this on draft at Bukowski's Back Bay. Served in a pint glass. Bright yellow color, with a haziness to it not unlike a hefeweizen. Thin white head. Well carbonated. Smelled a lot like fresh squeezed lemons and coriander. Taste was excellent. Flavors of grass, citrus, and wheat shone through. Very easy beer to drink. High abv was noted, but since it was such a light and smooth beer, I didn't care. I'd love to see this bottled for summertime. A great new offering from SN.","morebeergood","Jan 23, 2009"

4.35,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly hazy, darkened golden in color beneath a creamy white head. Stable ringed lacing throughout until the last sip. Clean, strong banana esters with notes of mild tropical fruit. Semi-sweet, creamy malt with hints of vanilla. The bright banana and melon esters are rounded and clean. Clean clove spice that leads to a smooth finish. Medium bodied; smooth and rounded, which matched the flavors perfectly. I'm a sucker for a Weizenbock anyway, and this one doesn't miss the mark at all. Pronounced flavors, balanced alcohol, and smooth texture.","NEhophead","Jan 13, 2009"

4.17,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an awesome pale and wheat malt scent along with a monster banana and clove aroma. It has a large malt aroma with just a hint of hops. The taste is good. It has a super smooth malt flavor that goes down with ease and finishes with a really nice yeastiness. It appears quite simple, but it's not lacking in flavor. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a medium/full bodied beer with perfect carbonation. This is one of the easiest drinking weizenbocks I've ever had. It hides the warmth well and is so damn smooth.","WesWes","Beers"
