A very admirable effort though, and the rarity of the style in this neck of the woods means that this is one of the better Weizenbocks available.","ryan1788a5","Jan 14, 2013"
3.88,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is malty all the way. Was a bit toasty, with hints of nuttiness, plus a touch of cookie dough. I also picked up flavors akin to brown bread. Everything got better as the bier warmed. Pretty good, all in all. Zum Wohl!!","Bierman9","Dec 29, 2012"

3.5,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out as a deep reddish brown color with a tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer had a decent amount of malts on the nose, there is also an earthy lager yeast aroma as well. The taste of the beer is nicely balanced between the malts and the bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Overall it is a decent Bock to try. It's not something I would buy a whole case of it though.","Knapp85","May 24, 2012"
3.96,3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Hopefully I'll like this offering more than most of the others form this brewery in the ""D".Poured into a weizen glass a rich deep burnt orange infused amber with a sticky one finger off white head that settles nicely into a frothy mass leaving one big sheet of lace.Some green apple and bubble gum notes in the,not real assertive but not bad.A full rich feel to the beer adds to the drinkability,some dark fruit,banana/clove like yeasty notes,sweet alcohol,and caramel toffee on the palate.The best beer from AB to date for me,it's big but still quite drinkable,nice job here.","oberon","Apr 28, 2012"
3.75,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Copper brown in colour, with an offwhite head. Some lacing and only a little retention. Nose has some dark malts, grains and a light caramel sweetness. Perhaps only a bit of banana. Flavour has wheat, sweet dark malts notes, caramel and a bit of banana and bread. Medium body and medium high carbonation. Decent flavour but not something that stands out to me.","liamt07","Jan 26, 2012"

3.7,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a medium brown color with slight bubbles of carbonation rising to the top, however there is not much of a head to this beer. Has an overall nutty scent with some scent of wheats. The first taste that hits you is the nutty flavor mixed with biscuit. It's a smooth, refreshing, bold taste that finishes clean and dry. Decent brew but leaves a chalky after taste that I don't care for too much.","Lemke10","Sep 25, 2011"

3.5,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is amber and reddish brown with a creamy white head. It dissipates quickly and left little lacing. The nose is full of caramel, biscuit, honey, and earth. Teufel has a few hops present, and adds a bit of nuttiness. I also pick up some apple notes. Medium body and medium carbonation. Dry finish and some late alcohol warmth noted. This is a good beer, not great. Alcohol is subdued considering its 10.9% ABV.","gnemesis","Mar 24, 2011"
4.47,17,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I am really impressed by this brew. I am traditionally not a fan of bocks (of any kind) but this one really seems to hit the spot. More please!","Lauthaha","Mar 11, 2011"
1.61,-57.9,3.5,2.5,1,2,1,"Was really hoping to have a better offering from Atwater, seeing as I had to dump the last beer I had from them (Double Down Ale). Poured a nice colour, leaving a tall, light tan head. Don't recall much lacing, but wasn't exactly looking at any point. Smelled like bread, yeast, and small hints of nuts. The taste reminded me of eating 2 week old cabbage once on accident. I dumped the beer again. I liked the Voodoo Vator, but haven't had anything else that was all that good, or even drinkable from them. Too bad, because I can actually see the place almost from my front porch. I guess they're just not my thing.","PatPower","Jan 24, 2011"
2.96,-22.5,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Don't really care for this one. I should have grabbed a single. Not a very good Weizenbock. Moonglow, Aventinus, and Glockenspiel are MUCH better.","Mitchster","Oct 07, 2010"
4.12,7.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Teufel Bock pours a rich brown color with a light khaki colored head. Nose is full of sweet and bready malts. In the taste, dark lager flavors, caramel, toast and a mild fruityness. Balance is sweetish, with a citric hop presence. Some alcohol is noticable but not detracting. Mouthfeel is full bodied and drinkability is good, totally did not know the beer was nearly 11%ABV! Drinks like a bock half that strength, reall smooth. An overall nice beer from Atwater.","Stinkypuss","Aug 15, 2010"

4.12,7.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D- Well hidden alcohol goes to your head if you aren't careful. Good example of the style. I would drink it again (more likely in cooler, fall weather). As I finished the bottle, it became a nice pairing for a moderately flavored gouda.","GRPunk","Feb 06, 2010"
3.93,2.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"I've never been a big fan of Atwater. This is by far their best offering as far as I'm concerned. Grab this one if you get the opportunity, you won't be dissapointed.","AdamGarcia","Feb 05, 2010"
3.4,-11,4,4,3.5,3,2.5,"Certainly it's an interesting beer, and worth trying. It reminds me more of a Chimay blue driving a hotrod than a malty German dunkelweizen, but as a big dark on its own it's pretty good. The drinkability is a bit low for me because of the alcohol heat and the sweetness.","brc","Feb 01, 2010"

I've had a few other ""weizen dopplebocks"" and this is probably the best of the ones I have sampled. This one is also a very big beer at 10.9%...the ABV is detectable but drinks more like a 8-9% beer.","PittBeerGirl","0"
