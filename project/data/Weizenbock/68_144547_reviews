"Good stuff all around here, paired very well with the Otterbein's Sugar Cookie."

"O:  By far, the best of the Holiday Collection.  I might even buy this as a regular release.  It is quite unique for a Hefeweizen.  The Imperial nature of it gives it a bit of sweetness that really goes well with the yeasty nature of it."

"Overall I prefer this hefeweizen to all the others I have currently sampled. It's bigger, bolder, and more flavorful than the traditional hefeweizen. If that is what they were going for them I think they nailed it."

"I'm on the fence with this beer. Its pretty good, but not quite sure what the point is to amp up the alcohol level.  I guess its like a Hefeweizen malt liquor for an analogy.  Worth a sampling, but not something I'd seek out again."
