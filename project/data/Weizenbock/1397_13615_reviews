"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some spices. Taste is malty, bready, alcohol is present, a bit of mild spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"O: For me there is no redeeming quality in this beer. It is cold for once in Florida and I should have gotten Old Rasputin. Tried something new and immediately regret it. This is an awful beer."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy beige head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with caramel/toffee and apple aromas. Taste is much the same and like others have mentioned there is an apple cider flavor in this one. There is a slight bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a medium body with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a decent beer for what it is but not something I would get again."

"Not the best Weizenbock experience out there, not by a long shot. I guess bombers for $3.99 are too good a thing to be true, unless they're totally local, and this one definitely is not. Oh well."
"Nose is pleasant enough, although a fairly tame combo of caramel, tangy wheat and whiffs of raisin. Tastes more or less as advertised, but with more oomph, thanks in no small part to a nice fluffy feel. Small-bubbled carbonation is right on target. Modest spicy and banana bread notes in the finish. Not bad at all, but a fairly pedestrian take on the style."
"NICE, NOT MUST HAVE!"

"yum yum"
" Overall, I think its a good value. So I think I will get this one again."
"Pours a slightly hazy coppery brown with a thick, fluffy, off-white head. Malty aroma has strong yeasty, molasses and caramel notes and is a bit sweet. Flavor has a sweet caramel overtone and a malty core with hints of apple and molasses and just a touch of cloves. Body is about average, and texture is smooth and fairly fizzy, leaving a tingly and somewhat complex finish."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a snifter, I get a dark copper body with a deep haziness and a small head that settles to a collar. Aromas are predominantly of prunes and plumbs, with notes of sweet wheat and something reminiscent of bread pudding. The taste is initially sweet, with raisins and a bit of brown sugar, buts quickly gives way to increasingly bitter notes, first of toastiness and then of wood and leafiness. It doesn't finish as well as it starts, and leaves me with the taste of burnt biscuits. The body is quite full and carbonated in a way that lends an appropriate austerity to its complicated flavor and gives a smoothness to what would otherwise be a mostly astringent beer. I love the texture and think that the flavor is good for the most part, and ultimately hope this beer is improved in the batches to come."
"O- Overall, this is a decent Weizenbock but not something I would purchase again."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber to brown with CHUNKS of yeast dancing around. Nose has a fresh bready/toasty aroma, and some holiday spice cake. Palate has plenty of carbonation, tangy interplay oif toasty malt and sourness. Wheat is clearly noted too. Finish has some warmth."
"D: A good drinker (inhibited by its strength)."
"D - One and done. Not a beer I would go out of my way to recommend. Not a terrible beer by any means, but certainly no where close to other Weizenbocks out there. If you are into hoppy ambers, check this one out. But dont feel bad if you pass on by."
"It's weird enough to be interesting to a degree, but the yeast flavors and their oxidized notes tear it apart."
"Though brewed as a lager, the Bock expresses greater flavor upon warming when a substantial influx of malt sweetness and noble hop spice step forward. Not an everyday beer, but that's by design."
"All in all, an unusual, tasty, and very drinkable beer. And it was inexpensive, to boot. Should have bought more."
"Yum. Pretty good weizenbock here: fruity yeast esters bring notes of pear and pineapple while the hop finish is slightly citric. A bit too hoppy for the style, but it works. Some alcohol heat is detected in the finish as well. The creamy, full-body is smooth and has a spot-on carbonation level. Overall, a drinkable Weizenbock, especially at 8% ABV. I would probably have this again given the proper circumstances."
"Drinkability: So-so as far as weizenbocks or even beers in general go!"
"Average drinkability on this one. The taste is a bit unusual, strong and for me not real pleasing. It's not a very sessionable ale. I'm not much on the style, and some people might well like this brew. I can drink it, but it's not my pint of ale."
"Sinkability  Im not really sure what this is, but I sure as hell am not going to finish it."
