Yet, and even though I'm a huge fan of spicy stuff, I think that this kind of spice doesn't go well at all with any kind of beer. The best thing I can recall from that night was that I couldn't even end this beer because of how strong was the presence of the spice - not that is was strong, but only that the it was too much quantity for the given amount of beer.

Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, wheat, clove, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, wheat, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, wheat, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice weizenbock. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

I had to drive deep into New Jersey to find it it. In the end it was well worth the trip. This is the darkest and richest weizenbock I have tried thus far. Aroma of caramelized burnt sugar, vanilla and over ripe bananas. Sweet dark fruit predominates the complex taste with hints of dates, rum, raisins, maple and ripe prunes. As is normal for Erdinger, it is bottle conditioned and very cloudy as a result. There is a very pleasant, lingering aftertaste of pecan pie.

Nothing outrageous or different in the flavor profile; very consistent wheat/malt/yeast flavor of a classic dark weizen, but I REALLY liked that the additional esters and malts did not contribute to any sweet clingy quality, as advertised - the malts taste sweet, but don’t linger or leave a syrupy feel on the palate. Nice yeasty wheat finish. A good, clean, solid offering if you enjoy this style, and a quaffable summer thirst quencher for the malt enthusiast.","fezmeister","Aug 16, 2012"

The beer has an initial flavor of milk chocolate and earthy spices. The flavor is quickly followed up by a cherry flavor, with an overcarbonated feel to it. The beer is sharp and overcarbonated in mouth, and the beer does not have enough body to counterbalance this. The beer has a semisweet and smooth aftertaste, with a last second bite of the carbonated feel. The finish is a little lackluster, with an overall feel of sweet letdown.

A well-balanced chewey medium body with some residual sweetness like bitter cocoa and caramel with hints of bread/grain all over the body. Mixes w/ herbal, citric hops that have a touch of bitterness and the sharp carbonation in this beer leads to some sharpness in the beer, including a sharp, pointed finish.

Head retention is quite good once it reaches a 1.5 inches. Some lacing, but not much in terms of adherence. Nose was light and sweet - dark fruits (plum, raisins, prunes) and perhaps some brown sugar and molasses. Taste follows nose; however, a slightly vinous quality comes out in the mix.

The beer is a dark brown, slightly reddish with a dissipating beige head that leaves a little lacing. The nose is fruity with dark stone fruit combined with ripe bananas. The flavor is actually quite complex, but it isn't bright enough for me as a weizenbock. The feel starts almost excessively fizzy.

Light to medium bodied and not that creamy, but smooth going down nonetheless. The 7.3% ABV was not realy noticeable until I noticed it on the bottle, and started paying attention.

Sweet, vinous and grapey/cidery in the nose, with mild banana, some grassiness, and a touch of alcohol - old and not to style, but not that bad. Similar on the palate, with touches of wheat and dark malts, some esters, and just a hint of oxidation. The light and tingly body thickens slowly and has very little finish.

3.95,2.1,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"This is my first ever weizenbock style beer; I bought the bottle from my dutch beer friend along with a whole lot of other goodies. This beer poured out with a huge head that tops the dark brown beer beneath; the head quickly dissipates leaving a thin layer of foam with some lacing. The smell was bock malty, nice huge malts as expected for a weizenbock some earthy tones and it almost smelled a little salty. The entry to the taste was fairly alcoholic and a little bitter with the malts hiding beneath. These malts then start showing up more and get stronger towards the finish. Clearly I could pick up some spices including cloves and the familiar banana notes evident in many German wheat beers. However the taste was not embracing what I was expecting after getting a really good nose. In particular the alcoholic and bitter part of it was something I prefer without. The after taste had some alcoholic notes in it with some dark fruits (dates?) and a nice slightly sweet bready maltiness which was there to last. The mouthfeel was between medium to full body with a nice creaminess to it and smoothness was there; just as like any of the Erdingers I had. The disappointment was in the taste entry. It was pretty strong though only going at 7.3 ABV; at times I was kind of drinking it like drinking a weizen. I have one more bottle of this; hope it would give me a better experience as I do have really high expectations of this style.. being a big fan of bocks and hefeweizens.","basica","Dec 20, 2007"

Some clove and white pepper are also noted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with weizen effervesence. Body seems to become lighter toward the middle and finish. Taste has prominent dark fruits(figs and raisins), earthy yeast and hop bitterness, wheat wafer, understated bock maltiness notes of caramel and toffee, and banana and clove weizen notes after the yeast is swirled in.

Some flaky particules in suspension. Roasted wheat malt twang, a hint of brown sugar, and faint ripe banana notes in the nose, but rather tame. Malty and rich, with the right amount of wheaty acidity nearer the finish to keep it drinkable. Lively carbonation tickles the palate and keep any sense of sweetness at bay. It is pretty tasty and smooth, but a little one-dimensional in the sense that it is lacking in some of those complex tropical esters that I feel constitute a great weizenbock.","crookedhalo","Feb 18, 2005"

Taste is very good, malty, but not overly so. The malts weren't as strongly caramel tasting as I'd expect in a bock. 7.3% alcohol is not evident at all. Finish may be just a little too abrupt.

Slightly buttery, vaguely grassy... no real nosefeel at all... ! At least it has some good tastes, mostly a sort of quenchy-caramel with candied fruits up front; developing into a apple cidery tartness (with a bit of pear?); and a warm jolt of spice (probably closest to clove). Some buttery hops and a vague herbal quality to finish it off; with warmth, bubblegum comes out in the aftertaste. A spikily carbonated mouthfeel is yet wet and quenching, with a slightly sticky, sour finish. Based on the mouthfeel alone, the drinkability gets pretty high marks; I had no idea this brew was 7.3 abv and it caught up to me pretty fast.

Nutty, toasty Munich w/ a healthy dose of dark caramel and toffee in aroma. Mellow banana esters. Subdued hints of wheat tartness. Snap of sugary bubblegum initially in flavor is ceded by notes of carob and pseudofruity melanoidins. Wheat makes a token presence by a grainy tartness mid palate along with light clove. Sweetness is persistantly toffeeish and caramelized in nature, and is unfortunately let down by the thin, overly attenuated lack of body. Relatively clean esterwise. Finishes with an overly brief impression of chocolate and banana, but otherwise dry and simply sweet. Pikantus is an odd brew. It falls a bit short of combining the robust malt character of a bock and the quirky esters of a hefeweizen. Tame. It remains quite tasty and highly drinkable, nevertheless.","marc77","Feb 12, 2003"

Nose is weak with aromas of sweet roasted malts and grains and a hint of dark fruit. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a great deal of carbonation. Taste is sweet malts, dark fruit, light chocolate, and a touch of ripe banana. Alcohol becomes more noticeable as the beer warms a bit. Finish is dry. All in all, a complex and enjoyable brew.","Morris729","Jan 24, 2003"
3.98,2.8,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I would recommend Erdinger Pikantus but it is not on par with Aventinus (but what is?). Enjoy one on a cold winter day!","bditty187","Jan 08, 2003"
4.45,15,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Deep brown with ruby highlights and a creamy light tan head that rises out of the glass at first, but then cannot hold. Still, it does leave some lace. The aroma is of a rich malt that has a strong cocoa character and light toffee notes, soft dark fruit, some mild bubblegum and a gentle clove. It's surprisingly rich for a dunkle as they tend to offer less yeasty character... although this is a bock as well. The body is medium, and the mouthfeel starts with a zesty tingle on the tongue from a fine & effervescent carbonation. As it warms in the mouth and the CO2 is released, a soft creaminess takes over. The flavor is softly fruity, mildly tangy, and lightly chocolatey up-front, warming into more toffee-ish notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing with light phenolics and a clove-like spiciness. The alcohol is completely hidden. This is obviously balanced towards maltiness, but the alcohol and dark malts keep it dryer than a standard weizen. Exceptionally well done and highly drinkable.","NeroFiddled","Dec 14, 2002"
3.33,-14,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Deep garnet to translucent brown in color, head is modest in size, the texture frothy, beige in color with nice sheets of lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt dominated, lightly fruit sweet, hints of caramel, but picked up some medicinal tones? Sweet start, middling mouth feel, moderate on the carbonation, the hops sparse at first, but pick up a bit as it adjusts in temperature, dry aftertaste. Relatively big ABV at 7.3 percent, and I did expect more from this beer than it delivered. Why? You might ask, frankly I dont know, another mystery to be solved by sampling again.","Gusler","Dec 04, 2002"
3.8,-1.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Nice medium dark cocolate color. Foam nice and tight but didn't last long. Malty flavor with a very little complex of flavors leading with a raisin taste. Good for introducting people to a mellow brew. This beer was smooooth in the after taste!","BeerManDan","Sep 02, 2002"
3.95,2.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Notes: This is one big bad wheat beer, not bad but could be too big for some. Huge, effervescent and bursting all over with perplexing complexities.","Jason","Aug 25, 2002"
4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy dark brown, rich foamy beige head. Not much noticable smell wise, some faint maltiness. Taste was appropriately malty, but a bit thin on everything else. Lots of roasted syrupy fruit tastes in the middle, raisans, plums, bit of spice. Doesn't quite met the expectations. Light bodied, and not near as flavorful as Aventinius, but still a very balanced, rich, creamy Weissbock. I liked the Erdinger Dunkel I had last night better, it was actually had more body and better flavor.","StevieW","Aug 25, 2002"
4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy dark brown. Nice tan head, minimal lacing. Good looking brew in a tall weizenbier glass. Big dark roasted wheat grain, malt aroma. Some earthy yeast and a mere suggestion of esters are also noted. Initial taste is roasted bitterness. Smooths, mellows and sweetens as it warms. This is a very good weizenbock.","John","Aug 15, 2002"

3.68,-4.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Very thick off-white head that took a long time to dissipate.  Nice dark ruby color with a faint fruity odor.  Good lacing after the first drink which had a decent malty sweet flavor that a weizen bock should have.","ryanocerus","Jul 10, 2002"
3.22,-16.8,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"when it comes to weizenbocks there is simply no better than aventinus, this doesn't come close, the alchol is too evident, and its a bit thin.","rastaman","Apr 05, 2002"
