Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish orange color with a small foamy 1 finger off white head with decent retention that reduces to a ring of lace pretty quickly. No glass lacing. Aromas of big caramel covered bananas, biscuit, molasses, light orange zest, spices, and a bit of alcohol to round it out. Some excellent aromas here, very inviting. Taste of big banana, caramel, pepper, biscuit, clove, and molasses. No bitterness on the finish; but there is some lingering notes of caramel, banana, bread, molasses, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel that drinks easily. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and delicious Weizenbock at almost 2 years past freshness date. I wonder if they will ever bottle it again.","superspak","Nov 14, 2011"

3.9,-3.5,4,4,4,3,4,"Great Lakes continues to impress with their awesome beverages. The Glockenspiel is noe exception. The beer pours a dark copper with burnt orange highlights. No real head of which to speak, just some thin wisps on top & a small ring around the perimeter. Marginal lacing at best. The smell includes sweet nose with just a bit of tartness. Light fruit notes - banana & apple. Hints of clove. The taste exhibits more tartness than in the nose; almost sour with banana & orange tones. The mouthfeel is a bit downgraded due to the heacy ABV. The body is heavy Overall it's drinkable, but nothing about it screams exceptional by any means. Worth a shot, but I'm no hurry for another.","WoodBrew","Jul 07, 2011"

A very Belgian like flavor, witha good amount of light fruit like yeast and hints of pears and apples mixed in among the various grain like flavors. Blended very well with no trace at all of the alcohol inside. This was so amply carbonated I do not even know where t begin. Just a great light feel and smooth, crisp, clean finish.

After the 1st taste, I'm waiting for something else to happen, but it doesn't. Heavy wine notes, both in taste and mouthfeel - virtually no aftertaste. Light, sparkling-wine like effervescence. Virtually no hops (or clean malt barley) notes to speak of. Wheat is up-front, but generally this tastes like a mediocre ice beer. Very one-dimensional, and almost seems like a crafty way to get rid of (expensively, mind you) bottom-of-the-barrel hefeweizen. I didn't like it at all.

Expect a proper full bodied weizenbock here, and not a pale version as many have become accustomed to due to the rising popularity of Vitus and Ayinger, which they deserve as they are great, but this is not the same style of beer. I like that about it though, and i like the fact that it actually displays some imperial characteristics. A fine libation, and one i would be happy to imbibe pretty regularly when looking for a nice sweet wheat beer without going all wheatwine on my liver. A good representation of the style for sure.","AKBelgianBeast","Jan 26, 2010"

Strong cloudiness helps it hold light and deepen the glow in the amber red, orange rust colored liquid, holds richness through the rims. The nose is quite sweet, yet openly knit enought to not become too much so, clove, ginger, nutmeg in action, honeyed mandarin oranges, corn syrup, esters, banana to dried apricot fruit, fruit cake, nothing that briskly penetrating or sharp-edged, dries out well as it lifts and dissolves. Medium-bodied, fairly tight carbonation gives it more density than foaminess. same sort of raisin bread, banana, apricot, peach thing going on, sweet oranges, cloves and a moment of honeyed ham, oatmeal. More chocolate and caramel than found in the nose. Sweet enough to be smooth but there's also some grit to the texture which holds your attention.

As the beer warmed, the alcohol becomes more pronounced (not surprising at 8% ABV). In addition an astringency began to seep into the flavor, an astringency that was not at all unpleasant This is a very drinkable beer for one of such a robust alcohol level.

The color of this beer is extraordinary! The banana is very present and one of the overwhelming traits of this beer...which is not a bad thing. At 8% ABV, you can tell the alcohol is there.

Colors of the body include dark copper, plum and golden edges. Aromas are huge out of the pour, with clove and ripe banana as promised on the label. Tastes are similar, with an emphasis on the ripe banana. This is a tasty brew, though it's a bit hot. With time and warmth, a tart fruitiness comes out, which is a nice addition. Mouthfeel includes a lighter body than I'd like, with mild carbonation. I am a fan of this beer, but it's hard to love a weizenbock after you've had Aventinus and Vitus!

It's nice and pretty good for the style. The taste reveals none of the 8% alc. Instead it's wheaty and flavorful without being overpowering. I'm not usually a fan of wheat beers but this is pretty good. The mouthfeel just feels right. It's smooth and extremely drinkable, almost a session beer except for the alcohol it contains.

A traditional weizenbock - that is, if you can call any example of the style "traditional" given how broad the stylistic definition is - that falls more towards the roastier, fruitier end of the spectrum, this one's definitely one I could see keeping in my fridge.

This is a very nice weizenbock overall. It's smooth and tart at the same time. Banana is smooth and permeates all aspects of this beer. I'd really like to see this make it into a bottle as a regular seasonal offering. Easily recommended.","csmiley","Oct 17, 2008"

4.12,2,3,3.5,4,5,5,"Drinkability: Another area in which this beer excels. Many wheat beers are light and airy but this one is bready and creamy. With the alcohol not cloying, this is a definite winner. Try it, you'll like it.","Risser09","Oct 05, 2007"

4.02,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy deep amber brown cinnamon color matched with a dark tan cream head leaves evenly spread lacing throughout my pint. Aroma: Wonderful doughy spice base, which I found a bit weird but it worked well somehow. Apple, over ripened banana, and raisin notes with a slightly alcoholic nose very nice mix all around. Taste: Ripened banana, apple, and raisin really swarm the ol' palate along with a spicy finish with a noticeable kiss of alcohol. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied low even carbonation not as fine and somewhat spritzy as an Aventinus. Drinkability: Decent shot at a weizenbock not dead on to the style but very good and shows some more depth from this great brewery.","WVbeergeek","0"
