"Crisp, bright, very clean taste. Fresh. Summery, despite the malty dark fruit flavours."

"This holds no water to the German leading weizens. A lot of banana and boozey sweetness and not a lot else really, some spicy phenolics and caramel sugar notes but at the end of the day its not balanced and that really detracts from really getting into it, theres potential to really develop some complexity but its really unrelenting and never lets the nuance develop. If this were my first weizen, the response would be 'interesting idea, but not something to try more of...'"
"A Mill St. seasonal that has to be purchased as part of a mixed pack, this weizenbock looks alright poured into a classic German weizen glass, a murky medium brown color with a reasonable amount of tan head. Smells like the expected banana and clove yeast-derived special effects, rather aggressively so, particularly with regards to the banana. I also get another stream of yeasty funk, almost like old leather, and a bright fruity note like red apples. Taste is banana-forward, sweet, rich, and malty, with none of the green/under-aged, woody, hot alcohol flavors I recently got in another domestically brewed weizenbock (see my review of Granville Island's Burly Goat for the sordid details). I get some intriguing chocolate malt flavors that couple with the almost cloying sweet ripe banana to yield a chocolate chip banana bread effect, raisin butter tart, dried plums, and a wheaty white pepper and coriander spice. Semi-thick body with a rather smooth and undercarbonated mouthfeel, with a fruity and spicy wet finish that includes some toasted crust and raisin notes. A fruity and sweet malty rather than super-spicy weizenbock with well-rounded corners ... Sinuous and supple, with no obnoxious traits even if it fails to perfectly capture the German spicy wheat and aggressive phenol profile."

"Final Thoughts: All in all, a serviceable Weizenbock. I'm probably not being very charitable as Weihenstephaner Vitus is the only other beer of this style I've tried and it blows this stuff out of the water. However there is very little to complain about other then the carbonation is odd really. Give it a whirl."

"Overall, an enjoyable beer but not something I'd particularly reach for again - the taste is just a bit too one dimensional for me. I'm overall becoming quite a fan of Mill St. though, this being the 4th beer I've tried from them."

"A decent, big-boy weizenbock, if perhaps one that relies a bit too much on the banana/yeast sledgehammer, rather than a more subtle touch to get its point across. Overall, worthy of a go, for its warming nature, as well as the unexpected holiday essences hidden within."

"Part of the Winter 13 mixed pack. nice banana on the nose , quite a dark shade of brown . On the sweetish side this is a decent Weizenbock with a real dry finish after the sweet first note. Not really yeasty enough for me but I still like where Mill st is going with this beer. Satisfying beer for the winter months."

"Final Grade: 3.76, a well-earned B+. Mill Street's Weizenbock is a serviceable example of the style, though it really can't hold a candle to the German imports. The yeastiness is there, but the wheat malts simply lack the same aggressiveness and complexity of the paragons of this style. I'd get this again if the price was right, and it makes for a somewhat memorable conclusion to this season's new sampler pack. As an addendum, I am psyched that they opted to exclude the Stock Ale and include another seasonal in its place. The Organic Lager does the same job better anyway - variety is the spice of life!"

"Overall - Nice beer, but would rather have some of their other offerings and there are definitely better Weizenbocks out there. Nonetheless a good effort."

"Which has come in no small part because of their willingness (and ability) to offer more integral, less common and, frankly, much more interesting beers than its competitors. This weizenbock, albeit not the pinnacle of the style, is indisputably well-made and well worth drinking. I can't wait to fill this growler with other quality Mill Street brew!"
"A very solid weizenbock. A bit more depth and richness to the flavour would be more down my alley, but this is a great stab at the style from a local brewer. Nice work, Joel!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable but a little too sweet for me I think. Like a poor mans Aventinus which is a compliment."
