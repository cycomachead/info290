"Feel: medium body with medium soft carbonation."

"Overall, though drinks well with a bit of an interesting fun angle.  Decent and enjoyable, I would have this again."

"OK, but probably not worth the price.  Itâ€™s pretty much like a chocolate porter."

"Also, when I poured out the rest of the bottle, I noticed a lot of sediment and large chunks of something. Maybe it's orange peel? Perhaps, I just got a bad bottle and this contributed to my meh attitude towards this beer."

"Overall: a so-so weizenbock. Decent flavor but just a bit too sweet."
"Mouthfeel is thin, but balanced. Carbonation lingers in your mouth, but overall, not bad. Just average."

"O - I was a little doubtful as the Weizenbock is not in my top 10 styles, but adding Orange is an awesome twist with a side of sugar"

"O: A unique but weird beer that veers too far from the weizenbock style for me. The citrus is too strong and overpowers the basic elements of the style. The chocolate is a nice touch and alone would probably work pretty well with the style (who doesn't like chocolate banana bread). This beer has some potential but needs to leave out the citrus."

"O - Nothing to go bat crazy about. It's almost like lets throw some stuff at a weizenbock and see what sticks."
"Pours into my weizenbock glass a deep murky chestnut brown with a thick creamy light beige head atop that left a frothy mass as it settles slowly.Some brown sugar and banana in the nose but nothing that makes you say wow,a bit of roasted chocolate beans is there as well.The chocolate plays a big role on the palate and it goes well with some of the spiced phenols ,the orange comes into play late giving a juicy finish,as I drink more it stands out more.This beer is pretty cool with it's different flavors,do I like it?Yeah I do but it's different....in a good way."

"Really unique beer. Maybe a little too much carbonation which creates a foamy mouthfeel, but that about the only negative for me. Lots of banana and orange, chocolate up front. I'd say banana is the second flavor you get and orange appears in the middle and finishes stronger. I'll definitely try to get some more of this one before its gone. One of a kind beer."
""
"Overall: Reminds me a lot of a cellared Terrapin Gamma Ray. AKA: bananas foster in beer form, but with a touch of coco and orange on the front end."

"This beer really deserves some props. Very unique. The name is inviting and it delivers! The chocolate is quite prevalent with mostly dark chocolate notes. The orange is on the back and smoothes over the beer nicely with a great aftertaste. Easy to take a bomber to the head. One of my favorites by Terrapin, fantastic job!"
