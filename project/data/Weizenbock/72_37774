AROMA: a very pleasant combination of hop aromas (floral and pine) with wheat, bock-like notes (dried fruits) and vanilla phenols. APPEARANCE: amber color and hazy. medium moussy, slight ivory head with average retention. TASTE: a very rich combination of bock components (bread, vanilla), some dark fruits, with a wheat background and hop flavours (citrusy and floral). low bitterness with a somewhat dry finish, some alcohol warmth. PALATE: medium-full body with moderate carbonation. some alcohol sensation. OVERALL: a very good weizen bock with a floral hop twist.","titvs","Beers"

The nose screams fruit, particularly banana and berries, along with citrus and malt. As you would expect, the fruit hits your tongue first. Bananas, pineapple, mango and some spice. The alcohol becomes more pronounced as it warms. There's a nice sweetness to this one. Medium, chewy mouth. I'm not a huge fan of wheats or dopplebocks, but this is really, really good.

3.8,-6.9,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Obtained bottle from Willow Park liquor store in Calgary. Pours a dark peach amber color with ample white head. Aroma sweet and spicy, reminiscent of baked apple, banana bread, pineapple juice, caramel, honey, and sharp spice, almost like caraway when one factors in the bread and yeast. Smells like a hefeweizen with added fruit and spice. Flavor is complex and includes the expected banana and clove elements but also darker, sweeter malts. This beer is dry-hopped with German designer hop Saphir which adds strawberry sweet fruity notes to the classic German wheat yeasty esters. Malty and fruity, with strawberry and raspberry notes blending with raisin and date flavors from the dark malts. Loads of unripe pineapple that builds over time. Fairly heavy sweet palate gives way to bitter hops and green fruit in the finish. The total package works, maybe sweeter than advertised. More of a weizenbock with unique hop elements than a true fusion of styles.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 19, 2013"

Cloudy amber-orange pour with nice two finger fluffy white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is pretty amazing with all the typical Weizenbock character, but with some really nice citrus notes as well. Hints of grapefruit, clove, coriander, tangerine, banana, pear, and white pepper. The taste is even bolder and really complex with a great sweet caramel maltiness that nicely complements the hops. Very fruity and spicy with hints of apple, banana, lemon, apricot, grapefruit, coriander, and cloves. The mouthfeel is crisp and tart and hugely refreshing, but creamy at the same time. The balance is perfect and the drinkability is over the top! Overall, this is an amazingly unique beer that marries the best of an IPA and a Weizen! This is definitely the beer I will miss the most when I leave Germany. The perfect everyday summer beer that also tastes great anytime of the year. Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Apr 02, 2013"

3.95,-3.2,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"an unlikely collaboration, and a beer I really enjoyed. this pours cloudy pale brass color with a good two inch white head. the nose is really hoppy. so many hopfen beers just pay lip service to it, but this one is super hoppy in terms aroma. there is fruity hops, almost citra, but apparently some hallertau variety is used. its more hoppy than almost any other german thing ive had, and I love it. there is also a lot of heavier wheat malt and alcohol taste to this, as well as a very dry finish that is fruity and bitter from these hops. the is entirely unlike any weizenbock ive had out there, and one that I will be coming back to. its a little filling, and the alcohol can get you going pretty quick, but the flavors are fantastic and the mouthfeel works for what it is. really good carbonation on such a full bodied beer is a nice change of pace. overall the highlight of this beer for me is the hop complexion, its big and bold and unique, especially for the style. the is exceptionally well done.","StonedTrippin","Mar 26, 2013"

It’s enjoyable and drinkable, for sure, but not exactly what I was seeking. I would definitely be interested in trying this fresh-fresh or on tap.","fmccormi","Nov 11, 2012"

3.78,-7.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, bottled 9/27/2011. Pours super hazy dark red orange color with a nice 2-3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass; with plenty of carbonation streaming up as expected. Aromas of big sweet lemon zest, orange peel, bubblegum, biscuit, tropical fruits, wheat, banana, coriander, herbal, light pepper, and light caramel. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, bubblegum, wheat, biscuit, caramel, banana, clove, light pepper, herbal, and tropical fruit. Lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pepper, biscuit, herbal, bubblegum, and tangy wheat on the finish for a good bit. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Slightly cloying sweetness on the finish, but not too bad. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish; and this is very smooth to drink. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable weizenbock. It is definitely the fruitiest wheat beer I have come across; but has a fair amount of spiciness to balance it out in the taste.","superspak","Mar 29, 2012"

There's also a bitter/sour aftertaste that sticks to the back of your throat for what seems to be an eternity. I'm now getting a lemon house cleaner taste from this.. Not sure what they're going for here. Feel is bitter/sour and highly carbonated. Overall, I feel like I'm drinking a bottle of pledge. The lemon cleaner taste is just too over the top.

The flavor is likewise a complex combination of earthy and floral hops, yeast, a wheaty tanginess, and a light, dry fruitiness. The fine, light carbonation keeps this potent combination of flavors from being too overwhelming.

There is a nice hop presence but, being more of a milder and less pungent hop, it adds more of a nice flowery bouquet. Palate is big, silky and creamy, with a biscuity core surrounded by rich citrus, vanilla and caramel flavors. Once again, hoppy but not overly bitter or pungent. The midpalate has a bit of peppery alcohol which lead back to a slightly tart, biscuity citrus blossom finish. Overall, very nice with good balance and a rich caramelly edge to the fruity aromas.","TheWhiskerReview","0"

I poured carefully but had to leave a good two inches of beer in the bottle to avoid pouring out even more yeast. Aroma of sweet malts and grains with a floral hop character - quite planty. The flavor is very sweet - some bready malts and caramel but lots of sweet cherry to the point of being slightly cloying. Some floral hop character. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but again I thought it was way too sweet. It does cover up the high ABV though.

There is a nice hop bite, a little off balanced but full weizenbock characteristics come through with the banana, caramel, clove and a touch of alcohol.

In fact the one 12oz pour that I had tonight was enough for me to decided that I should head home from the bar early and stick with some low abv beers for the rest of the night.","Lars3","Jun 27, 2010"
4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. It was served in my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res' Schneider event. The beer is generally golden orange in color, but it turns to yellow at the edges of the glass. The head is pure white foam, but it is rather small. The liquid is fully opaque. The aroma is a good combination of sweet wheat and lemon citrus hops. The flavor is superb--the hoppy finish real caught me by surprise, even though I knew it was coming. There is a lot of wheat up front, but as soon as you swallow you get a mouthful of bitterness. It is very well-balanced and extremely tasty. It has a light body and medium carbonation. There is a slight coat, but it disappears quickly. Overall, it is very drinkable. It is a bit too strong to be sessionable, but it is certainly worth the effort to seek out and enjoy over a round or two.","ToasterChef","Jun 27, 2010"

4.14,1.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Moderate carbonation, creamy and slightly thicker than I expected. Feels somewhat chewy, perhaps just because of the lighter mouthfeel of the style. This, along with the high ABV hurts its drinkability for me, but this hasn't kept me from picking up a dozen of these for throughout the warmer months ahead. Not exactly a session beer, but an excellent choice when looking for a single pint during the summer.","MattyV","Jun 15, 2010"
3.62,-11.3,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The beer initially pours a translucent burnt orange color in my Duvel tulip, though the second pour with the yeast added in significantly muddies it. The initial 3 finger, slightly rocky, white head is impressive, but head retention is poor and lacing is virtually nonexistent. In terms of traditional characteristics, the nose is all clove with no appreciable banana, but there's also a nice juicy citrus hop presence. The aroma is overall a bit muted though. The taste leads off with a blend of clove and banana that, as the nose would suggest, favors clove heavily. Up next is a brief flash of bitterness, before the beer finishes with the citrus hop notes hinted at in the nose, along with a little bit of alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is suitably light and smooth, but the beer definitely seems a little bit undercarbonated. It's tasty enough to be somewhat drinkable, but the aforementioned alcohol and carbonation issues hold it back a little bit.","axeman9182","Jun 12, 2010"

Gorgeous golden brown, with a thick off-white head, leaving some serious chunky lacing down the side of the glass. Smells is really hoppy and fruity, some pineapple, banana, cloves and passionfruit and just a real genuine sweetness to it. Taste is quite similar too, not at all bitter but again quite sweet and fruity. Has the mouthfeel of a weiss, very smooth and fullbodied, and a definite easy drinker. The alcohol is very well masked, and I could easily pump a few of these back. Just a great offering from Oliver and Drexler in this collab-brew, and I'm gonna a hoard quite a few of these for this summer.","liamt07","Jun 12, 2010"

The finish is pretty intense with more yeast and sour fruit. Medium body, cleansing hoppiness, there was a pine resin quality that made it just a bit rough around the edges, that was my impression. With a few subtle changes, I'd score this a half point higher in all categories.

A nice amount of bitterness. Certainly not an IPA or anything for hop profile, but the hops are a big component of the taste. This blends really well with the taste of a hefe. I get clove, banana, lemon and orange in the flavour. Alcohol is really well hidden. Really nice beer and I'm glad the Control Borad in Ontario got this as part of the summer release.

As most wheat beers, this is chewy, with a light to medium body. Carbonation dances on the tongue. Wheat, yeast and breadiness stimulates the palate throughout the entire sip while the hops hit the back of the tongue at the end. Have been to the Schneiderweisse beer haus a few times in Munich and this one is definitely an odd duck, so to speak.

I am not a Weizenbock expert, but I do enjoy the citrus/wheat profile of this brew minus the dark fruit notes that can sometimes be evident.

It was fairly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a wonderful weizenbock. It had a great hoppy taste, while still remaining true to the style.

The malt provides a light bready sweetness that underlies all of the fruity action in the front of the mouth. A moderate amount of bitterness emerges before the swallow, but the finish is rather smooth. This is an interesting offering, in that the hops are definitely right up front and in your face, yet never particularly bitter or astringent. A unique, thoroughly drinkable beer that offers some surprises and masks its relatively high alcohol content well.","ElGordo","Jul 10, 2009"

The smell is slightly fruity with some grape and yeasty-ness and some hints of malt in there too. The taste was not what I was expecting from the aroma. A big hit of malt starts off the taste and then bitterness takes over with a slightly astringent, drying finish. This is one interesting beer. The bottle says it's a hefeweizen ale, and BA has it listed at a Weizenbock. I'd lean more more towards the weizenbock. Regardless, this is one mighty tasty beer!","curasowa","Jul 10, 2009"

The flavor reminds me quite a bit of creamy banana pudding rimmed with Nilla Wafers. Also there is clove and pepper come through along with a definite tangyness from the wheat malt that underlies the whole flavor profile. Its really striking and I rather like it.

I felt the floral notes and the spice were balanced perfectly and made for a wonderful and amazing brew.

On the other hand, the strong hop profile can become overwhelming by the half way point of the glass; the first few sips were amazing, but I found it more and more difficult to drink as the glass emptied. This hurts its drinkability somewhat. A better idea might be to offer this brew in a 33cl bottle instead of the half litre.

In the nose there's a lemony hop presence, with some phenols, orange, and a bit of pith. It starts really nice, but peters out over time. On the first sip, there is some immediately-detectable heat, followed by some rather sharp, almost piercing spicy flavors consisting of lemon, banana, latex, and spicy yeast, along with a medium hop bitterness. It has a medium body, with crisp, numbing carbonation and some hops in the finish. This beer is all out of balance. The alcohol is waaay too noticeable and the flavors are incredibly sharp.

It's hard to give too high of a score for appearance because it's not astoundingly beautiful and there's little competition readily available, to me anyway. On the other hand, the smell is phenomenal. It has the sweet, spicy and fruity wheat scents of Aventinus combined with citrus hop aroma, which all combined makes for a complex but sunshiney scent. It's a strong scent and the addition of stronger hops is appreciated. The taste is also quite good, although it is so reminiscent of Aventinus that I don't want to give a perfect mark here. The flavor is a unique combination of sweet lemons and subtly spicy wheat. The finish is the dry, clean taste of good hefeweizen. I enjoy the addition of hops, but I could understand another opinion. I'm really not picking up the phenolic characteristics mentioned by some reviewers. I almost feel like I just got a really good bottle of it or something. Perhaps, the recipe has been altered over time. The label is different but definitely the Schneider version.

There were some spices such as coriander and pepper along with hints of dark fruit like black cherries in the smell as well. An intense hop bite with tropical flavors such as banana, orange, lemon and pear (citric flavors too, I know) hit my tongue first as it is a chewy, thick medium body that is smooth and creamy. Must be some fulelr malts in there like dough or something. The pepper and clove spices are on the sides and they balance well, as nothing is overpowering in this beer. A slightly dry, mildly sweet backbite, something akin to sour apples or something with some tartness. Not only is the price great (especially compared to the Brooklyn's version) but with the exceptional alcohol burn on a couple sips they hid the ABV well, and I could session this bad boy.

Complex tastes that hit every area of the tongue in a well-balanced enjoyable brew. There is a little something for everyone in this beer.","JRed","Aug 08, 2008"

Mild carbonation and a slight haze. Hop particles are floating everywhere. This is an unfiltered beer to the core. The taste is a little mediciny at first. Then the hop bite jumps in your mouth followed by the sweet banana and clove taste you expect in a Hefe. I'm not sure why this is classified as a weizenbock because I consider it either a Maibock or Hefe, IMO. The body is perfect for a Hefe. I would rate it better if it were classified differently.","phishgator","Aug 04, 2008"

Signature banana and clove hefeweizen flavors are present, along with dashes of coriander, nutmeg and mace. The spiciness and sweetness are almost overwhelming, but it remains drinkable and fairly enjoyable, probably because no one characteristic is overwhelming. Still, I feel there's too much going on here; the sweetness and intense yeast profile don't truly allow the hops to come through.

Moving right along, aroma is bursting with that familiar banana along with some fairly strong flowery noble hops. I also pick up some pumpkin pie spice in there. Taste is full of grainy malts along with the flowery noble hops. Hop bitterness is moderate just enough to perfectly balance the malt. There is also a significant lemony-tartness here and it finishes quite dry to make this a very refreshing brew. I would have rated this beer much higher if not for the floating chunks.

I bought a few bottles of the first batch, but I didn't like them. They all had a mild sour flavor...like something was wrong with them. Thankfully, this new bottle does not have the same problem. Still, I'm not a huge fan of this brew. I love hoppy American and European brews, plus I love German-style weizen beers. However, this uber hoppy weizen brew just don't seem to work for me. In this Schneider version, there's a prevalent soapy character I just can't get past. It's in the aroma and the taste, and I figure it's from the hop variety used. Unfortunately for me, the character takes me back to when I was a kid and said a bad word. My Mom's punishment for my mistake was having me suck on a bar of bath soap. Although not as horrible as that, this beer has a soapy character and bitterness that brought me right back to those old forgotten days of gagging on a bar of soap. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish the bottle, but at the same time I doubt I'll be buying this brew again. I tried this bottle side-by-side with the Brooklyn version (and I've also had the similar-in-style New Glarus Imperial Weizen). It seems like I should like all three of those brews a lot, but alas I guess it's not meant to be. Maybe if they used the same wonderful hops as in Sam Adams Imperial Pils, I would like all them better? I'm not sure. As it stands, Aventinus is one of my all-time favorite brews. I also think the Aventinus Eisbock and regular Schneider Weisse are very good.

As the last of the bottle empties the body becomes even cloudier more yeast adding to the mix causes the brew to look like a tropical banana smoothie. Head has great retention here with intricate even lacing clinging to my glass. Aromatics come with fresh zesty herbal hops very spicy with yeast esters and malted barley notes providing sweetness. A touch of banana but much more citrus than anything else, also an air of alcohol can be picked up. It really tickles the nose hairs. Flavor is great herbal zesty almost minty hop bursts layered with a big traditional wheat beer takes hoppy wheat ales to another level. The esters are somewhat lost in the mix of hops and alcohol at 8.2 percent by volume. Most hefe and wezinbocks tend to be overly sweet that is not the case here, aggressive Euro hops are fresh with grassy herbal and citrus notes, zesty wheat kick with the yeast playing such a big role in the overall mix of flavors with a dough like presence. Esters created by fermentation are evident but overshadowed by the hops and alcohol which I really enjoy. Again overall I get a minty sensation in the flavor. Mouthfeel brings effervescent carbonation trademark for good weizens, hop oils remains as well given it a slick feel really sticks around on the palate and almost coats the teeth. Drinkability is excellent creative cooperation between two great brewers it doesn't get better than this now I have to give the Brooklyn Brewing version with the American hops I believed they used Saphir hops in this brew.

3.87,-5.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I saw this at the beer store next to the Schneider Weiss which I have always enjoyed and figured I would give it a go. It poured crystal clear till about 2/3rds of the way through the bottle where all the yeast was settled, and there was a lot. I poured most of it in but the very bottom was like soup and I didn't want to overdo it. It gave me a nice 2 inch almost white head that slowly dropped down to a solid cover that doesn't seem to be going anywhere as I drink it. The beer itself is a nice orangish-gold haze. The smell at first was the typical lemony sweet weiss smell, but then you get the hop in the back of the nose; very interesting and pleasant. The taste however is only OK. There is a slight medicinal flavor right up front that quickly drops back to a slightly acidic, lemony wheat flavour that seems to envelop your tongue. This then leads to a slight hop bitterness that to me just seems a little out of place. It seems that if the hops were a little more piney or citrus it would meld really well, but to me they just give a bitter finish without much point, leaving what at first seemed to be a promising beer with a rather dead finish. Oh well, its certainly enjoyable, just not all I think it could have been. I will say the 8.2 alcohol is absolutely imperceptible to me.","Godot","May 29, 2008"

The appearance of this brew in my Tucher Weizen glass was hazy from yeast with a burnt orange hue. Loud, noisy and bubbly carbonation with a snow white head. The label alone is bright yellow and deep blue...very much the eye catcher. The aroma is bursting with zesty, citrusy esters primarily lemons and grapefruit. A very bubbly, zippy brew. Floral with wildflowers. Grassy, too. The taste is lemony and citrusy and oh so refeshing. The hop profile is understated yet its earthy and floral influence is everywhere. I let this chill longer than usual and didn't wait for it to warm. Initially, it's robust like pop rocks on your tongue form it's lovely carbonation. The chilly temperature did not diminish the flavor or effervesence at all. Drinkable? Hell yeah! Put in a stein for Oktoberfest! Enjoy it after cutting the lawn on a hot summer day! A hit in every way (like its Brooklyn brother).","jim102864","May 29, 2008"

There is also a prominent floral, and citrus presence behind the tang. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a creamy, velvety texture. Overall, this is a top notch beer.

There are about a million flavors in this one, all kinds of different swirling fruits like oranges, some grapes, and then a ton of spices as well. It's like they tried to mix every strong-flavored beer together, into one. Quite unique and tasty. Feel is good and full, with good carbonation. Overall, I liked this one a lot.

Nut, banana, lemon, spices, orange, hints of caramel malt... More hoppy than a lot of examples of the style I've tried, but only to balance the flavor out. Other than a slight hop flavor that lingers, the finish is otherwise fairly clean and rather dry. Rich full mouthfeel, yet ample carbonation and no alcohol flavor or warming makes this beer an easier drinker than expected. Wow, this beer is good. Extremely flavorful, complex, balanced and very drinkable. I'll definitely be snagging a few bottles of this again, not only to compare to the Brooklyner-Schneider version, but also to see how it ages over the next few months (if I can wait that long!)","MrHurmateeowish","May 18, 2008"

The flavor included bananas, oranges, wheat, and also some spicy, herbal hop notes. The 8.2% ABV was very well hidden. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with moderate carbonation.

A nice floral and grass hop, honeysuckle, spicy phenols. Again, pepper, clove and a hint of banana and green apple. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, more than I expected. Finishes with a nice funky bitterness. This collaboration was a fantastic idea that produced two fantastic beers.

More clove in the mouth, as well as a medicinal quality, citrus and hops. Lively well-rounded mouthfeel with a slight burn on the palate and back of the tongue.

I actually prefer the taste of this one to the Brooklyn corked bottle version. There is still some hoppiness to this one, but not as much as it's sister brew. The Schneider version has more of a sweet yeasty taste to it that makes people fall in love with German wheat beers. The only knock on this one was the alcohol content.

Is this beer still suitable for summer? Definitely.

Body is full with limited filtration and loads of lees at the bottom with some great carbonation with no apparent alcohol.

Hops were alternately spicy and citrusy, but always fairly intense. There was also a banana fruitiness and a hint of vanilla. Hops lingered well into the finish.

The smell has very pleasing aromas of banana, coriander, alcohol, and fresh grain. The taste is a bit sharper and spicy with more coriander, earthy hops, pepper, and just the barest touch of banana.

Taste is something altogether different: its a more assertive, crisp weissebier with some playful carbonation and tingly hops that really present themselves in the middle. The hop blast dissipates quickly and gives way to the sweet banana close. As the beer warms, there is a bit of tangerine in the middle. Interesting.

The palate threw me for a loop - is this a hefeweizen or is this an IPA? Perhaps it's both. By far, the most hop-dominant hefe I've ever sampled, but as assertive as the hops are here the beer yields to a more balanced wheat character that is true of a Bavarian hefeweizen. The sweet malt and the floral hops play off of each other quite well here, making for a very complex and unusual palate. The mouthfeel is rather thick, but off-set by the astringency of the hops leaving a dry finish with lingering herbal notes and spice. What a beer. A very unusual combination of flavors going on here ... like a highly hopped pale ale infused with a Bavarian Hefe. This is a classification challenging beer all the way.

The body was standard pale, hazy, and bubbly Weiss beer affair, on second looks, may be a little thicker than normal. The aroma was so much more than the typical wheat beer smells of lemon, banana, bubblegum, and clove, due to the generous addition of noble hops. The phenolic spiciness typically present in wheat beer taste was similarly enhanced here with the herbal hop addition. In addition to the spices, I got a mouthful of tropical fruits like melon, pineapple, and banana, The aftertaste was tart like lemon peel and granny smith apples.

The big surprise is at the end when the hops make themselves known. It ends with a hop bight that numbs the palate slightly.This was an especially interesting wheat beer for me by the sheer fact that the hops had been used in excess compared to others I have tried. This beer is pretty medium in body. I have to say that this is one of the most interesting beers I have tasted in a while. 99% of the time I think the German examples of this style blow the American ones out of the water.

The aromas continue past the fresh fruits and spices with a Weizen-Bock 'dirty' or 'muddled' aroma, yet dominated by German hops. The taste continues with the soft, confectionate wheat malt / barley malt sweetness, followed by estery spiciness and fruitiness, and compounded further with high hop flavor. The bitterness stays in check with less hop 'bite' and more of a wheat-malt pillow for the clove, bananna, and fruits. Finishes fruity, spicy, and malty. Not the cleanest of all beers, despite the hop dryness late. Though the beer has some complex earthy notes that linger a bit further than they need to, this is a highly creative brew with all of the nuances of a classic Dunkel-Weiss, but with an IPA-dry hop punch. Very clever guys. Make sure you keep us guessing. I'm going to drink a lot more of this beer this summer.","BEERchitect","Aug 03, 2007"

3.78,-7.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle. This beer pours a hazy deep dirty straw blond color with a massive glistening head that settles out slowly. There is little carbonation in the brew after pouring. The nose on this one is intense in herbal and grassy noble hop. This sits over a creamy wheat bolstered by light banana. This one is certainly dominated by the noble hopping in there. It is definitely interesting as far as hefes go. Taking a sip, I find a more subdued hop character. The initial flavor is grassy and herbal, but this moves quickly to light banana and creamy wheat with a more mild spicy clove as well. It finishes with a reprisal of herbal hop and a moderate bitterness. This lives up to the name hoppen-weisse. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with a mild carbonation. It is very filling. I'm a little torn on this brew. I have come to really enjoy the noble hop flavors and aromas, but my first love in beer was a nice juicy hefe with fruit and spice pouring out of it, so though I enjoy both major components of this brew, I'm not sure they are working in synergy. This is like a tryst between a really good bohemian pilsner and a hefe.","kmpitz2","Aug 01, 2007"

3.88,-4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Starts out bold, wheaty with a hoppy bite, citrusy in the finish. Dry resinous aftertaste. Traditional Hefe character is overshadowed by the liberal hopping a little bit. Some astringency that builds quickly if you gulp it. Not much banana/clove action. Smooth, wheaty on the palate, full but never overwhelming. Feels fairly traditional in that respect. Drinkability is good, perfect for the summertime.","emerge077","Jul 27, 2007"
4.03,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy amber/brown color with about an inch and a half frothy head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is OK. Nice aroma of clove, banana, pepper and lemon. Flavor is spicy, mostly cloves and pepper, but also some banana, yeast and lemon. Finishes with a tangy taste. Mouthfeel is medium and very carbonated. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and is nice to drink. The alcohol is well hidden, but hits you later. Not quite your normal hefe, but I'm not complaining at all. I liked this brew a lot, and would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others.","bluejacket74","Jul 25, 2007"
4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a belgian snifter, the Hopfen-Weisse appears an opaque golden amber color (more gold than amber) with a nice frothy head that hold together tightly and lingers for a long while. Nice lace retention as the beer recedes. Lots of carbonation. The nose here is delicious, with strong notes of malted clove, banana, lemon, smoky bubblegum, and spicey/peppery hops. The aroma here practically steals the show. The taste is smooth and easy hefeweizen up front but quickly fades into a mellow candied sweetness before finally shifting gears towards a tart and tangy spiced-up bitter finish. This beer is all over the place; it's almost too much at times, because it does require a lot of concentration to get everything, but it's worth it. The most complex hefeweizen I've ever had, for sure. The high alcohol (8.2% ABV) is masked well enough, but you do feel it pretty quickly. But overall this is what I would call a high-society hefeweizen. It challenges your senses of smell and taste like few in the style do, but you're greatly rewarded by it in the end. Seek this beer out and give 'er a try.","Atlas1","Jul 24, 2007"

4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Typical mid size German type bottle, has some sort of info on the rear label, but I can't make any sense of it. Got to love Brewery taking chances, working together and trying to push the friggin envelope a bit more...this offering pours very cloudy ripe apricot, with a frothy light tan head, plenty of loose head, sloppy lacing and better then moderate retention and carbonation. Yeasty, hoppy, flavorful brew. Nose of bananas, yeast, coriander, ginger. On the tongue I get notes of more of the same, also some peppery spice, mustard seeds, plenty of yeasties and german goodness. Overlay all that with a not quite subtle hoppyness, and you realize you are enjoing one of the planets more interesting and cutting edge brews. While everybody else is working on trendy wild ale/sour/lambic kinda things...Schneider and Bklyn have gone in a new and differant direction...love the result and the new ""style""","Billolick","Jul 23, 2007"

4.07,-0.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Thick chewy mouthfeel. Begins spicy with mustard essence dominating the palate. This spicyness transitions into a fruity sweetness that is lead by banana.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"This was an odd beer to find with the Brooklyn label on a German Brewery. This beer poured a very murky grey amber color and formed a huge off white foamy head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. A huge amount of carbonation is present. A heavy aroma of clove and other spices with a hint of banana and pepper. A flavor of clove, spices and some yeast and pepper. The body is medium light and the finish is sprite, yet sweet. The higher alcohol content is well hidden. That higher content pushes it out of hefe and almost more into a Belgian style. Nice experiment, but leaves the world of the Germans and enters the world of the Belgians.","Wildman","Jul 19, 2007"

3.9,-4.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a very interesting beer, but I'm not really sure the hops add much or help the flavor profile. The amount of pepper in the finish is actually a bit off putting, making this not the most drinkable of beers. I'm not sure what the abv. is, but would have to guess that it's at least around 7%. A very interesting beer; I'll be curious to see what the American/Brooklyner version is like later this year.","John_M","0"
