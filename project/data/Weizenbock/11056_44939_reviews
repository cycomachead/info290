"O: An enjoyable experience, but not an oft-repeatable one. Would recommend to fans of weizenbocks."

"O: This beer does a very good job managing to hide its alcohol from the taste. It is a very tasty weizenbock."
"O: A nice malty weizenbock for sure. The highlight here is all of the dark fruit flavors. Really bright, bold and tasty. Great sweetness and smoothness too. Drinkability is high. Light signs of oxidation in the finish (or just some odd flavors?) but it doesn't detract TOO much."
""
"Overall: This beer is not for the faint of heart and it's probably best if you have someone to share it with. An entire 650ml bottle is not for everyone. I did not enjoy it but you well might."

"Reddish with a bit of haze and a short cap of fine beige bubbles. Banana and cotton candy aroma, caramel, grain, and dried fruit. Pretty much the same in the flavour, grain and banana with dried fruit and caramel sweetness. Faint roasted character and a bit of alcohol warmth/flavour in the finish. A bit cleaner than I expected. Full bodied with low carbonation. I liked it. Well balanced for a big beer."

"A nice brown color with a head that dissipated quickly. I smell something, I think fruit like fig. The taste is rich: fruit, a little malt. I don't notice any hops, which is OK, instead I get a little spiciness though I can't pin down the spice. I don't pick up anything I'd associate with wheat, the fruit flavors dominate. Overall, it's a tasty beer."
"Overall - Very doppelbock-ish to my tastes at the start turning more into a sweet weizenbock as it warms some more."

"Overall : Not a bad sample of a weizenbock far from the best on my opinion aventinus"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"A rich drink. It is like sipping a fine single malt. Carbonation is really missing here."

"Overall: pleasant and warm flavours, interesting if not of incredible variety, but the sweetness is a little too much and needs to be cut by something, more carbonation might even help; definitely worth a try, but maybe not a return visit"
""
"Light to medium body, slightly syrupy, low carbonation."
""
""
"O: The complexity that the nose offered was nowhere to be found upon tasting. Curious lack of carbonation. A decent weizenbock. Maybe time just wasn't as kind to it as it should have been."
"Bottle pours a hazy and oily amber with decent head; it's an attractive auburn colour when held up to the light. Yeast-forward aroma has wine tones as well as caramelized grains. The flavour is well balanced with good depth, including some light barrel tones; it actually reminds me of a port. The 11% ABV is well hidden until the alcohol warmth in the finish."

"No chef's palate could ever conceive of a more diverse beer than a Weizenbock, arguably the strongest, most fruity, spicy style in the world. For such a heavy-duty ale this Trois Mousquetaires beer has a significant claim to the cellar - it's the kind of offering you can sit on for as long as you like, until you're fully prepared for its thundering, forcible presence."

"A ruby red pour, a very low if not faint in hops. Malty and sugary this is, and this very much masks the abv content of the brew. Apricot and dates, caramel, grainy, this is a tick taste! The surprising thing about this brew it is strong & surgery in taste, the time at which it leaves the palette is a snap. This is a very drinkable beer, I would recommend only a medium chill."
"Pours a hazy brown with a foamy orange-khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and a variety of dark fruits. Taste is much the same with a distinct grape juice flavor. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O - If I had aged it for a few years and it had gone bad I probably wouldn't review it. But this one was bottled on Oct 15th 2012 and it already turned bad? Normally strong ales like this can keep for a few years. I'd expect better."

"This is a passable Weizonbock at best. Too sweet for me. Also the alcohol could be better hidden, or reduced more realistically. Worth a try but there are better ones out there."
"Not really my favorite - too sweet and probably could do with some cellaring."
"750ml bottle pours a dark reddish brown thats clear with no head at all really. Tastes of dark fruits with slight caramal and a light toffee finish. The big alcohol is there in body, but not in taste. It is a sipper though. Overall its an interesting beer, but I don't see anything wheat ale about it."
"O - A delicious example of the style, loads of flavour, and well worth seeking out. I'll be aging a bottle for sure, but this stuff is dangerously drinkable at 10.5%."
"M - The best part of it. Medium density, good carbonation. As it warms, it gets a little thinner."
""
"(4.0) D: New to this style but I’m really enjoying this one. The big dark fruit emphasis and oaky boozy character are the highlights for me."
""

"Had this last night and it put me to bed.Poured into my Brooklyn-Schneider Hopfen weisse glass a deep murky looking cola color with a nice looking one finger light tannish colored head that settles into a frothy mass.alot going on in the nose with alcohol dipped dark fruit really standing out,a bit of clove spice and sweet caramel,the main thing is it's big and sweet.Flavors really hit ya with a sweet sharp alcohol bomb,alot of dark fruit and phenolic spice mixed with more sweet caramel,the alcohol really hits as it warms.It's a sweet somewhat sticky sipper that can get a bit hot but it's a well made weizenbock,just plan on drinking this and not anything else."

"Overall, tastes fairly good but only for so long. Not what I expected, although I am not upset."

"Mouthfeel is much thinner than the head lead me to believe. I was hoping for a thick monster, and got a medium kitten."
"O - This was very difficult to drink. The bottle size made this a partial drain pour. This one is definitely for sharing."
"Poured a dark maroon, mocha/dark cream coloured head modest retention and lacing. Nose has some deep, dark fruit notes, plums, light chocolate, grapey and lightly vinous/herbal. Tastes of plummy and sweet dark fruits, light wheat character. Sweet malt profile with some brown sugar. Sweet, sticky and full feel, only light alcohol. Low carbonation. A solid dunkelweizenbock, a little sweet but some nice flavours and complexity."
"Deep chestnut, ring of tan head, no lace to speak of really. Deep dark bread notes, raisin, dark fruits, clove, light banana, fig. Taste is quite bready, light alcohol taste, mildly yeasty, dark fruits as well. Med-high carbonation, full body, decent feel, nice full body. Not bad but didn't knock me out, would like to try this with 6 months to a year on it to see if it rounds out some of the rougher edges."
"I think I like this beer and I note that this is a newer vintage than loaded into BA at 10.3%. The aroma is fairly enticing and the flavour isn't bad but the tartness detracts just a touch for me. Good but not great."
"Overall – Another beer that is probably best enjoyed with someone else. I really do wish this brewer put some of their high end beers into smaller formats. Regardless, I enjoyed this beer and I am rarely disappointed by Les Trois Mousquetaires."
"This beer looks very nice but overall its a classic case of the Quebec sweet tooth. Much to much sugar needs to be better balanced."
"The heat definitely pervades this beer - however, it mostly hangs, somewhat malevolently, in the background. The rest is a big, sweet, fruity, cockles-warming tipple - it sure is making me ignore/forget/change the channel on another underwhelming Oilers' result."
"D - Considering the abv on this I could certainly have a number over the course of a night."
"D - for 11% ABV I must say that the alcohol works with the beer and not against it, it is masked and balanced nicely with fruity sweetness and heavy malt character, i wouldn't drink it every day ... maybe every other day"
"This was the 2010 version"
"I think I'd only be interested in drinking this one again as an apertif; a few ounces with dessert or something like that. To open a 750ml of this by yourself is just stupid. Buy one of these, stash it away for a couple years and pull it out at a dinner party to split amongst a table of people; that seems to be what would best suit this brew. I'm going to have to drain pour some of this, it's too intense to finish alone."
"D: A really big weizenbock that hits the style very well. Too high in alcohol to be a regular drinker, but a very nice sipping beer on a nice evening on the deck."
"D: It's a big one."
" Like a lighter version of a dark barley wine, Wonderful winter warmer."
"They say on the bottle it's a winter beer, I couldn't agree more."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one, it just wasn't quite what I was hoping for in the style; the Weizen characteristics didn't come though enough for me."
"Thanks! BN for life!"
"A: Thin layer of head, slight lacing up the sides of the glass, dark hazy brown color, no carbonation noticeable in the beer - 3.25, S: Thick smells of caramelized molasses, lots of aromas of prune juice and ironically soy sauce or teriyaki, dark fruits and dates, hops are hard to discern on the nose - 4.00, T: Alcohol is very evident and at 11% that shouldn't be a surprise, some noticeable hop bitterness, a touch of tartness, prune puree and/or other dark fruits, some burnt espresso grounds, lots of spice as well as some earthiness, a hell of a lot is going on in this beer - 4.25, M: Syrupy and silky - 4.00, D: A powerhouse of a weizenbock, extremely complex and enjoyable but not one I would be able to drink frequently, I would recommend this beer - 3.00"
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium to medium thick. The finish on the beer is medium. The mouth feel of the beer is slightly astringent and carbonated. I think that this beer is a little rough around the edges. Aging this beer would definetely help. Overall this is a pretty good weizenbock."
"Despite the off-putting aroma, the beer grows on you pretty quickly. It's a decent enough beer. Doubt I'd grab another."
"Poured a medium and cloudy golden color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of some earthiness, toffee, and light chocolate. Tastes of caramel, toffee, and some earthy/wheatiness. There was also some lighter fruitiness. Medium bitter finish."
"Pours a nice colour, with a moderate head. The aroma draw you in of wheat, dark fruit, some chocolate. The taste is a good full carmel mouthfeel, its rich, nails the style but must it be at 10%? A tad of sourness in some sips, some sips with bitterness too."
