"M: Very unusual with the alcohol dominating all aspects. The wheatwine finish is a nice touch - a flourish of sweet wheat and alcohol. I still don't think that the wax is needed."
"First sip was a bit of a shock, the alcohol does come across a bit more in my face than expected ... almost hot. Ends up being a pretty well balance brew after a few sips. A good stab at the style just to come running at this beer, ease in with a few sips."

"This is an almost good beer. It's intensely grainy and taste much like Wheaties. The yeast does a good job imparting some fruity esters but they don't overcome the grainy and alcoholic components that overpower here. It's also much more bitter than I had expected. It's ultimately drinkable and not an overall bad beer but for this style I would look elsewhere."
"Medium bodied with crisp carbonation and zesty spice. Much hoppier than expected with some earthy, grassy flavor along with some pepper, coriander and citrus.  Some bready yeast but faint. Not much else going on.  Bland and too bitter for the style.  "
"Funky aroma on this thick weizenbock. Hits the style, a decent drinker and refreshing.Some bannana, and not significant clove. Some orange flavour but overall not exceptional for the style, a worthwhile offering. Above average cabonation.Cloudy appearance."

"Strong aroma is wheaty and fruity with a yeasty undertone and a hint of butterscotch. It pours a pretty dark golden amber that is slightly hazy and has a fairly thick, if not persistent, pale golden-tan head that leaves some good lacing. Crisp flavor has woody, wheaty, earthy and fruity tones with hints of butterscotch and hops. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has plenty of tingle and sass, and leaves a fizzy, woody finish."
"The beer is a hazy dark orange color. Pours with almost no head, any evidence of which recedes to a very thin film and a slight ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing at all. Aroma has a big banana component with some bubblegummy notes. Not a lot of the spice that I like a lot from this type of yeast strain. Taste is a bit of a banana bomb. Lots of bananna which overtakes anything else happening in this beer. Mouthfeel is nice. Smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation."
"Served from tap into a shaker pint. Poured a cloudy golden orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, cloves, spices, and subtle bready notes. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, bread, spices, alcohol, and subtle sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. I really wasn't blown away by this one. While all of the traditional flavors of a Weizenbock were there, they were just way to blunt and invasive on the palate. The alcohol bite didn't help that much at all on this one either. Worth trying if you get the chance, as when I tried it was retired, but I guess it is back..."
"o: I enjoyed this more and more as I drank it. It came across more as a big hefe than a weizenbock, but I don't care, I still liked it."

"Taste is mellow and fruity, it has a Cheddar flavor which is nice and a nice sweet finish. The flavor is really quite good, I like it a lot."

"Poured nto an Aventinus glass a slightly hazed orange infused tea color with a thinner white head atop.A mix of tart green apple and spiced phenols,the alcohol comes thru slightly,light feel for the style,it lacks richness and fullness.Quite tart on the palate with that green apple elelment again,clove-like spiced phenols as well,a shot of sweet alcohol in the finish.Really a lighter bodied weizenbock here,its not bad but it lacks fullness of body and flavor in my opinion."
"Overall one of the better Weizenbock's I've tried. Not sure if it's up there with the ones at right, but it's close."
"22 oz. wax covered bottle. Pours a clear yellow-orange color with a quickly diminishing fizzy white head. Aroma is honey, wheat, fruits, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is sweet malts, apples, spicy and earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, a touch dry, fairly carbonated, spicy, and a touch of bitterness at the finish. Pretty good beer, pretty drinkable."
"This Weizen Bock comes in a 22oz bottle with green wax encasing the cap. An upside-down goat (?) on a background of green meadows, mountains, and clouds appears on the label. The brew pours a dark gold, with a fizzy top that disappears as soon as it arrives. It is practically transparent, with no yeast or haze obstructing the view. Isn't this odd for a wheat beer? I think so. The smell is spot on, with banana, clove, freshly cut hay, and crisp, clean hops rounding things out. In regards to the flavor, the dark fruit esters that normally arise with this style aren't present. However, there are some redeeming characteristics: the sweet front, banana/clove center, and the dry, hoppy finish with a lingering weizenbock aftertaste. Okay, it does lose points for not being truly to style, but it's a pleasure to drink."
"Good beer from OHB."
"This beer was a light yellow with a fair head. The smell was of fresh cut hay. The flavor was watery wheat and a little bit of cream ale or something akin to Boddington's. Drinkability would be better in warmer weather. The abv was not evident but I could still only manage a lackluster reveiw."
