The alcohol inclusion is well integrated at first and gets progressively warming as the experience continues. There is lots of character to take in with this brew and while it is quite complex, it is very enjoyable and easily approachable. I regret forgetting about this bottle for so long and wonder just how delicious she was when fresh. Regardless this was a good brew and I would buy it again if presented with the opportunity.","stakem","Dec 22, 2012"

3.93,3.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This quite sweet beer is pretty well done to style, I think. Better yet, it has layers of flavor depth and complexity that are very well balanced. This is a smooth, rich, balanced and complex brew.","sprucetip","Apr 12, 2011"
3.62,-4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This was decent for a Weizenbock but ultimately just came off as a little too thick and chewy at times. I’m glad that I had someone to split the bottle with.","Kegatron","Apr 02, 2011"
3.93,3.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This has a medium to light body. Really low carbonation with gives it a smooth feel. Overal not a bad beer, I'm not overly familiar with the style but this seems to be a good one.","Bendurgin","Mar 11, 2011"
2.72,-28.2,4,2,3,3,2.5,"So I am in New Hampshire for the Great Bay Half Marathon...its the night before a race and ....why not drink some....ok....alot of the local beer!!! The Weizenbock from Portsmouth is ok...not a bock fan. This beer has was a amber in color with thin white head and great lace. The smell has a subtle malt and bitter nose. This beer was grainy and malty in taste! The smell funnels into the taste of this beer. The light ABV leads to this beer being a being a potential Session...certainly worth a taste.","WoodBrew","Jun 23, 2009"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This 22oz was picked up by my mom a couple days ago. Thanks Mom! It comes out a copper color, with two fingers of white heading. The nose is musty at first, but is followed by some sugar coated brown bread, and a small amount of fruit. The taste blows the doors open here. I get rich brown bread, dark berries, and a slight taste of coconut. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy on this one, with the alcohol making its presence known. This one doesn't wow me that much as far as the style goes, but it is definitely worth a try if given the chance. Weizenbock is an amazing style that does not get the recognition that it deserves, Try this one and remedy that.","jamie2dope","Jun 11, 2009"
4.27,12.7,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Taste is rather sharp at first and astringent but then a creaminess comes over with a slight banana and clove presence riding along, strength seems a little more evident than it should be at the ABV.","deltatauhobbit","Jun 09, 2009"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,3,"Pours deep dark blood-red in color. Looks more like a Doppelbock. Not a ton of head or lacing. Smells typically of sort of roasted dark fruit, sweetness, a bit boozey. Typically again, more like a doppelbock. Flavour is absolutely massive. It is bready, it is thick, it is boozey. The first thing you notice is that it doesn't carry its alcohol too well, and that is the main drawback. It's got a lot of plumy flavours, not much in the way of citrus here. Mouthfeel is decent, appropriately carbonated. This is like a Weizenbock2.0, a lot stronger than you'd typically find. Also not as easy to drink, but still very good.","damienblack","May 27, 2009"

4.32,14,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"There's a whole lot of meat on this bone. Out of the tap this must be downright creamy. From the bottle it holds its own quite nicely. Heavy at times, spritely at others...there are a lot of ephemeral notes with this one. Still, it's another velvety project from Tod and Co. that works very well.","IBUnit63","May 17, 2009"

3.82,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a well crafted, nicely balanced and wonderfully executed ale - typical of Portsmouth quality. Lots going on here. The maple syrup is a great idea and is very subtle. I might not have known it was even there had I not read about it on Portsmouth's website. None of the various flavors or spices dominate and each has a chance to express itself. However I have to admit the apparent bubblegum note really threw me off. I initially did not like this beer because of that. After trying it again I still notice a bubblegum flavor but don't seem to mind it. Incidentally, letting this beer warm a little really helps it to open up.","sethmeister","Dec 10, 2007"
4.05,6.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a deep dark mahogany with a medium sized tan head. The head is alittle small and leaves almost no lacing,but the color is very good. The smell is strong with raisins and other dark fruit,roasted malt,and alcohol. The taste is strong with dark fruit,roasted malt,alcohol,candy sugar,and cloves. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. This tastes like it has more alcohol in it than it does. A very good beer,not my favorite style,but this is damn good.","jmz62565","Beers"
4.05,6.9,4.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Drinkability was rather good. While I would have liked the unique complexities in the flavor of this beer to be a bit more pronounced, this was nevertheless a smooth and quaffable brew.","Damian","0"
4.13,9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured a dark brown with red highlights that left a thick tan head. The smell is fruit, figs, plums, rich dark fruits are ever present. The taste mirrors the nose, sweet malty floural hop presence. Figs, candided fruit, plums follow the earthy texture. The finish has a alcohal presence but is very warming and nicely balanced with an acidic feel to balance out the sweetness on the palate.","Franchise","Mar 31, 2005"
4.1,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,"Whew! This was some tough sledding. Had this in a tulip glass at the Brewery. Very pretty:dark brown, thick head, very sticky. It had a sweet, fruity aroma, and was fairly malty. The taste was sweet, but not overly so. It tasted like honey or maple syrup, with a faint banana flavor. This is a pretty substantial beer. I had two, and had had my fill.","lordofthewiens","Mar 06, 2005"
4.15,9.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Very light, creamy head, almost like that youd find on a stout, with a pretty good stick. Dark brown and verging on claret hue with a great amount of clarity and some action here and there. On nose, roasted malt, caramel, red grapes, and some dusting of toffee. Nice candy apple sweetness on mouth with a hand-in-hand wheat tackling dummy and some very pleasant smoky characteristics. Very sweet, very nice indeed.","Truh","Feb 19, 2005"
3.61,-4.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer poured a dark amber with a nice white head. It had a mild aroma of roast malt along with some scents associated with a weiss beer (mild cloves and banana. There is more malt in this beer, so that brings dates and figs into the mix. Now the taste Wow, very boozy with sweet figs and dates. Very smooth almost creamy mouth feel medium drinakbility due to the alcohol.","carln26","Beers"
