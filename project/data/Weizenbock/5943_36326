3.9,-0.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, unknown bottle coding. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, ripe banana, white grape, orange peel, wheat, honey, bread, light caramel, clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, apple, ripe banana, white grape, orange peel, wheat, honey, bread, light caramel, light clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of pear, apple, white grape, banana, wheat, honey, bread, light caramel, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a nice malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice weizenbock. All around good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

I would put this alongside Ayinger... I would have to say I may even choose this over Ayinger. What I like the most is that the bock-iness is subtle, it is noticeably there but not punching the wheats lights out. Plus, my bottle reads 7.8% ABV... and it is just not there.

3.91,0,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"an interesting german selection here, kind of a merger of two familiar styles, takes on a life of its own. the pour is cloudy and pineapple juice color and texture, with a good solid white head on it with fine retention. the nose is that classic banana yeast, a touch of clove spice, and a lot of booze. the taste starts off as a very malty hefe, the yeast is the only thing keeping this light, as the malt gives it a robust flavor and a rather dense body. some light citrus fruit in the taste, as well as a more complex spice mixture than just clove. it reminds me of sam summer, with that grains of paradise peppercorn sort of complexion, very different with that banana happening. id call it a tropical profile, but its too big and hefty for that, its a cold weather beer for me. the body is full as it can be in a beer this color, and the carbonation is pretty active. overall I like the flavor of this, but the feel and the alcohol content make it sort of a contradiction I cant get past in some ways. it wasn't to be easy drinking, but it isn't, and it wants to be a slow sipper, but it isn't that either, as it gets a little gross as it warms. a neat beer, but not one ill be rushing to purchase again.","StonedTrippin","Mar 04, 2013"

Pours a slightly clouded deep golden amber hue with an off white head forming thick with fine even spread bands of lacing. Aroma has tart citric notes with notes of spiced applesauce coming through with some mild booziness arising the more I smell. NOt as much banana or clove as their standard weizen, this one just really flexes some fusel alcohol and a touch of malt liquor like strength. Flavor has layers of booze, apple, citrus, snd sharp wheat. A semi sweet malt character minimal herbal hop action with a warming level of booze even though it's only 7.5% abv. Mouthfeel has medium bodied even carbonation that coats the palate, really the warmth of the alcohol becomes a bit more than I want.

A little thin through, but that doesn't really work against it so much as it would with a different style. Amazingly smooth and drinkable.

Good constrained bitterness finishing with a sweet wheat again and again. A delight for lunch, surprising 7.5% Good head and grainy creamy mouthfeel. Constrained spices, secondary bubblegum, bannana and clove.","Sammy","Feb 09, 2008"
3.85,-1.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D, notes: A nice mash up of the hefe and bock style. I have never had a weizenbock before but my sense is it can be done better not to say this one is poor.","Nipitato","Jan 29, 2008"
4.04,3.3,3,4,4,3,5,"golden with a mildly disconcerting neon orange hue. lots of bubble traffic up and down, the head is billowing and requires frequent bitter slurps to contain. once it's rested, the cotton-like lacing stays firm against the glass. subdued aromas of candied pecan and banana linger, some herbal notes as well. very fizzy, easy to drink. on the lighter side, somewhere in hefeweizen land. light caramel flavors dominate when carbonation hasn't taken hold already.. fresh baked bread and nothing offensively bold in terms of the holy trinity of yeast, banana & clove. 1/3 of the glass is gone in minutes, for 7.5% that makes this beer insanely drinkable. finishes a bit salty, leaving behind a oceanic yet grainy aftertaste which is a little strange.. and honestly, the only real drawback to this beer. like one friend said, didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised. and like my other friend said, i could sure 'drink the shit out of it'.","goodbyeohio","Jan 13, 2008"

4.23,8.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was excellent. Really a great beer and something that I think everyone should try. It may seem heavy from the look, but I assure you this goes down like water. I would not hesitate to buy this one again.","mikesgroove","Nov 22, 2007"
4.06,3.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: very pleasurable and easy to consume. Definitely worth seeking this one out.","Gavage","Nov 06, 2007"
3.89,-0.5,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this is a beer that seems to defy its own style. Good, enjoyable, and I wish I had purchased some more, but not what I was expecting from a Weizenbock.","ColoradoBobs","Oct 30, 2007"
3.2,-18.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a light honey color with a lot of head. The head was nice and white which diminished to 1/8 of inch. Lasted for quite a bit. Nice lacing. Lots of yeast in the nose with a slightly sweet, yeasty flavor. This beer tastes more like a hefeweizen than their hefeweizen does. 7.5% alocohol is completely masked. I got no heat from this beer whatsoever. Unfortunately, much like the hefeweizen, I thought this beer lacked a depth in flavor. It was a little flat, especially when considering price.","brantadid","Oct 23, 2007"

4.88,24.8,5,4.5,5,5,5,"I am not too keen on describing the details of beer. I can tell you that it is not too hoppy, fairly sweet, but all around great. I don't usually like sweeter beers, but the carbonation and other tastes of this beer are excellent. I went to the BA German Beer Festival in Boston and this and this brewer was the best overall in my opinion. Great beer.","OldEngineOil","Oct 11, 2007"
4.05,3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Big foamy 3 or 4 finger head that settled in a couple minutes. Golden and cloudy. Very yeasty smelling with scents of clove and just a touch of banana, which accurately reflects its taste. Banana comes out more as it warms. Mouthfeel is pleasant, with a good amount of carbonation. Finishes smooth with lingering spicy yeast taste. Very refreshing and drinkable.","NCBeernut","Oct 08, 2007"
3.92,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D:Very good. Being that high in alcohol it was very easy to drink not to mention it was a fun complex beer.","Scoobydank","Oct 07, 2007"
4.53,15.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer looked outrageously good, pale golden color and hazy, nicely carbonated, thick and dry-sticky poofs of foam on top. The smell was banana/clove and a hint of sour milk, and the taste was seriously rich with the same flavors. Very creamy mouthfeel, this is almost a new standard for weizenbocks. Very nice and dangerous competition for Aventinus.","TurdFurgison","Sep 13, 2007"
4.43,13.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a very creamy smooth carbonation, and just an incredible drinkability. This one goes down so smoothy. If this was available anywhere near me I would keep some on hand all of the time. I picked mine up in Grand Rapids, MI.","RedHaze","Aug 30, 2007"
3.7,-5.4,4,4,4,4,2.5,"Candied bananas aromas rise from a papery yellow pour sporting a tall whip of white on top. This beer tastes like banana bread. Walnut hued alcoholic bitterness characterises the finish. Nutmeg and butter tease the mid-palate. Assertive, cutting lines of fizz help keep the experience dry. It is a bit boozy and monolithic to drink in sequences, but I perceive this to be a technically flawless and ambitious brewing achievement.","putnam","Aug 25, 2007"
4.3,10,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"In spite of all the bubbles, Heller Weizenbock is one of the best beers of this style that I've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. I'm not the least bit surprised to see that one more review will put it near the summit of the 'Top Weizenbocks' list on this site. It appears as though the brewers of Aventinus have some serious competition.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 15, 2007"

4.95,26.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Man oh man, I think I've found the holy grail of Bavarian Hefe breweries. I've yet to be let down from Michael Plank and see no turning back in my quest to try all of their offerings. I can only compare the majestic visual beauty of this ale to many world classics like Duvel and Orval. It seems to resonate a heavenly frequency as it sits there in the glass, awaiting your next move. I'm still tasting the residual yeast, powdered sugar and lemony rind flavors. At $5 a bottle, I believe this will be my 'splurge' beer for sure. An instant 'classic' says I.","malty","Jul 08, 2007"
3.98,1.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Hefeweizen fans take notice. Since it is a lighter version of a weizenbock, this comes across as being a something like a super-hefe. Tasty.","wedge","Jul 01, 2007"

4.25,8.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Drinks easy for the ABV, weizenbier freaks will love this. I was looking for a little more body/wheat malt profile, still a nice one, never saw this when I traveling through Bayern, very happy to find it in such nice shape, so far from home!","russpowell","May 25, 2007"
4.38,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tangy wheat malt with a toasted edge up front. Big, ripe, fruit cocktail sweetness quickly takes over. Rummy bananas mix with yeast and gentle clove spice. Fruity sweetness in the finish with moderate noble bitterness, and yeast. Full-bodied, thick, protein-rich, yet gentle, creamy feel. Deliciously drinkable and a nice mix of hefe, weizenbock, and maibock.","alexgash","May 17, 2007"

3.98,1.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is good, a touch on the lighter side but still good body with lots of fast moving tiny bubbles that race down the throat with each sip and get to be a bit much at times. I'm glad I found this tasty brew when I was up in Michigan last weekend. A lighter Weizenbock that's tasty and has a bit of a kick at 7.5%. Worth checking out...I hope to find a few more from this brewery sometime!","orbitalr0x","Apr 11, 2007"
