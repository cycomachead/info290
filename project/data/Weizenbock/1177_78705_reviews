"Mahogany body with hints of ruby. Small beige cap. Citrus, oak, bourbon, vanilla, caramel. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Moderate sweetness. Pretty good."

"The bourbon really dominates and I would have liked to have experienced more of the bock, but still a very good drink."

"Taste: More vanilla and cherry, caramel and toffee, and the sharp twang of alcohol. Just below, the sweet wheat flavors of the weizenbock start to shine. It's a lovely marriage. You never forget for a second that bourbon is involved here, but the base beer is both full-bodied enough to hold it's own against the barrel effects, yet still show off it's own character. I know I said the opposite when speaking of the aroma, but that's just how it went. A delicious beer that sent me to bed peacefully."

"Buffalo bock pours a redish like color, with a nice large white head. There are strong alchool, and wood like aromas. The taste is much the same, rather boozy, strong wood like flavors, and a profound sourness. Full flavors, but the more I drank, the less I wanted this. Overall I found this a tough beer to finish."

"Overall: A very good bourbon barrel aged version of a Weizenbock. Nice creamy notes of bourbon, caramel malt, and fruit."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, it just didn't come together well for me. The sugary, candied flavors and the tart fruits just dominated too much for me and made it almost cloyingly sweet. It wasn't awful, but it definitely isn't one of the better barrel aged beers I've had."
"O: Amazing aromas, flavors, and feel. I'd put this closer to a Doppelbock but there were some weizenbock elements like the banana bread element. I hope they release this again and in larger numbers."
"Pours a hazed brown color with an off-white head. Really nice bourbon aroma, plenty of oak and vanilla, and a hint of chocolate. Mild oxidation, lots of caramel and toffee, maybe a bit of brown sugar. The flavor is sweet bourbon, vanilla, and caramel malts. Brown sugar, oak, and a mild fruitiness in the background. The barrel really drowns out most of the base beer."

"O - A nice treatment by TH. The bock works well with the whiskey, allowing both the booze and base beer to shine though. It's not a mind-blowing experience that Czar Jack was a couple years back, but it's a good beer."

"Muddy dark amber body capped by two fingers of head. Solid head retention and lacing. Smells strongly of red apples, whiskey and oak. A little yeasty and hot, not overly complex. Palate has banana and red apple, oak and whiskey. Surprisingly, this has pretty harmonious flavors, and the barrel doesn't completely dominate the base beer. Body is about medium, decently hefty for the ABV. Solid stuff for what it is."
"D - It's a tad unexciting, with a disproportionate amount of oak and barrel presence and not enough base beer. Thankfully it isn't very boozy, so it goes down pretty easily."

"Overall, a solid brew. I really liked the nose on this one. Kind of drank like a fresh old ale but with barrel flavors. Very well done."

"Good stuff. My only complaint is that the base beer needs a little boost to keep up with the barrel. IMO, tastes and smells mostly like a very nice watered-down whiskey (about 75% that, and 25% weizenbock). I guess part of that is that it integrates well with the base beer, but I'd like more of the beer to come through."
"O- Kinda pissed at myself for only getting one bottle of this. I actually only bought the bottle so I could get the free Czar. Now I have to discipline myself to hold onto it for a while!"

"Draft. Poured into a small goblet. Slightly cloudy carmel color with a light tan head, head tries to stay but minimal head retention. Collars. Caramel, apple, slight spice, vanilla all in the nose. The Bourbon is there too but not overbearing. Sweet caramel not transitions to a slightly hot booze note but doesn’t overpower that much, will be nice to see this settle in the bottle for a while and smooth out. This was my least anticipated barrel release from town hall and I’m really surprised how well I like it. Medium mouthfeel."
"Ultimately I care about the taste of the beer. I'm a bourbon lover and I love the notes that come through from the Eagle Rare barrel. Who would have thought that a weizenbock would age so well in a bourbon barrel! But on second thought the sweetness of the fruits present in a good weizenbock meld perfectly w the bourbon adding that brown sugar booze taste. Wonderful."
"This was the beer I was least looking forward to during 2012 Barrel-Aged week, & it's simply marvelous. Wish they'd have had the base weizenbock on to compare it against (they did earlier this week), that would have been fun. Excellent beer, sorry I didn't capture a bottle of this for myself."
"Slightly boozy in a very good way... the barrel character shines, especially at slightly colder temperature. Low carbonation, medium body and silky feel, with a clean finish. An example of barrel aging done right."
"This is very nice beer. Sweet and boozy! It is wonderful if you like a hotter feeling beer. And for me, I love the bourbon in this. Is does lose some of the traditional fastest with this style, but man is it a beautiful finished product."
