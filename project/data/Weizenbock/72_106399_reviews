"A really interesting, unique, and complex beer. Crazy that something like this comes from a German brewery- shows that some German breweries are willing to go way outside the traditional box."

"An absolutely fantastic brew and one unique creation, these guys are doing great with these one offs takes on German styles."

"I loved this beer as is and if it wasn't around a dollar an ounce I would buy more. God I would love to try a raspberry or cherry infused weizenbock from these wheat wizards someday."

"Poured into two snifters.  Amber brown color with just a tiny bit of film head.  plenty of carbonation.  Smell is very nice.  Oaky funk.  Taste is subtly sweet and funky.  Does not dry out and go uber funky but it is a nice subtle funky after feeling.  at 11.49 a bottle for 12.5 ozs there are better valued beers but this one is nice.  not very nice but nice.  I would not call this a Weizenbock like the style listed; 10c bjcp 2014.  It is a Cuvee, or to me 28c Soured Fruit Beer, which is a blend of beers which are then secondary fermented in a vessel.  In this case the blend is the 10c types Tap 6 Aventinus and Aventinus Eisbock.  The Vessels are French Oak Chardonnay.  The yeast strain for secondary fermentation is unknown to me.  Probably lacto or brett."

"Cheers!"

"If you like sour beers, buy it. If not, AVOID this beer."
"Weizenbock elements are overpowered by a vinegary acidity. The flavors just don't come together to create a pleasant whole. Interesting to try, but overpriced."
"O: One of the best beer’s I’ve had all year.  Gonna hopefully pick up a couple more for the cellar.  4.75"

"This beer reminded me of the joint venture of Weihenstephan and Samuel Adams making the Infinium which was supposed to ""unite a new way of thinking about the world of the American extreme"". This is that kind of beer; an attempt to show other brewers that the staid Germans can knock off a geeky item or two, if they want.  This is not going to be a chewy kind of beer; more sinewy and balanced. $13 is a lot to pay for about 12 oz's, though."
"unballanced between sweet and sour. Cannot really put my finger on it."
"Overall: I had this a while ago and remember having been more impressed. As it is, it's good, but some of the tart/bitter elements detract more than they add. Will see if a little age evens things out at all."

"Complex and robustly flavorful.. Nice winter nightcap"
"Intense and barrely. Lots of cherry and oak. Quite acidic, very boozy. Not worth the money."
"This is a very good tart beer, not overpowering in its sour, but not shy about it.  Definitely not what I expected, so I rated slightly lower than I actually enjoyed it.  Be forewarned or intrigued."

"This is really a fantastic sour.  I have a feeling that if Russian River put this out, its rating would skyrocket.  Since it's Aventinus, it's quite an unexpected flavor profile, but damn is it good."
""
"2014 bottle, notes that this is aged in Chardonnay barrels (unlike the other versions, I think which were aged in Pinot barrels). Pours deep dark brown with a tinge of red on the edges and  ahalf finger of off white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is tart and vinous, with some paint thinner notes, vinegar, plums, acidic in my nostrils. Flavor is sour black cherries, heavy wine notes, clean finish leaving a lightly tart, dry oaky finish on the palate. Heavier for a sour, in the Flanders range of brews, with some light yet prickly carbonation. This was pretty good, but also quite a detour from Aventinus."

"O: I'll continue to buy these at $20 until I can't ever find them again."

"As a Flemish red – yeah, not bad. As a Weizenbock, particularly one as world-class as Aventinus? Disappointing. Next time, I might buy the normal Aventinus and a Duchesse de Bourgogne and mix them myself."

"A beer that shows complexity in barrel aging that you can rarely find. People might say that it lacks character, relying on the fact that it's a tart bomb, but the pairing(s) of TAP 6 & Eisbock and the barriques seems perfectly crafted. Top grades."
""
"Prost!"
"Whoa, this beer is a huge acetone bomb! So much so that it almost completely overwhelms all of the other flavors. Harsh, solvent like and very tough to drink with lots of chemical flavor and vinegar. There's some decent barrel flavor, mostly dry oak and sweet vinous fruit but the acetic acid is so overpowering, it kills off most of the pleasant flavors. Nothing about the base beers stand out except for some boozy sweetness and alcohol burn. I like that they are experimenting but this beer is pretty much an undrinkable mess."
"O - One of the worst tasting beers I've ever encountered. Perhaps it is just not my style, but I would never drink this foul tasting beverage ever again."
"Had much higher hopes for this as I love its 2 component beers. Upon opening at a good temperature with a nice ""pop", there was an appealing aroma of caramel, vanilla, and balsamic vinegar. Poured with a small, thick, creamy, tan head that soon vanished and no lace. Color is a very hazy brown. Sticking my schnoz in the glass yielded besides the above, leather, fruit, and spice. Flavor's similar to nose with tart up front, then bittersweet. Body is good, but carbonation is low. Finish is like flavor, average length, has alcohol warmth. I like the base beers much better."
