All I can say is that it is my favorite beer and I look forward to it very year. I've had it in bottles and on tap, and it has never disappointed. I do agree that the ABV is hard to believe. It is a dangerously smooth and drinkable beer at 9.5 % ABV.","dano","Dec 21, 2013"
4.5,8.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Another great US craft weizenbock from Ramstein. Very dark appearance with lots of deep-roasted malt and fruity esters. The finish is burnt wood and earthy hops which is different than the typical Bavarian versions. Personally, I prefer the burnt caramel notes to the fruitier German weizenbocks. I really wish this and the other Ramstein brews were easier to find in PA since availability is important to a beer consumer. Fortunately, I came across this one at Capone's and am very thankful for that.","wattoclone","Dec 21, 2013"

The malt base is definitely darker and more chocolate-forward than the traditional German example, which allows the yeast esters to not strangle the flavor profile, which is a huge plus for me. Not a drop of detectable alcohol is detectable except in your belly with that slightly warming feeling. Wish they still bottled this because it is by far High Point's best beer.

4.52,8.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Ramstein Winter Wheat is a beer that is hard for me to rate because I have had so few examples of the style, definitely less than five, but from what I can taste and see this beer is ostensibly without faults. The beer was served in a 10 oz tulip from Local 44. It was nearly opaque, dark mahogany brown with just a scummy layer of ecru foam. The beer smells spicy with clove and cinnamon, fruity like candied cherries and cooked bananas and warm like cake. These aromas are carried over in the taste of the beer. It is rich and thick but syrupy or cloyingly sweet. The wheat is manifest in the body and contributes a nice bready grain flavor. The body is luxurious with a whisper of carbonation that is perfect for the beer. I was very surprised by to read this was 9.5% because the alcohol was very well hidden and there was very little alcohol heat. Great beer.","Soonami","Jan 16, 2011"
4.17,0.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Several months past the best before date so I assume this is last years beer. With the high ABV I am not too worried about the quality of the beer. Popped the cap and there was a lot of pressure released. A lot of foam when attempting to pour into the glass. Dark brown color with a large mocha colored head that quickly builds and quickly settles to a thin cap. You can actually hear the carbonation in this beer. Not much lacing is left on the glass. Interesting aroma of mocha, wheat malt, and sour cherrie. I could not detect the alcohol. Intense flavor of chocolate, cloves, smoke, and alcohol. Very warm in the finish. There is something slightly sour in the flavor as well. Overall is quite dry. A large body for a wheat beer. Started out intensely carbonated but it settles down after 10 minutes and leaves behind a good texture. This beer hits the spot on a cold day.","morimech","Nov 20, 2010"

4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a deep espresso brown into a tulip glass - modest effervescent chocloate beige head that quickly dissapated. Nice toasted chocloate funky malty sweet aroma. Tangy sweet malty taste. While I don't taste the 9.5% alcohol, this is definitely a winter warmer - thick, bold, and flavorful. Recommend the Winter Wheat with a nice burger or steak - some kind of red meat beef. Very nice beer, hope to get a chance to try the rest of the Ramstein line.","cpanossian","Oct 25, 2010"

One finger of off-white/beige head, modest carbonation, decent head retention, and good lacing. The nose was a hearty blend of raisin, plum, fig, dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, and even some purple grape hints. The taste confirmed the nose in grandiose fashion..big dark fruit up front, dissolving to malty/caramel/chocolate midpalate, and then finishing on a semi-sweet fruit note. No hint of the alcohol content whatsoever. Mouthfeel is thick and slick, with little carbonation. Dangerously drinkable. Highly recommend aging some of this as well, as I have had some two-year old bottles that revealed stronger hints of dark fruit. A truly great weizenbock.","donniecuffs","Jul 21, 2010"

Taste is fairly sweet for the style, a hint of chocolate, a little earthy, a little herbal overlaid on the dominant characteristics present in the nose.

The best thing about it was that it was pretty easy to drink. Went down like water. I'm not sure why this is rated so high. I'm pretty sure the pint was in good condition.

The smell is one that I've been waiting to experience, almost a revelation. It smells like a wonderful Christmas cookie. It's like a chocolate dipped banana plum, mixed with caramel and molasses cookies. Taste begins with some plum and a bit of dark fruit, plenty of Christmas spices as well, then ends up having a hint of burnt caramel and just a touch of coffee-like roastiness. Carbonation is on the higher side with just a little bit less than medium body. Alcohol is very well hidden in this one.

There is a nice malty sweetness that mixes with a somewhat roasty acidity twanginess. Soft cloveyness and banana sweetness are also present in the taste. Alcohol is almost not apparent, hard to believe the abv, except for a somewhat spicy mouthfeel, a tingle that mixes well with the soft and smooth body.

Some roastiness is in the background and it has a lingering fruitiness. Mouthfeel is about medium with a sticky sweetness that coats the mouth. Very drinkable stuff here.

It has a dry and roasted malt flavor that goes down smooth and warms a bit on the finish. It is rich with chocolate malts which give it a dark character. The fruity clove taste is evident, but little in comparison. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little less than adequate carbonation.

The last bit was swirled to add any sediment into the beer. I can smell sweetness and dark malt eminating from the glass as it just sits there on the table. Closer sniffing reveals potent chocolate and molasses plus some vanilla. Tastes great. Starts with molasses and grainy goodness. Some melon in the sweet start and then a gentle dap of roast grains come in followed by a nice bock character. The start has lotsa flavor plus a rounded floral hop (sort of a Fuggles quality, but this is in the German style so I would be surprised). This beer is not dry, but not wet either. With the bock comes the gentle roast. Not coffee and not strong, but mixing really well with the overall sweet. With searching, I can find alcohol at a consistent level throughout. Wow, this beer is really well balanced. What a fine offering! Great carbonation, too. Fluffy bubbles form on my tongue, not sharp acid creating bubbles like so many other beers I've reviewed recently. No lacing, but there is still a ring of bubbles around the liquid with the last gulp. Thick body for this fantastic beer.","mentor","Jan 26, 2005"

Aroma lets anticipate a rather thick beer and holds all kinds of malt subtleties, smoky licorice, chocolate, hints of coffee and wheat and just any dark fruit you can name or not. Very fruity palate. The malt profile is actually quite sweet, feeling like brown sugar at times, but the supervising smokiness comes in handy to ensure this never gets cloying. The fruit character is just splendid, chewy plums and fresh black berries. This is a garden IÂ’d like to possess. Carbonation is rather low to style, but I enjoy it that way and the medium body just carries the flavor like a pro.

4.45,7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Very dark brown in hue, if not black in the middle, around the edges there was a slim brown highlight. There wasnÂ’t much change in color when held to a light. I am impressed. The head was beige in color. At the summit the head was only a half finger in height. After a brief moment it slid to a small cap. This cap lasted for about half of the consumption before it disappeared completely. There was no subsequent lacing. After RWWÂ’s masterful appearance I am a bit disappointed at the nose. Yes, the actual aromas are nice but there isnÂ’t much potency. I wanted this beer to scream at me, not whisper. It isnÂ’t too cold but I will return to the bouquet at room temperature maybe it will improve. I decided to sip even though I only got a vague impression from the nose. I was rewarded. It is tasty, simply tasty. It is every bit as good as Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock, maybe better even (but not that much better). The palate shows great depth. Upfront is weizen qualities, yummy banana flavors really shine, some pepper too with a stray hint of clove. Shortly after these flavors I detect some wheat characteristics but they are short lived. In the middle comes a rush of alcohol, which burns down the weizen part. Like a phoenix a new beer rises with eisbock qualities. There is a dark fruitiness, raisins, plums, and such. It is plenty malty, soft chocolate notes, more cloves, figs, heat, and caramelized roastiness. Amazing stuff here with plenty of flavor nuances. I returned to the nose at room temperature. Still the bouquet isnÂ’t that strong, the aromas of bubblegum, fruitcake, wood, chocolate covered cherries, and sweet maltiness are present but not loud. Maybe I was expecting too much? Regardless the nose is inviting and I enjoyed drinking it immensely. The mouthfeel is pleasant and typical for the style, medium in body with low but natural carbonation. It feels comfortable. This is amazingly drinkable. Even though I can taste the alcohol I would never have guessed the abv was 9.5%! Dangerous. I really enjoyed this beer on all accounts. Damn, was it good!

Banana and cloves sharp wheat malt sweetness is there somewhere what a complex wheat beer I now fully understand why this beer holds it's own on the Best of BA. As it warms alcohol and more intense over ripened fruit tones arise, nice. It's hard to sip on considering you could just sit here and smell the damn beer all day and be just as happy, but can't let it go to waste can we? A barrage of different but cohesive flavors, wow! A flight of chocolate smoked malts comes over the palate then this flavor is eased by the traditional yeast spawning tones of banana and clove sugar sweet twang and sharp tone of the unmalted wheat used here great stuff can't get over it.

Incredibly smooth and drinkable for such a strong beer.","HappyHourHero","Jan 21, 2004"
4.72,13.7,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Very powerful. This is a contender for thickest body ever. You feel like you need a spoon to drink it. Sweet, but not even close to cloying, this is one hell of a winter warmer. I think I may enjoy it more when young, perhaps some of the phenolic flavor would add just a bit more depth. I really enjoy the woody yeast and mocha blend. It has a very old school feel, probably because of the woody, nutty flavor. Very nice. --edit-- The fruity flavors are drawn out considerably with warmth, as well as the clove. I'd recommend warming this to well past celler temperature in order to get a fuller experience. It's too bad I was more than halfway through when it reached this point. Fantastic.","UnionMade","Jan 19, 2004"

4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a super dark brown, with a medium sized head that dissipates quickly. Leaves little lace on the glass. Aromas of apple, banana, dark malts and pumpernickel bread come to me. Very interesting taste with both sweet and minor sour highlights. Front has sweet, maybe chocolate malt, yeasty, bready falvors and the back has a sort of semi-sour finish, sort of a sour apple hint. For some reason the balance on this beer is tremendous and the beer is incredibly drinkable. I need to get to this brewery next time I'm home. I can favorably compare this to Aventinus, not quite as yeasty or quite as tasty overall but pretty good all around effort.","CRJMellor","Jan 03, 2004"

4.2,1.2,4,4,4,5,4.5,"We should be seeing this in the "Best of BA" real soon I should think. It seems to be getting more well-known, and it really lives up to its high rating. Very deep brown color, but its so thick that nothing comes through it...light thin tan head. Interesting aroma and flavors...some that you usually don't find together, like a grassy wheat aroma mixed with a dark chocolate flavor. Light touch of vanilla extract and alcohol in the nose. As for that alcohol, I would never expect 9.5% from the taste or smell, but you'll feel it once you near the bottom of your glass. Cloves, chocolate, and spices all abound in this wonderful creation. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Thanks to ElGuapo for hookin' me up with this long awaited brew.","IrishRedRock","Dec 22, 2003"
4.92,18.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"VENOM (Loren) was right, you need to do anything you can to get this stuff! A dark brown, nearly black, nearly opaque looking brew with an excellent head of tan foam, that unfortunately dies early and leaves little in the lacing department. The aromas are all there and all all classic: Cloves, vanilla, banana, other fruits and spices, with a distinctly flavorful wheaty-yeastiness to it as well. The taste is an almost euphoric blend of wheat flavors, coupled with chocolate (dark german chocolate?) cherries, berries, spices, and more! The mouthfeel is super creamy and excellent, but not perfect. The drinkability, however, is perfect, and the fact that this brew is nearly 10%ABV just absolutely blows my mind. Thanks for the tip Loren. Wonderful stuff here. The new Aventinus on the block.","francisweizen","Dec 22, 2003"

A full bodied brew with a very nice creamy texture holding bitter chocolate with caramel flavors finishing long with flavors of nuts,smoke and sweet malt and spicy yeast. A very drinkable beer for its size and strength, a very good night cap brew. I'm thinking it may go perfect with pumpkin pie.","jeffboo","Dec 11, 2003"

Ah that smell, sweet wheat, cloves, and a hint of licorice, also some toasted tones noticed, quite a sniffer this one, start is sweet and thick, the top middling in feel. Finish is benignly acidic and the hops mild and pleasant in their spiciness with the aftertaste bone dry and a fine beer IÂ’ve wanted to try.","Gusler","Dec 08, 2003"

4.24,2.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This weizenbock poured opaque black with almost no foam. The smell was a very nice, mellow banana and slightly sweet malt aroma (with perhaps a touch of wheat). The taste was sweet but also slightly tart. The dominant flavors were malt, banana, caramel, and a hint of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and mellow and creamy and fruity. The body was medium with low carbonation. The finish was very light and clean. This was quite a nice beer that almost looked like a stout, but tasted like a wheat beer. The alcohol content was deceptive and was not discernable by taste.","UncleJimbo","Jul 17, 2003"
4.08,-1.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A pleasant aroma of subtle dark roasted malt and caramel greeted me from the glass. Dark brown/black in color with a light brown head.

4.8,15.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"You rarely get to sample a beer as finely crafted as this. Dark, opaque reddish brown, phat creamy tan head. Wafting combination of hefe (banana, clove), old ale (dark fruits, cherry, nuts), and porter (roasted grains) aromas. Tastes are the same combination with some caramelly malt sweetness appearing. Delivered via a medium bodied, yet velvety mouthfeel. 9.5% Alc.? Could've fooled me. Staggeringly drinkable. A big thanks to my beer friend who's always watching my back!","pbrian","Jun 26, 2003"

4.44,7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Winter Wheat pours Imperial Stout black, with a spritzy, fizzy head of the shortest-lived bubbles this side of cola. Actually, this beer looks quite a bit like flat coke that went strong on the syrupÂ… A big caramelly, molasses nose with hints of either dates or dried plums in addition to cloves, chocolate and toasted malts is a welcoming start to the non-visual attributes of this beer. Is that a bit of smoke too? Yup, a sip confirms that there is indeed a hint of phenolic smokiness threading through the cinnamon, raisins, figs molasses, chocolate, cloves and bananas. Damn this stuff is complexÂ… I love the fact that it starts off tasting almost like an under-hopped Imperial Stout, but then the wheat beer yeast kicks in and takes us on a new road, which serves as a magical shortcut between Munich and St. Petersburg. The alcohol in this beer, though it can be felt eventually, canÂ’t be tasted any more than in a 5% Helles. The shockingly low hopping rate manages to account for any molecule of maltose headed from the Â“balancedÂ” side of the equation to the Â“cloyingÂ” side. This beer really displays finesseÂ—it captures all thatÂ’s good about hefeweizen and Imperial Stout/Porter without losing balance, complexity or my interest. Great beerÂ…","TXHops","May 30, 2003"
4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Surprisingly, this beer poured a very dark, almost black color, but when held up to the light some ruby tinges shown through. The light coffee colored head thinned out pretty quick. Nice roasty aroma with fermented fruitiness there, along with coffee and caramel. The taste is interesting Â– fruity sweet, complex and somewhat malty. Does not show the typical wheat characteristics, like sourness, bananas or cloves Â– the sweetness seems to overwhelm any of that. Beer is blended nicely and is very flavorful. It pushes the sweetness envelope for me, but tasty and drinkable nevertheless.","pezoids","May 23, 2003"

I swear it looked like dark grape juice with red highlights. The head the it produced was a medium tan/brown color that produced a thick head that lasted only a moment then faded to a thin ring and covering on the surface. No lace seemed to be present. The aromas that came from this beer were big and sweet Â– dark fruits, sweet malts, apples, caramel, floral hops and some spices. The tastes that came from this Â“wheatÂ” beer were big and surprising. I tasted creamy chocolates, dark fruits, apples, sweet malts, spices, some alcohol , wheat grains and some ash dryness. This beer was creamy and full of fruit flavors. I really enjoyed it. It through me a little, because the colors, flavors, and tastes were different from what I am used to in a wheat beer. Excellent.

Like eating a banana split next to a roaring hardwood campfire the nose is a sublime melange of banana, cherries, vanilla, chocolate and smoked malts. A man could go to slavering before he even takes a sip. More treats for the buds as I quaff this chocolate covered banana explosion that's somewhat held in check by what has to be--but is not perceived as--a huge dose of balancing hops. A thin wisp of smokiness hangs out like a middle-school drug pusher. Are there smoked malts in this brew? There has got to be. What an ambrosial beer. Unique and tasty!

Near 10% alcohol unnoticeale except for a trace in the aftertaste. Scarily drinkable. Hard to find this year, but worth the hunt.","RonfromJersey","Feb 01, 2003"

The aroma is sweetish and fruity (berries, cherry) with a lightly smoky phenolic in the background. The body is medium, and the mouthfeel is full and creamy. The flavor offers some distinct caramelized sugars, a soft chocolatey note, a touch of alcohol, and some dull bubblegum. It finishes fairly short and lightly sweet. Although it's not a complex beer, it is quite flavorfull and extremely enjoyable. Highly recommended and well worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Jan 13, 2003"
