"Overall a subtler take, but with very noticeable esters that really make a mark.  Pretty solid and enjoyable."

"Afrer pouring 500 ml bottle (best before may2015) into its orginal wiessbier glass, i can say that it has dark brown colour with borwn thick head. It smells like brown bread and red plump. When you taste it, you can feel caramel flavours. Despite its alc. 7.3%vol,  it can not be feeled in the finish. Finally i definitely say that i like this typical german wheat beer"

"I've had this beer a month ago and I didn't wrote down anything at all. But for what I can recall, this beer was aesthetically beautiful, both the body, the foam and the carbonation were nice. Yet, and even though I'm a huge fan of spicy stuff, I think that this kind of spice doesn't go well at all with any kind of beer. The best thing I can recall from that night was that I couldn't even end this beer because of how strong was the presence of the spice - not that is was strong, but only that the it was too much quantity for the given amount of beer. Yet, I don't find it a bad beer but I'll give it another try in the future."
"Not bad for my first Weizenbock. Pours a deep chocolate brown, nice head leaving rapidly and hardly any lacing. Aroma is malty and slightly spicy. Taste is bold, sweet and malty and has some spice overtones. Glad I tried it !!"

"Had this for breakfast in high school one time... it got me through class and tasted great too."
"Great experience, especially for the price! Appearance: dark brown cloudy, with a high cream but fleeting; Aroma: brewer's yeast, caramel; Taste: not felt the touch of spice to a normal Weiss, but the feeling of satiety and pleasure took over. After lunch slept like an angel..."

"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, best before 9/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, wheat, clove, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, wheat, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, wheat, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice weizenbock. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Murky brown pour with large creamy tan head. Rich, chocolate raisiny nose with a hint of yeast. Creamy burnt chocolate maltiness with hints of banana, dark fruit. Finished with a woodsy dryness and some mellow wheatiness after the swallow. An interesting brew. My first taste in this style. The chocolate maltiness and the smooth wheaty taste seem to be at odds. For now thought Erdinger's seems to have bokered a peace treaty. For the rest of us it is simply a treat."

"500ml bottle. Erdinger Weizen glass. Brown color, dark amber tints to the light. Beige froth lasts as a thin layer on top.. Aroma profile shows toasted malts, chocolate hues, floral & spiced notes, toffee & subtle Bamberg sweetness. Flavorful toasted malt upfront. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Voluptuous, creamy mouthfeel touch by subtle spicy notes. Hints of bread & banana then floral bitterness arises & lingers into a refreshing & extended bitter/sweet finish. Hints of licorice candy on the aftertaste. Refreshing & delicious. A creamy, malty, dense & flavorful beer well balanced by slight bitterness !!!"

"Food match: I'm going to be controversial and not suggest a German dish for this one but instead suggest: Beef Wellington with a side of roasted vegetables and rich gravy."
""
"Overall: Being that this bottle was quickly coming to being past date, the brew inside has probably fallen off significantly already. Aroma was approachable but taste certainly did not back up that nice front. Would certainly be open to revisiting with a fresher bottle."
"Overall - Not quite on the level of Ayinger or Weihenstephaner's weizenbock, but it's not far off. Quite drinkable, though the flavor leaves a smidgen of complexity to be desired. To summarize, it's a good beer, but I'd rather pay that extra 50 cents to get that Ayinger or Weihenstephaner weizenbock, and before that I'd likely grab the 'dunkel' or 'hefe' weizens before I settled with the weizenbocks... but that's just me."
"500ml brown bottle. Ten months before BBD."
"Taste is on the sweet malt side, touch of fruitiness, picking up the banana and clove aspect, carbonation is a bit high though and kind of distracts at first, slight toffee finish, not much of a hop presence."
"Would definitely buy again"

"O - I was very surprised at this beer. I expected a typical Dunkel which is not my favourite style of beer but I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty this beer is. One to have again for sure!"

"O - Erdinger Pikantus has a great doppelbock malt profile that, from the beginning to end, carries through the beer nicely, balancing dark fruit notes with soft sweetness but, what the beer is missing is a fuller yeast profile. The ""weizen"" part of the beer is good but too nuanced that it becomes overshadowed. A delectable beer regardless."
""

""

"Overall - Pretty damn good especially as a dessert beer, as the flavor could be a bit cloying for some. While I would never turn one down, I feel like this beer has its time and place and is more of a specific purpose beer than the competition which I find is more drinkable at any occasion."
""
"This is a pretty average weizenbock. Not my favourite. The smell is nothing short of amazing, but the taste is a little disappointing. It's pretty meh. Not a whole lot going on. It's on the thin side and has a nice robust malty palette, but doesn't have any oomph. It's sort of bland. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it might benefit from some hops. If it had some dark fruit flavour to it, that'd be a different story. Some estery alcohol bite would be nice too. it's just not there, though. There's really not much going on. I would never buy this again."

"o: A very good Bock, what I used to think of as the perfect Octoberfest beer before Marzens became more common. My part-German dinner guest enjoyed it too."
""
"It is been a few years since last time had it, and I recall to like it a lot, but after tasting so many other experiences I thought it might be boring now. But it is still a great, well balanced and pleasant brew. This is much easier to drink than Vitus and Aventinus, so a good start point or a more relax and still flavorful Weizenbock."

"Pours a sexy dark brown with a densely bubbled off white head. Aroma of tea like hops, sarsaparilla, even faint cocoa. In the taste, roasted malt, spicy hop, mineral. The hard water of the Erdinger brewery is noticeable. Faint suggestions of chocolates. Light hop character that is balancing and earthy with a small spice. Medium bodied and quite full at that. This is a fine German Wheat bock. Authentic German beer."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"
"Overall, a wonderful beer."
""
""
""

""

"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and slight caramel and toast aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and slight caramel flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the flavors are somewhat bland in my opinion."
""
""
""
"This isn't my favorite style, but it's good. I would totally order a pitcher of this if I was in Germany. Not sure when I will be in Germany, but maybe I will find an excuse to visit the brewery. I guarantee it tastes better there! Bottoms up, people."
"On par with other offerings from Erdinger, Pikantus is a very agreeable, if diminished example of a weizenbock style that can often be devastatingly intense and spicy. If you're an initiate to the style, there may be no better place to start. But for those already accustomed to the likes of Aventinus, Vitus and Ayinger, this will practically be candy."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear dirty brown color weizen with large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of banana bread with some cloves notes and some bready notes. Taste is also dominated by some really good banana bread notes with just the right amount of residual sugar and some light cloves and bready notes. Body is full with a fluffy creamy texture and some good carbonation. Solid rendition of the style with loads of interesting esters and a solid wheat malt backbone."
""
""
"Mahogany murk topped with a massive light tan head. Poor retention, no lacing. Deep yeasty aroma, like fermenting bread dough; it also presents notes of vanilla, clove, and banana. Tastes much the same as it smells, hearty bread with banana and spices. A hint of raisin. Banana cake. A slight tang in the finish. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Feels smooth and slightly thick, but not heavy. Simple but flavourful. Pleasant and approachable. Not a great weizenbock, but still a good one."
""
"O - A tasty weizenbock with a decent flavour profile. Nothing overpowering and certainly a sessionable version of the style. These guys know how to brew solid, yet easy drinking, brews. A pleasant addition to the local selection."
""
""
""
""
"Chestnut brown colour, hazy with 2 finger of off white head, good amount of lace as well. Smell is of dark breads, hefty malt bill, cocoa, a bit of dark fruit with a subtle amount of banana and clove as well. Taste is malty, banana bread up front with more dark bread, some mid palate spice, fruit, cocoa and light banana in the finish. Medium carbonation, medium body and even a bit creamy at points as well. Overall this is a decent drink however I would have to say this is more bock than weizen, regardless this was fairly good and relatively inexpensive so this could be something I revisit while it is still on shelves in these parts."
""
"Overall: considering some of the great reviews I have heard about this beer I am certain that I am not yet used to this style, but it tastes to me like a thick, strong wheat beer with chocolate and caramel syrup poured into it. Add to that a price tag of AU$70 a case of 12 x 500mL, and this is a no go for me."
""
"Overall â€“ I really enjoyed this one. Lots of great flavours that work really well together. The carbonation is a little out of control but other than that this is a winner for me."
""
"Although Erdinger hefeweizen is easy to find in Pennsylvania, for some reason the weizenbock and dunkelweizen and extremely difficult to find. I had to drive deep into New Jersey to find it it. In the end it was well worth the trip. This is the darkest and richest weizenbock I have tried thus far. Aroma of caramelized burnt sugar, vanilla and over ripe bananas. Sweet dark fruit predominates the complex taste with hints of dates, rum, raisins, maple and ripe prunes. As is normal for Erdinger, it is bottle conditioned and very cloudy as a result. There is a very pleasant, lingering aftertaste of pecan pie. If this was more readily available I would certainly drink it on a regular basis."

"Standard bock nose from a gorgeous deep, cloudy cocoa brown brew with a pillowy tan head. Looks tasty. Nothing outrageous or different in the flavor profile; very consistent wheat/malt/yeast flavor of a classic dark weizen, but I REALLY liked that the additional esters and malts did not contribute to any sweet clingy quality, as advertised - the malts taste sweet, but donâ€™t linger or leave a syrupy feel on the palate. Nice yeasty wheat finish. A good, clean, solid offering if you enjoy this style, and a quaffable summer thirst quencher for the malt enthusiast."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a large tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee, with some bubblegum, banana and clove notes mixed in. The flavor is very similar, the banana and bubblegum notes from the yeast really standing out. There is also some caramel and toffee from the malt and the beer is fairly sweet overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O- A good beer, but there are definetly better weizenbocks out there. The color kind of scared me at first and actually made me question weather or not I had actually picked up a dunkleweizen by mistake. Upon further inspection of the bottle just now I noticed they have actually labeled it as a Dunkler Weizenbock, odd. While this beer is decent I prefer Weinstephaner's Vitus over this any day."

"o: a rich and complex weizenbock. very enjoyable."
""
""
"O/D - Quite nice. Really rich and tasty with the ease of a regular Hefe. Good."
"O - This is a classically good German Weizenbock. Love it. C'mon importers, bring us more good German bottles!"
"This is not quite as good as Aventinus, in fact I am gonna have one of those after this if I am feeling it, but this is a great one."
""
""
"O- Extremely drinkable, decently complex. Somehow warming and refreshing at the same time. A very fine brew"
"O. Interesting beer. Nice dark fruit flavor. Almost belgianesque. Makes me question whether or not a lot of the weizenbocks have been true to style. Very easy drinking beer."
""

"Overall, this is an alright beer worth consuming. Another one of Erdinger's greatest hits. I will have this again. However, their actual weissbier is still number one to me."
""
""
""
"D: This is a good beer which I would probably drink again. The bitterness definitely lingers for a while. It feels great in the mouth and tastes great also. All in all, a beer I would recommend to friends. Try it!"
"Pours a dark brown to black in color with an off white head. In the aroma, wheat notes, dark fruit, and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, wheat, a small citrus and notes of dark fruits. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry wheat and banana like aftertaste. Lots of fruitiness going on, a small alcohol presence, but nice nonetheless."
"This isnâ€™t for me. Too fruity and sweet and too much yeast to top it off. I donâ€™t know the style well to compare to that, but this doing it for me. There is still a lot of flavor here so it is possible if sweeter beers are your thing that this one might work well. With all German beers it is possible that this is just not fresh enough."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"o- a nice thick beer, nice flavors and perfect for this time of year"
"Quite drinkable even though it's fizzier than most. Something I would have again."
"Weizenbock is a diverse style and I like that a lot; something I think many BAs appreciate very much is variety. This one is darker but not too sweet, with a rich nose. I would like to see even more Weizenbocks around me."
"o) Personally, I'm not a big fan but it may be true to style. I don't know it well."
"This is some good stuff. Delicious, complex and highly drinkable."
"Dr: Hides the 7.3% ABV extraordinarily well. It's priced very fairly (~2 quid) considering German standards (and its ABV) as well. A great beer to get locked on if you're in Germany. I'd certainly have this one again. Any beer fanatic should try this beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer, both warming and satisfying."
"i really love this, great"
"Pours a dark brown color that doesn't let too much light through. The initial head isn't terribly dense and fades away quickly. Light tan and no lacing. The nose has a bit of chocolate as well as some booze and clove. A bit of sweetness there as well. The flavor has a modest amount of chocolate malt as well as some mild German yeast character. Moderate body with a touch o booze in the finish. Pretty good, but nothing too memorable."
"overall - good find for me as it was kind of difficult to get a hold of, not at the head of the class for the style, but really good beverage worth trying"
"Pretty good Wheatbock, so drinkable, alcohol is well hidden and is barely perceived throughout a tasting process."
"Pours a hazy medium brown with off-white head. Nose is aromatic with yeasty bready notes reminding me of dark breads. Palate brings forth nice dark wheaty flavors, wild flavors from the yeast working their magic, and plentyfor carbonation for a tingly zing as it goes down the gullet."
"Beer is medium to light in body, heavily carbonated on the palate. It's sweet and feels nice, mild bitterness on the end, it's a pretty good weizenbock. I'd have it again if it were possible. On a side note, this beer is currently on the Top 50 list for Germany and it is the hardest beer to track down. It was worth the effort."
"Unique amongst other wheat bocks, I recommend this one, especially if you're normally not a fan of the style."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass (because that's all I have at this time), the beer pours a dark brown to black coloring, with brown highlights around the edges. No head present, but a slight film of bubbling. The beer has smells of caramel, but light due to increased carbonation. Also present are smells of sweet fruits (plums and raisins) and malt. The beer has an initial flavor of milk chocolate and earthy spices. The flavor is quickly followed up by a cherry flavor, with an overcarbonated feel to it. The beer is sharp and overcarbonated in mouth, and the beer does not have enough body to counterbalance this. The beer has a semisweet and smooth aftertaste, with a last second bite of the carbonated feel. The finish is a little lackluster, with an overall feel of sweet letdown. Not a beer that promotes continued drinking, in my opinion."
"An extra malty Weizenbock that is very enjoyable as a winter brew."
"I really like this ale."
"It's not the most full-bodied, or the most flavoursome weizenbock I've had, but it's a very tasty brew nonetheless."
"I was taken aback with the first sip - had a hard tart bite first up, then slowly dissolving into the more predicatable banana clove regime. The aftertatste was a little tart as well, the carbonation being over the top and all over. I like my wheat beers to be a little smooth on my palate. I really like their Dunkel, but this one I wouldn't reach out for - definitely no patch on Aventinus or Vitus."
"D: Not my favorite weizenbock, but it was cheap and one I hadn't tried before. Reasonably drinkable, though."
"Pours an almost dark brown body with a quickly dieing two-finger head. The aroma is a good balance of bready, dry malts with a hint of caramel and bitter chocolate and some earthy hops; very minor peppery spices as well. A well-balanced chewey medium body with some residual sweetness like bitter cocoa and caramel with hints of bread/grain all over the body. Mixes w/ herbal, citric hops that have a touch of bitterness and the sharp carbonation in this beer leads to some sharpness in the beer, including a sharp, pointed finish. A little more malt/bock based than hefe but still well-balanced with sweet and citric spiciness and a great beer to relax with."
"Pours a very dark and cloudy deep chestnut color with s light tan head that has micro bubbles and a shaving cream like consistency. Really pretty red highlights in the beer. The darkest weizenbocks I have had so far. The aroma has a tinge of banana fosters to it. Really yeasty and shows the booze too much for me. Citrus spike come on the back end. The flavor is not stylistically what I was looking for. Alcohol esters with unfermented sugary malts. Not really what I am enjoying. The mouthfeel finishes dry and it's got good carbonation. Really not stylistically in the realm of other German weizenbocks. Overall it's nothing special and really disappointed me. I have been impressed with erdinger brews but not this one."
"Overall, I was very pleased with this beer and would purchase this again. I could easily drink this all night."
"Too much carbonation."
"Pikantus doesn't disappoint. It's not the best of the style (Aventinus and Vitus are better) but it's certainly worthy of the top ten."
"Drinkability: The sweetness of the beer tends to become more oppressive half way through the bottle; though I like the style, I couldn't finish this one"
"I'm not trying to trash this beer, as many seem to like it, but it was a tad bit fizzy for my tastes."
"D: as far as I've learned, a weizenbock is a hefe brewed to bock strength. This example takes another approach, and seems to be more along the lines of a doppel brewed with wheat and a fairly neutral weizen yeast. Both unique and impressive, this is a very enjoyable brew."
"Overall the alcohol is extremly well hidden, yielding a sweet plum-like brew. This beer unfourtunalty comes up on the low end of the spectrum for me on the Weizenbock scale. I really would like a bit more spiciness, a bit more carbonation...and I would have the perfect Weizenbock i.e, Aveninus or Vitus."
"It looks like Coca Cola that has been shaken up because the head is pretty decent. Head disappears kind of quickly though.Not a lot of yeast sediment. There is a vanilla aroma in there. Taste is like a regular bock, only a little sweeter. There is a light chocolate note along with roasted malts and vanilla. Mouth is heavy but very good. Smooth finish and a bittersweet aftertaste that is quite pleasant. New favorite!"
"D: Good to accompany strong meals, one of the best wheat beers i've tasted."
"pour is like a dopplebock. coca cola copper with a big head that fades quickly. nose is a little chocolatey... some raspberry tea as buckeyenation mentioned but very mild. toasty caramel. palate is a bit lost as to what the difference is supposed to be between a doppelbock and a weizenbock. its indistinguishable. no wheat character. not fruit from the wheat malt. a good beer as a doppelbock but not creamy... crisp and hard carbonation like like a doppelbock. some dark fruit of plum and black currant but a bit lost. would like to try this beside there doppelbock and see what the actual difference is."
"This is a very drinkable beer . because of the all natural bottle-fermentation there is some sediment left over . Kinda high ABV 7.3 !! Reminds me of a very good home brew ,as in tast.But as for a Germen beer a little different for me, a very good beer. Cant wait till Oktober fest to try out of draft . hopes this helps people"
"Wheat and yeast are more evident in the flavor and join the caramel and chocolate from the nose. Decent lingering finish is pleasant and not too sweet, with a slightly spicy and nutty close as the beer warms. Becomes a bit viscous as the carbonation settles but never really detracts. Good drinkability as the sweetness doesn't overwhelm and the body and flavor keep things interesting."
"1pint, 9fl. oz. bottle served in a weizen glass. 10-2009 indicated on the label. Pour was all head - tan in color and slowly cascading as it gradually revealed a murky prune-colored liquid with light highlights around the base of the glass. Head retention is quite good once it reaches a 1.5 inches. Some lacing, but not much in terms of adherence. Nose was light and sweet - dark fruits (plum, raisins, prunes) and perhaps some brown sugar and molasses. Taste follows nose; however, a slightly vinous quality comes out in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and mildly carbonated with a pleasant clean finish. Delicious and light with a well-hidden abv, while still being quite sweet and flavorful. Can't beat this at $2.99 a bottle either."
"Pours a reddish mahogany color with a large fluffy tan head. Nice sheets of lacing. Aroma is dark bready with cinnamon and some Belgian-like esters. A little bit of metallic aroma too. This is a very malty weizenbock without much ester character in the flavor. Dark breads, a hint of vanilla, very light banana pith, a little spiciness. Definitely not as full-flavored or full-bodied as the top examples of the style, but it's still decent. Body is just a tiny bit watery although on some sips it seems creamier. Pretty drinkable."
"D: Might be wrong time of the year for me to have this, being a war, semmer evening. Will try again this fall."
"And then I fell into a daze and moaned for several hundred pages about a girl I loved."
"D - Very drinkable you dont realy feel the alcohol in this one"
"Taste leans heavily on the chocolate maltiness with a surprising amount of sweet, cheap 5 cent Double Bubble gum flavor. Alcohol is easily detectable, even at the modest level of 7.3%. All the flavors come together well, and this is a fine weizenbock to sip or gulp. A pretty modest price tag, as I got it for less than four bucks. Aventinus, Vitus and Pikantus all are very different interpretations of a much under-represented style. They are all tasty in their own way...just different. I wish there were more of these around. I will definitely buy more of this when I can find it."
"A more than generous carbonated brew that sizzles your taste buds as you drink. I feel the almost over carbonation detracts from the flavors. Dry in the finish and all around slightly above average. Tasty but not something I would re-visit unless I was visiting the brewery in Germany and they were giving them out for free.."
"Overall, an excellent beer. This is my first Weizenbock and I have to say I have had a very, very good first impression."
"Big and bubbly is the head, and the bubbles are popping, and slowly going with it is the head. Good autumn amber brown color with hues of orange. The aroma is sweet...very malty, akin to a marzen. Sweet doughy bread...with a bit of yeast, some maple as well. Tastewise, it has quite a kick of flavor. A little monotone, and tastes more like a marzen plus bubblegum, though it's still a good flavor. Could be better overall though; the carbonation bubbles are too big, and pretty intense... not good for a strong beer, and it holds back the drinkability of the beer. Still, this is pretty good, and less expensive than Aventinus (for the budget conscious)."
"Poured into my Squatters true pint glass a very nice dark brown color, very nice two-finger plus foamy/creamy tan head, with a very nice thick coat of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some slight chocolate/toffe notes, slightly fruity, some yeast notes as well. The taste is very nice, sweet, malty, slight yeast, some dark fruits, choco/toffee notes. Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well with this brew, very easy going down. Drinkable, this is a tasty one."
"D: Easily the best of the three Erdinger beers I've had. My only complaint is that the taste doesn't live up to the nose. Warming helps things along, but this beer doesn't quite match up with the best of its style. Overall; however, I'm quite glad I picked it up."
"Overall a nice looking and smelling beer, but nothing I'd venture out for again. I lacks a bit taste wise."
"Overall, I love this bier. Much like the aventinus, but not quite as good. This is one enjoyable bier that will not disappoint. Prosit!"
"M&D: the carbonation comes slightly too sharp upfront, but this is not a hurdle to the enjoyment as the body remains intact and moderate, while the flavour is well-integrated and charmingly light for a weizenbock. This is apparently on the opposite end of the spectrum from the famous Aventinus from Schneider & Sohn, that this is way less estery in flavour but shows a really decent, profound malt composition overall. A truly highly drinkable weizenbock in my book, esp. given that almost no trace of alc. is found throughout the drink!"
"I found this a pleasant if not perfect brew that is well crafted and will be in my fridge again."
"Not bad. Full of flavor and under 8% as well. It's an imperfect marriage of a bock and a hefeweizen but otherwise, it's still quite delicious. Pick it up."
"Dark scarlet and turbid with tons of suspended yeast and a massive foamy sand colored head that leaves very little lace behind. Smells of dark fruit, raisins, dates, prunes..etc. Some spicy yeast and clove are present. Tastes similar to the smell with a dark fruity sweetness balanced by a dry yeasty quality and just enough hop bittering and warm alcohol in the finish. High carbonation adds to the drinkability. Good stuff."
"This beer is growing on me. I'll have to pick up a few more. It's still a very rough style, though. There aren't a ton of easily available weizenbocks, but Aventinus and the relatively new Vitus cast a long shoadow over the style. The beer is a dark brown, slightly reddish with a dissipating beige head that leaves a little lacing. The nose is fruity with dark stone fruit combined with ripe bananas. The flavor is actually quite complex, but it isn't bright enough for me as a weizenbock. The feel starts almost excessively fizzy. My girlfriend called it soda-like, but the feel is more on the expensive, small batch end of soda. The taste just doesn't have the rich spiced fruit flavors of the best weizenbocks, but it's still a good beer."
"OVERALL: Not bad at all, but not quite a memorable one. Enjoyable and drinkable enough. This was not as good as their Dunkel, but much better than their Helles. I'd definately have this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it like I would the Dunkel."
"I hope to review this beer again once I've cellared a bottle or two for a while."
"500ml bottle. hazy brown , with a huge tight ,bubbled light tan head. Sweetish aromas of malt, and a strained wheatiness,pretty subdued though. While indeed sweet, it has a rather intresting undertone that is semi-bitter from the malts presumably and this tempers the sweet.Wheat like ceral at the end of the taste. Creamy aspects even, little alcohol present but its nice. Liked the palate on this smooth,velvet and creamy at the end. Nice beer..much betterthan the other Erdinger wheat beers I had had."
"If this was casked conditioned for a firkin fest I think this would be amongst the first to empty. For a Weizen Bock this is good. I've had better on tap and in growlers."
"This was a decent beer, but maybe a touch too sweet to drink a lot of. I wouldn't mind having this every so often, but couldn't drink a lot of it."
"Overall, I wasn't expecting a lot from this one, but I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the fruity complexity of the taste. Strongly recommend trying this one."
"Edit: Al-right, it improved as it warmed, so I'm bumping the smell and taste scores."
"The balance between alcohol and flavour is pretty good. Not normally a fan of this style but I don't mind this one."
"Finish: Is slightly bitter but fairly balanced."
"Brown pour with a full tan head. Caramel and sugar aroma mixed with yeast, nuts, and oats. Wheat, nuts, and brown sugar in the flavor. Some metal and alcohol. Lots of dried/lod dark fruits, prunes, figs, dates, blended with caramel. Almost candied. Good enough."
"[Mouth] Strong with good body. malty flavor with some hints of coffee and cacao.mmm!"
"Serving: 500 ml bottle"
"On the palate, this is a nice big, balanced Weizenbock, with a rich body and full flavors, and it's just as heavy on the head, leaving it in the one-to-two beer company, with much more than that going overboard. Overall a delicious sipper, and one that becomes much more balanced, palatable, complex, and even stronger as it warms."
"D- This is a nice, slow sipper. The flavor and presentation make me want to try it again. I'm even tempted to update my ""favorite style."""
"It's OK though the carbonation makes it less enjoyable. The flavors are rather nice though subtle. Will probably stick with Vitus and Aventinus as my favs."
"Overall good for the style, and good for anything. The Vitus is something I enjoy more, but I'm still trying more of these types. For what its worth, this is the best Erdinger I've had, personally (I thought their hefe was decent, and their kristal wasn't bad..but was nothing in comparison to the Weihenstephaners)"
"Pours a dark murky brown into my Oklahoma University hefe glass. A huge, chunky tan head fades slowly. Smells of clove, malt, banana, lemon and orange. Tastes of spice, malts, subtle chocolate, grain and an underlying sweetness. Fairly well carbonated with streaks of bubbles floating to the top through the life of the beer. Light to medium bodied and not that creamy, but smooth going down nonetheless. The 7.3% ABV was not realy noticeable until I noticed it on the bottle, and started paying attention. Basically, it's evident, but not too much. The perfect weizenbock for a late summer day."
"Dark brown with a large frothy head. The head sticks around for a little while, but doesn't leave much lacing to speak of. The aroma is rich and bold, with dark ripe fruits, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of toffee. Taste follow, but with raisin and plum leading to a sweet, round middle flavor and a slight bitterness at the finish from the dark roasted malts and wheat. Mouth is reasonably viscous, with healthy carbonation tickling the tongue. I need to get more of this. Very drinkable and highly recommended."
"D - Not a terrible beer, but a little off balance. Some of the harshest and least desirable aspects are accentuated while the softer flavors are restrained."
"D - Smells better than it tastes, but probably is a good beer for the style. Not my cup of tea."
"The scent and taste of this beer won't knock your socks off but the more I contemplate it and study it's characteristics the more I appreciate it. Not the best for its style buts its near the top. A great choice for someone desiring the style with a dark fruit slant."
"Half-liter German bottle, conditioned, with 12-2007 on the back label. The beer is a yeast-laden mahogany, with lots of carbonation and four fingers of loose, tan head that snaps, crackles and pops, eventually reducing to nothing and imparting no lace. Sweet, vinous and grapey/cidery in the nose, with mild banana, some grassiness, and a touch of alcohol - old and not to style, but not that bad. Similar on the palate, with touches of wheat and dark malts, some esters, and just a hint of oxidation. The light and tingly body thickens slowly and has very little finish. Definitely not a typical weizenbock, but it doesn't taste that bad considering it's past the freshness date and lightly oxidized."
"The finish is a little dry, since most of the flavor is lifted away, and leaves a slight acidic aftertaste. I gave the beer four for drinkability because it's still a pleasant dark German-style wheat beer. The other characteristics I gave Pikantus a lower rating on because according to the other beers of this style that I have thoroughly enjoyed, this should be a fruitier, chewier experience, and I didn't get what I was hoping for. Not horrible, but I don't think I'll be returning."
"Overall: best Erdinger in my opinion. Great combination of wheat, yeast and dark roasted malts. It may be too sweet for some drinkers, but overall great beer. Looking forward for another one."
"Recommended..."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is massive, billowy, and recedes slowly into no lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, wheat, and alcohol. The taste is of caramel, and toffee with a hint of tangy wheat. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and highly carbonated. Overall, this is a decent beer that I suppose I could drink again."
"Almost fruity, malty, rich, wheaty nose. Some alcohol aroma present too as it warms up. Dark caramel chocolate color with looong lasting foamy off white head. Taste was malty, and bock like with a definite taste of wheatiness as well. An interesting beer of a style I'd like to try more of. Towards the end, I could taste the alcohol some as well, but overall a good beer that I'd get again occasionally."
"A bland version of what usually is an exciting style. Dumbed down with yeast and carbonation; this bock's true flavors never have the chance to shine."
"I think this would be good one to pair with gamey dishes (such as duck!)."
"My first of this style, and I like it alot. See, you try something new and you get rewarded."
"This is my first ever weizenbock style beer; I bought the bottle from my dutch beer friend along with a whole lot of other goodies. This beer poured out with a huge head that tops the dark brown beer beneath; the head quickly dissipates leaving a thin layer of foam with some lacing. The smell was bock malty, nice huge malts as expected for a weizenbock some earthy tones and it almost smelled a little salty. The entry to the taste was fairly alcoholic and a little bitter with the malts hiding beneath. These malts then start showing up more and get stronger towards the finish. Clearly I could pick up some spices including cloves and the familiar banana notes evident in many German wheat beers. However the taste was not embracing what I was expecting after getting a really good nose. In particular the alcoholic and bitter part of it was something I prefer without. The after taste had some alcoholic notes in it with some dark fruits (dates?) and a nice slightly sweet bready maltiness which was there to last. The mouthfeel was between medium to full body with a nice creaminess to it and smoothness was there; just as like any of the Erdingers I had. The disappointment was in the taste entry. It was pretty strong though only going at 7.3 ABV; at times I was kind of drinking it like drinking a weizen. I have one more bottle of this; hope it would give me a better experience as I do have really high expectations of this style.. being a big fan of bocks and hefeweizens."
"D - A good beer for sure but due to the 7.3%ABV it surely wouldn't be something you'd session."
"D - It's a good beer, but there are better."
"Review added 10-17-2007, translated from french 3-7-2008."
"Comment: I'm falling more and more for Weizenbocks...perhaps it's my Germanic DNA coming to the front and demanding a brew from the home land of my ancestors."
"Dark brown with a thin tan head. Smells sweet and sugar cane like..with a burnt background. Tastes a lot more bland than it smells. It has a good base of dark roasted malts to it, but lacks the complexity of some of it's peers. It does have some ester quality, but overall it comes out washed out. Has a fine mouthfeel. I've liked this style in the past, this one just seems a little weak for what I've been hoping for."
"A very clean beer, but a bit bland. Lacks the hefeweizen yeast character, and really looks/tastes something like a bland doppelbock."
"I guess my review is a bit of an out-lier here, beyond the first standard deviation (and almost outside the second!), but I love malt, I love Weizenbier, and I love Bocks. This baby is a very good example of all that I love in beer. Highly recommended."
"D: A very pleasing balance of sweet and bitter. All the flavors blend marvelously, leaving only a hint of the ABV and a slight fading bitterness at the end. I can't particularly distinguish the hops from the other flavors. Very easily drinkable, though full-bodied enough to serve as its own meal. The carbonation is just a hair too sharp, but the nice and creamy head balances it enough to not be offensive. Overall a very enjoyable experience."
"500 ml. bottle- color of dark caramel , with a brown thick frothy head - nose of yeast , malts , watery , and some cartelization Â– taste of malts , oats , yeast , and sugar sweet - body is watery, but full , smooth , and with low to medium carbonation Â– aftertaste of malts , almost too sweet , and light Â– easy drinking"
"I noticed after I drank the bottle that the best-by date was March 2006. So 16 months after that date it was still a pretty good beer. I prefer a little more sweetness and banana flavor in weizenbocks but this was still an interesting beer."
"Prost!"
"Pours a murky, dark brown color with a huge head that took a while to subside. Aroma was malty and yeasty with just a hint of spice. Taste was malty and caramelly with a good bit of sweet, fruity flavors mixed in. I could just barely taste the clovey, banana flavors that the style is known for. I was sort of disappointed in that I was looking forward to the beer having a lot more of that spicy characteristic in the taste. Mouthfeel was medium bodied in the palate. Drinkability was pretty good and the beer went down fairly easy. Not a bad beer at all, but not anywhere close to Aventinus in complexity."
"Mouthfeel is just a tad on the fizzy side...less natural carbonation would not hurt at all here, overall drinkability along with a healthy plus ABV make this brew a pleasure to consume...well done!"
"Sharply tart metallic first wave / heavily carbonation / roasted chocolate / fruity floral herbal European hops / light warmth and spice / sticky thick sweetness in back / finishes mostly clean with lingering yeast flavors"
"Recommended. Not a perfect weizenbock (and too bad, I love the style), but a good one."
"Great stuff. Dessert beer...."
"A good complex weizenbock. The chocolate hints give it a delicious flavor. Watch out for the alcohol though."
"d: a relatively straightforward weizenbock that's easy to drink. would be happy to have another"
"subsequent sips provide a bit more cohesive, smoothed out flavor profile which i can surely appreciate (despite it not being my 'thing.') beyond the tang, i am hard pressed to pick up additional nuances save a bit of toffee and maybe the faintest air of charred banana peel. still, not the ban/clv bomb that i was hoping for. recommended, for variety, and i will probably never drink one again."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot. I will be drinking it more in the future. I'm surprised that I didn't recall it being so good from past drinkings."
"Poured beer from bottle into tumbler at 45 degrees. Beer nice brown dark look with a fat pillowy tan brown head. Very lumpy with lots of sticky lacing. Rather nuetral smelling beer, maybe a little nutty sweet. taste was same, kinda nutty sweet slightly but not overpowering with nice malty finish. Alcohol right tight but right on verge of being too much. I believe I will try this beer again though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; Moutfeel is medium to full bodied with a nice creamy feel to it, and has a really good drinkability."
"Well done."
"A great beer, and a fabulous example of a weizenbock."
"Drinkability/Overall: not the most complex weizenbock I've ever had, but certainly the most drinkable. Goes well with pre-Noon college football Saturday drinking on a chilly Madison morning."
"Overall - A very good example of a Weizenbock - not quite up there with the likes of Aventinus but definitely worth a try... A pity it's not as readily available as the other Erdinger beers...."
"Nothing really changed or improved over time. I guess Germany isn't really known for wowing people with flavor complexity, but I'm spoiled after Aventinus. This beer is about as unexciting on the inside as is the packaging, so I guess it met my expectations."
"D- no real developments after 2 years. Perhaps appearance has suffered and carbonation settled which is good. Overall still a tasty chocolatey malt forward weizenbock."
"Found this pretty drinkable, couldn't do it all night, but pretty damn tasty!"
"Thick coating mouthfeel and all that, this beer is really good. I highly recommend it. But Aventinus is even better."
"Has a mild sweetness with some nutty quality to it coupled with a hint of dark fruit that mask the alcohol nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good, though there is nothing here that wows me."
"Pours a very exuberant beige head. Even after a sensitive pour, the head was as big as my fist. Left a thick foam for about two-fifths of the beer. Color is a bubbly chocolate syrup with mahagony and ruby highlights. Smell was a mix off deeply romantic malts and hints of roasted wheat. Taste was like a more bubbly American porter. Without the American hop presence of course. Germans know how to manipulate their malts. Lovely. The palate was just a little metallic at the finish."
"The brew has a medium body with a slightly astringent, sharp presence on the palate. Taste is slightly citric with a backing of earthy malt with showings of caramel. Pretty smooth and quenching. Perceived alcohol is subdued making this a drinkable beer. Worth taking a look at."
"Perhaps what I liked most about the this is that upon first drinking, it seems commonin each individual aspect, but as you progress further, you realize the complexity- the sweet start- refreshing middle, spicydry carbonated end. It doesn't pack the depth, body, or flavour uniqueness of Aventinus, but it makes up a lot with drinkability."
"Enjoyable beer and one of my favorite styles. Worth checking out."
"Comments: This was not my favorite. Enjoyable & interesting, but not in league with others in the style such as Aventinus. This is a lot heavier than expected which detracted from my enjoyment. Too sweet..."
" This is not for the faint of heart. You could almost think of this as a heavy stout with an attitude, on steroids. Damned good stuff!"
"Very dark ruby red and brownish in color. Caramel, plum, burnt sugar came through in the nose. Taste was much of the same, but more noticeable. Hints of banana and clove hidden in there as well. High carbonation with a full body to back it up. Not available near me, but a solid choice when I have the chance."
"drinkability: Pretty easy"
"Notes: What a night! Two German brews in a row that are exceptional. Deep, Rich, Complex, Fruity, Yeasty, some Roasted grains keep it in check...Great!"
"Certainly, this is not the best weizenbock."
"This is a rich, sumptuous bock. It pours prune-dark with a large off-white head that sticks around throughout drinking. The aroma is composed of caramel, prunes/raisins and a touch of baking spices. On the palate, the cloves come out, along with sweet prunes and other spices. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, what you'd expect from a bock, with very little raw alcohol present. Quite a nice bock here, pretty darn drinkable."
"This beer is quite tasty, in fact it is reminding me that I really like Weizen Bocks. Too bad there are not more of these around because I really like how the rich malt character pairs with the traditional Hefe-Weizen yeast. This is definitely a style that I need to brew as well; I sense a recipe coming on for next winter. The rich flavors pair quite well with the chewy texture, and sweet malt notes; this is my type of liquid bread."
"Wow, sure its 7+ percent alcohol? It hides well in such a finess beer. Has a strong bready (almost toasty) flavor and creamy / rich body. Shares with estery, fruity flavors. Llight tartness and citrus blends with dense wheat malts. Lots of protein and dense head retention. A medium, brown with lots of rust colors. May be a bit too heavy on the bready, yeasty, malty side to enjoy often, but a good mixer-upper. Good for a hot summer night."
"Overall, this is an awesome beer. It's very different from Aventinus weizenbock. This is an underrated style, and I really look forward to gettting more of this and more of the style."
"Haven't had too many weizenbocks so I decided that this would be a good choice. Poured into a pint glass an almost eggplant looking color that was lighter and cloudier at the top. Head was minimal, but still left a nice lace. With smell I wasn't too impressed, it was very musty with a powdery medicinal aroma. Taste was an improvement, lots of hops, powder, spice, banana, basically alot of complexities. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy, but still very easy to drink, in fact I would like to try some more and see what I pick up on upon sampling the second time. The only other weizenbock that I've had is Victory Moonglow, having said that I have top say that I like the style quite a bit. Very different and interesting...don't pass this one up if you see it."
"Maybe not the majestic beer I remember, but given my fondness for the Belgians and not the German brews, I think it was pretty damn fantastic."
"This is good , but it doesn't compare to Aventinus...or Victory Moonglow IMHO."
"A very nice, typical German beer."
"Musings: Too much stuff going on for me here. Every now and then you get brilliance in a sip - but no consistent behaviour. Strong and weird - trying this stuff is worth it. Going back is another."
"1 pint .9 ounce bottle. Erdinger Pinkatus pours out a thick, dark brown color with a large, rocky head. The aroma is chocolate and bananas, but I also pick up something not unlike blood. Banana bread and vanilla flavor. Sweet and malty. This beer is missing the sour flavor that I associate with the style. Some tasty spices. Flowery hops come in at the finish. Thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is decent. This is quite the weizenbock: a nice appearance and the flavor to back it up."
"Opinion: This is a very tasty beer! This particular WeizenBock is a lot cleaner than Aventinus...which can be taken either way. I really like the fruitiness you get in Aventinus, but it is a lot like their traditional Weizen beers with the banana and the rest of the fruit basket. This beer is more malt accentuated with a wheaty grainy edge. It goes down really smooth, and almost dangerously hides the 7.3%ABV. I will definitely be drinking this one again."
"from the bottle.poured mahogany big light tan head that left some lacing, aroma, toffee, malty, alcohol, citrus leanig towards. grapefruit and orange, flavor, sour, raisins , molasses, cola, plums, citrus, more on the orange side, alcohol. not to bad, I might buy again."
"D: The Pinkatus is a soid weizenbock with good scent and taste, though nothing terribly outstanding. The beer's attributes improve slightly as it warms, making the overall experience more enjoyable. Quite filling as a beer and worth trying if you enjoy the style."
"Poured a deep rich brown with a fluffy off-at settles into a cramy top,a sweeter aroma that of caramel and sweet alcohol with a hint of phenolic spice.Flavors are pretty basic pretty sweet with some weizen banana and clove traits but it really doesnt jump out at ya an alcohol kick goes down with the finish.A nice creamy mouthfeel lends to its drinkability it went down quite easy for 7.3% alc.A solid but basic brew one I would buy again."
"Body medium to big, slick, chewy, and creamy. Big bubbles give it a fizzy mouthfeel. Good and very different than Aventinus, which is pretty much the standard that all others are weighed against."
"Pikantus was on my mind all day at work. Always been fond of Erdinger's offerings, this one would be great with dessert. I want to wash down a slice of pecan pie with this. tone down the carbonation a notch. malt is sweet, but roasted, so while there is a lot of it, it doesn't overpower. all in all, this bock has got all the pieces, malty, fruity, with sweetness and drinkable to the end"
"Beers like this one are why I love weizenbocks; it's beautiful, it's warm, it's drinkable, and it's delicious."
"I will definitely a style I will explore in the future. A great refreshing session beer."
"A cloudy dark brown beer. Has a big foamy light brown head. There is a light biscuity malt note in the aroma with a hint of chocolate in the background. A lot of things going on in the flavor, some fig dried fruit, some clove and in the finish there is a nice hint of milk chocolate."
"Easy to drink and swift to the palate. A tad underwhelming for the style, but plenty good and satisfying enough to recommend a try."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a thick tan head that diminshes to a thin partial surface covering. Aroma of candied raisins, chocolate and roasted grain. Medium to thinnish mouthfeel is somewhat watery around the edges with ample carbonation. Odd actually. Strong fruitiness is most noticable. Wheat malt lies behind it with a sort of raisiny flavor in the background. Alcoholic vapors in the finish. This is a pretty hearty weizenbock. Despite that it's very easy drinking."
"This oneÂ’s a thick, impenetrable ruddy brown colored liquid. ItÂ’s a creamy and full bodied brew, with moderate carbonation. The flavor is notably roasted, with an almost syrupy sweetness up front. The aroma has a muted malt characteristic, with a lot of fruit (prune, banana). Alcohol is also detectable in the aroma. The finish has a pleasing spiciness. ItÂ’s a very nice-looking beerÂ…with a solid, stable, billowing head. This is an extremely satisfying beer."
"great mouthfeel with a touch of lightness from the carbonation. hard to fault it. drinkability, though, suffers from how substantial this brew is. very enjoyable, but tough to return for another."
"Smooth, slight sourness in the aftertaste, very enjoyable."
"Drinkability is very high. My notes read ""oh, hell yes!"". Glad to find this one. It ain't Aventinus but it's good."
"From bottle. Had trouble controlling the pour resulting in a massive rocky light tan head which lasted well (too well...had to wait a while to finish the pour). When the head finally settled down, colour was dense tan, not much light getting through. Brown sugar/molassis aroma dominated. This carried through to the taste with some coffee tones. Finish was a little metalic with the alcohol well hidden. Mouth feel was a little on the watery side. Not up to the Aventinus, but not bad either."
"Pours a deep dark copper color with a magnificent, meringue-like head. Smells of caramel, bananas, raisins and sweet malty yeast. Taste is comparable to smell - first flavor is that of caramel, with dark fruits coming in right after. A very slight alcohol taste towards the end, with a malty sweet finish. Mouthfeel: very effervescent (naturally) and medium body. As weizenbocks go, this is a very good, albeit very sweet brew."
"(500 ml bottle). Enormous thick and lasting beige head, colour is very dark brown, cloudy. Aroma is immediately bread yeast, bread dough, fresh sweet buns. As the beer warms up, I also get rye bread, leather and caramel. Flavour is rye bread, caramel (too much), molasses, hints of roastiness and spices. Warming mouthfeel. ThereÂ’s a very good beer hidden in here somewhere, but it remains unreleased. Sweetness is mostly to blame."
"Very drinkable"
"Pours a hazy dark chestnut body that is opaque until held to some light. Creamy, beige head is about two fingers tall and retains well, leaving some sheet lace on the glass. Aroma is somewhat restrained, with some initial lemony citrus and grassy notes. Ripe banana becomes dominant after the final pour, with the yeast swirled in. Some clove and white pepper are also noted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with weizen effervesence. Body seems to become lighter toward the middle and finish. Taste has prominent dark fruits(figs and raisins), earthy yeast and hop bitterness, wheat wafer, understated bock maltiness notes of caramel and toffee, and banana and clove weizen notes after the yeast is swirled in. Alcohol is generally concealed, but noticeable. Taste is much better near room temperature, with the yeast swirled in. Pleasantly drinkable, and well constructed. Goes well with pretzels as an afterwork snack."
"Best before 11/07. Pours a hazed chestnut color with some deep orange highlights. Volumnous tan head that's fizzing and popping like a bowl of Rice Krispies. Some flaky particules in suspension. Roasted wheat malt twang, a hint of brown sugar, and faint ripe banana notes in the nose, but rather tame. Malty and rich, with the right amount of wheaty acidity nearer the finish to keep it drinkable. Lively carbonation tickles the palate and keep any sense of sweetness at bay. It is pretty tasty and smooth, but a little one-dimensional in the sense that it is lacking in some of those complex tropical esters that I feel constitute a great weizenbock."
"On-tap poured into a small Erdinger weizen glass. It pours a deep murky brown color with two fingers of off-white head. There is little lacing. The smell has bits of dark fruit and caramel maltiness. Just a little light though. The taste is sweet, and has a lot of caramel to it. Hints of toffee and raisin in there as well. The body is fairly nice and smooth. The drinkability is great for a 7.3% brew. A decent weizenbock."
"This is my first taste of this beer and initally it is very impressive. It has a nice smooth malt taste that hangs around a little while. I agree with Kpitz on the body which seems a little lite. Needs to be a bit thicker but I liked the head and the way it settled as I took time to drink this beer. Also the aroma is very pleasant with the right amount of sweetness. I think I have found another style to enjoy in my beer adventures with this one being a very enjoyable libation."
"This was a pretty good weizenbock. Some flaws are the alcohol flavor which was a bit stronger than I would expect and the veggie off-flavor in the aftertaste. This is definitely worth a shot, so if you see a single of it pick it up sometime."
"Pours a light brown color with a medium head that sticks around for a while and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a nice smell of banana and some other fruits as well as a hint of dark malt. The flavor is caramel with banana and a dark fruit. Pretty nice. Drinkability is good and the mouthfeel is ok - could use a little more body, but overall a good beer."
"We'll see. Last time I had it, I don't think I liked it. The beer pours a flat brown color with a 2 finger head that falls to a finger in height. The nose is a slight dark fruit and caramel covered banana in the nose. The flavor is not that bad. There is a bit of creamyness and a hint of banana and raisin, and caramel sweetness. I guess I stand corrected on this beer. The feel is slightly thin for the flavor. I would like it to be more creamy and just a slight bit thicker, but its not bad at all. This is a nice beer, easy drinking and smooth. Good show."
"Pours a very dark brownish black color and has a off white head that is 3 fingers thick and stable. There is an odd mix of alcohol and raisins and cloves. An odd mix, but not bad. It is a Frankenstein of a beer and it definitely pushes it's weight around in the flavor department. It has a definite bock character that follows up with a crisp clean wheat finish. Not bad at all. And it packs a kick to boot!"
"Glad I tried it, but I wonÂ’t crave it."
"A good warming beer. The wheat offsets the heaviness, so it's perhaps not as rich as a typical dopplebock. I would have preferred more estery or phenolic characters. The yeast used ferments a little cleanly for my taste as regards this style, but it's still quite drinkable."
"Drinkability Â– This WB is oh so good. It is a meal in itself and will get you through those 40 days of fasting just right (or the six hours between lunch and dinner)."
"This is a very good beer. Along with their Dunkel Weisse, Erdinger is proving to be one of my favorite German breweries."
"Dark brown in color. Huge white billowing head. The smell was of Burnt malts, somewhat acidic. Taste of carmel, pretzel dough, and even some light coffee flavors. The CO2 levels are perfectly balanced in this impressive find in Rapid City, SOuth Dakota. I could definitely session this one."
"This poured out a brown with a reddish highlights and a tall growing beige foam head. The head recedes fairly quickly to a cap of bubbles and doesnÂ’t leave any lace stuck to the glass only a trail of head after each sip. Fruity sweet malt is the strongest smell in the aroma. Fruity malts hit the palette first with a nice sweetness that is not over done. Caramel flavors are also quite apparent, as is a dry spicy finish. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with good carbonation. I could definitely put a few of these away they are tasty with a fairly complex taste and its not too heavy on you. This is a pretty good example of the style that I would gladly have again."
"After such a lovely aroma, I thought I had found a winner, but I will just stick with my Andechs."
"Overall: My third Erdinger of the evening and by far easily my biggest favorite of the trio. I have not had that many Weizenbocks, but I find this to be a very attractive, tasty, enticing beauty. IÂ’ll give the Erdinger Hefe-Weizen, and Hefe-Weizen Dark, a miss, but I would certainly buy this one again. A damn tasty Erdinger WeissbrÃ¤u and a cracking Weizenbock!!"
"My first beer of the weizenbock variety, doesn't seem too different from a standard bock. I definently don't taste much of what I'd usually taste in a wheat beer. Appearance is a nice dark, almost cola color, with ample light brown head. Smell is a little weaker than I expected, but not bad. Nose is mostly of malt, mainly caramel and maybe a little raisin. Taste is very good, malty, but not overly so. The malts weren't as strongly caramel tasting as I'd expect in a bock. 7.3% alcohol is not evident at all. Finish may be just a little too abrupt. This is another fine beer from Germany, and thinking back I don't think I've ever had a German beer that I didn't like."
"It was a little thicker than I like for the sweetness involved. A good drinking beer nonetheless."
"Erdinger Weissbier Pikantus isn't that enjoyable. I don't have enough weizenbocks under my belt to know if it's a faithful representation of the style or not, but it probably isn't a beer that I'll return to."
"A lot of positives, but for a beer of 7% there is not enough flavour to warrant a higher score of its Erdinger 'brothers'."
"D&N: I'm going to have to give this one a try next year, just to see if maybe I got hold of a bad bottle, cause as it stands, this beer has nothing to impress me."
"This beer is a mixed bag...it's not full-bodied nor smooth enough to be a great weizenbock, and it's too rich to be a good dunkelweizen. With lower carbonation, a heavier malt bill and a true Bavarian Weizen yeast strain, this would be a champ. As it is, however, it fails as a Weizen-bock in nearly all marks."
"Light to medium bodied with tingly carbonation and a rich full mouthfeel. Warms the belly but the alcohol is hidden very well. Tasty and highly drinkable."
"This beer's appearance is not that great: the head is huge, a grayish, light tan, and foamy, crusty. The beer is a dark, cloudy brown. Nose is a little better: soapy, sugary, spicy, a little strawberry? Ok. Here we go... sweet, fruity front shows ample alcohol. Dark caramel malt blooms in the middle. A little chocolate, thick and creamy. Finish is sweet, a little nutty with more fruit and alcohol. This is a very fruity, malty, thick bock. Despite the slow start, I really like it."
"You can introduce your Bud drinking buddies to this with out a problem, except; donÂ’t let them drive after two."
"Drinkability: Simply excellent with a beguiling complexity, a rich and satisfying beer well suited to a dark, cold day."
"Murky, cloudy dark brown liquid with a hint of red floating around. The head is thin, mustering little more than a finger's worth and settling quickly to film and collar. There are some spots of lace, but not much at all. The nose is nice - mainly caramel, reasonably subdued but definitely present. The mouth is thick with sweetness and mildly carbonated. The taste is smooth as silk, with caramel tones accompanied by a hint of raisin. I was hoping for a bit of hops in the finish, but I'm still waiting. The aftertaste is pure sweet caramel. Certainly a pleasant beer expeirence."
"Pours with a dense, sticky-looking head of small, off-white bubbles that takes its time to go away. Frothiness subsides in a slightly clumpy fashion. Color of beer is an extremely murky (near-opaque) rosewood with chestnutty highlights. Not much cling, the lace dripping back smoothly to build up at the collar. Now the aroma... where exactly is it? Slightly buttery, vaguely grassy... no real nosefeel at all... ! At least it has some good tastes, mostly a sort of quenchy-caramel with candied fruits up front; developing into a apple cidery tartness (with a bit of pear?); and a warm jolt of spice (probably closest to clove). Some buttery hops and a vague herbal quality to finish it off; with warmth, bubblegum comes out in the aftertaste. A spikily carbonated mouthfeel is yet wet and quenching, with a slightly sticky, sour finish. Based on the mouthfeel alone, the drinkability gets pretty high marks; I had no idea this brew was 7.3 abv and it caught up to me pretty fast. This'll serve its purpose as a mid-spring/early fall refresher in workmanlike fashion, but don't ask too much of it."
"Drinkability is excellent."
"erdinger are a brewery that while not making knockout beers, certainly give a good introduction to their various styles and are all very drinkable. i feel this makes up for a slight lack of complexity, but if i had to drink these all night, in no way would i complain. a good foot in the door."
"After some underwhelmed encounters with their other weizens, I was happy to be more satisfied with this Erdinger brew. A very nice dunkel, and an even better weizenbock! Drinkability is quite good, as I thirsted for more, when the bottle was drained!"
"Yes, thedm, this beer went very, very well with our steak supper. Good choice! This was a very drinkable and enjoyable beer that was much to my liking. It poured a large sized frothy tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing. The body was opaque and carbonated with a dark brown hue. The nose was malty and sweet with a caramel and brown flavor that lasted from start to finish. It had a very, very smooth mouthfeel and it was light bodied. There was very sparse lacing with this beer."
"Notes: Can't hold Aventinus' jock -- but then who can? Certainly enjoyed this and will no doubt seek it out again one day."
"Could be bolder all around. But a soild weissbock as it is."
"Dark brown color. Large foamy head. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. This is the darkest, most opaque Weizen Bocks I've seen. Full bodied. Malty, slightly nutty. Chocolate and caramel malts. Seems a little less complex than most Weizen bocks. Not very spicy. Very smooth flavor. Alcohol bite is fairly noticeable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet, with a noticeable alcohol finish. Not their best effort."
"This is no Aventinus but this isn't bad...pours a nice deep brown with a redish tint...big ol frothy head of about an inch that back down to nearly nothing as you drink it....the nose is relatively tame, but interesting...oddly enough some sweet vanilla notes...bubble gum...some of the alcohol is evident...also roasted maltiness....and last but not least a nice caramel/toffee aroma..the flavor is solid but far from remarkable....sweet maltiness....almost sugar candy like...the alcohol adds a bit of sharpness to it to keep it from overwhelming you with sweetness....still pretty one dimensional with the maltiness...mouthfeel is sweet and sticky....drinkability is good...I'd drink more of these, but no more than one at a time due to the sweetness and alcohol combo..sweet, tasty, and it packs a punch...."
"It pours a straight brown with a bit white head that sticks around, leaving lace from top to bottom. The smell is a nice blend of spiciness, caramel/toffee, and a bit of ripe fruit. The complexity carries over to the flavor with all of the previously mentioned characteristics becoming even more pronounced, especially when the beer has warmed just a bit. A nice yeast bite is balanced by the smooth wheat attributes. The mouthfeel is creamy, making for a very nice overall drinking experience. Weizenbocks are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles."
"Excellent Weizenbock, one of the best in the world IMO it is very chocolatey with a nice roasted character. The alcohol i present throughout and the appearance is opaque dark brown, a nice roasty nose to this beer and an lingering malt presence makes this one worth seeking."
"Cloudy dull umber brown in look with a nice 1/2 inch tan head of two separate bubble sizes. Simple lace rings. Yeasty aroma, but with some sense of cardboard and lime. Lighter-bodied than I expected, a bit of molasses, milk chocolate, and fleshy fruit to the malt effort, a little bit of metallic vinegar tinges the end. Some off grainy notes. Hops are minimal, as expected. I tend to like Weizenbocks as among my favorite wheat beers, but this was weak in body and a bit suspect in some of its malt impression."
"An ok beer. Pours a dark brown tone with a cosiderable head of a white/tan tone. The smell precedes the taste, a very malty feeling quite light on hops making it rather simple, as the malt, strongly perceivable, only gives off scarce sweetness which combines lightly with any bitterness. Very, very little carbonation as well. An ok beer as i said before. Just o.k."
"Muddy brown appearance. A somewhat airy, but big, light brown head sits on top. The nose consists of bready yeastiness, chocolate, acetic sourness, and a little ethanol. The prime flavor characteristics I get in this one are phenolic and medicinal. Obviously, not what I was looking for. There are some subtle dark malt nuances and a little ethanol sting. But not a lot else going on. The mouthfeel is too gaseous. Makes drinking all the less pleasurable. This is a subpar weizenbock."
"500ml bottle. Pours a deep dark brown, with a massive tan head that slowly recedes, and leave delicate lacing down the glass. Aroma of malt with barely a hint of clove and banana. The taste is full of malt, with a little sweetness. But lacking any real body. Not a bad beer, just seems to need something more."
"I found this beer pretty enjoyable but not quite as full flavored as some comparables(Aventinus, Celebrator). I will purchase again."
"Opaque dark brown it settles...like thick mud but yummy looking. An absolutely enormous head forms at first and then reduces to a thick coating. An aroma of maltiness and dark fruits is there, but pretty mellow. Yeasty and malty is this medium bodied brew...raisins come through as well and some alcohol touches the finish. It's an enjoyable brew for sure, just not a preferred style of mine. I probably won't buy it again, but I think it's definitely worth a try."
"I've had Erdinger Dunkel many times, and I always enjoyed it. The Pinkatus is a little harder to find, but well worth the search. Has a nice, almost chocolate flavor, and is quite smooth. This is quite a subtle brew considering the ABV. I always liked Erdinger as an alternative to the usual wheat beers, as it doesn't have the same spicy, clovey taste that most others have. (The same reason that many people don't like Erdinger). This pours very dark brown, nice head - good retention and some foamy lace. A nice, subtle biscuity malt undertone, and some mild complexities. Not quite as good as Aventinus, but what is?"
"Murky crimson in hue, covered by a completely uniform, formidably thick, dense and sticky tan head. Nutty, toasty Munich w/ a healthy dose of dark caramel and toffee in aroma. Mellow banana esters. Subdued hints of wheat tartness. Snap of sugary bubblegum initially in flavor is ceded by notes of carob and pseudofruity melanoidins. Wheat makes a token presence by a grainy tartness mid palate along with light clove. Sweetness is persistantly toffeeish and caramelized in nature, and is unfortunately let down by the thin, overly attenuated lack of body. Relatively clean esterwise. Finishes with an overly brief impression of chocolate and banana, but otherwise dry and simply sweet. Pikantus is an odd brew. It falls a bit short of combining the robust malt character of a bock and the quirky esters of a hefeweizen. Tame. It remains quite tasty and highly drinkable, nevertheless."
"Chocolate brown in color with a light brown head. Leaves a good amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is rich, with a bready maltiness. It has a rich bready malty flavor, and hints of chocolate. It is medium-full in body, smooth and somewhat creamy. I really enjoyed this one."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is weak with aromas of sweet roasted malts and grains and a hint of dark fruit. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with a great deal of carbonation. Taste is sweet malts, dark fruit, light chocolate, and a touch of ripe banana. Alcohol becomes more noticeable as the beer warms a bit. Finish is dry. All in all, a complex and enjoyable brew."
"I would recommend Erdinger Pikantus but it is not on par with Aventinus (but what is?). Enjoy one on a cold winter day!"
"Deep brown with ruby highlights and a creamy light tan head that rises out of the glass at first, but then cannot hold. Still, it does leave some lace. The aroma is of a rich malt that has a strong cocoa character and light toffee notes, soft dark fruit, some mild bubblegum and a gentle clove. It's surprisingly rich for a dunkle as they tend to offer less yeasty character... although this is a bock as well. The body is medium, and the mouthfeel starts with a zesty tingle on the tongue from a fine & effervescent carbonation. As it warms in the mouth and the CO2 is released, a soft creaminess takes over. The flavor is softly fruity, mildly tangy, and lightly chocolatey up-front, warming into more toffee-ish notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing with light phenolics and a clove-like spiciness. The alcohol is completely hidden. This is obviously balanced towards maltiness, but the alcohol and dark malts keep it dryer than a standard weizen. Exceptionally well done and highly drinkable."
"Deep garnet to translucent brown in color, head is modest in size, the texture frothy, beige in color with nice sheets of lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt dominated, lightly fruit sweet, hints of caramel, but picked up some medicinal tones? Sweet start, middling mouth feel, moderate on the carbonation, the hops sparse at first, but pick up a bit as it adjusts in temperature, dry aftertaste. Relatively big ABV at 7.3 percent, and I did expect more from this beer than it delivered. Why? You might ask, frankly I donÂ’t know, another mystery to be solved by sampling again."
"Nice medium dark cocolate color. Foam nice and tight but didn't last long. Malty flavor with a very little complex of flavors leading with a raisin taste. Good for introducting people to a mellow brew. This beer was smooooth in the after taste!"
"Notes: This is one big bad wheat beer, not bad but could be too big for some. Huge, effervescent and bursting all over with perplexing complexities."
"Cloudy dark brown, rich foamy beige head. Not much noticable smell wise, some faint maltiness. Taste was appropriately malty, but a bit thin on everything else. Lots of roasted syrupy fruit tastes in the middle, raisans, plums, bit of spice. Doesn't quite met the expectations. Light bodied, and not near as flavorful as Aventinius, but still a very balanced, rich, creamy Weissbock. I liked the Erdinger Dunkel I had last night better, it was actually had more body and better flavor."
"Cloudy dark brown. Nice tan head, minimal lacing. Good looking brew in a tall weizenbier glass. Big dark roasted wheat grain, malt aroma. Some earthy yeast and a mere suggestion of esters are also noted. Initial taste is roasted bitterness. Smooths, mellows and sweetens as it warms. This is a very good weizenbock."
"273"
"Very thick off-white head that took a long time to dissipate.  Nice dark ruby color with a faint fruity odor.  Good lacing after the first drink which had a decent malty sweet flavor that a weizen bock should have."
"when it comes to weizenbocks there is simply no better than aventinus, this doesn't come close, the alchol is too evident, and its a bit thin."
