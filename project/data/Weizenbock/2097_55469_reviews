"the first brew i have had from these guys that didnt absolutely blow me away with quality and originality. not to say it isnt really good, but just that it lacks that oh my goodness element the others have had. its essentially a big strong wit, with all the fruity esters you expect from such a yeast strain, tons of wheat malt body and even sweetness, and then a lemongrassy hop finish thats cool for the style, but lost to the fragrance and potency of the yeast just a bit. its delicate too though for being so robust, its just the sweetness hits a wall mid way, and then the yeast seems naked. the alcohol doesnt show though, making this a dangerously easy drinking brew. i like the belgian intensity, but its not unique from others like it. a well made beer overall with a cool mouthfeel, but maybe a half step behind the best they have to offer."

"O-great flavors, not sure what to make of this as it was billed as an Imperial Wheat Ale, better with a little less sweetness, but overall really enjoyed it"

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its excellent aroma. While it is quite heavy and fusel from the get go, the sweetness of the malts, and the depth of the spice, keeping it even and nicely balanced throughout. Actually with warmth it even became fruitier, further sweetening any residual bitterness. To compare, the flavoring was also quite nice, but we felt they overdid it a bit in regards to how “Belgian” it was, as we were expecting more of a dirty, unfiltered, American imperial Wit. Instead there were heavier syrups and sugars, and a unmistakably Belgian yeast. This is not to say it wasn’t good, but rather just took us for a bit of a surprise. Additionally, the lack of creaminess and foamy froth made things seem unfinished, as they would have helped soften the edges. Either way, this was a strong, tasty beer, and something you should definitely try if you are a fan of wheat."

"Overall: another hit from kuhnhenn's. in my opinion they are too rare and a touch to expensive. But they do know how to make beer"

"o - i normally look at a weiz as a refreshing summer drink, but this is a bit intense for the 90+ degree day. i'll have just one as i didn't love it as first. however, this grew on me as i sipped it (as most big beers do) and i'm kind of digging it much more, however...still rather boozy."

"Served in a tulip glass, a dull golden-orange color, opaque with haze, and a tiny ringlet of head that disappeared completely within seconds. Lots of soft fruit and clovey spice in the nose. Taste is sweet and laden with banana, perhaps more so than I've ever had in a beer, bready yeast, wheat, clove and pepper, light pear and apricot that are mostly eclipsed by the banana, mildly subtle citrus hops in the finish. Smooth and fairly chewy, body is heavier than medium, drinkable, but a bit too sweet for me. Good, but I doubt I could drink more than one of these."

"A gold to orange body. Head disappeared on the way to my table. Aromas of light sugars, spices, and citrus. Flavors of wheat, lemon, apples, cloves, and alcohol. The body was qquite hin for the alcohol/sugar attributes of this beer. Quite sweet. Enjoyable drink."

"Had this on tap at the brewery. Its a very light straw colored brew, a little cloudy. Bright white head stays with this all the way down. Aroma of wheat and citrus is easy to pick up. Tastes also of wheat and grapefruit. Mild bodied. Slightly carbonated and refreshing. Very tasty beer and extremely easy to drink."

"Thanks my firend for the chance to try this one. I was really impressed. The beer held great complexity and depth. Super bright and fresh flavors. Exactly what I look for in the style. Lots of citrus, pepper, sweet malts, spicy yeast and light candies. Crisp body. Really exceptional."
"This beer pours out as a cloudy yellowish golden color with a little white head on it. The aromas of malts, fresh grains and some spices. The taste followed through with these same elements. The mouthfeel was pretty good also. The overall view of this beer that I have is that it was good but just didn't spark my interest all that much. My friend brought home a growler her enjoyed it that much. I just wasn't able to get into this one too much, but it was worth trying."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall, a very interesting beer. It was actually pretty decent. It has some nice flavors, but lacked in the nose. I liked all the lemon flavors. Fairly drinkable as well."
"Bottle. Pours a hazed orange amber color with very minimal head. What head I can muster is a off white color. The aroma is sweet with hints of peach, apricot, and pear mixed with some spice notes like spearmint. Medium/light mouthfeel. The taste is way different than I thought it would be with an almost lemon like sourness/tartness. Almost like a lemon smarties. After the tartness subsides a subtle wheat like base pulls through. Some alcohol presence makes itself known as well. Lingering apricot flavor. Very different but very tasty."
"I'd pass if offered again."
"D: For its strength, the alcohol is very well masked making this beer very drinkable. I would definitely have this again as it was fruity and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down pretty easy. A pretty good example of a big wit bier."
"I'm not the biggest fan of Weizenbock. The combination of a wheat beer and 9.5% alcohol doesn't work for me. Visually, it was a very light color with a lot of good carbonation. The aroma is very wheat-like and good. Mouthfeel was ok but the alcohol is a little heavy handed which would lower the drinkability for me."
"Growler pour from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY, pours hazed medium apricot amber, short lived off white 1/4 inch head, and then, a tiny bubble film and minor lacing. Ripe fruit, bananas, creamcicle, honey, light pepper and yeast in the nose. Tasty, zesty, citric, bold, complex weizenbock, more creamcicle notes, ample pepper, loads of ripe tropical fruit, lime, smooth finish. Love the style, love the Kuhnhenn brews, so you know this one was quite enjoyable. Nice to find this one available, and fresh on tap at my local."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. 1/6 inch head of white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of herbs, orange peel, yeast, sweet malt, and more citrus. Fits the style of a Weizenbock. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coriander, orange peel, yeast, slight hop, and herbs. Overall, good body and aroma."
"Had again on tap at the brewpub and tasty fruity wheat."
"D: I'm not generally the biggest fan of wheat beers, but this was phenomenal. And the rather high ABV was nowhere near detectable. A great beer from Kuhnhenn!"
"Mouthfeel is very good with moderate carbonation, a little heavy malt presence on the palate, and with a clean finish that leaves just a touch of residual sugar to keep some flavor going, without being cloying. Quite easy to drink for nearly 10%"
"Overall, a great beer, and one that Kuhnhenn should make widely available."
"D- Very drinkable for the ABV. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and it is not typically a style I seek out."
"This is an extremely well-crafted imperial wit that's serirously drinkable for the ABV. It's definitely sweet with lots of fruit but the spiciness balances it well. As I've said before, the Kuhnhenn bottles I've had that weren't infected are generally outstanding."
"Taste again is heavy clove followed by some sweet banana, peaches and orange. This is put together really well and the alcohol is barely noticeable.. awesome drinkability. Mouthfeel is medium to light."
