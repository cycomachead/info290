"Overall: A fantastic and welcome surprise from the oldest, and one of the finest German breweries!"
""
"A pleasant surprise, a fantastic beer to repeat"
"Amazing! It tastes exactly like their hefeweizen except it has more alcohol. You can barely tell the difference since it is well hidden. It definately doesn't drink like it's 7.7%.  If more stores carried this i would buy it more often."
""
""
""
"Taste is, as they say, subjective and this may not be the most beautiful or the best looking beer but the aroma is fantastic and the taste, imho, was/is amazing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  very tasty wheat beer that is definitely stronger than the average ... the 7.7% ABV is mostly hidden in the taste, but you can feel it early on; classic wheat beer notes of banana with a little spice in it; the sweetness is very restrained"
""
""
""
""
"This is the perfect beer."
""
""
""
""

"Poured into teku glass.  A beautiful cloudy lemon yellow with a substantial pure white head that lasts.  Aroma of melon, lemon, bread, yeast, and hard candy.  Taste follows closely to the smell concentrating on the melon and tart citrus, with a sweet finish.  Mouth is really nice...medium body, fairly high carbonation, refreshing and pure.  Overall, delicious....my fist taste of a weizenbock and I'm sure it won't be my last."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well made, enjoyable Weizenbock.  Wow!"
""
""
"Flavour - wheaty, robust, with a light spice at the end. there are light grapefruit notes with some bite from the carbonation. Mouthfeel is medium and enjoyable."
"O: Tremendous. It deserves the high marks it gets. It's simple in nature but complex at the same time. The blend of flavor is well executed, it's aesthetically pleasing, and it is just an excellent seasonal beer. Sessionable no doubt. One I will be getting whenever available around the holidays."
"Had it at the brewery with my lunch. Delicious. Read other's notes if you want nuances, subtle notes, etc. I'm not eloquent enough, or my palate not refined enough. But I know what I like, and I like this a LOT!"
""
"When I drink this for some reason it reminds me of drinking Allagash's Tripel Ale. Just so drinkable, delicious, and has me wanting more. If you want an American Beer with this drinkability check that out."
""
"-amazing beer would prefer something darker but this beer is a great example of this style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: color was very light for the style; didn't get any of the dark fruit character I expected;"
""
""
"Overall, a very middling beer. Nothing particular I would recommend about it other than its almost 8% ABV and a low price."

"16.9 oz bottle poured into weizen glass. Hazy straw color with towering white head bolstered by tiny and big bubbles. Streaks of yeast slowly fall to the bottom. Aroma is green banana, clove, lemon, alcohol, and a little bubblegum. Taste is ripe banana, green apple, and wheat malt sweetness. A touch of clove and pepper spice lead to slight bitterness and moderate alcohol on the finish. Medium body, ultra creamy texture, medium-high carbonation, warming and abrupt finish."

"  Overall, a knockout 4.5 for Weihenstephaner Vitus - Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan. even though this came as part of a gift set, I will pursue this while its still available during this month."
""
"Pours a hazy golden color with a big, fluffy white head. Aroma of banana, bubblegum, citrus and  spice.  Taste follows the nose with  banana, bubblegum, bread and a spice.  Mouthfeel is nice  for a  hefe, with the wheat smoothness and a great effervescence.  Overall a great beer, an ""imperial "" hefeweizen of sorts.  Definitely world  class and worthy of every award."
""
""
""
""
"Amazed to find it in Lagos, Nigeria....half liter bottle poured into a tulip glass; cloudy amber color with thick 2 finger foam; smells of cloves banana bread and huge weizenbock arroma- improves as it warms;  taste is ballanced and HUGE;  overall - going back to the store to buy them all-call me greedy, but life is short!"
""
"This is a premium, incredible beer with ""world best beer"" awards.  The color is a golden yellow with a slight, even haziness (a tulip beer glass showcases the beauty of the color and pleasant aroma) and light, white frothy head.  The smell is lightly banana, pear, clove and warmed bread.  The taste is balanced and smooth with a depth of a light pear/banana flavor amidst the wheat/rye texture.  It is smooth, clean and rich in taste.  It is excellent with a heavy breakfast of meat and potatoes, delightful with a hot soup and buttered bread on a winter day and compliments every meat or fish meal I have tried.  I highly recommend this beer.  It has a taste, quality, consistency and depth of color, taste and smell that is not encountered often in the world.  It is a distinct beer.  The beer, as it warms, from the refrigerator releases more subtle flavor and richness of taste.  This is a beer for special occasions and a reward for a job well done."

"This isn't a style I'm well acquainted with or particularly enjoy, but it is definitely a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden straw color with a thick white head and tons of active bubbles feeding ahead that has some serious staying power. Lacing seemed spotty at first but became absolutely coating as the beer warmed a bit.  Aromas are big with banana, clove, pear, apple and hints of cinnamon.  Taste is fruity and spicy with banana and clove coming through immediately with some lighter notes of pear and tart apple.  Mouthfeel starts creamy and carbonated, finishes dry and lets the fruity flavors linger.  This is a fantastic example of the style, great drinking beer."
""
"O- I've read about this one for years and just happened upon it at my local bottle shop.  I've definitely been missing out.  I'll actively seek this beer again (I should have grabbed another bottle or two).  As refreshing as a hefeweizen, but bold and hearty enough to be more enjoyable during the winter months."
""
""
""
""
".5 liter bottle poured into Weissbier glass. Produced a lovely three finger fluffy off-white head that took about 5 minutes to recede. Faded to about a quarter inch that lasted to the end, nice lacing. The color is a cloudy golden-yellow, with lots of carbonation bubbles continually refreshing the foam. The smell is fantastic, with lots of bready yeast prominent, filled in by great banana, bubblegum and clove aromas- one of the best beer aromas out there. The taste was nearly identical to the smell, however the banana flavors really came out. Just the right amount of sweetness too, with a touch of clovey, bubblegummy goodness. The mouthfeel was creamy and kinda chewy almost, with a bit of the prickly carbonation that lets you know you've got something special here. This is such an outstanding beer, and for the price- world class!"

"Three full fingers worth of audibly fizzy crisp tightly compact perfectly uniform bone whit colored head...  Turns a bit rocky on the top and small large carbonation bubbles emerge as this one settles a bit...  Excellent retention...  The color is a slightly murky hazed deep rich amber...  A light bit of sluggish to moderate paced carbonation...  A big rich nose dominated by wheat, yeast, honey and candied sugars...   There is a potent fruitiness about in the form of pear and apple...   There's also a subtle musky funkiness that lingers in the nose as well...  A big rich flavor profile that is identical to the aroma with perhaps a slight addition of some overly ripened banana...  There's also a subtle touch of booziness on the finish...  Medium bodied...  Prickly carbonation...  Slightly chewy...  Good balance...  A very enjoyable beer all the way around regardless of the style...  Perfect in any season and for any occasion...   Just a rock solid example of world class brewing craftsmanship..."

"o: a really delicious wheat beer, full of huge fruit and malt flavours"
"Vitus is another winner from the world's oldest brewery - I could drink this ale all day!"
""

"Paid less than $3 for a pint-sized bottle at local grocer.  At that price, this may be one of the best value-per-quality beers out there."
""
""
""
"I honestly don't know what it is about this beer but it is damn near perfect in my book. It has a crispy fruity mouth taste, and it just gets more complex. The mouth feels is bubbly and playful. I hope that makes sense. It's a complex beer that drinks easy, a feat that for me is hard to find."

"Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head that sticks around for a minute or two. Wonderful nose of bananas and citrus.  Crisp clean flavor with a hint of bananas and a hint of alcohol at the finish.  Creamy mouth feel.  With all the great reviews you don't need me to tell you this is an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes, smells and looks like a  buff Heifewiezen.  Cloudy gold with a minimal and quickly disappearing head.  The smell is banana, clove lemon and bubblegum, but tempered by a stron malt backbone.  This one is pretty smooth for the ABV.  Quite a tasty treat."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 15C adapted to light color bock). Bottle 50 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: sweet wheat aromas mixed with vanilla and some faint banana. no hop aromas. some alcohol. APPEARANCE: gold color and hazy. large moussy white head with good retention. TASTE: sweet vanilla flavour, mixed with a strong wheat presence. very low bitterness with a relative dry finish. PALATE: medium body with moderate carbonation. OVERALL: a very interesting variation of the traditional weizen bock style, which uses a dunkelweizen."
""
""
"Overall-  This is a really interesting beer, and undoubtedly the most complex German beer I've had (in my minimal experience with German beers).  Some of the typical wheat and banana flavors from a hefeweizen, but the malt has more layers to it, starting off dry and switching to softer/sweeter malt flavors.  The carbonation settles down as this warms up which adds points for me, and booze pretty much disappears with warmth too.  Definitely a beer I'd revisit, but I'd probably prefer the classic weihenstephaner hefe the majority of times over this.  (91/100)"

"Overall a very flavorful weizen that hides it's strength well, drinkable,  refreshing and flavorful. I could easily have had another one if there would have been more in my fridge. Will surely have this one again."
""
"Overall - a beer that should please any palate!"
"45/50"

"O - Another strong entry by Weihenstephaner.  Delicious taste, full bodied, and quite drinkable."
""
""
"Overall (4.69) : I bought this 1 pint, 0.9 fl oz bottle for $2.97 at a local grocery store. I am going back for more. This beer was just out of this world good. A taste from my German heritage and a near perfect beer to boot."

"A superb wheat beer. Pours a hazy straw color with creamy head and the nose is the classic lemon and banana. The taste is unique and surprising; starts creamy sweet and finishes even sweeter. Not over the top but enough to let you know that has a bock influence and separates itself from the classic wheat beer they brew. Body is on the light side. Reminds me of the rock-candy like taste you get in a Belgian dubbel."
""
"Overall – Very soft on the pallet with sweet nip this wheat beer bagged itself the WBA best wheat beer award in 2012. Drink a bottle and you will see why. Fragrant with a hint of plum this beer is an absolute cracker and although strong at 7.7% it does not feel like a heavy beer at all."
""
"Very similar to the hefeweissbier only stronger and with less of a banana nose. World-class - one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. For 3.99 at the grocery store, this has to be one of the best deals on import beer in the united states."
""
""
""
"Overall it's really just a strong Hefe, a bock Hefe...  Oddly enough I like it far more than I like Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.  It's clove and spice are more subdued and balanced.  The alcohol content makes it dangerous because it is so drinkable and the alcohol is virtually undetectable.  It goes down as easy as a light Hefe but reminds you of the extra alcohol at the end.  Don't let the fruitiness fool you, it's got a kick!"
"O - Best German wheat beer I've had.  The banana strength in the taste made this brew genuinely enjoyable to drink, even if it was alcohol free.  Having said that, it is a strong beer in terms of ABV and it goes down to easily.  So be careful before gulping this down."
""
""
""
""
"O-delicious nicely brewed"
"O: a gorgeously crafted beer by all accounts.  If you like the spicy flavors, clove in particular, this is a must try.  For the style, this is amazing, I just don't care for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing to complain about this beer, unsurprisingly.  Solid but unexceptional, but as always, difficult to rate a beer that hits its style on point - is it ""average"" or ""the standard""?"
""
""
""
"Beautiful brew. Excellent fruity yeasty esters. Banana and pear highlights along with a nice balancing act of nutty, bready, honey sweet malts and clove spice. Fruity, crisp, and refreshing. Finishes with a nice flavorful drying quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the impression is one of a mere—albeit delicious—hefeweizen with a greater alcohol content. It really doesn't seem bock-like at all, which is the only aspect that I can find fault with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost Perfect!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a hazy light gold with a creamy white head sustained by the carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. The nose is filled with wheat, banana, cloves and spice (cardamom ?). Creamy wheat and bread predominate the taste, but you get plenty of fruit and spice too.  Medium silky mouth. Just a superb beer."

"Indelibly delectable"
""

"Pours a lovely light straw. The color white if wine only hay and with fat head of white foam that falkls slowly enough. The nose is sutlry fruit. The stuff your grandmother is putting in a pie. Apple skin, baked pear, light banana, clove, honey, spice a bit of cinnamon. Oh my stars. The taste is luscious Ripe and succulent fruit.l The apple skin crisp and light, the pear baked and sweet together with the clove. The honey malt The tall and crisp whet malt. That stands in the glass like a strange sentinel. Golden glowing flaky like flakes in the cereal bowl but sweet and soft too. OH! The banana light ans smooth. The mouthfeel is fruity, crisp, creamy . well carbonated and this finishes dry and with so much fruit you cannot stand to believe it’s not under a pie crust."

"O: Hard to describe how intricate this beer is. Almost a cognac-like thing happening which is probably from a magical combination of the wheat and malts. An interesting ""big"" weizen. Again, why have I not tried this before. Really liked. Give it a try."
""
""

"I began the pour, only to be be surprised by its light color. I do not know why I was thinking that it would be dark in color, but I was startled all the same. I got a dense finger of bone-white head with good retention as a result. Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a Hefeweizen, especially in terms of the banana esters, although I got some clove, but accompanied by a bit of heat. I was ready to sneeze. Mouthfeel was medium. I initially thought to myself ""Hefeweizen! Burned again!"" since I am not a big fan of the style, but then the heat kicked in and I realized why this was a Winter beer. Bananas + heat = Bananas Foster! Man, I really dug it in Advanced Foods in HomeEc when we did flambe desserts. Hit the lights, get some fire going and serve. In this case, I was getting ready to hit the deck! It was like a rabbit punch. I did not see this coming, despite the label. Finish was dry, mainly thanks to its inherent heat. Phew! Sabbath plays on while I may be played out."

"Overall: Excellent taste and aroma, very boozy though."

"Overall I think I've found a beer I can go to in any situation here . It's value is unmatched at 3 bucks a bottle . It may not be fresh but this beer holds up. I'm glad this is easily found in my neck of the woods and what the heck was I waiting for to try this!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just what I expected out of this brewery and this beer: excellence all around the horn. The Germans have this brewing thing down pat, and it is difficult for anyone to compete with them, at least in my opinion. While we Americans do have the IPA market locked up, I firmly believe that if you are looking for an excellent wheat beer, look no further than a German or Belgian brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A premium example of the style at a non-premium price of $3.50. What a steal. Asheville's Bier Garden isn't the first place I suggest to have a beer when in town but they sneak in some nice specials here and there and have a very decent selection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy yellow-orange pour with a two finger foamy pure white head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is classic Weizen with spicy wheat up front along with hints of banana, clove, lemon, caramel, yeast, and grass. The taste is bold, spicy, and extremely rich with lots of sweet caramel malt along with hints of banana bread, lemon, clove, pear, apple cider, yeast, and grass. The mouthfeel is really thick and chewy with perfect carbonation and a nice tangy finish. Overall, this is definitely the most flavorful Weizen I've ever had. Having lived in Germany for 13 years and only recently re-visiting Weizens, I'm kicking myself. I've really become a big fan of these beers and will definitely stock up on this gem!"

"12/05/12 On Tap. A truly great beer as long as you're not expecting a hop extravaganza. To me this is a great version of a true Old World style. Forget all the BS drink this stuff. I guess since they have been at it since 725 AD, they have it together."
"O - Extremely satisfying and delicious. So well made."

"I love the opponent but this was a close winner, with the more impressive, aggressive, potent aroma carrying the day"
"Like a festive white bread infused with spices and fruit. That's what this beer is."
""
""
""

""
""

"O - I really like the lack of bitterness in the taste, which is very pleasant. So overall just a nice tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a great refreshing beer, as a hefe should, and does not feel strong on the sips. very balanced indeed."
""
""
""
"Definitely not my favorite style so I'm trying to be fair to it. This is clearly a well made beer, and after analyzing it more closely I needed to do the right thing and review to increase my original rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Delicious. I have no complaints."
""
"O - This is an outstanding beer. My first experience with a Weizenbock and this did not disappoint. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O - An excellent example of a traditional Weizenbock that only Weihenstephaner can pull off. This beer sets the standard for strong wheat beers. It is refreshing and smooth with a combination of flavours that compliment but don't dominate the yeasty wheat base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark yellow in color with a light amber hue and a heavy haze. Poured with a huge, billowly, white foam that slowly reduced. Grainy wheat, light corriander, fresh pear and banana aromas. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a spicy, tanginess through the middle that smooths at the end. Wheat bread, pear and banana flavors up front with peppery spice through the middle. Bready malt and banana flavors at the end as this finishes dry and crisp. A beer with a ton of character in every category. "
""

""
""
"Pours a hazy honey in color with about a 2-finger white head that settles to a thin layer on top and sides. Decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip. Lots going on with the aroma as there is wheat, yeast, cloves citrus and even banana. The taste is complex as well with the spices of clove & nutmeg and sweet banana mixing well with the wheat and biscuit (yeast). Perfect carbonation and goes down so easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste either. I guess the oldest brewery (1040 A.D.) has figured out how to make some great brews over the years and nailed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright golden hued with great clarity. A tightly knit inch thick head of white foam. Brussels lacing. Seriously enticing aroma of banana and sourdough bread. The mouth is moderately carbonated and dry. The front of the palate is sourdough bread and is quickly followed by the banana flavor that fades back to a more subtle sourdough bread fade."
""
"Excellent price point for the quality of this beer, Would definitely put this on rotation as a go to Spring/summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.75 - This beer has so much potential to be sickeningly sweet and cloying but it completely avoids that and blends all the flavors of a German bock beer in a way that's so good, you'll never want to touch an American wheat beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding. While I do enjoy a hefeweizen, this style and beer are more up my alley. A bit more bite, but well balanced. A must try."
""
""
""
"A complex beer of the old guard that doesn't have to punch you in the mouth to get its point across."
""
"This is a tasty wheat beer with hints of banana flavor. I was a little disappointed with the musty, dirt-like aroma. The 7.7 ABV sneaks up on you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic weizenbock. Again, this one is like a boozed-up version of the normal hefeweizen, but remains incredibly balanced. It tastes and drinks much like Weihenstephaner's normal hefeweizen, but you can definitely feel the difference. A fantastic, world class brew, and one that I highly recommend for wheat beer lovers."
""
""

"MF – Medium bodied, semi-dry finish. 4"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an outstanding Weizenbock, and for a Weizen, it's a big, big bier, clocking in at 7.7%. It drinks perfectly clean and tasty. Definitely one of the best German wheat beers I've ever had. Consider it a must-try if you're a fan of the style."
""
""

"The Vitus is good...but its not in my favorite lane....there is much clove in the scent and in the taste. The beer poured a slightly hazy golden with big head that is leaving a spotty lace. The mouthfeel is medium in body with big carbonation. Overall its a good beer and I am glad I have tried it....but I would go for the other Weihenstephen offerings before going to this one."
"O: Awesome example of the style with such a smooth balance but noticeable strength. You get transported to old world Germany with this beer. Must try this beer if you like a flavorful wheat beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just an extremely well executed beer from top to bottom. Not really a hint of the big ABV, except for slight slickness on the palate, but I actually enjoy that element of the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Top of the line Weizenbock. The wheat dominates but the bock end doesn't come through as much I had hoped."
"O - Extremely worthy of its ratings and high praise. The ABV flys under the radar and has enough complexity to keep it interesting. Excellent beer!"
""
"Overall: I haven't had this in a while and I forgot how good it was. Did I mention that all this goodness is only $3.50 or less at most places too. More please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yet another great beer from these guys, I love the variety of flavors and aromas that it presents."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Watch out. No hint of alcohol. Hidden behind banana and citrus flavors. This is a boozy spring drink for me. I think it is perfect for March/April."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A boozy complex wheat beer. Very enjoyable, I could drink this all day long in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden with a big creamy white head. Huge banana aroma. Taste begins with some banana, then some fresh bread flavor, then finishes with a sweet clove. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a very good beer. Quite strong in ABV, but no cloying alcohol taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It starts out with a slight bite, almost a barley wine bite and then quickly lets the flavors come out. Citrus filled at first blush, then sets in with a buttery, biscuit filled taste. The color is simply beautiful. A dark honey appearance that you cannot see through, with a light powdery foam head that settles but laces little and has no glass cling. Although my favorite beer from Weihenstephaner is the traditional Hefe weissbeir, the Vitus is a close second. Try it! Then enjoy it. It is an accumulated taste for the senses indeed."
"weiz glass. straw yellow, lighter color than expected. any other of this style have been more of a brown color. hazy and white head. aroma is mostly all farm. very earthy, and some spice presence. so damn refreshing, big spice bite and the banana underneath"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent. The look is almost murky. On top of the ultra-cloudy hay colored brew is a huge frothy head that stayed the course. The smell is overwhelmingly banana, and seems just like warm banana bread. The taste is more complex, but harder to put my finger on it. I picked up fruit and bread wrapped in a spiciness. The total package is great. I will get this again."
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a moderately hazy golden amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of doughy wheat, banana and yeast, classic Weihenstephaner; these wheat beers small really good. Flavor of semisweet wheat, clove, apple and pear juice, turns drier with a slight tartness and grassy hops before finishing with light wheat and estery fruit juice. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. One of the last of the wheat beers from this brewery I've had the pleasure to drink and certainly one of the best ones. Interesting flavor progression with a pleasant play of lightly sweet versus dry elements. The flavors are well balanced and spicing is deftly done. One of the world's great beers. Sometimes I wish there wouldn't be so many interesting beers to sample so I could drink Weihenstephaner wheat beers all the time."

"Pours a bright yellow/straw color with a voluminous, white, frothy head; ample retention and generous wet lacing. The aroma is of clove, straw, wheat, lemon zest, and hints of citric and lactic acid. Some orange rind and hay as well. The flavor is similar with a predominant clove and wheat bastion reinforced by lemon and orange citruses. Some straw, hay, and other light earthen notes comprise the middle. More banana on the finish. The mouthfeel is velvety yet lively with a wet but refreshing finish. A touch of clove and citrus linger. Overall, this is a wonderful beer and a personal favorite. The clove predominance combined with a bit of a “beefier” mouthfeel compared to the hefeweisse makes it a wonderful variation of another excellent Weihenstephaner offering. Well balanced, rich in complexity, and a superb example of the style."

"Overall - This is my first experience with a Weizenbock so I'm not exactly sure what this beer is supposed to taste like. This beer has that Belgian sour taste that I enjoy so much. The malt is also prominent. Other flavors include fruit and spice. What a complex, delicious brew! I guess I like Weizenbocks."
"O: This is really a great beer, and the price is right too. Definitely something I will be drinking again."

"Overall, I love this style and brewery, its definitely nothing mind blowing, or even anything Id probably ever go out f my way to find, but beers like this hold a special place in my heart/palette. Every once in awhile I like to brake away from American hop bombs and go back to a good old fashioned German style anything."

"DATE TASTED: January 24, 2014... GLASSWARE: Schneider Edel-Weisse...OCCASION: celebrating a week of sickness ... APPEARANCE: thick, snow white head that occupies half the glass; cloudy, faint pale orange body; smooth wispy cloudlike lacing... AROMA: beautiful clove and cinnamon/nutmeg mix with grapefruit and citrus to produce a celebration of scents... PALATE: as drinkable a 7.7% ABV as you'll find; soft, warming sensation at the throat; slightly active overall...TASTE: slightly tart at the lips; a clean, ever-so-subtle malty base; a bit yeasty late; unmistakable wheat, clove and citric kick--a pleasure... OVERALL: as far as gift sets go, this Weihenstephaner is among the best in recent memory--five above-the-standard beers and a handsome weizen glass made the price equitable...formidable but balanced, smooth yet arresting, this beer delivers the malt that sets it apart from its gif-pack brethren..."

"Bottle from Gator Bev in Gainesvile. Pours hazy yellow with a massive 3 inch fluffy white head on top. Nice sweet wheat malt aroma with banana esters, spicy yeast, some buttery honey. Just right. Light to medium bodied with lots of bubbly carbonation and a clean crisp finish. Flavor is sweet wheat, funky banana spice and yeast, hay. Very crisp with lingering hay and banana on the palate. I have really started to appreciate these nice and easy drinking classic German brews that Weihenstephaner makes. Cheap, too! Good stuff."

"Get it!"

"O: This is a wonderful beer. For my palate, if the taste were just a bit less sweet (or possibly a touch more bitter to balance the sweetness) it would be almost all 5's. Either way, this bottle cost only $3 and for the price I would challenge anyone to do better"
""
""
""
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. It's a touch boozy, but that's understandable. The balance of smells and flavors, the feel, the whole package. Unlike most beers, as I mentally dissect it, I'm even more impressed by it. Weihenstephaner is, in my opinion, the king of wheat beers, and this is a perfect example of why."
""

""
""

"Very challenging beer, like many of this style. Still, a rewarding one. I would only put Schneider's Aventinus above Vitus for this style. Surprisingly long shelf life, so don't worry too much about the best by date."
""

"Overall - Absolutely delicious. This beer is so flavorful and smooth, it's hard to believe this brew wasn't spiked with a bunch of fruit or spices. One of the best wheat beers I've ever had, and it's not that expensive to boot!"

"This is a very interesting beer, I think I prefer the straight up Hefeweizen from Weihenstephan better, but this is a tasty example of a style that is hard to find."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy, yellow color with a one-finger frothy white head. Wonderful aroma of citrus, banana, and clove. The taste is right in line with the smell. Strong yeast flavors that really bring out the banana and spice. Medium bodied and the carbonation was spot on. Dry finish. A delicious beer - very similar to Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier - that is worth picking up if you see it on the shelves."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this a few times and am a big fan, wanted to do a full review to see how the score holds up. Outstanding looking beer, although not quite to the level of Hefe or Dunkel. Pretty much the same with the smell and taste, very similar but not quite the same, but still very high quality. Overall this is a beer I like very much but have a hard time taking it over the Hefe or Dunkel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright, yellow, cloudy colour. You can actually see the haze forming distinct patterns in the cloudy ale. Crazy. The smell is nothing to write home about. It's grainy, like an adjunct lager. The taste is a whole different animal, though. The grain flavours are so light, that they are taken over by strong notes of banana, cloves, citrus peel, and spices. Are there spices in this beer? The notes are so strong that I would suspect so. These aren't all what I'm looking for in a weizenbock, typically, but it makes for an excellent all-around brew, no question. I'm used to a dominating banana note and a bite from a weizenbock. This has the banana, but too much orange peel, and it completely lacks any bite, which disappoints me a little. The flavour of this beer is typical of Old World traditional brews. Reminds me of a Belgian abbey ale. Those are good, so I can't rate this particularly poorly. I was really looking for more bite in my weizenbock, though."

"Prost!"

"This is an amazing world class beer. I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys wheat oriented ales with intense banana flavor."

"O- Good beer, no complaints about it."
""
""
""
""
"O. I was detracted from the high level of sweetness that I found this beer to have. Generally a good beer, but it seems not as well crafted as some of their others. Their Hefe is tip-top shelf, but this falls short. Worth a try but I will likely pass unless in a share."

"From my tasting notes: It poured a cloudy golden color with a nice full creamy head and plenty of citrus on the nose. The taste had the signature German wheat beer tastes of banana, sweet candy, and a bit of citrus. The Vitus had a very creamy mouthfeel that spoke to its craftsmanship and elegantly balanced tasting experience. This was a great weizenbock and one that surprised me a bit as I didn't know what to expect. The Vitus is a beer to look for and one that will pleasantly surprise any beer lover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light body with ample crisp carbonation that refreshes the tongue with each sip."
""
"A classic Weizenbock that shows real depth and real class in the mouthfeel and use of hefe notes and the deeper darker aspects of the bock. I can't really find much to fault in this beer for the style as it is redolent of bananas and dark fruit with a luscious mouthfeel that really makes you want the beer never to end."
""
""
"O- A nice representation of the style. It's full bodied and has some kick behind it. It has a nice complexity to it while not going over the top, as it is in my opinion that some of these weizenbocks are a bit too intense with the flavors. The beer is well balanced with a nice mouthfeel. Also, it is a great deal for an import with a higher ABV at only around $3-$4 a bottle."
"O: I was thoroughly pleased with this one. It was a bit on the sweet side, but a great beer through and through. Solid in every category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- paid 2.99 for a 22oz bottle. going back to buy the rest. the taste surprised me and I cannot wait to have another"

""
""
""

""
""
"This has so many elements to it and theyre all woven together really nicely, complex spiciness with an earthy element, bold but balanced and tons of intricacies make this a real pleasure. One of the best Ive had in awhile. Enough tartness to counter the creaminess and still has a lot of liveliness to it, and it leaves you wanting more. 4.5"
""
""
""
"This pour is ridiculous it looks like a hazy apricot colored hefe with this billowing head that won't give up, looks great and the label announces that it has been dubbed the WBA 12 World's Best Wheat Beer STRONG. A golden orange glow weizenbock, eh? I'm in the aromatics, hints of sliced fresh apple, baked bread, hints of clove and fruit esters this beer hides the alcohol quite well. Flavor coats the sides of the palate with ample sweetness, sturdy alcohol in the backend, hints of green apple, ripened banana, and spicy clove accents. This beer has some girth to it, definitely a strong alcohol presence the more it warms but it's well woven into a comfortable wheat beer setting. It reminds me a lot of the Glissade Bock Sierra Nevada used to make except this is a stronger wheat version of that style. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying mid way through each sip, even keeled carbonation enough to carry the beer along medium to full but yet comes of drinkable with a slight alcohol burn. Overall, a perfectly good strong wheat beer from Germany, got it in a gift pack for 15.99 with 5 beers and a glass that's value."
"Overall - Probably my second favorite weizenbock, but if you're looking for a nightcap that is very refined and light, look no further than Vitus, made by German brewing royalty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall superb. Again, being my first weizenbock I'm not sure what the standard is but I greatly enjoyed this. Sweet but not cloying. The ABV makes itself known but is far from overpowering. If anything it makes you take your time and enjoy. This is no doubt too sweet for some but if you like witbiers or hefe/dunkelweizens you will love this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an incredible beer I couldn't get enough of it! I wanted more, more, more! A slow sipper as it might be a bit sweet for some, but otherwise beautifully balanced and full of character. Do yourself a favor... Get one. Or ten."

""
""
""

"O - just an outstanding brew from top to bottom, and a perfect way to kick off a day of Oktoberfest celebrating"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've been looking forward to this German classic, and it did not disappoint. It was a joy to drink, and at about $3.50 a bottle I have a feeling I'll be drinking it again soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Vitus is a very nice, paler take on the usually darker wheat bock. Imagine a more flavorful version of Weihenstephaner's top-notch hefeweizen, and you've got Vitus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer. Spicy-er than I originally thought, but really enjoy it and the beer as a whole. Definitely gonna get more. I love the lingerings of this beer. Vitus is probably my favorite from Weihenstephaner."
""
""
"O-I like this beer quite a bit, so my scores are pretty high. However, I question how true to style this thing is because, although this is a delicious beer, it lacks any hint of the typical chocolate or dark malts or dark fruit. Instead, this is essentially an ""imperial"" hefe, or at least a beefed up hefe with more flavor and alcohol. But damn if it ain't good."
""
""
""
"Back up the trucks and stock up the fridge. Great classic beer. A favorite. Savor it and enjoy. They had a 500 year head start on Rheinheitsgebot , imagine what they can produce in the next millennium?"
""
""
"As above, the best beer from an A+ brewery."
"Game changer. What can I say, Weihenstephaner does it again.. The beer is god damn ridiculous. It's just a wheaty, spicy, clovey masterpiece with a slight hint of banana.. But not enough to gross me out, because I hate bananas. Flavor is reminiscent of a Belgian Tripel.. It's a masterpiece. I would drink this literally everyday. It doesn't exactly have the appearance that I prefer (a bit too yellow and clear), but that doesn't matter at all. It's just a wonderful, wonderful beer. Wonderful. This brewery is just genius."

"O - I'm not a huge fan of Weihenstephaner beers, but I think that it just must be the beer styles, lagers, whatever, that I don't like. Because I can tell that this is exemplary of its style. Flavorful and a full bouquet, but not my cup of tea."

"Vitus.Just fantastic stuff but be careful this beer is much to easy to drink with a high ABV-7.7%.I like this better than Aventinus but obviously you can't go wrong with either one."

"O: Relaxing. Very refreshing and easy drinking with a deceptive flavors! Delicious. /90"
"Pours a hazy bright golden yellow, with a very thick creamy white head. Has the look of a great wheat ale. Lots of banana, coriander, and bubble gum in the nose. I'm also getting some faint clove. Very nice smelling wheat. Taste is killer, huge flavorful wheat thats just dry enough but not overly so. Clean and crisp, alcohol is a little noticeably but that entirely fine with me. This brewery has it down pat, they've had enough time and time pays off."
""
""
""
""
"overall: Weihenstepehaner is one of the worlds gerat breweries, never had a bad beer from them. This is basically a stronger version of their Hefe , absolutely phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
"So much estery flavoring, but the malt backbone balances excellently. Very refreshing, and hides the high alcohol content well until the warmth settles in. Wheat beers aren't my favorite, but this is delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice balanced Weizenbock, but the ripe darker fruits contribute a slight sickly flavor that keeps this from being as first class as I expected."
""
"Overall another winner from this remarkable brewery. Not a style I enjoy as a rule but this example won me over. The alcohol was not prominent but it had an effect for sure."
""
"O/D-A neat beer. I had no idea what Vitus had in store for me. I found it to be pretty unique. Like a Belgian Strong Pale Ale or even a Tripel but I find the wheat base to balance and smooth out the flavors. Well worth a try at less than $3 a bottle."
""

""
""
""
"As far as wheat beers go, this is one of the best there is!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A beer which, for me, is swimming in dichotomies. The flavors don't seem to mix all that well, but the toasted malt going up against the esters is both true to style and worth witnessing if you haven't had this type of beer before. A beer that could grow on me. I would certainly like to try it again further down the road."

"O - not what I was expecting but I did enjoy it; but not as much as their dunkelweizen"
""
""
"O - Each category grew weaker as I progressed through the review, which basically mirrored my experience drinking it. Don't get me wrong, this is a tasty beer, and might be better consumed on a crisp fall day, but on this warm summer evening it was a bit much for me. Would absolutely drink again, but would choose the Hefeweizen 10 out of 10 times ahead of this one."

"A fantastic summer afternoon quencher, yea, you want to sit out in the sunshine to enjoy this. Yet this would be great all year long as a great change of pace. A superb brew!"

""

"I think the regular Hefeweizen is the better beer; it still packs a flavor punch but has a lower ABV and the mouthfeel is a bit superior. Still, it is not surprising that this beer is quite drinkable. I could have a few glasses of this anytime."
""
""
"Beautiful pour, my favorite shade of gold. Mouthfeel is delightfully lacking in tartness like most weizenbock's. The taste was better than I'd expected; not too sweet, with a richness that comes out over time (Definitely one to savor). So far I would say this is the most impressive of Weihenstephaner brew's."

"good head dies down to thin layer all across the top. minimal straggling of lacing. light golden color, sort of a deeper version of the color of pear flesh, small bit of haze. nose has a nice scent of pears, but there's also something there that makes me think of soap, which is a bit off-putting. tastes of pears and cloves (hint of banana as it warms), and the soapy smell thing isn't apparent on the tongue. feels good, better than i expected . . . i was expecting something thinner, and thought obviously not a stout (my preferred style), it has a good feel. oh, and the soapy smell issue seems to go away a bit as it warms . . . feel free to comment if you have more info on that."

"500mL bottle, hazy golden colored ale topped with a huge, rocky, white head that holds its retention forever. Malty and sweet aroma with banana, hefeweizen yeast, clove, bubble gum. Bold flavors, bread, banana, clove, hefe yeast, bubble gum, honey, a little nutty. Alcohol is warming at 7.7% abv, some spice on the finish. Huge full body, super creamy and smooth. This is definitely a loaf of bread, but it's so good."

"Top-notch - an exemplary demonstration of the brewer's art. Looks great, with a fantastic aroma/flavour that is true to style. Yeast esters dominate, yet blend perfectly with the malt and wheat characteristics. Smooth, velvety body. A true classic - it's easy to see why it is held in high esteem. I don't often score beers so highly, but this world-class brew deserves the praise. Add this to your must-try list."

"Love this brewer and their beers. This is just another excellent example from them. Perfect flavors and balance, though I do like their darker bocks a bit more. Incredible beer for the price."
"O: I'm shocked that this beer is 7.7% ABV because it drinks much easier. Very enjoyable and refreshing, a top class weizenbock though not as strong as some others."

"Overall, yes: this is excellent stuff, a timely reminder of how good Weihenstephaner are. I love experimentation, and crazy craft formulations, but we should always remember the more traditional extreme beers. This is a fine example of how to make something big and exciting, but also keep everything in balance. Love it."

"The beer is hazy and apricot hued with an inch of white head. The aroma brings banana, clove, spice. Like a stronger hefe with more sweetness and alcohol. The flavor offers a heavy dose of sweet bananas, booze, wheat. While this is good, I much prefer the standard Weihenstephaner hefe. Medium bodied with mild warmth in the finish. Pretty good."

"O: Very well put together beer. One of my favorite styles for sure and definitely purchase one in the future. Not to rich like many complex belgians but just the perfect amount of fruit coupled with spot on carbonation. for me, just about perfect. Reminds me of delerium tremens without the richness."
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: It's Weishenstephaner, if you haven't accepted the fact they are the undisputed kings of wheat beer, you are living under a rock. Another solid offering by them, and well worth trying. Highly recommended."
""
"This poured out as a hazy golden color. The head is white with a pretty good retention but not much lacing at all. The smell of the beer has a fruity aroma, along the lines of peach and banana. Really fresh smelling beer. The taste is also fruity (apple), there is some bready yeast flavors and a subtle spice note in the finish. I do get a slight metallic flavor that I'm not digging too much, hoping that fades as it warms up. The mouthfeel is soft, very smooth with a decent carbonation. Overall it's a good brew, I can see why the score is so high on this one because it really is a great beer. Awesome flavors and really enjoyable."
""
""
"O- very good hefeweizen. Higher abv gives it a nice creamy mouth feel along with typical sweet citrus and spices."
"Initially overflowed the bottle real quick. When poured, the beer is american cheese orange with a solid quilt of fine creamy foam. Smells of clove, butter, wheat, shortbread - nice nose. Flavor is rich with wheat, a touch of nougat, some banana, spices, corn, and a hint of bread. Full bodied with tight, hi carb and an off dry finish. This is a really nice beer, can't understand how I've missed out on this one. Best weizenbock I've had."

"stylistically perfect weizenbock. pours cloudy gold, glowing brightly, with a lasting two or more inches of thick white foam. the nose is slight banana yeast, sturdy wheat malt base, some subtle sugar, and an alcohol kick. the flavor is so balanced, with a mild hop finish that gels with the yeast just right. huge dose of german wheat malt is the perfect backdrop for this drink, and it takes me, like the hefe they make, to somewhere else, Bavaria back in the day or something. its traditional, classy, and strong. actually the alcohol seems higher than necessary, and gives this beer maybe some extra weight, slowing drinkability just a tad. good late winter or early spring drink, perfect with some fresh pretzels, and actually stood up well to salmon on the grill. overall a top notch version of the style, and you absolutely cannot beat the price, under four bucks per bottle!"

"O - Very nice and refreshing; more full bodied than other wheat beers I've had. A pleasant surprise."
""
""
"O - World-Class from start to finish, Vitus' explosive aroma draws you right in, pressing past the foam for the first sip of the classic yeast-rich German brew. This full-flavored and deceptively light weizenbock goes down all too easily. It looks like I've found one of my new favorite, easy to find, German beers!"
"O) And absolutely delightful beer. I'd probably love it even more during the summer on the patio. This reminded me of New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat, which is fantastic. This might even be a little better. I can't recommend this one enough."
"O- Very good beer. Not has wheaty as most weizenbocks I have had, but plenty of flavor."

"Not a surprise, but once again another good Weihenstephaner beer. Just a good weizenbock."
"Overall a really great beer I bought a couple of on recommendation of the salesman at the local shop. Really sits well on a slightly warmer winter night where I wasn't in the mood for a stout or porter."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy light amber yellow with substantial head. Aroma is similiar to the hefeweizen but more so. Delicious brew with orange citrus and pear, banana fruitiness. Lighter than the other weizenbocks I have had but still top notch. I consider Vitus the ""light version"" of the German weizenbocks. I find it particularly good after an aerobic workout. While the draft version is exceptional, in the bottle is also excellent and readily available in the northeast."

""
""
"This was my first weizenbock and I didn't really know what to expect. I had Wehenstephaner's hefeweizen last night and this is comparable except it was more cloudy in appearance, and you can definitely taste and feel the stronger ABV."
"Overall – It is kind of like a souped up hefeweizen or maybe like a hefenweizen-grand cru hybrid. It is great tasting and potent but very drinkable. Rather well done."

"Final Grade: 4.54, an impressive A. Vitus is easily one of this brewery's finest creations, and probably one of the best weizenbocks available anywhere. As much as I love Aventinus, I've got to admit - I kind of like this stuff a bit more. This brew is definitely a bit lighter (in terms of both appearance and taste) and more 'hefe-like', which may or may not be a big part of why I like it. But rather than argue that the oldest brewery in the world isn't following style guidelines, I would rather lie back, sip this slowly, and contemplate how said brewery can make such consistently incredible beer. I guess practice does make perfect? This stuff is absolutely worth a try; no fan of German beer, wheat beer, or beer in general should deny themselves the hedonistic pleasure that is Vitus."
""
"Too spicy, too much yeast and alcohol riding atop a decent body. Where's the Dunkel in this? Cloudy and blonde. I'm not an expert but the definition of a Weizenbock provided by this web site is fitting, so maybe the beer is exactly as it should be, and that's something I can't stand drinking, like a Lambic. At first, I could appreciate that this beer had very unique, defined flavors, but they just don't work for me."

"The beer pours a hazy yellow, much like their hefeweizen with a massive white head with tightly packed creamy bubbles. There is a slight rosy pink tint to the beer, similar to how the hefeweizen looked, which may come from the heavy haze which keeps the other side of the glass obscured from view. Lacing is fat and fluffy, again reminding me of the hefeweizen. Honestly, if I didn’t know better I’d say I was looking their hefeweizen right now, as it and this weizenbok look nearly identical. On the nose, this beer is heavy spicy banana, with more clove than in the hefeweizen, slight hints of bubblegum, and some nice light cream and mint notes. The smell is quite sticky and heavy on the nostrils in contrast with all other Weihenstephaner beers I’ve sampled. The beer tastes wonderfully of banana bread, cloves, and slight bubble gum. The banana flavors are more over ripe than in other wheat beers I’ve sampled. The beer begins with light spicy clove and faint banana before opening into bready banana flavors with slight bubblegum/mint hints and a creamy banana smoothie note. The aftertaste is light with banana. On the mouth this beer feels chewy and creamy, of a medium to thick viscosity, with creamy carbonation on the tongue that really starts to remind me of a banana smoothie. The mouth is left clean, save for a slight creamy ichor of sweet saliva. Overall this is another terrific wheat beer from Weihenstephaner, similar to their hefeweizen but a bit thicker and heavier in the stomach. A classic for sure! Drink this beer."

"O. An outstanding beer. I haven't read enough about this style, and if I didn't know this was a Weizenbock, I would guess it was a Hefe. Either way, it's remarkable, and well worth the positive press I have seen for it. Highly recommended."

"500ml bottle from LifeSource, in Salem. $3.79 Slightly hazy ,deep gold coloured beer with a bubbly half inch thick white head. Very nice strong honey/toffee scent to this, then some phenol’s and laid back spiciness..nice really. Taste is much the same as the aroma but maybe has a bit more fruit in it..again nice. Nice smooth easy mouthfeel..goes down dangerously easy!! Overall a good beer."

"O - I'm assuming that Weihenstephan's Vitus is a weizenbock blending a pale bock or maibock given its color and character. It's really a home run and is another fabulous wheat beer from this brewer. If you enjoy their Hefe-Weissbier than you'll need to pick this up as well. It reminds me of that very hefe jacked up on richness and more of the ingredients I enjoy so much. I'm not sure on the availability, but I was told that it's around in plenty every year when the colder months start rolling in. Just German at its best and simply delicious. Vitus lives up to the label thats equipped around its neck."
"Bottle from Bottles and Bins in Monterey, Calif. The German beers in bottles seem to travel better than the Belgians, in my opinion. Or maybe stores feel the need to refrigerate the Germans?"

"...should be searched out and consumed immediately."
"O: This is what I remembered from earlier in the year, Its a superior beer and my first from Weihenstephan, left a amazing first impression, I'd like to think of it as more of a summer/warmer weather beer, but even now it's outstanding and I recommend it to everyone."

"Poured from 16oz bottle into glass. Pours a hazy golden with thick creamy head. Looks fantastic! Thick foamy lacing and good carbonation. Fantastic banana clove hefe aromas. Some nice wheat malt and some slight slight mild hop. Really amazing aromas. Flavor is crisp bright banana wheat with a slight chewy almost chocolatey flavor. Really great flavors. Its just an all around fantastic brew. Well worth the price and just great flavors and drinkability. For under $4 a bottle, you should all ready be drinking one!"

"Super tasty German beer. A poetic marriage of flavors with a peppery hint on the finish. Awesome!...This is what I expect out of this brewery every time."
"Overall, a great showing from weihenstephaner but not mind blowing. They certainly make the best wheat beers but I actually think their regular wheat beer or the dunkle are comparable to this one. The flavors are a little light for the higher abv but its still worth checking out."
""
""
""
"O: The true alcohol strength of this beer is so amazingly hidden, I would have guessed that it was no more than 5% and it's nearly 8%! Drinks extremely easily and more like a regular hefe than a bock. Absolutely worth trying, especially at the price"
"battle weizenbock this evening goes to Weihenstaphener! Ayinger is really really good but Weihen knocks it out of most parks, including yosemite..."
"O - Simply put, this is the best beer for the style I have ever had, and might just be the greatest beer I have ever had period. Just so very good. My very first ""all 5's"" review, as I don't see how this brew could possibly be improved. I encourge beer lovers everywhere to give this a try if haven't already."
""
""
"Like most other beers in the Weihenstephaner lineup, Vitus is a solid offering. At a mere $3.49 a bottle, this is one of the best deals going. My only complaint is is that this beer failed to exhibit any of the ""bock"" characteristics that are typically found in a well executed weizenbock."
""
""
"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured a hazy golden bright yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sugar, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt banana, bread, fruit, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. All of the right notes that one would expect were going on in this one. This fact made it quite enjoyable and definitely a good start for anyone looking to try something new. All of the flavors and aromas were on-point on this one. This made it quite easy to drink and was enjoyable for all in attendance at the tasting where I sampled it. Definitely worth your time if you have not had it or if you want to try a solid brew in the style."

"Beautiful beer: bright cloudy golden topped by foamy rocky white head. Aroma is sharp: lemons, booze, apple skins. Tastes of banana, vanilla, clove, lemon cookie, and slight booze. Spritzy, medium bodied brew but refreshing and smooth. Gorgeous and tasty, can I ask for anything else?"
""
""
"Pretty much a textbook example of a Weizenbock!"

"The beer pours a hazy straw color with a large white head. The aroma is full of cloves and bananas with a little bit of toffee thrown in. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of strong banana and clove notes, as well as a little bit of pepper. There is a very creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice weizenbock, one of the best I have tried."

"Weihenstephaner Vitus - The bottle says: NA"
"All in all, this is a truly excellent beer. Not only is it complex; it’s light and drinkable--a great choice for warm weather and the kind of beer even the most casual beer drinker can appreciate. And did I mention it’s 7.7%? Kick back and grab one, because my only real criticism is that I haven’t got more left."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a mountainous, rocky white head. Honestly, the gentlest pour is all you need to make a fluffy head that most beers couldn't produce when poured with the utmost vigor. A solid bouquet of banana and cloves serves as a worthy harbinger of what's to come. Banana bread, clove, and wheat meld together to great effect, and the mouthfeel is exquisite. The bountiful carbonation accentuates the spiciness nicely and serves to temper a fruitiness that could become cloying if left unchecked. One really has to search for a fault, but if I'm being picky, there is a very slight metallic taste in the finish, but it's negligible. This weizenbock is more weizen than bock, and that serves me just fine. It's velvety, delicious, and perfect on a hot summer day. One the finest brews from an outstanding brewery."
"It shouldnt be this drinkable for nearly 8% ABV."

""
"Poured from bottle into Weizen glass. Fantastic burnt wheat/orange pour with a monster 3 finger pillow head that hung around a bit. Smell is very fruit forward and floral. Banana, cloves and perhaps a hint of vanilla. Taste is much like the Weih Hefe, but with more power and brunt. Very complex flavors and a great combination of fruits, phenos, malts and wheat. Like a hefe on roids! Feels is somewhat heavy carbonation and dry. Very smooth and coating. Overall- Another great offering and much like the Hefe. New to this style, so don't have a ton to compare it too. I will say, if you like the Hefe, you will like this. Complex and refreshing with a great blend of malts and fruits. A definite must try-"
"Pours a hazy burnt orange, with a giant 3-4 for finger head, lots of disturbed yeast cake floating around the glass. Buttery banana and vanilla slam the nose, a nice citrus profile of lemon and orange peel, and hints of spice, clove maybe some ginger. On the tongue, sweet grain, banana- lemon, vanilla bean, clove spice on the finish. Light bodies, massively carbonated, yet very buttery and smooth, sweet sugar open up all the taste buds, starts moist with a fine dry finish. Overall; fine beer, easy to drink."

"I love this beer."
"nonetheless is beer is solid and defenately worth the purchase."

"overall: One of the best white beers i've had. It tastes like a better version, more strongly defined, as the regular Hefeweiss of Weihenstephaner. It's packed with flavors with only the bit of metal like bitterness as a slight downside."

"Of course, this was surprisingly strong but nothing that detracted from the experience of this beer. I do prefer my Weizenbocks on the darker and more fruity side but like anything else from Weihenstephan, this is about as good as it gets for the particular style and a must-try for anyone who likes his or her beer unfiltered."
""
""
"I'm fully impressed by this one. It was delicious and a joy to drink! Be sure to pick this up if you see it."
""
"OVERALL: I've had a few since my first one and I'm not too crazy about it any more. It's very sound but not brimming with flavour. I think this brewery is a bit overrated on BA."
""
""
""
"O- Weihenstephaner continues to impress."
"Overall - A solid beer, though a bit rich for me to thoroughly enjoy for much more than a beer. Not one I'd session. Good dessert beer, though I'd more likely opt for their Dunkel in it's stead."
""
""
"Medium-bodied with abundant carbonation, it feels slightly prickly in the mouth. Hefeweizen is one of my favourite styles of beer, possibly even my absolute. This delivers much of what I love about a good weissbier in an amplified fashion. Prost!"

"O: A nice brew that maintains a good flavor without falling victim to its abv. And, while I really like the complexity in the aroma and flavor -- man, the feel is very rough. Almost tough to drink. This is good -- but it's far from a go-to for me."
"Overall I want to give it a 4.25 but that is not an option so I am in the 4.5 range as this is so easy drinking, flavors are very pronounced, great balance…a must have! Cheers ~"
""
""
"Having finished this beer while writing this review, I am excitingly buzzed. I feel like my body reacts to the alcohol in every beer differently, and this one brings me up. Perhaps it is the exaggerated fruitiness that tricks my metabolism into thinking I am eating a banana, but either way, it is great. But beyond that, speak strictly about the brew itself, I love the way I am simultaneously blown-away by the big flavors and comfortably enticed by it's balance."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, but the sweetness really detracts for me as I get further into the glass. By the end, my lips were sticky and I wouldn't have wanted another."
""
""
"O: Although this is pretty much Weihenstephaner’s Hefeweissbier with less phenols and more fruit, it’s really enjoyable. I’ve heard that a really fresh bottle is even better, so I’ll be on the lookout; this time, though, it was delicious."

"500 ml bottle into signature weizen glass, bottle code of 1291(mid 2011 bottling). This took a while to fully pour haha. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice 3 finger dense white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some spotty lacing on the glass with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big banana, clove, pepper, biscuit, orange, wheat, bubblegum, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice aroms with good complexity and balance. Taste of big banana, bubblegum, lemon, clove, pepper, orange zest, bread, wheat, earth, and yeast spices. Fairly spicy finish; with lingering notes of banana, citrus, pepper, clove, bread, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Incredible flavor balance of maltiness and yeast spiciness; with great complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with fairly slick and creamy mouthfeel that is extremely smooth. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 7.7%, with pretty much no warming after the finish present. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic weizenbock style. Insane flavor balance and complexity, and extremely smooth to drink for the level of alcohol. This one is definitely better when it is fresher (previous review was with an ’09 bottle)."

"Cheers!!"
"At the risk of sounding completely ignorant, I have to profess my surprise that this is considered such a highly-rated weizenbock. It's more like a hefeweiss. Don't misunderstand me. It tastes great, but if I must consider it a weizenbock, then I am confident in saying that it doesn't hold a candle to Aventinus Tap 6. In my opintion, the lack of a substantial malt character hurts this beer."
""
"O - I’m not usually a big fan of wheat beers, but this beer makes me want to explore way more of them. It is absolutely fantastic. It smells, tastes, and feels terrific with absolutely no sign of the 7.7% ABV. I can definitely see why this was named the best beer in the world at the 2011 World Beer Awards. Close to perfection."

"O: quite a good beer, overall. Flavorful, drinkable, and refreshing."

"Overall: A bit lacking in the darker flavors that are typical of this style. A good overall beer, lots of flavor. The lighter flavors allow the alcohol to shine through a bit more than normal. The carbonation sting lightens up and the flavors blend more smoothly once the brew warms up a bit."

"This is a very unique tasting beer that hides the 7.7% abv very well. Well worth a try."
"Overall this was excellent. I'm not too familiar with the Weizenbock style, but this one has got me intrigued. Top notch stuff"
"Overall: A reasonably price beer that looks, smells, feels and tastes amazing from the oldest brewery in the world. Could a beer lover ask for more? I'd say no. Vitus is an all time favorite and a real showstopper for me. Pick this beer up. You will not be dissappointed."

"Poured a hazy golden orange with a massive, soapy head that just wouldn't quit. Little lacing. Smelled much like its cousin brews: banana bread and citrus and spice and all that. Taste was crisp, with obvious alcohol essence and warmth throughout. Felt comfortably slick in the mouth. Overall delicious beer, will certainly continue to shuffle between this and other Weihenstephaner brews!"
""

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."

"Vitus is still a prime weizenbock. A paler, breadier example of the style. Definitely showcasing the wheat malts. 4.0"
"This is a gem of a wiessbier. Complex and full of depth. Impossibly delicious."
""
"Poured into a goblet from the bottle, the weizenbock registered a golden hue. Its aroma was sweet, bearing notes of banana and wheat. A very appealing scent was recorded. The initial taste was the awesome belgian yeast tang that reminds many of bananas. This flavor alone makes this a great beer, but the taste goes further. Also accompanying the yeast was a mild peppery notes that only served to give the beer a delightfully more complex layer. A hint of honey was even detectable. The sweet notes continued to the finish, at which point the peppery notes became slightly more obvious. The mouthfeel was smooth, being easy on the carbonation. While I like the hefeweiss better, this is still an excellent beer in the price range of almost any drinker."
""
"overall- very solid choice, but be wary. a beer at 7.7% that's this drinkable can be dangerous..."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. I have never gotten so much banana flavor from a beer before in my life and this beer is just very refreshing overall. Will drink again."

"This is an absolutely awesome beer for the Spring/Summer months and could be a substitute for Leffe or Duvel-types in my opinion. Good Stuff!"

"Overall, I think this seems a little more like a strong hefeweizen than a true weizenbock. On the website they describe this as a single bock weizen. It really doesn't do what I think a weizenbock should, which is marry a doppelbock and a dunkelweizen. Nonetheless, a great flavor that I really enjoy!!!"
"Pours hazy golden with an abundant white head. There is excellent head retention. The smell is of malt and also some banana esters, which are both very inviting. There's some malt breadiness and fruity sweetness in the flavor. There are flavors of banana and citrus. This is very tasty. The alcohol kick is not strong in the taste. The flavors do a great job of covering it up. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is fantastic. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is creamy and delicious."

"D - An excellent example of this style. I still prefer the standard hefeweizen over this beer but definitely one to try."
"Overall another great beer I've been pleased with from Weihenstephaner."

"this was a real quality weizenbock. Well balanced with real good depth in both the aromas and flavors. The feel was extremely good"
""
"Finds like this are why I enjoy the exploration of beer. Worth a try. Enjoy."
"O- TOP NOTCH! Not really sure it gets much better than this in this style! An awesome blend of smell, taste and feel!"
""
"O- I really don't think this brewer can do anything wrong. Everything I've enjoyed from them has been nothing short of spectacular. This is no exception."
"Overall a decent beer which a lot of people will like but I just found it crazy sweet."

"Wow. Wouldya look at the name of this brewery? What a mouthful! But would the ‘Vitus?’ be a mouthful I approved of? Well… to find out I poured this Weizenbock out of a bottle into my glass where it quickly formed a billowing head of slightly yellow-tinted foam. The liquid itself was a cloudy, golden, wheat color with lots of rising carbonation. The retention of the head proved to be quite good and it left sliding bands of lacing. The aroma was of sweet malt and some doughy malt, fruity esters, cloves, coriander, honey and a little pepper. The flavors were pleasantly complex yet inviting and very agreeable. I tasted the sweet malt and wheat first with notes of shortbread cookie dough (sorta sweet, buttery and vanilla-ish) followed by the aforementioned spices. The honey and fruity esters appeared in the middle along with some honeysuckle and floral hops. The pepper note combined with the hops towards the end giving it a spicy, spirited finish. I was also totally amazed at how easy it was to drink this beer. 7.7%? Are you sure? The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation on the feisty side. I really enjoyed this beer and think it’s a bargain for the quality it delivers, not to mention the efficacy of its impact…"

"T: Archetypal Weizenbock that showcases complex flavours without sacrificing much of the eminently refreshing, easy-drinking character of a plain Weizen. Worth seeking out."
"O: Like a blend between a tripel and a normal Weihenstephaner; interesting and rewarding. I really really like it. Highly recommended. Will drink again. Superlative example of the style."
""
"Clearly excellent and particularly refreshing example of style ... but not a favorite style for me. Remarkably well hidden alcohol; drinks like ~ 3% ABV!"
"It is remarkable how light this brew feels despite having such bold flavors and higher ABV. If it weren't for the strength of this brew, this would be one I would enjoy again and again on the patio. Still, a terrific brew and one of the best of the style."
"O: A great occasional indulgence."
"O: An extremely drinkable beer, the 7.7% ABV is sneaky considering how light and refreshing it is."
""
""
""
""
"What a classic. I have returned to this one again and again over the years. Quite clear, light gold/yellow body, fluffy off-white, yeast-speckled head, good lacing. Malty aroma with clove and other spices, banana, orange and lemon; faint alcohol. Flavor follows suit, typical weizen notes of spice, yeast esters, banana. Sweet, rich malt character, some citrus notes, and again, light booziness and warming. The carbonation is fairly crisp, body is medium, finish is very clean and quenching. Very high drinkability. Just a delicious and complex beer overall."

"O: A very solid Weizen, although not my very favorite. Truly, it was a little too busy with flavors and sensations to be as refreshing as I'd expect from the class."

"O- A good beer easy to drink, definitely will get again."
""

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good Weizenbock, but it was much more different then all the other ones I have had, I haven't tried much of the style but all the ones I have had prior to this one were much darker and had some roast to it to go with those banana and spicy yeast flavors, so I am little confused by this beer, but this brewery is one of the oldest so it could be that this is what a true Weizenbock is like and the all the american ones I had have took the non traditional road, I am going to have to try more German Weizenbocks to figure this puzzle out. This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth and held my attention, I will for sure be drinking this in the summer. What I liked most about this beer was how complex the flavors were and how good it looked. There was nothing that I didn't like about this beer, it was what it was. I would for sure buy this beer again especially in the summer, and I recommend this to any Wheat beer lover. I liked this beer even though it wasn't what I was expected. Weihenstephaner comes through with a solid beer, but I think I prefer the darker ones instead, either way it was solid and I enjoyed drinking it."

"The best weizenbock I can possibly imagine.  "
"Overall, a very very good beer. Overall score reflects that I was somewhere in between 4 and 4.5 taste wise. Good stuff!"
"O: This is a classic Weizenbock, no doubt about it a great weizenbock that has stood the test of time. I will absolutely revisit this at another time when I am in the mood for it."
""
"O: really great taste, drinks incredibly easily, smooth, just nice all around"
"O: A pretty simple beer but a great balance and drinkability to it. Refreshing, fruity and wheaty."
""
""
"I guess I was expecting something more like Aventinus in regards to a weizenbock. Pretty much a delicious hefe on roids."
"Overall - A dangerously drinkable beer with a great fruity and spicy flavour. You can taste the quality and the beer is a steal at 3$ a bottle. Worth picking up for sure."

"Hazy golden yellow colour, two fingers of white fluffy head, thick lace all the way down the glass. Smell is packed with wheat and banana, spicy notes, clove, corriander, bready malt, sweet caramel notes come and go, faint alcohol deep down. Taste has lots of bready malts, wheat, banana, cloves and other spice, some tropical fruit especially in the finish, some sweet toffee/caramel flavours, more banana in finish and aftertaste. Med-high carbonation, creamy and full bodied, great feel overall. Incredible stuff, ABV nowhere to be found, incredibly drinkable and something I will buy much more of."
"D: Very good stuff. Like tasting the first day of Spring. Refreshing and well balanced. New to this style but enjoyed this very much, and will be seeking out other Weizenbocks."
"O: Another classic from Weihenstephaner, fantastic beer. Would certainly drink this one again."
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Great head, and simple but full nose. Flavor is simple, but very well executed. Very pure and true. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Very hazy lemon yellow colour with a big pillowy white head. Average retention and lacing. The aroma is sweet and estery with lots of banana and fruit along with a slight hint of citrus and spice. Taste follows suit with lots of yeast-derived estery flavors: banana, bubble gum, and apple leads into a crisp finish with hints of clove and pepper. Sweet malt profile throughout. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. A great beer which drinks very well and struck me much like a suped up hefe, and is a bit dangerous in that regard."
"O - These guys have anything ""weizen"" nailed. No need to question, you know you'll be satisfied with anything they produce. Have at 'er!"
"Not what I was expecting from this one, this is a very easy-going hefe, and the alcohol is well-hidden. Nice wheat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty nice and pleasant and refreshing. Kind of what you expect from Weihenstephan."
"OA: very good, i like this german style that sticks to the original brewing law. tastes like high class. well played."
"Body is medium to medium-heavy with modest carbonation, allowing for a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with just a bit of foaming up on the palate. Finish is dry, slightly sticky from sweetness. Instead of being obviously smelt or tasted, alcohol burn is felt in the back of the mouth, throat, after each sip."
"O - This beer is perfectly balanced and impressively delicate (especially considering the relatively high ABV). I am not usually one for wheat beers, but to me this is a beautiful example of everything I like about them while leaving out everything I don't. If I were to pick a beer for a spring picnic, this is my hands-down winner. For me, the Bavarian bar has been set."
"o: pretty frickin good. usually the banannas and clove overpower, but not in this one. blended very well and will recommend to everyone."
"I'll be honest-- after seeing ColoradoBob mention this a bunch in the forums, I decided I had to try it... And I'm not disappointed! Another great beer from this brewery!"
""
"Vitus pours a rich, hazy, straw color. Head retention is minimal; the only thing preventing this brew from getting a perfect score. I would prefer a chunkier foam. It tastes like a beefed up version of their hefeweizen. Cloves, Banana, Bread, with a slightly alcoholic tinge. It's awesome seeing this on a shelf so far away. Prost!"
""
""
"Pours a murky yellow-orange with an off-white head that fades to nothing. No lace on this one. Smell is of wheat, spices, bubblegum, and banana. Taste is much the same with strong flavors and the banana coming through especially on the aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely tasty and easy to drink."
"I actually like this more than the Weihenstephaner Hefe, which I found underwhelming. It's surprisingly drinkable for how malt-heavy it is, and it hides the ABV very well. I'd certainly recommend this as an outstanding weizenbock."
"A weird confluence of Euro styles - in the end, this is really a big-ass witbier or hefeweizen, take your pick, even as the booze laughs off its obvious obfuscation. A wee bit too light for the style, but who am I to argue with centuries to the contrary?"
""
""
""
"I think I need to research the style because this was not what I was expecting, this reminds me of a double hefe if that makes sense, drink it and you'll understand what I mean"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A Weizenbock?? I’m not convinced. I consider Schneider Weisse Aventinus a true Weizenbock, which is why it remains one of my favorites of all time. This one reminded me more of a ""pumped-up"" Hefeweizen than a Weizenbock. Either way, it was pretty darn tasty. I’m glad I have a few more bottles. Weihenstephaner knows how to make some really great beers. Well done!!!"
"Definitely my favourite beer this winter and quite possibly my favourite Weihenstephaner beer."
""
""
"O: Wheat beer with a nice alcoholic bite and amped up fruitiness. Tasty and satisfying. Can Weihenstephaner make a beer that I don't adore?"
""
""
""
""
"If I can keep character and store a couple in my cellar - this beer (most certainly) will evolve into something out of this world..."
""
""
""
"Another great offering by Weihenstephaner. I'll definitely be picking this up again."
""
""
"O)Another winner from Weihenstephaner... do they make a bad beer? I dare say that I may enjoy it more than their hefe, which is a feat. I can only imagine how refreshing it would be on a hot summer day... hopefully in a few months I will be able to find out. Never had a beer of this style with so much restrained balance as this one. It acts like it wants to go over the top and push further, but stays classy in its refined control. Did I mention its drinkability, yeah... its real drinkable!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent Weizenbock, especially for the price. The alcohol content is moderately high for just how delightfully drinkable this beer is. I think it'd be excellent in any season."
"O: Very very good stuff. Spicy and sweet and complex and would pair well with alot of foods, I would imagine."
"Drinkability/ overall- this beer is so incredible when it comes to drink ability i cant tell you its through the roof, never once do i feel im drinking a 7.7 percent beer, overall this is with out a doubt the best wheat beer I have had to date it has the wheat flavors but the bigger body and dryness I look for and enjoy in a beer, this beer is the proof for the non hard core wheat fan of how delicious these beers can be, i enjoy that doesn't have a lot of caramel that some of this style have, one I could drink all night at any time of the year just great stuff cant say enough from a great brewery"

"Overall: This is a truly fantastic example of German simplicity and subtle flavors triumphing over extreme hops or malt. It's truly one to behold. I find that this one really benefits from serving in a frosty mass. The ceramic really syncs with the flavors of the wheat and makes a fantastic symphony."

"If you see it, give it a shot."

"A refreshing, Delicious beer. I expected it would be darker and heavier from the style description but it is not."
"In the end, Its apparent that no one does German beer like Weihenstephaner."
""
""
"O - This is a first-rate Weizenbock. A lot going on in the flavors from start to finish and still well-balanced."
""
"Pours a lovely orange-hued wheat gold. Very good head and carbonation. It has the wheat beer aroma you'd expect, but the alcohol intensifies it. The higher ABV also contributes to the crisp spiciness. Vitus is delicious. I've had Weihenstephaner Hefe a few times already and have yet to review it, though it is a must-try classic. You can tell Vitus is made by the same craftsmen, but the flavor explosion is just a step above, especially good for special occasions. Weihenstephaner is easily one of my favorite breweries - the lager and wheat exceptionally good and sessionable, and the Vitus and Korbinian outstanding for showing how simple ingredients can turn into a thing of pure magic."

"This is the type of beer you would ask ""noch eins bitte!"" Perfect anytime of year, session or with food."

"D- still retains the classic Weissbier characteristic but unfortunately the malty bock quality has subdued to be replaced by a slight buttery quality in the finish. Experiment complete, not one to cellar but probably knew that anyway!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy gold with a thin white head that fades to a thin ring. Big aromas of banana, clove, wheat, and honey. Taste follows the nose closely, very banana-forward. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy, with a touch-over-medium body and lowish carbonation. Overall a great beer, high-watermark for the style."

"OMG -- oldest brewery in the world (claimed) with the weizen bock, old school beer - love it!! A little sweet on the after taste, low carbonation, but mouth feel is good. This one is sweet and I like the hoppy/spicey/dry types generally. But, this one is so nice with a little kick - not so sweet like many of the Belgian beers. A little cloudy on the appearace - I know it's not a Krystall, but not a great look. Drink it as it should not disappoint."

"Before today I'd thought that Aventinus was the pinnacle of weizenbocks. I was wrong."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours a cloudy straw gold color with a couple inch frothy white head that sticks around for a while. There's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like wheat, lemon peel, banana, and cloves. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also the addition of some bubblegum and orange flavors. It's a little sweeter tasting than I was expecting, but that's a good thing in this case. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has good carbonation. Overall, I think it's a pretty good brew. A great deal for just $2.99 a bottle, definitely recommended."

"Gotta try one of the classic German weuizenbocks, right? It pours a cloudy pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light banana peel, light lemon zest, light ginger, honey, and a small amount of clove. The taste focuses on the wheat, but allows some lemon zest, honey, clove, banana, and orange rind in there as well. The body is a rather light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, a pretty enjoyable w-bock, something I could easily see drinking plenty of if put in the proper situation."
"O: One of the greatest beers I have ever had. It is easy to drink and tastes amazing."
"Overal a rather good beer, not my favourite style though. I'd rather have the hefeweizen or the korbinian, not some hybrid."
"O-Wonderful weizenbock."
"T: on the taste the banana is magnificent, the critics and wheat is very well balanced, the end shows sweetbitterness and alcohol presence"
"O - Another beautifully crafted and full flavoured gem from Weihenstephan. A must try for any beer lover."
"Really solid and delicious. Highly recommended."
"O: Overall a good flavor, a bit more sweet and toasty then im used to per style. Smooth yeasty nature, not overpowering, but easily manageable. Alcohol is easily hidden by its sweetness. Cleanly brewed as with all their drinks with a smooth refinement."
"D: As far as I can tell, this one is a bit more rare than some other Weihenstephan brews, but one that's definitely worth trying if you have access."
"O - This is a nice wheat beer. It has a big, heavy body that the taste and appearance don't quite match up with. It is the lightest-colored weizenbock I've seen and I would prefer the extra malt that goes along with the darker interpretations."
"O: this is it ladies and gentleman... Bayerische Weihenstephan has come up with an impeccable formula on how a beer should be made. This beer excels in pretty much every category and makes for an amazing experience. Even better, this beer is fairly accessible so it must be part of your fridge at all times. The excellent combination of flavors/aromas make up for an incredible experience that it's really hard to describe unless you try this beer. Highly recommended and definitely worthy of a 'world class' nomenclature, at least in my opinion!"
"O: 3.5"
"Overall: German beers tend to be too sweet/malty for my tastes, but as far as weizenbocks go, this was very drinkable."
"A wonderful creation. After picking up 3 different bottles of Weinhenstephaner recently, and not drinking anything by them for a long time, my love for German styles is rekindled. Why, oh why have American brewers been trying to ""Belgianize"" their beers? They should be ""Germanizing"" them. This beer is a case in point. Here's hoping for some ""Deutscher Barleywines"" in the coming year."
"Overall a very good wheat brew, but a little thinnner and lighter than expected from a weizenbock. But this is still a stunner and I plan on stocking up (for $3.50 a bottle!!!) with this and their hefe-weissbier."
"A think this is a fantastic beer, but not necessarily a great weizenbock. There's not quite enough melanoidin development in the aroma and flavor to put it quite in the category, but it's still damn tasty."
"O) An excellent example of this classic German style"
"Dr: Easy drinking, high ABV for the style and a high price (4 euro for a half pint!). Decent quality, but a bit dirty. Perhaps the tap needed cleaning?"
"O - A solid offering, a bit lighter than I had anticipated, but the yeastiness seemed to salvage its taste when I was initially concerned upon the less than stellar aroma."
"O - Overall quite good. Very similar to the hefe, but breadier and more intense. Maybe a bit too citrus-forward, but a wonderful beer overall."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Conclusion: This is an awesome beer from one of the best breweries on this planet. This beer didn't blow my mind as many of their others have, but it impressed me as usual. This is like their normal wheat on steroids, my only complaint is that it lacks the outstanding luster and sparkle of flavor that the normal wheat has..."
"Overall this is really good for the style. I like the smoothness of the yeasty flavors."
"What a tasty wheat beer. Layers of the typical banana but seems to have more of a citrus character to it than most big wheats. Pours with a pillowy white lasting head, nice cloudy appearance. Smells of lots banana, with some citrus hidden in the back end. Citrus, clovey finish, hides the alcohol extremely well. Tasty beer."
"O - This is a straightforward and excellent brew from Weihenstephan. Will definitely have this again."
"The craftsmanship and expertise in the style is obvious. This wonderful beer has been excellent for hundreds of years and will be for hundreds more. Take a break from ticking mediocre beers to (re?)discover this masterpiece."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, banana, a small dry banana. In the the taste, bananas for sure and a hint of dry alcohol. A small alcohol like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry banana and alcohol like aftertaste. Light in color and a bit boozy, but nice."
"Overall: I am really glad this beer wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Nice and smooth, an easy drinker."
"M: The mouth-feel is not very hard it is balanced and well done, a medium last ending not bitter not sweet but with some alcohol can be sensed."
"O - not the best in this style but a good drink"
"O: easy drinking and refreshing, no hint of the 7.7 abv, which could be sneaky. would love to come across it on tap."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. I could drink a pitcher of this."
"O - My favourite brew from this brewery. Just as good shaded as the Hopfen Weisse in this style."
"For what this is, I find it pretty exceptional. It's a rigid style but this is satisfying yet sophisticated. It was also reasonably inexpensive. Weihenstephan puts another one in the back of the net."
"Food match: Paired with grilled meats (like a giant leg of pork) it would be akin to paradise (sorry vegetarian brethren). Sided with fried potato, onion and bacon (another German classic), and even a side of Sauerkraut would go well."
"Yum. Extremely drinkable. Less dark than some weizenbocks I've had. Light and crisp and really really well done. I guess when you've been brewing since the year 1040, you figure a few things out."
"O: A great beer by the one's who have a little practice brewing. Like the spicy off shoot from typical wheat beers. Maybe in all weizenbock's? Different. Good. Easily drinkable. Little sneaky (7.7). A must try? Every beer is a must try, but you could still survive still if you missed this one."
"S - Wow. Kind of reminds me of Chorizo De San Manuel upfront. This is the first thing that comes to mind. Weird. If I break it down I cloves, banana rind, and uncooked grains. When stirred up in the tulip it becomes more creamy smelling. There is condensed milk in the nose when swirled in a tulip maybe even buttered bread. In the taste you get wheat, alcoholic yeast flavors, hay, bananas and sugar. Very complex. Mouth feel is smooth and flowing. Decent carbonation and a silky finish. Fantastic beer. If this beer wasn't so high in alcohol I could drink this all night. Hell...next paycheck I'm going to load up because i know my local venue hasn't much more to offer."
"D&O: The drinkability of excellent. This is one of the best Weizenbocks I’ve tasted & will be looking forward to enjoying a few more as we head into the summer months. Prost!"
"A very good brew overall, one which I would definitely buy again."
"O - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down easy and the flavor is great. I Could easily drink these all night long. Overall, I think it is a very nice weizenbock and it is the perfect beer to have on a hot day. I recommend trying this, and I will definitely be buying some more."
"Great wheat beer. The look is golden and cloudy. Great head retention. Definate clove wheat beer smell and clove taste done well. And dangerously well hidden ABV. Where this beer stands out is that it is very thick with quite a bit of carbonation. It works very well and the beer is one to be copied. I personally prefer more banana flavor, but (on sale at 7.7%) this is a good one! 1516."
"O- very very very nice beer. could while away a very happy summer afternoon sipping on these. terrific aroma, with a taste to match. looks and feels good. just an allround good beer."
"This example is highly drinkable and my favorite wheat beer to date. A pleasure to have this time of year and one I'll be enjoying many times over this summer."
"O: Great Weihenstephaner specimen. Refreshing and delicious"
"A very nice Weizenbock, stays fairly light and fruity."
"O: Although not my favorite brew I had (but damn close!!), I simply cannot see a fault with this brew. It looks amazing, smells insanely good, taste is awesome and balanced AND extremely easy to drink and the feel is super light and fluffy while not being watery AT ALL."
"The appearance alone was almost enough for me but it's just not quite there. Excellent fruity and spicy scent but the taste has something I'm not quite there on."
"Mouthfeel is delightful as this dances across the tongue. This beer is definitely alive and encourages you to let it linger for a bit in order to experience everything. Overall, rather light and refreshing in taste, but with a little extra kick from the alcohol content. This is right up there with their more well-known all-star wheat beer. Perhaps a bit more bold and a little more full bodied. Highly recommended."
"O- First weizenbock I have ever had. Reminded me a lot of a hefeweizen with more alcohol and spice."
"O- A great beer, highly drinkable, will definitely pick this up again."
"O: I enjoyed this very much. It is refined and elegant while delivering lots of flavor. Will gladly buy this again."
"Properly cloudy, unassuming golden canary yellow with a frail snowy white head. The aroma overflows with banana and bubblegum, clove, sourdough bread, pear, peach, and bergamot. Unbelievably estery and very enticing. The flavor disguises it's strength all too well, with a bready sweetness and full, round banana fruitiness, a shake of clove, a touch of almond, and a limoncello kick. Very smooth, though it could be fuller. Overall a dangerously drinkable and excellent wheat beer."
"M: Smooth and heavily carbonated but not in a bad way."
"An interesting contrast to another weizenbock like Aventinus, which sits on the other side of the flavour spectrum for the style; demonstrates the great degree of variety to be had within this style."
"This is better than most hefs I've tasted - a great warm weather beer and wildly drinkable for the abv which really goes almost unnoticed. Not my preferred style, but a very tasty brew."
"O: I can't decided which Weihenstephan brew I love more. Needless to say, I'm a fan."
"It still maintains the awesome drinkability and thirst quenching ability from its lighter body counterpart, the amazing Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen."
"O- One of the best beers I have ever tasted. All the usual tastes of a great hefe with the strength and balance of a great Belgium beer. Down right amazing."
"Pours a pale, mellow yellow with a two-finger white head. Decent retention and lacing. Aroma of spice, clove and banana. Big sweet sticky flavor. Banana, bubblegum, clove, sweet orange and lemon juice. Also sweet bread malt. Really big and sweet. A little bit of spice kicks through, but ends with more excellent sticky sweetness."
"A good weizenbock which can be drunk best when the temperature is higher."
"Overall: Very good, but a notch below what I have come to expect from Weihenstephaner. Can session well for the abv. Doesn't motivate me too much to try other weizenbocks, but I probably will anyways. I find German styles interesting, and am really trying to get a good feel of what to expect from them."
"Overall: A great beer and a real hallmark of the style. Full-bodied, complex and tasty; what more could you want. Weihenstephaner has yet to fail me."
"This is my first Weizenbock and its delicious. Nice appearance with an expected cloudy wit look. White head with minimal lacing and fingers. A pleasant floral hop aroma. Very active on the mouth and tongue. A beer I intend to keep in the fridge on a regular basis when I am in the mood."
"The beer was a lemonade yellow color with a huge 4 inch head that was white and foamy. It smells strongly of lemon, banana, clove and wheat. Very pleasant. The taste is strong on clove and spice along with banana, lemon and wheat. There is a bit of yeast in the aftertaste. The beer is light with a ton of soft, bubbly carbonation, it is just a tad warming but I would have never guessed it to be 7.7%. No flaws in this one, it will go well with my german sausage links I just grilled."
"Really mellow for it's strength yet still medium bodied and full of cloves, lemons bananas and even a little apples. Some hot alcohol hits you up front. Slightly tart wheatiness and nice vibrant carbonation. Definetly getting better as I continue drinking and as it warms up a little."
"Good multi bottle drinking beer. Enough flavor to keep you interested without totally overwhelming your palate. Curious to try the Adventinus in comparision"
"No problems finishing this. Good stuff."
"Drinkability/Overall- Goes down smooth and easy. Not as good as the Aventinus but still a dang good beer."
"Amazing balance and subtlety. Doesn't taste 5%, never mind almost 8%. One of the best weizens I've had."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. This beer has some serious flavor nice clove and citrus with a good alcohol warming. It is an easy drinking beer that is medium light with a punch."
"Vitus pours a very surprisingly light golden yellow, with a massive, fluffy white head. It easily fills up more than half the glass, but fades a litle too quickly for my taste. Similarly, lacing left behind is a bit spotty.The nose is extremely powerful, and smells a bit like a hefeweizen on steroids. There's an additional bit of mat sweetness though, to balance out the massive banana and (moreso) clove. The extra malt shows up on my palate as well, as there's an increased vanilla sweetness from having more wheat in the grain bill. There's also a slight warming sensation from alcohol, which is a solid addition to the beer. Still though, this one's a massive clove/banana weiss yeast bomb. The mouthfeel is truly remarkable though. I'm half convinced that Weihenstephan made some kind of deal with the devil to get a body this light on a beer this big/flavorful. Carbonation is almost frantic (without becoming overbearing), and the result is a mouthfeel that is the definition of effervescent. Vitus basically an imperial hefe, as opposed to many weizenbocks incorporating some darker malts, but it's nonetheless world class."
"This to me can be a great higher alcohol session beer. It's extremely tastey and drinkable."
"D - I would consider getting it again. At a 4 dollar price tag I felt I paid too much but drinking it, fully worth the price. If you can find it cheaper I would say pick it up!"
"16.9oz brown bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a murky yellow body with a good two inches of off-white head. Smells like orange, pith, spice, and banana. Banana, pith, citrus, bread, and nut comprise the flavor. Medium to full in body with ample carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden. Very drinkable, pleasant, and complex. An excellent Weizenbock."
"Poured into a Wiezen glass. Nice tight creamy white head and thin lacing. The color is a bright pale straw, hazy and not a great deal of carbonation. The aroma is a characteristic hefe smell with bananas. The taste is bananas and a thick sweet grainy nectar. There is a little spicy note and the malt leave a cloy aftertaste. A great brew from a traditional bavarian brewery."
"Pretty good but if I was Aventinus I wouldn't be too worried about the competition."
"This was a good choice for a drink today where it was pretty warm in Texas. Like I've said, wheat beers aren't a favorite of mine so I won't appreciate this as much as someone else who does like weizenbiers (terrible German-English), but I can tell a quality beer and this one is it."
"D: another world-class brew from Weihenstephaner. Awesome."
"Medium bodied, prickly carbonation and nearly undetectable alcohol come together for a dangerously drinkable beer. This is such an amazing beer, especially for the price point. If only the weather was a bit* warmer out I think I'd be enjoying this even more."
"D - a great way to settle the tastebuds down a couple hours after eating some pot roast and spicy baked beans. do yourself a favor and let it warm a little"
"Sessionable? No... I do advise polishing off (2) Weihenstephaner Vitus' with a nice Kielbasa, or Knish dinner ensemble."
"I poured this one into my Founders snifter. The appearance is a golden, cloudy, murky, dulled orange with a one finger bright white head. It looks near identical to their Hefe. It smells of wheat, yeast, coriander, light spices and some orange. I didn't expect that. It's definitely interesting. It tastes of yeast and oranges with a hint of cloves and banana. It's actually pretty similar to the Hefe. It drinks exceptionally smooth and medium in body. The only knock is that it can be a little sweet at times. Overall it's another good beer from Weihenstephaner."
"The color when poured was a light hazy yellow with loads of foam and some lace of the side of the glass. The smell was of yeast, banana's and a hint of all-spice. The flavor was the same as the aroma. Beauitfully balanced of fruit and spices along with the yeasty bread flavor. Sort of creamy with a sweet/bitter balance that is so pleasant that just thinking about the next sip makes your mouth water!!! What a pleasant surprise."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow, with an inch of fluffy foam. Looks great. Smell is fruity, bananas stand out the most, some citrus and spice. Taste is fruity, a little bit sweet, but in good balance. Finishes pretty dry. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but carbonation is spot on. Drinkability is through the roof, this is a dangerous beer if you have a bunch in the fridge on a hot day. This is probably my favorite beer to drink while outside grilling for some reason. Just something about it. Great brewery, great beer, great price."
"This beer is amazing. The spice plus the banana character makes this mind-boggling delicious. I think this is moving up into my all-time top ten and every-time I drink one I realize just how awesome it is."
"I poured from a bomber into a weizen glass, hazy yellow,/gold with very big head, no lacing. Lots of banana, clove on the nose. Lots of very ripe banana with enough clove for moderation. It has a sweet, lingering finish. This is an easy drinker, a damn fine beer, my new go to wheat beer."
"Cheers!"
"Vitus is very Belgian in character. Sweet, flavorful, drinkable, but maybe a bit out of style."
"Flavor is light hints of vanilla, clementines, and golden delicious apples. All is brought together in a tart just slightly bitter finish which cleanses the pallate for another sip. And you want that next sip. This beer take the Heffe experience and cleans it up into a less wheaty/funky brew. Not that I don't like Heffes, but this is a great brew and style unto itself. And this is an outstanding example!! I want more of these!"
"D - Very drinkable beer, no harshness."
"Poured from a bottle. The beer pours a vibrant, bubbly gold, with a nice fluffy white head, about 1 inch, that dissipates into a thin film over the course of a minute or two. The aromas blast out from the bottle as you pour. Smells of flowers, coriander, and sweet fruit. The beer has a heavy spice forward flavor, with the coriander (and possibly pepper?) riding on top of a round, sweet malty foundation. Bits of citrus throughout, maybe orange and grapefruit, but hard to pinpoint with the spices. The beer is full and bold in mouth, with a transition to a slightly sour, spicy aftertaste. The citrus notes linger through to the end, also, and make your mouth pucker a bit when added to the sour notes. The finish is a bit dry, and makes you eager for that next mouthful. Good flavors and complex mouthfeel make this a pretty good damn beer in my book."
"Hazy straw-yellow colored body topped by thick, rather low white head that slowly recedes and sticks to the walls. Weizenbock is essentially a Dunkelweizen brewed to the strength of a (Doppel)bock, however, the pale visual appearance of Vitus is reminiscent more of a Hefeweizen than Dunkleweizen. Aroma is Doppelbock-like sweetness with banana esters, clove phenolics and bready malt. A careful sniffing session reveals plum & raisin-like fruitiness that gets more prominent as the beer warms. Very faint alcohol shines through. Flavor is rich sweetness (suggesting the malt hasn't beet fermented thoroughly) with banana, clove and wheat. Hop flavor is virtually absent and the finish is somewhat balanced by light hoppy bitterness and very faint alcohol. The palate is sweet, body medium-full with very smooth creamy texture and moderate carbonation. As stated above, the appearance of Vitus resembles a good Hefeweizen although it is easily distinguished from the later by having a minor head and fuller body. There could be more melanoidin & dark fruit character but it's a very decent beer nevertheless."
"Overall- Goes down smooth and easy. If you havnt noticed yet, I much prefer this to the hefe, which I find almost cloying. I could easily drink a few of these. Recomended, I have the aventinus up next, we shall see which is better."
"This is my 100th review and I am proud that it is such a great beer. Weihenstephaner makes so many great beers, everything I have tried from th has been phenomenal and this is no different. I recently tried a few weizenbocks and can now say that this is my favorite. It pours a hazy dark gold color with a tall off white head that slowly dissipates, leaving some lacing in my glass. Smell is mostly wheat, but there also notes of banana and clove. Taste is similar, complex with wheat, bready malt, banana and clove notes and a touch of hops. It is sort of fruity and spicy but the backbone is still the wheat. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy with average carbonation. Drinkability is superb. This beer is everything I love about Hefeweizens, Dunkelweizens and Maibocks rolled into one, balanced perfectly and with just the right mouthfeel. Great beer!"
"D- This beer is a winner- I can't believe I didnt try it until now- The overall profile is very similar to this brewery's hefe weizen-only its the imperial version- the broadness of the weizenbock style never ceases to amaze me-but if there were a classic example-this would be it!"
"D-No way this is 7.7% ABV.Extremely sessionable."
"Drinkability (3.5): Very tasty but the flavors are strong and there is a bit of booziness that lingers in the mouth although never that discernible in the taste. I could put these down quickly but would be feeling it just as quickly."
"D - Feels like a lightly caramelized Hefe and perhaps, slightly more phenolic and definitely heavier; you can't go wrong with drinkability on a Weihenstephaner with their world class flavors and feel. However, if I wanted something more refreshing, I will stick with the brewery's Hefe Weissbier (4.5)"
"Cloudy lemon color with a very large head that held on for a long time. A weizenbock that looks identical to a hefeweizen instead of being much darker. Just a little lacing is left on my weizen glass. Big, brassy, hefeweizen aromas here. Hints of banana, cloves, and a little granery dust aroma. Flavor is huge wheat beer. Bananas and bubblegum with just a small dose of cloves. If you are a fan of weizens, then this beer is a must for you. A little darker malt may have complimented this beer further, but it is quite sucessful as is. One of the more fuller wheat beers I have had. Carbonation is just a tick low as it seems just a little flat, but otherwise has a nice texture. For some reason this beer does not make it to the Minnesota market. I wish it did."
"This is balance well for all the banana emphasis, but I'm surprised by the lack of any clove phenols. Doesn't seem too much of a Weizenbock, it's pretty tame."
"Notes: This one is worth picking up and can usually be found for a great value. Complex in every aspect, yet simple enough for even the most inexperience beer drinker to enjoy."
"Drink- Im going to keep this in the rotation. Cant believe i've never tried this before as I just picked it up on a whim."
"Overall, what was best about this brew was its classically Weizenbock aroma. It contains all of the sweet and wheaty characteristics anything in the style should and, while admittedly complex, maintains a delicious simplicity to the flavors. What was curious, if anything, was the huge attention to esters, with the specificity of ripe bananas, which were observable at nearly every turn."
"The Vitus is simply superb."
"Tastes medium-sweet with nice spiciness as a counter-point. Strong carbonation helps keep the sweet from sticking. Clove, nutmeg, and canned pear syrup. Finishes with a sharp sting from the carbonation. Meh drinkability. Light body."
"Overall: This is a great beer. I am a huge fan of Weihenstephaner, and a huge fan of weis beers, and this beer confirms why. It has a wonderful aroma, flavors that are balanced and elegant, and a nice crisp, dryer finish. Though there is a tinge of alcohol on the finish, it is hard to believe the 7.7 percent alcohol labeled on the bottle. Once again, an amazing beer by Weihenstephaner."
"M/D: Perfect carbonation here, this beer drinks like water."
"D- I wanted a good Weizenbock for the cold weather I was leaning towards Aventis, but then I saw this. It's definitely worth a drink."
"I've been wanting to try this one for a long time, even though it's not my favorite style, mostly because of Coloradobobs. Pours a pale yellow color with a hazy golden hue in the center. Large white tops things off and recedes slowly. Typical wheat beer smell, mostly banana and clove, with a touch of pale malt and slightly hoppy/herbal background, but this mostly about the sweet wheat. Taste is wonderful! Delicious citrusy notes, banana as in the nose, with a touch of alcohol and perhaps some licorice on the dry finish. I really like that this weizenbock is not a dunkel variety. This tastes like a standard Hefe with the flavor and booze ramped up just a few notches. Carbonation is a bit high at first, but it starts to settle down mid-glass with some gentle swirling, medium body. Good stuff here, very drinkable despite the high(er) ABV."
"Vitus pours a hazy golden color,also starts out with a nice head.The taste has cloves and banana flavor with a small hint of lemon.THis is a beer I could enjoy all evening, as far as drinkiability.I also like the design of the labels on the bottles too.Hey I can dig it.Great beer for any time of the year."
"I was at one with the world while drinking this beauty. The 7.7%ABV just sits within the flavours without being noticed, a truely amazing and one-off beer (as ColoradoBobs has been telling me for years)."
"Drinkability for ya boy ain't the bees knees if ya feel me. For me, ya boy, it's a bit too potent in the banana area. See, bananas are just too damn bland for me. I like my fruits to be pippy and tasty....not long...ya feel me? Yeah, you feel me. This is a review that you should take zero advice from though, as it's a well loved beer...I just don't like penis fruit!!! *blasts Take Me, I'll Follow You*"
"Summarizing - It poured from the growler with an initial swell of soft, creamy head, but it soon deflated, leaving a thin misty blanket of suds on top of the, as I mentioned, autumn-orange tinged body - hazy bordering on cloudy. Fresh-baked, doughy bread aromas with faintly sticky navel orange notes as well. The alcohol is wonderfully obfuscated in the aroma and the taste, too, not even causing much of a stir in the finish. The moderate, yet assertive, breadiness and esters balance out superbly, really forming the backbone of the taste. Tartness from the wheat kept in check, just about a whisper. And as I also said, the best in every facet of this beer comes to the fore when it's lost its chill. A wholly satisfying, smooth and hearty feel, at the same time finishing light and refreshing for the style. Let it warm - to where it's actually almost warm - and you'll get the most out of it. Quite enjoyable, quintessentially German."
"D-This is a nice wheat beer and easily drinkable and refreshing."
"Enjoyed around a bonfire on a warm November night in Ohio. This beer pours a surprisingly pale and fairly clear yellow with a thick, pillowy head. This was the first time that I've had this beer and was surprised by how pale it was. Aroma is of strong banana, clove, and wheat. This is one of the best smelling beers that I've had, not very surprising for a Weihenstephaner wheat beer. The flavor is similar to an imperialized hefeweizen. Strong banana and very strong clove. Wheat is present but is not as strong as the regular Weihenstephaner hefe. Just a tinge of faint cocoa is noted at the end of the swallow. Simply fantastic. Drinkability is incredibly high for a 7.7 abv beer. It's hard to drink this beer slow it's so good! Highly recommended for hefeweizen lovers."
"I really want to try a fresh bottle of this again because I love wWeihenstephaner and it just didn't seem right."
"Chad"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Another fine offering from the world's oldest brewery."
"Verdict: Excellent and super-well-priced brew. Must find."
"Moutfeel has a medium body feel to it but is slightly sticky and chewy. Overall, this is one hell of a beer and a classic example of the style."
"Drinkability: Came for the weizenbock, stayed for the frankenstein hefeweizen. A bold beer, fans of either style should try this."
"Note after about an hour the remainder in the glass was a little limp and lifeless. Still, A-."
"Drink- If it wasn't a 7.7% and me carving pumpkins all night I would have had another one. But big ABV and big knives don't mix."
"Cloudy straw yellow brew gives a velvety smooth white head 3"" in height that settles slowly to leave a bit of lace behind. Smell is zesty and a little sour with wheat spices and sharp citrus. Taste and feel is like a concentrated hefeweizen- a bunch of astringent banana peel and warm clove with a pleasant alcohol spice, moderately thick and mostly dry body with a robust and slightly fizzy carbonation. Unmistakably German."
"Very good beer, but seems very filling, and is a little too harsh for a wheat beer in my opinion. Doesn't match the mighty Hefeweissbier, though the flavor is pretty close, I prefer the subtlety and easy drinking of the Hefe."
"D - Everything their hefeweizen is and more - a wonderful beer all around, and a new favorite. I would buy this by the case if I could."
"Drinkability - I couldn't keep the smile off my face as I drained this glass. It was more like an uber-hefe than a weizenbock IMO as I got none of the traditional bock characteristics. Since their hefe is one of my all time favorites though and this was that just more of the same I have to give this a gigantic thumbs up."
"I've had several of these brewery's beers and this is right in line with my expectations as regards their quality"
"Super drinkable, very tasty and, overall, just a well-crafted wheat beer. One of the better wheat beers I've ever had actually."
"D-Another genre-defining beer from Weihenstephaner."
"O - Another great beer from Weihenstephan, almost on par with their best (the hefe). Factor in the price and it's certainly something to seek out."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a weizen glass. A cloudy dark hay like color. Aroma is of soft banana. Banana and clove flavors with a light spicy hop character. Just a hint of citrus. Some bready malt pulls through and over all there is little bitterness. Alcohol is tame but there. A hell of a beer, almost like a Hefeweizen on steroids."
"transparent she is not, but at first sip, all of her mysteries are revealed: the strong wheat malt, the veluptuous mouthfeel, and the sexy spices. She is also quite the dominatrix (7.7% alc.). You'll lose control in no time (and be okay with it)."
"Drinkability - I am a slut for this beer. I could drink this forever and probably die of alcohol poisoning in the process because the alcohol is hidden so well. Well worth the hype."
"Pours an extremely beautifully cloudy golden-hay color with nice white head. Scent is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Such amazing clove, banana, apple, and peach scents that are crazy bold for how cold this beer is right now. Can't imagine what it's like warm. Taste is just as it smells...I think I just fell in love. Why have I never bought this beer before??? I always pass it up. Needs to have more hype if you ask me. Such amazing fruit flavors...I'm getting green apples, pears, peaches, melon, and white grapes. I also get bold clove flavors with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is very crisp due to the nice carbonation and drinkability is EXTREMELY HIGH! I'm very shocked with this beer right now."
"Will definitely be drinking more of this."
"D: A fantastic beer; its drinkability belies the relatively high ABV. A pint bottle of this has me feeling it. I can't wait to get more of this throughout the fall."
"A truly well-balanced and well done beer. A bit too hefty in ABV for drinking in large proportions. Sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"For some reason going into this beer I thought a weizenbock was gonna look like a hazy doppelbock, boy could I be more wrong. Golden yellow/orange with a generous egg shell hefe head. Looks like a hefe but much stronger smelling. Tons of banana and pear. Much the same with taste with yeasts and some spiciness from the alcohol. Lucious creamy mouthfeel, very solid and drinkable. My first weizenbock and an enjoyable experience, just like a hefe only stronger in all aspects."
"Surprised by the light color of this; it's a hazy, hay yellow, and develops a substantial, fluffy head. Smells fantastic, with something pretty sharp in there, almost sour-like. Taste is like a snowballing hefe in that it seems to build in shape and momentum as it goes down. It's got a big kick, yet ends pretty light, thanks to the high carbonation. It has a wonderful effect, where the snap of yeast combines with the bubbles to give an attention-grabbing finish. There's really not a tremendous amount of flavor on the front, but it really picks up mid-way on. The body is boisterously fluffy, reminding me of Belgian strong pale. There's a slightly sweet aftertaste, as well as some fruit notes, possibly pear or apple. This is an amped up hefe if I'm not mistaken, and it's likely my first. Somehow I doubt I will drink another one that surpasses or even rivals this one."
"Finally saw this beer while down in Iowa, so picked one up. Kind of different than other weizenbocks I've had, maybe a little more straight-forward sweetness and less fruit and clove than others. Maybe it was a little older, but still quite tasty."
"Hazy honey/ amber. Creamy white head on top. Average smell for style. Very light. Doesn't reveal to much. Tastes of clove, light malt, some wheatiness with some dark fruitiness. A little alcohol present in this one. Very drinkable. Could definitely get into a few of these a little too quickly. Cleam mouthfeel crisp."
"Price = $3.50"
"A worthy beer and warranted to gain cult status. Not one flavor tries to steamroll another, which makes it dangerously drinkable. Just fine on its own, but begs to be paired with a full-on cheese fondue of Emmental and Jarlsberg, and a crusty baguette."
"Drinkability: High quality. This is superb beer, and it proudly showcases the craftsmanship of its brewers. Vitus is a testament to Weihenstephan's longevity in the beer world."
"D-very drinkable, i could drink a lot of these in a sitting with a smile on my face. the taste stays, its wonderful!"
"Drinkability what do you mean this is 7.7% no alcohol is present whatsoever it's a bit too carbonated for me but I could easily down many of these. Well worth the 3$ price tag, hell I'd pay 7$ for one and it'd still be worth it"
"After looking for this one in NC for over a year with no luck, I turned to wagenvolks for a bottle. 500mL bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a murky pale yellow with a very frothy off white head that lasts and leaves slight laving on the glass. Aroma is loads of sweet fruits, banana, and spices. The taste is a nice amount of sweet fruits and malts with a nice side of spices, nice and complex. The beer is very smooth and crisp with nice carbonation and well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable Weizenbock, very true to style and quite tasty!"
"Overall, this is an excellent Weizenbock and highly worth your time to hunt down if you enjoy wheat beers!"
"Pours an extremely foggy dark gold to light amber colored body, topped by a frumpy white head with excellent retention. Its aromas are very spicy and wheaty. Tons of cloves hit my nose right up front, with subtler nutmeggy notes, and the promise of sweet wheat to come. Taste is delicious beyond delicious, practically want to you close your eyes and purr. Rich flavors, but none of them unruly or overbearing. Taste is almost entirely consistent with the nose except that dark fruit notes, like plumbs or dates, enter the mix (especially on the finish). Body gently unfolds upon touching the tongue, going from lightly tingly to luxuriously creamy and mouth-filling, all within the space of a second. One of the best slow-sippers for reading a book or enjoying a nightcap that I've encountered. Positively delectable."
"Notes: Definitely not like other weizenbocks that I have had, seems more like a bigger hefeweizen. Overall not a bad beer, but it wasn't entirely balanced and not what I was expecting. Not a bad beer, but I was expecting a bit better given the track record of this brewery."
"about 2 is tops on this. a great tasting beer, but the combination of it being full bodied at +7% alcohol is going to knock it down a bit in this category."
"A fantastic brew. This one should be enjoyed best by itself to appreciate the complexity. Beware the alcohol content, as it sneaks up without a hint of it's presence. Well worth trying for any beer lover out there."
"D: so far to put this the easy way i have not found a Weihenstephaner beer i don't like. this was a very easy half liter."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice beer- basically a stronger version of Weihenstephaner's regulkar hefe as opposed to a beefed-up dunkelweizen. Still a great beer- the stronger alcohol adds a new dimension to an already great beer. I'd have this again, and would definitely recommend it."
"Overall, I really dig this beer. I expected it to sit a lot heavier than it did."
"Enjoyed on many occasions at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Cloudy opaque straw yellow in the glass with a large white head that retains nicely. Fruity, mildly phenolic and bready aroma, this smells just like baking banana bread and ripe lemons. The aroma is wrapped in a leafy hop character that comes out more as the beer warms. On the tongue it's spicy, peppery, bringing to mind pureed banana with white pepper and clove. Moderate bubblegum sweetness leads into a spicy and dry finish. It's surprisingly drinkable and even refreshing for a 7.7% beer, which may be the beer's most impressive attribute. While I prefer Weihenstephan's more subtle and light hefeweizen, this is very enjoyable."
"D - This was pretty easy and enjoyable to drink, but with the half-liter serving size and the deceptive ABV I'm not sure it'd be a good idea to have too many. The bottle price is a huge steal if you can find it fresh."
"I could have one, or drink this beer all night, either way I'm a happy camper."
"Insanely drinkable for a relatively high abv beer. I can see having a few of these in a bar would be a bad idea. Sitting at home I could probably have severa l in a sitting and seem fine, then pay the cost the next day. However, I just don't find this to be that compelling of a beer. Too bad, as I'd heard a lot about it and was rather jazzed to discover it around here."
"Its hard to believe that this beer cant be found around here where I live.First thing I noticed after pouring into a Aventinus glass is how light it is compared to others of the style,almost peach-like in color with a great creamy top.Aromas of mild clove and banana,a tinge of honey sweetness as well,no alcohol trace to be found.A vey creamy feel really is nice,almost airy in nature.Flavors of chocolate dipped bananas and clove,a lightly toast wheat malt flavor comes in the finish.This is traditional and not in your face,I like them in your face usually, but this is really a great brew."
"This is not a Weizenbock and that is the biggest issue for me. It was also out of balance for the style and was just way too wheaty with not evenough malt balance. Not my favorite style, not my favorite beer, and definitely not typical of the style. If you want a Weizenbock, stil to Aventinus, it's perfect, why mess with perfection."
"Drinkability - Pretty good."
"Lighter than Aventinus and not quite as good, but still a really enjoyable weizenbock! More on the hefeweizen side. They've got this for a good price down the street now, so you can bet that I've already stocked up."
"Drinkability - I really like this beer. I am a true Hefe lover, but this variant will be on my short list."
"D: I think I still like their regular Hefeweizen a bit better, but this is still a great beer. I might have to pick up a few more bottles."
"The flavor is very much like a bigger version of thier hefeweizen. Lots and lots of banana and cloves, I do get alot more alcohol in this one. Really it is a terrific beer. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Nice creamy mouthfeel with just a slight alcohol presence. Quite drinkable."
"Apparently, the weizenbock style has some interpretation, depending on brewery. Aventinus seems to sway to the bock/doppelbock side, whereas this seems to stay on the weizen side of the style."
"I love Aventinus, but until now, other weizenbocks had been somewhat of a disappointment. This reminded me a good deal of Aventinus, and will certainly be something I buy again."
"D: Pretty drinkable despite the high alcohol percentage"
"Overall, this beer was a bit of a surprise. I know Weihenstephaner does good things, but I wasn't expecting to like this brew as much as I did. Definitely worth picking up and I think I'm going to check out a few more of their brews after having this one."
"a tad bit boozy, but its not a harshness that hinders too much, but rather adds to the complexity. the sweet vanilla and bready flavors balance out the spicy yeast characteristics nicely. a wonderful brew that helps to define what I love about beer."
"D: i could take 2 or 3 of this one"
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of spices and fruits. Taste is great, banana, other fruit, spices, very complex, alcohol is well hidden. Feels full bodied and delicious in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a very high quality beer."
"Overall, this is a dangerously drinkable beer. When compared to the likes of Aventinus it reminds me of just how much diversity there can be between quality beers within the weizenbock style."
"Highly recommended."
"F: Slightly sweet on the finish lingering, but sweet malts not syrupy at all. Semi bitter with a little orange peel, lemon zest and citrus. Banana as well with more wheat lingering. A slight lingering alcohol burn actually comes through. Finishes pretty clean and quickly. A little vanilla is really long as well. Again very similar to most Weihenstephaner beers but a little heavier, darker, and boozier this one. This one also finishes slightly sweet rather than dry."
"D: Well worth the drive to Campbelltown. I should have taken a growler home with me. The idea of a hellesweizenbock has grown on me."
"D- Reminds me of a really good, German weizen with some stronger notes of clove and a bigger alcohol presence."
"Too drinkable for its strength. This is a good brew that went down rapidly."
"Quite the Weizenbock, Weihenstephaner's Helles version of the style is much more refreshing than more traditional examples and is extremely well-balanced, never too strong in any region except for the flavor front, in which such a balance between taste and drinkability is a powerful virtue. Perhaps one of the greatest Weizenbocks around, Brauerei Weihenstephan never ceases to produce solid, well-crafted and tasty beers while remaining in strict (well, perhaps not so strict -- we are talking about wheat beer, after all) accordance with the Reinheitsgebot. Vitus is flat-out amazing, and well worth all its praise."
"d: Not bad, but not what I hoped it would be either. Glad to have easy access to other examples of what is rapidly becoming a favorite style of mine."
"Value: GREAT. Far better than beers way more expensive in the style."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Light hazy amber color, yeast left in bottom of bottle. Medium bodied and strong carbonation. Nose is a spicy yeast. Flavor is sweet spices, lemon and yeast. The best weizen bock I've had (at least 10), it beats Schneider Aventinus. $3.25 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"D: The smell, taste and body of this beer make this a true winner to session with. Can't think of one much better for the spring/summer."
"D: The alcohol is very well masked and it's extremely easy to drink."
"d - I liked this weizen a lot. Great smell and taste and the only thing that really hurt it was the high carbonation. Would definitely have again."
"Not my favorite style, and not my favorite beer, but typical of the style."
"D= Wow, this beer is world class for sure. One of the most amazing things that has touched my lips in a while. A truely amazing beer. Now I just gotta find a place in MN that sells it."
"Overall excellent beer."
"Vitus - great value@ 2.99 for a 16.9oz bottle, a good tasting weizenbock overall"
"Overall this is a fine beer that I would definitely order again at a bar, but probably wouldn't stock my fridge with."
"Similar to Ayinger Weizen-Bock."
"Great, creamy mouthfeel. This a a very well crafted beer, but it's almost too intense to enjoy more than one."
"Overall, this is a very good beer that I wish I had tried sooner. I will certainly be having it again, and so should you."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy."
"Has a opaque light honey color with an initially thick bubbly and foamy white head. Aroma was pretty strong in sweet grain and malts. Taste was a mix of spice, cloves, some banana bread, and alcohol. Great carbonation and thickness. I could drink these anytime."
"D - Excellent drinkability. This is the kind of beer I would love to have with brunch on a nice spring morning."
"I love this beer. It's one of my favorite German beers. It drives me crazy that I only know 3 places in Berlin to buy it, and two of them are bars. It's probably not the best beer if you want to drink a lot in one night, as it's slightly heavy, but in terms of Germany's ""exotic"" beers, i find this one the best."
"One of my favorite wheat beers, Vitus is a triumph of Bavarian art."
"D-very refreshing after a hot day, even with a higher ABV this is a very drinkable beer and one I would gladly drink again"
"Wonderful Weizenbock with pleasant and is very drinkable."
"This one is absolutely top. Beer as it should be."
"Drinkability: it's tasty and feels good, but it also is really hitting my gut like a bomb. Usually heavy beers don't disable me like this, but this one does. Otherwise, a very nice beer indeed."
"Na Zdravje! (or, in this case, Prost!)"
"Cheers!"
"D-this is very tasty, the flavor is slightly watered down compared to the nose but still extremely solid. great flavors working well together with a touch of alcohol in the finish. I like it a lot!"
"This is a fine, fine beer. It suffers in my mental perception for not being a worthy opponent to Aventinus but ignoring that very different weizenbock will allow you to enjoy what VITUS brings to the table."
"I can't say I've had too many weizenbocks before (Victory Moonglow and Weyerbacher Slam Dunkel are the only two that come to mind), but this beer really is flavorful and full of character. I'd recommend this beer to anyone who is a fan of the style."
"D: This is easy on the palate. Crisp, smooth, refreshing, tasty. I could easily drink some more of these."
"Nice to drink on a weizenbock starter brew day :) for inspiration...less sediment than expected, may not be the best candidate for a yeast harvest, I would use Sierra Kellerweis before Vituss..."
"Wow. Absolutely terrific. Poured up a pale yellow colour with a bit of cloudiness; almost white around the edges when held up to a lamp. Head is loosely-knit white suds that fade away after a few moments leaving only a blanket of frost. Smell is an explosion of spice with a bit of an earthy mustiness. Very nice. Taste, too, is big spice with a bit of bitterness towards the finish. This drinks a little bit below the advertised 7,7% and has a moderately carbonated mouthfeel. A very, very solidly crafted Weizenbock and a well-built beer in its own right. Impressive."
"Pours a cloudy, maize color on top and a hazy, pale yellow on bottom. One and one half inch head of a white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, hops, citrus, clove, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Weizenbock. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, citrus, and slight tart malt. Overall, good aroma, blend, body, but too much effervescence."
"meant to get a dunkles but this is nice to have a around especially at 7,7abv"
"Pleasantly drinkable with a full flavor profile. Too easy to drink for the 7.7% the bottle boasts."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a thick, if not too persistent, fluffy white head. Aroma is strong, yeasty and a little lemony with malty and rubbery hints. Refreshing flavor is crisp, malty, yeasty and lemony with a hint of hop bitterness. Texture is strongly tingly, yet it slides smoothly down the pipes. It leaves a nice tingle on the tongue and inside the lips."
"Poured into an Ennglish style pint glass. The appearance surprised me very light for this style. Very cloudy pale yellow with a big creamy white head that hangs around for a while before going into a thin film with minimal lacing. Bananna and clove aroma with some breadiness to it too. Sweet taste with bananna and clove with a citrusy finish. This was good to drink but a bit of surprise since its a lot more weizen and not much bock."
"Overall this was a surprise. Not only for the deviation from style color but the taste and aromas as well. The complex blend of wheat sweetness and maltiness characteristic of a weizenbock but keeping it light was exquisite. Great for a fall day in the Midwest!"
"D: Overall, a very enjoyable brew. It doesn't quite have the flavor complexity of Aventinus, but that shouldn't stop anyone from picking this brew up and giving it a go."
"Beer is medium bodied, has a nice wheaty flavor and a slight aftertaste that adds to the overall feel of the beer. Carbonation is big in the mouth and does a nice job accenting the sweetness of the beer. Drinkability is high, another wonderful beer by Weihenstephaner. It is truly great. Mouthfeel is good. Its a great beer. Weizenbocks have a tendency to get offensively sweet, this is not the case with this beer. You can taste the esters and there is some underlying sweetness but its not the star, its there to accent the wheat. I really enjoy this beer."
"O: Unexpected alcoholic heat distracts me too much from the nice flavors and glorious mouthfeel. Even so, as usual, the World's oldest brewery has a solid beer on their hands. This example still hasn't convinced me that 'big' wheats work."
"Drinkability was good. Little signs of aby but has a great flavor."
"This is ridiculously drinkable. I could have multiple more. The alcohol is well hidden, hard to believe it is 7+%. This is just a great beer."
"D - outstanding. delicious and none of the other attributes take anything away from it. could have a 'few' on a nice warm summer evening."
"D: The balance is alttle strange, as many have said, this tastes like a hefeweizen on crack. I personally find the strong banana and fruit flavors very appealing. This is one of my favorites, and something I buy regularly, it's also pretty affordable."
"Drinkability: Dangerous. High alcohol content, but I can drink these over and over again. The price is right here in Germany. (About a dollar per bottle when purchased by the case) I dread how much I'll have to pay for this when I return home to the States...."
"Pours a very hazed golden peach with a monstrous head of foam, which very slowly dissipates, leaving behind some very nice lacing. Lots of carbonation rushing to the top, and this continues for some time. The aroma is of a multitude of yeasty esters, the primary ones being--not surprisingly--clove (the most prominent), banana, and bubblegum. The taste is similar, but there is a certain cloying sweetness as well. A bit of the wheat seems to be coming through in the taste, although the mouthfeel is a little thin, so it's not coming through in that regard. Drinkability is quite high, especially given the high abv, which there is no trace of in the taste or mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Went very well with a meal (Chicken cacciatore) and I'm thinking one 500ml bottle is enough for an evening. Not my favorite Weizenbock but it is good and I think it has potential to work well with a lot of other food. I'm wondering though if I stirred up the sediment and drank that too if my experience would be better. I've had Germans tell me this is the thing to do, and others tell me I'm nuts to do it. But I do notice a taste difference between the two routes so I'll have to try it again."
"1204"
"Drinkability: Another really clean beer from this brewery. I love the lightness and the banana taste. I will be having this again. The alcohol is barely noticable."
"Notes: This was my first weizenbock, and I'm very pleased. I found it to be very similar to this brewery's hefeweizen, with less banana flavor and a slightly richer flavor and body. The hefeweizen is great, but this takes the concept one step further with excellent results."
"CHEERS!"
"I wasn't sure if weizenbocks were filtered or not. Before pouring the last bit I admired the color as being somewhere between straw and gold. After a swirl and a pour of the final bit I happily admired the curling cloud that is characteristic of the falling yeast and proteins from a weissbier pour. There was a frothy-but-not-lacy persistent white head which gave off a lovely wheat aroma. The taste was wheaty, fresh-tasting, and thirst-quenching. It has medium carbonation, and overall is very re-vitalizing. Maybe it should be called 'Vivificus' instead of 'Vitus.' ; )"
"Vitus is creamy and smooth and super easy-drinking (which may or may not be the best, but hey!) Superior drinkability to say the least."
"Not really my thing, but trying to judge it for what it is, I think this is a good example what the Germans do well."
"D - The best I've ever had for the style, and I think it's easy to say it comes from the fact that Vitus is essentially an 'imperial' hefeweizen and manages to be really refreshing despite the alcohol and intense flavor."
"Great example of the style though my own tastes would've asked for less banana and bubble gum (not my two favorite things)."
"Drinkability: Its time to go back to the roots of the style. There are a few american versions of the weizenbock i have tried that dont compare to this at all. Truely this beer is getting me back to where it all started, Germany. Go grab one and enjoy!"
"M/D: Very dry, which is an excellent compliment to the fruity spiciness. Light with fairly high carbonation. Supremely drinkable. A bit too sweet to be an everyday beer for me, but an excellent occasional treat."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a very thick and frothy head that slowly goes away. Lots of carbonation bubbles up from the base of the glass. Smells of wheat, fruits, and bread. Not overpowering but fairly good smeller. Taste is extremely yeasty with some hints of bananas. Unique but good tasting. Definitely more of a weizen than a bock in both appearance and taste. Mouthfeel is creamy. Overall pretty solid beer from the oldest brewery in the world. Would be interested in seeing what other flavors pop out after a year or so of aging."
"Overall I prefer Korbinian to all other Weihenstphaner beers, but there is not a bad one in the stable. Certainly recommended."
"Tried this on a whim while waiting for a new keg of Racer X to come on - very happy I did!"
"D- there's no way a beer this size should be so easy to drink. it drinks like it's lil brother. it drinks like a soda. the well hidden alcohol and enjoyable dryness are partly to blame. the other finger is pointed at masterful craftsmanship. as far as i can remember, i haven't had a weizenbock this light, but i prefer this version to all others. it has the look, taste, and aroma that i love from a hefeweizen but with a soft chubby body and a real alcohol kick. a case in the basement would not be out of the question. in fact, it's a damn good idea."
"D-This goes down easy considering ABV, but it's really not my kind of thing. This is my first weizenbock and I'm open to trying others, but probably not this one again."
"D- 7.7% ABV, you'd never know it. I could drink quite a few of these. Excellent!"
"june '10 had it again and it was a house favorite. first time i've had a beer that has a very definitive lavender taste to it. no hints about it. great body. great great esters in palate and nose. goes down frightfully easy."
"All in all a very good beer, and a great value. Personally, I would probably opt for other weizenbocks or hefeweizens. That said, Vitus has an exceptionally big taste; the flavor goes a lot further than I was expecting. It's less refreshing than it is intriguing."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel?! Insanely smooth, alcohol has the perfect amount of masking."
"D- Excellent, possibly the best of it's type that I've had, this brewery knows what they're doing. It can sneak up on you though since the alcohol is no where to be found despite the 7.7%. An overall amazing brew."
"Overall, this is an excellent example of the style. Such a nice drinking beer with a great banana taste, if that's what you're into in your weissens. I'm seeing now why this brew is so revered on this site. Definitely worth picking up a bottle (or six) next time you see it."
"Moderate carbonation and perfect substance for the flavor profile and style. ABV is well hidden. This is truly a style defining beer."
"If you see it on tap just order one."
"D: very high given the alcohol."
"Wine Specialist/$3.49/16.9 oz"
"D- Drinks like a much lower ABV. I could drink this all night. While the flavors are complex, there's nothing too prominent to offend the palate in excessive amounts. The bubblegum makes it very easy drinking."
"Pours a cloudy golden straw color, with full frothy head. Good lacing. Banana, clove, black pepper and wheat on the nose. Assertive grainy & wheat tastes with pepper, banana & clove background. Finishes bitter and slightly boozy. Smooth and somewhat creamy, medium bodied. Candy like sweet aftertaste. Delicious beer... would never have guessed what i was given was a Weizenbock."
"Good heaviness, well carbonated, it is a very nice beer that is beyond session-able but you could have as many as you want. And I'll be wanting more."
"D - Goes down so well and is such a nice crisp and refreshing beer. You don't notice the alcohol much until the end when you realize your pint is almost gone. Great flavors throughout and the profile continues to change as it warms. Really fun to explore this beer."
"Pours a cloudy gold color with a white foamy 3+ finger head. Smells like bananas, citrus, cloves, and sweet malt. The taste matches the aroma, and has a pleasant light sweetness to it. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and smooth. This is an nicely drinkable beer."
"D- Drinkable weizenbock not as interesting as others, mainly just a stronger ABV Hefe."
"served a mug with a small to medium head and no lace. Aroma is heavy traditional Bavarian Weizen - pungent, sweet-sour, fruity, malty, und vundrerbar! Color is a hazy light to medium-light amber. Flavor is prominently a pungent malt with lemony citrus character. Hardly any hop. Finish is like regular flav. One of the richest, most full flavored weizens. Perhaps a session."
"Amazingly drinkable at 7.7%, I'd definitely be inclined to return to this one."
"D- Quite different from other Weizenbocks that I have had. Vitus doesn't really have any of the dark malt, tobacco, raisin, caramel flavor that I would expect but it is very enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Excellent drinkability. This is my first time trying this beer, but it's similar to a regular hefe, just a bit more intense malt sweetness (although not dark malts) with higher alcohol. Very good."
"I was expecting this to be darker, fruitier, maltier, etc."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Could definitely imperial session this sucker at 7.7% ABV."
"Overall - Because of the similarity with its milder brother, I couldn't help but do this review as a comparison. Although this is an excellent beer, I think I will stick with the latter."
"This was simply one of the better beers I've had in a long time. Absolutely delicious! Even with the slightly higher ABV, I could see myself easily drinking these all night if it was more readily available in the area!"
"D = A very good beer but honestly not what I was expecting. It is not completely dissimilar from other weizenbocks, but it is a different take on the style with much more or the normal hefeweizen traits being preserved. Quite easy to drink though."
"As you would expect weihenstephaner do not dissapoint. Vius is a classic weizenbock, and stacks up well with the greats in the style."
"Overall the best beer I've had in quite some time. I'm regretting I only purchased one bottle....back to Wegmans!"
"Full bodied with enough CO2 to nearly pass it off as a quaffer given its familar hefeweizen cues. It's not so much a hefe on steroids as one that's simply bred bigger and better."
"D - This is quite an interesting beer and it lends perspective to the American wheat wines that have begun to appear in the last few years. There is a lot of intensity to the yeast flavors here that seems to be a byproduct of the relatively high gravity. The intensity of the bubble-gum and clove character isn't over the top, but if it were much stronger it would hurt the beer. There is a lot of malt backing the yeast, and that helps keep it drinkable. The aroma is excellent, but the flavor of intense, almost harsh, yeast is just not as well balanced as I would like it to be. This was a nice beer and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I still prefer the lower gravity German wheats."
"Drinkability: My first reaction on the pour was one of surprise at the lightness of the color and I wondered if I'd grabbed the wrong bottle. This is very drinkable hefeweizen/weizenbock and even before the beer was half gone I was wishing that I had another one to open this evening. I'll definitely be looking for more of this one."
"Quite easy to drink. Heavier on the spice than some but a nice fruitiness to balance it out, a sweet streak through the middle. Nice beer!"
"The flavor's are kicked up and pronounced! Maybe not the most intricate, but it's a delight to drink."
"D: Drinkability is fantastic, there is nothing harsh or offensive about this beer whatsoever, I'm sure even a non beer drinker could drink this one. The alcohol content is well hidden for it's gravity, but certainly there. Great beer and very reccommended!"
"pretty high alcohol limits this beers drinkability along with the acidity, but still a good beer"
"Very drinkable in taste, I keep wanting to take another sip. The only thing that would hold me back from that is that by the end of this pint-bottle I am feeling a little ""full"". But this beer feels so crisp and fresh for a bock strength beer. Great stuff"
"Maybe it's because I haven't been that into wheats lately, or my expectations were put up a bit too high--didn't quite match my expectations, yet still a great brew!"
"Extremely well-balance beer that's on the fuller side of medium body. A perfect amalgam of spicy clove, sweet citrus fruit, corriander and ripe banana notes. The spicy cloves are pretty prominent up front followed by a a perfect blend of lemon peel, orange peel, ripe banana and subtle hops. There is also a very nice slight tartness in the dry finish. This is a complex beer that is extremely drinkable and refreshing. Highly recommended!"
"D - Excellent! I could drink this all day!"
"A 500ml bottle poured into my Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Vitus appears a hazed rich straw yellow color with about three fingers of cloud-like bone white foam. Aromas and flavors are made up of toasted nutty wheat, bananas, a decent amount of caramelized malts, mild milk chocolate notes, banana bread, yeasty, citrus notes. Approaching full bodied with adequate carbonation. Yet another world class offing from Weihenstephanerer."
"Most definitely an easy drinker at 7.7. Enjoyed it thoroughly (and too quickly!), and will be picking up more in the future."
"Basically a supercharged Hefeweizen, vs a Dunkel such as you find with Aventinus, which offers more complexity in flavor. A different approach and rather well done. Very drinkable and quite enjoyable."
"drinkability: very sessionable. could be drank in the sun or inside. easy to drink with a well masked high abv. and affordable. i recommend it to all"
"On the whole, another excellent brew from Weihenstephaner. I could easily drink another three or four of these in one sitting, though I'm not sure that's such a good idea since it *is* stronger than the Hefe. Will probably have to do a parallel taste test in the future with the Hefe, just for comparison's sake. And with how tasty both of these beers are, I think that'll have to be pretty soon."
"Drinkability might be hampered by the fact that you will want to smell this beer for hours but between the flavors and mouthfeel you'll have no problem making 1, 3, or even 5 of these disapear before you can say V.I.T.U.S.!!! Epic!"
"Drinkability: Quite enjoyable. Weihenstephaner's clearly been doing this a while..."
"Drinkability: This one certainly hides the ABV well. I honestly think that if someone were to present this to me as a standard hefeweizen, I wouldn't know the difference."
"I can't recommend it, but I know that it is different enough to seek out to try something very different."
"Drank very similarly to their hefeweissbier. A pale golden color in the glass with a voluminous white head that evolved into a nice thin head that clung to the sides of the glass. The aroma and flavor was very similar to a tradition hefe, with perhaps a more pronounced citrus quality and a drier finish. It's full bodied yet light on the tongue due to it's high carbonation. I found it highly drinkable in spite of it's higher ABV which was really well managed."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. It was a lot more complex than I thought it was going to be and was so drinkable. I want to buy more of this but it isn't available in MN. Definitely a great beer!"
"Aroma is of banana phenols and clove. Extremely sugary, Vitus tastes like a banana lemon creamsicle with raisiny cloves and toffee. Whereas I would equate most weizenbocks with fall this one has more of a lighter, summer flair."
"Poured a pale straw yellow with a nice thick white head that retained pretty well and left a little lacing. The smell was of bananas and cloves, like a hefeweizen but stronger. Taste was again like a strong hefeweizen; some spice and a lot of banana. Creamy smooth mouthfeel with mild carbonation. All in all very delicious and extremely drinkable for 7.7 abv."
"D - Wonderfully drinkable. Smooth, good flavor with a good mouthfeel."
"This is now become my favorite Weissbeer overall, great flavors, very smooth beer."
"Highly drinkable, similar to Hefeweissbier. Wouldn't be able to guess the nearly 8% abv."
"Overall-a must have. Would make for an excellent fall beer, or in my case, a night beer for the middle of august. I'm glad I got this"
"All the brews from this brewery are awesome. Try this one when you want a big hefe."
"Conclusion: This is a damn good specialty beer and was definitely a nice surprise. Will try this again for sure."
"Quite nice! A classic!"
"A delicious beer; probably good for two in a row, no more than three."
"D - Nice stuff!"
"Pale golden color with a bit of haze. Quite the bevy of foam and lacing. Moderate aroma-mildly spicey and somewhat cloveish. Very crisp and clean flavor wise. A wheaty crispness against and slightly spiced and phenolic bite. Somewhat peppery tinge. Solid mouthfeel. Really a great beer all around. I could do this again and again."
"Overall, a very solid weizenbock. Recommended."
"This poured a hazy straw color with lots of white head. It smelled like lemon and sour yeast with some caramel malt and banana and light cloves. It tasted like lemon and banana and wheat bread and sour yeast, with caramel and cloves. It was somewhat thick with mild carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was very enjoyable! I liked it better than the standard hefe-weissbier by Weihenstephan, since it had a bit more spice and complexity to it. But despite its complexity, it was still super drinkable, with great body and brilliantly hidden alcohol. Quite refreshing and perfect on a summer night."
"Mouthfeel is deliciously sticky, with a lot of foam from the haze adding texture to the palate. This is another excellent - although very different - weizenbock. Rich, challenging flavours, with an excellent balance achieved through, basically, a lot of everything. Lots of malt and funk-ay yeast, with some nice German hopping. Definitely an interesting drop, keeps you focused from start to finish."
"I really dig Weizenbocks and this beer just might be one of the best ones I've had yet. The 7.7% ABV is so well hidden, its not even funny. Complex flavors with a medium body mouthfeel and drinkable, especially on this warm summer afternoon."
"This is a great beer. Very drinkable. A hearty weizen with some kick."
"Alcohol not even noticeable. Beer is particularly soft and smooth on the back end with that banana taste again. MMMM, yum!"
"D: refreshing,easy to drink, the alcohol is well masked. I did drink 2 500ml easy before I reviewed."
"It's everything you'd expect to enjoy from going to a local German beer garden on a hot Sunday afternoon."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color and is opaque, with a 1 finger head that dissipates within a minute. Leaves no lacing behind whatsoever. Smells good, fruity, spicy, lemon, very much like the Weeihen Heffeweiss. Tastes just like the Heffeweis but maybe a bit more citrus/fruity, somehow more alcohol that is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is light to medium and very smooth with good carbonation, goes down well. Very tasty and smooth makes for great drinkability, I feel like I could drink many of these in one session, good stuff."
"Wheat beers are not necessarily my favorite style, but this weizenbock really stands out. A real treat! This brewery never ceases to amaze me."
"Moderate to light feel, a little grainy, but still smooth, very refreshing and very easy to drink. Overall, I felt that the beer was just like the Hefe, only filtered."
"M/D - decent carbonation and flavor, sort of a refreshing brew, but there is a soapiness to it that turns me off to this one. I don't think i'll get it again."
"Notes: This is liquid goodness. Alcohol could really sneak up on the drinker here since it is so well hidden. This is the 5th and final Weihenstephaner beer that I sampled recently. This one did not dissapoint."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Nice to taste the tap version versus the bottle. The tap version just screams banana while the bottle is a bit more subtle and complex. I like both, but this is definitely a bit less integrated than the bottled version. Pours a hazy pale golden with a big head. Smells a bit grainy with a touch of vanilla and lots of banana. Tastes of lots of sweet banana, some more vanilla and soft wheat, all followed by some refreshing lemon notes that cut through the rest og the flavors. Thre is a slight bitterness followed by a sweeter finish near the end. Pretty nice overall."
"As before mentioned, Vitus is much like a stronger version of Hefe, only with reduced drinkability. Being so similar to one of the best beers in the world can only be a good thing. A great beer."
"This is one of the most drinkable Weizenbocks. It's less complex then some, especially Aventinus, which makes this a very sneaky brew. It basically is a Weihenstephaner hefeweizen on roids, and hides its strength very well."
"D- the 7.7% abv is well hidden in this one. I consider this to be very drinkable. Can be enjoyed with sipping and with sloshing. I recommend savoring it though."
"D: Highly drinkable with good flavor and low alcohol taste"
"Big frothy white head, with a hazy yellow color. Clove/wheat aroma, essentially smells like a hefeweizen. Taste is sweet and wheaty, a little bit of clove and some taste of bubblegum. It hides the high ABV quite well; there is only a slight hint of alcohol. A fantastic beer; something I'd really enjoy on a hot summers day."
"This is an interesting beer. Only weizenbock I've had that is not ruby red. It looks like one of those Oktoberfests that are pale. Acts like one too. Nice head not much lacing. Very strong but not detectable. Very strong wheaty and plumby on the nose. Not the typical weizenbock but special in it's ownright. Very fruity, like a belgian, reminds me of delirium tremens. Very good beer."
"D - Good, but closer to a maibock than a weizenbock. Too light and not enough dark fruit."
"Mouthfeel was zesty but ends smoothly. Body was medium to full."
"D: I'm not much of a wheat beer kinda guy, but I could drink this all night and be pretty damn happy with it. This is a fine beer. Highly recommended."
"Fantastic Weizenbock and now one of my favorites of all time."
"Drinkability is the best thing about this beer. I could drink this beer till the raccoons sleep, and after."
"Served in a beautiful Vitus chalice at the Brick Store Pub. Cloudy yellow peach with a thick frothy fizzy white head. Subtle aromas of green apple, banana and clove. Zesty, fizzy up front with noticeable flavors of lemon, clove, banana. This gets banana bready in the middle, finishing dry. Very subtle and easy to drink. Tastes like a better than average Hefeweizen, even though it's labeled a Weizenbock..."
"D- An enjoyable beer that drinks very nicely for the ABV. I can't say it is extraordinarily memorable, but it is tasty and smooth."
"Pours a very light straw goldenrod color with a great 1.5 inch head that sticks around and laces. Smells like bread, yeast, banana, spices, and European hops. Taste is spicy and light, bready and hints of German hops. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing which contributes to the drinkability."
"D: Sweet mother, I wish I had another several of these. This is definitely one of the easiest-drinking beers I've had in a while. I had to do a double take when I saw that the abv is 7.7%, as this goes down so ridiculously easily I thought it couldn't be much more than 5."
"Was very excited to try this with all the hype, but unfortunately it just wasn't my style. Glad I tried it, still a great beer and highly recommended."
"very cloudy, golden yellow. huge head, tons of lacing. strange color for a weizenbock, generally dark colored,but whatever... smell is yeasty and grassy. makes me want to visit a farm. taste is grassy, with banana and cloves. mouthfeel is a slightly chewey, but very well carbonated. alcohol is very well hidden. overall, damn tasty. refreshing like a hefe, but carries an extra punch with it."
"Wow...grainy and malty with huge bubblegum and clove flavors. This might be the most refreshing and light-feeling 7.7% beer I have had. Goes down very smooth and easy. Somewhat un-weizenbock, but nonetheless a damn tasty beer. I can always make room in my fridge for a few of these. Fairly good price at less than $3 a pop."
"The richness of flavor and mouthfeel make Vitus fairly easy to drink, though after a little more than half of the ~1 pint bottle, I'm feeling the ABV. Nevertheless, my experience makes me eager to try more of it and other weizenbocks."
"Picked up a bottle for $3.25. Poured into a Weihenstephaner Hefe glass. Bright yellow color, and a very cloudy body. Huge fluffy ivory white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell was a huge burst of clove. Taste was pretty close to perfect. Intense flavor of banana and bubble gum. At a nice chilled temp, this beer has a wonderfully smooth body to it. The alcohol is a bit noticeable, so I found myself drinking it a bit slower than I expected. But taste urged me to drink more. This is not a beer that I would drink a bunch of in one evening, but enjoying one was quite a treat."
"If I could find this locally I'd likely drink a fair bit of it. Might be a little too sweet to do in a row."
"drinkability very refreshing although lacking in lasting flavor. would but this beer again"
"Just like their hefe, this one begs you to drink more with every sip. The only big drawback is that the carbonation is deceptive in that it fills you up without being heavy on the tongue. Another winner from Weihenstephan."
"D: Very easy drinking beer. Considering the alcohol content and the overall hugeness of this beer, it goes down very easily. A little lighter in color than I had expected, but still a nice beer. Very interesting!"
"hmm, i'm torn about whether this is better than the regular weihenstephaner weissbier. i suppose the intensity of the flavors and higher ABV cut down drinkability? bah, what am i saying? i could still drink this all day!"
"Thank you ""Reverend ColoradoBobs"" for prasing this brew; I FINALLY tried it. Poured into a Pils glass; head was quite nice and stayed even after sitting awhile. Picked up a very nice citrusy smell and after two sips, was able to pick up banana and clove. The alcohol is quite disguised; I could get into MAJOR trouble with this one as you don't realize it's as potent as it is. If not for the alcohol content, I'd call this a sessionable brew. I could still find myself quaffing two or three in a sitting at home, though!! GREAT brew!"
"Pours a hazy golden color with a slight orange glow. It poured with a huge frothy white head. It has strong aroma of banana and cloves which I expected along with some yeast. It has a spicy flavor which I very much enjoy. Some flavors I picked up on were banana, a slight mango, clove and I think I'm getting some ginger in there as well. Its a light bodied effervescent beer. Overall its extremely approachable for its higher alcohol."
"Prototypical Weizen appearance, the pale body, the large head, and cloudy consistency were unmistakable. The aroma was also classic banana and clove, and was pretty inviting. The taste was a lot spicier than the Hefeweizen this looked like. The clove notes were much more pronounced and there was also some sourness apparent. Very light in the mouth, which is quite typical of wheat based beers, but it was quite a bit lighter than anticipated considering this is a Weizenbock. Probably the easiest to drink near 8% beer I've sampled. Way different than Aventinus or any other examples of this style."
"Weihenstephaner does it again with their Weizenbock. I've been impressed with every Weihenstephaner beer I've had the pleasure of trying (Hefe, Dunkel, Korbinian and now the Vitus) and I'm beginning to think that this brewery cannot put a foot wrong. Superb flavor, and quite drinkable, I would definitely recommend you get your hands on a bottle of Vitus."
"Too sweet to drink too much of, and too heavy to drink after mowing the lawn (or is it..?) - this beer, I think, is a fine example of just plain great craftsmanship, and what you choose to or choose not to match it with is up to you. I still have half a bottle, and I'm definitely going to enjoy it, as is."
"overall this one tasty beverage and another solid brew by weihenstephaner"
"D - No surprise to me that Weihenstephaner makes a very good, drinkable weizenbock. Good when you want something like a hefe, but a little stronger. Falls somewhere between hefeweizen and wheatwine."
"There's a saying around the parts where this beer is brewed: ""perfect, sound, sweet - pure barley and wheat"". If that isn't a dead-ringer for the Weihenstephaner Vitus I don't know what is. I've loved every one of this brewery's beers - even trying them all on this side of the pond. If Weihenstephaner is really the world's oldest brewery, then we've kept the right one around!"
"Drinkability is really quite impressive for the style. At 7.7, you won't want to slam them down too fast, but it wouldn't be too hard. I hear people talking about this one all the time, and now it all makes sense."
"All in all very good and enjoyable. Worth seeking out."
"A great Weizenbock another brew I am sure I will be seeing again this summer. Extremely easy to drink and the almost 8% alcohol is nowhere to be found."
"D - The 7.7% ABV pushes it but I'm there - this should be a staple beer in the fridge year 'round. Bravo!"
"Vitus will not be denied! Great flavor profile, with a slick initial presence of wheat and caramel followed by zesty yeast and hops that drop notes of white pepper, clove, and boozy bubblegum. Finishes with a smooth, yet well-carbonated burst of alcohol and fruity yeastiness; body on the thicker side of medium. I suppose its not surprising how much I enjoyed Vitus; after all, it is a classic."
"d: The spiceyness and alcohol make this the only one id want to drink in a setting. Not saying I wouldnt drink it again ever just not twice in a night."
"Read about this one in the latest BA Magazine and I came away impressed. It is a great beer at a great price point ($2.99)."
"I gotta say that this was a spectacular beer, and went down really well for having a 7.70 abv. and has high drinkability potential."
"Poured it into my duvel glass. Hazy orange color with about one inch thick head. Got lots of clove and some banana in the aroma. Again more cloves in the taste, banana, and some pineapple. Extremely smooth to drink with the right amount of maltiness. I love this beer. Highly Recommended"
"T - The flavor is of hops, wheat, and yeast...very typical of a good bock beer. It was fabulous for its style."
"Lighter in flavor and color than what I expected. Not dark malts here, just slightly bigger body. Kinda like if you were to upgrade from a domestic macroswill to an ""ICE"" beer with the letters XXX on it, this is what you would get in the world of Hefe's. I expected more dark malts and complexity, but for what it is, it's a decent hefe."
"M and D: Medium-bodied and incredibly slick. A good dose of carbonation brings out the bold spices. This is an easy beer to drink, and the alcohol hides so well that I got a nice warming sensation afterwards that hit me right after the last sip. I've already recommended this to folks in town. I look forward to enjoying this beer again very soon."
"Big thanks to ColoradoBobs for hyping this every night on LNBA and to Vintage Estate for carrying it. I will definitely be picking up more of this the next time I am out there."
"The beer had a definitive resemblence to Maibocks in the malt profile, but with the beautiful balance and complexity of traditional wheat beers. Is this a marriage made in a brewery (you thought I was going to say heaven didn't you?) Why aren't more breweries doing this? Note: the beer darkens as the subsequent pours are taken from the bottle, but the beer never takes on hazy proportions; maybe Kristalweizen-like (filtered)."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Refreshing, but it packs quite a wallop at 7.7 percent ABV."
"Picked up a couple bottles of this at Green's along Buford Highway. Took a bottle over to my dad's to celebrate his birthday. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy yellow color with a frothy white head. Spicy, citrusy, clove and banana in the nose. Tastes citrusy, earthy, and spicy. Very carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, a good beer. Glad this is readily available now."
"Overall: Very drinkable, I could drink this all night till the cows come home. So many flavors to think about and experience. The aroma is absolutely amazing!! This beer is an amazing experience yet very easy to drink."
"Overall this is a very good beer, amazingly drinkable for the ABV almost no alcohol detectable at all. You could drink this on a cold night or in the summer heat. This is an all season beer!"
"Overall: Mouthfeel was good, well carbonated and medium/light on the tongue. Very drinkable beer. I really enjoyed and need to try more of the style."
"drinkability was smooth and easy drinking and it went down way too well for 7.7%"
"I enjoyed it alot, although it is not my favorite beer due to the overwhelming citrus tastes."
"This is a home run for sure. Everyone should subscribe to the gospel according to ColoradoBobs and drink one of these now!"
"D - Sweet mother of Zeus, I could drink this stuff all night!!!"
"D: The beer disappeared quickly for me. The alcohol is well hidden. However, if you are not a big fan of spice character in beer, this may not be the one for you. Luckily, I love it when it is done right like this one is."
"Medium bodied and fairly chewy. Good carbonation and overall a pleasant beer. VEry drinkable; easily drinkable. I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability - this comes across as more weizeny than bocky. The malts are a little too lost in the yeast and spices, but those flavors are so tasty, I don't mind. The alcohol is well-masked and for this style, that's impressive. I look forward to trying this in the upcoming months at a barbecue or two."
"I can see why."
"D: Kind of like a regular hefe turned up to 11. The extra body lets you know this is a strong beer, yet it drinks lighter than it is. I wished the banana factor was a bit higher, but otherwise this is very nice."
"Remarkable beer that really has no equal that I have had. It would pair nicely with any number of foods, from salad to dessert. Weihenstephan is the bomb!"
"T/M/D - very smooth and balanced, with a hint of a hoppy bite that really makes this one interesting. The alcohol hides pretty well, but I can tell its there from the warming feeling. I'll be looking for this one again!"
"Overall, a big winner. Nice and drinkable, even at 7.7%. Try this."
"Pours a cloudy-ish/clear-ish yellow colored body, with a big foamy white head. Has a flowery clover smelling aroma. Some banana in the nose too. Taste is banana, flowery fruity, maybe some citrus. Wow, refreshing, and light. Gooood. But like most German beers, this one is probably fresh."
"Delicious stuff."
"Sweet finish. Excellent beer. This brewery does no wrong. Had their Dark Weiss on tap last week, sorry Bobs as much as this is a good beer, the dark weiss beats its ass like a bongo."
"The mouthfeel is rich but not overbearing. Thouroughly enjoyable for me, I would put (St.)Vitus up next to Aventinus any day. Weihenstephaner always seems to produce the highest level of quality."
"Layers of banana, vanilla, clove and spice that has a complexity and mouth feel that is uncommon for the style. Intensely sweet, but strongly balanced and flavored. Nose showcases typical weisse notes. Light golden colored with a filmy white head. Stunning wheat ale."
"This is a great beer. Light lemon yellow pour with a billowing head. Huge banana nose, with notes of yeast and brown bread and biscuit. Very, very nice. Taste is similar with banana and a lot of breadiness. A little bit of spiciness on the back end, more cinnamon than black pepper. Finish is a touch watery, but that is my only knock on this beer. Perhaps I am not terribly familiar with the style and thus lack a baseline for review. Regardless, this beer is fantastic and I am absolutely loving it. For me, more impressive than the highly rated hefeweissbeer. Pick this up, its fantastic...."
"A fine beer."
"Half-liter bottle, with some code on the back label; 17 IBUs. The beer is a pale yellowed-gold, with lots of carbonation that builds up three fingers of bright white head. Vibrant and enticing. The aroma starts grassy, with wheat and banana close behind, and a gentle fruity/spicy component to round things out. Similar flavor, with yeast, a touch of banana, clove spiciness, light bitterness, and some warming alcohol. The flavor really opens up as it warms, and the sweetness increases with the temperature. Light and crisp at the beginning, medium and incredibly smooth by the end, with a lingering spice. This is not necessarily a complex beer, but it is so damn tasty and pretty cheap to boot. A classic in the world of weizenbocks."
"Since this was a bomber, I gassed and capped the rest. I guess one glass at a time is enough for me. This is the only Weihenstephaner I would have to think twice about buying again."
"D: High drinkability. This is a delicious beer that satisfies and entices me for another drink."
"This beer pours a light and cloudy amber with a large head and tons of lacing. The smell is of bananas and malt. The flavor has a very nice malt base to it with a nice and smooth banana flavor coming from the yeast. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy with a nice carbonation level. Incredibly drinkable brew I will purchase this again!"
"OVERALL: This is good. The ABV is too high to make it a session beer, but it's very enjoyable and quite drinkable as well. This is like their regular hefeweizen on steroids. A pleasure through and through, one I'll definitely pick up again when I see it. I might even age a few to see if the alcohol mellows and it smoothens out over time. That would just make it killer drinkable and send it over the top."
"This is amazingly drinkable. This bottle was like $2.99. Are you kidding me? What a steal! I think this jumps Lion Stout as my best beer bargain. Phenomenal beer."
"Solid drinkable brew more like a Hefe."
"500ml brown bottle served in a hefe glass. Poured a hazy pale gold. Lots of carbonation, typical for a wheat beer. Thick white head. Plenty of clove in the aroma more than banana. This is the way I prefer it! Medium to light bodied, nice smooth mouthfeel. Spicy flavor from both the yeast and the wheat. Also some fruitiness. Lingering clove flavor in the finish. You can taste that there is strength there, but it is not hot. Plenty of malt. This is a classic weizenbock."
"Drinkability is high. This beer is well crafted and brings good flavor, which makes it easy to drink. It's simple, light, and refreshing. Well done."
"Love it, can't imagine it could be done better."
"D - This is extremely drinkable. Not as good as the hefe but very close. I could easily drink a few bombers of these and at 7+% alcohol, I would be a mess."
"Easily sessionable. Doesn't feel or drink anything like as big as it is. Every time I try a beer from this brewery, I become a bigger fan."
"T/M/D: Wow there's a lot going on here. First hits of caramel malt, followed by bright fruit and spice notes. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with light prickes from the carbonation. Lingering finish continues the malty palate attack. Good stuff!"
"D) Yum, more! A sweeter Hefe, makes it a bit more satisfying and meal like. Good stuff, I'll get more while it's fresh!"
"This stuff drinks a hefe, hits like an imperial hefe. You cloud fool your friends until they realize they're legless."
"T/M: Mouth is heavier than I thought it would be and not as much carbonation as expected. Creamier mouthfeel. Flavors are along with the nose of banana and clove with a nice candied sweetness throughout. This fades to a crsip bite. Highly drinable and and clean"
"Taste has a strong banana and a little bite of carbonation on the end. There is a warming alcohol towards the back of the drink. Mouthfeel is a medium creamy. Drinkability is very high. This doesn't seem to have the booziness that other weizenbock's have."
"This is the wheat beer of the gods. With an incredibly solid lineup of beers, Weinhenstephan is one of my favorite breweries, and Vitus just hammers the point home. I only have four different Weizenbocks under my belt thus far, so I speak more from enthusiasm for a particular beer than appreciation of a well-executed style. I guess that's my disclaimer. At any rate, Vitus is a thick hazy light to medium golden liquid with a silky head of tiny bubbles. The nose is sweet with the spiced wheat banana flavor of good German wheat beer. The flavor is all wonderful wheat. There are notes of banana, clove, bubblegum and some other hard to place fruits and spices. It's quite sweet. The relatively high abv is well-hidden from both tongue and nose. The mouthfeel is luxuriously velvety. The finish is a bit tart and sweet, like a candied lemon rind. Vitus goes down exceptionally smoothly, particularly for the strength. I'm going through this half liter much too quickly. Vitus is a rich, luxurious and complex Doppelbock."
"D: High ABV keeps this from being a sessionable beer, but, it is well hidden."
"The taste is also quite good. There is a decent efforvescence that spritzes and fizzes a bit on the tongue, and keeps the gulps on the smaller side. It is slightly creamy, and not overly tart. There are plenty of lemon citrus, orange rind, and clove flavors to keep this interesting and quite sweet. This is a bit stronger in ABV than your garden variety hefe. It is still fairly light bodied, but there is an acerbic twinge towards the finish that is not entirely from spice or hop, but also from some ABV. There is a slight white pepper bite to the beer as well. This is a treat for what it is, more a summer type beer, quite light and refreshing. L'Chaim."
"Fairly thick, full-bodied and bready. Solid carbonation keeps things moving right along. Very drinkable, with an ABV that contributes to taste but is nonetheless well - and dangerously - hidden."
"How this & Ramstein Winter Wheat are in the same category I have no idea. This is actually pretty similar to their Double Platinum(Ramstein), but minus the big fruity flavors & gorgeous color. An easy substitute in the off season I guess. I guess."
"D- Quite drinkable. Definitely does not taste like 7.7%. Definitely the best in the style I've had, but I prefer the Weihenstephaner Dunkel, Original, or Hef."
"Vitus is excellent beer. I've got a small gripe with labeling it a Weizenbock, but there's absolutely no denying its quality. I'm hoping we see this beer soon here in Ohio. I've heard it turns up. Until I find, I'd like thank Josh once again for the opportunity. I really enjoyed this."
"Its something i could drink quite abit of if i liked it more guess its just not really for me"
"mouth is typical for the style, slightly overcarbonated. Drinks easy but would be better paired for a hot day."
"ok drinkability. the alcohol content holds this category back for me."
"Very nice beer, but unlike any of Weihenstephaner's other beers, this one feels kind of big. Two would be a tough prospect for me."
"Picked up a .5l at Abe's for $3.25. Pours a hazy amber-orange with a short white head. I get a big hit of banana bread. As it warms earthy hops and orange. This beer actually reminds me of a snappier version of Franziskaner without all the creamy background malt. The aftertaste is a nice pairing of spice and citrus hops, very nice. It's a touch sweeter than a normal hefe from the extra malt and strength and it's really the maibock of German wheat beers for that little extra fruit tang that comes with the strength. Still, for a nearly 8% beer its deceptively drinkable. This beer could get you in trouble."
"Drinkability: Recommended. An expertly crafted expression of wheat. It's tasty and really grows on you more and more with every sip. Maybe that UGADawgGuy is onto something..."
"Easily drinkable despite its relatively high ABV. This is an excellent beer."
"MF&D - the beer has a great refreshing crisp taste from the carbonation; while the body is not too heavy, making me want to keep drinking. the only thing that hold it back is I find the bubbles to be a bit much, and they stifle my drinking, making me feel quite bloated untill I belch and continue the process. but who really cares, its beer and I'm a guy."
"It lives up to the hype of ColoradoBobs."
"An outstanding Weizenbock and very much an excellent compare and contrast in its approach to Aventinus."
"Nice cloudy pale yellow color, healthy head. Smells of banana and hefeweizen. The flavor is nice, cloves, citrus, lemony, very interesting. I don;t know much about German beers or weizenbocks but this was quite good and I'd like another bottle to investigate further."
"Cloudy straw/wheat yellow with a steady stream of bubbles rising to the surface. It had a big fluffy off-white cap and there was some chunky lacing. Lots of fruity banana and clove spice in the aroma, bready, lemon zest, light alcohol, bubblegum. Very much like a hefeweizen in character. Flavour was more of the same, but a little richer in malt, having some caramel character. Also a bit of alcohol flavour and warmth. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, nice texture. Quite enjoyable."
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours a light hazy golden with a fluffy 2 inch white head that leaves no lacing. The head also doesn't stick around like most hefe's. The lack of head retention in it really surprised me. The aroma is a banana smack to the face. Huge clove, coriander, and for the very first time, I definitely get big bubble gum notes. The flavor reminds me a lot of fresh made banana bread. Big banana, clove, walnuts, and coriander. And surprisingly, once again, bubble gum. This is really the first time I have ever gotten any type of bubble gum out of a beer. The mouthfeel is a nice medium bodied hefe. This is a just another great beer from a great brewery. This would be perfect for a cool summer night."
"A beautiful beer, though I wish I had found it in the summer. I think I would have enjoyed it even more. Very drinkable and well made."
"Gosh, there is so much this beer does right... I want more. This is drinkable and delightful. Bless you, Weihenstephan! Don't change a thing."
"Overall this is certainly worth a shot by all who love Weihenstephaner, and thanks again for ShrLSU for sending this along."
"Pours a cloudy lemon yellow with a long lasting head and decent lacing..very inviting. Smell is grassy, wheaty with phenol and malt undertones. Taste is surprising rich...malt complexity, slightly fruity, grassy, pleasant alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, blending into a dry finish. Drinkability is excellent based upon above qualities."
"Pours an unexpectedly light and relatively clear yellow/amber with an insanely massive pillowy white head. Great retention. Smell: a bit sparse, soft banana and wheat scents, slightly spicy and yeasty, but dominated by a sweet breadyness. Taste: tangy wheat, yeast, banana are most prevalent. Sweet, kind of a banana pudding thing going on here, in a good way. Other flavors buried in there: lemon, dried pineapple, clove, slight grassy + spicy hops. Ever so slight warning of the abv. Soft and creamy... a sessionable weizenbock? Uh oh."
"D: This is probably my new favorite brew. This is stupid good. I have always been a fan of German styles, and this is amazing. Damn near perfect in every category. This beer is damn tasty and goes down amazingly well and easily. I just want to drink more and I sad that I have ran through this one so fast without a backup. For now, she will be the one that got away but at least I was able to taste every part of her before she left. I long for you Vitus. VITUS!!!"
"Only problem I had was it was a little too sweet. Kind of got a cotton candy-sugar taste after a while, to the point I craved an IPA or something sour to wash this beer down with. At first I wanted to mark this beer down for it in the taste category, but everything that came before it was too good."
"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a big pillowy white head that falls to a nice cap. Smell is full of big sweet banana notes, sweetness all over this puppy. Banana definitely dominates but I can get some powdered sugar, angel food cake etc... Tastes awesome. The banana pairs with vanilla notes, slight wheat sourness and spice. As unappealing as this will sound to some, reminds me of a banana smoothie or pudding. The mouthfeel, while thick, remains plenty approachable to throw this one down quickly! Highly drinkable. Wow."
"Very drinkable, very enjoyable. Really make me wonder why I don't drink more of this one. Definitely one which was tried due to commotion on the forums usually stirred up by ColoradoBobs. But when you are right, you are right. Damn good beer."
"Very VERY drinkable. Please go get one or two or three."
"This is a drinkable beer, better suited to a cool evening opposed to this witner night, the abv settels inwell in either case though."
"Ultimately drinkable."
"I don't want to give out perfect 5s where I have 4.5s, because I don't like giving out perfect marks unless something is like the greatest ever, but this is trying my resolve. I guess one drawback is that i'd like to see it a bit maltier to give it a little more backbone, but that is forgiveable. ColoradoBob gets great thanks for mentioning this in every post ever, but the patron saint of Vitus has it right here. This is a must-try brew!"
"Overall, an excellent beer. I love this style and wish they had more available out there. The one's i've had had always reminded me of a hefe combined with a belgian. this one reminds me of between a hefe and a tripel. Great flavor and easy drinking (even at 7.7%), how can you go wrong?"
"D - This is a very good beer. Doesn't seem to fit the style. It has lots of weizen and very little bock."
"Is there a wheat ale they can't produce well? This is a great way to get summer flavor, but with more meat on its bones for the winter."
"D- Not as good as I had expected, but still, this was awesome. For 2.99 you cannot go wrong."
"Very drinkable. Worth seeking."
"Wonderfully drinkable 7.7 abv beer. I had been wondering what the buzz surrounding this beer, and now I know."
"3.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/3.5"
"Wow, this tastes like a Wiehenstephaner Hefe with lots more body. Very drinkable and tasty. Recommended!"
"drinkability is good, this is just not what one would come to expect from a weizenbock. for what it is, it is a well proportioned and nicely crafted brew, it is just not malty enough for a bock."
"Vitus pours a hazy straw yellow color with a very large bright white head that had good retention for most of the beer. I expected for this beer to a bit darker. The nose smells of a good hefe with plenty of banana, cloves, and apples and pears. The flavor follows the nose to perfection, but it also adds in some bubblegum, lemons, and the classic wheat flavor comes in very nice as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some gentle alcohol warming on the backend of things. This is very drinkable and drinks like their regular hefe with more alcohol and plenty of flavor."
"Poured a light golden color with nice fluffy white head that lasted a while. I was surprised by the lightness of the color. The aroma was very citrusy. The taste was a flavorful balance of bananas, spice, citrus, and wheat. The mouthfeel was very nice. Despite its 7.7% abv this is an extremely drinkable beer that hides its alcohol well."
"Certainly one of the best weizenbocks out there..a must try in my book."
"Two finger head right after a perfect pour, but recedes to nothing after only a few minutes. Good sunshine wheat color, but a little too clear for a wheat beer and lacking any vibrant bubbling or lacing for that matter. The aroma is classic hefe-weiss. Lots of bananas, sometimes ripe, and plenty of cloves. Plus the warmth of 7.7% abv is noticed a bit in the nose. Sweet, ripe bananas and some tart strawberries start the palate off. Then a few herbal cloves and a little grassy hops with the alcohol cut some of that malty sweetness. Good balance of hot, sweet, and herbal flavors in this beer. Very clean, but a litte palate as well. A little talcy, but very drinkable considering the abv."
"One I'll definitely have again."
"This is a fantastic beer."
"D_Very drinkable with no trace of the alcohol. Dangerously drinkable, I am surprised it has taken me this long to try this offering from a brewery I discovered a long time ago."
"The aroma was crisp and smelled of fruit, primarily of bananas and citrus. The taste was a little bready with that yeast strain making itself noticed. On the back end it left you with a moderate bitterness that mocked the back of the throat. It was well carbonated and you have a fruitiness that won't go away. Primarily the bananas. Overall this was a wonderful beer."
"Thanks to SkinnyElvis for this Halloween '08 treat!"
"Notes: I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've been drinking it all summer thanks to the king of Vitus... CBobs."
"A gem."
"D: Excellent mouthfeel and taste combination. This beer is one of the best examples of this style and any wheat beer."
"Wonderfully drinkable beer. Hard to believe that it's 7.7%! So happy to try on tap."
"Smooth body with just a touch of prickleyness (is that even a word?) on the tongue. A little bit warming, but the alcohol isn't really noticed. Extremely drinkable. The extra bottle I bought is now gone. I'll be picking more of this up on my next visit to the store."
"The alcohol is a little more pronounced, the herbal character more prominent, and the mouthfeel a touch less creamy. Great beer."
"I've passed this beer up over and over again for the last year. I like all that Weihenstephaner does but I just kept passing this one up in favor of American micros. Thanks for talking this up so much ColoradoBobs, hard to tell when I would have tried it had it not been for your constant pimping."
"Drinkability is huge, got to say Bobs you called it on this one, what else you got?"
"Overall, this is quite tasty. Its a bit different than a traditional weizenbock. Its quite tasty and fairly easy to drink. Still it has tons of character and satisfies nicely."
"My first weisenbock, I'm enjoying the new flavors of which I haven't found in other German styles. Nothing to compare it to s till leaves me feeling this is another ""best"" from Weihenstephaner."
"Pours a dirty murky straw color with a tall dense white head that dissipates into a light cap. I was a little surprised by the straw color, expected brown. The aroma is fantastic, bananas and clove, lemon and a touch of metal. The taste is of banana creame pie, the extra malt presence gives Vitus a smoother taste than their Hefe. There is a nice rustic and earthy flavor to this. The feel is moderate, with soft carbonation, giving the brew a velvety smoothness, finishes sweet but in balance, very nice. Another exceptional brew from Weihenstephan. Great hefe flavors with a nice silky feel."
"3.5-4 drinkability: very good brew. not the sort of thing i'd want every day, but this should be enjoyed at least several times a year."
"I've never run across a German Weizenbock quite like this. I've had U.S. brewed ""Imperial Hefes"" that are a little like this but not nearly as good. It's basically a Big Ass Hefeweizen suitable as a winter warmer with all the refreshing character of a great Weiss Bier. Now that I know of this bier, I will probably have lots of it."
"D- This is very drinkable, especially at 7.7%. The alcohol is well hidden. I would rank this as second place for weizenbocks in my book."
"Bottom line: This is a very well crafted Weizenbock and when it comes down to it, I prefer it over the also excellent Aventinus. I wish it was available locally."
"Pretty damn drinkable, what a great beer."
"Notes: Outstanding!!!"
"Revisited 1/23/2010."
"I could drink a whole lot of this, and probably will. Thanks ColoradoBobs, for making me have this beer."
"Taste is amazing - perfectly balanced. Banana and clove, bready yeast, pepper and lemon. Hefeweizen's big brother, but deeper and more complex. Amazingly refreshing for all this. Dances on the tongue with phenolic goodness and ample carbonation, finishes peppery and light. Amazingly drinkable, any time. A perfect summer/fall wheat ale."
"D- A solid beer no question and one I would definitely pick up again."
"D - it's easy to drink this tasty brew."
"Drinkability: Really good for this..its refreshing, and light (on taste only). Alcohol level is a bit of a surprise, but I could have a couple of these with no worries."
"overall i really liked tihs beer and reccomend it to anyone who likes wheat or even ones who think they dont like wheat beers....this could change your mind...my only regret about this beer is that i didnt buy a bunch of them...need to go back and get more really soon.."
"This beer is crisp and refreshing and one of the most sessionable weizenbocks that I've ever had. It's a must try."
"D- easy to finish, id like another. the alcohol is well hidden. this one could sneak up on you before you know it. too bad its not served at ball parks, this one would be great sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley."
"d: Good and very easy drinking beer. Shocked to see how high the abv was. Similar to their hefe, but with more spice and much more booze (though you won't notice it)."
"D: Fantastic beer, only $2.99, but difficult to find in my area. I will definitely pick up another bottle when I see it."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a nice tasty and easy drinking beer. Would be a great go to beer for the Summer. Would be more than happy to sip this one again sometime..."
"Drinkability: this may be my newest favorite beer with this brewery. Alcohol will catch up to you, but a few of these can easily be slowly consumed. Must try this one."
"Delicious, floral, fruity, honey. Bumping the taste score by a half point."
"Smooth and easy to drink for a beer this big, another winner for Weihenstephan."
"A pale golden color with a creamy beige head and excellent lace. Beautifull looking brew, just a little light in my opinion. The nose has wheat malts, citrus fruits some rich candies. The taste is similar, more of a weizen than a bock. Ripe tropical fruits, wheaty grains, spicy yeasts and carmelized sugars. Medium body is well carbonated. Fantastic drinkability. More of an imperial hefeweizen than a weizenbock, but still very good. I am never let down by anything from weihenstephan."
"Man, I'm torn between giving this a really good review because I thoroughly enjoy the beer, or giving it a marginal review because I don't think it represents the style very well. Oh my, what a conundrum. Screw it, it's a good beer, even if it's not the best weizenbock. It's a bit boozy in the end, but a totally drinkable brew here. Give me more Vitus!"
"This beer reminds me of the seasons changing, cool fall evenings, Thanksgiving, Christmas...but worth a try anytime if you can get it. Very approachable & recommended."
"D: Definite drinkable, I just had a hard time believing that this was a weizenbock."
"Very drinkable and tasty brew. However, I don't get the complex dark fruit aspect I had expected from a weizenbock, and the yeasty character was unexpectedly strong. Instead, I would call this an 'uber-hefe' as this is in my opinion a truly wonderful hefe."
"Poured into a Weizen glass, which it filled with a giant, gratifying, puffy head that took its time dissipating. Unfiltered, so it's cloudy in the glass but still quite bright in color. The aroma is not a typical wheat-beer aroma; although there's plenty of banana and clove, a strong whiff of citrus is there along with a bit of what my wife described as ""can."" Tin, perhaps. The taste is what you would expect from a wheat beer, but the alcohol is high enough to add more spice and some bitterness that a weizen with a lower ABV lacks. While tasty, the Vitus is a bit too boozy a wheat beer for my liking. Worth a try, nonetheless."
"Taste is nice, definitely some alcohol there, but the fruitiness, carbonation and typical Hefeweizen-like profile-- yeasty phenols and the like-- balance the booze. Luscious, creamy mouthfeel. One of the most drinkable strong beers (7.7%) I've had. Maybe I don't know any better, but the Vitus is essentially like a Hefeweizen cranked up a notch or two. If you want a strong beer that's also refreshing, look no further. The Vitus doesn't strike me as terribly complex and heavy, but that's not a bad thing."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a huge white head that lingers, making thick lacing down the glass. The smell is doughy and fruity -- lots of banana, as is to be expected. Taste moves from subtle fruit to sharp yeast snap to big clovey fruit to a hot hop bitterness -- very complex and delicious. It's got a nice smooth, full body to it, very foamy but not too fizzy. It's a quenching drink for being so big a beer. I generally just have one 0.5 L bottle at a time: plenty but not too much."
"D - This is a great beer, it is like their hefeweizen amped up a little. It is delicious beer, Weihenstaphaner delivers yet again. However, having more than a couple could make you start feeling a little too good due to the 7.7% alcohol content."
"M/D - A very full bodied and chewy feel. Great carbonation brings the beer to life. An excellent beer. While not your typical weizenbock, but still damn tasty."
"D: Great taste and aroma. This is definitely a great beer and one of the first and only beers I've had in this style. I will definitely be exploring this style further. I still can't believe this is German and not Belgian as the properties are very similar. It still has that malty Bock feel to it though so connoisseurs could still identify this accurately...but it'd be a tough call. This is like a fusion of a German Hefe and a Belgian Wit with the ABV of a Bock. Awesomeness."
"D= Wow, this was a damn good beer, easily the best German weiss bier I have ever had. I can see myself drinking a bunch more of these!"
"In mid-March of 2009, Vitus finally made it into Georgia, thanks to the help of a devoted group of Vitus Advocates. And this led me to discover that Vitus purchased right here at home looks, smells, tastes, feels, and generally drinks better than Vitus purchased elsewhere. Thank God Vitus is finally here!"
"Weihenstephaner is my undiputed favorite brewer. Served in my Weihenstephaner hefeweizen glass. Copper color with strong aroma of bananas and cloves. Detected scent of lemon? I could could have several of these if it weren't over 7% abv. Highly recommended."
"Highly carbonated, but not overly so. Medium body with a sticky banana pith finish. Classic Weihenstephaner drinkability."
"Succulent feel with a powdery linger that whispers again and again, ""Cocoa-covered-bananas are gooood!"" Superb drinkability. Another winner from a brewery that only brews winners."
"Medium full body for a wheat, slight stickiness, nice effervescence. Good stuff overall."
"D - Almost too drinkable. Probably the most drinkable 7%+ beer I've had."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, but it's not at the top of my list. As I said, the alcohol is too prevalent in the taste department. Not bad, otherwise."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep yellow, some darker orange highlights, big dense, creamy white head fades very slowly, leaves behind big clumps of lacing on the glass. The bubbles put on a show in the glass. Spicy clove and banana aroma, some lemon. Taste is banana bread, with a big dose of lemony tartness, spicy clove. Creamy mouthfeel, and just a touch of stickiness, but still pretty refreshing. I might not have tried this if it weren't for all the recent chatter about this beer...which is what makes BA great! This one is extremely tasty."
"Not really what I expected in a weizenbock, but it's still very tasty. Good stuff."
"enjoy it, try it, or CB will find you"
"D: High in ABV, but wonderful in flavor. I could drink a few of these. Yet *another* great beer from Weihenstephan. Then again, they should have everything perfected by now--they've only had almost 1,000 years to work on it."
"D: I'd say this beer lives up to the recent hype around it, incredibly drinkable, smooth, flavorful and wonderfully balanced for its size, an excellent beer on a hot August day."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, smooth, and very drinkable for 7.7% abv."
"Pours a nice cloudy yellow/light orange with a beautiful fizzy white head. Nose is solid banana wheat. Taste follows with balls out banana and clovey bubblegum wheat yeast german mouthgasm goodness. Mouthfeel is solid and drinkability is second to none. Hands down one of the best beers and best breweries in the world. Awesome. Thats right ColoradoBobs! AWESOME!"
"MF&D - Good overall mouth feel, much like a good weiss beer, but be careful, at 7.7% ABV this one could sneak up on you."
"D: I don't think i've had a weizenbock this estery. The Schneider-Brooklyner had the hops to balance them out while this is more ""traditional", I guess. However, I have a problem drinking sweeter beers and this is no different. A well-crafted beer, nonetheless."
"Weihenstephaner Vitus pours a hazy yellow with a thick white head from a brown half liter bottle. Banana, bubblegum and clove are all present in the aroma. Lots of banana and bubblegum in the taste. A touch of clove too. Honey and wheat are also present. Excellent, I was a bit surprised by the color, but it's really nice."
"Opinion: I actually like this beer quite a bit...and that surprises me as there are some of the flavors that I find rather objectionable in other light HefeWeizen brews. This beer has enough malt presence and supporting flavors to keep the palate confused enough to be able to focus on any one thing. This is a really complex beer. It doesn't have the dark fruit presence of Aventinus, but is still a good brew in its own right."
"This is a tremendous beer. What a brewery they have going over there- time has done them well. A beautiful beer."
"Drinkability: Really enjoy the balanced and complex flavor profile; who knew a weizenbock could be so pale?"
"Drinkability: This was suprisingly good, I'll have to retry the hefe which did little for me the first time around. Though the Korbinian was also impressive."
"D - Full delicious flavor with a slightly high alcohol level. Maybe not a session ale, but nonetheless a beer style that cant be passed up. This is the first weizenbock that I've experienced, and I must say it has opened a new door to me in the world of wheat beers. I love it!!!!"
"D- The nice dry flavors make this beer smooth and easy to drink with the flavor and aroma really enhancing each other. The lemon notes are very pleasant but get a bit tangy when it warms. Although there are some light alcohol notes it doesn't really taste like a 7.7%ABV beer."
"Vitus pours an intriguing bright, hazy yellow color with a huge sticky white head. The nose is big with mellow wheat, banana notes, a subtle woodyness, cloves and other spices. A smooth wheat texture is the first thing i noticed, no graininess just a velvety smooth body. The banana and cloves carry over from the nose and produce the balance of its taste. A semi-sweet banana/apricot/peach after taste lingers and there is not sign of the 7.7% abv. Lightly carbonated, hidden strength, just enough complexity, this one is a knock out."
"Mouthfeel attempts to combine the unique sensation produced by a proper amount of carbonation and wheat, but doesn't come off just right. Highly drinkable beer that may be better suited to a cool autumn afternoon than a blazing summer day, but I would gladly enjoy this offering during any climate."
"Overall: This beer is delicious and a pleasure to drink, perfect for a summertime beer if you want the refreshing quality of a hefe with a little more to it. Great beer."
"I got none of the Weizenbock strength or dark fruit taste. I just rated this one as a good drinking experience, it is probably not a great Weisenbock, but I would certainly drink it again."
"My first Weizenbock. To me, it seems like a hefe with a bunch of alcohol. Overall, a good beer from a a great German brewery."
"This is like a pumped up hefe, rather than most of the weizenbocks I have had. Really smooth, which is surprising for its strength. Another great beer from one of the best in the world."
"D - A great Weizenbock - Very glad to have tasted this. It is as refreshing as it is strong which is the equivalent of drinkable to my taste buds. A great summer drink and makes other Weizenbock's I have tasted seem medicinal and thrown together. I really recommend this beauty."
"Drinkability- Amazingly drinkable for the abv. I could drink these outside in the sun all day, which is saying a lot for a winter release. This was my second experience, and I'll have a tough time not going back to buy more."
"Overall this is a very drinkable brew. I will definitely purchase this one again without a second thought. It's a well rounded weizenbock with very few flaws."
"D- I would say very drinkable. Goes very well with a hot day."
"Poured into a true pint glass, a very nice cloudy golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, huge two-finger plus creamy white head, lots of creamy sticy white lacing through out the drink. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some bananna and coriander notes, also a nice touch of caramel. The taste is awesome, sweet, malty, yeasty, fruity, with some spiceyness. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is a true classic, never been disappointed in this brewery's brew's, highly recommended."
"Pours a much lighter, cloudy gold in color than I was expecting. I was expecting something more along the lines of a Korbinian. This is more like a amped up Hefe. Huge, pillowy head on the pour. Plenty of the banana and clove in the nose and flavor. Some hops show up in the taste to help out. Decent beer, but it's a Hefe!"
"Ridiculously drinkable, with a lively mouthfeel."
"bought downtown after the 'beer meeting' ... pours a hazy golden yellow ... big foam, lacing is all of A+ .. very smooth and drinkable .. is there such a thing as a session weizenbock ... decent flavour, not as refined or full as aventinus.. decent and all that sherpa stuff.. gunga guluga..."
"notes supplemented and some scores altered with a bottle from Farm Fresh in Hampton, VA...09/09/08 (a steal at $2.99)"
"Found at State Line Liquor. A great example of the style, this draws you in with a sweet wheat honey aroma. Mild chocolate brown with initially a large white head, that quickly dissipitates. Medium mouthfeel, and not very complex. But very drinkable."
"Served in a weizen glass. Poured a translucent straw gold. Five inch fluffy, off-white head with excellent retention. Some strands of sticky lacing present during the tasting, but inconsistently spattered across the walls of the glass. Scents of light wheat up front with bubblegum and clove elements not far behind. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of banana and yeast flavors that come across towards the back. Consistency was light without being watery, and pleasantly effervescent across the tongue before culminating in a mild alcohol astringency at the finish. I haven't had too many weizenbocks, but this went down very easy."
"A very respectable balanced beer with a bit of muscle, but still very crisp and refreshing."
"D - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit to me it was almost like an imperial hefe it has va very good taste making it easy to drink worth trying sometime"
"This brewery can do no wrong."
"1 pint 0.9oz bottle: Pours a cloudy golden with a slight orange hue and a nice large head that lingers. Aroma has got the definite wiezen characteristics. A nice orange and lemon citrus spritz, banana, wheat overtones, spiced similar to a hefe. Taste is nicely robust and mouth filling. I was basically expecting a Hefe but this is nicely complex. A nice bite of citrus and wheat really make this a really luscious brew. Overall, Man this stuff is a good wiezen I really like this!"
"The mouthfeel was medium and the body surprisingly full. The carbonation was spritzy and there was a pleasant alcoholic warmth in the finish. I've never had a blond weizenbock until this, but I get exactly what the brewers were going for (I think) and they nailed it. Very nice and a departure from more traditional German brews."
"Yeasty wheat bread twang up front. A hint of noble hop spiciness as well. Tropical fruits and banana sweetness emerge. Rummy alcohol adds some depth. Some bubble gum and clove chime in. Candied banana sweetness peaks near the finish. Lingering yeast and clove. Full-bodied with a thick, proteiny feel. A very good weizenbock that is more in the spirit of an amped up hefeweizen (think Dancing Man Wheat by New Glarus) than a darker, roastier, vinous Aventinus."
"Overall one of the best beers I have had, any style, hands down. I would get this one again in a heartbeat, and it really is a steal at 2.99. Definitely try this one out, no way you could be disappointed."
"is a good drink, but, truth be told, it's not much of a weizenbock. It's more like a slightly-hyped up hefewiezen. Very interesting, though - this brew and the Aventinus mark the borders of the style, and they're both lovely in their own unique ways. Recommended."
"D) I purchase this beer every week, with hot summer days approaching, this beer will quench my thirst."
"Way too drinkable. Despite heavy profile drinks as clean as a regular hefe. Awesome."
"Body is medium, with s velvet soft texture and creamy smooth mouthfeel. THis is a truly sessionable weizenbock. $3.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle."
"Overall, different from other weizenbocks I've had. I was expecting it to be more malt-centric, but it's the yeast that steals the show."
"I'd buy this again. The beers that this brewery produce are very tasty. I've never been dissapointed. I'd buy this again."
"Zum wohl!"
"Imperial hefeweizen? This is not really what I was expecting at all, but I'm not disappointed in the slightest. The alcohol is definitely felt before the end of the glass. Two of these will put me in a happy place. I will buy this beer again, but I will probably try a few more weizenbocks first."
"I give this my strongest stamp of approval, this beer is at least as good as Aventinus."
"D,notes: Lacking dark fruit esters in taste and nose. Easy to drink with a good mouthfeel. A good weizen for the winter months."
"I wish it had yeast in the bottle. Other than that it was a pretty well-behaved Weizenbock, laid back and fairly tasty without an exciting wildness."
"All in all this was a nice beer which I'll certainly have again."
"A unique brew that is like a HW on steroids, with a smoothness that is incredible, while still keeping the pleasant taste lingering well into the aftertaste. A work of art."
"Highly recommended - a bit of a different take on the style."
"Drinkability: This is my first Weissen Bock... but this is quite good. I could have these all day long.... a good session beer if you like weizens."
"Pours very light, hazy yellow-orange color with thick head. Head was way too much but did decipate and left good lacing. Smell was a bit ""hefe like"" with a touch of alochol. Yeast, fruits, and a bit of tartness to it. Taste is good. Taste is a bit sweet with various fruit tones, one sip I'll notice apple, the next pear, even a sweet grape. A slight alcohol warmth as it goes down. Carbonation is a little high, but good, leaves a relatively crisp taste. Overall a pretty drinkable beer. I probably would have scored it higher but the alcohol is well hidden and that could sneak up on you after a few of these easy drinkers."
"Recommended..."
"Very cloudy and hazy yellowish color. I thought it would be darker. Huge expanding foam head. I poured it gently and the foam still gushed rimward. It has heavy clove and light banana and wheat aromas. The clove flavor is heavily evident in the taste as well. A slight sour/bitter aftertaste lingers also. It's a heavy type of beer that goes down like a brick. The 7.7% ABV doesn't really jump out at you. There's no alcohol burn. But it's a thick beer. I thik I'd rather have either a Weizen or a Bock over a Weizenbock in the future."
"A classic weizenbock, but also light in color and the flavor was a little tamer than some other weizenbocks I have tried. It's certainly a solid beer. Recommended."
"Taste of a strong Weizen, phenolic yeast with moderate bananas and little clove. Alcohol is not strong. Bitterness is very low. A good solid strong Weizenbock, which should have had a little caramel malt in there, but apparently my thoughts around what a Weizenbock is, are not OK. Still I think a Weizenbock is dark."
"Had to try this on tap - an extremely cloudy, orangish body arrived with a decent head and it left lacings down the glass as the head died quickly. A burst of citric notes when I smelled it; haven't really smelled a hefe that powerful which is amazing in this case since this isn't even a hefe. Orange, banana, pineapple or pear, along with pepper and I want to say there's clove in there, maybe coriander. First thing that struck me about this beer was how smooth it was while retaining a large citric flavor and packing the spices on the backend. There's no hop bitterness at all, just orange and lemon mostly on the tastebuds with the pepper/clove on the backbite. Also a little sweet on the sides, like they put sugar in or something (bubblegum?). Sitting at the bar with this on tap, I could drink it all night. A little filling, and with the high ABV I didn't persist the issue but a great beer that I will have again."
"D - Outstanding brew, but it's potency severely limits it's quaffability. A must try for Weihenstephaner fans and weizenbock fans alike."
"D: A weizenbock that drinks like a Heff. Interesting and really well done. Would love to sit around a backyard and drink this during the summer."
"D-Pretty easy to drink with only the ABV to watch out for"
"Overall, an exceptional and weird beer. Not everyone will like this. I do . . . a lot!"
"Overall, I was very pleased with this. It wasn't anything like I expected, but I really enjoyed it."
"I really like this beer, and this being my second good experience with the weizenbock category I definitely enjoy these beers."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color weizenbock (kinda light of the style) with a huge foamy white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of banana ester with some cloves and fresh fruits. Taste is also dominated by some nice wheat malt note with loads of fruity, banana and cloves ester. The yeast really works wonderfully in this beer. Full body with loads of lees and great carbonation. I wish I had access to quality stuff like that every day."
"Half liter bottle. The beer pours a palt straw color with a 3 finger ivory head over top. This one is exceptionally turbid, with a steady stream of carbonation bubbling up. The color strikes me as unexpected. I was looking to see something a little darker. The aroma is big in banana, clove, and wheat creamyness. There is a zesty lemon tartness as well, but it is lacking the deeper malt notes of melanoidans and dark fruits that I was wanting to find. Don;t get me wrong, this is a very nice smelling beer, but I am not getting weizenbock out of this at all. The flavor brings a light golden raisin fruityness and wheat creamyness. Behind this, a prevalent clove ester and lemon zest character comes through. The banana hits on the finish, carrying it through to the end. This is another magnificent wheat beer from this brewery. Mouthfeel is moderate, creamy, and smooth, with a prevalent moderate carbonation. Overall, this one is very nice. I don't think it is fair to put it against weizenbocks, as it is just not brining me much to think it is under that style. It is a very nice beer."
"the drinkability is quite good, especially considering a nearly 8% abv. overall a very good beer that i wil most certainly have again if i can find it. not quite what you'd expect from a weizenbock, more like a beefy hefe, but hey, who's counting?"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D: The labeling of this beer is deceiving; its only characteristic that it shares with other weizenbocks is its ABV. This one instead drinks more like a stronger version of their Hefe, which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
"Brauerei Weihenstephan is not only the oldest brewery in the world, it's also one of the best. Purists may scoff at the idea of an 'Americanized' version of a timeless classic, but there is plenty of room for both. Vitus is amazing beer and is destined to be a multiple bottle purchase whenever I'm lucky enough to run across it."
"I found this one to be not rich enough for my liking. It did not entice me to keep drinking it, and I did not find my fondness for it increasing sip by sip. I thought the mouthfeel was kinda thin, which surprised me, as I quite like Weihenstephaner HefeWeiss. I have a feeling that this one merits a revisit, and possibly then, an edited review, but until that time, these are my thoughts."
"D - Damn good drink. Is this what Imperial Hefe's are trying to be? Will drink again soon!"
"D: Great, great stuff. A prototypical wheat beer. Highly recommended."
"-Oelergud"
"This is great. Yeah, the Reinheitsgebot may have done as much harm as good to the potential of Germany's beers, that's totally debatable...but also a moot point with a beer this great."
"Pours a cloudy orange/golden, massive white head forms, slowly settles down to a thick layer, leaves behind a ton of chunky lacing. Very nice to look at! Smell is nice, tons of banana, yeast, wheat, spices, very fruity, some alcohol makes its way in, but quite soft. Taste is different, apples and bananas, some wheat, very yeasty, bread, cane sugar, some alcohol, more apple in the finish with a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, bit of warmth. Pretty light for a weizenbock but I like it."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, to me this is simply an amped up version of the best Hefeweizen I've ever had. The brewery calls it a Weizenbock, but regardless of how it's classified, this is an excellent beer overall."
"As soon as I'm done...I want another. Which is perhaps the simplest endorsement one can give."
"Medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden. Very well done."
"Typical Weihenstephaner German mid sized bottle, pours cloudy light apricot, long lasting near white head and leaving ample lacing. Nose glows with hints of soapy sweetness, fruit and cloves. Great old old school brrwery, nice to try a different offering. Easy drinking, yeasty, more coriander and then cloves. Soft, wheaty flowing and smooth mouthfeel. Well worth a try."
"D: High. Easy to drink, but dangerous..."
"Overall a unique German beer. I'm still not completely sure what to think of it. The malt flavors got a bit cloying toward the end, so perhaps a smaller seving size would be in order (I had full pint). Definitely worth trying..."
"Interesting beer, but not one I'll specifically seek out, I think."
"D: Maybe a taaad tinny and sweet, but still quite enjoyable. It remains pretty easy to drink with only the ABV to watch out for a bit."
"D & Notes: Tastes much more like a beefed up a hefeweizen than a strong dunkleweizen, which is usually not what one expects from a weizenbock. That being said, it is a very good brew, and at 7.7% ABV, sneaks up on you in a hurry, as it does have easy drinkability of a wheat beer. I tend to like a weizenbock to be a bit darker and include some caramel flavor, but this is a very good beer and one I could see buying again."
"Okay, this is a seriously drinkable beer. 7.7%ABV be damned. Vitus reaffirms my love for wiezenbocks and Brauerei Weihenstephan as my favorite German brewery. A superlative brew that you should get your grubby hooks on. I gotta find this on-tap somewhere...Proschli!!"
"Drinks a little slow, due to the heft & a bit too much cloves for my liking. Hefe-freaks should love this. A nice change of pace, I couldn't session on it though"
"A light touch of bitterness and peppery in the end."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable, even for the level of alcohol."
"Highly recommended, if you can find it."
"A pint is good for me. Definitely a good beer. You cant go wrong with Weihenstephaner really. Not on par with Aventinus but definitely up there."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, pale and wheat malt scent. It's refreshingly fruity and full of carbonation. I was really expecting something darker. The taste is good as well. It has a crisp, pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean with some fruity yeast esters. The elevated abv. is hidden quite well in this one. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good tasting beer. It's like nothing I've ever tried. It's a pale weizenbock with little warmth and all the drinkability of a regular hefe; very nice."
"All in all, drinkable and enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a very soft yet crackling carbonation. Great balance. Not too sweet as many hefes can be (much less weizenbocks). No alcohol flavor. At 7.7% ABV, this beer is every bit as drinkable as a 5% hefe. Simply delicious. I would put it up there with Aventinus for sure (words I never thought I'd say in regards to weizenbocks), but then again it's been a while since I had one."
"D - This is a really good brew. Since the flavors were not quite as big as the aromas, the beer becomes very drinkable."
"Prosit!"
"Edit: Why, oh why, can't an American brewer make something like this? Crisp, refreshing, full of wheat and yeast flavor - all while being dangerously drinkable."
"Pours hazy pale gold, with a typical big white rocky head one expects from a Bavarian wheat beer. Nose is traditional weizen, only more so. Lots of banana-like phenols, along with some green apple and clove. Not much in the way of hops, but a faint wheat character. Flavor is much sweeter than a regular weizen, again with lots of banana and some clove. Finish is fruity, with lots of green apple, and some dry, bready wheat character. Little bit full bodied for the flavor."
"Good beer, drinks easy, but an ABV of 7.7 will send the man with the 'sledge'hammer soon. So I would not take more than two a night."
"Notes: I love this brewery and even though this was not one of my favorites it was still an above average brew."
"This pours with a medium head and very cloudy. The head goes away but leaves a small bubbly top. Lace was not very evident. Nose is fruity, yeasty and a tad spicy. Taste is not as complex as the Hefeweisbier which is truly a favorite of mine. The fruit is nice the yeast/bread taste is nice but something is just not quite there. I will enjoy this beer again though as this is better than any American wheat I have tried."
"Appearance is a cloudy, yellow-gold with a thin head. Smell is muted compared to a standard hefe, but bananas and cloves can still be detected. Taste has enhanced tanginess of the hefe, other flavors somewhat muted. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and not completely satisfying. Drinkability is good for a beer of this abv. All and all, not my favorite offering from Weihenstephan, but still very good."
" Bring on the Batzen. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"D- i like my brews with the alcohol at a tamer state, quite filling and definitely not sessionable, complex brew but i just couldn't enjoy it"
"Drinkability- Thinking a cross between a hefeweizen and a belgian strong pale...with just a touch of weizenbock thrown in. Definite summer brew. If your at the beach and lacking your banana now and laters, grab one of these, it will do the trick."
"Weizenbock has recently become one of my favorite styles. The fact that this brewery has decided to produce one is awesome. Poured in to a weizen glass a murky orange, with a large white head that dissolved very quickly. Aroma is very clean, with bits of bread, clove and banana. Taste is round and tasty, with more bread and banana coming through. This one seems a little bit light for the style in body, but at the same time the alcohol does not show itself at all. This would make a nice session beer. Maybe not the best Weizenbock I have tasted, but certainly an interesting one."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with an orange hue. The head is a couple fingers of creamy white that takes its time to fade and laces spots. Smells spicy, banana, pepper, coriander and clove. Taste begins with sweet malt followed by the wheat and spice. Medium in the mouth and a delightful twist on a wheat beer. So drinkable that it would be a delight to session."
"Pours a cloudy yet bright orangish color with a thick white head that leaves plenty of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is of citrus and some spices like coriander, and with a little trace of honey. Sweet taste with no hint of a bitter finish. Refreshing carbonation as well in the mouth feel. Very light and fluffy."
"Alcohol is very well hidden. Very easy to drink."
"I drink mostly heavy beers so this one was pretty nice and balanced to me. If your used to drinking weaker beers it might be pretty robust but still drinkable. If you enjoy the Weihenstephaner Hefeweisen then do youself a favor and try this one this winter."
"D - This is very similar to the Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen but 'turned up to 11'. It's quite wonderful and a great desert beer."
"The beer emerges from the 500ml bottle a beclouded golden yellow with an orange tint, the head behemothic in size, and a brilliant creamy white, as it fades slowly, the resultant lace is a fine veil to obscure the glass. Nose has an earthy aroma, spices also present, coriander and cloves come to mind, light and clean. Start has a sweet grain presence, with the top light to medium in feel. Finish as a benign acidity, the earthy, soapy sweetness continues to the dry aftertaste, a nice drinking beer, but did seem a little thin to me, with the hop presence very subdued, nonetheless, worthy of a sample."
"D: I don't think I will be finishing this one. It's drinkable, but the strong alcoholic flavor in the taste after the swallow kills my appetite."
"with a really bad aftertaste I thought. The beer tasted old or out of date to me me which makes me have to say NO, I will not try again."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, great flavor that I could have several of."
"Needless to say, I'm a fan of this brew. Recommended."
"Taste is much like the Hefe again, a bit fuller mouthfeel with stronger alcohol presence. Clove and banana mostly, fairly juicy mouthfeel. Creamy as well, as to be expected from the brewery's other offerings. Not the full-bodied robustness expected of Weizenbocks like Aventinus. It would be great in the spring or summer, but just not the big Weizenbock I was expecting on a cool fall night."
"Overall, a damn fine beer, although slightly misleading. I picked up the bottle thinking this may be a Weihenstephaner version of Aventinus. I was wrong. This seems to be much more akin to being an ""Imperial Hefe"". Perhaps the traditional German breweries are starting to take cues from us Americans? Either way, I don't care. It's a delicious beer, that is very well made, and one that I look forward to having again in the near future."
"d: this was an oddity -- tasted more like an excellent tripel than a weizenbock, but had many characteristics of the latter. bottom line - an excellent brew that i've rarely seen & worth looking for"
"500 mL bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a perfect cloudy straw. I probably would have given a perfect score for appearance if this was a hefeweizen and not a weizenbock, as this is the lightest weizenbock I have ever seen. Definitely not to style. Nice wheaty and yeasty aroma. It certainly does fit the weizenbock profile in its flavour though. Strong flavours - wheat, yeast, banana. The alcohol feels evident - or that could just be the aftereffects of the Indian dinner. I am liking this significantly better than Weihenstephaner's dunkelweizen, but then again, I'm a big fan of this style."
"Highly recommended"
"Very drinkable for a weizenbock. The alcohol is present but not overbearing. The sweetness doesn't get to you either. Well done."
"A clean, full-bodied hefeweizen. Stays true to wheat beer character in a stronger, yet still easy to drink version. A very nice beer!"
"Not the most complex beer of this type but there is certainly no way that I would fail to finish a bottle of this stuff. Most Weizenbocks have a lot extra flavor levels that this one lacks but they also have some funky aspects too as a trade off, this one doesn't. What this does well is just taste good and please the tongue. Good and a little sweet but I will for sure buy this beer again."
"hazy golden straw color with a white head that reduces itself to a thin coating that sticks around and leaves a little clumpy lace here and there. smells of banana and spice like it should, with a touch of yeasty goodness. tastes true to the style. like banana, a hint of clove, some spicy nutmegy peppery stuff and a faint malty and even fainter hoppy finish. a little lighter bodied than expected, but nice creamy, well carbonated mouthfeel. weihenstephaner has never dissapointed me, and i doubt they ever will. always a pleasure."
"EDIT: Now that his is sold over here in the US, I've been buying and and continuing to enjoy it. One note I keep getting (and enjoying) is a vanilla character. As this one warms, that comes out more and more. Yummy stuff!"
"D = Very drinkable."
"D: So drinkable, it's scary. This may be due to my limited experiences with Weizenbocks, but I wasn't expecting a beer anything near this when I first sipped it. This beer is incredible! This definitely needs to come to the states."
