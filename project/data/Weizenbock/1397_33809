Pours to a translucent deep brown with a tan multi-bubble head that recedes quickly..  On the taste this brew hits with some chalky cocoa upfront with some earthy hops and transitions to a sweeter chocolate and toasted malt background with a spicy but clean flat bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but with all the flavors its not an issue.  This is unbelievably a 7.4 ABV, would never guess that.  My type of brew: standout basic flavors (particularly cocoa), not complex, but very drinkable.","mooseisloose","Dec 14, 2014"

I pulled it out of a fridge at 37deg but as it warmed to room temp the flavor and mouthfeel was enhanced. It was a real enjoyable beer. I'll be drinking again, for sure.
