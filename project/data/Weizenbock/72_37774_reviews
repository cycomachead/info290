"And in that insanity, there is a remarkable beer."
""
""
"Very different.  I liked the hop flavor, but to me it tasted like someone took and IPA and mixed it into an unfiltered wheat beer.  It was good but nothing that really blew my mind."
"Good one beer. recommended. yes"
""
"Overall:  There are certainly things to like about this beer, but the lack of balance put me off. I'll definitely opt for the Aventinus over this one in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty combination of flavors is at work in this beer. The collaboration style works for me - the nose and appearance of a Hefeweizen, combined with IPA elements, is both interesting And satisfying. It is hard to describe, but somehow I like it."
""
"83/100"
""
"So fresh and citric flavour."
""
"Pale golden body with mild haze and scattered sediment. Aromas of fruity esters, orange zest, wheat, clove, subtle spice, grass, floral hops. Alcohol heat is a little too prevalent, coming in mid-palate. Medium to thick body with a syrupy, resinous hop bill. The nose is better than the flavor. Decent."
""
""
"O:  a noisy tasting experience.  there seem to be a lot going on in this beer, and may not necessarily be the best thing."
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a 500 ml (16.9 ounce) brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O = An interesting take on a weizenbock, but lacking balance in all areas of the style."
"Have been drinking this since the white label, and I went to pick some up at my local Spec's, but only this new gold label was there. I passed on it twice because I didn't bother to look up the label change or if it was a new beer. The old one has white, green, and blue, with ""Tap 5"" printed on it. This new label threw me off, but it's still the same Hopfen Weisse."
""
"Hazy yellow colour, with sediments. Great white head with a lot of retention. Aromas is mostly banana, cloves and mango, but there are many subtle other things: spices, pine. Creamy palate and very noticeable alcohol, like brandy. Taste of banana, mango, cloves, fruits, spices. Easily, the best german wheat I've tasted to this day."
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid sipper for this damp Fall Texas day while watching the TX/OU annual classic."
"Pretty darn good, even though it's not my go-to style of beer. A little over-sweet, not as big an enthusiast of the dark fruit taste, but nice bock flavor with extra BK hoppiness. Amazing bouquet."
""
""
"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 15C, adapted). Bottle 50 cl - Batch 2719121113. AROMA: a very pleasant combination of hop aromas (floral and pine) with wheat, bock-like notes (dried fruits) and vanilla phenols. APPEARANCE: amber color and hazy. medium moussy, slight ivory head with average retention. TASTE: a very rich combination of bock components (bread, vanilla), some dark fruits, with a wheat background and hop flavours (citrusy and floral). low bitterness with a somewhat dry finish, some alcohol warmth. PALATE: medium-full body with moderate carbonation. some alcohol sensation. OVERALL: a very good weizen bock with a floral hop twist."
""
""
"The warmth from the alcohol tells me this is a great autumn beer; could pass for summer, too.  Hell, I'm going to drink this all the time, now.  It's that damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was great, a great style beer with a mouthful of hops. Great for sipping (pretty heavy and higher ABV). Its finally starting to cool down from summer to fall here and this is a perfect beer for tonight."
""
"Poured from 500ml bottle.  Aroma of orange with a bit of grass.  Appearance is a cloudy golden with thick white head.  Taste is a light sour.  Medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation, with a bitter slightly dry finish.  An amazingly smooth beer, it is hard to believe has 8.2% alcohol."

"Overall not bad, a big time beer that I wasn't really expecting from a brewery like this, nice wheat, bit too booze forward and way too sweet candy like for my taste, but fits the style. Hops are a bit too muted up front, then too spicy and strong on the back end, like they didn't blend in too well. Enjoyable but can't drink a lot of it. 4"

"Pours a milky orange from the bottle. Just a bit of an off-white head that dissipates rapidly, leaving a bit of lacing. The nose screams fruit, particularly banana and berries, along with citrus and malt. As you would expect, the fruit hits your tongue first. Bananas, pineapple, mango and some spice. The alcohol becomes more pronounced as it warms. There's a nice sweetness to this one. Medium, chewy mouth. I'm not a huge fan of wheats or dopplebocks, but this is really, really good. A very nice collaboration."

"A good beer and one that benefited from the extra hops in both the taste and smell. Whilst it was a pleasant beer I think I'd be put off buying it all that often based on the fact that it is a lot stronger and harder to get a hold of that several other German wheat beer."

"O: An interesting beer. Not something I would drink all the time or would really look out for but it was interesting. I don't really think it ranks as high as everyone say's it does but one can tell it is definitely a product that was well invested in and brewed integrity."

"This beer was a strange cross between an American ale and a German weisse...reminded me of a dream I had once about Ryan seacrest getting raped in a ditch off the side of the autobahn by Adolph hitler...and then Ryan giving birth 9 days later to a moustached tanned baby with sauerkraut for hair...not a bad beer"

"O: second time having this - the first time, years ago when it came out, I hate to admit, I may have drunk straight from the bottle while liquored up one night... mildly astonished just how flavorful and enjoyable this beer is... this bottle was only a couple months old - kinda curious how some of the older bottles I have compare... this is a wonderful hoppy alternative to your ubiquitous IPAs"
"A perfect summer beer. Its a perfect balance between a weissen and an Ipa. You have the mouthfeel, the cloudyness, and the yeast taste from a schneider and you add hop. If youre a hop head and you want something crist, clear, clean and tasty, thats the beer you want to try."

"O: A little too much sweet malt, especially when compared with what I expected based on the aromas. It's a solid concept, but to my taste a little more hops balance would have made it even better; the hops added fruitiness, but not much bitterness (I'm not saying they should hop it up to DIPA levels, just a bit more). Still, it's an enjoyable foray into a hybrid style."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: This is very good!"
""
""
"This is interesting but not something I'd buy again."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very complex beer that almost leaves you lost for words; the best way I can describe it would be the golden-child of a Hefe and IPA. Sweet yet sour, fruity yet bitter, this is a beer which should be experienced for those who love beers which bend boundaries. It is by far the most experimental German beer I've encountered and it does it well."
""
""
""
""
"This is a fantastically unusual and well-brewed beer. Experimentation like and exceptional collaboration such as displayed in this beer are what drive the craft."
""
""
"Pour is hazed deep amber with a good bit of tight white head that lingers for quite some time. Nose is an interesting mix of sweet, spicy and tangy yeast. Lots of bubblegum, lemon, clove and pepper. Its very different, loads of bubblegum mix with the tangy yeast and pepper in back. Taste is much of the same, huge bubblegum up front, lots of sweetness with the yeast characteristics coming in at the back, more tangy with hints of pepper. Lighter body, moderate carbonation, and some lingering citrus hops through the finish."
""
""
"Rather hard to get around here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A top-notch weizenbock sees a generous hopping. On paper it sounds like a forced combination, but this actually fits together very nicely. The spicy herbal dimension points to noble hops, but the lavender? Has to be saphir. I can see this pairing very nicely with some sort of curry."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not top familiar with this style, but this beer is very delicious."

"Obtained bottle from Willow Park liquor store in Calgary. Pours a dark peach amber color with ample white head. Aroma sweet and spicy, reminiscent of baked apple, banana bread, pineapple juice, caramel, honey, and sharp spice, almost like caraway when one factors in the bread and yeast. Smells like a hefeweizen with added fruit and spice. Flavor is complex and includes the expected banana and clove elements but also darker, sweeter malts. This beer is dry-hopped with German designer hop Saphir which adds strawberry sweet fruity notes to the classic German wheat yeasty esters. Malty and fruity, with strawberry and raspberry notes blending with raisin and date flavors from the dark malts. Loads of unripe pineapple that builds over time. Fairly heavy sweet palate gives way to bitter hops and green fruit in the finish. The total package works, maybe sweeter than advertised. More of a weizenbock with unique hop elements than a true fusion of styles."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. If there was a style such as ""German Double IPA", this beer would represent it ;)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a superb beer- a dual continent collab which creates a wheat beer with a different character- deeper spice and fruit."
""

"Updated November 21, 2014 -  I've had this beer on multiple occasions since my original tasting, and well i love this beer. I think I had been a little harsh on the scoring previously, so those have been revised so I think this is a more accurate perception about how I truly feel about this beer."

"O - im impressed by the collaboration here. i had doubts about combining the two styles but they've managed to pull off a pretty good beer here. I felt like the beer smelled more like a weizenbock, but tasted more like an IPA. it was a great drink for me, and i'd probably get a couple more bottles on my next visit to the lcbo. this beer wouldn't be for everybody but its definitely worth a try if you like either of these styles."

"Drinkability : a nice beer in the German style Weizenbock."
""
""
"Overall: Nice hop flavor, complex for the style."
""
""
""
"Beautiful golden color with just a hint of brown. Whir thick creamy layer of foam. Moderate clarity which translates to murky clarity off of the pour. The nose is a cross of wheat and grape fruit like hops. Very intriguing. Very velvety mouthfeel. Definitely wheat on the forefront of the palate quickly followed by some nice grape fruit like finishing hop flavor. This is a truly unique experience. Very refreshing."
"Would have again, no questions. Worth finding."
""
"T- Banana and wheat right out of the gate. After the first sip, I gave it a chance to warm to the proper temp. Thick caramel banana on the tongue, rich and sweet. It has low to medium carbonation, with that hint of clove that was in my nose. The hops adds a peachy mango taste. Interestingly, this beer claims to be extra hoppy for Americans, but without the extra carbonation American beers usually have its still definitely a German beer. Not bad, not mind blowing, absolutely well put together though."
""
""
""
"D: Very nice weizenbock. Not the best I've had, but great flavor and great texture. For 8.2% ABV, the alcohol seems non-existent. I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting."
""
"Though at times seeing things floating in your beer can seem slightly unsettling, the clusters of yeast that appear to be stranded in time are of a comforting manner. It is no different than watching an infinite amount of snowflakes fall in an abundant winter wonderland, or like seeing the stars stranded in the night sky. The smell is not the strongest suit here but it is interesting and definitely not a fault to the beer. The taste is deep and multiple fruity flavors shine through with a roaring kick of booze that has no remorse. I’ve had merely a few dopplebocks in my time but this is a wonderful representation of the style from what I can tell."
""
""
""
""
"A little boozy, but mostly just tasty goodness. A little more aggressive across the board than your typical weiss. It all works."
"O - I am a huge fan of this brewery. This is the hoppiest German beer that I have had. It is a delicious flavor experiment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppiness is definitely there but subdued and well melded so as not to upset the style. Very good."
"The 8.2% ABV is scarily well hidden, and this beer remains a (non-traditional) very pleasant surprise."
"D - I last reviewed this beer 3 years ago with a score of 3.53. Boy have my tastes changed since then. As a long time lover of wheat beers and recently IPAs, I've gained a new appreciation for hopfenweisse style beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Golden yellow in color with an orangish hue and hazy. Poured with a rich white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap that left sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Sharp citrus hop aromas with wheat malt and sweet banana beneath. Creamy smooth feel down the middle with more aggressive, fizzier carbonation on the edges. Tangy pink grapefruit, tangerine and lemon zest hop flavors. Wheat malt backbone with sweet banana, powdery bubblegum and a peppery spicy bite near the end. Finishes with lingering citrus hop and banana sweet aftertaste. A touch of booze sneaks end toward the bottom of the glass. An interesting collaboration brew."

"Taste is firstly bitter hop and herbal grassy notes - then some underlying hefe typical banana and clove, but its crisp yet heavy...some spices sine through. Its super easy to drink and pleasant and very very different. Well worth a buy - especially for $5. There is very little you can fault here; and a lot to gain. Well worth it."

"O - Interesting taste. but i would say the nose is better than the taste. Nose is huge and awesome. Was a bit thinner than i expected. Alcohol is hidden so, so well. really sweet and carmely. not sure if i like the overly sweet wheat/carmel taste."
""
""
""
"o: this is action packed with sweet fruit and yeast flavor and balanced with nice wheat and malt components. at 8.2% this is dangerously drinkable"
""
""
""
"Picked this up at a great little beer store in Arlon, Miorge Mihoublon. Cloudy amber-orange pour with nice two finger fluffy white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is pretty amazing with all the typical Weizenbock character, but with some really nice citrus notes as well. Hints of grapefruit, clove, coriander, tangerine, banana, pear, and white pepper. The taste is even bolder and really complex with a great sweet caramel maltiness that nicely complements the hops. Very fruity and spicy with hints of apple, banana, lemon, apricot, grapefruit, coriander, and cloves. The mouthfeel is crisp and tart and hugely refreshing, but creamy at the same time. The balance is perfect and the drinkability is over the top! Overall, this is an amazingly unique beer that marries the best of an IPA and a Weizen! This is definitely the beer I will miss the most when I leave Germany. The perfect everyday summer beer that also tastes great anytime of the year. Highly recommended!"
"Overall - A rather nice brew that drinks much easier then it should (in light of its 8.2 % abv and more saision like funky flavor)s. It is a rather good drinker and one to try if you get a chance."
""
"OMG! this might be the greatest beer I have ever had!... It is the best of both worlds... the centurys of German knowledge in brewing ...combined with the hop craze on this side of the pond... equals what I would say is a hybrid between an American IPA and a german hefe- weisse!... I can't believe I have never heard of or read any posts on this brew... It is only a matter of time before everyone gets hip to this... and it will be untouchable..."
""
""
""
""
"Really well executed beer. Quite interesting. Hoppiness didn't really stand out too much, but there is a lot of fruity citrus coming through. This seemed like a lighter weizenbock with more light malt and more of a mild noble hop character, I def prefer tap 6, though this is really quite nice, easy drinking yet makes a complex punch. I would get this again, would love to try brooklyn's version."
"an unlikely collaboration, and a beer I really enjoyed. this pours cloudy pale brass color with a good two inch white head. the nose is really hoppy. so many hopfen beers just pay lip service to it, but this one is super hoppy in terms aroma. there is fruity hops, almost citra, but apparently some hallertau variety is used. its more hoppy than almost any other german thing ive had, and I love it. there is also a lot of heavier wheat malt and alcohol taste to this, as well as a very dry finish that is fruity and bitter from these hops. the is entirely unlike any weizenbock ive had out there, and one that I will be coming back to. its a little filling, and the alcohol can get you going pretty quick, but the flavors are fantastic and the mouthfeel works for what it is. really good carbonation on such a full bodied beer is a nice change of pace. overall the highlight of this beer for me is the hop complexion, its big and bold and unique, especially for the style. the is exceptionally well done."

"Overall (3.5): Overall, it’s a pretty good wheat-dominant doppelbock. I was hoping for more hop character, even at its relatively advanced age—the store clerk said that it was JUST put out on the shelves, so I have to assume that even if it’s not super-super fresh, it was as fresh as I was going to get it and that being the case, I’d expect some more hops. It’s enjoyable and drinkable, for sure, but not exactly what I was seeking. I would definitely be interested in trying this fresh-fresh or on tap."
""
""
""
""
"O - haven't enjoyed many wiezenbock treats, but this is an outstanding beer from front to back regardless of style, i could drink this all day and will be making a return trip to the store where I found this for a few more bottles"
""
"Appearance is cloudy and gold, like most hefeweizens, although the head is smaller and fades faster than your typical hefe. The scent is a very nice combination of grapefruit, melon, lemon, and clove. The taste is like a hoppy hefeweizen, with banana and clove flavors meshing nicely with a grapefruit twang. This is an interesting beer, and very enjoyable for someone like me who loves hoppy beers and also wheat beers."
""
""
"I feel like there is just a bit too much going on in this beer. The combo of big yeast character with a noble punch hop is a cool experiment but I wouldn't buy this beer again."
""
"OUTSTANDING, MUST TRY!"
""
""
""
"Appearance is golden to cloudy brown if your pour in the yeast from the bottle. Excellent head and retention. Bubbles slightly larger than some of their other brews. Smell is heavy pine with a nice malt balance. Taste reveals a very well balanced beer with significant hopping to be expected but offset with a molasses malt flavor. Hoppy bitter sweet lingers for a while. Enjoyable."
"Big yeast presence and just the right amount of hops. Very soft feel and delicious. Zero alcohol presence. Great summertime beer."
""
""
"Overall it's very disappoinging. I've had the other collaboration from these brewers and it was excellent. This isn't. Tastes only slightly different than straight alcohol. I'm pleased with the 8.2% ABV, I just don't want to taste it. Almost tastes like a mixed drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a very good weisse beer, not my favourite style but this is probably my favourite weisse to date."
""
"O: a really exceptional beer worth seeking out. [4.25] The best weisse beer I've ever had. Despite the very hoppy aroma, this beer should be drinkable even for many who are not so fond of hop flavor or bitter beers."
""
""
""
""
""

"O-it's an okay beer. Has a lot of complexity to it. It just doesn't seem to flow extremely well. it's not the easiest drinker either."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator Pokal. Pours a cloudy orange amber. One finger white head with decent retention. Pineapple hop, wheat and stone fruit aroma. Wheat, stone fruit with pineapple/citrus hops. Clove in the middle and finish. Very interesting, a weissen crossed with an mild IPA. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice alternative and style attempt. Works well. Will have again."
"Went to this brewery and had it in their beer garden and it was the most interesting beer ive ever had. The citrus aroma blending with the banana and clove yeast by-products produces and absolutely splendid beer. Granted I had this right from the brewery and its always the best there, I also had it in the U.S. and it was almost as good. Still had all the notes that I remembered."
" I love beer and this is the pinnacle of beer making to this point for me."
""
"The balance of this brew is really something great. The new world hops with that grapefruit flavour meets really well with the hefeweizen yeast. I think this mix was especially good because that yeast – for whatever reason – seemed to have a bit less clove. Now, I love clove in my traditional hefeweizens, but this just played it so well. It’s rare that these beers pop up in the LCBO and I love it when they do."
"A great summer brew that proves to be an excellent marriage of old and new styles of brewing. I will definitely be back for this brew many times over as the heat wave continues unabated..."
"Final Grade: 4.19, an A-. This is not the first bottle of Schneider Hopfen-Weisse I've sampled, and unless they stop making it, I sincerely doubt it will be the last. Even though I like both hefes and IPAs, I'd be lying if I said that I initially thought combining them sounded like a good idea. But this is just an unbelievably well-made beer that combines some of the best things about both styles. Worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
"Comnes under name ""Schneider Meine Hopfenweisse Tap5"". Pours cloudy amber beer with off-white head, leaving lots of laces. Heavenly aroma of cloves, banana, citrus and herbal hops. Full-bodied taste of hefeweizen with significant spirituous part. Magnificent complex characteristics!"
"This is a stellar, if un-conventional, Weizenbock. Lots of great noble hop flavors. A must try."
"Hazy peachy coloured body, quite a bit of floating matter in there as well, ring of white head and no lace to speak of. Smell is very hoppy, citrus and tropical fruits, a bit of some yeasty bread like scents but mostly sharp pineapple and citrus and some banana with a bit of alcohol. Taste is also quite hoppy with tart citrus fruits, tropical fruit and a bit of banana, grapefruit and orange flavours, spicy with quite a bit of sweet alcohol present as well, a little astringency. Light carbonation, medium body with a fairly full feel. This was just ok, a bit boozy for my liking and a bit too much sweet hop flavours, I finished both bottles I had but had higher hopes for this beer."
""
"A deftly integrated, duly hoppy, and strong wheat beer, the result more tasty than I may have expected, especially given the presence (absence?) of the full-on Houdini treatment of the big alcohol component. Good stuff, and cheers/Prost to the furtherance of this fruitful and hopful [sic] collaboration."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky, turbid orange-brown with a 2 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, grain, spices, slight hops, and lots of yeast aromas. There is also a bit of a soapy or chalky aroma that I am getting as well. Taste is of yeast, spice, and hops up front with the wheat/grain flavors coming through in the finish. The hop flavors are quite citrus-like and do not really contribute too much bitterness to take away from the overall beer. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a really good beer and I quite enjoy the hopped up take on a hefeweizen."

"This beer poured a bright gold color with some haziness in the clarity. The head was a strong white foam which lead to some nice lacing as the glass was enjoyed. Once poured this beer showed hints of citrus, spiciness and banana with a light floral note from the hops. The flavor exploded upon first sip, definitely enjoyable orange, clove and fainter banana finishing with a pleasant spiciness."
""
"Overall: Nice hefe, although nowhere near a classic example. A bit heavy on the hops, but the flavor is pleasant."
""
""
"Earthy, very earthy taste. Smooth wheat beer flavor. Average carbonation. Malty more than hoppy, contrary to the smell. A tiny touch of soapiness in the flavor as well. Starts strong with that great smell, but overall, I wasn't blown away by the finish."
""
""
""
"This beer literally explodes the palette with cloves, hops, banana, citrus, and spice. It pours very cloudy indeed, as would be expected form a bottle fermented hefe. I'd say their experiment worked. I would definitely buy this beer again."
""
"Wheatbock with delicious bitterness as leverage against its fruity sweet portion, good quaff ability, alcohol is deceivingly hidden."
"O: I've had this before, and always thought it was pretty good. The clove flavors tend towards the overwhelming the other flavors of the beer - I would prefer if that aspect were toned down a bit. I think it could allow the wheat and hops to play more nicely together. As it is, it's enjoyable but I don't think I could drink a lot at once."
"O: A very tasty and well balanced beer that is pretty easy to drink. Not sure I would describe this one as sessionable as the ABV is just a little too high. I prefer this version to the one under the Brooklyn label but both are quite good. I have had this beer a few times and would not hesitate to grab it again."
""
"Found this a borderline Frankenstein beer. Chock full of interesting characteristics, but combined in a way that seems overblown and random."
"O - Great depth and complexity. Lots to explore here."
"Weizen beers are usually not something I like to have often, or are necessarily even a favorite style, but I have to admit this is a real interesting beer here."
"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, bottled 9/27/2011. Pours super hazy dark red orange color with a nice 2-3 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass; with plenty of carbonation streaming up as expected. Aromas of big sweet lemon zest, orange peel, bubblegum, biscuit, tropical fruits, wheat, banana, coriander, herbal, light pepper, and light caramel. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon zest, orange peel, bubblegum, wheat, biscuit, caramel, banana, clove, light pepper, herbal, and tropical fruit. Lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, pepper, biscuit, herbal, bubblegum, and tangy wheat on the finish for a good bit. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Slightly cloying sweetness on the finish, but not too bad. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish; and this is very smooth to drink. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable weizenbock. It is definitely the fruitiest wheat beer I have come across; but has a fair amount of spiciness to balance it out in the taste."
"O: A different and successful combination to make a hoppy weizen-bock -- highly recommend you try this one."
""
""
"OVERALL: Probably not for everyone but I love it to bits."
"O: Interesting flavor profile. A little too syrupy-sweet for my liking."
""
""
""
"Body is medium to medium-heavy with carbonation strong enough to be felt alongside this, but not overpower it. The resultant mouthfeel is creamy with some heft, quite nice. Finish is dry, a bit sticky from malt."
""
""
"O/D-A very enjoyable, complex, and unique brew. $5 for a 500 ml is acceptable as well. Overall, a drink worth trying. I can see myself buying a bottle of this again without question."
""
"This is really something interesting, I would call it a combination of an double/imperial IPA with a hefeweizen."

"I kind of wish I found the Brooklyn version. Anyways poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass, coded freshness date. This pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with a massive slightly off white head. The smells are of belgian yeast esters, nice and fruity, some banana, clove, wheat, perhaps some bubblegum. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good a little hop bite, some nice fruity sweetness, spices a little alcohol burn. Overall pretty tasty."
"o: not really sure whether I would come back to this. the aroma and flavors were unique and something I had never had in a weizenbock, but by the end, those off-flavors were definitely cloying."
"Overall: A very solid Weizonbock. The strong hops blend very well with the wheat. A good collaboration."
""
""
""
""
"Not sure what style this truly should be considered, but it is an interesting experiment."
"Pours a hazy deep golden color with a bit of a copper tint to it. The head is initially large and foamy, but falls down fairly quickly. Good lacing and a collar throughout. The nose has some really spicy German hops. Not nearly as enticing as the Brooklyn version. The flavor has some more hop spice and faint floral characteristics. Moderate malt and a touch of sweetness. A bit too boozy as well. Overall, not a huge fan of this one."
""
""
""
"M/O: A melange of weird flavors in this one. There's better weizenbocks on the shelf that a are couple dollars less too."
""
""
""
""
"O: I didn't end up liking this one as much as I thought I would, but I'll give it another chance if I have the opportunity. There's lots of good to be had here, and I could easily see someone enjoying this more than I did regardless of whether or not they like the medicinal notes."
""
"O: Not bad, I don't think Schneider can make a bad weiss beer. Really interested in trying the Brooklyn take on this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer. Not a must have, but certainly a must try."
""
""
"O: Refreshing. The collaboration between Schneider and Brooklyn has created something special."
""
""
"This beer is more than the sum of its parts. All of the characteristics I detected meld in a masterful way that I would wxpect from two heavyweights collaborating. This is an outstanding beer!"
""
"Pick it up, high on my list, even though it isn't my favorite style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is light inspite of the assertive sweetness, so it scores high on drinkability. I would recommend this as a great accompaniment to roasted dark meats or curried dishes. This is another class act from G Schneider & Sohns."

"Schneider-Weiss, like Weihenstephaner or Ayinger, continues to prove the Germans know how to brew a tasty, complex, nuanced and balanced brew. While we Americans always think of big steins of lagered beer when we think of German beer, the truth is they make some of the most sublime, tasty, and unearthly ales on the planet. This beer is no exception, and is a must-try in my opinion if you're in the mood for a delicious, different and altogether classy beer. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer by any stretch, but it wasn't great either. The taste wore on me a bit by the time I hit the bottom of the bottle. Would have really liked to try this fresh before the aged version, but I assume it wasn't far off from the Brooklyner-Schneider version. Tasty, glad I got to try it, but most likely won't reach for it again."
""
"Pours hazy golden with a large rocky head. Leaving great lacing, the head slowly recedes into a well-defined bullseye of bubbles on the surface. The aroma is complex; ranges from floral and perfumy to woody and herbal with a hint of spice. Notes of lemon and basil in the nose. The fruity characteristics follow through to the taste with berry and tea-like notes up front. It finishes mildly bitter and hoppy. 8.2% ABV not detectable. Medium-bodied with prickly, soft carbonation and a crisp bite in the finish. Coats the tongue but doesn't linger very long. Very drinkable."
"Pours a light gold color w/ a one finger off white head. The head quickly goes down to a sliver. Nice lacing left on the side of my snifter. This is lighter in appearance than expected. Nose is banana, hops, clove, and other spices. The hops really stand out, as does the banana. There's also a mild sour smell in there somewhere too, which I don't really appreciate. Taste is almost medicine-like in flavor and feel. There's also a bitter/sour aftertaste that sticks to the back of your throat for what seems to be an eternity. I'm now getting a lemon house cleaner taste from this.. Not sure what they're going for here. Feel is bitter/sour and highly carbonated. Overall, I feel like I'm drinking a bottle of pledge. The lemon cleaner taste is just too over the top. This isn't a bad beer, but you can find much better Weizenbock brews out there. Cheers."
"O- Great beer very complex and enjoyable on a lot of different levels. The 8.2% ABV is well hidden, if only the appearance wasn’t so scary."
"Other than that, one hell of a brew. Exactly what I would expect from a German/American collaboration."
"This beer pours a hazy, bold gold with thick head and lasting lace. The aroma is citrus and banana with a bit of hay. It's flavor is typical hefeweizen, banana, lemon,and some vanilla. It has a strong alcohol background that becomes more prevalent then overwhelming as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium, very filling. Schneider - Brooklyner Hopfen - Weisse is a decent beer, could rate better with less alcohol burn. Slightly recommended."
"O - Overall, I'm genuinely impressed with this beer. It's big, it's massive, it's robust, yet it is very drinkable!"
"Don't get me wrong - this is a fairly tasty concoction, but it seemed well off of what a weizenbock should be. Given that this is from Schneider - the king of wheat beers - I will certainly try it again, just to make sure I'm not having a bad batch."
"O: I love it! I think I have a new favorite Hefe! Much more character and ""much-ness"" than any other hefe I've had."
"Pours a hazy orange with a super thick head that dissipates rather quickly leaving little lacing. Smells very happy. Its highly carbonated with a medium body. At first you get an intense hop flavor followed by some wheatiness ending with a spicy finish. Bitterness is surprisingly low as I guess the wheat after taste cancels out the hops. A truly unique brew though, I really enjoyed it. Not too many happy wheat beers out there so I respect this."
"Overall: A nice variation on the standard hefeweizen, if you’re in the mood for a beer that looks and feels like a wheat beer but adds some strong IPA characteristics."
"O: a bit disappointed in this one. After having a good experience with the Schneider Weissbier I was excited to try this one but it ended up being a very bitter beer that imo hid some of the taste qualities that I could tell were present from the smell."
"O: Good, very special flavor for a German beer. Only the chemical edge gives it it's weak point."
"Fuller medium body, somewhat lower carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. A pretty tasty brew, although a bit sweet for me and the alcohol was at a noticeable level."
"O: drinkable and delicious, this is a good one. I wonder what it's like on tap...."
"Overall: Not as good as I had hoped. The other Schneider beers I have tried were exceptional but this one I did not like very much. The unique flavor of the beer was not to my liking particularly the odd sweetness it has followed by the slight bitterness. Not sure I would try again."
"Thanks Sammy!!"
"Pours a cloudy deep gold. Aroma of wheat malt, subtle sweetness, and Bavarian style yeast. In the flavor, grainy, clove, bubblegum like wheat presence, and a mild earthy bitterness to round it out. Medium bodied, with chalky yeast lingering on the palate. 8.2 percent abv is fairly well hidden under a strong wheat malt base. Overall, another nice wheat beer from Schneider & Son."
"O- Drinkabilty is very good and the 8.2% ABV is perfectly hidden, but the beer does not seem to be able to stand on his own. You could either say this is a weizen that tastes like an IPA or an IPA that feels like a weizen: it just feels like you're tasting two different beers at the same time. That was a bold attempt, but not a successful one, at least on Schneider's side"
"Overall: A superb ale that could use some work on the appearance side of things. Nice & complex without overwhelming you. Seek this out for sure."
"An excellent beer. Much better than the Brooklyn version. Awesome. A great reason to break out the weizen glass. I don't know what else to say, but I wish that there were more beers like this out there."
"at their hostel in Berlin"
"O - Quite surprising Weizenbock after having had a couple of more traditional ones. Pretty good example. Good higher ABV summer beer."
"Pours an exceptional rich, golden orange color with a big, dense, cloud-like, cream-colored head. The aroma is quite fragrant, with a combination of lemony and herbal hops, a bit of yeasty funk, and some sour apple. The flavor is likewise a complex combination of earthy and floral hops, yeast, a wheaty tanginess, and a light, dry fruitiness. The fine, light carbonation keeps this potent combination of flavors from being too overwhelming. In the end, however, although I recognize the depth and complexity of the slightly tart, earthy, tangy assortment of smells and flavors, the combination with this flavor profile just becomes too challenging for me to enjoy fully."
"Overall - Very good beer for the style. I would buy again. Great collaboration of two great brewers."
"Drinkability: Hoppy weissbier seems blasphemous to me, but I have to admit it is tasty stuff."
"Crisp, clean mouthfeel, this is a refreshing, well-balanced, extremely drinkable beer. 8.2% ABV is exquisitely concealed. More please!"
"O: A really nice brew. Came upon this totally at random…just saw the neat bottle with “Hopfen Weisse” emblazoned across the front and figured what the hey. I was in a hoppy mood. It’s great to see this merging of old and new world. Recommended for sure."
"Overall - this is a very nice Weizenbock - bot a good representative of the style and just a good brew in general. Helps me remember Germany."
"This beer pours out as a hazy looking golden yellow color with a strong fluffy white colored head. The lacing on the glass is pretty good. The smell of the beer is indeed hoppy, there is also a nice fresh wheat aromas too. The taste of the beer has a nice sweet taste upfront with the grainy wheat and some banana that quickly turns into a bitter hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and pretty refreshing. Overall this beer is pretty good, I enjoyed the two varieties coming together."
"Poured very cloudy golden orange. Smell is floral hop, banana and clove. Taste is spicy pepper w/ strong clove and yeast. Sweeter than I prefer for hot weather. Finishes semi-sweet. Alcohol not masked in this one. Mouthfeel is creamy/chewy. BA Weizenbock lovers will probably like this 'cause its bold and complex. I personally like milder hefe-weizens. Though its tasty I probably wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting."
"Feel is a tad less creamy than I expected, but still good; alcohol heat detracts a bit here. This is a very unique beer, and fun to drink."
"A really interesting and unique beer. It's strange how the hop flavors mix with an almost lemony zest flavor. Quite tasty."
"Overall, this is highly unusual, heavily hopped wheat beer in a category of its own, with juicy, citrusy character reminiscent of some sort of malt-based lemon drink. (500 ml with freshness date 27. August 2011, into tulip.)"
"O: It is a quite interesting beer for sure, there isn't much like it in the beer world to my knowledge. Sadly, the flavors don't blend as well as expected because of the (IMO) use of the hpos, not enough aromatic."
"Quite lively mouthfeel. Heavy side of the light spectrum. Really no alcohol. I think I liked the Brooklyn version slightly better, but this is good as well."
"If the ""American ingenuity"" (as the label states) was merely to toy with a classic recipe by ""robustly dry-hopping"" an otherwise perfect beer, then it appears to me at least that the Americans should not be invited to collaborate on such an iconic beer at such a time-stable house."
"Finish: Long and extravagant! Complex and beautiful. This beer delivers with artistry and great craftsmanship. Everything is savored, from the fruit(melon,peach,sweet apple, and oranges) to the nice dry hopped body."
"O-flavorful strong and hoppy"
"drinkability: amzing beer, IPA, whatever you want to call it."
"I'm kind of embarrassed it took me so long to get this one down my gullet, but now I have a new favorite, to add to my many other favorites."
"This beer is quite dry, medium bodied, and very drinkable. Overall I'll definitely be buying this again. I wasn't expecting something so darn good when I bought it."
"O- Well I know I don't want to buy this again. I probably will though because it's an okay beer and I think it's worth trying again. Type of flavours I like :strong yeast and hop profile but the boiled veggie I just can't stand."
"O- Pretty good over all beer. I’ll be tasting a few more of these tonight."
"Flavour is tart lemon zest and apple, smooth banana, and mild spice."
"This beer pours with a small amount of head, but what it lacks in head it makes up in appearance. It has a nice murky yellow amber look to it. The smell is very sweet and light. The taste is very smooth with a lot of orange, wheat, and fruit. It finishes like you just bit into an apple. A great summer beer. Cheers."
"Absolutely stunning."
"This beer enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, OK. Pours a very hazy orange color with a lot of suspended hop and yeast debris. There is little to no head with this beer with is the only detractor. The aroma has obvious notes of orange and honey, along some caramel and slight hoppiness. The taste is very sweet starting with honey flavors and then some slight citrusy hops. The mouthfeel has just the right amount of carbed feel and finishes well. Overall a great beer."
"Pours a hazy golden-caramel with a very small and very quickly disappearing white head, and smells of caramel soaked red apples, baked pears, bananas foster and oranges. There is a nice hop presence but, being more of a milder and less pungent hop, it adds more of a nice flowery bouquet. Palate is big, silky and creamy, with a biscuity core surrounded by rich citrus, vanilla and caramel flavors. Once again, hoppy but not overly bitter or pungent. The midpalate has a bit of peppery alcohol which lead back to a slightly tart, biscuity citrus blossom finish. Overall, very nice with good balance and a rich caramelly edge to the fruity aromas."
"overall, this beer is super unique, drinkable and delicious - other than the carbonation this is a 'A' beer, would definitely get this again even if the pricepoint is a bit high ($5.50 at a cheap beer store)."
"Cloudy orange with huge chunks of lees floating around. Thick and creamy white head. Looks awesome except for the gigantic yeast chunks. I poured carefully but had to leave a good two inches of beer in the bottle to avoid pouring out even more yeast. Aroma of sweet malts and grains with a floral hop character - quite planty. The flavor is very sweet - some bready malts and caramel but lots of sweet cherry to the point of being slightly cloying. Some floral hop character. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but again I thought it was way too sweet. It does cover up the high ABV though. Overall I expect much better from a collaboration of these two great breweries - I was quite disappointed."
"O - Very drinkable, almost a little too smooth for the 8.2% ABV ;) Probably not recommended to drink too many of them in a row, but definitely a nice beer to sit and enjoy."
"Weiss beer isn't normally my first choice however I really like what this brings to the Weiss style. The 'extra hoppiness' of this one really works for me and balances the sweetness. A great beer to savour by itself."
"Overall, a good try at doing something different. Not too bad."
"If you're lucky enough to find it, buy it."
"Overall - This is one of the better twists on IPA-meets a totally different beer style that I've come across. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, this one makes an excellent choice. Recommended!"
"If you're a fan of hybrid beers, complex-tasting beers, hefeweizens and/or pale ales, this is definitely a beer to try. I don't think it's a great beer, but it's certainly extraordinary and something you should certainly pick up if you see it. Good stuff!"
"This beer reminds my of an Imperial IPA, maybe because the characterstics are similar (ABV, IBU etc). Yet it has features that set it apart. Nice beer overall."
"Bottle poured into a tapered Hefeweizen glass. Deep amber color and highly carbonated. The carbonation under the yeast caused an explosive effect that looked like a volcano erupting. The head was thick and the disipated quickly. The taste was off. Maybe the beer was not been handled properly but the notes of banana and fruit were there but sour. If this beer is anything like it's american counterpart than this beer I'd definately off. It tasted like overly ripe oranges. I will be sure to have this fresh to make sure I'm not crazy."
"This brew pours a non see through mandarin,honey hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head that recedes to a rim of lacing and no other lacing to be seen,the smell is very nice with aromas of honey soaked toffee,marmalade,bananna,cloves and candy,it has a nice medium bodied silky mouthfeel which is lightly carbonated and has tastes of candied oranges firstly followed by sweet mandarins,candied wheat and finishes with a sherbet,grapefruit sour bitterness and overall its very nice and i will easily finish this but i couldnt drink it all night but in saying that i will revisit cheers."
"All together was this beer my favorite new finds this summer. When I saw it today I picked up another one to see how it would hold up on a dreary Februari night. This beer is good on all occasions. The ABV is a little higher then most Weissbeers but you'll never notice it while drinking it. Most recomended."
"An interesting concept: a strongly hopped Weizenbock. However, in practice I am not a big fan. The hoppy/bitter/spicy flavors don't work so great with the more subtle weizen flavors. It ends up tasting a bit more like a muddied IPA. The large amount of sediment is somewhat unappetizing too."
"Overall an interesting beer and a unique take on the style. I kind of question how fresh my bottle was because of the large amount of sediment and the lingering sweetness left on my lips,similar to that of an older ipa or other hoppy beer. This beer is an unusual mix of the sweetness of a weiss and the hoppiness of a more bitter beer. It works for the most part but I am starting to tire of it near the end of the beer."
"D - Pretty sweet, splitting this pint in to two servings is a good idea. But it wouldn't be a problem to put back the whole thing in one sitting. I enjoyed this enough to put it on my regular favorites list. I'd like to get this once a month or so."
"All-around good weizenbock."
"D - Pretty drinkable despite the high ABV. Still, I wouldn't have more then one, I think it'll sneak up on you."
"Notes: The hop balance gives this beer a nice complexity and interesting flavor. This is one to seek out, especially if you liked the Brooklyn version."
"Fantastic, highly refreshing beer. Would happily purchase again."
"D -- A highly enjoyable beer for whiling away a lazy afternoon. Not so strong flavored as to kick you in the head, but definitely one to respect at 8%. I'd love to try a toned down version of this recipe. I imagine the hop bill would be very refreshing in a normal strength Weizen."
"D - very drinkable beer, however because of the high alcohol volume, can be treasonable."
"A second tasting with a bottle known to be only a couple months of age confirms that this isn't really a preferred weizenbock."
"Very interesting like an imperial ipa mixed with a wheat beer. The only drawback to my mind is that is gets slightly too sweet and filling halfway through to make it highly drinkable."
"This is an interesting weizenbock, but I'd rather have the original Shneider version. I'm not sure what the age on this beer is, but I feel it's beyond the point where the interesting hop flavors would come through."
"D: For the ABV, the drinkability is pretty good but the sweetness is a limiter."
" Still quite interesting and well made but certainly not exciting."
"Drink - An interesting beer with a different taste. I feel like I should be a big fan of this beer.. but I'm on the fence with it. Perhaps I will give it another try some day down the road."
"I wish I could get this where I live it's a very interesting brew with unique qualities, thanks liamt07 for sending it my way"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass with time to breathe for a few minutes... Pours a beautiful cloudy golden color. Smell is a definite light hops and pineapple mix. What a great blend of hops and weizenbock. I absolutely love the taste, even with the higher alcohol content, which is well hidden in the bold flavors that come forward. All I can say is, ""WOW""... It is one that all German Weizenbock fans have to try. I will buy again and again...I am a true Fan!!!"
"Very nice beer."
"I can't imagine why nobody else has thought of an extra hoppy weizenbock, but this beer is so far out-of-the-box that it reeks of geniality."
"More like an American craft brew than a German beer due to the hops but besides that has all the best of German beer. I perfect compromise between the two lands and a must try for any beer lover."
"Overall a very good beer. To sum it up: Fruity, Creamy, Tasty, Hoppy and so very good. Cheers!"
"Notes: Very good beer that is really warming but refreshing too."
"500 mL bottle. Pours a murky light orange with a an inch of frothy head. Smell is tangy and sour with maybe a hint of hops. Some banana and cloves. Taste is bready and kind of hoppy. Not as tangy as it smells but still has a bit of a twang to it. Cloves and spice towards the finish with more bready notes. Boozey but pretty easy to drink and tasty. Heavy mouthfeel with alot of carbonation. Good collaboration."
"D: A very interesting collaboration here. Hops are prevalent for the style, and the yeast is also doing some interesting things. A tart, cloudy, hoppy weizenbock that may not be for the faint of heart, but I enjoyed this one and suspect that many will as well."
"Drinkability is just so so. Take two great beers and mix them together, sometimes it doesn't work so well. Worth a try I guess but in my case this is a not so great beer."
"Would definitely drink this again."
"Drinkability: Nursed this one for a while."
"D- Very drinkable, impressed that the 8.2% is hidden so well in this beer, flavorful, deep complex body, fantastic beer!"
"Drinkability: I am rather enjoying this beer. I would definitely not mind having this again, and I look forward to being able to try the Brooklyner version of this beer."
"A very well-done, exciting beer. Even at 8.2%, nice to drink. I'd love to try the its counterpart."
"I was pleasantly surprised. If I ever see this again, I will buy many many more bottles."
"D- At 8.2% I think this is a good once in a while beer, but man o man I wish I could have more of these in a sitting!!"
"Yeah, mostly fresh, smooth flavours. The beer is a little off-kilter, but definitely enjoyable and quite refreshing."
"D - Pretty drinkable, alcohol might stop you from having too many though."
"D: for 8.2% this is very drinkable. the flavor intrigues me enough to look for more beers like it."
"Very smooth, but that 8.2% does eventually hit you. I'm glad I have a few of these tucked away for later."
"A wonderful beer quite complex with everything that is going on!"
"At first when I opened it and smelled it, I detected the same aroma as Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse Natürtrub, and thought to myself, Oh no, this again, but I found this to be far less dominated by cloves, and I found that it maintained the traditional taste of beer a bit more too. All in all, I'm far more pleased with it than I expected to be from the scent. Could see myself buying it again."
"great easy mouth feel and drinkability, I could definitely knock a few of these back on a hot summer's day. Overall i really enjoyed this beer fresh and would love to try the Brooklyn version."
"Fairly drinkable, although you can tell it's a 8.2% beer. Gets a little heavy and the bitterness is unusual for the style. I enjoyed the change but won't seek it out again."
"D - This one was surprisingly delicious and the high ABV was incredibly hidden. This beer is fantastic, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Weiss with a hoppy twist. They've nailed it!"
"It finishes clean and crisp with the sweet hints of weissbier, and the fresh notes of hops. I am truly amazed by this beer and am thankful that I can go buy it now in Ontario. The Original Scheider Weisse was already such a great pairing with foods like seafood, breakfasts, light pasta, cheeses and more. But now with greater strength and added hop character you can add Mexican, Thai, and Indian food to your plate. Can't wait!"
"Delicious, refreshing, crisp, and outstanding. I can't wait to drink the Brooklyn half of this collaboration."
"There is a fairly pronounced alcohol taste as well as a sharply spicy flavor--peppery, even. Medium bodied with sparse carbonation. Drinkability is ok."
"Love the Germans & their beer!"
"Drinkability is good - it went perfectly with my leftover fried chicken. Yum!"
"Drinkability: A very nice beer- this succeeds in having both wonderful ""regular"" wheat beer characteristics and a strong hop presence. Very good and highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is an Awesome Beer. I Would Love to Try This w/ a Big Buhind Steak and Steamed Shrimps... Bless God!!! Awww ! Git in me Belly !"
"D: Here I am, middle of winter, sipping on this in front of a fire with me wife. It's warming alcohol & the full-on complexity is amazing. GIVE THIS A GO! A bewdiful ambience tipple"
"Pours a cloudy prange with a big frothy head. Nose is juicy orange, grapefruit and lemon, hints of yeast and some funk. Flavour is lots of fresh juicy citrus with a solidly bitter backing. Very grapefruity, and a very nice sweetness balance. Mouthfeel is smooth but quite hefty with a moderate carbonation. Almost chewy. I wouldn't call this a sipper, but obviously not sessionable either. I imagine this to be a solid dinner beer with red meat or heavy sauces."
"500ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours a dense and murky burnt amber orange with golden hues and one finger of bubbly white froth. Smell is aromatic hops, fresh cut grass, perfume, unripe banana, clove, bubblegum, pear and apricot, light phenols, baking sugar, ethanol, and powdery, doughy aromas. So complex it's breathtaking! Taste is sweet wheat malt, strong spiciness, more banana and clove, warming alcoholic edge, mildly bitter and earthy hop finish. Mouthfeel is silky-medium, lush and smooth, parched aftertaste with hints of wheat husk and citrus. Good God, this is some crazy shit! A quintessentially German/U.S. collaboration, as it combines the very best features of your favourite weizen with a bold, well-hopped, American ale. Drinkability is high but you need to respect the 8.2% ABV. An enthralling, satisfying, and nuanced beer. Just try it."
"tastes quite a bit like it smells, but with some alcohol. pear flavors are more pronounced, some wheat, and some herbal sensations. i really wanted to be excited about this one, a hoppy hefeweissen sounded like a lot of fun. oh well."
"pour is a bit lighter than their hef... yellowish with a long of murky and bits floating around. would like to see the wheat malt more integrated. zesty... smal head... but not dead. nose is hoppy banana apple. palate is rather sharp on the tongue. fruit... lavender... floral astringent and a bit grainy on the tongue. a hoppy verison of a weisbock is what it is. those that love the imperial hef from new glarus will dig on this. warm candy... but sharp finish of a mild bitter. well quite for a weizenbock."
"D - Quite drinkable. That slight alcohol flavour holds it back a bit but it's quite refreshing."
"D: Another delicious weizenbock. Easy to drink and plenty of good flavors and aromas."
"The body is medium and the carbonation lively. An interesting and enjoyable journey."
"I was hoping that the premise of this beer would lead to something similar to the premise of a Belgian IPA; using the more ""sophisticated"" yeast strains (yeah, I said it) of some traditional ales and combining it with a more modern hop presence. Maybe the Brooklyn version of this one achieves this balance, but I'm not finding it here."
"D: Thanks liam, this is amazing It would get an A+ if there were more bitter/hoppiness. This goes down easy and I could drink this time after time."
"D: Took a little longer to get through then I would have though, but still very enjoyable."
"Definitely a flavorful and interesting beer, but too strong in taste and alcohol to be super drinkable. A good choice as a one-off, though."
"An interesting beer. I enjoy it, but it won't be to everyone's taste."
"Light to medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation; tongue coating. While not detracting from the refreshing quality the beer could have used crisper hop flavor and some more effervescence to aid in drinkability and zestiness (new word) of flavor; gratifying nonetheless."
"This beer pours a very nice hazy yellow orange color with very little head and minimal lacing. the head trickles rather quickly, but carbonation is evident. The aroma on this is amazing. you get that european floral component but then a bitter twang from some nice floral hops coated with caramalized bananas take over. Very nice balance between the aromas. Almost smells like bananas foster. The taste is very nice too. not typical wheat dominance as other weizenbocks have had on this one. There is a nice hop bite, a little off balanced but full weizenbock characteristics come through with the banana, caramel, clove and a touch of alcohol. Nicely carbonated and full bodied on this weizenbock. Drinkability is high as its great in the summer as its refreshing but also has the depth to go the distance with medium faired cuisine. Very nice effort on this sucker. cant wait to try the other version in the champagne bottle."
"Like a thick and groomed moustache, this beer is glorius. I'd place this on my top 10 for sure. Rich, flavourful, balanced, smooth, and most of all unique! It goes down almost too easily. One of the best, if not the best seasonal releases you can pick up at the LCBO right now. But no matter where you live, be sure to pick one of these up."
"Combined with a slick, smooth mouthfeel with med-low carbonation (a little flat towards the end), this beer goes down exceptionally well. It's a very dangerous 8.2% ABV since it's also very refreshing and great for a hot summer night like tonight."
"My first go around I was shocked by the immense drinkability and smoothness of this beer. Second, third and fourth occasions have seen the alcohol poke out a bit more and remind me there's still a bit of brute here... perhaps a bit more than the Brooklyner version if memory serves correctly. Still love the vibrant citrus hopping ontop of the hefe - not really a Belgian IPA guy because they never seem integrated but this (while not a Belgian IPA) is my kind of thing."
"Drinkability: This is an unusual weizenbock but one that I enjoyed. It is a nicely drinkable beer with the bitter hoppiness playing a major role. One sip leads naturally to the next and I could easily have another."
"With an abv at close to 8% I wouldn't call this a highly drinkable beer. A good hefeweizen of dunkelweizen is only about 4.5%abv which means drinking 2 liters in an evening is hardly a blip on the radar. I could probably have 2 of these in a night, but never more. In fact the one 12oz pour that I had tonight was enough for me to decided that I should head home from the bar early and stick with some low abv beers for the rest of the night."
"Reviewed from my notes. It was served in my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res' Schneider event. The beer is generally golden orange in color, but it turns to yellow at the edges of the glass. The head is pure white foam, but it is rather small. The liquid is fully opaque. The aroma is a good combination of sweet wheat and lemon citrus hops. The flavor is superb--the hoppy finish real caught me by surprise, even though I knew it was coming. There is a lot of wheat up front, but as soon as you swallow you get a mouthful of bitterness. It is very well-balanced and extremely tasty. It has a light body and medium carbonation. There is a slight coat, but it disappears quickly. Overall, it is very drinkable. It is a bit too strong to be sessionable, but it is certainly worth the effort to seek out and enjoy over a round or two."
"Overall this is a delicious, unique brew, and a style that I would like to see more of. Will definately be seeking this beer out again, mostly for the aroma!"
"D - An excellent example of the style. Can barely tell that this packs an 8.2% ABV punch."
"Taste is very light and crisp, it's sweet and smooth with a lot of those fruity notes as well. It's really easy drinking and very smooth. Totally worth checking out, very tasty."
"Overall pretty good, but too milky and too sweet, and too simple... like an orange-pineapple citrus bomb. I want to like this more but there are too many things wrong with it."
"Bottle pours a lovely cloudy orange with a decent amount of foam in the duvel tulip glass. Also have drank several of these out of a Erdinger weizen glass. Tastes of nice mild hop bitterness with a little sweet dark fruit lingering around. Goes down quite smooth and is very drinkable for 8.2% alc. Glad I have a few more bottles of this one. Very solid beer overall. I can't stop coming back to this one."
"Notes: take a lighter APA and mix it with a Hefe and this is what you get. Good stuff."
"Conclusion: Very interesting, and I will buy more. Its like having two beers at once! A nice diversion from the norm."
"Moderate carbonation, creamy and slightly thicker than I expected. Feels somewhat chewy, perhaps just because of the lighter mouthfeel of the style. This, along with the high ABV hurts its drinkability for me, but this hasn't kept me from picking up a dozen of these for throughout the warmer months ahead. Not exactly a session beer, but an excellent choice when looking for a single pint during the summer."
"The beer initially pours a translucent burnt orange color in my Duvel tulip, though the second pour with the yeast added in significantly muddies it. The initial 3 finger, slightly rocky, white head is impressive, but head retention is poor and lacing is virtually nonexistent. In terms of traditional characteristics, the nose is all clove with no appreciable banana, but there's also a nice juicy citrus hop presence. The aroma is overall a bit muted though. The taste leads off with a blend of clove and banana that, as the nose would suggest, favors clove heavily. Up next is a brief flash of bitterness, before the beer finishes with the citrus hop notes hinted at in the nose, along with a little bit of alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is suitably light and smooth, but the beer definitely seems a little bit undercarbonated. It's tasty enough to be somewhat drinkable, but the aforementioned alcohol and carbonation issues hold it back a little bit."
"Summer seasonal offering from the LCBO, poured from a 500ml glass into some weiss glassware. Gorgeous golden brown, with a thick off-white head, leaving some serious chunky lacing down the side of the glass. Smells is really hoppy and fruity, some pineapple, banana, cloves and passionfruit and just a real genuine sweetness to it. Taste is quite similar too, not at all bitter but again quite sweet and fruity. Has the mouthfeel of a weiss, very smooth and fullbodied, and a definite easy drinker. The alcohol is very well masked, and I could easily pump a few of these back. Just a great offering from Oliver and Drexler in this collab-brew, and I'm gonna a hoard quite a few of these for this summer."
"D: The benchmark for Imperial Weizens?"
"Frikkin' awesome wheat!"
"Taste was very hop forward, bitterness dominates, passion fruit, strong yeast backdrop, some sourness detracts. Fruit on opening diminished with air and warming. The finish is pretty intense with more yeast and sour fruit. Medium body, cleansing hoppiness, there was a pine resin quality that made it just a bit rough around the edges, that was my impression. With a few subtle changes, I'd score this a half point higher in all categories. Still, a really decent beer and I'll pick up more if there are any left and thanks again to the breweries for providing a real break from the norm."
"Pours a hazy, deep orange colour with huge white head. Lots of lacing too. Lots of banana, orange and lemon in the smell, to go with hop flavour. A nice amount of bitterness. Certainly not an IPA or anything for hop profile, but the hops are a big component of the taste. This blends really well with the taste of a hefe. I get clove, banana, lemon and orange in the flavour. Alcohol is really well hidden. Really nice beer and I'm glad the Control Borad in Ontario got this as part of the summer release. I'm going to buy loads of this."
"This stuff easily joins the ranks of the best summer go-to beers available in Ontario. Thank you LCBO for mustering up an ounce of sanity! Hopefully this sells well and they bring it back. The only thing keeping the drinkability down here is the relatively-high ABV. At 8.2% though, if you were to bring three of these out with you to sip on for an evening, I think that would be just great. You don't need to carry too many around with you."
"D: Supposedly this beer is 8.2%, but you'd never know it. Very refreshing, easy drinking beer made by two great breweries. And it's a hard price to beat at only $4 a bottle"
"D - The idea of adding hops to a hefe was a great idea...I love Aventius and this to me was a lighter verison hopped up...this is a beer that could be enjoyed all year round"
"Cheers!"
"Great traditional Hefebock."
"Schneider's Edelweisse really turned me onto the style and this may be my beer of the season!!!"
"Note to self: Buy This, Savor This, Repeat Daily."
"This is a most delicious beer. It is perfect for a refreshing summer brew that still packs a punch."
"D: A good complex beer. With all the strange micro-brew combos out there. I don't think this combination brew is off putting at all. Try her on she'll fit nicely."
"Hazy gold-orange. 3/4 inch head retains well and leaves light lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma is thick with hops - spicy, herbal smelling hops - very nice. Some fruit flavors (pineapple comes to mind?)followed by grainy malt and a long - lingering hop finish. Full bodied mouthfeel - enough carbonation for the style. Very good drinkability especially at 8.2% - I am very happy to have found this beer. Very unique."
"D - If there is such a thing as an imperial wit beer thyen this would be it. It has to be one of my favourite 10 beers and ther have been over 600."
"Glad I gave this a try, really enjoyable."
"This is a very interesting Hefe. This beer has a lot of fruit, apricot, apple and pear. Very spicy and very good. Drank it with food but would say that this beer needs to be enjoyed alone. Too many different layers to enjoy with food. Very odd for a hefe and would love to get a little more of the story behind the brew. Enjoy!"
"This is a really, really excellent brew. Somewhat intriguing and unusual, but so balanced, coherent and drinkable that you wonder why the style should be unusual at all. Still, collaboration or no, Schneider are one of the breweries I would trust to pull something like this off so expertly, and that is exactly what they do. A truly wonderful drop of beer."
"D: A nice unique beer. It has a nice drinkable quality even though it is on the high side for alcohol."
"An interesting beer, and well worth trying, but one is enough. Would like to try the version of this from Brooklyn Brewing..."
"Yeah. This is a damn good beer, one of the best to come to the LCBO in a long time, and a bargain at $3.25 a bottle. Can't wait to try the Brooklyn version."
"Carbonation is too high."
"Notes - This is absolutely delicious, and I'll be buying again as soon as I can. I'd love to try the one brewed by Brooklyn as well."
"D: The beer seems to be a bit more drinkable than its hoppier Brooklyn cousin, but the alcohol will definitely catch up to you if you try to drink it too quick."
"All around this has been one of my favorites since it came out, both versions are spot on. I'm glad to see its stayed in rotation the past few years, and hope it remains. A go to summer beer."
"Really loved this beer - I realised I am giving this an outrageously high rating but I thought it was just awesome!"
"D - a wonderful beer, love the unexpected fruity notes and lively pepper and alcohol bite. very refreshing on a warm summer evening."
"Glad I got a chance to try this."
"D-great beer, refreshing even for a bigger beer and can easily be enjoyed all night"
"This is refreshing upfront and wetting to the palate, but the ABV in the end is slightly detectable. This is the best beer I've had in a long time."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this brew. I would gladly have it again."
"A really interesting beer - poured a dark cola brown. I decanted the yeast sediment, and was a little concerned that at the end it looked a tad grungy, but all turned out well. Up front the customary clove yeast flavors and some breadyness, but the floral hopping that followed was a bit of a twist. At times the overall effect called to mind a hoppy Belgian pale ale."
"Drinkability: A superior brew. The unique pairing of dry hops with a wheat beer makes this something I'd highly recommend to anyone. This is tasty!"
"All in all this is a somewhat different spin on the hefeweizen style and it's worth a try if you come across it."
"The only sour point is that the sweetness on the finish becomes rather chewy after about 4 or 5. But I could hardly complain about that because after 3 or 4 I am already well on my way to bliss! :)"
"Drinkability: Very strong flavor and hoppiness makes it harder to put back"
"D - I'm really enjoying this beer a hopped up wheat is bad ass the flavor is very good if you like wheat beers and hops this is a must try"
"D: Drinkable but the sweetness got pretty old by the end of the bottle. Don't think I'll be seeking out again. On to the Brooklyn version."
"Another good beer from Schneider and Sohn."
"A strange beer in that it blows away all of the normal yardsticks for rating a beer of its style. Weizenbocks are not supposed to be bitter, but this one is, and it's really nice! The weizen character increases with warmth, when cold it seems almost pure IPA. A wheat beer made for hop heads."
"If you can consider this beer a hefewiezen, then it'd be my all time favorite....I love beers you can't see through! Beautiful golden cloudy color, so many flavors in this one. Yeasty, citrisy, sweet, sticky...heaven in a bottle. No time to review, must drink!"
"Cloudy dark orange, generous white head, good retention and lacing. Aroma is big, herbal, somewhat medicinal, spicy hops, estery banana, fruity, with some pronounced alcohol. The flavor is as pungent as the nose, esters, banana, flora and herbal hop bitterness which carries into the finish along with a spicy alcohol ending. Strong, somewhat unique brew, but not particularly appealing. Body is medium, lightly creamy midrange carbonation. Not something I like to drink too much of."
"Overall, my favorite brew of the Schneider-Weisse giftbox. (Schneider-Weisse (2), Edel-Weisse, and Aventinus are the others) With the strong citrus component, it might make for a great summer brew, even though it's of a thicker body."
"D – It is probably not widely palatable, but we thought it was exceptionally drinkable."
"This is one unique beer. I wish that I liked it more but I can't fault it for being interesting. It is very solid and I can see some people really loving this beer."
"Pours a dirty yellow straw color with a small white head. Lots of suspended yeast throughout the beer. The aroma is citrus with bready malt and a slight hop character. The flavor is yeast, lemon, bready malts and hops. I didn't think this one was as complex as the Brooklyn version. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Good drinkability."
"It combines the depth and complexity of a Weizenbock with the freshness and spiceyness of a very good IPA - this is fucking outstanding!!!"
"D- This is a great brew. The European version of this collaboration has a much softer, less aggressive, more noble character- though I do enjoy the boldness of the American version as well. The 8.2% is undetectable and this is a very drinkable, good brew."
"Drinkability: A bit heavy, but a fun beer to drink. While it wasn't as good as I remember it being, I'm still a big fan of this beer. This was probably the fourth or fifth time I've bought it, and I'll continue to buy it as long as it's on the shelves."
"its a beer to watch out for you think that you drink a weiss but with 8.2% and 0'5 bottle its tricky but nice more experiments like this please."
"good beer wish i could taste and smell it a little better. really refreshing, which is sort of uncommon in a 8% beer."
"Drinkability - This is a very different beer and almost impossible to rate using style standards or comparisons to past examples of the style. I know it was very fun and exciting to drink though so thumbs up for that."
"Drinkability. Definitely a beer to experience and sip, but I can't see myself trying it again. Hopefully I can find the Brooklyn version of this to compare to out of curiosity, but I'll stick to traditional weizenbocks and hefeweizens which it appears I like better."
"Drinkability here is an issue: While the flavors keep it somewhat light, the beer is too heavy to come anywhere near a quaffer, and the alcohol level really hits the head after a full halb-Liter. Overall, though, this is a real winner and, together with the Brooklyner-Schneider version, this is a masterful collaboration between two skilled and highly-respected brewmasters."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very chewy. Carbonation is very crisp. Surprisingly easy drinking, especially given the bitterness and the 8%+ ABV."
"Notes - I was a little surprised at how hoppy it was. It's not unbalanced, but it's very untraditional, which is unusual for a German brewer. You can definitely taste the American influence. Overall, an interesting variation on an old style that's worth a try both for hopheads and wheat beer fans."
"Not impressed with this example AT ALL. Big letdown, tasted like a homebrew I messed up one time. First off this doesn't taste Weizenbock at all it tastes Belgian Golden Ale all the way and the yeast character overwhelms all else in taste and aroma. Coriander, honey, banana, candi sugar and hops all show up beneath the powerful yeast in the smell and taste. It actually makes the nose a little more aromatic than it otherwise might be. Just not a pleasing taste. Big bubbles, over carbonated and dry-i think they dropped the ball on this one. Maybe I got a bad bottle, either way I don't want to risk trying it again."
"An innovative beer with lots going for it. Interesting flavours, great mouthfeel and wonderful aromas. Unfortunately, the alcohol isn't as well integrated as would be desirable and this detracts from the beer as a whole."
"Pours a hazy golden orange, with a thin white head. Smells of earthy, woody hops, and a touch of solvent alcohol and phenolic yeast. Taste is very sweet, bread-like malt flavor up front, with a boozy, citrus middle, and a subtle fruit bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, low carbonation. Drinkability is good, the alcohol is detectable, but it is low. An excellent beer, I hope to get this again."
"Overall, this is a very interesting and tasty brew. Unfortunately, I think the hops gets mixed up with everything else in the taste. If if tasted as good as it smelled, this would be a mindbogglingly good beer. As it is, though, it's definitely unique and refreshing, and I hope I get to try it again."
"I give up."
"Poured a golden hazy orange with a nice creamy one fingered head. There was no carbonation at all and the head dissipated to an even, thin layer of foam across the top and stays that way. Beer smells of breadiness, malt, grass, lemons, spices. As most wheat beers, this is chewy, with a light to medium body. Carbonation dances on the tongue. Wheat, yeast and breadiness stimulates the palate throughout the entire sip while the hops hit the back of the tongue at the end. Have been to the Schneiderweisse beer haus a few times in Munich and this one is definitely an odd duck, so to speak. Not typical of the style, but very unique in flavor, and very drinkable at a decieving 8.5%. I've been away from wheat beers for a LONG time, but this one has the capability to suck me back in right away."
"Thanks to dear John K. for this sample. Poured great with a big off white head and plenty of lace. Color is a typical of the style hazy/cloudy yellow. Aroma is massively lemon along with some spice, fruit, hop, and malt. Flavor's almost exactly the same. Body and carbonation are quite good. Bit too lemony for session."
"Pours an opaque orange colored body with a small foamy white head, diminishing. Strong spicy and banana aroma. Alcoholy. Lemony aroma. Spicy taste, very strong. Creamy mouthfeel. Lemony, citrus taste. Some banana but not too strong.Not too shabby."
"I liked it a lot more."
"O: Decent beer, might be better off with less -OH."
"This is probably one of my favorite beers. It has everything that I would want and more. I would like to see how the Brooklyner version differs from this one."
"D: 8.2% abv eh? And I thought this was a session beer."
"Sorry for the atypical review, but I get bored with the same ASTMD system sometimes."
"Pours a murky orange with tons of sediment and instafade delicate white head, ok lacing. Smell: citrus, tangerine, spicy, leafy, musty. Very different. Taste: citrus but mostly big raw spicy and leafy flavors, tangy wheat in the back. By the end of the glass I was picking up green banana. Raw and astringent, it feels like an 'oops', but it's a respectable, unique effort."
"Overall, its very pleasurable to drink and it makes me want to reconsider my feeling on the hefeweizen style (I've only had two or three and didn't like any of them). Definitely worth a try!"
"Unique? Most definitely. Good? Certainly. Great? Probably not."
"This is great. Something I really enjoy, and would highly recommended."
"Not my favorite Hefe-weizen but still a great representation of the style. Zie Germans really do know zer bier, especially ven zey includen Amerikans!"
"D- Not hard to finish this beer, but I am not sure that I would want another one afterwards. I think I would rather have Schneiders regular hefe offering of this. If you would like something a little stronger than a hefe, this may be sure beer."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied, bordering on the light side, with a good drinkability."
"M - Overall a very good brew, a little thin and you can taste a little bit of the increased ABV but I'd definitely enjoy this again."
"Big hop flavor that starts sweet and actually fades to a mellow bitterness in the after taste. The hops are less citrusy then the smell lets on and there is a stronger grass character then I expected. The moth feel is watery and well carbonated. A little disappointing after the little sumpin sumpin, but still pretty good."
"I could drink this all night, even though the alcohol becomes a little noticable as the beer warms."
"Cloudy yellow colour, small white head, lots of lacing. Aroma is sweet and very hoppy with distinct notes of lemon, wheat and bananas. Flavour is also that full of lemon and hops, refreshing but with a bite, very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is crisp with small lively bubbles. This is like no other weissbier I've tried and i like it!"
"What a cool beer. Had only had 1 example of this tyle before and was recommended to try this. Glad I did. A very exciting nose with that hefe and IPA clash. Those banana notes bumping uglies with some lovely marmalade, orangey hop aromas. Again on the palate that bitterness that you don't get with a regular hefe filling the mouth. Lotsa fun. Really enjoying this beer."
"drinkability is scary with the 8+%abv - i am having no problems downing this beer - and i had no problems buying all 6 bottles they had at the store last week"
"D - If the wife wasn't there to pull me away, I'd be in jail now."
"D 5.0 - In one word - unique. And I like it. And its a steal on clearance at 3.29. I dont usually like the boozyness in over the top brews, but this one is for me. The dymanic friendship duo created a very dynamic brew IMHO. I am not a Weizenbock expert, but I do enjoy the citrus/wheat profile of this brew minus the dark fruit notes that can sometimes be evident. A unique twist on this style - well done and well received by my palete. It's approaching the edge of too strong and booozy, but it's a line I am willing to teeter for this fine brew! at 8.2%.. YES!!! ...if it was 9.2%, probably way to much for this recipe."
"Pours a hazy pale gold with billowy white head. Aromas of lemon, citrus, banana, and clove. The flavor is sweet pale wheat malt up front with loads of hop flavors adding lemon rind bitterness to the finish. Quite clove spicy as well. The body makes me think that it is probably a bigger beer and somewhere above 8% it is a big one. Wheaty and Hoppy all in one! Great."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a Duvel chalice from the bottle. Pours a deep golden color that is crystal clear until the yeast at the bottom clouds it densely with a murky tan, almost trub color. Aroma is full of herbal and zesty hops with a light and refreshing fruity undertone. Flavor is well balanced with all the wheat up front and all of the dry-hopping at the end. Fruity, waxy, wheaty, and spicy. Residual sweetness and stickyness as the drink progresses. I first had this at a tasting where I tastes both of the beers side by side. It was an interesting union of two very different beer making places. Two good breweries, two good beers."
"This is an interesting brew. It's not the most drinkable of weizenbocks. The alcohol is well hidden, but the brew still drinks a bit strong. I am glad I tried this beer, but I think I prefer my weizens lower on the IBU scale."
"Put against the Brooklyn one they are almost equal with this one tasting slightly better an the Brooklyn one smelling and looking better."
"Edited to add: I've now had the Brooklyn version, and I'd say while they are both very different interpretations, I think they essentially tie as far as quality is concerned."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable at 8.2% Its so easy to drink fast and I'm paying for it now. A great brew, for me it was like a hoppy heffe, i really dug this beer, Now to try the brooklyn version."
"This is a very original take on a Weizenbock but a damn good one. One of the best beers i've tried this year!"
"Hop flavors are abound in this beer as lemon, grapefruit and orange citrus leads the way. Clove and wheat notes are also recognizable, but the typical banana is nowhere to be found. Alcohol is there, but is kept in check pretty well. Seems a bit less yeasty than the Brooklyn version and a bit more alcoholic. This is a very fun beer to drink and is stylistically unique. I will definitely buy this again."
"Something different but refreshing for the warm summer months. I think it would go well with teriyaki meat and/or spicy pizza."
"This poured a hazy gold with fluffy white head. It smelled like lemon and banana and sour wild yeast, with creamy wheat and pepper. The taste was dominated by lemon and orange zest, followed by nutty malt and fresh earthy wheat and sour yeast, with a bit of peach and alcohol. It was fairly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a wonderful weizenbock. It had a great hoppy taste, while still remaining true to the style. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol well, so it was very easy to drink. This might be the perfect summer lager."
"This is a very pretty beer with excellent head retention. It's a dark gold color with a thick inch-thick topping of foam. The nose is quite tart, with a light touch of hops. Hmm, two flavor characteristics that don't go well together: bitterness and acidity. I suspect this would be an excellent beer absent the strong hop presence: it's got a light fruitiness, a load of cloviness, and a delicious, refreshing acidity higher than normal in most weizens. But the bitterness dries things out and just doesn't fit in."
"Big thanks to joss for this bottle. The bottle looks really, really good, the beer in the glass is incredible. Very turbid, aroma like a barley wine. Tastes the same - very strong, hoppy, finish very long and intense. Can't remember a beer as good as this!"
"Interesting beer - i love the german hefes, and this one is an interesting spin on it."
"Full bodied with medium carbonation. Feels creamy, but the carbonation helps it avoid being syrupy and cloying. So drinkable. I'm halfway through this already?"
"D - This is a really delicious weizenbock. Lighter in color than most but it tastes great."
"D - The 500ml are fine, but with the 8.2% ABV that's plenty for me. The great mouthfeel keeps me sipping, even with the somewhat so-so taste."
"An interesting beer. Much hoppier and more tropical fruits than the Brooklyn version, i think i like their version better. However, the hops in this beer are fantastic, i love the dry hopping of noble hops. A must try."
"Drinkability: Solid experience, holds a lot of variety and subtle depths, yet nothing seems out of place or too extravagant, woven together quite nicely!"
" Palate is rather fruity up front, with pineapple, banana, and grapefruit notes all making an appearance. The malt provides a light bready sweetness that underlies all of the fruity action in the front of the mouth. A moderate amount of bitterness emerges before the swallow, but the finish is rather smooth. This is an interesting offering, in that the hops are definitely right up front and in your face, yet never particularly bitter or astringent. A unique, thoroughly drinkable beer that offers some surprises and masks its relatively high alcohol content well."
"Pours with a healthly head consisting of tight, tiny bubbles which leaves chunky lacing on the glass. Color is cloudy yellow. The smell is slightly fruity with some grape and yeasty-ness and some hints of malt in there too. The taste was not what I was expecting from the aroma. A big hit of malt starts off the taste and then bitterness takes over with a slightly astringent, drying finish. This is one interesting beer. The bottle says it's a hefeweizen ale, and BA has it listed at a Weizenbock. I'd lean more more towards the weizenbock. Regardless, this is one mighty tasty beer!"
"I've had the Brooklyn version and now this version. I would say that both versions are equal but I give this version the edge as it has more body to it and different hops. Both are equally interesting."
"MF&D - nothing extra ordinary but nothing negative, a solid body with good carbonation."
"Both the beers made together by Schneider Weisse & Brooklyn Brewery are outstanding, grab them any time they are available!"
"drying hops balance the bready malts to make this dangerously drinkable for a beer at 8.5%."
"D- This is good drinking. The astringent finish leaves me wanting another sip... it's a setup. ABV is a bit high though, so I would only drink two of these in a sitting."
"D = I could easily drink these for an evening on the deck during the summer. Strong enough in ABV and flavor to not want too much at once, it is easy to drink nonetheless with each swallow making you want to take the next drink."
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a bright orange with a creamy off white head that leaves very little lacing. The aroma is quite a bit different the Brooklyn version. It is definitely more of the traditional weizenbock nature. Sweet banana pudding, vanilla wafers, clove, toffee and caramel. The flavor reminds me quite a bit of creamy banana pudding rimmed with Nilla Wafers. Also there is clove and pepper come through along with a definite tangyness from the wheat malt that underlies the whole flavor profile. Its really striking and I rather like it. The mouthfeel is light and finishes dry with the tang still lingering on the palate. I really enjoy this beer. I would go on and say this is the better version. Sorry Garrett."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. The alcohol content prevents it from being sessionable, but I could definitely drink at least a couple bottles in a sitting. Now if only I can get my grubby paws on the Brooklyn version."
"D - Oftentimes I am disappointed by hefeweizens that are too sweet and lack hop presence. This brew is a wonderful reminder that hops are flowers - the perfume and taste of the hops are a wonderful complement to the fruity, spicy notes that we come to expect from a hefeweizen."
"Pours with a nice head, cloudy golden, very nice. Smells like a pale ale, light hops, some nice malt, but the hops just take control. Taste, well, a great balance between the two. Starts off like a typical weizenbock, yeasty, sweet, a bit of lemon, you get ready for the pineapple or citrus blast, but before it gets there, boom, hop tempering. Sweet backing some nice dry hops. Nothing crazy to mess with the balance. Just right. Mouthfeel is crisp, sweet turning to dry, just balanced. Super drinkable, no hint at all of the ABV. I love Brooklyn, I love Schneider, I love this amalgamation!"
"Overall, this is unlike any beer I have ever tasted. I appreciate the originality of such a mutant/hybrid beer."
"i compared this side by side with the brooklyn version and liked brooklyns better, but they both paired very well with food."
"The mouthfeel is thick, but oddly refreshing, nice. I could drink a couple of these, good beer."
"Medium to thick in body. I don't know if my nose is tricking my brain into thinking it senses something it doesn't, but it actually feels like drinking pulpy orange juice, just a touch more thin. Indeed, this begins to weigh somewhat heavily on my stomach and takes the drinkability down a notch, but I'll have no problem finishing this glass."
"Pours a creamy pale orange with glowing edges. It has a frothy pure white head that lasts the entire time you are drinking this beer. Aroma is heavy with spices, earthy hops, some banana and yeast. Flavor is light sweet and toasted malts, white pepper spice, light hopiness and ends with a fluffy bitterness. Its medium bodied beer with plenty of carbonation. I like the amount of spices that the flavor has and it ends up semi-dry. Very good beer."
"I love it - kudos to Hans-Peter Drexler and Garret Oliver. Wonderful craftmanship.Awesome ale. We're not worthy!!!"
"D: If it wasn't for the high abv, I would drink this all night."
"A nice taster and a drinkable offering. Given the choice, I'd probably try a separate offering than go back to this one. Good - not great."
"The smell is bananas, literally. More bananas in the taste, some cashew flavor, and some wheat. Mouthfeel is similar to a strong belgian pale ale IMHO, very nice. Drinkability is very good, this is very appropriate for the warm weather it is released into. Ever since it had stopped being distributed last year, I was yearning for it. This beer is in my top 10 list, incredible beer."
"Poured in to my Aventinus 100 anv glass. Pours a very nice clear golden color and then towards the end the clouds start to pour in. The head forms perfectly and the beer in the glass looks like a work of art. The aroma coming from this beer is just heavenly, extremly floral notes up front with a bit of spice behind it. The taste is what made this beer so tasty. The floral notes hit me pretty strong at the start and a spice back it up. I felt the floral notes and the spice were balanced perfectly and made for a wonderful and amazing brew. The alcohol and carbonation was just enough as they helped with pronouncing the flavor and aroma. The beer could be had in a session as long as you whatch the amount. The alcohol is well hidden and can sneak up on you."
"The mouth is where it's at. Very creamy, and as the nose promises, it's loaded with spicy and somewhat floral & piney notes. The banana is less pronounced here but not in a bad way. Very refreshing, very easy-drinking and frankly better than I remembered."
"drinkability- short review, but good beer."
"Pretty good start, but the product is probably just a bit too old. Would really like to get a fresh one."
"Very drinkable, certainly an interesting style. Refreshing and yet features a healthy dose of hops. I will be interested to try the Brooklyn version, as well."
"Schneider & Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse is a very cloudy dull gold beer with a thin, dense, white head that has good lacing. It has a fresh, fruity, spicy aroma with notes of lemon, orange, coriander and banana/clove. It is medium bodied; smooth and lively with a clean finish. It has a full, fruity wheat flavor with lots of spice. It's chai-like. It's a little sweet, a little bitter and incredibly drinkable-- even at 8.5% ABV-- Look out!"
"A 500ml bottle purchased in MD. Poured into my weizen glass, the beer appears a hazy dark yellow color with about an inch of pillowy white foam. Nose and flavors are dominated by floral bitter hops, orange, lemon, bananas, maybe a touch of grapefruit, yeah it's fruity, spicy yeast, caramel, some alcohol. Bordering on full bodied with ample carbonation. Very tasty."
"Drinkability is good and accessible to many palates!"
"A bloody great beer, this one."
"Not really feeling this one. I MUCH prefer Schneider's other unfiltered offerings."
"D: This is a rather good beer, but for some reason it didn't really do it for me. This one proves that more hops is not always better. It lacks balance, the flavors are not integrated with each other and the alcohol is too prominent."
"Note: I rated this one as Hefe-Weizen, but here at BA I noticed that it's labelled as a Weizenbock - a style I'm not familiar with. I guess that makes my comments about the high alcohol a bit out of place."
"The mouthfeel was actually very smooth, but whenever I licked my lips, which I do without really thinking about it, I would get the bubblegum taste, which was making me unhappy. Might have upped the drinkability rating, though, since I will say I wanted to keep drinking it to forget about my lips."
"I do not think this is the first weizenbock I have ever had, but it's the first I've ever reviewed. I hope it is not the last, and I definitely intend to try the Brooklyn version soon."
"Overall I'm a fan of this style and this beer didn't disappoint. Nothing really pops from this beer but it's solid. Worth a shot."
"This is a great drinker if you can handle the abv!"
"Overall - Were you actually expecting a less than glowing report for this one? Seriously, how can you go wrong with a collaboration between two of the world's premiere brewmasters? This is absolutely a repeat buy for me."
"i love this beer. i'm a huge bavarian/hoppy fan...this beer KILLS! It is almost the best of both worlds. Eventhough it is not perfect (because what bier is?!?!), it comes damn near close. I could drink a 6er of this myself while listening to Schonberg and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum."
"This beer is well worth looking for and I look forward to trying the American version."
"D: I found this brew to be dangerously smooth, refreshing and drinkable. I'm storing it at about 40 degrees, but once this baby warms up it goes down easy (like most brews from Schneider). My new favorite wheat brew... I bought out my local beer shop's supply.. about 15 bottles."
"Has this at the Capital Ale House in Richmond Downtown. Poured into a weizen glass. Pours a very hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Spicy and flowery in the aroma. Some banana, orange and light clove with an awesome smack of hop bitterness. Nice dry finish. A very interesting blend of ipa and weisse beers. I like the brooklyn version a little better. Will try again."
"D: This is kind of an odd bird. The different components of this beer don't really come together all that well, but there's nothing that really drives me away either. I'd say this is worth trying at least once."
"The taste is very interesting, light in body with lively and zesty with a lot of flavour: fruit, leaves, hints of citrus and juniper and fermented raisins, bread crust. It has a dryish, leafy finish with a zesty peppery-lemony bite and hints of orange zest and grapefruit."
"I was a little disappointed in this one. I think the collaboration idea was excellent, but that oj flavor got the best of me. I would like to try the Brooklyn version as a comparison."
"OVERALL: This one is a tough to to judge overall. First off, it's very interesting and done very well. The hop qualities set this one apart form the others in the style and, in a way, reminds me of a Belgian witbier somewhat. On the other hand, the strong hop profile can become overwhelming by the half way point of the glass; the first few sips were amazing, but I found it more and more difficult to drink as the glass emptied. This hurts its drinkability somewhat. A better idea might be to offer this brew in a 33cl bottle instead of the half litre. Anyways, definitely worth trying if you're lucky enough to come across it in your beer travels."
"D- Very drinkable. This is a nice combination."
"D: I really liked the hop dominated flavor. Very drinkable."
"Maybe it's just that this is hitting the spot, but man, I could drink this all night. Interesting and delicious; this is why we brew beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber with a 2 fingered white head with mild lacing. The smell is a mixture between lemons, bananas and malt. The flavor is ver hoppy for what I look for in a weizenbock, and not nearly enough yeast flavor for my likings. This beer has a nice mlat base, and has too much lemon flavor, and hardly any clove/banana flavors. The mouthfeel is ok with a semi dry aftertaste. Kinda drinkable, decent for 8.2%."
"D: A really interesting beer. I haven't had a whole lot of weizenbocks but I really like this one. It is very complex, with a ton of flavor. A great change of pace from some of the more one-dimensional styles out there. I'd pick it up again."
"Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, full bodied, with a carbonation that's a bit more subdued than expected. Hops are a bit less pronounced than in the Brooklyner version, but then, the bottle I had isn't quite as fresh either. Overall, still a great beer."
"This has a lot of Old World classic overtones with some experimental techniques to mix it up a bit. Maybe not quite an exercise in Beautiful Chemistry but it's definitely solid and the craft beer community is better for the effort."
"The color when poured, was a nice deep hazy golden yellow, with a medium amount of light tan foam and a fair amount of lace on the side on the glass. The smell of hop's and spices filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste was of a mild bitter hop's with orange, coriander, yeast with a bitter/sweet finish. What a pleasant surprise to find this Hopfen-Weisse. Another winner by Schneider & Sohn. Also, I found out, the warmer it got, the flavors started to change and get more intense!"
"I must raise concern over the disproportionate pricing of this beer's Brooklyn-brewed cousin. The Brooklyn is priced at $20CDN per bottle and the Schneider is only $4.50. The slightly larger bottle size does not justify this pricing snobbery in the US/CDN craft market."
"Drinkability- Ver very refreshing and unique would be my way of describing this brewski, definitely one of the more light and refreshing 8.2 alc% beers I have had in while, very balanced with fruitiness, sweetness, and strong hops, a beer I envision as delicious on a hot summer nite probably with a nice bbq, its leaves you feeling refreshed and quickly buzzed good beer for sure"
"Half-liter Euro bottle, with some batch code on the label; ""robustly dry-hopped"" with Hallertau Saphir. Pours a medium-hued cider color, fully opaque, with high carbonation and a noisy, three-finger whitish head that leaves little lacing. In the nose there's a lemony hop presence, with some phenols, orange, and a bit of pith. It starts really nice, but peters out over time. On the first sip, there is some immediately-detectable heat, followed by some rather sharp, almost piercing spicy flavors consisting of lemon, banana, latex, and spicy yeast, along with a medium hop bitterness. It has a medium body, with crisp, numbing carbonation and some hops in the finish. This beer is all out of balance. The alcohol is waaay too noticeable and the flavors are incredibly sharp. This one needs some age to tame the heat. We'll see how it compares to the one brewed on this side of the pond."
"Pours a thick pale orange color. Thick head with many craters and peaks, good retention. Excellent lacing. Aroma is very sweet as someone said almost like bubble gum. Strong flavor of cloves and banana, kind of peppery. Thick carbonation evident for mouthfeel. Can definitely taste the alcohol in it. And way to zesty for my taste."
"Hit me wrong at first although now that I'm past half way I'm impressed with the balance, something I havn't taken in consideration because of the surprise I had of the whole experience."
"Drinks like a champion. I like it alot. I am a strong supporter of this kind of collaboration and fusion of styles. I love German wheat beers, but adding some more aggressive, yet restrained, hop character to this one has resulted in a wonderful creation. Cheers to Brooklyn and Schneider!"
"A great match."
"D: I could drink these all night. However, at 8%+, probably not a smart ideas."
"""damn that filthy mexican banana!"" ... pours with a medium airy white foamy head .. has a dark amber body with swirls of sand in the desert .. some yeast and honey in the nose, very wheaty too .. has a pretty big bitterness profile, and is very clean in the mouth, i like it .. why is this version $5 and the brooklyn version is $17 ??? ..boner ... great lacing too ... the abv seems perfect ... an imperial hefe, if you will ..."
"Overall a pretty good hefe-weizen from a pretty good brewery. Would recommend to most."
"M&D: a refreshing, lightly effervescent, carbonation contrasts with an oily and big hop/malt body just fine, while the alc. is very restrained and allows the flavour to develop without causing any heavy touch on the palate. This is a lovely lovely lovely... hoppy ale that I can drink non-stoppingly for hours! Given the German version of this hoppy weizenbock being already this BIG, I can't imagine how much bolder the US version can be?!"
"D - A very good beer, yet at times I find the perfumey hop along with the weissbier fatiguing. Screams for a food pairing - indeed, I have had this with a spicy Dijon mustard shrimp appetizer, and it was brilliant. Kinda too pungently hoppy and yeasty, not to mention alcoholic, to drain a few of them by themselves. A crazy, off-center, intensely flavorful beer. Who said the Brooklyn Brewery, and German brewers, are too traditional and dull? An excellent oddball collaboration of two top-shelf brewers, this is serious foodie beer."
"I highly recommend this beer. I hope Schneider & Brooklyner do more beer together. This beer is a work of art."
"Overall: A great Weizenbock. Compares well against Weihenstephaner's Hefeweissbier (which I loved), just stronger and fuller."
"D- One of the smoothest & easy to drink beers i've had during this rough winter and a nice change up. A nice amount of carbonation & not an overload of varying flavors make this a candidate for more than this 500ml version at anytime of the year especially the summer. Has all the chops to be sessionable besides the 8%. I still need to try the Brooklyn version."
"Best...Experiment...EVER!"
"Notes: I had the Brooklyn version already and was impressed with both. Recommended."
"Citrusy hop smell is quite prevalent, also banana smell comes through with some floral and spice notes. Taste Follows through with banana notes - at first - while hops and citrus become more prevailing. Very interesting balance of hop to wheat creates an explosion of flavors. Is a tad hot on first taste, but future taste disguised the 8.2% ABV. Nice finish, great taste. Great beer."
"D - Great amazing. completely delicious. Hefeweiss is one of my favorite session styles. could easily drink all night on these."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden haze, a huge head, with bits of yeast floating throughout. It has a great scent of pineapple and light pine. The taste is very good with a mild hoppy bubblegum flavor. The mouthfeel is nice with the perfect amount of carbonation. It had a slightly dry finish begging you to drink more. This is a very good beer and will be revisiting frequently."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick two finger white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a wonderful wheat malt and hefe yeast scent along with an earthy/grassy hop nose. The taste is great as well. It has a smooth hefe flavor that's incredibly earthy and bitter in the finish. I love the hop character of this beer. It's not really fruity like most hefes, but the malt bill seems the same. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. I like the hopped up wheat brews. I've made a few myself and really enjoy them."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with little flecks of yeast; the head is billowy and white and leaves lots of lacing down the glass. The smell is pine and tropical fruits, very strong and fresh. The taste is a hit of fruit (papaya, maybe) giving way to sweet grain, then finishing with hot alcohol and lingering hop bitterness. The carbonation is lighter than the head would lead you to believe, and it fills up the mouth nicely, though the finish is a little sticky. It's too hot and big to drink in volume, but this one 500 ml. bottle is going down just fine."
"8/4/7/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Poured a tan yellow with a huge frothy head, foamy in a good way. The aroma was unmistakably citrus, with a hint of hops. Tasted pretty much liked it smelled, which is to say, amazing. Strong citrus flavor with a sharpness being provided by the extra hops. Finished strong with the alcohol coming through. Very well balanced and highly drinkable, a fantastic beer."
"D - The only problem is the high alcohol content. Coming in at 8.2%, only 1 and I need to wait for a bit before I try my next beer. This is the only reason it got low marks on the Drinkability."
"Anyway, this beer pours bright and golden. It's cloudy with a pretty nice head. It's hard to give too high of a score for appearance because it's not astoundingly beautiful and there's little competition readily available, to me anyway. On the other hand, the smell is phenomenal. It has the sweet, spicy and fruity wheat scents of Aventinus combined with citrus hop aroma, which all combined makes for a complex but sunshiney scent. It's a strong scent and the addition of stronger hops is appreciated. The taste is also quite good, although it is so reminiscent of Aventinus that I don't want to give a perfect mark here. The flavor is a unique combination of sweet lemons and subtly spicy wheat. The finish is the dry, clean taste of good hefeweizen. I enjoy the addition of hops, but I could understand another opinion. I'm really not picking up the phenolic characteristics mentioned by some reviewers. I almost feel like I just got a really good bottle of it or something. Perhaps, the recipe has been altered over time. The label is different but definitely the Schneider version. At any rate, the feel is delightfully sudsy and the beer is marvelously refreshing and easy to drink. Great beer. I want the Brooklyn version bad."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a frothy, white head. Aroma has hints of banana and grafefruit, very citrusy. tastes very much like the aroma with a strong banana and citrus flavor as well as a nice clove spiciness. Very drinkable and quite tasty."
"The taste is incredible. The hops are higher than a normal wheat beer, but they are perfectly balanced with the malt. Alcohol is well hidden. I could drink quite a few of these. Definitely a session beer in my opinion."
"Pretty good drinkability, and a beer that I would definitely revisit."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Not something you are going to session with its high ABV. I would definately buy this again."
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"The beer poured a wonderfully cloudy gold with a good white head. The aroma was of floral hops and mixed fruit. The taste was shocking, the best I could do was it tastes like wedding cake with a lot of aniseed. This is mixed in with floral hops and a distinct but light taste of alcohol. The feel was very light a dry. A most amazing feel. I found this to be a highly enjoyable and different beer. I only hope I'm able to get back to the Frisco Grill before the kegs gone. I don't see this as a big session beer, but definitely a very enjoyable beer."
"A fun beverage no doubt. The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side but it really doesn't impact the drinkability. A great beer that I am really enjoying."
"I would highly recommend this beer. I bought this at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, based on a very good employee recommendation."
"I like this beer quite a bit. This was a very interesting experiment between Brooklyn Brewery and Schneider. Great Job!!!! I look forward to trying the Brooklyn Version."
"poured from a bottle into a weiss glass. pours thick and cloudy after a few swirls. smells like a weiss with a mix of something else. taste.... first one i had i was NOT into. then i had the brooklyn version and loved it. now on my 2nd bottle, light but flavorful wheat with a sweet slightly bitter finish. this is far better than the previous two. perfect carbonation, light in the mouth. i love it."
"Cloudy, pulpy, muddy orange body. Tall, rocky, three fingers of long-lasting, great-lacing, off-white head. Fresh wheat, boozy bananas, some clove, and loads of grassy, herbal hops on the nose. Interesting. Herbal bitterness up front. Toasted wheat bread malts follow. Rummy fruits, with accents of banana, and some tropical fruit follow. Some bitter astringency shows through and almost tastes medicinal. Boozy finish with lingering fruit and herbal hops. Medium-bodied with a soft feel. Disappointing."
"Still - and judging solely on its own merit - I found the Hopfen Weisse quite drinkable, and will try it again as it is available."
"As previously stated, I haven't been a huge fan of wheat beers, but this beer is going to force me to reevaluate that stance."
"As good as expected."
"Pours a hazy, light gold in color. Decent head on the pour. Smell is wheat, but I'm getting quite a bit of clove in this as well. You get a bit of the lemony banana flavor in the taste. A little zing from the citrusy hops. Decent mouthfeel and a pretty easy drinker for being 8.2%."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't want to drink more than 1"
"This beer is clearly a labor of love, but it needs tweaking to achieve a little more balance. I long to try the Brooklyn version. Wonder which one I'll prefer? I prefer American hops but also German wheat beers."
"This was well done, being both complex and a touch thick but still coming off as quite refreshing and quaffable. I'm glad to see that this is going to hopefully be a yearly release, as I'm good to put a bottle of this down each summer."
"Drinkability: It's ... well, it's a dry-hopped weizenbock is what it is, and a pretty damn good one once it warms up. It's well done, it's enjoyable, it's drinkable, it's refreshing, the alcohol's well-hidden - all in all, a good beer."
"Drinkability- Fantastic. I had to read the label to know that this was 8.2%. Booze is totally hidden. Seek out."
"This is a very easy-drinking beer for one so strong. It has the solidly spicy clovey aroma as one expects from Schneider Weizen, and I glad for that because it would have been a mistake to load up the hop aroma on top of that. It would have just been a train wreck. As it is, the initial perception comes off like a big, rich hefeweizen, but then the finish fades into a bracing hoppy dryness, which is a grand way for a beer to finish. All in all, I find this to be a refreshing conflation of traditional methods; a successful experiment. I would drink it again, though it was a bit pricey."
"D- A very enjoyable and well done. The alcohol is well hidden. I would make this a regular thing, but the price affects the purchaseability a bit."
"Drinkability - a creative and tasty example from Brooklyn. Well done."
"Drinkability suffered only because of the strength of the alcohol, it came through a little strong for it to be a real big drinker but the 500ml bottle was easy to get down and at 8.2% I was ready to take a break or switch to something a little light anyway."
"A really fantastic experiment here. More please."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Corked 750 ml bottle. Light orange color with a huge fluffy head with good retention leaving a lot of lacing. Aroma is very floral with light zesty fruits, hops and some champagne. The hops taste zesty and citrusy with a malt base present, some bubblegum and champagne in there as well. At times it seemed a little like chemicals. It's not alcoholic but it is bold. Finishes a little sour and tangy with a lemon zing. A interesting and unique beer. I can see some hefe in it, some imperial pilsner as well but I woudn't categorize it as either of those. Fun to try but not something I'd want to have on a regular basis."
"Pours a hazey, cloudy amber orange with not nuch of a head after the pour. Great looking beer, could just use some more foam. The aroma has a great dry bread aroma that has a lot of hops for a weizenbock. The malts and more than average amount of hops make for a combination of traditional and interesting tasting beer. You can taste wheat flavors of banana and cloves plus the British hops adding agreat citrus note to the sweet malts. Can barely tell how high the alcohol content is. The palate is bitter and fruity sweet. A little syrupy palate. Great beer and a great flavor combination for the style."
"This beer is very substantial, but not at all overwhelming. Full-bodied and bready, but with some buttery slipperiness (from hop oils?) and all of it nicely and crisply carbonated."
"Mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation and light finish."
"D: Pretty delicious. The larger body makes it a bit less session-able than a typical hefe, but it's still a pleasure to drink, and I could see myself knocking back quite a few of these if I had them."
"I've had my share of hoppy wheat beers that I've liked. This one has too much going on. Either dominate with the hops are just have a pinch of them, blending the two makes an odd concoction."
"Poured into a weizen glass for a fraetly carbonated cloudy, oranish body with golden hues. Came to a quickly receeding, mind you, three-finger head that left a ring as it went down. A great smell of citric (bananas and lemon mostly) with some earth tones as well as some sweet and sugary malts (honey/candy?). There were some spices such as coriander and pepper along with hints of dark fruit like black cherries in the smell as well. An intense hop bite with tropical flavors such as banana, orange, lemon and pear (citric flavors too, I know) hit my tongue first as it is a chewy, thick medium body that is smooth and creamy. Must be some fulelr malts in there like dough or something. The pepper and clove spices are on the sides and they balance well, as nothing is overpowering in this beer. A slightly dry, mildly sweet backbite, something akin to sour apples or something with some tartness. Not only is the price great (especially compared to the Brooklyn's version) but with the exceptional alcohol burn on a couple sips they hid the ABV well, and I could session this bad boy. The better of the two collabos in my opionion (not that the B-S version isn't also great)."
"Always cool to try a brewer collaboration, Brooklyn makes good beer and this was no exception, have not had much of this style but was pretty good, might drink again, recommended"
"This beer is brilliant, like a guy juggling six oranges with one hand, doing card tricks with the other, balancing a ballerina on his head while jumping rope. Ultimately, however, it's almost a little too much to take. Recommended to try, but not something for a lazy evening at the pub or kicking back with the game."
"Cool, like Reese's cups this the great taste of two different styles put together. Yeah the nose has some banana notes but the hops also appear. The taste is like hoppy banana mixed with spicy yeast. Actually reminds me of Saison Dupont with more hops. The hefe style can handle additions of fruit so why not hops. Can't wait to try the Brooklyn version."
"I read the bottle and expected wheat.. then I smelled and expected hops and spice. Tastes like both. A great hoppy flavor up front but smoothed out by the wheat.. The hops are what I like about this one. They aren't overpowering and don't give you that hoppy spicy bite. It was good all the way through.. one was enough though. I'm glad I tried it but probably won't look for it again. I would recommend it."
"Pours a hazy yellow/slight orange with a nice looking white head that leaves ok lace. Nose is mostly yeast, with some banana and a bit of clove. Taste follows with some banana, some clove, and a kind of wierd almost slight citrusy cumquat taste. maybe coriander? or some slight hops? shit i dont know. Mouthfeel is a bit chalky but overall pretty good. Drinkability is good but not great. certainly good for the abv. Overall a good beer from hans and garrett, but I have had much better. I cant say whether or not I will get this one again, but its a possibility. certainly worth a try, not bad at all."
"Very good beer, I'm pleased with it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Quite a full bodied wheat beer. Then again, it is above 8% so I guess that it is only natural that it has a much more significant body. As afore mentioned it is a bit warm, it leaves the palate with some alcohol warmth and taste after it is swallowed. Finish is semi-dry, but for me it is heavier on the dry side. This is one that I couldn't drink more of in one sitting. A nice venture for Schneider and Brooklyn but I don't think that I'll be picking it up again. Its good, unique, adventurous, etc. but once was enough, it just doesn't do it for me. This is truly one to pick up, never have drank anything that is even close to being this unique before...if you can get your hand on this then pick it up."
"Poured into a Franziskaner weizen glass. Huge off-white head froths up above the rim and leaves chunks of lacing. Tons of sediment, mostly yeast, but some chill haze too. Aroma is clove-dominated with some sweetbread malt, cinnamon, banana, and eggnog. Flavor has a nice wheat malt and banana ester basis, with all kinds of spicy accents. Obvious clove, nutmeg, and Hallertauer zestiness. Some vanilla sweetness and citrus. Tons of complexity, probably the deepest wheat beer I've ever had. Finish is dry with a light pithy bitterness that lingers. Very drinkable for the 8.2% abv that you couldn't have guessed was there. Great beer."
"A refreshing gift from two genius brewers. Great-looking two finger head sitting upon thick pineapple juice colored brew makes for appetizing eye candy. A zesty lemon aroma with some horseblanket eases its way through your senses. Nonaggressive mouthfeel makes for some real savoring of the smooth, juicy taste. Citrus, lemon, sour notes, green apple skins, warming booze and slight funk. A touch of dryness at the end that softens out the initial spices. Complex tastes that hit every area of the tongue in a well-balanced enjoyable brew. There is a little something for everyone in this beer."
"That is good. Real good. Billowing pillow head towers over cloudy, fresh squeezed OJ. The aroma is a cross between a Belgian Wit and a Belinner Weisse. Tart orange peel with lemony zing. A presence of rock candy that is quickly disasembled and left crispy dry. Hints of wild cultures keeps me guessing if the ale is alive. An awesome triumph!"
"I see this rates fairly well..glad to see...for me, this is honestly one of the best beers I have ever had. It brings together so many good characteristics - you've got a complex hefeweizen background - the beautiful, soft, wheat malt character and the incredibly complex, fruity yeast notes - all tied together with a perfect hop accompaniment. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a weizenbock glass. Pale ale color with a nice foamy, tight head; just like a hefe. The aroma is a banana and clove exploison, mixed with band-aid. Mild carbonation and a slight haze. Hop particles are floating everywhere. This is an unfiltered beer to the core. The taste is a little mediciny at first. Then the hop bite jumps in your mouth followed by the sweet banana and clove taste you expect in a Hefe. I'm not sure why this is classified as a weizenbock because I consider it either a Maibock or Hefe, IMO. The body is perfect for a Hefe. I would rate it better if it were classified differently."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Sweet, initially at least, followed by an herbal, spicy hop blast. Hop flavors are prominent but bitterness is restrained. Signature banana and clove hefeweizen flavors are present, along with dashes of coriander, nutmeg and mace. The spiciness and sweetness are almost overwhelming, but it remains drinkable and fairly enjoyable, probably because no one characteristic is overwhelming. Still, I feel there's too much going on here; the sweetness and intense yeast profile don't truly allow the hops to come through. It's a good beer, I can't fault it much, but I have little desire to drink it again."
"500mL bottle purchased for $5 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a cloudy, somewhat neon yellow with decent head. Great, unique aroma that is, not surprisingly, a mix of wheat beer smells and hoppy hops. The flavour starts off strong and wheaty, like a weizenbock, with a strong hoppy finish and aftertaste. Very enjoyable stuff. More please!"
"D- I enjoy this style. I especially enjoy this style in hot weather. If I had to knock it, I don't love the floral aspect for this style."
"Drinkability: Not really all that hoppy, but I guess it's hoppy for a Weizen. It's more alcoholic than hoppy. It was nice to drink this offspring of a beer that combined a German Hefeweizen with good old fashioned dry hopped American Ale. After this, I would like to see more beer country collaborations."
"Pours a hazy yellow to pale orange-ish color with a big white head. In the aroma, a faint dry banana, and a small citrusy sweetness. In the taste, a nice hoppy presence, and a dry banana end. A small dry hopped bite, medium mouthfeel, and a dry hopped, dry banana aftertaste. A nice hefe, with a really nice hop presence."
"D: This is a weird beer, a weissbock, but it is nothing like Schneider's masterpiece Aventinus, but it is good in its own experimental right. This is a lot like the Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner version of a Hefeweizen, the drinkability score is lowered a bit because of its strangeness, but it is good overall."
"I enjoyed the Brooklyn version a bit more."
"Pours a very hazy and cloudy yellowy/orange with a fantastic meringue-like head, massive and pillowy. Clingy lacing left behind, floaties suspended in the beer, and a dusting of brownish sediment on the head. Banana bread smell, herbal hop aroma. Clove and banana taste, some lemon zest, mildly bitter. Medium-bodied, slight stickiness. Really refreshing and super-tasty. I'd give the advantage to the Brooklyn version, but they're both excellent beers."
"D: not a session beer as the ABV is too high. It sure is tasty though."
"This one is exceptionally drinkable. This is what would happen if a witbeer and an IPA got it on and had sweet sexy beer babies. I really can't recommend this one highly enough."
"Very champagne-like mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Not my favorite, but I'm glad I got to try this one."
"Starts somewhat sweet with yeast and spicy clove noticeable up front. Hops definitely push through after that. Nice bitterness with some pine and lemon zest. Only problem is that the transition to the hops creates a bit of a soapy flavor. Drinkability is decent and the 8.2% is unnoticeable. Interesting beer. Glad I gave it a try."
"D: My buds and I used to tip back quite a few liters of Hefeweisse from Glass Boots in Wisconsin during college. This would be a welcome change up from the traditional Wheat beers."
"This is my personal favorite over the Brooklyn version"
"Mouthfeel was very smooth and medium/full bodied. I'm not a big fan of this style but I liked the ramped up bitterness."
"D - The most outstanding element of this beer is the spectacular aroma. The clove notes are more distinct and clear than those of any beer I have ever had; like a handful of fresh cloves. The strong hop bitterness helps to make this a very drinkable beer."
"Overall, an interesting beer. Reminds me of a heavy-duty wit."
"Notes: Three Floyds should take notes from this beer to see how to mix hops and weizens/"
"A really excellent beer and one I must now find and hoard!"
"Hops dominate the taste, and they're much more spicy and european-tasting than the nose had led me to anticipate. Big, giant dry hopped hellertau permeate every last sip. The weizeny portion of the flavor is relegated to the background, and while it's still very good the strange, wonderful balance of the aroma isn't quite there."
"They aimed to do a weizen bock with extra hopping, and did so. Interesting and smooth. A nice bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, the wheat aroma dominates and is the initial taste. After that the bitterness overwhelms the palate.I can't wait to try the Brooklyn version."
"D- Very impressed by this beer since I'm not the largest far of the style. The beer is big in great way. Its great on a summer day and save the ABV I would drink this all day."
"I look forward to trying the Brooklyner version of this one brewed with American hops."
"Note: after the head dies down, and a little of the beer evaporates out of the glass (!), then I added the yeast laden remainder in the ""proper"" Schneider way; this significantly clouded/muddied the beer and stopped all the carbonation foolishness I was describing at first. See, there's lots of ways of dealing with it!"
"M/D: Maybe slightly overcarbonated, but overall a really good beer, but I think that I like the Brooklyner-Schneider version better. The beer was fairly rich and I am not sure that I could drink too much at a given sitting."
"very interesting beer, but not something i'd drink regularly by any means. perhaps dry-hopping with the hallertaur isn't all what it's cracked up to be?"
"I enjoyed this brew very much and thank BA Greggy for letting me know it was available at his establishment!"
"M & D: A well rounded, medium body. A bit warming on the way down with the alcohol content... Quite nice. A little more in the vein of Aventinus, but not really a comparison to make, I suppose. Another nice collaboration between these two. I think when all is said and done, I may prefer the other, but both are certainly worthy of trying and quite enjoyable beers. Prost!"
"D: get this beer! it is phenomenal! so interesting, especially if you do both side by side."
"I like weizenbocks but this one just didn't suit me. I prefer them more to the banana bread/sweet side than the clove powered kick of this beer. Maybe the hops (amount or type?) also were a little different than I'm used to. Interesting to try though."
"D- This is one outstanding beer. The only thing not to love is the 8.2% which can kind of sneak up on you. I am thrilled to death to have this locally available."
"D: Please keep making this. The Brooklyn version in the bottle has a slight edge but that is refermented. This was a fresh bottle so it has all of that wonderful hop taste. Never stop making this. A total winner."
"Mouthfeel is fine but the alcohol does burn a bit. Drinkability is limited by the sheer strength of the beer, but I don't think i am going to have any problem finishing the half-liter. Good overall and worth it, but based on this I don't think i could shell out $17 for a 750 of the brooklyn version."
"Drinkability: Have to try this one again, I love this brewer and I'm surprised not to love everything they do."
"The phenols certainly weren't shy after a little warming: what started out as a kick-ass weiss beer soon became an ass-kicking weizenbock. Still, the dynamics between flavours and smells made this beer so spirited and lively. It is both intense and interesting. It is profound yet perfectly drinkable. Hats off to you Mr. Drexler, please take a bow!"
"I really like this beer, but I liked the Brooklyn Brewery interpretation a little better (they should have used the same style bottle as this one though). Complex but still somewhat traditional. It's like the Honda Ridgeline commercial: tradition meets innovation. Recommended."
"Pours a bright hazy golden orange with a huge fluffy white head that lingers for most of the session as the bubbles continually regenerate the head. The lacing is delicate and minimal. The smell is big and spicy with huge German hops with a sweetness of bananas and cloves. This is all on top of the sweet wheat and yeast base that pervades the aroma. The taste follows the aroma and has the big wheat base that has abundant spices and lemon zest thrown in. The mouthfeel is medium and creamy with huge carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high on this one and it makes for an excellent summer brew."
"I'd like to try the other version, but I've never seen it. I'm not hugely impressed with this one."
"Delicious. Just delicious. This beer had an outstanding spiced orange flavor from the blend of hops and yeast character and really told a hold of me. In addition to this sort of spicy orange creamsicle flavor, there's are also earthy elements and like mellow herbs and citrus peel. The alcohol is also well hidden and the body isn't too thick. I call this dangerously drinkable. Watch out."
"Appearance is hazy golden with a tight off-white head that stands a good 5 minutes then relaxes to a thin layer for the duration. There are some seriously huge chunks floating around my glass that are really off-putting to the eye. Oh well. Moving right along, aroma is bursting with that familiar banana along with some fairly strong flowery noble hops. I also pick up some pumpkin pie spice in there. Taste is full of grainy malts along with the flowery noble hops. Hop bitterness is moderate just enough to perfectly balance the malt. There is also a significant lemony-tartness here and it finishes quite dry to make this a very refreshing brew. I would have rated this beer much higher if not for the floating chunks. However, my sample was imported from Germany and not produced at Brooklyn Brewery and I haven't had a bad beer yet from Mr. Oliver. Next time I'll try one from his site."
"Extremely drinkable and pretty to look at. Richly smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation to release the flavors and make it light on the PALATE. :)"
"Cloudy light blonde with a lot of suspended yeast,big foamy head that rose halfway out of the glass and finally settled into a nice finger of rocky suds.Smells of sour citrus grapefruit and lemons with the requisite banana clovey thing,also big grassy fresh hops.Taste is unique to say the least,kind of like a Belgian triple/IPA/Hefe hybrid unlike any other weizenbock I've ever had.Big spicy,sour hoppy notes that pummel the palate in a good way and a big warming alcoholic finish.Medium bodied with a smooth, steady fine carbonation that keeps things lively.This stuff suits me just fine but may be too big for some.Outstanding"
"500 ml bottle: From trade with pantanap (thanks a lot) Smells absolutely wonderful, like fresh picked fruit and a wonderful floral hop aroma that is to die for. Pours a cloudy and pulpy orangish/brown with a medium sized tan head that lingers for quite a while. Taste is got a nice hop texture, wheat, yeast, citrus(orange mostly) and a light spice note that comes toward the back end. Palate is somewhat bready, viscous, and carbonated at the back of the mouth. Overall, I could really enjoy this brew if I got it around here. I would buy as much as I could If I has a regular supply."
"Notes: I had pretty high hopes for this and I'm quite dissapointed it didn't taste as good as it sounded. I have the Brooklyn version in the fridge that I'll try soon enough... I hope that one is better."
"Drinkability- I'm still struggling through this one. It is getting slightly better as it warms, but still falls way short. Hopefully I start to have a change of heart about it. If I had another one I'd be more careful not to pour so much yeast in next time. Unfortunately however, I probably won't be trying this one again. I was hoping this would be much better. Hopefully the Brooklyn version I recently received in trade will be much better."
"Very tasty and drinkable. I split the bottle, but could easily see myself drinking 2-3 times as much as I had tonight. Very nice, can't wait to compare against the Brooklyn brewey version."
"Swirling, tempestuous activity in a Schneider Edel-Weisse glass... bright yellow brown body with a massive four-finger head--picture perfect... thick, uneven foam is left as tracing... the citrus and banana aromas are compounded by the spruce and pine accents... this promises to be complex and refreshing, if the smell is accurate...medium to full-bodied, light on the tongue but warm on the throat... the head softensits impact... a grainy texture is also noticeable by the third sip... unexpectedly, the combination of killer hops and mega wheat neither nullify nor mutate, but become congruous and complimentary in a delicious marigae... perhaps this one was a winner before the bottle hissed open, but with two brilliant breweries joining forces, the results are predictable and impeccable... cheers."
"D: Very good but lacking in the hops which make me prefer the Brooklyn vesrion. Complexity still makes this a pleasurable drinking experience. Short of being great."
"Overall, a very nice, solid beer, that I plan on picking up some more bottles of."
"D: This is a great brew. One is enough because the alcohol is pretty high and this is a complex beer. It has a lot going on here. I can drink this beer but it will be one a night and I would need a break for a little while. Still a great brew."
"Pours a cloudy amber golden, very nice bright colour, thick white head forms, sticks around, leaves lots of lace and settles to a thick layer, lots of chunkies from a bit of sediment that was stirred up during the pour. Smell is honey, wheat, vanilla, citrus and floral hops, banana, some light spice and alcohol, quite yeasty. Taste is honey and wheat, very nice citrus/oranges flavours, yeast, banana, quite hoppy, some bready malt, lightly bitter finish, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, goes down very easy with great flavours, I like."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced, light and easy drinking."
"D: While this is a pretty big beer for a weizen, it is very drinkable and much more complex. These are difficult flavors to weave together; I didn't believe it could be done but Garret and Hans-Peter have made magic with this beer. The Brooklyn Schneider is also a very good bet."
"Drinkability: From the outset the hoppy flavors compete with the weizen flavors and while it may be a draw, my taste buds are the losers; the combination just doesn't work for me"
"This is a .5L bottle of the latest batch from Schneider. (The label has changed a bit from the original release.) I bought a few bottles of the first batch, but I didn't like them. They all had a mild sour flavor...like something was wrong with them. Thankfully, this new bottle does not have the same problem. Still, I'm not a huge fan of this brew. I love hoppy American and European brews, plus I love German-style weizen beers. However, this uber hoppy weizen brew just don't seem to work for me. In this Schneider version, there's a prevalent soapy character I just can't get past. It's in the aroma and the taste, and I figure it's from the hop variety used. Unfortunately for me, the character takes me back to when I was a kid and said a bad word. My Mom's punishment for my mistake was having me suck on a bar of bath soap. Although not as horrible as that, this beer has a soapy character and bitterness that brought me right back to those old forgotten days of gagging on a bar of soap. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish the bottle, but at the same time I doubt I'll be buying this brew again. I tried this bottle side-by-side with the Brooklyn version (and I've also had the similar-in-style New Glarus Imperial Weizen). It seems like I should like all three of those brews a lot, but alas I guess it's not meant to be. Maybe if they used the same wonderful hops as in Sam Adams Imperial Pils, I would like all them better? I'm not sure. As it stands, Aventinus is one of my all-time favorite brews. I also think the Aventinus Eisbock and regular Schneider Weisse are very good. I love that Schneider is trying something different with the Hopfen-Weisse, but I'll stick with Schneider's other offerings."
"Body is medium, creamy, slick, and slippery on the tongue. Carbonation is fluffy and expansive. Excellent drinkability in spite of it's strength. Another first tier beer from the boys in Brooklyn. Well done."
"The taste is quite close to the Brooklyn version, with the main differences being a spicier hop note, more clove, and a sweeter, thicker malt base in the former. Both are good, but I think the American version pulls off a slightly better flavor profile. I do appreciate the spiced, zesty hop bite on the finish of Schneider's Hopfen-Weisse, which rounds out a medium-bodied, well-carbonated mouthfeel. All in all, this beer was outshined (although barely) by Brooklyn's version, but as far as price goes ($3.99 for 500 ml. vs. $12.99 for 750ml), Schneider is far easier on the wallet."
"Overall: Not really my cup of tea, although I do appreciate Schneider's focus on clove and not banana."
"D - easy to drink a few, but watch the abv."
"Appears a hazy clouded golden tangerine hue with a creamy hued billowing large bubbled head. As the last of the bottle empties the body becomes even cloudier more yeast adding to the mix causes the brew to look like a tropical banana smoothie. Head has great retention here with intricate even lacing clinging to my glass. Aromatics come with fresh zesty herbal hops very spicy with yeast esters and malted barley notes providing sweetness. A touch of banana but much more citrus than anything else, also an air of alcohol can be picked up. It really tickles the nose hairs. Flavor is great herbal zesty almost minty hop bursts layered with a big traditional wheat beer takes hoppy wheat ales to another level. The esters are somewhat lost in the mix of hops and alcohol at 8.2 percent by volume. Most hefe and wezinbocks tend to be overly sweet that is not the case here, aggressive Euro hops are fresh with grassy herbal and citrus notes, zesty wheat kick with the yeast playing such a big role in the overall mix of flavors with a dough like presence. Esters created by fermentation are evident but overshadowed by the hops and alcohol which I really enjoy. Again overall I get a minty sensation in the flavor. Mouthfeel brings effervescent carbonation trademark for good weizens, hop oils remains as well given it a slick feel really sticks around on the palate and almost coats the teeth. Drinkability is excellent creative cooperation between two great brewers it doesn't get better than this now I have to give the Brooklyn Brewing version with the American hops I believed they used Saphir hops in this brew. It goes without saying but you need to try this beer and definitely compare and contrast it with the other brew."
"This is one of the best wheat beers I have ever had."
"Pours an cloudy orange/gold color with a one finger white head. Wheat, banana, lemon, floral, sweet citrusy hops aromas all mix together. Sweet malt flavor, wheat and banana up front leads to a nice yeast and sweet orange hop flavor. Light to medium body, medium carbonation, this is a clean, crisp, and refreshing beer, easy to drink. Great partnership between two fantastic brewers!"
"Overall- Quite delicious! Easy to pound, even at 8.2% abv. A definite sumer beer."
"An interesting beer, and a good one. It reminded me quite a bit of Schneider Weisse, only with more hops and alcohol. Not one for everyday drinking, but a good choice for someone looking to try something a bit different. Now I need to get my hands on the Brooklyner-Schneider one. Recommended."
"Poured with a fluffy, foamy head that was quite large and stuck around for a while. The color was interesting: a really pale brown almost grey hue. Initial taste was quite intriguing and almost shocking. This wheat beer is full flavored and bitter with a complex almost smoky/earthy quality. Also spicy and hoppy, but not overwhelming. Highly drinkable, and on first tasting you'd never think it was 8.2 abv. A really interesting brew that I have to try again."
"D - Not really sure. Could probably have another and call it a good night."
"Cheers!"
"The taste starts very tart, brisk fruity carbonated tartness followed by a nectarine, orange, lemon, lime, tartness. Great taste something very exciting in this weisse beer highly recommended. I paired this beer with banana's foster the tartness def played well with this tarty, fruity beer."
"bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"D - The intensity of flavor along with the high ABV might make this hard to have more than a couple of, but I certainly won't have any problems finishing my glass."
"Very good beer from a very good colaboration. Definitely recommended."
"D : This is a perfect beer for a summer day. I would love to have more of this."
"I saw this at the beer store next to the Schneider Weiss which I have always enjoyed and figured I would give it a go. It poured crystal clear till about 2/3rds of the way through the bottle where all the yeast was settled, and there was a lot. I poured most of it in but the very bottom was like soup and I didn't want to overdo it. It gave me a nice 2 inch almost white head that slowly dropped down to a solid cover that doesn't seem to be going anywhere as I drink it. The beer itself is a nice orangish-gold haze. The smell at first was the typical lemony sweet weiss smell, but then you get the hop in the back of the nose; very interesting and pleasant. The taste however is only OK. There is a slight medicinal flavor right up front that quickly drops back to a slightly acidic, lemony wheat flavour that seems to envelop your tongue. This then leads to a slight hop bitterness that to me just seems a little out of place. It seems that if the hops were a little more piney or citrus it would meld really well, but to me they just give a bitter finish without much point, leaving what at first seemed to be a promising beer with a rather dead finish. Oh well, its certainly enjoyable, just not all I think it could have been. I will say the 8.2 alcohol is absolutely imperceptible to me."
"After experiencing this at a beer tasting hosted by Garret Oliver at Eli Cannons last summer, the news of it being available in bottles has lead to many happy sessions since and here's why. The appearance of this brew in my Tucher Weizen glass was hazy from yeast with a burnt orange hue. Loud, noisy and bubbly carbonation with a snow white head. The label alone is bright yellow and deep blue...very much the eye catcher. The aroma is bursting with zesty, citrusy esters primarily lemons and grapefruit. A very bubbly, zippy brew. Floral with wildflowers. Grassy, too. The taste is lemony and citrusy and oh so refeshing. The hop profile is understated yet its earthy and floral influence is everywhere. I let this chill longer than usual and didn't wait for it to warm. Initially, it's robust like pop rocks on your tongue form it's lovely carbonation. The chilly temperature did not diminish the flavor or effervesence at all. Drinkable? Hell yeah! Put in a stein for Oktoberfest! Enjoy it after cutting the lawn on a hot summer day! A hit in every way (like its Brooklyn brother)."
"Poured into my delirium tremens snifter, pours a hazy orange with a 2 finger head. Aroma is banana right away, cloves and pine needles. Taste is interesting for this style, its very mild and easy to drink. I really taste the banana and clove, also taste the addition of hops. Citrus and pine. To me it tastes like a good hefe with some gin added to the beer.( Weird i know, but thats what im getting ) Great drinkable beer, would never have guessed this was over 8%."
"The beer poured a cloudy straw-yellow color with a fluffy, white head into a chalice. The appearance was just what I expected of a true hefeweizen. The aroma was of banana and cloves - the classic weizen yeast profile - heavenly. The taste was a delicate blend of banana and clove esters with an understated, yet noticable, hop flavor and bitterness. A fantastic example of the style and immensely drinkable. I really enjoyed this beer."
"500mL bottle poured into a Brooklyn tulip. Pours a very hazy straw yellow with a nice fluffy off-white head. Aroma is bubble gum, sweet malts and a hint of citrus hops, very fragrant. The taste is sweeter than the Brooklyn version with the hops a little more subdued. The beer is light and crisp with very well hidden alcohol, I'd have no clue it was 8.2% if the bottle didn't say so. While not quite as different as the Brooklyn version, this is still a very unique and interesting beer."
"A very interesting wheat beer, definitely worth a try. The two breweries by themselves make some very good beers, and I'm excited that they are working together. I look forward to trying the Brooklyn version."
"drinkability: Well I bought a single. Why does that seem like it was an oversight? I wish I would've bought more and I'm glad that I have access to this stuff. It's really damn good."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, more as it went along as the fruitiness came thru stronger. I like this better than brooklyn's version, as I feel this one is better balanced overall and simply tastier."
"MF&D - Very complex, yet very well balanced. Crisp, yet slighly oily at the same time. You really have to try this one for yourself to appreciate it. I can't wait to try it's Brooklyn brother."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a massive three inches in height, and never really recedes. It is everything I like to see in a wheat beer. The aroma is of tangy wheat, floral notes, and hints of pine and citrus. The taste very tangy. It is perhaps the most tangy beer I have every tasted. There is also a prominent floral, and citrus presence behind the tang. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a creamy, velvety texture. Overall, this is a top notch beer. With all the hops I wouldn't call it the most refreshing wheat beer around, but it sure is interesting. I would certainly drink this again."
"16.9oz bottle poured into a Schneider Weisse glass with the yeast added to the pour. The appearance is rather stunning, with a nice cloudy golden amber color with a large off-white head. The aroma is wheat and slightly soapy with banana, citrus zest, yeast and some hops. The taste like the aroma is on the sweet side with some wheat, citrus, a touch of banana and clove, yeast and some spicy hops in the finish. Overall, this is a decent pretty solid brew that is worth a shot. On a side note, I think the Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse is even better than this version."
"Mouthfeel-a quick bitterness immediately mixes in with sweet lemony flavors, so far this is awesome! A froth on the palate sweetens it up just a bit and it finishes with a medium and welcome hop bitterness. As it warms the wheat is more present with a nice bite and some subtle peppery notes emerge as well. I loved this brew. Great in style, aroma and taste. My senses were rocked and I really enjoyed drinking this. Yes, I am rating it high- truly deserving. Cheers!"
"Poured a nice light orange with a huge head and solid lacing. Opaque, with tons of swirling yeast. Nose is strong with fruit, spices, etc. Flavor is strong and delicious. Lots of hops, very mild malt character, and then a ton of fruity wheat. There are about a million flavors in this one, all kinds of different swirling fruits like oranges, some grapes, and then a ton of spices as well. It's like they tried to mix every strong-flavored beer together, into one. Quite unique and tasty. Feel is good and full, with good carbonation. Overall, I liked this one a lot. Doesn't quite hit the Aventinus to me (which is the only other weizenbock I've had), but still, definitely a nice brew."
"500ml brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a murky golden yellow body with a good inch of off-white head. Smells sweet and phenolic - with banana, nut, spice, citrus, and malt all playing big roles. Tastes very complex, sweet, spicy, grassy, malty... Nut, banana, lemon, spices, orange, hints of caramel malt... More hoppy than a lot of examples of the style I've tried, but only to balance the flavor out. Other than a slight hop flavor that lingers, the finish is otherwise fairly clean and rather dry. Rich full mouthfeel, yet ample carbonation and no alcohol flavor or warming makes this beer an easier drinker than expected. Wow, this beer is good. Extremely flavorful, complex, balanced and very drinkable. I'll definitely be snagging a few bottles of this again, not only to compare to the Brooklyner-Schneider version, but also to see how it ages over the next few months (if I can wait that long!)"
"Wow! Recently caught this beer on tap at Blind Tiger Ale House in NYC. All I can say is this beer is the perfect beer. It has the sweetness of a wheat beer with a perfect amount of hoppiness. As the the beer warms a bit the flavors really come out. First the alcohol with the sweetness; then the sweetness, and finally all the flavors melding together in harmony. Then I went to the Beer Room at Whole Foods and bought a couple bottles of this beer to savor the taste later on the same day."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle and served in a weizen glass. This beer poured a bright, hazy orange with a substantial head of white foam that showed off some excellent retention. Lots of uneven, bubbly lacing was left around the glass. The aroma of the beer was made up of fresh wheat, orange and lemon zest, ripened bananas, and a hefty dose of spicy hops. Very nice! The flavor included bananas, oranges, wheat, and also some spicy, herbal hop notes. The 8.2% ABV was very well hidden. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, hoppy, and very refreshing. A great beer!"
"The German born bastard child of Schneider and Brooklyn Breweries. Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a huge soapy pure white head, that left some chunk lacing. The smell is outragously unique. A very fresh and grassy hop aroma hits right away then is followed by some funk phenols; pepper and clove. The taste is quite unique as was its American counterpart. A nice floral and grass hop, honeysuckle, spicy phenols. Again, pepper, clove and a hint of banana and green apple. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, more than I expected. Finishes with a nice funky bitterness. This collaboration was a fantastic idea that produced two fantastic beers. I have a bottle of each in the beer fridge just asking for a side by side comparison, which I will glady partake. I may have to adjust my scores after that throwdown."
"The beer smells of hops, banana, and the citrusy fruits. Very nice to the nose. The taste of the beer has a nice bitterness from the hops and the citrus follows quite quickly. The citrus in the beer comes out before the dry hoppiness. This is actually really good taste. The bitterness is perfect for me. It's like a blend of a wheat beer and a Belgian IPA. I'm diggin' this. The beer feels like a Belgian IPA and is a bit thin; however, this doesn't harm the beer at all. I could drink a few of these. Ace beer all around."
" The overall feel is a stinging yeasty spice kick with mild carbonation and mild bitterness left on the tongue. It tastes very well as it warms up and the mix is interesting to the palate. This was easy to drink for me but I could see it being difficult for others. My beer stated 8.2 ABV and I could feel it,but it was subtle."
"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured a hazy orange-gold; some clarity and lots of effervescence in the solution. Rocky white-colored head took up half the glass in the pour; however, minimal lacing adhered during the tasting. Scents of banana and clove dominate with a touch of bubblegum. More clove in the mouth, as well as a medicinal quality, citrus and hops. Lively well-rounded mouthfeel with a slight burn on the palate and back of the tongue. At 8.2% abv, the alcohol was very well-hidden in my opinion this is a pretty delicious and drinkable brew. Can't wait to do a side-by-side with the Brooklyn version."
"Pours cloudy orange with a fluffy white head. Aroma of orange, cloves, and fresh hops. Initially tastes like a spicy wheat with some additional notes of banaba, and finishes slightly bitter. Pales a bit in comparison to its exceptional counterpart, but overall, and excellent beer, one I will definitely have again."
"The second in consecutive days of the great collaberation stuff from Brroklyn and Schneider and bothe are great beers in my mind.Poured into my Aventinus glass a mix of light goden and peach with a very nice fluff-sticky white head just a great pour,citrus dominates the nose with a bit of spice,wow 8.2% ABV couldnt be more well hidden its just fresh and citrusy with light spice and good leafy herbal notes.I really liked this beer maybe even a little more than the American variety its just refreshing and flavorful great for a warm day."
"Bottle into flute. Very hazy pour with good retention. Watch out for the sediment. It smells like a great heffeweizen, but the hops do definitely start to become evident in the taste. Very drinkable and the alcohol is present but only if you attempt to find it as it is well hidden. Complex yet smooth. Quite a creation, worthy of trying at the very least once."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This beer's texture in the mouth is almost exquisite perfection. Slick and ever-so-slightly prickly, it foams and then glides right down the throat... becoming even smoother towards the end of the tasting. This beer was all over the map with regard to positive/negative points, and I would *strongly* suggest going with Brooklyn's Hopfen-Weisse if pressed for one or the other. A somewhat challenging beer to get through."
"Bought a couple last week from Bauer. Poured into two hefeweizen glasses. Huge white fluffy head that literally did not dissipate the entire time. The color was that usual hazy shade of yellow that comes with the style, with an opaque haze to the beer. Smell was great, with notes of orange and coriander present. I actually prefer the taste of this one to the Brooklyn corked bottle version. There is still some hoppiness to this one, but not as much as it's sister brew. The Schneider version has more of a sweet yeasty taste to it that makes people fall in love with German wheat beers. The only knock on this one was the alcohol content. Slightly above what I expected. But then again, both these beers surprised me in a good way, so I am happy with the end results. A great duo by two great brewers."
"D- Excellent, at 3.99 buy as much of this as you can! I have a sneaking suspicion this one will mature with great results."
"Overall, this was an amazing collaboration. In addition, the head retention was phenomenal with 1/4"" still being present to the last sip. This beer is certainly worthy of trying."
"D - Wow. This is a damn good beer, but it's ""extremeness"" is also it's shortfall. For the style, I find that the hopping that's done turns the beer from what would be a typically light, bright thirst quencher into something much larger that really demands more focused attention. Is this beer still suitable for summer? Definitely. BUT, with it's huge character and it's 8.2% ABV, it is certainly not one that you'd want to session all afternoon, unless of course you're working on making it an afternoon you won't remember."
"Recommended..."
"Overall - A very interesting collaboration between these two breweries and one that definitely works - it's a basically a turbo charged hefeweizen. I'm not sure about this in 500ml bottles though - it was pretty hard going towards the end !! Definitely recommended though..."
"D- This beer is so tasty that you crave more. High ABV so drinkability is not perfect, but this is a great brew."
"The drinkability is exceptional for 8.2 ABV. The alcohol only shows up as the beer warms and even then it is subtle. I could drink a few of these if not more and at 8.2 I could be in trouble before I knew it. Not filling and delicious!!! A perfect all season weizenbock. No wonder I bought a case."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a murky brown color weisse with a big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of wheat with some dry Hallertauer hops is different and very interesting. Taste is also dominated by wheat with huge floral and dry hops combining to make a really interesting beer. Body is full with limited filtration and loads of lees at the bottom with some great carbonation with no apparent alcohol. The malt somehow reminded me of a double wheat brewed by the Middle Ages brewery. Interesting but not necessarily something I would go for very often - I will stick with the regular weisse which is still a very good staple of the style."
"Drinkability: The hops really boost the aroma and flavor up without adding any overbearing bitterness. It's something different, I'll give it that."
"Three fingers of light tan head races to the rim of the glass. As the fat bubbles explode they leave scattered lace. Body is a rich murky honey lid color. Nose is very alive and pungent with fresh cut wheat, soapy minerals and phenolic hop notes. The first sip is loud but smooth with tart wheat and mellow zesty yeastieness. As your palate warms up to this one a silky tingle of spiceyness almost reminds me of a saison style. This beer is a unique combination of richness, spice, hops, freshness, zest and smoothness. Truely a adventure in a glass. Fun like this beer is very enjoyable to drink. Relatively clean mouthfeel for a beer at 8.2% alchol which is well hidden."
"D: Good drinkability, smooth, and unique from your typical weizen beers. A unique experience."
"Poured into a 16oz. Squatters glass a very cloudy brownish color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger foamy/creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, wheaty, nice touch of spices, bannanas, and some caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, slightly sweet, yeasty/wheaty, corinader, with a nice touch of bananna, and slight caramel. This is a very smooth brew going down, you would never know it was 8.2% ABV. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice twist on a Weizenbock, highly recommended. Thanks Bill."
"Overall I had waiting almost six months to crack open a bottle of this, being that I only had two I for some strange reason wanted to wait a while to start on it. I dont think that was a mistake as this was really fantastic. Having had the tap version from Brooklyn and now the bottled version it would be hard for me to say which one I prefer, but if I had to choose, I may go with this one as it was damn near spot on and really just an absurdly good brew. I have one bottle left and you could not pry it away from me, I will save this for my Bday or something special. This was really a treat and if I ever see anymore I will scoop it up immediately."
"D - Pretty good. A pleasant beer to say the least. I have the Brooklyn One to try tomorrow. Hopefully it is at least as pleasant as this."
"An interesting beer, at times the hop character can get in the way of the traditional Hefe Weizen elements, but I like the attempt. It is always interesting to try a new hop (Saphir in this case); it has this really green, herbal note to it that is quite distinct and almost like under-ripe pepper."
"This beer is well balanced, bold, and tasty. It is good, just not quite what I had in mind based on my only previous experience with a weizenbock, the outstanding Aventinus."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: Hazy amber-gold color with a medium off-white head that dissipates slowly. Stringy lacing. Citrusy hops, wheat and spice aroma. Medium, clean body with wheat, earthy malt and fruit flavors. Light spice underneath as well. The finish is fruity and lingering with a banana and clove aftertaste. All around good beer."
"This one poured with a giant, off-white head composed of pillowy foam. Good retention with plenty of lacing that started spotty, then became fairly solid and clumpy towards the end of the glass. The beer itself was a hazy butterscotch colour. The nose was spicy with fragrant floral hops and a lemony citrus character. Was there a hint of pine? Maybe. Malt was in the background, providing some depth. Mild bitterness with a hint of alcohol. Hops were alternately spicy and citrusy, but always fairly intense. There was also a banana fruitiness and a hint of vanilla. Hops lingered well into the finish. Medium bodied with a bit of slickness. Carbonation started fairly high, then settled down to a more reasonable (drinkable) level quite quickly. Mild warmth too. This stuff is tasty. A great experiment that worked much better than I expected."
"D: A very enjoyable beer...not surprising as it partners two excellent breweries that make a couple of my all-time favorite beers (Aventinus and Black Chocolate Stout). The Hopfen-Weisse is a skillfully crafted mash-up that is an interesting twist on the weizenbock style (which happens to be among my favorites). Quite drinkable, but watch the sneaky alcohol. Highly recommended - I'm glad to have another bottle in the cellar!"
"A spectacular collaboration of two continents from two evidently passionate and knowledgeable brewers. I'm utterly blown away from what I just experienced. I know FFF has their hoppy wheat Gumballhead - which is quite fine, but this pairing between Brooklyn & Schneider sets the bar for anyone interested in brewing a hoppy hefe with some staying power (over 8% abv). Off the charts superb!"
"I love a really good weizenbock. Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse, although decent, isn't a very good weizenbock. I'm sure the brewers had fun with the collaboration, but I wish they had been able to give us something more impressive than this."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with huge carbonation that makes it a bit prickly and adds some creaminess at the same time. Goes down pretty easily. Overall, this one just doesn't really grab me, maybe I'm not a fan of this particular hop. Either way it's an interesting collaboration with a big punch of hops. It's still worth trying at least once if you can find it."
"D- Nice as a change to my regular favorites, but not a beer I would run out to get everyday. I know this was a collaboration, but I do not know if they intent to bring it out again. I enjoyed the chance to try this beer and would have liked to have tried it on tap."
"Big thanks to Mr.J at Dennis Bros for throwing this into the mix on my latest purchase!"
"Very interesting, a super hoppy wheat. I did like the absence/suppression of banana flavors, but that might be a draw back if you are concerned about style purity."
"Pours an orange color with a rocky and fizzy white head with a lot of lacing that sticks around. Smell is of citrus and some grains. Mostly the smell is of spices like coriander more. I can also smell some dried fruits like apple and cherry. Taste is sweet and long finish. Watery body, with a strong alcohol presence."
"EDIT: Had this again at the Weissesbrauhaus in Munich. Poured from a bottle...but that bottle was dated as being filled 4 days earlier. Can't do much better than that. Maybe my palate has changed a bit, maybe it was a nice change from all of the normal German beers I'd had, or maybe the beer has been tweaked for the German market. Irregardless, I really, really enjoyed it this time around."
"Edit: Towards the end of the session, it got really spicy...lots of pepper in the flavour. Good stuff!"
"Maybe expectations were too high, but overall a letdown. Tastes just never quite came together, a case of the sum being less than the parts perhaps. Not saying the brewers shouldn't try again by any means."
"D. Still pretty drinkable despite the abv. Honetsly though, I would pass and have an Aventinus."
"D: A very good beer. Brooklyn Brewery and G. Oliver are leading the way with these US/European collaborations. If this is the type of beer that is a result I am in full support of this trend. This beer is well balanced, complex (a lot going on in this beer) and quite drinkable."
"overall, a very interesting experiment. I have not experienced a dry hopped wheat beer before and I really like the result. Hope they do this again."
"Cheers!"
"I liked the Brooklyner-Schneider a little better than this version, and tap seems better than bottled, but either way a nice pair of beers and a great collaboration. Something that I hope we see a whole lot more of even if it is a bit confusing. Poured a cloudy dark golden, even darker andd cloudier if you add the sediment. Very fluffy big white head. The smell has very pleasing aromas of banana, coriander, alcohol, and fresh grain. The taste is a bit sharper and spicy with more coriander, earthy hops, pepper, and just the barest touch of banana. There is an herbal grassiness that finishes it. Mouthfeel starts a little prickly but turns smooth. A little hot still, should even out a bit in the bottle."
"Frothy, off-white head. Hazy, amber apperance. Light hops, grass, some banaba, and some clove. aroma. Very long finish. Definitely taste the alcohol. Really had to search for the hops. Unless I'm missing something, I had this in a bottle here in Georgia."
"Overall a very interesting and extremelt complex beer. Relatively easy to drink considering the strong esters and robust ABV."
"1015"
"Let's try again."
"Overall impression is that this is a wonderful beer. Got to try this next to the American-brewed version at the German beer fest and that first impression found me thinking that this version was more balanced and rich than the one brewed here, but i'll have to try a bottle to justify that claim. So, this tastes, smells, and looks like grapefruit all over to me. It also, in the look, mouthfeel, taste, and smell, has something carnal to it. I dare say while it doesn't smell or taste really ""musky"" i almost chose that term due to the deep nature of this beer. Definately recommended!"
"The appearance had me hopeful. The aroma had me excited. Then along came the flavor and disappointment followed. The weisse wheat and esters don't seem to mesh with the edgy, raw hops so you get good ingredients adding up to a deflated whole. The ABV is not to be ignored, and I wonder if it's worth it. But hey, keep collaborating. The next one might be a keeper."
"Worth seeking out if you like hefes, or weizenbocks. Although its a bit light on malt/sweetness for a weizenbock, its is an excellent hoppenweizenhofbock"
"Drinkability: A nice collaborative effort. The high alcohol makes it hard to score this one higher. Enjoyable, refreshing brew for it's strength."
"Drinkability- At first I thought I could finish a pint of this no problem, but as it went on the beer got more and more bitter with those hops. The bitterness eventually took over and knocked down the old drinkability factor."
"Full points for originality here, but I just don't like this. It's virtually undrinkable for me."
"With the massive, creamy flavor, and the low carbonation this beer is insanely drinkable. My only hope is that this colaboration continues into the future."
"Massive, rocky, creamy head that resembles a root beer float. Practically hangs off the side of the glass. Wonderful. However, I'm deducting points for the murky color that looks like a coppery dish water. Something seems off on that one. Traditional clove and bubblegum come to the nose first, but with a bit of lemon peel. There also seems to be a bit of saltine cracker malt in there. Not a bad nose at all. Taste is something altogether different: its a more assertive, crisp weissebier with some playful carbonation and tingly hops that really present themselves in the middle. The hop blast dissipates quickly and gives way to the sweet banana close. As the beer warms, there is a bit of tangerine in the middle. Interesting. I'm not huge on weiseebier style, but this is an exception. I would have this again. A nice hybrid brew."
"Poured at Waterfront Ale 'ouse on 30th and 2nd Ave a frothy 2 finger head, left a sliver afterward with plenty of legs. Cloudy yellow with banana accents followed by the tartness of the hops. I am glad to have quafed this before it goes out of style. Much thinner body than i expected but the Schneider is more powerful in my opinion."
"D - 8% hefe will sneak up and get you, but it goes down like your favorite IPA or hefe would any other time"
"A flavorful weizenbock showcasing citrus flavors with a pleasant hop profile. A nice take on the style between two classic breweries."
"Drinkability: an enjoyable and interestingly hopped up brew that is a slow sipper."
"Wow. What a good way to utterly compromise a classic. Take a great classic hefe-weizen from a noteworthy and classic producer, and then let American ""ingenuity"" enter the picture, and there you wind up with a dubious result. The beer poured a dishwater khaki, and while the smell was intriguing - more clove phenols than original Schneider-Weiss normally has, but with a little hop citrus - the flavor was another story. The hops played an annoying younger brother trying to hassle his older brother as he attempts to hold a mature conversation with a beautiful woman. Garret's contribution distracted and detracted from the otherwise sublime brilliance known as Schneider-Weiss."
"Medium bodied, good carbonation. Slight drying in the aftertaste, but bitterness is kept in check. Very enjoyable. This would be really good on-tap, I bet."
"Drinkability: The flavors work well together, but it's a touch strong."
"Overall it's nicely done, but this is a fairly special beer. It may in fact create it's own category. Not for the faint of heart, this is basically an unrestrained weizen!!! Proceed with caution!"
"Man, I wish it were the beginning of summer rather than autumn. This would have been a regular buy for the past few months. As it is, I can still find them on the shelves and would like to pick up another or two before they're gone."
"After reading a lot about this collaborative brewing project I was very excited to give this beer a go, it didn't even come close to living up the hype, a much more interesting story than drink"
"The flavor was the same. Bier was a little chewy for the style. One was enough for me."
"Poured a semi-opaque medium gold color, almost like an apple cider. Thin, off-white head and spotty lacing in the glassware. The nose is surprisingly hoppy up front with wheat malt accents all the way through. Both herbal and fruity notes abound here - banana and sour citrus. The palate threw me for a loop - is this a hefeweizen or is this an IPA? Perhaps it's both. By far, the most hop-dominant hefe I've ever sampled, but as assertive as the hops are here the beer yields to a more balanced wheat character that is true of a Bavarian hefeweizen. The sweet malt and the floral hops play off of each other quite well here, making for a very complex and unusual palate. The mouthfeel is rather thick, but off-set by the astringency of the hops leaving a dry finish with lingering herbal notes and spice. What a beer. A very unusual combination of flavors going on here ... like a highly hopped pale ale infused with a Bavarian Hefe. This is a classification challenging beer all the way. All in all, it works for me."
"Personally, I am not a regular fan of wheat, even though when I consume one, I want it to have purpose. This is very nice, and is a great spin that helps me appreciate the style. A potent blend of spice, citrus and hops. It delivers with as much zest to the tongue as it did with the nose. With each sip, I love it that much more. Clean, crisp and refreshing. The hops are present and accounted for, cleaning up after the spice. Balanced, with a heavy hand of craftsmanship. Now this, this I could see drinking with some regularity. Highly recommended."
"American wheat beers are low on my scale of favorite beers, but this is a European hefeweizen complemented by the American love of hops. I adore this beer. I have never had a hoppy wheat ale until now. Per the bottle, the hops used are of the Hallertauer Saphir variety, and they are used in a copious quantity. If you love hops, but are skeptical of wheats, give this one a try. Unfortunately, I will probably compare all future wheat beers to this one and be disappointed."
"Cheers!"
"A most enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability: I must say that I didn't expect this beer to be so impressive. This hybrid beer brings together a great marriage of aromas and flavors. It is quite flavorful and refreshing, and brings along 8.2% abv to boot. One of the best beers I've had all year. Well done."
"Overall: A nice collaboration by two great brewers but hold off on the marriage for now. The beer has a ton of promise, and with a bit of refinement I think it could be one of the best Hefe's ever made. It's a big beer no doubt about it. Big on aroma, taste, and ABV. I enjoyed drinking it and look forward to any and all future collaborations by these two brewers."
"poured into a weizen glass, this was a deep gold with a nice white head. i left the dark brown sediment in the bottle. huge aromas of bananas and tropical fruit along with a bit of spice that follows through in the taste, which is fruity and a bit sweet with a smooth and soft lingering hop bitterness. medium to full in body with a chewy and spritzy mouthfeel. this is a very nice beer, i normally ding the drinkability on stronger beers but the alcohol is very well hidden in this. dangerously drinkable, a big beer perfect for summer."
"The intense carbonation subsided, but a bit too much, and settled on the flat side. The yeast kicked up more than most hefes, making the beer much cloudier and darker than norma, resulting in a nearly opaque and dirty looking beer and greatly reducing the visual appeal (although lacing improved), and the distincive aromas and flavors melded to create some that are much less original than before. It's still a good beer, but not as good as my first impressions. All my scores get bumped down a notch."
"Pours a muddy straw that resembles apple sauce. Gynormous head that dies slow to a ring with little lacing. Smells of clove, spice and a hint of banana. Tastes sweet and full of clove, banana and spice. Full in the mouth with a sting of carbonation on the tongue. A lingering bitter/bland taste remains well after the sip. ABV is non existant. A tasty brew indeed but kind of full. Drinkability reminds me of a Bells 8000."
"and...Thank You Michael Jackson for offering me the diversity of the beers of the World. I will remember you always and will miss your gifts."
"Nice earthtones mixed with a toasted bread quality's. And then the hops come back to give a spicy finish!"
"Zum wohl!"
"This is a really big beer, not a summer slammer, but an evening sipper. It gets even better as it warms up and the flavors blend better."
"Pours a cloudy dark lemon golden yellow with a giant white foamy head that lasts forever. The smell is strong with lemon,wheat,clove,banana,and alcohol. The taste is tart with apple,pear,lemon,citrus hops,and alcohol . Not bad,but the flavors can be abit overpowering. The m/f is light and the flavors don't mix all that well. This is a summer beer,but the high alcohol kind of of kills this. This is a tough beer to drink. A high octane heffe just doesn't seem to work."
"D: It would probably be tough to have more than two, as the alcohol is quite heady. Despite that, I applaud the innovative decision to hop up a weizen."
"Second bottle much better. Also had it on tap at Eli Cannon's with the American version. Garrett Oliver was there as a guest talking about the two beers. Definetly prefer the American one. Will review at a later date."
"Definitely a unique brew from two of my favorite breweries. Not an everyday brew, but a must try for any beer lover."
"Overall: Very enjoyable. Not something I want to drink a lot of, but I am very glad I tried this one. Highly recommended for wheat beer fans and hopheads alike."
"Pours a five+ finger white head that vanishes slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy murky amber color, yeast in bottom of bottle. Medium-strong carbonation and medium bodied. Yeasty nose. Flavor is yeasty, medicinal and herbal. Lingering hoppy/tart aftertaste. Different kind of wheat beer. Higher ABV is hidden. $4.30 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"The body is fairly full. Plenty of alcohol presence and very little balance. Not nearly as drinkable as I'd hoped. Guess I'll have to stick to my own Hopfen-Weizen, or even the Doppel Hopfen Weizenbock."
"This 500 ml brown bottle was labeled with an artwork that was a hybrid of the style of the two collaborating breweries. I chose a ½ liter Wezen glass to sample this beer, and the magnificent head on the pour that was contained in the glass made me glad that I did. The body was standard pale, hazy, and bubbly Weiss beer affair, on second looks, may be a little thicker than normal. The aroma was so much more than the typical wheat beer smells of lemon, banana, bubblegum, and clove, due to the generous addition of noble hops. The phenolic spiciness typically present in wheat beer taste was similarly enhanced here with the herbal hop addition. In addition to the spices, I got a mouthful of tropical fruits like melon, pineapple, and banana, The aftertaste was tart like lemon peel and granny smith apples. Quite an authentic summer quencher, but watch out for that 8.2% ABV. A bit fuller in the mouth than the norm, making it feel slightly green. Otherwise just great the way it is."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. The higher alcohol content takes away from it a little bit, but it was definitely a good, solid brew. The alcohol may get you later on as you drink, but otherwise no big problems."
"As for drinkability, I was very impressed. This beer was quite an interesting concoction that hid its alcohol prowess rather well."
"The taste is also very unique, the hop parade rolling along. Not to say there isn't some wheat malt in there, some clove, pepper, banana, but its a load of citrus. (is that grapefruit I'm tasting in my hefe?) Its kind of weird in a hefeweizen, but its pretty neat, too. When Joe my beer guy told me about this one, I had two simultaneous reactions. 1) No friggin way, never going to work; 2) I have to try it! And what do ya know, it worked out pretty damn well! The mouth is halfway between medium and full, the carbonation pretty solid, and all in all, it is in fact refreshing, inventive, traditional in a way, and quite good."
"D - Alcohol is extremely well hidden. A very nice joint effort."
"Ask yourself three vital questions before indulging in this beer. Are you a fan of Schneider Weisse beers? Are you a fan of hops being profiled in any beer style? Have you enjoyed any of the other Garrett Oliver projects, such as Blast? If so, this will be a pleasant surprise on all levels. If not, it will be an adventure for your taste buds that they most likely havent been through before. Personally, pour me another!"
"Good body, with a nice amount of carbonation. Great idea, but not clean enough for me. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Got a bottle of this at City Wide downtown in South Bend. Wheaty in color: orange and very cloudy. served it ""mit hefe"". puffy yellowish-white head. Yeast creates sworls in the glass. looks pretty crazy actually. Smells like lemony hops, sweet and fragrant. Reminds me of gumballhead b/c of the hint of wheat mixed with hops. Very interesting flavor. Bananas, citrus (lemons). Flavors are slightly unbalanced, with the hops and malt and wheat flavors all sort of fighting each other off. Still, its an interesting taste. Medium bodied, i think i'd like it lighter. Lemon flavor gets stronger as you drink and it becomes slightly distracting. Overall, its an interesting beer but i dont know if its one of my favorites. Still, thanks to Dan at City WIde for pointing it out to me. A very special beer to have had the opportunity to try."
"I was surprised to hear that Brooklyn was working with Schneider Weiss to brew something. This beer (poured into a Erdinger glass) was an opaque light brown, certainly darker than most hefeweizens I have encountered. Two fingers worth of white heading also show great retention. Aroma was a bit dry, with hops, and a very powerful lemon/orange presence. Taste has plenty of wheat and tiny citrus flavors going on at the same time. The big surprise is at the end when the hops make themselves known. It ends with a hop bight that numbs the palate slightly.This was an especially interesting wheat beer for me by the sheer fact that the hops had been used in excess compared to others I have tried. This beer is pretty medium in body. I have to say that this is one of the most interesting beers I have tasted in a while. 99% of the time I think the German examples of this style blow the American ones out of the water. With the marriage of these two breweries for this beer, I almost feel that they have given their own spin on the style. Also, if there was any brewery to work with Schneider Weiss, Brooklyn was a more than appropriate choice. Cheers"
"Great job blending German and American characteristics."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/08/beer-othe-moment-brooklyner-schneider.html"
"Brooklyner & Schneider Hopfen-Weisse pours a ruddy orange with a thick white head from a brown, sleek, European style 500 ml bottle. There is a little bit of citrus, a little bit of wheat and some hops in the aroma. This beer seems like a bit of a style bender, there are relatively aggressive hop flavors that I wouldn't expect in a typical hefe and citrus flavors which I would expect. There is a little taste of wheat toward the end. This beer pushes the boundaries, and I think it's a pretty good beer."
"Although Im not a huge hefeweisse fan this beer was well worth seeking out."
"I wonder if they used the typical Schneider hefe yeast in this one. An interesting melding of two brewing traditions. I'm not sure if I would want to make a night of it."
"Overall a tasty beer and a bit unique with its level of hoppiness, especially in the aroma. Good stuff and worth a try."
"This is no doubt a good beer with an excellent aroma but (and I'm not a brewmaster such as the two who got together to brew this so take this with a grain of salt) to me this beer could use a little tweaking and it could be a great treat. I probably would buy again cause it is enjoyable and unique but like I said, one at a time is enough for me."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, but maybe just a tad high in abv to be sessionable. Also, this is listed here as a Hefe-Weizen, but I believe it would be more accurately be listed a Weizenbock."
"Interesting as a one-off. Strange...and while I normally love hoppy beers, this one went in too many directions. Style is out of the question...As a unique brew? Sorry - love both breweries (and both HW'S), this one just doesn't work so well, IMO."
"An interesting collaberation to be sure and exquisitely crafted. Personally, I just don't care a great deal for such an aggressively hopped German Hefe."
"I guess my biggest editorial comment on this beer would be- if you want the ombastic hops of an imperial IPA, or greener more citrusy hops, then go drink an IPA. You have to look at it as more than just the sum of two parts."
"This is a serious weizen; very strong flavored. The label calls it a ""pale weissbock"" and I'm inclined to agree...much closer to that than a hefe. Rich and fruity with a lupulin kick. Glad I got to try it."
"Great summer delight."
"Served slightly chilled in a weizen glass, from a 500ml brown bottle. Poured a murky, orange brown color. A strong two finger , bright white head formed, and was in no rush to fade away. Left tons of sticky, thick lace all over the glass. Aromas of orange peel, lemon, yeast, mild hop tones, and wheat were strong in the nose. A little bit of clove and spice were noticed in the background as well. Flavor was a bit of the same. Sweet orange flavor right off the bat, followed by lemon zest, a mild German style hoppiness, wheat, and just a tiny bit of the 8.2 percent alcohol shows itself. Finishes smooth, fruity, clean, and refreshing. Somewhat thin in the mouth but very well carbonated. Nice clean, refreshing, great tasting beer. Drinkability is great."
"This is a damn fine beer. Alcohol shows through a little for the style but otherwise things can't get much better. Bubblegum galore with clove at the forefront. Nice bitterness, very floral on the mid palate and finish. Fruity as hell but hard to specify. Just one of those beers that seems to be right. I like it."
"Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a weizen glass, the deeply muddled and large frothy head swirled into coherence slowly. Beautiful golden color, hazy as a frosted shower door, I gazed hard at the glass watching the carbonation do its magic. There is a definite German hop aroma thing going, and it is fruity and clean, then smells fresh and strong of spices as well. Thin on the palate and immediately refreshing, this beer begs for a long satisfying drink, and I readily complied. I could taste only a fraction of sweetness and some alcoholic heat, but not too much. At 8.2%, I think the balance of flavors holds up well, but had to remind myself that this wasn't my average hefe."
"My, all my... what a surprise and a welcome breath of fresh air. Perfect for the summer season. A dry-hopped, high-quality Hefeweizen. Hans Drexler and Garret Oliver combines to make a beer steeped in German traditions, yet agressively hopped the American way. The beer opens with a less desirable dirty appearance, but hold a terrific foam stand, with soft, subtle carbonation. Big estery aromas of clove, tropical fruits (banannas, pineapples, grapefruit and lemons), spicy, peppery, and an abundance of grassy hop aroma. The aromas continue past the fresh fruits and spices with a Weizen-Bock 'dirty' or 'muddled' aroma, yet dominated by German hops. The taste continues with the soft, confectionate wheat malt / barley malt sweetness, followed by estery spiciness and fruitiness, and compounded further with high hop flavor. The bitterness stays in check with less hop 'bite' and more of a wheat-malt pillow for the clove, bananna, and fruits. Finishes fruity, spicy, and malty. Not the cleanest of all beers, despite the hop dryness late. Though the beer has some complex earthy notes that linger a bit further than they need to, this is a highly creative brew with all of the nuances of a classic Dunkel-Weiss, but with an IPA-dry hop punch. Very clever guys. Make sure you keep us guessing. I'm going to drink a lot more of this beer this summer."
"D- Much more different to what i expected, ill be interested to see if anyone else got such an overpowering spice aroma! Would like to try again!"
"500 ml bottle. This beer pours a hazy deep dirty straw blond color with a massive glistening head that settles out slowly. There is little carbonation in the brew after pouring. The nose on this one is intense in herbal and grassy noble hop. This sits over a creamy wheat bolstered by light banana. This one is certainly dominated by the noble hopping in there. It is definitely interesting as far as hefes go. Taking a sip, I find a more subdued hop character. The initial flavor is grassy and herbal, but this moves quickly to light banana and creamy wheat with a more mild spicy clove as well. It finishes with a reprisal of herbal hop and a moderate bitterness. This lives up to the name hoppen-weisse. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with a mild carbonation. It is very filling. I'm a little torn on this brew. I have come to really enjoy the noble hop flavors and aromas, but my first love in beer was a nice juicy hefe with fruit and spice pouring out of it, so though I enjoy both major components of this brew, I'm not sure they are working in synergy. This is like a tryst between a really good bohemian pilsner and a hefe."
"Overall, I don't dislike this beer but I was hoping for so much more from the alliance of the two German-American brewing greats."
"This beer really could have *been* something, but it just ain't. It wants to be some high alcohol, low taste, high hop junk like Belgium is pooping out right now. Germany ought be a step above that."
"I wasn't thrilled, as you might be able to guess. I'm hoping that the Brooklyn version will be better."
"D- This beer has a great balance of crisp green hops and mild wiezen characteristics that really work well together. This is a great session beer with good balance."
"All in all, this is the best new beer I had this weekend. If you see it, I recommend you raid the shelf."
"Very nice and extremely drinkable, I will probably buy everything on the shelf. If a German wheat beer had its way with a Belgian pale ale, this is what the offspring would turn out as."
"Overall, a damn fine beer, from two brewers that I truly respect. Very interesting twist on a fantastic style. Well worth the $4 a bottle, and I'll be buying it again. Worth trying and seeking out!"
"Starts out bold, wheaty with a hoppy bite, citrusy in the finish. Dry resinous aftertaste. Traditional Hefe character is overshadowed by the liberal hopping a little bit. Some astringency that builds quickly if you gulp it. Not much banana/clove action. Smooth, wheaty on the palate, full but never overwhelming. Feels fairly traditional in that respect. Drinkability is good, perfect for the summertime."
"The beer pours a hazy amber/brown color with about an inch and a half frothy head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is OK. Nice aroma of clove, banana, pepper and lemon. Flavor is spicy, mostly cloves and pepper, but also some banana, yeast and lemon. Finishes with a tangy taste. Mouthfeel is medium and very carbonated. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and is nice to drink. The alcohol is well hidden, but hits you later. Not quite your normal hefe, but I'm not complaining at all. I liked this brew a lot, and would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others."
"Poured into a belgian snifter, the Hopfen-Weisse appears an opaque golden amber color (more gold than amber) with a nice frothy head that hold together tightly and lingers for a long while. Nice lace retention as the beer recedes. Lots of carbonation. The nose here is delicious, with strong notes of malted clove, banana, lemon, smoky bubblegum, and spicey/peppery hops. The aroma here practically steals the show. The taste is smooth and easy hefeweizen up front but quickly fades into a mellow candied sweetness before finally shifting gears towards a tart and tangy spiced-up bitter finish. This beer is all over the place; it's almost too much at times, because it does require a lot of concentration to get everything, but it's worth it. The most complex hefeweizen I've ever had, for sure. The high alcohol (8.2% ABV) is masked well enough, but you do feel it pretty quickly. But overall this is what I would call a high-society hefeweizen. It challenges your senses of smell and taste like few in the style do, but you're greatly rewarded by it in the end. Seek this beer out and give 'er a try."
"Drinkability is low here because of the flavor."
"A very interesting beer and worth trying if possible. I always like to see two brewers collaborating to make something new for the beer geeks."
"Typical mid size German type bottle, has some sort of info on the rear label, but I can't make any sense of it. Got to love Brewery taking chances, working together and trying to push the friggin envelope a bit more...this offering pours very cloudy ripe apricot, with a frothy light tan head, plenty of loose head, sloppy lacing and better then moderate retention and carbonation. Yeasty, hoppy, flavorful brew. Nose of bananas, yeast, coriander, ginger. On the tongue I get notes of more of the same, also some peppery spice, mustard seeds, plenty of yeasties and german goodness. Overlay all that with a not quite subtle hoppyness, and you realize you are enjoing one of the planets more interesting and cutting edge brews. While everybody else is working on trendy wild ale/sour/lambic kinda things...Schneider and Bklyn have gone in a new and differant direction...love the result and the new ""style"""
"This one is really more of a Weissbock in terms of color, strength, and flavor. But to hell with beer styles, this one is a winner, and I'll be buying more very soon."
"Thick chewy mouthfeel. Begins spicy with mustard essence dominating the palate. This spicyness transitions into a fruity sweetness that is lead by banana. Very reminiscent of Regenboog Wostynje's, but with a new twist due to the wheat. Very intriguing, and highly drinkable, this is worth seeking out, especially at this price."
"D-Overall this is a very unique beer, quite tasty too. Not quite a hefe but good for any category. I will be on th elookout for this and it's sister brew which is due out mid august."
"This was an odd beer to find with the Brooklyn label on a German Brewery. This beer poured a very murky grey amber color and formed a huge off white foamy head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. A huge amount of carbonation is present. A heavy aroma of clove and other spices with a hint of banana and pepper. A flavor of clove, spices and some yeast and pepper. The body is medium light and the finish is sprite, yet sweet. The higher alcohol content is well hidden. That higher content pushes it out of hefe and almost more into a Belgian style. Nice experiment, but leaves the world of the Germans and enters the world of the Belgians."
"Brooklyn's quickly becoming one of my favorites. Interesting twists on the old standards. Good stuff."
"Overall, this is interesting to say the least. Fans of the style, or German beers in general, should definitely grab a bottle to try out. For others who aren't sure if they'd enjoy something so spicy, it might be better to pass."
"D- The pepper flavor makes this somewhat different, the beer, other wise seems like a good weizenbock."
"This is a very interesting beer, but I'm not really sure the hops add much or help the flavor profile. The amount of pepper in the finish is actually a bit off putting, making this not the most drinkable of beers. I'm not sure what the abv. is, but would have to guess that it's at least around 7%. A very interesting beer; I'll be curious to see what the American/Brooklyner version is like later this year."
