"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours hazy golden with a thick eggshell colored head. The head dissipates at a moderate pace. The aroma reflects expected weizenbock notes. I get some of of those banana and clove smells along with the sweet and bready malt aromas. The taste follows the nose. The wheat and barley malt offer some bready sweetness and those banana and clove flavors come out as well. The 7% ABV is well-hidden in the flavor. I pick up some of that bubblegum flavor as well. There's some mild spiciness as well. The body is medium with high carbonation. The finish is smooth and clean. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent weizenbock."

"In short, a sweetish Weizenbock with well hidden alcohol. (500 ml, BB date 10-04-2012, into tulip.)"

"M: Medium carbonation level very appropriate. Fairly low attenuation makes for pleasant viscosity."
"Mouthfeel is faintly astringent, a bit powdery, but a bit slippery for a beer this big."
"Deserves more attention."
"D: This beer is rather easy to drink for the style because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Thanks for sharing 500 ml., Radek. Fruity yeast aroma. Bannana yeast smooth texture, lots of wheat, bannana taste. Nicely carbonated. More sweet than bitter, enjoyable but a little too bannana fruity for me. Medium yellow body and lots of alce and foam."
"0.5l bottle. Pours a murky dark-orange color with a big, frothy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is wheat, yeast, caramel malts, yeast, and banana. Flavor is caramel malts, wheat, bread, cloves, banana, and yeast. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, creamy, lightly carbonated, and a little acidic. Good beer."
"Pours hazy golden with large white head, almost identical in appearance to a typical weissbier. Nose has plenty of fresh yeasty/bready aromas with banana clove as well. On the palate the wheat component comes through for a soft malty profile together with the banana clove. A little bit of extra umph and alcohol warmth are noted at the finish."
"Pours a murky dirty honey brown color with a nice fluffy off-white head, settles into a nice cap. Kind of an in-between weizenbock, not golden but not dark brown either, just dirty. The aroma is big on banana, some clove and green apple round out the smell. The taste is of banana bread or overripe bananas, nice bready wheat malt. The malt plays nicely with the yeasty flavors, has a nice spicy flavor without the drying wheat characteristic. Moderate to full body with fizzy carbonation, yet it has a smooth feel. Nice yeasty flavors, not very bock-ish, the yeast shines through in this one. A good amped up hefe."
"This is kind of oily and slick, and seems to be medium to heavy in body. Not too thick, though."
"Drinkablility: total package drinks well for price, a solid beer."
"Wheaty tang and yeasty in flavor with a well balanced flavor. Yeast notes are pleasant but light. Straightforward and enjoyable though not too enticing. Nice feel and drink, pretty solid offering."
"Pleasant all around but also a little ""short"" all around. Overall impression nice but a bit ""soda poppy."""
"Drinkability- It's hard to find a good weizenbock...make that any weizenbock. Americans need to take a stab at this style more often...anyway, if Aventinus was not at hand, this would probably be my go to per style. Quite good."
"D: Easy to drink. At 7% abv, it's right at the small limit of the style and the lightest weizenbock I've tried so far. This is not to say anything negative, but the beer is easier to drink but less complex than other weizenbocks."
"Pours the color of unfiltered apple juice with a big fluffy beige head that displays good retention. Banana smoothie aroma with some vanilla and sweet cream. Also light clove and apple. Flavor is basically identical, but with a slight touch of alcohol in the finish. Body is creamy but light, carbonation is lively. Very drinkable, a solid weizenbock."
"This will be added to my change up of beers in my stash. Never noticed this before. I don't think I'll be able to age this one it's to good all around. I've had better at a Brewpub on tap that folded because of location and I'm not sure where the brewer is now."
"Overall a good beer but I believe there are better options yet out there i.e. Aventinus and Schneider."
"D: I feel one is just enough. It was somewhat harder to down than other weizenbocks I've enjoyed. Perhaps this was because I prefer darker wheat beers or that this Hopf had a slight alcohol taste to it"
"D- This is a good wheat beer, I am not a big fan of wheat's with a very strong banana flavor but this one is very nice."
"The beer pours a cloudy orange-brown color into my weizen glass, creating a huge gush of foam on top befoe it drops to a bubbly head, then to nothing. Retention is poor on this one. Much of the aroma is compounded by a simple mixture of cider and banana. Taste is similar as well, but with a little touch of bubblegum too. It tastes strong as a weizenbock should, and it makes a pretty good palate cleanser. It also makes your head feel a little lighter too, so watch out."
"D - Pretty good. It is no Aventinus but it is an excellent and pleasant choice for a weizenbock."
"drinkable....I could drink this for a night or two and not complain...a solid beer"
"Mouthfeel is alternately smooth and prickly, due to the levels of yeast and carbonation. In the summer, it's the most sessionable weizenbock i've had. Recommended."
"Recommended. Maybe not completely a weizenbock, but it's still quite good."
"D: Rich and satisfying! The alcohol is never noticeable, but then again, it's only 7% so it really shouldn't be."
"Slightly murky and orangy body with a sizeable head, which I had wait about five minutes for it to go down before my first sip. Sweet wheaty flavor is present but generally overwhelmed by the presence of alcohol. It has a nice smooth finish, leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Very drinkable, but it's strong so if you're not a big guy you'll probably feel a buzz pretty quick."
"Drinkability  Very drinkable. You won't find to many beer drinkers who won't like this one."
"Drinkability/Overall: certainly a tightly made weizenbock, but uninspiring overall, especially in comparison to some of the other we've recently tried in the style."
"Not all wiezenbocks are equal, lucky thing that Aventinus is the easy one to find everywhere."
"Drinkability  This is not a fluffy full weizeny bock. It will go down schnell and leave you tipsy in a minute. My kind of beer  hehe."

"Mouthfeel- A nice light, carbonated but noticeaably alcoholic weiss beer. Condusive for a dark meat roast with some onions."
"Aventinus and John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt ain't sweating. In fact, they're not even paying the scantest attention."
"Drinkability: If Aventinus is the good china of weizenbock, this is your Tuesday night paper plate variety. Ironically, I almost prefer it to the saturated A-bomb, but in the end, it's a solid session beer."
"The emerges from the 500ml brown bottle translucent golden amber color with the head masterful in size, frothy in texture and the color a winsome light tan, after its erosion, the resultant lace forms a thin veil to cover the glass. Nose is lightly toasted wheat, sweet and fresh, hints of cloves and bananas, start is quite sweet with a nice malt presence and the top feel light to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops light in their spiciness, very dry and a drinkable beer."
"Not bad at all. I was impressed with each of the Hopf beers, though this one comes in last out of the three. Still, it's a beer that is easily consumed, and solid all-around. I'll be coming back to these for my next weiss fix."
"Overall: Cost $2.59 for the bottle, as indeed did all three of the Hopfs I picked up recently. Another tasty brew from Weissbierbrauerei Hopf, a fine Weizenbock."
"Nice drinkable brew, almost a dessert beer."
"This my first beer entry in this log but I am a seasoned beer drinker except for german beers which i why I wanted to start with this one. There are those beers that let you taste them before you take a sip. This one had a great nose of bananas and warm bread. The taste does not disappoint. It is refreshing and flavorful-great with Thanksgiving leftovers, It also has a nice warming effect on the upper chest-perfect for a rainy day. As it warms, the sweetness is a bit much but a nice beer. Not sure what appearance means so that is tough to rate."
"When poured, the color was a hazy golden amber, with a medium amout of foam and not much lace. The smell of spicy cloves filled the nose along with a wheat aroma. The taste was of wheat and cloves with a hint of caramel and kind of dry on the palate."
"A very tasty brew, very easy to drink. Almost too easy as it disappeared so fast the sneaky-high ABV blindsided me. A good example of the style"
"Medium gold brown color. Large head. Aroma is spicy apples and some malt. A medium bodied weizen bock. Spicy and fruity, apples, banana and cloves. Light and refreshing. Malts and hops are mild. Not as spicy as a lot of weizen bocks. Hides the 7% alcohol very well. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is soft, full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"After being disappointed with my first Hopf brew, I was pleasantly surprised by the Bock. It pours golden brown with a foamy white head that fades but leaves bubbles around the edge of the glass. The smell is a nice combination of fruit and spice, with just a hint of black licorice. The taste is certainly on the mild side, but it's by no means bland. Fruit and spice also dominate the taste and the 7% alcohol is nicely hidden. It has a nice mouthfeel and is frighteningly drinkable."
"A nice example of the brew."
