"2.94/5: I'm certainly left frigid over this one"

"O - I was anticipating something different based on the smell and appearance, but the hop and bitter aroma was unnoticable to me, but was not mistaken on the taste; While the dark fruits and spices may have been there, I didn't pick them up.  Overall, decent, but nothing magical."
""
"I was a little surprised on pouring this beer because I was expecting a pale ale based on the label.  What came out of the bottle was a medium brown with a smell more like a porter.  The taste also was much like a porter.  The beer was good, just not what I was expecting."

"Doesn't get anywhere near 10 below here, but hey lets give a whirl anyway!  Popping the top I get a cocoa smell with some malt in the background.  Pours to a translucent deep brown with a tan multi-bubble head that recedes quickly..  On the taste this brew hits with some chalky cocoa upfront with some earthy hops and transitions to a sweeter chocolate and toasted malt background with a spicy but clean flat bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is a little thin but with all the flavors its not an issue.  This is unbelievably a 7.4 ABV, would never guess that.  My type of brew: standout basic flavors (particularly cocoa), not complex, but very drinkable."

"Waxy, burnt taste upon sipping. Syrupy and very little carbonation. Aftertaste is a mix of chocolate and black licorice. Was hoping for a stronger fruit taste, but instead it's just spice and staleness."

"Overall- Just above average with hints of just being average. The cloying aspects mellow and make the beer more accessible but they don't make it more interesting. Possibly worth at try but I wouldn't dwell on that decision to long."

"An enjoyable sipper."

"Poured from bomber to glass. Great, dark color with a slight ruby hue. Thick, tan head and left lots of lace to decorate the glass. I didn't pick up crisp citrus aroma as listed by the brewer. It was a tad sweet with coffee/bitter aftertaste. Medium viscosity, above average essence of alcohol. I pulled it out of a fridge at 37deg but as it warmed to room temp the flavor and mouthfeel was enhanced. It was a real enjoyable beer. I'll be drinking again, for sure. A bit of discrepancy on style per the brewer's site, this one and RB. Others list as Dunkelweiss/Dunkelweizen."

"One of many ways to be happy during the colder season is to drink this winter warmer. It's....hold on....it's a weizenbock? I wouldn't have suspected."

"Great winter beer that tastes more like Jubelale than a Weizenbock. I got lots of hops and lots of malt and a very smooth luscious mouthfeel. Everything I wanted in a Winter Warmer. Will need to buy a few of these while they last . Great stuff and a little under the radar"

"O- pretty damn good. I would buy this again."
""
"I wonder if it's a actually lageredâ€“-I think Weizenbocks are supposed to be bottom-fermented(?) It tastes very similar to many Winter Warmers of the west, particularly Pyramid Snow Cap and New Belgium Snow Day. I would mistake for an ale in an instant, and also would not guess that it is a wheat beer did I not know the style. I'm an ale lover, so if it is a lager then good on ya scuttlebutt."

"Served from a large bottle into a pint glass. Pours very dark brown with light brown head which is a standard characteristic of most ""winter warmer"" ales. Had never heard of this brewing company before so was not expecting much, rightly so. Malty, cherry and coffee are the three flavors that come to mind when taking a sip. Slightly sweet. Nothing special about this brew."
""
""
""
"O: Not really feeling this beer. It's almost like a beer soda to me. I will avoid this beer in the future. If I gave it a letter grade, then I would give it a ""C"."

"Pours a dark brown body with a small tan head with decent retention. Aromas are predominantly of chocolate, with a bit of cold coffee and a hint of something being off. The taste is overwhelmingly sour and not enjoyable. Whatever notes of cocoa and spice this beer might possess are completely ruined by the green apple tartness. Reading the reviews below, I see I'm not alone in thinking this is a strange beer, and not in a good way."
""
"Overall this is a very strange beer, the sourness of a southern bavarian dunkel weiss is crossed with a chocolate malt backbone. Not recommended."
""
"Not bad but not great. Decent with meat, perhaps some braised smoked sausages."
""
""
"T: The taste started almost like a hef and then came a huge smack of black cherry sourness. Finish brings some hints of malt, faint cocoa powder and maybe even a hint of hop resin. Definitely interesting, but the flavors are a little too scattered and disjointed for me to call it good."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a cola-like brown color with a 1 1/2 finger light tan head that settles into a medium collar. I can't get a read on what kind of bubble action is going on in the darkness. Aroma is of sweet, dark berries. 1st sip is of dark fruit, but it is much drier than the aroma. Mouthfeel is light and on the watery side. Overall, a rather mediocre beer. Victory Moonglow is my benchmark for weizenbocks, and this isn't close to being in the same league."
""
""
"O: The spice character is really nice here. Don't count on a weizenbock in the traditional sense. This is a big American style dark wheat beer with some heavy spice flavour. Drink it as a winter beer and you'll like it."
""
"O - A tasty beer that I will definitely look for in the future."
""
"O: Definitely different from the other couple Weizenbock's I've had. Although this isn't a bad beer, it's definitely not great. Don't be in a hurry to grab one of these off the shelf."
"O: Pretty good overall. The alcohol is well hidden in this one. I like the roasted flavor. This isn't as comparable to the Shiner as I had hoped, so I won't compare."
"until I found out this is supposed to be a weizen bock, I was really liking this beer. It doesn't say any description on the bottle label except ""ale"". I guess they must be embarrased by the beer. It doesn't taste like a weizen bock,so I won't repeat all the other reviews listed here. However, if you didn't know what it was SUPPOSED TO BE, I would say it's not a bad drinking beer.It was located with all the seasonal winter brews at the local total wine, not with the bock's. Didn't know exactly what to expect. Not a weizen bock though. But for $1.75 a bottle, I wouldn't expect ayinger."
"Medium mouth feel and carbination 	makes the sourness stand out more. In my opinion, this is drinkable, but that's about it. A C brew for me."
"Pours an almost opaque murky brown with a 1/2 inch khaki head that fades to an oily film. Small dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, cocoa, and some cinnamon spice notes. Taste is surprisingly sour (I think there may be an issue going on with this beer). I am getting some malt, sour fruits, and weird spice flavors on the finish. This beer has a higher level of carbonation which makes the sourness somewhat worse. Overall, this is a pretty bad beer and I am pretty sure that I got a bad bottle."
""
"Altogether a heavily disappointing beer, I couldnt even finish the last couple ounces."
"O- Not a whole lot going on with this one but definitely enjoyable on a cold night in front of the fire."
""
"D: A pleasant, enjoyable weizenbock that lacks the complexity of many better options. Surprisingly malty for the style - unusual nutty and cocoa notes seem to overpower the yeasty character a bit more than I would have preferred. Straightforward, but worth a try."
"drinkability: nice smooth easy drinking dark wheat ale without the fruit flavor usually seen in german wheat ales."
"Nice enough beer, just not very special. Would not seek this one out again."
"The flavor is all about the rich, almost chocolately roasted malt. It really hit the spot for a beer to sit down with after work. My friend was also pleasantly surprised, now he has a dark beer that he can point to and say that he likes. At $3 for a bomber this is a nice little treat and I'll surely have it again."
"D- Overall, 10 Degrees Below was enjoyable but not something I would purchase again. Worth a try."
"D/O- This doesn't taste too bad and the mouthfeel is well-received by my mouth. Unfortunately the appearance seems to be the major downfall of this beer, to me anyways. Glad to have tried it, would have another down the line."
"D: I really liked their Weizen bock, I though the hopping in this just seemed weird."
"Nice lager feel for a winter warmer but a little too much hop in the wrong places. Good but not one to search for too hard."
"d - A nice weizenbock. Would try again."
"Iam drinking to the end of the Rich Rodriguez era..here here!Poured a hazed deeper russet color with one finger clingy beige head,nice retention.Aromas are pretty light,I picked up some clove-like spice mainly,maybe a little toasted wheat.Flavors are pretty light for the style as well,cocoa flavors were what stuck out most,light clove,even lighter banana.A pretty full mouthfeel and the alcohol is pretty well hidden for the most part but it lacks any real complexity."
"This brew pours a beautiful very dark brown with a ruby glow when held to the light and an off-white head. The aroma is moderately malty, some roast, a bit of booze, chocolate, and a little yeastness. The flavor is a bit tart upfront, some chocolate and roast, even some citrus. The beer finishes smooth with a bit of warmth, and a nice lingering malt. The carbonation is medium and body medium-full. Overall this is flavorful brew and would recommend."
"Overall an average beer with no real faults. Just not real memorable."
"A really nice beer and very unique. I think of Weizenbocks having lots of banana and clove like flavors while this had a lot of complexity. Love the rum undercurrent and the chocolate in the finish, really is great as a winter warmer. A real treat and a great surprise, highly recommend."
"- Rather drinkable, and hides any sign of alcohol extremely well. Tasty, balanced, unique, and certainly good. I bet this would be even better on tap."
"Casual, quaffable, and smooth with a distant smokiness."
"UPDATE 12/03/2009: I purchased a 6-pack from local grocery and have to agree with the lower grade reviews... out of the bottle the beer did not taste the same! It reminded me too much of a porter and did not have the character it does out of the keg. I suspect the 6-pack was fairly old and hope to dry a bomber from one of the local beer stores soon."
"taste is creamy, spice, milk chocolate, a little coffee, malt, toasted nuts, a little caramel, and way in the back sits a prune."
"It pours a dark brown opaque color that is almost brown. It has the thinnest head I have ever seen on a beer and I sloshed it just to beef up the head. I does however have a nice tan and tight lace. The flavor is reminiscent of a watered down porter. It is roasty and wood like. It has a mild chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall it is not bad."
"Drinkability is exceptional, a really nice little Weizenbock for sure. Smoot and damn tasty, a good looker, really no flaws, and to add on all that, a pretty decent price at $5.49 a bomber, from a specialty shop no less, it disappeared before I knew what happened. While this is honestly a style I very rarely get around to drinking for whatever reason, I can't say that I'd look for anything more then I found here."
"Poured into 11oz. version of Imperial Pint glass. Poured just short of black color, with a tall deep tan head that dissipated quickly leaving little to no lacing. Slight biscuity aroma. Flavor delivers a gentle spice flavor with the malty base. Full, pleasing body as is usual for the style. Nicely drinkable. I would drink this on tap at the local. Another good job from a solid, but not spectacular brewery."
"7/4/7/3/15/3.6"
"An acceptable entry into the winter warmer category, one that I'm glad I tried, but not one to quest for. If it were on-tap at a local and decently priced, I might have a couple, but that's about it."
"D: I don't get this as a ""dunkel weisse"". As a winter warmer it could stand to turn up the heat. However, it was a smooth and easy beer to consume. Decent session beer."
"A satisfactory brew, but probably not the best winter warmer around. Still it is quite drinkable, the flavors are not overpowering, and it's probably sessionable if you can get past the ABV."
"Pours a chestnut brown with about an inch of creamy, light tan head. Aroma of lightly roasted malt and a sweet nutty character. Palate is sweet light and caramel malts, with a touch of roastiness. A light bready character gives way to a more nutty flavor before the swallow and continues until the end. A touch of brown sugar and plum are detectable on the finish. Body is creamy but a bit light and thin. Overall, a little sweeter than I like in a winter warmer, but still an enjoyable beer."
