4.21,8.2,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"for a dark wheat lager from germany, this is about as good as it can get. it is everything it says it is, and more. for me, i cant really see the style improving much, and like all the plank beers, its quality is simply astounding and well ahead of its peers. this pours a charcoal tinted brown color, with some yeast sediment and a rapidly rising milkshake thick khaki tan head that never relents. the nose is that banana clove hefe yeast, with some really roasty wheat malt that stays light and doesnt go bitter, as well as a clean bready lager yeast. interesting yeast combination here, very german, but also quite unique. the flavor starts with the dark grain and moves into a slightly boozy malty middle, a little sweeter than the start. it moves through banana bread, bran muffin, and campfire smoke, before returning to a relatively clean and tidy lager finish. impressively complex, not overdone, just clever and traditional at the same time. frothy and fluffy feeling, aside from a slight alcohol burn, this beer is gentle all the way through. carbonation is just active enough, and the beer opens up a whole lot as it warms too. the thing that amazes me as much as how good this is, is how cheap it is. i need to start buying this stuff a lot more frequently!","StonedTrippin","Jun 23, 2014"

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, unknown bottle code. Pours very hazy/murky dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger moderately dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, grape, apple, raisin, caramel, toast, brown bread, wheat, molasses, light clove, light banana, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, apple, grape, raisin, caramel, brown bread, wheat, molasses, toast, light banana, clove, herbal, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Light wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, brown bread, wheat, molasses, toast, clove, light banana, herbal, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt flavors with yeast fruitiness; with a nice malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent weizenbock. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

4.38,12.6,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,"You get the sweetness of bubblegum with some banana but also lots of deep roasted malts in the back. At first, I get the typical Weizen flavor, the super-duper sweetness of the Weizen yeast, but it's far more complex than that. I get black or chocolate malts, some coffee hints with full on Doppelbock-ness of the malt, maybe roasted barley. It's highly roasted, whatever the malt. If you let the beer bypass the front of your tongue, you taste the roasted barley full on. Bitterness is there, not pronounced, but noticeable in the very back of the tongue. I find it's a shame the Weizen yeast is so overpowering, for it almost masks these wonderful flavors. I'm not a huge fan of the bubblegummy Wiezens, I prefer a Kristalweizen with more lemony notes, but this one is not bad at all.","boddhitree","Apr 07, 2013"

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, the carbonation was to fizzy, and the flavors didn't hold my attention like they should, one of these 500ml bottle's is enough for me. What I like most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and it had all the aromas that I come to expect from this style. What I liked least about this beer was that the taste didn't live up to the aroma and that the carbonation was way to high and fizzy, it just didn't work with this beer. I don't think I would buy this beer again unless I really wanted a Weizenbock and couldn't find a better one, it's worth a try but don't expect it to knock your socks off. This was my first beer from this brewery and it made for an ok first impression, I would be down to try more of their beer, but I can't say that I was overall impressed with this beer, they were too many flaws to make it my favorite. Wally's Weizenbock from Black Forest is still my favorite of the style, it's such a damn good beer and it blows this beer out of the water.","StoutHunter","May 21, 2012"

Anywho, this one adds some bake caramel and chocolate. Rich taste. Nutmeg is more apparent here and the banana melds into dark chocolate. Sweet roasted malt and spicy end, although somewhat light.

Aroma has a nice dark toasted malt tone with raisin and tart apples, very nice spiciness about it as well. Flavor was banana bread with a layered charred malt character adding a touch of smokiness, with a caramelized malt finish. Mouthfeel was medium to fuller bodied alcohol was evident but not overpowering in anyway. Overall drinkability was great another excellent German wheat beer served properly in a hefeweizen glass, my kind of weizenbock this competes or beats Ayinger's version.","WVbeergeek","May 20, 2011"
2.72,-30.1,2,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"From a 500 mL stubby German bottle with no freshness date. Pours a clear mahogany, with violent levels of carbonation - possibly the most visibly carbonated beer I've ever seen - and a huge, noisy head that doesn't retain well. Loads of yeast at the bottom of the bottle turns the beer muddy and quite ugly. Smells doughy and yeasty, malty, fruity and vinous, with perhaps some hops. Fairly similar on the palate, with a light sweetness, mild bitterness, and a fairly prevalent note of acetone or ethyl acetate. It is fairly full and dry, and, despite its appearance, has a surprisingly low level of carbonation. Not an unpleasant beer, but it does have noticeable faults and perhaps some age on it. I imagine it would be better on the other side of the Atlantic.","mmmbeer","May 10, 2011"

On the other hand I do like how drinkable this is and how nice the dry, yet rich malt character is.","Gueuzedude","Jul 17, 2008"
4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured into a weizen glass a clouded mahogany brown with a little amber-like tinge to it,a big blooming off white head atop.Aromas are of green apple and clove mainly,a little banana shows thru as well,flavors are a good mix of dark fruit and a slight puckering green apple with some underlying chocolate and clove, medium to full makes the flavors seem fuller.A solid weizenbock here it has rich flavors and a nice feel,Plank makes some good beers in the general style.","oberon","Jul 09, 2008"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, crystal malt scent along with some wheat and fruit esters. It has minimal banana/clove character. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, crystal and wheat malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes dry with a mild yeastiness. It's not a powerful beer, yet it weighs in at 7.5% abv.. The hefe character is present as well as the lager dryness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's complex and flavorful, as well as true to style.","WesWes","Jul 03, 2008"
2.78,-28.5,4,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Wickedly aggressive carbonation that explodes like dynamite across the mouth. Piranha-like microbites sizzle the tongue while the beer expands in a gaseous, belly-filling fashion. With barely a swish, this puffs the cheeks outwards and tests my pressure capacities. Strong burps ensue, punctuating a less-than-impressive Weizenbock experience. Not recommended.","yelterdow","May 28, 2008"
3.81,-2.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"pours up a dark brown with dark red edges. a nice, cream colored head. the nose is chocolate, toffee, and vanilla ice cream! that is interesting! tastes of slight alcohol spice, a slight metallic malt taste (probably due to this bottle maybe being not the freshest), dark fruits, red fruits, strawberries, dark cherries. medium bodied, low, frizzy carbo. i had a better bottle of this in Austin but oh well.","stumac","May 25, 2008"
3.13,-19.5,4.5,4,2.5,3,3,"So off balance. Glad I have a second bottle...will revise the review if that one performs significantly better. I can tell there's a great beer in here, but as of right now, I've had many better Weizenbocks. C'est la vie.","Metalmonk","May 23, 2008"

4.02,3.3,4,4.5,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel is poor due to the overdone carbonation. Very drinkable. The carbonation ruins what could be something special. The style is well suited for the transitioning seasons of winter to spring. Would pair well with pork.","Jmamay22","Mar 16, 2008"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: There's a heaviness to this brew, without the high ABV that would limit the amount one might drink this brew, but this is definitely quality over quantity.","fdrich29","Feb 17, 2008"

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice muddy brown color with a pillowy tan head that dissipated into a nice cap. The smell is of wheat malt, bananas and clove. The taste is of apples, banana and some other sweet fruit. I got a slight wave of chocolate malt but that didn't last very long. Sweeter and less dry than their hefe. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finished well balanced. A very easy to drink weizenbock, not much in the way of malty taste but very balanced and smooth.","Gmann","Dec 31, 2007"
4.05,4.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a very nice dark weizenbock beer. I first had this at the German Beer Festival in Boston and thought I would never find it again, but it is available at Elm St. Liquors in Davis Square. Another feather in their cap for what to me is the best beer store in Boston area. The beer pours cloudy, dark, not much head, and what there is is a bit on the soapy side. No lacing to speak of. The beer is moderately carbonated, medium bodied, and the smell is malt, yeast, and cooked prunes. The taste is the high point by far. There is a somewhat dryish, for a weizenbock, malty, and bready taste. The beer is amply full of yeast, and there is a prunish taste in the mid section that tails off in the finish. Some refer to this as banana, but I believe its more a full yeast flavor that is pushing things in the banana-ish direction. This is a very nice weizenbock that isn't too sweet, does not have an overly syrupy feel, and one in which the 7.5% ABV is well masked. Worth seeking out, if you can find it.

3.58,-8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This beer poured a brown color with a huge rocky head that quickly began to subside. The aroma is malty with the yeast noticeable. The taste is malty and spicy  possibly even a bit floral. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is quite noticeable. Overall, this is an easy to drink brew  not offensive, but missing a punch.","barefootbrewer","Dec 02, 2007"

3.38,-13.1,4.5,4,3,2.5,3.5,"d: misleading until i re-read the label - bavarian dunkler weizenbock. not nearly as smooth as it smelled and tartness made it less drinkable than anticipated. not the best representation of a weizenbock, but smell was weizenbock-like while the taste was too dunkler -like. overall a good beer, just doesn't rank with aventinus or some other weizenbocks i've had if you want to compare it to "straight" weizenbocks.","belgbeerdrinker","Nov 05, 2007"

Smells of black fruits, bananas, rum, malt and caramel. Taste is sweet, caramel malt with noticeable alcohol and a pruney-banana blend. Slightly yeasty. Banana flavor not overwhelming as it can be in some beers of the style. Very nice. Smooth, almost velvety. A very nice drinker. Wish we had it locally.","aforbes10","Oct 24, 2007"
4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Was pleased to see this beer on the shelves after reading the review of it in one of the BA magazines. Pours a light brown, with a rocky head that fades quickly. Smells of sweet berry, honey and alcohol come to mind for the aroma. Taste has elements of cherry, plum, and an overall wine or port presence. Mouthfeel is medium, and quite drinkable. Great example for this style. Tastes even better if you let it warm up a little bit.","jamie2dope","Sep 17, 2007"
4.12,5.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Under the cap there is a prolific cascade of gunsmoke. A pour launches foam that crests and recedes relatively quickly leaving a sheet of coffee ice cream colored foam. Banana flambee aromas focus neatly on top of cream and vanilla. A murky spine of burnt, oily bitterness swaddled in malty viscosity. Bright husk acids splash back alcohol, spice and bitter finishes.","putnam","Aug 20, 2007"
