4.08,-0.5,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"a very interesting idea here, a german wheat lager with nelson hops, has to be great right? well, it is great, but the bottle i shared was dated 2012, and i have to wonder if the one of a kind character of the nelson hops has tailed off a little bit over time. it sure seems that way, not to say the haze beige bronze colored heady beer isnt hoppy, because it is, but that tropical nelson character is pretty minimal, lost in a denser bodied strong wheat base. the bitterness is there, and so is a light lemony fruity element, but i couldnt not place it as nelson, which is concerning to me because i think its the most unmistakable hop varietal out there. love the creamy feel, the snappy finish, and the luxurious nature of the beer. prickly little bubbles lift up the malt, and the hops really do bring it alll together in the finish. its great beer, a new direction for the germans for sure, but i would love to compare this to a fresh bottle and see how it has changed over time. still awesome stuff though, just not the nelson bomb i had anticipated.","StonedTrippin","Nov 14, 2014"

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/2/2011. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big apricot, white grape, pear, apple, lemon, banana, pineapple, clove, wheat, honey, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, hops, and pale malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big apricot, white grape, pear, apple, lemon, banana, pineapple, wheat, honey, bread, clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, white grape, pear, apple, lemon, banana, pineapple, wheat, honey, bread, clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice weizenbock. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, hops, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

Classic weizen aroma of sweet wheat, bananas anc cloves, no evidence of the Nelson hopping. Flavor follows aroma, with sweet wheat, light banana and clove. Interesting light sweet fruit flavor, which I assume is from the the hops, vaguely reminiscent of a sweet white wine, although I would not have identified it as such if I had not read the bottle label. Finishes moderately dry with light fruity hops. Light bodied, but nice mouth feel from carbonation. A nice variant on a well made weizenbock. Flavors were well integrated, a bit subdued.

I suspect that the grape fruitiness I'm tasting is the Nelson Sauvin hops, but I don't know that for sure. A bit more flavorful than other Weizenbocks I've had, but I suspect part of that is due to the fact that I did not get all the yeast sediment into the glass. I've found far more often than not that if too much of the sediment comes into the glass, everything gets muddled and dominated by the yeast. In this case, the yeast was pretty well caked onto the bottom of the bottle (had to really shake it when rinsing it out) so I think the fact that the yeast didn't come along in the pour really helped me taste this beer and the unique hops put into it. So overall, a very drinkable beer (wishing I had more right now) and quite interesting, but due to the cost, it's more of a special occasion beer. The special hops really do come through, but I think only because most of the yeast stayed behind. Had the yeast come through I think I would have missed all the aroma and flavor like some of the other reviews suggest. Therefore I can say that this is a good beer. Not amazing, but definitely good if you leave the yeast sediment behind.","damndirtyape","Apr 14, 2012"

Beautiful golden yellow, not quite orange cloudy pour with a huge three finger snow white head with great retention and crazy lacing. The nose is typical Weizen with lots of clove, banana, and pineapple. But for me, the Nelson Sauvin made it stand apart in a subtle and pleasant way. The hops are definitely there, but not as in-your-face as I've experienced in the past with other styles brewed with Nelson Sauvin. The same is true in the taste with the standard hints of clove and banana, but there's more of a fruity flowery and subtle vinous tinge to this beer. I have to believe it's the Nelson Sauvin that make this so unique. I've lived in Germany for 11 years and never been a Weizen fan, but this beer is so much different than the typical German Weizen. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice slightly dry, refreshing finish. Still not a Weizen fan, but I would definitely revisit this beer if the price tag would come down a bit...","beerdrifter","Mar 25, 2012"

The flavor starts out nicely, with a little bit of bready sweetness fading into some clove notes. The hops on the back end are a little out of whack though, as the bitterness is a bit too pronounced compared to the somewhat lackluster citrus/fruity finish that doesn't live up to the nose on this beer.
