I am thinking it smells like slightly higher quality cured meat, but smoky, salty, and fleshy for sure. now that I think of it, it smells a lot like the cured beef I ate in bosnia all summer last year. nothing about this tells me its beer. the flavor is also particularly wholesome, protein is evident here, salty again too. really just downright meaty, I don't get anything as far as malt or hops or yeast, maybe some lazy lager yeast on the back end, and some alcohol, but this is a miss on just about all counts. I don't dislike it, but the flavor is a far cry from the style guidelines, and it just really doesn't work for me. fall notes, but that's too little too late that its seasonally appropriate, this is a mess all over the place. so many left hand bombers have been, but I appreciate the spirit of experimentation that courses through most of them. skip this, if its even still around...","StonedTrippin","Jul 05, 2013"

Smell is where this shines for me, Smoke smoke smoke, this is a rauchbier. Their is also a black tea and soy sauce smell integrated nicely with the strong smokiness. Taste is soy sauce, moderate smoke, mild sweetness, and light black tea flavors, nice. This was a unique yet well executed project by lefthand and the age has helped this beer.","tjmodica","May 08, 2013"

Flavor's like nose, carbonic tang is up front, followed by smokey sweet, and some tart, followed by some bitter in the finish. Body is ok, carbonation is a bit fizzy.

3.45,5.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Overall interesting to try, but not one I would probably buy again. It has some interesting flavors, nice tea like and the smoke starts nice but gets a bit overwhelming. The biggest problem with the beer is that the beer itself, malts etc, play a background role in this beer. It's more about the smoke and tea than weizen-doppelbock at all, for which the flavors are very subtle and hard to get to behind the heavy smoke and tea. I like the idea, but please tone those components down a bit and try again. The tannins start to get a bit heavy and combine with the smoked, char, and bitterness to bring a slightly unpleasant feel as well.","jlindros","Nov 15, 2011"

Leather, smoke, burnt tar. Not a good combination. The taste was overwhelming fake Liquid Smoke to me. I couldn't get passed the leather, burnt soy sauce, fake liquid smoke taste of this beer.

Poured into a pint glass, the color is a deep dark brown, looks like bog water. Initially presents with a deep beige head but that quickly faded leaving just a light film on top. Smell is hard to pin down. Definitely some smoke, with a hint of soy sauce, and tea leaves. On tasting this beer my taste buds were just as confused as my nose had been. The smokey flavor is just off. Rather than getting that great smoke campfire quality that elicits fond memories of camping with friends/family, I get a smoke quality of cheap cigar ash that has been left out a long time. Their is a soy sauce thing in the taste as well, but its like it had been left in the sauce pan and got burnt. The tea aspects on this beer create this background flavor that seems like dark fruit that is past its time. The mouthfeel doesn't help because the carbonation seems low, making this a thicker mess to have to get down. Overall I was really disappointed in this beer. I know Left Hand can make a good beer with smokey elements because I really enjoyed their Fade to Black vol 2 porter. This one just didn't work.","smokeypeat","Jul 11, 2011"

Moderate roasted malt, wet wood and horrible smoke aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and light carbonation. Medium smoked sweet flavor with a medium smooth sweet finish.

3.38,3.7,4.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Watching opening day baseball with a few beers,hopefully the Tigers can get a win against the f###g Yankees.Poured into my Aventinus glass a cloudy,hazy russett color with a large fluffy beige colored head.The tea really stands out in the nose along wich spiced,smokey phenols,not over done in my mind.A little light and sharp in the mouth,smoke and phenols dominate the flavors,quite spicy and yeasty,the smoke seems to be a little off.The beer started out promising but did fizzle out a little when came to flavor and feel,I think its a little heavy handed in the yeast department,the tea didnt play a big role on the palate for me until the beer warmed a little and it didnt really cut thru the phenols.Bottled on 2/11/11.","oberon","Mar 27, 2011"

1.91,-41.4,1.5,3,1.5,2,1.5,"I love Left Hand Brewery. I love there smoked line up. They make some of my favorite beer. This, however, is a train wreck. Murky brown color with almost no head. It looks like shit water, seriously. The aroma is the only saving grace. Love the smoke notes. Reminded me of oak smoke. Flavor was unexpectedly smokey and dominant. Caught some tea notes, especially on the end. Didn't get anything else. There is a lot of flavor in there but it's a train wreck. I'm sure some will laud over it's complexity but this is not complex, this is an ambush of flavor. Left Hand is better than this!","JohnnyWong","Beers"
