After being in the fridge for two years, much of the hop profile is gone though there is a strong bitterness left in the finish. Some cloves and bananas up front.

5,48.4,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer was terrific. Wild, but terrific. The description is apt. Its a german hefe meets an IPA. In the nose, a crazy combination of citrusy hops battle with the clove-type smells of hefe yeast. Its a wild combo. The beer is TOTALLY unfiltered, so the mouthfeel is extremely rich, creamy and satisfying. The hops and are very prominent on the front, then the yeast flavors (banana, etc.) come out strong at the end. Its a roller coaster. My only complaint is the richness of the mouthfeel i think does interfere a bit with the other flavors. But otherwise, a really fun beer.","berliner07","Oct 23, 2011"

At a very good temperature it poured with a grand off-white, thick, foamy, frothy, billowy head that lasts a long time and some lace. Color is a hazy, apricot amber with particulates and a few tiny bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, banana, clove, orange, malt, hop. Flavor is similar to nose with some pine and grapefruit along with carbonic tang. Body is a little soft and yet just right for this hybrid. Finish is like flavor and of average length, ending with a little sweetness at very last. Excellent beer!","drpimento","0"

It has a nice mix of hefe yeast esters and bitter hop aroma. It's sweet and fruity with some subtle banana/clove character. The taste is decent. It has a good hefe flavor; pale and wheat malts, fruity yeast esters. The hop character adds a good deal of bitterness, which seems to muttle the flavor, but it's still quite tasty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting beer. It's half hefe, half IPA.

Flavor has a more controlled yeast spice with more of the wheat and banana coming through. Some pine resin finishes leaving a slight bitterness. Earthy and pine hops played a bigger role than expected because I really didn't get any in the nose. Light body with large flavor, crisp and carbonated.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 02, 2011"
4.03,19.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A touch of toasty malt sweetness is evident at the start, with subtle banana joining in. Far and away the leading flavor is rindy, pithy, puckery hops, with the clove and banana very restrained. Dry and crisp at the finish, the rindy character really stands out. Interesting offering. I assumed it was an amped-up hefe, and not something like Schneider-Brooklyner... Near the end I swirled in all the bottle sediment, which really clouded things up.

3.3,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D - This one starts out very promising with an excellent, bright and peppery aroma of hops and spices. The flavor profile, unfortunately fails miserably in its attempt to live up to the promise of the aroma. The spicy notes have become an overwhelming and medicinal phenolic yeast character that just overwhelms everything else. If that weren't enough, the bitterness is excessive and pithy; to the point that it would seem harsh in a DIPA, let alone a beer like this. I am always a bit skeptical of Imperialized versions of wheat beers and lagers, but I have had so many surprisingly good beers from Peak that I though this one just might be one of the rare exceptions. Sadly, it was not.","Robtobfest","Jul 10, 2011"

2.1,-37.7,4,1.5,2,3,2,"Pours a really clear deep golden color with a huge bubbly white head that sticks around forever. Smells of clove and allspice with hints of banana. There's lots of spicy yeast esters and a bit of lemon in this one and I heard tell there's some malt in here too, but I can't find it in the nose. Oh there it is. First sip proves there's some sweet malt in there. Taste is tart spicy phenolic-y. There's malt up front followed by an unpleasant alcohol burn then some clove and nail polish. Finishes with a lingering alcohol burn mixed with lemon pledge and a bit of earthiness. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, medium to full body and a spirited level of carbonation. Wow after the last few Peak beers really impressing me, this was quite a letdown. I don't think the high level of hops the spicy wheat, yeast, and alcohol meld very well in this one. One and done.","ktrillionaire","Jul 06, 2011"
4.29,27.3,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On-tap at Ale+Witch. There are a lot of bad beers out there, this is just one of them. It pours a turbid yellow-golden hue and is capped with a frothy white head; it has a good and sturdy appearance. The nose, however, is just not melding its various elements very well, and is something of a wreck. Basic notes of banana are to be found in the aroma, with maybe a bit of bubblegum, cut grass, and chlorophyll, but those associations are quickly usurped by the familiar stench of wet latex paint. Ugghh. Bitter unripe banana and overripe orange juice is generally suggested in the flavor, atop of sweet and somewhat chalky wheat. The feel, well, it is not its fault. Overall this brew is a tremendous example of how flavors and elements can clash and produce negative results. Bad.","tdexterc","Jul 05, 2011"
3.7,9.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I’m a guy who traditionally seeks out more "extreme" beers, and heffes do not often fall under the category. This beer on the other hand has the ABV and bitterness i like in my beers, while still being refreshing on a hot summer day. One word of caution however, if pouring from a bottle, LEAVE THE LAST INCH OF BEER IN THE BOTTLE! i spoke with Jon Cadoux, the head of peak organic, and he told me that in order to get the ABV they were going for, they had to use crazy amount of yeast (no surprise there). Their decision to remain true to heffe style and to stay 100% unfiltered, means you get a great beer, but you should sacrifice the last inch or so to the beer gods…","Sammy","Jul 04, 2011"

4.18,24,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a massive all head first time, off-white in color. Took awhile to settled down and reveal a hazy bright yellow body. Smells of bananas, spices, and hops. Taste has a more subdued version of the bananas and spices and a greatly pronounced IPA hops bitterness. Finish is quite long. As I got near the bottom of the pint the subsequent pours were ever more cloudy and quite a lot of sediment was in the bottom of the bottle. All in all although it's a fine flavorful beer I think it overdid the IPA aspect at the expense of the Hefe-weise attributes.","begforme4484","0"
3.28,-2.7,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"From 22 ouncer with a tin foiled, screw-off cap. I cannot believe how milky it looks. It is pale yellow on the whole but it is so milky and cloudy that it is opaque. A good sized head. On the nose I get a good supply of wheat with a bit of yeast and white pepper. They say there's clove in it but I did not notice that. The body is about medium. The taste has a generous dose of wheat with a solid but sour hoppiness thrown in. The higher ABV is masked pretty well. It is good for what it is but it does not represent the style as well as I had hoped. I don't expect I would buy it again.","puboflyons","Jun 29, 2011"

Smell: overripe banana, clove, milk caramel, hops are also here in equal measure: floral, herbal, lemon peel. Taste: banana, clove gets lost in a hefty spicy and leafy/herbal hop blast - citrus peel as well, then there's a somewhat offputting return of sickly sweet banana and caramel, right before the nice bitter/sticky, but not too sweet, finish. Creamy, pillowy feel. I really don't get this IPA + hefe/hefe-bock hybrid, but this one comes really close to being good.

3.67,8.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"22oz screw-top (that's always a good sign) bomber purchased at Shaw's in Derry. Murky yellow-amber body with bits of yeast in addition to the suspended yeast, with nearly two inches of off-white head that has some rather large bubbles in it and which dissipates slowly leaving some lacing. Grassy hops share the aroma with nut, banana, and a hint of alcohol. Banana-nut and a bit of bubblegum hit the palate first, then they're rudely pushed aside by a rather large dose of grassy citrussy hops that round out the finish. Heavy bodied with ample carbonation. Not quite sure what to make of this one. I liked it a lot better once I read the side of the bottle and realized it was supposed to be a cross between an IIPA and a Hef. It's almost like drinking two strong beers at once, which is unique and interesting. I think I'll pass next time though.","MrHurmateeowish","Jun 20, 2011"
