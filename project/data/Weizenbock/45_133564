4,2,,,,,,"On draft at the Pour House in NJ.  A turbid yellow amber with small head. Exceptionally fruity aroma like a ripe banana.  Attracted a fleet of fruit flies which hovered over the beer. The taste is like a bananas foster, ripe bananas, caramelized sugar and vanilla. A smooth and tasty weizenbock, but not one of the best available.  When consuming a high ABV beer like this you should be blasted with an explosion of flavor, not a mellow smooth drink. If it was 5% ABV it would be outstanding but at nearly 8% ABV it is just good.","wattoclone","Oct 18, 2014"

3.75,-4.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"an enormous wheat bock here, delicious and flavorful with a real sturdy wheat malt base, creamy in texture, with a wonderful banana yeast complexion. there is more sweetness here than i like in the style, incompletely digested by the yeast, which is so delicious though, dessert banana cream, so nice. i wish it was a little dryer, the sugar makes it hard to drink much of, and adds more body than we need here. a little vanilla in there, and again the yeast, its delicious. the alcohol comes out too just a bit, getting more intense when it warms up, but it belons in the style i think, at least a little. brooklyn has a way of making their beer all unique. this is very them, it fits with what they do and has their unusual flare to it. although i think its far from perfect stylistically, i like where it deviates.","StonedTrippin","Oct 01, 2014"

3.6,-8.2,,,,,,"Trailing sweetness deepens its finish and aftertaste with bread textures and a delicate rise of spice, mint and grass. With the mingle of fruit and clove, notions of bubblegum arise in aftertaste. It's a beautiful beer that doesn't exactly capture the quintessential essence of weizenbock but becomes a decadent addition to any session as an imperial hefeweizen.","BEERchitect","Sep 20, 2014"

3.95,0.8,,,,,,"Pours cloudy gold color with a big foamy 2 finger white head that faded slowly and left decent lacing. Smells of wheat, grass, caramel, coriander, grains and mild spices. Initially it's like a hefeweizen but then turns very malty. Tastes of wheat, grass, caramel, coriander, rum, toffee, grains, pepper and a sweetness like brown sugar or pumpkin pie; surprisingly more flavorful and gets more complex as it warms up. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium chewy body, average carbonation and a sweet grainy aftertaste that has a little touch of heat. Overall pretty tasty and a nice style that I normally don't have. I'd definitely have this again.","CHickman","Sep 09, 2014"

4.25,8.4,,,,,," The flavor is very good with lots of wheat malt with mild banana in the taste and light spice flaovrs which are peppery combined with the taste of alcohol in the background and slight hop presence as it finishes dry. Overall. I found this to be a very drinkable beer for the strength - recommended if you like a Weizen with a little extra umph - it is creamy and has a good amount of yeast presence - very fruity","Slatetank","0"
