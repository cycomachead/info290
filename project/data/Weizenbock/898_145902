3.92,3.2,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Pours a very deep brown with a thin tan head that burns off quickly. The aroma is very reminiscent of rum-soaked raisins. The body has a little more characteristics of weizenbock, a little hint of lighter fruits, but the rum/raisin combo dominates. The body is thinner, but not watery and has a nice smooth finish to it.","delta490","Jan 09, 2015"

4.11,8.2,4,4.25,4,4,4.25,"My new favorite from this brewery.  The smell is delicious with bananas, cherry, cinnamon, and bread.  The taste is a malt bomb.  It has the banana, dark wheat, and subtle oak.  I also noticed a bit of black cherry.  This may be my favorite holiday beer this season.","tigg924","Dec 30, 2014"
3.88,2.1,4,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"22 ounce bottle poured into a wheat glass. Nice deep brown with tint of ruby. Good tan head. Nice caramel aroma, with strong hints of the wheat. While present in the aroma, the flavor was all malty goodness. Flavors of caramel and molasses come through from the heavy malt, while just enough hops to provide a little balance. No real hop flavor in this. Nice flavor, and very smooth to drink. Rum barrel flavoring was only slight. Overall a great beer.","KWrightVT","Dec 28, 2014"
4.04,6.3,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Bready, caramel, raisin, sweet chocolate, toffee, and the Jamaican rum barrel adds some sweet notes.  Just a great seasonal beer.","Redrock","Dec 27, 2014"

3.98,4.7,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"22oz. bottle served in my GI tulip.  Pours a deep reddish-brown with a dense, two-inch, light tan colored head.  Head gradually dissipates into a quarter inch cap leaving creamy swaths of lacing in its wake.  Nose is consistent with a weizenbock; however a bit more subdued - fruity banana/bubblegum esters, a trace of cocoa and a hint of something slightly caustic towards the back which I'll attribute to the rum barrel.  Taste consistent with nose; however, I really don't get much rum barrel here.  That said, fruity esters and cocoa in the nose are more present and coalesce together nicely.  Mouthfeel is light-medium n body with an even carbonation and a creamy texture.  Overall, I expected a bit more from the barrel, but I'm pleasantly surprised by the beer given the ratings.  Very enjoyable with a well-hidden abv.  A nice holiday beer.","Jwale73","Dec 09, 2014"

3.42,-10,4.75,4.5,3,2,3.25,"O: I have a suspicion this beer improves with age, with some of the alcohol heat receding to let more of the malt sweetness and yeast esters through, and hopefully a bit of the carbonation dissipating as well. As it stands, it's not bad, just not the best weizenbock I've ever had.","UrbanCaveman","Nov 21, 2014"

Very full bodied but not too sweet. Now if I could only pinpoint the aftertaste. Incredibly it has the mild funk of a blue cheese....I know! Right?","seedyone","Nov 15, 2014"
