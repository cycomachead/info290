"Overall a tasty beer. Not great for the style but if it is a good beer I could care less!"

"Dark roasted malt with a bitter aftertaste. Burnt sugar with some hoppy flavors, though not much of the aromatics. Some burnt taste. Starts each sip with a sugary sensation that ends in the back of the throat with a hint of bitter cough syrup. I don't really taste much of the usual German wheat esters, but there is some fruit and a hint of banana. Overall, this sems too bitter and earthy for what I like in this style. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Depot Liquor in Brownwood, Texas."

"The only complaint I have is the $8.49 price for the 22 oz bottle. This is more that most other breweries have priced 22 oz bottles and indeed as much as most craft beers are selling for in six packs. At a price point of $8 + other beer options are more attractive."

"The fruit esters were a big component to this beer as well as a thick malt profile. Good roundness overall. Nice feel and quite tasty. Recommended!"

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass, unknown freshness date, but I bet its ultra fresh. This pours a dark brown almost black color with a nice tan head which quickly dissipates. The smells are a little of roasted malts, caramel, chocolate and a little fruit and sweetness. The feel is medium to thick and creamy. The taste is pretty good, there are the chocolate flavors along with some sweetness and fruit, but its less intense than I expected."

"O: Really enjoyed this one fresh at the brewery. They only tapped one keg and it went fairly quick: wanted a second pint, but it had already kicked. Will look for this in bottle."
"O: Rahr did a very good job with this beer. It is so tasty and enjoyable."
"O: This is a tasty beer which was a bit surprising to me. I didn't think i'd like it but it's a good interpretation of the style. It could us a bit more complexity but that's nitpicking."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thick, shockingly so... well carbed, this was a pleasant surprise!"
"A few swirls of the glass knocks out some of carbonation and helps smooth things out. Sweetness is just about right, just enough to give it a rich body and offset the alcohol...which is big. Smooth out the alc and add a bit more roastily-smooth chocolate and this one would be damn near world-class. <clap, clap>...I think this is the best in the 'To Thee' series since the Bourbon Barrel Winter Warmer. Better as it warms to around maybe 45 or so. I would (and will) have no problem sending this tasty treat out in trades or BIFs."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
