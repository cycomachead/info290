"Pours out a murky brown with a thin head. Smells of dark, caramel malts, and a huge punch of hefe yeast: lots of banana, but overwhelmingly clove-y. Flavor is classic weizenbock: banana nut bread, slight booze, yeasty esters and phenols. Clove is the strongest player here. Sweet finish. Mouthfeel is full and a bit sticky with some stinging carbonation. Awesome example of a weizenbock. Hard to believe this was made in the US."

"The Primus poured a an opaque deep rich amber brown with a huge fluffy tan head. The aroma was pure bubblegum banana bliss that hit all the perfect hefeweizen notes along with the spicy yeast and slight bits of sweet pear underneath. The taste was sublime and the mouthfeel was rich and creamy and all that I want in a weizenbock. The bubblegum and banana flavors dominated along with the yeast and strong hefeweizen spice notes that were expertly balanced. The Primus has to be on of the best Weizenbocks I have had and second only to Aventinus (although it is a Weizen Doppelbock) and my favorite Live Oak beer. This rich, creamy, satisfying brew was a real treat and something to look forward to every year."
"O- A great weizenbock that at some times reminded me of an awesome apple pie with nice sweet and baking spice notes. A really complex beer that revealed a lot of different layers."

"What a fun, enjoyable beer! I need more weizenbocks in my life. Thanks for the unexpected grumbler kojevergas!"

"O - Yet another great beer from Live Oak. I still prefer the hefe, but this is great nonetheless."

"O: Live Oak's Big Bark was one of my first craft beer love affairs, and this brings back that fondness for getting me started on good beer. Well done, Live Oak. You do Texas proud."

"Overall: Didn't really know what to expect as I have never had a wizenbock. Other than the appearance this beer was very very good. Another home run by live oak if I say my self."

""
""
"Magically Delicious!"
""
"I have ordered this 3 times now at Alamo Drafthouse even though usually I always try a new ""Badass beer"" every time I go. I'm disappointed that I can't buy it in bottles and that's the only place I know that sells it. All I can say is, if you know a place to get this, GO. Imbibe. It's well worth it. Good luck."

"This pours a murky/cloudy dark brown, with low foam. A bubblegummy banana aroma that’s complemented on the palate. It’s tangy, malty, caramelly sweet with a banana flavor. Smooth and sweet with a tangy finish—and deceptive at 8+% abv. Why isn’t this used in bbq sauce? Another good one from the folks at Live Oak."

"O: Reminds me of a milder version of Aventinus. Tastes very authentic, delicious."

"Overall: I've been waiting all year for this beer and it absolutely lives up to expectations. Hands down the best brew available on the market until it's retired for the season. I'd give my firstborn child if Live Oak would brew this year round."
"Overall: As with all Live Oak beers it is very true to the style and enjoyable. I prefer some of their other offerings to this one, but it’s still very good."
"Mouthfeel is sharp with a fine carbonation and a medium body. Slightly coating with each sip and a warm clove spice and toast aftertaste. A very fresh brew with a robust flavor and nice layered complexity. A great version of a weizenbock and well worth seeking out."
"D: An absolutely fantastic beer. One of the better weizenbocks I've had period, but especially from a US brewery."
"Had an 8oz glass at dinner at Lambert's in Austin. I swear it's very hard to tell this apart from Aventinus, the only obvious difference is there's an odd slightly watery element to the mouthfeel. Otherwise there's a rich blend of sweet, smooth wheat bread with caramel and dried fruits that make for an excellent after-dinner beer. Try this out, there are certainly few American-made weizenbocks that can match this."
"Strong, melanoidin-rich, fruity, big wheat beer - perfect to warm you up on a cold night. While imperfect, this is up there with Howling Wolf weizenbock on my list of great domestic examples of the style."
"On tap at my favorite Austin beer haunt the Draughthouse. All nice and properly filled the to the rim with a murky brown brew topped by a tan head. Sweet and malty to the nose, and that's about all I gather in that regard. Tastes big and sweet up front with a nice batch of grapes, bananas, some nutmeg, some cardomom and a far off woodiness. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Big and sweet but not cloying with just enough notes of balance to keep you singing a sweet tune in the live music capital of the world."
"Great beer, especially if you like bananas."
"Overall, this was one of the best of my trip. This is a great bock and very drinkable. I wanted to get more of this beer. I really enjoyed this one. Glad I had a chance to try it."
"Overall I have to admit I though this beer was a dubbel from the first few sips however as it warms the banana asserts itself a bit more. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: I thought this was a great seasonal. How often do you see weizenbocks around? If they were all like this, the answer should be all the time. A beer lovers beer. Thanks, LO."
"D - At 8% this beer does not have an overpowering alcohol warming to it but it does posses some. Not for every night but a well balanced beer that would be perfect in winter."
"Highly recommended to any wheat beer fan who can get his hands on it. In my view, Live Oak is the best wheat beer brewery in the United States (with Weyerbacher, New Glarus, and Penn all nipping at Live Oak's heels). Nice work by the guys in Austin."
"D - nice easy drinking beer. Wish I could find this at home"
"Drinkability: Another impressive release from the Live Oak folks; really like the subtle elements in this one"
"The beer pours dark brown with a cream colored head. The aroma is strong bananas and wheat. The flavor is bananas, wheat and cloves. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing too complicated or fancy, just a very well executed weizenbock that has no flaws. One of the best beers of this style I have tried."
"D - I enjoyed this beer a lot it has a very good taste making it so I could drink more of these than I should worth getting to try if you see it on tap"
"D - The one glass is surprisingly filling. The flavor is strong. Even though it is a pleasant flavor, one glass is enough for me. It hides the alcohol well."
"Had this on tap the other night at the Flying Saucer in Ft Worth. It was a real dark beer, dark brownish in color. I really enjoyed the smells it gave off especially for a dark beer, very fruity smell that was mostly banana. It tasted great too, it was very hoppy that was mixed with fruits and wasn't filling like a dark beer normally is. I thought it was an exceptional beer that was very drinkable. I even had a second. My girlfriend also loved this beer and she isn't a fan of beer at all!"
"Several of these scores could have went up actually. Nice ruby purplish color to the body with a very creamy beige head. Lots of bananas, clove and wheat grain in the nose. The flavors come together nicely in this one, score could have been higher but the yeast bite was a little sharp. Great wheat bock, nice and fruity and dark with banana, clove, coriander, cherry juice and candies plums. Mouthfeel is superb as I am finding a pattern here with Live Oaks offerings. Very creamy without being frothy, satisfying, well carbonated but with little bubbles. Very drinkable and refreshing for such a dark beer."
"Note: After having the beer a second time I decided that the look isn't that bad. I just wasn't used to it all, having been unfamiliar with the style. It originally looked like a dirty hefe to me, which was unappealing."
"Lots of chocolate in the flavor with a prevalent wheat tang. Bananas and cloves are still there, but might be a little less prevalent than some of the German versions. It's also a tad thinner and not as creamy as some of the best weizenbocks. Maybe it is not quite fair to expect such greatness from Live Oak as their hefeweizen, but this one is not quite up to that standard. I like it enough and I would definitely buy it again, especially considering the lack of good draft weizenbocks around. Is this the first regularly produced Texas WB? If so, it's a good start."
"D- Really enjoyed this beer and could have drank the whole growler on my own without a problem..."
"Another winner from Live Oak. Would love to see this one in bottles."
"Deep dark brown, minimal head, but its a clinger, nice lacing all the way down the pint glass. Roasty wheat and peppery smoke throughout the nose and very strong in the mouth. To me, its not the most pleasant taste, but I do think it fits the Weizenbock style. Goes down relatively smooth, and hides the 8% pretty well. I didn't try to drink more than one as I didn't particularly dig it. But, it is what it is, and I would encourage you to try it if you find yourself in Texas, especially if you are a Weizenbock fan. This doesn't taste all that far off Aventinus."
"D: I really only wanted one of the 22oz of these, even though the taste was off the charts (good) for me. I would definitely drink it again and hope I get the opportunity to do so. It was somewhat heavy which is what prevented me from drinking multiples of this."
"I had this on tap at the Gingerman in Houston. The beer was dark brown and hazy, with a thick off-white foam that lasted forever. There was a strong aroma of bananas & cloves, rich and delicious, honestly this smelled like Aventinus. Same with the taste, the essence of Aventinus, right down to the slightly bitter aftertaste and hint of lactose. Live Oak seems on a mission to replicate the best German beers, I've been very pleased with the several I've tried (hefeweizen, Primus, Oaktoberfest)."
"The flavor is just as complex as the aroma, starting with sweeter notes of dark bread and banana-nut muffins. Finishes strong, with a smooth, boozy warmth that balances nicely alongside earthen notes of wood and peat. Near-perfect body to this brew, with its creamy, medium-thick consistency and gentle carbonation level. With their phenomenal Hefeweizen, impressive Pilsner, and a newly added Weizenbock to their repertoire, LiveOak seems intent on recreating the German beer experience here in Texas. And for that, I couldn't be happier."
"Overall a really great beer. Excellent Weizenbock from Live Oak."
"Notes - An excellent Wezendopplebock. I get one whenever I'm somewhere that has it on draft."
"Drinkability: Well, that was pretty tasty and a downright joy to drink. Wheat [sic] else could you want from a weizenbock?"
"Overall another dang good beer from Live Oak."
"An extremely solid beer. I thought the mild roasty characters added a lot."
"Solid. Poured beautifully murky, with lasting lacing throughout. Wheaty aromas. Fruit. Bananas. Delicious banana and clove flavor. Luscious mouthfeel, smooth. I am pretty close to saying this is live oaks best beer. Almost. We will keep the hefeweizen there. Excellent. Highly recommended"
"Pours a dark red brown color body. Smallish head, creamy and tan. Very strong ripe aroma, some spiciness. Almost all bananas. Creamy softly carbonated palate. A nice fruit cocktail and banana taste.. Strong banana taste, like in the nose."
"This is my first Live Oak beer and I was impressed. It was probably a tad sweet for me, but it's still a great example of the style."
"I had never heard of this offering prior to last night, but decided to try it based on Live Oak's track record of making great brews- boy am I glad I did! I would highly recommend this offering- especially if you're fond of the Hefeweizen Live Oak makes."
"One of the best weizenbocks I've had."
"D - A very enjoyable beer and a great representation of the style. However, the richness of it would make it difficult to have more than a couple. Once again, the guys at Live Oak have shown their ability emulate the finest styles of German beers."
"There is nothing wrong with this Weizenbock. It is very enjoyable, and something I look forward to every year. Just not among my favorites of this particularly great brewery."
"D: Low for me but I hope some weizenbock or dunkel lovers review for comparison!"
