Fresh wheat bread and sweet banana aromas with hints of dark malt, dark fruit and a light touch of spice at the back end. Surprisingly, smooth, viscous feel up front with soft carbonation on the edges. Bready malt and banana flavors up front, dark fruit notes follow with tangy hoppiness on the edges. Spicy flavors arrive in the middle and slowly intensify to the end. Semi-dry finish, lightly crisp, with dark bread flavors and a lingering, spicy, peppery aftertaste.

Aroma of caramel, dark wheat, banana and clove. Flavor of lightly toasted wheat, caramel, banana clove, about as close to banana bread as I've ever had, with the only competition being Wells Banana Beer; this is more interesting. Finishes with mild hop and clove bitterness that lingers for a while. Medium bodied. A nice fruit forward weizenbock, with good caramel and clove. The sweetness is balanced by the drier clove finish. Southern Tier tends towards the sweet side in most styles, this one included, but that's to my taste; enjoyed this as much as any weizenbock I've had.","LiquidAmber","Jul 28, 2014"

Smooth, light body for style, good balance between a light sugary sweetness and the citric notes, especially the banana. Not typical of style, per se, and probably a beer that would grate on most people after awhile given the sweet and banana flavor aspects of this beer. However, for me it hit my sweet tooth and banana is my favorite fruit so this beer really hit the spot for me (that banana bread flavor they mention on the label, or something similar, is something I really liked in this beer).","clayrock81","Jun 27, 2014"

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big banana, raisin, plum, apple, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big banana, raisin, plum, apple, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy clove spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, raisin, plum, apple, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn good weizen bock. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 17, 2014"

Sweet malt backbone with caramel, toffee and light chocolate followed by zesty orange peel in the finish.

The smell was sweet, almost banana, with almost a mint characteristic to the wheat smell. The taste was great. Full yet not too filling or overpowering. A lot of wheat and the end had a sweet taste about it from the amount of alcohol in it. Very refreshing despite it's weight. I didn't think there would be as many bubbles in a beer that felt this dense, but overall I thought this was a superb beer with a lot of great flavors and would definitely recommend for those who enjoy German or Belgium styles but wanted something a little different.","WhiteHillsStore","Apr 25, 2014"

A very pleasing aroma. Once tasted the mouth feel was excellent with a medium body. Instantly the first flavor that hits you is banana, caramel, breading, malt, and slight hop. After another sip the hop edges its way in more but compliments the other flavors rather than overpowers them. I have to say this is a great Weizenbock and can compete with the German labels.

There were many elements that were on par with a classic Weizenbock such as the light caramel flavors and papery taste along with some of the fruity esters that pop in and out. To me it seemed a lot like the imported varieties that I can buy. But, I feel that it is hopped a bit heavier than what you would find in a classic Weizenbock. This is obviously just how I perceive it but it seems like it was a more modern interpretation of the beer without sacrificing its heritage.
