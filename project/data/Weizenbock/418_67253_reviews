"I know left hand just won a bunch of medals today at gabf, but this is not their strongest effort. 2011 vintage, looks cloudy, red/brown, and mostly flat, with that wheat malt lace we are all familiar with. my girlfriend thinks it smells like slim jim. I am thinking it smells like slightly higher quality cured meat, but smoky, salty, and fleshy for sure. now that I think of it, it smells a lot like the cured beef I ate in bosnia all summer last year. nothing about this tells me its beer. the flavor is also particularly wholesome, protein is evident here, salty again too. really just downright meaty, I don't get anything as far as malt or hops or yeast, maybe some lazy lager yeast on the back end, and some alcohol, but this is a miss on just about all counts. I don't dislike it, but the flavor is a far cry from the style guidelines, and it just really doesn't work for me. fall notes, but that's too little too late that its seasonally appropriate, this is a mess all over the place. so many left hand bombers have been, but I appreciate the spirit of experimentation that courses through most of them. skip this, if its even still around..."
"Nailed the color. Small amount of lace and a very thin beige head present with an aggressive pour. Smell is where this shines for me, Smoke smoke smoke, this is a rauchbier. Their is also a black tea and soy sauce smell integrated nicely with the strong smokiness. Taste is soy sauce, moderate smoke, mild sweetness, and light black tea flavors, nice. This was a unique yet well executed project by lefthand and the age has helped this beer."

"Bleah. First Left Hand beer I've had at home, and only the second I've ever tasted. I tried their milk stout at the ACBF in Boston last year and enjoyed it, so i know they're capable of good stuff. Best go back to the drawing board with this one guys."

"Maybe I got a bad bottle. Poured at a good temperature with no head or lace. Color is a very dark, clear, brown red. Aroma is roast, smoke, tea, malt. Flavor's like nose, carbonic tang is up front, followed by smokey sweet, and some tart, followed by some bitter in the finish. Body is ok, carbonation is a bit fizzy. Finish is like flavor, long in the smoke, and not that good. I'm dumping the rest."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma has a lot of meaty smoke in it as well as some wheat notes. The flavor is also very meaty tasting, with some banana and clove notes mixed in. I also get some wheat, as well as some ash and charcoal. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Not bad, but I wish the smoke was turned down a bit and the weizenbock notes were more prevalent."

"I like the smokey smell and taste, but the other tastes and texture are just not fitting together for me. Worth trying if only for its uniqueness."

"I can't say I love this, and I can't say I hate it. But it's different and worth trying"

"My other beverage interest is tea, and I find the Lapsang Souchong flavor too strong even in tea. And adding it to beer, the intense flavor just sticks out. I'm a big fan of weirdness in beer ingredients, but not when they're dosed with a heavy hand."
"Feels full in body, a little chewy, and a little oily."

"For me, a C brew, and that's being more than generous"

"Overall interesting to try, but not one I would probably buy again. It has some interesting flavors, nice tea like and the smoke starts nice but gets a bit overwhelming. The biggest problem with the beer is that the beer itself, malts etc, play a background role in this beer. It's more about the smoke and tea than weizen-doppelbock at all, for which the flavors are very subtle and hard to get to behind the heavy smoke and tea. I like the idea, but please tone those components down a bit and try again. The tannins start to get a bit heavy and combine with the smoked, char, and bitterness to bring a slightly unpleasant feel as well."

"This beer really brings out the smoke when paired with smoked meats."
"This is a wild beer. Definitely worth trying once. don't know if I would go back for another round."
"Overall- I really liked this on tap. I would like to try it on a nitro tap. This was a fresh batch just on tap, so it was crisp and clean. I bought 2 bottles to bring home and cellar. 1 in 6 months and 1 in a year."
"Overall: I liked this one more than I thought I would as I watched it fill my glass and begin to fill the air with the aroma of a backyard bbq. Not an everyday beer obviously but a must try."
"Interesting twist on the style. The smoke character is bold, and has a good amount of sweetness to balance. I only noticed the black tea on the aftertaste. Try it for something different."
"Phenolic, peaty smoke, and a dripping spoonful of diacetyl. I'm sorry, but I've wasted enough time on Left Hand brews to give them an in-depth review. I haven't had one in several years, and see they are still really poorly made. The body is kind of watery in spite of the jarring flavors, and the finish vapid. Fail."
"I can very easily see how some people here could hate this. On one hand, it's kinda like an inbred cousin of a Rauchbier. But personally, although the flavor combination is weird, I kinda dig it. But I have a great appreciation for out-of-the-box thinking. This probably isn't something I'll buy again, but I'm also not a huge fan of malty lager styles to begin with. But if this sounds intriguing to you, I'd recommend trying it once for sure."
"Serving type: bottle poured into pint glass"
"Had this beer from a 22 oz bomber bottle. I was excited to try this beer because of the smokey element. Poured into a pint glass. Right away the smell hits you in the face. Leather, smoke, burnt tar. Not a good combination. The taste was overwhelming fake Liquid Smoke to me. I couldn't get passed the leather, burnt soy sauce, fake liquid smoke taste of this beer. I dumped it, and I can count on one hand how many times I've dumped a beer. Not. Good."
"Always looking for something with smokey accents so I was happy to find this on the shelves. Poured into a pint glass, the color is a deep dark brown, looks like bog water. Initially presents with a deep beige head but that quickly faded leaving just a light film on top. Smell is hard to pin down. Definitely some smoke, with a hint of soy sauce, and tea leaves. On tasting this beer my taste buds were just as confused as my nose had been. The smokey flavor is just off. Rather than getting that great smoke campfire quality that elicits fond memories of camping with friends/family, I get a smoke quality of cheap cigar ash that has been left out a long time. Their is a soy sauce thing in the taste as well, but its like it had been left in the sauce pan and got burnt. The tea aspects on this beer create this background flavor that seems like dark fruit that is past its time. The mouthfeel doesn't help because the carbonation seems low, making this a thicker mess to have to get down. Overall I was really disappointed in this beer. I know Left Hand can make a good beer with smokey elements because I really enjoyed their Fade to Black vol 2 porter. This one just didn't work."
"Overall this is quite an interesting brew; and coincidentally very similar to one I planned on trying to homebrew one day."
"mouthfeel - light body and just cloying from the oversweetness, glad i had a imperial stout to get it out of my mouth"
"Pleasant enough, but the BBQ mesquite quality seems out of balance and becomes a bit too dominant after a while."
"NO NO NO....Hard to finish this beer. Split a bomber (thank God I shared) Poured dark brown with an average frothy brown head that lasted, with good lacing. Moderate roasted malt, wet wood and horrible smoke aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and light carbonation. Medium smoked sweet flavor with a medium smooth sweet finish. Some Tastes I can't pin point, maybe it's the Tea? Bad combination, no balance. By far Left Hands worst brew, I have an Imperial Stout from them next....Stay tuned."
"Thick body and creamy, smooth in the middle. A little bitter on the finish. A definite sipper. Nothing that made me want to buy another."
"Overall this was very disappointing. A weizenbock made with tarry schong tea made me excited for a complex smokey wheat beer but it's kind of a one dimensional mess."
"O: Out of this world good. I cannot think of any beer in which I have had recently that has unique. I really dig this and would absolutely buy again. Awesome offering."
"Overall, I'm glad I picked this up. I think the classification in which this beer is placed might throw people off. It definitely is more reminiscent of a Rauchbier, with some added strange qualities. This is still enjoyable to me."
"Notes: Not to style and liking it quite a bit for that. Provocative use of the Lapsang Souchong tea, providing and assertive smoked edge and a very sweet range, which sure is not going to be for any palate. I would not mind keeping one of this around for the right occasion."
"O- This beer has a nice smoke flavor that is unique and very pleasant just very little malt or hop character to support it. The smoke and esters from the hefe yeast are a bit odd together. Lapsang souchong bubblegum"
"Wow, this one is an interesting offering...I'm not really sure where to start. The peat smoked malt aroma and flavor is quite intriguing; however, it created a lot of off-flavors in areas that warranted more attention. One to pass on."
"This is not the bets Weizenbock I have had, in good part because the smell borders on off-putting. Yet overall, this is delicious and accessible despite its flaws. Strong and smooth, Left Hand--which is historically very hit-and-miss with me--has hit close to the mark with TNT, a solid, flavorful beer well worth trying."
"drinkable, I will say that."
"O. I really liked this one as an end of the day sipping beer, watching TV and relaxing with the wife."
"M. Medium to heavy-bodied, definitely a sipper, but well worth trying if you enjoy smoked beers."
"O: Just try it once. Half a pint if you can. If you hate it at least you can marinate your steaks in it. Definitely an experience in the world of weird maybe shouldn't have been released beers."
"O- The flavors were too complicated. It seemed to be a little bit all over the place, but the driver was smoked flavor. I drink smoked beer as I lived in Bamberg for a few years, but this one just does not hit on the notes I'd like which is clear direction in a flavor."
"The taste is liquid BBQ. Smokey wood and smoked roasted malt with some odd fruity flavors splashing the middle of the palate. If I were to blind taste this beer, I would not think it was a bock of any kind or contained wheat, or tea for that matter. This beer did not taste at all like a Weizenbock, was an interetsing drink nonethe less, and I would recommend this beer to fans of rauchbier or smokey flavors."
"A weizen dopplebock with tea. Pours a hazy very dark brown with fizzy tan head, fades to a thin ring leaving nothing on the glass. Smell: smoky, roasted grain, cola, fruity, caramelized sugar. Smells good, but pretty far afield for a weizenbock. Kind of almost works for a dopplebock. Taste: I have the same reaction to room temperature day old coffee. Which this tastes like to some degree. Also: cola, grainy, (some kind of) berry sweetness. Low carb, medium body, drying finish. And yuck, a drain pour. Bottled 2/16/2011. Left Hand has fooled me again."
"O- Smokey...almost a smokey, salty,oily fish aftertaste. Not for me. Not what I want in a beer. Had worse....some german urbock something or other...again...do not care for this one."
"Price = $6.00 at The Stags Head (NYC)"
"Hemp taste.On tap at The Ginger man NYC. Dar brown with an eighth of an inch of head on dark brown, lacey. Taste was rope and hemp in taste and in smell. Smoke altogether didn't work.Not meating the style. Sweaty. Not too drinkable.Average mouthfeel."
"D: This was a very unique and interesting fusion of flavors in a combination I never would have imagined. Not sure I loved it, but it was fun to try. The alcohol was very well hidden, so it was reasonably easy to drink. Definitely recommended to try once just for the experience, but probably not more than that."
"It had a decent mouthfeel, smooth for the most part. But all the smokiness left my palette feeling kinda overwhelmed after a while, kept rinsing it with water to get a better feel for the beer."
"very interesting; very different... worth tasting once, not sure i would get it again; very spicy, smoked flavor is dominant"
"D - Pretty drinkable. The smokiness is rather heavy handed, but at the same time kinda works. The other flavors could have been a bot more robust to compensate. That being said, it is a nice twist for a dark-weizen."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a light touch of carbonation. Slick on the tongue and a little tart in the finish from the fruity flavors. After awhile the smoke flavor loses it's novelty and becomes more of a liquid smoke fakeness that I wish tasted more peat/ scotch like. Overall a decent beer that you would expect from left hand but it falls flat. Worth a try but I can't see buying more then one... ever."
"D: They just tried too much. If they left out some of the rauch malt this might have been a super interesting beer but it worked against everything else going on."
"I recommend exposing this brew to ambient conditions for minimum of one hour before truly reviewing. Taste TNT fridge cold, then taste after the time period has elapsed. You will be pleasantly surprised :) And amazed!"
"I am new to this style but if this beer is anything like others in this genre than I would definitely like to try more of them. I could drink a few of these in one sitting."
"Opinion: I am normally a pretty big fan of what Left Hand does, but this beer has left me guessing. I am not sure what they were going for here, except for a reason for a collaborative effort with their local coffee shop. Perhaps this is their offering to compete with Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout. If so, they missed the boat. At least the beer is getting sweeter as it warms, but I am not sure that I am going to be able to finish this one. I think that this will be the first Left Hand beer that I have pitched, but it is just not ""doing it for me"". Sorry, Left Hand. Maybe your next one."
"Overall: I was a little worried reading the other reviews. Thankfully, I think they're a bit harsh. This is an interesting beer. Rich smokey flavors with a subtle sweet tea underside. I liked it."
"This is not something I enjoy. I don't understand were the tea comes into play here, because I get nothing, and way to much smoke. A very harsh beer. Not a Weisenbock at all, and not very pleasant. I would not recommend it."
"O: This beer is probably getting knocked too much for what it is, a heavy smoke beer. I applaud Left Hand for trying something new in the way of smoke beers, and I will gladly buy this again because I personally like it. Also, this is certainly not deserving of the poor ratings it is getting similar to that of BA Wake Up Dead."
"Overall: I think I liked the idea much better than I liked the actual beer."
"Aroma is smoky and yeasty with a malty undertone and a firm hint of caramel. It pours a dark opaque brown with a respectable, if not persistent, light tan head. Flavor is yeasty, smoky and malty with a caramel undertone and a fruity hint - could there be a bit of raspberry in there? Texture is smooth and nicely fizzy, leaving a fruity tingle behind."
"D: An interesting beer that isn't quite of its style, but is still drinkable."
"O - This is interesting. It helps knowing that this tea is smoked. Do not drink this thinking you are getting a traditional weizenbock."
"Overall not a good combination. Not pleasant, will likely be a drain pour."
"Overall I wasn’t a big fan of this beer and wish I’d gone with the house beer for half the price, not to mention it’s Sweetwater IPA. Interesting but not worth seeking out."
"not very impressed. sounded interesting, and it is interesting, but overall its totally not for me, and not something I would drink again."
"A little overcarbonated, which actually helps keep the smoke flavor off the palate and allows some of the raisin and banana. Still, not an overall great effort. Pretty weird for the style and not in a good way."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and super chewy. This could be a meal in of itself, however a full 22 oz bottle is pushing the limits. The bacon character was a little off-putting at first. Just not what I was expecting. As the beer warms, flavors mellow out and it is more approachable. Not completely blown away, so maybe only a quarter stick."
"Kind of mixed feelings about this, I like the smokiness of the beer, but I am not a fan of the tea flavor which seems to me thins the beer out a lot."
"Hmmm...some good elements and some really odd ones."
"Had this one on tap this evening at Hops & Pie in the Highland neighborhood in North Denver. I had considered purchasing a bottle for a few seconds the other day, but passed. Glad I did. Medium brown color, with a scant off-white head. Aromas of light smoke, dark raisins, bananas and wheat. Similar on the palate, but hidden behind an overwhelming (and unpleasant) smokiness."
"Use your wallet (trust me, close it) to coup this beer out of rotation."
"It is worth noting that it can be redeemed by a pepperoncini pairing... The spiciness of the pepper quells the sweetness of the taste."
"Watching opening day baseball with a few beers,hopefully the Tigers can get a win against the f###g Yankees.Poured into my Aventinus glass a cloudy,hazy russett color with a large fluffy beige colored head.The tea really stands out in the nose along wich spiced,smokey phenols,not over done in my mind.A little light and sharp in the mouth,smoke and phenols dominate the flavors,quite spicy and yeasty,the smoke seems to be a little off.The beer started out promising but did fizzle out a little when came to flavor and feel,I think its a little heavy handed in the yeast department,the tea didnt play a big role on the palate for me until the beer warmed a little and it didnt really cut thru the phenols.Bottled on 2/11/11."
"Overall just not what a beer should be. The idea was very intriguing, but ultimately a failure. How did this make it's way into distribution???"
"Overall...interesting. For anybody who really enjoys wheat beers this will be a standout. I've never had a wheat that combines the smoke and tea elements. Worth trying!"
"I love Left Hand Brewery. I love there smoked line up. They make some of my favorite beer. This, however, is a train wreck. Murky brown color with almost no head. It looks like shit water, seriously. The aroma is the only saving grace. Love the smoke notes. Reminded me of oak smoke. Flavor was unexpectedly smokey and dominant. Caught some tea notes, especially on the end. Didn't get anything else. There is a lot of flavor in there but it's a train wreck. I'm sure some will laud over it's complexity but this is not complex, this is an ambush of flavor. Left Hand is better than this!"
"Overall, love the complexity. A lot of flavor and taste to sort out."
