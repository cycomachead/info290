Obviously this hilarious politically-themed label has caught my eye during many trips to the bottle shop but for some reason I never did pull the trigger. Oh well. Here we go. Color is somewhere between golden amber and orange marmalade, with a light dusting of off-white foam, more lace on the glass than anything. Aroma is rather nice, the expected banana and clove notes accompanied by bright grapefruit and orange citrus. Palate is malt-forward but everything is well-integrated: Banana nut bread, golden raisins, marmalade, even something tropical (guava perhaps?). Body is solidly within medium territory, smooth and drinkable for a "big" style with a moderate prickly "bite". Finishes fruity and spicy, citrus and curry perhaps. Nothing sticking out like an ill-advised long gun registry. Nice winter brew that compares favorably with a few of the German classics.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 06, 2014"

Bocks are traditionally for the spring. This beer is an amalgam of the two seasons, showcasing budding florals, greening spruce trees and fresh (not fermented) fruits. Shawinigan Handshake definitely isn't your Gro√üvater's Weizenbock but it's a must try - especially for hop-heads.","biegaman","Nov 23, 2013"

Le Trou Du Diable's Shawinigan Handshake is damn tasty stuff, although not exactly what I would call a 'traditional' weizenbock - the hop choice is decidedly North American in flavour, which causes this to come across as an IPA crossed with a weizenbock. Hop heads like myself will no doubt appreciate the interplay, although fans of classic weizenbocks like Aventinus or Vitus may be caught off-guard by the astringency. This is a beer I'd certainly recommend, though probably only to fans of hoppy brews in general - it's a quirky wheat beer, which, given the name and label art, isn't terribly surprising. A solid offering, and I am eager to try more Trou du Diable brews in the future.","thehyperduck","Beers"

3.34,-11.9,4,3.75,3.25,2.5,3.25,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, peach-gold coloring with a frothy, uneven, off-white filmy surface coating of head. Aromas of banana bread, cloves, subtle bubble gum sweetness, and sappy spruce tassels. Flavors are bready on the forward tongue, with heavy clove spicing and spruce. Banana and orange fruit sweetness blend together, but get outweighed by the initial flavorings. The carbonation in the beer and the light body results in an almost astringent, sharp feeling on the forward tongue when you drink. There is also an acidic characteristic on the initial taste that slowly calms as the beer passes through the mouth. Seems lighter in mouth than what I would expect for the aromas and the flavors. The aftertaste is woody and roasted, with a hint of spicing that lingers on past the quick, effervescent finish. The end of the beer is almost astringent again as it clears the palate. Decent flavors throughout, but the body makes it a tough one to drink for me.","GarthDanielson","Jun 27, 2013"
