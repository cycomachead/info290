"Got this during SF beer week from a tap. Super delicious. Very complex, strong beer. Would love to try it again."
""
"-overall a good beer not my favorite german style but a good beer none the less"
"feel: sharp light body"
""
"Mouthfeel is mild but a little still. Overall, not bad at all, but not really my style. Which is not a surprise."
""
""
"Doppelbock is a tricky style to get right, Weizenbock perhaps even more so.  And Aventinus is one of my all time favorite beers.  So I am even more let down by this offering from Deschutes than I might have otherwise been."
"This pours a light tan with manila foam. Thereâ€™s a light clove and banana character on the aroma, with a dominant banana bubble gum taste once sipped. Malty sweet and strong!"
""
""
"Overall a big strong malt bomb of a beer. Enjoyable enough, but probably not something I would seek out again."

"Would have again; worth a shot, especially if you like German beers to begin with. (4)"

"strange initial chemical sweetness that turned me off. Nice and boozy though and I got over the sweetness and took one for the team and finished the bomber!"

"Pours a hazy burnt-orange in color with a good 1+-finger beige head that finally settles down a good half way through the drink to around 2mm or so. Lots of sticky lacing is seen when sipped. A lot going on with the aroma and is of sweet caramel malts, banana. clove, bumble gum and spices. Pretty much the same for the taste with the malts right up front followed by the spices followed by some bubble gun flavor with yeast and more malts. Sweet finish as would be excepted for this type of brew. Medium+-bodies with perfect carbonation. This is a good 'sipper' type of brew because of the high alcohol content for sure, BUT you don't taste it!. Only one is needed. LOL! Overall a tasty brew. :D"

"Taste like 211 but without kick. Not worth the money, just go ahead and get a 40oz of 211, and save $8."
""
""
"Overall:  10.7 abv does not suit this beer at all.  The flavors are too over the top sweet likely a result of forcing the higher alcohol content.  This is a strong pass for all but the biggest fans of the style."

"Doppel Dinkel pours a hazy brown color, with a small lacing head.  There is a big malty, beady aroma, with hints of ester and alcohol.  The taste has a beady flavor, ester flavors, and big alcohol flavors.  Strong flavors, body seems a little flat.  Overall its big and flavorful, but I think the alcohol may be too powerful."

"O: I'm torn here. While the flavor profile offers significant complexity, it also heavily features a two-note barrage of pine and alcohol, to me. While the mouthfeel is exactly what one wants out of a weizenbock in consistency, the carbonation and heat are a bit excessive. I imagine for those who are less hop-sensitive than I am, this is an outright good beer. I am left wondering if I would repeat it given the opportunity."

"This beer was poured from a 22oz bottle into a Blind Pig mug and enjoyed at apx 50F."
"O: Happy to finally get my hands on this one. More German style dark wheat beer rather than doppel bock than I was expecting, but quite tasty (and a bit of an ass kicker)."

"This has a very yeasty flavor typical of weizenbocks, but with a depth of dark malt flavor only a doppelbock could provide. This is a near-perfect rendering of a dark, big beer in my opinion, with a focus on the sweet yeastiness that takes away from the alcohol hotness, but not too much. Great brew, for sure. This beats any big stout I've tried, I'm pretty sure."
"o: its a good beer.   the flavor profile is ordered in a nice way, and its easy to drink.  have to watch out on this one, with the high abc"

"Just not my style I guess, those Belgian yeast flavors can be a real turnoff for me in some beers. The nose was big time banana and clove, I thought the yeast did play well with the malts producing an aroma reminiscent of banana bread, also raisins and cherries, a little bubblegum. It poured ruby brown with a white head and it was full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. On the palate banana and clove were still the most prevalent, bubblegum, that banana bread thing I mentioned, cherry and some spices, but everything aside from those first two was pretty subtle. In the end I was conflicted with this beer because of personal preference. It's well made beer, good overall actually, it's just not for me."
"This is a big beer with big ABV and big flavor. It starts off a little sweet, bubblegum like, but with a little warmth it opens up to resemble a Quad. The bubblegum sweetness subsides and a raisin, date and dark fruit sweetness takes its place. It then finishes with huge matiness. The feel is very thick with a little viscosity and a completely hidden ABV."

"Thanks Slatetank for sharing this with me. Pours a mahogany color with a big bubble composition for a head that fades quick. The aroma primarily contains a sweetness reminiscent of candy, toffee, raison and molasses. The taste is similar with belgian clove and peppery spice. A sticky sweetness and almost buttery note towards the finish. This is medium bodied with a light amount of carbonation. Pretty decent overall."

"Medium to medium full body suggests liquid bread."

"Overall this is a delicious beer, a nice Bavarian style weizenbock that definitely fits in the style."
"22 ounce bottle, label says best before 06/17/15.  Served in a mug, the beer pours a burnt orange color with about a half inch light tan creamy head.  The head stays around a while, and there's a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like cloves, banana, bubblegum, caramel, and some candied oranges.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also bready malt and a sweet spiciness noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation.  It's also smooth and easy to drink, the 10.7% ABV is well hidden.  I liked this brew, definitely worth a try!  I know I wouldn't mind getting another bottle of this."
" The flavor has malt forward profile with strong bready character and mild sweet caramel with hint of stone fruit and slight spicy yeast aspect. The toffee and molassess type sweetness w/ deep yeast in the flavor which brings a current-like and mild fig with earthy dark sugar flavor and mild alcohol as it warms. Overall I really liked this bock - nice amount of wheat malt and pretty easy to drink for a 10% beer with nice complexity and yeast influence. I would buy this again if it weren't $10 per bottle but don't regret paying that to experience it once."

"Poured on the orange side of amber. Smells like a doppel. Banana, double bubble, cloves, sweet malt and yeast. This beer realy delivers on the label description word for word. Citrusy with subtle banana, sweet, with a unique malt charachteristic. Also just a hint of spiceyness at the tail end. Almost like a cayene pepper. Perfect body and you would never know that it is almost 11%. Easily one of the best I have ever had in this style. Seems to be underrated to me."

"Overall: A very good twist on a German wheat bock. Good mix of fruit esters and spices."

"O - On one hand, I'm glad this isn't a year-round offering from Deschutes, because I'd be too far gone to do anything if it was, as this is the most easy to drink Doppel I think I've ever had. On the OTHER hand, I'm really sad it isn't a year-round beer, because I'd love to have the chance to snag it when in need of some beer psychotherapy. It's perfectly balanced, rich where it should be, and yielding as well. As a homebrewer, this beer makes me feel like I should brew something with Spelt as well... Deschutes scores yet another goal in my book, and at only $10 and some change, there's absolutely no reason to pass it up, given the chance to try it. DO EET! Cheers."

"Aroma of banana/bubblegum/clove. Amber color, medium haze, thin white head, no lacing. Flavor of banana/bubblegum/clove,  slightly spicy. Alcohol after, but very well hidden. Not thick or oily, very fluid. Good beer. Delicious, kinda like a hefeweizen."

"Pretty darn good beer. I'd say a bit more heat than one would want, and the aroma didn't wow me, but otherwise excellent."
""
"A truly interesting malt powerhouse, but a few sips is all I can do at one sitting. Do they make an apple-flavored cough syrup? From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
"Additional notes: the Deschutes web site calls this an imperial spelt beer and notes that a 'Traditional German Ale Yeast' was used."
"Overall: This is a unique take on the Weizenbock style. And while I like unique takes, I am not sure I fully appreciate the use of smelt or the overall sweet, highly alcoholic notes."
""
""
"This is a Weizenbock! Not a Dopple; but whatever you call it pretty good, could give Vitus a run for its money with some age on it. If you haven't cracked it, let it rest another 3-6 months"
""
""
""
"I reckon this is a decent stab at a Doppelbock but it didn't quite reach its destination."
""
""
"Interestingly, the more meladoidin-laden taste of bock is replaced here by those curiously charming hefeweizen flavors for interest and provocation."
""
"Overall: I'm loving this beer. Maybe not particularly traditional, but damn, damn tasty. And terrifyingly drinkable for its ABV."
""
"Fairly murky caramel with a lingering frothy head. Aromas of bubblegum and banana are not what I expected for a doppelbock. Floral notes and caramel are subtle. Flavor is very banana dominant, with underlying citrus. Notes of lemon and orange become more pronounced before the dry, bready finish. A little hot, but pretty tasty."
