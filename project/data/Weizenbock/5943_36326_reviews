"Heller Weizenbock is not my favorite weizenbock, however it is solid nonetheless - sure worth a visit for those that like the style."
"An odd beer – lighter in color and flavor than a bock yet with more bock flavor than a weizen. That said, it just doesn’t have much flavor. Not particularly good yet not particularly bad either. Worth trying once but probable won’t revisit it – too expensive for a mediocre beer."

"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, unknown bottle coding. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, ripe banana, white grape, orange peel, wheat, honey, bread, light caramel, clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, apple, ripe banana, white grape, orange peel, wheat, honey, bread, light caramel, light clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of pear, apple, white grape, banana, wheat, honey, bread, light caramel, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a nice malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice weizenbock. All around good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: The beer is quite easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden. Enjoyable and refreshing."

"Overall, I think this is a really good Weizen-Bock. The smell doesn't hold a lot and doesn't profess what is in the beer. But, when you get into it, it does really well. I would put this alongside Ayinger... I would have to say I may even choose this over Ayinger. What I like the most is that the bock-iness is subtle, it is noticeably there but not punching the wheats lights out. Plus, my bottle reads 7.8% ABV... and it is just not there. Smooth and hidden below the layers of goodness. I would definitely be glad to have this beer again."
"This beer has a light gold color and a nice solid white head that lingers. The beer smells like banana a little spicy note maybe clove and pungent alcohol. The taste has a rich malty flavor with hints of spice and citrus with a warm flavorful finish."

"an interesting german selection here, kind of a merger of two familiar styles, takes on a life of its own. the pour is cloudy and pineapple juice color and texture, with a good solid white head on it with fine retention. the nose is that classic banana yeast, a touch of clove spice, and a lot of booze. the taste starts off as a very malty hefe, the yeast is the only thing keeping this light, as the malt gives it a robust flavor and a rather dense body. some light citrus fruit in the taste, as well as a more complex spice mixture than just clove. it reminds me of sam summer, with that grains of paradise peppercorn sort of complexion, very different with that banana happening. id call it a tropical profile, but its too big and hefty for that, its a cold weather beer for me. the body is full as it can be in a beer this color, and the carbonation is pretty active. overall I like the flavor of this, but the feel and the alcohol content make it sort of a contradiction I cant get past in some ways. it wasn't to be easy drinking, but it isn't, and it wants to be a slow sipper, but it isn't that either, as it gets a little gross as it warms. a neat beer, but not one ill be rushing to purchase again."

"Overall: Interesting version of a Weizenbock, unlike any other wheat beer I’ve had. As mentioned again this was far more like a lager in flavor than a Weizenbock."

"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice deep amber color with a 1+ finger off white head. Smell is of bread, apricot, cloves and honey. Not overpowreing, but decent. Taste follows the nose closely with some added banana. Very strong fruit front which was a bit distracting. A bit heavy on the apricot/fruit. Minimal hops bite at the end. Feel was good with adequate carbonation. A bit dry to the finish. Overall- An okay beer that had a different twist with the apricot taste. A bit too strong on the fruit which left me with a tart, over the top taste with no hop balance. It was just okay IMO. Probably won't pick up another-"

"Overall this was o.k."
""
"Beer's body is medium in heft with a mid-to-high amount of carbonation. The beer's weight is substantial enough to cover this, the result being a lightly tingly, but mostly pillowy and smooth mouthfeel. Finish is dry, and a little sticky with sweetness."
"Overall - Dark beers aren't my style.. I was mistaken when I bought this because I thought it was going to be similar to a wheat or bock beer. But I won't knock it because I know it's good for what it's supposed to be.."
""
"O: Weizenbocks are hit or miss for me, and this one is a definite miss. I really enjoy Braurei Michael Plank's Dunkler Weizenbock, and as this is the brewery's most awarded beer, perhaps I simply expected too much. In my opinion, this beer is hot and boozy with an overly simplistic flavor profile. I probably will not be picking this one up again."

"The rich and savory melanoidin notes of the beer definately set it appart from other beers of it's type that don't take as much care. But the oily malt character offers just a slight flaw in taste and texture."
"Overall, a pretty good beer, definitely a recommend. I picked the pint up four 4 bones so that isn't too bad I guess."
"I had this at D'z back on Cinco de Mayo along with 2 other awesome Plank biers, this was actually my least favorite of the three but still damn good. Pours a slightly clouded deep golden amber hue with an off white head forming thick with fine even spread bands of lacing. Aroma has tart citric notes with notes of spiced applesauce coming through with some mild booziness arising the more I smell. NOt as much banana or clove as their standard weizen, this one just really flexes some fusel alcohol and a touch of malt liquor like strength. Flavor has layers of booze, apple, citrus, snd sharp wheat. A semi sweet malt character minimal herbal hop action with a warming level of booze even though it's only 7.5% abv. Mouthfeel has medium bodied even carbonation that coats the palate, really the warmth of the alcohol becomes a bit more than I want. Overall experience was unique my first heller weizenbock interesting hybrid style not seen often in the states."
"Overall I don't think I'd revisit this beer. The alcohol was much to strong for me, I barely finished one small bottle. The taste was much more like wine and less like a beer in my opinion. While I was hoping for a hefe and received this one, I gave it a shot. Not very drinkable in my opinion...I just could not get into this beer."
"M- Creamy and silky mouthfeel. Very smooth with a hint of bitterness in the finish."
"D: I definitely got a warm, fuzzy feeling drinking this beer. The notes of prunes and apples provide the right enough of sweetness. Very enjoyable!"
"Review from notes. Tasted from bottle at Lush West Town. Pours cloudy orange with a thin lace head. Nose is banana and clove with caramel malt and yeast. Flavor features more spices than the nose, but still has solid banana and yeast characteristics. The body is light with lively carbonation and a long yeasty finish."
"Not as wild as the Dunkler Weizenbock, but if there was ever a Weizenbock for the summer, this would be it. Salad is an easy pairing: We're thinking fresh arugula, grape tomatoes, red bell peppers and gorgonzola cheese with a lemon Caesar dressing."
"D: The alcohol is so well hidden that the beer is rather refreshing to drink and quite thirst quenching."
"Straw, cookie malt sweetness, appley yeast, with some phenolic spiciness as it warmed. Flavor was sweet and wheaty, caramel apple, with a grape juice aftertaste. After a few sips the nose became similarly cloying. There was a light astringency or apple tartness that seemed a little out of place. It was medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. Not sure how old it was, but it was the first time I saw it near Chicago. At $6, not a Weizenbock I will revisit."
"I'm thinking that this offering would be great with pork or beef. Anything barbequed would be a plus."
"Dark golden semi cloudy transparency. Big fizzy white head. Very fruity malt sents with subtle hints of toasts. A very balanced taste and quite enjoyable. A small wisp of raspberries seems to rise off the tip of my tongue after the rest is gone. a very balanced and enjoyable beer. Cheers."
"D - smooth and drinkable; complex but not distracting in aroma and flavor; at almost 8% abv, taking care of the whole bottle by yourself almost guarantees a buzz"
"Not bad. Slightly different twist on the hefe weizens from the major brewers. More emphasis on the malt rather than the full malty yeast character ot the others. Not so much in the traditional bavarian flav/aroma characteristics. Still very drinkable. Poured with only a moderate amount of head and a tiny bit of lace. Color is amber. Aroma is an astringent malt. Flav like that."
"This is a very good Weizenbock. Very traditional. I like it a lot, and something that I would recommend."
"D- quick and easy to drink, a nice porch beer as the weather warms up. A bit too gassy for more than a pair."
"D: I would like this beer better if the flavors were more in-your-face, however, the subtlety probably makes it easier to drink. I'm gonna finish this pretty quickly :)"
"For the alcohol level, the taste is very smooth. The malt flavor cancels the high alcohol, resulting in a mild but not sweet malt taste. The large bottle goes down easy with this drinkable beer."
"Very refrshing and easy to drink. This would pair well with any white meat or BBQ dish."
"A golden to light amber color body with a small fizzy offwhite head. some lacing left , medium carbonation . Aroma of bubblegume,cloves , bananna and maybe a hint of cherry and alcohol . Flavor is sweeter than expected , nice clean malt flavor , cloves , leather ,and a hint of lemongrass . Light bitterness , slightly grassy finish . Crisp clean mouthfeel , medium body . Quite sessionable and all around a good beer , enjoyable ."
"D-Interesting take...a blonde weizenbock....it works for me...not a tremendously memorable beer but worth trying. The biggest issue for me with the Plank beers in my area is the price. Much higher than the other german beers of similar quality."
"500mL bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a murky bubbly orange with a frothy off-white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass.. Aroma is sweet fruits, sweet malts and a hint of spice. The taste is loads of sweet fruit with a hint of sourness and mild spice. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with smooth carbonation. This is certainly an enjoyable Weizenbock."
"D - I was a little apprehensive when I opened the bottle, but it's going down pretty quick. I shouldn't have any troubles, although the carbonation might get a touch bloaty after a while. Decent weizenbock, that's probably not worth what I paid for it - better options out there."
"was ok, but nothing special among the wheats. even too much yeast? never had that much float in my beer (more then a finger settled in bottom)"
"Taste: Sweet and slick at first, with spicy yeast flavors that pop up in the finish."
"a german style that leads on to some interesting characteristics. pour is like a darker hef. almost amber with a soapier head of bigger bubbles as the beer is actually quite herbal. nose of bright apples and a mild sour and wheaty bread... palate secondary of hef fruit and bubblegum and a nice mild sour apple and clove. the sour seems to have that very minimal smoky quality to it... gives it a leathery finish that is too dry and constricting to be thirst quenching really quite a bit of clove that goes down very dry. some alcohol present but not until the beer got warmer."
"A very solid brew and drinkable to a nice fashion of soft wheaty treats. If you enjoy a good wheat beer then this will probably satisfy that craving."
"This beer was a hazy gold color with tons of carbonation and a huge white head. Pleasant aroma of banana, spice, and wheat. I enjoyed the taste, but did not think the aroma translated all the way into the taste: a little on the mild side. Medium-bodied, and a good beer to drink on a warm late spring day."
"This beer pours a semi cloudy orange-golden color. The head is huge. Too huge. Foam filled my whole weizen glass, and there was only an inch of beer on the bottom. I find myself sitting here looking a a glass full of foam wishing I were drinking a beer. The aroma is of vibrant banana, clove, and wheaty tang. The aroma is as big as the head, and I really dig that. The taste is full of banana with the clove and tangy elements rolling around the edges. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture. Overall, this is a great beer. The excessive head thing is annoying, but the rest of the beer makes up for it."
"D: Other than the sweet spicyness very drinkable. Although would start to feel it after 2."
"D: Very easy drink; could session this beer by flavor, but not by abv."
"The aroma is wheat like with bubble gum, bananas, cloves, and honey. The appearance is orange gold with a large head that fades to nothing. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall this is good but not great. It is still worth a try."
"D: A nice take on the style. I'm glad I picked it up. This bottle seemed much fresher than the last Plank beer I tried."
"Overall, incredibly smooth wheat flavor. Slightly sweet throughout, with a bit of sour tang, like a cider almost, with maybe some spicing. Hints at a bubblegum zest in there too. Everything meshes quite nicely. Crisp and carbonated, light body is very refreshing. Not too cloying, while still being flavorful. A little thin through, but that doesn't really work against it so much as it would with a different style. Amazingly smooth and drinkable. It doesn't quite stand up to Vitus or Aventinus for me, but still quite worthwhile nevertheless. I do dig the whole sweet and sour thing, though."
"D: Just a very nice clean beer. Too strong to session but I really enjoyed this and could have had another. This has the taste of an American version with 3% more ABV. To taste this fresh would probably be a joy."
"Bottom line: An excellent Heller Weizenbock. I'm glad I decided to try it!"
"Pours a rich lemon yellow with a head that will not quit. Aroma is grassy with fruit notes..very inviting. Taste has a decnt malt presence with a grassy fruity tartness...almost wine-like in dryness. Mouthfeel is smooth but extremely dry..as mentioned before a distinct wine-like presence. Very easy on the drinkability scale, hiding the 7.5 abv."
"Drinkability -- A pretty easy drinker, albeit one whose flavor ultimately underwhelms. I might need to try this one again on a sweltering summer day -- maybe then I'd want to guzzle it down quickly, while it's still ice-cold, and that could change my impressions. Overall, this is a nice, non-threatening weizenbock, and I'm likely to buy it again. I'd put it maybe one notch below Weihenstephaner Vitus (which is similar in many respects)."
"Pours a burnished red gold color with a very healthy head that fades to a nice cap that sticks around. Spicy fruitcake in the nose with clove, banana, pineapple and citron. Dry and spicy in the mouth, not as lush as most Weizenbocks, and the Heller version is far less rich and fruity and much drier and spicier than the darker version. Tasty and relatively smooth and with some late creamy banana once you get beyond the initial spice blast. Nice."
"If the carbonation were brought down a bit more, it would add to the drinkability, IMO. Still, this is a nice weizenbock with an interesting sweet and sour balance with a touch of spiciness."
"D - good drinkability hides the 7.5% very well.A clean refreshing beer."
"Quite drinkable, but not worth the extra price."
"This beer is nicely drinkable, and I really can't find anything wrong with it, except I have to compare it to Aventinus and it is just not on that level. Again, it's just a slight step away from a standard Hefeweizen, whereas I expect a Weizenbock to have more depth and intensity. Good, but frankly it makes me want to go have an Aventinus..."
"Opinion: I am pretty happy with this beer. It has a nice bready malt flavor with plenty of mouthfeel to let you know that you are drinking a real beer. I have only made it through half the beer at this point and I am already feeling pretty good. I would certainly drink this beer again."
"D: ok, didnt find it stood out much or gave me much incentive to buy more. an average drinking weizenbock."
"This is quite nice, it tastes like a traditional HefeWeizen with the volume turned up just a touch louder for just about every aspect."
"This is a pretty good beer, but it's not $4.50 a bottle good. Try if you like."
"This falls short of me being able to recommend it, too many distractions."
"The mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation allowing for flavors of banana-like fruitiness that gives way to some light spiciness. A great teasting beer. Compared to others in this style, it is what they should be judged by. I really enjoy the flavors."
"A really nice summery beer. Went very well with the BBQ chicken we had for dinner."
"Medium bodied, great carbonation. The only aspect that hinders its drinkability is its heavy lingering finish. Which is great in my opinion."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Picked this up down in Greensboro,NC over the weekend and Iam glad I did.Poured a dull cloudy golden with a thick frothy,sticky white head atop.A mix of caramel sweetness and clove-like spice in the nose with a firm bready mat base thru out,a mix of tropical fruit and caramel infused alcohol flavors with lighter clove and smoke,lusch full mouthfeel adds to the drinking experience.Wow a nice new German style of beer I have never had a pale weizenbock if others are this good I will look for more to be sure."
"5) The very simple flavors & quiet alcohol would make this beer an easy choice, but the clove becomes more of an annoyance with every other sip. It's a lopsided trade-off."
"EDIT: Recently I did a head to head with this beer and Vitus from Weihenstephan. There's a definitive herbal note and lots more green apple, but I don't think I liked it as much as Vitus. The herbal notes really seem to be a large factor in differentiating Plank beers from other wheat beers."
"Exceptional German-style beer and much needed after so many Belgians the night before in Atlanta Ale party! Good constrained bitterness finishing with a sweet wheat again and again. A delight for lunch, surprising 7.5% Good head and grainy creamy mouthfeel. Constrained spices, secondary bubblegum, bannana and clove."
"D, notes: A nice mash up of the hefe and bock style. I have never had a weizenbock before but my sense is it can be done better not to say this one is poor."
"golden with a mildly disconcerting neon orange hue. lots of bubble traffic up and down, the head is billowing and requires frequent bitter slurps to contain. once it's rested, the cotton-like lacing stays firm against the glass. subdued aromas of candied pecan and banana linger, some herbal notes as well. very fizzy, easy to drink. on the lighter side, somewhere in hefeweizen land. light caramel flavors dominate when carbonation hasn't taken hold already.. fresh baked bread and nothing offensively bold in terms of the holy trinity of yeast, banana & clove. 1/3 of the glass is gone in minutes, for 7.5% that makes this beer insanely drinkable. finishes a bit salty, leaving behind a oceanic yet grainy aftertaste which is a little strange.. and honestly, the only real drawback to this beer. like one friend said, didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised. and like my other friend said, i could sure 'drink the shit out of it'."
"Drinkability: As others have said, think Imperial Hefe and you have this beer; quite an achievement"
"Overall I thought this was excellent. Really a great beer and something that I think everyone should try. It may seem heavy from the look, but I assure you this goes down like water. I would not hesitate to buy this one again."
"Drinkability: very pleasurable and easy to consume. Definitely worth seeking this one out."
"Overall, this is a beer that seems to defy its own style. Good, enjoyable, and I wish I had purchased some more, but not what I was expecting from a Weizenbock."
"Poured a light honey color with a lot of head. The head was nice and white which diminished to 1/8 of inch. Lasted for quite a bit. Nice lacing. Lots of yeast in the nose with a slightly sweet, yeasty flavor. This beer tastes more like a hefeweizen than their hefeweizen does. 7.5% alocohol is completely masked. I got no heat from this beer whatsoever. Unfortunately, much like the hefeweizen, I thought this beer lacked a depth in flavor. It was a little flat, especially when considering price."
"D: Damn fine. A bit too fizzy for my taste, but otherwise a fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: This one is good all the way down and I'd definitely ask for seconds."
"I am not too keen on describing the details of beer. I can tell you that it is not too hoppy, fairly sweet, but all around great. I don't usually like sweeter beers, but the carbonation and other tastes of this beer are excellent. I went to the BA German Beer Festival in Boston and this and this brewer was the best overall in my opinion. Great beer."
"Big foamy 3 or 4 finger head that settled in a couple minutes. Golden and cloudy. Very yeasty smelling with scents of clove and just a touch of banana, which accurately reflects its taste. Banana comes out more as it warms. Mouthfeel is pleasant, with a good amount of carbonation. Finishes smooth with lingering spicy yeast taste. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"D:Very good. Being that high in alcohol it was very easy to drink not to mention it was a fun complex beer."
"The beer looked outrageously good, pale golden color and hazy, nicely carbonated, thick and dry-sticky poofs of foam on top. The smell was banana/clove and a hint of sour milk, and the taste was seriously rich with the same flavors. Very creamy mouthfeel, this is almost a new standard for weizenbocks. Very nice and dangerous competition for Aventinus."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a very creamy smooth carbonation, and just an incredible drinkability. This one goes down so smoothy. If this was available anywhere near me I would keep some on hand all of the time. I picked mine up in Grand Rapids, MI."
"Candied bananas aromas rise from a papery yellow pour sporting a tall whip of white on top. This beer tastes like banana bread. Walnut hued alcoholic bitterness characterises the finish. Nutmeg and butter tease the mid-palate. Assertive, cutting lines of fizz help keep the experience dry. It is a bit boozy and monolithic to drink in sequences, but I perceive this to be a technically flawless and ambitious brewing achievement."
"In spite of all the bubbles, Heller Weizenbock is one of the best beers of this style that I've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. I'm not the least bit surprised to see that one more review will put it near the summit of the 'Top Weizenbocks' list on this site. It appears as though the brewers of Aventinus have some serious competition."
"Zum wohl!"
"Man oh man, I think I've found the holy grail of Bavarian Hefe breweries. I've yet to be let down from Michael Plank and see no turning back in my quest to try all of their offerings. I can only compare the majestic visual beauty of this ale to many world classics like Duvel and Orval. It seems to resonate a heavenly frequency as it sits there in the glass, awaiting your next move. I'm still tasting the residual yeast, powdered sugar and lemony rind flavors. At $5 a bottle, I believe this will be my 'splurge' beer for sure. An instant 'classic' says I."
"Hefeweizen fans take notice. Since it is a lighter version of a weizenbock, this comes across as being a something like a super-hefe. Tasty."
"yeah, i urge all of you to seek this out. now."
"Drinks easy for the ABV, weizenbier freaks will love this. I was looking for a little more body/wheat malt profile, still a nice one, never saw this when I traveling through Bayern, very happy to find it in such nice shape, so far from home!"
"Tangy wheat malt with a toasted edge up front. Big, ripe, fruit cocktail sweetness quickly takes over. Rummy bananas mix with yeast and gentle clove spice. Fruity sweetness in the finish with moderate noble bitterness, and yeast. Full-bodied, thick, protein-rich, yet gentle, creamy feel. Deliciously drinkable and a nice mix of hefe, weizenbock, and maibock."
"This is enjoyable and worth picking up. Very unimposing and flavorful and good on the nose."
"Mouthfeel is good, a touch on the lighter side but still good body with lots of fast moving tiny bubbles that race down the throat with each sip and get to be a bit much at times. I'm glad I found this tasty brew when I was up in Michigan last weekend. A lighter Weizenbock that's tasty and has a bit of a kick at 7.5%. Worth checking out...I hope to find a few more from this brewery sometime!"
