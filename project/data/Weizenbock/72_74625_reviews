"There's a lovely fruity explosion of esters right at the front. Nelson Sauvin hops come through nicely at the end. A delicate flavor."
""
"O: excellent for style."
"Great aroma but this did not quite fork for me. I missed the swet spiciness of a weisse. Miles behind Tap 6 for me."

"This was a perfect beer for me!  After aging three years, this was a marvellously smooth, tasty and rounded beer. Some of my favorite beers are from Schneider and this was far surpassed the expectations that I had."
"a very interesting idea here, a german wheat lager with nelson hops, has to be great right? well, it is great, but the bottle i shared was dated 2012, and i have to wonder if the one of a kind character of the nelson hops has tailed off a little bit over time. it sure seems that way, not to say the haze beige bronze colored heady beer isnt hoppy, because it is, but that tropical nelson character is pretty minimal, lost in a denser bodied strong wheat base. the bitterness is there, and so is a light lemony fruity element, but i couldnt not place it as nelson, which is concerning to me because i think its the most unmistakable hop varietal out there. love the creamy feel, the snappy finish, and the luxurious nature of the beer. prickly little bubbles lift up the malt, and the hops really do bring it alll together in the finish. its great beer, a new direction for the germans for sure, but i would love to compare this to a fresh bottle and see how it has changed over time. still awesome stuff though, just not the nelson bomb i had anticipated."

"Taste seems to have a slight oxidation present, papery notes to the wheat, some mild nebulous stonefruit, and a dry finish. Full bodied and fairly big in the abc department. Overall it was a bit of a letdown, not sure the age of the keg, but it didn't really seem hoppy or unique. 3.5/3.75/3.5"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/2/2011. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big apricot, white grape, pear, apple, lemon, banana, pineapple, clove, wheat, honey, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, hops, and pale malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big apricot, white grape, pear, apple, lemon, banana, pineapple, wheat, honey, bread, clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, white grape, pear, apple, lemon, banana, pineapple, wheat, honey, bread, clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice weizenbock. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, hops, and pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: As weird as it sounds, I've had plenty of German wheat beers that were made with NZ ingredients/hops. This one takes the cake. I'm going to go buy another bottle for the cellar right now, actually. Definitely in contention for favorite weiss."

"Enjoy"

"Later edit: Just had the 2011 vintage, and the fruitiness is off the charts. Huge orchard fruit and exotic lytchee. The rest are the same. But the hops hugely enhanced the fruity character. This is extremely tasty, a real treat. Just a quick edit of the ratings, setting taste to 4.75."

"Tasted on 12-30-2013. Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."
"This is a fantastic beer. I'm not sure it warrants the $17.99 price tag for a big bottle but it was tasty."

"A very subtle beer with just enough champagne essence to make it light-hearted but with enough beer muscle to keep up the attitude and get the job done before it strides off perfectly into the distance making you reflect on its genius."
""
"A really delicious beer, the hops provide a full delicious taste ontop of the really solid malt base, not as tropical punch as NS can be, this had more soft kiwi, lychee, pineapple and a slight tart aspect. Balance is perfect and it drinks very well. A tasty and complex beer that drinks much lighter than the abv. Would make an ideal summer beer. I would tone down the carbonation but otherwise enjoyed this, balance is quite good and the tartness works well with the wheat, another winner from this brewery."

"Overall - A very fine beer worth trying a couple of times because well, it was new and I hadn't seen it anywhere. In the future would probably buy other beers before this one, especially since I enjoy the Weihenstepahner Vitus and the Schneider-Weisse Aventinus (Tap 6) to all be in a similar vein. Nonethless a very enjoyable beer."

"O: An extremely tasty and beautiful beer."

""

"O - a tasty brew that I suspect has mellowed with nearly 2 years of aging, delicate flavours and super easy sipping, a great treat on a hot summer eve"
"Overall. Nice stuff, but not as nice as the Vitus I had recently."

"O- Very good beer, lots of tropical fruits, nice and light very easy drinking beer, worth a try even if its not your favorite style"
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure what I expected but I was pretty happy with what I ended up with, well worth a try even if its not your favorite style"
""
"Overall – Not sure if this beer is a little past it's prime, but it's still very good. Not something that stands out to me as something I need to buy again though. Happy to have tried."
""
"A rather good weizenbock, my only real beef here is with the sort of indistinct nature of the heralded guest hops - they're there, sure, but not in any measure that I might not have mistaken them for a touch of plain ol' Cascade. The wine character just doesn't permeate, leaving me with a kind of opportunity loss cost feeling. Good, but not as good as I was hoping - perhaps that's the German reservedness asserting itself here."
"O: A nice beer and always good to bad a rarity. I really think this beer has probably mellowed significantly in the the nearly 2 years since it was bottled (day 214 of 2011). I would love to lay a bottle of this down for 5 more years to see how it evolves. I just might , if I can muster the willpower."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a hazy medium golden amber with a fine three finger white head with great retention that leaves pillowy lacing. Classic weizen aroma of sweet wheat, bananas anc cloves, no evidence of the Nelson hopping. Flavor follows aroma, with sweet wheat, light banana and clove. Interesting light sweet fruit flavor, which I assume is from the the hops, vaguely reminiscent of a sweet white wine, although I would not have identified it as such if I had not read the bottle label. Finishes moderately dry with light fruity hops. Light bodied, but nice mouth feel from carbonation. A nice variant on a well made weizenbock. Flavors were well integrated, a bit subdued. Another great beer from this very consistantly good brewery."
""

"I hope Schneider Weisse change this to a year round edition."
"Really nice beer."
""

" The flavor is great as the mouthfeel with subtle floral hop entry andn caramel as indicated from the malt in the nose with subtle tropical taste from the yeast and Nelson hops with slight white grape tanginess and mild alcohol backing the mix of spice in the yeast and gentle banana with a goody amount of hop flavor considering the age of this bottle. Overall I was highly impressed a very good Weizenbock which I think fits the style well withh a nice taste from the Nelson Sauvin hop varietal - a pretty enjoyable beer and well worth the price in my opinion."
""
"O - a rare sight in these parts, it wasnt cheap but no regrets here. Very nice drop."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. 2011 vintage. Poured into a snifter. White head on a hazy light orange body. Clear and soapy lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma includes sweet bananas, a delicious yeastiness, and maybe some caramel and some clove and white pepper. Taste follows suit with banana dominating. Drank it fresh and now a year old. More earthy and slightly sweeter today but I would say this would be interesting to evaluate as it gets even older. Delicious. Period."

"Beer is medium bodied, with mid-level carbonation leading to a mouthfeel that foams up slightly across the palate, but is still quite enjoyable. Closes dry, with modest residual stickiness across the palate."
"Drinkability – Schneider makes great hefeweizens and weizenbocks. This is another."
""
""
""
"Overall: very good for a weisse with a fantastic nose, but gets tiring as the style usually does for me"
"Overall, this is good stuff, even with a year or so of age on it. They say ""can be cellared for later enjoyment"" on the bottle, but my guess is that it's not getting any better than it is now. My suggestion: drink it now, and if they happen to release it again, drink it as fresh as you can get it."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice weizenbock with a little extra hops. Good overall balance and hop profile."
"O: Very easy to drink considering how big this beer is (and especially compared to others in the style) and the alcohol is well hidden. A very enjoyable flavor and it highlights the use of one of my favorite hops."
"An exceptional Weizenbock. Seems a few German brewers are looking to break out of their rigid ways, without rocking the purity boat too much. What better way than to use a hop that will somewhat radically bring a new flavor to your beer without compromising. Kudos on the leap!"
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Not terribly intriguing, but still very good-tasting."
""
"Schneider one-offs are always something worth trying. This is no exception. This hop varietal has been getting alot of play recently, not always successfully. It works well with the style and plays nice with your standard wheat beer characteristics."
"O: A fantastic Weizenbock!"
"Use this to transition wine drinkers to beer. Delightful accompaniment to supper, white wine on a clean German style beer, some banana and cloves. Good weizen and unique tasty beer. Above average mouthfeel. Good foamy head.Great drinkability, mild sauvin aroma. Classy bottle."
"Cloudy orange body. Massive foam head, good retention and lace. Banana and tropical fruit aroma with an underlying wheat cracker note. Banana and gooseberry flavour up front followed by grapefruit and fairly high bitterness for the style. Medium-bodied with loads of fine, soft carbonation. Feels soft and velvety in the mouth. A well-crafted German weissbier, and a marriage of old traditions to new ingredients. I like it."
""
"M - Medium body; somewhat creamy. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some good aromas and flavors."
"Pours a lightly hazy yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, a light banana, and a small sweet fruitiness. In the taste, a dry banana peel, and quite wheaty. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry banana peel, and note of sweetness in the aftertaste. Big banana presence in a wheat, nice small, refreshing fruitiness, yet still a wheat."
"Overall, good. The Nelson Sauvin hop has a huge impact. Nice stuff."
""
" A solid beer."
"O - Went down pretty good. Had no trouble finishing the 750ml bottle."
"This is a great Weizenbock. By no means a hop bomb, but a great use of a 'new' hop strain in an old style from a conservative beer culture. Try this gem."
""
"Nothing amazingly special, but a very well-made beer."
"O/D - A really interesting beer. Nice Hefe character combined with Nelson. Really drinkable and enjoyable."
"An intriguing effort, and certainly enjoyable, though I wonder if a straight hefe would have been a better showcase of the hops here. For the price tag, probably not again, but certainly worth trying."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy dirty yellowish color beer with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of dry hops with light citrus notes and floral undertones with loads of wheat malt with subtle bubble gum notes. Taste is a complex mix of wheat malt and light bubblegum notes with a huge amount of wheat malt notes and some dry and floral hops with light citrus finish. Body is full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with great amount of complexity match by a good drinkability level."
"I tried this beer on June 2, 2012 after purchasing from the Queen's Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy medium gold colour with a thin white cap. The aroma was wheat malt, banana, clove, and undefinable spices. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was wheat malt, sweet malt, light fruits, and weak spices."
""
"Hazy blonde orange colour, 2 fingers of creamy white head, some lace left behind. Smell is of banana and yeast, fruity qualities, a belgian like green apple is there, tropical.citrus fruits, spicy and quite hoppy. Taste is quite fruity upfront leading into flavours of banana, some light alcohol, spice and cloves, hoppy, yeast and spice in the finish with an aftertaste of tropical fruit. Medium carbonation, creamy, medium-full body. Great stuff here, finished the 750ml with no problems, different take on the style and enjoyable all around."
""
"O - A yummy wiezenbock well worth taking for a spin. Super stoked that the LCBO brought this one in. Fantastic ale and I really enjoyed it."
"O- I really didn't see how this beer would be special. After tasting what only changing a hop variety can do it's quite remarkable the difference."
""
""

"Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Nelson Sauvin is a wheat beer as heavy as the bottle it comes in. It's also as strong as its name is long and hard to pronounce and, as a German beer that showcases New Zealand hops brewed for a Dutch cafe, is every bit as distinctive as it sounds. That said, I didn't enjoy it terribly and will think twice about buying it again. The earlier collaboration with Brooklyn was, for my tastes, a much better offering."
""
""
""
"Unique beer - from start to the end - it is even sold in a nice but uncommon 0.75l bottle [rather a prosecco bottle]. Not necessary 100% my taste, but better than most other wheats. Thumbs up!"
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Too expensive to get often, but quite interesting to try out. I suspect that the grape fruitiness I'm tasting is the Nelson Sauvin hops, but I don't know that for sure. A bit more flavorful than other Weizenbocks I've had, but I suspect part of that is due to the fact that I did not get all the yeast sediment into the glass. I've found far more often than not that if too much of the sediment comes into the glass, everything gets muddled and dominated by the yeast. In this case, the yeast was pretty well caked onto the bottom of the bottle (had to really shake it when rinsing it out) so I think the fact that the yeast didn't come along in the pour really helped me taste this beer and the unique hops put into it. So overall, a very drinkable beer (wishing I had more right now) and quite interesting, but due to the cost, it's more of a special occasion beer. The special hops really do come through, but I think only because most of the yeast stayed behind. Had the yeast come through I think I would have missed all the aroma and flavor like some of the other reviews suggest. Therefore I can say that this is a good beer. Not amazing, but definitely good if you leave the yeast sediment behind."
""
"Another highly drinkable Weisbier from Schneider. Though it didn't wow me with its aroma or flavor, I think it's well-crafted. My only complaint is that the Nelson Sauvin hops aren't more apparent, especially considering the beer's namesake. Prost!"
"Had high hopes for this after the nose, but the flavour profile falls a bit flat and the Nelson struggles to get a guernsey."
""
"Decent wheat beer but the Nelson just doesn't come through. Much prefer the brashness of the Schneider hopfenweisse. In light of this, this beer is pretty poor value. You're paying a big premium for something which tastes just like Schneider's other wheat beers."
""
"This is an exceptionally refined and well crafted beer. The combination of hop and hefeweizen is well executed. One of the best beers I've had recently."
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Beautiful golden yellow, not quite orange cloudy pour with a huge three finger snow white head with great retention and crazy lacing. The nose is typical Weizen with lots of clove, banana, and pineapple. But for me, the Nelson Sauvin made it stand apart in a subtle and pleasant way. The hops are definitely there, but not as in-your-face as I've experienced in the past with other styles brewed with Nelson Sauvin. The same is true in the taste with the standard hints of clove and banana, but there's more of a fruity flowery and subtle vinous tinge to this beer. I have to believe it's the Nelson Sauvin that make this so unique. I've lived in Germany for 11 years and never been a Weizen fan, but this beer is so much different than the typical German Weizen. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice slightly dry, refreshing finish. Still not a Weizen fan, but I would definitely revisit this beer if the price tag would come down a bit..."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied feel and moderately carbonated. A bit more hoppiness than expected in this style but that's what this beer is all about. The alcohol warmth is perfectly integrated making this an all around perfectly balanced weizenbier. This is a must try for wheat beer lovers. I'm not sold on the weizenbock classification here. Sure it is of bock strength but it is very pale in color and if not for the increased abv, it is very much a hefeweizen. Regardless, I am sold on this brew and would love to have it again. I hope this I'd a start for new things to come from Schneider. Well done!"
""
"Overall I'm kinda disappointed. I like regular Schneider Weisse Better"
"Hefeweizen, weizenbock, who cares! This is delightful. Is it $20 delightful? That's pushing it..."
"Overall: Pretty Good beer. Definantly not worth the 15$"
""
"Unfiltered golden orange/brown, brilliant white head that leaves lots of lacing and good retention. Nose is fruity with lots of tropical notes; a generous amount of wheat and lesser spicing is there. Sweet and certainly inviting. Taste has some dry wheaty flavours and the lovely juicy tropical fruitiness is revisited - mango, passionfruit and some nectarine pits stick out. Sweeter in the finish, with some spice character. I can draw alot of parallels between this and the Schneider-Brooklyner Weizenbock. Full bodied, with no alcohol and really smooth. Incredibly drinkable in terms of flavour, but not in price tag based on what Steve told me he paid for this - just way too expensive to revisit again for what it is."
"This is an interesting take on the style with the hops adding something to the mix. I'm not sure I'd put it up there with the best in the style as it doesn't come together completely for me."
"B"
"Cheers!"
""
"Not a whole lot different or better from other Schneider Weisse beers of similar color (like the original or the blonde or even Hopfenweiss), but certainly worth a try. Perfectly enjoyable if not tremendously interesting."
"Pours a very hazy apricot hue which leaves a two finger creamy head that stays and leaves nice lacing,the smell is banannas,candied wheat and floral hops,the mouthfeel is smooth,medium bodied and creamy and has tastes of freshly cut banannas with sugar on top,a touch of lychee,candied wheat,figs and finished with a floral hoppy finish and overall a very nice tasty brew that i would drink again cheers."
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice weizenbock, but I don't really see how it is all that different from Schneider's other products. I know that they are using Nelson Sauvin hops in this beer, but in all honesty, the tropical fruit flavors of the hops are pretty subdued. So, I guess I don't really understand what all the fuss is about. That being said, this is still an enjoyable weizenbock. It's just not great."
""
""
"O: Nelson sauvin hop adds a nice flavor differing from other weizenbocks."
"O - Intense balance and enjoyably smooth and delicious. A low profile carbonation helps mouthfeel and allows the flavors to pop."
"Overall: A very good all-round beer. This isn't a true weizenbock (as others have said), but the innovation shown here is quite interesting. A hefeweizen with a little bit more to it. Well worth a go!"
""
"Nice sized fluffy head with streaks of lace all the way down. Amber color with moderate carbonation. Smell has lots of clove and mild banana, sweet alcohol flexes itself. Taste is also sweet with booze, wheat malt, and bananas. Spicy clove and cinnamon with a peppery edge. Hops are well integrated and bloom as it warms giving a touch more bite. Feel is light with mild carbonation that gives way to a thin, smooth, creaminess. Not a bad beer and quite drinkable but at 20 bucks a bottle a bit too pricey for me to think about another."
"Single finger head on a dark cloudy golden amber body. Decent lacing. Aroma is mostly dark fruit and fig. Fairly sweet. The flavor is more subdued and mostly cantaloupe and dark red fruits. Musty as well. Medium body and light to moderate carbonation. Overall this is very drinkable however not as similar in the flavor as in the aroma as many other belgian dark strongs"
"D - Sweet and vinous, it doesn't quite become cloying, but it comes close. My first Nelson Sauvin beer and I'm really not that impressed."
"Schneider Tap X Mein Nelson Sauvin pours a mildly cloudy orange, with some goldenrod highlights. There's about three fingers of fluffy white foam. The head shows some staying power, but to say that lacing is just spotty would be being kind. The nose is very nice, there are some phenolic clove notes that play against an absolute ton of citrus and tropical fruit aromas. Somewhere in that menagerie is some banana as well. The flavor starts out nicely, with a little bit of bready sweetness fading into some clove notes. The hops on the back end are a little out of whack though, as the bitterness is a bit too pronounced compared to the somewhat lackluster citrus/fruity finish that doesn't live up to the nose on this beer. The body is fine, medium bodied and solid, but the carbonation just falls a bit dull. I'm a huge fan of the Schneider-Brooklyn Hopfen Weisse, so I was very much looking forward to another hoppy weisse from Schneider, but this one just doesn't measure up."
""
""
"Too me this is not more than a rather bland high alcohol wheat beer."
"D - The Nelson Sauvin contribution is fairly restrained, but this is a nice weizenbock with a complementary Belgian yeast presence mixed in. Probably not worth the hefty price tag (I think it was nearly $20 for a 750ml bottle), but it's refreshing to see German breweries stepping a bit outside their comfort zone. If I saw this on-tap I'd probably order a glass. Very easy to drink - the bottle went pretty quickly at our table."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a couple inch frothy white head. The head stays around a while, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like cloves, wheat, bananas, and some white grapes and bubblegum. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a slight sour citrus (lemon peel/orange) flavor also noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate/high carbonation. I think it's a solid beer overall, but I don't think it was worth what I paid for it (I think it was $17.99 a bottle). If it was cheaper, I'd consider buying this again in the future."
"M: The sweet goodness of a wheat beer with the added flavor of Nelson Sauvin - experimentation at its finest, especially from a German brewer. A good to very good beer."
"O: Tap X Mein Nelson Sauvin is a one-of-a-kind beer -- a very hoppy hefeweizen, but no a weizenbock by any stretch. I think more Munich malt would push this beer into the exceptional range. As it is now, the lemony sourness is a little much but the fruity hoppiness is very delicious and great twist on this style."
""
""
"Overall: A really interesting take and a rare example of stylistic creativity by a German brewer - I hope we see more of that"
"Pours a murky peach color with a good white head and a bit of lacing. The nose carries some tropical hop notes plus light clove and German yeast. Flavor falls back a bit more toward a standard hefe, though the hops are certainly still noticeable. Light body with a bit of chewiness. Pretty good and an interesting take on the weizen."
"I'm a sucker for both hopped wheat beers and NZ hops, so this one ticks boxes for me. Silky smooth and superbly balanced. Not quite the Brooklyner collaboration, but close."
"Works well with spiced pickled carrots and cheese."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is hazy and light orange colored with a thick, white head that leaves copious lacing on the glass. The aroma offers clove, banana, floral notes. Hops don't shine through as much as I expected, but instead, offer a subtle floral presence, more notably in the finish. Overall, a really pleasant flavor, most similar to a hefeweizen as opposed to a bock. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with just a hint of alcohol. This is a tasty beer, but not worth the $18.99 price tag."
"Poured a cloudy gold with good head and lace retention. I am picking up the usual cirtic notes in te aroma, as well as peppery spice and caramel but also some bread/dry malt but mostly a hefe like aroma. Smooth and creamy, the styles mesh well together. I'm picking up a hearty sweetness from caramel and a filling mouthfeel from yeast/wheat twang, all the while enjoying banana, orange peel and a touch lemon and clove spice balancing with each other. In the end it finishes great with a crisp alkie bite that leaves me wanting more."
"Beer is medium in body, bready, strong yeast character, overwhelmingly cloveish and banana esters. Bitter at the end, the bitterness is quite strong, mildly grainy. Overall nice but probably not a repeat at this price, it is like a really big edelweiss."
""
"What a great Thanksgiving beer to have,this is a world class weizenbock but I should have guessed it would be from this great brewery.Poured into my Brooklyner Schneider Hopfenweisse glass a hazed orange infused golden with a thick clingy white head atop that lasted quite awhile leaving multiple rings of broken lace behind as it settled. Yeasty bannana,clove,caramel,and some toasted nuttiness in the nose,a good amount of malt complexity going on here.The mouthfeel to me is near perfect,medium with a great creamy mellow feel,its something I could drink all day I think.Flavors of bannana and clove-spice,but its got this subtle component to it,mild caramel sweetness with the alcohol extremely well hidden.This weizenbock I could drink all day,full flavor but immensly drinkable,outstanding without being over the top."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid and flavorful beer to drink for a long time."
"[95/100]"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink compared to others in the style because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."

""
""
"D- I could drink this all night; as it is warming up it is getting even more complex. Will definitely be buying this again."
"O - An excellent Weizenbock! Normally I am not a fan of this beer type, but after tasting this one I am sure I will come back to have another try."
"Full bodied with an excellent balance of zesty spice, bready yeast, banana notes and sweet citrus. Really nice zesty clove presence up front that lingers throughout but doesn't dominate letting the other flavors shine. Prominent bready yeast flavor adds complexity and fullness to the palate creating a somewhat creamy texture. Lots of citrus sweetness along with banana.  Tons of orange and lemon zest which complmnets the clove.  Full bodied, flavorful and extremely quaffable.  The aroma is kind of weak but this beer packs a ton of flavor."
"Overall: I hardly ever score overall higher than taste, but something drew me to this beer. I liked the beer as a whole better than the taste. It doesn't make sense to me either."
"An excellent beer, no doubt, though I'm not really sure the added hops really provide all that much additional flavor. In other words, this would be a pretty excellent weizen bock all on it's own (IMHO). Regardless, this is another very well made beer from the excellent brewers at Schneider."
"Overall: A very nice beer from Schneider that reinforces just how much I like Nelson Sauvin hops."
"Overall I love the bouncing between orange and banana, and the play between bitter and sweet on this thing. It goes back and forth and forth. This is one unbelievably good beer."
