"for a dark wheat lager from germany, this is about as good as it can get. it is everything it says it is, and more. for me, i cant really see the style improving much, and like all the plank beers, its quality is simply astounding and well ahead of its peers. this pours a charcoal tinted brown color, with some yeast sediment and a rapidly rising milkshake thick khaki tan head that never relents. the nose is that banana clove hefe yeast, with some really roasty wheat malt that stays light and doesnt go bitter, as well as a clean bready lager yeast. interesting yeast combination here, very german, but also quite unique. the flavor starts with the dark grain and moves into a slightly boozy malty middle, a little sweeter than the start. it moves through banana bread, bran muffin, and campfire smoke, before returning to a relatively clean and tidy lager finish. impressively complex, not overdone, just clever and traditional at the same time. frothy and fluffy feeling, aside from a slight alcohol burn, this beer is gentle all the way through. carbonation is just active enough, and the beer opens up a whole lot as it warms too. the thing that amazes me as much as how good this is, is how cheap it is. i need to start buying this stuff a lot more frequently!"

"A nice beer, easy to look at’ smells good, and tastes pretty nice. Price point seems a tad high, but worth trying."

"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, unknown bottle code. Pours very hazy/murky dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger moderately dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, grape, apple, raisin, caramel, toast, brown bread, wheat, molasses, light clove, light banana, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, apple, grape, raisin, caramel, brown bread, wheat, molasses, toast, light banana, clove, herbal, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Light wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, brown bread, wheat, molasses, toast, clove, light banana, herbal, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt flavors with yeast fruitiness; with a nice malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent weizenbock. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is an absolutely delicious weizenbock. Hope I can find it at a liquor store so I won't have to pay $7 a bottle to drink it."
"You get the sweetness of bubblegum with some banana but also lots of deep roasted malts in the back. At first, I get the typical Weizen flavor, the super-duper sweetness of the Weizen yeast, but it's far more complex than that. I get black or chocolate malts, some coffee hints with full on Doppelbock-ness of the malt, maybe roasted barley. It's highly roasted, whatever the malt. If you let the beer bypass the front of your tongue, you taste the roasted barley full on. Bitterness is there, not pronounced, but noticeable in the very back of the tongue. I find it's a shame the Weizen yeast is so overpowering, for it almost masks these wonderful flavors. I'm not a huge fan of the bubblegummy Wiezens, I prefer a Kristalweizen with more lemony notes, but this one is not bad at all."
"The marriage of subtle sweet malt, lots of port-like dark fruit, and tart wheat really make this beer delicious. A very nice example of the style. Thoroughly enjoyable."

"Fairly characterful example of the style. Good esters keep things interesting."

"Taste is in line with the smell with the green, vegetable taste. The base is formed by a very malty munich malt, which gives the beer a dark taste, like bready and caramel, but without any of the roast. The beer is not bitter and has a firm body which is somewhat sweet, but not overly so. The high ratings made me expect more. This tastes like an off-batch. Too bad."

"Poured from the bottle into a Aventinus weizen glass. Tons of carbonation - a huge white head forms atop a cola brown colored body. That head stays for a while, and in this glass, it looks amazing. Smell was of fresh dates and rum. Taste was awesome too. Notes of molasses, caramel, banana, and chocolate covered cherry. Mouthfeel was smooth and a bit fizzy. The abv was well hidden. I like this beer a lot. Thanks to Drinking Drake for the recommendation."

"Overall I thought that this was an ok beer and an average example of the style, it had all those great Weizenbock aspects that I look for in this style in the aroma, but when it came to the taste it came up a little short. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, the carbonation was to fizzy, and the flavors didn't hold my attention like they should, one of these 500ml bottle's is enough for me. What I like most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and it had all the aromas that I come to expect from this style. What I liked least about this beer was that the taste didn't live up to the aroma and that the carbonation was way to high and fizzy, it just didn't work with this beer. I don't think I would buy this beer again unless I really wanted a Weizenbock and couldn't find a better one, it's worth a try but don't expect it to knock your socks off. This was my first beer from this brewery and it made for an ok first impression, I would be down to try more of their beer, but I can't say that I was overall impressed with this beer, they were too many flaws to make it my favorite. Wally's Weizenbock from Black Forest is still my favorite of the style, it's such a damn good beer and it blows this beer out of the water."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, and very enjoyable."
"The medium body is great for administering the flavors to your tastebuds. The high carbonation cuts through the body with ease, fizzing away whenever it comes into contact with your tongue. The swallow is rather foamy, but that is to be expected for the style."

"Overall: a nice German offering. Very flavorful and definitely drinkable. I enjoyed this one."

"Drinkability: Very well crafted brew. It lacks the deep complexity of the style’s heavy hitters, but it is still a good brew."
"I really enjoyed this beer. As a wheat beer, the wheat contributed more true malt flavor and body than wheaty flavor, and the fruitiness normally associated with wheat beers are solomn and make only background contributions to the beer's flavor profile."
"A quality weizenbock, stronger in flavor, but not sharper, than other versions of the style. Would check out again, definitely."
"Pours a deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, raisins, figs, and a mixture of othe dry dark fruits. In the taste, dark fruits of raisin and fig, and bit sweet and quite carbonated. A small carbonation like bite, but mainly smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small sticky - sweet dark fruit aftertaste. The fruit is nice and different, but it is a bit too much."
"So far my favorite of the Plank beers. This is a dark brown, murky and rich looking beer. I get some banana and spice in the nose, reminds me--at first and briefly--of the first time I had Rochefort 10. That rich banana and clove (?) up front. Anywho, this one adds some bake caramel and chocolate. Rich taste. Nutmeg is more apparent here and the banana melds into dark chocolate. Sweet roasted malt and spicy end, although somewhat light. Like the other Planks, I'd like to try this one at the brewery"
"2nd favorite out of the 3 Plank biers they were carrying at D'z. Pours a dark russet brown body with a foaming tan head, great carbonation levels going on. Aroma has a nice dark toasted malt tone with raisin and tart apples, very nice spiciness about it as well. Flavor was banana bread with a layered charred malt character adding a touch of smokiness, with a caramelized malt finish. Mouthfeel was medium to fuller bodied alcohol was evident but not overpowering in anyway. Overall drinkability was great another excellent German wheat beer served properly in a hefeweizen glass, my kind of weizenbock this competes or beats Ayinger's version."
"From a 500 mL stubby German bottle with no freshness date. Pours a clear mahogany, with violent levels of carbonation - possibly the most visibly carbonated beer I've ever seen - and a huge, noisy head that doesn't retain well. Loads of yeast at the bottom of the bottle turns the beer muddy and quite ugly. Smells doughy and yeasty, malty, fruity and vinous, with perhaps some hops. Fairly similar on the palate, with a light sweetness, mild bitterness, and a fairly prevalent note of acetone or ethyl acetate. It is fairly full and dry, and, despite its appearance, has a surprisingly low level of carbonation. Not an unpleasant beer, but it does have noticeable faults and perhaps some age on it. I imagine it would be better on the other side of the Atlantic."
"The taste was wonderfully caramel and rich with kilned malts. I was happy with this beer, it didn't sit me on my ass shouting OH MY GOD, so I gave it an above average. Plank is solid. done."
"I'm looking forward to doing comparisons with the Plank heller weizenbock, too. Interesting that all weizenbocks are lumped together on BA...the light and dark variations are very different."
"Beer is good!"
"This one's a bit rough around the edges, but most Weizenbocks are. We dig it--beer in the raw, sort of. A steaming hot bowl of goulash is bold enough to pair with this beer."
"This beer was fine, tasy, but not overly drinkable because of the sourness in there. Thick mouthffel, its filling, it looks good and dark. Not overally complex, bang the style but the only beer you can drink in a night. Lots of chocolate malt. Big malt aroma. Bannanas."
"Think I got a bottle that is just turning. Bummer. Poured with a nice foamy fine off white head and some lace. Color is mahoganey. Aroma is malty and dominated by sour. Flavor is like aroma and again dominated by the sour. Beer tasted like it was almost good. No date on the bottle. Finish is like flav. Bummer."
"Just like the Heller Weizenbock, this is excellent. A great traditional and old world example of the style. Highly recommended."
"Cheers."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of weizens of any sort, but this beer is really expanding my horizons. This is definitely one that I can finish quickly, and drink more. I'll have to pick up some more next time I go out :)"
"1227"
"Overall a good example of the style. It warms the cheeks and tummy while keeping its composure. A beer meant to be savored. Lively and muscular with a dark fruity center."
"500mL bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a murky dark brown with a decent frothy khaki head that is slow to diminish and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a decent amount of dried fruits, molasses and burnt caramel. The taste is a blend of sweet fruits, burnt caramel and mild spice. The beer is medium bodied with warming alcohol and decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable Weizenbock to say the least."
"tastes similar. mostly bready... not much to enjoy. medium body with ok carb, and i didn't dislike drinking it, but again nothing special"
"Poured from the bottle into my weizen glass, this brew is a deep reddish-brown with a thick white head that settles quickly. The nose is sweet, with ints of caramel and dried fruits. Hops are present, but subtle. The flavor is malty, with notes of caramel. On the middle of the palate, the wheat gives the beer a slight tang wich is very refreshing on a humid day like this one. The finish is off-dry, with fruity notes. For a weizenbock, the Plank doesn't have as much body as I would have expected from it. That may be the one downside to this beer. Overall it's pretty good and quite easy to drink."
"This is a straight up solid showcase of what a Weizenbock should seek to be like. Perhaps a bit more complexity to its chocolate tones and a chewier body may have lead me like this even more. But all in all, this was very likeable and worth the $4."
"D- Well, this was a disappointment. I can't think of another beer that is this boring, especially with the alcohol content this has."
"D - This is a really good brew. Great balance between wheat and malt!"
"I was looking for Vitus but the store did not have that. The clerk recommended this beer instead. Pours a dark copper color with a large white head that lasts a long time. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. I do not get a lot from the aroma but I do detect some cloves and banana. Also a hint of alcohol. The flavor is awesome. There is a reason I like the darker side of wheat beers. Fruity esters abound in the flavor. The alcohol is well hidden. Finishes clean and neutral. The body is nothing special but is light and well carbonated. I have not had Vitus yet, but it would have to be really something for it to be better than this beer."
"this beer pours a very pretty dirty copper with a tight crisp off white head that looks ready to recede to some patchy sheeting. the aroma is quite nice, although they didn't go to lengths to hide the alcohol. the yeasty esters are quite pronounced and the sweetness combined with the malt promise good things. the taste is quite nice with the banana and spice predominant, and the malt and alcohol warmth at the back. the body of this beer is very nice with the wheat malt doing its thing, and the crisp carbonation make it an easy drinker."
"This beer pours a murky brown color. The head is a massive three inches in height, and lasts forever leaving thick chunks of foam all over the glass. The aroma is of cloves, banana, tangy wheat, and hints of alcohol. The taste is full of tons of bananas, lots of cloves, and a trace of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture, and vibrant carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent weizenbock, and an excellent beer in general. I will surely drink this beer again numerous times."
"Somewhat hazed reddened amber with a modest head. Spicy, cidery aroma...sweet bread, raisins, mild ""holiday"" spices, clove, and chocolate. Just a bit of dried banana. More spiced flavors than a typical weizenbock. Dark fruit, apples, banana and bubblegum. Tart and drying with high carbonation that keeps the creaminess down. Pretty good."
"The aroma is sweet and fruity with raisins, sour kraut, gum-balls, caramel, toffee, and paper. The appearance is red brown with a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall a decent beer but nothing exceptional. I would recommend this."
"This is rather weak for a Weizenbock. Perhaps I was expecting a bit too much. Not bad, but not anything overtly special. If it's on sale, I'd get more of this, but I wouldn't choose it over a few others."
"D: OK, but not great. The slight vinegar taste makes me think I may have gotten an over the hill bottle. Maybe worth a revisit with a fresher sample."
"D: This is one of those beers that's drinkable, but not spectacularly so. Worth a shot."
"D: a bit to bubbly for me at times (not a bad thing), but is definitely worth the try. A solid brew and that makes me smile. Great flavors and a great vibe all around"
"Other notes: Good with Apalachicola oysters, even though those aren't my preferred variety."
"For me, the two best German weizenbocks out there are Schneider Aventinus and Weihenstephaner Vitus (which are drastically different from one another, but still great). This one doesn't come close."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a finely beaded head that settles to a thin cap. Lovely bready and banana aromas with just a touch of clove and chocolate. The taste is somewhat similar, but very fizzy which distracts slightly from the flavors, but it is also quite bready and with more pronounced. snappy clove and somewhat less banana up front, although it manifests in the finish. Crisp, highly carbonated and finishes bready and slightly sweet with zingy spice. Very nice example, I'll bet this is not quite so aggressively carbonated on tap. Nice."
"Alcohol is reasonably well-covered, though it adds just the right amount of warmth for the style. This is a delicious weizenbock with nice balance - sweet, sour, then bitterness mixing in."
"Overall, I found it quite enjoyable, and surprisingly drinkable given the strength. There are better examples of the style out there, but I'd certainly suggest trying it."
"Mouthfeel is really carbonated and gassy. It is almost distracting."
"500ml bottle served in a weizen glass. Tons of carbonation, massive head. I had to wait for it to settle to fill the glass. Poured a dark amber. Pretty restrained aroma of clove and some malt. I got a slightly metallic note that wasn't pleasant. Medium bodied with a decent malt backbone. A bit of spice in the finish. I was pretty disappointed with this. I'm a big bock fan, and I was really looking forward to trying this. It just seemed very bland."
"Poured from a bottle bought for $2.99 in northern OH (a steal versus $4-5 in MI). The beer is dark copper / burnt orange and clear, with a massive foam comprised of large celled suds. The nose is subdued versus competitive weizenbocks, but has the required bananas and cloves, and a hint of lactose. The taste is large, very rich with bananas and cloves and a little bubblegum, very sweet tasting. The thick body is just right for the style, this is a great beer even if its aroma is modest."
"Very good dunkle."
"Opinion: Well, I was pretty impressed with the Helles version of this beer without the yeast, but I almost think that this one should have the yeast swirled into it. Don't expect Aventinus with this beer, or you will be disappointed. This beer is really clean with the Weizen yeast character stepping in just enough to accentuate the beer...not run it. I actually like this trait in a Weizen beer as the really estery yeasts turn me off. This one is really clean and drinkable."
"Fairly deep chestnut color with a huge head on top. very, very highly carbonated. Fairly mellow banana/clovey aroma. Not as overbearing as some. Solid malty flavor with a nice crispness off of the wheat. Again not overly done with the weizen notes. I can handle one this mellow. Slight chocolate and smokey notes. Ok body-Id like a little more ""bock"" character body wise. Nice dunkelweizen. Pretty non offensive for those of you like me that are not huge weizen fans."
"D: Nice drinking full-flavored beer, but not over powering. I'm buying it again and pouring it fuller to decant it a bit and see if that helps."
"This is way too quaffable for a beer of this strength. If I was to complain I would say that it is lacking a richness and a malt sweetness that one expects in something labeled a Bock. On the other hand I do like how drinkable this is and how nice the dry, yet rich malt character is."
"Poured into a weizen glass a clouded mahogany brown with a little amber-like tinge to it,a big blooming off white head atop.Aromas are of green apple and clove mainly,a little banana shows thru as well,flavors are a good mix of dark fruit and a slight puckering green apple with some underlying chocolate and clove, medium to full makes the flavors seem fuller.A solid weizenbock here it has rich flavors and a nice feel,Plank makes some good beers in the general style."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, crystal malt scent along with some wheat and fruit esters. It has minimal banana/clove character. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, crystal and wheat malt flavor that goes down smooth and finishes dry with a mild yeastiness. It's not a powerful beer, yet it weighs in at 7.5% abv.. The hefe character is present as well as the lager dryness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's complex and flavorful, as well as true to style."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Wickedly aggressive carbonation that explodes like dynamite across the mouth. Piranha-like microbites sizzle the tongue while the beer expands in a gaseous, belly-filling fashion. With barely a swish, this puffs the cheeks outwards and tests my pressure capacities. Strong burps ensue, punctuating a less-than-impressive Weizenbock experience. Not recommended."
"pours up a dark brown with dark red edges. a nice, cream colored head. the nose is chocolate, toffee, and vanilla ice cream! that is interesting! tastes of slight alcohol spice, a slight metallic malt taste (probably due to this bottle maybe being not the freshest), dark fruits, red fruits, strawberries, dark cherries. medium bodied, low, frizzy carbo. i had a better bottle of this in Austin but oh well."
"So off balance. Glad I have a second bottle...will revise the review if that one performs significantly better. I can tell there's a great beer in here, but as of right now, I've had many better Weizenbocks. C'est la vie."
"Very well balanced. Good body and carbonation. Very well made. Excellent. I could go for this often."
"D: the sourness kind of turned me off, but it was a good weizenbock and worthy of a try."
"Not bad... good stuff..."
"Mouthfeel is poor due to the overdone carbonation. Very drinkable. The carbonation ruins what could be something special. The style is well suited for the transitioning seasons of winter to spring. Would pair well with pork."
"Drinkability: There's a heaviness to this brew, without the high ABV that would limit the amount one might drink this brew, but this is definitely quality over quantity."
"M/D: Full body, very thick feeling but not sticky or astringent, light carbonation. Alcohol masked well, drinkability is decent. Definitely can feel the fullness of this one. Very good beer, really feels like you could live off of this if needed."
"Overall- A solid Weizenbock! My 1st of the Plank beers and delicious!"
"D: A very good recommend and very good drink"
"D:Great beer. A very fun complete one as well."
"Plank Bavarian Dunkler Weizenbock is a fine example of the style. In fact, it might even be banging on great's door if properly carbonated."
"Pours a nice muddy brown color with a pillowy tan head that dissipated into a nice cap. The smell is of wheat malt, bananas and clove. The taste is of apples, banana and some other sweet fruit. I got a slight wave of chocolate malt but that didn't last very long. Sweeter and less dry than their hefe. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finished well balanced. A very easy to drink weizenbock, not much in the way of malty taste but very balanced and smooth."
"This is a very nice dark weizenbock beer. I first had this at the German Beer Festival in Boston and thought I would never find it again, but it is available at Elm St. Liquors in Davis Square. Another feather in their cap for what to me is the best beer store in Boston area. The beer pours cloudy, dark, not much head, and what there is is a bit on the soapy side. No lacing to speak of. The beer is moderately carbonated, medium bodied, and the smell is malt, yeast, and cooked prunes. The taste is the high point by far. There is a somewhat dryish, for a weizenbock, malty, and bready taste. The beer is amply full of yeast, and there is a prunish taste in the mid section that tails off in the finish. Some refer to this as banana, but I believe its more a full yeast flavor that is pushing things in the banana-ish direction. This is a very nice weizenbock that isn't too sweet, does not have an overly syrupy feel, and one in which the 7.5% ABV is well masked. Worth seeking out, if you can find it. L'Chaim."
"D- Easy-drinking Dunkle Weizen with plenty of flavor and boldness, good balance, well-masked alcohol is barely detectable"
"This beer poured a brown color with a huge rocky head that quickly began to subside. The aroma is malty with the yeast noticeable. The taste is malty and spicy  possibly even a bit floral. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is quite noticeable. Overall, this is an easy to drink brew  not offensive, but missing a punch."
"Drinkability: Very nice example of the style but not as good as the Aventinus"
"d: misleading until i re-read the label - bavarian dunkler weizenbock. not nearly as smooth as it smelled and tartness made it less drinkable than anticipated. not the best representation of a weizenbock, but smell was weizenbock-like while the taste was too dunkler -like. overall a good beer, just doesn't rank with aventinus or some other weizenbocks i've had if you want to compare it to ""straight"" weizenbocks."
"Overall- An obviously strong beer that wasn't too overpowering. I tried this beer at an Oktoberfest celebration and found myself having seconds without any ill-effects."
"Beer brought to beerclub by kkulacki, who keeps finding these Planks all over Michigan. Pours crimson/mahogany with a massive white head. looks very nice. Smells of black fruits, bananas, rum, malt and caramel. Taste is sweet, caramel malt with noticeable alcohol and a pruney-banana blend. Slightly yeasty. Banana flavor not overwhelming as it can be in some beers of the style. Very nice. Smooth, almost velvety. A very nice drinker. Wish we had it locally."
"Was pleased to see this beer on the shelves after reading the review of it in one of the BA magazines. Pours a light brown, with a rocky head that fades quickly. Smells of sweet berry, honey and alcohol come to mind for the aroma. Taste has elements of cherry, plum, and an overall wine or port presence. Mouthfeel is medium, and quite drinkable. Great example for this style. Tastes even better if you let it warm up a little bit."
"Under the cap there is a prolific cascade of gunsmoke. A pour launches foam that crests and recedes relatively quickly leaving a sheet of coffee ice cream colored foam. Banana flambee aromas focus neatly on top of cream and vanilla. A murky spine of burnt, oily bitterness swaddled in malty viscosity. Bright husk acids splash back alcohol, spice and bitter finishes."
"Zum wohl!"
"it's a crossover to be sure with that belgian flair...and it's a damn good beer...but trying to be the best of both worlds doesn't seem to work this time."
"Drank real easy for the abv, this is a nice weizenbock! The best one from this brewery IMO. I'd pay $5 for this again, easily, wish it was cheaper, though. I like this better than adventius I think. so say my ratings, need to do a side by side comparison!"
"D: The taste is a bit below the level of Aventinus, but it's not far off. Definitely worth a try."
"This is a very nice weizen-bock, but it barely falls into that category. Could easily be confused for some breweries dunkel-weizens. Either or, it's a good beer. I wish it had a bit more heft and body, personally."
"I paid 6 bucks for the 500ml bottle and I am definitely going to have this again."
"this beer was given to me by a friend in the beer industry. a new import. he knew nothing of the brewery, just that they made good beer. i have heard this many times and thought, well, here we go. this beer comes in a 500ml bottle and poures a dark walnut brown witha huge beige head. it looks great in my appropriate glassware. the smell is great. the taste is terrific. very heavy banana carmel malt witha slightly dry finish. mouthfeel was rather viscous and veryheavy. the drinkabilty was awesome. goes down so smooth and warming. a definite winner."
