3.96,2.9,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"To quote Lloyd Christmas, ""I like it a lot."" I have enjoyed Face Plant on tap and from bottles during my last two Montana ski trips. Both versions pour nicely, with about a inch of foamy head that does not hang around. The strength of this beer is the taste - wheat, dark malt, and what I can only describe as ""Cadbury Fruit and Nut Bar."" I enjoyed this on a chilly New Year's Eve while watching he torchlight and fireworks.","Bunman3","Dec 31, 2014"
4.04,4.9,3.75,4,4.25,3.5,4,"Overall – This is a quite tasty doppelbock.  Not super wheaty, but smooth, sweet, slightly fruity and rather easy drinking. And for the nice price, this is a good winter go to.","Darkmagus82","Dec 03, 2014"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This is what we in the beer-geek world would call a “malt bomb.” Explosively complex, the decoction mash is tooled here with precision to create this amazing brew with tons of malt depth. Another beer that shows that German Wheats brewed by American brewers don’t have to be clove-and-banana palate killers.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 09, 2013"

2.85,-26,3,3,2.5,3.5,3,"12 oz single from ""LifeSource"" Salem. $1.79 Pours very dark brown almost black with a quarter inch tan head..daker than all the weizen bocks i have had. Very little aroma..which is a surprise for style what there is is spicy bubblegum Again the flavor is very poor for a Doppel weizen..its non-descript..yeah iots pleasant anough but not what i expected..malty,sugary. Palte is fine to be sure..soft and thick Very very dissapointed","Reidrover","Dec 02, 2012"
3.46,-10.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Appearance is a dark amber brown supporting a steady healthy head leaving spotty lace. Smell is faint with dark malt, dark fruits and yeast. Taste of the dark malt, prunes and a little spiciness from the yeast. Mouthfeel has a medium body with a good spike of carbonation. For an American Weizen its not bad with the extra kick.","Bookseeb","Oct 20, 2012"

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a weizen glass. Pours a very dark red brown, two finger fine light tan head with great retention and lacing. Looks nice. Aroma of sweet malt with a hint of wheat. Flavor is rich sweet malt and dark fruit, only slight wheat and clove weizen elements. A slight rye-like sourness, but melds with the sweet malt nicely. Medium bodied with slight creaminess. Finish is a bit dry and has a slight hop kick with lingering malt flavors. Nice flavor integration. I really enjoyed this one.","LiquidAmber","Feb 29, 2012"
3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall, this is very similar to Bayern's other beers in that it is a very solid, highly drinkable representation of the style without standing out in any particular category. I'm happy to drink this at $7 a pitcher.","EricCioe","Feb 10, 2012"

3.89,1,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall (4): A tame beer for its dark colour, high alcohol, and 'bock' name. The weizen traits really shine through in the light malty wheat flavour and the creamy and easy-drinking mouthfeel. The power of the double malt is hinted at in the aroma and the colour. The higher alcohol content is effectively masked. Well done on an original style.","tonyf55","Jan 15, 2012"

3.6,-6.5,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"While it's no Aventinus, this a solid beer and as best I can tell, a pretty authentic Weizenbock. Maybe just a little more malt to balance that sweetness, but this beer definitely grows on me the more I drink it.","GeezLynn","Jan 15, 2011"
3.08,-20,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"The body was thin for the style, a bit too thin IMHO. Drinkability was OK, I enjoyed the couple I had, and would have more, but it's not the first example of the style I'd seek out. Worth trying if you see it.","beertunes","Dec 21, 2010"

3.25,-15.6,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Dark brown body 1/2 finger white head, quick dissipation and minimal lacing. Big malt presence in the nose, not too sweet more bready, but some subtle hops on the back end. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel, it's obvious this brewery does lagers right. Too heavy tasting for my liking have to admit this isn't my favorite style. A big burly bock to be sure.","jdense","Dec 23, 2009"
