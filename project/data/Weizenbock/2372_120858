3.37,-6.9,4,3.25,3.25,4,3.25,"O: A unique but weird beer that veers too far from the weizenbock style for me. The citrus is too strong and overpowers the basic elements of the style. The chocolate is a nice touch and alone would probably work pretty well with the style (who doesn't like chocolate banana bread). This beer has some potential but needs to leave out the citrus.","argock","Jun 14, 2014"

3.91,8,4,3.5,4,4.25,4,"Pours into my weizenbock glass a deep murky chestnut brown with a thick creamy light beige head atop that left a frothy mass as it settles slowly.Some brown sugar and banana in the nose but nothing that makes you say wow,a bit of roasted chocolate beans is there as well.The chocolate plays a big role on the palate and it goes well with some of the spiced phenols ,the orange comes into play late giving a juicy finish,as I drink more it stands out more.This beer is pretty cool with it's different flavors,do I like it?Yeah I do but it's different....in a good way.","oberon","May 29, 2014"

4.38,21,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Really unique beer. Maybe a little too much carbonation which creates a foamy mouthfeel, but that about the only negative for me. Lots of banana and orange, chocolate up front. I'd say banana is the second flavor you get and orange appears in the middle and finishes stronger. I'll definitely try to get some more of this one before its gone. One of a kind beer.","dankspank420","Beers"

The orange is on the back and smoothes over the beer nicely with a great aftertaste. Easy to take a bomber to the head. One of my favorites by Terrapin, fantastic job!","Cloaked_Phantom","May 12, 2014"
