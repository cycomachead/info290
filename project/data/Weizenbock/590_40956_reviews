review_text
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass and shared with Kristy K at the condo. Hazy orange with a thin off-white head but excellent lacing. Aroma is yeast, wheat, clove, green apple, bubblegum, and citrus. Taste is classic hefeweizen with clove, banana, and bread sweetness plus some citric hoppy bitterness. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, boozy and phenolic on the finish."

"Verdict: A nice Weizenbock from New Glarus, big and bold with a lot of flavor, perhaps a bit too astringent for only 9.60%, but all in all a nice treat of a beer that has aged nicely over the past few months. Kudos to Dan for this creation, it's bold and hoppy as advertised."

"O- This review really brought out all my adjectives.  So unique and tasty.  Like no other weizenbock I've had.  Almost perplexing."

"Spicy clove smell with a hint of cherry. Lots of aroma. Poured cloudy with a lot of head. Very flavorful beer. I don't like clove in my beers, but oddly I do here. This beer is very tart, but I think the clove and hints of cinnamon spice balance it out nicely. I’m very impressed by this beer. Wow!"

"O - It is a hoppy version of a great style. It reminds me of Schneider Hopfenweisse."
""

"Yeasty spice, with wheat. Very creamy mouthfeel, more enjoyable in that regard than Vitus. Almost dangerously drinkable."

"Overall: New Glarus certainly has a way with yeast. between this, their dark belgians and sours, you can't find many breweries who do so well with yeast. also possibly the most unique twist on a weizen I have had. I really like the wheat they use in this beer, and the yeast qualities are killer. really wished I could have tasted this when it was fresher."
""
""
""
"O: A slow sipper for sure. I'm happy I tried it, as I've really enjoyed everything else that I've tried from New Glarus, but this may have been tripped up by the age."
""
""
"I rather like the dry effervescence and the American hop character that this distinctive weizen presents. Its a rustic and zesty attitude that resonates through the session with sprite and zeal."
""
""
""

""

""

""

"Not your typical Weizenbock but very tasty indeed. The dry hopping is welcomed and the twist of tropical and citrus fruit really works with the wheat malts almost giving a bright lift. The body is smooth and creamy and the beer is beautiful in a glass. This is a must try."
""
""
""
"This is a weird one. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. It is quite good, but also odd. It's a yeasty, somewhat sweet, malty brew with a HUGE citric quality that isn't necessarily out of place, but just really unexpected. Definitely not for everyone (myself included)."
""
"Pour is hazed deep amber with a tight off white head leaving a thick lace. Nose is interesting, a lightly muddled wheat malt and spicy earthy yeast note give way to lemon and clove with a touch of candied lemon. There is a bit of an herbal back end. Taste has a lot happening, the wheat malt is up front, its earthy and musky. The yeast is quite spicy mingling with the candied lemon and some sweetness through the finish. Well carbonated, spice lingers, peppery. Body is full and creamy, faint dryness and a bit sweet through the finish."
""
""
""
""
"O - one of my favorite New Glarus beers to date. I hope they bring this one back."
""

"Bottle from a generous friend. Pours a hazy orange yellow with a massive creamy and fluffy white to off-white head. The head just won't quit! Beautiful fruit medley of banana, pear, bright citrus, spicy earthy funky yeast, bubble gum, floral notes of hibiscus and jasmine, and even what smells like some dank hops. This is beautiful, really incredible nose. The flavor is big florals and zesty hops up front followed by sweet pears and orange citrus, then finishing with a funky banana yeasty ness. There is significant zest to this in front of what seems to be a nice hefe and the combination is both unique and deliciously refreshing. I am surprised at how bright the hops still are, as I waited way too long to drink this. Medium body with medium high carbonation and loads of complex flavors. New Glarus does it again. I could drink this all day and there is no sign of the 9%+ ABV anywhere. This one could get dangerous."
""
""
"Love the fruit flavors that dominate. I'm not a wheat beer fan, but this isn't your typical weiss. The finish is just a touch too bitter. Couldn't tell it's as high as it is in abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall this is very interesting. maybe most like a Belgian Tripel. I liked it."

"Overall I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this was still enjoyable. Not the best example of the style in my opinion, but worth a one time shot."
"O- I usually don't enjoy Hefe's that much but I'm very glad I tried this one. Its a wonderful showcase of the yeast and wheat. This beer would be perfect at a grill out."
"Another fine beer from the New Glarus ``Thumbprint'' series. I wish it had a bit more malt complexity up front, and a little less booziness. Overall though, it's a unique beer with its strong fruit flavor, substantial belt of booziness, and nice spritzy feel. I think this would appeal to fans of traditional German Weizenbocks and Eisbocks who are in the mood for something new and different."
""
"O-An underproduced style. This beer was solid, SN Beer Camp was good. More breweries should make this."
"Bottle courtesy of Omensetter. Thanks! Pours a cloudy, straw yellow/orange. Huge, fluffy, creamy white head, lasting with some drapes of lace. Aroma is complex and bursting with character; hops, citrus, lemon, grapefruit, wheat, banana, clove. Flavor follows. Medium to full body. Creamy. A little oily. Sweet. Fruity. A fair amount of spices. Alcohol content? What alcohol content? Hardly any there. Hop character really makes an impression and complements the hefe qualities nicely. Great balance. Pleasant finish."

"Imperial Weizen pours a cloudy golden color with a huge frothy and lacing head. There is a sweet and sour aroma, with a strong yeast and banana/ester note. The taste is very similar, strong sweet and sour flavors with good hints of banana. Very strong feel and great body. Overall a fantastic complex beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I've not had many weizenbocks, but this one doesn't seem quite like what I would expect from the style. As I hinted in my review, this one reminded me a lot of some Wheatwines I've had, which is a good thing. I wish this beer was easier to get, because it was absolutely delicious."
""

"Beer is medium-heavy in weight, with carbonation of medium to medium-low in intensity, resulting in a thick, heavy, and smooth (3/4) mouthfeel with light foaminess (1/4). Ethanol felt in the nostrils Aftertaste is moderately dry, with moderate stickiness coating the palate and lips."

"This is a hazy gold beer with a substantial persistant head. In appearance, it is the eptiome of hefeweizen. A residue of yeast encircles the bottom of the bottle. A faint fruity fermentation aroma (overripe banana) penetrates the head, and carries with it a hint of citrusy hops. The initial taste is sweet and desert-like but well support by citrusy hop flavors and bitterness that prevents the beer from cloying. The texture of the beer is slick and lucious, with some alcohol warming, but it also carries a slight carbonic bite. that helps clean the mouth out and ready it for the next sip. What I love about this beer is that it keeps you on your toes by presenting contrasting sensations that might seem to clash on paper but work well together in your mouth. It is a cross between a weizenbock and an IPA, an imperial version of NG's Crack'd wheat, which I believe I scored a perfect 5. Tonight, this beer doesn't quite merit perfection, but it deserves to be acknowledged as a thing of beauty."

"Served from bottle at the brewery. Pours a hazy yellow which is cloudy and forms a generous head. Heavy lace present and nice retention. The nose features herbal hops, lemon zest, banana, and clove . Hops become stronger towards the end as notes of pine and grass come to the surface. The taste is lemony up front paired with pine hops followed by banana and clove. Grassy and earthy notes come through at the finish and provide a refreshing bitterness. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Overall, this is a unique and satisfying brew. I initially had no idea how hoppy this beer was going to be considering its style, but I must say it was a pleasant surprise."
""
"O: A weizen on steroids. Big alcohol warming, banana bread flavored, slightly sweet wheat beer. The carbonation got away from me on this one, but overall not one of my favorite NG's Thumbprints."

"An outstanding beer."
"O: An interesting style. I like the hops in conjunction with the Belgian flavors and the wheat, but the bitterness from the hops and the alcohol flavor/heat combine to make a fairly ""big"" beer. I could use a bigger body to help carry those flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good and interesting twist on a German Weizen style. Its like a combination of a Hefeweizen and Belgian IPA. Nicely yeasty and juicy."
"Mouthfeel is awesome. Medium body and huge amounts of carbonation leave this beer feeling very fluffy and drinkable. Refreshing but nt to light."
""
""
"High B"
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a great beer to be drinking on Oktoberfest weekend. New Glarus continues to make great beers that are surprisingly drinkable. Wish I would have bought more than just the 4 pack of this great Weizen... Prost!"

"Poured into a tulip glass with a very hazy orange color. I smell the alcohol and some spices. Big, juicy body that tastes of wheat and a hint of citrusy fruit. I can feel but not taste the alcohol; it is nicely well-hidden. Hoppy but not as bitter as a typical IPA. Pleasant aftertaste where you can still taste the fruity wheat. This is a very delicious brew reminiscent of Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Double IPAs or other big/boozy/citrusy beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light- to medium-bodied with good carbonation. Delicious. Think Hitachino Nest White Ale, with more sweetness and more alcohol"
""
""
""
""
"O: Very delicious and much better than the previous Unplugged batch. Dan outdid himself with this one. I'll be picking up more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is sunshine in liquid form. Bright, fresh, sweet, bubbly on the tongue, fantastic. On a related note, Dan should really try brewing a batch of this with some lacto fermentation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Love NG Thumbprint series, Dan is the man! I am not a fan of the style but this is damn good beer."
""
"O - A Frankenstein of a Weizen, but very delicious. I bet Dan had fun brewing and drinking this one. What out for the ABV as you do not notice the alcohol."
""
""
"Wow, What a nice complex beer. You just can not go wrong with this beer... Even if you do not like Wheat beers I can see you liking this."
""
""
"Overall: It's an intriguing taste. Something that I may try again later on in the release cycle, but not something that I'm going to stock up on like their last two varieties."
"Very cool brew by Dan Carey. You can't pigeonhole this beer into any one single style. I feel like I'm drinking two different beers in one. Its very interesting and worth trying for any serious beer geek out here. Not sure I'd stockpiile bottles of it as I can't imagine this beer to age very well- one, its a hefeweizen, and two, its been dry hopped. So drink it now while its fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was impressed that this did not get syrupy or cloying given the high ABV, but Hefes definitely have a ceiling in my book."
""

"I have to confess, this bottle was alleged to be 2 years old. I cant confirm that, but the expectation on my end here is that a fresh one of these would be wonderful (as the bottle itself suggests), but an older one just doesn't maintain. this one poured a really cloudy pale yellow color with an average white bubbly head. the nose is vanilla and cinnamon, with some honey sweetness and more alcohol than I am used to in wheat beer. my girlfriend loved the flavor, thought the spice and sweet combination was fantastic. I liked it less, with the spice being a little overdone, and the wheat malt sort of having a deteriorated flavor to it, not as fresh and clean as it might have been. it lost its ability to support the other flavors, which don't seem to have diminished at all. the feel came across a little thin, and the alcohol was piercing. new glarus does some wonderful stuff, and im sure a bottle right off the line of this would rectify that viewpoint, but this beer (however old it really was) just did not get it done. way out of balance, weird yeast properties, and just sort of all over the place. I will have to revisit this one when I can verify its source and birthday."
""

"Golden orange colour, about a finger of white head, a little bit of lace as well. Smell is quite hoppy, big pineapple and orangey citrus notes, malty and wheaty character, lots of hops in this one though. Taste has a wheaty character mixed with plenty of hops, orange, tangerine and pineapple, fairly bitter throughout, touches of honey, lightly sweet in the finish with a bit more wheat, hoppy aftertaste. Medium body, medium carbonation, lightly dry. A solid hoppy wheat beer and really drinkable despite this not being quite what I expected."
""
"Poured with the yeast, golden orange body with an offwhite head and light lacing + retention. Hoppy nose, wheat, citrus/grapefruit/pineapple and definite weizen yeast character. Taste is bitter, hoppy, yeasty, with more pineapple and tropical fruit notes. Some canned pineapple juice character comes to mind. Quite nice, would love to try this fresh on draught."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is good on the whole, but it needs some tweaks as far as the yeast is concerned."
"an excellent beer coming from someone who isn't all that crazy about wheat beers. Very citrusy, delicious and extremely refreshing."
"O: This was a pretty complex Imperial Weizen. Lots of spice from the yeast and a nice sweetness to balance. I really like this one."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden straw color, thick and fluffy white head, long lasting. Scent brings a big whiff of lemon grass and orange rind along with big notes of banana bread, some bubblegum, black pepper and yeast. Taste is big and bold, nice hop notes combine with amped up wheat beer flavors, touch of alcohol. Medium bodied, light chunkiness, mostly dry and slightly warming. Really solid beer all around, nice touch of hops on nose and tongue. Amazed at the ABVs on this one, noticeable but still well hidden."
""
""
"O: This is a very nice beer that really turns up the volume. Intense, yet still enjoyable, though I do wish the alcohol was either toned down or better hidden."
"O- not a huge fan of this one. Hefeweizen on steroids. Not my cup of tea"
""
""
""
""
"o - damn, this is stupendous and incredibly dangerously drinkable. so complex and lip-smacking good."
"O - Solid body makes the lemon more muted, but still keeps a good balance."
""
""
""
"O- This is good although slightly more hoppy then I would really ever like a weizenbock to be, personally. The smell is phenomenal and deep down under the mask of the cascade dry hopping there really is a delicious weizenbock to be found. While I may not understand why it is that New Glarus has chosen to add hops to so many of their unplugged brews lately I can honestly say that this isn't the worst one. Definitely won't have any problem polishing this 4 pack off. The high ABV is also a real added bonus. Overall a good beer."
""
""
"Beer is nice, medium to light in body, clean finish, overall a nice beer, nothing too exciting or surprising but it is a solid weizenbock, nice fruit flavors on the midpalate, a nice finish, a little bitter not overly so. I'd have it again."
"Pours a fairly-cloudy bright yellow-golden with a short white head and a spot or two of lacing on the way down. The nose has quite a bit of sweetness combined with some banana, clove, and a touch of spice. The flavor is fairly boozy with some spice and residual sweetness. Too much malt sugar remaining here, IMO. Body is a bit thicker than I'd like with some extra alcohol. I prefer NG's lower-abv German wheat offerings."
"The beer is cloudy and straw yellow hued with an inch of dense, white head. The aroma offers a healthy serving of banana, with some wheat And lemons coming in behind. The flavor does not live up to the promise of the aroma. A bit soapy, and alcohol presence, which was absent in the aroma, asserts itself in the flavor profile. Lemon zest and window cleaner. Not horrible, but also not a repeat for me. Medium bodied with an odd astringency. Aventinus is still the go to weizenbock for me."
""
""
"D - another solid offering in the unplugged/thumbprint series. NG has a knack for killing German styles, and they delivered yet again."
""
"A decent brew that I would like to have again, but it'd need to be in a much fresher form for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden/Amber color with a tight fizzy white head. Has excellent lacing. Aroma is mostly citrus and Clove. Tastes of Banana, little bit of hops, citrus fruit, with some sort of funkiness. That must be the ""Imperial"" part of the beer. Sweet throughout with a little resiny aftertaste. Smells and tastes even more like bubblegum as it warms, crazy. Very good, very complex, very drinkable."
""
"O - This stuff is unreal and if ever presented the opportunity, you best not hesitate. A dangerously drinkable ale, full flavoured and scrumptious."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This was pretty good overall, but as far as NG beers go, I'll stick to Dancing Man, if I'm looking for something in and or around the weizen style."
""
""
"Bottle courtesy of adneilsen (thanks Aron) poured a cloudy gold with a lasting creamy white head. Aromas of wheast, yeast, banana, light bubblegum and a hint of clove. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of wheat, yeast, banana, light clove and light alcohol with a crisp warming lingering banana finish."
"I'd call it a higher strength version of Dancing Man. Very good overall, but I might just stick with the D.M. in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $10.99 for a four pack (add a few extra dollars if you bought it at the gas station)."
"I have had the last bottle of the 4 pack in the fridge for a while. Poured into a pint glass during an American football game, the beer was a golden orange color. A mildly bitter aroma tickled the nose before yielding to a more fruity aroma. Initial taste was a sweet banana and cinnamon flavor that melted into a hot and warming bitter hoppy aftertaste. Notes of citrus are also hidden among the flavors. This is a very smooth beer in terms of the mouthfeel, which is somewhat surprising when the high alcohol content is considered. At 9.6%, this is a potent beer. While it is a warming beer, the smoothness suggests that it could also serve as an easy drinking summer beer. This is a well balanced, tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Pretty good, but I prefer most of NG regular wheat beer options to this. It pales in comparison to Dancing Man and Laughing Fox."
"Overall: I would have liked a bit less alcohol in this one. The other flavors were good. Don't know that I would go back."
"Serving type: Bottle poured into Sam Adams Boston Lager Pint"
""
""
""
"Overall I didn't think this was too bad. I am really not a fan of Wheats or Hefe's but this one went down a bit more tasty. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this sample."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - I must say this is a very fine beverage and extremely enjoyable. I for one can't stand banana in my beer and this has so much else going on that I almost forget it's there. Absolutely amazing craftsmanship to bring so many flavors together in balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, with less hoppiness this would be amazing. As it is, the hops mask the qualities I look for in a weizenbock, or any weizen beer."
"O. Not bad for the high alcohol present in this weizen, but overall this leaves me looking for a little more smooth and balanced beer in the end."

"o - overall, damn fine beer. really solid weizenbock. a bit boozy, but it works with the flavoring. bubblegum booze...ah, nice mix."
"D/O: This beer must have shared a similar conceptual origin to that of Stone's 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA, such as ""Let's make an extreme version of a classic style."" This imperial hefeweizen is equal to the success of the afore-mentioned Stone brew, showing massively amplified versions of on-point traditional qualities. If any weizen enthusiast ever wished to be able to smell and (especially) taste the qualities of the style more, then this is the beer for them. It is held back only by its heaviness, either real in the form of the syrupy texture, or perceived in the form of its restrained acidity and carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: This beer is really the best of both worlds for fans of IPA's and Weizens. The extra hopping really adds a lot to this Weizen style, and I would love to see this as a regular beer in the New Glarus lineup! Well done, New Glarus!"
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this imperial weizenbock from new glarus, but I was pleasantly surprised. Major apple and appleskins lay beneath a spicey weizenbock. A little bit of pumpkin seeds and basil mixes in. Nice complexity and bold flavor. My applause to NEw GLarus, and to klikger!"
"Rating: 87 out of 100"
"O: Unlplugged winner!"
"Overall, a good beer, but like I said, the flavors fell a bit flat and didn't match up with the nice aromas."
"O - a fantastic combo of hefe and hops, its a big beer in flavour and alcohol but is very easy drinking,"
"Overall: This is a great beer. If you love wheat beers, but want one when it’s 30 below and you’re tailgating at the Packers game, this one will keep you company. Another hit out of this cult brewery from north of the Cheddar Curtain."
"Weizen, yes. Imperial, definitely. This beer demonstrates how to put the imperial in a style."
"O - a nice beer that is dangerously drinkable considering the alcohol level."
"M: Good, creamy but not heavier, but heavier than a hefe. I could dub this an imperial hefe no problem in that regard."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly lower carbonation level than expected. Very drinkable. Overall, this is a great brew. Everything works together to creat a complex, refreshing and drinkable brew. It all works together just the way it should. Definitely impressed here."
"O-This one shows its ABV to a fault. The mouthfeel is a little sharp, and the spiciness is over the top. Not my favorite Unplugged beer. I give them credit for trying. This is a tricky style to do well, and this is a decent effort."
"O: I'm digging this beer. I don't know if I'd go after it again, but it's solid."
"Pours a beautiful orange gold with a pillowy white 2 finger head that lingers nicely. Aromas pouring from the head of this beer, spicy, phenolic, ginger comes off strongly to me with a hint of yeast, reminds me of a belgian. A lot of flavors here, berry and banana, ginger, spicy and phenolic, sweet with a slight bitterness to the finish. Has a nice creamy medium body, a little sticky on the tongue, finishes a bit tart and dry. Not a session beer by any means, meant to be sipped, otherwise it is a little cloying and overpowering. I really liked this, really out there for a Hefe, well done."
"Style-defying, flavorful, and maybe a bit excessive in the ABV department (though never fusel/solventy) - tastes almost like a cocktail of some sort, albeit one with a base of traditional Hef and home-made bitters..."
"If you like Fin Du Monde. This is very similar, but better!"
"Nuzzling up to perfection. What an uber hop weizen a la American style. Absolutely slammed the Belgians here. Poured with a huge foamy, frothy, off white head and great lace. Aroma is banana, yeast, bubblegum, malt, hop, Flavor is largely like nose, plus yeast bitterness leaps out along with sweetness of the malts and propelled by the alcohol. Body is outstanding and ditto carbonation- couldn't be exceeded. Finish is like flavor and lingers with diminishing presence to a point where I can't find the point only that I want another point. The occurance of excellence."
"Pours a hazy gold with big head and excellent retention. Smell is banana, clove, spice and a hint of earthy, citrus hops. Creamy thick mouthfeel with a clean finish. Taste is banana, clove, and cinnamon giving way to earthy hop bitterness with just a hint of citrus. Leaves a combination of both on the tongue. Very interesting and well executed, probably one of the best wheat beers I've ever had. Have had many before reviewing it and while it doesn't taste quite as good as when I first had it, this is an excellent, balanced beer."
"Really interesting take on the style, but I've always been of the opinion that heffes are too delicate of a style to flood with a high ABV. Something about the overwhelming alcohol presence just doesn't quite do it for me on this one. Although, don't get me wrong, this is still a hell of a beer, just not the hefeweizen I prefer, Cheers!"
"This one pours a nice cloudy, tinged gold in color with great turbidity. The aromas are moderately sweet, full of banana, clove, and it has a nice lemon zest aroma that is really interesting. The flavor is somewhat sweet and ultimately spicy. It is very heavy on banana, clove, spices, lemon, and oranges. I don't know if I've had a hefe quite like this one before. It's very, very complex. The lemon and orange are something completely new to me in regards to a hefe. It finishes light and smooth. You'd have no idea that there is 9.6% abv. It is so, so smooth and very easy to drink. This is a deceiving drinker. Overall this is a very, very nice beer and a very interesting hefe. This one is a legitimate success. Well done NG."
"O: All things considered, very tasty brew. A bit boozy, but I really like it. Definitely different for the style, but it goes down quite smooth and I really liked the complex flavors/spice. Great job!"
"O: great effort on this one by new glarus. Took a weizen, blended its sweetness perfectly with dry hopped bitterness. The cinnamon was the perfect ingredient to bring something completely different out of this."
"Overall, I like the attempt of a hopped up hefeweizen, but its not for me. The citrus hops and bavarian wheat yeast flavors just clash to me. Glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't get it again. I'd take a Dancing Man over this anyday."
"All in all a must try for anybody who is looking for a little creativity along with classic weizen flavors."
"Overall, an exceptional brew and right up there with their Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. Highly recommend. This goes down smooth and with a ton of flavor. Not avail in here TX, dammit, but got one from ummagum. If avail near me, this would be in heavy, heavy rotation. [H;Y]"
"I very enjoyable beer that I would like to drink again."
"O: I didn't go into this with the highest hopes: big wheat beers are usually too sweet and too thick for my tastes. However, this is a really solid, big wheat beer that walks a fine line between American innovation (making shit bigger!) and German restraint. Yet another well-done beer from NG."
"Overall it's an interesting beer and yet another of the enigma series that's well worth having."
"D: This was a very nice weizenbock. Not sure why it's listed as a hefe on BA. The scent and taste were hoppy but still enjoyable and fitting for the style (similar to Little Sumpin Extra). Great body and not too hot, so it was pretty easy to drink. Not mind blowing, but still recommended."
"O: does the world need an imperial hefe? Sure, why not. Sometimes more is not necessarily better. The lily has been gilt. It is a looker, though."
"Soft, golden orange in color, floral notes accompany banana. In your mouth the banana and slight cloves come alive with vanilla and a evasive but creamy body. A slight sweetness balances out the whisps of ethyl presence. This is perhaps the most balanced, complex and compelling of the NG portfolio I have tried."
"Overall: This brew throws the gauntlet down, be ready to take this beer on as it is not for the faint of palate. Of course for me I took it one big sip at a time, not wanting to finish it took quick ... trying to savor but wanting another sip right away."
"Mouthfeel: This beer has that nice lingering effect that allows the flavor to stick around nicely."
"O: This is a nice beer. It was special. Isn't that special? Seriously, though, I enjoyed it start to finish and recommend it for those who want to expand beyond a classic Hefeweizen."
"O: decent"
"I understand this is a bit of an experiment as it is a completely new style of brew, but one of Dan's weaker ones unfortunately. Hops + Weissbier is a hard thing to get right, Dan should try some Schneider for reference."
"O: A very ambitious and interesting beer by Mr. Carey. Yet again he seems set on making only one style of beer... His own. 4.5/5"
"Light to medium body with a sharp fine carbonation that pricks your tongue as you drink."
"Cheers!"
"D/O - Drinkability is high. This is a refreshing and easy-drinking beer that is perfect for summer. Almost dangerous given how much alcohol is in this, which although it lets off some heat, is nowhere near the level it is. Sip carefully, but don't be afraid to indulge!"
"Awesome beer right here. A true representation of the style on an imperial level. I will have to find some more of this one!"
"What an accomplishment. Despite coming from WI I haven't had any of the unplugged series before because I was so umimpressed by New Glarus' regular offerings. This beer, along with the unplugged IIPA have really changed my opinion of the brewery. I would recommend this beer both to Weizen lovers and to fans of bigger beers who might find some likeness in it to a Belgian IPA, albeit with a more German ester profile."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and pleasantly carbonated. An absolutely fantastic American representation of a classic German style."
"This one reminds me of your grandma's upside down cake, but right out of the oven with homemade butterscotch and ice cream."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours very hazy orange/yellow with nice lacing white head. Aroma is perfect, notes of clove and cinnamon, some nice banana, tropical fruit, and citrus notes from the dry hopping, with slight notes of even some pine and grass. Taste is a bit less potent, but has notes of banana, tropical fruit, yeast and some slight honey, pine, clove, and some sweet fruit finishes with a touch of grainy biscuit. Very nice hefeweizen, balanced, not too sweet. I much prefer the Dancing Man Wheat over this one."
"Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a large fluffy cream colored head of foam on it. Scent is heavy with wheat and sweet citrus. Taste is really full of flavor for a Hefeweizen with complex wheats mixed nicely with coriander and a slight lemon zest. Quite a heavy hitter for a Hefeweizen but rather well made as per usual with New Glarus beers!"
"The 9.6% ABV is very well hidden and you could fool me if you told me that was the percentage on it. It’s smooth and crisp and really thirst quenching. I know banana and cloves are in there from the smell, so try it you'll like it! Cheers!"
"D/O- Hefeweizen isn't my most widely tried style by a long-shot but I'd put this right at the top of any I've ever had. Another winner in the New Glarus Unplugged/Thumbprint portfolio."
"O: Good flavors and aromas, though a bit too big to drink a ton of. Nice beer."
"O. This beer started out very strong with the exceptional color and amazing aroma. The flavor didn't quite live up to it for me. Felt like it was a little muted. Don't get me wrong this is a very good beer, but I was expecting a complex array of flavors that I don't feel was really there. I will say that this might be the smoothest 10% beer I have ever drank."
"This is an unusual beer, and a good one."
"*Also, a point of interest about this beer is that it doesn't age well at all, extended aging anyway. Despite it's high ABV and BeerAdvocate's, ""not a style to age unless alcohol exceeds ABV range"" (which I'd say it does) my disapproving review of a 4-year-old bottle was removed, flagged by someone obviously upset by the score despite the caveat. The aged review garnished a C-. Moral of the story, don't hang on to this one for a while."
"O: I'm always excited to see an Unplugged offering from New Glarus. In this case, I drank the first three in the pack celebrating out on the lake. It was refreshing then, and refreshing now. During a sitdown review, I find that it drinks very young. The combination of strong, boozy, waxy lemon flavor dominates this beer and either seems unfinished, or needs time to mellow."
"Not really sure about the style categorization here. This is more of a APWA than a hefe. It's big, no doubt. Kind of wish I sat on it, as it feels like it could stand to mellow out. One bottle is fine for me. Just too much citrus for my tastes, though I appreciate the effort to do something new. Definitely haven't had a wheat beer like this before."
"Overall - That's one heck of a beer. They don't come much bigger and bolder."
"#4 in our recent (and inadvertant) New Glarus tasting. Shared with schmittymack (thanks FrankenBrew). Poured a hazy golden color with a huge, rocky, white head. Aromas of spice, clove and bananas. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of clove, brown spice and banana."
"This is quite an interesting brew from New Glarus. I'm not sure if I'm digging it or not. As an experimental brew, it's excellent, but I feel that the high gravity hurts the beer more than it helps. Dropping the ABV would help this beer IMO and would make it an excellent summer drink. This beer makes me long for Crack'd Wheat, which I'm so pissed that they retired this year; it was my favorite beer from them."
"O- awesome beer, really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: I love the style, but wish the alcohol was as well hidden in the flavor as it is in the aroma. I will gladly drink it, though — albeit slowly and responsibly. It packs a huge punch."
"Many of the micro brewies that put out there Hefe's could learn alot from this stuff. However, this being an obvious ramped up version of what the norm would be; all Hefes need to be like this, then it would be a style I can actually like. This stuff ""Unplugged", is awesome!"
"Pours a classic hazy honeyed golden brown with a thick two fingers of head thqt holds its form through the entirety of the beer. Nose has odd ethyl/chemical aroma up front along with rubber and maybe light clove and banana if i trick myself into believing its there. Banana malt character with an upleasing hop bitterness and my rubber smell can now be better described as a burning plastic taste - really not good stuff and im thinking my bottle is just off based on previous reviews. Whats left of the oftputting taste really just destroys any points gained on the mouthfeel - this beer or bottle is just really really bad - if i didnt want to feel the abv this is a drain pour for sure."
"Overall, they were close on this one. The look smell of this beer are by far it's best attributes. Kinda just slowly goes down hill from there, but I still enjoyed it, cheers!"
"Overall, very interesting and exactly what the label claims, a strong weizen. Great aromas and great flavors. Very high alcohol for a wheat."
"DELICIOUS, GET THIS BEER!"
"Thanks again Justin!"
"Overall I'm not a big fan of this one. I feel that if you make an imperial version of some beer that usually isn't high alcohol it should be close in taste but with higher alcohol. Probably won't seek this one out."
"(D)- Move over Belgian IPAs! Granted this is a classified as a Hefeweiss, however I am torn if this is more that or a Belgian IPA. Tastes great as a Hefeweiss on steroids, yet I would without a doubt put this up there with the best Belgian IPAs any day of the week. It just portrays each part beautifully while maintaining balance and a smooth, yet crisp and refreshing profile. This is a dangerous beer at 9.6%! Further proof that New Glarus makes the finest wheat beers in the country."
"Overall, this beer steps on some boundaries. Then there's the high potency. New Glarus produces a lot of ho-hum mainstream beers, but its limited runs are often inspired. This could be the best one yet."
"O - The alcohol is well-hidden here. Smooth, great nose. Yet its not a brew I'd have often, I'd really have to be in the mood for it. Solid"
"The unplugger Imperial Weizen is amber in color with nice neat thin white head. The aroma is powered by clove and hints od spice. The taste is very good, and follows the aroma of clove and spice...and backed with a heavy abv. The mouthfeel is ok for as high of abv as this beer is packing....but wowzer...no way to session."
"Overall it is a pretty unique strong beer the strong yeasty flavor and the strong hoppy bitterness is not for everyone but I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall I really liked this one. I'd love to put down a bunch of these on a warm summer day. To me, the ABV is well hidden so I suppose it will catch up with you after a few."
"649"
"Overall I'm glad this beer was re-released. I was just getting heavily into craft beer when it first came out and it's very similar to what I remember, a deceptively high gravity fairly traditional hefeweizen."
"O - While the brew is solid, I am not crazed over it due to the overly bitter character, noticeable alcohol, and my personal disdain for a particular element of the aroma."
"O- this wasnt my favorite of the unplugged series so far. i think that might be because hefeweizens arnt meant to get this big. i appreciate the chance to try it, i might try another one a little down the road to see what time has done to it."
"I like this beer. A lot. It's really really good. Fantastic balance of wheat, hop, and yeast flavors. And frankly, I can't believe the ABV is as high as they say it is. Except that I haven't finished the glass yet, and I can already feel it."
"Pours a murky honey orange color with a 2 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Chunky spots and rings of lacing coat the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour apples, cloves, cinnamon, and some bubblegum. Taste is of wheat, banana, bubblegum, the spices (clove and cinnamon), with a slight citrus twang on the finish. Good carbonation on this one makes for a crisp and clean feel. Overall, this is a good American made hefeweizen with all the classic smells and tastes."
"O- 4-4.5 of the wheat beers i have had from NG, i would say dancing man or cracked wheat might be better, but it depends on the night. this seems sort of like a double cracked wheat with less hops and a hit of bubblegum."
"An excellent brew. Cascade may be heresy to hefe purists, but it is used to good effect here. I hope this one comes back around in the unplugged series periodically. Until then, I'll have to stock up."
"Doesn't reach the heights of its cousin Dancing Man, but this is a tasty, tasty hefe. Very good beer, & one more reason to pop open a New Glarus. Keep 'em coming."
"D: Wow, definitely a one time beer in an evening (or brunch) but its a great example of an imperial version."
"O: this is a good escape from a light weizen, just as a DIPA is a nice escape from an ipa. The basic aspects of this are great, and this is an excellent beer overall. If they ever make a regular weizen, I will stock up on that plenty. 4.0"
"Overall: Overall a decent take at the Hefeweizen that would be outstanding if the taste didn't have an alcohol burn (although it is an imperial). Would like to see what they would do with a 4-5% version."
"Overall: This is a really good beer! I have never had an Imperial Weizen before, but this was an exceptional beer. Another solid New Glarus beer!"
"Not to bad overall, a fun giant hefe."
"A very flavorful brew, with interesting spice character. Would be great with seafood. Very nice."
"Poured into a pint glass. Big white head with a cloudy dark yellow color. Smell is mostly citrus and banana with a little clove. Reminiscent of orange juice. Sweet orange banana taste with alot of alcohol. Some hop bitterness at the middle through finish. Tough to give a good opinion since I. Have nothing to compare it with. I'd say interesting beer but I don't see me having it again."
"O: Way too hoppy for my taste. I love heffes like no other but this one is just a bit strange for me."
"the CPJ"
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Looks quite nice. A swirl and a deep sniff reveals alcohol, candy banana, and cloves. Maybe even just a touch of citrus hops. Kind of a weird balance of smells in a Weiss beer. The taste is strong wheat, big clove spiciness, monster banana and finishing hops that bring a bit of a citrus component and help dry the finish a touch. Don't get much of that boozy component from the nose. It's all a bit big and a little imbalanced. Some sips draw me in and make me feel like the beer is something special, others are just somehow out of whack. Big carbonation with a sugary mouthfeel. The sugar just hangs out in the mouth well after the beer is gone. It's pretty unfair to compare this to the balance and restraint of a successful Weiss beer. This is a really interesting experiment that has some success, but needs a bit more work. The hops don't balance the sweetness enough, for starters. That said, I really enjoyed tasting the experiment."
"This unplugged beer pours a cloudy orange-straw color with a very thick, clingy bright white head. The aroma is an inviting mixture of spicy notes from the yeast, sweetness from the malts and lemony citrus from the hops, truly showcasing all elements of a beer. The flavor is an intense burst of spicy cloves and citrusy hops, those flavors linger and the beer finishes a bit tart, slightly dry, and the weight of the alcohol pokes through without overwhelming. The carbonation is high and body medium-full. Overall a wonderful beer, if you see it, buy it -- period."
"Overall, I can see how this could be a polarizing beer. I wish more weizens went the hoppier route, and I'm probably in the minority preferring Cracked Wheat to Dancing Man, but this creature is alright. A bit of a Frankenstein, but don't we all feel he got a bad rap?"
"O:This is a very bold Hefeweizen, with a nice change up with the use of dry hopping. Overall, one of the best imperialized versions of the style. Very well done."
"First time trying an imperial weizen. I'm usually not the biggest wheat beer fan but I really enjoyed this one. I think because it was more complex than most that I have had. While I will definitely drink this again, it's heavy enough that I wouldn't drink two in one sitting."
"O- a tasty hefe for sure ..but i would choose dancing man or cracked wheat b4 this one..still this is a great one from NG"
"Though it's a strong beer it's hard not to want to enjoy more than one! Surprisingly light body and very refreshing! WoW!!! Go go New Glarus! :)"
"O - Another incredibly well made beer from New Glarus, and up there with some of the best big wheat brews I have ever had. Drinks far too easily for the ABV, but that really makes it what it is; A Bold, Fresh, and Complex weizen. Cant wait to seek it out on tap!"
"M. A little bit to thin for my liking, the only meaningful complaint I have. The body needs some more...oomph."
"drinks very well for 9.6%. booze is very mellow."
"D- This is a decent brew, that with age, is reminding me more of a belgian tripel (american interpretation) than a german ale. Its quite boozy but complex enough to be enjoyable. Not sure what this was like fresh-right now it is decent, but not the best NG brew out there."
"D- This is a well made imperial beer. I would only be able to drink a couple of these. Still would have liked a couple more for the cellar. I will be looking forward to them maybe making this again...are you listening New Glarus??"
"D - You can start feeling the higher ABV about halfway through the bottle, so I can't imagine having more than a couple of these. Still, I hope they make this again or better still introduce an Imperial Crack'd Wheat with this recipe."
"Well done, New Glarus!"
"D - Unfortunately the alcohol was a big detractor from the drinkability of this brew. It would have been much better had it not been for the huge ABV, or had it been masked a little better. Still worth trying a bottle though."
"This one just has a bit too much heat for the style to give it good drinkability. I'm definitely glad I got to try it though."
"Drinks pretty, easy one I like, but don't love..."
"Taste is very fruity with apricot and hops. Mouth feel is a little weak for a wheat beer but that might be cause of the ABV. Drinkability is lower due to strong apricot which did not appeal to me. Still a fine beer just not my liking. Not characteristic of other wheat beers."
"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with mikesgroove, thanks again Mike, drinking it right now from my Bull and Bush mug, color is a lighter golden orange, big two inch white fluffy head that has lasted over ten minutes, good retention, some lacing at the top, aroma consists of booze, wheat, candied sugar, clove, ginger, peppermint, grassy accents, lemons, and sweet malt, taste starts off with malty sweetness, spices in the middle and chewy wheat too, finish is strong with a big alcohol kick, becomes even harder to drink as it warms with too much booze shining through mixed with overly sweet malts, need more spice for it to really work, sweet, boozy, and spicy mouthfeel, high level of carbonation, taste lingers a very long time, you can taste every drop of alcohol in this one, not hidden at all, heavy on the stomach, not smooth, cannot say this my favorite from the Unplugged series by any means, a little over the top in my opinion, would not drink again, worth trying"
"This beer is clear (clearer than you'd expect a hefe to be), medium-to-dark copper color, with a really thick poofy head and lots of lace. It smells a little sour, hoppy in a Belgian way (which reminds me of Urthel Hop-It), no banana nor clove. The taste is the same as the aroma, a subdued sour flavor under a strong hops presence that's more Belgian than German or American in my humble opinion. Fairly thick body for the style, maybe a 7.5 on a 1-10 scale from water to oil. Not tasty enough nor light enough to rate drinkability above a 3."
"This has probably been my least favorite of the Unplugged Series. One thing I should say is that I received the bottle as an extra in a trade about 5 weeks ago and have no idea how much age was put on it prior to getting it. The label says drink fresh so who knows if age has tainted my experience."
"pour is orange in a light murk. off white cream head with huge lace. extremely tight solid head. IPA like. smaller than a hef but very tight. actually it looks like some IPA's exactly. i'm a little pensive... nose is very unique. candied lemon zest hop, rotten banana, rotten mango. a perfect blend of palate between an hef and an american IPA. an american take on hoppiness... but an extremely balanced ester range. lemon acid, candied pineapple sweetness, wheat banana sweetness, herbal quality, pepperiness but also bland sweet wheat effect. quite strong in alcohol actually. smooth but i think an indecipherable 7.5%. an excellent blend of the two styles. although the 'imperial' title takes away from the mellow drinkability of the beer. don't think i could take out more than one thinking i want a hef."
"Medium bodied and somewhat chewy and bready. Not really a hefe. The bottle says imperial weizen and it resembles that distinction more. Not a bad beer. A little sweet but a nice, aggressive bitterness is present as well. Tastes somewhat alcoholic so go easy."
"D - This is down right awesome. Certainly another hit from the unplugged series which has yet to yield a beer I have not liked, at least from what I have tried thus far."
"4.5/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"Drinkability: Not as good as Dancing Man Wheat, in my opinion, which is more of an ""Imperial Weizen," I do believe. This is nonetheless a phenomenal beer, complex, tasty, balanced, and high in abv% (minus on drinkability) without any sign of it (plus on drinkability). Seems precisely like something New Glarus would put out - fruity, full of wheat, and absolutely tasty. *Turns out this beer IS hopped with Cascades, dry-hopped even, which explains a lot of the stray citrusy hop notes I was getting. Kudos to Dan Carey for producing another beer that pushes the envelope."
"This is one of NG's unplugged triumphs, a terrific and unusual beer. The spiciness goes beyond what one normally expects of a weizen - cinnamon flavor, clove. Might be their own ""special strain of Bavarian Weiss yeast."" A fine beer."
"Very nice, the best of these unpluggeds so far, would like a case of this."
"Delicious."
"It say's they cut Dan Carey loose a few times a year to brew these unplugged brews, I say they should make it a monthly thing!!"
"So I opened this up and even the foil on the top puffed open from the carbonation. As I poured it I could smell the citrus/furity flavors. The aroma is extremely pleasant and I think I smell grapefruit? Regardless... very nice. It poured a golden orange with a solid head that lasted through the entire drink! The lace also was pretty to say the least. The taste is bitter and sweet, so as my recently maturing appreciation for hops combined with my love for a hefeweizen reached this beer, I found myself saying, ""this is genius!"" The mouth feel is strong and pleasant with the high carbonation and overall I have to say this is a new favorite! Thanks again, New Glarus, for brewing another awesome beer!"
"Drinkability: This beer is dangerously drinkable for its high alcohol content, not that I'm complaining of course."
"Mouthfeel is very soft, nice carbonation that moves the beer fluidly around the mouth. Light to medium bodied. Definitely drinkable. Really drinkable. Flavorful, good alcohol, balanced, refreshing and interesting. Back to Wisco soon!"
"this magnificent brew pours up a thick orange color with an off white head... the nose is composed of wheat, orange citrus, coriander... the taste is smooth and delicious!!! it tastes the same as the nose... full bodied, low carbo... Best Hefe ever!!!"
"Poured into my Westmalle goblet. Has a thick foamy white head and a rich golden body. Has aroma of yeast, wheat, banana and light malt. Flavour is wheat and banana with a lttle malt and spice, primarily clove. Very tasty and reminds me of the good Bavarian Weizens."
"D - This is a fascinating beer with incredible complexity. It's like no wheat beer I've ever had and quite a mix of various styles. I don't know if I could drink beer after beer of this, but I don't think that was the intention anyway. It is a treat and interesting experience."
"D - Complex flavor profile with lots of spicy and yeasty notes, but also plenty of sweetness and a pleasant hop character to boot."
"The drink is crisp and juicy with perfect cabonation and a fluffy, silken medium body that aids in giving NG's Unplugged Imperial Weizen great drinkability. From reading the bottle-blurb about the hops and hopping methods employed in the contruction of this beer, I'm sure it was really something to behold fresh, but even at a year old, the superb, flavorful beer is a masterpiece of brewing."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Pours a very cloudy golden with a huge head. Pretty big carbonation. Aroma is big hops, clove, citrus, bananna and sort of a new carpet smell. Flavor is very unique. Blasts of hops, citrus, pine, spice, bananna. It seems like each time you take a drink it is a rush of something different. Finish is sharp and bitter. This is Dancing Man on HGH!!!!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Triple Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a huge, rocky 4 finger head that leaves really sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is wheat (duh) up front, with bubblegum, banana, clove and what reminds me of possibly smoked wheat malts. The taste is much the same with banana and clove coming through but also contains quite a helping of citrus hops. Also the 9.6% comes through leaving a bit to much burn for my liking. The mouthfeel is a bit hot but goes down creamy, leaving a smooth sensation on the mouth. This is my first New Glarus beer, and if the rest live up to this one, I'll be in for a treat when I crack my second."
"Imperial Weizen came through in a huge way. Simply put, this is as intense (and as good) as a hefeweizen gets. Another outstanding product from a brewery that has never failed to impress me."
"Overall, quite a beer. Thanks, shbobdb, for the excellence."
"D= Style wise, this is a terrible hefeweizen, but I could care less because it is a delicious and complex ale. I can't wait to get more!"
"An example of an ""Imperial"" version that doesn't exactly work. The citrus flavors are really brought out here but it hinders the appearance of that nice Hefe clove-like spiciness, plus the sweetness should be milder. Interesting attempt, but overall unnecessary. I can't fault New Glarus for trying, but I would much prefer a Black Wheat, Dancing Man, or Copper Kettle Weiss."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very chewy. Good levels of carbonation and any alcohol is masked rather well. One of the better hefes I have had recently."
"Purchased at the NG Brewery late July of this year. Poured a semi-cloudy peachy yellow in my SA beer glass. Thick, two fingers of white froth...really pretty glass of beer. Supple aromas of lemon/lime pie. Flavors of fruit and banana wheat with a backbone of wheat body with a twinge of noticeable alcohol. Beautiful head retention and webbed lacing in the glass. Somewhat tart but a beautiful drinking big wheat bier. Hops detected in the finish, slightly sticking on the roof of my mouth. Glad I have 1 left."
"Sunset orange color with an initially large head that settles into a top coating film. Bold nose hints of banana, clove, spice and caramel, very enticing and memorable. Flavor is very nicely balanced, but doesn't quite have the softness and delicate notes I'd like. Very clove-like with the illusion of cinnamon spicing. Nice finish. Very nice ale."
"D-An interesting take on a classic style. Does it work, sort of...but not something I would hunt down. Certainly a well done brew, as all New Glarus beers are, but not something that needs to be revisited."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style but I think this beer is guilty of losing the essence of the style for the sake of going ""imperial", it's not a bad beer but it's not one that I'd choose again."
"Golden yellow with a creamy white head that leaves a spotty lacing around the glass and retains itself well. Smell is hoppy with plenty of fresh oranges in there. The aroma also holds some spices and a little cinnamon. Taste is of oranges, clove, lemon, and a little grapefruit. Medium body and carbonation; finish has a little alcohol bite to it. Pretty drinkable beer, though I don't know that I'd have more than two in an evening, if I were so inclined."
"Big thanks to grandq. Always happy to be able to try a New Glarus brew."
"Big ups to BA goethean for opportunity."
"Overall this silent and strong wheat beer won me over. I'm a staunch traditionalist when it comes to hefeweissen, but this one still keeps the faith while bringing on a lot of swagger. Beautifully bold and balanced, Mr. Carey really knows how to dress up a style and make it work. It's almost like someone blended a Weihenstephaner and a Chimay White! It works for me baby!"
"Dan Carey excels above and beyond when it comes to his wheat-focused beers. This and Dancing Man Wheat are the best New Glarus has to offer--in my humble opinion. It's a damn shame this is a one time only bottling, and a damn shame I didn't pick up more than one. I've finally enjoyed every beer I picked up at the brewery about 5 weeks ago, and this a fantastic note to end this little journey on. Please, Dan--unplug it year 'round!"
"D: This is very very drinkable stuff. Well done, New Glarus!"
"One note: BeerAdvocate says that this is a hefeweizen? It's wheatwine."
"I like the style, thank you Bakerslp for the trade. clove, cinnamon and citrus are claimed and in the mix, though I do not think they contributed to my liking it, (also bannana) but they did to the aroma. Very drinkable,if only I had a bomber to share, above average mouthfeel. Dark colour and good head."
"D: I don't know that the alcohol level is but it tastes strong. A fantastic creation that, because of the intensity of the hops, may limit you to two or three bottles (if you can score that many)."
"D-Glad to drink one but probably wouldn't reach for too many of these. Alcohol flavor detracts somewhat from drinkability."
"Pours a deeply cloudy yellow/orange peach with a uberfluff white head that leaves great lacing. Nose is very banana with some orange. Taste follows with a unique mix of german wheat flavor and some citrus notes, along with a fair amount of almost witbier like spice profile. Very interesting flavor. Mouthfeel is quite thick, Im not sure how to rate it for an ""imperial weizen"" but I would expect it to be thicker. Drinkability is pretty good, but I do feel the alcohol burn as it goes down. Overall a very unique and interesting brew. This is pretty much what I imagined for an imperial weizen, but Im not sure if it is a style i really like. Its good, but doesn't shock me into immeadiate appreciation. Try it. It will be worth it."
"Way to push the envelope Dan!"
"This beer pours a cloudy bright orange color. The head is a massive four inches in height, and recedes very slowly into two inches of foam. The aroma is banana, citrus, and hints of clove. The taste is more lively than the aroma. There is more banana, and less citrus. It is all around more wheaty than the aroma. There is also a mild alcohol burn in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with adequately high carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would certainly drink again."
"A fuzzy glowing straw gold colored body hosts a rocky off white head. Lots of lace is left behind. Nose has notes of mellon, crisp wheat and doughy bready tones. Big zesty wheat tones enter the mouth with a bang. Some sharp dry hop notes are mixed onto the back of the palate. Alchol is noticeable but not harsh. This definetly takes a wheat beer to the next level. Mouthfeel is oddly super thick and prickly. This takes points off of the drinkability."
"D: very drinkable brew and very creative. I enjoyed it alot and would love to get more of it."
"thanks to tayner for the chance to try this beer."
"Tastes odd and delicious, somewhere in between a strong belgian pale (due to the yeast), a really firm and fruity german hefe, and a regular old IPA. I--I really have to admit that I lack the brewing acumen to fully appreciate what an accomplishment a flavor like this is. The wheatmalt is, for the first time I can ever recall, so intense that it's sticky. The hops are gigantic. The fruit, of all things, balances everything out. And it's so creamy you'd think it had milk in it."
"It's not amazing, but I like what they did with this. It's unique and a good beer, but not something to revisit daily. I've just come to the conclusion that hoppy and wheat isn't a combo I really dig."
"easy to drink, easier than a straight wheat beer for me but probably wouldnt hunt it down again. if you gave me one I would drink it though."
"Thanks again Lordsloth"
"D - An extremely enjoyable offering from New Glarus. Goes down easy for what I would assume to be a high ABV weizen. Certainly worth seeking out."
"Clearly a derivative of a German Weizen and not nearly as funky as my description may lead one to believe; many of these flavors and aromas are noted particularly because they don't usually play a role in the typical German Weizen profile. An interesting beer, even if it doesn't quite work, and it doesn't seem to have that stripped out, filtered to death character that is typical of many New Glarus beers (not to say this isn't filtered, it may be, but it better survived the process than some of their other beers)."
"D: This is one damn fine hefeweizen!"
"I really like what New Glarus did with this. I just wish that all of that great flavor could have hidden a bit more of the alcohol. I'm not sure what the ABV of this was but between it and the sometimes flat feel, it become a bit stinging towards the botttom of the glass."
"This thing is wild. Lots of great flavors going on in here, but it skirts the border of being too much. There just might be a little excess hops on the nose and a little too sweet at the end to be perfect. Though wheat beers are what I drink all summer, the other three bottles might stay in the fridge till we get a cooler fall day and I feel like sipping something a little randy. Points for creativity."
"A huge letdown from NG."
"I had very, very high hopes for this, as it's my favorite style and one of my favorite brewers. And it started off nicely, but about midway through, that grapefruit and alcohol bite became just too much, drowning out the other characteristics. I drank the other three in the pack, and came away with the same impression. Bit disappointing, really."
"Pours a murky sunset orange with a full three finger off-white head that dies down to a layer of foam that lasts throughout. Beautiful rings of stick left on the sides of the glass with a continuous amouont of bubbles racing to the top. Smell is banana, clove, and citrus hops. Very interesting blend of aromas, but they work very well together. Taste begins with a musty clove followed by banana bread and sweet bubblegum. Citrus hops emerge midway with a strong yeast presence on the tongue. Aftertaste is somewhat dry and bitter with a bit of booze. Medium body with a feel that is just short of smooth. Carbonation is steady with this one as well. Not a fan of hefe's, but I'm not sure this can be categorized as such. The 9% abv is hard to find making this a pretty easy drinking brew and surprisingly refreshing. Definitely a hybrid of styles, dry hopping a hefe?...gotta love it!"
"Drinkability - a fantastic spin on a traditional style. A big tip o' the cap to mully for bringing me some of this at DLD08."
"D: It's very good, though it'd be more sessionable if it was a little lower in alcohol. Perhaps an India Weizen? I'd like to see some more of those..."
"I recieved this beer from a trade and I am happy I asked for it. This is a good tasting hefe that has a strong flavor but easy to drink. I can see why this was a once brewed release that is very popular."
"Well I had high hopes for this one but it is one dimensional, a flop really."
"D - goes down easy, smooth and refreshing."
"This is a really tasty brew. Big in all Hefe characteristics. Nice job."
"D - A slow drinking beer by far. It doesn't take much for the alcohol in this one to catch up with you. The filling body is also sits fairly heavy on me."
"Drinkability- This thing is tasty as hell! I didn't think a wheat beer with almost 10% ABV would be (or could be) this quaffable and tasty. The alcohol is a bit noticeable but definitely not a distraction. Tasty beer that needs to be seeked out by all before its gone!"
"Thanks to thickerfreakness for this one! Decanted from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a golden color with a thin, but extremely beautiful white head. Aromas of banana, pineapple, and some citrus from the hops. Very nice. Taste has big flavors of spice, banana, wheat, and some hop bitterness. Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability would be fairly high, if not for the off flavor I'm getting in the taste. Something about the hop bitterness that kicks in at the end, makes this beer less enjoyable. If it weren't for that, this beer would be excellent."
"D: Tasty but not overly drinkable. Drinkability is so extremely important in a Hefeweizen and this lets me down some. Also,the alcohol and mouthfeel just don't fit the style anymore. Not a bad brew but I guess I feel that weizen's probably shouldn't be made imperial."
"special edition. The time they'll move onto something completely different!"
"Medium amber, cloudy like most Hefeweizens, HUGE pillowy light tan head! Maybe even a little too much head if there can be such a thing. Waited for it to dissipate so I could pour more in the glass, but that bugger really stuck around! Aroma kind of reminded me of fresh air, which was a first for me. You know, the way it smells after a spring rain... Maybe with a little hops mixed in with the rain, though. Very pleasant. Quite a bit of alcohol taste and warming, which wasn't a surprise for an ""imperial"" beer. Very malty at first with some nice bitterness at the finish. Might be a little strong for my liking, but I have 3 more so I may grow to like it even more. Not bad, just not fantastic. Meduim carbonation with a bit of a heavy body."
"Bottle- golden hue with cloud white head and nice lacing. Nose- very spicy. tons of clove. Taste- overpowering spice, quite hot. Per label dry hopped with cascade- couldn't pick up any hops on the finish but perhaps contributes to the dryness in body. Finishes very dry, medium carbonation."
"D : One of the best American hefeweizens that I have ever had. Would love to have more."
"Imperial Weizen is the finest Unplugged beer that I have ever had. It's also at least the equal of the legendary Wisconsin Belgian Red and is the best hefeweizen that has ever entered my glass. Sorry Germany, but Dan Carey has just kicked your collective asses all the way to Dusseldorf and back. This is an outstanding ale that begs to be brewed again. I'd love regularly, but will settle for annually. Wow!"
"Tried the beer for the first time last night and being a long time fan of New Glarus and wheat beers in general my hopes were pretty high. Imperial Weizen pour with a very tall & lasting head, had to wait about 5 minutes before I could really dig into the beer. Wonderful taste - to me there were citrus tones, clove tones, and just good all around flavor. This is a ""limited edition"" beer but I really hope they bring it back again in the future."
"gift from my buddy Matt. thanks! Pours a sandy orange and holds a nice 1/4 inch head. Sticky lacing. Darker than a hefe or a wit, but not as dark as a dunkleweizen. Smells sourish and wheaty with notes of orange, cloves, obvious ethanol odor too. Taste is of orange rind, wheat, large amount of alcohol. Finish is dry and grapefruity with a hoppy bitterness. Boldness and ethanol quality somewhat overwhelming. Full bodied for the style, in so much as this can be called a style. An interesting beer, to be sure. I dont know how eagerly id set out to find it again though."
"100th review! Poured into my affligem goblet. Pous a hazy orange with a thin white head. Smells of yeast and slight bit of citrus. Tastes first of normal hefe flavors- clove, some banana etc. The difference in this hefe is the kick. Wonderful hop zestiness on the tongue. I get some bitterness with nice cinamon fizz to finish. Crisp mouthfeel for a hefe and incredibly drinkable. Wish I had some more!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a solid medium body. Quite enjoyable with just the right amount of carbonation that makes it go down smooth. A bit heavier than most hefe's but it's still refreshing and easily drinkable. An intriguing mix of flavors..I'm glad I grabbed a four pack, but I really don't think I could drink too much of this. Still, definitely worth a try. New Glarus can do no wrong with wheat beers!"
"Regardless... C-hops and weiss beer done the American way - there may be no better creation. Big props to swoopjones for the bottle!"
"definitely a very good beer, I'm glad I have more in the cellar."
"This is a very complex beer that is well-balanced. Outstanding drink when the mercury is up. It's very creamy and tastes light despite the high alcohol level. This is outstanding... I knew I should have grabbed more than one 4-pack!"
"Bottle courtesy of Oakbluff: Poured a cloudy beige color weizen with a big foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of spicy yeast with loads of cloves and wheat malt note. Taste is a mix between some cloves with some huge wheat malt note with a spicy yeast note at the end. Full body with limited filtration and some good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Really like this beer but thought it was a bit cloying at some point and maybe a less extreme version would have been more appreciated."
"Overall this was absolutely outstanding, and easily one of the best beers of any style I have ever had. There is something to say of a brewer taking a style like this and doing it right, that is no easy task for sure, but New Glarus has one me over with this one. Definitely a top notch beer and something that I would like to share with a certain person in the area, who may get a kick out of this one. If you can find it, seek this one out for sure!"
"Medium bodied, it has a nice, typical weizen taste, but a lot richer and satisfying. The only caveat here is the excessive heat; the alcohol is noticeable throughout, and a bit unpleasant at times. A bit less alcohol this might have been the best weizen, period."
"This beer is like the band Oasis, I had high hopes for it, but it is just my wonderwall."
"D- This is definitely an Imperial Hefeweizen. This beer started out perfect for me and started to drop off towards the end. The thick mouthfeel and lingering bitterness turn me off to this one a bit but I still enjoyed it very much."
"This is one interesting and unique brew. The more i drink the more i get used to and appreciate the blend of tradition and creativity that resulted in this tasty beer. Cant decide between a hefe or an IPA? No problem, drink this one, and then see how hard it is to stop at only one. The very clean and tasty hop flavours are downright amazing and make me wish for a simple IIPA from New Glarus. Its nice to see a brewer go out and make creative, tasty, and unique brews in their one off releases. If only more brewers would take note. Try this one and soon for the full hop effect. Highly recommended, and not only for the creativity of Dan Carey, but also for his tasty creation."
"HV"
"D- This is a wonderful beer. The perfume qualities remind me of some Belgian yeast strains and the hops are really matched well with the great Weizen qualities on top of some nice wheat wine notes. This beer went down smooth and was wonderful fresh. I don't think it will last long enough to age and I think it will also be a totally different beer without the hops."
"It's medium bodied, the carbonation starts of very lively but settles down after a while, and it finishes with another nice kick of clove, lemon, and banana. I'm really impressed with this souped up Hefeweizen and I give kudos out to New Glarus for brewing it, and Wasatch again for sending it my way!"
"Drinkability is limited by availability and your head. Easy to drink and session but it is sneaky so watch out!"
"D: This is certainly one of the better hefeweizens I've ever tasted. The spiciness is pretty big so the drinkability isn't quite what it could be. However, this is, without a doubt, the most complex brew I've ever tasted in this style. Highly recommended!"
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Pours nicely into a weiss glass - one plus inch thick head that laces nicely. Somewhat typical nose - a yeasty, hoppy, malty blend. I am having a hard time getting my mind around this beer's taste and overall drinkability - one sip a get greatness and the next a nice wallop of alcohol. I guess it is what it is - an imperial style weiss and as such, the alcohol will poke through. Enjoyable but not something I need to have a stock of in the fridge."
"This beer is part of New Glarus Brewing Company's series of Unplugged, limited edition beers. Thanks to danielphoran for sending this sample my way. Poured in to a Paulaner glass a glowing golden orange, with a 2 finger white head that shows some lasting power. Nose has traces of citrus and cream, and also a spicy hop character in the background. Taste starts off with the cascade hops pushing up front, followed by the citrus and cream, which is reminiscent of an orange creamsickle. Hops are oily enough to also make themselves known in the finish, making it a mix of bitter and sweet when all is said and done. Body is lively with cabonation, hop flavor, and many appealing tastes to go around. Drinkability suffers a bit for me with this one with the alcohol, although I suppose that is the point of an Imperial Weizen. Still, I like my Weiss brews to be drinkable, imperial or not. That being said, this is a great brew to have one or two of. Reminds me a bit of Southern Tier's Uber Sun beer, which is also very good. One to seek out. Cheers"
"D: Up the drinkability, this one goes down well if you love hops."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"On the palate the mouthfeel is creamy and fine-bubbled, excellent. There are a lot of flavor sensations, with some fruity sweetness, strong citrusy bitterness and a hint of the wheat sourness. Complex, delicious, you taste something different in each sip--never tire of coming back for more. Alcohol perfectly integrated, never apparent. Outstanding."
"Thanks, Atron67, for the opportunity"
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew"
"Golden straw, moderate carbonation, huge head which falls very slowly...Massive scents. Spice, banana, clove, cinnamon...but I'm getting hops. Citrusy grapefruit for the most part. A bready character as well. Taste is much of the same. Most of the usual flavors come into play. It's quite spicy up front. Cinnamon, clove, some banana and bubble gum. Hops come in with grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Big wheat bread. Creamy, slightly bitter. Quite enjoyable. Not as easily drinkable as your typical but still unbelievable. It's a little bigger than the norm but just as drinkable all things considered. A very interesting take on the style and while it's huge it works. Easily a favorite and one that stands out from the pack."
"This beer poured into a pint glass has a awesome sunset orange color with a creamy tan head leaving nice lacing on the glass. The smell is fruitful with citrus and clove prevalent. The taste is extremely complex, but not messy. The fruits are upfront, orange, lemon, and kiwi come to mind. The finish is bitter with the hops coming through. This is a fantastic brew, too bad they only come in 4-packs, six would have been nice!"
"Decently drinkable, considering the alcohol content."
"I suspect the alcohol is closer to 10% than 5% so it limits consumption. Definately not a Hefeweizen you will be drinking a lot of in an evening."
"Ovr: Others have said it, NG has a way with fruit beers and wheat beers. It's a great style. Paradoxial in what you would typically think of a highly quaffable wheat beer, but it's a nice break from that. Spring is a great time for this one, when it's cool but nice and sunny."
"Complex and thick enough for a sipper, even with the clean nature of its taste. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: Pretty exciting for wheat!"
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger white foamy head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice touch of banannas, cloves, some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, with some banannas/cloves tones, with caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, another nice one from NG."
"This beer looks pretty typical for a hefeweizen. It pours a nice hazy orange and has a very nice off white head that lasts for quite a while. The smell is pretty expected except for that amazing citrusy hop coming through past the banana and clove. Wow the taste of this is something else. It hits with banana and clove flavors and then the most amazing hop bitterness I've ever had in a wheat beer. This is one hell of a beer. Highly recommended."
"Oh man, the Unplugged series of beers keep knocking my socks off time and time again. High quality and affordable, accessible and original. I'd drink this all of the time."
"This NG brew probably fits into the same style as the Schneider-Brooklyner Weiss. Both weizens are heavily dry-hopped and are new interpretations of the style. Kudos to New Glarus for trying new things with the Unplugged series. I wish more breweries would do the same!"
"old scores 4.5, 5, 45, 5, 45"
"New Glarus does a great job with everything, but especially their wheat beers. Although hefes aren't my favorite style this is another good one although maybe a touch over the top. I've fallen in love with their Unplugged Series!"
"Overall I love the nose on this...and the taste is pretty unique if not particularly memorable. I like it but I wanted to like it more. I prefer the Dancing Man wheat immensely over this but this is definitely a ""must try"" and efforts like this are one of the reasons I feel NG is Wisconsin's best brewery."
"Overall drinkability is pretty high, although the obvious high ABV is the only thing keeping me from rating this as my first 5.0 review. It's just too strong to drink much of, but still, one of the best beers I've had in a long time. And definitely the best hefeweizen I've ever had. Believe the hype on this one, and get some before it's gone!"
"This was a really nice beer, another good addition to the always interesting, sometimes great ""Unplugged"" collection from New Glarus. Traditional hefe flavors of clove and banana with a bit more warming alcohol and much stronger hop presence, with a lot of Cascade hop flavor in the beer. I wouldn't have guessed a strong hefe with more hops would make such a tasty beer, but I've been proven wrong. Only set back is the higher alcohol than normal for the style (abv not listed, but i'd guess it's above 7) becomes a bit more noticeable as you drink it, and is a little too much. I wouldn't have more than one in a sitting, but the one is quite nice. And since it comes in a four pack, that's just fine!"
"drinkablilty is good. this is a standard hefe in profile, with the alcohol bumped up a bit. the fruit is a bit more pronounced in the aroma and the wheat malt shows a bit more on the palate, yes, but this is still a normal hefe."
"D: Non-obtrusive alcohol and a surplus of incredible smells and flavors make for a wonderful beer!"
"Overall: allow me to gush about this beer and I will. I love hefes, and most wheat beers in general. I like hops, a lot. I like most ""extreme"" beers. This is all of those and I absolutely love it. One of my favorite, most memorable beers of all time. New Glarus, damn you for not having a year round wheat beer. You are like the kids on the playground who have the coolest toy but only share for like 5 minutes at a time."
"It was an honor to try it. biegaman I am indebted to you for this one."
"This is definitely one that I would buy again. I like it. A sipper."
"The mouthfeel is medium/full with fairly high carbonation. This is a very drinkable and interesting beer for a large hefeweizen."
"As the Alabama senator says ""It drinks good don't it"". My review may seem negative but this is a great beer. Unfortunately there are some exceptional beers to try and I feel that it was a little behind Big Rocks verison (although evidently this is hard to come by)."
"Pours a gorgeous cloudy glowing light orange do deep burnt orange with an everlasting meringue like white head. Smell is fantastic. Best smelling hefeweizen ever...Huge fruity, banana notes, mild clove, and a big burst of citrusy fruits and orange with a blast of hops behind that. Taste is rich and wheaty with noticeable and uncharacteristic hop presence that works so well with this adding a really unique dimension to it. Nice citrusy bitter orange rind hoppy flavor in the middle followed by a clovey flavor in the finish. Really complex for the style and unbelievable good and drinkable. I would never have expected to like a hefeweizen this much. A must try!!"
" ~ The Imperial Weizen actually gets better and better as you drink it. At first take it's a bit abrupt but as the beer is slowly sipped it becomes far more complex. I will certainly recommend this beer to anyone looking for a full-bodied complex and interesting sud."
"Kudos to New Glarus for the best Hefe I've ever had!"
"D-Drinks disturbingly easy. There is some warming alcohol in the finish, so I wouldn't doubt this stuff's potency to be higher than what I originally thought."
"So here I am with a New Glarus Unplugged Series brew. I felt pretty shafted that night not being able to taste this interesting concept beer, but upon opening the bottle I felt much better. When pouring this beer into the glass I noticed excessive foaming, caused by high carbon dioxide, which is actually preferred in a weiss beer. This beer has the usual banana/clove characteristics found in weisses, but interestingly enough there is a noticeable hop aroma to it, albeit faint. I guess dry hopping weisse beers with Cascade hops makes for a great balance of smell. I was truly impressed with how just a little hop aroma influenced this beer. The taste was not what I expected coming from an imperial-style beer. I was expecting a little bite from this, but would not be surprised if this was a sleeper. (Definition of a sleeper beer: a beer that will knock you on your ass because the brewer cleverly hides the alcohol with the perfect mix of brewing ingredients.) What did stick out the most with the taste was the sweetness of this brew and how the carbon dioxide affected it. This imperial weiss tickled my tongue with effervescence and left it coated with a malty sweetness. I know now why they say these styles of beer are preferred with high carbon dioxide."
"Dan and Deb Carey are officially WI Beer Gods! They continue to push the envelope and just when they get you thinking they are in a niche, they come out with something new and unexplored. New Glarus is a textbook U.S. craft brewery that puts out knockout beers of all styles. I had heard rumors of this beer back in January and couldn't wait to score some. This pours out a beautiful, murky orange with a super sticky snow white head. The lacing was impressive to say the least. In terms of appearance, this could stand up to any Hefe. The aroma holds a powerhouse of hops accented with the typical clove-like banana hefe roots. These hops are not subtle in any way and fill your nose with a resinous, fruity, cascade punch. I am very surprised how well the hops interact with the strong bavarian yeast. The taste is just as fantastic as the aroma and body. An explosion of piney hops open up for a big chewy malt body with a spicy-yeast finish. This combination of flavors is so powerful, yet extremely balanced. If the hops rounded out a bit more to bring through the malt, this would be damn near perfect. The apparently high ABV is nowhere to be found and this beer could definitely be a staple in my fridge. This beer tricks your beer tastebuds; one second you are drinking an IIPA, the next a Hefe. I have not had a hoppy beer that has gotten me this excited since Chouffe Houblon. I hope this beer sticks around until summer!"
"Alright, who poured an SNPA in my Hefe? I wouldn't mind at all if the Cascades faded a bit. I'd probably like it a bit more. Cascades aren't my hop of choice. It's hard to tell that this is 8-9% ABV."
"Probably one of the best Unplugs I have had from New Glarus"
"Drinkability - I could have two, but then I would be too happy."
"A very, very fine beer. I'll be sad when this brew is gone..."
"This was good and certainly a wheat/ hop head's dream. I liked it but the citrus bitterness threw me for a loop. It's not what I'd expect in a typical hefeweizen. Granted this is NOT your typical hefeweizen. Interesting and sure to hit the mark with someone, but not my favorite of the Unplugged line."
"A shade thinner than I want from a perfect hefe (although I want to give it a perfect score so badly!), although everything else lines up just right. This is something I would drink everyday if the cost weren't higher (oh, and if they actually brewed it again). Although brewing shouldn't be seen as a contest, the boys at 3F's would likely hear the Gumballhead accolades die down a bit if more people got their hands on this treasure from New Glarus. Flat-out world class."
"Guess the abv: 11%"
"D: I love this beer, I could easily drink all 4!"
"Overall, I thought it was a good Beer. A little bit hot, and it's more of a sipping Beer to me."
"Pours a hazy, butterscotch with a fluffy two finger head. Setting it down to type, i can smell a bit of banana bread from the table a couple feet away. As I shove my nose in, I pick up a more complex scent, adding honey, clove and citrus hop to the aroma. The flavor consists of most of usual suspects for a hefe, banana, lemon, clove, a touch of apricot, and bubblegummy yeast. Hop presence isn't too strong, but a nice compliment - citrus fruits again with a bit of a peppery bite - much more noticeable on the nose than on the tongue. Slightly dissapointing there, as I like what the smell advertises. As it warms up a bit I'm getting more and more rind bitterness, which becomes a little rough on the taste buds. This is a bit thicker and creamier than most in the style, but the ""imperial"" stamp lead me to expect as much. The lingering, coating body is quite satisfying, though leaves the gum flavor to hang around a bit longer than I might like. I'm not the biggest hefe fan in the world to start with, but this is a nice, beefed up American interpretation that I'd go for again in warmer weather. Thanks mully for the bottle."
"drinkability: high"
"A big thanks to malcontent for bringing this back from WI!"
"Drinkability: The flavors make this good for one or two, but definitely very interesting."
"An excellent example of a hefeweizen that has it's own original characteristics thrown in. Highly recommended."
"D - A very unique blend of styles. It is definitely an Imperial version. I really think the Cascade hops play well with the Hefeweizen. For some reason all I could think of the entire review is the old Orange Julius they used to sell in shopping malls."
"New Glarus's string of disappointing entries in its Unplugged series ends with this baby. It's very tripel-ish, yet with a wheat backbone that sets it apart. Pours with a massive, scultpable French-vanilla-colored head, with ridges and valleys that would do the topography of Colorad proud. Color is hazy orange. The aroma is clove, with lots of clove and spice and detectable wheat notes in the first tasting, followed by some bitter apricot. Full and round in the mouth. Clean but not light on the fnish. Wonderful beer."
"This is an excellent beer, if it was more to the banana side than the clove side I probably would have enjoyed it even more. Pretty much a hefe on steroids. Very tasty."
"I hereby declare New Glarus as the best Weizen brewery in the country. I loved their Solstice back in the day (4.75). Went through a few cases of Dancing Man last summer (4.6). And the Black Wheat was exceptional as well (4.55)."
"Well done beer. Has good mouthfeel and is quite easy to drink."
"A very good beer and another pleasure to drink. Sometimes living in Wisconsin does have it's perks and this is one of them. Another New Glarus gem."
"D- amen to the king of wheat beers, 1,2 punch with dancing man wheat followed by this."
"Bought at Steve's in Madison. Truly the most unique beer i've ever tasted. Dark orange/yellow color, and very cloudy. So cloudy you can't even see through it. Smells like bananna, clove and a little bit of spice and cinnamon. Now for the taste, and this is where it gets interesting. Starts of with a strong clove and spice flavor, alot like Dancing Man. Then all of the sudden the hops kicks in, strong IPA like hops that give the beer an unexpected bitterness. The finish goes back to a sweet bananna flavor, while the hops still stick around well after the the drink is swallowed."
"New Glarus is the king of wheat beer. Period."
"Update 5/26/08: After nearly 4 months, the hops have lost a bit of their bubblegummy and grapefruit juiciness and have beer partially replaced with aluminum, both in aroma and flavor. And the spiciness has dulled some Still an incredible beer, but a notch below when it was crushingly fresh. The moral here is that it probably isn't worth aging except for curiosity's sake....but it says that on the label, doesn't it?"
" I imagine weizen to be light and refreshing and this is dominating and confusing. I guess I can't compare this ""imperial"" weizen to anything else, but it's not for me."
"I've been impressed with every single wheat beer that's come from New Glarus and this one is no exception. Another excellent brew from Dan Carey and the folks at New Glarus!"
