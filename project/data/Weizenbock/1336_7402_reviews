"This is a tasty bock that leans towards a Maibock."

"Very nice and tasty weizenbock, lots of good flavor in this one and goes down very easy.  Definitely worth trying this one and I hope to have it again."

"As a big fan of the weizenbock style I was pleased to see them available from local brewers. Poured a cloudy medium brown with a moderate head. Aroma of caramel and bananas with some ripe fruit. Taste was fruit and spice with a pleasant bitter hop finish. Very smooth and drinkable. Not as balanced or explosive as the Bavarian originals which I love, but an interesting US version which I would buy on a regular basis."

"o: Not bad, but there are better weizenbocks to be had."
"This beer poured out as a muddy looking brown color with a thin white head on top. The retention and lacing are minimal. The smell of the beer gives off the yeasty bread aromas along with the mixture of clove and banana. The taste of the beer is similar to the smell, the clove and banana with a touch of cirtus and wheat bread all blend together. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a decent carbonation. Overall it's a good attempt of the style in my opinion. I feel there are better choices out there but this one isn't terrible."

"Overall: A tasty, well-brewed, and very drinkable weizenbock."
"This is a solid brew, nice drinkability and a very well hidden alcohol presence. My first brew from ABC, good stuff."
"Poured from the 22oz into my Newcastle Brown schooner. Copper color with not much head to speak of. Minimal lacing. Nice, sweet smell. Taste was more malt than hops. Mouthfeel was medium and easy drinking. Overall I liked it but it seemed basic. not bad at all. Would love to try it on tap."
"Deep amber in color. A caramel/clove aroma with a subtle sweetness. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. Sweet upfront followed by a cohesive yeast and malt richness through the middle. Finishes up with a return of the sweetness, but milder as it is tempered by molasses. Overall, very drinkable and refreshing for a higher ABV beer and a good representative of the style."
"Poured into an oversized mug a cloudy amber brown with a slight thin layer of tanned head. Nose is yeasty, little bit of clove and a touch of hops. Taste is sweet upfront with yeast and spice throughout most of the body and into the finish. Somewhat crisp in the finish with mild hop bitterness. Highly carbonated with a medium feel. Overall not bad but nothing exciting either."

"Nice. This is one of the better seasonals they do here during the year and it's a good choice to put on around the holidays. Lots of sweetness, roast, spice, and fruit make this a great festive quaff."
"D - Drinkable, I would enjoy this with food, and when I got my food with about 1/3 of the glass left the enjoyment went up. I felt my stomach filling before then though, and I feel like I couldn't stomach a bunch of these."
"D - I'm glad they still had this on tap...I'll be making it back next winter to get another pint of two"
"D - Satisfying, not boring, with alcohol well hidden. Good from start to finish."
"D: One of the better Weizenbock's I have had. I believe it is a seasonal at ABC. A very good beer with a higher ABV."
"Notes from 2/21/07"
"D: Very east to drink, and incredibly tasty."
"D--Not a bad representation of the style. Not very complex. Very straight forward. Probably better when its summer."
"D - Alcohol remains well-hidden in this brew. Nice blend of spicy and sweet flavors with a full mouthfeel. Highly drinkable brew from ABC... one of their best."
"Overall, I think this is a solid sweet refreshing brew that I could drink more of. I really liked it better on tap though. It seems to have lost something by the next day in the growler."
"Quite cloudy, hazy caramel colour with a fine, thin head. Some lacing, decent retention. Yeasty, bready aroma with plenty of malt, fruity notes with a bit of banana. Mild bitterness, malty, caramel, fruity esters, with some clove spiciness in the finish. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, fine bubbles providing a creamy texture. Not bad overall with nothing really out of place. A solid beer."
"The beer was served with amber/brown body and a slight tan head that didn't last all that long. The nose is slighty sweet, caramel and a touch of spice. The taste is similar to the aroma with a caramel sweetness and spicey and also slighty fruity taste. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and the body is medium. Easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"This was brought to me with a thin, light-tan head with little retention, quickly reducing to wisps. The nose was fruity and yeasty with a prevalence of banana esters, but underlain with clove. The color was a VERY cloudy browninsh-copper. The mouthfeel was medium and banana was the primary flavor on the palate. The finish had a spicy explosiveness which was undoubtedly yeast-driven. It was not bad, but just not my style."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this Weizenbock (my first) and plan on trying many, many more. This was also my first Appalachian brew and I will definetly be on the lookout for more to come. This was a fantastic winter brew that was not too harsh so even my wife enjoyed this brew. Well done!"
"On tap at Harrisburg ABC restaurant. Arrived in pint glass, creamy brown/caramel in color with a little tan head. Smells of caramel, clove, wheat, and a hint of banana. Very rich taste, lots of clove, with very little alcohol taste. A very smooth beer with a good solid body. Highly drinkable."
"D: The drinkability is decent. A relatively higher abv numbs the tongue if kept in the mouth too long, but the flavors are crisp and intense."
"It didn't start as much to look at, but that was the only real downside. It's a safe rendition of the style, but well done, crisp, and enjoyable. The alcohol made itself scarce in the flavor, but it warmed nicely, which at least lent it some cautionary note. It drank easy and smooth, and while not remarkable, it is very solid. I'd wager this would be a dependable beer to choose for those times when a hankering for the style is an issue. It would not be a bad way to slake that desire."
"Mouthfeel is pretty smooth for this medium bodied brew."
"Very easy to drink, almost deceptively so. If you don't watch yourself, the ABV sneaks up and smacks you."
"Im not a big fan on Weizenbocks so thats a good reason why I didnt like this. This beer has a great head about it, and has a brown color to it. It actually looks like an IPA. The aroma is nice healthy and strong, full of hop flavor and as for the malt when you drink this you know its a Weizen. Its hard to judge this not liking Weizens but knowing that all the styles that I do like they hit it right on the money ill have to say assume that their Weizenbock is done well. The Volks Weizen or as they call it ""the peoples beer"" combines the strong malty component of a bock and the tangyness of a hefe weizen. This beer tastes very closely to their Abbey Roade Belgian ale and is a specialty that is servered in the month of December."
"I was hoping for a little more boldness on this brew but overall it is very satisfying just not spectacular."
"Got a growler from the Drafting Room in Springhouse and what a nice beer this is,pours a hazy medium brown (almost tea-like looking) with a nice big fluffy head that leaves some real nice lacing.A nice green apple aroma along with a little caramel sweetness,very appetizing.Taste has spicey cloviness to it along with some tart apple flavors even a slight nutty tinge to it.I dont know much about this brewer but if all their beer are of this quality I will be seeking these out."
"It pours into the glass a dark amber ruby color. There is no head when it came to the table just a thin beige covering. No lace is present. The aroma is of strong malt some yeast, spicy and some fruit. The taste reminds me of a bock. It is tangy, fruity,spicy and malty. There are some hints of yeast that hit the back and sort of linger for a second. This is a strong beer but very smooth. I could drink this beer all year long, and wish that it were available."
