The nose was big time banana and clove, I thought the yeast did play well with the malts producing an aroma reminiscent of banana bread, also raisins and cherries, a little bubblegum. It poured ruby brown with a white head and it was full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. On the palate banana and clove were still the most prevalent, bubblegum, that banana bread thing I mentioned, cherry and some spices, but everything aside from those first two was pretty subtle. In the end I was conflicted with this beer because of personal preference. It's well made beer, good overall actually, it's just not for me.","BrewChatKen","Oct 26, 2014"

The bubblegum sweetness subsides and a raisin, date and dark fruit sweetness takes its place. It then finishes with huge matiness. The feel is very thick with a little viscosity and a completely hidden ABV.","KYGunner","Oct 26, 2014"

The head stays around a while, and there's a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like cloves, banana, bubblegum, caramel, and some candied oranges.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also bready malt and a sweet spiciness noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation.  It's also smooth and easy to drink, the 10.7% ABV is well hidden.  I liked this brew, definitely worth a try!  I know I wouldn't mind getting another bottle of this.","bluejacket74","Oct 09, 2014"

The toffee and molassess type sweetness w/ deep yeast in the flavor which brings a current-like and mild fig with earthy dark sugar flavor and mild alcohol as it warms. Overall I really liked this bock - nice amount of wheat malt and pretty easy to drink for a 10% beer with nice complexity and yeast influence. I would buy this again if it weren't $10 per bottle but don't regret paying that to experience it once.","Slatetank","Oct 08, 2014"

It's perfectly balanced, rich where it should be, and yielding as well. As a homebrewer, this beer makes me feel like I should brew something with Spelt as well...

3.93,2.3,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,"Fairly murky caramel with a lingering frothy head. Aromas of bubblegum and banana are not what I expected for a doppelbock. Floral notes and caramel are subtle. Flavor is very banana dominant, with underlying citrus. Notes of lemon and orange become more pronounced before the dry, bready finish. A little hot, but pretty tasty.","barczar","Jul 11, 2014"
