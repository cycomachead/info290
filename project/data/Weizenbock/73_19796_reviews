"This is a great beer from a great brewery."
""
"I poured this from a growler, it has a burnt orange color body, with a 2' tan head. The smell has clove, banana aroma to it. The taste starts off sweet of banana and yeast, then the clove comes through. The mouth feel is very nice and the clove after taste is great. Overall this is a very tasty beer."
"Overall: This is a great beer. I wish they bottled it this year and hope to see it on shelfs in the future. it is a great representation of the style and a delicious beer."

"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best by 11/28/09. Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish orange color with a small foamy 1 finger off white head with decent retention that reduces to a ring of lace pretty quickly. No glass lacing. Aromas of big caramel covered bananas, biscuit, molasses, light orange zest, spices, and a bit of alcohol to round it out. Some excellent aromas here, very inviting. Taste of big banana, caramel, pepper, biscuit, clove, and molasses. No bitterness on the finish; but there is some lingering notes of caramel, banana, bread, molasses, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel that drinks easily. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and delicious Weizenbock at almost 2 years past freshness date. I wonder if they will ever bottle it again."

"Great Lakes continues to impress with their awesome beverages. The Glockenspiel is noe exception. The beer pours a dark copper with burnt orange highlights. No real head of which to speak, just some thin wisps on top & a small ring around the perimeter. Marginal lacing at best. The smell includes sweet nose with just a bit of tartness. Light fruit notes - banana & apple. Hints of clove. The taste exhibits more tartness than in the nose; almost sour with banana & orange tones. The mouthfeel is a bit downgraded due to the heacy ABV. The body is heavy Overall it's drinkable, but nothing about it screams exceptional by any means. Worth a shot, but I'm no hurry for another."
"O - A nice weizen bock that has held up pretty well. Haven't had it fresh for comparison, but I would have this again."
" lots of grassy grain like smells in hear with a decent enough amount of yeast thrown in for good measure. Definitly a very lively and right smell, this was sure to win people over. grain for that matter. A very Belgian like flavor, witha good amount of light fruit like yeast and hints of pears and apples mixed in among the various grain like flavors. Blended very well with no trace at all of the alcohol inside. This was so amply carbonated I do not even know where t begin. Just a great light feel and smooth, crisp, clean finish. Really a winner here for sure."
"O: At first I was a little disappointed with this, one of my first real experiments with aging, but I am enjoying this beer very much. The sweetness seems more under control now than it was when fresh, and there is a good mix of the banana, sweet, and dark fruit flavors. It is going down rather easy as well."
"3 years. That's how long it has been. I didn't know at the time that i would be turned into a weizen bock fan. I was at the time 23 and big into the hoppiest IPA's around. The Glockenspiel caught me off guard and surprised me with it's variety of taste, fullness, and overall complexion this was an unforgettable brew. This is nothing short of the best. Looking forward to the next beer to top this one."
"Drinkability - an excellent beer from GL. These are too easy to knock back, it took some effort to save this last one for review."
"Great example of the style by Great Lakes."
"The alcohol in here is not totally hidden, but it didn't stop me from downing all 4 of these. Delicious."
"D - Great flavor and body. The aroma was not as clean as expected, as the alcohol was a little more pronounced ( and I know at 8% it will be more noticeable). Overall a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: Darn good beer."
"Color is a cloudy dark copper/plum mixture fused with hanging carbonation. 'Bock' definitely comes to mind in both the vision and taste. After the 1st taste, I'm waiting for something else to happen, but it doesn't. Heavy wine notes, both in taste and mouthfeel - virtually no aftertaste. Light, sparkling-wine like effervescence. Virtually no hops (or clean malt barley) notes to speak of. Wheat is up-front, but generally this tastes like a mediocre ice beer. Very one-dimensional, and almost seems like a crafty way to get rid of (expensively, mind you) bottom-of-the-barrel hefeweizen. I didn't like it at all. I gave away the other 3 beers from my 4-pack."
"D: I would order a second but I wouldn't buy a sixer. Tasty, no problem finishing a glass."
"D - Extremely drinkable. No alcohol detected at all. 4.5"
"D - Drinks very nicely. Alcohol fairly hidden, and very refreshing."
"MMMmmm, nice brew. Poured aggresively and got an ok tan head that quickly subsided with no lace. Color is a hazy copper. Aroma is a Bavarian hefeweizen with loads of malt. Flavor is like aroma with lots of caramel and some toffee. Great body and carbonation. Finish is a bit sweet but decent."
"Thoughts are like this, this is Weizenbock. This is a world class brew the only thing I say that surpasses it is Aventinus."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it was really a delicious beer that I really enjoyed. Would definitely buy again."
"More bock than weizen, strong on smooth, moderately roasted malt, but fell short on any yeasty notes I had hoped to come through with the wheat heritage. A touch harsh at the very end, with some rough ETOH, but otherwise a less distinctive beer than I expected."
"D-extremely easy to drink, so smooth and tasty. Brings a nice mixture of tastes, another great Great Lakes beer...they are awesome!"
"Overall, a tasty beer. Expect a proper full bodied weizenbock here, and not a pale version as many have become accustomed to due to the rising popularity of Vitus and Ayinger, which they deserve as they are great, but this is not the same style of beer. I like that about it though, and i like the fact that it actually displays some imperial characteristics. A fine libation, and one i would be happy to imbibe pretty regularly when looking for a nice sweet wheat beer without going all wheatwine on my liver. A good representation of the style for sure."
"D: Pretty drinkable, all the flavors were there in the right amounts and were pretty good."
"Taste: Has a nice spiciness to it with a banana bread and cherry type flavor but there is also a noticeable alcohol taste there as well. Very good flavor but not too heavy making it easy to drink."
"D - It's drinkable, but nothing about it screams exceptional by any means. Worth a shot, but I'm no hurry for another. It doesn't appear to have made the 2010 lineup; I won't miss it."
"D--Yummy beer that is definitely a winner. worth getting."
"Its hard to find a bad beer from this brewery, and this beer manages to hold its own with the big boys, while still managing to include its own distinctive twist in the style. The more Great Lakes I have the more I like them."
"D: A very good drinker."
"Little less than a finger of deep tan cream colored head, dissipates rapidly into scattered islands of bubbles, light stickiness to the lacing. Strong cloudiness helps it hold light and deepen the glow in the amber red, orange rust colored liquid, holds richness through the rims. The nose is quite sweet, yet openly knit enought to not become too much so, clove, ginger, nutmeg in action, honeyed mandarin oranges, corn syrup, esters, banana to dried apricot fruit, fruit cake, nothing that briskly penetrating or sharp-edged, dries out well as it lifts and dissolves. Medium-bodied, fairly tight carbonation gives it more density than foaminess. same sort of raisin bread, banana, apricot, peach thing going on, sweet oranges, cloves and a moment of honeyed ham, oatmeal. More chocolate and caramel than found in the nose. Sweet enough to be smooth but there's also some grit to the texture which holds your attention. Fills the mouth without heaviness, all the way through the finish. Tasty stuff."
"OVERALL Complex, smooth, easy drinking and flavorful. Excellent representation of the style. Very well done."
"D- This was a good stab at this style and I look forward to it next year. Nice work on this one Great Lakes!"
"D - This is a good beer to try at a bar or buy a single of, but I'm not sure I'd want a four pack. Nothing really wrong with it, just not one of Great Lakes's better offerings."
"D: A tasty, complex, delicious weizenbock from Great Lakes. Full of interesting flavors and surprisingly drinkable for what is a rather big beer. If you can find this seasonal, it's definitely worth picking up. If only Great Lakes distributed all the way to DC..."
"Overall impression: Doesn't look like much, but a fairly complex and tasty interpretation of the style. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability; mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with fairly low level of carbonation which just enhances the smoothes of the beer, and helps to increase the drinkability."
"Medium bodied and creamy smooth, the carbonation was really kept in check leading to the great texture. This was a great beer, consisting of a lot of wheat beer characteristics, and yet so much more."
"Lacks the depth of better examples of the style, but nicely drinkable."
"D - good, but just kind of lacks character and body. taste is a bit wearing as well. not one of my favorites of the style."
"Glockenspiel isn't a bad beer - I much enjoyed this bottle - it simply isn't the epitome of the style like most all Great Lakes offerings tend to be. I don't know whether it's the wrong water profile, perhaps there was not enough malt used? In the end, I feel satisfied enough to say I've had a good beer - but not enough to say I've had a good weizenbock."
"Pours an orange copper color with a slight one finger head and very little lacing. The aroma is of banana and some honey along with a hint of clove and some sweet malt. The taste is of a sweet malt backbone with banana and honey flavors over the top of the taste. The mouthfeel has a small amount of carbonation and is slightly watery. Overall it is an easy drinking beer, nothing to make you shy away from it. A solid beer."
"Purchased from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. Pours a ruby red body with a light tan head that eventually fades. Aroma that resembles single malt scotch. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Flavor is smooth maltiness, no detectable bitterness. Goes down easy, especially for 8% alcohol."
"D- I think it finishes out a little too sweet for me to have more than one in a sitting. This is my first for the style and I'm looking forward to trying more."
"This poured a clear dark copper with some tan head. It smelled like banana and honey wheat and nutty malt, with some caramel. It tasted like honey wheat and banana nut breads, with some caramel and coriander and a bit of alcohol. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this wasn't as thick or complex as Slam Dunkel, but it was cleaner and seemed more true to style. Alcohol was apparent but not too harsh, so this was still easy enough to drink. Decent beer but not anything great. (I think it takes a truly amazing weizenbock to impress me.)"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty damn drinkable and the ABV is no where to be found."
"Morey's Bottom Line: The best Weizenbock I've tried to date. I even like it a bit more than Victory's Moonglow."
"Very nice, and an interesting take on this style--one which would take a few more meetings with to really wrap the taste buds around properly. Despite the 8%, this is a weizenbock I could sip on all night. Unique but simple...and certainly up to Great Lakes standards. Thanks to kels for her wonderful generosity!"
"Notes: This was a very enjoyable Weizenbock. Its alcohol was very noticeable at first but mellows as you drink and as it warms."
"The taste is light and sweet with a hint of hops, nothing special to keep you having more than one but it is drinkable. Mouthfeel is light."
"D - Certainly not a bad beer but it's no Vitus."
"Final Thought: Excellent brew, might be Great Lakes best offering; worth saving for a great occasion."
"D- Reminds me more of standard weizen. Not nearly as good as some of the German weizenbocks I've had, but not a bad beer overall."
"A great weizenbock. Up there with Aventinus, although there are alot of Weizenbocks I've yet to try. Recommended."
"This is a drinkable beer. The ABV is covered well. The lack of banana smell or taste is a little disappointing."
"Drinks alright, good, but not one of the better weizenbocks out there. Not up to the usual stellar results I get from Great Lakes usually"
"Drinkability: What can I say but smooth and easy. I'll certainly be purchasing more of this in the future."
"D: Flavor wasn't outstanding, but a drinkable beer all the same."
"single from Riley's, Madison, WI...best by 11/11/09"
"Its just about perfect on a cool fall evening. The finish is nice and crisp and leaves your mouth just dry enough to prevent a person from putting their glass down for more than a few minutes."
"D: Light as hell, could knock em down..."
"Overall, this is a big Bavarian wheat beer that reminds me of Saranac Black Forest and a good Hefeweizen combined. Definitely recommended although admittedly I have not had many offerings of this style."
"D: a great way to unwind at the end of a fall day. make this your first beer and sip it slowly."
"I could easily order two of these at a bar and will be really happy to get this again sometime."
"Bravo!"
"M/D: Nice medium body with decent carbonation. Alcohol could be better hidden."
"A good nite cap here; Or this would make a fine cigar companion."
"Great Lakes Glockenspiel (A Weizenbock Ale) is yet another home run for a craft brewery that makes a habit of hitting style after style out of the park (Grassroots Ale being the most recent exception). Here's hoping that this stuff is still on the shelves in Ohio next week. Failing that, I'll be sure to stock up big-time next spring. Highly recommended."
"D-As expected another fine beer from Great Lakes. Wouldn't put it in my top 3 but well worth drinking..."
"This pours a translucent caramel brown color with a very light fizzy tan head. Smells of sweet banana, clove, and bubblegum. Taste is sweet and slightly spicy with only the slightest hint of alcohol. More banana and cloves are apparent with possibly some brown sugar. For a beer this high in ABV I'd even call it fairly light and refreshing. Awesome."
"Drinkability is high despite the thickness of this beer. At 8% I might even argue this to be an imperial weizenbock but the alcohol is well hidden. I didn't even notice it until I saw it on BA - even then I was shocked to learn it was so high. Overall I'd say this is a definate winner! I wish I had a few more to toss back!"
"Warming and full in the mouth the beer coats without cloying. Up front the sweetness of the malt dominates with alcohol and just a hint of hops in the finish. As the beer warmed, the alcohol becomes more pronounced (not surprising at 8% ABV). In addition an astringency began to seep into the flavor, an astringency that was not at all unpleasant This is a very drinkable beer for one of such a robust alcohol level. It tastes like a fall afternoon and its drinkability would make it a great pre-game beer."
"D- much higher than I would expect for a 8% bock beer. For the style, drinkability may be 5, over all it would be much lower, but still pretty decent."
"Very enjoyable beer from a very enjoyable brewery. Another must try from the folks at GLBC."
"An aggressive pour yielded barely a one finger head. The bottle claims, ""Plum-colored and full bodied, our Gockenspiel combines spicy notes of clove and banana with a complex finish."" I couldn't have said it better myself. The color of this beer is extraordinary! The banana is very present and one of the overwhelming traits of this beer...which is not a bad thing. At 8% ABV, you can tell the alcohol is there. This is not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination. I originally had this beer on tap at the Great Lakes brewery about 2 years ago, and it was just as tasty as I remembered!"
"D - This is an excellent weizenbock with some really rich flavors. This is probably one of Great Lakes' better tasting beers. The aroma might be improved, but it's quite good nonetheless."
"Looks beautiful. Clear, dark crimson tone. Creamy beige head. Moderate amounts of lace. Nice aroma of wheat, chocolate, spice, clove and banana. The aroma translates over very nicely in this beer to the palate. I get the nice thick wheaty base. Nice little sweetness from the residuals. Clove, vanilla and banana all accent nicely with a little cracked black pepper thrown into the mix for good measure. Full bodied and very agreeable on the palate. Surprise, surprise, another winner from my favorite brewery."
"Pours a ruby and dark copper amber copper that makes e think of old-fashioned candy. Not much of a head or bubbling. rui cup apricots and peaches with some faint toasted malts and yeasty bananas in the nose. The taste is super juicey upfront and full of fruit. The middle adds some caramel to to the fruit. Lots of yeasty bananas in the finish that slowly warms tahtnks to the alcohol. What a fruit and yeast bomb weizenbock this is. Pretty damn good!"
"D - dangerous...definitely a winner"
"Four fingers of dark beige head here, though I felt like I had to force the pour to get the beer to grace the height of the glass (which will bring the scoring on appearance down a bit for me). Colors of the body include dark copper, plum and golden edges. Aromas are huge out of the pour, with clove and ripe banana as promised on the label. Tastes are similar, with an emphasis on the ripe banana. This is a tasty brew, though it's a bit hot. With time and warmth, a tart fruitiness comes out, which is a nice addition. Mouthfeel includes a lighter body than I'd like, with mild carbonation. I am a fan of this beer, but it's hard to love a weizenbock after you've had Aventinus and Vitus! I'd buy it again, but I look forward to trying more from Great Lakes."
"D - A drier, easier to drink Weizenbock than is typical for the style and I think it works to the advantage , especially at 8%."
"Poured from the bottle to my pint glass this beer is a murky brown with a nice looking head that doesn't stick around long. It forms a thin white ring around my glass with a little bit of lacing. It smells ""German"" to me. By that I mean I get the wheat and yeast and maybe a bit of malt. It's nice and pretty good for the style. The taste reveals none of the 8% alc. Instead it's wheaty and flavorful without being overpowering. I'm not usually a fan of wheat beers but this is pretty good. The mouthfeel just feels right. It's smooth and extremely drinkable, almost a session beer except for the alcohol it contains. Great Lakes rarely disappoints and this is another solid offering from one of the Midwest's best."
"I went all the way to WI and bought this beer and brought it all the way back to OH where I live. What a waste!"
"D: This style really should be listed as my favorite (in fact, I'm changing it after this review). The fullness of the wheat coupled with the yeast makes a winner in my book."
"D- crisp and refreshing. Its a good cross over from some belgian styles into a nice warm weather german ale"
"drinkability is decent. the alcohol does become apparent upon a bit of warming and hurts the drinkability, but overall this is a nicely composed weizenbock. the flavorts work well together and do not end up overbearing."
"This is one of my very favorite brews to this point from GLBC, and my mood would determine whether I'd go for an Edmund Fitzgerald or one of these."
"Drinkability: Another above-average brew from Great Lakes, a brewery that seems to continuously hit their mark with surprising accuracy. They're never perfect (w/ the possible exception of the BA Blackout Stout, which was fracking tasty), but they're always enjoyable, and this one's no different. A traditional weizenbock - that is, if you can call any example of the style ""traditional"" given how broad the stylistic definition is - that falls more towards the roastier, fruitier end of the spectrum, this one's definitely one I could see keeping in my fridge. At 8.0% abv, it's not exactly a chugger, but I sure found myself putting it away fairly quickly."
"I'm not usually a huge fan of wheat beers or weizenbocks, but this one is really nice. Probably the best weizenbock I've ever had, and I especially love the rich malty base off of which the other flavors work, rather than dominating with banana and clove. Really good stuff."
"SOme alcohol is noticable. Lighter body with a good amount of carbonation. Not overly complex, but pretty solid."
"D- big and bold flavor, but a little sweet for my taste. HOWEVER, a half a bottle mixed with another 12 oz or so of water or chicken stock or lighter beer makes a ridiculously good bath for simmering german sausages, presently knackwurst, weisswurst, and bratwurst."
"Poured clear orange with a little head that disappeared quickly. The aroma was of heavy banana. The taste was largely bananas too with a malty sweetness. It felt a little thick going down, but not unpleasantly. You could drink several of these, but because of an 8.0% ABV, probably shouldn't. Overall, an above average beer, not stellar."
"HV"
"One other point, this stuff absolutely smokes Grassroots Ale. If you have any hesitation picking it up due to a poor experience with Grassroots, let it go. This beer deserves a purchase. It's good stuff and far superior to Grassroots. Pick it up if you see it around."
"This was a pretty good weizenbock though not really my favorite. Worth a try if you enjoy this style for sure."
"Lightly toasted malt up front. Spicy hop flourish prologue to big fruity, yeasty, bready malts. Rummy banana bread, pear liqueur, Concord grapes, and sugary malts. Banana bitter finish with a flourish of spicy hops. Warming. Thick, wheaty, full body. Creamy feel. A very solid example of the style and dangerously drinkable on this cool summer day."
"Overall, not the best weizenbock in the world, but a solid offering from GLBC. This beer should come in 12-packs :)"
"I just tasted the Schneinder-Brooklyner Hopfen-weiss the other day and these are definitely two unique interpretations of the style. I'd have a hard time picking a favorite."
"D: Very enjoyable. Not the kind of beer I crave but I'd like to have it again. I drank it after a 7 hour drive and it was a perfect sophisticated thirst quencher."
"Definately a good beer for people who appreciate good beer, not by any means a starter beer for those just getting into microbrews."
"Overall it's good to have but I wish it was a full size 0.5L bottle rather than a 12oz, so I'd say that was a good in regards to drinkability in that I wanted more for the whole glass."
"As I drink this, there is no lacing whatsoever left on the glass but I am beginning to detect more of the alcohol near the end of each sip. Reaching the bottom of the glass, am I disappointed that I have no more to drink. Sadly, this is the last one in my four pack. I will DEFINITELY be picking up more, this beer was thoroughly enjoyable and my very first weizenbock. Kudos to the chef!"
"Nose is spiced apples, alcohol, and faint gingerbread. Flavor has a similar profile, a phenolic medicinal note and clove spice seem to dominate with an alcohol heat behind it. Trace cinnamon and cookie flavors are in there too, but it lacks a cohesiveness and fullness that good Weizenbocks have. More of a sipper due to the perceptible alcohol."
"D: Not overly sweet, just enough spice make this beer easy too enjoy. The alcohol content is not really noticeable. A good offering from Great Lakes."
"D= This is a very easy beer to drink, and would make a great (but dangerous) summer beer. The ABV stays very well hidden."
"notes: can't really taste the 8% abv of this beer its really odd. this beer is pretty pricy going around 8 bucks at a bar, so not a good beer to be drinking all the time, unless u have deep pockets. Let it warm, enjoy, this is one of GLBC finest."
"D Great for this ABV. Really I could have the whole 4 pack."
"An exceptional introduction to this style for me and a reason to keep an open mind about malt-forward beers (with unique & pronounced yeast)."
"I shouldn't be surprised each time I'm blown away when I try a new beer from Great Lakes. Add this one to the ""nearly perfect"" list."
"Overall: This style is fairly difficult to find, and this really is one of the better examples I've had. Great Lakes hit a home run with this beer. If only it were bottle conditioned."
"Lovely beer on a hot day, found at Premiere Gourmet. Pours peachy golden with a white head. Pleasant banannas and a tad cloves aroma. Taste is Orange, wheat with some spice, pepper, saisonish that way. Most fresh and dangerously drinkable. Alcohol well hidden."
"Another notch in the belt for Great Lakes. There are a few things that might be tweaked here, but I can't realistically argue, as I gluttonously slop it down."
"Taste was very appealing with vanilla, caramel, yeast and malt. Very well balanced and a sweet finish. Mouth feel was medium carbonation and I was not able to tell this was 8.% One of the best American wheats I have had."
"12oz. Poured a red-brown color with a minimal head that was quick to dissipate into nothing. Aromas were malty at first - caramel and toffee - some hints of clove. Initial tastes were loaded with malts - toffee and caramel up front. Quickly, the weisse qualities intermingled - bready yeasts, clove and banana notes. Mouth-feel was medium bodied with little carbonation. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming - leaves a tingle on the tongue. Finishes well-balanced and slightly dry, but only enough for you to want another sip. Overall, very good take on a German classic. Another great brew from Great Lakes."
"Taste is huge caramel malts, but a surprisingly large amount of smoke and peat. Thin to medium in mouthfeel. A little amount of carbonation. Fairly enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Drinks like water being 8% and is even refreshing."
"Overall, a rather pleasant and surprising beer from my favorite brewery. I'll be buying more of this for friends."
"D- The alcohol is hidden fairly well and the sweetness isn't overbearing. One of the more memorable beers from Great Lakes."
"The 12 oz. bottle was woefully inadequate for the pour into my much larger weizen glass. As a side note, I corrected this problem by emptying two bottles into my next serving! Color was a purpleish amber with a fluffy off-white head. I immediately noticed a banana and clove scent more akin to many Belgian beers. There are all kinds of flavors going on. While the banana dominates, you get clove, wheat, caramel, plums, and a nice bready yeast. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. This is pretty easy to drink considering the high ABV, and I'll be drinking plenty more of this."
"As far as German Weizenbocks go, this is easily my favorite one to date. The sweetness is pretty tame, and there is a great complimentary banana and spice flavor. Great Lakes does this style proud and anyone who like German beers should seek this baby out."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"This beer pours a cloudy brownish-amber color. The head is a coulpe inches in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of banana, tangy wheat, and hints of clove. The taste is like the aroma, but magnified and with a slight alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really nice Weizenbock, that I would love to drink again."
"Great Lakes Glockenspiel is a dim, hazy, reddish brown ale with a yellowish off-white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a sweet, spicy, estry aroma with notes of banana, clove, raisin, fig, apple, coriander and black pepper. It's full bodied and syrupy with a sticky finish. It seems a touch scratchy. It's quite sweet with all of the aroma elements present in the flavor. It's a little resiny, leathery and phenolic, with an alcoholic aftertaste. It's pretty good, but I couldn't see reaching for a second one."
"drinkability: easy street"
"Eric"
"Overall, not even close to the best Weizenbock I've had, but still a good beer."
"Medium carbonation with a medium full body, a little watery on the tongue. Satisfying, but not overwhelming, almost refreshing. Dangerously drinkable for a beer of this strength. Overall impression is an almost clinical grafting of the weizen and bock styles, that is a very pleasant drink, but suffers in comparison with the Aventinus in that it does not have the original's depth or sense of richness. I'm picking at nits now, we can't all be Aventinus and Great Lakes' Glockenspiel stands on its own as a very nice flavorful weizenbock. It would be great to see a straight hefeweizen from them in wide distribution."
"Future outlook: 4's all around for another rock solid Great Lakes offering. I'll be happy to reprise drinking this beer when the next opportunity to doff this semi-local offering arises."
"Once again, just not lively enough for something in the weizen family. Full-bodied, however, and highly drinkable for something of its strength. An excellent addition to the GL roster."
"Goes down silky smooth."
"D- Wow this being the second release from Great Lakes this year that I just am not at all impressed with. They need to bring back that old beers that were much tastier than these."
"Overall a strong offering from Great Lakes, can't wait to try on tap when I make it back to Cleveland"
"D: I could see drinking this again, though I don't know if it is the best example of the style.."
"has moderate carbonation,i feel like it's fitting for the style.it's an easy drinking beer,no hint of alcohol at all at 8%."
"I picked up a 4-pack of this at the brewpub gift shop this week. I think it will be distributed to Columbus soon but I wanted it now. The beer is clear dark copper color with a 2 finger off-white foam that sank quickly. The aroma is strong with bananas, a phenol-heavy type of weizenbock, my favorite type. The taste is also big on bananas, with spice and a little alcohol. Very tasty and filling, very good competition for Aventinus."
"Drinkability: Moderate to high I would say; it's a wonderful tasting beer but it's a little heavy so I wouldn't want to sit around and have too many because I would feel weighed down; the ABV is getting up there too at 8%, not that it's especially high, but I can already feel it creeping up on me. Very nice beer overall and well worth the wait and hunting for it."
"Pours a hazy cooper with a thin white head. Not much retention, and just a bit of lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits,clove and banana. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is nicely spiced, with fruity and malty notes through out. Light version of this style, but not bad."
"12oz bottle. Pours a disappointingly clear copper with a small, pale yellow head that disappears rather quickly. Incredibly strong smell of bananas and dates. Clove and slight tart wheat aromas in the background. Tastes of banana and clove; overall sweetness with a hint of alcohol that gives it a slightly warming finish. Medium-full body. This would be a really nice weizenbock if it only looked the part."
"An interesting sipper. Not an everyday beer for me, but that is perhaps typical of the style. I always enjoy something new from GLBC and they didn't disappoint."
"D - Quite drinkable for the 8% ABV. This is a solid example of the style, but a bit subdued compared to some others I've had (notably the Victory Weizenbock)."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 11/11/2009. It's nice to finally see this brew being bottled. Served in a Weizen glass, the beer pours a dark red/amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is good. The bubbles come up from the bottom of the glass to the top long after the initial pour. It smells like cloves, bananas, figs, plums and wheat. The taste is similar to the aroma, but not quite as strong. It tastes like cloves, bananas, yeast, dark fruit, wheat and a bit of peppery spice. The flavor lingers long after you take a drink. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's very smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think this is a good brew, I'll definitely have to buy another 4 pack soon since this is a seasonal beer."
"I was very excited to try this since its the only seasonal I haven't seen yet. Poured a nice amber color. Nice clove scent with some fruity tones. Very complex flavors. Not the overpowering clove/banana taste I was expecting. Overall, a very good bock that goes great with the season."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and clean with fairly strong carbonation."
"Drinkability- Despite the high ABV, this is a pretty excellent drinker, especially for the season."
"Wow, could not believe I found this at the grocery store. Great Lakes must have just started bottling it. Pours a white puffy head, leaves a bit of tracing down the glass. Smells of cloves, bananas, and plums. Very rich smelling. Pours almost a ruby red colour. Medium bodied with a bit of plummy orange tastes and bunches of cloves. I love the clovey tastes in weizens. Dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is detected however, and it is strong. I LOVE weizenbocks and they are hard to find. Great sipper here by Great Lakes..they can do no wrong. Every beer they create is full of flavor and most in the top ten for their style, this weizenbock is no different."
"This is a kitchen-sink beer where every flavor can be found in compliment to one another. The beer pours with an expected cloudiness, but an unexpected ligher rust color. Great head formation with equally great retention. Aromas are everywhere: Caramel-toffe maltiness, bready yeastiness, fruity banannas; apples; figs; dates, phenolic clove and white pepper. Flavors comply nicely with the aromas with emphasis on the sweet, caramel malts with all other attributes to provide variety and complexity. A citrus hop note is noted in the ester profile and gains intensify going deep into the aftertaste. Bready and malty in the textures, with a deep creamy roundness. Finishes sweet, malty and with a spicy, hoppy lingering."
"D-Well done. Certainly up there with some of the finest W-bocks I have had. Big, bold, chewy, flavourful and smooth...what more could you ask for. And the name...gotta love it...Ein Prosit!"
"D: Very easy to drink. 8% is no where to be found until the buzz shows up :) Damn fine beer."
"D - Drinkability is very good at 8%. I would normally limit 8% brews at one per sitting but this one goes down too quick and easy not to have another. This is a very nice weizenbock overall. It's smooth and tart at the same time. Banana is smooth and permeates all aspects of this beer. I'd really like to see this make it into a bottle as a regular seasonal offering. Easily recommended."
"D- A really nice example of the style and its easy to drink."
"Overall a really nice beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Pretty nice stuff."
"Drinkability: Another area in which this beer excels. Many wheat beers are light and airy but this one is bready and creamy. With the alcohol not cloying, this is a definite winner. Try it, you'll like it."
"Cheers!"
"D: A damn fine weizenbock. Worth a special trip to the brewery to check it out."
"full bodied with a bitterness that lingered like that of the wit. great fall/winter brew"
"Appearance: Pours a cloudy deep amber brown cinnamon color matched with a dark tan cream head leaves evenly spread lacing throughout my pint. Aroma: Wonderful doughy spice base, which I found a bit weird but it worked well somehow. Apple, over ripened banana, and raisin notes with a slightly alcoholic nose very nice mix all around. Taste: Ripened banana, apple, and raisin really swarm the ol' palate along with a spicy finish with a noticeable kiss of alcohol. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied low even carbonation not as fine and somewhat spritzy as an Aventinus. Drinkability: Decent shot at a weizenbock not dead on to the style but very good and shows some more depth from this great brewery."
