4.11,1.5,4,4.25,4,4,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass and shared with Kristy K at the condo. Hazy orange with a thin off-white head but excellent lacing. Aroma is yeast, wheat, clove, green apple, bubblegum, and citrus. Taste is classic hefeweizen with clove, banana, and bread sweetness plus some citric hoppy bitterness. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, boozy and phenolic on the finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 28, 2015"

Nose is interesting, a lightly muddled wheat malt and spicy earthy yeast note give way to lemon and clove with a touch of candied lemon. There is a bit of an herbal back end. Taste has a lot happening, the wheat malt is up front, its earthy and musky. The yeast is quite spicy mingling with the candied lemon and some sweetness through the finish. Well carbonated, spice lingers, peppery. Body is full and creamy, faint dryness and a bit sweet through the finish.","cpetrone84","Jan 23, 2014"

Beautiful fruit medley of banana, pear, bright citrus, spicy earthy funky yeast, bubble gum, floral notes of hibiscus and jasmine, and even what smells like some dank hops. This is beautiful, really incredible nose. The flavor is big florals and zesty hops up front followed by sweet pears and orange citrus, then finishing with a funky banana yeasty ness. There is significant zest to this in front of what seems to be a nice hefe and the combination is both unique and deliciously refreshing. I am surprised at how bright the hops still are, as I waited way too long to drink this. Medium body with medium high carbonation and loads of complex flavors. New Glarus does it again. I could drink this all day and there is no sign of the 9%+ ABV anywhere. This one could get dangerous.","BMMillsy","Jan 08, 2014"

4.81,18.8,5,4.5,5,4.75,4.75,"This is a hazy gold beer with a substantial persistant head. In appearance, it is the eptiome of hefeweizen. A residue of yeast encircles the bottom of the bottle. A faint fruity fermentation aroma (overripe banana) penetrates the head, and carries with it a hint of citrusy hops. The initial taste is sweet and desert-like but well support by citrusy hop flavors and bitterness that prevents the beer from cloying. The texture of the beer is slick and lucious, with some alcohol warming, but it also carries a slight carbonic bite. that helps clean the mouth out and ready it for the next sip. What I love about this beer is that it keeps you on your toes by presenting contrasting sensations that might seem to clash on paper but work well together in your mouth. It is a cross between a weizenbock and an IPA, an imperial version of NG's Crack'd wheat, which I believe I scored a perfect 5. Tonight, this beer doesn't quite merit perfection, but it deserves to be acknowledged as a thing of beauty.","pweis909","Oct 24, 2013"

The taste is lemony up front paired with pine hops followed by banana and clove. Grassy and earthy notes come through at the finish and provide a refreshing bitterness. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Overall, this is a unique and satisfying brew.

I can feel but not taste the alcohol; it is nicely well-hidden. Hoppy but not as bitter as a typical IPA. Pleasant aftertaste where you can still taste the fruity wheat.

I cant confirm that, but the expectation on my end here is that a fresh one of these would be wonderful (as the bottle itself suggests), but an older one just doesn't maintain. this one poured a really cloudy pale yellow color with an average white bubbly head. the nose is vanilla and cinnamon, with some honey sweetness and more alcohol than I am used to in wheat beer. my girlfriend loved the flavor, thought the spice and sweet combination was fantastic. I liked it less, with the spice being a little overdone, and the wheat malt sort of having a deteriorated flavor to it, not as fresh and clean as it might have been. it lost its ability to support the other flavors, which don't seem to have diminished at all. the feel came across a little thin, and the alcohol was piercing. new glarus does some wonderful stuff, and im sure a bottle right off the line of this would rectify that viewpoint, but this beer (however old it really was) just did not get it done. way out of balance, weird yeast properties, and just sort of all over the place.

A mildly bitter aroma tickled the nose before yielding to a more fruity aroma. Initial taste was a sweet banana and cinnamon flavor that melted into a hot and warming bitter hoppy aftertaste. Notes of citrus are also hidden among the flavors. This is a very smooth beer in terms of the mouthfeel, which is somewhat surprising when the high alcohol content is considered. At 9.6%, this is a potent beer. While it is a warming beer, the smoothness suggests that it could also serve as an easy drinking summer beer.

4.1,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D/O: This beer must have shared a similar conceptual origin to that of Stone's 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA, such as "Let's make an extreme version of a classic style." This imperial hefeweizen is equal to the success of the afore-mentioned Stone brew, showing massively amplified versions of on-point traditional qualities. If any weizen enthusiast ever wished to be able to smell and (especially) taste the qualities of the style more, then this is the beer for them. It is held back only by its heaviness, either real in the form of the syrupy texture, or perceived in the form of its restrained acidity and carbonation.","beagle75","Oct 31, 2011"

A lot of flavors here, berry and banana, ginger, spicy and phenolic, sweet with a slight bitterness to the finish. Has a nice creamy medium body, a little sticky on the tongue, finishes a bit tart and dry. Not a session beer by any means, meant to be sipped, otherwise it is a little cloying and overpowering.

Aroma is banana, yeast, bubblegum, malt, hop, Flavor is largely like nose, plus yeast bitterness leaps out along with sweetness of the malts and propelled by the alcohol. Body is outstanding and ditto carbonation- couldn't be exceeded. Finish is like flavor and lingers with diminishing presence to a point where I can't find the point only that I want another point.

Very interesting and well executed, probably one of the best wheat beers I've ever had.

4.42,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This one pours a nice cloudy, tinged gold in color with great turbidity. The aromas are moderately sweet, full of banana, clove, and it has a nice lemon zest aroma that is really interesting. The flavor is somewhat sweet and ultimately spicy. It is very heavy on banana, clove, spices, lemon, and oranges. I don't know if I've had a hefe quite like this one before. It's very, very complex. The lemon and orange are something completely new to me in regards to a hefe. It finishes light and smooth. You'd have no idea that there is 9.6% abv. It is so, so smooth and very easy to drink.

Taste is a bit less potent, but has notes of banana, tropical fruit, yeast and some slight honey, pine, clove, and some sweet fruit finishes with a touch of grainy biscuit.

Maybe even just a touch of citrus hops. Kind of a weird balance of smells in a Weiss beer. The taste is strong wheat, big clove spiciness, monster banana and finishing hops that bring a bit of a citrus component and help dry the finish a touch. Don't get much of that boozy component from the nose. It's all a bit big and a little imbalanced. Some sips draw me in and make me feel like the beer is something special, others are just somehow out of whack. Big carbonation with a sugary mouthfeel. The sugar just hangs out in the mouth well after the beer is gone. It's pretty unfair to compare this to the balance and restraint of a successful Weiss beer. This is a really interesting experiment that has some success, but needs a bit more work. The hops don't balance the sweetness enough, for starters.

The flavor is an intense burst of spicy cloves and citrusy hops, those flavors linger and the beer finishes a bit tart, slightly dry, and the weight of the alcohol pokes through without overwhelming.

I--I really have to admit that I lack the brewing acumen to fully appreciate what an accomplishment a flavor like this is. The wheatmalt is, for the first time I can ever recall, so intense that it's sticky. The hops are gigantic. The fruit, of all things, balances everything out.

Very interesting blend of aromas, but they work very well together. Taste begins with a musty clove followed by banana bread and sweet bubblegum. Citrus hops emerge midway with a strong yeast presence on the tongue. Aftertaste is somewhat dry and bitter with a bit of booze. Medium body with a feel that is just short of smooth. Carbonation is steady with this one as well. Not a fan of hefe's, but I'm not sure this can be categorized as such.

Taste starts off with the cascade hops pushing up front, followed by the citrus and cream, which is reminiscent of an orange creamsickle. Hops are oily enough to also make themselves known in the finish, making it a mix of bitter and sweet when all is said and done. Body is lively with cabonation, hop flavor, and many appealing tastes to go around. Drinkability suffers a bit for me with this one with the alcohol, although I suppose that is the point of an Imperial Weizen. Still, I like my Weiss brews to be drinkable, imperial or not.

Best smelling hefeweizen ever...Huge fruity, banana notes, mild clove, and a big burst of citrusy fruits and orange with a blast of hops behind that. Taste is rich and wheaty with noticeable and uncharacteristic hop presence that works so well with this adding a really unique dimension to it. Nice citrusy bitter orange rind hoppy flavor in the middle followed by a clovey flavor in the finish. Really complex for the style and unbelievable good and drinkable. I would never have expected to like a hefeweizen this much. A must try!!","JDV","Apr 06, 2008"

4.85,19.8,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"So here I am with a New Glarus Unplugged Series brew. I felt pretty shafted that night not being able to taste this interesting concept beer, but upon opening the bottle I felt much better. When pouring this beer into the glass I noticed excessive foaming, caused by high carbon dioxide, which is actually preferred in a weiss beer. This beer has the usual banana/clove characteristics found in weisses, but interestingly enough there is a noticeable hop aroma to it, albeit faint. I guess dry hopping weisse beers with Cascade hops makes for a great balance of smell. I was truly impressed with how just a little hop aroma influenced this beer. The taste was not what I expected coming from an imperial-style beer. I was expecting a little bite from this, but would not be surprised if this was a sleeper. (Definition of a sleeper beer: a beer that will knock you on your ass because the brewer cleverly hides the alcohol with the perfect mix of brewing ingredients.) What did stick out the most with the taste was the sweetness of this brew and how the carbon dioxide affected it. This imperial weiss tickled my tongue with effervescence and left it coated with a malty sweetness. I know now why they say these styles of beer are preferred with high carbon dioxide.","Newglarusguy","Mar 27, 2008"
4.95,22.2,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Dan and Deb Carey are officially WI Beer Gods! They continue to push the envelope and just when they get you thinking they are in a niche, they come out with something new and unexplored. New Glarus is a textbook U.S. craft brewery that puts out knockout beers of all styles. I had heard rumors of this beer back in January and couldn't wait to score some. This pours out a beautiful, murky orange with a super sticky snow white head. The lacing was impressive to say the least. In terms of appearance, this could stand up to any Hefe. The aroma holds a powerhouse of hops accented with the typical clove-like banana hefe roots. These hops are not subtle in any way and fill your nose with a resinous, fruity, cascade punch. I am very surprised how well the hops interact with the strong bavarian yeast. The taste is just as fantastic as the aroma and body. An explosion of piney hops open up for a big chewy malt body with a spicy-yeast finish. This combination of flavors is so powerful, yet extremely balanced. If the hops rounded out a bit more to bring through the malt, this would be damn near perfect. The apparently high ABV is nowhere to be found and this beer could definitely be a staple in my fridge. This beer tricks your beer tastebuds; one second you are drinking an IIPA, the next a Hefe. I have not had a hoppy beer that has gotten me this excited since Chouffe Houblon. I hope this beer sticks around until summer!","ALESwhatCURESya","Mar 22, 2008"

3.85,-4.9,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy, butterscotch with a fluffy two finger head. Setting it down to type, i can smell a bit of banana bread from the table a couple feet away. As I shove my nose in, I pick up a more complex scent, adding honey, clove and citrus hop to the aroma. The flavor consists of most of usual suspects for a hefe, banana, lemon, clove, a touch of apricot, and bubblegummy yeast. Hop presence isn't too strong, but a nice compliment - citrus fruits again with a bit of a peppery bite - much more noticeable on the nose than on the tongue. Slightly dissapointing there, as I like what the smell advertises. As it warms up a bit I'm getting more and more rind bitterness, which becomes a little rough on the taste buds. This is a bit thicker and creamier than most in the style, but the "imperial" stamp lead me to expect as much. The lingering, coating body is quite satisfying, though leaves the gum flavor to hang around a bit longer than I might like. I'm not the biggest hefe fan in the world to start with, but this is a nice, beefed up American interpretation that I'd go for again in warmer weather. Thanks mully for the bottle.","grandq","Mar 05, 2008"

4.21,4,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"New Glarus's string of disappointing entries in its Unplugged series ends with this baby. It's very tripel-ish, yet with a wheat backbone that sets it apart. Pours with a massive, scultpable French-vanilla-colored head, with ridges and valleys that would do the topography of Colorad proud. Color is hazy orange. The aroma is clove, with lots of clove and spice and detectable wheat notes in the first tasting, followed by some bitter apricot. Full and round in the mouth. Clean but not light on the fnish.

Then all of the sudden the hops kicks in, strong IPA like hops that give the beer an unexpected bitterness.
