"o: A good representation of the style,  Refreshing.  If you like hefeweizen, this is a sort of darker version."
"O- American Weizenbock says it well, not my normal style but would defiantly get it again, good flavor and not overaly spiced and no funky aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting. Would not choose to drink it again."

"Moon Glow is a good American style Weizenbock that is darker and has more malt than its German counterparts.  Another stellar brew from Victory!"

"O- A good beer but I would kind of like the booze to not be so apparent.  Maybe a bit of aging could help?  Either way, one I'm glad I revisited as I've not had it in a long time."
""
""
"Overall, a very good weizenbock and one I thoroughly enjoyed, despite not being a huge fan of the style. I would definitely get this one again."
"12oz. bottle served in a weizen glass.  Enjoy by 19 Aug 2015 printed on the label.  Pours a dull brown, somewhat reminiscent of prune juice in color and clarity, with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head.  Nose expresses grape notes and yeast.  Taste consistent with nose; however, it's all a bit dull.  There's also a suggestion of bubblegum, as well as a hint of noble hops towards the back.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a prickly carbonation.  Overall, a bit bland for a style I generally like.  The alcohol is certainly well-hidden on this one, however."

"overall: A nice beer. Glad I tried it, not a particular standout imo."

"The quintessential American Weizenbock. Better then many German examples, IMO."

"Pours a cloudy rust color with thin cream colored head; delicate sheeting into a few dots. Smell: sweet wheat bread, caramel, big clove, and a banana pudding (chemically banana) note. Taste: banana pudding made with cloves, topped with caramel. If you made this, it would taste just like this beer. There's really nothing else going on... a note of brown bread. It's enjoyable and, well, it's hard to completely whiff on this style, but it's not even on the same field as a poor-man's version of Aventinus. 2014 fall bottling."

"O: picked this bottle up out of curiosity.  I don't usually like the Belgian yeast taste and shy away from beers like this but this was very good for both taste and mouth feel.  Would drink again"
""
"Muddy copper. Nose is bready and that old familiar funk is also present.  Nutty but not really getting the traditional banana notes. The finish is slightly cidery."
""
""
"The beer has high carbonation and tastes very much like a traditional German stalwarts in the style. A wonderful American attempt at the style."
"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had all the key aspects that I look for in the style with the carbonation being the only aspect that felt a little out of place.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, just a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think two would be my limit, anymore than that and i think the prickly carbonation would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, aroma and appearance, they were all very nice and they worked really well with this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but I felt like the carbonation was  a little too lively for the style.  I would buy this beer again if I see it and I will for sure get some next year if shows up in my area.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the style, it does a good job at showing what the style all about and it's good example of a American made Weizenbock.  All in all I was very happy with this beer, it did a good job at satisfying my urge for a good Weizenbock.  It isn't my favorite of the style, but it is one of the better Victory beers I've had.  Great job guys, this was one tasty Weizenbock, keep up the good work guys."

"3.7/5: Yet another rock-solid Victory beer"
""
""
"I've had a few outstanding beers from Victory lately and this is no exception.  No objections here if they want to make this available year-round."
""
""
"Overall not bad, but just left too sweet in the bottle and yeast just took over, shouldn't be that old either, but at least it's not too sweet. Some candy was nice, darker dried candied fruits were nice, and the wheat was nice, just not the yeast and alcohol was a bit much. It was a nice sipper for a cold almost winter night but bit more than I expected. The somewhat dry finish was also a nice surprise, not as sticky sweet as I was expecting."

"Murky medium brown, billowing khaki head. Aroma is pear skin, bruised apple, banana, clove, orange, and lemon, which contrast brown sugar, nutty malt, and rummy booze notes. There's a touch of white pepper. Very complex. Flavor reveals tart apple and pear skin, on a slightly sweet, toasted bready malt backbone, with notes of banana and pepper surfacing late. The finish is dry and a touch bitter. Wish the pear and apple were dialed down a bit too allow the malt to shine more, but a great beer. Falls a little flat in the finish."
""
""
""
"O - This is a damn fine Weizenbock. Lots of fruity flavors make this a tasty seasonal."
""
""
""
"This is a great representation of a Weizenbock. Reminds me of a Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel meets Weihenstephaner Vitus. Has those banana esters one would expect from those German versions. It's a great beer and I plan on drinking this often. I rank this one of my top 5 if not top 3 offerings from Victory."
""
""
""
"A very nice weizenbock.  An excellent version made here in PA.  Nice autumn seasonal offering just as the weather is starting to turn cool.  Forget pumpkin beers, I really wish more breweries would make a beer like this!  A very well executed beer by Victory (yet again)."
"First bock style I have had. I  am now just afraid the rest wont measure up."
"Mostly medium bodied, lighter effervescence. Warming and relatively smooth except on the tongue at first sip where it is a bit sharp. Not as good as Aventinus but a very good brew to be certain."

"Overall: never had this beer before, have been wanting to try it, and lo and behold four-packs are on sale for $7.99 at Jenny St. Market. This is quite possibly the best weizenbock I've ever had and is certainly up there with Aventinus. Just a wonderful beer: prost!"

"Overall, a fruity imperial style of  weisenbock that channels a pleasant autumn spice, with terrific balance and solid drinkability. Stock a few for the upcoming season."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid example of the style, and an American-brewed one no less. Victory does a great job with German styles, and this one is no exception. Sneakily drinkable for being nearly 9%, and a really nice when the weather is starting to get cooler. Definitely worth trying if you're into stronger brews or wheat beers"
""
""
"Pours a deep cloudy brown with a long-lasting creamy white head. Small soapy lacing is left behind. The aroma is pleasant, fruity (banana and apple, just like they said) and yeasty. The taste is is equally pleasant, with the same flavor profile as the aroma and it blends together well. The body is a little thinner and just right. A great beer."
""
""
""
"If I did a blindfold test, I would chosen this beer as German brewed- it has German whole hops, and malts. It is the best American weizenbock I have tasted."
"Complex flavor of bananas, German bread, booze, brown sugar and moderate carbonation.  Tasty!"
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly nice drinking brew.   A decent level of booziness, but all very well balanced out by the wheat, fruit, and yeasty spiced flavors of the beer.  Rather tasty."

"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best before 8/19/2015. Pours hazy reddish copper color with a 2-3 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Incredible appearance. Aromas of big banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible weizenbock! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Nice dose of complexity in this beer. This is my first weizenbock, but the taste reminded me of a Belgian tripel in many flavor aspects. Very attractive appearance as well. Glad I was able to try this seasonal offer by Victory."

"If you are looking for a big, authentic wheat bock and these are available, give them a shot. I'll bet it would be great on tap."
""
""
""
""
"This is an impressively balanced Weizenbock. It errs on the sweet side, but it goes down easily and makes for a fantastic Fall beer."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  This is an excellent example of Victory playing to it’s strengths; excellent German-style beer with a bit of an American twist.  And OK, I stand corrected, looks like the attribute rating system is back!  Thanks BA!"

"A warm caramel with three fingers worth of khaki head.  Large amount of caramel malt in the smell with raisins, cherries, and banana fruity sweetness.  Getting some rum notes in the smell as well.  Taste is similar to the smell, caramel and toffee with banana and cherries.  Medium body, moderate carbonation.  Overall a really nice representation of the style, very enjoyable."
"Rising alcohols frame the finish, giving a spiced rum character to the already variant beer. Warm, tangy and peppery- the waining moments are alive with a sultry savory taste that linger deep in finish; making this ale a slow and patient session rather than a refreshing or drinkable option."
""
""
"A great well rounded classic Sierra IPA brew, showcasing this hop real nicely.  Very enjoyable."

"With the first sip I can tell this is not my favorite but with all Victory Beers you can taste the smooth quality and obvious craftsmanship of a great beer. For some reason I was thinking it would be a little lower in ABV and a bit lighter in taste as this would make a great 2nd or 3rd beer for a great evening. Poured a dark copper with a nice head to it. Medium body and as I mentioned above...very smooth."

"O - A souped-up Dunkel, this beer begs to be aged in bourbon barrels. Some big Dunkels leave quite a bit of sugar around, but not this one. Over time, the spice from the yeast takes over the finish and prevents the cloying that makes many a one-glass option. Towards the end of the growler, a sense of cinnamon emerged. Barrel aging would sand this down a bit and make the sugars more complex. A late fall beer, I can see this pairing well with pumpkin pie, paired against its spice and real whipped cream. Or with a rubbed-and-grilled pork roast and sauerkraut. In any case, this is a beer constructed to be drunk slowly and matched with food and/or a cigar with body. 3.75"

"A lightly hazed light chestnut brown in my 300 ml Aventinus glass. Very good sized head that stays for quite a while and covers the beer all the way down. Some nice lacing on the glass. Some stickiness in the fluid evident. Smell is sweet with banana, alcohol and caramel. Lovely warm dark bread aromas. Taste is full of overripe banana and clove. Raisins and dark fruity sweetness. Wheat malt twang cuts through with a dark toasted nuttiness and caramel vanilla notes.Alcohol is well integrated and not overpowering. Fell is velvety with a silky carbonation and a smoothness to the swallow. Aventinus sets such a high bar to touch that I am doubley impressed by the overall excellence of this brew. It is so close that I would not be surprised by someone preferring the domestic version. It's that good."
""

"O: A style I definitely look forward to every year--more so than the myriad pumpkin beers. This fits well and will probably make an annual tradition."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer of a great style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall, this is the first weizenbock i've ever had. i didn't think i would like this style, but i found this beer to be very enjoyable. the high ABV will certainly have you feeling fuzzy after just a few. as mentioned above, i would go with the smaller glass and not let it warm too much, unless you enjoye a strong alcohol presence in your beer, which i do not. would certainly try this again."
""
""
""

"Appearance is amber-brown and really deep. Slightly cloudy with a great head and nice spider web lacing on the glass through consumption. Smell is malty sweet with molasses and maybe a hint of caramel. Taste is sweet with nice body and good depth of flavor. It has been a while since I last had this beer but very pleasantly surprised."
""
""
"Overall this is one of the better American interpretations of the Weizenbock I've had recently but still not up to par with the great German examples."
""
""
""
"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy orange amber with a one finger off-white head and lacing. Caramel malt, wheat, banana aroma. .A pleasant weizenbock with some dark fruit flavors. Typical weizen clove spice, orange and sweetness at first, dark fruit and light malt middle and a bit of hops at the end. A light metallic flavor on the finish mars an otherwise very nice beer. Worth revisiting."
""
""
""
""
"O-A nice weizenbock, really think this is an under made style."
"...as further exemplified in the feel, a lush, rich but not too heavy, free flowing creamy and crisp medium body. Great stuff all around here."
""
""
""
""
"Nothing more to say except - make this the first beer of your day. Savor it."
""
""
"Pennsylvania rocks out some great German beer styles. Moonglow is no exception."
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is full of caramel malt with quite a bit of clove and banana mixed in. The flavor has some additional notes. I get a lot of caramel and toffee, as well as some cloves, pepper and spices. There is also a little bit of banana as well as some alcohol. Medium, full mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"overall a damn nice stab at a classic bavarian style. victory nails down the most important aspects and delivers a winner. highly recommended."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent Weizenbock."
""
""
"Overall, this is a smooth and enjoyable beer. The malts and spice blend together very well. The alcohol is heavy but not overly boozy. Nonetheless this a solid take on the German style."

"O - This is the first beer from Victory that I have liked. The alcohol is very well hidden. I think I could get a buzz on a few of these easy drinkers."
"For such a high alcohol content, all the flavors do a perfect job of masking it. Very interesting and easy to drink. A pleasant surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - There are all kinds of flavors going on here, but it is very well balanced and highly drinkable. Yet another example of why Victory is one of my favorite breweries. I highly recommend Moonglow and will definitely get it again."
""
"Refreshing and satisfying at once, this is superbly easy to drink. Enjoy either with a hearty lunch or early dinner, perhaps as something to sit back and relax with. Regardless, Moonglow is a winner."
""
""
""
"Overall a major disappointment. The overwrought bitterness and alcohol just swamp anything I might enjoy about the flavor."
"Not what I was expecting for the style. Thought I was going to get hit with lots of banana and clove, but there is a wide array of fruit and spices here. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"Exquisite mahogony tone with an orange tinge. Thick and foggy. Creamy off white head, down to clumps. Lots of banana on the nose, with peanut butter and chocolate truffle. Very complex flavor including caramel, clove, citrus, hop bitterness. Chemically aftertaste. Very full bodied and refreshing. Smooth yet crispy. What a great offering from victory, relatively high abv"

"O/D-Overall, it was alright. Not as good as a few others I have tried from the same style. Not very high on drinkablility. Too pricey too at nearly $13 a six pack. One single will permanently be enough for me."
""
""
""
""
"No date on this bottle. Yeasty chunks in the bottom of the glass. I wonder if it's been around a while. I'm sure I've liked this better a year or two ago."
""
"Medium bodied, it doesn't coat your tongue very much. A little dry on the finish, it left a somewhat unpleasant taste in my mouth at the very end which I couldn't identify."
"Bottom line, it's a spicy, yeasty, fruity and lively beer with a little bit of heat and a mildly dry finish. Well played. I'll continue sipping & enjoying this one."
"Thick and silky, rich and buttery. Not bad so far in the least. Big and chewy with a banana bread presence. Super creamy and rich too. Slight hop presence but I wish it was bigger to really give this beer some balls. Excellent though!"
""
"I couldnt tell what kind of fruit I was tasting, but it was a good. What I really liked about this beer was the balance of fruit and alcohol and hops in the taste. I would love to have this beer again anyday."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a nice smooth drinking beer"
""
"Mouthfeel is light and creamy, with zesty carbonation, a medium body and a sweet grainy finish that's slightly funky from the yeast. Interesting and pretty drinkable, another fine mix of two styles that worked well together."
""
"Reddish brown in color with orangish hues on the edge of the glass and a deep haze. Poured with a short off white foam that reduced to sparce wisps. Wheat malt and ripe apple and banana aromas. (Hick, smooth feel. Sweet caramel and wheat malt flavors up front followed instantly by dark fruit and banana. Spicy herbal tangy flavor through the middle to the finish. Started to show a bit of boozy character at the finish as this warmed a bit. Very easy to to drink. Would certainly have this again."

"A hazy dark copper beer with a four-finger head, although minimal lacing, and a sweet toffee-like nose with some fruity notes. I found it quite complex on the tongue--caramel, raisins and apples, some yeast, a little bit of vanilla and clove, and a very long finish, with lots of clove on the tongue even a minute after the swallow and a lovely warming quality. Yum! What a great late fall beer!"

"Moonglow Weizenbock pours a copper color w/ orange highlights. Very murky in appearance. The one finger cocoa head quickly disappears down to a sliver. Lacing is good. The nose I get is mainly clove, banana, apple, malt, bread. Very nicely blended into a good cold weather brew. Ah... The taste takes it up a notch. Everything in the nose is here- and it's blended very well. It's close to a 4.5, but I'll leave it at a 4 for now. The flavors really come alive in this beer- and the spices are very well done. Feel is medium-full, w/ some big time carbonation on the back end, and aftertaste. Big spices on the aftertaste as well. The only complaint I have is there isn't more presence from the malt. Overall, a solid brew from Victory."
""
""
""
"Overall, its pretty good, nothing great."
"Appearance is a cloudy dark amber with a tan head. Had to be patient with the pour and wait for the beautiful dense head to fade a bit. Not much lacing left behind. Scents are mainly fruity - orange peel and lemon - with a little wheat as well. The smell could use a little more oomph though. There's a lot going on in the taste - it combines the flavors of a wit with a hefeweizen - and boy is it good! Banana and bread give a bubble gum-like sweetness, and a twinge of lemon gives a perfect amount of tartness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, though carbonation is high. This is one of the best wheat beers I've had. Victory has a winner."
"O - I found the Moonglow Weizenbock to be an amazingly tasty brew. Victory makes some excellent beers and this is no exception. Refreshing and delicious!"
"Overall- Great effort here. Tasty and a good late autum/early winter brew IMO."
"Overall - Seems like this is very well done for the style."
"O - overall a pretty good weizenbock. Although I don't think this years is as good as last years."
"O: I’m impressed. This beer was very enjoyable. For both taste and mouthfeel my 4’s are riding on the high end of the spectrum, so this beer probably should get a higher grade then I gave it. I would give this beer my full recommendation and I hope the other beers of this style live up to the expectation that this beer gave me."
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall pretty much what I was expecting here. Victory continues to be old reliable."
"Notes: Quite the tasty brew a very good example of the style. Cheers."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. This is my first time trying it out of the bottle, but it is every bit as good as from tap. Insanely drinkable given the complexity and alcohol and it constantly draws me in to drink more. And with every sip you get different flavors as the temperature change draws out different elements. This beer is definitely in contention for one of my favorite beers from Victory, drawing neck and neck with Storm King."
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this one before now, especially considering how many times I've had it and enjoyed it. It pours a murky rusty sunset sienna topped by a finger of dusty cream-tan foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, light nutmeg, rye bread, dark wheat, and a touch of raisins. The taste brings in more of the same, with an emphasis on the wheat, banana, clove, and raisin. A touch of cinnamon is added in for good measure. Everything just melds beautifully and tastily. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a highly enjoyable weizenbock, one of my favorites of the style, baby!"
"O- This was an amazing weizenbock, great to drink on a nice fall day. So good that it prompted me to write my first review on this sit about it. Good job victory."
"O- Another great beer from Victory. I found this very easy to drink and well balanced. Really can't wait to drink more and try more Weizenbocks."
"This beer is great; the man at the store hit it on the nose: ""the poor man's Aventinus."" I regret having bought only a single of this; Aventinus is my gold standard for a wheat doppelbock, and this one stacks up remarkably well. Next time, I'll serve it in the Aventinus glass; that'll probably accent the nose even better. I'm getting a sixpack of this; some for now, some for winter, some for next winter."
"O: I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers but this was such a smooth, velvety and easy drinking offering that I'm tempted to rethink my stance. Wow! This is 8.7%?? Even better. A solid beer that suits cooler fall nights perfectly. An excellent rendition of the style!"
"Flavors of banana and spices create a rich, full flavor that follows through in every sip. A unique yeast strain gives this beer a distinctive taste on the back of the palate that rounds out the big banana notes. The spiciness is very prevelant, as well as a hint of cinnamon, giving the spices a sweet, almost pie-like taste. Other spices are remeniscent of an herb garden, but it blanaces and works nearly perfectly in this beer. The alcohol is not in your face, but is noticeable when looked for. It creates a deceptively easy to drink beer, as it goes down fast and easy. The mouthfeel is as silky smooth as the head looks, with a clean and dry finish that complements the flavors oh so well. The mouthfeel here actually makes the beer as awesome as it is by adding a layer of texture that is nothing but pleasant. This beer is very complex, but so enjoyable and full-flavored that its simple to drink. I really like this one, and once again Victory has impressed me."
"-Cheers"
"Definitely solid, and more than drinkable."
"Pours a very hazy dark amber with a fair head. Smells nicely of banana and some spice as well as some sweet malt. The taste is similar, but with an added layer of hoppy bitterness that joins the lush banana, clove, and other yeast notes. Nice deep flavors with just enough residual sweetness. Very smooth in the mouth, and the alcohol is exceptionally well hidden. A pleasure."
"Pours ruddy dark copper with a large head. Nose is yeasty, phenolic, with cloves, cinnamon, banana. Mouth is fairly sweet with a nicely mellow spiced collage of flavors. Baked apple, cloves, cinnamon. Fairly bitter throughout the palate with some nice warming heat on the finish. Carbonation is pretty sharp. Not especially sweet, pleasant flavors, I would like less hop bitterness throughout."
"Poured a 2.5"" light caramel colored head. Hazy burnt sienna brown color. Smells vaguely of hops, a little more so as it warmed. Taste is caramel, spice, and bitter hops. Decent, interesting. I'd agree with the label about ""subtle"" but I don't really find it fruity or deep in the spices. Yet still another nice beer from Victory."
"D/O- Wow, I feel if this were to be more eye-appealing I would have enjoyed this a lot more. As it stands, smells and tastes great...appearance keeps it out of the upper tier of weizenbocks. Would have again in the future and cross my fingers."
"A really good weizenbock from Victory. Strangely enough, this is my favorite beer from them to date (though I haven't had a huge number), and it's one of my least favorite styles. I would certainly have this again."
"O: I think a fan of this style of beer would appreciate it much more than I did. It was an interesting experience, that I would try again, but couldn't do it too often. My scores are higher than my personal opinion, but factor in the beer style."
"Overall: this is a good brew for the style, especially for an American brewery."
"Overall, this is a good beer, though I do feel it could have been tamed slightly for drinkability and appeal. Still, the flavors are immensely pronounced, and the brew is refreshing."
"A bold example of the style - pour was a deep gold with a good deal of haze. Sweet, with pronounced bock character. Spicyness and heat from the alcohol follow the initial sweetness in close order. Bittersweet toward the finish, with yeast notes. Might be a little heavy-handed, but enjoyable."
"O - At first I wasn't a fan of this specific beer, but each time I have one, it continues to grow on me. First time with this type of beer and I'll definitely try this beer or a similar kind again..."
"Overall: Unique take on a Bavarian Weizenbock, very flavorful. Not in the same league as Aventinus but still another nice beer at a reasonable price point from Victory."
"O: Very neat beer. First of this style that I have ever had. I would try others."
"This beer pours out as a murky brown color with a cream colored foamy head. The head shrinks down and leaves a film over top of the beer. The lacing on this one is decent. The smell of the beer has some banana and wheaty grains on the nose. The taste is a little spicy and has a decent malt backbone. The mouthfeel was a little thin I thought but had a pretty texture for the style. Overall It's a pretty good beer and I'd drink it again."
"O: This was my first experience with a weizenbock and I was impressed with the style and flavor of this brew. I enjoyed this brew and would drink it again when available."
"O - A very good Weizenbock that I would not hesitate to grab the next time I see it. I gravitate toward the style when I can find it and this is a great representation."
"This is a very nice rendition of the style and strikes me as one of Victory’s best executed beers. It is true to style and excellently made with a good amount of balance. I am not a huge fan of this style, but this is a beer that I can see myself coming back to."
"O: This is certainly one of my favorite beers. I am not sure if aging it for months helped it or detracted from it. This is an extremely drinkable beer and the taste just sends me over the top. Victory rarely lets me down."
"D: Awesome. Possibly a little too much nutmeg/spiciness to it...then again I've never had the style so that's my fault."
"Truly a wonderful beer."
"This beer is still good, but much better fresh. At least I got to get my Weizenbock fever out of the way because I probably won't see this again until Fall."
"The noticable changes in taste as you drink it reminds me of those candies on willy whonka that change flavors all the way up until the blueberry pie..."
"Pours a ruby leaning towards a browner shade with a thin light tan head, bubbly and loaded with yeast particles. Smells of banana, clove, grass, sweet corn, grape, a bit of shoyu and some faint rum scents. Taste is very grapey like red wine, something I can only describe as a rounded mustiness, sweet and nutty, with some apple juice aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very dry and mouth watering with medium carbonation. A very delicious beer overall showcasing the Belgian yeast complexity very well."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I didn't find this very drinkable. The taste was overall too sweet for me and entirely too full of raisins and dates. For a Weizenbock, it wasn't too terrible. But in the grand scheme of things this beer lacked anything special to make me want to finish an entire bottle. Medium bodied and on the verge of being heavy. Overall tastes like some sort of overpowered breakfast juice."
"This is a damn good weizenbock, one of my favorites. I could drink a ton of this."
"Notes: Outstanding!!!"
"* Note: Labeled as ""Best before September 24 2010", this one held up extremely well in my cool, dark beer 'fridge."
"I thoroughly enjoyed Moonglow Weizenbock. The flavors were all dead-on for the style and clean tasting. Despite the fairly high ABV, the drinkability of this beer is quite nice. Something I will purchase again, for sure."
"Finally, the beer had an almond/harvesty taste that was described to be delicious by several. Generally, it was agreed that the beer kind of tasted like a Blue Moon with some Troegenator thrown in."
"Interesting aroma, some citrus and dark fruits (prunes maybe), as well as a caramel sweetness. Lots of clove and figs upfront on the tongue, followed by some nice spicy yeast flavors. Also a bit of that caramel sweetness that was detected in the nose. Medium body and carbonation, a robust Weizenbock. There's alot going in in this beer, but it all works really well together. A very nice offering from Victory."
"Overall-Really excellent beer overall and rather drinkable. Will likely purchase again, can't remember what I paid but possibly a nice cheaper alternative to Aventinus?"
"D: This is a very nice Weizenbock. Great complexity and nice heft for a cold day. A most excellent pickup."
"Victory you never fail to impress me...I wish this was a year-round release"
"A fine beer that's plenty enjoyable. I wish I had more."
"This is a good beer and very drinkable. Was not expecting the complexity and depth it brings. Will drink again soon."
"D: This is solid tasting but it comes up short in the intagibles (appearance and mouthfeel)."
"A great surprise for me. I expected a dark lager and got a lager with great richness in flavor and complexity."
"The mouthfeel is full and juicy, and the drinkability is very good for the ABV, but the sweetness kind of gets to me. A solid and unique brew from Victory. I think I'm satisfied with the single bottle I bought. Recommended, even if it's not for me."
"Great Beer"
"What went wrong here? The sample was fresh. In comparison to the available world class weizenbocks out there, why bother?"
"A pretty murky brown colored brew. Small white head doesnt last long. Some fish-food floating around the bottom. Thick sweet malt scent with a nice wheat characteristic. Thick caramel malt front along with a solid wheat taste, a bit spicy from the high alcohol content. Very light floral hop. Medium bodied, very sharp on the tongue. A pretty solid beer."
"Taste is mostly sweet, with more hints of banana and cream. Very little bitterness. Alcohol is masked very well."
"Poured into Great Lakes Tall Pilsener Glass. Murky brown with stronger red tints especially when held to the light, Sweet Jesus, Look at the Floaties. Nice creamy head that doesn't last too long and leaves a little on the sides. Nose is extremely spicy and fruity, can't smell or taste the almost 9% alcohol. A sweet candy or brown sugar taste is noticeable. As the beer warms, the flavors become more intense. I Like this, another good one from Victory."
"D- This was one of my first beers reviewed on BA. It holds up, to me- fantastic stuff. One of the best domestic weizenbocks. Man, do I love a good weizenbock! Worth seeking out. Worth trading for if you're a fan of the style. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the flatter side, with a medium to light body. I would not drink this on a daily basis as it's not my style, but it feels like it's a solid representation of this style given other's I've tried."
"D: Where has this style been all my life? Thanks to Scott (my beerguy at a local store). He said this is THE weizenbock you need to try. I agree."
"Overall: A great beer, probably best on draft. In the bottle i would treat this one like a heffe...turn the bottle up and give it a shake half an hour before drinking. This one's got a lot of things to float around and there's no point trying to keep it hidden or let it settle into chunks. Watch out, after the initial flavors settle on your tongue these glasses will go down awfully easy, keep an eye on your BAC and enjoy them at English Ale temps."
"It's lively carbonation hits the palate first with a citrus bite flowing into tart raspberry then warming to the mulled spice finishing with a hint of sweetness. A good interesting beer but not my favorite."
"Excellent beer. As good as some of the better Bavarian Weizenbocks I've had. Poured with a nice foamy, frothy, off white head that lasts and lots of lace. Aroma is malt, fruit, a little spice and tang. Flavor's like nose; but, more of all amped up. Body is full, rich, and carbonation is perfect for the style. Finish is like flavor and of long duration. Session beer."
"Pours a hazed light copper color with a cap of barely off-white head, decent lacing. First whiff is equal parts doughy, earthy and carmely sweet, slight citrus burried below. Taste starts off as doughy and yeasty with touches of banana, a nice carmely and honey like sweetness follows and finnishes with some citrus and muted spices. Medium bodied, creamy. A nice, highly drinkable beer that doesnt need to wow to be successful."
"pours a light cooper color with small head and collar..smell is malts and caramel some floral citrus and an earthy smell..taste follows the nose its musty and doughy with spices and malts..mouth feel has low carbonation with a full flavor profile of malts and toffee and spices ,,its drinkable but not my favorite in the style"
"A nice beer for sure but probably not one that I will revisit... As I stated, not my favorite style but this was a really good example..."
"The 8.5% ABV doesn't help to improve the enjoyment of this beer."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer. I could easily have two or three of these in one session. Would love to try this along side some good German grub."
"D: It may have been enough to say that this beer is malty, interesting, and pairs well with savory food--if the yeast were not so conspicuously clumpy. Despite the half-full bottle being given an energetic swirl to homogenize the yeast of this weiss beer, it still poured as described. Its saving grace is that the yeast is never felt on the surface of the mouth. Wheat qualities, while not jumping out as isolated elements, add to the overall appeal, enhancing smoothness somewhat."
"Pours a nice hazy brown with a big amount of sediment. Best before Sept. 1st 2011 suggest this is what it is supposed to look like. Half inch of creamy foam. The smell is bread, clove, banana, fruits like fig and raisin, and a mild yeast. Taste starts off spicy with clove, moves to banana peel and yeast, and finishes bready and sweet. Very little fruit maybe a mild fig but it's really covered by yeast. More bitter than expected but the ABV is well covered. Drink ability is pretty nice but since fall came and went I may still be able to find old bottles but I really didn't love it. Was less drinkable than the Hofbrau version since the bitterness but more drinkable than Aventinus. A sort of average middle ground but great rep of the style."
"a one and done beer for me, sits a little heavy in the stomach. i prolly wouldnt seek this out again, not my favorite style, but its pretty good for what it is. worth a try if your into german dark beers, but if your not, not worth your time."
"D - VERY drinkable, especially when you consider the ABV. A complex, yet delectable big wheat beer that keeps you interested, and leaves you satisfied. Not on the same level as Aventinus, but a worthy offering form Victory. I will definitely be seeking this one out again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"Overall, this is a bold weizenbock. While the flavoring remains true to the style, it asserts a powerful and fruity complexity at its center. What was most surprising about this brew was the deep hue of the liquid itself, which should have been the first clue to its overt robustness."
"D: Last year, I came short of going door to door to promote this beer. ""Craft beer Radio"" gave this very high marks, and so am I!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a bit below average. Drinkability is good, I really liked the wheat malt flavors to it. All the flavors worked together very nicely and make for a very nice beer overall. I really love this style when it's done well."
"Opaque copper with no head at all. Weird. This is my first weizenbock so I don't know if that is normal. Smells of alcohol and baked fruit. The taste is delicious with really sweet malty flavors leading the way. Lots of fruit, including bananas are coming and going. There are plenty of flavors that I cannot put my finger on; this is definitely not a boring or mono-dimensional brew. The mouthfeel is thicker than a hefeweizen and less than a dobblebock, which is to say just about perfect for me. A little more carbonation might be nice, but who knows? Despite the slightly high ABV this is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is extremely well hidden which I appreciate. If Moonglow has any faults it's the lack of a head and it could be too sweet for some. Still, I'm quite impressed. This is my third in three days and the other three will disappear quickly. I've been impressed with the Victory beers I've tried, including Hop Wallop and Hop Devil Ale."
"All that malt made it a rather filling beer, but still very drinkable."
"I think we should make a Willy Wonka-esque movie about the wizards at Victory. They do impressive things, even if I would never really list it as a favorite brewery. They rarely disappoint."
"D: The beer is quite drinkable considering it's alcohol content; for the most part it is fairly well masked."
"Moonglow is a sipper. Very nice beer to drink after getting out of work on a rather cool gray fall evening. The alcohol is certainly evident but leaves a pleasant warmth behind. The transition of flavors allows you to savor each sip if you so choose. I do not think I need more than one of these and I do not think I need one too often, but one a cold Michigan night I will revisit this one in the future."
"syrupy, sticky mouthfeel. drinkability is okay, but its more of a sipper."
"This beer pours a reddish amber color with a distinct microfoam surface that fades to but only a lace on the surface. The smell is both fruity and sugary in nature. The smell was of banana, plum, cherry, strawberry and finished off by a large helping of brown sugar. The taste however didn't model the smell. The bananas were still there with some clove, but there seemed to be a bit of booze flavor that mixed with the flavor of the plum. Nothing else seemed to get through. There was a distinct bitterness to the beer that was unpleasant for the flavors involved. The mouthfeel was still fairly smooth despite the astringent nature of the beer. It was still a good drinking beer. As for a Weizenbock, a good beer all around."
"Definitely the best non-German weisenbock I've had. Tremendous."
"Drinkability: As my experience with Weizenbocks is limited, this really mostly seems like a cross between a Dunkelweizen and a Doppelbock. Complex but a little too sweet for mass consumption, otherwise very, very good."
"D - This is a rich and intense beer. I have a bit of a hard time calling this drinkable, though it is complex and quite enjoyable. The malt is rich and substantial and it provides a solid base from which the yeast can branch out with a variety of flavors. There is a lot of spice and some dark fruit with clove, banana, vanilla, and light smoke being the most prominent. These yeast derivitives work very nicely with the toffee and caramel of the dark malt and create a complex, sweet beer that is as much a dessert as it is a beverage. Weizenbocks are not always my favorite beers as they can be really cloying when the yeast notes and sweet malt don't work well together, but in this case everything harmonizes quite well and I have a hard time imagining a better example of this style."
"D- Hides the alcohol well. Overall a good and enjoyable beer. While enjoyable, it might be tough to get through more than one of these. Thoroughly enjoyable, and another success from victory."
"not too drinkable. 2 would do it for me. but a nice warmer for a cold autumn day."
"D: Very high, I have been waiting to try this for a while now, boy am I glad I finally got my hands on it. Favorite Victory to date."
"Quite tasty, if you get a chance to drink it, do so."
"This is another good example of a favorite style of mine. Sweet and spicy without being cloying. If a person wants a more ""toned down"" weizenbock than the aforementioned Aventinus, this would be a good choice."
"Another masterpiece by Victory!"
"D - It is okay, pretty good even, but the flaws displayed are substantial impediments to its enjoyability."
"Seriously, this is a great beer. There isn't a thing not to like. It has that fruity estery quality I associate with Belgians. It s color is that of a good scotch ale. You can tell there's alcohol in here - it's 8.7% but it isn't overpowering. Its head is fairly thin with just a slight ring as I drink it down. What else do you need to know? If you haven't had this one and its available, snap it up!"
"Overall impression: The appearance rating drags it down, but this is an enjoyable beer I wouldn't hesitate to have again. Easy recommendation."
"Notes: A good unfiltered beer. Reminds me slightly of the Mad King Weiss from Victory. IMO though, ALL wheats should be unfiltered."
"Drink is great, ive been really getting into lagers and bocks lately and this is excellent."
"D-some good things happening here but some things slightly off as well. good feel on it with plenty of flavors working well together. nothing out of balance just some off notes."
"This brew is strong, but has great drinkablity. I could drink this whole growler and not have any concerns. The carbonination is great. I have it extra cold and on this cool fall night this beer hits the spot. Great work by Victory...one of my favorites yet."
"Pours a light reddish brown with quite a bit of haze. Light white head and not much lacing. Great color. Nose brings forward some clove and a bit of spice. Tastes mildly sweet with some spice and zest. Feel is creamy and fairly full. Light carbonation. Drinks well."
"nice fall beer, considering I'm not a big fan of autumn seasonals so i love when this comes out."
"D: One of the better US interpretations of the Weizenbock I've had. I'd probably still go for a Vitus, but this was in no way a let down."
"D: If only I had more livers...seek this beer out but careful with how much you consume"
"From tap at Hop Devil Grill (NYC). Candy nutmeg clove banana aroma with a taste to match. Opaque honey amber color. Small foamy head that disapates to a small wall hugging rim. Little lacing. Each mouthful tastes like a delicious bite a spiced carrot cake. This is a dessert all by itself. Absolutely delicious."
"a weizenbock on the darker side. amber cloudy with a bit of debris floating around. i would like to see all cloudy and not sediment. this was an older bottle than i would have liked. nose is apple, brown sugar, and a hint of lemon zest. Somewheat malt, mild banana. The wheat opens up nicely palate ranged in fruit esters but with a predominate citrus and wheat malt reaction and a bitter finish burnt clove. Apple is steady and throughout the latitude. a bit of huskiness in the gums. all around great for this side of the water. a go to weizenbock."
"Alcohol was fairly well hidden, and I could drink a few of these, which could be problematic! I'd drink this again if I saw it on tap."
"Pours a deep ruddy brown with a tan head. There is no sediment in the bottom of my bottle. The smell is of dark fruit, spice, and some esters, like banana, and vanilla. Not quite as complex smelling as I recall Aventinus, but would love to try neck and neck. The taste, is outstanding and extraordinarily complex. Sort of a symphony of deep, complex (did I mention this brew is complex?), dark fruits, and more and more esters, some phenols. You know, all the buzzwords and tagwards apply on this beer. Little or no alcohol in the nose or the tastebuds, could perhaps be why last spring I drank four or five of these last spring and I was hammered, and cause they go down so well! I must say, I tried this last srping as noticed the flavor of this beer has changed over the years, and I must say it has improved. It is far more spicey, and less soapy than when I first ever tried it. I almost think it is near carbon copy of Aventinus, but perhaps better cause I get it fresher. Another Victory in the beer world...."
"Just an all around solid beer from Victory. Good stuff."
"Drinkable and a compliment to this cold early fall night. I can't tell you if it's the best example of the style but I will recommend that you check it out, especially if you enjoy Victory products."
"D: The yeasty sweetness and the booze makes it a one-and-done dessert beer for when you're feeling tired of stouts and porters. I personally couldn't session this, but I'll certainly have no issue polishing off the growler this week."
"Very smooth and not abrassive."
"M/D - Full body, sticky lingering flavor. Drinkable for the style, but overall rough. Not a bad beer, not my style...not sure what to do with the other 5."
"There's a healthy 1/4"" layer of sediment visible at the bottom of the bottle and some yeasty chunks come through despite a careful pour. The brew is a very dark cherry red with a stable layer of light tan head. Rigorous carbonation keeps the yeast pieces circulating around in the glass. Nose is a bit subdued but the expected elements are detected- semi-sweet, dark dried fruits, banana, earth, yeast. It makes me think of dried chocolate-covered cherries even though there's nothing explicitly chocolatey about it. The mouthfeel is moderately thick, but thinner than expected. A swirl of the glass brings an explosion of fizzy carbonation and head that settles almost as quickly as it rose. Taste is toffee, dried cherries, a bit of banana and stale cinnamon warmth. The mild finish is anise and a bit of boozy warmth."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. I have to wonder if every bottle has this much yeast cake or not. I tried to pour it pretty slow but it was no use. Other than the appearance this beer receives quite high marks from me. Seek it out!"
"Pours a cloudy, amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Suspended sediment present. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, dark citrus, hops, slight alcohol, and yeast. Fits the style of a Weizenbock. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, hops, slight alcohol, and slight dark citrus. Overall, good body, aroma, and blend."
"My first Weizen Bock, definitely like this better than a Hefe, need to try Aventinus..."
"Overall, very good for the style, but not in the top tier just yet. Drinkable, but very much the sipper. A nice change and a great surprise to find as a lone soldier in a mixed singles rack. Worth the try."
"Not even fair to compare, but Aventinus is just a bit pricier than this and that is where you will find a world-class weizenbock. Age isn't to blame here, there is still 3 months until the best by date."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spices and dark fruits. Taste is like the smell, fruit, spices and alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality brew."
"Not a huge fan of Bock's, but Victory has yet to let me down. Pours an orange/amber color. Lots of sediment in this one, pretty good size head. This beer smells amazing. tons of dark fruit aromas. Medium bodied, pretty good mouthfeel. Definite alcohol taste in this one, lots of plum and clove flavors come through. A bit too strong for my liking, and not a huge fan of the estery style... but a nice sipper beer for dinner. above average beer for sure."
"Pours a hazy, somewhat cloudy, copper penny color, with a nice head of bubbly white foam. Great aromas going on here, cloves, bananas and raisins. The flavors here follow the nose nicely, with cloves and bananas predominant. This is a very good beer, one of the better examples of the style."
"Flavor is quite good. Like a cranked-up dunkelweizen. This beer is sweet but there's a lot of complexity in the flavor to keep me coming back for consecutive sips. I get banana, herbal spice, estery yeast and juicy fruit all wrapped in a rich German malt/wheat profile. The alcohol is a bit noticeable on the finish, but overall I like the drinkability this strong wheat beer offers. Not heavy, yet interesting and satisfying. Nice."
" This Weizenbock has a lot to offer with great layers of flavor, crisp & refreshing, with high drinkability. Quite good."
"D: I really like this beer, it is a smooth refined malt bomb. A nice twist on a cold night when you don't want a RIS, but want a malt driven beer. There is no hint of alcohol which helps this beer disappear a little too quickly. I would have no problem reaching for a 2nd one. An excellent beer, highly recommended."
"Note: Best by Sept. 2010 on bottle, so I assume bottles in Sept. '09."
"D: the first decent American weizenbock I've come across. Truly an amazing thing considering I can only find two German examples in my store of over 1,100 brews."
"D: ABV is dangerously well hidden, but the beer is definitely a bit big for its style. Not hard to get down, but definitely not as sessionable as some of its peers."
"Picked up a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer. My first impression is that it'd be mighty hard to tell this apart from Schneider's Weizenbock. Upfront it has a big, sweet bready character with spiced fig notes. There are also light touches of black licorice and banana in the flavor, while the aroma is less rich. Still, the smell is quite nice, with more focus on the clove and banana yeast character you also get in hefeweizens. Quite a tasty weizenbock, full-flavored and a great example of the style."
"Huge head of airy, creamy off-white foam, easily three fingers at the height, fine enough to fizzle off swiftly and evenly, hardly any dimpling, any lacing slides off the glass sides with ease. Fat, glowing amber orange although translucently opaque you can see lots of fun little particles floating about inside. Spiced orange peels, orange pekoe tea, cloves all up in the nose, apricots and touch of banana, sodabread, curiously the scents never get as sweet as you first expect, however, by the same token minimal wheat presence. Full-bodied, spreads its ample heft across the tongue and even the slight prickle from the carbonation isn't getting it out of the beanbag chair. More orange, tangerine citrus, large presence. The wheat more noticeable due to overall dry texture, even in the face of apricot, peach, apple, fig fruit and clove, cinnamon spice. Honey and caramelized brown sugar there is judicious proportion. Perhaps counter-intuitively the dryness helps extend the finish. Good shit."
"Notes: Hmmm, not bad, but I wonder if despite the expiration date this is a bit of a flat six-pack... It was stored cold and bought in January so if this is a seasonal Autumn offering it sure is a bit late. Worth the try and pleasing but the appearance was certainly subpar, and the other characteristics nothing spectacular, luckily the taste base if crafted well enough to still hold a fair experience. I had it both on a tulip glass and on a weisse glass and the latter made the experience so much better, in particular smell gained a notch of richness, appearance not so much, maybe a richer crown initially but still flat after a short while."
"Overall Impression:I am not a big wheat beer drinker, but this beer kicks ass and has a comfort food feel that makes it a good beer on a snowy day!"
"Feel and Drinkability: This beer has a weighty feeling to it, primarily because of the yeast being mixed in with the beer...Easy to drink. It would be perfect in the autumn as the label suggests...autumn or spring it is perfect for either season. Carbonation is light and airy in feeling, in numbers...its about medium...tiny and delicate. All in all though this is a light feeling beer, but merits weight...due to the yeast, at least thats my guess. This is definitely one to pick up and drink when in season. Give it a go. Another great beer from Victory! I can see this as a perfect beer for fall, watching leaves fall chilling out ouside with some close friends."
"Pours a rusty orange amber color with a big foamy lightly tinted head that fades slowly leaving a reasonable amount of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is really nice full rich earthy yeast banana and malty caramel. Medium full bodied and really creamy smooth...this one is a real treat. Full flavored, the tastes are nicely mirrored from the nose and the earthy spiced yeast lingers nicely, adding a great deal to the total drinkability. A real surprise that this one is 8.7% ABV...wow!!"
"M/D: A decent amount of lingering alcohol and lift carbonation. Very smooth, could have a nice session of this paired with cheese or a good meal."
"D: Other than the knock you on the ass 8.7%ABV, this beer is sooo good, it's easily quaffable."
"Overall not my favorite style and could possibly use a little melanoiden character to add to its complexity but damn tasty regardless."
"Poured to a somewhat hazy brown/amber color with a good sized off white head that had some legs but left only a little lacing. The aroma is really inviting, wheat with a slight fruity (citrus) and banana aroma, some spice and clove as well. Though I would expect wheat flavors to come through there was a nice caramel and bread like flavor that came through. Think that this is what sold me on this brew. Other flavors that come through are banana and what I would think is pear. Some spicy flavors make a showing as well, nothing really dominates just a good mix.The mix of aroma and flavors go together really well, nothing over the top in this brew just a good example of an Weizenbock."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. There was a two finger off white foamy head that went away pretty quickly. This beer leaves mininal lacing. The color is a hazy light brown/golden and has lots of sediment floating in it. The smell is of wheat, fruit, clove, malt, yeast, Bread, ripe banana (very nice). The taste is sweet and of wheat, clove, fruit, and hops. It is a little boozy. The mouthful is very smooth, silky, foamy, and nicely carbonated. It leaves a light fruit/hop aftertaste in your mouth. In my opinion this is a great weizenbock."
"D: Definitely something I could sit down and enjoy several of."
"D: This is a tasty, occasionally great weizenbock from Victory. I have an issue with the carbonation (or lack thereof), and both the nose and appearance fall short of greatness. I continue to find that Victory brews interesting, unique beers, but this one (as with Yakima Twilight and Storm King, in my opinion) could use a bit more polish before it really shines."
"D: A very good example of the style with classic weizenbock flavours. A little too much heat on the back end and the fact I'd like a little darker flavour overall are really my only qualms. This is well made and could easily pass for a German version."
"D - A decent American take on the style, though no match for the Germans."
"D: Nicely balanced, sweet but not overpoweringly so. The sweetness doesn't stick with you. Goes down very easily and is one that I could enjoy a few more of."
"The first sip reveals a great mouthfeel on this one, and the wheat provides a great softness that keeps the carbonation just the right side of aggressive. The flavour is lighter on the banana than a lot of weizenbocks, and goes heavy on the clove. At first I didn't like this, but once the palate became used to the flavours everything seemed better integrated. There's a nice prominent wheat backbone, and its slight sourness helps to alleviate what could rapidly become a sweet and spicy disaster. Instead, what we're left with is a nicely balanced weizenbock that's spicier than most, but no less drinkable."
"I guess all those flavors hide the 8.7% abv because I didn't notice the alcohol at all. Maybe it accented the spices a bit but that's all. Now that I've tried this, I wish I had seen more than the 1 bottle on the shelf, I could see myself enjoying a bunch of these."
" This is a really good American-bock, complex and very easy to drink."
"D - This is a really good American-style weizenbock. Malty and darker than the German versions."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Overall this is a solid weizenbock, but didn't really impress me."
"D- Easy drinking. This will be a staple in my fridge from here on in. I absolutely loved this beer."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, but doesn't really compete with the better balanced Glockenspiel from GLBC in my opinion; definitely worth a shot and I'll like drink this again at some point."
"Victory scores a victory with their weizenbock. It is delicious, and it is warming. The best domestic weizenbock I've tasted."
"Very easy drinking, and free of any off flavors, but still lacking balance as well as the magic meal-in-a-glass satisfaction of the best Weizenbocks."
"12 oz. bottle. Hazy dark amber in color with a lackluster in size tan head. Moderately cloudy, though the SRMs are high enough I have to look carefully to see it. Okay retention and no real lacing. Smells of banana, raisins, figs, spicy sweet malts. Tastes of banana, clove, sweet dark fruits ala figs, and a spicy and cookie-like finish. Medium to full bodied with a higher level of lightly creamy carbonation. A bit too bubbly for my taste, though I like the creamy prickliness. Fairly good weizenbock, but honestly I gotta go with the Germans still."
"D - good, not great. good balance but missing a slight touch of pepperyness or something to give it character."
"Served: in weizen glass."
"D: It rounds out very well. Everything is mostly in balance, but I think it could lacked in body."
"Heavily carbonated up front with a lot of zest clove spice followed by a full yeasty/bready body with plenty of ripe banan and citrus pell and a tart dry finish. Clove is prominent but the darker caramel/choclate malt notes as well as the citrus and banana notes balance things out very nicely. The slight tart finish is what really separates this beer and makes it very flavorful. It lingers after the end of each sip and leaves me salivating for more. I have to stop myself from pounding this so I can fully enjoy it."
"D: This one goes down super easy. Very mellow and smooth for an 8% brew."
"Overall this is another good beer from Victory. I believe this is my first Weizenbock. Not my favorite style but i can appreciate this as a quality beer."
"Notes: This is a bottle review, but I purchased it after having this one DRAFT (amazing!). Easily, one of the best draft beers I had had. It still stacks up well in the bottle, but it loses some of the complexity of the kegged version."
"Big observation for this brew: TONS of floaty yeast crap all over the place, and I can respect that (if not be desperate to drink it). Appearance is an amber-orange color with a smallish head on top. This is a tasty one though, nice fruitiness all over the place. Nice mix of wheat, malt, and subtle hoppiness. A nice brew, if not the most unique of all beers."
"Pours dark orange with a frothy off-white head. Aroma is yeasty with vanilla and bananas, sort of smoothie-like. Flavor is similar with wheat bread, bananas, cloves, caramel, and a slight bitterness. Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Very drinkable for the abv, you wouldn't know it was almost 9%."
"Moonglow is a very solid beer, as I've come to expect from Victory."
"This beer scores well on drinkability. A lot of complex flavor packed into a beer that goes down quite easily. This is more in the style of dark weizenbocks, like Aventinus."
"Drinkability: Despite the high abv, this puppy went down very easily. It has a great flavor, aroma and its easy to put a few of these back at at time."
"Overall: Pretty good, but not as good as ze Germans. Good drinking, smooth."
"Well, it's a solid brew from Victory, none the less. Looking back at my review, I feel as if I may have been a bit harsh. I don't have any other Weizenbocks to compare it too, but I feel like there could be more to this style than just this beer. The flavors and aromas work to perfection, they just need to be amplified a little more."
"An intriguing combination of scent and flavor that provides an interesting alternative to the lighter, fruitier wheat beers I've had in the past. Drinkable, bar the 8.7% abv. Another very good offering from Victory, whose beers have only impressed me so far."
"Drinkability: Overall I enjoy this beer and look forward to it each season. Another solid beer from Victory."
"Although I've only tasted two domestic weizenbocks-this and GL Glockenspiel--this one is definitely my favorite. Kudos to Victory for hauling out a unique Fall seasonal."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber-brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into moderate lacing. The aroma is of banana, tangy wheat, alcohol, and a hint of clove. There is definitely more alcohol in this aroma than I have yet experienced in a weizenbock, and I'm not sure how much I like that. It seems to detract from the other weizenbock qualities. The taste is a lot like the aroma. Again, it has some nice banana, and clove to it, but way too much alcohol for my liking. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a texture that leaves things to be desired. Overall, this is a decent beer, but not a very good weizenbock. I could drink it again, I guess, but I wouldn't if better options were available."
"Very enjoyable malt bomb and a nice departure for those who can't seem to ever get enough of their hop fix."
"Pours a cloudy deep golden amber color. It is highly carbonated and leaves about 2+ fingers of head that doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Has a nice sweet malt aroma. Has an unmistakable wheat beer smell. It has a nice sweet flavor up front. There are some fruit notes, but they are very subtle. The sweetness is balanced very nicely by malt character of the beer. I normally do not like wheat beers too much but this is a great beer and the first weizenbock I have tried. It is a style I will have to delve into a little more."
"The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, opening spicy clove and banana opening things up, before the mellow sweetness kicks in, with sugar, caramel and a little burnt sugar as well. Quite fruity, I get a faint bit of mango-like character too. Bready mid-palate before a pleasantly phenolic finish with some spice (clove). Medium in body with a touch higher carbonation that it needs (but it dies off fairly quick) , the finish makes for an enjoyable beer. Another mildly disappointing aspect about the mouthfeel is that despite its heft, it doesn't really leave a lasting impression on the palate. I'm glad I revisited this, and finally got around to reviewing it."
"Conclusion: Good example of the style; I especially like how the typical banana flavors/aromas here kind of have a burnt/sauteed in butter quality to them."
"Drinkability: An agreeable Fall seasonal that isn't just another Pumpkin Ale or Oktoberfest. Although the alcohol isn't overly evident in the taste, it sure did sneak up on me later, providing me with quite a glow of my own."
"This is a sample from a local ""beer of the month"" that I belong to. Good beer as I wouldn't have tried on my own. It was the last of the six and probably the best !"
"Overall, very delicious. Easy to drink despite the ABV."
"Pours a cloudy caramel chock full of particulate matter. Fruity spiced aroma. The flavor is mostly cidery fruit notes with some caramel, clove and nutmeg. The fruit/caramel mix is great, the spice provides some bitter balance. Full, creamy, smooth body. Fruity finish. Interesting take on the style. Not the amped up hefe that Vitus is, not the dark, chocolaty take that is Aventinus. The caramel malt puts this somewhere in between. Darn good stuff, weizenbock fans rejoice."
"I'm always on the lookout for weizenbocks, and Victory finally sent Moonglow to Minnesota. I picked up a 6er and it was quite enjoyable. Very drinkable, maybe a little boozy in the taste. If I can find some more I may cellar a few bottles to see if the alcohol recedes with time."
"This beer demands a careful pour or you will be greeted by flakes of reasonably sized brown yeast in your glass which is quite unsightly compared to the normal clear amber color. This beer is really all about the yeast. Nose is full of clove, bubblegum, banana and a bit of malt. Taste is yeasty with clove and it has a warming dry finish that is minorly bitter but mostly spicey. Slight citrus hop character in the front as it warms. Light feel and carb."
"Man, this was a tough one -- if a beer can be bipolar, this is it. Loved the smell, taste started off great, but then turns on you halfway & becomes way too aggressive in the booze & carbonation department. I'm wondering if aging would help mellow it out some. Some really good stuff going on, but some pretty harsh elements as well."
"D: Pretty good. Not my favorite style of beer, but I enjoyed this one."
"This is a good example of a weizenbock, and it seems to walk the line between pale and dark. If it weren't for those ""off"" sips, this could be even better."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice representation of the style. I really enjoy this style and glad to see that an American brewery can make one that is pretty good. For how high the abv is, this one is pretty drinkable. I'd easily have it again."
"D- A little too much for the average drinker, but wheat beer lovers would love it, as I do. This is one of the best beers I have ever experienced. YAY For PA!!!"
"Crazy drinkable for an 8.7% beer."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very chewy. Alcohol is very well masked. Moderate carbonation."
"Unfiltered, hazy copper/orange pour with a thick, fluffy cream head with burgundy highlights. Excellent retention and thick webs of lacing. Fruity and spicy, but not overly complex or potent. Ripe apple and clove, yeasty, mild alcohol. Full bodied, high carbonation, very pleasant with a rich, flavorful sweet aftertaste with a mild alcohol presence. Flavor would be scored higher if not for a slightly medicinal taste that lingers stronger in the finish as the beer warms up. Otherwise, flavor follows the nose, more fruity than spicy, banana and apple with clove and corriander spices in midbody for balance. Another excellent Victory beer, I want to like this more, but I don't like the aftertaste."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. It is tasty enough that I could easily have a couple of these in an evening and I certainly will be returning to this beer again and again."
"Any beer as good as Moonglow is pretty drinkable. This is a great one, and it can be had a pretty fair price also."
"It was slightly syrupy on the tongue with the sweet aftertaste, a nice sipping beer but not all that complex."
"Pours a dusky, semi-transparent brownish copper. Head was thin, but that was probably an artifact of how it was poured. Spicy, wheaty, slightly yeasty aroma is appealing. Wheaty and spicy flavor has hints of caramel. Texture is lively and tingly, making this pleasant to drink."
"Overall this was a very smooth beer with tons of complexities and popping flavors. Well worth a shot."
"Moonglow pours a nice amber-ish-cloudy with a lasting head. The aroma is spicy with a bit of clove and fruit. The flavor is sweet and spicy upfront with some banana/spice and then slowly fades into a long lasting similar finish. The body is a bit thin. It's interesting to finally go back and taste this brew after many years. On that note (and after having quite a few other quality weizenbocks over the years), I don't think this brew is as good as I previously thought. It's not bad for an American attempt, but there's a moderate grape soda flavor mixed in with a hint of plastic/Band-aid which I don't care for in the style. I seem to be rating this one lower than most other people. If you like weizenbocks, then don't worry about what I think. Go ahead and try this one for yourself."
"Drinkability was quite good. I was shocked to come here and see that this brew weighs in at nearly 9% ABV. I didn't pick up on that at all while drinking it. Blended nicely."
"D - Well, I won't have any trouble finishing this one off. I could probably have another, though I won't. I've had weizenbocks more and less drinkable than this, and my score reflects that. Overall, it doesn't stack up to my favorites(Aventinus and Vitus), but it's good and has some unique characteristics."
"This is a kick ass beer. Strong and flavorful, this one can warm you up in a hurry during the colder months. Imagine the Victory St.Victorious bock blended with a good Franziskaner, and this is what you get."
"Orange amber colored beer with a slowly fading head,Aroma is wheat and spice.Taste is spicy and again wheat.This is too close to a witbier which I dispise.I try to like Victory products because they are in my city's backyard but they constantly keep letting me down.Thumbs down and I am considering never buying a Victory product again."
"My first weizenbock...me likey."
"Overall impression: This seems to be a great example of the style. Plenty of interesting flavors, nice and drinkable - a great fall beer."
"d- not great in my opinion, this is my first weizenbock and i think it's full robust flavor needs to be acquired, in all honesty i couldn't finish this bad boy, the moonglow won this round."
"I don't think that aging my Moonglow in the cellar did this beer any favors. The bottle said ""Enjoy By"" Aug 29, 08, so a year later I thought I'd give this a whirl. Looks fine when first poored, with a nice orange base and a rocky tan two finger head. But the head quickly fades and with little visible carbonation, the beer looks more like an uncarbonated cider. The nose is sweet and a touch of alcohol pokes through occasionally. The taste is also sweet with a slightly prickly carbonation that leads to a dry peppery hop finish. A little odd actually. I'll have to find a fresh one to compare."
"Despite the slight ding on mouthfeel, this is an excellent weizenbock - one of the best I've had. The aroma is world class for me and a bit thicker mouthfeel might have this one in the same league as Aventinus. As it is, it's a notch below which ain't too shabby."
"Drinkability: Definitely a late evening sipper."
"D: Even though I dished out $11.00 for this six pack, I'm glad I will be able to enjoy the other five instead of wishing I never purchased it. It's a nice beer to sit down and relax with. Has a lot of character."
"but its flavor is sort of abrasive and I do not find the spice pleasant, by no means is it like any bock ive had, seems more like a tripel, had to drainpour and get a bigfoot to get the taste out of my mouth"
"Victory Brewing seem to do German interpretations better than just about anyone in the New World. Their fresh hop Braumeister Harvest Pils is unquestionably the best German pilsner I've had, ditto for their altbier. The Moonglow Weizen Bock, although maybe not the best, may very well be my favourite of that style."
"D- not a bad drinker at 8.7% ABV, but still a sipper nontheless, i lfeel like it should be a lot drier and lighter for a weizenbock"
"I feel like I haven't properly evaluated this beer when it has such a high rating, but I just didn't like it. The tartness of the wheat and the bock just didn't do it for me. I don't know if I got a bad six pack or what. The tartness almost had a soy taste to it. woof, I expected a lot more drinkability out of Victory. Looks like it's just me though."
"d: fairly easy to drink but unfortunately not one of the better weizenbock's i've had"
"Overall, a very good representation of the style. I'd get this again."
"This is quite a nice drop that can be enjoyed year round in MHO. Try 2 or so in a session."
"D - Drinkibility is good. I like the way everything comes together in this beer (aroma, flavor, feel). It all just works to make a very nice product. The alcohol borderline gets in the way but there is a fine line between gentle warming and a flat heat. Glad I got to try this one out. I could definitely have this beer again, and again, and again..."
"This is my first Weizenbock, and it is great.... Will have to Try some other Victory Brews and more Weinzenbocks...."
"A real good weizenbock. Don't buy just one."
"All in all I was really impressed and wish I had more of it. I will definitely try this again."
"Pours a cloudy, rusty brown with amber hues. Yeast sediment quickly settles to the bottom of the glass after being swirled in the bottle. Beige head is tall but dissipates rather quickly leaving no lacing on the glass. Aromas of sweet malts; ripe fruits such as bananas, cherries and apples; some spiciness with hints of rum and yeast hit the nose. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Flavors are of over-ripened bananas, plums, and cherries, with hints of currants as well; nice malty sweetness; bready yeasts; and somewhat of a fermented bitterness that provides some balance. Alcohol is very well concealed. As it warms, the alcohol warms the mouth and throat, while the flavors leave some sourness on the tongue. Good Weizenbock."
"Overall a very satisfying beer. Solid as could be and perfect for a nice spring afternoon. Good offering here from Victory."
"smooth and almost syrupy but not viscous. moderate carbonation can be creamy at times."
"Postscript: As I approach the bottom of my glass, I find that the yeast appears to be floating in larger particles than usual, and none is sticking to the bottom -- it all remains suspended. I think I may actually have gotten a bad bottle (or six-pack) of this beer. I know it's a seasonal release, and we're now two seasons out, so maybe it's better when fresh? I intend to revisit this beer in the fall."
"Served a nice hazy orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is loads of burnt caramel, clove and dried fruits. The beer is quite flavorful with loads of malt bite, fruit and molasses. The beer is medium bodied with somewhat well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable weizenbock."
"This is a really drinkable beer. One of the smoothest beers I've had."
"Overall I am quite impressed with Victory on this one. Although brewing with a solid wheat yeast isn't terribly challenging, disguising that abv in a wheat beer is something to be marveled at. The color is beautiful on this one, and it is an easy drinking, yet warming brew. A solid offering from Victory, they have gained back a bit of my respect with this one, which they had nearly lost for good (aside from the staple that is storm king). Good beer."
"Pretty drinkable, don't get this beer often, but it always impresses. Another delicious brew from Victory."
"Overall, this is one of the finest weizenbocks I've had. Quickly recommended to all!"
"Moonglow is a kick ass Weizenbock. Very impressive in all respects. Well, maybe the nose could use a little work. Small gripe. I'm really impressed with this beer otherwise. It's actually a little depressing to drink. This is one of the very few Victory releases that I haven't seen in Ohio. Who knows? I certainly wish we did. This is one I'd pick up every fall if we did. Highly recommended."
"Not a beer that everyone will be a fan of, but then that goes along with this style. I have had better representations of this style but always end up picking up some of this when it comes out since it is solid example and readily available."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, and this would be great on a warm summer night. It's hard for me to judge this one, as this is a new style for me, but to me, it tasted a lot like a watered-down tripel. I enjoyed the beer though, and it was very easy to drink."
"This beer poured a copper-tinted brown with a big dark-beige head that lingered for a while. The smell is sweet maltiness with a bit of banana and alcohol. The taste starts off with some sweet citrus that lets you know it's a wheat beer followed by some fruity banana that gives way to a little toasted malt and spiciness with some alcohol warming. The mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy with very light carbonation. This beer is a great version of a totally underrepresented style that I'd highly recommend to anyone who can find it."
"(D) A good beer. Very complex in the traditional bock characteristics. Substantial ABV which is not entirely noticeable but definitely a reality. Save this beer for fellow drinkers who appreciate German and Belgium styles."
"Clear copper with some floaties and unreal head that billows over the top of the glass. Rich fruitiness in the nose is raisins, cherries and raspberries. Taste is hefty. Dark sugary molasses, rich berry fruit, assertive hop bitterness fight for dominance. Fairly sweet and heavy body isn't quite smooth though despite the low-ish carbonation. Doesn't feel nor taste quite right - there's a lot of flavour here, but this needs some refinement IMO. seems too heavy and sweet."
"Drinkability: Tastes great, great body and mouthfeel. Higher ABV, but with a taste this good...I'm pretty sure I don't care. I could easily have 2-3. Recommended"
"Drinkability is good, it's a good smooth beer that goes down easy. I will order again."
"D: This is yet another drinkable beer from Victory. It goes down easy and has plenty of character."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and lively with plenty of carbonation."
"Picked this up in a six pack with the help of BA reviews. I wasn't disappointed a bit. I am a Hefe fan and wanted to try something with a little more oomph than a summer Hefe. It poured a beautiful copper/orange hazy color. The smell hit me immediately. Bananas and clove. The taste was phenomenal. It improved in taste as it warmed a bit. Surprisingly drinkable with an 8.70% abv. I could easily drink three or four of these over the course of an evening. I continue to love the products Victory puts out!"
"D: A winter warmer indeed, this one will keep you comfy at night. A stand-out weizenbock."
"Mmmmm, flavor is damn tasty as well. Has a soft, full body. Chocolate comes through a bit more in the taste as well as the cloves...bananas are still lurking in the shadows, but not nearly as prevalent as in the nose. Only complaint I have is a slight minerality that is a tad distracting, but still, this is one of, if not the best American WB I have had."
"D-This is a very nice Weizenbock and is sweeter and spicier than most I have had. The spiciness of it makes for a nice Christmas beer. A job well down by Victory, I haven't had a new (to me) beer of theirs in awhile and this was ling overdue."
"D - This is a nice style done by Victory...the alcohol is masked by tons of flavor...I could drink three of these in a night and be very happy!"
"Not as good as Vitus or Aventinus and not what I expected but good nonetheless."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a SA pint glass. It pours a hazy orange with a big fluffy head. There are fruity notes on the nose with a hint of phenol and cloves. It taste sweet and fruity. There are no hints of clove or bannana. The finish has a lingering sweetness to it. The beer is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer is very drinkable, the 9% ABV is not noticeable."
"D: So yeah, I was not expecting too much from this beer and I was foolish for doing so. This beer is actually pretty damned good. Victory has my respect. Lum has yet again sent me a great brew. I don't think he has sent me a beer I wasn't fond of or wanted more. This beer is actually top notch as just a brew and also for the style. Just fantastic."
"D- Great, but I'm going to have to be very careful with this brew. The alcohol can hardly be tasted."
"Poured a darkish copper with two-finger head and some lacing. A semi-sweet malt smell, like caramel and honey with hints of roasted malts, plus some mild fruit notes in the smell. This beer is full-bodied and a thick; a great sipper. All packed into this beer is a creamy body that has a sweet, sugary taste along with both dark and tropical fruits like banana and apple (not tropical, I know) and sweet malts. Mildly warming but no alcohol burn (ABV hidden nicely) for a robust but smooth finish. I recommend this to any beer drinker for sampling."
"Murky cider brown with suspended bits of yeast from top to bottom. A thick foamy tan head drops pretty quickly leaving behind some webs on the glass...soon though it's gone completely. As expected the aroma is very yeasty. Apple, banana, clove, vanilla bean, caramel, even some grapefruit...very ""to style"". Rich, fruity flavor complimented by peppery phenols. Light banana bread too. Creamy yet light on the tongue from the lively carbonation. A slight warming sensation in the throat is the only hint at its strength. Good weizenbock."
"This beer straddles the line between German tradition and modern U.S. big beer brewing. I like it, but there are some German versions that trump it easily. Still, a pretty great twist on the style."
"D - Alcohol is pretty well hidden but is there. Pretty fruity. I think I would top out at two before having to move to something else, and that might be a bit much."
"Good camp fire drinking. I'm not a huge weizenbock fan but this was great...for hippies."
"d: Only a couple of notches below Aventinus I think. Great stuff from Victory."
"An easy drinking Weizenbock from Victory. Good stuff."
"The mouthfeel is no letdown, either--smooth, just the right carbonation, good malt heft. If I weren't heading around town, I would have had a couple more. Like so many others that Victory makes--Golden Monkey, Hop Wallop, Storm King, and Old Horizontal--Moonglow is an excellent beer. Great stuff, and not to be passed up. An excellent Fall beer, nice for a good, cool evening."
"Taste is pretty comparable to the smell. Banana like yeast flavors, solid dry malt backbone with little sweetness lingering. Musty, old flavor with a slight refreshing sweet hop aftertaste. Honestly this is not what I expected. I thought it was going to be more of a strong, lighter, high alcohol beer.. sort of like Hevelius only lighter. But I'll take this as a learning experience. The BA description of Weizenbock basically describes it as a strong Dunkleweizen and that's exactly what it is and they do it well. It's fruity, sort of like overripe apples, with a lot of banana flavor from the yeast exactly like Franziskaner Dunkleweizen. The alcohol mixes really nicely with the Dunklweizen flavor and makes it very enjoyable. I once bought a case of Franziskaner Dunkleweizen and after 20 of them or so became increasingly intolerant of its musky Germanness and this is definitely bringing back those memories. Really amazing to see such a dead-on German style from an American brewery and so well done."
"the 8.7 abv is a little high for me, but hey everyonce in awhile it works, like right now"
"oh, did I mention the head? I have a glass of a finger of head left after the beer is gone."
"The flavor is much like the aroma--sweet, but not coy. Light wheat. The body appears thick with the below average level of carbonation. The power of the swallow dies quickly in the aftertaste. Warm alcohol presence as well."
"Drinkability: Incredibly light and smooth, and had no idea the ABV was as high as it is until I was writing my review. A really light beer, but certainly warming. Alcohol is completely masked, and I would've put this in the mid 6's. This is one of my new favs."
"Drinkability is good. Not the best of this style that I've had but that smell! The scent alone will convince me to buy another few of these, and in my opinion, this would make an amazing summer beer."
"D: A clean finishing beer without any unpleasant alcohol aftertastes."
"Drinkability- The 8.7% is hidden pretty well. I think I could handle two but no more."
"Smells of sweet wheat and dark fruits. The taste is the same and perfect blend of light malts and sweet fruits while some perfect bock flavors come through to even out with the citrus taste. Mouthfeel is flawless, it has the smoothest texture, goes down like water, the feeling only leaves me wanting more. Drinkablity follows as before, can't be beat. Get your hands on this!"
"Great beer, has a wonderful malt backbone, phenolics and esters complement each other well and are in good balance."
"D: IT was very enjoyable. The complexity made it entertaining to drink. It's heavy body and high ABV may make it a difficult beer to take long into a session but it is one worth trying, again and again."
"sixer from Whole Foods Vienna"
"4.5 D: Extremely complex and tasty, this brew has no flaws."
"Very nice brew. Supremely enjoyable."
"12oz bottle poured into a weizen glass. This is very nice looking dark orange, decent rocky head, looks great. Smells very fruity, spicy and malty. Taste is nice fruit and malt, surprisingly good stuff. This is one of the better beers that I have had from Victory."
"Taste is a continuation of the smell. Silky-smooth and creamy sweetness of citrus fruits (not so much banana, though), crisp and drinkable. Slight taste of spices. Very clean taste, no bitterness to speak of. Little alcohol taste prevalent. Another high-quality offering from Victory."
"M + D: A nice, somewhat chewy medium body. A little stick, but it seems to be kept at bay with a balancing oily kind of slickness that has it almost melt into a residue and drift over the mouth. Interesting... quite a tasty beer, and a good call when in the mood for a good weizenbock."
"Notes: This is the second Weizenbock that I have tasted/rated and I have thoroughly enjoyed both of them. They actually are quite similar imo."
"To my palate the alcohol came across rather strongly, and for a Weizenbock, this one seemed to me to be too clovey and not nearly malty enough. Drinkability suffered due to the alcohol content, but overall this isn't bad at all, and should be sought out by any fans of Hefeweizens, Dunkelweizens, and Weizenbocks alike."
"Drinkability: Alcohol is well-hidden for the strength, so be careful, and overall this was a really nice beer. It's very attractive, radiant almost (like a moonglow?), has a very attractive aroma and mouthfeel, and if there were only a few more sweet notes to balance all the tart yeast esters, this would be a fantastic weizenbock. As it stands, it's a pretty darn good one, and comes recommended."
"Drinkability is high here. This is a great session beer if it wasn't so high in abv. Good stuff from Victory."
"Really nice drinker; silky and full-bodied with great fine carbonation."
"Good head when poured into a pint glass and once it settles it becomes a good steady lacing. Darker amber coloration gives off a good winter time beer look. When smelling the beer it gives off a good malt and spice tickle for the senses. As a unfiltered beer it is a excellent mild malted spiced beer."
"Pours a hazt, opaque, brownish-copper colour. Unbelieveable scents, wheat, cherry, gooseberry, etc..Great head, goes nowhere. Full flavor, all kinds of flavors. Fruity and nutty, and a nice swish of hops on the back. What a great beer, will revisit as soon as I can find it again!"
"This is a great beer, a must try. Pours a a dark hazzy copperish color with a nice dirty white head. Decent lacing. Has a nice spicy, yeast nose to it. The taste is a fruity one that is very subtle and at a whopping 8.7 you can barely taste the alcohol. This beer has a high drinkability cause i love it. Delicious."
"D - I really wanted to like this beer, but after having one in a more casual/less critical setting last night and having one again tonight to review it, this beer just doesn't quite cut it in terms of taste. The taste isn't bad or off but it's not well balanced, and the huge presence of bitterness pretty much lowers the drinkability of any wheat-based beer, and all that alcohol pulling through makes it hard to appreciate the mild and sometimes subtle fruity flavors going on. Not a bad beer, but the taste really needs some work."
"There's no doubt that the 8.70% ABV of this beer can be felt not too long after the first mouthfuls of this go down. No matter. Out of all the beers I've tried from Victory, this is my favorite; and that's saying a lot cosidering they have some pretty impressive offerings in their portfolio. This is amazingly complex, harmonious, and has the aftertaste on the level of a fine champagne. If you want to celebrate the fall and wish to get away from the Marzens and Octoberfests, this is your beer. Cheers to victory for upping the ante on the Weizenbock style!"
"D: I have really been enjoying these as of late. Not a session beer by a long stretch but I do enjoy one after work quite a bit. My only regret is it is a seasonal. Almost $12 for a six pack hurts but it is really good. Recommended."
"Drinkability on this beer is good. There are a lot of nice tastes to it that are all interesting. Every sip brings a bit different taste to it, so it is hard not to take the next sip..."
"D- another great beer by victory. i havnt tried anything i havnt loved from them. good seasonal beer thats easy to drink a couple of. just watch out, like most of their stuff this one is alot more potent than it seems. recommended."
"Pours an orange/reddish brown color with a big 2 finger white head, definitely looks filtered. Nice nose, one of the best from Victory ive ever had the pleasure of sniffing. Earthy wet wood/ash, peppery, spicy yeast, cloves, lots of sweet wet malts and cherry/dark stone fruit, banana, even some vanilla notes come through. Smokey flavor much like the nose, mildly big and very complex, but executed perfectly, very clean, great balance."
"D - After the really nice aroma, I expected more from this one. I felt the beer was a tad on the mild side for a wiezenbock, but that bar has been set pretty high by Adventinus...The finish felt muddled and lacked focus to me. Not bad by any means, but still thiner than expected. I would consider this an average example of a great style."
"D - This is a complex yet tasty Weizenbock from Victory. While a bit of alcohol does sneaks its way in there, at 8.7% ABV, the drinkability is quite good. I must try this one on tap during my next visit to Victory if it is available."
"Definitely a nice, quality, elegant sippers brew. I will get it again."
"Drinkability is good but hampered just a bit by the boozy finish. This is not a style I'm very familier with and I will seek more weizenbocks out in the future."
"Pours a translucent brown in color with plenty of ""chunkies"" floating around in the beer. Very nice inch and a half of frothy beige head. This looks nice. Smell is spice and yeast. There's some definite spice in the taste as well, but I just can't seem to put my finger on it right now. Crisp and smooth on the mouthfeel. Plenty of lemon zest in the flavor as well. This would be an incredible spring time, beer garden beer on draft! Enjoyable!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat tart. This is an excellent beer."
"12oz bottle, purchased from Consumers Beverages in Buffalo (I think). Best before date of August 08. Pours a cloudy murky brown. Nice spicy and yeasty aroma. The mouthfeel is tingly upfront before giving way to the typical warm weizenbock flavours - though it feels less fulfilling than, say, an Aventinus."
"Moonglow weizenbock pours a slightly hazy hazy amber brown with a nice lasting head. The aroma is sweet, spicy and slightly phenolic and estery with tons of brown sugar and molasses. The flavor is malty upfront but not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggests. There is lots of spicy, estery character from the yeast. The finish is warming and slightly alcoholic."
"all in all, totally delicious and a must try for wheat beer lovers."
"I think American Weizenbocks should have a separate style category from their German counterparts, since the American Weizenbock descends more from an American Pale Wheat Ale, which is barely anything like a Hefe Weizen. This one comes pretty close to being a German version though. Maybe once you caramelize the matls enough it's too hard to create a difference. This one is smooth and easy to drink, with a good amount of complexity. Recommended."
"Pours with a cream, five-finger head, fades very slowly and leaves a good lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color with a lot of floaties. Nose is yeasty. Flavor is sweet, yeasty, some caramel. Higher ABV is hidden. $2.15 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA"
"Drinkability - for all the wheat based beer styles, weizenbock is my favorite, and Victory has a fine one here."
"Recommended..."
"A cloudy dark amber beer. Has a small beige head. The aroma has a slightly musty ripe banana character with a hint of clove in the background. The alcohol and the clove introduce themselves to the front of your tongue while the soft banana character takes over the middle. A nice light caramel malt note at the back of the throat precedes the tummy warming alcohol after effect."
"Overall, this was an awesome beer that I will continue to buy and enjoy!"
"D: decent beer overall but not as good as many others. this is very easy to drink though."
"D: Delicious flavors wrapped around an extremely smooth feel make for an exceptional fall or winter beer from Victory."
"pairs well with a nice tender German Beef Roast garnished with pickles, onions and carrots over noodles."
"Excellent brew!"
"Pours a nice cloudy golden amber/brown color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus creamy tannish head, which leaves some very nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice touch of spice and caramel. The taste is awesome, slight sweetness, malty/yeasty, some spicyness, and caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, a very nice well-rounded brew. Very drinkable, it's been awhile since I've had a Victory brew, but it is very delicious as I remember them to be."
"This is a great example of the style. It pours an amber color with a fair amount of sediment in the bottle. The smell is an excellent balance of clove and banana. As far as taste goes, this beer is exactly what I am looking for when I want a weizenbock - sweet, spicy and complex. It is remarkably drinkable for a beer with almost 9% ABV, and I wish Victory would distribute it to the Northwest."
"Pours a clouded amber brown with no head. Sediment swirling around. Oops. Should have made a more careful pour. Nose is like cherry wood. Thick and meaty. Sugars and an overall deep red fruit scent. Flavor is meaty too. Nice even sweetness. Feel is low on bubble and thicker and syrupy liquid feel hits your tongue. Very drinkable. Definitely a good brew."
"Pours dark amber with a thin head. Predominately malt aroma with clove and nutmeg spices in the background. The malts predominate the taste with some banana and clove as well. There is a bit of spiciness in the after taste to round it out. Some tingling carbonation is also present."
"D: Yes yes, this is ridiculously easy to drink. I love the refreshing nature of the wheat beer in this dark, well-balanced weizenbock."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. Great in the autumn for those first two weeks when it just starts to get cold at night, but still warm during the day."
"Ah well, maybe weizenbock is just a tough style for domestic brewers to get right. Or maybe I'm just spoiled from having Aventinus so much. Either way, it's close, but just way too hot."
"Drinkability: Above average American example of this beer style. It may be more appropriate to label this one as a Dunkelweizen than the weizenbock. Very enjoyable drink and easily sessionable. (4.0)"
"I think this one has quickly earned it's way into my list of favorites. A cloudy copper color brew with lots of tiny particles dancing around under a medium, light tan head with a carpet of lacing throughout. It has a tart wheat aroma with some apple, clove and nutmeg. Mild but attention getting. The taste brings a creamy and deliciously mellow blend of wheat and apple, very consistent with the aroma. It's nicely carbonated, refreshing and flavorful. A Christmas inspired taste I would say, but nothing goofy, very ""tasteful"". Lot's of clove, licorice/anisette with a near perfect body. This is not a style that I am highly familiar with at all but whatever this is, it's good. Makes you want more for sure. Try ths out for yourself!"
"An awfully clean 8.7% beer - goes down smoothly enough that it isn't a sipping beer. Fortunately or unfortunately, I bought just a single, 12 oz bottle of this stuff. It would be too easy to have another."
"Mouthfeel is very tingly upfront and all through the mouth, then undergoes a hot alcohol burn. Finishes dry and crisp and puckery."
"D: Well done. Another winner from Victory. This one's a sure bet for a great autumn seasonal. Still not quite as good as Aventinus, but pretty damn close. There aren't many weizenbocks that are readily available. However, this is one of the best."
"Drinkability - My first weizenbock in a 6'er and a very pleasant experience. Having all the wheat spices in a darker, powerful brew like this instead of a lighter weizen/weiss beer was a great contrast. This brew delivered on all fronts and this should be no surprise as Victory gives us another winner!"
"T : Love the wheat in here, the alcohol catches up with you awfully fast. Complex and unique. This is the beer to sip on to welcome in the cooler weather."
"I do like the Aventinus from Schneider more than this (if you like this style and never had it, go to the store right now - shouldn't be too hard to get ahold of), but this is definitely the best American brewed version of the weizenbock. A fantastic example of the style. Victory's ""bigger beers"" (Hop Wallop, Old Horizontal, Storm King, St. Victorious) are some of the best beers available. Definitely just a great brewery at the top of their game."
" Get up and get some!"
"When I first started sampling this seasonal beer, I ran into some bottles that had gone sour even they weren't that old and had been well cared for after they'd been purchased. Victory seems to have improved their quality control with respect to this beer since I've not had a bad sample in the last couple of years. This beer has a unique taste and is not for every beer drinker."
"Pours a hazy golden brown color with a rather explosive off-white head that left some real nice curtain lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is of a good German wheat brew; banana and bubble gum and some nice spices. The flavor is much more subtle. The taste is of banana and bubble gum but is quickly followed by a big toasted malt presence. There is quite a balance by the sweet weizen phenols and bitter toasted malt. The feel is moderate and very well balanced; perhaps finishes just slightly bitter. This is a great brew. Good hefe qualities and a good malt presence."
"Pours a cloudy copper color with a tan head. In the aroma, a dry banana and it is also a bit nutty. In the taste, sticky sweet/ dry banana and a small wheat presence. A smooth dry mouthfeel and a dry fruity aftertaste. Almost like drinking banana nut bread. One of the better weizen bocks, a great beer."
"D - abv is up there, but if enjoyed slowly, a few of these isn't a problem."
"This one is pretty good and drinkable. The alcohol lets it be known but does not oeverpower the drinkability."
"this was a good beer, but I doubt I could drink more then one in a session"
"Ruddy brown hazy liquid with a nice finger and a half of head, yeast swirled into the glass (yummy yeasties). The smell was very strong with banana, medicinal phenols and maybe a little bubblegum. Taste is similar, balanced well with the alcohol and the yeast from the bottom of the bottle. Mouthfeel was good, creamy almost but still light. I think i could have three of these in a row, but probably no more. The alcohol and the strong flavor profile would get to me. Great beer overall."
"Overall- A delicious and potent beer here. I would rate higher if the alc was less present but still quite good."
"A definite winner."
"I don't think I would drink a 6-pack of this, but I will continue to buy Moonglow. Really a nice change from a lot of hefe's I have been having. I think I will enjoy the style"
"O: Very drinkable considering the malty sweetness and the high ABV."
"This is a yummy beer in the bottle (almost as good as it is on draft at the source) and is therefore dangerous at almost 9% abv."
"This beer pours a moderately dark amber color with little to no head. The smell is big and wheaty, with very little hops or anything else. Its clearly a moderate malt used, but a darn lot of it. The taste is huge, and has three distinct stages: the first is light and effervescent, and reminds me of a light beer with flighty taste. About 20% into the taste a sizable wave of the medium malts creeps up from behind and surprises the back of the tongue. The final taste simply lingers after the titanic wave mentioned before, and sticks around for a long time. This beer does not dissapoint, but I wouldn't expect anything less from Victory. Well worth seeking out."
"Too drinkable, tasty stuff and watch the ABV. Not bad at all, but Aventinus is still better."
"This is a nice beer overall. Very well-done for the style and full of flavour and balance. Try it."
"Drinkability: So drinkable. I would have never imagined the ABV."
"Full mouthfeel and the carbonation is in its proper place. Drinkable despite the high abv, but I'm happy after one. A unique, but solid take on a weizenbock, which I may return to once the season cools and to pair with a nice slice of apple or pumpkin pie."
"D - oh sure, yes it's nice. It will sneak up on you, about 8+%"
"Ranks 1 beer on the drinkability index. Ok once in a while, not something I'll actively seek out again."
"The taste is pretty solid, again the ripe apples and bananas coming right through, flanked by a light but adequate carbonation and yeasty spices that stick around and combine with tasty burps for a long, lingering aftertaste. The mouth is pretty full, actually very smooth and creamy, almost a little too thick. Can't say I've had too many of this style, but I do like my wheats, so perhaps I'll have to get into a German kick. As for this beer, can't say I've picked up everything here, but it sure is tasty. Props to MuenchenerKindl (I think) for this one!"
"There's a lot going on with all the fruit, spice, and warmth, and all of it just makes me love this style even more."
"D-not my thing, but I could probalby have a few"
"D- I like this one a lot. When it gets released again I will have to try and get my hands on a 6-pack of this. One of the best Weizenbocks I have had."
"drinkability - Ver interesting, malty, fruity, and sweet. I enjoyed this. a Nice sipper I think."
"Don't drink and review."
"Thanks for the bottle nlmartin!"
"This is a *good* weizenbock with an amazing smell! Poured a cloudy reddish brown like rusty rain water poured from an old pipe. Slightly off-white head vanished in 20 seconds leaving a ring of frost around the liquid's edges. Smell was colossal banana and toasted grain; like smelling banana bread dough! Absolutely fantastic. Taste was a slightly above average, and even with an above average taste, after the incredible smell, even 3.5 was a bit disappointing! Taste was a bit sweet with a bit of spice. Finished mildly sour. Reminded me of a half-dozen or so other weizenbocks. Mouthfeel seemed pretty average for the style being neither remarkable nor offensive. Drinkability was quite nice. I could see making it through two or three of these throughout to course of the evening. At nearly 9%, the alcohol is concealed very well indeed. Thanks to Aprilluvsbeer for this one! Glad I tried it."
"Victory is such a cool brewery, I'll have to go someday."
"D: Good enough to have again, but not ranking with the best of the German weizenbocks IMO. I have one more bottle, so it'll be interesting to see if the same 'ocean' flavors are there in that one...worth a try..."
"This reminds me of Aventinus, the epitome of the style. It may not be quite as well done, but great for an American version."
"This is a great stab at the weizenbock style and another feather in the cap for Victory."
"In the dying frostiness of winter, with spring beckoning, this is an apt and nicely made beer. The wheat is forcibly sweet, but in an enjoyable assertive way, and the bountiful fruits are a gracious zymurgian gift. The ABV is about as crafty as one could be, sneaking up as you drink, imparting a comforting warmth while it zotzes your synapses. In spite of that, it is quite easy to drink, but it requires a knowing caution, if you value your next-morning well-being. As the style goes, you'd be hard pressed to find a lot better made on this side of the pond. And I'm told it's even better on draft, which means I have to find it."
"D: Much different than something like Aventinus, but just as nice. Curiously fruity and easily drinkable. Try some."
"Another victory for Victory."
"Pours a copper-amber color with a pleasant looking head. Aroma is fruity, predominantly banana. Taste is excellent. Dark and complex, fairly sweet, with a nice blend of wheat, malt and spices. Pleasant aftertaste, with no hint of bitterness or alcohol. Very drinkable beer; another hit from Victory Brewing."
"Poured from the bottle (""Enjoy by Sept. 15, '07"" written on label) into a weizen glass. Pours an interesting range of colors, from light orange/amber at the base and top to deep reddish-brown in the heart of the body. It's a pretty beer alright. A nice two-finger head settled after the pour, but dissipated quickly leaving no real evidence of lace. The aroma is sweet with notes of apple, raisin, plum, and pear. Some cinammon stick is hidden deep within, as well as other holiday season spices. Also I can smell butter crust. Is it me, or does this thing smell like a fresh fruit pie? A damn good fruit pie at that. The taste is refreshing. I can detect some banana, apple, pear, and even some orange in here as well. There's a woody feel to it as well. It has a pleasant balance between the malt and hops. It's a fruity weizenbock, to be sure, but the malt holds its own, and the hop content keeps the whole thing from getting too carried away. The 8.7% ABV could easily sneak up on you; the heat is completely overshadowed by the beer's overall flavor. A bit weak in the mouthfeel, in my opinion, which is too bad. It doesn't linger in the taste buds like some of Victory's other beers, or like some other Weizenbocks for that matter. As a result, though, it comes up short in the end. For such a nice beer, it would be great to have it resonate in the finish a bit more. Still, it's a thirst quencher and a fine brew."
"-Oelergud"
"Bottled Aug. 2006. Pours a hazy copper-orange color with a thin, light tan head which fades out quickly. Candy-like aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, caramel covered apples and ripe banana are noted with mild fresh yeast and hot dinner rolls lurking in he background. Pleasant, full, round mouthfeel with just the right amount of tingly carbonation for the style. Taste is sweet, reminiscent of banana-nut bread, caramel apple, crystal malts, fresh yeast and mild spices. Finishes with the slightest presence of hop bitterness to tame any cloyishness. 8.7% ABV is non-detectable; very smooth and stealth. Could easily polish off a few of these in one session A well done domestic reproduction of the style."
"Just a tad astringent, but good enough for slow sipping. Aromatic with a nice, spiced fruit taste."
"Good stylistically, but not my favorite. Bananas a bit too much for me."
"Very drinkable. Hides the abv very well. Would like to have a couple more of these more in season."
"Drinks very easy for the abv, a really nice weizen bock. I could session on this no problem"
"Pours a hazy, unfiltered caramel brown with a nice light brown head and some lacing. Smells strongly of bananas with some caramel and a hint of yeast. Taste is great. Strong taste of bananas upfront, which is almost a bit too much, with some other dark fruits, maybe plums, some malts and a slightly bitter finish. Nice mouthfeel with a medium-full body and a bit of carbonation. Hides the ABV extremely well. Good drinkability, this is a delicious weizenbock."
"This is the best of Victory's weiss offerings."
"Drinkability: I honestly don't know what to think of this beer. Sure it was good like all of the Victory beers I've tried, but I don't know if I ever would want to buy it again. I guess if I'm in the mood for a fruity American Weizenbock, then I might pick this one up again."
"D - I really enjoyed this much more than I expected. I think I'll pick up a case and share the wealth with others, because I've heard this same 'pleasantly-surprising' description from others."
"Pours a copper red color. Not much of a head, and just a bit of lacing. Smell is of sweet fruit. Medium bodied, with some carbionation. Taste is sweet, and bready. All kinds of fruit throughout. Rum raisn in the finish. Alchol is there, but not overwelming. Very,very good!"
"Arrived a rich copper color with a good inch of dense, foamy head. Smells of lemon and spice but most noticeable is banana. Initial taste reminded me instantly of fresh baked banana bread. Rich fruity and nutty. Alcohol is well hidden. Very fresh tasting. Delicious! I wish I had a few homemade chocolate chip walnut cookies to go with this. Mouthfeel could be a little heavier to back up the taste. I could easily savor 3 or 4 of these in the course of an evening."
"Taste is dominated by the ripe rich banana with the underpinnings of sweet spice. Alcohol is evident in the taste. Body is not overly sweet and sticky. Really tasty, great example of the style especially for an American brewery."
"Not quite Aventinus but definitely on par."
"Drinkability is mediocre for me. I like this beer but could only put down a couple, at most, due to its very sweet nature. Drinks more like a creamy wine than a beer."
"Overall a nice, and flavorful weizenbock. Solid ABV."
" I would love to try this beer again.I suggest giving this interesting beer a try!"
"The drinkability of this brew is unsurpassed, for the style with big ABV this beer is fir for a king. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Cheers"
"This is not a very drinkable beer, only because of the intense alcohol."
"My first sampling of the style, and I am impressed. An excellent fall style, crisp yet rich and warming. This paired excellently with their ""Victory Burger"" with peppers, onions, and hot pepper cheese."
"Very drinkable example of the style; absolutely flaw free. While just not as complex as Aventinus there is certainly no reason to not drink this if you find it."
"EDIT 10/07: Cellared 2-year old bottle from August 2005...tartness seems more present, a bit faded from it's former spicy character. Cidery and malty. It seems to lose a bit of it's depth. Not bad, not good. Best fresh..."
"Was looking forward to trying this one. Pours a hazy brown, small tan head forms, chunks galore, little bit of lacing. Smell is malty as all hell, some citrus, spice, vanilla dates, and banana bread. Taste is sweet, vanilla and citrus, dates, super malty through the middle, banana bread and alcohol finishes it out. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, pretty neat beer, thanks DrJay!"
"Aftertaste of sweet carmel and ripe banana with an alcohol warming. Nothing cloying...just sweet and warm."
"D: I'm really starting to get into these weizenbocks. What a great style. I'd recommend this beer to lovers of wheats and dark beers."
"Very good seasonal which I think Victory should make all year long."
"Wow, I can feel the heat in my stomach from the ABV on this one."
"A decent drinkable weizenbock. Flavor is a little more harsh than an Aventinus but still quite tasty."
"Overall not to bad, easy to drink, the high abv is hidden pretty well."
"and another gracias to BeerBeing."
"The more me drinks, the more me likes. The burniness was harsh, but only because I wasn't expecting it. After a little while, as the beer warmed, more yeast complexities came through--what had tasted like fire was actually a great blend of malt spices, and what had burned so bad started to be the fire that warmed my very soul. I was truly sad when this beer was finished."
"Drinkability - i never had a weizenbock, but definitely enjoyed this one"
"I just noticed that this beer is almost 9% - sorry for the vulgarity, but holy fuck! I would have thought around 6% - the alcohol is masked amazingly. I rather like this brew - chewy caramel, fruitiness, citrus, all the good stuff in there. Toss in a bit of alcohol and you are loving life. Lots of head and maybe a bit too much carbonation on the palate. Other than that, a fine brew,"
"Hazed amber colour with orangish highlights. The white head was a bit thin and reduced to a solid ring of fine bubbles in a short time. Malty caramel and wheat aroma with light alcohol, but the main player here is fruit - ripe banana, pineapple and plum. The flavour was very similar to the aroma, just bigger. Heavy malt with mild bitterness. Things blended together to give a banana bread-like character. Full bodied (just short of chewy) with medium/low carbonation. Off-dry. I really enjoyed the fruity character. Now to try this on tap!"
"Drinkability: The alcohol takes away from the sweet nectar of plums and molasses which would make this more drinkable than average. I was expecting more."
"Drinkability - goes down fairly easy, don't like the diacetyl thing is the problem here."
"If I ever see a fresher sample of this beer, I will definitely try it, but otherwise I probably will not drink this beer again."
"Thanks Len!"
"Mouthfeel is right along the middle of the road with lots of carbonation that fills the entire mouth as it goes down. A really tasty weizenbock that keeps me coming back for more. I'll be looking for this on the shelves again next year. Thanks to blitheringidiot for snaggletoothing this bottle for me!!"
"Mouthfeel- A good amount of dark sweetnes dances around the tongue for awhile. Lets not forget a little tart finish at the back of the tongue."
"Pours a bright dark amber with reddish highlights. Huge, fresh head. Aroma is quite sweet, with some banana and a ton of raisins and medicinal spices. Flavor starts out with a flash of bitterness before opening up to a sweet, juicy fruitiness. Very creamy mouthfeel; it doesn't feel like there's too much wheat in here. This is a very smooth, easy drinking beer, and something I could put away a few of over the course of an evening. Yum."
"D - what a great beer to sweet to get a full five but damn good and easy to drink"
"A great beer! Possibly my favorite by Victory. Its basically a wheat beer for the winter."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light tan head above the dark reddish amber brew. Foamy head lasts and lasts, and exhibits good lacing. Aroma is grainy malts, with fruity alcohol easily apparent. Taste is upfront with a fruity tart/sour, a light malt backbone, and then fades into an alcohol flavor, and leaves a chalky feel in the mouth. Seems like it should show more malt character to me. Mouthfeel and drinkability are quite low for me, but your milage may vary. Will plan on revisiting with a fresher bottle, and see if my views are consistent."
"Pours the color of unfiltered apple cider, maybe a little darker, but there is plenty of sediment and a huge head to match (about 3"" ). Smell is sharp, but smooth, fruity (apples and bananas), tart. Fruits are more subdued in the flavor, making it a sharper and drier beer. Slightly metallic coating is left behind, mouthfel is smooth, and relatively lightly carbonated. A good beer, I like the style, but this one doesn't blow me away."
"Musings: I've been on a weizen bock kick lately - thanks to the Greenpoint Gunner. This is not my favorite weizen bock - but not bad either. The taste is nice but is not complemented by the feel. It should be more substantial in the mouth."
"D: A decent attempt at a weizenbock that has some good attributes in the scent and taste categories along with room for improvement of depth in those same areas. The alcohol content is faintly noticeable throughout the partaking but in no way overpowers any other aspect of the beer. I'd be interested in trying next year's batch to see if the brewers have attempted to alter the recipe in any way and add some more complexity to this."
"Quite a drinkable brew for 8.7%"
"Victory does it again."
"This pours a cloudy reddish amber with a tan 2 finger head.This looks like apple cider.The smell has a fruity aroma with bananas,clove,wheat,and yeast.The taste a wheat,fruit flavor to it.There is a pronounced alcohol warmth to this beer. Cloves and bananas are very much part of the flavor as with the smell. The m/f is light with the flavors almost perfectly mixed. This is another great beer from Victory,maybe the best on the east coast."
"12 oz., bottled on 8/25/05. It pours into the weizen glass a murky brown/orange after the yeast and it has a 2 finger tan head that leaves some lacing. There are some small chunks floating around, and this combined with the color make it look like cider. It doesn't have much aroma at first, but when it comes around I detected bananas, yeast, a good spiciness, wheat, and maybe some sweet fruit/bubblegum aroma. The first flavors are spiciness and alcohol, but when it warms a bit, there are notes of bananas, fruits, faint hops, spicy phenols, and some tangy wheat in the background. The body is medium to thick and it feels better after a lot of the carbonation is released. A pretty good weizen beer."
"Pours a clear reddish but murky brown. Minute taupe head recedes quickly. Minimal lacing. Smells like a fresh fruit and candy bouquet that is just sweetly sublime . Taste is a nice yeast with ample helpings of pear, apple and a hint of caramel creme for good measure. Malty with a full and ritch syrupy like body. Alcohol is disguised realy well. No burn, just good ole' warmth. Easily drinkable considering it has a large ABV content."
"Thanks, BeerBeing"
"Drinkablility: I have been staying away from weizen style beers lately, but this is a good one that I wouldn't mind drinking once in a while."
"Pours beautifully cloudy, with quite a bit of yeast from the bottle (tried it both with and without the yeast, and prefer with). The head doesn't stick around long. Aroma carries strong scents of wheat and bannanas, which carry over to the taste. Sweet and complex, with a lot of fruitiness. The bottle I had was a bit over-carbonated, and the sharpness of the bubbles detracted from the otherwise creamy mouthfeel-- it was better after sitting a bit, but at first bubbled along like a Sprite! Too complicated (and too high an APV!) for a session, but high on my list of after-dinner beers for the season."
"thanks to richlikebeer for this. poured cloudy orange, with a white head that didnt last. aroma yeast, hops malts, lemon, a mild sourness. flavor lemon pops its head up first than got malt and hops a nice touch of alcohol, fruity. a nice way to start the drinking for New Years Eve."
"Pours a murky brown color with a tan-colored head leaving behind just a bit of lacing. Aromas of wheat, grains, alcohol, and caramel seem to come out. The taste is a perfect balance of malt & hops with a blend of fruit-like sweetness that is followed by hop bitterness. The finish is dry and sweet with a lingering sensation that is enticing. Excellent drinkability. Another great beer from Victory."
"Since todays moon is nearly full it has peaked above the horizon just as I have finished raking leaves and stopped to try Victory Moonglow Weizen Bock ( bottled six days after The August 2005 Full Sturgeon Moon. A clear caramel amber Bock with a careful pour- although I know better I did not swirl up the yeast in the pour. Well carbonated a 1-11/2 finger creamy moon colored head that could have given this Bock its name, persists and slowly becomes a full fat disk of bubbles outlined by a raised meniscus that rings the 0.4 L rastal sniffer. Tilted to my nose I notice the legs and lace on the sides of the New Belgium glass. Bananna esters and faint clove allow more faint fruit aromas to emerge - plum and perhaps pear. Alcohol more in the aroma than the taste helped by my choice of glassware and the 65°F room temperature of the beer. At 8.7 this Weizen Bock is smack in the middle of the 7 - 10 % abv range for the style. The alcohol warms but is completely hidden in the not quiet full bodied sweet caramel laced with spices and fruit flavors. A few of these and you will howl at the moon! Truely a thing of beauty - finally I swirl the 12 oz bottle and rough pour in the ""magical yeast strain"" responsible for this nearly excellent Weizen Bock. Nice yeast taste that muddys and moderate the aroma and flavors I have described above. I would have missed a lot of the joy of this beer had I swirled in the yeast at the first pour. Either way, I am moon struck by this haunting seasonal brew."
"Drinkability- Super easy to drink. Actually tries and comes close to giving Aventinus a run for it's money. Buy one if you see it."
"I poured into a pint glass, very nice color of reddish brown with about a 1 inch head. A lot of nice unfiltered goodies came out of the end of the pour which is something I really enjoy. Bananas are definitely at forefront with a nice sharp smell of cherries. Mouthfeel is very good and smooth. I would say this is a very drinkable beer without any type of burn. I like it a lot."
"it's no aventinus, but enjoyable"
"Moonglow Weizenbock is the best weizenbock that I've ever had and is one of the best beers from one of my favorite breweries (and is the single best non-hoppy one). It did more than meet my expectations, it exceeded them by a mile. I'd like to thank BeerBeing for sending me a classic fall seasonal that I'd gladly buy by the case if I was blessed with easy access."
"This is a very nice wheat beer. It pours a tantalizing hazy color. Just what one would hope for from an unfiltered wheat beer. The head was massive, even with a gentle pouring. The smell was very nice, a rather fruity and malty mixture. The taste was enjoyable, with fuity and malt undertones. Certainly a fine beer to be searched out and enjoyed."
"Drinkability  Simply very tasty, but also very complex; this is a real beer, it had turned me on to the style and those like it."
"Notes: Not my favorite by any means, but it wasnt bad enough to turn me off the beer or the style. Ill give another batch a shot and Im laying one down to see if the dark malts can gain any footing in this sweet juicy beer and maybe sour the fruit enough for some interesting flavoring. Ill report back."
"Enjoying a Moonglow in Duvel tulip glass. Appearance is a cloudy tan with a generous almond colored head that is still clinging to the side of my glass about half way through the beer. Smell is definitely banana, clove and ripe pear. A classic wheat beer nose! The taste presents huge malt sweetness up front, soon replaced with the aforementioned fruit and clove. This sweetness and fruitiness is very nicely balanced with a warming alcohol and burnt carmel finish. For an 8.5% alcohol brew, this beer is deceptively drinkable. A classic unfiltered Bavarian weizenbock and one which I shall be enjoyng on a regular basis!"
"Bottle said best before April 2005 but really who cares. This is a beer that seems to me to taste at times like Germany and at other like Belgian. The cloudiness and clove notes were present but I felt I was drinking a Belgian beer with all the yeasty flavours and aged hops. All in all a pretty good beer that is hard to pin down for style but like all Victory products well made."
"If you dig big Belgian strong darks, and huge german wheats and dopplebocks, but don't want to feel like you are drinking a day old latte, then this is your beer."
"cloudy brown with slight orange color. a thick tightly packed creamy tan head tops it off. the aroma is dominantly an almost candy like banana, there are cloves, yeasty breadiness, caramel apple like aromas as well. the banana takes a a more sudued role in the taste with the other flavors balancing better. some wheat and the caramel apple flavor comes through with a nice tang. beneath that there is the soft bicuity quality of the yeast. a faint allspice flavor is also detectable. there is a slight warming at the top of the throat that really adds nicely. the mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with mild carbonation only lubricating the process. good drinkability, very tasty with good complexity and at the same time easy to drink."
"Color was orange-amber, beautiful. Lots of carbonation and a tan-orange head, which dissipated quickly. Yeast in the bottle was swirled and poured into the glass. The aroma was very pleasant with lots of citrus, orange and lemon. Yeasty and definite hints of clove. Bananas, alcohol, yeast and citrus jumped out at you in the first taste, along with the feel of massive carbonation which actually faded quickly into a creamier feel. Definite spices, clove, lemon and orange, mild hops. Overall a very decent beer."
"Acquired in a trade from BA Px2GrafX, the beer poured out murky amber brown in color with a rich creamy head typical of most Weizen biers. The looks were like a Weizen concentrate, and so was the smell. The smells of banana and clove were found here with a pungency that other Weizens rarely ever exhibit. The taste was again very similar to a hyper Hefeweizen, with every phenolic element present, but only more so. Reminiscent of liquefied banana nut bread with spices, this beer went down very easily with not a single hint of the high ABV content. To add an American twist to the style, a definite hop bitterness was detectable towards the end of each swallow. Carbonation was extremely fine and gave this a creamy mouthfeel. What a dangerously drinkable beer! I can see this one getting someone is trouble quite easily, as it packs quite a punch that you can never see coming. Quite different from Aventinus, as this is more Weizen than Bock."
"First sip you are bombarded with juicy fruit flavors, like bananas, plums, and some grape-like vinous flavors. The yeast adds a distinct character as well, as does the overall warm malty wheat characters. Very clean tasting, crisp and refreshing as hell. The alcohol is also very well hidden in the taste, so this bad boy could sneak up on the uninformed. A delicious beer, back to front, one of the best I've had of any style."
"A note on the 2006 version: I had the bottle and wasn't too impressed the flavors were really suppressed. I already had a 1/6 on order so I had to get it; the taste difference was very noticeable. If you want to taste this beer at it's best get it on tap."
"Overall: I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I dig this one. The alcohol comes through a bit too much, but it's got a complex, interesting flavor nonetheless and a great mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is good. I'm a big fan of the style and I like Victory's version."
"overall: this is quite a delicious weizen bock. seems to be more weizen, though. tons of fruit, spicy flavors and pleasant alcohol warming. as good as this is, i remember enjoying the aventinus a touch more. i'll have to review that one soon for a comparison. however, this is an excellent must try for the style."
"Overall drinkable considering the sweetness of it- and the alcohol content- not my favorite thing, but a nice nightcap."
"Drinkability: Moderate. 8%+ puts it out of the session category, and I might tire of it after two or so. Still, a nice selection to mix with some other fall seasonals."
"This was my first weizenbock and I can't wait to try others. A highly drinkable beer, well hidden 8.7% abv. Can't wait to crack another one once I finish this one. A great fall beer to enjoy on a cool evening. Go and seek."
"Drinkability and Overall: While this is a superb tasting beer, it's a bit too much of an assault on the tastebuds to have too many more. This is definitly no session beer, but a late night sipper. A very good Weizenbock from Bill & Ron I'm sure I'll be getting more of."
"The body is light to medium. I think if more of a malt presence it would balance the beer out. No real strong phenol taste for a such a higher ABV, which is good. Overall is was worth the wait. I definite recommend."
"Drinkability: A treat for me. One's a great dessert or after dinner drink. Can't wait to try more Weizenbocks, but this one seems to be very worth it for me."
"Cloudy deep amber in color. Thick and creamy layer of tan-colored head rests eternally on the top of the beer. Incredibly thick rings of lace on the glass. Aromas are softly-noted bits of bannana, alcohol, caramel. Flavor is silky smooth layers of fruity esters, ABV warmth, spices. Finish is spicy, with some extract of vanilla poured over a caramel square. Good mouthfeel...thick almost. Drinkable...it sure went well right after the Arrogant Bastard pint before it."
"Drinkability: So drinkable."
"D - Amazing. This beer has an unnatural smoothness to it. I love it. It goes down very easy and at about 9% abv, that is a nice thing. It might have trouble meshing with spiced food. But would wash down blander dishes very well."
"Victory proves its brewing skills time and time again."
"Mouthfeel isn't as syrupy as its sugary taste implies, making it easier to drink than I'd imagined, but I'd stay away from ordering another full pint again because it's just too sweet for me."
"Light copper color with tons of carbonation bubbles. A thin off white head that hangs in for a long time. Smells include yeastyness, banana and just a hint of spicyness. The banana really comes out in the taste. Thin mouthfeel that seems appropriate for the style. Finishes smoothly. The high alchohol is well hidden at first but starts to show after a while. Not a beer that i will add to my favorites list because i'm not fond of the style but also not a beer I would turn down."
"This isnt bad tasting, but it doesnt scream Buy me again either. If I could get this a little bit fresher, I might be tempted to alter this. Unfortunately, there is no direct distribution to Spokane of Victorys wares. The staff at Jims Homebrew has to bring their beers here by buying them in bulk in Seattle and shipping them across the pass. Hopefully their undeniable Northwest popularity will encourage them to make their beers more available in my neck of the woods!"
"poured a deep orange-amber color with nice white head. Smell s banana, spice and vanilla mixed. Tasste is spice and bit too alcoholic for my taste.Finish is good and spice, but the alcohol predominates. A good beer, but a little too stong tasting for me."
"Single for $1.79 at Once Upon a Vine."
"An average beer, nothing wrong, nothing too interesting. Decent colour and appearance and smell and taste. Fruity, spicy, cloudy amber. Very good aftertaste worked well with pizza. Bit nauseating yeast. Perhaps another day,as following this I grew to love the style itself."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable weizenbock. This bottle was about three months past best buy date and still quite tastey."
"m/f is slippery but dense. starts with a burst of carbonation and continues through a bready, malt sweetness to an overwhelming hop bitterness, seems almost too young. sweeter and fruitier as it warms- the alcohol is evident in the bitter a/t. profile is a bit muddy but this is a drinkable and interesting beer. could probably hang out for another 6 months past its ""prime"""
"This poured with a rapidly disappearing off-white/tan head. The beer itself was a very cloudy orange color. The nose was the all-too familiar banana esters. I really liked the mouthfeel, which had a pleasant thickness to it. The finish had a really good spiciness, but not one of cloves, more like black pepper. There was also a sweetness in the mouth, but not of bananas or fruit, but instead, caramel. In fact, as it warmed, I began to taste notes of honey. There really was not a sweet aftertaste, instead it seemed almost dry, if that is possible. Definitely a candidate for a session beer and one that I could drink on a regular basis."
"The complexity of the flavor, plus the strength of the alchohol present in the taste make this a slow sipper."
"I had this on tap once while living up in the Philly area and am glad I got the chance to try this out of the bottle,poured into my Aventinus glass a slightly hazy deep orange with a thin white head that is gone quite quickly.Aromas of tart green apple and smoke with a light cloviness but not to strong,not to sure about the mouthfeel up front a little prickly but it got better as I drank more.Very flavorful and big,smoky to the hilt with some expected banana and vanilla.Seems much bigger out of the bottle wich is fine,the beer held up well considering the ""best before"" date was April 04 05."
"The layering and timing of the flavors in this beer were impressive, and taste is what counts in my book. Congrats to Victory for a commendable effort with an uncommon style. Recommended."
"This is not my favorite style of beer, but that being said, I think it was a nice representation of the style. As usual, a pretty good beer from Victory."
"Pours a dark hazy orange with a decent offwhite head that fades pretty quickly. Smells sweet like bananas with just a hint of clove and some other spices. Taste is very sweet, with a candy flavored malt and a very candylike banana flavor. Finishes with a pucker and a lingering of the spices. Very thick and smooth beer, a little syrupy on the tongue. A pretty nice spring beer, but not one I could drink more than a couple of because of the sweetness."
"Having said that - Beautiful cloudy amber/copper color, with a nice head that fades kinda quickly. Smells of banana and clove, and sweet malt. Great taste, it's really sweet and I've docked drinkability and mouthfeel slightly because it might be too sweet/cloying after a while, but I love the sweetness complimented by a nice warm boozy feeling. Delightfully dangerous, you don't realize how strong this is. I generally steer clear of wits, hefeweizens, etc, but this one is just amazing, full of flavor and well balanced."
"The label says Enjoy by April 4, 2005 and today is April 3, 2005 so Im cutting it close. I live in the same region as this brewery so I gave it a try since fresher beer is better beer. An unfiltered wheat beer was my first premium brew, a Franziskaner given to me by my German friend Frank Neubert. I always give unfiltered beers a good swirl. Beautiful color head went quick but it might be my pour. Really does smell like banana, I dont usually pick up fruits and such in the flavors. Good body. Tastes rich and complex, hops and malts pronounced. Alcohol is well hidden by the rich flavor; this could really creep up on you. I definitely recommended this brew."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber looking beer that is clearly not filtered with a good size head with good retention. Aroma is light roasted malt with some cloves/cinnamon. Taste is quite enjoyable with the roasted aspect mixing quiet well with the spicy (cinnamon?) and banana taste. Some bitterness can also be noticed at the end with a medium to full body."
"Overall, an exceptional beer. I've not had many beers from Victory (this is only my second) but if a brewery can make a beer like this, they're okay in my book."
"While I really enjoyed the balance of flavors it ultimately took away from a robust fruitiness that I would have liked. Nonetheless, really quite good."
"D- This is a ok brew. It doesn't have the malt characters that I was looking for and it wasn't as complex as some of the other commercial examples I've had. A nice drink but I will try some other weizenbocks."
"Clove, bannana, & bubble gum all in a great balance. Subtly spicy, with a lsight warming of the throat. Medium-full bodied, gently carbonation."
"Nevertheless a drinkable brew."
"It pours a slightly cloudy amber, and develops a bit of white head. The aroma is of malt and yeast. The taste is pleasantly sharp and sweet. Maybe a little banana in the start, a good bit of malt in the middle, and finally the finish is a satisfying alcohol burn wrapped up in dark fruits. I guess that wonderful finish is the moonglow. The feel is full bodied, bubbly, and bit syrupy. A solid beer, but not a great beer. While I wouldn't turn one down, I'm not sure I'd select it over others in the style."
"Pours a murky hazy brownish colour with a fluffy whitish head. Smell is of clove spice, a touch of cocoa and dried fruits. Taste follows aroma. Nice rich spice with just a hint of the weizen banana bubblegum esters. A sublte cocoa note follows through out the taste. Very nice. Mouthfeel is supple and good. Very easy drinking. Could drink more than a few of these if the 8.7 didnt lay me out first. As top notch weizenbock. Not quite Aventinus, but damn close."
"This Moonglow was amber in color and topping of with a beige head at the top. The head leaves rather quick but left behind a thin lace to the end of the glass. Notes of bananas, spice and fruit come to mind as you take a breath. Taste is a bit wheat then dark fruit play the flavor game. A mild hint of alcohol came into play. This beer was smooth and silky in the mouth and easy to sit down and enjoy several."
"Nothing I can write could possibly do this beer justice. If you see it buy it, you won't be disappointed."
"Recently purchased another 6er of this, best by 040405 on the bottle. wow, its definitely different then the first 6er. This one was abit lighter in color with no floaties/yeasties. The overall flavor was similar, however it reminded me more of a belgian triple then a wheat bock. Don;t get me wrong though. its still dam tasty."
"Once again, Victory does not disappoint on flavor."
"Body: Medium-high, good creamy mouthfeel."
"What a great beer. This unique brew pours a hazy orange with a bright glow. The head is average. The aroma of this beer is incredible. It made my fiance(sp?), Beerhater gag from ten feet away. The aroma is a funky, yeasty, fruity, spicy kick in the nuts. The taste is a spicy complex mix of sour cherries, tart apples, and bitter grapefruit with a balancing malt sweetness. It all goes down pretty easily with a medium body and warm alcohol. There is no hop flavor or aroma, just enough bitterness for a bitter finish after the sweet and sour flavor. This is a fine brew. Last year I was unfamiliar with the style when I first tried it and was blown away by the crazy flavor when I was expecting a strong hefeweizen beer, but this was quite different."
"A sure winner with a hearty potato, cheddar and turkey soup. Heck, throw a splash of this in your soup while cooking."
"2004 edition. Is is just me, or has this beer tasted better off the line in the past? Hazy dark amber amber in color with a very tall white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma is sweet spice/cloved mingled with banana bread, raisens, and caramel sweetness. Similar flavor profile. A touch lighter feeling than past vintages, a bit over-carbonated as well. Something is missing here, can't put my finger on it. I had Aventinus on draft recently and this can't touch it! Better luck next year."
"This poured out a cloudy sediment filled brownish bronze with a half inch of light tan head floating on top. No retention on the head as it quickly faded to a cap of bubbles leaving little lace. Aroma is quite fruity sweet with a good bit of spice in the mix. Very malty scent all around with caramel also in the mix. Taste starts of like sweet candy and caramel covered fruits. Notes of banana and a slight bitterness came through. This ended on a sweet and spicy note that lingered for a bit. The body was medium with a creamy feel and ample carbonation. Tasty brew here that I could definitely drink a few of. It goes down easy and shows no sign of the high abv."
"Overall: First, this is not Aventinus. Accept that, and you can appreciate this nice interpretation of a strong dark wheat beer."
"Perhaps a perfect winter brew for me?"
"The drinkability is fairly good; the alcoholic content is very well masked."
"Not very drinkable. Pretty sweet and in the end cloying. A bottle or two is better than the big glasses you get at the brewpub. The beer is quite warm and flat and FAT towards the end. My ~12oz bottle seems to be holding up much better."
"A multi-faceted brew, with many flavors vying for supremacy, yet remaining highly drinkable."
"Beer is good. Happy growler beering."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy orangish-red color with two fingers of head. There is decent lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty with some banana and clove, classic weizen yeast aromas. The taste is sweet and malty, with more of those weizen flavors coming through. Some roasted malt and chocolate present. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is awesome. I would have never guessed this to be an 8.7% brew. A nice weizenbock."
"This one pours a light brown color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus in it but nothing from the weizen part of it. No spicy yeast or banana or clove. The flavor has a lot of citrus and a decent malt, but seems very thin and metallic. Unimpressive."
"This beer pours an amber color with minimal head. Sweet caramel smell as well as spiciness. Malty sweet flavor at first followed by apple tartness. Interesting play between the different flavors. The smell and flavor both improve as the beer warms. Smooth mouthfeel. Well hidden 8.7% ABV. This is a tasty, complex beer. It would be great if there were more Weizenbocks available - every one Ive had was delicious."
"I think this is my first weizen bock. It pours a light brown color, maybe a dark tea color. The nose is odd. There seems to be hints of orange peel and some spicey yeast tones. There is a lot of metallic flavor in there. I don't like it a lot. The orange flavors are also in there. I don't know about this one. The feel is somewhat thin and drinkability is not all that good. I don't think that victory is doing a good job with this one."
"I had this on tap at Anam-Cara a few months ago and it was absolutely incredible. This is a great beer. If you see it during the Fall time, pick it up."
"Upon the pour, a small head that quickly fades and leaves no lacing. Color is brownish-orange and only barely see through. Very smooth with a slightly sweet taste...I'm still not very good at identifying the individual flavors. Finish is slightly unpleasant. Alcohol hidden well considering its nearly 9%. A fine weizenbock, and one that I looked forward to trying. I am very glad I picked it up. However, this doesnt have that little extra something that I find in Aventinus. Highly recommended and very good for the style."
"This one poured a cloudy brownish orange with a small tan head that fell rather quickly. The smell is very nice. Mostly citrus and banana though the banana was hard to pick up. The taste was sweet bread and rather fruity. Alcohol detected in the finish but it works nicely. I can taste banana flavors only in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good although more than rwo or three would be too many. I really enjoyed this beer for something different."
"Drinkability: Damn if this isn't nice. Victory shoots and scores. Well worth getting and savoring. I could see this going well with hearty soups, breads, and cheeses."
"Hmm pours out well looks good nice haze in glass.Has a sweet smell,but i dont smell the bananas{like others}.Sweet malty taste that i wasnt prepared for,but after a few sips started to grow on me.I can feel a little alcohol warmth and its very welcome. After the last sip i wanted more ,,but i think two in one session would be enough.Good beer but the style isnt my favorite."
"Had a second one the next night and all seemed about the same. One thing to note- it went perfectly with a roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, mayo sandwich! I don’t usually note food pairings, but this really seemed to fit. I may keep some on hand for just this very reason."
"had on tap at Anam Cara, in the moonglow wisen glass (very very cool). Cloudy brown body, with a slight hint of yellow. Small head. Smells of banana, a little citrus, and overall fresh and crisp. The flavor follows up with a little spice, medium banana, and a clean citrus finish. Slight alcohol flavor mixed in but nowhere near what you would expect from a 9%. god damn smooth and no aftertaste. Overall: one of the best things on earth."
"Nice autumn beer and I like the artwork. The pour did not display a prominant head, but the body was an inviting ruddy brown that was certainly opaque. Smell was fruity blackberry nose and a slight belgian dubbel notes. The taste was wheaty, but continued to have a decidedly belgian note. Tons of fruity flavors, slight bubble gum and a good strain of syrup. Mouthfeel was slim and not too heavily carbonated but had a good filling body. Tasty autumn beer that I will be sure to have more of."
"This is the sweet and sour sauce of beers - it has both elements, in addition to the spiciness from the yeast. Victory amazes me yet again, with the ability to have so many distinctly different flavors going on here, yet they meld together so well. A bitter hoppiness shines throughout as well. The alcohol is not terribly noticeable, but you'll feel a little warmer towards the end of the glass. Definitely one that could be sessioned, albeit dangerously. Another great beer and a wonderful seasonal from the boys in Downingtown."
"Pours with very little head that quickly dies to a thin, patchy cover of slick-looking, tiny grayish bubbles with zero cling. Carbonation is visible despite the murk of yeast particles suspended in this sienna or iced tea-colored liquid with foggy orange highlights. Aromas of gingerbread and dried banana chips with hints of dried apple, clove, and bubblegum are initially pleasant, with a big finish like vanilla extract. Prickly nosefeel full of acid and spice is a bit thin. And then, everything gets washed out by alcohol. This is just a hint of things to come: flavors bitter with clove, sweet like bubblegum being slathered on banana bread, hints of raisins, and alcohol. Aftertaste is a vise grip of nutmeg, clove, SenSens, and alcohol. Intense, tingling mouthfeel practically numbs the palate with carbonation or... could it be... ALCOHOL? Surely, intrinsic flavors are being masked here. At 8.7 abv this is a one-at-a-time type of beer befitting an autumn afternoon, but other than that, somewhat heavy-handed. Complex for sure, but what's the point when it's got a body like mouthwash?"
"This (hefe)weizenbock poured a cloudy, caramel brown color with off-white foam that persisted. The smell was fruity with a good aroma of caramel and malt. The taste was malty with wheat and banana and caramel. There was a touch of a vinous flavor and overall fruitiness, and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel was crisp with medium body and medium carbonation. The feel was a bit warming as well. This was a very nice weizenbock."
"Excelent and very drinkable. I wish I had more than the one or at least access to more."
"Drinkability: I drank this very quickly. It's a tasty brew. I could easily have another. A good fall brew overall."
"Prosit!"
"Nice hazy reddiah,amber color. Killer aroma of malt-sort of banana like esters. Slight alcohol bite. Big malty flavor-phenolic,clove like. Nice residual sweetness. Very full bodied-the phenolic and clove highlights are actually very smooth in the finish-not astringent like some weizens I have had. Extremely smooth. I do knock down its drinkability a tad but only because wheat beers arent my thing though this could start a whole new trend. Another great beer from Victory-man I need to get to Downington PA for a peek!!!!"
"It is a medium to ligh bodied beer with lots to offer for those who love lambics."
"As usual, I will point out that normally I do not like this style, I don't like wheat beers in general. On the other hand, it looked good, and since I had never had it, well, I was going to get one. This was on tap at Anam Cara this past weekend. I ordered up two, one for me and one for David. Other BAs had been sipping theirs out of nice Hefeweizen glasses, but our pours came in proper Aventinus glasses. Hmm, was this beer going to be worthy? Halfway worthy? Well, by golly it was, and even I thought so. In fact, if I didn't know it was from an American brewery, I would have thought it was German. Dark amber in color, wheat colored head was impressive (hey, it was in an Aventinus glass). I got yeast and alcohol off the aroma. Faint clove and banana. Taste was medium in body, well-rounded, full of flavor, but not so much I was gasping. Kind of hard to describe..everything was all nice and balanced, and luckily, I wasn't left thinking cloying, or bubblegummy, or... Solid malt. Smooth Wheat. Alcohol sitting in the background waving at me. Victory have themselves a beer here that deserves it's praise."
"Short lived cream colored head. Hazy tea colored beer with streams of tiny bubbles visible in the upper half. Round yeast aroma with a bit of alcohol and crisp hops. Flavor starts off with some sweet malt is and quickly joined by a bitter alcohol kick that holds on till the warming end. Body is on the light side for such a strong beer yet the flavor manages to stick to the tongue. A big beer that lets you know it and has you coming back for more."
"Beer was poured into a standard pint glass. Color was a luminescent amber-brown. Lots of rich haze in this brew! Smell was good, with an indistinct malt-note coming through the strongest. Almost smelled like candy... Taste was an explosion of harmonious flavors. Buttery bannana notes came through the strongest of the fruity tones, with a sweet backbite not unlike a low-impact carmel. Clearly a lager, but what a blend! Really good mouthfeel and drinkability, If I ever found myself at the Munich Octoberfest, I'd search out brews of this style (but would doubt they'd be this good). An outstanding weizenbock."
"The beer pours a dark orange color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet fruity wheat scent that is sweet and slightly malty. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth wheaty flavor that goes down easy and finishes thick and warm. It has excellent clove and banana flavors, but with a darker feel. It has a wonderful fruity aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine weizenbock. It has good flavor and aroma; an excellent drinker."
"cloudy deep burnt red color of aged pennies. significant caramel colored head recedes to a small collar. intensely fruity aroma of tart apples and ripe bananas with a medicnal phenolic undertow. sparsely carbonated yet still full and lively on the tounge. solid fermented wheat backbone with more banana and green apple flavor in the middle. muted bitterness, dryness comes more from the peppery phenolic character. goes down easy despite its size, just a hint of alcoholic fire in the finish. one of the best seasonals victory makes. world class."
"Draught @ Victory: This one is a rich, cloudy orangish-brown color. There was no head on my sample. The aroma was highlighted by notes of banana and clove, as well as some dark fruits and caramel. The taste was a rich malty sweet, but not overly so. Some Yeatiness, as well as hints of the banana,dark fruits and clove also. Another very good one! Even my mother and wife liked this one!"
"Cloudy brownish color with a nice head. Goes down to a lace and eventually fades away. The taste has a great malt base, typical of other German wheat beers. Tastes of cloves and bananas in the background. Very good drinkability even for the high alcohol content."
"Overall - Just a fantastic beer. Loved it. So full and rich, smooth and luscious. All cylinders are firing with this beauty."
"I usually like a bit of clove and banana in my weizenbocks. But this is so drinkable that I can forgive the lack. Smooth, sweet, and very flavorful. A delightful beer."
"It's such a treat to drink since there aren't many versions of this style out there. I'd be hapy to drink this whenever I get the chance, and I could easily put down one after the other with how good of a job Victory does in masking the astounding 8.7%abv."
"Poured a ""wheatish"" amber. The taste was bold, with hops, fruits and malt, all seemingly churned into this brew. The Alcohol was prevelant in the fist sip, but soon subsided with each passing sip.The first bottle went down FAST. The second bottle was a STRUGGLE. I was complexed? I suspect it was the inabilty to mask the high ABV."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a weizenbock. Alcohol is very subdued and good overall mixing of malts, spices, and hops."
"brew from a great brewery VICTORY!"
"Backwash: Ive waited quite a long time to review this beer, because I thought my original samples were spoiled. Oddly, the first place I found these was from Finger Lakes Beverage. Subsequent purchases from Bottle King proved no better however. Now I am pretty confident in writing that theres something inherent in this beer that I dont like. First, it doesnt really taste much like the other bocks Im familiar with. Its lighter in color and body, and more tart. There is a definite fruitiness, but its compromised by that sour backnote that ruins the experience for me. I will likely not buy this again, unless I see it on draught."
"Medium feel, too cloyingly sweet for me"
"D&N: Near perfection in a bottle. By far the best beer I've had in a long time. Highly recommended."
"12 oz bottle, enjoy by date of Aug 20 04. Pours light almond, cloudy, with almost purpleish hues. Minimal head, minimal lace left.Tiny bubble sheen thing going on. Nose of raisins and rum. mmm, yummy. Flavors of tart apples, plums ,raisins, almost vinious. Medium body, tartness prominant. also yeasty notes and flavorings. 8.7% noted and appreciated. Not an everyday beer, but well crafted and interesting. Anybody need a night cap?"
"Wow, another stunning Victory. A great interpretation of the style. Everything I was looking for."
"Thanks for the nice Wheat Bock Murph."
"This reddish brown beer has a healthy head compliments of the wheat. The aroma has some banana and fruity esters in the nose. The smooth body starts off fruity with suggestions of cherry and turns to slight clove and subtle banana. It is warming due to its high alcohol, but is not harsh. The maltiness is complex."
"Pours a very cloudy caramel color with a small light tan head -- active carbonation and quite a bit of sediment in the bottle. The aroma is very sweet and floral, with almost honeysuckle tones. It has a very nice, full mouthfeel that was far less ""bubbly"" than I expected from the appearance, but the taste didn't work for me. Not that it was bad -- in fact, it was almost a ""pretty"" taste that reminded me of spiced liquid flowers. But it was way too sweet for my palate. It was fairly easy drinking, I suppose - -and it might be interesting to try it on a hot summer day, but the sweetness would discourage me from more than one."
"Drinkability is pretty high. sort of reminded me of a poor man's Aventinus, which is a compliment in my book."
"Dark cloudy mahogany color with a thick off-white head and nice lacing. The smells are of very sweet malts, a yeasty hint and notes of bananas and citrus spices. The taste is a bit spicy with hints of bananas, spicy hops and citrus flavors. A very complex bock with everything blended well together. The spices really tickle my tastebuds and the alcohol is sublte but warming to the stomach. Delicious with a dry aftertaste of bananas and spices. Victory is always a treat."
"This beer pours a brown body with low apparent carbonation and a very quickly diminishing off-white head. Aroma is of banana, brown sugar and citric notes (grapefruity). Not too complex and no Aventinus. Taste has a light sourness from the wheat and more banana/brown sugar flavours. Body is thin-medium. I don't think this was infected, but still it had a sourness that seems out of order in this style. Luckily I've got another bottle and a re-rate is in order."
"I thought Moonglow was a fairly interesting brew with decent drinkability. This particular bottle wasn't bad but the flavors were probably muted somewhat by its advanced age. I'm intrigued enough to be on the lookout for some fresh Moonglow now."
"What a great name. Just rolls off the tongue. Yet another beer I enjoyed at my xmas tasting thanks to Dan. Pours a medium reddish-brown with light tan head. Not as dark as other weizenbocks I've had. Smells of winey grapes, bubble gum, slight burned bananas, and alcohol. Tastes much like the smell, with steady sweetness throughout. Wheat tang finish with residual sweetness. Good stab at this style, and better than my homebrew WB, but no Aventinus..."
"Down the drain it went. Sorry fellas."
"This was probably the most pleasant and interesting wheat beer I've had in a long time. Aside from being gorgeous, it had a unique flavor that I'll certainly remember."
"Sampled at weefishheads' Beer Night--Jan 17, 2004. The beer was a very hazy red-orange, with scattered patches of foam, rather than actual head forming in my smallish sample. The smell was somewhat yeasty and musty, with attractive granny smith apple and banana aromatics. The taste was lovely...a tart zip start joined by soft malts, with tartness and banana in the lingering finish. Extremely tasty and full flavored with refreshing crispness. The medium body and carbonation of the beer matched the set of flavors well. Moonglow was very enjoyable and satisfying. Big thanks to weefishheads for making this beer available for tasting!"
"Pours a not quite clear copper amber with a two finger beige head that fades into nice sheet lacing. The label is one of the more attractive ones I've seen, and was imprinted with an ""enjoy by Aug 20 04"" date. Nose is complex, bananas, oranges, pineapples, toffee, cloves, and hints of Belgian yeasts. Crisp and well carbonated in the mouth, yet creamy and medium bodied. Taste is of toffee and caramel soaked in a fruit basket. Ruby red grapefruit, bananas, oranges, and pineapples. Carbonation keeps it all vibrant all the way to the end. No presence of alcohol is noted, in spite of the listed 8.7abv. This is an extraordinary brew from the folks at Victory. Very well crafted and pleasantly complex. Highly enjoyable."
"Poured out a orange-reddish-brownish color, seemed a little bit cloudy as well. The smell consisted of various tropical fruits with some hints of spiciness. Taste was very weird. It was like a tug-of-war between the fruitness and the spiciness. The battle was still going on while I swallowed it. But the aftertaste was too much for me. There was just too much spiciness at the end and I could taste the alcohol at the end too. Had a hard time finishing this beer because of the aftertaste. I will try it again someday, perhaps my tastebuds had a night off or something."
"A very different beer all around. At first glance, taste doesn't match appearance, but upon further inspection it does. The color suggests sweet bock but the hazy yeastiness suggests fruit and spice, in the end all are present."
"A tree bark colored beer with a good off white head that lasted a long time. The nose was bread-like; yeasty, grainy and wheaty. There were some aromas of pear and overripe apples. the taste was real clean and the wheat flavors dominated. Same fruit flavors as I smelled were present in the beer. Good mouthfeel, well balanced carbonation and a nice balance to the flavors of wheat and mild hop background. The beer finished dry and after some time the residual hop flavors really came out. A long finishing beer that was quite enjoyable"
"I really did not know what to expect from this brew. I found a hazy copper pour with a think head. The aroma of banana quickly fills the room upon release with hints of smoke/roasted malt. A smooth body pairs with sharply fruity yeast flavors and a bit of sharp malt. A moderate bitterness flows throughout the brew and jumps in and out of the finish. Tasty and complex."
"A muddy reddish brown color with a quickly receding tan head. Wheaty aromas heavy on the bubble gum/banana with some smokiness. Alcohol also shows on the nose. A fullish body holds a fruity start (apples/oranges) with some bananas and spice. The finish is long and smooth with some chocolate,sweet malt and spicy yeast. The texture is really nice in this brew, a quality after dinner drink. Cheers to Bierman9."
"This beer poured a rich cherry wood color with a ruby red glow about it. It was very clear with a first pour and well carbonated. After the send and most generous pour I partook in the yeast on the bottom for the true effect and it became noticeable cloudy and a shade paler. The head that was produced was creamy, rich, and thick, about 2 inches of dense foam. It was light tan/vanilla cream colored and it lasted for some time before I could actually take my first sip. Then after it fell it a skim on the top and a healthy ring on the edges. There was a lace present that seemed to be in sheet form almost the whole way to the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly rich, aromas of dark fruit (plums), some bananas, rich sweet malts, spices and yeast all were present and quite distinctive. The tasted that rolled over my tongue were sweet, rich and at times tangy. Flavors of bananas, plums, some dark berries, a slight hop bite, tad wheat grain flavors in the middle along with big sweet malts, spices, near the swallow, a pine presence came and went, alcohol was present throughout the sip and finished with a yeasty malty flavor. The aftertaste was dominated with fruity, yeasty hops. Not lasting on the pallet but present. The body was more of a medium to medium heavy on the mouth. What can I say, this beer got better from the day I first got the case a few months back. I did notice that when allowed to warm a few degrees the flavors and aromas became more rich and noticeable. A really good beer and another hit for Victory."
"Bottle cellared from last Spring. Brown and hazy, yeasty appearance. Nice 1/2 inch head of glistening quality and good staying power. Lace is generous and complicated. Big ester nose on this one, with a background of anise and brown sugar. Nice medium and creamy mouthfeel, flavor starts with pleasant banana and pineapple (slightly lactic), just a touch of tartnesss, and transitions to a light fruit syrup impression that's touched by some herbal notes. No strident lemon notes. Sense of alcohol. Slightly granular in texture. Decent entry, a Weizenbock is one of the great uses for wheat in a beer for me."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a nice off-white head. Sweet malty, but still well balanced. There is a major fruity role played by the yeast. The high alcohol percentage also comes through, but only slightly. And the mouthfeel: oh so very very smoothskie. Certainly quite the drinkable beer. I'm going to hold onto a couple of these to ssee how it ages."
"Pour is a cloudy mahogany, medium sized tan head that mostly diminishes and leaves small bits of lace. Aroma is strong on the banana, some grain (think banana bread), and some sugary sweetness. Flavor is sweet, fruity (banana, apple, pear), and ends with some spiciness. Fairly full bodied, slightly acidic."
"But hey, let's tell it like it is: This shit rocks."
"Flavor is toffee and cinnamon and allspice with a growing metallic twang. Finish is of rich brown sugar and malt with a growing drying tannic touch to the final twist."
"Mmm...weizenbock is a good style, and one that's sadly under-represented. A great seasonal, and one I'll hopefully have again."
"Thanks to the 36LbLoveChild for this!"
"Super nice concentrated color, looks like a solid glass of dark caramel, some yellowness peaks around the edges, a thin loose tannish head emerged that didn't last and the lacing is very minimal. Aroma is super tangy of fruity citrus, ripe melon, orange peels, mango, peach, dulled grapes, quite a fruit juice effect in the aroma, underlaying sweet malts and musty yeast, notes of ethanol. Taste is a lip smacking attack of tangy dullish citrusy fruits, mostly orange peels and peach skins with some mango and light banana mixed in. Pretty sweet and quickly tangy, malty, twingy with notes of raw orange peels coming through late in the finish as it drys out somewhat and keeping a sweetly souring, almost puckering tang. Feel is a bit thin at first but begins to fill in as it goes and drys out some in the finish. Sneaky alcohol hits your head after half the glass. A pretty decent brew, the tangyness is pretty high with a overall orange peel effect throughout its character. I can see where some would like this, but I don't think I'd try this again, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered either. I'm kinda torn with this one, I want to like it cuz Victory makes some fantastic brews, but something with this beer keeps me from thoroughly enjoying it. Thanks goes out to PisskyNights for the bottles!"
"This is definitely a very nice beer from Victory and if you like wheat beers give it a try. There is a lot going on in this beer and you might pick up on something I have missed!"
"This brew pours a murky reddish amber with very little cascading and a thin dark blonde head. The aroma is tart and gingery with evidence of banana esters, and the taste is sweeter than I expected after the initial sudden burst of tanginess. There's a lot of carbonation in this weizen bock so I feel it all the way down the my throat. The aftertaste is rather sticky."
"This is a good one from Victory. The color is nice- a dark red- orange, and the aroma is nice and spicy, sweetish but not really sweet. Then the taste, well that's quite nice as well, it makes me smile. I seem to either smile or make a horrid face with beer- I'm not a professional... Yes, Moonglow tastes spicy, almost a sour fruitiness to it too. It's very drinkable, it feels soft in my mouth, and I tend to forget about the alcohol content in this stuff. So they definitely did a good job with this seasonal."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle. The weizenbock pours smoothly into the glass with minimal head consisting of tight bubbles that fade quickly. Appearance is a nice auburn, just a tad hazy. Smells like a hefe on steroids, very wheaty and malty, but with strong scents of banana and spice competing for attention. Body is quite full and taste is initially sweet and very wheaty/malty, then followed by a big fruit presence reminiscent of apples and of course bananas. Finish is rather tart but leaves a lingering sweetness on the tongue. Another great effor form the folks at Victory."
"Notes: This is my last out of a sixer, and I will not purchase again. Try it if you like the style, but don't judge Victory based on this offereing, Make sure and try the Storm King and Hopdevil first."
"A voluminous tan head tops this dark caramel colored beer. This loose layer of foam slowly fades to a moderate layer that persists for as long as there's beer in the glass. Banana and cloves wrapped in alcohol sweetness with a bread chaser greets the nose. The taste is surprisingly tart, similar to a berliner-weisse, but it has a thick, roasted background. Tartness fades to a smooth, refreshing sweetness mid-palate. The finish is somewhat clean, with a lingering roasted note and a touch of bitterness. There's a lot going on in this beer, and it seems like the beginning is at odds with the end, and all the flavors in between do is antagonize the whole situation. This is an enjoyable beer, but perhaps there's such a thing as too much complexity? That being said, I'd buy it again. I love wheat beers, and a weizenbock just goes good with fall weather."
"F"
"The flavor is where this beer doesn't shine. It has banana and strong clove flavors, but it leaves a harsh burnt flavor in the aftertaste. The body and mouthfeel are very well done, but that aftertaste is not what I would expect in a Weizenbock."
"Drinkability: Wow! I am glad I only bought one bottle. A solid representation of the style, but not the style for me."
"Basically a really nice weis bock from a great brewery."
"I found myself looking at cases of this at my local distributor, but somehow I had to hold off until I could be sure that I wanted a full 24 bottles of a somewhat obscure brew (durn ya, PA ! ) However, $28 later I can say that it was worth every cent. The Moonglow is the ultimate chill evening beer, as it is guaranteed to warm you with its 8.7%. It pours a deep reddish brown with a whispy yellow-tan head. The smells are of banana, clove, and vivacious fruit. The taste is very strong, beginning with a fruity blast of again, banana, along with other organic aromatics. The finish is tart, and leaves a slick feel on one's pallete. Not surprisingly, the aftertaste is very reminiscent of another big abv Victory beer, golden monkey. The thick fermented wheat taste is what lends the slight sour finish. I can't get enough. The complexity of this brew is what really stands out for me though. I enjoy beers that challenge a pallete, and just because it doesn't taste like my Hop Devil doesn't mean I'm apt to write it off as being 'less than what I expect from Victory'. I love this beer. It has everything you could ever want. Let it warm to 60 F, sip it slowly, and let the flavors interplay. Take your time and enjoy this one, then hide a few to age and pull them out when you need a treat on a cold day."
"Of the seasonal brews I've had this year, Moonglow is certainly one of the best, but it is also the most expensive, hands-down. I bought it thinking that, being a Victory, it had the potential to rock my world. In the end however, I wish I would have sought out a store that sold it by the single, instead of $11 for a sixer. Funny how I can say this is both one of the best beers I've had recently and one of the most overpriced I've had ever. When you think about it, buying good beer can be really funny sometimes."
"First off, did anyone else see the little ghosts on the bottle, or was it just me? Anyways, I must say, this is one beer with mixed reviews from me. The appearance was stellar. It was a murky amber color with a beautiful head. The head was super thick and very frothy, which lasted quite a while. The smell was a mixture of many things. It was very strong in the area of fruits, like citrus, plums, and grapes. It was also had a subtle pumpkin pie smell to it. This also came out in the taste, which had both clashing together. I thought it was waaay to sweet and was more like fruit salad, than beer. I am definately going to stay clear of this one. I usually am a huge fan of what Victory puts out, but this one was stretchin' it for me."
"I can't really say that this is a bad beer, but at the same time I can't say that I enjoyed it at all. Although the brewing expertise of the boys at Victory shows, I have to say that this was one of their worse ideas. Moonglow is a very well crafted beer. The mouthfeel is great and it looks fantastic, but I just think that the flavor is awful. It's not that the Victory boys didn't achieve what they set out to accomplish, it's just that they probably shouldn't have done it in the first place. I think that this stuff tastes horrible, and I'm certainly not planning on buying it again, but I think that this is a result of personal tastes, not the quality of the beer. I guess it's worth trying once, but don't say I didn't warn you if it doesn't agree with your tastes."
"A friend calls this beer ""Grandma's banana nut bread in a bottle""."
"Fianally found this one, been on the look-out for awhile now. Will stock up for the winter. Dark hazy reddish brown with plenty of cloud cover from the swirling yeast. Head is tan, more effervescent that expected and different from other weizens, fades quicker as well. Smell is strong tropical fruits and yeast esters. Taste is buttery smooth and rich with alcohol soaked bananas, apples and pears. Pretty sweet and definite alcohol presence. Thankfully though it doesn't fail to show me the yeasty esters toward the end. This guy's more carbonated that the few other weizenbocks around. Weizenbocks are a fantastic style and this is a great American example."
"The beer pours a brooding and bemused amber color with the head impressive in size, the color an off white with a sticky sheet of lace that clings mightily to the glass. The nose lemon-lime like as in citrus crisp, bubble gun and bananas, what a Hoot. Sweet and sour start, the top middling in feel and the finish mildly acidic, hops are forceful in their bite, quite dry aftertaste. One of my favorites from Victory, and thanks to several BAs, Ive managed to store a few and they seem to age quite well, but actually never last more than 6 months."
"641"
"This beer poured to a deep bronze color with very little head. The aroma was an interesting combo of sweetness, fruits, and some yeast. This had a big malty flavor, with fruitiness and bitterness blending well together. The malt is thick on the tongue, and then a sour sensation kicks in. Thicker bodied and little carbonation caused the head to disappear quickly. One of these is enough in a sitting, but very tasty. The high alcohol level is fairly noticeable too."
"Pours a thick plum color with a great sticky, retentious head. The color of this beer is wonderful to look at. Aroma intrigues me with big green apple, yeast, phenolics, and raisin. What I found at first to be overpowering green apple did not bother me for long. This beer is strong and proud, and all of its bold flavors meld together wonderfully. The dark caramel malts back up the yeast flavors and leave a little bit of sweetness that the german hops cannot fight. Possibly a little thicker and a little less carbonated than I would like. This beer is a very solid, very complex brew."
" Beautiful copper color. Rich bananna, yeast, and pumpkin pie spice aroma. Taste is not unlike a Belgian dark strong ale, but this has a lot more body and is much richer. An explosive symphony of flavor. Describing the taste too much just won't do it justice. Alcohol is not noticeable in the flavor, but you can tell that this is a sipper. If you have actually taken a minute or two out of your life to read this, do yourself a favor and get this. Actually, drive to the brewery and get this on draft. Yeah, you may live in Nebraska, but you're a beer geek. You don't have anything better to do."
"Whoa....To the Victor(y) belongs the spoils. I just may move to PA if they keep this up. This should be a kick ass beer at 8.7, but it is soooo smooth, I couldn't tell....Banana, citrus, tingly tongue were definitely there. The color was that of fresh pressed cider witha nice head. Mouthfeel was round and smooth with a hint of malt to impress in the drinkability category. This was the last single bottle on the shelf of my favorite packy....too bad...gotta remind them to order more!!!!"
"I was up int the air about this wiezenbock. I love Aventinis and this was very different. I ad many good tastes like Banana and sweet plum, and was a litle spicy. BUT I really was not fond of the sour side to this beer, some have described it as sour apple and tart. I agree with both and couldn't find a place for that much tart in this beer. It reminded me of a sour ale I drank at Monk's in Philly, that was sour but was supposed to be."
"This beer pours a rich, thick, cloudy burgundy with a fairly thick tan head. A pungent wheaty aroma permeates the atomosphere around the glass. Alcohol and malt also donates to this permeation and it's wonderful. It's rich, malty, wheaty at first drink. Alcohol and a slightly sour taste make for an interesting finish and aftertaste. The crisp carbonation and smooth wheat character make for a very drinkable brew considering it's 8.7% ABV. This high ABV is warming in the mouth and stomach, making this a brew I would crave if I had a house with a fireplace to sit next to with an amazing beer to enjoy."
"The color of this beer is simply amazing. When I poured it into my Aventinus glass, it was glowing like the setting sun. Had to pour roughly to get that hefe head going and then it settled rapidly without even leaving a thin film on top. Aroma is that typical of a Dunkle Weizen with wheatish, apple like aromas. What surprised me is the sourness of this beer. It reminded me of drinking a sour belgian brown ale. There were some cherry flavors mixing with apple, plum, and slight chocolate notes. Could have used a little more sweet chocolate flavors to balance out the sourness. Mouthfeel was smooth and slippery. An interesting beer that I couldn't get my mind around, but not the best example of a Weizenbock."
"Comments  Leave it to Victory to produce this quandary. This was too light for a dunkel weizen and too fruity for a bock. It was even probably off style for a weizen bock. But man, oh man, was this a pleasure to drink. Can we add some flexibility to the style and say that this was f***ing awesome?"
" This is a nice brew to mix it up a bit. I like how there are some nice dark notes to the brew. It has all the good qualities of a weiss, and some added complexity from some roasty flavors. Very good to drink, and who would have thought the alcohol was that high. It went unnoticed by me, well maybe a little."
"Cloudy reddish-brown color with a small off-white head that quickly disappears, no lacing. Fruity and spicy aromas of bananas, cloves and vanilla. Wheat flavor with sour apples, vanilla and bubblegum. Full bodied with a full and thick mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, finishes sweet and sour. Alcohol very well hidden, very nice."
"Drinkability: I could easily, and quite dangerously, have more than one of these beers in a single session."
"Notes: There are few Weizen Bocks around, none the less Victory is right on target with this one. Why I bought a single to sample  I am going back for a case."
"Dark orange gold color. Small head. Aroma is spicy. A full-bodied Weizenbock. Fruity and spicy. Very nice flavors, bananas and cloves, orange and spice, citrus and malts. Well balanced, not only between malts and hops, but between tart and sweet. Very nice beer. No noticeable alcohol despite a 8.7% abv. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly tart."
"It pours a muddy, old leather color with a tannish beige head that faded rather quickly. A huge blast of clovey aroma hits you immediately, a distant smell of an extinguished fire appears later, although perhaps it was there all along and I didn't notice it. A fresh wheat bread and earthy flavor mingle with a faint oakiness and sweet and sour balsamic vinegar tartness. The clove-like spiciness does appear in the taste, but not as strong as in the aroma. A touch of toffee and a hint of lemon drops and warming alcohol finishes this somewhat overly complex brew."
"Finishes up dancing the line between dry and sweet...another hit from the boys at Victory."
"Sweet wheaty clean malt tropical fruit smell... Light tan lingering head. Ice tea color and clarity. Initial thickish sweet wheat taste is then balenced by a sharpish dryish plum skin, pineapple, and bananna finish. Smooth and full up front in the mouth and then it turns crisper and more carbonated as the brew slides down across the tongue. Wow what a feel. A special seasonal from Bill and Ron.. The ABV is a creeper on this one as well. It is only detectable by a slight warm fuzzy feeling in the gut. The perfect beer to be calming me during Isabel.... description in one word....comforting..."
"An excellent beer! Very fruity taste that leaves you asking for more. More of a subtleness than other wheat bocks. The alcohol creeps on you because you can barely taste it throught the fruitiness. All in all an excellent seasonal brew. If you enjoyed this, try out Aventinus Wheat Dopplebock. It is better in my opinion but very similar."
"Hazy dark amber in color with a thin white head. Aroma is very fruity with lots of cloves. The taste is very very powerful. Strong plum taste as well as some clove and bananna. The 8.7% is obvious, but it very enjoyable and warming. Personally, I think the best Victories are the seasonals. All the more reason to stop by often."
"On draft at the Grey Lodge. Wow, this one is a slap in the face. There are some very strong flavors in this beer. If your standard Hefe is David Banner, then this beer is the Hulk. Poured a cloudy burgundy brown color with a small white head. Intense aroma of bubblegum, sweet candy and alcohol emanate. Spicy, complex, malty sweet, sour and yeasty all at once. Very strong in flavor and I would say that this beer is for serious beer lovers only. I gave this an average score for drinkability because although I enjoy the taste of this beer, it would not be my first choice to pair with food, or even to crack one open for the game. This beer is a special treat to be enjoyed once and awhile."
"Words to the Wise: Let it warm up toward room temperature, put it in a flute-like glass as if it was a hefe-weizen as well as pour in the yeast. Cheers to V-Town for making a very rare style and doing it well."
"Appearance: So here I am listening to the sounds of Neil Young's ""Harvest Moon"" imbibing upon one of the most appealing to the eye weizen bocks in existence, well the Moonglow of the deep amber mahogany body with a ruby brown tinted massive head leaving complete webs of lacing around my glass just reminds me of that glowing amber moon that sometimes mysteriously appears in the sky. Aroma: Where do I start, banana sauteed in a light pear liqueur and the presence of the wheat malt along with the magnificent tones of the yest born bliss. The alcohol nose isn't overbearing but blended across a spectrum of fruity yet musty tones of paradise, this beer has to be one of the most enticing aromatic creations ever to come across my path. Taste: Even as it warms the sharp wheat based malt sweetness mixed perfectly with the alcoholic tone fruits such as pear, banana, and mild apple tones over a brown sugar base arise and soar over the palate oh ""come a little bit closer hear what I have to say", ""just like children sleeping we could dream this night away", ""but there's a full moon rising, let's go dancing in the light"". Wow, this is an experience whoever samples this beer must pop in some Neil Young it's awesome together. Mouthfeel: Slight sense of chiunkiness to it medium to full bodied luscious wheat ale, a must try for all German style beer lovers, props go out to Bill and Ron on this one muchas gracias guys for creating not just a sessionn of exotic ale sipping, but one that will be emblazoned in my memory as one of the most skillfully constructed good times I have shared with true art. Drinkability: Well, I don't even know what the ABV of this beer is but I can tell you that after one I am feeling on another level of relaxation and at peace with the world. We all need that push to get us through the day, and to picture an evening with my own family someday and a night cap in the form of a Moonglow each day will be more blissful than the next."
"I sampled the 2003 version on tap at Victory on 8/19/03. This year's version is totally different than last year and probably the best batch of Moonglow ever. This unfiltered, wheat beer pours a beautiful, brown earthy pastel with a robust off-white head. If your a fruit lover, the aroma will remind you of a bouquet of freshly picked apples with a hint of cinnamon. The flavor is dominated by a very delicious malty, spicey sweetness. The aroma translate to a taste of a refreshing fruit appetizer of apples, peaches, dates and rasions. A very tasty brew, but also a very deceptive brew. The finish displays a token amount of hops lurking in the background with this tinge of alcohol that lets you know that this can be a dangerous brew."
"Originally sampled from bottle on 4 November 2002. This beer was a pleasant surprise. Victory is very hard to get in my area, so when I noticed this seasonal I picked up a couple of bottles. What a nice flavor. Beautiful slightly cloudy amber color, w/ a hint of sweetness on the palate. Excellent beer!"
"Pours to a deep copper color with a tan head. The aroma is sweet, fruity, and yeasty. The flavor is malty, sweet and fruity. It is a medium-full bodied brew with a sweet finish. It is a warming, spicy beer. It was not at all what I expected, but good none the less."
"Pours a brownish-cherry color with a thin tan head. Highly carbonated and hazy with slight suspended sediment. The aroma is a mix of citusy and grassy wheat smells, with a hint of yeastiness. This brew has an underlying sweetness that is presented at the first sip, and a full-force tartness (bordering on sour) that sticks through the aftertaste. It's really a refreshing, but slightly heavy beer. Not really what I expected, but it's very good."
"I am going to admitt this off the bat - it had gone spoiled. However, I am not letting that affect my ratings in the sense you might think. I think the tartness that was produced by ""aging"" ,if you will, had an interesting effect. The color was a cloudy, ruddy, orange. a good amount of head also seems to comes w/ each bottle. It was almost like mixing a sweet-tart and wheat beer, and I did enjoy the results.The thing is, in alot of way, it was like a cider, but a sour apple cider, quite interesting.Also by this time you could taste a hint of the ABV. I do wish to sample this fresh, but you know what, spoiled is an interesting and enjoyable alternative"
"Cloudy, darkish amber in color, with a thin, even head and a tart, fruity aroma. The flavor is sour in a tropical-fruit sort of way, with some definite spicy notes. Medium-full boided and a bit sweet, with a gently dry finish. I wasn't overly impressed, but got the impression this would be a nice beer on an Autumn evening. I was shocked to see the ABV on this beer is 8.9%. It doesn't show at all."
"It pours a really pretty golden-red with a thin white head the almost completely disappears. The smell is most definitely clove, but other spices are noticeable. In addition to clove, slightly fruity flavors are present. Citrus flavors become more pronounced working through the beer. It also seemed to become a bit too sweet and almost cloying as it warmed. It has a nice body and doesn't go down like a beer with an 8.7% abv. It's not the best beer Victory makes, but it's better than most beers."
"The deep amber color , the soft head , the taste of banana , citrus, berry, and hints of spice gave this a good fresh taste to cover its high ABV. This one for me is one of my favs list, the full flavor that it provdes while mysteriously masking the ABV is very clever. A good desert for me."
"Poured out a rather nice red-gold colour with a good amount of murkiness. Moonglow is an apt name, as this almost did glow... Head wasn't huge, and settled back to a very thin layer for the rest of the glass. My problem here - floaties. Big chunks of yeast floating around in my glass. Maybe it could've been poured with more care, but there shouldn't have been that much and such big flakes. I took them a while to settle, as well. The taste was excellent. A very belgian style of a german beer. Lots of fruit - banana from the yeast, orange and lemon. Plenty of spice as well. Quite the beer. Would've gotten a five on the appearance if not for the floaties."
"I shall return another day, Victory Weizenbock, when maybe I do!"
"Nice beer and very drinkable, tasted like a cross between a Belgian dubbel and a German Weizen."
"Murky red-orange body, topped by a rapidly decaying off-white bubbly head. It's alive - lot of traffic in the glass as bubbles rise to top and yeast gently floats to bottom. Nose is dominated by apples, with bananas and clove in support. The apples and bananas are joined by more spices, and a wall of malt in the taste. Very full mouthfeel, smooth, but there is a hint of alcohol buried in the sensation. An autumnal warmer, a late night sipper, a bridge to the imperials, strong ales, and barleywines of winter."
"Perhaps the first Victory I wasn't totally blown away with (hey, nobody's perfect). I may also have been thinking Aventinus when drinking this, which isn't necessarily fair. Anyway, the beer has a nice copper color, slightly hazy, with a small tan head. Dark flecks floating around in the glass. Aroma is fruity and sweet, banana and spice, typical weiss aromas. Taste is also fruity and sweet, rich caramel, banana, spices (mostly clove, perhaps some nutmeg). Oddly, the taste is at once creamy and thin. Again maybe the Aventinus influence, but I wanted a bit of a richer, fuller flavor. Still, this is a nice beer, just not necessarily one that sets itself apart."
"Cloudy. Deep orange with a brownish cast, topped by a frothy deep tan head that drops but holds well. The aroma is fruity, lightly tangy, and sweet with some banana, vanilla and spice (which includes clove, but is not necessarily limited to it). The body is medium with a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation. The flavor is quite rich, starting with a very creamy and lightly caramel maltiness, turning fruity, yeasty and lightly tangy with apple notes, then revealing some banana and vanilla before it finishes with a lingering spiciness. The alcohol is fairly well hidden within the flavor, but it's strong enough that you feel it before the glass is through. 8.7%... whew! Surprisingly complex. An interesting and enjoyable beer. Well brewed.  This is a fall seasonal packaged with Halloween in mind, and I can't think of a better, or more appropriate time to enjoy this. The perfect ""warming"" beer for sitting on the back porch on a crisp evening with the smell of damp leaves and wood smoke wafting through the air."
"Pours a foamy tan head of about an inch that settles quickly to almost nothing..a cloudy/murky gold in color...the nose has a sour apple nose and a faint wheat aroma...the taste is thirstquenching but it is a very sour apple flavor with little else emerging...It has an OK malt backbone, but I expected more of a spiciness and bananna flavor as well....very good but well below Aventius in my opinion...."
"Brown with a good amount of white head and a bit of haze.  Very nice aroma.  Light - medium bitterness.  Nice malt, almost nutty, character with sweet undertones.  Finishes with nice bitterness.  Really smooth and nicely drinkable.  Victory, again, does not fail to impress."
"Pours a hazy light amber with a nice creamy head.  The smell is wheat with a lot of yeast and some fruity undertones in there.  Taste starts off with a nice wheat flavor that slowly turns to yeast then banana and finally into a slightly tart apple flavor.  The tongue is left with a yeasty taste that leaves you wanting more.  Very creamy and smooth and extremely drinkable.  Damn this is one fine brew, but what else do I expect from my favorite East Coast brewery."
