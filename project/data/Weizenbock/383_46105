Flavor is classic weizenbock: banana nut bread, slight booze, yeasty esters and phenols. Clove is the strongest player here. Sweet finish. Mouthfeel is full and a bit sticky with some stinging carbonation. Awesome example of a weizenbock. Hard to believe this was made in the US.","goochpunch","Mar 16, 2014"

The aroma was pure bubblegum banana bliss that hit all the perfect hefeweizen notes along with the spicy yeast and slight bits of sweet pear underneath. The taste was sublime and the mouthfeel was rich and creamy and all that I want in a weizenbock. The bubblegum and banana flavors dominated along with the yeast and strong hefeweizen spice notes that were expertly balanced. The Primus has to be on of the best Weizenbocks I have had and second only to Aventinus (although it is a Weizen Doppelbock) and my favorite Live Oak beer. This rich, creamy, satisfying brew was a real treat and something to look forward to every year.","brurevu","Feb 07, 2014"

Nothing too complicated or fancy, just a very well executed weizenbock that has no flaws. One of the best beers of this style I have tried.","Mora2000","Feb 15, 2010"
4.2,-1.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - I enjoyed this beer a lot it has a very good taste making it so I could drink more of these than I should worth getting to try if you see it on tap","armock","Feb 01, 2010"
3.64,-14.8,3,4,4,3,3,"D - The one glass is surprisingly filling. The flavor is strong. Even though it is a pleasant flavor, one glass is enough for me. It hides the alcohol well.","jwillcourt","Jan 20, 2010"
4.6,7.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Had this on tap the other night at the Flying Saucer in Ft Worth. It was a real dark beer, dark brownish in color. I really enjoyed the smells it gave off especially for a dark beer, very fruity smell that was mostly banana. It tasted great too, it was very hoppy that was mixed with fruits and wasn't filling like a dark beer normally is. I thought it was an exceptional beer that was very drinkable. I even had a second. My girlfriend also loved this beer and she isn't a fan of beer at all!","fjordhook","Jan 13, 2010"
3.9,-8.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Several of these scores could have went up actually. Nice ruby purplish color to the body with a very creamy beige head. Lots of bananas, clove and wheat grain in the nose. The flavors come together nicely in this one, score could have been higher but the yeast bite was a little sharp. Great wheat bock, nice and fruity and dark with banana, clove, coriander, cherry juice and candies plums. Mouthfeel is superb as I am finding a pattern here with Live Oaks offerings. Very creamy without being frothy, satisfying, well carbonated but with little bubbles. Very drinkable and refreshing for such a dark beer.","natelocc787","Dec 18, 2009"
4.29,0.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,"Note: After having the beer a second time I decided that the look isn't that bad. I just wasn't used to it all, having been unfamiliar with the style. It originally looked like a dirty hefe to me, which was unappealing.","psujmatt","Dec 15, 2009"
3.92,-8.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Lots of chocolate in the flavor with a prevalent wheat tang. Bananas and cloves are still there, but might be a little less prevalent than some of the German versions. It's also a tad thinner and not as creamy as some of the best weizenbocks. Maybe it is not quite fair to expect such greatness from Live Oak as their hefeweizen, but this one is not quite up to that standard. I like it enough and I would definitely buy it again, especially considering the lack of good draft weizenbocks around. Is this the first regularly produced Texas WB? If so, it's a good start.","twiggamortis420","Nov 10, 2009"

3.38,-20.8,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Deep dark brown, minimal head, but its a clinger, nice lacing all the way down the pint glass. Roasty wheat and peppery smoke throughout the nose and very strong in the mouth. To me, its not the most pleasant taste, but I do think it fits the Weizenbock style. Goes down relatively smooth, and hides the 8% pretty well. I didn't try to drink more than one as I didn't particularly dig it. But, it is what it is, and I would encourage you to try it if you find yourself in Texas, especially if you are a Weizenbock fan. This doesn't taste all that far off Aventinus.","joshuadlight","Mar 19, 2009"
4.07,-4.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,"D: I really only wanted one of the 22oz of these, even though the taste was off the charts (good) for me. I would definitely drink it again and hope I get the opportunity to do so. It was somewhat heavy which is what prevented me from drinking multiples of this.","thirdeye11","Feb 25, 2009"
4.4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I had this on tap at the Gingerman in Houston. The beer was dark brown and hazy, with a thick off-white foam that lasted forever. There was a strong aroma of bananas & cloves, rich and delicious, honestly this smelled like Aventinus. Same with the taste, the essence of Aventinus, right down to the slightly bitter aftertaste and hint of lactose. Live Oak seems on a mission to replicate the best German beers, I've been very pleased with the several I've tried (hefeweizen, Primus, Oaktoberfest).","TurdFurgison","Feb 25, 2009"
4.2,-1.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The flavor is just as complex as the aroma, starting with sweeter notes of dark bread and banana-nut muffins. Finishes strong, with a smooth, boozy warmth that balances nicely alongside earthen notes of wood and peat. Near-perfect body to this brew, with its creamy, medium-thick consistency and gentle carbonation level. With their phenomenal Hefeweizen, impressive Pilsner, and a newly added Weizenbock to their repertoire, LiveOak seems intent on recreating the German beer experience here in Texas. And for that, I couldn't be happier.","wagenvolks","Feb 18, 2009"

4.11,-3.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Solid. Poured beautifully murky, with lasting lacing throughout. Wheaty aromas. Fruit. Bananas. Delicious banana and clove flavor. Luscious mouthfeel, smooth. I am pretty close to saying this is live oaks best beer. Almost. We will keep the hefeweizen there. Excellent. Highly recommended","AChamberlain","Jan 15, 2009"
3.16,-26,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a dark red brown color body. Smallish head, creamy and tan. Very strong ripe aroma, some spiciness. Almost all bananas. Creamy softly carbonated palate. A nice fruit cocktail and banana taste.. Strong banana taste, like in the nose.","jujubeast6000","Jan 14, 2009"
