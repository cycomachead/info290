"O: An interesting concept trying to make a hefe/DIPA blend, but it's not as balanced as it could/should be. Some of the yeasty aspects clash with the higher abv and hoppiness, making it a little rough around the edges. I applaud PO for the attempt, because beers like this are NOT easy to pull off"
"Still goes down pretty easy and an unusual combo of styles and flavors.  I get to finish the other half of the bottle tonight."

"Not a bad beer at all, but I rather enjoy a DIPA and a hefeweizen on their own."

"Poured a nice golden color with a one finger foamy white head. Leaves a nice solid lacing down the glass. After being in the fridge for two years, much of the hop profile is gone though there is a strong bitterness left in the finish. Some cloves and bananas up front. It has a strong bready base with a spicy middle. Strong carbonation. I bet this would be really nice with the full hop profile when it was fresh. I'm digging a nice bitter wheat beer on a hot day."

"Recommended, but be warned- this is one aggressive, assertive brew. Anything that is 8.6% abv, yet actually taste higher, should be consumed in moderation."

"O: This beer can be intense but is something interesting to try if you like weizenbocks and IPAs."

"Taste is clashing, I dont find the banana/clove flavors to mesh well with the firm bitterness/hop flavors. Tastes more hoppy than anything and the yeast esters just muddle and confuse my palate. No bueno para mi."

"O) This is a good beer, although only 8.6%ABV seems a bit more potent. I would definitely drink another one of these."
"As I near the bottom of the bottle, I give it a good swirl to stir up some of the yeast. I'm expecting the yeast to be a little more appealing to my sweet, hefe loving palate. Well, it unfortunately doesn't make the Weiss Principal any better for me. Sorry! Overall, a pretty cool beer. It's the first hefeweizen I've ever handed to my hop-head friend that he liked. Actually, he loved it, and hasn't stopped raving about it throughout the entire bottle. Although it's not my favorite brew, I can sincerely appreciate the creativity of the Weiss Principle Ale. It really is the ""international love child of a Hefe-Weisse and an American IPA"" as the label states."
"This beer was terrific. Wild, but terrific. The description is apt. Its a german hefe meets an IPA. In the nose, a crazy combination of citrusy hops battle with the clove-type smells of hefe yeast. Its a wild combo. The beer is TOTALLY unfiltered, so the mouthfeel is extremely rich, creamy and satisfying. The hops and are very prominent on the front, then the yeast flavors (banana, etc.) come out strong at the end. Its a roller coaster. My only complaint is the richness of the mouthfeel i think does interfere a bit with the other flavors. But otherwise, a really fun beer."
"Decent beer but a bit misguided. The different aspects clash to much for my liking, interesting if nothing else."
"Dang, this is good beer! Maybe not the Weizenbock style it says here, but its label is spot on: ""An Imperial German-Style Hefe-Weisse"". At a very good temperature it poured with a grand off-white, thick, foamy, frothy, billowy head that lasts a long time and some lace. Color is a hazy, apricot amber with particulates and a few tiny bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, banana, clove, orange, malt, hop. Flavor is similar to nose with some pine and grapefruit along with carbonic tang. Body is a little soft and yet just right for this hybrid. Finish is like flavor and of average length, ending with a little sweetness at very last. Excellent beer!"
"$5 a bomber"
"O - i was quite impressed with parts of this beer and overall i still think its a good beer and worthy a try. if they could tone down the feel of the alcohol and improve the aroma i think this would be one brilliant beer."
"Lacking the pronounced wheat flavor or [masking] spices I usually find objectionable, I enjoyed this more than the usual weissbier."
"Different hops or less hops may have saved this beer. I wonder if German brewers who attempted this kind of schtick centuries ago were punished. IMO many high gravity wheat beers are a joke, a corruption, and a waste of good ingredients. This is one of them. At first I could taste a solid Hefe in there and then it was choked to death by hops, sugar, and booze."
" A wild and interesting brew, open your mind with this one!"
"It's good. I'd drink it again, but it pales in comparison to good Hefes and good IPAs. the sum of the parts are probably better than the whole."
"Taste has a good carbonation level, the aftertaste is an odd bitterness, the kind you would get if you ate the rind of an orange, light citrus presence that might have been a product of the hops but the hops are no longer a large aspect of this beer."
"P.S. a lot of sediment at the bottom."
"Overall: I tried this ACBF back in June and finally have decided to enjoy it at home. I enjoyed it then and still enjoyed it now. Big debate to get in on draft or bottle. Who cares? I'll take both."
"Interesting brew, and an ambitious rethinking of the wheat ale style. I have to say that Peak has certainly done the job well, adding enough extra zest to make for an intriguing sipper."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice mix of hefe yeast esters and bitter hop aroma. It's sweet and fruity with some subtle banana/clove character. The taste is decent. It has a good hefe flavor; pale and wheat malts, fruity yeast esters. The hop character adds a good deal of bitterness, which seems to muttle the flavor, but it's still quite tasty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting beer. It's half hefe, half IPA. I didn't think the two would work together, but it kinda does."
"This is a unique beer, not a session beer, that is tasty and enjoyable for those seeking a different beer or hybrid style. I enjoyed this beer throughout it’s identity crisis, but it lacked something to make me love it. I’ll try it again when possible to see how the next batch tastes."
"Served in a pint glass. Hazy and lightly golden. Big frothy head about two fingers high. Peppery yeast dominates the nose but there is also banana and wheat. Flavor has a more controlled yeast spice with more of the wheat and banana coming through. Some pine resin finishes leaving a slight bitterness. Earthy and pine hops played a bigger role than expected because I really didn't get any in the nose. Light body with large flavor, crisp and carbonated."
"A touch of toasty malt sweetness is evident at the start, with subtle banana joining in. Far and away the leading flavor is rindy, pithy, puckery hops, with the clove and banana very restrained. Dry and crisp at the finish, the rindy character really stands out. Interesting offering. I assumed it was an amped-up hefe, and not something like Schneider-Brooklyner... Near the end I swirled in all the bottle sediment, which really clouded things up. Nothing wrong with a healthy dose of yeasties, though!! Prosit!!"

"Not in love here, seems disjointed and in search of a theme. Sometimes what seems like a good idea, doesn't quite come together in practice. A bit dissappointed with this one."
"As I near the bottom of the bottle, I give it a good swirl to stir up some of the yeast. I'm expecting the yeast to be a little more appealing to my sweet, hefe loving palate.

"D - This one starts out very promising with an excellent, bright and peppery aroma of hops and spices. The flavor profile, unfortunately fails miserably in its attempt to live up to the promise of the aroma. The spicy notes have become an overwhelming and medicinal phenolic yeast character that just overwhelms everything else. If that weren't enough, the bitterness is excessive and pithy; to the point that it would seem harsh in a DIPA, let alone a beer like this. I am always a bit skeptical of Imperialized versions of wheat beers and lagers, but I have had so many surprisingly good beers from Peak that I though this one just might be one of the rare exceptions. Sadly, it was not."
"Tone down the booze, maybe bring it to 6-6.5 and i feel like I'd love this beer!"
"Pours a really clear deep golden color with a huge bubbly white head that sticks around forever. Smells of clove and allspice with hints of banana. There's lots of spicy yeast esters and a bit of lemon in this one and I heard tell there's some malt in here too, but I can't find it in the nose. Oh there it is. First sip proves there's some sweet malt in there. Taste is tart spicy phenolic-y. There's malt up front followed by an unpleasant alcohol burn then some clove and nail polish. Finishes with a lingering alcohol burn mixed with lemon pledge and a bit of earthiness. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, medium to full body and a spirited level of carbonation. Wow after the last few Peak beers really impressing me, this was quite a letdown. I don't think the high level of hops the spicy wheat, yeast, and alcohol meld very well in this one. One and done."
"On-tap at Ale+Witch. There are a lot of bad beers out there, this is just one of them. It pours a turbid yellow-golden hue and is capped with a frothy white head; it has a good and sturdy appearance. The nose, however, is just not melding its various elements very well, and is something of a wreck. Basic notes of banana are to be found in the aroma, with maybe a bit of bubblegum, cut grass, and chlorophyll, but those associations are quickly usurped by the familiar stench of wet latex paint. Ugghh. Bitter unripe banana and overripe orange juice is generally suggested in the flavor, atop of sweet and somewhat chalky wheat. The feel, well, it is not its fault. Overall this brew is a tremendous example of how flavors and elements can clash and produce negative results. Bad."
"I’m a guy who traditionally seeks out more ""extreme"" beers, and heffes do not often fall under the category. This beer on the other hand has the ABV and bitterness i like in my beers, while still being refreshing on a hot summer day. One word of caution however, if pouring from a bottle, LEAVE THE LAST INCH OF BEER IN THE BOTTLE! i spoke with Jon Cadoux, the head of peak organic, and he told me that in order to get the ABV they were going for, they had to use crazy amount of yeast (no surprise there). Their decision to remain true to heffe style and to stay 100% unfiltered, means you get a great beer, but you should sacrifice the last inch or so to the beer gods…"
"On tap at Cole's. Fruity colour, a nice bitterness,some lemon, creamy mouthfeel. Altogether a good summer beer. This brewery has not disapointed us with a standard product line.Pleasant fruity and fresh yeast aromas. Decent drinkability. Fairy high abv though."
"Overall: Super drinkable and great for the summer, reminds me of Lagunitas Little Sumpin'. Lots of good things going on here! A great mixture of Hefeweizen and IPA, and easily the best Peak Organic beer I have had so far."
"Poured a massive all head first time, off-white in color. Took awhile to settled down and reveal a hazy bright yellow body. Smells of bananas, spices, and hops. Taste has a more subdued version of the bananas and spices and a greatly pronounced IPA hops bitterness. Finish is quite long. As I got near the bottom of the pint the subsequent pours were ever more cloudy and quite a lot of sediment was in the bottom of the bottle. All in all although it's a fine flavorful beer I think it overdid the IPA aspect at the expense of the Hefe-weise attributes."
"From 22 ouncer with a tin foiled, screw-off cap. I cannot believe how milky it looks. It is pale yellow on the whole but it is so milky and cloudy that it is opaque. A good sized head. On the nose I get a good supply of wheat with a bit of yeast and white pepper. They say there's clove in it but I did not notice that. The body is about medium. The taste has a generous dose of wheat with a solid but sour hoppiness thrown in. The higher ABV is masked pretty well. It is good for what it is but it does not represent the style as well as I had hoped. I don't expect I would buy it again."
"Anyway, pours a cloudy amber with a very dense, creamy two fingers of foam that coats the glass. Smell: overripe banana, clove, milk caramel, hops are also here in equal measure: floral, herbal, lemon peel. Taste: banana, clove gets lost in a hefty spicy and leafy/herbal hop blast - citrus peel as well, then there's a somewhat offputting return of sickly sweet banana and caramel, right before the nice bitter/sticky, but not too sweet, finish. Creamy, pillowy feel. I really don't get this IPA + hefe/hefe-bock hybrid, but this one comes really close to being good. Just tone down the mid-sip sweetness and we could be friends."
"22oz screw-top (that's always a good sign) bomber purchased at Shaw's in Derry. Murky yellow-amber body with bits of yeast in addition to the suspended yeast, with nearly two inches of off-white head that has some rather large bubbles in it and which dissipates slowly leaving some lacing. Grassy hops share the aroma with nut, banana, and a hint of alcohol. Banana-nut and a bit of bubblegum hit the palate first, then they're rudely pushed aside by a rather large dose of grassy citrussy hops that round out the finish. Heavy bodied with ample carbonation. Not quite sure what to make of this one. I liked it a lot better once I read the side of the bottle and realized it was supposed to be a cross between an IIPA and a Hef. It's almost like drinking two strong beers at once, which is unique and interesting. I think I'll pass next time though."
"Overall kinda meh, way too sweet, too bitter, not the kinda beer that should be imperialized."
"This one tastes a little bit like poison. I recommend staying away."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades very slowly leaving some lace. Murky pale amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Yeasty nose, flavor is lemon and yeast, with a lingering pine hop aftertaste. Higher ABV is hidden. $5.95 for a 22oz bottle from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"O- The beer starts off good then goes way south. Perhaps could have been good if Peak didn't try to over hop it. The beer leaves a gross taste in mouth. Drain pour for sure. Stay away from this unless you have ever though that it would be good to steep green tea and old grass clippings into a good hefe or wheat beer."
"I thought this little experiment worked rather well, even with the widely divergent tastes."
"O- I hope this is the next break out style. A hefe/american ipa? A welcome change from all of the black and belgian IPAs. Best this brewery has offered yet."
"Glad this was less than $6. The concept of this beer just doesn't work for me. Very disappointing."
"O-What I said in taste sums it up. This beer is just a high ABV hop bomb. Nothing else. After drinking about 10% of the bottle, I had no desire to have any more"
