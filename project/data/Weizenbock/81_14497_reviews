"Pretty good beer. Head not very strong, creamy. Aroma: sweet and gentle coffee. The flavor is ""thick"", slightly bitter, caramel and a little coffee. Drink a light and pleasant"
"Very solid beer. Clearly underrated."

"I can't believe I'm enjoying this beer. Tarwebok is an okay weizenbock. Try it."

"Overall a good beer, and the ABV of 6,5% doesn't seem to be that obvious, which in combination with its sweetness, makes it more an everyday bock beer for me."

"look is standard with some initial foam over an Amber beer, etched surface. Nose Carries, cherry and toasted brown sugar along with some decent Bock malts. Taste is vanilla, sweet, wheat and fruity. A little thin bodied with hi carb. Drinkable."
"O - This is okay. A little too sweet for my taste in Weizenbocks."
""
"O: First try with this style of beer, I def. enjoyed it. I've read up on it a bit and it seems this style can run the gamit on the sweetness. I'd be very interested in trying another to compare this to and also try this on tap and see if I can notice much of a difference."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the aroma. Although mild, there were some nice malts and sweeter, caramel and estery inclusions. The taste, however was too sweet, and became overwhelming at points. Additionally, it was felt that for the style, the malts were a bit too dark, overpowering the esters and phenols, both of which we would have liked to see more represented."

"O) This was a nice after dinner sipper for sure. Likely the highlight of the holiday pack from Heineken. I would recommend giving this beer a try."

"Bock beers are rather hard to come by in Australia, so this is a rare treat and a far more interesting beer than Heineken's usual product."
"Note: This is actually a weizenbock, as it is brewed with 17% wheat malt."
"Taste has a good balance, while not totally balanced, of hops and malt. Bitter enough to keep it tame, and the sweetness is followed well by a clean finish."
"The flavor is fantastic, I was definately not expecting the bum-rush of hops, caramel, toffee, chocolate, and alcoholic notes. Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing, as the medium body of the Tarwebok finishes with a little hoppy bite to remember it by. Overall, this is a tasty beer with a moderate amount of complexity. If anything, it's a bit too sweet, but I was willing to overlook that fact and give it a decent rating. I hope I run into this one again."
"Taste is SWEET!, holy crap this stuff is even sweeter than I thought, sticky on the lipps. All this sweetness overrules any other taste, but I am still able to pick up the roasted and dark malts. It tastes like the fermentation has been stopped prematurely. What an incredible sweetness, almost like molasses have been thrown into water and partly fermented. I can hardly get my lipps apart."
"Drinkability: Would love to have more. Although 1-2 beers per session. Definitely not the beer of choice if you want to binge drink. (Binge drinking is bad by the way). Sip beer. Defenitely recommended."
"Overall a pretty drinkable brew."
"A very nice amber color with a cream colored head. Aroma is classic bock, sweet caramel aroma. It has a medium body with a caramelly beginning that's slightly oily on the tongue and finishes dry with some alcohol. It's a bit on the candy sugar sweet vs malty sweet but not a bad bock overall."
"Quite simply one of the finest beers I've ever sampled. I can't believe how far Heineken, makers of one of my least favorite beers (the lager) have hit it out of the park. Pours a deep brown with a nice head that quickly tapers off to a nice lace on the glass. Smell is of figs, cinnamon and malt. Taste is unbelievable... malty with hints of plum sweetness, brown sugar, a touch of coffee and a bit of rum. Mouthfeel is rich and fulfilling. An amazingly complex beer with a slightly sweet, smokey finish. By the way, I had to bring this back from Aruba. Unfortunately Heineken does not seem to import this to the US."
