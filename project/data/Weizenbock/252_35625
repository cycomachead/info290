The color is a golden yellow with a slight, even haziness (a tulip beer glass showcases the beauty of the color and pleasant aroma) and light, white frothy head.  The smell is lightly banana, pear, clove and warmed bread.  The taste is balanced and smooth with a depth of a light pear/banana flavor amidst the wheat/rye texture.  It is smooth, clean and rich in taste.  It is excellent with a heavy breakfast of meat and potatoes, delightful with a hot soup and buttered bread on a winter day and compliments every meat or fish meal I have tried.  I highly recommend this beer.  It has a taste, quality, consistency and depth of color, taste and smell that is not encountered often in the world.  It is a distinct beer.  The beer, as it warms, from the refrigerator releases more subtle flavor and richness of taste.  This is a beer for special occasions and a reward for a job well done.","breezyday","Jan 24, 2015"

Faded to about a quarter inch that lasted to the end, nice lacing. The color is a cloudy golden-yellow, with lots of carbonation bubbles continually refreshing the foam. The smell is fantastic, with lots of bready yeast prominent, filled in by great banana, bubblegum and clove aromas- one of the best beer aromas out there. The taste was nearly identical to the smell, however the banana flavors really came out. Just the right amount of sweetness too, with a touch of clovey, bubblegummy goodness. The mouthfeel was creamy and kinda chewy almost, with a bit of the prickly carbonation that lets you know you've got something special here. This is such an outstanding beer, and for the price- world class!","timontheroad","Dec 09, 2014"

A light bit of sluggish to moderate paced carbonation...  A big rich nose dominated by wheat, yeast, honey and candied sugars...   There is a potent fruitiness about in the form of pear and apple...   There's also a subtle musky funkiness that lingers in the nose as well...  A big rich flavor profile that is identical to the aroma with perhaps a slight addition of some overly ripened banana...  There's also a subtle touch of booziness on the finish...  Medium bodied...

AROMA: sweet wheat aromas mixed with vanilla and some faint banana. no hop aromas. some alcohol. APPEARANCE: gold color and hazy. large moussy white head with good retention. TASTE: sweet vanilla flavour, mixed with a strong wheat presence. very low bitterness with a relative dry finish. PALATE: medium body with moderate carbonation. OVERALL: a very interesting variation of the traditional weizen bock style, which uses a dunkelweizen.","titvs","Oct 19, 2014"

Some of the typical wheat and banana flavors from a hefeweizen, but the malt has more layers to it, starting off dry and switching to softer/sweeter malt flavors.  The carbonation settles down as this warms up which adds points for me, and booze pretty much disappears with warmth too.  Definitely a beer I'd revisit, but I'd probably prefer the classic weihenstephaner hefe the majority of times over this.  (91/100)","CTbrew32","Oct 17, 2014"

The alcohol content makes it dangerous because it is so drinkable and the alcohol is virtually undetectable.  It goes down as easy as a light Hefe but reminds you of the extra alcohol at the end.

I got a dense finger of bone-white head with good retention as a result. Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a Hefeweizen, especially in terms of the banana esters, although I got some clove, but accompanied by a bit of heat. I was ready to sneeze. Mouthfeel was medium. I initially thought to myself ""Hefeweizen! Burned again!"" since I am not a big fan of the style, but then the heat kicked in and I realized why this was a Winter beer. Bananas + heat = Bananas Foster! Man, I really dug it in Advanced Foods in HomeEc when we did flambe desserts. Hit the lights, get some fire going and serve. In this case, I was getting ready to hit the deck! It was like a rabbit punch. I did not see this coming, despite the label. Finish was dry, mainly thanks to its inherent heat. Phew!

While we Americans do have the IPA market locked up, I firmly believe that if you are looking for an excellent wheat beer, look no further than a German or Belgian brewery.","TheCondor","Jul 09, 2014"

4.44,4,3.75,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy yellow-orange pour with a two finger foamy pure white head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is classic Weizen with spicy wheat up front along with hints of banana, clove, lemon, caramel, yeast, and grass. The taste is bold, spicy, and extremely rich with lots of sweet caramel malt along with hints of banana bread, lemon, clove, pear, apple cider, yeast, and grass. The mouthfeel is really thick and chewy with perfect carbonation and a nice tangy finish. Overall, this is definitely the most flavorful Weizen I've ever had. Having lived in Germany for 13 years and only recently re-visiting Weizens, I'm kicking myself. I've really become a big fan of these beers and will definitely stock up on this gem!","beerdrifter","Jul 01, 2014"

Lots going on with the aroma as there is wheat, yeast, cloves citrus and even banana. The taste is complex as well with the spices of clove & nutmeg and sweet banana mixing well with the wheat and biscuit (yeast). Perfect carbonation and goes down so easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste either. I guess the oldest brewery (1040 A.D.) has figured out how to make some great brews over the years and nailed it.","BeerWithMike","Apr 20, 2014"

A dark honey appearance that you cannot see through, with a light powdery foam head that settles but laces little and has no glass cling.

Aroma of doughy wheat, banana and yeast, classic Weihenstephaner; these wheat beers small really good. Flavor of semisweet wheat, clove, apple and pear juice, turns drier with a slight tartness and grassy hops before finishing with light wheat and estery fruit juice. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. One of the last of the wheat beers from this brewery I've had the pleasure to drink and certainly one of the best ones. Interesting flavor progression with a pleasant play of lightly sweet versus dry elements. The flavors are well balanced and spicing is deftly done. One of the world's great beers.

The aroma is of clove, straw, wheat, lemon zest, and hints of citric and lactic acid. Some orange rind and hay as well. The flavor is similar with a predominant clove and wheat bastion reinforced by lemon and orange citruses. Some straw, hay, and other light earthen notes comprise the middle. More banana on the finish. The mouthfeel is velvety yet lively with a wet but refreshing finish. A touch of clove and citrus linger. Overall, this is a wonderful beer and a personal favorite. The clove predominance combined with a bit of a “beefier” mouthfeel compared to the hefeweisse makes it a wonderful variation of another excellent Weihenstephaner offering. Well balanced, rich in complexity, and a superb example of the style.","eclipse54","Feb 11, 2014"

APPEARANCE: thick, snow white head that occupies half the glass; cloudy, faint pale orange body; smooth wispy cloudlike lacing... AROMA: beautiful clove and cinnamon/nutmeg mix with grapefruit and citrus to produce a celebration of scents... PALATE: as drinkable a 7.7% ABV as you'll find; soft, warming sensation at the throat; slightly active overall...TASTE: slightly tart at the lips; a clean, ever-so-subtle malty base; a bit yeasty late; unmistakable wheat, clove and citric kick--a pleasure... OVERALL: as far as gift sets go, this Weihenstephaner is among the best in recent memory--five above-the-standard beers and a handsome weizen glass made the price equitable...formidable but balanced, smooth yet arresting, this beer delivers the malt that sets it apart from its gif-pack brethren...","dacrza1","Jan 31, 2014"

Flavor is sweet wheat, funky banana spice and yeast, hay. Very crisp with lingering hay and banana on the palate.

It's grainy, like an adjunct lager. The taste is a whole different animal, though. The grain flavours are so light, that they are taken over by strong notes of banana, cloves, citrus peel, and spices. Are there spices in this beer? The notes are so strong that I would suspect so. These aren't all what I'm looking for in a weizenbock, typically, but it makes for an excellent all-around brew, no question. I'm used to a dominating banana note and a bite from a weizenbock. This has the banana, but too much orange peel, and it completely lacks any bite, which disappoints me a little. The flavour of this beer is typical of Old World traditional brews. Reminds me of a Belgian abbey ale. Those are good, so I can't rate this particularly poorly. I was really looking for more bite in my weizenbock, though.","ElCommodoro","Nov 22, 2013"

The taste had the signature German wheat beer tastes of banana, sweet candy, and a bit of citrus. The Vitus had a very creamy mouthfeel that spoke to its craftsmanship and elegantly balanced tasting experience. This was a great weizenbock and one that surprised me a bit as I didn't know what to expect. The Vitus is a beer to look for and one that will pleasantly surprise any beer lover.","brurevu","Oct 28, 2013"

A golden orange glow weizenbock, eh? I'm in the aromatics, hints of sliced fresh apple, baked bread, hints of clove and fruit esters this beer hides the alcohol quite well. Flavor coats the sides of the palate with ample sweetness, sturdy alcohol in the backend, hints of green apple, ripened banana, and spicy clove accents. This beer has some girth to it, definitely a strong alcohol presence the more it warms but it's well woven into a comfortable wheat beer setting. It reminds me a lot of the Glissade Bock Sierra Nevada used to make except this is a stronger wheat version of that style. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying mid way through each sip, even keeled carbonation enough to carry the beer along medium to full but yet comes of drinkable with a slight alcohol burn. Overall, a perfectly good strong wheat beer from Germany, got it in a gift pack for 15.99 with 5 beers and a glass that's value.","WVbeergeek","Oct 07, 2013"

I'm also getting some faint clove. Very nice smelling wheat. Taste is killer, huge flavorful wheat thats just dry enough but not overly so. Clean and crisp, alcohol is a little noticeably but that entirely fine with me. This brewery has it down pat, they've had enough time and time pays off.","screamking","Jul 30, 2013"

The smell of the beer has a fruity aroma, along the lines of peach and banana. Really fresh smelling beer. The taste is also fruity (apple), there is some bready yeast flavors and a subtle spice note in the finish. I do get a slight metallic flavor that I'm not digging too much, hoping that fades as it warms up. The mouthfeel is soft, very smooth with a decent carbonation.

As much as I love Aventinus, I've got to admit - I kind of like this stuff a bit more. This brew is definitely a bit lighter (in terms of both appearance and taste) and more 'hefe-like', which may or may not be a big part of why I like it. But rather than argue that the oldest brewery in the world isn't following style guidelines, I would rather lie back, sip this slowly, and contemplate how said brewery can make such consistently incredible beer. I guess practice does make perfect? This stuff is absolutely worth a try; no fan of German beer, wheat beer, or beer in general should deny themselves the hedonistic pleasure that is Vitus.","thehyperduck","Jan 07, 2013"

There is a slight rosy pink tint to the beer, similar to how the hefeweizen looked, which may come from the heavy haze which keeps the other side of the glass obscured from view. Lacing is fat and fluffy, again reminding me of the hefeweizen. Honestly, if I didn’t know better I’d say I was looking their hefeweizen right now, as it and this weizenbok look nearly identical. On the nose, this beer is heavy spicy banana, with more clove than in the hefeweizen, slight hints of bubblegum, and some nice light cream and mint notes. The smell is quite sticky and heavy on the nostrils in contrast with all other Weihenstephaner beers I’ve sampled. The beer tastes wonderfully of banana bread, cloves, and slight bubble gum. The banana flavors are more over ripe than in other wheat beers I’ve sampled. The beer begins with light spicy clove and faint banana before opening into bready banana flavors with slight bubblegum/mint hints and a creamy banana smoothie note. The aftertaste is light with banana. On the mouth this beer feels chewy and creamy, of a medium to thick viscosity, with creamy carbonation on the tongue that really starts to remind me of a banana smoothie. The mouth is left clean, save for a slight creamy ichor of sweet saliva. Overall this is another terrific wheat beer from Weihenstephaner, similar to their hefeweizen but a bit thicker and heavier in the stomach. A classic for sure!

It reminds me of that very hefe jacked up on richness and more of the ingredients I enjoy so much.

Really great flavors. Its just an all around fantastic brew. Well worth the price and just great flavors and drinkability.

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. All of the right notes that one would expect were going on in this one. This fact made it quite enjoyable and definitely a good start for anyone looking to try something new. All of the flavors and aromas were on-point on this one.

4.43,3.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a hazy golden color with a mountainous, rocky white head. Honestly, the gentlest pour is all you need to make a fluffy head that most beers couldn't produce when poured with the utmost vigor. A solid bouquet of banana and cloves serves as a worthy harbinger of what's to come. Banana bread, clove, and wheat meld together to great effect, and the mouthfeel is exquisite. The bountiful carbonation accentuates the spiciness nicely and serves to temper a fruitiness that could become cloying if left unchecked. One really has to search for a fault, but if I'm being picky, there is a very slight metallic taste in the finish, but it's negligible. This weizenbock is more weizen than bock, and that serves me just fine. It's velvety, delicious, and perfect on a hot summer day.

Some spotty lacing on the glass with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big banana, clove, pepper, biscuit, orange, wheat, bubblegum, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice aroms with good complexity and balance. Taste of big banana, bubblegum, lemon, clove, pepper, orange zest, bread, wheat, earth, and yeast spices. Fairly spicy finish; with lingering notes of banana, citrus, pepper, clove, bread, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Incredible flavor balance of maltiness and yeast spiciness; with great complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with fairly slick and creamy mouthfeel that is extremely smooth. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 7.7%, with pretty much no warming after the finish present. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic weizenbock style. Insane flavor balance and complexity, and extremely smooth to drink for the level of alcohol.

The initial taste was the awesome belgian yeast tang that reminds many of bananas. This flavor alone makes this a great beer, but the taste goes further. Also accompanying the yeast was a mild peppery notes that only served to give the beer a delightfully more complex layer. A hint of honey was even detectable. The sweet notes continued to the finish, at which point the peppery notes became slightly more obvious. The mouthfeel was smooth, being easy on the carbonation.

Well… to find out I poured this Weizenbock out of a bottle into my glass where it quickly formed a billowing head of slightly yellow-tinted foam. The liquid itself was a cloudy, golden, wheat color with lots of rising carbonation. The retention of the head proved to be quite good and it left sliding bands of lacing. The aroma was of sweet malt and some doughy malt, fruity esters, cloves, coriander, honey and a little pepper. The flavors were pleasantly complex yet inviting and very agreeable. I tasted the sweet malt and wheat first with notes of shortbread cookie dough (sorta sweet, buttery and vanilla-ish) followed by the aforementioned spices. The honey and fruity esters appeared in the middle along with some honeysuckle and floral hops. The pepper note combined with the hops towards the end giving it a spicy, spirited finish. I was also totally amazed at how easy it was to drink this beer. 7.7%? Are you sure? The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation on the feisty side. I really enjoyed this beer and think it’s a bargain for the quality it delivers, not to mention the efficacy of its impact…","thekevlarkid","Mar 22, 2012"

This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth and held my attention, I will for sure be drinking this in the summer. What I liked most about this beer was how complex the flavors were and how good it looked. There was nothing that I didn't like about this beer, it was what it was. I would for sure buy this beer again especially in the summer, and I recommend this to any Wheat beer lover. I liked this beer even though it wasn't what I was expected. Weihenstephaner comes through with a solid beer, but I think I prefer the darker ones instead, either way it was solid and I enjoyed drinking it.","StoutHunter","Mar 09, 2012"

The higher ABV also contributes to the crisp spiciness. Vitus is delicious. I've had Weihenstephaner Hefe a few times already and have yet to review it, though it is a must-try classic. You can tell Vitus is made by the same craftsmen, but the flavor explosion is just a step above, especially good for special occasions. Weihenstephaner is easily one of my favorite breweries - the lager and wheat exceptionally good and sessionable, and the Vitus and Korbinian outstanding for showing how simple ingredients can turn into a thing of pure magic.","angusdegraosta","Dec 30, 2011"

4.46,4.4,3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Vitus pours a very surprisingly light golden yellow, with a massive, fluffy white head. It easily fills up more than half the glass, but fades a litle too quickly for my taste. Similarly, lacing left behind is a bit spotty.The nose is extremely powerful, and smells a bit like a hefeweizen on steroids. There's an additional bit of mat sweetness though, to balance out the massive banana and (moreso) clove. The extra malt shows up on my palate as well, as there's an increased vanilla sweetness from having more wheat in the grain bill. There's also a slight warming sensation from alcohol, which is a solid addition to the beer. Still though, this one's a massive clove/banana weiss yeast bomb. The mouthfeel is truly remarkable though. I'm half convinced that Weihenstephan made some kind of deal with the devil to get a body this light on a beer this big/flavorful. Carbonation is almost frantic (without becoming overbearing), and the result is a mouthfeel that is the definition of effervescent. Vitus basically an imperial hefe, as opposed to many weizenbocks incorporating some darker malts, but it's nonetheless world class.","axeman9182","Mar 05, 2011"

The beer has a heavy spice forward flavor, with the coriander (and possibly pepper?) riding on top of a round, sweet malty foundation. Bits of citrus throughout, maybe orange and grapefruit, but hard to pinpoint with the spices. The beer is full and bold in mouth, with a transition to a slightly sour, spicy aftertaste. The citrus notes linger through to the end, also, and make your mouth pucker a bit when added to the sour notes. The finish is a bit dry, and makes you eager for that next mouthful.

Weizenbock is essentially a Dunkelweizen brewed to the strength of a (Doppel)bock, however, the pale visual appearance of Vitus is reminiscent more of a Hefeweizen than Dunkleweizen. Aroma is Doppelbock-like sweetness with banana esters, clove phenolics and bready malt. A careful sniffing session reveals plum & raisin-like fruitiness that gets more prominent as the beer warms. Very faint alcohol shines through. Flavor is rich sweetness (suggesting the malt hasn't beet fermented thoroughly) with banana, clove and wheat. Hop flavor is virtually absent and the finish is somewhat balanced by light hoppy bitterness and very faint alcohol. The palate is sweet, body medium-full with very smooth creamy texture and moderate carbonation. As stated above, the appearance of Vitus resembles a good Hefeweizen although it is easily distinguished from the later by having a minor head and fuller body. There could be more melanoidin & dark fruit character but it's a very decent beer nevertheless.","crnipeter","Jan 25, 2011"

Weihenstephaner makes so many great beers, everything I have tried from th has been phenomenal and this is no different. I recently tried a few weizenbocks and can now say that this is my favorite. It pours a hazy dark gold color with a tall off white head that slowly dissipates, leaving some lacing in my glass. Smell is mostly wheat, but there also notes of banana and clove. Taste is similar, complex with wheat, bready malt, banana and clove notes and a touch of hops. It is sort of fruity and spicy but the backbone is still the wheat. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy with average carbonation. Drinkability is superb. This beer is everything I love about Hefeweizens, Dunkelweizens and Maibocks rolled into one, balanced perfectly and with just the right mouthfeel. Great beer!","gkunkle","Jan 23, 2011"

Just a little lacing is left on my weizen glass. Big, brassy, hefeweizen aromas here. Hints of banana, cloves, and a little granery dust aroma. Flavor is huge wheat beer. Bananas and bubblegum with just a small dose of cloves. If you are a fan of weizens, then this beer is a must for you. A little darker malt may have complimented this beer further, but it is quite sucessful as is. One of the more fuller wheat beers I have had. Carbonation is just a tick low as it seems just a little flat, but otherwise has a nice texture. For some reason this beer does not make it to the Minnesota market. I wish it did.","morimech","Dec 21, 2010"

4.25,-0.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I've been wanting to try this one for a long time, even though it's not my favorite style, mostly because of Coloradobobs. Pours a pale yellow color with a hazy golden hue in the center. Large white tops things off and recedes slowly. Typical wheat beer smell, mostly banana and clove, with a touch of pale malt and slightly hoppy/herbal background, but this mostly about the sweet wheat. Taste is wonderful! Delicious citrusy notes, banana as in the nose, with a touch of alcohol and perhaps some licorice on the dry finish. I really like that this weizenbock is not a dunkel variety. This tastes like a standard Hefe with the flavor and booze ramped up just a few notches. Carbonation is a bit high at first, but it starts to settle down mid-glass with some gentle swirling, medium body. Good stuff here, very drinkable despite the high(er) ABV.","KeefD","Dec 01, 2010"

4.28,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Summarizing - It poured from the growler with an initial swell of soft, creamy head, but it soon deflated, leaving a thin misty blanket of suds on top of the, as I mentioned, autumn-orange tinged body - hazy bordering on cloudy. Fresh-baked, doughy bread aromas with faintly sticky navel orange notes as well. The alcohol is wonderfully obfuscated in the aroma and the taste, too, not even causing much of a stir in the finish. The moderate, yet assertive, breadiness and esters balance out superbly, really forming the backbone of the taste. Tartness from the wheat kept in check, just about a whisper. And as I also said, the best in every facet of this beer comes to the fore when it's lost its chill. A wholly satisfying, smooth and hearty feel, at the same time finishing light and refreshing for the style. Let it warm - to where it's actually almost warm - and you'll get the most out of it.

This was the first time that I've had this beer and was surprised by how pale it was. Aroma is of strong banana, clove, and wheat. This is one of the best smelling beers that I've had, not very surprising for a Weihenstephaner wheat beer. The flavor is similar to an imperialized hefeweizen. Strong banana and very strong clove. Wheat is present but is not as strong as the regular Weihenstephaner hefe. Just a tinge of faint cocoa is noted at the end of the swallow. Simply fantastic.

It's got a big kick, yet ends pretty light, thanks to the high carbonation. It has a wonderful effect, where the snap of yeast combines with the bubbles to give an attention-grabbing finish. There's really not a tremendous amount of flavor on the front, but it really picks up mid-way on. The body is boisterously fluffy, reminding me of Belgian strong pale. There's a slightly sweet aftertaste, as well as some fruit notes, possibly pear or apple. This is an amped up hefe if I'm not mistaken, and it's likely my first.

The aroma is of a multitude of yeasty esters, the primary ones being--not surprisingly--clove (the most prominent), banana, and bubblegum. The taste is similar, but there is a certain cloying sweetness as well. A bit of the wheat seems to be coming through in the taste, although the mouthfeel is a little thin, so it's not coming through in that regard.

There is a lot of intensity to the yeast flavors here that seems to be a byproduct of the relatively high gravity. The intensity of the bubble-gum and clove character isn't over the top, but if it were much stronger it would hurt the beer. There is a lot of malt backing the yeast, and that helps keep it drinkable. The aroma is excellent, but the flavor of intense, almost harsh, yeast is just not as well balanced as I would like it to be.

The alcohol is a bit noticeable, so I found myself drinking it a bit slower than I expected. But taste urged me to drink more.

The alcohol is quite disguised; I could get into MAJOR trouble with this one as you don't realize it's as potent as it is. If not for the alcohol content, I'd call this a sessionable brew.

The taste was a lot spicier than the Hefeweizen this looked like. The clove notes were much more pronounced and there was also some sourness apparent. Very light in the mouth, which is quite typical of wheat based beers, but it was quite a bit lighter than anticipated considering this is a Weizenbock. Probably the easiest to drink near 8% beer I've sampled. Way different than Aventinus or any other examples of this style.","rajendra82","May 10, 2009"

Similar flavor, with yeast, a touch of banana, clove spiciness, light bitterness, and some warming alcohol. The flavor really opens up as it warms, and the sweetness increases with the temperature.

I only have four different Weizenbocks under my belt thus far, so I speak more from enthusiasm for a particular beer than appreciation of a well-executed style. I guess that's my disclaimer. At any rate, Vitus is a thick hazy light to medium golden liquid with a silky head of tiny bubbles. The nose is sweet with the spiced wheat banana flavor of good German wheat beer. The flavor is all wonderful wheat. There are notes of banana, clove, bubblegum and some other hard to place fruits and spices. It's quite sweet. The relatively high abv is well-hidden from both tongue and nose. The mouthfeel is luxuriously velvety. The finish is a bit tart and sweet, like a candied lemon rind.

This is a bit stronger in ABV than your garden variety hefe. It is still fairly light bodied, but there is an acerbic twinge towards the finish that is not entirely from spice or hop, but also from some ABV.

The head also doesn't stick around like most hefe's. The lack of head retention in it really surprised me. The aroma is a banana smack to the face. Huge clove, coriander, and for the very first time, I definitely get big bubble gum notes. The flavor reminds me a lot of fresh made banana bread. Big banana, clove, walnuts, and coriander. And surprisingly, once again, bubble gum. This is really the first time I have ever gotten any type of bubble gum out of a beer. The mouthfeel is a nice medium bodied hefe.

The taste is what you would expect from a wheat beer, but the alcohol is high enough to add more spice and some bitterness that a weizen with a lower ABV lacks.

A slight alcohol warmth as it goes down. Carbonation is a little high, but good, leaves a relatively crisp taste. Overall a pretty drinkable beer.

It's a heavy type of beer that goes down like a brick. The 7.7% ABV doesn't really jump out at you. There's no alcohol burn. But it's a thick beer.

A burst of citric notes when I smelled it; haven't really smelled a hefe that powerful which is amazing in this case since this isn't even a hefe. Orange, banana, pineapple or pear, along with pepper and I want to say there's clove in there, maybe coriander. First thing that struck me about this beer was how smooth it was while retaining a large citric flavor and packing the spices on the backend. There's no hop bitterness at all, just orange and lemon mostly on the tastebuds with the pepper/clove on the backbite. Also a little sweet on the sides, like they put sugar in or something (bubblegum?). Sitting at the bar with this on tap, I could drink it all night.

The color strikes me as unexpected. I was looking to see something a little darker. The aroma is big in banana, clove, and wheat creamyness. There is a zesty lemon tartness as well, but it is lacking the deeper malt notes of melanoidans and dark fruits that I was wanting to find. Don;t get me wrong, this is a very nice smelling beer, but I am not getting weizenbock out of this at all. The flavor brings a light golden raisin fruityness and wheat creamyness. Behind this, a prevalent clove ester and lemon zest character comes through. The banana hits on the finish, carrying it through to the end. This is another magnificent wheat beer from this brewery. Mouthfeel is moderate, creamy, and smooth, with a prevalent moderate carbonation. Overall, this one is very nice.

4,-6.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy orange/golden, massive white head forms, slowly settles down to a thick layer, leaves behind a ton of chunky lacing. Very nice to look at! Smell is nice, tons of banana, yeast, wheat, spices, very fruity, some alcohol makes its way in, but quite soft. Taste is different, apples and bananas, some wheat, very yeasty, bread, cane sugar, some alcohol, more apple in the finish with a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, bit of warmth. Pretty light for a weizenbock but I like it.","Viggo","Feb 20, 2008"
4.52,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, to me this is simply an amped up version of the best Hefeweizen I've ever had.

That being said, it is a very good brew, and at 7.7% ABV, sneaks up on you in a hurry, as it does have easy drinkability of a wheat beer.

It's refreshingly fruity and full of carbonation. I was really expecting something darker. The taste is good as well. It has a crisp, pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean with some fruity yeast esters. The elevated abv. is hidden quite well in this one. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good tasting beer. It's like nothing I've ever tried.

At 7.7% ABV, this beer is every bit as drinkable as a 5% hefe. Simply delicious.

Lots of banana-like phenols, along with some green apple and clove. Not much in the way of hops, but a faint wheat character. Flavor is much sweeter than a regular weizen, again with lots of banana and some clove. Finish is fruity, with lots of green apple, and some dry, bready wheat character. Little bit full bodied for the flavor.","beerking1","Jan 06, 2008"

3.72,-12.9,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Weizenbock has recently become one of my favorite styles. The fact that this brewery has decided to produce one is awesome. Poured in to a weizen glass a murky orange, with a large white head that dissolved very quickly. Aroma is very clean, with bits of bread, clove and banana. Taste is round and tasty, with more bread and banana coming through. This one seems a little bit light for the style in body, but at the same time the alcohol does not show itself at all. This would make a nice session beer. Maybe not the best Weizenbock I have tasted, but certainly an interesting one.","jamie2dope","Dec 16, 2007"

Nose has an earthy aroma, spices also present, coriander and cloves come to mind, light and clean. Start has a sweet grain presence, with the top light to medium in feel. Finish as a benign acidity, the earthy, soapy sweetness continues to the dry aftertaste, a nice drinking beer, but did seem a little thin to me, with the hop presence very subdued, nonetheless, worthy of a sample.","Gusler","Nov 28, 2007"

I probably would have given a perfect score for appearance if this was a hefeweizen and not a weizenbock, as this is the lightest weizenbock I have ever seen. Definitely not to style. Nice wheaty and yeasty aroma. It certainly does fit the weizenbock profile in its flavour though. Strong flavours - wheat, yeast, banana. The alcohol feels evident - or that could just be the aftereffects of the Indian dinner. I am liking this significantly better than Weihenstephaner's dunkelweizen, but then again, I'm a big fan of this style.","sstackho","Oct 17, 2007"
