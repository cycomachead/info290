4.05,2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall this is a great Weizenbock. Sweeter and fuller than they typical version of the style but damn delicious!","DrDemento456","Feb 19, 2012"
4.01,1,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pennsylvania Brewing Company's Weizenbock is a beer that only a beer geek could love. It is tremendously bitter and strong and spicy and malty and fruity all at once. Put another way, it's got more hops, alcohol, phenols, grain and esters than most people can handle. Proceed with a full stomach, a ready palate, and, just maybe, a couple friends.","biegaman","Jun 18, 2011"

3.11,-21.7,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a rich brown with a decent off white foam forming. In the aroma, sugary malts and a whiff of alcohol. Flavor is dominated by sweet malts, some honey baked bread and alittle alcohol heat. Wheat elements with faint banana. Little hop presence, leaving the finish sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and alittle chewey. Overall, not sure what to make of this one, would have it again but could stand to use alittle more balance.","Stinkypuss","May 08, 2011"
4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"M: What a weizenbock should be. The spiciness and strong wheat body conspire to make a delicious ale. On tap, the fullness is very nice.","akorsak","May 08, 2011"
4.1,3.3,4,4,4,5,4,"Overall, probably the sweetest Weizenbock I have ever had, but that is fine with me because I am a malt-head.","mikeyv35","May 07, 2011"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Feels creamy up front with enough hops in the finish. Malty sweet; over-riped bananas. Yeasty flavors dry on the tongue. A little bit of the alcohol shows. Medium mouth-feel on the delicate side. Enjoyed this one.","DerekP","Apr 28, 2011"
4.1,3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"O: This beer isnâ€™t that difficult to drink for the style because the alcohol is well masked from the taste.","metter98","Apr 23, 2011"

3.12,-21.4,3,3.5,3,3,3,"I would never purchase it again. Yes, it has a high alcohol content, but you cannot taste it, so it is pretty drinkable. You could throw them down and just suddenly pass out.","righthereisay","0"
4.03,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall, a very good beer. It's balanced, and not too strong.","Shaw","May 17, 2009"

4.03,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a cloudy, dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice pale, wheat, and crystal malt scent along with a wonderful yeasty aroma. It's quite fruity. The taste is good. It has a dry roasted malt flavor with some caramel sweetness in the finish. The yeast adds a nice level of complexity; infusing it with dark fruit esters. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific beer. The malt bill is outstanding as well as the character the yeast provides.","WesWes","May 08, 2009"
4.3,8.3,4,4,4,5,5,"Cloudy dark brown color with a big beige head that left spots of lacing. The aroma is of dark fruits and spiced wheat malt. Good tasting brew, a blend of sweet fruit flavors and wheat beer spices. A full bodied beer that is creamy smooth and goes down really easy.","JoeyBeerBelly","Mar 03, 2009"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Penn Weizenbock pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twenty five ounce bottle. The aroma has a bit of banana in it. The flavor is typical of a weinzenbock, a bit fruity, some bubblegum, lots of banana and some clove. Pretty enjoyable, definitely worth a try.","Drew966","Feb 07, 2009"
3.91,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at Flying Saucer, the $2.75 fire sale no less! Served in a standard pint glass an extremely murky brown, almost like a glass of muddy water. Aroma is loads of wheat, brown malt, spices and a touch of molasses. Taste is everything I expect for the style; crisp malt, wheat, clove and spice. The beer is medium bodied with the alcohol fairly well hidden. This is a very enjoyable beer, one of the best American brewed Weizenbocks I've had and certainly the best beer from Penn I've had so far.","atsprings","Dec 16, 2008"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a murky mud puddle brown color with an average tan head. The aroma is spicy with clove and pepper and an almost meaty/soy sauce smell from the malt. This is definitely more bock than weizen but that's ok. Very big meaty malt presence, soy sauce, wet wood. This is somewhat cut by the wheat malt but not really. Some of the weizen characteristics pop through but not much. A nice full body, not quite chewy, lots of carbonation to offset the malt makes this easier to drink. Sweet yet saviory. A different angle for a weizen bock; more bock centric. I prefer my weizen bocks to be more hefe like but this still has really good flavors and aroma. Worth picking up.","Gmann","Dec 10, 2008"
4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A solid weizenbock. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen, though it is indeed up there (though not necessarily for the style), which enhances the drinkability, and it's complex enough brew that it's an interesting drink. Give it a shot if you run across it.","CrellMoset","Dec 07, 2008"

3.13,-21.2,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,2,"750 mL bottle. Nose has some nice elements to it, with notes of honey, grapes and wheat malts and a touch of vanilla, clove and other yeast components. Flavor is authentic and has nice purity, but is a bit cloying, and doesn't have the fullness in the mouth I'd like.","Crosling","Oct 11, 2008"
3.9,-1.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"D-Very nice example of a weizenbock. However, I'm not sure I could have taken on more than one bottle.","slowhead","Aug 14, 2008"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"D- I like this brew-but honestly think that I should have chosen a different glass. It's a very good, solid weizenbock-that confuses me even more on what the typical style profile is for this beer. Definately worth a try.","PittBeerGirl","Jul 01, 2008"
4.45,12.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: very nice weizenbock. I really enjoyed this one and it is a great one to share since its a 750mL. great example of the style.","paulthebeerguru","Jun 27, 2008"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"sampled this at the south philly tap room's wheat beer fest. pours a nice dark amber to brown color, with a decent off white/brown head. up front you'd think this beer would be a bit heavier cuz of the color and the ABV, but that's not the case. comes through nice and refreshing, which you'd expect from a wheat beer. has a nice spicy finish to it, which caught me a little off guard, but was a positive. didn't really pull to much of a hop flavor upfront or at the tailend. for the ABV you by far get your money's worth, but becareful; these go down a lot easier than a beer of this stature should.","fishtownhxc","Jun 04, 2008"
4.33,9.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I am very impressed with the four bocks and regular weizen/other stuff I've had from Penn Brewing. All of them have been very authentically German-tasting! Very nice job guys! In a world of super hoppy brews (which I DO like), Penn Brewing might just be an under-appreciated brewery. Hey Penn Brewing, is there any chance of you making a malty, dark-ish, eisbock in the future? I would LOVE to try one from you. I bet you would hit that one out of the ballpark! Just make sure you keep sending your special brews to Florida so I can buy them when I'm down there.","ohmybock","May 27, 2008"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Fairly drinkable, overall a good beer. As far as weizenbocks go this is a good one.","Hojaminbag","May 26, 2008"
4.57,15.1,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"750ml bottle poured into a Schneider Weisse glass. Pours a dark brown color with a nice light tan head. The aroma features a lot of banana and clove, wheat, sweet caramel and yeast. I don't think I have ever had a beer that smells so close to actual banana flavors as this one. The taste is sweet with banana and clove along with some spices and some hops in the finish. I am really digging this beer. Pennsylvania Brewing never ceases to amaze me with some of their spot on interpretations of classic German styles. Overall, Pennsylvania Weizenbock is a world class beer that is highly recommended.","cjgator3","May 05, 2008"
3.85,-3,4,4,4,2.5,4,"Still, there are wonderful dark fruity malt flavors mixed with a banana clove blend. The aroma is rich with the malt and yeast character. And the body isnt too thick to stop it from being an easy-drinking beer. Worth a try if you like wheat beers.","tempest","May 05, 2008"
4.37,10.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: I really enjoyed this beer, a good little diamond in my backyard so to speak. For me, its not a session beer, but it is one you should seek out.","IronCitySteve","May 02, 2008"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Amber coloured with a reddish tint and slight haze. The beige head was thick and creamy, had great retention and produced some sticky lacing. Nice aroma - lemon and clove, bananas, quite malty, with grapefruit and tropical fruit too. Same in the flavour for the most part, but with the cloves, grapefruit and malt more pronounced. Solid bitterness also, though it was balanced nicely and stayed in the background. Medium to full bodied with lowish carbonation and a bit of dryness on the palate. The flavour combination seemed a little strange, not your standard weizenbock, but it worked pretty well to make for an interesting pint.","DrJay","Apr 27, 2008"
4.5,13.4,4,4,5,4,4.5,"D: Excellent and will pull for this one anytime. A great creation.","Brianmerrilyn","Apr 11, 2008"
4.4,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4," I love the specialty brews Penn has been releasing lately. I can't wait to try Alt-er ego. Penn brewery makes me proud to be from the burgh.","svcbeerguy","Beers"
4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I had this on tap at CB Six in Manhattan. It was dark brown red color, hazy, with a thin light tan head. The aroma was perfect, fruity and estery, bananas and cloves. The taste was the same, actually very sweet, with some plums and raisins as well. This is a really great weizenbock, I'd like to see it in bottles.","TurdFurgison","0"

4.47,12.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is probably the finest weizenbock I have yet to drink. Its taste and smeel match the profile perfectly. The alcohol is completely hidden and drinkability is excellent. Great job.","tgbljb","May 05, 2007"
4.15,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I love Penn it's the first micro from the Burgh anyone in my parts got their hands on first going back to the days when I felt Penn Pilsner was nectar of the gods. As the years go by and you find yourself trying more micros outside of the area and not visiting Penn Brewing or drinking their beer as often as you once had they do something a little past due...that's innovation. I love the vienna style Penn Pils, the Helles Penn Gold, the German Pils, Kaiser Pils, the dunkel Penn Dark, the hefe Penn Weizen, the Marzen and Ofest. They just brew good beer and drinking beer at that, so why didn't they begin this experimentation stage of bigger beers other than the seasonal Penn Maibock, I can't answer that question. Thank god they did because I've been drinking the Weizenbock since it's been released at Fathead's, Bocktown, Smokin Joe's, and D's it's great. Appears a clouded plum ruddy brown completely opaque the caked yeast floating in a suspension is a site to see, it's complemented by a large tan head leaving bands of thick lacing all around my pint glass. Aroma has deep spiced banana and clove with caramel malts and sweet raisin apple fruit esters and evident alcohol in there. Flavor has sweet over ripened fruit plums, raisins, sticky caramelized banana and clove and mild vanilla traces doughy with the bread mixture definitely like a smoothie in most regards, very nice. Mouthfeel is creamy textured somewhat airy with moderate effervescent carbonation spices tend to stay on the palate. Drinkability is sessionable if you don't believe me come to Bocktown when a group like TRASH aka Three Rivers Alliance of Serious Homebrewers gets together for one of their meetings they definitely felt Penn Weizenbock was sessionable.","WVbeergeek","Apr 09, 2007"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, chewy, estery and yeasty in the mouth. There is a bit of astringency found in there that clings to the cheeks. It finishes spicy, and dry.","weeare138","Apr 06, 2007"
4.27,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: This beer definitely hides it's strength quite well. Yummy.","psinderson","Beers"
