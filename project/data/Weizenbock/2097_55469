3.79,-5,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"the first brew i have had from these guys that didnt absolutely blow me away with quality and originality. not to say it isnt really good, but just that it lacks that oh my goodness element the others have had. its essentially a big strong wit, with all the fruity esters you expect from such a yeast strain, tons of wheat malt body and even sweetness, and then a lemongrassy hop finish thats cool for the style, but lost to the fragrance and potency of the yeast just a bit. its delicate too though for being so robust, its just the sweetness hits a wall mid way, and then the yeast seems naked. the alcohol doesnt show though, making this a dangerously easy drinking brew. i like the belgian intensity, but its not unique from others like it. a well made beer overall with a cool mouthfeel, but maybe a half step behind the best they have to offer.","StonedTrippin","Sep 15, 2014"

3.88,-2.8,3.25,4.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its excellent aroma. While it is quite heavy and fusel from the get go, the sweetness of the malts, and the depth of the spice, keeping it even and nicely balanced throughout. Actually with warmth it even became fruitier, further sweetening any residual bitterness. To compare, the flavoring was also quite nice, but we felt they overdid it a bit in regards to how “Belgian” it was, as we were expecting more of a dirty, unfiltered, American imperial Wit. Instead there were heavier syrups and sugars, and a unmistakably Belgian yeast. This is not to say it wasn’t good, but rather just took us for a bit of a surprise. Additionally, the lack of creaminess and foamy froth made things seem unfinished, as they would have helped soften the edges. Either way, this was a strong, tasty beer, and something you should definitely try if you are a fan of wheat.","TheBrewo","Jul 01, 2013"

3.8,-4.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Served in a tulip glass, a dull golden-orange color, opaque with haze, and a tiny ringlet of head that disappeared completely within seconds. Lots of soft fruit and clovey spice in the nose. Taste is sweet and laden with banana, perhaps more so than I've ever had in a beer, bready yeast, wheat, clove and pepper, light pear and apricot that are mostly eclipsed by the banana, mildly subtle citrus hops in the finish. Smooth and fairly chewy, body is heavier than medium, drinkable, but a bit too sweet for me. Good, but I doubt I could drink more than one of these.","Rifugium","Mar 27, 2012"

4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours out as a cloudy yellowish golden color with a little white head on it. The aromas of malts, fresh grains and some spices. The taste followed through with these same elements. The mouthfeel was pretty good also. The overall view of this beer that I have is that it was good but just didn't spark my interest all that much. My friend brought home a growler her enjoyed it that much. I just wasn't able to get into this one too much, but it was worth trying.","Knapp85","Beers"

3.92,-1.8,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Bottle. Pours a hazed orange amber color with very minimal head. What head I can muster is a off white color. The aroma is sweet with hints of peach, apricot, and pear mixed with some spice notes like spearmint. Medium/light mouthfeel. The taste is way different than I thought it would be with an almost lemon like sourness/tartness. Almost like a lemon smarties. After the tartness subsides a subtle wheat like base pulls through. Some alcohol presence makes itself known as well. Lingering apricot flavor. Very different but very tasty.","kbutler1","May 16, 2010"

3.35,-16,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"I'm not the biggest fan of Weizenbock. The combination of a wheat beer and 9.5% alcohol doesn't work for me. Visually, it was a very light color with a lot of good carbonation. The aroma is very wheat-like and good. Mouthfeel was ok but the alcohol is a little heavy handed which would lower the drinkability for me.","david18","Apr 18, 2010"

Ripe fruit, bananas, creamcicle, honey, light pepper and yeast in the nose. Tasty, zesty, citric, bold, complex weizenbock, more creamcicle notes, ample pepper, loads of ripe tropical fruit, lime, smooth finish.

Fits the style of a Weizenbock. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coriander, orange peel, yeast, slight hop, and herbs.
