"It's an interesting beer—not unpalatable, certainly—but it's a little too much along several axes, and a little not enough along others.  The mouthfeel is somehow both a bit syrupy and a bit thin; the prominence of the chocolate exaggerates as the beer warms and sits with you; and while there is a ""hint of banana from the yeast"" on the nose, there's much more than a hint of the yeast in the beer itself.  Still, Terrapin admits this Side Project (#22) ""is clearly a hoax"" of a rendition of the style, so some deviations are forgivable; nonetheless, it seems ""the addition of cocoa nibs and orange peel for a greater depth of flavor"" failed to actually provide much depth of flavor, beyond big orange and thick cacao notes, so it's hard to be especially enthused about this Moonray."

"O: This was a fairly ugly beer, with tons of yeast floaters. Not a deal-breaker there, but needs to be pointed out. The flavors were decent, but neither the chocolate nor orange had the large presences I expected. It also lacked some of the clean lager flavor appeal that makes the weizenbock a good style. An interesting concept, but I feel like the execution could have been better."

"Overall: a very tasty and pretty unique beer, lots of dark beer character, but still remains light and slightly refreshing. fully captures what it claims to be with good orange and chocolate flavor with the full effect of the weizenbbock. a great intro to the side project series for me."
"Overall a good beer. Good take on a weizenbock."

"O - I was a little doubtful as the Weizenbock is not in my top 10 styles, but adding Orange is an awesome twist with a side of sugar"

"O-Neat concept, but the chocolate and orange don't come through well enough which leaves it a bit too sour for a weizenbock."
""
"Perhaps an odd concept but I've got to give props...the beer is exactly what it says it is. A weizenbock with an orange chocolate character. Intriguing, bold, and tasty!"

"I tried a cask of this beer with vanilla at terrapins anniversary fest and didn't like it all. Tried again on tap a few weeks later and really enjoyed it. It pours orange and is very light in texture. It was very sweet with a strong orange taste until the end where you get the chocolate. It did get a little stale tasting after the finish."

"An interesting experiment and departure from the style that ultimately didn't do it for me. Thin and overly bitter without near enough sweetness to balance."

"Chocolate Orange Weizenbocks aren't really turning out to be the best idea, after all. Stick to the Germans, they won't do you wrong."

"Overall: Reminds me a lot of a cellared Terrapin Gamma Ray. AKA: bananas foster in beer form, but with a touch of coco and orange on the front end."
""
"Not a bad thing in any way but definitely possessive of a clear delineation."
