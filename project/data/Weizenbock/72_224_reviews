review_text
"Bottle from 2005. Oldest beer I ever tried. Pretty good all things considered."
""
"The best Weizenback that I've had."
"Enjoyed with a huge plate of German food. Excellent!"
""
""
"A lovely brown leather color, bronze at the bottom and dark mahogany at the top of a weizen glass.  Tons of tiny, tight bubbles shoot up from the bottom into a large, merengue-like beige-tinted head. Carbonation dominates the thick-and-heavy mouthfeel.  There's a slight sweetness, with some banana, buttered popcorn, berry cobbler and a pepperiness, too.  The alcohol's also very present.  Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm gonna let the superlatives fly. This is an amazing beer, despite its seeming simplicity. Incredible balance between all the flavors, and while it is decidedly sweet, I think it could find an audience among a wide range of beer drinkers. Ambrosia in a bottle."
""
"Pours a caramel color with a white head.  Aroma of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, banana and clove.  In the taste, wood tone, rooty hop profile does a fair job at balancing the caramelized malt, bread and clove notes.  Slight alcohol but good balance.  Full bodied, well carbonated brew.  This is a classic weizenbock, the quintessential."
""
""
""
"Reminds me of a wheat quad. I really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- World Class, drink at every opportunity."
""
""
"Overall: This is just an outstanding beer. It seems to be available more often locally now, for the price, this is one kick-ass beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Other than the heavy sediment, which may have been due to the bottle not being stored upright , it was a enjoyable beverage. Should have picked up a current version to do a side by side."
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent and classic German bock.  The wheat provides nice body and flavor.  Easy to drink and the 8.2% abv is very well hidden."
""
""
"Overall:  This is one of the first weizenbocks that I've tried, and I'm very impressed.  Watch out for the wallop of alcohol!"
""
""
""
""
""
"From the bottle poured into weizen glass. Appearance is cloudy medium brown that rises slowly from off-white foam that fills the glass. Some patches of lace stick to the glass. Aroma is bubblegum, clove, banana, raisin, roasted wheat malt, and a whiff of alcohol. Taste is dominated by fruity sweetness coming from the malt and banana, apple, raisin, and tropical fruit esters. The sweetness is complimented by the spicy clove and anise flavors. A fuzz of alcohol in the swallow. On the high end of medium bodied, creamy and thick texture, lots of carbonation, sweet estery finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a great tasting beer."
""
"Look: clear, dark brown, good head retention fluffy head, medium carbonation. Aroma: dark stone fruit with a grainy malt aroma. Burnt caramel, toasty malts. There is a bananas fosters aroma. Some alcohol aroma. Flavor: extra ripe stone fruit some alcohol, mild hops. Roasty and caramelized malts. Feel: medium plus body, lively carbonation. Overall this is a delicious and perfect example of this style of beer."
""
"This was an impressive and very drinkable doppelbock/weizenbock. Very well rounded and very well executed. Definitely world-class. Looking forward to more from this brewery!"
""
"Bottle of Schneider aventinus drank."
""
""
"One of my favorite beers ever since I first tried it over 10 years ago.  There's no excuse for me not drinking this more often -- it's widely available and reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer, it's like a cross between a dubbel (some dark sugar taste), a tripel (banana), and a wheat.  That combination sounds weird on paper, but it works wonderfully.  This is one of the best beers I've ever had.  (I've had it on tap as well; it's even better in that format.)"
""
"Taste: Full-bodied, caramel, slightly licorice. aftertaste is almost like crown royal."
""
""
"Such an amazing beer. Perfectly balanced. Great flavor profile and it packs a really nice subtle punch too."
""
""
"Strong weizen beer, good taste"
""
""
""
""
"80/100"
""
""
"Caramel smell. Intense taste. Brown and weiss mix taste. Almost sweet but not. Very nice and interesting  beer to try. Love it."
""
"Enjoyed on tap in the Schneider beer hall in Munich.  Best beer I drank while in Bavaria!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor profile is World Class - intense, complex and perfectly balanced.  It begins with a burst of raisin and plum that slowly yield to chocolate notes over a surprisingly subtle caramel sweetness.  The middle effervesces into a burst of banana and clove.  As these flavors fade, a subtle bitterness emerges as does a hint of alcohol.  The finish is a slow fade with notes of bitter chocolate."
""
""
""
"O: enjoyable; I expected a dark fruit character; also didn't get the bready profile common in the style;"
""
"overall - love it, recommend it, awesome beer"
""
""
""
"More pronounced alcohol notes in the aroma and taste - this is phenolic and estery, boasting a ton of allspice, clove, and aged/bruised apple and pear, lower levels of banana.  Consistent with the color, there is a mild roastiness dialing back the malty sweetness.  No hop aroma or flavor discernible. Well-carbonated."
"Served on tap into a small 6oz 'lady' glass (kind of a tiny tulip thing). Deep brown with ruby around the edges and a 1/2 finger of eggshell head that held pretty tight. Had some notes reminiscent of my experiences with tripels. Got some distinct notes of licorice, clove, and dark fruit on the nose. Ripe banana, clove on the palate. Extremely fresh tasting. Medium mouthfeel. Just as clean, and crisp as can be. Great beer experience."
"O = I prefer Vitus to this, in all honesty, but this version of a weizenbock is definitely a better option for cold weather, with it's darker character and higher alcohol.  Recommended!"
"Heavenly. This beer and brewery on top of my favorites list."
""
""
"Pours a big foamy head which rests nicely; colours is a dark dark brown. Smell of prune and alight alcohol makes this roving without being too sweet."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"In the running for my favorite beer in the world. Definitely my favorite in the style."
""
""
""
"My every night go to."
"Unreal brew which shows great mastery."
""
""
""
""
"An incredible beer for the category with a slight fruit taste and creamy feel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall : Absolutely delicious! Very complex and one of my favorite beer ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
"O:  I love this style ... I don't know much about it, but this brew in particular is very sweet, strong in ABV but easy to drink with all the alcohol hidden, lots of darker fruit tastes; only the slight sourness in the nose tips off the wheat, otherwise it comes off like a really good Belgian dubbel ... fantastic beer"
""
"Medium brown with nice head. A little sweetness in taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding flavor. Look, smell, taste & feel is what a great beer should be.  Fantastic & highly recommended.  Needs to be in the ""World Class"" league."

"I love this beer.  Easily the best German beer I've had yet.  It reminds me somewhat of a very good Trappist dubbel.  Outstanding."

"When wanting to put some work into my overall alcohol resistance Aventinus is my go to man. Smooth and delicious, I'll savour him 'til the last drop."

"This is a great beer. I have to drink these occasionally to remind myself that there is more to beers than hops and coffee stouts. It is almost sad to realize that no American brewery could replicate this taste. I rate this among some of the best beers created. Its not barrel-aged or hop forward, but it's delicious and subtle, which I have yet to find in American beer."

"I prefer Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock.  In addition to tasting better, Celebrator also has that tassle-y thing attached to the neck of the bottle... CLASS"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very flavorful and expressive, strong but not overwhelming. Instead of being merely a weizen with more alcohol, the typically sweet bubblegum and banana flavors are subdued while the spiciness, dark fruitiness, and rich malt take center stage, making it reminiscent of a Belgian dark strong with more clove and frothier carbonation."
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, it is warming a bread like, great for a cold day."
"O: A phenomenal weizenbock, managing to keep the focus on sweetness, malt, and fruit flavors, without much of a noticeable hop presence. In a straight comparison, I'd choose the eisbock version every time, but that is an entirely different category of beer."
""
""
"Excellent, refreshing beginning, supported by banana, malts and a fitting, high carbonation. Decent complexity, malt gives this a medium-body, with a spicy, warm, slightly alcoholic addition and a long honeyed finish with hints of metallic carbonation. Slick, oily and pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. Aftertaste is sweet with toffee and bready malts, convert to a warming feeling in the stomach. Yeast does a lot of work here, without creating the usual ""Weizen"" impression. This is a warming and refreshing beer at the same time, with a great fruity body, completed by spices and a pleasant sweet finish."

""

"O - This is a great beer that keeps its bigness well managed and controlled.  Another example of how German beers deliver."

"Overall - I get the felling I am going to crave this on a warm Fall or Spring day in CO; really good beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Good brew! Smooth, low IBU, dark fruits, wheat, banana, spices. This was different than the Ayinger weizenbock that I've had. Beeradvocate lists this as a ""weizenbock"" but they take different approaches to the style. Excuse my memory, but the Ayinger version seemed more what I would imagine a weizenbock to taste like. This reminded me much more of a dopplebock. While I will certainly drink a dopplebock, it isn't my favorite German style (although my second highest reviewed beer is a dopplebock... go figure). If I were to compare this to Ayinger's dopplebock: ""Celebrator"" I'd have to rate this one below that beer. Celebrator is at the top of the charts. This Schneider seems like a hybrid weizenbock and dopplebock together. I can respect that. It's tough for me because I'm not sure what I should review this as. A Weizenbock, a dopplebock, or just the pure enjoyment of the beer. The thing that this beer has going for it is that it seems like a dopplebock you can enjoy all year round. Celebrator is one of those beers you enjoy during the cold months. Its meant to be drank at a warmer temperature. This one seems like it would work even during warm days because its like it is asking to be drank at a cooler temperature. idk, just my take on this beer. Good stuff!"

"A very nice creamy banana nut flavor that finishes sweet and balanced.  It will warm you up.  Sweet, yet very drinkable."
""
"Very easy drinking for this level of ABV.  No afterburn at all.  This one half-threatens to be cloying, but the sweetness stops short of being overbearing.  I do like this one.  I've  had some other beers from this brewery, and I have yet to be truly disappointed by one of their offerings.    I'd grab another one of these for sure."

"43/50"
"Overall - This beer is an absolutely masterpiece. It is practically liquid spiced banana bread! It's a marvel that the 8.2% ABV is so well integrated, and this beer comes off as so crisp, refreshing, and drinkable still - dangerously drinkable. Truly a world class beer that I very much enjoyed."
""
""

"O -  Easy to drink for 8.2% abv and pretty damn tasty."

"Full-bodied fragrance with notes of banana and yeast. The flavor is also dominated also by some banana but with malt tones. A very well made weizendoppelbock."
""
""
""
"O-I don't have many points of comparison here.  However, I used to call this my favorite before switching to craft hop bombs.  It's nice to come back around."

"O- A very nice beer for the style. Big flavor, lots of flavor and sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is full on malt bomb up front with some nutty wheat notes rounding to a nice dry red wine like finish. A nice oak and herb bitterness to balance with plum and raisin coming through occasionally with cranberry as well. A very nice evening sipper."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark ruby color, the color of a British style porter, around 30 to 40 SRM, with a thick, white, long-lasting head and plenty of yeast in suspension. Creamy mouthfeel. Rich, malty sweetness with a mildly tart finish. Aromas of clove and grapes and berries. No hop aroma, mild to no hop bitterness, mild to no alcohol. This is the benchmark for a wheat dopplebock. Rich, complex and fruity."

"Pours a light brown body the color of light cola; head starts thick but disappears in the blink of an eye. Dark plums and molasses are in the aroma. Flavor is a shell of what it could be but there are glimpses of what i know this beer is. Little carbonation and a bit of oxidation finish things off. Nice marketing ploy by the brewery but this should not be aged so long IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent look, but it's the very unique and powerful aroma that immediately draws you into this beer at first. And then the rich, powerful flavors grab a hold of you and won't let you go. The flavors are deep and complex, very intriguing with wild zig-zags of sugary sweet surprises all tempered with a tempered boozy edge and and most sublime bit of hop bitterness to temper the sweet peaks. The wheat really adds a nice fruity character to things. A nice hyper-hefeweizen/doppelbock synthesis."

"I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about this beer. It looks like Coke, which isn't really all that appealing if you ask me. The smell is ok - at least it doesn't smell like Coke too. Taste is actually quite good. An interesting malt combination with a lot of alcohol. Great mouthfeel as well. Overall, not bad, but I'm not sure about a 'world class' rating."

"On the initial pour a very large fizzy head was observed (> 10 cm) which rapidly fizzed itself down to 4 cm. After that the head was stable. The pour can be scary – medium brown with tons of sediment flowing by – the yeast no doubt. A decent beer but not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my first and probably not my last time trying this one. It's in a class all it's own, as such it's hard to compare. A quality beer at a decent price, try it if you haven't already."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty brew, but just not light enough to fill the classic Summer role of a Hefe, and not thick or roasty enough to fill the nightcap role of a regular doppelbock. Nice beer, but it just doesn't quite fit into any category I love."
""
""
""
""
""
"I hate to do this. BUT SOUR beers shouldn't be considered a beer. MAN these beers run right through me LOL!!! I can never put a sour beer in the top 250 beer list. I think the best part of this beer is the label. No offense but I hate sour beers. Doesn't work for me. Sorry..This isn't an attempted to lower the rating but I have to give my rating good or bad."
""
""
""
"One of those ""perfect"" brews you encounter. Fruity yeasty punch to the face with a subtle alcohol ester present and creamy lingering head. Drank this beer with some foie gras spread on a crusty sourdough resulting in a delicious paring, perfect on a warm overcast day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Impressive hybrid of a beer."

"O - Fantastic weizenbock. The darker malts give an interesting edge to a German wheat beer. Drinks surprisingly easy for the ABV. The moderate sweetness makes it equally appropriate for enjoying on your deck on a summer afternoon or sipping by a fire during on a winter eve."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very smooth, dark-style beer. The bitterness I normally enjoy in a beer is nicely replaced with a bite of alcohol and presumably carbonation. I expected a well-balanced beer when I saw the rating, and I wasn't disappointed."

" Overall an outstanding 4 for my first weizenbock. I really the fact I couldn't much pick up the higher ABV when it came to the literal act of drinking this. But this is sure a creeper type of beer& a keeper too. I will certainly buy this brew again!"
""
""
""
"I've not been a fan of the weizenbocks until now, this is packed with flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I definitely picked the right beer. It's a great sipper and/or gulper. Lasts a long time without any kind of degrading. Refreshing, but with a little tang. Leaves me wanting more."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer. One that I've found strange - lots of Belgian dubbel characteristics, but the wheat malts definitely show up in the flavor. But quite enjoyable."
""
"Enjoy"

"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy chocolate brown pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and great lacing. Big malty, bready nose with hints of banana, cloves, chocolate, dark fruits, brown sugar, licorice, and caramel. The taste is rich and bold with tons of malty sweet brown bread. banana, plums, caramel, cloves, tobacco, chocolate, anise, apple skin, and some nice subtle citrus hop notes. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with prickly carbonation and a creamy and slightly oily finish. Overall, another great offering from Schneider Weisse. Kicking myself for living in Germany all these years and not giving Weizens a second chance. Will definitely have this stocked in my beer fridge in the future!"

"Fantastic banana clove spiced weizenbock!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a great beer. Heavy and perfect for sipping on slowly. A really good example of a German style."
"My favorite German beer as its filled with flavor. Somehow, that makes me want to analogize this beer as a ""German DIPA."" Similar to a  DIPA with clean, slightly malty, filled with fruit flavor, medium creamy mouthfeel, clean finish."
""
""
""
""
"I'm a fan and always will be. The beer is smooth, completely free of any hints of alcohol and offers a thick, creamy mouthfeel. It does drink like a meal. I'd skip plenty of meals to drink this with that in mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is dark murky brown with an extremely tight light tan head. Nose is estery with notes of banana and lemon. There is a faint tangy yeast and some dark berries behind. Taste has a touch of dark malt to it, bright esters of lemon and banana with more peppery spice and stronger berry fruitiness. Carbonation is strong with a lighter body and dry finish."

"O: Amazing World class brew."

"Summary: This beer packs a flavorful punch. It can almost be described as rich. Yet you cannot taste a bit of the alcohol. There's a definite sweetness. Again, not the most attractive looking of brews, but its drinkability makes that easy to forgive. It's smell is not strong, but very pleasant with sort of a combination of raisins, cloves and bananas? (I am just terrible at describing beer odors.) The glass I am using could be withholding some of its aromas. I may be writing sacrilegious nonsense, but this reminds me of the Rochefort 8 and I like this better. I recently had a Spencer Trappist Ale (see my review from yesterday) and I can draw comparisons between that beer's smell and taste to this Aventinus. There is an excellent finish with a very nice aftertaste. This is a great beer, but it is probably even better in the right glass with a slower pour and a more educated beer drinker."
""
""
"O: Wow. Perfect appearance, excellent mouthfeel, and I really enjoyed the ripe banana and syrupy wet walnut tandem. If not my new favorite, it is among the top tier."
""
""
""
"O: this is just a great beer. When I'm in a German mood, I go to this or Vitus. It's almost perfect for the style and so refreshing and full of flavors."
""
"pours a dark sludgy brown. sewage color with a creamy khaki head. aroma is bready, hint of chocolate, banana, hint of hay. body has a smooth texture with a ton of bite but its pleasant. good amount of carbonation, a little sweetness , grape, hint of vanilla, and ton of spice"

"O – I’ve drunk this beer at least an order of magnitude more than any other beer on the planet. At university I’d routinely drink 2-3 of these bad boys when I’d sit down to write an essay. This beer made a significant contribution towards my graduating from that institution. Tap 6 Aventinus will always be a special beer for me and as such it’s hard for me to separate my assessment of this beer as a beer from the many happy memories it has provided me with and long nights it has accompanied me on. Funnily enough I started drinking it for purely pragmatic reasons; it provided the best balance between affordability, flavour and high abv., but over time I really started to appreciate it for the classic brew that it is."
""
""
""
"Due to high abv. and sugar content it gets fast to the head."
""
""
"Overall: Delicious strong dark wheat beer. Really excellent, and a perfect exemplar of the fact that not all excellent beer is hoppy, barrel-aged, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly better than the usual TAP 6, but, for me, it doesn't surpass the eisbock. A really great weizenbock tho."

"Pours a dark hazy 'ice tea' in color with a good 1-finger+ foamy off-white head that lasts a long time. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of sweet grains, dark fruit and wheat toast. The taste is even better! Wow! What a fantastic brew! Super smooth and goes down easy with NO harsh or bitter aftertaste at all! Perfect carbonation as well. Love this one!"
"O - Every aspect f this beer is spot-on. A true world classic."

"O) Truly a masterpiece, a fine example of its category"

"An excellent wheat beer and very much worth a try if you want to explore the style. Wheat beers are harder for me to like sometimes, but this one is a winner. I bought the bottle for approximately 3.75, which strikes me as very reasonable. Only one store in my town of approximately 30,000 people stocks this beer. I wish Albertsons would get rid of a display case of AB product and substitute some decent imports and craft brews."

"O - Aventinus is the original weizenbock, brewed in 1907 and still king of the style to this day. It's robust German hefe aroma is perfectly paired with the bready malt profile of a doppelbock for a hybrid style that is a blissful marriage of soft and drinkable wheat with filling and complex maltiness. Like a dense loaf of Banana bread made with nuts and chocolate chips, Aventinus is soft and smooth but rich and filling with a fantastic silky, creamy finish!"

""

"Overall- One of the best offerings in that style in the world a world class beer anyone should try its one of my favorites"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pinnacle of weizenbock style. Hard to imagine anything better. Complex, balanced, fuck yea."
""
""
"O- Very flavorful. I like the added roast characteristics of this one. Alcohol is apparent, though."
""
""
"I have to say right off the bat that this is possibly one of the best beers that I have ever had. I poured the bottle into a weizen glass and it appeared a nice dark brown color that produced an off-white/tan-ish colored, rocky, dense head that was very well retained. Loads of carbonation. The aroma was a wheat and some other spice or aroma that I could not pin down, but whatever it was really made the beer. The taste followed the nose perfectly and was followed by a nice sweet finish. If there is a better tasting beer for this style, I would be shocked. The beer had a medium body to it, it was extremely smooth, and had excellent carbonation. The only downside was that I did not have another bottle. As I said before, this may be one of the best beers that I have had, of any style. Outstanding and a must try for any BA."

"Edit - Had this on draft last night, was absolutely incredible. Poured a cloudy, light amber brown into a tulip glass. The mouthfeel was vastly improved, and there were some nice estery notes at the end. Much less sweet than I remembered, incredibly balanced, very little alcohol taste. I'll be hard pressed to not order this every time I see it on draft."

"Enjoyed a half-liter bottle on a cold winter's night. Why do I drink so much wheat beer in the winter? Denial? Anyhow, this particular selection fits the bill nicely. Pours up a beautiful reddish brown murk with ample light tan foam. Aroma grabs you by the olfactory bulbs with sweet brown apple, poached pears, molasses, caramelized bananas, and ample spice. The aroma is just a prelude. Palate is rich, full, sweet, and complex, with a ton of clove and cassia spice phenolics like its lighter Schneider weisse cousins (albeit on steroids), rich toffee, the aforementioned caramelized bananas, dates and plums, and a little wood or dry cacao powder to provide some bitterness. Chewy syrupy body stands out but the spicy punch prevents things from being overbearingly saccharine and I can certainly understand the comparisons to a Belgian dark ale. After a while all the spicy notes get earthy and bitter. Nevertheless, still has that wheaty refreshing character that you get from the best weizens. Another great ""dessert beer", like Christmas cake in a bottle except infinitely better than the brick-hard shit that hides in your grandma's deep freeze. A world-class brew and I don't think the high ratings I have provided are too generous. If you are interested in more background info about this beer, read ""Brewing With Wheat"" by Stan Hieronymus. There are tech specs in there for this beer and Tap 7. Old school stuff."

"One of those few beers that stays on your tongue for hours after you finish it. In fact, while I have only had it a few times, I can almost recall the flavors at will. I have had it on tap and in the bottle. I would not worry too much about the freshness factor. The bottle I had was nearing its best by date and was still amazing."

"Had out of a bottle at do brassiere in Albany. Awesome. First of all haven't had a bock in awhile and although not my favorite I went due to the high rating. The ruby red color and little head was different. This smelled so fruity I was surprised. Had Belgium all over it which is great. It is a yeasty malty wheat beer with the perfect blend of fruit. This doesn't seem to be the bock I am used to. I love this beer. Perfect"
""
""
""
""
"o: Described as a wheat dopplebock, this is more dark fruit-yeast dominated than I had expected. Won't buy it again because dark fruit (prunes, plums and such) is not a personal favorite flavor in beer, and this was not cheap at $6 a pint. Nonetheless it was nice to try to get an idea of why it is #101 on the BA top 250."
""

"Not my favorite style by any means, but that’s still an incredibly good beer."

"O: This is a great beer plain and simple. Love the mixture of all of the flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Looks like root beer with a little cream in it. Smells like a spice that I can't identify. Might be cloves or sassafras. Mouth feel is medium. Fully engages the taste buds. Salivary glands say pungent in the best possible way. This could be one of the best beers tasted yet. Tap #6 is a beer I'll always be happy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky amber-brown color with a big white head that fades fairly slowly. Smell is toffee, dark fruits, carmel, bananas and cloves. Taste is slightly similar to a hefenweizen. Slightly sweet with some of the wheat and the flavors in the nose. Medium to light mouthfeel with decent carbonation, very smooth. Overall a great beer worth trying."

"This one was a winner, enjoyed it a lot. A good malty wheat beer for a nightcap."

""
""

"Multiple tap pours and 500mL bottles. Pours a muddy brown with a huge tan head with great lacing and retention. Aromas of cloves, yeast, black cherries, milk chocolate, and dunkelweizen banana split with chocolate drizzle. Taste is dark cherry dessert, milk chocolate, banana, mild alcohol sweetness. Really good- classically the richest wheat beer around."

"This beer goes down easy and is clearly the best dark wheat beer I've had. It has little carbonation notes on the tounge with a full caramel and dark fruit taste that is nicely balanced and not overly sweet like most doppelbocks."

"O - i love wheat beers! i'm usually a bigger fan of the typical hefeweizen, but i do like to try some of the darker wheat beers. after weihenstephaner dunkel, this is the best dark wheat beer ive ever tried. i could enjoy this beer all year round and i can see it pairing great with a steak on the grill. it was hard to keep this one in my glass and as i was so pleasantly surprised by it, I am planning a trip back to the LCBO to buy another few bottles for the weekend. If you like wheat beers or dark beers or any kind of beer of quality...get this beer."

"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, bottled on 9/22/2012. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, banana, clove, toast, raisin, prune, toffee, brown bread, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, banana, clove, toast, raisin, prune, pepper, brown bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy pepper/clove spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, banana, clove, toast, raisin, prune, brown bread, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely incredible balance and complexity of malt, yeast ester, and hop flavors; with an awesome malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and smooth mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Weizenbock! Big complexity and great balance of malt, yeast, and hop flavors; and super smooth to drink for 8.2%. Amazing."

"Overall, as stated right off. This fine weizenbock is a cornerstone. It is a beast, it is great. If you have been skeptical of German beers, if you think they are predictable and ho-hum, if you just haven't had it... Buy it if you see it, you won't be sorry. I haven't been ever since the first one I had years ago."

"O- My 1st weizenbock, and it's a dandy. Certainly world class."
""

"Taste-Where to begin? A flavor meld of clove, banana, blueberry, dark malt, grapeskin, milk chocolate shavings. Fruity, tangy, each sip a different flavor combination. Upon warming a bit I get bluberry pancakes with light syrup, dark fruits and dark bread, bread pudding with raisins. A complex, flavorfull, mysterious brew that must be experienced. Excellent."

"O: I'm somewhat disappointed I couldn't seem to like this beer as much as other people seem too but none the less it was a good beer. It was my first wiezenbock it was just okay but nothing astounding in my opinion. I probably will revisit it again in the future to see if my tastes for it have changed. Just not exactly to my liking but decent beer I suppose."

"O-This is a great beer that I wish I could find more often. There is something odd about the mix of chocolate and wheat flavors that really works well here and makes for a good summer beer, even at 8.2 % ABV. This is my favorite of beer of this style by far."

It has a very dark look to it, wonderful body, great head when you pour it in a glass. To me, it's pretty much the perfect beer. Put this one on your bucket list of beers to try, and taste what perfection really is."

"O - Best wheat beer I've ever had. Best German beer I've ever had. Best lager I've ever had. Really the only downside is the alcohol is too high to make it sessionable (although I know that's a positive for some folks)."

"This is definitely one of the most complex, mass-produced recipes out of Germany, and it's clear where it gets its praise from. Tons of well balanced, juicy flavors, and delicious bready and yeasty characteristics that further enhance them. Absolutely an easy beer to drink with its crisp, smoothened body, and at 8.2%, a dangerous choice at that. This is definitely something I'll treat myself more often to from time to time. Fantastic stuff."
"Overall: One of the best beers I had during my stay in Germany, and one I have returned to many times since. A must-try, and gold-standard for Weizenbocks."

"I love this beer. You pop the cap and get this amazing banana smell, it pours like a picture of what a perfect beer should look like. Great color, cloudy unfiltered liquid bread. Take your first sip expecting it to be very heavy, while the flavor definitely socks you in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to drink, which at 8.2% can be a bit precarious. Have a driver or better yet, stay home. This beer is a great way to end a day."

"overall: To me this tastes like a trappist beer from Belgium, mixed with a Dunkelweizen. Decent brew but not really my cup of tea, it tries to be too many things at once. I would rather have a Franziskaner Dunkelweiss or Rochefort if you want something similar but a little more drinkable. May get more in the future to try again, but as of now I prefer their hefe."

"The guy that calls this beer, ""the best beer ever"" must not have a very refined palate. It's good, but it is by no means the best beer in the world. Actually, the best beer in the world, according to RateBeer, isn't even that good. Cool story, but quads are just not my style. They did a good job with this bottle, and I am going to look at where those plum flavors are coming from. Best part of this offering. Cheers!"

"Overall. Very easy drinking and plenty of flavour. Quite tasty and I can see how so many people love this, even though it's not my favorite style."
"This beer is a long time favorite. Recently re-tried for reviewing purposes. The appearance is wonderful; nice dark caramel in color, with a retentive whiteish/cream head. Smell is wonderful, clean, earthy, lightly spiced with clove. Taste is delicious! I get clove, sweet malt, a slight licorice flavor, and a sweet yeasty type note as well. The feel of the beer in my mouth is what I remember liking most about this beer. It's very creamy and light, and leaves a smooth silty finish. The aftertaste is of ripe banana, yum."
"Pours a murky reddish amber, with a layer of creamy off white head, good retention. The smell contains some dark fruit, bready malt, and a mild brown sugar sweetness. The taste is malty but not overly sweet with some yeast spice, a touch of booze, dark fruit, and some banana."

"p.s. As I swallow each mouth-full of this beer, I get pungent mouth-fulls of 'Christmas spicy flavours' running over the palette... This really is something special! One week left in Germany before I return to Asia: Note to Self - Must go to beer-shop tomorrow and get a few more of these in!"

"What a wonderfully complex beer. My only complaint is that it's a bit sweet and could use a bit more tartness. Nevertheless, I feel as if I could spend hours sipping on it and writing down all the different flavors I encounter. If all you drink are stouts and IPAs, you need to start exploring classic beers like this one. Pick up a bottle, close your eyes, tune out the noise, and just sip and enjoy."

"O - This is a world class beer, I can't imagine a better weizenbock. Just so rich, sweet, and creamy but somehow its beyond drinkable. Man I love this beer!"

"Few beers have blown me away as this has. In 30+ years of beer drinking this is my holy grail. Bread and fruit in the most amazing combination, maybe a touch of spice and toffee. I really can not add anything that hasn't already been said by others that have appreciated the beer's amazing qualities. If you are a fan of this style you owe it to yourself to try it. Definitely Wold Class."
"O: An excellent example of the style. Very malt forward, and pretty tasty and drinkable for the level of malts. I can see this pairing with heartier foods or maybe dessert."
"you know, because of the ratings I had higher hopes for this. its good, but it isn't standout to me from other big wheaty bocks. the pour is the best asset. its dark caramel in color with a lavish off white head thick as whipped cream and lasting forever, way above the rim, pure sex. the nose is real fruity, like apples and pears and grapes, and of course dark malted wheat and german ale yeast. flavor sees a lot less fruit than the nose, it has an almost rotting fruit taste, composty, with a lot of alcohol for the style. the alcohol is long lasting and in fact dramatic when it warms, a detractor in this context. the yeast imparts a lot of nice flavor, a little banana, a touch of peppery spice, and plenty of body. fuller, with excited carbonation and a long fruitcake finish. overall a tasty beer, and a good step in my new german beer interest, but I think its a touch out of balance, not least because of the robust booze vibe. well made but not my personal first choice."

"Aventinus is an excellent wheat bock that's worthy of the praise it receives. Among the few dark wheat beers I've had to date, it stands above the rest."

"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of dark citrus, wheat, sweet malt, slight hops, hint of pale malt, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of a Weizenbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dark citrus, wheat, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hops, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, decent appearance, great aroma and body, and good feel and blend."
""
"Hm, I still think I prefer Weihenstephaner Vitus to this beer, but there's no denying that this is still some good stuff. I don't know if I'm well-versed enough in weizenbocks to accurately rank this one among the rest, but it was definitely tasty, and dangerously drinkable for being 8.2% ABV."
""
"Murky brown out of the bottle. Thin persistent head. Raisins, dates and alcohol aromas apparent. Tobacco, cloves, raisins flavors come through. Rather sharp fizziness to it, some alcohol warming. Easy to drink, full of complex flavors- definitely something to enjoy with cheese on a cold rainy day."

"O: The taste and mouthfeel were similar our of both glasses; overall I would recommend the weizen glass over the flute just because the wider mouth allows for more aromatics and the larger volume allowed for more of a pour to get a bigger head.

"i get a strong 'banana' taste, which is something i've never understood in others' reviews before. the color and look of the brew is is awesome- ""hearty"" sums it up well. if i had to desire something more in the appearance, it would be a tad more foam. the 'charcoal' aroma is gone and i get some of that 'banana' in the smell, which isnt sweet, but definitely distinct. i suppose i am re-hashing the traits because i am leading up to giving this one a 5- almost straight across the board. i'll get a few more later and re-sample for posterity sake. and because i want to be accurate. but this one is simply delightful, yet serious. so, for my favorite in england/scotland it is belhaven wee heavy. for belgium it is st bernardus tripel. and while i have had an eternal love affair with most things german, i have to say that, since reviewing ro BA, this one tops my list. lots of great brews from germany/austria but this one inches a nose above. i can justify the 5 for smell now- my sniffer was a little off at the beginning."

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of the style, this is by far the best German Weizenbock I have had so far, it's very good. This beer had good drinkability to it, it was smooth, with lots of nice flavors to hold my attention, but it's a little on the sweet side so I think one 500ml bottle is the perfect amount. What I liked the most about this beer was everything, all aspects of this beer were right were they should be and done very well. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of single thing that I didn't like about this beer. I would for sure buy this beer again when in the mood for a really good Weizenbock and I highly recommend this beer to everyone. All in all I was very happy and impressed with this beer, it's the German Weizenbock I've been searching for and I'm glad I finally found it. I still think I like Black Forests Weizenbock just a little more, but for being available year round and I'm sure this will be my go to Weizenbock. I can't say enough good things about this beer, it was very good and everybody should try it, enough said."

"I got this one on tap as soon as I heard the local Flying Saucer had it in stock. And it was a very good beer. But the reason I wanted it so bad was to try the original German version of Texas's Live Oak Primus. Don't get me wrong. Aventinus was good, but not nearly as good as Primus. It had a staleness to it. It didn't taste as alive and primal as Primus. It was therefore more boring. It had a good mustiness to it, but not much accompanying banana flavour that I liked so much about Live Oak's weizenbock. Still a very decent beer, though. I'll probably have it again one day. But I'm in no rush."

"Exceptionally smooth, very dark brown and intensely malty with a sweetness and fruitiness that makes it seem almost like a Belgian Doppelbock. Actually, it is a weizendoppelbock rather than simply a weizenbock. Abundant apples, pears and banana in aroma and taste. Slight acidic twang mixed with the sweet roasted malt finishes it off perfectly. Cloudy and complex yet very drinkable and goes well with food. One of the best Bavarian beers available in bottles in the US it is a must try."

"Pours cloudy brownish with small white head. Smells of banana, yeast funk, pears. Taste is like pear juice and cinnamon spice. Sweet but subdued. Nice wheat flavor in this with a bit of spice. The spice and fruit allow this to finish with a smooth sweetness on the palate, and crisp enough to make very drinkable. Very nice beer, and my first of the style."

"O: Overall I really enjoyed the beer. I thought it was nice and mellow with a lot of flavor. It's one of the few beers I've had from Schneider Weisse that still tastes very good when imported...if not the only. I would drink it again, but I would love to try it on tap."

"O - A true standard bearer for the style, and very enjoyable. It's complex in nature but balanced perfectly. Way too easy too drink for the ABV. It could be dangerous!"

"Had at Andreas Keller in Leavenworth, WA. Pours a dark amber brown with a huge foamy tan head. Fruity aroma with slight smell of banana perhaps, was hard to place. Surprised by the tartness of this beer though I enjoyed it. Slight sour apple notes. Full body, a lot of carbonation and very warming. Great beer."
"A delicious brew, warming and flavorful. Expected a little more malt presence, but the esters are delicious."
""
""
"O- a very easy review and a no brainer, 4.5 all day. It fits the description of a weizenbock perfectly. The only flaw i can think of is strictly personal preference and no fault of the brewer (though the label say banana so maybe it is) this has more of a bubblegum aroma/flavor and i love a banana aroma/flavor. Either way its awesome and i highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not an every-day beer; this is one for special occasions. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Although it married well with a plate of Currywurst & Spaetzle, I enjoyed it more after the meal, when I could focus on its flavors without distraction."
"Overall, one of the best beers I've ever tried. I recommend this to anyone, fan of weizen or not."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I do not drink this style often to be honest but this was a great experience. The complexity and balance of this beer is incredible and I hope to have it again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Would purchase again and recommend to others. It tastes like a Hefeweizen's darker, older brother."
"EDIT: Had 2003 vintage on 1/16/2013. Smooth, much lighter than fresh. Good with food. Not nearly as banana-y :) new vintage, but still good. Try it. 4.2."
""
""
"Recommended, almost as much as the Eisbock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow. This was impressive. I could drink this all night. Delicious, so creamy smooth on the palate... A real treat. So glad I tried one - a must have for BA's, regardless of style preferences."

"Delicious."
"2006 Vintage wrapped in paper! Served from bottle into an Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock semi-frosted weizen glass. Poured a dark red brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, banana, spices, milk chocolate, and sweet fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, dark fruit, milk chocolate, spices, banana, fruit, grain, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The age really did a lot of good stuff for this one if I am honest. The flavors were quite complex and the aroma had really developed into something special. The alcohol aspect was completely gone and made this one really easy drinking for something with this ABV. I suggest setting a few of these aside to age in your cellar if you have the patience as this one was awesome at 6 years old."

"No where do you taste alcohol because is is such a complex beer.Caramel,banana's cloves,maltiness, tons of yeast and some chocolate,what a beer!"

"Yes, deserving of your original 4.5 rating.  A swarm of flavor, sweetened oatmeal, with red wine on the cleansing back-end."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is one tasty and very drinkable brew. It is renowned for a reason. Very well done. Tons of great flavor and an overall joy to drink."
""
"O: A well balanced, tasty, uncharacteristically refreshing beer that's comparable to Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier but with a bigger alcohol kick. Looks dark, tastes light. Nice. Definitely can't beat the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Does not have the bitter bite of some other high percentage beers."
""
""
""
"O: This is an amazing beer. It has the best of 2 worlds and it's a go to in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a damned good beer. I'm warming up to the Germans. Fairly inexpensive and packs a good punch, along with a lot of flavor. Heck of an offering."
"Lots of flavor. Nice complexity but it doesn't hold up in the long run. A bit too much with some lacking warm depth. Still worth drinking and trying. A great testament to the style."
"O: Flavorful and drinkable. Some weizenbocks I've had have been too dry and overattenuated, but this has a nice balanced sweetness to it. Great weizenbock."
"Aventinus pours out a muddy brown color with a small white head. The aroma is yeasty and wheaty, with caramel malts. The taste is just fantastic. The caramel malts provide the right amount of balance to the banana-y yeast that overwhelms me in so many other beers. The wheat rounds out everything. A masterful composition. The mouthfeel is lighter and tingly, and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is a fantastic widely available and cheap beer. Highly recommended."
"O - The appearance of this beer let me down, a gentle pour left me with no head whatsoever, but this style should be billowing with carbonation. The smell definitely showed off a nice ester profile and left room for some malt to shine through. There was nice layering to the taste; I could taste malt, phenols, and wheat at different times which is a great and elongated flavor. Had the correct body and sweetness but did lack on carbonation. Alcohol was masked well under many great flavors to this good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite Weizenbock (Vitus), but a really nice option for when I want something more interesting than a standard hefeweizen."
""
"Drinkability – I’m surprised how quickly I finished this. One of all time great weizen beers."
""
"Its a must have for variety, however, I don't see it as a beer you can spend the night putting down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very tasty. Not sure how much the flavor has changed over time due to the fact I haven't had a fresh one in awhile. The alcohol is very well hidden. Very crisp and refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into my wheat beer glass. Maybe I didn't pour all the yeast out, because it wasn't quite as cloudy as I was expecting. It was a fairly clean body overall, light brown with off-white head that dissolves quickly. Notes of ripe fruit on the nose. Sort of rum-like character. Wheat taste miced with apple and other, darker fruits to the taste with moderate yeast. A unique brew - doesn't fall into my favorites, but it is very good. I don't usually reach for weizen anything, but this stands among the best of its kind."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very smooth and drinkable, the alcohol is evident, but not solventy"
"O: An interesting and well-made beer, but maybe not something I'd come back to over and over. I might be inclined to revisit it on a cold night as a lighter alternative to a barleywine."
""
""
"The first few sips I was quite overwhelmed. It's a proper complex beer. 10 minutes later the glass was empty though, and I couldn't believe it. Keep an eye on this one. It'll have you pounding the glass without even realizing it."
""
"O: Great complex flavors insure that careful sipping will reward any fan of great beer. Warm, almost burnt, notes join traditional hefe flavors of banana and citrus in a heavier cider brown beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly an experience, and a worthwhile one at that. A great beer and solid style. Dynamic and interesting, certainly quite a big beer, but was happy to spot this one in the LCBO and would pick it up again."
""
""
""
""
"O: not my style of beer, but easy to see why this is considered a world-class weizenbock. It is in fact the best I've had. The fruitiness and complexity make this one seem somewhat similar to a dark Belgian brew."
"Since this aged version was bottled at the brewery, it probably should have a separate listing (I see other 2008 reviews here that are probably from this bottling), but will review it here for now. A great ale that obviously improves with age."
""
""
"O: Great complexity in the flavours of this Weizenbock, but the mouth feel could use a higher level of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark murky brown with a one finger off white head. The nose is a spicy dark fruit brew with notes of toffee and caramel. This beer is very bready, has a lot of dark fruits and a caramelized taste and feel. This beer has a rather smooth feel but is still a rather massive beer. There is a slight sour bitterness to this beer that seems a bit out of place but doesn't hurt the beer, rather then set it apart from the others. A solid doppelbock/weizenbock, Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking clear amber beer with a off white head that left ample lacing. A nice malty aroma with wheat overtones. Obvious Germany hops and flavoring, but a little more complexity that most other German beers I have enjoyed. I was excited to find this beer, and it lived up to my expectations."
""
""
"D - It's easy to see why this is considered a classic brew by many. Just an all around well crafted, and deceptively drinkable German beer. Although, as mentioned before, this is fairly similar to a Belgian dark ale or dubbel. While this brew brings to the table what most other darker German beers do, it has a greater depth to the profile, increased complexity, and unique subtleties that really separate it from the pack. This definitely won't be my last Aventinus."
"Very interesting. I'd like to try this aged a few years. I had the Eisbock and thought it was too heavy, but this is surprisingly light and more complex. Will try again."
"A pretty solid beer with some good flavor notes. Alcohol is under control but the finish is a little rough."
""
""
""
""
"O: Complex and wonderful"
"Overall a phenomenal beer that is top of its class. I'm very impressed with how easy going this beer is. Would love to try a fresh pint in Germany."
""

"This is a very good dunkel weisse. Dark color, cream color head that lasts as long as the beer. Slightly sweet and slightly nutty wheat flavor. It is better on tap in Munich, but the bottled tap 6 is almost as good. We bought a case and finished before leaving Germany three weeks later. The first was as good as the last. It is much better, smoother, better rounded flavor that Ayinger Dunkel."

"500ml bottle. Weizen glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Amber color, foggy appearance. Light beige froth. Close, lasting crown. Yeast, toasted bread, subtle chocolate, ripe fruit, toasted malt aromas & rum-like fragancy. Sweet tea-like upfront, hints of banana. Chicorice texture. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Ripe melon in the middle, toffee touch. Sweet herbal note finish. Orangish hues on the aftertaste. ABV is perceived as underlying warming sensation at first sip & subtle spicy touch in the middle. One of those beers missed even before finish it."
"Overall: A beer with a lot to offer. Its a classic for a reason. There is no reason not to try this beer if you can easily find it. It's even something to look for if it's not in your area. Very refreshing but also complex. Great, great, great."

"RJT"
""
""
""
""
"D: Why did I wait so long to try this?"
"Overall: Very good brew. Never had a Wheat Dopplebock before, but this one stands up to the best Dopplebocks I've had. Very sweet, but not cloyingly so, just a very well balanced high gravity brew."
""
"Overall, a great weizenbock made even better by its wide availability and relative affordability. Being a bit more of an obscure style, I can’t say I’ve yet tasted a better one."
""
"Not a beer that I would have multiple of in one session... but certainly one that I crave and enjoy the 16.9 oz portion down to the last drop."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Pour is cloudy, hazy dark amber with a monster 3+ finger off white pillow head. Great spotting and lacing throughout. Nose is incredible. Typical weizen characteristics with bubblegum, green apples, banana and cloves. Taste follows the nose quite closely. Big malt notes with a nice touch of the dark notes which is a bit different than the hefe. A hint of fig on the end and a great complex blend which makes it hard to sit down. Hides the 8.2% ABV well. Feels is nice, but a bit watery. Good carbonation aand a bit lively on the tongue. Overall- A great effort and tastes like a hefe on steroids! Great fruit notes on the front, complex throughout. Love the apple quality and the blend of malt bomb and adequate hops. The fig hit was also a welcome surprise. Very solid brew that I will hit again-"
""
""
"This is definitely different than I expected. But then again, this is my first Weizenbock... This kind of tastes like a yeasty, more alcoholic German Hefeweizen with some touches of funk and chocolate. Interesting, but it's a little too yeasty with too much alcohol flavor, especially by the end of the bottle."
"Pours cloudy dark chocolate brown with a tan head with lots of tiny bubbles. The head dissipates slowly, leaving very little lacing on the side of the glass. It appears to be well carbonated. There are smells of sweet malt, esters such as banana and bubblegum, and alcohol. There are other dark fruits such as raisin and prunes in the aroma as well. The flavor reflects the taste. There are sweet malts, fruit, and bubblegum flavors. There is some alcohol in the taste, but it's not very strong for a beer above 8% ABV. There yeast is also in the taste. There's a mild aftertaste. The body is light with abundant carbonation. The carbonation helps chase away the aftertaste, making this very easy to drink. Overall, this is a fantastic beer with high drinkability."
""
"This pours a cloudy amber brown with creamy foam. The aroma is slightly malty with some bubblegum and cloves as well as banana notes. The flavor is more of the same—I get some bubblegummy banana and clove maltiness as I sip it. Consistent finish. Tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I expected this to be excellent...and it is. I tend to prefer my weizens to have a lighter malt profile, but the fact that I still enjoyed this immensely is a testament to its quality."
""
""
""
"All-time greatest weizenbock to date. Would love to try this with some age. And, I can't wait to try my Aventinus Eisbock. I suggest you travel down this path. 4.5"

"Maybe the best Weizenbock available out there, it has an exceptional quaffable quality. Very tasty, I can feel no harm of alcohol during drink but yes it’s still there lurking."

""

"Notes: This bottle was 1-2 years old."
""

"this one is the grand-daddy of weizenbocks and it richly deserves the title."

"O-complex yet well-balanced example of the style"

"Poured into an Aventinus glass. Caramel body with white head. The head is reflective of the ABV compared to the hefeweizen head. I get load of clove out of the nose, a slightly spicy clove. The taste is loaded with banana and clove. Theres an insane balance between the clove and banana. Full feeling in the mouth, with the yeast flavors just taking over in the best way possible. Finishes chewy and amazing."
"There is alot going on in this beer. Very complex layer of flavors that actually go together very well. This is a hidden gem of a beer. If you've passed this up, pick it up next time."

"O: Surprised that I liked this one so much, its very drinkable and enjoyable with pleasant fruity overtones and miles of bready malts."

""
"Overall: A! will be back..."
""
""
"O: Really a very enjoyable beer that is quite sessionable even at the ABV (which is very well hidden). I have had this beer many times over the years and always enjoyed it, tonight's bottle for review is no different."
"A fantastic beer, hides its abv ridiculously well.Def one of my favourites."
"O- I enjoyed this beer. This is my first German craft beer and this makes me want to try all the other styles of beer from Germany. Also should I feel bad if this beer reminds me of RR's Damnation 23?"
"Easily my favorite German beer. I never had it fresh while overseas but even the old bottles sitting around the shelves here top everything I’ve had so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't think I've ever said this before but maybe it's too carbonated? Pretty prickly for a doppelbock. However, that subsides to a mild prickly-ness after ten minutes. Medium to full bodied. Great beer- if I feel like a dark German lager though I""ll turn to Korbinian."
""
""
"O: What a beer. Been dying to try this for a long time and it certainly did not disappoint. Although I'm not sure if this is better than Vitus... it's damn close! Either way a terrific weizenbock. I've had the eisbock version but I think I like this better."
"Overall this is spectacular. I am grateful that I had a great server while visiting The J. Clyde in Birmingham, AL who turned me on to this one."
"O: A really nice drink, I can see why there was only one left in E-Mart."
""
""
""
"O: Wow, now I know why everyone loves this beer so much. Will be purchasing this again for sure. What a great style, and done so well."
""
"O: One of my ""go to"" German offerings, this brew brings layers of complexity that makes the cold days a little warmer."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark murky and muddy reddish brown, with a 2 finger off white tight bubbled head with very visible carbonation. Smells of deep dark fruits, cherry wood, banana like yeast characters, and boozy red wine finish. Sour fruit hits the tongue with a bold cherries, grapes, raisins and figs and closes with a boozy spice finish. Medium bodied, bold and smooth, velvety on the tongue. Overall; this beer is great, and always at a fair price, very hard to pass up."
""
"Overall Impression- I can't believe this is my first time enjoying this one! Awesome! The prune and plum character was unreal in here. Will be buying again and recommend anyone to make this purchase. True to style!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. Very malty and tons of fruit. Almost no hops or bitterness detected. Very deceptive as well, drinks like a 5% ABV."
"O: Definitely a great beer. One of the best Weizens around. Very (dangerously) drinkable at upwards of 8%. However, I would say that the 2006 definitely is a better vintage to be enjoyed at this point in time (2012)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is just an awesome beer. I have been waiting a while to get this and now I really regret it. Its one of the best beers I have ever had."
"Overall - Totally wasnt what i was expecting. Very complex, Tons of flavors, and easy to drink. The bitter/sour fruit kick at first made me wonder if this was a skunk bottle but i realized this beer can be aged for many years. it took me half the bottle before i fell in love with the flavors. Essential beer to try."
""
""
"O- I'll admit, my expectations weren't tremendously high, but this beer exceeded them."
""
"Tastes more like Chimay Grande Reserve than a wheat beer - but this is the first time I've had this style, so perhaps that's par for the course."
""
""
""
"O- Exceptional beer. First time to try it and definitely will not be my last. Highly recommend if you are a wheat beer fan."
""
"Very easily obtainable (in fact there are even wrapped 2006 bottles sitting on the shelf I could try) and affordable beer. I'm happy to try this beer and would surely recommend it to others."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color with reddish hues and a heavy haze. Poured with creamy, thick white foam that left sheets of lacings on the glass. Spicy clove and dark fruit aromas are dominant with hints of roasted malts. Full bodied with rich carbonation and a smooth buttery feel. Tangy, spicy clove and dark fruit flavors up front. Spiciness fades through the middle leading to subtle, delicate banana, roasted malt and chocolate malt flavor. Finished cleanly. Lot of flavors and a wonderful feel."
""
"Overall, a great choice for getting you through a cold, dark winter day. I have not had too many of this style. Probably this one and Victory's offering. This one seems to hit all the style points quite well. As noted, a substantial and nourishing brew."
"I'm a big fan of hefeweizens but not too crazy about this one, the alcohol is very apparent in the beer and takes away from the delicious fruitiness of the complex yeast. Drinkability is lower than weissbier due to the high alcohol. On the plus the darker beer brings out some interesting smells and tastes of dark dried fruit that you don't get in the lighter hefeweizen. Despite the aforementioned negatives, I do like the beer, just not something I would get very often, just too boozy. A weizen for the colder months."
""
""
""
""
"Edit: OK the above review was from an on-tap experience two days ago. Now I'm having it out of a bottle and it tastes much more like its own animal than like a dark Hoegaarden. Still some of that wheaty taste, but not nearly as pungently Hoegaarden-y. Tastes more like its own thing, almost like they aged it and it became more mature and some more sweet notes developed. I actually like this bottle version better."
""
""
"A beer I have had tons of times, tonight is a well aged bottle from a case I must of bought at least six years ago. A lot boozier than when it is fresher. Memories of having this fresh at there gasthaus in Munich creeping back an old time favourite that is great aged or fresh and the measure but what all doppleweizen bocks should be measured."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am really surprised by how good this is. I didn't know what to expect from a style I've never had, but it's quite tasty. I look forward to trying the Eisbock."
""
""
"O- if you like sweet German beers with lots-O-kick, this is your beer. This is not what I like in a beer. On my first trip to Germany my first beer was of a similar style, which left me wondering what all the ""German bier"" fuss was about."

"This beer pours a slightly hazy, dark ruby color with a rapidly fading half-inch head and lasting lace. It's aroma is fruity with hints of plum, and bread. The flavor is fruity, mainly dark fruit and cherries. There is vanilla and sweet, dark malt with a pleasant warmth in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and full. Schneider Aventinus is and outstanding beer, well balanced, complex, and perfect for celebrating the new year. Highly recommended!"

Worst was from the bottle into the wrong glass at home. The glass makes a big difference apparently. Try this beer. At *least* once..."

"This is a very good beer. One to enjoy with a good meal...a steak dinner actually which I'll be enjoying momentarily."
"One of my favorite wheat beers and one of the best beers I've had regardless of ingredients."
"Overall, this is another example of why properly cellaring bottle-conditioned beers is a great idea. When this beer is fresh I find the yeast flavors to be too dominant with way too much clove, banana and spice, but here they play a lesser role to the dark fruitiness and the caramelized toasted malts. Really well worth the $7 outlay and I will definitely be purchasing this again (in bulk) next time I see it."
"O: Weizenbocks are not what I normally drink which is why I rated it lower than a Weizenbock drinker would have. It is worth trying if you want to try different beers."
"O: I can see why this is a highly rated beer. Great flavor profile, a nice beer to drink over the course of an evening, as I did. Look forward to trying a few more in this style."
"Pours the color of a strong cup of tea with a two-finger head, the bubbles turn more into a nice froth on the top once the initial pour dies down. Smells of muted dark fruits, cloves, and a light winey character. The taste is round and very smooth. The dark fruits and cloves dominate but are all slightly rounded and nothing seems to overpower the rest, great depth with a slight sweetness and a dry finish - all this without tiring the palate. The mouthfeel is creamy and very nice. This is a great beer! The alcohol is hidden and no doubt this is a well made beer overall. Add to that the fact it's widely available and reasonable priced make me think this will be added to the lineup often. A local shop has some 2004s wrapped in paper that I think I'll have to grab just to see what this thing does with some age."
"I have a harder time describing wheat beers, I will keep reading reviews to get a better hold of it."
"O- A very very good weizenbock. Classic flavors, I was hoping for a little more, but it is still fantastic."
"This is a very easy beer to drink. Taste great, goes down great, and leaves you wanting another."
"o - a pretty fantastic beer, tons of depth and richness. style-wise i doubt you're going to find anything better. seems especially well suited to cold fall nights. should be on every beer geek's must try list."
"This is just amazing stuff. Tons of variety, both in the aroma and flavour, together with an unbeatably smooth feel make this one of the most satisfying brews I've ever had. I think I would still prefer the much lighter Schneider-Weisse on most occasions - but the alcohol in this stuff is well-hidden, which makes it much more suited as a slow winter sipper (EDIT: and slow is not an exaggeration - I am still drinking this an hour after finishing the review!) I will definitely purchase this again at some point."
"Overall: It's tasty, but the booze is a bit more present than it would need to be, strictly speaking. Also, while the flavors here are nice, there's not a ton of depth. Not a bad brew by any means, just not what I expected, based on the reviews. But then again, I don't really know how old this is."
"Overall, this beer is fantastic. It's solidly built, beautiful to look at, and both feels and tastes great. I would highly recommend it."
"O: Nice complex taste, lots of flavor, but not wearying on palate."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, above average carbonation that leaves a nice bite in the tongue. Goes down pretty easily, even with the alcohol. Overall, a great brew. It all goes together so well, and the sweetness balanced with the spices is a great combination."
"o: good beer if your in the mood for clove."
"O: Wow this beer was a treat. I will be going back to this beer again and again. The beer hits it at almost all levels."
"O - This is easily the best Weiznbock in the world. Weinhestephaners comes close but this one is in a league of its own. Schneider & Son is da bomb."
"Poured a rich deep ruddy brown with great white head, head lingers a very long time. It laces the glass well. Scent of raisins,caramel, biscuits. It has a feel of bright carbonation. Taste is indescribably complex and delicious! A relativly high A.B.V. is absolutely not apparent, so be careful with this one!"
"O: there aren't enough words that I can use to describe the quality and awesomeness of this beer. From the beautiful presentation, to the inviting and seducing aroma, to the balanced and rich taste, to the smooth and creamy mouthfeel, this beer demonstrates how it should be done and sets the bar. Up until now, I considered the Weihenstephaner Vitus as one of the best beers (and the best in its style) but this one takes the spot. Too bad this brew is a bit on the pricey side but I will definitely go back for more every now and then. A must try for any beer lover."
"Overall This is a very nice beer. Its 8% alcohol is completely masked. It is very drinkable, and seems to gain in complexity as it warms in the glass."
"This really is not one of my favorite styles. However, I can appreciate a high quality brew when I taste one, even if it is not quite my bag."
"O: Overall a rather well rounded out beer. Tasty, and you can tell that the people who made this know what they were doing."
"Thick, sweet, malty goodness! The foam is similar to the foam in an ice cream float. The beer looks cloudy like it might have a lot of suspended sediment, but it is quite pure. It tastes and smells of grain and toffee. If light wheat beers were skim milk, Aventinus would be a milkshake."
"Delicious, hefty, and yet somehow refreshing, even at 8.2% alcohol. A better weizenbock than this, you will not find."
"After finishing the bottle, I noticed the upfront sweetness of the beer starts to build and kit gets sweeter as you sip, not something I enjoyed"
"Highly Recommended!"
"One of my all-time favorites, reviewed here from notes from bottle tasting though I have enjoyed on-tap as well. Poured from bottle into Aventinus tall glass a wonderful caramel color with a good amount of dense tightly condensed head of effervescent bubbles. Taste of malt and a very floral and carbonated burst of flavors all at once with a smack of warmth from the alcohol, but remarkably smooth and totally drinkable which can be a dangerous combo as I have had more then one or two in a sitting and found myself feeling no pain. Good good stuff that I could drink anytime and need to keep on hand more as my glass gets lonely for this dark amber colored devil."
"O-I wont look for this one again simply because I'm not a fan of the clove taste but it is a fairly complex beer"
"Like I said, this is the best and most complex example of this style that I have tried and the one that measure all others against. Simply classic, very complex, very enjoyable to drink."
"Overall this is just a wonderful, special beer. I would love to get this fresh on tap some day."
"O: A very nice beer."
"O: Very very interesting complex beer. I don't think my tongue is sophisticated enough to describe this properly, but boy this is good."
"O - You can't go wrong, alcohol is masterfully masked. Who doesn't like banana flavor in an autumn beer? I'm not a huge German beer fan, but this lives up to the hype."
"O: Tasty stuff, and well balanced and integrated. Just what I would expect from a German classic brew. Make sure you pour all of the yeast into the glass. The yeast is the soul of this beer!"
"O - I am very on the fence about this beer. I like it, but I don't think it's great. Great nose, sure, but the taste is only good, I think. I'll try to find something more recent and give it another go"
"D: the booze catches up with you, but is definitely not the focal point. great complexity on the palate. couldnt get as much on the nose and a slightly lacking carbonation are my only nit-picky complaints. otherwise solid."
"Overall an epic beer; a definite treat!"
"a fine brew. very interesting - anyway you look at it. even more important it tastes and smells great."
"O - I wish there were more doppelbocks like this. Very true to style, and very true to its composition. I find many doppelbocks too heavy, lacking finesse. Or, on the other hand, too far crafted into a malty wheat that it becomes a bad spinoff. This is a pinnacle of style that reminds us of the spectrum big beers have to offer."
"I have been very happy with G. Schneider & Sohn's other offerings and this beer is just a nice. It was surprisingly smooth at 8.2% alcohol. I expected more of a punch from something with that high ABV."
"Initially it smelled and tasted a bit boozy - it does little to hide the 8.2%. I assume the bottle I bought was neither too old nor too fresh. Overall it is a nice experience and it would be OK to buy it again, but I won't go too far out of my way - there are a lot of other German beers that I prefer."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a slight crimson tinge if held up to the light. Nice two finger cocoa head that lingers for a bit. Good carbonation and decent lacing. Nose is that of caramel, apple, pear, malt, spices. Nose isn't as strong as I'd like, but it's still pleasant. Taste is the same profile as the nose, w/ noticeable carbonation. Goes down pretty smooth, w/ big malt/fruit feel to the beer. Fairly dry in the finish and aftertaste- really dry (but not bad). This is a really nice tasting brew."
"O: huge(in terms of numbers)flavor profile going on here. very complex yet very balanced. Not something I would want to drink daily, but agian proving the Germans are tough to beat."
"O- a great beer with strong fruit nodes, a minor bitter finish that is substantially overwhelmed by fruit nodes"
"From the bottle marked 10.315-0685-2822. Sampled on August 11, 2011. It pours into the Dopplebock glass an attractive looking dark amber with hints of ruby red and a significant fluffy off-white head that eventually settles to a ring. There are plenty of wheat and sweet malts on the nose with a minor whiff of hops but no alcohol given its 8.2% ABV. At first the body felt bold but then it seemed to feel thinner, more like the texture of red wine. A beautiful balance of sweet caramel malts and wheat grab the tastebuds up front, which are quickly followed by a solid sting of dry hops and a battery of spices. Nice beer."
"O - This is one awesome beer and it deserves all the acclaim it gets. It has a ton of flavor without getting to the point of being overpowering. If you have the chance to try this one you really should."
"I'll definitely pick this up the next time I'm out."
"O - Good, but not my style."
"D: This beer is very well balanced, there are a lot of different flavors present (yeast, banana, bread, spice) and they all blend nicely into each other. A solid beer overall."
"Ein wunderbar bier, naturlich!"
"Overall: You really can’t tell it’s an 8.5%’er. I staring at my empty glass, which happened quicker than I originally thought it would. Here I sit wishing I would have bought a second bottle. I figured being an 8.5%'er, this would take me longer to finish, but I couldn’t wait until the next sip so it went down with ease. This is an outstanding Weizenbock beer. Too bad I can’t find it around in a 1/6 keg. I would easily invest the money in this one. For now, the 16.9 oz. bottle will have to do, which for around $4.00 a bottle, it's money well spent. Easily makes my top ten readily available beers!!"
"0- Wheat beers have the shortest of shelflives after hor-forward beers, like IPA's. So I'm hoping, although this one exceeds 8%ABV, that this example sits post its prime. It just fails to impress me. The flavor is there, but nothing exceptional pops out."
"O - GReat Weizenbock. Might be the best I've had. For sure the smoothest."
"Pours a cloudy dark tea like color with a large foamy off white or light tan head which quickly dissipates. Smells of yeast esters, spice, a little fruit, some cloves, bananas. Feel medium and creamy with nice carbonation, there is some sweetness, a little banana, a little spice on the end with a touch warming alcohol, good stuff."
"A tad pricey though."
"O -The beer is extremely drinkable, especially at over %8 ABV. really i think this beer is an awesome treat. A must have and repeat"
"O/D-The beer is extremely drinkable, especially at over %8 ABV. I must say that I enjoy the Weizenbock over the traditional Hefeweizen. I enjoy the darker malts. This beer is pretty neat, and everyone should try this. I drank this too quickly."
"Lively and prickly with carbonation, yet silky smooth at the same time. Bubblegum transitions to juicy citrus, which ushers in assorted baked fruits. Add a dash of cloves and the mix brings to mind a nice cobbler. Banana bread, rumcake, warming alcohol in the finish. Wonderfully complex. If you're looking for a measuring stick for the weizenbock style, this would be a good place to start. Great beer."
"Narrative: Gretchen Dulceberg’s candy business was in dire straights. For starters, opening a confectionary boutique in rural Utah was bound to cause some problems with the Mormon populace. Second, the recession hit the gourmet fusion sweets market especially hard. The average blonde haired blue eyes Utahite would saunter in with a sweet tooth for a simple Snickers or a Chic-O-Stick and be welcomed with Truffled Cocoa with dried ahi tuna or muddled marshmellow foam imbued with beef stock marrow. The price of Gretchen’s goods would leave a sour taste in the mouth of the most proper Latter Day Saint. Ultimately, Ms. Dulceberg’s sweet tooth was too obtuse for the average Mormon, but in Dresden, this place would have been a dunklesmash."
"Pours a murky iced tea color with a 2 inch light bone head that fades to a small cap. Small swatches of lace drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, dark fruits, and spices. Taste is of clove/spices, wheat, and dark fruits. There are some slight vanilla and chocolate flavors too. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer and the first of the style I have had. I would get this one again."
"O - Ok so still an awesome beer, BUT not the bite you get from a fresh one. Thoughts of mild Belgian dubbels and dark ales coming to mind."
"Well, now, I have a finger of light-tan head with decent retention in light of the heat and humidity. Color was a slightly hazy deep amber. Nose smelled heavily of red grapes, like a preparation for wine and now I was shaking! Mouthfeel was smooth and the nose had nothing to do with it. This was a semi-sweet beer with an alcohol content that would put any of us on the road to perdition. Finish was deadly smooth and all of a sudden, I felt the urge to operate heavy machinery. This may be the devil's work!"
"One of the most famous Weizenbocks doesn't disappoint. Complex, but super-drinkable. A must have beer."
"This beer poured out as a really muddy looking brown color with a big fluffy tan colored head. The lacing looked promising and stuck around for most of the beer. The smell of this beer was really nice, had some soft wheat aromas mixed with some dark fruits and some spice. The taste of the beer was really great too, the flavors of clove and banana, sweet dried dark fruits and a nice wheat backbone. The beer is pretty light feeling despite the color. Overall I wasn't expecting to enjoy this beer as much as I did! What a nice surprise here. Can't wait to drink it again."
"O: Overall I was pretty disappointed. It certainly wasn’t bad, but it didn’t live up to the hype. I did, however, make the mistake of trying the Aventinus Eisbock before I had this. The Eisbock is fantastic, and this just seems like a version that was way too watered down (which I guess technically speaking it is a watered down Eisbock) and overly carbonated. I don’t see myself trying this again, its just too light for my palate. The Eisbock, however, now there’s a beer I can’t wait to have again."
"O: A very good beer. Would drink again."
"Delicious and complex, one of my favorites."
"500mL bottle. Pours a cloudy, earthy brown color with very little head. Aroma of clove, banana, yeast, earthiness and a bit sweet. Taste is much like the smell. Spices, banana, sweet grains, and breadiness. Has a bit of that banana bread flavor. Boozey taste is present but not too overwhelming. This one reaches a nice balance of flavor while not having too much spice flavor to it. Overall, its not a style I often have but this is certainly one of the better Weizenbocks out there. Worth grabbing for sure."
"O: There are no complaints here. Aventinus is complex but immediately enjoyable. This is a beer that can change perception and change minds on a style or a brewing tradition. It has mine."
"This beer pours a dark copper brown color with a nice fluffy lasting off white head. The smell is yeasty slightly spicey like clove and banana but much lighter than in most hefeweisen. the flavor is mirrors the smell almost perfectly but it has a hint of a slightly metallic flavor. the mouthfeel is a nearly perfect a nice medium body with decent carbonation. overall this beer could be a little better the metallic flavor and maybe a little bit fuler body, but it is excellent."
"O: The first time I've tried this beer and I can easily say...this is a great beer! I've seen a vintage bottle which I may try and pick up to do a side by side..."
"Overall this might be one of the best beers I've ever had. There are so many flavors and the spices really balance each other out. It's so easy to drink and so refreshing. There are so many flavors that hit my palate at once that it is just difficult to dissect all at once. I don't drink many German beers, but this has opened the door for me. Give it a shot, it's great!"
"A dry finish that is a bit on the thin side, but overall a very drinkable and tasty beer."
"I'll be stocking up on this in the future. I wish I could taste this on draft. I can't imagine."
"A robust yet smooth, full-bodied bock that truly deserves its reputation as one of the world’s best beers. Aventinus pours a dark ruby brown color and there are notes of sweet malt and spices in the nose. The sweet malt and spices jump out in the taste as well, complimented by hints of banana, dark chocolate, vanilla, and wheat with light floral hops at the finish. There’s a lot going on in Aventinus, and the sweet candy backbone makes it a truly enjoyable bock."
"Overall: Not an A+, but a very unique beer."
"A nicely done beer. And so easy to drink that it makes it a dangerous beer."
"Been wanting to try this for a while and finally decided to...glad I did...this is a very well crafted beer with a decently unique flavor combination. Well worth trying."
"O- It's a good beer but not really for me."
"Drink up if'n you like big honkin wheat beer"
"jd"
"Man I think the first time I tasted this beer it was a bad bottle, because this one was fantastic. It still smelled musty, kind of like old wine cave. It tasted like a wine ale mixed with a quadrupel. very good beer I'm glad I tasted it again."
"To sum up; the king of weissbiers."
"Pours a very murky, dirty brown, fig color with a large off-white head. Scent is spicy and wheat-like. Tons of wheat and clove with some banana and dark fruit. Taste is just like it smells. Tons of dark fruit with the distinct characteristics of a well-crafted Hef. There are such lovely clove and wheat flavors mixed with brown sugar and chocolate cocoa. There is a bit of alcohol flavor, but finishes very spicy and crisp. Mouthfeel is full bodied and crisp. Amazing flavor. Drinkability is VERY HIGH. Overall, this beer is OUTSTANDING!"
"O: Very nice. 4"
"Overall- This was a great beer. Definitely my favorite German beer that i have sampled. VERY cheap price at $3 for a 500 ml bottle in Alberta which is a awesome price."
"O: Good, but not special. I wouldn't put this with the best of the doppels."
"One of my favorite German beers I have had so far. Goes done super easy, especially when considering the ABV. It gives a nice array of flavors, but doesn't feel overdone in any way."
"Drink- Easy to take this one down ALOT! My glass was empty before I knew it. I'll always come back to this one. One of the best."
"$3.80 a single of which I'll easily get again."
"Overall: German style beers are really starting to grow on me. This is an excellent brew with a very interesting and complex flavour. It has all the qualities that a German wheat beer should have, with the big malty profile of a bock. Sweet, tart, and satisfying."
"Overall: Like it! Not familiar with the style and not quite my cup of tea - prefer a usual weissbier, but this left me satisfied."
"Robust carbonation scrubbed the tongue. It was very drinkable and didn't seem like 8.2% ABV."
"This is a remarkable beer. At $5.50 for 500ml, it's not an everyday beer, but it's certainly a delicious treat."
"O: Really great beer. Alcohol is present without overwhelming, taste, aroma and looks are all well balanced and it is nice and complex. I hope I can start finding this more often."
"Overall I really liked this one. It tastes good and goes down easily plus at $4.00 a bottle a good value for such a great beer. I sure this will be a staple for me and always have a spot in my fridge."
"Overall-Great flavors. Unbelieve flavors and aroma. Will be drinking this beer again soon."
"Overall: Fantastic. Completely deserving of its high rank on the top 100 German brews. I would gladly go for another if I had bought more."
"Pours an opaque hazy brown, ruby in the light, nice white head, nice lace all the way down the glass. Smell is of yeasty bread, dark fruit, raisin, banana, some sweetness, clove and light alcohol. Taste is of banana, yeast, clove, spice, slight alcohol, dark fruit in the finish. Medium weight, good feel, quite refreshing and lightly syrupy at points. Outstanding stuff, world class and at 2.75 this is a steal."
"T: Really smooth and really delicious. Banana bread and sweet malts all over the taste with some clove and spiciness towards the finish. Slightly creamy mouthfeel and a bit of a warming sensation lets you know it's not one to be taken lightly. I really like this one."
"Overall BUY THIS ONE! Cross statelines to find it if you have to. This will be in my fridge almost constantly. At $3.99 for a 500 ml bottle it is a great buy."
"Overall: Very good beer. The balance of flavors and aromas are perfection for the style. It was surprisingly refreshing, but the ABV reminds you at the end that this is not a summer easy quaffing drink. Pinnacle of the style in my opinion."
"What a great job and a must try beer!"
"One excellent wheat beer. Not only is it flavorful but it's smooth and easy to drink. Can be rare, so don't pass up an opportunity to try this."
"O- Fantastic! I love it! Could drink this on a hot summer night, or a cold winter night! I have to pick up another bottle of this before I make pulled pork tomorrow!!!"
"O - The balance of this beer is really impressive. This beer has a rich taste with dark fruits, bananas and clove that all play gracefully over your palate just long enough to keep you wanting more without overstaying their welcome and overpowering you. This beer is excellent and dangerously drinkable at 8.2%."
"overall this is simply an upper-eschelon german brew. not a style i personally tend to gravitate toward, but this one is very good. not to be missed."
"O: A very well-crafted beer. I never thought I'd be fond of really yeasty brew, but this is a thing of beauty."
"Overall: A nice and sweet sipper that is very complex. I could have this a couple nights in a row. One of the better ones in the style."
"Aroma is of yeast, banana, cloves, cinnamon, wheat and brown sugar. Full, slightly crisp body. Wheat malt, spices, banana, some apple and some alcohol fill the palate. Long, pleasant, semi-dry finish. Wonderful brew, I could drink it a whole day."
"O - first german beer I have truly enjoyed - picked it up at the local lcbo - no idea if it was any good but thought I would give it a chance - boy what a choice! It is reasonably priced and now firmly embedded in my top 10"
"This is a fantastic beer. I'm sitting on my patio with the grill lit and enjoying the weather. Sure I would be lovin life with out this beer but it is the perfect addition to enhance my experience. I highly recommend this beer and plan on getting some more"
"Overall, the beer was excellent, a great experience."
"if you haven't tried it ....get of your butt"
"O: Great tasting, solid all around beer. Very drinkable for its 8.2% ABV."
"Overall: There's a reason this beer sits at the top of the Weizenbock ranking, it is a really good, tasty beer. It has very good flavors, bananas, cloves and dark fruits all make their presence known during the drinking of this one."
"This beer reminds me of October and I feel it would pair excellently with pumpkin pie. The yeast is the star here, but the malt isn't far behind."
"Overall: A great tasting mix of fruits and spices. Goes down pretty smooth with no sign of the high alcohol."
"Overall, I am extremely pleased I bought this beer. It was kind of like a blind date, because I knew nothing about the beer before purchasing it and I was nervous about the possibility of choosing a bad beer on a otherwise crappy night. Put this on my list of favorite beers. Check! Well, back to packing my junk up for now. Cheers!"
"Pretty nice. Frankly, I like the Eisbock version a lot more. We hear a lot about this one and it’s very good. But that’s the gem of the line. A fine beer."
"Opens with suggestions of prunes and raisins, followed by flavors of banana, cloves, allspice and candied malts. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Hints of peach and vanilla surface before returning to brown sugar and spice. Complex malt character with the soul of a dessert bread. ABV is well concealed. Finishes with a smack of wheat."
"Overall a good beer. How it garnered such a high rating on here is beyond me. I drank a simple hefe before this, and it was much better. I can't get past the alcohol character. I don't mind it, but this tastes more like a shitty russian Baltika than something that would come out of the beer mecca Bavaria."
"Serving: 22 oz bottle poured into a snifter"
"I really want to score this higher, but I can't think of a reason to do so."
"A very exceptional beer. Pours to form a thick, creamy head. This beer has the sweet flavor and smell of ripe bananas at first, with a satisfying alcohol finish. The color is an opaque amber/brown. As the beer warms ups and the head dies down, the flavor and aroma become even more robust."
"I had this with mild-flavored picnic food: boiled eggs, ham, fried chicken, potato salad, etc. It enhanced the meal well."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to brown color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, dry banana, clove, and caramel. In the taste, dry banana, hints of dark fruit and caramel. A small bite and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry banana peel flavor in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol, big dry fruit, and so tasty!"
"Overall a nice example of the style. Nice flavors and solid mouthfeel."
"overall, not for me but i will give it another shot to make sure i didnt have a bad bottle or was just having an off day."
"The fluffy mouthfeel of this beer certainly makes it very drinkable but I would have preferred less carbonation to allow the great flavors to stick to my tongue a little better."
"overall is beer is incredible and held up amazingly for being brewed 8 years ago"
"Muddy, cloudy amber with creamy white head that lingers and has beautiful lacing. The smell is fruity. Strong, ripe bananas and spice. Clove in the background. Some dark fruits. Prune and raisin. Hints of vanilla. The taste follows the nose. Ripe bananas, vanilla, cream, dark malt, hints of chocolate, Mostly banana. Sweet carmels throughout as backbone. Creamy mouthfeel. Like a creamy banana milkshake with a dash of chocolate. Awesomely easy to drink."
"i was shocked when I opened up the BA page and saw the reviews for this one. I have never been this far below the average but I just did not like this beer at all."
"O- Some beers I have had in the past tend to get better as they get closer to the bottom. I poured out the first half of the beer and poured the second half of the bottle. No such luck. Just as unpleasant as the first half. Could not finish this one."
"This is a really outstanding beer that I have enjoyed many times and it is consistently excellent. Pours a cloudy dark amber with a nice 1 finger head that lasts. The beer smells spicy and exotic, kind of like a Christmas ale. Tastes of malt and spice. Warms you up as it goes down, but not too much - has a nice alcohol balance. One of my all time favorite go to beers that I'll drink anytime of year. If you have not had it, you have to try it."
"2003 bottle. Pours clear dark caramel color with off white head. Aroma is clove, sherry, wheat, and caramel. Medium mouthfeel. Flavors follow the nose. This has a great sherry like flavor, nutty, almost roasty, and is an overall great experience. A damn fine brew."
"Awesome beer. I am becoming a HUGE fan of this style of beer, and this is exceptional. It pours a cloudy brown and the smell of bananas and cloves is very strong. I would highly recommend this beer to fans of this style. Very easy drinking, refreshing spring or Summer beer."
"Pours a deep reddish-mahogany with a dense off-white head and smells rich and ripe with a dark-rum like character and notes of caramel, green apple and vanilla joining the wheat-influenced banana bread flavor. The palate is pillowy and full bodied, beginning with a vast, spreading blast of carbonation which settles into the caramel and apricot flavors with a touch of floral bitterness. The long finish starts sweet and rich with cooked fruit notes before turning mouthwateringly tart. I absolutely loved the whole lip-smacking delivery on this. By using wheat, this managed to stay incredibly elegant too, instead of succumbing to a bogged-down syrupy malt character. Probably my fav reviewed beer at the moment."
"A light spicy aroma with some banana and malt overtones. Color is an opaque brownish dark amber with bubbly off white head that starts tall and slowly dissapears with no retention. Taste is lightly sweet and bitter and a nice creamy medium body. Lively carbonation as bubbles arise for quite a long time. Finish has a definite alchohol note. I definitely like this beer but may not be my favorite in this category."
"D- Good sipping beer which leaves you with a satisfied alcohol related warmth."
"O: Really interesting to see how it held up over 8 years. I'd say pretty well! 4"
"M/D: mouthfeel is moderate and the carbonation that created such a huge head is gentle and smooth throughout. Alcohol is almost not apparent at all. There is a reason this beer has such good ratings."
"Wow, am I off the average BA review on this one! It looks good: cloudy, hazy, dark brown. It smells like clove, bananas, malt. The taste is ok, but this is not my favorite style of beer. I'm disappointed because the bottle says that there should be some chocolate notes, but all I'm getting is the spicy clove and banana. Now, I like bananas, but this is not my favorite taste for a beer. I like the other offering from this brewery MUCH better. Oh well, at least it gave me a pleasant buzz."
"D: Dangerously drinkable at over 8% ABV, the complex flavor and aroma will beckon for further sipping and I'm almost certain Aventinus would make a fine pairing with many roast pork or cheese plates. Excellent flavors and craftsmanship make it a no-brainer when in the market for complex German brews."
"D-Could handle 2. Very enjoyable sipper."
"Poured a medium hazy brown with a very large off-white fizzy head that dissapated rapidly and had no poor lacing. The aroma was complex with a dark chocolate malt and a sweet earthy yeast that had notes of clove, banana, vanilla and a mild alcohol scent. It tasted sweet and acidic with a mild hint of banana and chocolate in the begining and the become mildly sweet with a yeasty-sour flavor that had a nice spiciness at the finish with the flavor lasting only a short time. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and watery in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall an awesome wheat/bock beer, in fact I think I will just have to drink another."
"Could maybe up the bubbles. Not flat but could use a little kick up."
"After just a few mouthfuls I can feel the alcohol bearing down on me, which is fair enough at 8.2%, though I feel like it's still hitting me very fast. That being said, I'd have another. The fact is this is a delicious beer that I wouldn't possibly pass up at a liquor store if I could get it in my area. It exemplifies great beer that toes the line of the ""dark beer"" category."
"The taste is extremely rich. It has dark malts and fruity after thoughts. An interesting combo, and a nice sipper."
" Body is rich and velvety, but not creamy or thick. This is just perfect for the complexity of the flavors here, and better than any other beer I've had of this style. The high alcohol content make it something that I wouldn't be able to handle every day, but it's a very nice slow sipper."
"D: A great beer, even if my enjoyment of the sweet flavor did diminish a bit by the end of my glass; I'll be picking this one up again. As my first weizenbock, I might have guessed this was a Belgian beer if I didn't know any better coming in; while I haven't had any others, this is highly recommended for newcomers to the style."
"D: Very drinkable and delicious beer that is both refreshing and filling."
"D: This is probably the best wheat beer and/or doppelbock I've had. It's nearly perfect, despite the amazingly full/complex flavor and luscious mouthfeel, it still has a light and airy quality to it that makes it extremely drinkable and I completely don't sense the 8.2% alcohol."
"D: This is THE weizenbock in my book. There are plenty of tasty examples out there, but they hardly compare to the Aventinus. This is a must try."
"I know some folks are not big fans of the wheat beers but his stands up to any IPA, Barleywine, Stout, Belgian etc,. out there. This would make the finalist list for Best in Show...just sayin."
"-this is a very enjoyable beer. i keep trying these highly rated overseas beers that i can get my hand on and they never seem to disappoint. i guess 1700ish reviews to an A is no joke"
"At $4.00 for 500ml I'll definitely be purchasing again. Only faults were for the head that disappears quickly and the week overall smell."
"It's medium in body with lots of carbonation and a sort of grainy mouthfeel. I am liking the Aventinus and I think this will age well. Much more interesting than a normal bock but it's definitely feeling like more of a wintertime beer. I can't wait to try the Eisbock version."
"I would describe this as drinkable and it is a very good offering for the style. You can't go wrong with this one."
"Poured into an Aventinus doppelbock glass. Big foamy head with slight tan hue. Thick murky, brown, hazy, with the yeast added in. The aroma is pumpernickel bread, little banana bread, and yeast. The taste is the aromas with a touch of alcohol and cloyiness. The body is filling and after one bottle I am done for the night. A great example of the style."
"A wonderful beer, the bottle version was maybe a bit 'lifeless' if compared with the on-tap version, but i'm not sure wheter ratings would actually change"
"D- I liked this beer. Good flavors and good mouthfeel. Could definitely use work on head retention and lacing though. That was a bit disappointing."
"My only gripe is the appearance... can't get any sort of head out of it. A minor shortcoming."
"D - very drinkable, however I think 2 would be the maximum. If you define drinkable as hey I want one again it's a 5. If you define it as I want to pull a 5 beer session, that this is not that kind of beer...unless you are in southern germany, it is on tap, served by a beautiful teutonic waitress, and your friends can carry you out."
"This is a world class beer Nd I will definitely buy it again at a price of $4 for a 500 mL bottle."
"Another little guy that I happened upon early in my beer-drinking existence and have only recently gotten around to returning to it. It pours a hazy sienna topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, Belgian yeast, clove, red apple skin, and toffee. The taste brings more of the same to the table (well, cup, anyway), with some additions of black pepper, banana, nutmeg, and rye bread. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice w-bock; it's pretty clear why many would consider it the standard of the style."
"A pretty good beer that's complex and relatively easy to find. I don't see myself rushing out to buy bottles of this as it's a tad pricey. I think I'd opt for other weizen/hybrid beers than this."
"This is a really good beer."
"Nothing to complain about or negative comments, just something that was a good drink but also something I would not consider having more than 1 glass."
"D: This beer goes down smooth. Amazing beer. I love this brew. Definitely in my top 10. I am blown away by the flavor, balance, and complexity. The finish leaves me wanting more and more. World class stuff for sure!"
"D- Quite a bit going on here and super easy to drink."
"The CPJ"
"This beer reminds me of a hefenweizen that tastes of more intensely of dark fruits than of bananas. Really interesting brew."
"D - This is quite delicious and I'd love to have this again.Would love to try this with 10 years on it. Stuff is delicious really but a definate sipper. Tasty, great aroma, definate must try."
"Drinkability: Maybe I need to give this another try, but it really just is not as good as I was expecting. The aroma is interesting, but the flavor just comes up a bit short."
"A 500 ml bottle with the renewed unappealing label and crown-cap saying Tap 6. BB date 28. July 2011, into tulip. Pours turbid ruby-brown body overlain by thick, long lasting beige head that clings to the walls and after finally subsides forms a permanent thick solid cloth. Weizenbock can be tought of as (Doppel)bock whose grist bill includes some wheat malt therefore its organoleptic qualities should be a mixture of (Doppel)bock and German wheat beer. So,...the aroma is bock-like melanoidins, bready malt, ripened plum, clove phenolics, banana esters and evident alcohol. The palate is on the sweet side with bock-like melanoidins, dark fruits (plums and raisins), wheat flavor, clove and spicy alcohol that helps to balance the malt and brings warming sensation. Full bodied and highly carbonated although not as prickly as expected considering the carbonation. A nice marriage of Bock and Weizen qualities albeit a bit to alcoholic."
"D: High"
"D - ABV hidden well. Decent brew and not that difficult to drink. Recommended for people unfamiliar with the style."
"D: An excellent, highly refined weizenbock. Great balance of wheat malt, spunky weizen yeast character, and delicate mouthfeel. Easily, easily drinkable and more refreshing than any beer this big has a right to be."
"D-the complexity seems to diminish but the after-taste becomes almost stronger through out the bottle. its a very heavy beer and it doesn't seem to go down too quickly, tho it does go down enjoyably."
"D: Great overall, I could not very find a hint that it is 8.2%abv. Flavors are all there and this sets a bench mark for the style."
"D -- A must try for any fan of doppels in general and for wheat fans who haven't crossed into the dark side. It will not disappoint."
"D - The high level of alcohol comes out soon and, with the consistent body, makes this beer not so drinkable."
"Overall- This really is the best weizenbock out there! Back to back with weihenstephan, that was good, this was excellent. The actual wheat does stand out more in this one, despite it being both stronger and darker."
"I recently tried a few weizenbocks and did a little comparing, this was a good weizenbock, but a little heavy for my taste. This poured a hazy dark brown with a tall off-white head. Smells of wheat banana and clove. Taste is similar, but included some malts. Mouthfeel was thick, too think for my taste. The heavy feel really brought down the drinkability. This is a good beer, but I would suggest checking out some others too."
"Overall very easy to drink and is fairly light for how dark it is. A great beer to have."
"D_Pretty easy drinking."
"on another note there were some nice fruity hints in the smell, but the bitter finish ruined any pleasantness I had with this beer."
"This was a very good beer that offered lots of complex flavor. I seemed to discover something new with every sip."
"An excellent beer and a standard. Do not pass this one up on tap!"
"Drinkability - I gotta say, i think this was a bad beer bottle. there was nothing that stood out, even when it warmed to room temp. I am buying it again to try and see if this was just a bad bottle."
"Notes: What else can I say? It's a great beer!!! The only thing I would like to have had with this beer is a little more head retention."
"Served on tap at Pizza Paradiso (DC). Floral/citrusy nose. Hazy and dark color. Smooth taste with a bit of a caramel taste at the beginning and a hint of bitterness at the end. Excellent example of a Weizenbock. Could drink this until I fell off the stool!"
"Aventinus was brown in color with some haze (very hazy after the second pour). It had a large beige head with good retention and spotty lacing. The smell was nice with caramel, banana, clove, and brown sugar. The taste was nice with toasted wheat, banana, dark fruit, pepper, and caramel (Hefeweizen meets Doppelbock). It was sweet upfront and the finish was long and semi-dry. It was medium-full in body with medium-high carbonation. Drinkabity was good. This is an excellent Weizenbock and worth seeking out."
"D - Could have this anytime, be it the dead of winter or on a warm sunny day. Just watch yourself though. Aesthetically beautiful with a world class flavor and balance. Enjoy!"
"One of the best lagers in the world."
"D: This is a spicy, warming beer that is great on a cold night in front of a fireplace. The sort of beer you sip while reading a good book or watching a movie. Enjoyed this quite a bit, and for the price, it's a great buy."
"Poured from bottle into stein. Poors a dark copper, huge thick head. Low carbonation and no lacing. Smells of malt, banana, clove and pepper. Medium body, smooth and well rounded with some nice banana, not bitter but a nice long lasting kick that trickles down your throat. After taste is spicy and warm. One of my favorite weizenbocks."
"DB- Very solid and refreshing beer that is somehow 8%. Drinks very well and is truly crafted with brewing mastery."
"I could drink this all night, but at 8% ABV you have to be very careful. Each bottle has the alcohol content of about 3 regular beers which is why most people are ""one and done."""
"D - Pretty good and surprisingly drinkable. The ABV stays hidden even after some warming up."
"I think you would be hard pressed to find another beer in this style that can beat this on out on aroma and flavor. It may be a personal preference but this is one of the best in my opinion. Huzzah to German brewing!"
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Excessively drinkable for more than 8%. The alcohol is mastectomy hidden, I never once got any sensation of alcohol flavor or warmth. Additional pours produce an increased amount of sediment in the glass which brings out more bready and banana-like flavors."
"I would have this again at the drop of a hat."
"This is the first time I have had t his beer. It is a very good example of the style. But at 8.2% abv, one or two is about all I will have at any one time. A very enjoyable beer."
"A top 10 beer for me, and fights for a top 5 spot."
"Drinkability - One and done. Not my favorite style but a great beer nonetheless."
"Aventinus pours a very dark purple, threatening to cross into brown. There are noticeable light red highlights around the edge of the glass. The bone colored head is dominating the glass, five fingers plus right after the pour, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere anytime soon. Only downside is that lacing is a bit weak. The nose to me is like a clove forward hefe on steroids. A ton of clove, some banana, and a fair amount of vanilla-esque sweetness that I always get from wheat. No real hint of the darker malts used in this one though, which is a bit of a letdown. The flavor makes up for it though, as in addition to the aforementioned hefe notes there's a generous dollop of caramel and a dash of fruitiness (almost straight plum). The final piece that elevates Aventinus to true greatness is the slight, pleasant warming sensation from the alcohol. The body is great, nice and full without spilling over into a stout-like richness. Carbonation is similarly top notch, a bit on the low side but very sharp nonetheless. There's just something keeping it from perfection, I think maybe the body could stand to be just a touch bigger. This beer is just another reason (along with the eisbock, hefe, and Brooklyn collab) that Schneider is my favorite German brewery. A true classic."
"Great overall, I've had a few regular bottles and a 2003, it ages well!"
"D - Very drinkable, super refreshing."
"Drinkability: Extreme. Bring me more."
"D: So highly drinkable and very deceptive abv, I'd put a few back before I realized what hit me"
"A bit high in the ABV, but the 500ml is perfect, because anymore would be just too rich. A perfect portion of this amazing beer."
"D: A good beer, but I guess I'm a little underwhlemed by this brew -- very sweet, not cloying, but lacking some in complexity. I will give a fresh bottle a run sometime and see if the time in the cellar hurt this guy."
"D - Very drinkable! Easily a top 15 beer for me. I perfer the Aged 2003 better than the current shelf bottles, it was either a 2009 or 10."
"Drinkability - I cant stop sipping this stuff. Very good. Highly drinkable except for the hight ABV. One of my favorite beers for sure."
"M and D - Again smooth is the operative term here, medium body with just enough carbonation, finishes dry and a little sweet. Just a great beer to drink, the alcohol is well hidden, but still warms nicely."
"D: This is terrific but the carbonation is overdone."
"Gentle but plentiful carbonation tickles the tongue lightly for a medium bodied beer. The fairly dry and clean finish with only a hint of an aftertaste combined with a well hidden alcohol content makes Aventinus much too drinkable."
"Overall, what was most impressive about this brew was its aroma. It is bold, complex, and has every little scent a weizenbock should. The flavors in the taste were delicious, to say the least, but were not as robust as suggested from their smells. One curious note was how present the alcohol was, for a beer of 8.2%. While this is, admittedly higher than some, for the style there are many that meet and exceed that, while masking it a bit better. This is not to say that it was unpleasant, but rather, unexpected."
"Drink - Another beer that is among the best I've ever had. It has a fantastic appearance and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. This beer tastes delicious and is well worth seeking out."
"Wow. One of the things I would have liked to have had in Scheidner Weiss's original hefe was a stronger flavor and this beer delivers just that. This beer is outstanding. All of the flavors you want and expect in a hefeweizen plus the added malt taste puts this as one of my favorite beers."
"Dangerously drinkable for the abv. This is a top shelf offering. Highly recommend."
"Bravo."
"I wonder what it's like on tap!"
"D - Lovely stuff. This is about a year and a half old but still, very worthy."
"Drinkability: Quite possibly my favorite German beer. I've been drinking this for over 5 years and keep going back."
"I'm highly disappointed, but that's the chances you take in this ""hobby""."
"D- This beer drinks like an easy pounder, but that abv will hurt you."
"A note on food pairing, if you're ever in the hunt for a good breakfast food beer pairing I would highly recommend the way this compliments buttery breakfast items like french toast and Belgian waffles, or sage sausages."
" I found this 500ml bottle for $4!! Its also always refreshing to see this brew in the top 100 (deviating form the IPA, stout, barrel aged, sour dominated list). Fantastic, classic example of the style to measure others to."
"A classic wheat doppelbock (""Germany's original"" according to the label), this has long been a favorite. Many tastings over the years have confirmed its consistency and suitability for pairing with strong or rich foods. Pickled herring and smoked whitefish had no quarrel with this."
"Overall, a excellent beer. Quite drinkable for the ABV as well. Actually, for how strong it is, I would number it the champion of drinkability."
"D - Extremely well balanced and easy to drink."
"D - Alcohol... Masked. Flavors... strong. Price... eh. It's good on occasion but it was seriously the smoothest beer I could drink today. A Germany win!"
"I was really looking forward to the vintage. I enjoyed it, but realized in the end that I prefer the fresher version. I still recommend trying to the aged version."
"This one caught me by surprise. I was not expecting this to be what it was but damn what a surpise."
"D: The taste is so complicated that every sip is like a taste adventure. This is one of those beers that I'll be giving to my wine drinking friends as counterpoint."
"D- Nothing overly special about this beer. Best aspect may be how well the alcohol is hidden, which does contribute to some good drinkability. Smooth enough to go down easy, would not drink too many of these as you might end up in trouble. But you couldn't tell from any of this beers traits that it was 8.2%."
"D: Very balanced for style and loaded with rich, complex flavors. A pleasing beer for a person who enjoys a full flavor. A classic for the style! Drink slowly to enjoy all this has to offer."
"If you chugged it you won't know but as it is, very tough to drink."
"Overall I had been putting off trying this beer for entirely too long, something I now know. A very good beer serving as the benchmark for the style, well worth a shot."
"Taste was very smooth. Hard to believe that this is 8.2%. Raisins, sweet malt, clove, some banana; pleasant yeast flavor. Really well balanced flavor. The beer had nice carbonation, a medium body and finished with a good spicy aftertaste."
"Pours a deep amber brown color with a thick off-white foam head. Has a strong aroma of dark fruit. Has a yeasty clove taste with dark fruit notes on the backend. Has a thin to medium mouthfeel. Very Tasty. Not sure it will stay this high in the top 50, but a good solid brew."
"Drinkability is great, amazingly solid for a beer at around 8% alcohol."
"This is one excellent beer, don't pass it up if you see it."
"Get some!"
"Dark brown and cream beige long, high carbonation. Banana and clove aroma and flavor Ibid. Weizenbock is one who deceives, or looks like a simple Weizen in flavor, though more bananas, but its 8.2% alcohol to make a great marsh. Alcohol appears much less flavor than our national Weizenbocks, making this great beer and excellent drinkability."
"Drinkability: Even with all it's sweetness, this beer manages to strike a balance so as to not be cloying."
"A very well balanced and well done weizenbock."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer that is easy to drink. Good flavor that was not what I expected. Unique flavors and complexity make it a great beer. You can start to the ABV after a while. Will definitely drink again."
"D: A very nice Weizenbock - a must try!"
"Glad to have finally tried this beer. It was an experience matched by no other. While I may not enjoy the flavors as much as other I do appreciate the quality of this brew. One bottle is enough for me. Definitely one to pick up at some point in your beer journey."
"Pours a dark brown with a white head. Hoppy, hints of clove, and coffee smells dominated armoa. Some spice and hops going down, but really dominated by the malts. Very smooth and balanced in body. Very drinkable as it goes down real smooth and has great taste, but it's very pricey. More of a once with a fancy meal than anythingelse."
"The taste is just like a Weissbier but stronger of alcohol and malt. Sweetness is present but not too strong and also some bitters in the aftertaste. This is a very thick and chewy brew and is just what the style should be. One is enough but session drinking could be possible if taken slow. Highly recommended and an asset to the style."
"high drinkabilty, as it tastes like a lower ABV, and it's easy to drink."
"One of the few beers that nears absolute perfection to me. It'd be hard to believe they get much better than this."
"D - Could drink this all day, preferably at a bier garten in deutschland. The ABV is masked scarily well, boozy aftertaste is pleasant not overwhelming"
"Verdict: An elite beer worth tracking down, having only a minor fault here and there."
"i didnt enjoy this as much as i thought i would. very reminiscient of a belgian quad, same flouride like feel and power. i prolly wont buy this again, but thats not to say i wont drink it again."
"Drinkability - A good Eisbock but wow would this be hard to drink in large quantity but then again why would you. Not my favorite style but a excellent represent representation of it."
"D= limited only by the cost and higher ABV%. For me, a session is managing to finish a full 22-ounce bottle at one sitting!"
"Very nice! This is a great beer. It is very well balanced and smooth. It is full of flavor, yet can be used as a session beer as well."
"Overall - After one taste, it's easy to see why this one is often considered the archetype of Weizenbocks. If you like wheat beer, go seek it out. Now."
"D: Excellent. What a wonderful beer. I can't believe I've lived in Germany almost 3 years and have never tried it."
"Drinkability -- An exceptional beer. Not my favorite style, but this is certainly its standard bearer. If only for the experience, it's a must-try."
"D - Overall a very tasty offering. The flavours are very unique and fruity and make for a very pleasurable experience. The carbonation was a bit of a turnoff for me, but that's more of a personal preference. Worthy offering to any wiezenbock fan!"
"D: If you like apple cider and don't mind wheat beer, you will enjoy this. All the same, I think I prefer the regular Aventinus."
"Deep amber Hue with glowing brown and orange highlights. this one pours with a Huge fluffy head about three or more inches tall and off white. powerful aroma with lots of complex layers consisting of yeast and extremely fruity, and slightly spiced. banana, clove, a little raisin and some apricot are all in there. now thats wheat beer. Extremely smooth palate with lots of caramel and slightly sticky. strong banana and clove flavors with a nice spicy finish with just a touch of alcohol. This one makes me moan."
"Drink well my friends"
"A friend of mine recommended this beer as being one of his absolute favorites and I can absolutely understand why. A truly fantastic beer"
"Very tasty but definitely a sipper."
"For 8.2% you can taste the alcohol a bit but it's still very drinkable. Overall I'm glad I tried it finally and would definitely buy again."
"Drinkability - With the not-too-lingering aftertaste and higher complexity, this is a great beer to have around in the fridge and share with friends. Maybe a little too much to go back to too often though."
"This does not seem like an 8.2% alcohol beer. Sweet, spicy and dry makes for an interesting and quaffable beer that defines the style."
"Final Thoughts: for a widely available import, this was a very solid wheat doppelbock. While I greatly enjoyed this beer I don't think I'll be going back to it time and again. For my money I'll stick with Weihenstephaner Vitus."
"Nice medium body with good carbonation. Beer is smooth and easy-drinking. I could sip this all night-- this is a pretty young bottle, and I plan on aging the next one for a bit longer."
"Overall i think the Aventinus doesn't quite live up to what i expected, having said that, it is great for it's style: the Doppelbock. At 8.5% the 500 ml bottle serves well on its own. Very cool bottle and labeling, with the regal colours and logo."
"D: I had no issues with finishing this; in fact, I wish I had another. Alcohol is no issue and the sweetness is enough to notice but not get in the way of enjoying a full bottle. After Hopfenweizen, this is my favorite from this brewery. Great beer"
"Drinkability- Not a session beer, but one to enjoy after supper on a cold winter evening."
"d- very good brew, goes down quite smooth for a strong beer, would recommend this to any beer drinker who respects quality in their mouth"
"D- this is a nice wisenbock and a standout for me in the style."
"D - Quite drinkable, the ABV is completely hidden. Got a little more cloying as it warmed up but I still had no problem finishing the pint. Incredible beer, certainly deserves it's place at the top of the Weizenbock list."
"Drinkability-Although I do prefer the Aventinus Eisbock in terms of flavor their regular Weizenbock is definitely more drinkable; addictively so."
"D: This one took me by a bit of a surprise. Extremely delicious and drinkable. Highly recommended."
"Solid beer for my first ever weizenbock. Very good beer, I think this one is going to grow on me."
"All the taste of a non-wheat dobblebock with a much lighter feel and more alcohol! This shames all the other dark wheat beers I've had."
"D: Really good."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits and malts. Taste is good, fruits, malts, spices, very flavorful. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a high quality beer."
"Having this beer on tap, in it's own glass, is a special event. It's a tall glass, slim at bottom and quite wide at top. My favorite style of beer is a Weizenbock, and as you would expect I enjoy the slight sweetness and maltiness of this beer. It really deserves a place among beers such as Chimay Bleu, Westvleteren, Rochefort as an amazing beer that has withstood the test of time. Schneider brews some damn good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is also good. Smooth, slightly thick and with a refreshing carbonation bite. This aids in drinkability because the brew goes down in gulps."
"This is my go to beer. I love this one. Pours a very explosive hazy brown with an oat colored head. Smells of malts, dark fruits and some banana. There is sediment on the bottom. I always make sure my last pour is like a quarter goblet to get a lot of the sediment mixed with the rest of the beer. So good.Mmmm. The first sip is nice carbonation, clove, banana, and a touch of alcohol. Great mouthfeel."
"There is no bitterness from the hops apparent. This beer finishes sweet and smooth with little aftertaste to deal with. All it leaves is you wanting more...and I could drink three or four of these and sleep well...on the floor...in a corner...fully dressed...or not."
"D - leaning heavily on the spicy flavours it still manages to find a good balance, very carbonated makes it more light and refreshing, and also helps to mask the high ABV, both flavourful and enjoyable to drink"
"Probably the best Bock I've Had."
"2004 vintage, from a .5L bottle into a snifter, room temperature. 1 finger head, white lacing. Heavy apple nose and present in the taste; interseting, and only revealed by aging. Curiously transparent ruby body, mucho sediment. Quite sweet, almost like a cider (Unibroue's Ephemere comes to mind), apple and honey are dominant. Wheat is curiously absent, considering the style (and the flavor of a young Aventinus). Mouthfeel not exceptional, some prickling from coarse carbonation. Taste is incredibly drinkable, but the price for a vintage is prohibitive. For those capable of cellaring their own, that might be an option. Drinkability is high unless you cloy at sweeter beers."
"Pours a hazy ruby brown colour with thick white head and nice lacing. Smells of banana and cloves like a hefe, but then has a nice chocolate and cherry smell too. Flavour has a lot of sweetness, but not too much. Really balanced flavours. Alcohol is high in this beer, but I can barely notice it at all. Wonderfully drinkable."
"I don't think I like this as much as a fresher version of Aventinus. But I still think it's a remarkable beer. Dazzlingly complex; a superb beer and testament to the lasting legacy of the German brewer's craft."
"The nose is wonderful. Rich, bready with a wonderful yeasty phenolic character, some chocolate, dark fruit (specifically plums and raisins) a mild clove character, a little bubblegum... this really is complex and wonderfully balanced. Caramel, a little vanilla and brown sugar are also present. The palate is just as remarkably balanced. Banana bread with chocolate chips drizzled with warm caramel and brown sugar come to mind, and despite plenty of sweet flavors, this never gets tiring on the palate. The wheat is noticeable, but never distracting, presenting a freshly baked dark wheat bread-like character. Clove, a little nutmeg and some cinnamon sugar are also present, particularly on the mid-palate. Raisins and plums also appear closer to the finish. The yeasty flavors aren't as prominent as the nose would suggest, though some phenolic character is present. Mildly sweet on the finish with a touch of alcohol, caramel and brown sugar, this is fabulous stuff. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this feels almost exceptional on the palate. This beer is just fantastic, and I'm ashamed to admit I've drunk as little of it as I have."
"It's very satisfying, very quenching, uniquely complex, and an incredible treat to enjoy. I can't say enough good things about this beer - every time I have it I am reminded of why I love real beer so much. The combination of flavors in the beer also makes it a terrific pairing with so many foods. Almost anything rich that has been grilled or seared is going to be great, rich tomato pastas and lasagna, hearty cheeses and thick soups work brilliantly too. The best may be desert though; flourless chocolate cake with a plum and raisin reduction sauce is the ultimate pairing for this game-changing beer."
"Very tasty and light, it goes down smooth and overall was a very good beer that breaks the mold of a Weisse beer! I highly recommend trying this beer."
"Drinkability: It's very flavorful, many layers, and quite smooth. ABV lends a slight warming on the finish. I really enjoyed this, but could not take on more than one bottle per session."
"Very very drinkable. I realy cant belive its 8.2%. Hardly any alchohol taste to me at all. Very pleasent to drink and the longer beetween sips the more the aftertaste makes you need another. Great beer, one of my new favs. A co worker said it was bad, I cant wait to tell him he was WRONG! A must try beer!"
"I haven't had a lot of this type of brew, but I cant imagine it being outdone. This is one of those big unfiltered flavored brews that make you love beer all over again. I could session this all night despite its higher alcohol level."
"D: My favorite weizenbock. If you haven't had this before, you should try it ASAP. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Good for gulping or sipping :)"
"Perhaps not the very best tasting of this beer since I'm fairly certain this bottle has quite a bit of age on it. It's in good shape in terms of just holding up to age and oxidation but the flavors are much less punchy. It's none the less still the best example I've had of the style by a mile."
"Update: Got a better bottle methinks. Carb was better and flavors more pronounced."
"D - Found it to be a very drinkable beer just not sure if its my style but would reccomend trying for sure"
"All in all, a very inoffensive yet tasty beer. It won't necessarily be a staple in my fridge, since I like my beer to be a little more interesting and dynamic, but this is definitely a great beer."
"Great example of the style, but I would say that 3-5 years is far too long to age this beer. I like the bottles fresh to a year or so."
"Tastes good, goes down nicely, but I feel like more than one or two and the mouthfeel would really start to bug me."
"Drinkability: Smooth. Creamy. Thirst quenching. Orgasmic. Numbing. I don't know what else to write. My first few sips almost drove me to tears. If there is a heaven, this is no doubt on tap. This is my first experience with weizenbock, and I am without a doubt blown away. Superb."
"T: Perfect sensation in the mouth, does not feel heavy at all, are perceived caramel and the characteristic flavor of wheat, with a final toast tenuous, but very long where alcohol is accentuated and feels like a strong beer"
"D - Very easy drinking beer and surprisingly light for the style and heft of the beer style."
"I'd rate drinkabilty higher if it weren't for the 8.2% ABV, which if you drink this beer quickly like I did, makes you feel it. Darn good beer."
"Notes: Well, I think this is going to be my gateway drug to German beer. I've had a few here and there, but I find many of the American beers that call themselves 'Hefeweizens' complete boring, which led me to avoid 'real' hefeweizens, and I haven't had a wheat ale in a long time. Not to mention, when I moved to San Diego, I found Karl Strauss (which used to specialize in German-style beer) to be the weaker of the amazing local breweries (not so much anymore, Karl Strauss has really stepped up their game). Schneider Aventinus just completely converted me, thank god Toronado SD sent out their promo email. This is truly a remarkable beer - I think I'm going on a weizenbock binge, as I have been with IPA's."
"Drinkability - You wouldn't be able to tell this was over 8% Drinks like a 5% hefe. I could drink a few bottles of this definitely. Strangely refreshing on an 82 degree night."
"D - This beer is easy to drink and enjoy. For me, it's more of a summer/early fall beer. That said, I would never turn one down."
"D: Oh God does this beer go down smooth. If it wasn't for the 8%+ abv and the $4+ price tag I'd probably find more ""special occasions"" to enjoy this beer. As it is I think Aventinus is a perfect beer and nothing will inhibit my drinking of it."
"d - very nice beer, very easy to drink (be careful). Counting this as one of my favorites. Exceptional brew. Poured one for my wife to sample and she loved it. She's already planning to buy more as Christmas presents for the family..."
"d - A nice weizenbock. Very easy to drink and some nice banana in the smell and taste. Would try again."
"I didn't quite know what to make of this at first -- it's almost like chocolate banana bread, if I can say that. But the more I drank, the more I liked it. I'll definitely buy this again."
"Bottle. Brown copper pour with thick head. Aromas of bananas mostly with lots of chocolate. Mouthfeel is very creamy thin bubbles delivers the flavors perfectly. The aromas are perfectly delivered in the taste, banana cake with cocoa. For something so readily available this is one of the best."
"D: very drinkable beer that was actually tasty and was surprising because on the real... german brews don't really tickle my pickle."
"Low carbonation. Probably all was gone in that head. Surprisingly light body. Would be really perfect on an early fall day when there's a little crispness in the air, because there's enough alcohol in it to provide a little warmth. Great drinkability, although as with all beer, seasonal."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - I offer this as a challenge to everyone who says he doesn't like wheat beers. Excellent stuff."
"This beer pours a peculiar but intruiging off brown reddish color with a decent clarity and a beautiful white foamy head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is on point and has that banana fosters aroma of caramalized brown sugar, bananas, cinnamon, and a touch of honey. Malty and dark fruitiness on the aroma. The taste is on point with a touch of astrigenty alcohol bite on the finish. Sugary, but on point with the style. Has a nice toasted marshmallow component on the finish. Mouthfeel is very very nice as its carbonated to all hell with a semi dry finish. Drinkability is very high as well as its got a nice delicious factor and pairs well with poultry and other lighter fare meals. a definate cold fall night beer."
"MF/D: a really smooth beer, not overly carbonated and pleasing to the palate (even though im not a weizen drinker). certainly didnt taste the 8.2%..."
"All 8.6% ABV are completely... Absent. This is extremely and dangerously drinkable. As a lover of Bavarian beers, this is fantastic! Drinks like a potent and sweet dunkel with 5% ABV. Try this!!"
"I still like the way the beer looks, but this bottle produced a much more controlled head than the previous batch. The taste was much better than I remembered. Complex and rich, its a mixture of chocolates, grains, and dark fruits. Sneaky drinkability with none of the harshness I previously noticed. Basically, its a dopplebock that drinks like a weizen... which is exactly what this style should produce."
"Poured from a bottle into an Aventinus glass (coolest looking glass ever!). Amazing looking beer, as it is a dark amber towards the top, and hazy at the bottom, with about 3/4 inch of head. Very smooth and balanced smell. The taste is amazingly complex, balance like the smell with the taste of some cloves, and bananas. Excellent mouthfeel, and very drinkable, with the alcohol hidden well. Refreshing like a wheat beer, but in a manly way (if that makes any sense). It may not be the best beer I have ever had, but it is definately my favorite!"
"Very drinkable and delicious."
"The beer pours a hazy red-brown color with a white head. The aroma is great with notes of bananas, cloves, toffee and vanilla. For the flavor I get caramel malt, bananas, cloves and toffee with a fair bit of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A great beer."
"D - Seems fairly filling, but I did have another beer before it. I would not want more than one 500ml bottle in a night."
"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite beers. It's a smooth German doppleback that's easy to drink (which surprised me, considering the ABV). This wheat beer has a wonderful banana smell and aftertaste. Just the right amount of carbonation, with an amber/brown color. In all, I highly recommend it."
"I poured into a nonic to a mountain of off white to tan head. It is dark amber/burnt orange in color. You could almost call in brown. The aroma is banana, clove, and yeast. The taste is banana, clove ,and other spices. The spices and carbonation tickle my tongue and throat. I can can taste the toffee malt in it as well. This is a very good beer. The alcohol is hidden nicely."
"Always a classic, but I prefer Aventinus fresh..."
"d 3 of us are presently spliting the bottle everyone loves it but feel like 1 is enough for one day."
"Notes: Glad and surprised to get hold of it on tap. Nice but... Hmmm, I may stick to the bottled version when having the choice between the two."
"The taste is truly complex. This beer has the character of a dunkles weizen and a dunkles bock. But this beer has a crisp clean taste that one doesn't expect from a Weizenbock. The body is full of dextrins -it is full with a smooth carbonation that keeps it from being cloying. Yet, both the front end and the middle of this beer have all of the flavor of a Wiezenbock. Spicy cloves, bannana, and bubble gum can be detected. Yet, the phenols are by no means over powering. This beer finishes with a clean, dry, crisp ending that is quite refreshing. Alcohol cannot be detected until the finish, but it doesn't overpower. Which makes this beer quite deceptive. It""s 8.2% ABV demands respect. It is not meant to be guzzled."
"This is one of my all-time favorite beers and I always get excited to drink one. The drinkability is almost dangerous considering the ABV."
"D - This is a great beer...I can remember having one of these fresh at the brewery a few years ago so nothing German for me beats an Aventinus"
"Drinkability: This is an excellent beer- very much like a Belgian beer that also has characteristics of a hefeweizen. Highly recommended, and something I would be more than happy to drink again."
"D: I don't really know what it was about this beer, but for some reason I really enjoyed the first half, but was much less excited about the second half. Maybe it would have been better outside in the heat instead of indoors in the air conditioning."
"Notes: felt more Belgian than German to me."
"D - Love this beer."
"Overall a deliciously malty Weizenbock with great balance; complex, drinkable, and utterly enjoyable."
"Excellent!"
"I was hesitant to post tasting notes on a two year old beer, but this one really shined after aging, on par, scorewise, with a fresh bottle. Drink it."
"Drinkability: Take it slow with this one. But for how much flavor it has -- it's very doable. With how much comes in one bottle (500mL ?), you'll only need one."
"Drinkability: Not really a fan. I found the pint bottle more than enough."
"Impressions: Tasty and refreshing despite the high alcohol content."
"D - This is a last night on death row brew. Absolute quality in every department."
"M, D- A sweet stickiness is counterbalanced by a perfect CO2 level which cleanses the palate. Very, very drinkable. Try this with an excellent cheddar."
"My roommate picked up a Schneider Weisse the other day and I'm looking forward to comparing it to this, its ""massive twin," as the brewer calls it. High hopes!"
"It will be so much better then."
"D: Lots going on here. Not an everyday drinker, but perfect for food pairing."
"All in all, this is a pretty tasty beer. I haven't had too many weizenbocks, but this is the best that I've had and it seems to encompass the style quite well. I would recommend this beer to pretty much anyone."
"I am so happy I tried this beer. It might be the first weizenbock I've tried (why do I set the bar so high every time??) but it is truly tasty."
"D: For the style, I think this is quite drinkable. Bock beers are not my favorite, but this brew has a lot to offer in terms of complexity and think-ability."
"Notes: Very delicious brew, well worthy of the #1 Weizenbock. I imagine that this would pair well with apple pie or baked apricot Brie"
"D - Pretty drinkable, but a high ABV on the style keeps it slightly less drinkable than you would expect."
"Not much at a glance, but steps it up with some complex flavor. One to linger over."
"If you like wheat beers you will love it, if you like doppelbock and fruit you will love it, if you like all those then you'll love it. I recommend for sure."
"D - Very refreshing, excellent flavor make this one of the best tasting weizenbocks around. Very easy to sip, with no indication of alcohol."
"This beer pours a dark brown,,, with a nice tan head. Yeat swirls around the glass. a very attractive beer.the beer just smells yummy. Chocolate, malty, cloves. It tastes just as good as it smells. This is without a doubt one of the finest German beer offerings. Very high drikability. It hides it's strength well."
"Medium-semi complex body...WOW! This beer has really impressed me, I didn't see this coming. Clean and crisp, yet ever so creamy and smooth! Carbonation is just right, on the higher side. Beer really reminds me of a great Belgian tripel, rather than a Doppelbock. Tons of fruit flavors, Belgian like-yeasts, malty. Either way, it's very, very good! For 8% ABV, it actually feels like more...but at the same time, extremely drinkable! A little bit of a nut flavor as it warms up. Overall-GREAT beer! A must try!"
"The eisbock version of this is still pretty good, but the balance of flavor, body and alcohol are so perfect on the original that the extra kick on the stronger issue delicately destroys the dream."
"This is quite dark brown with a light brown creamy head. It is so dark that hardly any light comes through. The alcohol is present in the scent, with a good bit of sweetness, most likely caramel. There is also a fruitiness to it that reminds me of banana. The taste follows the scent almost to a T where the combination of the flavors linger in the aftertaste. It isn't too sweet so I can enjoy it."
"I admit, this isn't my type of beer. It's so complex and active that for some reason my feeble mind & palette can't focus. They were utterly blown away. That however, I appreciate to give high scores."
"Pours an initially clear and tepid dark mahogany brown color before giving the end of the bottle a swirl and pouring the remaining yeast into the glass. Settles in a murky deep brown, reddish color with plenty of sediment. A large, light tan head slowly fades to a finger thickness and streaks of lacing. Aroma is yeasty, dark fruits, cloves and bananas, but fairly mild and restrained. Flavor is as expected for the style and the most balanced representation I've tried. Strong weiss flavors of banana and clove with rich malt complexity like a bock. Very smooth, full body with light, but sharp carbonation. Finish is mildly sweet, fruity and clean. Alcohol is warming, but never really presents itself in the flavor. I should drink more of this, but I think my infected Ramstein Winter Wheats turned me off from this style for a little, haha."
"After drinking about 100 of these over time this review is over-due, simply stated, the best weizenbock."
"The color is like a cloudy tea with a finger of cream colored head out of a 500mL. Lots of spicy banana right off the bat in the nose. Clove is present as well as plums and the slightest hint of chocolate. It's an earthy aroma. The chocolate makes itself more present in the taste. There's also a dark fruit mixture (figs, plums, raisins, and cherries) going on. Clove and nutmeg also make an appearance. It's got quite a bit of carbonation, but feels creamy and of some viscosity. The hefe-weiss aspect of this beer really helps with the drinkability. I tend to find most doppelbocks too sweet, but this didn't have that effect at all. In fact, drinkability is downright scary. No doubt I will be having this one again."
"As with most heavy wheats, it's a sipper (and a burper)... thoroughly enjoyed, but could not have put down more than two."
"D - The alcohol needs to settle down a bit for me to really enjoy this one. That said, it's 12.5% and it sure doesn't taste like that. The light body makes it easy going down...another year or so on this and I imagine it would smooth out nicely. I'll save my other bottle and review again in a year. Very nice."
"D: Drinkability was awesome this beer went down very well, the high ABV is very well hidden in this beer."
"I'm glad I tried it, I don't think I'll do it again though."
"D- The alcohol is really high for a beer like this but it is still not noticeable at all. This beer is really great. A perfect, darker option for warm weather and bier gartens."
"Serving size: 16.9ozs"
"M/D: Close to perfection on the mouth-feel. Creamy, yet bubbly with the alcohol making itself slightly noticeable when warming up. Like a dunkelweizen on steroids. Definitely worth multiple purchases."
"Drinkability was amazing. This went down so easy, I could drink lots and lots. A legendary beer for a reason, perhaps my favorite German beer, my German heritage makes me wonder if my distant relatives have been going nuts for this for years."
"Simply one of Germany and the world's great beers. The amount of flavour and complexity this beer has is just staggering. Choco banana, vanilla, toasty aromas, smooth spicy clove flavours, all of it in spades. Bang on carbonation levels. Insanely smooth with alcohol nicely in check. This has been a massive favourite for a while now. Never say no to an Aventinus."
"I think this is possibly the easiest drinking beer in the 8% category. It just goes down so absurdly easy, and then it's all gone. Good thing that it only comes in half liters, this would do a world of hurt in a six pack. And it's priced pretty nicely too. Is it weird to get butterflies when drinking a beer?"
"Drinkability; You could drink lots, but I would prefer to move on."
"The alcohol is well hidden and only arrives as you finish the beer, warming the mouth nicely. I expected more from this well respected and thought of beer, too sweet for me."
"[i'd keep bottles regularly]"
"D: The level of alcohol is well masked, but this beer is better sipped to appreciate the complexities of the different flavors. This is a truly unique beer."
"a weizenbock that incorporates a vast amount of malt. nice. rivals weihenstephaner's vitus for my favorite of the style, and in my opinion, you can't go wrong with either. this has more malt and is darker in color, spicier and fuller in flavor, where the vitus has more of a citrus kick, juiciness, and may be more refreshing."
"Bottom line was that I'm not that impressed. If it was my fault because of the clove thing... well, my bad. Not quite sure what all the hoopla over Aventinus was about, but to each his own."
"I'm not sure if i'll be picking this up again anytime soon, but It is a decent brew."
"Poured an hazy dark brownish orange color with an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Heavy sour citrus, banana and clove and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a dry sticky texture and soft carbonation. Heavy balanced bittersweet flavor with a medium spicy bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable beer."
"Taste is malt and booze. It's good but really too much booze I think. This hurts the drinkability but still pretty tasty"
"pours and looks like coke in the glass head fades to just beer and no lace at all. then it starts to get better smells of dark fruits hints of alcohol and dried plums and sweet aromas. smooth and creamy sweet taste thick mouthfeel like sweetened prune juice. i can see why it gets high marks."
"A nice rye-bread/cola brown with some sandy fizzy head. The head sticks around for a bit, but then fades to wisps on the surface of the beer. Smell is largely of banana and clove, with a hint of something metallic. Some caramel and lightly toasted malts there too. And some sweetness, almost like raisins. Good, but I had to hunt for some of those. Taste follows suit. It really is a good beer, though I remember that I liked it more the first time I had it. It has nice clove, banana, dark fruit, and toasted notes. The alcohol makes a play here too. MF is light and bubbly, with some nice coating action. Tremendously drinkable for the ABV. A nice beer to sit back and enjoy for a while."
"Really nice in the mouth. Im rating the drinkability down purely due to personal preference - german styles aren't really my thing but this is an exceptional example."
"The Aventinus pours a cola brown with some light pouring through the edges. A nice 2 finger head atop with no visible lacing. Aromas are licorice, plums, raisins, and hints of alcohol. Quaff has some malts to it along with smooth dry fruits. Some breads also bounce around the palate. Not nearly the amount of alcohol that was noted on the nose is present in the quaff. Mouthfeel is silk and smooth and medium bodied. Not much carbonation of note. Drinkability is solid for this style. Definitely not a one and done but possible a 2 and out for me."
"Overall: What an incredible beer, it has aged quite well over the last 3 years. I regret not thinking ahead and drinking this side by side with a fresh vintage. Thanks to beandip for sending this, it was a treat."
"D= Nice beer. Really like they style (this is my first dabble). The sweetness from a bock works perfectly with the smooth crispness of wheat. excellent."
"D- Very easy to drink beer even with 8%+, still a session beer if you are looking for a malt fix."
"D - Very good"
"Schneider never fails to deliver. What a great brewery and it's great that Garret Oliver is involved with creating beers at this brewery. :)"
"Verdict: Thoroughly enjoyable from the crack of the cap to the bottom of the glass, it's easy to see why this classic garnishes so much praise. Complex yet highly drinkable, this is the best place to start if you're looking to explore the Weizenbock style."
"D- Dangerously easy to drink. Very refreshing and although its thick, aventinus goes down smooth and easy. very enjoyable."
"Powerful aroma that's typical of a strong wheat: banana and clove esters with a substantial alcohol presence. Appearance is a cloudy reddish brown that's almost orange on the edges. Carbonation is light overall with a thin white head and virtually no lacing. Taste is primarily sweet with a significant bitter kick at the end. Very full bodied with a lingering sweet banana and clove finish. This is a fantastic beer. If you're a big fan of wheat beers then you owe it to yourself to try this one."
"M/D: Incredibly smooth. That lack of head was that way for a reason. I can't even feel a little tingle of carbonation, but somehow, Aventinus doesn't feel flat either. While there is no taste of alcohol, I do feel some warmth in the finish that detracts from the drinkability somewhat, but you could age one of these to deal with that if you really wanted to..."
"Body is light with a smooth, clean feel making it an incredibly drinkable beer."
"If there is a beer equivalent of ""comfort food"" this is it."
"Reddish-brown pour with a small quickly fading off-white head. Sweet caramel aroma, with clove and bannana. Similar flavor with a dry wheat aftertaste. Medium body with moderate carbonation. What's amazing about this beer is that it doesn't really jump out with any sort of unique or amzing flavors or aromas yet it still comes off as somehow decadent yet easily drinkable."
"D-the benchmark for the style. a Bockstrength wheat beer. Couldn't do more than one in a night but what a great beer."
"My standard Weizenbock. Period."
"Drinkability: Really tasty. 8.2%? Oops."
"Taste: bananas cloves, dark sweet malts. Some of the sweetness can be attributed to the appleish cider like tastes. Theres a bunch of sugar in there. This beer had some sort of resemblance to the St Bernardus abt 12, but not quite as complex, and danked with sugar."
"Notes: Really good beer. Good Hefe flavors mixed with the big, dark maltier flavors of a Doppelbock/BSDA. A bit like liquid candy/sweet juice and a bit like rum. Lots of good flavors, definitely a nice sipper."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing. Not quite medium-bodied but not too thin. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkability: A truly superior brew. I've waited a long time to try this one and the wait has paid off. As my first weizenbock, this really makes me want to try more of the style. This one is definitely worth a try!"
"Pours a dark murky brown that is somewhere between cherry and walnut. Very nice fluffy head with great retention, but almost no lacing. Aroma of clove, banana, brown sugar and plum. Taste is sweet with plenty of caramel and brown sugar, as well as fruity notes of dried fruits like raisin and plum. Clove and banana dominate. One of the more clove heavy brews I have had. Wheat really only comes through in the very finish, but adds a great smoothness. Medium to full body, but with a great smooth texture that is all weizen, with none of the cloying stickiness that I take issue with when drinking bocks. In fact, the finish is actually interestingly dry. Pretty drinkable, especially for this abv. I could see someone getting in trouble if they spent a night downing these."
"Overall Impression: This Weizenbock from Germany is hands down, the best one I've had to date. Very complex from start to finish. I truly have never cared much for Wheat Beers, but this one changes everything. I could drink this any time! Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: This is probably the 4th time I've had this, and the first time and this time I enjoyed it as the middle two were not as good. I was going to give up on it but after having it tonight with a meal it's spot-on good and I'll definitely pick it up again. It's a beer for a meal (bacon and chicken schnitzel in this case) or over a long movie. Not a routine beer; more like a special occasion beer."
"D: This is fantastic. The higher alcohol is not evidant in the slightest, the mixture of flavours are well balanced. I could drink this plenty of times."
"Bottom line, get a few bottles of this beer, drink a couple right away, then try to age a few. Fantastic."
"D: It's too sweet to drink a lot of and personally it's not my favourite style. The sweetness would stop most people sessioning it I'd think (not that the 8.2% isn't of concern itself) 3"
"D: A masterpiece in a bottle. Tons of complex flavors make their way towards a fresh and full bodied brew. Looking forward to more of these in the future-"
"Drinkability - It's deceptive: while light at first, it gets heavy as the experience progresses. Enjoyable, no doubt, but prefer less carbonation sting."
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth sweet flavors are easy going down. ABV is potent, but well hidden. Not filling, despite its stronger than normal carbonation."
"One of my favorite beers of all time and certainly an exemplar of the weizenbock style."
"Overall an awesome beer. Not my favorite style but I'm growing to appreciate it more and more."
"Drinkability: Very smooth but the alcohol doesn't hold back."
"The beer pours an ice tea brown color with very good head retention and OK lacing. On the nose, this is just lovely stuff. The beer has a sweet ice tea aroma, but with chocolate, cinnamon, and light clove. The blend of aromas is wonderful. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet beer, but the extended aging has imparted a lightness and delicacy that is remarkable. The sweet malt shines through beautifully in this beer, but with just enough underlying spice to counter the sweetness (which age has dialed down anyway). Mouthfeel is light, rich and long lasting... this truly is just an incredible beer. Drinkability is so good, that this beer is dangerous. What age has done to this beer is truly astonishing.... just excellent. I wonder if Casey will let me buy the rest. Yes, it truly is that good."
"D - wonderful beer. one i usually have in the cellar but always seem to pass by, bring it out when i know i'm in need of something delicious. is actually going quite nice with a few Euro cheeses and crackers..."
"D: Wow, that's a great example of a weizenbock, in every way. Powerful, but definitely something I'd like to tackle again."
"D: High. Alcohol is almost imperceptible despite the 8.2 ABV. High quality German beer."
"Hazy brown color almost like a dark apple cider. A huge head of off-white foam typical for the style with plenty of lace and great retention. Aromas of banana, cloves, bubble gum, and a bit of green apple. Nice complexity but a could be stronger. The flavor is absolutely flawless. Typical Weizen flavors of bananas, clove and bubble gum. Also a nice malt backbone with a firm wheat flavor and a nice additional raisin/green apple fruitiness. Some added spices are noticeable as well like a bit of nutmeg. Hops are minimal and seem to act only to keep the beer from cloying. The fruity and spicy yeast-derived flavors are the real stars here. Huge carbonation as one would expect from a bottle conditioned beer of this style. Very refreshing with it's light body and massive carbonation. This is one of my all time favorite beers. A definite must try, especially if you like wheat styles."
"D- Goes down dangerously smooth. Incredibly delicious, and the alcohol remains very well hidden. One of the best drinking weizenbocks I have had."
"Notes: Not much else to be said. Truly a great beer, especially if you're a fan of wheat beers or dopplebocks. Luckily I love both."
"Go get this beer."
"I could drink this along side Weinstephan VITUS and KORBINIAN for the rest of my days and die a happy man! The only 3 Weiz beers you ever need drink again!"
"I would drink it again on occasion, but it's a little too syrupy for me."
"D: excellent overall, especially drinkable for a dark beer. One of the best."
"Notes: I have only had a couple of weizenbocks before and I wasn't overly impressed. I'm glad that I finally tried a beer that does this style justice. It is great to see such good flavor profiles. It has all those light characteristics that you expect from a wheat beer, but nice, dark, and complex. Highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel was perfect, and the drinkability was amazing. Super creamy, super thick, so moist and delicious. Most drinkable dark beer I've ever had."
"500 ml bottle. Pours a hazy dark brown, off-white head is massive at first, but turns into a small layer covering the beer, tiny brown flecks sit on top from the yeast, really cool looking. Smell is great, big bread scent with many fruits as well. Taste is great, definitely leans more towards hefeweizen. Various light + dark fruits, clove, banana bread, dark malts. The doppelbock smoothness works great here with all these tastes. Very drinkable. Wow, I think I found a favorite German style. I'd love to try more of them."
"Feels creamy on the tongue, heavy body, syrupy. Very drinkable and is one of my more favorite German beers. I had the opportunity to have this fresh off the tap on two different occassions at the Schneider Brew Haus in Munich. Having it from the bottle is pretty good but fresh off the tap in Munich is an absolute amazing experience."
"We'll see, but the 8.2% is packaged as perfectly as possible it seems. This 500ml of a delicious, meaty, full, German beer is about as satisfying as I've encountered."
"Poured into a pint glass, it has a dark amberish color. Aromas of bananas and other fruits dominate the smell. Very smooth smelling beer, not a lot of bite to it. The taste matched the smell, very easy to drink. Wish it had more of a bite, but I liked it. I could see my fiance really liking this beer."
"Banana, clove, and yeast just about sums it up. Pours a dark hazy orange, the smell is banana clove and yeast and the taste follows suit. The most incredible part of the beer is the mouthfeel which is INCREDIBLY smooth. Those flavors wear me out, but a great example of the style."
"A great beer with lots of complexity. It goes down very well for a beer at 8.2%."
"D – This is always a winner."
"Can't appreciate the mouthfeel or drinkability of a beer that is so disagreeable. Strong, sure, but good? No. This tastes like a big hodgepodge of contradictory flavors."
"I do have to say, it is one of the best beers I've tasted so far. I would highly recommend getting some. I will be buying some every time I make a trip to the LCBO. I also got the Aventinus Eisbock. Can't wait to compare the two."
"Aventinus is a very impressive weizenbock. It tastes kind of like the love child of a really refreshing hefeweizen and a dark trappist quad."
"As I said, the beer as significantly heavy body, though not quite syrupy to me. Because of that (not to mention the stout ABV), I see this as more of a sipping beer."
"Value: Good deal for a fine German brew."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable, especially for its ABV. I would not hesitate to drink plenty of this again."
"I have ordered and purchased this beer many times but have never given much thought to why this is. It all comes together well."
"Over all we both enjoyed this beer immensely and will definitely recommend it to others"
"Overall, I like this beer... Is it something I would drink everyday? No but there is a time and place for it.. I enjoyed it..."
"Aging notes from this beer: Don't age it. I had a 2003 and it tasted awful. Oxidation notes don't work in this beer and at that point it was terribly oxidized. The fresh wheat and yeast notes make this beer work."
"cheers."
"D - a great beer that I think almost everyone, despite beer preference, should enjoy. No lie, It ALMOST reminds me of a dry champagne."
"D: good, stands alone great."
"Overall this was an excellent beer, it was very similar to a hefe except with the addition of the dark malts that add a wonderful complex flavor."
"All I can say about this brew is WOW! This is one of my favorites, it is a complete joy to drink. It has a great apperance and pours a deep amber to brown and offers a wonderful frothy head. This brew has a great full mouth feel and has a good after taste and a strong aroma. This is the best Doppelbock I have had."
"Nice thick body with plenty of carbonation but if there is one thing the age did to this beer is hurt it's drinkability. The flavors no longer mesh cleanly like they used to and all there is is over the top sweetness."
"Notes: One of the best examples of the common heard phrase that you can buy a world-class beer for a very reasonable price. Everyone should try this."
"This beer kicks major, major ass."
"Pours to a cloudy dark brown with a beautiful head that doesn't go away. Aroma of banana and cloves and almost like a bubblegum scent because of those notes. A little bit spicy. Taste has a hint of banana, cloves and the alcoholic taste sitting in the background but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is excellent, coating, fizzes up with minimal manipulation. Smooth and no aftertaste."
"M/D-pretty good level of carbonation with a medium heavy body though still very drinkable (purhaps due to it's delicious taste) but due to it's price, availability (i know of three places that have it in my vicinity) and higher abv its not really suited for an all night session but is WELL worth looking for everytime i go to these places i can't resist i have to get one without a doubt one of my top 5 beers"
"Cloudy amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma smells like a banana split.Taste is banana,sugar cane,caramel and a hint of cocoa.There is a nice warming effect from this brew.A good beer nothing negative to say about it.I recommend and would purchase again."
"D: Now I see why this is such a popular beer. I was a bit hesitant when trying this one out as I've never been the hugest fan of German brews, but this is perhaps a new favorite."
"THe feel is great and totally drinkable. A great beer."
"the essential dunkelweiss style weizenbock that hits all the bases. at first sort of base and dessert but after letting the beer sit for five minute with all the malt sediments pour it opened up. at first bubblegum liquid candy. simple dunkelwiess take. them some chocolate. at its best the noses was floral, plum sweet, and bubblegum/marzipan/rosewater. almost musky nose of stale chamomile. palate is crisp but mildly toasty. clove... burnt caramel with a hint of citrus styled closest to green orange peel skins. not bitter but mild... just subtle. quite toffee caramel. smokey burn quality gives it a sourness that is mild. when good... quite refreshing... and a culmination of very subtle hint of german palate. quite surprising abv. sort of noticeable in the nose but actually mellows out at the beer breaths."
"WIthout a doubt, one of the best beers around. Just superb."
"Since I first tried Aventinus a couple months ago, it's been one of my favorite beers. I prefer drinking strong beers and at 8.2% this one is perfect. It's surprisingly refreshing at such a high ABV. Tons of flavour, great feel and always leaves me feeling great after one bottle...not drunk, just nice. Extremely drinkable, though I don't think I could ever drink more than two."
"Full bodied and well carbonated for the style. Really good beer. Drink it sometime - and it is better in Germany."
"Overall - Simply outstanding."
"(D)- A good brew with a confusing smell. It might be a tad old perhaps? Very malty & filling though. One of these really sticks to you. I dont know how fresh or old this one actually is, but I would definitely have it again."
"I will review a fresh bottle at some point in the future, but for the time being people need to be warned that the ""vintage"" Aventinus is pretty bad."
"love it. best of all, you would never know this is an 8% beer."
"The 2003 alongside the fresh bottle was atrocious. Too oxidized, sherry notes but not enjoyable. Overly candied honey sweetness. Don't age this beer."
"I would buy this everyday if I could afford it."
"Mouthfeel is great. Full, rich, crisp, tingly."
"not alot to say about this one besides its just good."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into an Aventinus glass. White froth rises up and spits forth a beautiful aroma from the tiny, tiny bubbles comprising the head. Aroma is of banana/plantain?, dates, raisins, spices? and other sweet nectars. Amazing. Beautiful. Taste is of dark fruits, wheat, sweet malts and some peppery spice, I believe. Amazing that somehow 8.2% ABV is packed into this beer. Aventinus is just amazing in every way. Only one word can summarize this beer, delicious."
"Aventinus is one of those truly worldly beers. There's nothing quite like it. I've had it several times, including on-tap, and it's consistent and solid in every way."
"Overall a great beer. Just wish I was drinking it in Germany."
"Drinkability: Pretty high, actually. Amazing smells and flavors, perfect for a cool evening or desert; price was even reasonable at $4.20 a bottle; ABV is a bit high so it may prevent me from drinking more than one bottle, but it's too good to not drink. Easily understandable why this is a top 100 beer."
"Terrific bock that I would gladly pour again on a cold winter night as it warms the soul (and the body!). Complex and delicious, a good combo."
"D: awesome, especially for 8.2%.. alcohol not noticeable really at all, just great, smooth.. overall a great beer."
"The flavor is pretty representative of the smell: Loads of the classic phenolics, like banana, clove, vanilla and such. The malts are sweet, but somewhat subdued. The color made me expect more maltiness. Nice deep fruit flavors from the yeast as well. Mouth feel is full and creamy at first, then the carbonation bites through it nicely. This is a delicious, big, flavorful and complex brew, and it's not hard at all to get through a glass of it. Quite enjoyable."
"Honestly, superb!"
"A tasty warming beer that drinks really well for the alcohol content."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/17/09."
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with moderate carbonation. There's a substantial feel of the mini bubbles on the palate. Drinkability is dangerously drinkable. Absolutely delicious and smooth with no immediate taste of the 8.2% ABV. Can't have too many of these on a night. But nonetheless, one of the best German brews I've had."
"Serving: Bottle in a Weissbier glass."
"Overall a very nice beer. I could see cracking a few of these tonight."
"12/8/09: Tried this one again in a 500ml botttle. Poured dark copper with great carbonation & thick head. Smells of banana, vanilla/chocolate, & clove stuck out. Tasted like banana and cloves as well as dark & wheat malts. Very appealing w/tanginess and spicy character that hits the tip of your tongue. A very complex beer but worthy of anyone's attention."
"I love this genre of beer. This is more carbonated than what i like but the flavor is so good you will not know its a higher ABV. The smell is thick with malts with a hint of clove. Although the mouthfeel is more like champagne (very bubbly) the caramel malt flavor balances everything out. This has good drinkability but would not be my first choice for a weizenbock."
"This is a world class beer. The price is good. Availibilty here in MS is non-existant, but any time I make a trip to Louisiana, I will stock up on this elixer."
"Cheers"
"O: Great beer. I'm going to stock up ASAP."
"At first taste, the taste of banana is very strong. I don't care for bananas, so I found this to be a bit of a turn off. However, as you continue to drink it the banana flavor subsides and gives way leaving you with a wonder medley and sweet and bitter. By the final swig, it is smooth and sweat dessert."
"D: Crudweiser should be sued for false advertising, this is the true king of beers."
"Poured with a nice off white head, deep amber color. Very nice looking beer. The smell was of banana, clove up front, alcohol towards the back end. Taste was pretty delicious, even though I am not a big fan of clove, estery tastes, this was a pleasant beer to have. It almost tasted of banana bread, with the banana, spices, and wheat and yeast combining to give it a bready feel. It has a nice body, a bit syrupy as it warms. Citrusy finish that stays in the mouth for a while. Overall I did enjoy this beer, perhaps the size of the bottle was too much, a 12 0z size might be more enjoyable. I would recommend this to any beer enthusiast, no matter what your style of preference."
"Drink ability was good. Went through the bomber rather easily. For such a high abv beer it will definitely sneak up on you. Wish more breweries would brew this style of beer"
"Definitely a heavy hitter. I now see why this is the benchmark for the style."
"A great beer. Dark, rich and full-bodied. The Deep color is impressive with a fluffy white head that lingers and laces nicely on the glass. The rich dark fruit flavor is not overwhelming but nicely masks the high alcohol and lingers a bit with notes of banana on the after taste."
"This is one of my favorite beers. The flavor is sweet, there is no hop bitterness. You can pick up a little bit of sweetness from alcohol on the front end, but its not warming. Malt character makes the beer full bodied, thick, and hits the midpalate nicely. Drinkability is high, but due to high alcohol and overall heaviness of the beer, a slight deduction. I love this beer."
"Drinkability is good, but can be very filling."
"Overall an excellent Doppelbock...probably the best I've tasted. I'll be placing this in the cart more often..."
"My local bottle shop has a wrapped 2001 edition of this brew on the shelf. I have a feeling it has aged well and will be even more impressive than this offering. Excellent treat, this."
"Overall, a very tasty weizenbock. I'm not a huge fan of the style but this is a very good example. Recommend"
"best German beers I had until now. Thanks PapaEugene, please bring me some more next time!"
"D - not bad, better with something to eat. alone this beer is too much to have more than one (I'm having enough trouble finishing the pint). it's hard to be a big, complex beer while remaining drinkable. this is the top beer of this style as I write."
"D - Nice smooth easy drink would definately have more as this is really nice."
"A slight hoppiness and a rich, caramel malt structure really come out in the mouth. Finishes well, with a thin carbonation, great balance and a great creaminess."
"This tastes both as subtle and as complex as I remembered it to be. The additional months in the cooler have been kind to the beer and the flavors are still holding well."
"Let me say - you must try this beer."
"M&D- Medium-full bodied, slightly filmy and almost syrupy. Tasty and drinkable, the alcohol could sneak up on you if you aren't careful. A must try and ageable to boot."
"Drinkability: A very interesting beer. Extremely complex. All the fruity and spicy characteristics you would want out of a classic heffe but with the firm alcoholic robustness of a dopplebock, without tasting extremely angular and lager-like. A heavy beer though with a high ABV."
"Maybe the best wheat beer Ive ever had. deffinitly worthy of another purchase, and a good one to have in the fridge for any occassion really."
"Notes: Wow this is a remarkable Weizenbock. It is absolutely stunning. Prost."
"Cheers!"
"D- Highly drinkable and will go tomorrow for six more to keep and drink when the need for a real wheat beer is needed."
"D - High, as I find to be the case for wheat beers in general, particularly ones as tasty as this one."
"I had not one pint and not two of this not three or four either BUT 5 my friends yes!"
"D: I like this one a lot. A good marriage between a weizen and a dubbel. In my top 3 of favourite german beers."
"D I hope to partake of this beer throughout my time of treading the earth. I must say though, that the Draught House in Austin, TX makes a superior version. But, barring those infrequent excursions Aventinus is the go to representation of the style for those of us committed to home and hearth."
"D - Very drinkable for its strength. Sort of a mix between a hefe and a dubbel/quad. This was my first Aventinus, and I will definitely be adding this to the rotation!"
"D: I could see where I certain set of people would like this. Must be a bad bottle?"
"Taste: Bananas, cloves, and dark fruits. Bit of a spicy aftertaste. If I had to make a beer analogy I would say it's like a theoretical blend between a German weissbier and a Belgian dubbel."
"Ordered a bottle with dinner while at Craigie on Main in Cambridge. Presented by the bartender with an upside down pour into an Aventinus glass. When done right, this beer is quite a sight. The glass itself is quite a vessel to drink from. Huge white foamy head graced the top of the glass. Dark cloudy brown colored body. Has a spicy, dark fruit smell, almost like an aged rum. Very complex taste. Had all of the classic hefe flavors: banana, clove, bubble gum. Plus, the bock aspect of this beer really added a second layer of flavor - dark and malty. As one complete beer, it formed a champion of the style. Smooth on the palate, and very easy to drink despite its 8.20%. A wonderful beer by itself, or a perfect beer to pair with a nice meal."
"My first of this style and I like it. Not a big wheat fan, but I like the darkness and richness of this. Really easy and satisfying to drink. I would have this again."
"D - Fantastic. I could have more than one. I'd love to have more than one with a meal. This could pair really well with a variety of food, from entrees to dessert. And to wax philosophical for a moment, this is an example of why beer is great. This isn't a beer that's based on hype. It doesn't need hype. Food is timeless, and this is an example of why. And to note, my 4.5 is based on the fact that I've had more drinkable beers, including weizenbocks."
"Drinkability: This beer is easily poundable, but that would be a sin, wouldn't it? It goes down smooth, tastes balanced and good. The high abv can put some people under the table, so be careful. I actually prefer this in the bottle to on tap. Ive had many discussions with fellow beer tasters and we all agree as well. Something about a little time in the bottle makes this brew truly shine. My favorite beer. Bar none."
"I wouldn't have thought of it, but it's amazing how the light wheat combines with the smooth malt of a doppelbock."
"D- Unique, complex and tasty. The assertiveness of the spice and the ABVs make this a one at a time kinda beers."
"Gigantic off-white head over a cloudy brown body. Gobs of lace are left behind as the head slowly recedes. Smells of dark fruit, banana, spice, with hints of vanilla and caramel. The aroma is a little bit boozy. Deep banana flavour. Rich dark fruits in the finish, like sour plums. Spice. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, with a tangy finish. Solvent character comes forward in the nose as the beer warms, but remains muted in the taste. It's like I can sit here and come out, sip after sip, with something different each mouthful. A hint of raisin? Medium bodied and finely carbonated. Smooth, creamy, and a little bit syrupy. I love this beer. Such a huge flavour but drinks so easy. I should really buy this stuff more often."
"D - A good beer once you can get used to the overpowering clove taste."
"Certainly an epic brew."
"This was the first beer that blew me away as to just how complex and balanced beer can be. I come back to this over and over again as a touchstone for as close to perfect as it gets."
"Overall, I'd say this beer deserves it's reputation. It's great!"
"Definitely an all time BA top 100!"
"Had on tap previously and found to be overly malty and nondescript. Notably superior from the bottle."
"Drinkability is excellent. This beer goes down really easy for an 8+% ABV beer. Very tasty, but also really smooth. If this is still on sale for $2.49 the next time I go to the store, I'll grab some more. Classic German brew."
"D: Very drinkable. This was a fresh batch - much better than the bottle I last had in January."
"I love dopplebocks, I don't really care for hefeweizens, yet it is all the the hefeweizen characteristics that make this one a winner for me. A fantastic beer, but I find drinkability to bit low. Wouldn't want more than one, it starts to get a little too hefeweizen-y for my tastes towards the end (it is a 500ml bottle). Great beer though, and one I will seek out again."
"Taste is just as fantastic with more emphasis on chocolate than most of the style. Alcohol is displayed at a noticeable, but not overpowering level and accentuates the damp wheat flavors. Yeasty esters are there aplenty as well, with the banana coming through a bit more than the cloves. Mouthfeel is lively and effervescent, falling somewhere around medium. Vitus comes close, but this is the king of weizenbocks for me. Super delicious beer, cant wait till the next one."
"buy this whenever you see it if you want to drink a great one."
"D- This baby is a clove bomb! Not really my preferred style but certainly a good beer worth trying."
"D- Overall, this is a very good brew that is definitely recommended. I would highly recommend seeking this out on-tap, very tasty!"
"D : Always room for more"
"This beer is an old favorite of mine and one that's been around before bars had a huge selections available. More of a winter drinker but the wheat aspect really make it a three season beer. Typically served in a heffe glass, the full 20 ounces can really put you away. Be careful with this one but enjoy."
" gets balanced out nicely with the spice and dryness of the brew. The mouthfeel hangs on well between sips and the finish is dry with just a bit of the malty chewiness that you would expect from a doppelbock. A nicely done brew and worth picking up."
"A fat three finger head jumps to the top of my duvel glass. It has big light tan swiss cheese like bubbles that fade slowly and leave no lace. Body is a deep brown tone that has tones of burgundy when held to light. Nose is a beautiful mix of abrupt wheat and yeast with a balance of sweet malt and rich dark fruits. This beer brings a lot to the plate with the flavor profile. The wheat feel is big and rustic while being crisp. Yeasty maltyness carries with it graham cracker sweetness and an array of dark bold fruits including some raisin and fig notes. Mouthfeel is very full and much like sweet bread, overall very nice. Alcohol at 8.2% is perfectly hidden. This is a very nicely drinkable Doppelbock."
"D: I keep going back and forth on this beer. Sometimes, it's one of my favorite beers of all time. Other times, it's undrinkably cloying. It really does have a whole lot going on, though, and every serious beer afficionado should try it at least once."
"The drinkablility is great, especially at 8.2% ABV."
"D Great drinkability. I drank the entire 0.5L Weizen glass before I even knew it."
"It's a joy to drink, a truly delicious beer, and at 8.2% ABV you could feel joyous all too quickly. This is definitely a beer to savour over the course of an hour."
"D - Very easy to drink, not too heavy, but it can be deceiving. I could have a couple of these in one sitting, but nothing more than that. Overall, a very good Weizenbock. Will definitely get this again on my next trip to the store."
"Overall, I knew this was rated as one of the top 100 beers on earth according to BA and it serves well. This is a complex beer that I really enjoyed."
"D: The flavor is solid, there is very little alcohol flavor...the only thing is that i'm not crazy about the style, but this beer does a pretty good job of trying to alter my opinion"
"Notes: I hope I did this beer justice. I am new to the game but have had a pretty wide variety of beers, but this one stands out as the one that really opened my palate and got me into really enjoying beer."
"D - Decidedly complex beer, that offers up more spice than most. It is definitely unique in the flavours, in a positive way. This is not a beer that you can knock back one after another, it has to be savoured, and the entangled mosaic of flavours truly appreciated."
"D- Moderate to high, depending on your affinity for the dopplebocks/weizenbocks. I loooove this beer."
"Absolutely delicious and wonderfully delightful, a wonderful mélange of rich maltiness with spicy Weizen yeast characteristics and a bit of boozy alcohol, which is never overpowering on the palate but plays with the head, leaving that mellow swimmy nature that comes with it. The classic Weizenbock simply doesn't disappoint, and only gets better with freeze-distillation. I'd like to see how this one changes with age."
"Pours a brown color, a light brown color with an off white foamy 2 finger head. Smell and taste are both very malty, with bananas, vanilla, cloves, and chocolate. The flavor has a nice sweetness to it. The 8.2 % alcohol is well hidden. Full bodied, rich and creamy with good carbonation. I could drink this beer over and over again."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in an Aventinus glass a murky dark orange with a very nice two-finger head that lasts as a thin layer but leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma is a decent amount of dried fruits with hints of yeast, dark malt and leather. The taste is a wonderful balance of dried fruits, spices, clove and slight cocoa. The beer is somewhat light with very well hidden alcohol and decent carbonation. This is quite simply as good as a Weizenbock gets, especially on-tap!"
"Was very impressed with this on draft...very fresh!!!"
"Overall, by far the best doppelbock I have had yet. Great drinkability especially for the abv. I wish I had more of this beer. I will have it in the fridge in the future."
"The beer has faint wheat smell mixed with alcohol and fruitiness. Excellent complex flavor, a quick burst of caramelized fruit, reminiscent of cotton candy, that fades quickly into spicy smooth wheat with hints of alcohol. The finish is fantastic and keeps you coming back for more. I was taken back the first sips by the sweet fruitiness up front, but it mellows so quickly on your palate that you miss it. Quite an experience to drink but I would probably only have one per sitting."
"This is marvelous. I haven't had many authentic versions of this style but I would say that this comes out on top for authenticity and drinkability."
"Aventinus has earned its reputation as a unique, world-class beer. Still, I was not swept away the first time I tried it, nor the second, nor the third. I had heard and read about people aging it; the claims that it evolves and matures into an even higher beer and so I thought I'd give it a shot. Three years later I could not be any happier I did. It really does become a different beer, stock the cellar and find out for yourself. Trust me!"
"A lovely, evenly balanced, and yet still largely wheaty doppelbock. Simple and complex, all at the same time, which translates as just good, good stuff. The hefty ABV does well to keep its normally intrusive head down, which is another example of the old-school brewers knowing their way around the different aspects that make up their beer. Yeah, they get it."
"this is what every dunkelweiss or weizenbock beer should strive to be."
"but the drinkability is still awesome with added complexity. Wow!"
"The progenitor of the style, which serves as a baseline/standard for other brewers to aspire to (or potentially surpass)."
"D- Good. Easy down the gullet."
"Had this on tap at the Tap House and Grill in Norfolk. Wow, what a great beer. Poured into an Aventinus glass. Appears a nice dark copper color with a thick head. Aroma full of spice, caramel, clove and banana. The taste is amazing. Very smooth even with the high carbonation. The taste had everything that the aroma had and it was very well balanced. The alcohol is well hidden. It ends by starting sweet and then ending with a good amount of bitterness. A great beer. A great way to start the night."
"D- Definitely a beer that everyone should try. A classic and worthy of the respect it has gained in the beer world. I however and this personal taste would be done after one 500ml bottle due it being a bit on the spicy side for a more than one a night beer."
"On first sip, this beer grabbed me. I liked it right away but after a few sips the sweetness got to me. It is very thick and syrupy and all I could think of was Dr. Pepper. Once the thought of Dr. Pepper was in my head thats all I could taste and I could barely finish it. I would not get this one again."
"The alcohol is pretty expertly masked given the ABV, though it's certainly there and will kick your face in if you're not expecting it. Very drinkable otherwise."
"Poured a cloudy, very cloudy ruddish brown color with a HUGE carbonation resluting in a big pillowy white head. Nose is wheat, clove,sticky. Taste is wheat, clove, banana, thick and coating. Mouthfeel is nice and drinkable. Overall this is a great beer I could drink alot of."
"I could drink this and drink this and drink this...amazing beer."
"M/D - a bit too sweet for my tastes, malty but medium bodied and light mouthfeel"
"This beer has many flavors and is one of my favorites. Remember, it is a dark beer. So, if you don't like dark beers, this may not be for you."
"D: Overall, very delicious and refreshing. I look at it two ways. Its either an extremely refreshing dopple for the summer or a malty dunkel weis for the winter. Very good beer."
"I'm not disappointed though, of course. I've tried a delicious beer and puckering though it be, I could drink this all night."
"D: A very big tasty wheat beer. Very complex and quite delicious."
"D- So easy drinking and smooth. Complex flavors and aromas and the great mouthfeel to boot."
"D - Supremely enjoyable - perfect for any time of the year. Such a versatile brew to pair with food - it could go equally well with dessert, chocolate, less spicy Mexican food, roast duck breast, or even with pancakes and breakfast sausage. This is an absolute joy to drink, and is now firmly entrenched as one of my favorite German brews."
"A: Soft cottony head, twice the amount of foam to beer from a medium pour, the color of a muted sun tea - 4.50, S: Cloves dominate the nose, some soft bubblegum aromas, yeasty and bready, the faintest hint of banana, wonderful aroma - 4.50, T: A touch on the tart side, a little cidery, quite dry and almost puckering, alcohol is evident but not aggressively, the clove on the nose also comes through on the tongue, a slight taste of fruit cake - 4.25, M: Creamy and silky - 4.50, D: A wonderful beer, not sure how much of it I could drink but this one really establishes a standard for Weizenbocks - 4.00"
"Nicely bodied and well carbonated. Very enjoyable to drink, the alcohol is well masked and does not come through at all."
"MF&D - aforesaid, the taste of the beer is great once you get to it. but the carbonation muddles everything up! the flavours are good and some times too sweet, but the carbonation has to click it down...way down so that I can taste the beer in all stages of drinking."
"It poured a dark-medium brown with a finger and a half of foam. The aroma was a bit fruity with caramel and a bit of a cinnamon/nutmeg. The taste was similar with the banana more prominent. The weight was in the heavy-medium area. SUPER SMOOTH ! I had no problems downing 1.2 a liter of this brew, even after a Spaten Oktoberfest. I have to admit I needed a nap afterwards."
"cheers"
"This is the first wheat-doppelbock I've come across, but it seems to do a great job of balancing out the hefeweizen and doppelbock traits. It's fruity and sweet, but not cloyingly so. Banana and cloves are present, but not dominant. It even has some similarities to the tripel style, which earns it brownie points in my book. A truly amazing beer to be sure, and one that will call me back time and again."
"D - A wonderfully rich and complex beer.."
"D - Delicious tasting beer. I had been waiting a long time to try this and it was well worth the wait. Loving the 8.2% abv!"
"*Try a sip of this beer before you add the yeast from the bottom of the bottle to experience more of the hop flavor. It is a different brew!!"
"This is a great beer. It's somewhat simple and quite complex at times. Better when it's cool to warm."
"D: There is a bit of alcohol warming that happens from this one that makes you slow down a bit. However, there are many weizenbocks that are more aggressive than this one."
"Pours brown in color. There's about three to four inches of off white head sitting atop the beer. Looks amazing in the glass. Smell is some wheat and caramel. Taste is more of the caramel and toffee notes. There is just a hint of roastiness coming in at the end of each sip. This is super smooth and incredibly easy drinking. This is nothing short of world class. Incredibly balanced and full of flavor. I could drink a lot of these and never complain."
"D- A great beer, very drinkable but I start feeling full of malts and sugar after a while."
"D: Could drink this all day, great flavor and the alcohol doesn't come out at all."
"drinkability- smooth, extremely yeasty. overall a great beer that could use more head and less yeast"
"I quite enjoy this, but since Vitus is cheaper and more readily available, I will pick it up more often. I think I prefer it slightly anyway."
"Creamy and smooth. Goes down with ease. A little more bite from the carbonation than I would have liked, but thats pretty much my only knock on drinkability. Alcohol is all but non-existent. I really like this brew. It doesn't look like much, but it's packed with flavor. I'm very impressed with this one, something that I will be purchasing again."
"Perhaps a little too carbonated, for the body is light and disappears quickly. The abv is well-hidden, only a faint touch of warming lingering low."
"Overall - I'm not sure if this one is as high a level in my mind as it is on everyone else's lists, but it's definitely a good beer."
"D: Off the charts. Wish I had more than the one bottle in front of me right now. A truly great beer!"
"This beer overall is like the cola flavored Fizz candies. Carbonated, ethereal and should be dispensed at the candy shop, it will lick the malty lollipop."
"D - Fantastic German-style Weizenbock that is a true representation of the style. I mean, it is Germany's original wheat Dopplebock ale, right?"
"While it's a very nice Doppelbock, I was really hoping for more from this."
"A great beer that frequently is an impulse buy when I go beer shopping. One of these days I need to go and pick up the official Aventinus glass to give this beer its proper due."
"50cl bottle. Hazy deep brown with a big head that dies and leaves some thin foam. Tried to go for the massive head in the pic, but apparently I wasn't anal enough about cleaning my glass... oh well, it happens. Aroma of caramelized bananas, like bananas fried until a dark brown color. Add a little bubble-gum, nut liquer, and clove spice, and you have a pretty sweet aroma happening. The flavor has a rich caramel quality, with bubble-gum sweetness, bread, and a hint of alcohol. Banana and clove are their, but don't manifest as assertively as in the aroma. full bodied with the same effervescent carbonation that you would find in a regular hef. Something about this just doesn't quite work for me. It's OK, but more subtle bubbles would work better for me. I like how smoothly the wheat character blends in with the rich caramel components. Good stuff."
"D: works for me I reviewed on the 2nd one good stuff"
"D: It feels almost like this beer isn't sure what it wants to be. Very heavy tastes, but a medium body and high carbonation. The flavors blend very well, but it's heavy enough on the tongue that a single one of these is enough to induce palate fatigue. I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this but was progressively less enthused on the rest."
"D - Drinkability is off the charts for 8.2%. What a refreshing beer, and on this hot night it's perfect. The alcohol is noticeable, but the beer is so crisp and sweet I'm struggling to sip, with a strong urge to chug."
"Awesome. A bit sweet, but complex, refreshing, and very unique. There's nothing I've had to date that I could compare this to."
"Nice tingeling with every sip, yet a very smooth mouthfeel."
"Brew was brought to me in a Aventinus glass and was poured pefectly. With the head just below the rim of the glass and with an off white to brown color. Aroma was of Dark fruits with a malty background. The Weizenbock it self looked like Cola brown with copper accents swirling threw it. Taste will have you take a step back abit. The dark fruit flavors and Complex Malts are made dominant due to the carbonation and Alcohol. The taste is just amazing and it does not feel like brew that would weigh you down and allows you to keep drinking. Carbonation is not over done but the Alcohol level may sneak up on you. Great beer and will have to keep a few in the beer fridge."
"Overall an excellent beer. Still a little bit of heat present after one year of cellaring. I've got a few more in the cellar which will be tasted a few years from now. Cheers everyone!"
"A+++."
"Pours a cola brown with a thick, rich foamy head. Great aroma of cloves, spices, and a slight hint of bananas. Nice clove taste and bubblegum...Someone was dead-on when they said they tasted Marmite in it. Spicey finish. Drinkablity is average. I would rather drink a ton of lighter-bodied hefe's than something like this."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: The carbonation is a little much and I'm surprised by how prevalent the alcohol is given that the abv isn't that high."
"Notes - this was a perfect partner of this colder spring evening in colorado. i was actually expecting a lot from this beer seeing as though it is spoke of so highly, and fortunately for me i did not set the bar too high, as those expectations were greatly surpased."
"D- Sooo drinkable, seriously buy as much of this beer as you can, you will never find another in this style that will be as good as Aventinus."
"4.5 D: Very drinkable for a weizenbock due to the low level of sweetness."
"Drinkability: Recommended. An exemplary weizenbock full of fine complexities to savor and indulge in."
"This beer is the originator of its style, and, as such, is a standard in a small but exceptional selection of beers, but I'll get into raving about the characteristics I find in this beer when I have time to write a review on the Schneider Weisse."
"Good mouth feel and body. I'll prob come back to this one, but meanwhile, too many beers...too little time."
"Overall, an excellent weizenbock. I don't know how much that means, with Aventinus being my first one, but man was this tasty. I thought the appearance was the highlight of this brew. Found the sweet malts a little bit too sweet, but nothing offending. I will probably be buying another one of these down the road after I sample a few other weizenbocks. Maybe then will I truly appreciate how good this weizenbock is compared to others."
"Both bottles were wonderful. Highly recommended."
"D: An impressive hybrid in my opinion. I'll buy more of it. Not a good session beer at 8.2% ABV, but good for a nice one-off now and again. Serious stuff!"
"D: Very drinkable for a 8.2% beer. I'd say this is more drinkable than most doppelbocks out there."
"D: Did I mention this is incredibly refreshing? Each sip throws out new and different characteristics. I look forward to more weizenbocks!"
"D: Tasty and very flavorful, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a style that is difficult for me to figure out because I find such diversity in the beers that I've had in it, but this beer is definitely one of the best Weizenbocks I've had. This is a very good beer to drink for a long time."
"I'm usually skeptical about beers on the top 100 due to the fact that I believe most are just considered great because no one can get them. This stuff really, really, really good."
"Outstanding its worth the experience to track it down."
"D- Definitely drinkable. Might have to limit myself to one or two."
"This was a really nice surprise. I'm not at all familiar with this style so forgive me if I say it reminds me a bit of Chimay Blue. I have had this sitting in the cellar for some time and was never motivated to crack it open, but I'm sure glad I did!"
"A very good, interesting, and complex beer. It's got a lot going on. It does have a sweetness, stickiness of the banana that just hangs around too much to make me really love it. Still, an excellent beer, and a great style."
"Overall, an world class beer. Most highly recommend. I had one of these for the first time several years back and it was awful. At the time, it was my first weizenbock so I assumed it was the style. I'd have several weizenbocks since then that were good but had been avoiding this one till now. So glad that I finally gave it another shot. My last try must have been a seriously bad bottle. I still remember the horrid aroma and bitter taste. Now that I've had the real thing, it will be a major player in the rotation."
"Whether it's fresh or aged 8 years, this beer is still great. One of my all-time favorite beers. It's amazing how different the beer is when it matures and the yeast settles out."
"drinkability: The alcohol is just too extreme to enjoy more than one."
"Overall: Very drinkable, the alcohols is hardly noticeable, great flavors, I think that each time I drink this stuff I will find something else in the flavor or smell."
"Notes: BJCP history for this style tells me that ""Aventinus, the world's oldest top-fermented wheat doppelbock, was created in 1907 at the Weisse Brauhaus in Munich using the 'Méthode Champenoise' with fresh yeast sediment on the bottom. It was Schneider's creative response to bottom-fermenting doppelbocks that developed a strong following during these times", and I feel blessed to be able to drink ""the original"". Whether or not that means this is the best is up for debate, but only time (and me drinking more Weizenbocks) will tell. If you're a big fan of wheat beers or of any of the similar styles, be sure to give this one a try."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all day long. This is a beer that really opened my eyes to what a beer could be."
"Drinkability is good. Lighter in body because of the wheat, but with just a bit of warming alcohol."
"While I definitely enjoyed my first Aventinus, I have to admit that I was expecting something a bit different after reading all the rave reviews. It's an excellent beer (one that I will almost certainly seek out and review again) but not one of my favorites at the moment."
"D: It's snowing outside, and I'm home from work watching flakes swirl through the air and rain down upon the ground. My beer and I are safe and warm inside the house. I'm thoroughly enjoying its company."
"A drinkable brew, though not as much as the hefes by this same brewery. Worthy of purchase."
"D--Definitely a top not weizenbock, although personally I would reach for the eisbock version of this 9 times out of 10."
"Overall - pretty damned scrumptious"
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Revisiting this beer after a long hiatus. Pours a gold to brown with a strong, tall light brown head. purple hues. Smells of banana, cherries, wheat, malt and yeast. Flavor is nice and banana-y, with a wheaty tang and a little hop bitterness mixing with a dry barley-malt. A bit over-dry and metallic on the finish, but this doesn't hurt the beer much. Medium to full bodied. Drinks excellently, a top quality dopplebock."
"Feel - smooth on the tongue with a very nice hearty finish"
"D - I'm not a huge fan of hefeweizens, and I had my doubts about how much I would like this beer. But I found it to be a hugely complex and flavorful brew, but not overpowering in any one way. I'm very impressed & I'll definitely be picking up more in the future."
"Drinkability is good. Very good beer."
"D, i enjoy this beer, i do find this very drinkable , have some toast with jam relax and watch a movie ."
"Taste is very creamy and smooth, very soft in the mouth as well, the creaminess sort of gets in the way of the taste ironically enough, eventually the good malt backbone comes through with a large amount of dark fruits and the aforementioned banana."
"Nice dark red/purple color with a fair amount of fizzy tan head. Smell is some wacky combination of licorice, orange, lemon, pepto bismol, cinnamon, and pepper. More licorice and pepper in the taste, but cloves is definitely the spice that starts to come out strongest as the beer wears on. Very drinkable and interesting. I'm fairly new to this style but I enjoy this one."
"Nice little bubbles. Fizzy at first, but after some swirling the texture is silky smooth. Good drinkability despite the solventy esters."
"Overall I am really enjoying this beer. Delicious!"
"Very nice color of amber... good... slightly cloudy, with a decent ring left, not a lot of head. Smells like it should. Taste pretty freaking good. Malty, sweet, hints of something I can't put my finger on... Fairly easy to drink. I'd drink a couple."
"Pair with: dessert. cinnamon."
"Enough carbonation in this one to keep the palate clean. So much going on, but incredibly drinkable. Finished the 1 pint+ bottle wishing I bought another. Fantastic beer."
"Drinkability - Exceedingly drinkable. Great rich, chocolately flavor with the refreshing nature of a wheat beer make this amazingly drinkable."
"picked up one of the pint bottles for $4.99 - poured into a tulip glass - good bready /citrus aroma with a fair amount of carbonation and leaves some nice lacing - incredibly complex and extremely well balanced - i had to take my time with this one as it was going down too easy -it wants to be savored - even better as it warmed - i wish i had another one - next time - real good stuff."
"Overall this is a great beer, I love this style, it is very soft but yet very complex. Great malt and hop character and the wheat does wonders. All the ingredients play well together in this brew."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy, amber color. The two fingers of beige head displayed great retention and very good lacing. The aroma was rather sour, busy and slightly sweet; wheat, alcohol, toffee, spices and some fruity esters. The flavors were just plain outstanding and shocking in how balanced they were compared to the sour aroma. I tasted rich malts, wheat, alcohol heat, nuts, caramel, toffee, dark fruits in the esters, hints of chocolate malt and spices. Outstanding complexity and drinkability for 8%. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation perfect. This was definitely the best Weizenbock I had ever tasted and speaking purely in terms of flavor, one of the best beers I've ever had. A must try!"
"OVERALL: Very drinkable and very enjoyable for sure. This is definitely loads better and more interesting than their original hefeweizen. Only the look kept it from being a massive smash. I'd definitely pick up more of these, and I will probably age a few to see how they turn out. World class brew."
"From a 1 pint bottle into a weizen glass. The bottle was cold when purchased and I let it set a good 35 minutes before opening. Aventinus poured a lovely deep mahogany into the glass. The 2 inch foamy head was thick, rich and slightly off white. It settled after a while to the thickness of a couple of quarters. Oh my, the beautiful aroma hit seconds after the cap came off and before I even tipped the bottle. The chocolate vanilla, banana, clove and rich malts danced in my head. The taste does not disappoint. One can easily pick up the malts, creamy chocolate and wheat. She is properly carbonated for the style and the ingredients God supplied. The sweetness of the beer dances in your mouth and goes down ever so smoothly. A wonderful beer for a cold night, or anytime. Extremely drinkable. Perfect in every way."
"Very easily drinkable. Alcohol is quite well-hidden. Very good balance, overall."
"Pours a cola color with orange peekoo highlights. Pretty quick head, but good bubbling. Nice ring o' foam. Wheaty bananas and cloves mixed with some faint caramel malts and a little bubblgum. Some light sugar water drizzled over soe cooked bananas and hot breakfast cereal, mad mostly of wheat. Lots of cloves with maybe a few pruins. The alcohol adds to the fruity flavors of this beer, but cuts some of the yeasty flavors away. The alcohol also adds a nice long warming linger to the flavor and palate. Would almost taste and feel sessionble until the beer warms up. But the alcohol is no overwhelming in the least."
"D: I picked one up casually on the way home from work and now I'm legally unable to drive back and get a couple more for a while. That's the only problem I have with it, I guess. Extremely more-ish for a beer with such a pronounced alcohol character."
"A very good beer. Complex and refreshing. Well worth the price and hunting it down."
"I bought this on recommendation from one of my residents, who had overflowing praise. I came in a little bit skeptical, because that's just the way I take other people's recommendations. I enjoyed it, though."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for such a high abv. Tasty beer, a few pints of this would be awesome. Highly recommended. A beer that I will try to have on hand."
"D: A good beer and certainly regarded as the classic of the style. One of the best weizenbocks I've had for sure. Strong, tasty flavours make this a sipper, space it out over an hour and enjoy."
"Purchased at a local liquor store out of sheer curiosity and was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I unknowingly had a glass from the brewery from a previous trip to Bruisin' Ales that just happened to be the only glass large enough to hold the beer. I have not had any Weizenbocks before this so I did not know what to expect. It had a sweet taste and quite a bit of head which left some nice lacing on the glass as I drank it down. During my last trip to Bruisin' Ales I picked up a 2004 bottle of the Aventinus to try side by side against a regular bottle of it to see how it changes as it is aged."
"For those who have not tried it and are skeptical about its universal round of applause: yes, Aventinus really is all that! It pours an extremely cloudy spectrum that ranges from a hazy yellow at the thinnest points in the glass to an impenetrable brown at its deepest, with a big, frumpy, tan head standing on top of it all. Its aromas span the spectrum of straightforward wheatiness at one end to complex dark fruits and spices at the other. Yeastiness also comes through loud and clear on the nose, as it does on the palate. Dark fruits including prunes, raisins, and berries, along with a nice toastiness and yeasty softness all blend on together in perfect harmony. For the past 5 years I've been having perhaps two or three of these per year. No matter how many beers in the same or approximate categories that I try, Aventinus remains one of my all-time favorites."
"The paradigm for the style. It has all the attributes of a hefe and a bock in the same glass. At the same time it takes each to a new level in brewing."
"Turbid, brown body with a fizzy off white head that subsides quickly, minimal lace. Smell is very savory, vanilla, apple, clove, cocoa and banana. Tastes much bigger than the aroma with a nice bubblegum/banana-clove-vanilla quality up front, followed by gingerbread and an almost vinuous chalky smooth, dry finish. Medium mouthfeel with a ton of carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. One of the finest beers out there. Outstanding."
"Very intense taste. The wheat jumps out at first, but the banana and vanilla sit in the back of the throat. The aftertaste is too much, but I respect the uniqueness of this beer."
"Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. Alcohol is mostly hidden but does start to come through near the end. I probably wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting, but this might be worth picking up again some other day."
"As a fan of hefeweizens and good malt beers, Aventinus should not be overlooked. It is well priced and worth the money."
"D-Just one of two."
"Drinks very well for the abv and the style probably couldnt do more than a few bombers without being on my ass but amazing never the less"
"Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thin white head that fades. Smells of sweet wheat. Tastes of a brown ale and dopplebock characteristics. Good clean wheat and a smooth nutty flavor, but sweet. Mouth is great, a nice rich texture goes down perfectly. A close second to Victory Weizen Bock"
"Nice dark brown color and white head. Head leaves very quickly and provides an easy to drink well carbonated beer. Enough about the feel, color and smell! What a great beer! Get some german cheese, some crackers and have at it. This one will always have a shelf in my fridge. I love it and think that it goes very well with German food. It just tastes like Germany. Enjoy!"
"Brew poured into a Weihenstephan weizen glass. Has a nice deep brown color with a fair sized light tan head that had fair retention which left nice lacing. The aroma is very nice, fresh fruit (highlighting Lemon), clearly banana (guess that would be a fruit but it is a different aroma than the fruit that I pick up), whole wheat bread and cloves. The flavors are clear and simply excellent. Rich sweet malt flavor with a slight chocolate and vanilla hint (upfront), clearer clove and banana flavors mixed with an inviting alcohol taste at the tail end. Spiciness sticks around at the back of the mouth for a bit. Nice amount of carbonation plays well with the flavors. This is a very tasty brew but IMO dangerous as it goes down very easily but I am already feeling (empty stomach) it. Very nice brew and for the price you can not beat it."
"Interesting, not somthing I'll seek out again, but definatly good to try."
"I will tell you first off all that I am not even a fan of wheat beer but this is good. Try it you wont be disappointed even if your not a huge fan of wheat beer. Good buy and a good treat."
"wowie zowie. this is a keeper. sweet estery malty aroma. clove, banana, sweet but not too. refreshing subtle bitterness cuts the sweet making it eminently drinkable. no idea how they hide 8.2% so well. clove is subtle, plays well with the hops to cut the sweetness. this is truely a great beer and proves why six generations of schneider have been making this beer the same way."
"Drinkability- I will definitely consider getting this beer again, it is a very good beer. Though it isn't a great after dinner beer, so don't make my mistake."
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Almost cloudy dark amber color, ton of yeast in bottom of bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Caramel nose. Flavor is sweet yeasty caramel, clean finish. Cellars well, brewed 2004. $6.75 for a 500ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"Still very drinkable, but not as much as Weihenstephaner."
"You could say it has an attractive amber-brown color but it's as murky as murky gets, bubbles highly visible though and pours with a healthy amount of head, looks serious in intent. Sweet spice laden nose emphasizing clove and nutmeg, malty in a dry way with more carob than chocolate, nice orange citrus reduction notes, dried apple and pear fruit scents, cherry too. Medium-bodied with a great deal of agility, never once feels as if it has soaked into your palate until it has. More of that clove and anise spice, good deal of carbonation keeps any given flavor from achieving dominance. The fruit lowered in favor of wheat, half-baked bread although more banana here. Almost banana bread. The maltiness is not outsized, more textural than flavor oriented. Admirable persistence through the finish."
"Tasty!"
"D- Although i would like to see these in bombers i believe the 500ml is the perfect size for this beer, i could drink two. A great price for a great dopple/weizen bock. after finishing i concluded that this was in the top three for this style for sure and one of my favorites from Germany"
"D - delicious and alcohol is not noticable. drink em back if you can handle the sweetness"
"Reviewed 5/4/2006 (500mL bottle): Pours a huge slightly tan head, big bubbles, quickly diminishing, good lacing. Brown/reddish in color, small carbonation bubbles. Strong aroma of dark fruit, plum, some malts, lots of different aromas. Light fruit taste, perfume, smooth aftertaste, slight alcohol. Reminds me a lot of a abt quad. Tasty, but alcoholy."
"D--Again, ABV shocks me. MAYBE a bit warming by the end of 1st bottle. Very drikable."
"Good brew. Complex flavor and nose, does have a bit of a strong alcohol taste. Really distinctive feel. This is one to sit down and enjoy. This is a quality quaff."
"Pours a murky dark ruby brown in color (though it can be as light as a dark amber depending upon the point in the glass) with about two fingers of moussy, long-lasting light tan head. Aroma is quite complex and very intriguing. There is lots of bready malt, spicy clove and vanilla phenols, lots of dark fruit esters, some banana-like esters and a touch of perfume-like (roses) alcohol. Taste is much like the aroma. Lots of bready malt, some melanoidins, and a soft wheat undertone. There may be a good bit of malt character here (both wheat and barley) but the focus is the yeast character. The dark fruit esters (think plums, prunes and maybe raisins) are a bit more restrained in the flavor than the aroma but still present. The phenols range from clove to indistinct spicyness to hints of vanilla. The esters that are a bit more prominent are those classic to weissbiers: banana with just a mere hint of bubblegum. Alcohol is again present but it again lends a pleasant flavor component without being overwhelming. Mouthfeel is pretty good, body is a bit on the light side at only medium and carbonation is moderate. Alcohol is noticeable but its presence adds to the depth of flavor and isn't at all hot or solventy. Drinkability is pretty darn good. This brew is complex but nicely balanced and fairly nuanced."
"I poured from a 500 ml glass into a weizen glass. It pours an amber to brown color with a massive head. The head retreats rather quickly with no lacing. The first thing I noticed on the nose was a weak hint of cloves. This was quckly replaced by a candy smell, with some alcohol kicked in. The flavor is ripe fruit with alcohol and caramel notes. The beer is medim bodied and highly carbonated. the beer is very drinkable and the best wheat beer I have tried to date."
"D: I found this to have a good drinkability but in moderation as the alcohol content packs a punch. Very flavorful and interesting to drink."
"D-Very drinkable, though not to excess, you'll fall over."
"I think this beer is a great beer with amazing attributes and very drinkable. I would drink this any day of the year. Cheers!"
"D - Very good example of a german bock, with a nice kick"
"Comes out of the tap an opaque chocolate brown with a fine bubbled pale tan head. Very appetizing malty and chocolaty aroma is slightly sweet. Rich, malty, smoky flavor has chocolate undertone and nutty and molasses hints, and just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is smooth and tingly, giving a pleasing finish."
"D- Very drinkable. A great representation of the style. Keep an eye out for the alcohol as it will take you by surprise."
"Notes - Pretty tasty, sometimes I misspell the name of this one."
"This poured a murky copper to brown in color with a moderate extremely bubbly head that dissipated quickly. The nose is semi-sweet and filled with banana, wheat, malt and chocolate with a touch of raisin and spice. In the mouth it was medium-bodied, rich and concentrated showing the sweetness from the mouth. This had great balance with fresh carbontaion and a lingering finish. There is nothing out of place in this one it is just enjoyable from beginning to end."
"Well it took about 4 years but I finally got my first 5 across the board! This beer pours a cloudy dark amber.... almost dirty looking with a very creamy white head and tons of lacing. The smell is of bananas. The taste is so smooth I just kept wanting more! There was a huge banana flavor matched with a wonderful malt base with some hints of toasted malts, everything is perfectly balanced in this brew. The mouthfeel was incredibly creamy and the carbonation level was perfect. Wow such an incredibly drinkable brew, I yearn for more, now I know what my next on tap suggestion is for my local establishments."
"A good change of pace beer. It is a bit difficult to find where this beer will fit in. It's not a session beer, and with 0.5l bottles it's not an apéritif or an interest beer."
"Worthy of is following. A great beer to reach for when you want something different."
"I look forward to comparing this German classic to some of my favorite holiday doppelbocks. I will definitely pick up some Aventinus again."
"OK, this is getting to be a bit much for me. How is it possible that I find similarities in three beers in a row? The color, here, is different. But the taste... Yeah. Nutty and malty, for sure, but some of that same brown sugar taste (not the sweet part). Fine mouthfeel. I'm just not interested today. I've got to go and grab something good - to make sure that it's not just an off day for me!"
"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color, hugely effervescent, with a fizzy two-fingered light tan head that resists fading. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is an aggressive combination of sweet malty caramel and spices that suggest a full bodied beverage is on its way. Well carbonated and spicy, the medium-full bodied mouth feel is creamy and complex...in a way that compliments the flavors nicely. The taste is a mirror of the nose and an element of cloves adds a minty complexity that lingers nicely. The 8% ABV warms gently...a real nice drinker. Recommended."
"D: The abv is very well hidden making this very drinkable, just don't let it catch up to you. A full spectrum of flavor, well rounded and a very nice drink all around. A softer state of carbonation would of sealed the deal here."
"YUMMY YUMMY in my TUMMMY! Again sweet malts up front. Such complexity in this brew. Also a great blend of citrusy goodness with some bannana. Alcohol has a great warming effect."
"Overall - So this is the original wheat doppelbock? A very good beer made by an excellent brewery. Although I do like the eisbock more, this is definitely a must try beer. I'm excited to see what a few years of cellaring will do to this baby."
"Tastes as wonderful as it looks, less sweet than I would have thought, but still full of the great citrus tastes I smelled. Slightly sweet malt on the forward pallet, and then on the second sensation, the fruit sweetness kicks in. Banana, cherry, what might be plum, all accompanied by a slick, coating mouthfeel. A little bit sticky, though. No bitterness to speak of at any stage, nor any hint of the alcohol content. There is seriously no alcohol burn at all. This is incredibly drinkable, dangerously drinkable even. This was a very hyped up beer in my head, so it certainly did not exceed expectations, but I'd say it met them, or at least came close to doing so."
"d - relatively drinkable but I certainly couldn't pound these. I think you can taste all of the 8% abv."
"A very enjoyable, and to me, different beer. I can't really see drinking these as a session beer, it's more of a sipper and two bottles would be plenty. If you're looking for something different, give this a try. Just make sure to give it a chance to warm a bit as you go."
"What a treat! Pours a dark amber/orange/red...dark. It started off with a decent finger and a half head that slowly dissipated yet maintained a small head throughout. The smell to me was immediately of cloves and banana. I really nursed this and agree with one of the previous reviewers that the banana taste intensified as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth especially considering the high abv. For the 8.00% it was highly drinkable and would of loved to have a couple more. Definitely one of my ""new"" favorites."
"(rated Jul 28, 2008)"
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a big tan head. Smells of ripe cherries and malted barley. Taste is sweet, wheaty, with a slightly tangy aftertaste. Very little hop flavor or bitterness, likely due to the sweetness from the malt and wheat. Mouthfeel is smooth, nice carbonation. Quite drinkable, especially for 8% abv. I would buy again."
"overall a great example of what a wiezenbock should be , a great stepping stone beer"
"Phenomenal beer. Pours clear mahogany with a small head. Aroma of spices and cloves with some banana. Taste of malts with spice and some darker fruits a little of the hefe banana. Smooth mouthfeel with a sweet finish. The alcohol is totally masked. Will definitely get this one again."
"This beer is very drinkable, there is a nice balance between the hint of dark malts and the products of the yeast."
"Aroma: Caramel, banana, cherry. Some brown sugar, clove. Appearance: Beautiful large creamy head. Off-white. Head lasts forever. Murky purplish beer. Superb wheat taste, moderately sweet, some plum, cherry. Super thick body, soft carbonation. Superb example of a weizen bock."
"Overall: Easy to go down, but a little bit yeasty for my taste."
"Finish: Subtle bitterness that is well rounded, which helps blends the alcohol to a seamless beer."
"D - A bit rich to have more than one but very good."
"it appears a very deep and appealing hazy mahogany brown with a fizzy soda-like head. smells very malty with a little citrus and yeast. taste is a huge surprise, a clove and chocolate concoction with hints of the gum from your Topp's baseball card packs as a kid. its hard to believe that this is 8% abv, it has almost no alcohol presence, even as it warms. top notch."
"Appereance is murky brown almost like sewer water. I know that sounds bad but its the best describer for what this beer looks like. Aroma is caramel, wheat and yeast overall it has a sweet aroma. Flavor is wheaty up front with a complex tart to sweetness in the finish. Carbonation is great, noticible in the finish. Smooth beer that finished slightly sweet and clean. Outstanding."
"Lovely brew, that really hits the nail on the head in many fronts. The there but not overwhelming characteristics are really a pleasure to drink. My one critique would be that they put maybe a little more emphasis on the flavor - whelm me just a bit more - and it's be hands down one of my favorites."
"The mother of all Weizenbocks -- or Doppelweizenbocks, that is."
"The drinkability is out of sight for a beer of this strength. If only we could get sixers of this stuff."
"Very drinkable beer. Refreshing and complex."
"I've been hovering around this beer for a while now, everyone I talk to raves about it. I'm new to the weizenbock style of dopples and curiosity got the better of me. I'm a big fan of Bavarian Hefes, so I suspected I'd like this one okay. Well, dang. This is an outstanding brew. The clove flavors of a typical Bavarian hefe with the roasty chocolaty coffee flavors of dark malts. Wonderful beer and my new favorite winter warmer."
"In short this is a fantastic beer - fruity and spicey wheat ale."
"Reviewed on 4/6/08. Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a medium-sized white head. Aroma of light fruits and some BBQ sauce, if you search for it. Taste of bubblegum, spices (clove), and some vegetable. A very good weizenbock, although I'm not sure I'm a fan of the style as a whole. 7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"this beer pours a hazy light brown color with a tall off white head that recedes very slowly. the aroma makes me want to grow their yeast, it's got all of the nice banana and clove in there that you could want, balanced nicely by the wheat malt. the taste is very nice, if a little sweet, with a lot of the roasted malt flavors coming through. the medium body doesn't hold up to the high level of carbonation, but still a pretty drinkable beer."
"Pours a very dark brown. Aroma of banana and dark chocolate. One of the best dopplebocks I have ever tasted. There is a rich chocolate maltiness that is balanced out with a hints of banana and citurs fruits. Yummy!"
"The aroma was wheaty with some fruit esters. The taste had a bite up front that left a tingling at the back of the throat. It was wheat filled all the way through. It had a sweetness that turned to a slightly bitter taste. I got some bananas on the back end of the drink. It was well carbonated and was an enjoyable and tasty beverage."
"Prune colour, almost opaque in the glass with inspired carbonation, a two finger off white / tan head reduced but stuck around with decent lacing. Smell was banana, spice, cloves, chocolate cake. Big alcohol matched by big taste and mouthfeel, substantial body, a bit of citrus wanting to come through, overall refreshing impression. The alcohol was quite well integrated to begin with but; with warming, it took on a sherry-like warmth and texture. Nice malty impressions, some bitter chocolate, all in all well balanced for a big beer. This beer is probably not for novices, I recall having it for the first time a bit over a year ago and I was a little swept away by it. This time, I appreciated the unravelling of different layers of spice, chocolate, malt and wheat that made it well worth drinking slowly, which I suppose is warranted with the large alcohol presence. I could do with another of these, highly recommended provided you don't rush it along too much."
"This is the best weizenbock I've ever had and one of the best German beers I've tasted. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: a very well-crafted beer, more enjoyable than the Original Weisse. This weizenbock is a good hybrid for those who enjoy wheat beers but aren't over the moon about bocks. A highly drinkable treat."
"This beer was tasted on 11/24/08, a 500ml. bottle out of a Duvel tulip glass. The beer was bottled on the 109th day of 2008. Initial appearance was a beauiful reddish-brown amber colour with a mouth watering 2 finger cream head. Unfortunately the smell and taste did not compare to the look. All I could smell was active yeast which overwhelmed any other flavours the beer might have had. The taste was the same yeast, yeast, and more yeast. I would say at least for me the beer is not very drinkable considering it was the first beer that I have poured in a long time. Not a big fan of German beer styles though, more of a Belgian guy, so I hope this brew will improve with more age. Overall, at this point of bottle ageing was very disappointed by this brew which is listed on BA's top 100 list."
"Aventinus pours with a big bubbly head, justifying the champagne glass-shape of the prescribed glassware. The settled beer is a rich amber-brown with excellent lacing. The smell is just superb. It's a spiced fruit cocktail, cinnamon sticks and nutmeg stewed with pears, apples and ripe bananas. It's close to a spiced mead without the syrupy sweetness. I appreciate the taste more than the related eisbock. The eisbock is great, but the taste of wheat wine tends to drown things out. This beer showcases a range of flavors and is, in my opinion, an extremely easy beer to like. It is a great beer to spring on the wine crowd because there is a lot of fruitiness with a superb wheat backdrop and a touch of the wine-ish qualities of the eisbock. It packs complexity and steadiness into an incredible wheat ale. Schneider must have sold his soul for the recipe to this bit of alchemy. It is a unique flavor of beer, at least to my palate, and a marvelous bit of respite from the unrelenting onslaught of pale ales and stouts. This is one of those few beers that I could drink for the rest of my life and be happy. I love Belgians and gigantic American styles, but the Germans really know how to make a beer that you could drink at any reasonable time, and, even at 8.2%, I wish I had an entire three liter stein of it. You give me three liters of Aventinus and I'm willing to be fairly lax on the issue of the propriety of the glassware. Great, great beer. Thank heaven, it's widely available these days."
"I love this beer. It is one of the world's greats."
"Overall, this is a very deceiving doppelbock; has the high alcohol content, but covers it up with lots of great flavors. Definitely worth trying."
"Note: The banana flavours fade into the background as it warms, and are replaced with a bold malty taste, with some alcohol."
"Two fingers of head when poured but this quickly drops with some retention. Murky brown in colour. Aromas of dark fruit and overwhelming alcohol which persisted on the palate. The alcohol just wiped out everything else for me. Totally dominant. Perhaps better with food?"
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with white head. It smelled like lemon and wild yeast, salt and vinegar, and no malt. It tasted like prune malt and sour wild yeast with lemon and salty hops. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was much more Belgian and less dark (lacking malt) than I expected. It was clean and drinkable, but didn't have a flavor that I particularly enjoy. It had decent body and hid the alcohol fairly well, and will hopefully become much more balanced with tasty malt character as it ages."
"Mouthfeel was zippy at first but smoothed out as it warmed a little. A classic,although it is far from my favorite style."
"Drinkability: Better out of the bottle, I think. The flavors just seemed a little less vibrant here. Nonetheless, it's still a fantastic beer, flavorful, aromatic, attractive, creamy, and a definite winner."
"I can't recommend this enough."
"The carbonation when first poured was a bit much but after it settled I was a happy man. This is one of the great Weizenbocks. I have an aged one that I am eager to try and will look for it on tap which should be interesting."
"D - For the style, very."
"In sum this is a must try..."
"The BEST of the style, a classic, and one of my favorite brews."
"Pours a cloudy opaque dark brown with huge billowy, but fast fading, tan head. Smell: banana, clove, pear, vanilla, bubblegum, candied fruit, yeast, wheat, a whiff of alcohol. Taste: caramel, hint of chocolate, ripe banana, clove, dates, yeasty, subdued wheat, warming alcohol. Medium to full body, almost chewy, bready. Ever had chocolate banana bread? Wow, there is a lot going on here, all of it excellent. As a dunkelweizen fan this is a fantastic beer and a great option as the temperature randomly jumps from the 80s down to the 40s in north FL."
"Drinkability- Very good. Probably could not have more then 2."
"I've never been a huge fan of wheat beers until I Tried this one. The Aventinus pours a rich, syrupy brown with an aggresive head that rapidly dissapates. The aroma is all malt. Sweet with hints of toffee and carmel. This beer coats the palate upon the first sip. Flavors of carmel, dates, and malt are first noticed, followed by a slight dry finish. I found it to be quite easy to drink, despite it's ABV and viscosity. Aventinus is the best wheat beer I have ever had, and one of the best German brews I have tasted in my life."
"This is one of the best bock style beers out there, without a doubt."
"The taste is highly interesting, lively and complex, which was what hit me before any specific flavours did. It is light, yet strongly flavoured, zesty, lively. It has a lto of fruit, spice, apple, 7-up, whole wheat bread, a hint root beer and a hint of rum - with alcohol evident but restrained and smooth. SUpposedly it's has some choclate, but I did not really get that. It does not taste its strength. it is highly drinkable and engaging."
"The draught board at BT listed this as a doppelbock, so being that I was unfamiliar with the drink (and that I am particularly keen on doppelbocks) I was fairly surprised when I recieved it at the lightness in color as well as the somewhat-subdued flavor. I knew then that this was probably not a doppelbock and I checked BA to confirm it was a weizen... ANYWAY, once I'd adjusted to the beer's true identity I was ready for it and enjoyed it quite a lot. It smells like rootbeer and looks like it too.. Tastes sweet and a bit like caramel but very smooth, the sweetness is subdues and not so upfront. Mouth is on the lighter side of moderate. Highly carbonated. Very easy to drink and delicious as well."
"One of my favorite beers, hands down. I like this beer the first time I tasted it so damn much I immediately went out and bought the attendant glass to it. Superior product--masterful!"
"As I sip further I am starting to feel the warming effects of the relatively high, 8.2%, alcohol. This will be a nice beer to bring to my family's Xmas gathering to keep warm and to endure their idiotic banter."
"as this baby. Best German I can think of... maybe Weihenstephaner can come along on the German train as well."
"D: Impressive, dry enough to keep me going back, & my palate loves the complexity. One of the smoothest mousseist beers I have tasted."
"Pours cola, syrup brown with a a dainty little head. Smell is sweet malt, pancakes and syrup actually. Strange but awesome. Also hints of apricot, crisp red apples, clove. A very strong sweet cake and maple. Taste begins with a nice dark wheat bread and is followed by spicy clove, notes of apple and a bit of maple moves through. A bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is coating but dry on the swallow. Very good Weizenbock!"
"D - This one is as drinkable as any good dunkelweizen, despite the higher alcohol content. A finer wheat beer could not be asked for."
"Overall, this beer was really good. The taste is extremely unwavering, which makes this a very approachable drink for almost anyone. Most importantly, it's not extreme in any sense of the word."
"Overall, a very nice beer that I wish had a little less carbonation. As I said before, the more you let the carbonation settle, the more the fruit and flavor are prolonged when consumed. I may store my other bottle for a while to see how it affects the beer."
"Pours dark brown colour with thin white-ish head. Smell - wheat, malts with hint of frutiness. Taste - it's great! Wheat, plums and raisins with hint of chocolate. It's really complex and alcohol is very well hidden there. Beer is very balanced and very drincable for the ABV. Fantastic brew I will definately go back to it!"
"The beer is somewhat thick but very wet, and carbonated almost like a soda. Very refreshing and highly drinkable."
"I'm thinking that 5 years of aging this brew is ideal for my tastes. I still have a line on getting more of these 2003 limited editions and I think I will."
"Also, this beer greatly benefits from its official glassware (pilsner with a rounded top). As you bring it to your lips, the bubble near the top of the glass nicely captures all of this brews aromas. Just bought the glass today and I notice the difference."
"D - this drinks very well, especially on a fall night. It has been a while since I have had this and it is even better than I remember."
"2.29ea?"
"The nicely carbonated and full-bodied, silky character makes this one very drinkable and refreshing."
"Had a bottle of it at Moan and Dove. A great appearance; generally dark with a murky brown tone in the light and a wonderfully thick head. Fantastic aromas of dark fruits wrapped in a roasty and yeasty flavor. The taste was really sweet with the bready and fruit aspects really coming through. Slightly silky in texture but generally light. Overall, this was really great."
"Great beer for the style--not usually a huge fan of the fruitiness of wheat beers, but I like this one."
"D - Ridiculously good beer. One of the best for a high ABV and high malt content lover like me (I think my love of scotch has influenced my taste in beer...I like to feel a little heat after the swallow. I make fun of people who drink light, or (even worse) ultralight beer...I often share with them the estimated calorie content of a boozy malt bomb like this one....roughly 300-400 I guessing? No wonder German monks invented doppelbocks to get them through the Lenten fasting periods! It's liquid food!"
"The best I've had of this style."
"MF&D - A great beer experience. If you have not tried this beer, you should. A classic, just be aware of the 8% ABV."
"A very, very good wheat beer. The only limiting factor is the 8% ABV."
"A little aggressive carbonation on the tongue at first but it smoothes out later on."
"2004 vintage bottle aged at Schneider. Pours clearish mahogany with a surprisingly small off-white head. Recedes quickly without much lacing. Strong, almost overpowering dark-fruity smell. Prunes and molasses. Strong fruit in the taste as well, with some tangy wheat. Very sweet, with a fair amount of banana. Slight alcohol flavor and warmth. Highly carbonated with a medium body. A bit too much."
"Edit: I love this more and more every time I have it. This is the only perfect beer I've ever had."
"D- very easy to finish the bottle. a great summer beer. something ill be sure to have again. my first wizenbock, i think i need to further explore this style."
"The best beer I probably drank out of the 5 I had at the fest, so I could drank it for a minute or two."
"Overall, a very nice and complex beer. I was surprised at how yeasty this was, but nonetheless it is a great beer for sure."
"good beer, high alcohol content sneaks up on you."
"A winner here. Evokes both hefeweizen and dark belgian ales. A well-balanced beer with flavor and drinkability. I'll pick this up again if I see it."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this is the only weizenbock I've ever enjoyed."
"D= This is a great beer, but not my favorite Weizenbock. I appreciated the deep color and complexity but thought it was a bit too heavy to be a refreshing beer."
"Overall - I like it. I have enjoyed a lot of Schneider beers before. Would drink again. I would really consider aging this a bit to see if that would take the edge off the alcohol."
"D: Not an everyday beer."
"D- A most enjoyable here too. I can taste the history as I drink it. Nothing sessionable at all about this beer but man it is tasty. A real gem."
"Quite surprised I have never tried this one, have to say its delicious. Definitely deserving of all the praise. Will be looking forward to the next offering."
"D- Easy to drink, but is on the sweeter side of things."
"Overall: all around good stuff, worth a try"
"Fantastic drinkability, just a bit heavy on the warmth. I love the ABV I just don't like the raw taste of alcohol. This isn't bad at all, but there is enough there that it wasn't perfect for my taste. However, it was still very good and I highly recommend it for the style."
"This one is a must try for a weizenbock fan. Well made. Those freaking Germans. Danke."
"D.Good drinkability for style."
"I had about 15 to taste this night and this by far was my favorite."
"Drinkability: Complexity and ease give this one a high drinkability. Watch out for the ABV, but other than that, drink up!"
"Pour into a glass. Really interesting dark colour, found that it had a thicker feeling in the mouth but not creamy. I wouldn't buy again for a few years until I can train my self on Dopplebock."
"This beer has a lot going on. It's like nothing else I've ever tasted."
"Notes: For the price, and the flavor, this is a homerun. A good beer all around, and no fridge is complete without one. More than worth a taste... worth two tastes :)"
"If you like the Hefeweisse by Schneider and can appreciate a sipping beer, you will like Aventinus for sure."
"Definitely the most substantive of weizen-bocks I have had, including the Clipper City Hang Ten (a personal favorite). I don't think I like it as much as its BeerAdvocate rating might say I ""should," but it is very good."
"D: Pretty high. I could drink at least 3 of these on a sitting."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. The amber brown liquid produced a nice tight head. The smell of malt and mature fruit is the first introduction to this brew. Smells sweeter than the taste which has some spice and yeast/malt bread like quality. Now the strange part, I detect a char grill on the finish. I'm not so sure I'm crazy about this one. The general consciences would have me believe I may have gotten an ""off-bottle"". I'll have to try this beer again in the future."
"Bought a bottle of this at Kurtz/Vreny's in Duluth, GA. Pours a deep brown with a very strong head. Smells is slightly spicy with a hint of dried fruit. Taste is very malty, with the malts and the dried fruity taste being the primary taste. Pretty tasty. Decent amount of carbonation in the mouthfeel. A very drinkable weizenbock."
"HV"
"Great beer, I will surely have a few of these this autumn/winter!"
"D - Definitely a sipper. One to be enjoyed."
"Drinkability - It's been a while since i've had one of these, and it's just as good as I remember. As said before, the alcohol is invisible for an 8%."
"Drink - This could be dangerous, given the ABV. The alcohol is superbly masked. The richness of this beer is second-to-none, but it's magically extremely drinkable. Be careful!"
"Pours dark brown with cherry hues. Head is off-white and prolific, taking it's sweet time to dissipate. Smells of chocolate, caramel, dark fruits, sweet bread, and some hops in the background. Tastes sweet up front with a little alcohol peeking through and a slight acidity. There's also some raisins, caramel and malts in there. It's big, bold and beautiful. It's medium bodied and fairly well carbonated which leads to a certain crispness, although it's still smooth and drinkable."
"Aventinus is a truly unique beer, and required drinking for any fan of wheat beers. In fact, it's strongly recommended for ANY beer drinker."
"Drinkability - Goes down easy, but doesn't hide the 8% as well as I might have hoped. Still a delicious brew."
"Sturdy wheat with a nice aroma and awesome flavor. Refreshing wheaty scent, very crisp. Pour is a light amber/dark copper huge head and moderate lacing. Satisfying to the palate, with a strong alcohol finish that is exceptionally smooth. Flavor is truly remarkable. Underlying wheat presence with a nice malty sweetness. Well balanced and very drinkable. Great brew here."
"Bock my brew."
"I love the angle here, but there is something going on with the aftertaste. It leaves a minute sourness which does not detract from the overall impact of the beer, just my desire to have another."
"Overall Impression - This is a good beer, and a wonderful example of the Weizenbock style. This is a very drinkable beer, but is complex enough that you can drink it slowly, and enjoy its aromas and flavor. This makes it a good choice for many different situations. I highly recommend this in your regular rotation. If this isn't enough for you there is an Eisbock version that is outstanding!"
"Very enjoyable beer! very complex. I haven't decided yet if the crispy acidic end is something I'm a fan of: but it does buzzz...."
"M/D- Really smooth due to the enhanced malts but still spritzy enough to be similar to a hefe. Just good all around here. One of those beers that after you take a few sips you just want to keep on sipping it. Becomes addictive I guess you can say."
"D: Highly drinkable, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will definitely be having again."
"I would highly recommend this beer."
"An appearance of a bubbling, shadowy sea of dark amber topped by marshmallow head. An aroma of caramelized plums, spice, and strangely...ketchup. A delicacy indeed! Initial grape tag team with dark malt (but no roast) slight booze, banana, vanilla extract, and mild spice. And this is a handicapped match; they are kicking my ass. Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This brew has character and flavor worthy of defining a genre. Another beer of the gods with flavor that hits every area of the tongue making it hard to place which taste you like most. I'll take em all with a big grin that I can't wipe off my face."
"Good drinkability, but the ABV limits it just a bit, especially on a hot day. Otherwise, very enjoyable! A great beer!"
"I am not really familiar with Wiezenbock but I may have just had one of the best of the style I am likely to have. Try it if you get the chance."
"One of my favorite German beers hands down, bottle says 8.2% ABV, this bottle is about a year old and it tastes great both aged and fresh, so simple yet so good, one of a kind beer, have never had anything else like it and it is always a cheaper alternative when I am in the mood for a great brew, there is a reason why this in the top one hundred, will certainly drink again soon, recommended"
"D- Other than the warming, the alcohol is hidden well. I wouldn't call it sessionable but I could see this linking up very well with some German food. I will revisit this is the future as I don't think it really lived up to what it can be."
"Very nice. I was not blown away by it, but it is complex and a well crafted beer."
"Drinkability: This is one to savor even thought is goes down so smooth. A real beauty."
"D: A true delight after some disappointing tasting prior. The ABV comes in during the second and third tastes, which I fould very impessive and enjoyable."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and somewhat chewy. Very drinkable but a little heavy on the carbonation."
"Poured into a big glass from an 18 oz bottle. Poured a thick, nutty brown with a foamy off-white head. The smell was all banana and cloves, which seemed to mask the wheat but it was quite a pleasant aroma. The flavor was much like the smell, but without any one flavor being too overwhelming. It's medium-heavy body was smooth and delicious all the way down. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a cloudy tan-brown color with a light brown/cream colored tall head in a hefe glass. Smells strongly of banana, yeast, and clove... malt is just lightly detected in the smell as the head lowers. Tingly hop and carbonation, nice moderate smooth mouthfeel, bready malt and yeast, creamy, fairly spicy, pepper/clove... slightly medicinal/phenolic, fruit sweetness and banana... this is definitely more reminiscent of a hefeweizen than a doppelbock. Not in-your-face heavy malts, but it does have the ""restorative"" effect of a doppelbock. Suggested. Would have rated the taste a bit higher, but the spice was a little too predominant"
"D: Absolutely drinkable. My revisiting of my German brews is making me need to go back to Germany soon. These beers are amazing."
"D - This beer is definitely has a high degree of drinkability. I could definitely enjoy a couple of these from time to time."
"I have to say that I was completely blown away by this brew. I mean to be cellared and cared for a full year to be enjoyed by two fellows in armchairs watching the Nationals being swept by the Reds it was a pleasant experience but I just don't know if it would be good one after another. As we didn't have anymore because we only had the two bottles I couldn't tell you. But for drinkablity I had to give it off for a few points because I think this would make a horrible session beer. For something you want to enjoy while watching the worst team in baseball get pummeled it really takes the edge off. Fantastic to drink but every once in a while."
"D - This beer was a treat. I found myself enjoying it more and more with each sip."
"I like it. Nice, not overly complex and quite flavorful."
"Appearance is dark, cloudy brown with a thick off-white head. It smells strong of cloves, wheat, and malts. The taste is complex--cloves, cinnamon, chocolate, spices, and malts. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, rich and smooth. This is an extremely drinkable beer that hides the higher alcohol level well. It is quite a treat; almost too good. I recommend it for special occasions."
"Man,this was an outstanding find...I picked it up not expecting much,mainly because I prefer Stouts,and to my surprise I was astounded.This is exceptional in everyway,even the price was decent.I tastes,looks,and smells great.The alcohol content was enough to make both easy to drink and easy to get a buzz on,with just two or three.I will most certainly be buying this one again...soon."
"I've been looking to try this one again, and was really excited to see it on tap at the Big Hunt. Poured a delicious deep brown color with a big tan head. Nose is all over the place, hugely wheaty, with dried fruit, yeast, a ton of spices, roasted malt, raisins. Flavor is totally similar, and amazing. A ton of mixing flavors and fruit, citrus, prunes, raisins, yeast, wheat, caramel and roasted malt. Man is this a delicious brew. Feel is fairly full bodied and perfect for the style. Overall, I'm yet again blown away. This one is outstanding."
"Drinkability - Totally drinkable for the gravity and alchohol content. Very sneaky beer."
"This packs a wallop with such bountiful taste but still is quite drinkable. Awesome, maybe quintessential style example - very clean."
"Overall a stunning brew worthy of your attention. My only disappointment is the lack of a bottling or expiration date. Since its bottle conditioned I really want to know how old it is so I can make this tasting the bar to compare future tastings with. Oh well."
"Poured 500ml bottle into my Duvel glass. Beautiful cloudy brown beer with significant head that left a wonder silk lace. Definately smelled of bananas,clove, vanilla, and ""beer goodness"". Taste - Wow! I really love, not like, this beer. It was a dessert for me. I really kept turning the bottle hoping more would fall into me glass. Mouth feel - Big foamy head is reminiscent of sweet frothy milk. I could definately drink 2 - 3 500 ml of these, and I don't think I would want another beer after Aventinus in the same night. This beer was a huge bargain at $2.99 for a 500 ml."
"This is an outstanding beer. The wheat and malty bock characteristics are melded beautifully. Definitely one of my favorites."
"It is extremely creamy and delicious. A nice fruitiness full of plum and banana open it up, followed by some nice phenols and cloves backed with some nice alcohol, which really works to enhance everything. As it warms the wheat begins to become noticable, as well as what tastes like some very light roast. Throughout the drinking experience the carbonation is lively and wonderful. Definitely an excellent beer."
"D: 8.2 ABV limits this a bit, but it's still robust, flavorful, and excellent."
"D - High abv and a full body don't make it the most easy to drink beer, but it tastes really damn good. Definitely a brew I'll buy in the future to lean back and relax with. Need to make another note of the pronounced fruity esters of this beer."
"D - Given the ABV, it's probably unwise to drink too much of this. Otherwise I'd like to be buried with some."
"Overall, it's pretty good in the mouth. A little overcarbonated, but that was remedied by a vigorous second pour. Still, creamy isn't an adjective that comes to mind here. The complete lack of noticeable alcohol, combined with that indefinable drinkability that comes only with wheatbeers, makes this a real guzzler. I could have a few of these without problem, until I went to stand up."
"Intensity was very forgiving given the potency. A very smooth tasting weizenbock with rich, lively feel."
"D - Good stuff, but overall it's too dry, too thin, and too high in alcohol for me to completely enjoy. The alcohol is pretty in-your-face, something that the relative dryness highlights."
"The flavor opens with sweet, honey glazed wheat malt, nice and chocolatey up front. With some years on it, this has become very much like a strong belgian dark. Full bodied, with a dry, powdery feel. All the carbonation is still there. Sherry-like, and very vintage. Lots of dark fruit, though black cherry comes forward most. Aged, dry wheaty sourness in the finish, balancing and wrapping things up neatly. Some of the complexity seems to have dropped out in favor of the typical aged beer flavors. Maybe a little past it's perfect time, but still quite good."
"Mouthfeel is very nice. I could drink this again with no problem. I'll but these again."
"Poured a hazy dark amber-brown. The frothy off white head was a few fingers deep for a few minutes before settling down to nothing. The smell is of ripe banana, dark fruit, cider and clove. Barely any alcohol was detected. More of the same in the flavor but the alcohol is definitely more noticeable. The strong dark fruit and banana flavors mix wonderfully with the wheat flavor. Medium body and slick feel. Exquisite."
"The complexity (and tastiness) of this aged bottle is outstanding. Another reason why I love beer."
"D - Rich and malty with a nice dark malt character. Quite drinkable despite the heavy flavors and alcoholic strength. A classic example of the style."
"This is one of the first Weizenbocks I ever tried, and so it has always held a special place for me. Pours a somewhat murky light amber color, darker towards the top, and gets lighter as you go down. A big cloud like poof of head shows itself early, fades a bit, but holds up very well mostly. Smell has some spicy clove, strawberry, prune, wheat, cinnamon and much more I am sure. Taste is extremely juicy, and busting at the seams with fruit flavors, spice and wheat that mirrors some of the smells mentioned above. Body of the beer is medium, and has a certain degree of heat, but not to the point of being offensive. The tastes do a good job of masking the higher ABV. Although many have called this one a sipper, I could gulp this stuff down easily. I will agree that this is one of the best for the style. Cheers"
"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured a cloudy plum color with a rocky off-white head that took up half the glass. Excellent retention and a fair amount of lacing that adhered to the sidewalls of the glass during the tasting. Scent of dark fruit and bubblegum. A slight medicinal quality, not at all unpleasant, and clove present upfront in the flavor profile. Dark fruit is again revealed somewhere in the middle (seems to be raisins and prunes) followed by a tart and spicy finish. Lots of effervescence with quite a bit of burn throughout the mouth. Alcohol is well hidden, but complexity of flavor limits drinkability to one bottle tops, but quite enjoyable nonetheless."
"A very drinkable, rich, flavorful beer."
"The balance of sweet flavor character, gentle spice and balanced mouthfeel make this easy to enjoy. Excellent beer!"
"pint bottle into an imperial pint glass. Pours a very cloudy brown with a nice head. Sweet malty smell with some bread smell. Bananas and malt in the taste. Nice carbonation, crisp mouthfeel. Strong alcohol is very well masked. As good in the style as I have had."
"What a magical beer style. Complex but humble and, knowing the Germans, probably a realatively simple grain bill. This is maybe the most drinkable beer upward of 7% ABV I've ever had. Could get into some real trouble with this one flowing on tap."
"Appearance once poured was a deep see-thru reddish brown very nice with a good head that dissapated quickly. Smell was of fruit and spice with the hint of malt. Taste was very good with spices prominent and fruit like banana coming to the fore front. Mouthfeel was carbonated slightly with the malt in their as well a very smooth finish. Drinkability is excellent I was sad that I had only bought one!"
"D: This is definitely a drinkable beer. It's smooth, it goes down and it has a good complexity to the taste."
"Just saying. :D"
"D-this packs a punch from the lips,to the tongue,to the belly,and straight to the hat rack...an enjoyable treat but not something I would drink more than one of at a time"
"poured into a pilsner glass as recommended. from the second i opened the bottle the aroma was apparent. very pleasant. tiny bubbles continue to rise up. has a nice orangey brown color that you cannot really see through. overall taste is seriously exceptional. I don't really know if I have ever had this beer before today, but I do know I will have it again."
"D- For the ABV, this is damn drinkable and tasty. I am really impressed."
"hazy, brown in the middle and lighter on the outside. nice little head that goes away quickly and leaves little lace. smells of clove, banana, a little malt and a little dried fruit. not overpowering and nicely blended. tastes the same. not overboard. luxurious. great mouthfeel. easy drink. best i've had in this style."
"If you're reading this, I assume you know what a doppelbock should taste like. With that said, this is a great example of a ""drinkable"" doppelbock. It's sweet with a malty aroma that has all the character of a big doppel. The flavor lacks the burn of an 11% example of the style and the wheate gives it a very ""drinkable"" profile. This is a great beer and I highly recommend giving it a try."
"Pours a muddy brown with big tan head, long lasting retention, good lacing. Smells of caramel, bread, nuts, citrus, banana, and spices. Tastes of honey, vanilla, bread, caramel, banana, clove, chocolate, and walnuts with a lemon and orange zest finish. Medium to medium full in body with good carbonation. A nice balance of sweetness, bread, and citrus, very easy to drink, yet hearty."
"D: Highly drinkable, still. Maybe I expect something big here due to the gravity, but this beer somehow ends up light and drinkable."
"This is absolutely one of my favorite beverages at the moment."
"Notes: When I can not find any Sam Adams Double bock I find this is not a replacement,but an upgrade. Obviously they are different styles yet it seems they are cut from the same cloth. The Aventinus is lighter and slightly less in ABV,but when you have an Aventinus one can not tell it is so high in ABV. A pleasure to sip,drink and simply keep in stock for a rainy day."
"D - Overall, a delicious beer. Not too heavy, but speaking from experience, it can sneak up on you."
"D: A nice finish to a dinner of 8 day old, homemade sauerbraten! A little on the bigger side... A sipper, but an easy sipper."
"Mmm... this is really quite good. There's just enough alcohol to taste a hint of (and feel just more than a hint of) and plenty of rich, complex malt to play with - a balance of intense flavors rare to find and easy to overlook. Kudos."
"To be honest, I've had limited experiences with this style. To date, they've been good. But, this has truly been a great experience. I'm very pleased Aventinus and have no reservations recommending it. It's worthy of all the accolades it's received. Pick up a bottle next time you see it."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer although on the sweet side. I'm not used to this style but this was a very good introduction to it for me."
"All in all, an excellent brew that I'm glad to have sampled. Alas, it's not sold in my region. I'll have to be patient to have another."
"D - Excellent beer. I could drink several."
"d - nicely rounded flavor."
"I all for the dunkel weiss! What a great brew. Pours a cloudy hazelnut brown. Aroma of fresh wheat, banana, slight hint of chocolate. Taste of bitterweet chocolate, banana, dark cherries, wheat, a menagerie of flavor delight! Smooth as butter on the tongue."
"2005 Vintage (special edition)"
"D - a nice beer to enjoy a bottle at a time."
"Wow, this is a big, tasty beer! The only thing doppelbock here is the alcohol and sweetness, otherwise it is hefe weizen (dunkel) and weizenbock all the way. I'll be drinking this again for sure, it's good enough that the high price is not a deterrent."
"T/M/D - delicious! Again, lemony like a wheat beer but with some darker malty flavors (like brown sugar and raisins). I really enjoyed this beer, but maybe a bit too heavy to have more than 1 at a sitting."
"D - Drinkability is good. I would easily drink more of this beer. The alcohol is strong in the flavor but that is just a reminder to take it easy with this one."
"This beer has definitley sparked my interest in trying other wheat-doppelbocks."
"drinkability is good. this is a nicely crafted wheizenbock, with good proportioning, it just lacks the malty character that comes with the bock tag. overall a solid brew. prost!"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Rich and sweet; flavors of chocolate and banana, caramel, toasted nuts and spice. Smooth on the tongue, soft but ample carbonation from bottle conditioning. Delicious but quite rich and decadent; I don't think I could have more than one of these in a sitting."
"D - Not really my style as I'm not a big clove fan. The cloves really took something away for me. A little too spicy for my taste."
"Would try again, though not my style, smell hinted to memories of Germany...ahhh....Germany"
"Drinkability - This beer is awesome. It tastes great, smells great, and is really easy drinkin'."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty chewy. It has a smooth finish. Very good beer"
"I love this beer. Extremely well balanced. Pours dark brown, almost purple, with a thick, frothy head. What a beautiful combination of sweet malts, earthy fruits, and spices. This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had, with each sip bringing a different combination of flavors. Finishes extremely smooth, gently rolling into a light bitterness. My favorite German beer, maybe my favorite beer."
"d- i love wheat beer. ide be a happy man with this available"
"This was a unique beer. I enjoyed it, but I'd like to see what some age would do to it."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Definitely smooth and easy to drink due to good flavors, but at 8.2% it's a decent sized beer calling for slower consumption."
"World class."
"Treat this bier with respect and admiration."
"This is an excellent example of this beer style. I normally dont write this long a review but this beer blew me away. I actually am upset because I am down to my last few sips and I only have this one bottle in the house. I would go out of my way to find this beer again and highly recommend to anyone interested in this beer style or any beer style for that matter. I actually just swirled the last bit left in the bottle to pick up the remaining yeast and poured it into the glass which created a cascade similar to a fresh poured guinness with tiny clumps of yeast that settled in the bottom of the glass. The 8.2% ABV prevents this from being considered a session beer but I would drink these till last call and then sleep on the curb outside the bar. Its that good."
"Definitely something I would get again."
"An excellent beer. A must try."
"D: Smooth, goes down well and finishes clean. I could have one right after the other."
"EDIT: I find this beer fucking solid in all regards. After having this beer for a while, I find the dark fruits ( plums, raisins, etc) come out and really accentuate this beer. I fucking love it, and definitely one of my favourites."
"In every category I find small faults - weak head retention, some medicinal aromas, etc. Hence the 4.5s and 4s. This is fantastic beer, one of the best I've had, and definitely a classic."
"I bought this beer at a time when I was strictly drinking IPA's and assorted Pale's, and I could argue that this beer helped change my taste. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes a variety of beers."
"M: Smooth, nice. Small bubbles. Full bodied, excellent, well worth the purchase price."
"Pours an orange tinged ruby color with huge amounts of head. Becomes cloudier with each pour, obviously unfiltered; with great tracing as well. Aromas are huge with lots of clove, caramel, banana, and wheat, and a slight bit of cocoa. On the palate, the chocolate becomes more evident along with dark fruits, raisins, a little vanilla, some cinnamon in the finish, ginger, along with an astringency. Carbonation was medium high producing quite a sting with a medium light, creamy body. Drinkability was extremely good, the alcohol was nowhere to be seen. One of the best German beers I've had."
"GET THE VINTAGED VERSION - OR DO IT YOURSELF"
"Poured into an Aventinus glass...thank god. Aventinus pours a rich, hazey mahogany, with a slightly off-white head that leads to really nice lacing. Strong aromas of banana and clove, followed with a tailend of vanilla and confectioners sugar. The taste of Aventinus is uncanny. Bananas, vanilla and clove are on the front end of this beer. Sweet, malty, and almost tastes like a bananas foster. Mild to high carbonation, with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, that finishes so nicely. I could drink this beer all day...literally. It is almost that perfect, great aroma, great flavor, and outstanding feeling while drinking."
"Pours a nice dark hazy brown with some hints of red. Beautiful head but fades kinda quickly. Smell is of spices and wheat beer. Taste is lovely wheat and great bananaish, wheat flavors. finish is nice and bubbly and goes down very very smooth. mouthfeel is a wee bit thin for my liking, but just fine and very refreshing. ABV is MIA. feels like it should be %5. Drinkability is absolutely wonderful. Ate with some aged irish cheddar and followed by some cherry pie. Sheeeess myyy..."
"I had this in the bottle later on. So much better in the bottle. I feel like the tastes are much more pronounced and I do not taste as much apple cider as I taste light, smooth alcohol and the roasted malt. The wheat and malt are in perfect balance."
"$7.00 for a half-liter glass."
"Wow, this is the real deal. A fluffy head and an opaque, greenish, *mysterious* hue hinted at what was to come. Fruity and floral on the nose and just as complex on the tongue--a typical wheaty citrus character balanced with clove. Chewy. This is a fantastic bottle-conditioned beer that has earned a place in my top 10, if not my top 5. Highly recommended."
"M/D: Smooth, slightly sticky on the tongue, carbonation is very smooth as well. Full bodied, no alcohol taste. Drinkability is only hindered by the fact that I may never find another bottle from 2002. Excellent stuff, this one has held up well."
"The pour on this beer was a dark brown with hints of amber throughout with a nice foamy white/red head if poured correctly. A little stonger that a doubble bock with a nice fruit balance. The active yeast mixed with the clove, banana, and vanilla give it a taste that is unlike most beers of its kind. There are also brown sugar notes throughout. It smells very fruity and sweet like candy. The mouthfeel was good it had a nice pop and and kick to it. Refreshing to the palate. Very easy to drink. Good dessert beer."
"D: I can drink this style throughout the day, great beer!"
"The beer is dark amber in color. It poured with a very nice head that persisted for 5 minutes after pouring. With the yeast swirled into the beer, it's impossible to see through the beer to the other side. The aroma is sweet and clove-like but with a strange ester in the background that reminds me of bacon slightly. The taste is brilliant with The mouthfeel is coating and washes away gently. As far as drinkability, this beer just keeps going on and on. This is one of the truly great beers in the world."
"Appearence dark brown a hint of amber when you hold it to the light. Smell fruit, spice, caremel sweetness. Taste fruit, yeast, prunes, spice, the taste is complex tons of different tastes here. Mouthfeel is thick high carbonation. Drinkability is good I could have another."
"My first weissenbock, and I don't think that I could have gotten a better start."
"Quite complex yet a very well balanced example of the style. Definately one of the better German brews around."
"Very differenet. Aroma is almost exclusively banana and vanilla. Appearance is a hazy monochromatic brown with a large off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Flavor is rich in clove and quite sweet. Goes down like syrup (in a nice way). A pretty sophisticated beer. Some of my less expirianced friends (not that I am too expirianced) said that it tasted a lot like bubblegum. Overall quite nice, but not something you could drink a lot of."
"Thick and filling. I'd probably never have more than one."
"Head pours about 2 fingers thick and slowly goes down. Nice dark color, not quite black. It has the similar taste of a hefeweizen with a stonger hint of alcohol."
"I suppose with the moderately high alcohol content, one would expect a warm feeling to this brew, and this is certainly the case; however, this is very drinkable. Just enjoy this beer! Put this together with a Schwatzwalderkirchtorte, and you'll be in heaven."
"Aventinus is the German version of an American Barleywine.... ""Let's see how much flavor we can get out of the grains, yeast, and water."" I need to re-review this one .. the last time I had it was a few months ago at the Front Door, and I loved it."
"A very good beer, one that stands alone and sets the marker, in other words damn good stuff."
"Poured this brew into a large weizen glass and it poured out slowly and appeared syrup-colored brown w/ very little head but a lot of carbonation. One whiff is overpowering with a malty slant but with citrus and spicey/yeasty overtones. There is a very hoppy bite when it first hits your tongue, but it is somewhat thin-bodies and balanced out w/ a touch of peppery spices, a nice part sweet/dark malts and some citrus fruit and a yeastiness to boot - overall a very smooth beer. Only the high ABV (the alcohol is hidden well) limit this from a session beer."
"D: Fantastic! This has wonderful fruit flavors in it without being too sweet. Just a real pleasure to let this stuff touch my taste buds. Definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: Awesome. This is the marked example of a doppelbock. Very well balanced blend of flavors, sugars, alcohol and palate cleansing refreshment. Highly drinkable. Paired well with a lavender/fennel chevre. Will be getting some more of this stuff."
"Copped this purple-logo bottle from a Morris County store... really liked the company's Hefe-Weizen, so figured this would be a good sample... beautiful purple, dark-brown, mahogany appearance with immense frothy, foamy head that bubbles up... smell is replete with figs and prunes... taste is all malts with a rich, thick, creamy plum, fig taste that hits home and stays on the palate... ultra-rich flavor that is very filling and intense... extra malty with an alcohol presence certainly noticeable... reminds me somewhat of a doppelbock... a strong, full-flavored, robust beer that is satisfying... good stuff... Recommended..."
"D - Pretty good, but the overall yeastiness causes a big hit here, I doubt I could do more than 2 in a night, especially in a large serving like this. Excellent brew overall, however. Recommended."
"Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the LCBO. Beautiful deep ruby pour with an extremely creamy white head. Scent is of cloves and cinamon mixed with sweet fruity malts. This is carried through in the flavour, which reminded me a bit of some of the Chimays. Good hint of chocolate present also. The alcohol is slightly apparent, but well enough integrated and provides a very pleasant warming feel. The body is full."
"D: This brew goes to show what frequent tastings and exploration will do to your palate. I'm still not a big fan of weizens but this was much better than I had anticipated."
"D:Very good and definitely intereting."
"What a nice pleasure for my 100th beer review. Well made and a definite enjoyment to drink."
"Pours a murky brown color with a smallish tan head that dissipated into a nice ring, no lacing though. The smell is wonderful; bananas, clove, medicinal phenols, and raisins. The taste is fantastic, great hefe flavors; banana, clove, medicinal, and a nice earthy yeast. A bit of alcohol and light dark fruit shows up in the end. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation. The finish is fantastic, it is sweet but not sugary or syrupy, perfect. Damn this is a mighty fine brew. All of the great hefe flavors without the hard wheat bite. Extremely smooth and extraordinarily drinkable. Definitely a must try and try and try again."
"A very pleasant beer, definitely try this one if you see it."
"D = A very good choice if you are in the mood for a weizenbock."
"Aventinus pours a lovely brown color with a white head that eventually disappears. The smell has sweetness, dark fruit, and a bit of graininess. The taste is sweet, the dark fruit is still there, joined by warming alcohol. Mouthfeel full and coating leaving a pleasant aftertaste. This beer is wickedly easy to drink. Give it a try when you find it."
"Pours a deep rich chocolate-walnut brown. Deeper than brown, almost poster color. Rests with a two-finger head, creamy foamy and thick. Aroma is big and sweet, some alcohol with barleywine-like notes. Some caramel and tart apple. Phenols and alcohol are present. Nice. Taste is fronted by fruit: raisins, tart apple, roasted fig, nuts and caramel. Middle is warmed by alcohol and finishes smooth with lingering taste of raisins and roasted malt. Very nice again. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with very clean and light bubbles and almost effervescent. Almost a saison body. I could session this beer for while."
"Scores averaged to reflect a combination of the 2002-2003 vintages."
"Pours a murky brown color with plenty of light brown head that is awfully sudsy with a great amount of tiny carbonation bubbles. Smell is fruity with apples and pears coming through. Some grapes, and a decent amount of german malt and a dash of Hallertauer hops in the background. Taste is thick and delicious. I imagine this is what monks would be drinking centuries ago (I'm reading The Pillars of the Earth now). Taste is of fruity, with a malty sweetness and plenty of a thick taste behind it. I can sense a bit of a meaty broth taste that makes me want to sip this one. Highly carbonated for having such a big alcohol presence."
"Hazy brown in color with garnet highlights and a rocky champagne-like head. Aroma of malt is well attenuated by just the right amount of hops for the style. There are earthy aromas of dark fruit and cloves. Taste is full and complex the wheat flavor comes through but is pleasantly augmented by the spiciness. Finishes crisp and clean. Very drinkable."
"Pours a clear but dark ruby/brown. Light tan head. Nose is sweet with what seems like an inky tone to it. Yeslike pen ink. I feel like I am smelling the inside of a thoroughly wet barrel. Flavor is extremely sweet with a tart kick in the back of the mouth on the first swig. Sweet brandy and port tones permeate. Very sugary sweet on the flavor overall though. Feel is standard. Borders on slightly syrupy. Drinkable. Sure. But for me this is an experience drink, not one to go back to again. I had it, and I will move on."
"Good head, nice dark tan color, good mouthfeel and incredibly drinkable for the alcohol content. I would (and have) recommended to everyone."
"D: I could drink this all day. Or until I succumbed to alcohol poisoning. There is ZERO indication of the ABV when drinking this one. I read some of the other reviews and I think I will try aging this beer."
"I picked up an aged bottle 2004 vintage form Tully's this is a different beast the alcohol is gone from the nose and flavor profile it get replaced with a much sweeter fruitiness. It gives me the feeling of a wheat wine in some ways. I never expected a few years would do so much for this brew I wouls easly bump everthing up by a factor of .5"
"Bottle via Irishkyle21. Apperanace is murky chestnut/iced tea. Head quickly dies. Nose is bready with banana phenols. Taste- very subtle mix of flavours. Caramel, bready, slightly fruity. Some chocolate and spices. Creamy mouthfeel, high medium to high carbonation. Finishes quite dry. Some booze is picked up at the finish. Great beer to start christmas eve off with."
"très belle bière brune -rouge orangé avec une mousse épaisse et onctueuse, elle a nez de blé, de sucre-brun, de caramel,et son goût est agréable, rond, elle se termine sur une finale de chocolat avec cerises aux marasquin, ce qui est exquis."
"D: A pretty easy drinking and tasty weizebock that lives up to its reputation, not really that refreshing this beer would be better served later in the night, perhaps after a meal."
"Very drinkable beer. One of my new favorites."
"Beer pours a copper color with a very long lasting white head. Nose is a very pleasant boquet of wheat and fruits. Taste is very wheaty, with hints of fruits and chocolate. Mouthfeel is very well carbonated and very smooth going across the palate. Overall drinkability is very good. The high abv is very well masked. This was a very pleasant discovery that will be sampled again in the future."
"Served in my New Glarus weisen glass. Good mahogany body with a HUGE off white head that lasts forever. Tons of visible carbonation. Crystal clear. Tons of dark fruits, spicy cloves, and a bready wheat base. Nice creamy spicy flavor with dark fruits. The wheat is hiding underneath. Ends with a nice spicy note. Nice thick creamy body that's great for the style. I'm not crazy about Weizenbocks in general, but this is a good beer."
"Pours a translucent amber with an off-white head. Lots of lacing can be seen. Smells sweet, with licorice present. Very complex flavour, tastes primarily of apple cider and raisins to me, with a nice creaminess to top it all off. The alcohol also gives it a nice warming quality, making it ideal for the winter months. Carbonation is strong at first, but I found this became much more moderate after it had sat for a while. Highly drinkable, especially for an 8% beer."
"Buy this beer. Buy a couple. Age some from multiple years."
"Cheers!!"
"Damn, I wish I never poured that first one out..."
"Finish is long and hefe-weizen fruit like."
"Drinkability: Good smooth beer that hides its 8% ABV well. Very high drinkability here. Highly recommended."
"Gods bless my wife for grabbing me something I've seen a million times, but never picked up."
"pours dark reddish brown with a double-bock-esque smell. taste is phenomenal all around. spice, woody flavors and sweetness checked well by hop bitterness. and despite its thick mouth feel, it's completely refreshing. easily my favorite german beer."
"Overall: I would try this out if you've walked past it. Awesome smell and flavor...enjoy this one with one with a calzone. The yeast and sweetness works well with the dough and spicy pepperoni!"
"The aroma improves remarkably, with a lot of sherry and chocolate notes. Taste seems a bit sweeter, but mouthfeel for some reason feels slightly watered down. Impressive after 9 years."
"Comment: I am becoming a real fan of Weizenbock...and this is the head of the class (so far)."
"Tastes as it smells. Wonderfull old style wheat beer. Everything I dream of in this style. A sweet cloudy big head wiezen!"
"Pours a muddy cider colour with a big white head that dies quick with no lacing. Smells much like apples, some dark fruit, and spicy clove. Taste as it smells with a nice hybrid of flavors going on. Very mild and somewhat creamy in the mouth. Very drinkable with no ABV noticeable."
"Drinkability: Excellent for a normal beer, outstanding for an 8.2% alcohol beer. So easy to drink that, if you have a high alcohol tolerance, this might be a decent session beer."
"Mmmmm, nice to finally compare the draft version to the bottle. This one poured with a lighter head and heavy haziness. Aroma wasn't as pronounced. Definitely sweeter at first then changing to a tartness that blends with the sweetness towards the end. Fun to experience the changing sweet to tart to blend of flavors."
"D: Drinkable, but too cloying to enjoy in large amounts. Probably won't drink again."
"Really worth trying, and a surprisingly pleasant admixture of styles that work well."
"D: So smooth and satisfying and full of complexity. This is art, no, ancient magic in a glass. A beautiful beer."
"Pours a dark red-brown, cloudy from all the yeast, big off-white head that faded quickly with little lacing. Heavy raisiny malts in the nose with some funky yeast spice and fruity wheat tartness (like sour bananas). Don't know that I've ever smelled a beer quite like it (well, this might be the only weizenbock I've ever tried). Tastes so good -- I'm getting roasted malts (chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts), that tart wheat flavor, the spicy phenols, the stewed fruits, and the warming alcohol. Big mouthfeel -- sticky and syrupy, but that feels right, and it finishes decently dry for the size of the body. I could sip this every night for the rest of my life. I need to invest in a case."
"Final Note: I have to get one of those Aventinus glasses!"
"Pours a dark brown with a slight orange tint. Biggish head that recedes rather quickly. General banana/clove smell of german wheat beers, with a significant extra something spicy. The taste never fails to baffle me with its complexity and deliciousness. Very malty and sweet for sure, but what it is that makes it so amazing, I do not know. Is there some black cherry in there? Maybe some toffee..Moderate to high carbination. Hops help to balance with a bit of bitterness but no noticable hop flavor, which doesn't take away from it at all. You would guess it had an above average abv based on the thickness alone, but its so tasty that it doesn't take away from the drinkability. I'm just thankful that one of the best german beers is one of the easiest to find as well."
"D: Quite drinkable, as much as it ever was, but flavors drop off a bit, which is to be expected. On a side note, swirling the yeast at the bottom and adding just a bit brought out some more phenolic character that was rather interesting. Overall, I found this aged version to be enjoyable, but it may have been even better after only a year or so, rather than four. Still, an interesting experiment with tasty results."
"Fantastic beer."
"What can I say, it's a classic. Although the style is not my favorite, I can appreciate a good beer when I taste one, and this is a good beer. It's even a favorite of one of my macro-drinking friends. You really can't go wrong with Aventinus. Recommended to all, but especially fans of strong wheat beers."
"D - Great Beer. This was my first weizenbock and I was not disappointed. I happily enjoyed a 2nd."
"Edit: I have to amend my review. My nose was really screwed up the day of my first tasting of this; this is very aromatic. I get a MUCH stronger nose of a woody raisin, very, very nice!"
"i've only tried a few weizenbocks & none were dunkels, so i'm not an expert by far, well, here it goes ; pours a slightly cloudy copper-brown w/ a thick off-white head which dissapates quickly, little lacing ; a stong wheaty alcohlic smell, with a tart fruity aroma as well ; a nice blend of malts & wheat, a tangy zip at the beginning w/ some slight caramelish flavor in there as well, fllowed by an interesting spicey/bannana/raisin/ I-dont-know flavor, quite a wild and indescribable combination, changes throughout the session, but tastes great, like it ""belongs"" there, reminds me of a belgian, only drier ; a full mouthfeel, but not too much that it becomes ""cloying", the carbonation may be what makes it feel lighter, there's plenty of that in this one ; an excellent brew, i will drink it again & again, but will have to limit myself to a few ( Wifey's law, statute 419.32...."" Any brew over 8.00% ABV must be consumed in moderation."")...."
"Pours a deep, rich brown with nice thick head. Head quickly dissolves and leaves no lace trails. Smell initially is of alcohol and some fruit but I cant put my finger on what. Grape? Cherry? Something, just cant distinguish. Taste is very good. Again, alcohol is present (almost a little too much) however there is a slightly sweet chocolate taste, its very subtle, but there. Overall good balance and leaves a bread/grainy aftertaste as with many wheat beers. Moderate carbonation leaves more of a crisp feel to the drink which I felt was enjoyable. Overall a good beer with a nice kick to it."
"Drinkability - Good beer to enjoy after a dinner. Given the high alcohol content, I would enjoy two at one sitting."
"I gotta go average here. This beer hasnt done much to awe me. Its a decent beer, but Im not getting the part thats going to being me back to it unless Im in Germany ;)"
"D- This beer has a strong taste, but it's mainly yeastiness. If there was something more complex it would be delicious, but as it is, it's hard to justify such a deliciousness."
"This was a very good place to start for my first Weizenbock. Very good beer worthy of the praise."
"D - A nice beer for sure. Not something I'd drink often but once in a while wouldn't be bad."
"Pretty darn good beer. Not for everyday use, but a nice change from the ordinary."
"Thanks, Bob! Wonderful beer, with a lackluster appearance. Muddy, interesting color is deep amber with a touch of violet. Thin head disappeared instantly. Smell is delicious, dark fruit, bubblegum, wheaty freshness. The taste is killin'. A tremendous blast of fruit, creamy malt and zesty hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is superb. This is the most Belgian-tasting German beer I've had. Reminds me of Chimay Grande Reserve."
"D- may be too fruity and sweet for me, i'm a savory kind of guy. seemed belgian like chimay or trois pistoles which kinda threw me off. much different compared to the few other bocks i've had."
"Pours a dark brown with huge head. Leaves wonderful lacing. Smelll is full of malt and wheat sweetness. The taste has hints of fruit and even some chocolate. There is a large amount of sweetness in the taste but I think it makes this a really nice drink. The mouthfeel has lots of body. This was the beer that I drink when I want something familar but I always enjoy having one. Also had on draught which is excellent."
"Excellent for a cool-weather wheat beer, a celebratory treat, or just whenever for lovers of big malty beers, this is one of my all time favorite German beers and one I often share with friends just beginning to discover the world of fine beers. Always good, when served at just the right time this beer is incredible!"
"Drinkability : a very good weizenbock beer, very complex and sophisticated"
"D - Fine, can mix with plenty of dishes. Would recommend."
"Pours a very cloudy light brown. Thin light head dissipates quickly with little lacing. The cloudiness makes the color fascinating. Smell is fantastic. I can tell this is going to be a great wheat. Taste is amazing... complex with spiciness that lingers on the palate. It has all the spiciness and drinkability of a traditional hefeweizen but packs a bigger punch. The taste seems to go on forever. This is the kind of beer that you could drink all night."
"Pricey, but delicious."
"D - This is a good beer. Only my second weizenbock...it didn't seem as flavorful as Avery's Thirteen, but it is still good."
"Holy schlamoly batman What a fantastic brew. I see that this beer is well reviewed but I have never seen it in North Texas so I had Ungespundet send me a bottle staight from Bavaria. Pours out of the bottle a cloudy dark brew with a good head that faded to a small one fast. The smell was absolutly fantastic. Malt, fruit , spice all rolled into one. I never had a better tasting beer. All the flavors are so well balanced. Every sip this beer gets better and better. It goes without saying this beer is the worlds best weizenbock but it may just be the worlds best beer. I like it so much I am going to visit the brewery next week."
"Finally got around to reviewing this beer, one of my favorites. Good stuff!"
"500 ml bottle poured into a Schneider Weisse Weizen glass with a nice, frothy head that dissipates fairly quickly. The appearance is of dark honey, brown, slightly cloudy. The smell is spicy, with raisins and alcohol. The taste is also spicy, with raisins, alcohol but also some banana and caramel, with some slight bitterness in the back. Mouthfeel is smooth, velvety. This is a very good beer, rich and complex. I'll definitely buy again."
"Schneider makes my favorite wheat beers through and through. This is as good as they do."
"One of my favorite doppelbocks."
"Capping my personal ""trilogy"" of Schneiders available at Bottle King, I saved the richest for last...deep purple mahogany body with a tremendous, lasting head--the doppel effect is clearly noticed...notes of perfume, flowers, grapes and cassis--complex...medium to full body with a soft finish...alcohol is only hinted at ( a slight wine burn?)...bubbles form gently around tongue...moderate to heavy acidic pressure...strong winish presence...overall, a confounding creation--a dark wheat abbey that really comes on like a merlot...the head adds flavor throughout the evening, and suddenly, like a wine, you realize how sneaky quick the good feeling of this brew is upon you...nicely done"
"This probably doesn't come as a surprise to me since their stronger eisbock version is one of my favorites. Believe the hype behind this one! Enjoy this on a cool night to fullfill the warming effect at its best."
"I just love this beer."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown color with a cream colored head. The aroma is spicy with the wheat quite noticeable. The taste is sweet and floral  also, some ester flavors. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is apparent. Overall, this is a nicely balanced, easy drinking brew."
"D: If this beer was slightly less carbonated, I'd have to say it was an awesome, very drinkable beer. While the alcohol level is pretty high, the smooth malts and the banana esters make it sweet and easy to drink, hiding the alcohol from the palate. Definitely a good brew."
"Had this from the bottle at Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Poured an attractive caramel/brown color. Had a nice white head that hung around a while. Aroma is sweet, possibly of caramel and brown sugar. Flavor is sweet up front, but finishes with a bit of a sour note. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is high for a beer with an abv north of 8%. My first weizenbock."
"Overall: A classic example of the style and a brew I admittedly over-look when searching for a sweet rich brew. After this time around i don't see that happening again. Recommended"
"M: Highly carbonated, which is probably why it seems so light for such a dark, rich bock. Medium-bodied. Not syrupy despite the sweetness. Very easily drinkable, with a well-hidden ABV. I highly recommend this beer especially with a nice mild grilled steak."
"Pours a very dark brown copper color with a nice head that leave little lacing. Spicy and fruity aroma. Flavor is quite complex. Toasted malt and fruit. Spicy and banana wheat flavors. Just a touch of bitterness and a nice lingering sweet taste in the finish. Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Pretty drinkable stuff and a really excellent wheat beer overall."
"This is the first wheat doppelbock I have had before. It pours a deep dark brown color. It also has a full body of chocolate fruit and spices in the palate. Uniquely enough, it has a very clovelike finish. This beer is rated high for a reason. I recommend it to anyone. Goes especially well with brie."
"with this ale- it definately hits above it's weight. Go get some. NOW."
"Delciously smooth lucious body. Md-heavy carbonation and md liquid."
"This one just may have made it to my top 10 list. (It's a short list overall -- I live in Alabama)."
"The taste is equally scrumptious, a handful of flavors rolling around each other in perfect balance. There are spices of pepper and clove, faint apple and banana through the finish, faint chocolate, some brown sugar and raisin. Its hard to pick out, because they are so well infused. The body is pretty full, warming (8%? really?), just enough carbonation. In all, its nicely unlike any other beer I've had, very good, well worth the reputation, and for what its worth, very much recommended."
"at 8.2% it is very drinkable but i can't help the feeling that i won't be in a hurry to pick up this beer at the store again."
"d: this beer never ceases to amaze me. amazingly drinkable given its balance and smooth character. just one of the best brews, not just doppelbock, around."
"This is my first crack at a weizenbock and it is very good."
"D. I can't wait for it to get cold here. This is a great cold weather beer. If you are ever tempted to partake of several HG beers this is the beer!!!"
"long live the Weisses Brauhaus!!"
"Enjoyed every ounce, can't wait to get another."
"hazy, brown in the middle and lighter on the outside. nice little head that goes away quickly and leaves little lace. smells of clove, banana, a little malt and a little dried fruit. not overpowering and nicely blended. tastes the same. not overboard. luxurious. great mouthfeel. easy drink. best i've had in this style. hands down."
"Drinkability: A very refreshing beer. Alcohol is high but well disguised in this beer. The clove/bananas character can make this beer hard to really session on since it quickly loses the refreshing crispness of a traditional wheat beer. Very filling and better for a nice autumn refresher."
"This beer is an excellent example of the style, and is easily one of my favorites. Its drinkability is top-notch and is really a beer that I could enjoy year round with anything."
"Chilled and poured into big Weizen glass, nice one finger foamy off white head, with decent retention, but a little on the week side. The body is clowdy and rich milk chocolate, caramel brown color, very opaque, murky with tones of green apple around the base and surface of the mass. Smell is classic and very aromatic with lots of ""banana nut bread"" hints of spice and fruit from yeast not exactly fermentation temps? Hops are not very present in the aroma, the yeast backed by malt are really the showcase of this beer. Flavor is very rich and malt forward hops are are not very present in the flavor other than a contribution of bitterness. Yeast has played quit a large role in shaping the taste of this beer which is very nice. As mentioned in the smell clover banana nut bread with a touch of sourness toward the finish. The ABV is strong, but still at a very drinkable level this is a totally quaffable beer."
"One of my favorite beers. I aged this one for 6 months. Highly refreshing and extremely drinkable this is a true ""any time"" kind of beer. Pours with a big head that eventually comes to rest but still lasts till the end. A beautiful light rusty brown colour. Smells of malts, cloves, fruits ( raisins, bananas?) and alcohol. Has a lovely palate, malty, fruity and a nice warming alcohol profile also fairly sour on the finish. A true champion of complexity."
"Drinkability- this is a good beer and would recommend this to friends."
"A dark 'n delicious beauty of a beer! Boasting an incredibly rich, nutty flavor with strong hints of spice - cinnamon and clove come immediately to my senses. With a sweet aroma and a silken mouthfeel akin to what might be a sort of liquid velvet, the thick and longevitous head comprised of fine bubbles tops off what is one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure to experience. So spicy she is that this would not be a beer I drink in robust quantity, rather one to savor and let linger on the palate while the ripe fruity scents waft up to the nose and prelude the slightly bitter, ever so smooth finish fit for kings."
"Great drinkability, ABV may limit some, the taste is so welcoming."
"Pours cloudy and brown, with a good sized head of fine bubbles. Aroma has strong notes of vanilla, dark cherry, and light clove. Some alcohol present in the nose as well. Flavor displays chewy melanoidin richness with an underlying fruity character and a light tanginess as well. A classic example of a good weizenbock from a well respected German weissbier brewery. Recommended."
"D- this is very drinkable, i will be getting this one again."
"A bit hearty to drink this one all night, and eventually you want to switch to something different. But to it's credit you can start or finish your night with this one and be equally satisfied. Such a great combination of refreshment and flavor. A true great."
"I tried this beer on July 5, 2007 after purchasing it from my local LCBO store. It poured a dark thick brownish colour into the glass with a large loose head that dissipated quite slowly. The aroma is a combination of malt and wheat tones. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with hints of carbonation. The taste is also thick with hints of malt and yeast."
"I think this is my first weizenbock and since it is a top 100 beer, I had to buy it. I poured this into a weizen glass (duh) and the head was aggressively foamy and cream colored. The actual beer is dark, cloudy brown with red at the bottom and edges. It smells very yeasty, cloves, and spice. Tastes like spice, clove, yeast, wheat,some chocolate (barely), and some dark fruit, little apricot (which I havent had in years). Alcohol was unnoticeable but the phenols were certainly there. Good stuff."
"Pours deep brown with an excellent cream colored head. This brew smells of sweet fruits. The taste is also of sweet fruit, namely dried apricot and darker fruit. It is highly carbonated with an average viscosity. It is fairly drinkable however it just isnt my style, the taste really doesn't do it for me."
"Poured slightly cloudy, wood brown color with a thick tan head. Good retenetion, thin but steady lace. Spicy, yeast aroma with a bit of malt sweetness. First taste is peppery and spicey like a hefe, with a bit of citrus. Later the roasted malt and some nuttiness comes through. Complex flavor, yet still well balanced. Clean and fruity, dry finish, no lingering aftertaste. You would never know it is a strong 8% beer. Pricey, but a gem."
"Drinkability - The ease that this went down is both it's strength and it's weakness. I could very easily down another of these with great ease. The depth of this beer makes it one of my favorate Weizenbocks."
"Not quite as refreshing as a hefe, and I don't have a lot of weizenbocks to compare this to, but this is a world class brew."
"Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours a hazy dark brown with a huge fluffy off-white head. It smells like plums, bananas, cloves and some lemon. Overall it's a sweet and spicy smelling beer, but the aroma isn't overpowering but still good. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but I can also taste some bubblegum, caramel and wheat/yeast. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma is. Mouthfeel is medium/full with a lot of carbonation, but the carbonation works in this beer very well. Drinkability is pretty good, the beer goes down smooth and is easy to drink. The alcohol is pretty well hidden considering it's 8.2% ABV. I think this is a very good beer, I'm impressed with it. Looks and tastes great! I'll buy it again!"
"D - Overall this was fantastic, drinkability superb and definatly one of the best beers I have ever had. I would put this up against and Belgian, any day. Really just a pleasure to drink. I cannot wait until the distributor gets this in around here, I have already cleared a spot in the fridge for it!"
"Poured a dark amberish brown. Nice near white head, three fingers then fading to one, then to none. Smell is great. Spicy and sweet. Some lemon and banana in there. Taste follows smell pretty closely. Definitely full of flavor for sure. Spicy fruits again and even some hints of caramel malts. Mouthfeel is about medium though lacking a little carbonation. Still very, very refreshing. Drinkability is pretty scary. Says 8.2% on the label but i don't detect that at all. Enjoyable brew after burning up on the golf course. Not sure why I've never picked this up, it's well worth it."
"Definitely a classy beer, enjoy!"
"D- This is a wonderful beer. The only thing that didn't agree with me so much is the very apparent alcohol smell. I'd still recommend this beer to be had seasonally, as it is very enjoyable but probably not in every setting."
"Very nice brew. High drinkability, could be dangerous. Definately one of my favorites. Blends together well, and rolls off very well in the month. I have used this beer many times to introduce friends to beer outside the package store. Overall a truly well done beer.Very tasty and highly recommended."
"Highly recommended. A true classic."
"What do you say about Aventinus? This is easily one of my all-time favorite brews. I'm rating this one based on the bottle, but I've also had it on draft in the States and Germany, and there's not a big difference between any of them...they are all world-class when fresh! This would easily be one of my ""five desert island"" brews. I used to enjoy many other German-style hefeweizens, but Aventinus has killed my enjoyment of most other ""regular"" hefes. I've had the Aventinus Eisbock on several occasions as well, but I enjoy this version the most. This has an incredible mixture of the classic German wheat beer flavors, while condensing them, yet not over-doing them. The spicy, clovey phenolics are in perfect harmony here. This brew sets the standard for all other dark-ish weizenbocks. Way-to-go Schneider! Please don't ever change this one nor stop brewing it."
"Drinkability. Dangerous one here...smooth and clean."
"-Oelergud"
"Taste is full of the typical weiss flavours, only taken to the next level of intensity. Banana, pear, clove, nuts, caramel, vanilla, coriander, all combined in a liquid bread experience. Wow is the word here... Body is good and thick and heavy but a little more carbonated than I might like, a mild quibble. This is so drinkable for the strength, but a little dangerous because of it. I love this style, even though I've only had two examples in my life, a wonderful spring brew."
"Based on what I have read about this style, this beer sounds like a great style example, but as I found, this is not my style."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Aggressive pour yielded lots of head -creamy but noticeable carbonation. Took longer than I expected for it to settle leaving light lace. Dark amber and cloudy in appearance. Sweet aroma in the nose. Familiar yeast taste of a wheat beer but with more sweet malt accompanying it. Hops and alcohol are present at the back. Yeast forward -Malt middle - slight Alcohol at the end. Very drinkable, especially at 8%. Will definitely have this again."
"What a terrific beer! Highly recommended."
"Couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this yet, it's widely available at better beer stores and I've loved it since the first one. Huge wheat beer, no lack of flavor. Incredible brewing technique results in an unfiltered, top fermented bockbeer of absolutely world class."
"Overall I love it and I will continue to drink it."
"D: A delicious mixture of exceptional aromas and flavors coupled with a creamy mouthfeel that is to die for!"
"D: Stunned its %8. Goes down very easily, very smooth. Excellent beer, especially on tap."
"Overall, very nice just not my favourite style."
"Drinkability: Either way -- one nice and slow or a massive stein to quench your thirst, appetite, and mind -- this beer is a true gem. I think reguardless of personal preference everyone will enjoy a bottle of this beer."
"Overall i recommend this. The flavor is very distinct>awsome"
"The mouthfeel is heavy, laden with yeast and some crisp carbonation. Even at 8% ABV, it's as poundable as any wheat beer on Earth."
"Love the purple label, makes the bottle stick out on a shelf. This pours a dark ruby color with slightly off white head that just billows in my hefe glass. Just from the 16.9 oz. bottle it felt like I had to do a Guinness pour just to get the whole damn bottle in the glass. Good off the bat. The smell has a whisk of alcohol to it already and this is dead ""bock"" cold, and it shows in the taste right after the immediate sip is taken. Has alot of character to it underneath though, its just the alcohol masks it fairly heavily unfortunately... ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WHEAT INFLUENCE!!! The mouthfeel is quite good, and makes for an interesting mix of wheat ale character and bock sweetness. A very interesting beer, however not my style. Well...not yet at least. I recommend it as something every BA should try."
"This beer has a deep brown opaque color. It has strong fruit smell, particular bananas and some slight prune overtones. The beer is moderately carbonated but that is balanced with the strong banana flavor. It was served on-tap with a slight head that left moderate lacing that did not stay long. The taste is sweet through and through, giving it a balanced flavor. It has a smooth taste and finish. An excellent on-tap selection."
"D - Worth a few numbers around the dance floor until you need to take a cab home; this girl can dance."
"Poured into a Weizen glass. The color is a nice deep, dark amber that has about 1 finger worth of head to start, but that disappears quickly leaving no lacing; lots of carbonation bubbles as well. The smell is dominated by clove and banana with a slight roasted character as well. The taste is huge on banana & the spicy clove character as well and the finish is dry and slightly citrusy - a perfect dessert beer. This is a well carbonated beer, but a little more creaminess and this would be better off. This beer is absolutely delicious & a wonderful example of what this style (and beer in general) should strive to be. Highest recommendation."
"I have enjoyed this beer over the years, both in the US and in Germany. It is the epitome of the style, weizenbock, in my humble opinion. There is none better!"
"D: Less drinkable than a hefeweizen, more drinkable than a doppelbock, imagine that! Wish there was a 4.25 for this category, but gave it the benefit of the doubt."
"I personally wouldn't throw back a bunch of these (too sweet, and too much alcohol), but a pleasant to drink, big wheat beer."
"Overall: A dunkel-weizen bock? First Ive tried, and its damned good. A good example of a sort of off-the-wall style, and a must-try for even the mildly obsessive completist."
"Drinkability is limited only by availability, bank account balance, and alcohol tolerance. Strange that the Eisbock is available in Kansas but not this better original. This is one of the first beers I grab when visiting KC to bring back here. Not my favorite, but still among the must-haves."
"D - Very tasty beer, could be a benchmark for the style. I like the different it brings to beer community."
"drinkability - Sipper type of beer. Enjoyable."
"very good stuff!"
"A treat to say the least - the clove and spice is just right for me. The malt flavour is not overly ""wheaty"" but it is outstanding."
"What can be said about Aventinus that hasn't been said before. This beer is is what beer should be. If you have never had this before, do your self a favor and find it immediately. Enjoy ever last bit of it, as if it's your last. It's really that good."
"Poured from a half liter bottle into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a thick head that reduces down to some wisps and a bank around the rim. Smells sweet with a little spice. Tastes rich and malty with that wheat taste in the back. The mouthfeel is amazing, thick and solid with a lingering savory finish. I want to know why I don't drink this more often."
"Pours dark chestnut with a thin head that fades pretty quickly. The smell is of wheat that is reminiscent of wasa crackers with a sweet rounded malt and a nice yeastiness. Beautifully balanced flavor of alcohol, malt, prunes, figs, cereal grain, and a touch of cellared apples. Very creamy and with a medium body that is just right to support the alcohol and flavors. Extremely drinkable- just the perfect thing for a spring day."
"I've tasted more complex beers, but this one is still pretty good and pretty drinkable. I have to wonder what some aging would do."
"D- Drinkable, but not special. Fruity, but boring."
"D: Extremely drinkable. I really love this beer. One of my favorites.I want to get some more tonight. Hmmm. Let's do it."
"Pours an almost inky black with a head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Smells sweet, with fruits like grapes, and a sharp note in the background. The smell definitely gives away its wheat nature. The taste has more roast than the smell, with an almost charcoal-like bit up front. But not in a bad way. If that makes sense. The sweetness comes through next, with a bit of fruit but then a surprisingly dry finish. The mouthfeel includes a healthy carbonation followed by a viscous oily feel. Very nice indeed. The drinkability is excellent. This is one that just cries out for a patio, some shade, and a sunny but cool breeze-y afternoon. Who's ready to move to Munich!?!"
"Wow, what a fantastic beer. I have had this in the past, but i marvel at it every time"
"This is a real butt-kicker and pairs really well with boratta..."
"I was introduced to this beer back in 1998 and have never looked back. If the world was left with only 5 beers, I would hope this would be one of them."
"Drinkability- Fantastic. Wish I had one more bottle to enjoy. It's a very drinkable wheat that may be one of the best I've tasted (Can't beat Paulaner IMO)."
"500 ml., 8.2% ABV, the date code reads-06.310. Pours a cloudy dark brown color, with some copper hues on the sides. Thick off white foamy head, which holds together very well. Fruity, spicy, and bannana notes in the nose. A whiff of darker fruit follows in the background. A bit of chocolate up front, followed by dark fruit. Finishes with a bit of clove and spice. Warming alcohol presence. Nice fruity flavors with just a bit of tartness. Medium body, and spritzy. Very hearty and enjoyable. This is a solid beer."
"An excellent, decadent sipper. Great for a winter night, or to sustain onself throughout lent. Also a truely great example of a wheat beer, and how wheat beers can be as rich and full in flavour as any all barley brews. Best wheat beer I've had the pleasure of enjoying yet. Highly recommended."
"D- This is an amazing beer. Might have just made it up to one of my top beers. Before I say that I want to have it a few more times but I am sure that will happen very shortly."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers, and certainly a go-to when wanting a beer that makes you think how great this bubbly beverage that is called beer is."
"Though it was an obvious guess, I didn't believe it before I tried it: it really tastes and smells like something of a cross between a weissbier and a doppelbock! Very unique and I really enjoy it. Certainly a beer to get again from time to time. And definitely something that everyone should try."
"Would make a nice dinner beer to say the least, but a bit too sweet and strong to pound more than 1 or 2 in a sitting."
"D: Drinkability overall is good. Soft yet crisp mouthfeel makes this feel almost like a session brew. However, the high ABV limits it. I almost wish it felt more like a sipping beer. Either way it's damn good. Benchmark for the style. This is definitely a beer I'll be drinking again."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Aventinus glass. Appears a deep, dark mahogany with a finger of tan creamy foam. Smells of chocolate vanilla and dried cherries. Taste is very malty with notes of raisin, chocolate, molasses and a touch of banana. Very complex. Full bodied and really rich. A very satisfying beer. Always a classic in my eyes. Highly recommended."
"This is a great beer and worthy of being at the top of its style, but it leaves me wishing for a bit more. Perhaps I'm spoiled having such access to a beer like this, or perhaps it's just has qualities that are inherent to the style that I wish it didn't. Probably a combination of both. I really like this beer, though. I just don't love it."
"This brew is dangerously drinkable, as it's difficult to notice you're drinking a high-alcohol content beverage unless you've read the label. Use caution. ;)"
"Brown bottle from Florian's. Hazy/murky brown body with a couple inches of more of light tan amazingly creamy-looking head. Pretty agressive carbonation in this one. Banana dominates the aroma with hints of smoke, spice, citrus and yeast. Banana, spice, and hints of smoke and nut comprise the flavor. Fairly clean finish with just a hint of cloves on the tounge. Creamy mouthfeel that isn't sticky or syrupy at all IMO. Alcohol is also barely noticeable, best as I can tell. This beer is great - like a Hef, only more complex, tasty, and satisfying. Superb. I can see this beer having a regular place in my DBF."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is fenolic and dry, with some exotic fruits, ripe bananas most of all. The wheat is very apparent and makes the beer very mild and gives a very soft mouthfeel. Body is full, but very drinkable. A good, decent Weizenbock with a good balance."
"Mouthfeel, very fizzy carbonation, lots of bubbles, some tart dryness in the finish. Taste is very much hefeweizen crisp and refreshing, with more caramelized roasty maltedness on the midpalate and the finish, when the tart tannins come in. Some dry cocoa and plum flavors next. Cloves (lots of long-lasting cloves) and cinnamon-sugar toast are the really nice flavors in the finish. To me, that palate-smacking tannic finish detracts from the drinkability just a bit--it's just very very, dry. I can easily believe that this is a perfect example of this style. Very happy to try it, and I will jump at the chance to order this on tap if the opportunity ever presents itself. Really complex brew with a lot going on."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a hint of amber. Has a huge tan head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves great lacing. Aroma and taste are both sweet, wheaty, and almost spicy. Hints of banana are present in the taste as well. Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. The sweetness of this may be too much to drink a six pack of, but it's something you'll want to sip and savior anyway."
"I could guzzle this all night long, and I have in fact gotten into trouble with it a few times because it is so easy to drink. I want to savor it, and yet I can't get enough. Definitely one of the best beers on Earth."
"This was my first weizenbock. Had it a Pazzo's in Lexington. Pours a nice looking dark brown color with a slight head. Smells much like a hefe but one that was injected with alcohol. Normal bannanas and citric sweetness. Taste much the same, but lots of heat on this one! Mild chocolate as it warms. Overall very interesting but I thought the alcohol over powered this brew a bit much for me."
"D - Very tasty beer, could be a benchmark for the style."
"I would recommend you try this beer."
"Dark, rich and sweet. The wheat base to the bock gives it a tall, white rockey head and removed all astringency from the mouthfeel. Aromas of cloves and very, very slight banana and vanilla aspects. The malty bock backbone and lager fermentation suppress most of the yeasty/bready fresh aspects and give it some legs in the bottle."
"D: Mighty fine brew, one that grows on you as the beer drains down the gullet. Great balance between banana and caramel. Inspired me to drink another German beer after this one."
"Brunnen getan, meine Deutschen Brüder, gut getanPairs as well with bacon wrapped bockwurst, as it does with a medium rare filet mignon...enjoy"
"D- absolutely love this one, had it many a time, cant believe this is the first time i'm reviewing it, would absolutely freak out if I could find this on tap somewhere"
"Again, I simply can't stress how fine of an effort this beer is. Has to be the best German beer I've ever tasted, and I can't imagine anything in the future tasting any better than this."
"It took about 5 minutes to get this poured, this beer was very foamy, but it was worth the wait and the effort. The color is dark chestnutty brown with a near white head that has amazing retention, the beer is fairly clear except for the bits of yeast floating around. The smell was at first dominated by wheat beer yeast, cloves and slight fruit notes. Once the head settles a bit some wheat, alcohol and dark malt begins to come through. The taste was much like the smell with the yeast flavors dominating to begin with, especially in the head, with everything blending together a bit after some time. There is a strong wheat beer aftertaste with this as well some alcoholic hotness with very little in the way of hop flavor. Mouthfeel is good highly carbonated with full body. This is a beer to be reckoned with, I doubt that there are many weizenbocks that resemble this one."
"Seek this one out. It seems like the 2001 year is ripe and ready now. I recently had a vintage '99 bottle that hadn't held up nearly as nice as this one."
"500ml bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a slightly cloudy brown with a fair amount of carbonation. Very nice wheaty aroma. Taste is rich, complex and lovely and full of wheat and malt and a bit of spice. Great lingering aftertaste. I'm not one that is able to pick out a bunch of distinct tastes within the beer, so I won't even try... All I know is that this beer is wonderful!"
"This is an easy-drinking beer despite the 8 per cent ABV, but is best enjoyed when it's sipped. Go slow and appreciate its greatness."
"Pours with a moderate head with very good retention. Looks dark but when held up to the light it is a cloudy amber color. Fairly intense carbonation that invites you to drink more. The smell is a strong spicy fruitiness. Very malty taste with bits of pepper, cloves, and banana showing through. The aftertaste is bitter but not overwhelmingly so. I could have a few of these, but the high alcohol level might limit that. Very enjoyable beer that I plan on getting again."
"It's taste and depth give it a hefty mouthfeel. Really want to take it slow to appreciate."
"This is so utterly delicious, but it's a little ""hot"" for an 8-percenter, and maybe just a little far over on the desserty side to make it an everyday indulgence. Or, screw it, indulge. You only live once. Chalk another one up for the Germans."
"About a three quarter inch head that was very frothy. I was suprised as to how murky the appearance was. Dark bread and hay aroma with some dough and moderate yeast. Dry tecture and a great level of carbonation. I've not had many of this style, but I certainly will be buying more of this."
"A wonderful complex brew with a moderate alcohol hit. Beautiful"
"The wonderful mouthfeel, balance, complexities and well-masked alcohol make this a very drinkable beer."
"The initially massive head has a sweet malty smell that is fruity (banana) and lightly spicy with hints of chocolate and some alcoholic aromas. The pour is crystal clear and a caramel color with red hues. The taste is primarily that of toasted malt with some toffee notes. The Aventinus is medium bodied with medium low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. The finish remains malty but dries out nicely with a lingering hint of hop bitterness. Overall a very drinkable beer given the high ABV."
"This is a powerful looking beer. Thick brown and hazy with a big billowing light-tan head. I love wheat beers, but sometimes I'm in the mood for something heavier....this is the best of both worlds. Smooth yeast aroma. Complex flavors...spice, cloves, banana. Not too fruity. And surprisingly creamy for a wheat beer, but still finishes crisp. Very full and chewy in the mouth...slightly malty. The only problem is a slight ethanol bite I get every few sips. Not an everyday beer, but amazing for special occasions."
"A very cloudy brown/dark amber beer. Has a small beige head that evaporates quickly. A lot of clove character up front in the aroma. With some nutty malt notes in the background. The taste is malty sweet at first with some dried fruit notes in the middle. You get a hint of clove on the finish. Followed by the warming alcohol note on the end."
"Pours a deep red brown color with a slightly off-white head that is smaller in stature than I'd have thought it might be ... appears well carbonated, and some residual yeast in the pour toward the end. The nose is what I'd expect from a Weizenbock ... wheat, sweet malt, and a hint or two of mollasses. The pronounced yeast character almost smells Belgian to me. Palate is a nice agressive up front with good yeast and malted grain notes. Strong carbonation. Some slight spiciness, but mostly the sweet malts and a little banana bread suggestion. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but well balanced with the sweetness finishing pleasingly dry. Medium mouthfeel over all. I like this ... I can't say it quite lives up to the expectations I had for it, based on reputation, but this is a solid, Weizenbock all the way. If you're one for the style, it's a must try."
"Don't know what went wrong last time, but this was very agreeable. I would not go so far to call it a favorite, but I'll certainly keep a couple on hand."
"Note: I had originally thought that this was a regular doppelbock, but as I have not had a doppelbock either, my warning still applies"
"Smells just like a dunkelweizen with some alcohol and banana esters; perhaps a whiff of hop aroma. Vibrant, active head and a murky, rich brown color beneath. Strong bublegum with a sweet malt and a hint of hop dryness in the finish. There is a slight tartness missing from doppelbocks (maybe from the wheat?) Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable."
"Overall, tough for me to judge. To be honest, I'm not a fan of wheat beers, but this one is obviously well beyond most other brews. If you're a fan of the style, you don't need me to tell you to try it."
"I love the intensity of character here without a terrible amount of sweetness. It really makes this beer satisfying and drinkable. The only minor disappointment is that it doesn't have much in the way of complexity, although that shouldn't be surprising given the simplicity of the ingredients."
"It pours a dark purplish brown with a simply enormous head. I poured this beer into a large glass stein and had to pause for quite some time for this monster head to go down. As it did so, small clumps of this frothy head were left behind. Oddly, the head consisted of large bubbles toward its base, and the top of the head was almost like whipped egg whites. Real nice smelling beer, sweet malts, caramel, and a grape like fruitiness that I was not expecting. It is the same in taste. Terrific. Very smooth, the well measured carbonation lends a creamy mouthfeel. A nice spice twang that seems to eminate from the alcoholic warm in the back. I might sense a slight hop hint as well. Nice and balanced. Very enjoyable."
"Definately a high quality beer, no doubt, no question about it. If I gave it a rating though, I'd probably give it an 88. It was good, but as the first 90+ rated beer I've had, I have yet to be blown away."
"Overall an excellent beer. The natural progression up from the hefe. Remarkably drinkable."
"D: Don't get me wrong, its really good. But I don't think it is $5 a pint at a liquor store good. I'd much rather go and spend $12 on a four pack of Celebrator if I'm in a mood for something along these lines. Definitely worth a try, because I could see someone who thinks this beer is great."
"This is my favorite Weizenbock hands down with only Victory Moonglow even coming remotely close to this in flavor and body. This is on my top 10 (maybe 5) all time best brews ever. Timeless."
"D: Could drink this one all the time. Very pleasant that is enjoyable thru and thru. Easy drinking for a complex beer. Almost anyone could drink this one, even the beer haters."
"I liked the drinkability. The after taste is very nice and. Leaves a nice fruity taste which kinda hides the 8% alcohol congtent although I can see that drinking a lot of this beer could be dangerous if you want to drive a car or operate heavy machinery."
"Pours a nice, deep brown. Good sized tan head with nice lacing. Has an alcoholic nose, with clove, fruit and banana. Taste starts off sweet with a little bit of fruity tang, plus some slight caramel flavors. Finishes more with clove and an alcoholic taste. Heavy and creamy... though there is a crispness to the beer as well."
"A very interesting and delicious beer. A fine addition to any German beer fans repetoir."
"This is massive beer by every measure, especially taste, smell, mouthfeel, alcohol content. The color is deep brown, almost beginning to redden with sparkling carbonation. The offwhite head was small and dissipated quickly and no lace ever formed. The smell is smoky and clove-spicy with dark fruity aromas. The higher than average alcohol is detectable in the nose. The taste is complex and multilayered with deep wheaty malts and bready notes followed by sharp spicy phenols with significant tart character. The mouthfeel is warming from the alcohol to be sure and very carbonated and crisp, almost sharp. The finish is long and not solventy, but a bit hot. This is very drinkable, in spite of its high alcohol content. A superb beer."
"Pours a hazy brown with a 1 inch layer of creamy off white head on top. This beer has the best head retention I've ever seen. Aroma is yeasty, smells like a wheat beer, masking most of the malts. Carmel like malts and maybe chocolate are evident in the flavor along with the yeasty flavor. There is a faint alcohol burn in the finish, but overall it hides the high alcohol volume well. Full bodied. Drinkability is great, it would be easy to drink more than one (but it might not be a good idea)."
"Drinkability: Good, but not exceptional."
"Drinkability: The only thing about this beer that I had any issue with. Not that it's necessarily hard to drink, but that it is something that should not be consumed in any sort of excess due to it's overall sweetness, amount of yeast and alcohol content. Not a beer to trifle with, which is sad, because it's so delicious."
"Drinkability: This beer stays interesting through the whole session which is helped by its full flavored nature. The one draw back is how rich it is."
"5-11-12 - Changed the overall rating. This is 5.0 beer if there ever was one."
"Overall imo this brew is really good. Love the subtle flavor of clove, fruit and root beer. Having drank several weizenbock this is the best on so far."
"For most of the flavor being on the sweetside the finish leans toward a dry clovelike finish. This company is the king of wheat beers!"
"Drinkability is good but the alcohol content is a bit high for a session beer."
"The beer had a cloudy brown color with hints of orange and a thin off-white head. The smell had prunes, some banana, and a bit of alcohol/clove spiciness. The taste is right on to the style; it has dark fruit mixed with bready malts with some banana and vanilla in there too. It also has a faint taste of chocolate. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with a high level of carbonation; I am always amazed when a beer is real creamy with this high carbonation."
"Overall: I didnt particularly like this one. I dont know what is was, but I just didnt like it. Sorry."
"The mouth is complex, as the yeast and sugar interact with one another. A great beer."
"Mouthfeel is fine and its pretty drinkable although its not all its hyped up to be."
"D: The beer is very drinkable, the deceptive abv notwithstanding. The beer combines the enjoyable flavors of a hefe weizen with the strength of a bock, nicely done."
"Really quite a beautiful beer, not my favorite style but definitely must be respected."
"If you like doppelbocks or hearty brews with big chartacter, give Aventinus a try. It's a great beer."
"Drinkability - this is good, but high abv holds down sessionability."
"This is an excellent weizenbock and a perfect example of the style. It's a sheer pleasure to drink, but not a session beer by any means."
"Bravo"
"Notes: A golden standard for the Weizenbock, and for quality brewing in general. Probably as close to a perfect beer as can be found on earth."
"This hazy, brown beer poured with one of the liveliest heads I've ever seen (though it then settled down and left only the slightest trace of lacing). A spicy, cinnamon aroma, along with a peculiar sweetness I associate with canned corn dominate the nose and taste. The relatively high alcohol content also contributes to the flavor; I definitely welcomed those esters for adding an additional dimension to the otherwise clobbering maltyness. To that end, I found that a few bites of dark chocolate brought out a crispness that I might have otherwise overlooked. Overall, a bit of a heavier brew than I usually care for, but definitely worth experiencing."
"Drinkability: Great beer, but the higher levels of carbonation, sweetness, and alcohol combine to make this a beer I usually only want one or two of."
"The pour into my Aventinus glass (I love it when I get the chance for this!) raises a head that just won't stay in, forcing me to wait for it to subside. It falls slowly to a thick tan layer that won't depart. The body is a translucent brown/copper. The nose is strong and clovey, with lots of banana bread, along with a lot of sweet berry odor, and alcohol. Taste is sweet, alcoholic, and banana bready. Finishes on a bready note. There is a nice cinnamon, pepper note as well. The mouth is full, with lower carbonation than most wheats. Very nice. Very drinkable"
"This is basically the wheat version of a doppelbock. I really enjoyed this one, it was a real treat. Consider this a great dessert beer. Try this one, you won't regret it."
"Big , bold, cream chewy body that just keeps gettin' better till the end...this is one ale of superb quality. You must try this one for the sake of great beer...and a strong German at that, Cheers!"
"I found this hard work to drink. Nice flavours, but I would like less of the effects like the heat & alcohol elements."
"Wow."
"A brew of extraordinary magnitude!"
"I was a bit surprised, based on my findings, to see Aventinus with a 91 score. I feel it's a good beer, but for some reason, it's just not that good to me. This could be a case of sensory overload, however, as I can tell there's a lot going on in this bock's aroma and tastes, but it's hard to decifer exactly what it is. Upon pouring there was a nice firm tan head, and a murky, turbid, brown body that reminded me of swamp water...unreal. Then poof, the heads gone, not a trace, not even a whisper of head or lace for much of the drink. Aromas were thick with a yeasty, fruity, clovelike smell, that was very hard to decern. The taste also, was very complex wtih fruit and floral flavors and a hint of bitterness upfront and fading alcohol on the back end. Overall, a very fine drink, I would have again, but somehow I just don't understand the super high rating."
"This is a really interesting beer. It reminds me of a cross between a dunkelweizen and a belgian strong dark ale. Very fruity like a belgian and pours a belgian-style head. Not much lacing down the glass, but who cares, the taste is phenomenal. Cherries, plums, and bananas seep through. Heavy alcohol warms in this well balanced brew. This beer attacks your taste buds. An outstanding beer, without a doubt."
"The drink ability it great, this is a top world class beer, Nothing bad and almost everything over and above, Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Mouthfeel is very substantial."
"I will have to try some others from the same style to really compare this ale."
"Aventinus! Poured a dark ""cow brown"" color with a beatiful two-fingered head which settled down rather quickly to a thin head that lingered around for the remainder of the glass. Beautiful looking beer which has good lacing while drinking but nothing that sticks to the glass. Smells of bready, yeasty, bananas, clove, coriander. The taste is just...WOW. Coming through the palate is Yeast, breadiness, coriander, honeydew, some cherries, a little anise, bananas, and an unbelievable clove finish with some alcohol warmth. Extremely complex brew here and ridiculously YUMMY. One of the better tasting beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, velvety, and moderate-high carbonation. I could drink these everyday to start off a session. Absolutely amazing beer. A true masterpiece of the style. Hats off."
"Overall, great quality. This would be a very nice strong beer to pair with a nice german meal of wursts and sauerkraut. If you like the style of beer this is a definte must try."
"Overall, the best (or very close to the best) weizen I have ever had. It has lots of complexity (which most weizens I've had lacked severely). The carbonation is very smooth and refreshing, and the alcohol is deviously hidden. A MUST have (repeatedly) weizenbock!"
"Aventinus pours a caramel brown, darker and murkier toward the top of the glass into an Aventinus glass from a brown .5 liter bottle. It smells like clove, banana, and more clove. Definitely an intese smelling beer. The mouthfeel is thick and full. Loads of banana and clove flavor. Some alcohol warming This really is an excellent beer, it has the flavors of a weiss beer on steroids. Almost the equivalent, perhaps, of what Americans have done to the IPA, pimp it out to the max. Highly recommended."
"Pours a murky brown with carbonation running up the sides of the glass forming a thin ring of bubbles around the liquid's surface. Smells strongly of bananas and light rum booziness with slight chocolate from the dark malts. The best way to describe the flavor of this beer is chocolate drizzled and lightly clove spiced banana bread. Tastes like a pumped up dunkelweizen all around. Just a hint of alcohol. Additional flavors of raisins, dates, and other dried fruits. There is also a very bright tart and sweet combination in the finish that prevents this from becoming to tiring on the palate. Mouthfeel is of sturdy body with pleasant viscosity combined with lively bubbles. With excelent body and flavor makes this a great drinker."
"Cheers!"
"A light mouthfeel with light carbonation, but the aftertaste and harshness makes for a pretty good, but not great drinkability."
"Drinkability: Definitely the standard and the standard-killer for weizenbocks. Simply superb combination of wheat and bock tendencies, resulting in a ridiculously drinkable beer. I enjoyed this bottle as much as I enjoyed my first encounter with this in the Schneiderbrau restaurant in Munich."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol isn't noticeable in the taste, but you feel its warmth once it's gone. dry and easy to drink."
"This may be a bit TOO drinkable at 8% alcohol; it could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. I will definitely have this one again. Very well done."
"Overall, a beer I could drink all night long. This one will do your stomach right, I think. At $3.59 for 500ml (~17oz), it will do your wallet right as well. This is a winner, simply an astounding presentation of the style. This makes two excellent beers by Schneider & Sohn, and I expect the weissen-eisbocks I have downstairs will be a third. Get this stuff."
"I could drink 2 or 3 of these at a sitting."
"Drinkabilty? For 8% its off the charts, but I like savoring a bottle, personally. Great beer, one of my favorites for sure. It will eternally astound me that these German beers have just 4 ingredients in them. Stellar."
"Overall, quite drinkable but the ABV tends to limit my intake. Very unique and well worth trying. I'm looking forward to my next one."
"This is a beer that I will continue to come back to time and again."
"A unique brew which stands in a class by itself and is sets the standard for a weizenbock. A must try and highly recommended."
"Poured a dark mahgany/brown. The head formed quickly to a creamy white inch. Aromas from this unique brew are yeasty , ripe darker fruit , not quite ripe banana , and some nice mellow caramel. The taste is very complex and good. It starts off with the dark fruit flavors like raisin and plum , rich malt throughout , some tart wheat, well hidden alchohol, and a slightly spicy finish with a bit of clove and hint of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is fairly effervecent. This weizenbock is an exellent and different beer. Tastes good!"
"I can't really imagine tiring of this one too quickly, although that abv is liable to creep up on you."
"What an interesting beer. It's a deep brown/amber color, with maybe the slightest hint of red. Head is small and dissapears. You can smell the alcohol, as well as wheatiness and sour cherries. The taste is a great balance of yeasty wheat and malts, with a mild alcohol finish. The alcohol becomes more pronounced upon warming. Mouthfeel is excellent, it goes down great and has quite a bit of carbonation."
" This would be great for the summer, since it's easy on the flavors, but has a nice warming aspect to it that makes it great for cold-weather enjoyment as well. Certainly worth a shot - just don't drive home after having one of these!"
"Wondeful example of the style, and definitely a world class brew."
"a world classic for sure - industry benchmark"
"I like this beer. It has a wonderful flavor that is unmatched by any other beer I've ever had. It's easy to drink. Frankly, it could be unnoticed unless you take time to realize that it is unique and special. It is that subtle. Try this one without prejudice and enjoy."
"Drinkability- whoops is it gone, well back to the fridge"
"D - Excellent again. Very nice beer that has earned its high praise."
"Someone needs to tame this head, it was on a rampage! 3 fingers worth topped sexy coffee-n-cola body. Nose is sweet like cotton candy, somewhat fruity, bringing to mind citrusy fruits. Upon sipping I can taste apricots, cotton candy, spices. Yum. Mouth is silky smooth. Certainly a fantastic example of the style. A must buy if you crave this style."
"A good beer overall but it fell short of my expectations."
"This beer pours dark brown with a hint of the wheat color shining through at the edges. Pours a solid head. The smell reminds me of a golden field of wheat that got busy with some nice heady malt. It has a very complex taste, the dark malt dances on a beautiful moonlit night with spice of the wheat and the yeast. It is a marriage made by the beer angels."
"Pours chocolately-brown and cloudy--looks just like a dark, unflitered wheat beer. Respectable head that settles down to a thick, bubbly layer over my beer. It smells rich and creamy, and the smell displays more of the German wheat beer characteristics than the taste actually does. Smells distinctly of bananas and cloves. The taste is mild and somewhat constricted, but really very good and it tastes like a classic, which I suppose it is. Definitely a good beer to watch out for and to try, at least once, on a warm summer night on the patio of your favorite beer bar."
"D: Quite enjoyable. A terrific beer for all seasons and one that will go near the top of my personal favorites. Understandable why this is such a highly rated beer."
"Incredibly high carbonation defines the mouthfeel. A perfect strong summer beer."
"D - Superb beer. Easy to see why it's so highly regarded. Even at 8% it is supremely drinkable."
"D: Doesn't feel/taste anywhere near 8% (more like 5-6%). Easy to drink, but not particularly refreshing. One will do me fine before I move onto something else, but more of a style issue than the fault of this beer."
"Pours a very murky/cloudy bronze color with a white head that doesnt last long with little to no lacing. The smell is what hit me right from the bat. A bouquet of fruit, raisins, cloves, wheat, a hint of bubblegum and a little bit of alcohol very impressive. The bubblegum flavor is present, not quite a hefe weissen taste, its labeled as a Wheat DoppleBock and thats really what it tastes like a wheat beer crossed with a dopplebock. All in all an enjoyable beer, not something Ill probably pick up all that often, but definitely something Ill pick up as a switchup now and again."
"Dark brown slight haze good two finger head that hangs around. Smells of wheaty booze with some toasty parts to it, the hops aren't realy prevelant to me. Slight clove flavors go with the wheat sweetness that is held back with the alcohol and natrual roasted bitterness. Good body a little thinner than I would have liked it to be at room temp, but it seems to have a better body in the 2nd bottle that was closer to 60F. Very drinkable and would pair well with just about any dish I can think of."
"(Bottle purchased at Green's in Atlanta). This pours a mixture of dark brown and amber, with a tan foamy head. Glass gives off a gentle, furity aroma. I enjoyed the spicy taste throughout the glass, and it left a long, good finish. Will definitely be drinking this again."
" All I can say is round , balanced . this beer seemed to be created whole , complex but with everything seamlessly interlocked . You can taste the wheat , and it belongs there. Bitterness ,not harsh .Almost unnoticible , slightly tannic finish . Too tasty .Too drinkable . I can get in trouble with this one . So .."
"Pours a hazy chestnut brown with a 2 finger head, OK longevity and good lace. Soft caramel and dried fruit aroma. Smells ""tart"". Big caramel and brown sugar notes, mixed with dried dark fruits. Sticky and warming. Complex and flavorful. Not super drinkable on its own but would be great with food."
"Overall- Just awesome. As a huge hefe fan I am in heaven."
"Taste is quite sweet, first the hops come in, with their fruity kick such as banana and apples followed by an earthy malty presence which ends with a cereal but shy flavors."
"Not the worst review, but I think with a good specimen bottle of this beer, it would get a better rating. Aventinus is renowned for good reason."
"Despite the touch of bitterness, it is still fairly smooth and drinkable. Its complexities and spices make this a great sipping treat."
"Pours a very cloudy mahogany with the yeast pour. Soapy off-white head fills the glass then settles to three fingers. Good retention and a few sticky spots of lace. Belgian phenols like plastic and banana in the nose, and a plum ester as it warms. Sweet toasted wheat malt flavor with loads of Phenols and raisin-like ester. Weak noble hops in the aftertaste, semi-dry with a hint of cocoa. Medium carbonation and medium full body, lots of texture from wheat and yeast but also crisp. Tart and dry finish with no ester- phenols mellow out- but get in the way of the wheat flavor and seem out of place where you would normally find a residual sweet finish. Interesting, but not what I reach for when I want a wheat doppelbock."
"The only knock I'd have on this beer, if you could even call it that, is that I'm not sure if I'd want to drink more than one bottle in a sitting. One alone works just fine though."
"What a classic, but unusual beer (though I guess the weizenbocks are certainly becoming more common). But like many such beers, you either love or you hate it; I, for one, love it. Complex and deceptively drinkable. Highly recommended."
"I drank this slightly hungry just to make sure I could get it all down, but I ended up still getting quite full from this beer. I'm sure experience BAs could handle it with no problem, but I got quite full and surely felt that 8.2%. It's very deceptive. Make sure you take you time with this one. I imagine this would go well with grilled pork chops."
"I will definitely be revisiting this one in the near future."
"Drinkability: Well, it's a fine beer but not one I want to have every night. The overly extroverted alcohol betrays the other flavors and makes this beer not as drinkable as it could be."
"Still a good experience, but not sure how many more I'll have of this beer."
"Aventinus can stand alone with hard-core craft drinkers, or would make a good cross-over brew for beginners."
"This is a definite world-class beer. My best advice is just to make sure you're drinking the Weizenbock and not the Weizen-Eisbock. The bottles look the same, so ask to look at the bottle before your server pours it!"
"Poured a cloudy, rust-brown color with a bubble-laiden, soft, cream colored head that dissipated quickly and left just a touch of lacing. High level of carbonation with very tiny bubbles gracing the surface; seemed like I was dreaming. An incredible number of aromas seemed to come out including honey, grains, earth, sweet fruit, and alcohol. The taste was dominated by that of dark fruit and wheat. Subtle earth (mud) and smoked flavors added character and depth. The texture was slightly chewy with a medium-finish that seemed to involve figs and dates. The beer starts off smooth and semi-sweet, but finishes bitter. Start to finish this is one of the most incredible and flavorful brews I've ever had."
"Damn that's good beer. Outstanding."
"A more awesome ""dunkel bock"" version of the original Schneider Weisse Hefe, which was very yummy itself."
"This beer poured a very deep amber color with a frothy white head that holds well and laces nicely. The smell is primarily of belgian yeast but also has hints of sweet wine like aromas. The taste is very Belgian like which is probably due to the yeast. The beer is also very sweet with dark fruit taste but maintains its its bock like characteristics. The beer is nicely thick with some decent dryness. Overall, I am a little tired of the Belgian yeast flavor at the moment but this one did not dissapoint too much and is pretty good."
"Very smooth and easy driking for an 8% beer. A benchmark beer for the style. Not necessarily the best (there's a czech brewery that makes a better one IMO) but if you want to know what a Weizen DoppelBock is all about, this is where to start."
"Though the mouthfeel was fizzy and bitter at first, later fading into a smooth sweetness, it was well balanced and very enjoyable. Quite drinkable, but the higher ABV might not allow you to enjoy the complexity after a few glasses. Try it."
"This is a great beer that I can't get enough of. Delightful."
"500 ml bottle received from LuckySevens82 and BIF33 - Team Spring."
"Pours into the tall weizen glass with a monstrous antique head full of tightly packed bubbles. Opaque at the top of the glass and translucent below. Smell is spicy banana, the traditional wheat nose. Taste is a luscious banana bread with a soda like spritz following. Spiciness on the edges that mixes with a reasonable sweetness at the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and full at the start and thins out considerably in the finish probably due to that fine bubble carbonation. Oh so easy to quaff. We grilled some NY strips, medium rare, and this is what we chose to have with it. Superb."
"Uncapped this bottle on a beautiful spring evening. The smell of the beer is a bit slight, but then the head settled nicely with a rich, silky looking foam. This foam added to the texture, which then added to the thickness of the sweet wheat flavour. The flavour is also caramel, and plum like. Slight acidic and dry finish with a hint of alcohol flavour. Very satisfying. This beer is to be sipped and admired"
"Dark brown body with an initially big, fizzy, off-white head. The aroma is banana, wheat and cloves. The flavor is wheat, caramel, toffee, cinnamon and apples. The finish is long, slightly bitter and a bit tart as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with lively carbonation that bites the tongue. Impressive."
"Mmmm boy, that was at tasty one. Very pleased with Aventinus on my vacation in Georgia. Nice copper color which displayed a bit of yeast sediment. Can understand this as a wheat beer with great notes of chocolate and fruit. Very easy to finish. After not drinking for quite a while, I could feel this one, very warm in the stomach."
"A wonderful beer overall. Not quite what I expected. I expected a little more doppelbock but instead was presented with a predominant wheat beer. A nice beer with a medium to heavy body and great carbonation. A real delight."
"overall, a very nice dark wheat, probably my favorite of the style. a must try beer."
"Smells foral, sweet and medicinal with hints of figs and raisins. Heavy dose of cloves and wheat. Lots of alcohol definatly a sipping beer. Taste bites the tongue and warms the inside, a great winter warmer. Definatly a good beer but its drinkability isn't there for me just a little to strong."
"Overall, I'm disappointed in this beer, especially with its high ranking on the ""Best of"" list. It was rather expensive compared to other doppelbocks, but I don't think it was worth the extra $$. I probably won't buy this one again."
"D - I could drink this one all afternoon, but at 8% ABV, my common sense steers me clear. This beer is one of the most defining brands for the style. Superb."
"Overall: I liked this beer a lot. It combined some of the characters that I like in Hefe Weizens with nice rich malt flavors."
"D: Quite good, especially considering the strength!"
"Always a treat. So good you should try not to spoil yourself and have it too often. One bottle is more than enough. Buy a few and save them for special occasions."
"The color of the beer was a very dark brown with a tint of red. There was large amounts of tan head that did not last. The beer smelled of strong yeast and malt. With first taste of this beer, I was suprised by the amount of carbonation. Once I got over the carbination I was able to taste strong malt followed by hints of banana and cloves. There was a large amount of sediment in the bottom of the glass. This was a very smooth beer and once I became used to the carbonation, it was a delight on the palate."
"Turbid prune juice color with a lasting, thick off-white head. Dark, sweet, slightly musty aroma. Sweet, juicy, fruity, malty flavor. Slight alcohol apparent. Clear sugary sweetness from the wheat. Delicious! Medium body, with even, small-bubbled carbonation. Very impressively drinkable for an 8% beer with this much flavor! This beer reminded me of a doppelbock but not quite so rich, but still packed with flavor."
"Beautiful. In my Weizen glass the lower portion of the beer is translucent and an almost bright orange mahogany. The beer in the wider are of the glass looks considerably darker, almost red and deeply brown. The contrast is remarkably striking. The head is huge, tan, and frothy. Aromas are heavy of banana, and cloves. There is also some berry presence as well as chocolate and apple peals. Tastes is jammy and has a sticky caramelness about it. Banana, cloves, chocolate, anise, and dark fruits all enter into play. This is just wonderful, truly wonderful. Drinkability is supreme. Mouthfeel is smooth. Very sessionable even at 8 degrees."
"Very much deserves its reputation."
"Aventinus will always have a reserved slot in my fridge. A world class ale."
"i highly recommend this brew. ."
"Bottle Pours a murky brown with a huge creamy white light brown head, which is mostly lasting with good lacing. Has a complex aroma. At first I get sweet perfume, then you get chocolate malts with plenty of good spices and some bubble gum. Has a smooth palate with easy drinking flavor. Light on carbination and lacks some finish but has a nice duration. Has a medium body. The alcohol is very well hidden. The flavors really come out, even taste some cherry. Very easy drinking, sips extremely well."
"Big ups to xeryuspool for sharing this with me."
"The carbonation creates ""honey combs"" at the top of the brew. Small bubbles around the outside. The beer mellows out to become more drinkable as it warms, but I still found it to be less drinkable than most beers. A llitle too strong on the acidic alcohol taste for me, but still very interesting."
"In short, this IS a beer!... absolutely enjoyable."
"Now this is a beer. Luscious head with attractive lace. Scents are complex: some banana, cherry and sandalwood. Taste is excellent although it reminds me of Coup des Grisou (Geyser?) which I fondly remember from Montreal which means there is a finer beer of this sort out there. Perhaps I am just nostalgic but this doesn't quite live up to a fresh Coup. Still one of the more pleasant surprises from the LCBO. Damn them and their monopoly."
"Poured into a 20-oz. tumbler (closest I've got to proper glassware, unfortunately). Slightly hazy bronze with a massive, silky ecru head; light carbonation rising persistently. Heavy wheat aroma at first; underlying clove scents with faint presence of fruity esters (overripe banana, spiced cider). Sweet banana and clove character immediately come to the fore in the first sip. Malty wheat on the followthrough. Something of a sourish vegetable aftertaste. Mouthcoating elixir, this one is. Full-bodied and slick. Banana burps. Not my favorite style, but this beer is so well-made, I can't help but find it extremely drinkable. Deserving of all accolades it receives."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick, slippery, viscous, and mouth filling... a terrific environment for the feel and tastes of this beer. No problem drinking this one, it's truly outstanding and very easy to find."
"Phenomenal when fresh, equaly good but completely different when aged. Superb!"
"Pours a dark amber color with a thick head, but is more fizzy than creamy as you would expect. Head slowly receded and left only a ring around the glass and no lacing. Much more of a caramel and chocolate aroma, with subdued spices and hints of banana. I find more molasses, chocolate, caramel, bread, with only a little bit of banana. Taste is definately much more mellowed after nearly 6 years, but it is pretty nicely blended. Seems a little light and watery by now with almost no carbonation. Still a good beer but it just seems to be lacking compared to a fresher bottle."
"D: Definitely not a session beer, but it's definitely a must have, and it even comes at a good price. Go get some."
"You just want to deliberately sip this brew over and over again to extract out all the greatness. Precisely what a German bier should be. Makes me want to move back. G schneider und Sohn sollen rightig stolz auf dieses Bier sein."
"Aventinus poured a deep brown color with a large head that never quite went away. I poured the entire contents of the bottle into my glass, including the yeast at the bottom, so it was nice and cloudy. The aroma was heavenly with whiffs of bubblegum, spices and malt in the nose. Taste was equally impressive with notes of clove, spices, chocolate and malt in the palate. This beer was medium to full bodied and had a nice spicy/sweet finish with just a touch of alcoholic warmth. This is really an incredible Weizenbock and one that I will come back to again and again. Recommended."
"Big beer with big taste, aroma and big alcohol kick."
"D - For its style I think it is very drinkable. Nice would be nice on cool summer nights."
"Very nice! This deserves to be rated so highly. I've never had such complex, full tastes from a bock before, which is saying something."
"Very drinkable but tastes are too intnese to make this a session choice. Not a huge weizen guy. I think the bock side of this appeals to me more. This is probably amongst top 3 of the weizenbocks I've tried. I'd love to have this with a rueben sandwich & some pickles or hell even blutwurst, enjoy. I do like everything this brewery puts out that I've tried, despite the fact they are ALL wheat beers."
"Slightly hazy, amber beer with a thick, beige head. Heavy aroma with sweetness, toffee, cloves, dried fruits, a little banana and a hint of alcohol. It is quite fizzy in the mouth, but not as sticky as expected, and flavors of caramell, cloves, hops, alcohol, banana and dried fruits swirls around your mouth along with some yeasty notes, finishing off in a sweet, yet bitter, warming aftertaste that leaves you very satisfied. Full-bodied classic beer, and it was a good choice for this cold, snowy evening. It left me very pleased. (060216)"
"It was a very clear dark amber with fantastic white head. It was fairly well carbonated and looked great in the glass. The smell was very wheaty almost like a hef. It was very cidery in scent with tons of floral notes. The only deduction I had was that an alcohol quality was sensed during wafting. It tastes of malty richness as wheat fills the mouth. It is exceptional for the style but a tinge too sweet for my taste buds. The mouthfeel was creamy and rich but not too thick- fantastic. I found this beer to be very drinkable and I will break another one out during the summer, poolside."
"Deep brown color, but not anything like opaque, with a light tan head. The smell and taste are so much more like a typical hefe-wiezen than I expected. Loads of hefe yeast in the nose, in fact, thats nearly all. Taste is pretty much typical hefe too, bananna and clove plus wheat, but both the smell and taste have a little something extra. I guess it would be a caramelized malt, but it does not have nearly the impact that color would make me guess it would have. The other thing is that the alcohol is extremely well masked. The mouthfeel is pretty light as well. This beer is pretty interesting and really well done."
"Overall, sad to say, I don't think aging is the best thing to do with a bottle of Aventinus. Aging has reduced the complexity of this beer, in aroma, flavor and even mouthfeel, with the only recompense being more candi-sugar-like sweetness. Not a good tradeoff. As an interesting experiment, I recommend trying this (especially alongside a bottle of regular Aventinus), but I, personally, can't imagine drinking this vintage beer without pairing it with very specific food items (the most sugary roasted sweet meats, some desserts). Worth a try but not a revelation by any means."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. Carbonation is low. The beer is a very smooth drinking beer overall. I have had this one alot fresher and I seem to recall it being better fresh. Oh well, I will give this one another drink next week."
"Drinkability is good, but to find another 2000 is most likely impossible."
"drinkability - unlike other 'fruity' beers it had more staying power, it didnt get any worse or more plain as i drank more. quality beer but not as deep as the best ones. it says its 8% but i couldnt tell where the alcohol was, its hidden extremely well and i hardly felt it either."
"bananas and a malty sweetness in the taste. heavy mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. leaves the taste of cloves in the aftertaste, but the finish is fairly empty. second glass tastes better than the first with the sediment adding some complexity. straightforward and drinkable, but nothing stellar."
"B'ham UK"
"D - Another please. I pick up more tomorrow. Absolutely fabulous."
"D: Used a standard weizen glass for pouring this one, which worked out perfectly with its typical weiss head and rich color spectrum. I enjoyed the beer less as it warmed, however, for the deeper aspects of the taste and smell, the appealing parts of the beer to me, began to fade as this happened. That lessens my overall scoring in the smell and taste category, as well as this one. When I first started sampling the beer it was quite good, and remained above average throughout, but the decrease in its otherwise great attributes led me to conclude it as ""above average"" instead of purely excellent. I could, however, drink this relatively often on its positive aspects alone."
"I can't say enough about this beer. I have had many, many great beers since that day in Baltimore nearly five years ago, but I keep coming back to Aventinus, my first love."
"This is an amazing, complex brew. I have not had another brew quite like this. If you haven't had it, you need to get it."
"Drinkability is very good on this tasty treat."
"Supremely drinkable and enjoyable. So many flavors might lead to sensory overlaod, but the beer is well balanced with the fruit and spice and slight chocolate all complimenting each other. Nothing gets in the way of anything else. Smooth and easy to drink, although the alcoholic effects do kick in after consumption, so this is one to limit to one bottle and sip and savor."
"mouthfeel: very smooth and easy drinking for the abv."
"Pours a dark tawny brown, hazy. Aroma is spicy and rich. One of the best smelling beers ever: orange peel, cinnamon, slightly peppary. Quite fizzy with tiny little bubbly head. Flavor leans toward malty with a slight citrus, slight sour edge. Perfect like that. Caramelish malts are evident is balance the sour. Something very very nice, but unexplainable in the finish. Uber satisfying to drink. Very little hop presence. I am a hop head but would not mess with this beer and add more. Top beer."
"Verdict- Sweet, sweet nectar! This is loaded with flavor, but it's not raucous or overbearing. It's complex and mysterious; a wonderful, delicious beer."
"The taste. Jesus, what can I say about the taste? It's got the prominent malty characteristics of a doppelbock. It has the crisp, clean taste of a hefeweizen plus the over-the-top banana and wheat-taste of a dunkel. There's a huge yeast presence in the aftertaste. Vinous and grape flavors are abounding. Seriously? One of the best beers I've ever had. I could drink this for days on end, and never stop, but that would probably destroy my social life and my family and really, who wants to talk about that? Damn, a GREAT BEER!"
"This is my first wheat doppelbock so I do not have a comparison. The presentation, taste and mouthfeel are wonderful. I just don't care for the smell as much."
"Getting back on topic here, the appearance is brownish orange with an off-white head. The aroma is slightly spicy like cloves or cinnamon, but not as pungent as either of those. The taste brings out a bit more fruitiness, much like a wheat beer, and the spice is still evident. Medium bodied and easy on the palate for an 8% ABV beer. I didn't know the ABV until I wrote this review and I would have guessed that this was less than 8%. Drinkability was good, but I was ready to try something else after this beer. Actually, I was ready to put my head down on my pillow and go to sleep after this beer since it was preceded by a DFH World Wide Stout, haha. Aventinus was like a wheat beer with a kick to it, and although wheat beers are not my favorite, this was pretty tasty."
"Footnote: I had a second, much fresher bottle and it did not pour as well as the older one."
"Drinkability -- I find this beer to be quite enjoyable and am looking forward to trying more of this style. It is extremely drinkable, but at $3.19 per 500ml bottle I won't be drinking a lot of it."
"Had a dark brown color with a soft, white head. Mild carbonation with very tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Smell was strongly wheat, with clove, but also had some roasted/toasted aroma. Taste was very interesting - lots going on. For me, the clove-like, wheat flavor dominated initially and was followed by a slight roasted flavor with a strong fruity, sweet and sour finish. A very full-bodied beer that sticks to your tongue. Very flavorful, but hard to have more than one."
"This is a deceptively drinkable beer. The high ABV can creep up on you unawares, as it hides it beautifully. Beautifully balanced, wonderfully enjoyable."
" I will buy this again and recommend to friends."
"A great beer ! And , even though they are very different styles, this tastes very much like Leffe Brune..but dialed up a notch."
"Pours with a noisy, crackling, active head of small and medium sized pale tan bubbles. The head quickly dissipates, leaving a brief collar. There are tons of carbonation streams charging to the top through a beautiful burnt amber, copper-highlighted liquid. Smells fruity and rich with cloves, bananas, and raisins. Distinctly wheat. The first taste is initially bracing with alcohol, but this immediately disappears and the rich malty sweetness with the cloves and bananas appear. There are lingering alcohol notes which are warming. Medium bodied with vibrant carbonation. Slightly slick, but relatively light on the tongue. Absolutely drinkable, perhaps dangerously so. This was fantastic and worth tracking down."
"Pours a translucent brown with a decently thick head. Smells of caramel, figs, almonds, maybe some vanilla. Tastes very strong of dried fruit and caramel. The lack of carbonation really made it have a robitussin-like mouthfeel. Drinkability wasn't so high. Tastes great, but towards the end I was a bit overwhelmed."
"This beer poured with a lot of carbonation, which is good for a wheat beer, but then the monstrous head eventually drops to nothing (which I think is typical for most of the German weiss bier that I'vd had.) The Aventinus has a certain lightly spiced caramel apple fruitiness to it, (which surfaces in the aroma, too) that is rather tasty, and hides the alcohol content of this brew pretty well. I seem to remember the spiciness being more assertive, but perhaps my palate has changed, and not the beer. I found lots of yeast in the bottle and I tried to rouse it so it would fall into my glass to add more flavor. I did appreciate the soft mouthfeel of this beer and it's surprising drinkability, but for all the hype I think it could be a bit more complex. I will drink this beer again, despite my criticism."
"The mouth feel changes with temperature. As it is cold, the carbonation is very light, but it peaks as it warms up to a full mouth of foamy bubbles and dies down again as it approaches room temperature. The fact that I figured this out is a testament to its drinkability."
"Great beer. Only the banana really differentiates this from a BSD to my palate. Morphing dark flavors reminds me of Maudite a bit, but this is heavier and sweeter. Great to have on occasion."
"I was suprised to see how dark the color of this beer is. The smell is also much different than I expected, much more carmel and fruity than I guessed. But the best thing about this beer is the taste. The fruits come through strong, but dissapear a little too quickly. It reminds me a lot of Hoegaarden Forbidden Fruit in that they are infusing many tastes together. It almost creates a wine-like idea. Very Pleased."
"This is an excellent dark wheat beer from germany, mabye as good as it gets. definitely one of the best, i would say top five examples of darker wheat beers in the world. i really love it, and buy it at every opportunity. it has a clovey taste with a subtle maltiness. Overall the beer is amber, but is a true example of the darker wheat beers. it is one of my absolute favorites, so try to buy it as soon as you can. the head on it is perfect and the beer has a great overall body. excellent with sausages or just by itself. this is truly a remarkable beer."
"This brew has a dark reddish brown plum-like color, with a nice head and lots of fizz. The smell is complex and fruity, maybe a hint of raspberry in there. There is a nice acidic, tarty sweet taste followed by a solid bitter finish, with some spiciness at the end. It's full bodied and the high carbonation lifts you right up. For 8% the alcohol is not overpowering. Definitely worth stocking up on this one..."
"Cannot find any sense of the alochol in the flavor. The taste just knocked me off the couch. The wheat provides a nice sweet base but is extremely pronounced by strong banana and cloves. The cloves pick up a bit to a slight hop presence that creates a wonderful balance. Got bits of chocolate, raisins and prunes coming through as well Mouthfeel is light but has a full body that just wraps itself around the inside of my cheeks. So easy to drink either on its own or with dessert."
"A bunch of codes on the back label: 05.179, 1-1, 0357, 2822."
"My only fear is that there won't be any of this left next time i go to buy beer."
"D - Well at the price, 8% abv and .5L bottles, this isn't the ideal session beer. Although any session with this beer would be a wonderful session indeed! It is sweet, but well rounded enough to be an excellent compliment to a meal. I will definitely drink this again. It is my favorite beer to date (I do have a Rochefort 10 in the fridge though). Weizenbocks are probably my favorite style. I wish more breweries would release them."
"D- This is a great wheat beer that has increased its complexity with all the dark malt. It would be nice to taste even more of the dark qualities to compete with the banana flavor and other flavors of lighter German wheat beers."
"I couldn't drink a great deal of this, but I wouldn't turn it down, either."
"This beer was interesting, but not necessarily in a good way. It poured a nice orange color and had a vigorous foamy head. The aroma was very fruity with no hops present. The beer had a sweet maltiness with a pronounced apple flavor. The hops were very subdued and provided barely enough bitterness to balance out the malt. The body and mouthfeel was relatively light considering the alcohol content. The carbonation was very high - almost like that of a witbier. A decent beer, but not outstanding in my opinion."
"Notes: Wouldn't drink this every day as wheat beers are not my favorite style but this is the best wheat beer or bocks I've ever had. Definitely one I will pick up from time to time to enjoy for a change of pace."
"The pour is orange, closing in on lavender. The head seems small for a weizen, although this does have more alcohol then the average hefe, leaving minimal lacing. It's got the phenols and esters as expected- a malty nose with bananas and cloves. The taste has plenty yeast, spice, fruit (in addition to bananas), and roasty wheat malts. The 8% abv is more detectable then you would think, but this is still mighty easy to drink."
"A nice change of pace for this hop-head. This beer poured a nice dark brown, translucent color with a huge head that quickly disappeared to some lacing and covering the surface of the glass. Some citrus smell. Taste began with an astringent taste that dissolved into a citrus flavor. I have had some problems with strong astringent tastes (like Konig Ludwig Hefe Weizen). This beer is so nicely balanced that it just shows you an astringent taste and quickly dissolves to at citrus taste and a rich mouthfeel. I did not get any harsh alcohol taste and noticed the alcohol only in a slightly flushed feeling and a nice buzz. I would have enjoyed a second one and will definitely buy this beer again."
"Overall - An exceptional beer.... in my view the best of it's kind. Extremely recommended...."
"The aroma is sweet grapes, kind of winelike accompanied by dark roasted malt. It really jumps out at you after opening the bottle. The taste is a nicely flavored warming alcohol along with some spicy fruit. It is very well blended between these two flavors. There is also a nice blend with malts and hops. Goes very well with German food. The doublebock style is becoming one of my favorites. Very good beer."
"Drinkability: I found this to be extremely drinkable even though the alcohol levels are clearly detectable. Great brew."
"500 ml bottle. Aventinus pours out a dark amber color with a huge head. Vigorous carbonation. The aroma is wheat, dark malts, chocolate, and flowers. The flavors in this beer are big and complex: yeast, wheat, bananas, sweet 'n' sour sauce, tropical fruit, and chocolate. There are so many delicious flavors in this beer, and they work so well together. The sweet and sour flavor lets you know this is a weizenbock, but I think of this as a great beer that just happens to be a weizenbock. Mouthfeel is creamy. The relatively high carbonation ensures this won't be cloying. A world class beer."
"This is worth a try, if for nothing else, to taste a classic and elegant portrayal of the strong dark wheat style."
"I could drink this beer all day, which at 8% alcohol makes it dangerous. An excellent doppelbock though. Having this, Celebrator, and Paulaner Salvator in my fridge at the same time is making me really appreciate this style!"
"Poured from a pint + 6 oz. bottle with the yeast. A deep mahogany color with a nice tan head that fades but never disappears. Smell is sweet and estery, with a hint of alcohol. The taste is malty and bright. Hints of traditional weizen flavors like clove and yeast, with a strong malty undertone. The alcohol flavor is not nearly as strong as I expected, but it's definitely there. Nice fruity flavors and a pleasant carbonation make the beer seem lighter than it is. A nice clean taste and feel in the mouth. Very smooth and drinkable, but it sneaks up on you."
"fantastically drinkable. overall, aventinus marries intensity with grace"
"This was first go with this beer for me but it's a clear winner; a complex, well sculpted beer that reminds me of a Belgian in its artistic interpretation of a style. Go get one and drink it."
"I highly recommend this delicious wheat dobblebock!"
" drinkability: high. yeah i wouldn't as to me this is just a doubledunklewiezen. which is cool but a regular dunkles are a damn underrated style."
"Nice."
"Aventinus is one of those beers I have always consumed and almost take for granted. Recently I ordered a batch from my local store though--it had been a while and I felt like rediscovering it. In its absence I found a new appreciation for this phenomenal beer. Just seeing the attractive purple-labelled bottle is enough to make me salivate. I want it at my local store for good, because this is truly a world class German beer. It always pours into my weizen glass nicely, if done slowly and carefully. The head can be as enormous as you see fit. Ultra-creamy, off-white bubbles form and give off the wonderful aroma very intensely after pouring. Sheets of lace cover the sides, sticking tenaciously, or sometimes running down the glass. The beer is full of colour: purples and burgundy, caramel or murky brown, ruby, maple and amber. Always impermeable too: the beer looks thick and hazy. The beer's appearance literally induces drinking. The first big, chunky aroma from this beast is the banana. Fresh, strong, almost rotten banana smells. Dried banana. The intense banana is not artificial smelling at all, as some unfiltered wheat beers smell as though they have had banana extract dumped into them. This is refreshing, natural and extremely appetising. Behind the fruitiness is the strong sweet maltiness with a little of the warming, port-like alcohol. The yeastiness is delicious, reminding me of the very first German hefeweizens I ever tried. Dates, prunes, light licorice, plums, and red wine. The malts add some saltiness, some meatiness. This is one beer very easy to over-sniff: the aroma is massively complex, yet very powerful. Sometimes you can smell it too much and it numbs your nose for a few minutes. The aroma is intense and can be overpowering, but only if you let it. The aroma is like a very good hefeweizen, with the addition of more alcohol and more maltiness, which begs the question: Why are there not more weizenbocks in this world? Again, I could go on and on about the smells in this beer's aroma, but we must move on to the taste. The taste could inevitably be compared to rich red wine. There literally is a very strong red grape taste in the beer. Even the tannic dryness is present. The finish clearly evinces that this is a beer though--strong banana yeastiness, perfumy hops and rich malting. The alcohol does come through quite strongly in the middle, but it is never overpowering--instead it reminds me of the taste one might get from warm brandy. Delectable dark fruits and mouth-filling maltiness. There are enough strong tastes here to deter the second sip of a beer-neophyte, but once this beer hacks its way to your beer-heart, this is at once both one of the most refreshing and complex strong beers you could ingest. Think the revitalising characteristics of a cold hefe with the arcane complexity of an aged barleywine. The carbonation on this beer is medium, the mouthfeel definitely full. A beer equally satisfying on a cold night or a warm one. I have tried Aventinus with a variety of different cheeses, and they all complement it very well. Try aged cheddar or gorgonzola--they were particularly good with this beer. This is one of those beers that truly does make Germany the preeminent beer producer; and it is one of those beers that we should feel privileged to experience every time we take a sip."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Typically not my style of beer BUT, I'm really starting to like Weizenbocks. Super easy to drink, alcohol well hidden. Malty and sweet. Makes me wish I bought more than 1 bottle. I great change of pace for me. Definately seek this one, perfect for a cool autumn evening. Compare with Victory Moonglow."
"A beer I could drink a few of, but not worthy of the price. Not a bad 1 but nothing special here either!!!"
"One truly great brew."
"This is the first beer I'm re-reviewing in a different serving type. Why? Cause it's freakin' great. Poured into my big ole' weizen glass, the head took up half the height at first. The bubbles swirled around like living organisms until they settled into sweet beer. Once I tasted this, the malts and banana flavors were brilliant--sweet, rich, beautiful...poifect. This is unique. I don't know of any other beers that taste like this...or look like it. It's dark purple, dear heavens. You have to try this just to say you did, or because it's one of the best brews out there. Great. Bold. Innovative. Try it, my friend."
"Last time I had this was I was sipping it in the Weisses Brauhaus am Tal in Munich. This time from the bottle. Pours a cloudy(yeast) orange-tinted brown with about an inch head that dissipates quickly to a standard collar. Smell is rich and full of banana bread, clove and loads of yeast spice--malty and sweet. Taste upfront is deep caramelized banana wheatiness. The hefe characteristic is magnified to epic proportions. Very round flavor. Then there's a slow progression into a warming clove finish. Hops are nominally present for bittering only. Delicious. Delicious banana burps. Mouthfeel is low medium but the carbonation is strong, working to create a very creamy mouthfeel, not unlike some belgian strong ales. Utterly drinkable at 8%, but one is more than enough for my tastes. I still prefer standards doppels."
"Pours to a white head and cloudy amber color. Aroma is strong in esters, especially apple, banana and clove. Maltiness is also evident in the nose. Flavor is a very rich blend of sharp wheat flavors blended with fruity and spicy flavors contributed by the yeast. Alcohol wafts into the nasal passage as it dries out upon swallowing. Some spicy hop notes are noticable. This weizenbock is balanced, flavorful, potent and technically flawless."
"It's always a good way to end a day... to dive into this one. A look that is prototypical of a dark wheat (dark mohogany and clearly hazy!?), but after that, it's nearly perfect. Aromas are that of a light barleywine with bubblegum (juicy fruit) and esters (banannas and cloves). The flavors are intensely similar. Bigger and bolder sweetness than expected in wheat beers but complex and bold nonetheless. More akin to and Urbock. So is the body, texture, and mouthfeel. Wheat-like malty/bready flavors show nicely from nose to finish. Sweet and malty in the finish and with a fruity, warming aftertaste. One of the best beers out there."
"I paid $4.50 for this 500ml I believe, and will certainly grab it again the next time I see it."
"Handle with care (8 % ABV !!) ..."
"D: If you like a Weizenbock you won't be able to put it down. I bought it out of state 1-2 years ago, and I believe that it gets better with age, but, since you can now get it in NC, I will be cleaning out my stash for things that can't be bought in NC (looking for 120 min. IPA by Dogfish Head)."
"Pours a very hazy brown color with a beautiful creamy and frothy off-white head that retains well. Aroma is very matly with strong, tangy wheat tones, fruity weizen yeast aroma, as well as some notes of chocolate and alcohol. Flavor is intense and beautifully balanced, with notes of tangy wheat, toasted bread, lots of dark fruits in the vein of belgian dark ales (plum, fig, date and raisin), some spice character (corriander and clove), chocolate and some light alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected with a light to medium body and moderate carbonation...creamy and smooth. Extremely delicious and approachable, an excellent beer. Been waiting for this one to show up in NC, and it was worth the wait for sure."
"tastes delicious. a full-body beer, strong and complex but balanced. like many other reviewers of this beer, it's my first weizenbock, but it will not be my last! this is an awesome beer."
"What a beer, what a beer! It's hard to talk about appearance when you're drinking the beer from the bottle in the toilet of a busy library, but mmm. Sniffing the mouth of the bottle I am bombarded by pleasant weizen flavors and that's just foreplay. The real action happens when it put the bottle to my mouth and WOW. So good. This beer is everything a weizen should be and since it's a dunkelweizen, it is a little less oppressively sweet than your standard hefeweizen. If you haven't already drank this beer, GO OUT AND BUY IT, NOW."
"Overall drinkability is decent -- I like this beer just fine, and will buy it again, but it's not one of my favorites, and at nearly five dollars a bottle, these are a bit steep on the price for regular consumption."
"I wish I hadn't had Aventinus as my first Weizenbock, but either way I'm certainly getting some more. Regardless off what kind of beer is your favorite, a bottle of this is cheap enough to try, and even it wasn't, you should at least try this."
"Nice medium creamy mouthfeel with a bit of alchohol warmth. Flavor is clove and prune with a hint of banana and vanilla surrounded by a malty grainy wheat body, a hint of salt on the tip of the tongue.Taste is classic dunkleweissen with a heavy dose of malty bock. Just like you would expect but amazing how smooth they are together. A fair amount of tartness if you let it linger in you mouth a bit. This is an awesome beer with tons of complexity, taste even changes a bit as it warms and as you get into more yeast toward the bottom it becomes more bready. This is my first Wheat Doppelbock but trust me, it won't be my last."
"A very, very good beer."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is a bit sharp upfront, turning more and more creamy and rounded towards the end as the alcoholic texture turns softer in strength and thinner/cleaner on the palate/between the teeth. A remarkable beer it is, much much more flavoursome than its cousin Schneider Weisse Original. I'd go for single bottle each time, as it's very powerful and hard to digest if consumed too much. A beer with characters to savour rather than quaff."
"Other comments: Weissbier was my first love (as far as beer is concerned), so a ""super-weiss"" like this one brings back those good ol' days!"
"Poured into a Aventinus glass, deep dark brown in color, lots of carbonation and a huge tan head which takes awhile to disapate. Tons of lacing left from the middle out to the edge's. I could smell grassy, chocolate, spicy, and fruity scents. Taste's like a hefe-weizen, but with a more doppelbock flavor, very nice. Has a medium body with a slight taste of alcohol, but not that much considering it is a 8% ABV. Very drinkable, it's a keeper."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a huge off white head. The aroma is ocloves, banana, caramel, chocolate. The taste is above reproach. Huge clove and banana flavors with some darker caramel tones lurcking in the background. The mouthfeel is medium think, and juicy. Overall, this is one outstanding brew. Now if I could only find it on tap."
"Aventinus is the name of a Swedish based multi-lingual drug term data base at Gothenburg University (http://www.spraakbanken.gu.se/av/index.html). It's probably a coincidence but this fine beer gives a pleasant alco-kick. More likely, the name is taken from the Roman hillock Mons Aventinus. It was orginally a workers residential area but was quickly gentrified and filled with villas, baths, and temples (the most famous being the one devoted to Diana, the godess of nature).In the middle ages the hill was apppropriated by monastic establishments, and they are still there. Enough of that. It's a beer review. Aventinus the Beer rules the Weizenstarkbiers. The foam, the sweet smell, the distinct taste of wheat and hops. But the guy on the label looks like Martin Luther."
"Poured a dark amber color with a fizzy, light tan head that left spotty lacing on the glass. Sweet caramel malt, spicy clove, and alcohol in the aroma. Initial tart wheat taste, followed by lots of caramel maltiness, and some banana and bubblegum as well."
"This is nice. Poured out to a darker amber orange color that was slightly cloudy. Nice 1 1/2 Inch head and higher carbonation. Aroma was very complex, with some notes of grapes, hops, and a end similar to smoked bacon. Flavor was very solid, with notes of malt, cocoa, and dark fruits. Hid the 8% ABV very well. Medium mouthfeel was not overly heavy, and not to wimpy light. Finished a bit sweet and malty. Very nice. This is a great all round beer. Highly recommended."
"Year-Later edit: an amazingly complex and balanced weizenbock - truly the standard of the style with notes of apple vinegar, sweet maple syrup and white wine. a must try rendition of a unique style."
"I'm not keen on this style yet, I'm having a hard time getting into the wheat feel in general. I will explore, learn and return later."
"Very dark with a carmal color. Somewhat of a thick, bubbly tan brown head. Very fruity, no hop aroma, followed by a clove spice smell. Taste is spicy with a wheat flavor, followed by bannanas and other possible fruits. Moderate fizzy carbonation with a minimial bite going down. The high alcohol was not noticed at all. Very smooth drinkability after the first sip. This is an excellent beer. I will continue to buy this and will drink again and again."
"In all this is a beer that is among the best in my book. Definately in my top ten."
"This is an insanely easy-drinking beer (esp. considering its ABV). I've never had a weizenbock before, and I'm kicking myself for waiting this long to try one. This will be an outstanding beer for the winter months, and it's pretty damn good on a dog day in August."
"Appearance cannot be improved. Deeep rich looking frothy head. It actually spoke to me...I think its alive and it will not die. Smells of some banana and caramel but so enriched that it smells like a poutpouri with some raisin or plum in the background as well....just beautiful all around. I had this with the intention of a pre-nightcapper but I could see this as an after dinner brew to seal the deal. Something strong enough to compete with the dinner yet rich and easy drinking not to bloat or disturb. mouthfeel was awesome creamy, some oils, carbonation makes its point then fades quickly like alot of german brews. If I did believe in a god it would have to be the person that perfected this recipe....Perfection."
"Opinion: This beer is world class, and I don't know how anybody could possibly dispute that fact. I rarely drink wheat beers in general unless they have a ton of funk from the Senne Valley. This is the only other wheat beer that I will drink on a regular basis because of the simple fact that it is incredibly tasty. The fact that it was brewed according to the Reinheitsgebote makes it even more amazing because they were able to get all of these flavors with only four ingredients. Awesome!"
"Overall: A good beer to try once, but it's a little sweet for my taste."
"Slàinte!"
"A pretty solid brew, slightly disappointing"
"For me it is hard to believe that this beer has an eight percent ABV, as it is so easy to sip and enjoy without tasting any alcohol. This is an absolute killer doppelback, and a steal at $3 a bottle!!"
"Pours a beautiful brownish red, slight haze after pouring the rest of the 500ml bottle. Medium head with medium bubbles. Smells of caramel, grain, and a hint of ripe/overripe fruit. Light clove. Taste is similar to the smell. Medium to heavy body that feels velvety to the mouth and tongue. Powerfully rich and deep. A hint of chocolate in the taste. Outstanding. Yeast and caramel in the aftertaste. A wonderful brew for a cool/cold night. Everything is just about perfect down to the chosen serving size."
"Drinkability and Overall: It's an ok brew just not quite my cup of tea. Too sweet, too overpowering, no balance, and definitly no focus. I've not had too many Weizenbocks, but I know enough about them to realise there is much more a Weizenbock can be than this. Not bad."
"Pours a beautiful deep mahogany, clouded by the thick yeast common to Schneider's beers. Huge bubbly head that quickly fizzes away, also common to Schneider's beers. Big, big aroma, with pear, banana, dark wheat bread, even a hint of apple cider. This beer smells so good I almost forgot to drink it. But drink it I must! The flavors of Schneider's Original Weisse are all here: whole wheat, banana bread, lots of yeast.. except they are all magnified threefold. Plenty of the caramelly doppelbock character, and a very smooth mouthfeel. A bit of alcoholic zing is there, but nothing suggesting the 8% abv. Of course, you'll notice the 8% by the time you're finished with the bottle, but what the hey. Aventinus is a world-class, luxurious beer from one of my absolute favorite breweries. If you like Schneider's original, Aventinus will be absolute heaven for you."
"Truly a beer that lives up to its hype. I'm going to be drinking more than a few of these in the future."
"Final Thought: Wow, I had this on-tap at the Weisse Brauhaus in Munich and didn't realize how good it was in bottle form, a world class beer from a favored brewery in the world capital of bocks and weizens!"
"This is a world class beer in my opinion. Very close to flawless!"
"What a great experience. I cannot recommend this highly enough to those who enjoy a change of pace, a taste experience, or are looking for a summer bock-style ale. Definitely try this if you can."
"500 ml bottle. Date coding is too many numbers to figure out. Dunno how I missed rating this one. Have had on draft and in bottles many times since becoming a BA. Had to go out and get this bottle to review."
"pours dark ruby with a gargantuan head. the aromas of banana and clove that I associate with most wheat beers are here, but less dominant, allowing more subtle, richer aromas of fruit cake and a little caramel to come through. pleasant mouthfeel with a refreshing finish. Manages to take the standard weisse beers to another level and add complexity while still keeping it balanced and refreshing"
"D&N: Definitely worth the wait to try this one. This is a beer to sit back with and savor. A heavy, strong, and thoroughly enjoyable beer. Thanks again to BigLove for hooking me up with this brew."
"Drinkability: If you like wheat beer and dopplebock (but especially the rather) this is very great. I will buy this one every chance I get."
"Very nice. Fairly easy to drink for 8% ABV. This went well with grilled salmon but was even better after dinner."
"Overall this is a hell of a beer. It's probably going into my top 10 (No. 3 at the moment!) based on my score. I very highly recommend it, especially for Weizen fans and super-especially for fans of dunkles bier."
"This one was a good find at the beer store. A 3 year old aged Aventinus specially packaged. From the information hanging off the bottle: ""Therefore, in 1999, the Schneider brewery decided to age 240 cases of Aventinus each year in their historical ice cellar in Kelheim with each batch held for a minimum of 3 years."" The result is quite yummy. Pours light brown in color with a haze. Smell is of bananas and yeast. Taste is heavenly. Bananas, lemon juice, minimal cloves. I wish I had a new one to compare against. Perhaps this is worth another trip back to the store! $5.49 for 500ml bottle. If you see it, it is worth it. Label says hints of softer chocolate, clay, and sherry when aged. Excuse me if I didn't pick up on all of these."
"Drinkability: Resonabley priced for such an excellent and common weizenbock."
"Try it on for size. I know I will try it again."
"Drinkability: A good beer, but it did not leave me wanting another. I don't know if my mood is right or what, but I was satisfied with just this one bottle. I may purchase it again."
"Nice complex, though well-structured brew!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Decent body and fairly clean finish has me giving this an above average drinkability despite the ABV. In fact everyone at the table is eyeing my glass and normally I'd split the second half of this bottle amongst them... Not today! This one came up from Louisiana courtesy of Biglove (Thanks!) and I don't have any spares."
"Overall, a must have. This is a very approachable high abv beer for almost anyone."
"500 mL bottle with a batch code on the back - served slightly chilled in a weizen glass. The initial pour leaves 6 inches of head to 3 inches of beer, but looks very nice the other way around. It takes several minutes to fit the whole bottle into the glass. Before the yeast it is brown with a reddish tint and after it is close to maroon and opaque. Lots of phenols. Bananas, cloves, pepper, lemons, chocolate, alcohol, yeast, and sweet sugary notes in the aroma. It has a medium body, a carbonation that is a bit sharp at the beginning, and leaves a warming sensation. Flavors include bananas, cloves, pepper, grass, caramel, bubblegum, chocolate, raisins, plums?, a sugary sweetness, alcohol, and yeast. A good brew, but, and I don't usually say this, it might benefit from less alcohol. Nevertheless, a tasty beer for the price."
"Overall, I knid of went back and forth on this beer. It looked and smelled great, but then I hated the taste. As it warmed, I started to like it more and more, but it's definitely not one of my new favorites."
"A wonderfully crafted beer, I will defiantly be looking for this in the future."
"I really reccommend this beer. Great."
"Great weeizenbock, the standard by which others should be judged. Pours a caramel brown into the glass with about 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, some banana. Taste is exquisite. Caramel, toffee, banana, some nice yeasty spiciness. Mouthfeel is full, rich, creamy. A very drinkable beer for a higher ABV."
"The mouthfeel is perfect. Medium to light bodied and well carbonated without being harsh. If I didn't see the 8% on the bottle, I would have thought this was in the high 5 range, because I could drink this all night."
"Drinkability: Man. If you keep these too cold, you could easily drink 2 or 3 of these monsters and end up on your face. The classic example of the style. Outstanding."
"I had begun to lose faith in the wheatier beers, until this one came along. Finally, a wheat beer with some backbone. Pours a cloudy brown color with shades of amber shining through. The same delicate yeasty bananna flavorings are there, yet there's a nice rich malt presence to back it up. Plenty of complex spices and herbalness too. Very cakelike, sugary, and chocolatey, yet with a nice light mouthfeel and overall light vibe. It must be a challenge to brew a beer that is so light in character yet so complex. Bravo."
"We sampled this prior to the last sports and social club game of the season for volleyball. We enjoyed the brew, and took the field with smiles on our faces. The game was won, and we were propelled into the finals. Many thanks to goodbyeohio for the hook up of the awesome brew"
"I don't know exactly what I expected... I think I presumed it would be darker. It was good, but not as wonderful as I presumed it would be."
"Ive had only a few weizenbocks but this is certainly an expansion of my senses."
"Prosit!"
"Kind of tastes like fruit juice but definitely has the weight and body of fruit juice plus carbonation. Overall, I think my expectations were a little too high for this beer but it's definitely one I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
"I had this in a vertical with a fresh Aventinus and a '99 Aventinus. The fresh one was very clovey and bananany(?) with a nice wheat base and semi-sweet malt flavor. The '99 was much more dark chocolatey and vicious in mouthfeel with a heartier flavor, almost port like. The '01 was inbetween. It still had that spicey hefe flavor but not as intense and it had more port, chocolate notes than the fresh one. Kind of inbetween and a little muddled. I think aged Aventinus is prime after 6 years! This was still an awesome beer but not quite as good as either the fresh one or the '99. Fun experiment though!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a 16.9 ounce brown glass bottle with a pop top crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"From bottle. Oh my! Loved this right from the first sniff. Pours translucent goldy brown with big foamy light tan head and plenty of fine effervescence. Big estery aroma with sweet caramel, banana and clove tones. Aroma is true to the taste, and it is so smooth that the reasonably high alcohol is barely noticeable. YUM!! Bummer..now I have to go back and down-rate my old favourite (Weinstephan Hefeweissbeir)."
"Comments - Despite the appearance, this is a very good beer. It is sort of odd as well, because it has some characteristics commonly found in ales (fruitiness, gritiness). Overall, I'd say this is a complex beer. Despite my score, I'd recommend it to almost anyone."
"No dating that I can understand.... what is stamped on it is 04.163, 0386, 1-3, and 2822"" hazy and unclear dark chestnut with just a bit of a pale copper ring of tiny bubbles and a few dibs and dabs of islands here and there. Nice strong scents, banana and cloves, wonderfully spicey! Sasafrass, fresh ginger even maybe? Good amount of carbonation, you can really feel it as it foams up a bit and expands in your mouth. Interesting flavors, not too strong, yet in no way is it mild.... Nice and malty, just slightly dark. There is a hit of sasafrass and a lot of nice clove in the finish, even a bit of a clove tingle on the tongue -I like that and have always loved the taste of clove. Goes down nicely, with a lot to think about and enjoy in this one. Not too heavy, but may be best as a sipper or with a good cheese plate."
"I'm glad I tried this, but I doubt I'll have it again. One never knows, do one? Just the thought of the sweetness makes me cringe."
"Debating on getting this again. But without a doubt the Eisbock will be a repeat."
"Pours a cloudy brown with orange highlights. Frothy cream-coloured head with good retention. Strong banana aroma in the nose, with a little hint of clove. Wheat malt tang with some almost bubble gum-like sweetness followed by lots of banana esters and some cloves. Very very slight alcohol warmth in the lingering aftertaste, but very minimal. Nice heavy and smooth mouthfeel. Quite a tasty beer and exceedingly drinkable. I could drink these all night. I think this might have been the first 5 I gave out."
"Medium/full body and exceptionally smooth. Very enjoyable brew."
"this would be a great beer on a chilly night sitting in front of fire."
"This beer pours a cloudy caramel amber color with a lasting, lacing white head. The aroma is a unique blend of spicey lager yeast, fruity ale yeast, and estery hefe yeast. Behind all that is a thick sweet raisin/caramel malt aroma that lingers. The malt sweetness dominates the flavor, drifting between raisin caramel malt and sweet wheat malt before giving way to a yeast finish. The beer is viscuous on the tongue and finishes warmly. This beer definitely takes the winter chill away, and likely the winter blues, as well."
"Murky brown with a 1/2 inch white head that rises for a bit and lingers throughout the experience. Nose is of spices and a tinge of fruit. I believe I detect a trace of nutmeg and cinnamon in the nose. Roasted malts give it a deep flavor reminiscent of toffee and light chocolate. Taste is fruity at first, with red apple, plum, and bananna being prevalent. Spices are more evident near the middle of the glass, again with the nutmeg and cinnamon - just a smidgen, mind you. Cloves also. Not enough to overpower - just perfect. There is a caramel/toffee sweetness to this ale. A perfect balance of strength and wheat. Mouthfeel is spicy and carbonated. A perfectly drinkable ale, especially on a cold, rainy winter's day."
"Just compared to Ramstein Winter Wheat. Ramstein blows this formidable foe away especially with less awl-kee-hawl detection. 358/4.29"
"Alright...it doesn't get much better than this folks. The perfect marriage of wheat ale & dopplebock - shear perfection. I would love to try this with some bread pudding!"
"A one-two punch of sweet and sour. Somewhat simplistic. Lacking in depth and disappointing overall."
"This was a disapointment. It pours reddish orange with a eggshell head. Some lacing. The malts were just too cloying. This offset a little bit by cloves, but not enough. It did serve as a deecent winter warmer, but the sweetness really cut down on drinkability. I can see the love for this beer, but I just wasn't feeling it."
"An awesome beer, no question about it. I wish I had more in my fridge. Weizenbocks are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles of beers. It's clear that the Schneider Aventinus is one of the best out there. Highly recommended."
"An exceptionally drinkable beer. Its easy to suck this one right down and let that 8% abv get right on top of you. An excellent choice for an after dinner beer."
"Watch out tho. This beer goes down amazingly easy for an 8%"
"poured a hazy brown, thick rich head that retained and left puffy lacing all the way through, smell was, vanilla, slight clove, bread, taste is of clove spice, complex, and delicious! mouthfeel is rich smooth and creamy!, drinkability is excellent, great beer! one of the best, in my opinion! cheers!, MUST TRY!"
"All in all a drinkable dopplebock, but it is just not my style. This is a well crafted brew so I have to give it props."
"Notes: This isn't my favorite style but this is such a well done beer. I really enjoyed this one and although it won't be in my regular rotation, it's a nice change of pace. Highly recommended."
"Overall: This is one of my favorites of all. It is best as an end of the night, it's time to have one last beer and go to bed."
"Definitely not a session beer, but a pint or two will be very drinkable and enjoyable... all said, a very unique beer, and well worth trying."
"Pours with a big head that subside rather quickly. Aroma is very intense and fresh.On initial taste it seems a bit thin but quickly releases nice clove flavor. Very warming but refreshingly so. Not much aftertaste lingering but one can feel the alcohol well after swallowing. This beer kind of resembles some of the Belgium characteristics. I enjoyed this but feel like it needed more body and staying power."
"Poured dark brown with a short lived off white head. Nutty malt aroma with spices. Medium to thin mouthful. Wheat is definitely present in the taste, along with some chocolate/coffee notes and some clove like spices. A little too yeasty. I'm not sure what it was, but there was something a bit harsh here, yet unremarkable. Not a bad beer, I guess I was just expecting more."
"tastes strongly of cloves and sugar which give a sense of mystery and strength to this beer, although at 8% it is insanely drinkable and way too thirst quenching. despite the significant lack of aftertaste, this beer is very complex and waddles through the dark fruit taste profile reminding me of some of my favorites"
"I really like this beer and even bought the funky glass that it is served in so I could be as authentic as possible. Half-time has the Eisbock Glass which is a sawed off version of the regular glass."
"Aventinus Weizen is a beer the I loved from the moment I had it first time back in the german time. Still love it and everytime that I can get a hold of it fresh, I'll buy and soon drink. Aventinus pours in fine and has a nice brown color. It's nose is very weizen like although the bananna is not the only thing you smell. Great sourness of the wheat and fullmalty make it a joy to get your nose near the surface of the beer. Taste is strong, full malty, litle sour and ending just like it was the whole time, dry and litle bitter. Great brew!"
"Pours a pleasant hazy chocolate brown color, with a head that foams up to a small off-white bubbly layer then quickly dies down to the tiniest ring of bubbles around the outside of the glass. The nose is a musty yeastiness that reminds me of the nose of a belgiun dark ale. Taste is very tart and fruity, cloves and more yeast present. Mouthfeel is moderate with a perfect amount of carbonation."
"the taste is what i expected of a ""weizenbock," but i still needed to try it for myself. delicious chocolatey-clove, bready-banana and a little touch of alcohol spice. this stuff is great. maybe it will be my next cloning project"
"Still, these beers make as good a case as any for aging, and I'm going to buy some more and age it for even a couple more years..."
"This brew combines the best characteristics of my two favorite German beer styles -- Weizen and Doppelbock. Poured a clear crisp dark brown with an adequate head in my Weizenglas. Detected more of the Doppelbock caramel/raisin smell than the esters that are usually experienced with a Weizen. The opposite was true of the taste, which exhibited more of a traditional Weizen creaminess. In short, this beer is the best of both worlds. It somehow brings out the best of both styles without compromising either. Highly recommended."
"This was on tap at Ciceros and poured deep brown with garnet highlights into a shaker pint glass. Very thick dense, cream colored head. Bright fruit malt aroma. More of the same in the flavor. Light lace, slightly cloudy. Subtle caramel and figs come through late in the flavor profile. Rich mouth feel. To me this beer defines this style. Rich and sweet, its even better on tap than it is from a bottle. The malty sweetness overcomes the roaster flavor you see in many Weizenbocks. What a terrific beer."
"A very well crafted beer, I liked it .But i doubt i could manage more than one 500ml in a sitting. Yet I will certainlly pick it up again."
"Appearance started off outstanding and finished below average. Extreme carbonation with a soapy like head that fizzed alot.Dark red color with bubbling carbonation.Strong ABV noticed with every sip. Watery and could use more body.No traces of lace left at all.Had a huge head even with a slow pour that lasted for a few minutes.Sweet malt taste with hints of raisins and molasses. I expected more."
"The Doppelbock name on the label had me from the start."
"tough to add much to 357 reviews, but here goes, bottle says brewed in 1999, pours a murky, cloudy, brownish, plummy shade of something very Aventinus like. Nose is musty, fruity, vinious and earthy. Bold and unbashful, this is a tasty, strong wheat bock, fruity, notes of ripe plums, malty, slightly astringent on the tongue. One of the all time classics, a must try. fine stuff"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head above the dark brownish-amber brew. Head is relatively resilient, and lacing is minimal, both of which are acceptable to me with an aged product. Aroma is of caramel malts, with light tinges of dark fruits and hops character. Taste is initially of biscuity malt, fading into the minimal fruit and hops notes as hinted in the nose. No hint of relatively high alcohol content here. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and drinkability excellent as well. Worth searching for."
"An enjoyable beer. i am not a big fan of wheat beers, they always have that wet hay/grass aroma, but this was a good beer."
"My God! This beer is nothing short of spectacular. This is not a style I've ever been particularly fond of, but this is one of the greatest beers I've ever had. It's much more estery and aromatic than any other German bock I've ever encountered, It sort of reminds me of a cross between a German doppel bock and a Belgian strong dark ale. It's floral and fruity, but make no mistake this beer has balls the size of haystacks. I doubt that there is a better beer in all of Germany."
"This is the best weizenbock I have had. 2001 is very much worth the price, almost $7 for 500ml bottle. I am planning on buying another."
"Got this in BIF 10. It is wonderful. Beautiful garnet/deep red color. Pours with a huge head, but it doesn't stick around. I wouldn't expect it to, given the ABV. Smells vinous. Raisiny, black curranty... You can taste the alchol in this, but it's not out in front screaming. It's there, but as a supporting cast. Tastes kinda like a barleywine soaked raisin. A very, very nice, well done beer. It's surpisingly light on the tounge."
"Drinkable??? As Stone Cold once said...""OH, HELL YEAH!!!!"""
"Pours with an orange reddish color and a light head around the rim of the glass. The aroma is malty sweet with some fruity notes. The flavor is brimming with malt character but not in an over-done way. Pale malt seems to dominate the delicate flavor along with light flavors of apple, grapefruit, and crisp grass. There is also a slight wood flavor in the beer. Very clean beer with a smooth carressing of the palate."
"This is probably my favorite beer, one that I rely on as a solid, full bodied, supremely crafted, always enjoyable, brew. Very highly recommended to all."
"This beer pours a brown color with a tall off-white head that stays around for a while and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a fruity sweetness and a little alcohol. The flavor is quite malty and sweet with the alcohol being evident as well. Thick mouthfeel."
"Murky brown looking brew with a big tannish head full of big and little bubbles collapsing on themselves as they fall to tiny ring of bubbles. Its cool you can hear them bursting on there way down fizzy sounding, but not fizzy tasting. Aroma of ripe fruits dipped in caramel and molasess dominate with smells of light spice and toasted malt also but in backgroud. Taste is sweet fruit to start aided by some caronation. Then the toasted malt makes a brief apperance followed by light bitterness and spiceness that begins after your swallow is resting safely in your tummy. Mouthfeel is right side of medium its chewy and full tasting, but not a heavy beer goes down easy and smooth finished before done typing. Drinkability is good goes down easy bottle say 8% that doesn't seem possible no alcohol in taste at all. My first Weizenbock on reccomendation from merlin48 this is a good beer must try more."
"Consumed in October 2004 at the Toronado on tap. Let me start by saying that I have had this beer many a time, but am just getting around to rating it. This is, without a doubt, my favorite current beer. It pours with a huge head and leaves a nice lace while drinking it in my awesome Aventinus glass. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 on appearance is that I compare everything against beers like Westy or Rochefort or the like. The bubbles seemed to be a little large and the lacing wasn't top notch as some beers I have had. The scent is heavenly. Smells of so many different things. Cloves, spices, anise, chocolate, bananas, toffee, port like wine. So many different scents to amaze your nose. Taste is just as good. Mostly I taste the cloves, spices and bananas. Perfect carbonation for this style beer which makes it very smooth going down. The high alcohol content is the only reason it doesn't get a 5 on drinkability. Two of these is plenty for me before it ends being as enjoyable. A really good afterdinner drink if you don't wan't something super sweet like a port, barleywine or eisbock. Can't say enough good things about this beer. Even the price is good. About $3.29 at my local bevmo for a 16.9 oz bottle. I always have at least 4-6 or these on hand at all times. If you see it, you must try it. I deplore you people!!! Buy one...no, buy two because you will be wanting another the minute you finish the first."
"Decidedly drinkable!"
"One of my favorite beers. I would not hesitate recommending it to anyone."
"Pours an orange brown with nice white head. Smell and flavor is tart fruit- apples, cherries and yeast with a hop bitterness enough for balance and a malty sweetness. The beer is medium bodied with a very smooth mouthfeel along with bubbly carbonation and warm alcohol sensation. Very good beer, I prefer this over regular dopplebocks."
"An excellent beer."
"Overall, I don't really care for this brew. Not only is it darn expensive ($4 bucks a bottle, almost the same as a Rogue bomber), but it just doesn't do anything for me. I may try it again in a year or so, once my tastebuds have grown."
"Pours a nice chesnutty copper color with a Volcanous, fizzy light beige head. Aroma is warm and inviting. Clove, roasty wheat, banana and other dark fruit and a little bit acrid or lactic smelling. Estery, spicy attack mixed with some sweet malt and dark fruit notes and finishes off with some alcohol warmth and some winey esters. Very nice weizenbock. Quite possibly the best in the world."
"Doesn't quite live up to it's reputation as far as I'm concerned."
"---Mmmm, it tastes as good as it smells, no, better! Tastes like warm raisen-bread. Nice caramely malts. Sweet with a rather light mouthfeel. This is one tasty beer. I would drink one after Thanksgiving dinner, or anytime for that matter! Can you age this beer?"
"This is my first Weizenbock, having focused on Belgian brews for some time now, I decided to expand to German ales. Poured an evervescent red-brown with a foamy white head that dissipated slowly. Smell was a wine-like plum and banana. Taste... Hey! It's like that one I used to have at Gordon Biersch! Dark fruits, malts, bit of spice and banana, so chocolate creeping in. Has a surprisely light mouthfeel, which was unusual yet appreciated and the high ABV is so well hidden it is quaffable (although you'll want most of it to land in your mouth so it is not a true quaff). This beer is also very refreshing and drinkable, especially on a hot summer night... I like this a lot."
"Pouring this, I was rewarded with an initial 1.75 inch, hi density off-white foamy head and the color of the beer is a burnt caramel. The carbonation is at the initial pour, almost champagne like in intensity, with bubbles ascending from all sectors of the glasses interior. The nose offers copious quantities of clove and fennel which somewhat dissipates revealing the yeast and a hint of dark chocolate. The initial mouth feel is quite creamy, as a portion of the head exists throughout the tasting. The finish is quite crisp, due to the persistent carbonation. For me, the clove-like underpinnings remind me somewhat of a ""seasonal"" holiday flavored brew, and somewhat detract from the overall drinkability of this beer. The combined expansive nature of the style, and the prominent clove / fennel like flavor deeply embedded in this beer is a bit ""over the top"" as I began to get subtle indications that having gone onto a second bottle might have encouraged my gag reflex into operation. It is the nose of this product that has an enormous weight on how this beer will be generally perceived, evaluated and ultimately enjoyed. The taste is moderately potable, but there is no escaping the outgassing of odoriferous emanations. Although interesting to try, it is doubtful that this beer will find a place in my cellar now or in the future."
"NOTE: This beer is MUCH better on tap, absolutely amazing. If I had the energy to write another review, it would be close to a perfect ""5."""
"At 8% abv this guy is highly drinkable. It's not a boring beer in terms of flavor, and could keep me entertained as a session beer. Pretty much the accepted standard for the style, it does not disappoint. A must try!"
"Came in a half liter bottle at 8% ABV. Pours a nice dark red/brown, with lots of head. Has a fruity, malty aroma that I thoroughly enjoyed. The taste is fruity as well, with more maltiness and smooth caramel flavour. A little bit of an alcohol taste but not enough to really hurt it. I really enjoyed this beer, I thought it tasted quite similar to Maudite, so if you like Maudite this one is worth checking out. I was already intoxicated by the time I tried this but my tastebuds never die! Aventinus was after two crappy beers so it tasted leven more excellent."
"is the alcohol is easily detectable."
"Medium body. Sweet malt in the aftertaste, too, but not just this. Even some floral - fruity notes. Ripe banana and apple. Melon?"
"Alcohol was not noticeable at all to me. Thank you CapFlu!"
"I'm really disappointed. Phenol qualities dominated so much that I couldn't pickup enough malt."
"Of all the beers I've had, this one is truly unique. An absolutely intriguing brew."
"Simply one of the best weizenbocks out there, in my opinion: more weizen than bock, in terms of aroma and flavor."
"The slightest discomfort from alcohol on the throat, but overall highly drinkable and enjoyable. Big flavor and low sweetness, I could imagine myself drinking lots of this. Not heavy, despite the thick-looking appearance and medium to high carbonation."
"Comments: Have to be careful when pouring this beer due to its tendency to form a huge head. A very tasty treat. This and the Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock are both well worth seeking out."
"Initial taste produces a chocolate sensation along with fruit and spices. After allowing it to sit in the mouth awhile I was reminded again of red wine with just a hint of cherry. Feels good in the mouth. As the beer warms you get more of the chocolate taste coming out and it kind of weighs on the tongue a bit. All in all, a pretty good beer."
"This brew, while not as exciting to myself as most others, is balanced nicely between the sweetness of the wheat malt and the mellow hops. Comparing it to my memory of the uncellared version, I think this beer has lost it's brightness and life, and certainly it's mouthfeel, head, and lacing have suffered greatly. I give my support to the un-aged version. Still, it's a unique and otherwise very good brew."
"I am giving this beer high scores in all categories because it is truly way up there in the ""all the best I have tried category "". We passed this one around--everyone smelled it and everyone was dying to try it. It is way expensive ! ($4.00 for a little more than a pt. at the liquor store that has pretty good prices). Try it we did and everyone --3 of us were extremely impressed. Not only did we find the perfect mingling of a wheat beer and a dark color to it. It has the elements described on the bottle: molasses. liquorice, nuts, berries--plain and simple this beer is amazing. I usually don't even like a dark beer except Guinness. This one is amazing. I wish everyone could try it right now !!"
"I had this brew paired up with Rouladen, a German steak roll stuffed with pickles, mustard, onion and Blackforest ham in a flavorful gravy over spatzle. Jealous? You should be."
"Even though the bartender did her best on the pour the head on this beer was HUGE. 1/2 foam 1/2 brew. 1/2 off-white, almost beige, 1/2 deep red, a good looking beer sans the head. Smelled heavy spices (cinnamon, choriander) and a small amount of malt. The taste was very unexpected (I've never had a Weizenbock) and delicious. Small hints of orange, vanilla, and cinnamon followed through with a chocolate malt. All the flavors had combined very nicely. The mouthfeel was tangy, smooth and light. I'd love to have this again."
"This beer definitely promotes the phenomona of your eyes (or liver as it were) being bigger than your stomach. From the first sip you want to session this baby, but I wasn't able to to put back a second bottle, as much as I wanted to."
"The beer pours a nice cloudy brown color with a gigantic head that nearly overflows my glass. There's about 3 fingers of head that falls slowly to leave the beer covered with a nice froth. The nose is citrusy lemon with banana more in the background. The flavor is very nice. It is creamy with lemon and banana coming through with the nice wheat sweetness. The banana stays with you after swallowing and sitting for a bit...just great. Very nicely balanced and very good. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy and nice. I could sit down and drink more than a few of these. Exceptional drinkability on this wonderful beer. My last homebrew (unintentionally, but fortunately) turned out similar to this beer."
"A terrific treat of a beer. Pours a dark colour, not really sure what to call it. Not black, not brown, not orange, not red, but similar to all of the above. If you ever put a dark stout up to the light and saw the bit of red that comes through, then you'd recognize it, because it's very close to that aura of colour. Creamy, two finger head. Though their isn't much lace, the glass was recently washed before I poured this beer. So that may affect the lace. Ripe, juicy dark fruit smell, bit of caramel, sweet malts of wheat and barley, and even a slight cheese smell from the yeast. Bit off, yet still pleasant. Tastes damn good. More ripe fruits, with plums and cherries dominant, sweet malt followthrough all up to the aftertaste, which is similar to a dark bread. Creamy, thick mouthfeel coats your teeth, gums, cheeks, tongue and throat. Nice, very nice. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking this again, and again, and again... Though I prefer the Original, this is terrific as well."
"I had this on tap at Cogan's Instant Art Bar in Norfolk, Virginia. This came out a cloudy darker brown color with red highlights and a good-sized light tan head that rose out of the glass. Fantastic aromas rise out of this beer with dark fruits, bready malt and that yeasty wheat smell being at the forefront. There are also slight notes of smoke and chocolate. The taste starts of with slightly sweet fruits and a good amount of carbonation as well. There was a good malt flavor over the middle before a slight bit of hops and wheat come in at the end. This has a full creamy body and good carbonation. Very drinkable as well with 3 or 4 tall glasses easily going down in one sitting. Excellent beer that is highly recommended especially on tap if you can find it."
"I could drink one after another of these, although I'd probably fall off my chair after a while."
"Overall : A completely flawless weizenbock. Highly recommended!"
"This is the first wheat beer I've had that I really enjoyed. It was quite drinkable and refreshing. Thanks to Chatter for finding it for me, I'll look for this one again."
"Drinkability: This is one fine example of the style - touches all the bases"
"Aventinus is a pretty heavy brew. Wheaty, chocolatey, fruity, yeasty - very complex. At 8% though, it'll kind of knock you on your butt. Would be nicer in a 12 oz bottle. A great tasting beer though, fun to try and pick out the various tastes. Kind of overwhelming though."
"Good old Aventinus. Strange beer it is to me. When I first tried it I despised it, but like Orval, I kept coming back to it and now it's at the top of my list. Pours a beautiful mahogany with a big foamy, fizzy head. Smells of chocolate cherrys, and other unidentifiable fruits. Wonderful aromas are coming off of this that I just can't put my finger on. Smooth, smooth, smooth for something of this alcohol content. Instantly refreshing, yet at the same time, rich with flavour. Dark fruits and milk chocolate are all over this. The yeast assaults you with a million unidentifiable fruit flavours. The closest I can come is bananas, red delicious apples and cherries. Finishes with a slight, and I MEAN slight chocolately aftertaste. This is one of God's nectars and if Schneider and Sohn ever decide to stop making it they better start watching their backs! :)"
"Damn!"
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is exceptional. It has a nice fruity wheat scent with the addition of crystal malts for color and maltiness. The taste is good. It has a warm malty flavor with a crisp fruity wheat aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a damn good beer. For such a high abv., it goes down easy and finishes smooth; a fine sessions beer."
"Wow. This beer is amazing. My description will not do it justice. Tastes of dark wheat malt and strong ripe banana. Caramel and cloves. Rich, complex flavors. Fruity. This is sooo smooth. For a 12% ABV brew, it remarkably smooth. Rich malty aftertaste. Soooo drinkable and so tasty. This beer makes me happy."
"Overall: If you like Aventinus, try it aged... You'll absolutely love it. I sure as hell do. Super smooth and well balanced.. What great flavors.."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavy side but well-carbonated and finishes clean with only a faint, gentile aftertaste. Full-bodied and fantastically easy to drink. A great example of both the dopplebock style and what an ideal beer should aspire to be."
"Wyll-"
"Cloudy, dark coppery brown with a dark cream coloured head. High carbonation kept a thin layer of foam on top until the end. Ripe bananas and caramel sweetness are apparent in the aroma, as is some aromatic spiciness. The first impression on taking a sip was surprise at how creamy the texture is. The carbonation mixes very well with the full body to make it seem almost ""chewy"". A slight yeastiness forms a base for the flavour, with fruit, nuts, spice, licorice, and some faint chocolate and bitterness mixed in. Alcohol warmth is noticeable at the finish and provides a slight spiced rum character as well. This is a spectacular beer, and definitely worth a try."
"Very drinkable."
"Dangerously easy drinking."
"The body, dark toned in a brown, slightly translucid dusty pour, considerably carbonated with a thick head, slightly tanned past simply white. The smell gives off wheat and malt all at the same time, with a certain moderation and delicacy. The taste, quite soft but pleasant, follows the Weizen parameters and suggests not too much, but a combination of flavours, and a refreshing brew. nice."
"Drinkability gets a good. I like this beer a lot and could really have this in a lot of situations. The only factor lowering the drinkability here is the alcohol content, I like the warming and slight buzz but this would turn a two beer happy hour to a one beer happy hour. (hey! money saver right?)"
"This is a very nice brew. It would be perfect for the winter months, but I would drink this any time during the year. It is complex enough that everyone has their own interpretation of this brew. Don't just read the reviews, go buy this one and discover what lies inside this ""trip in a bottle."""
"Overall this is very good. My first in this style but this is a great balance between the Weiss and the Bock styles and I would recommend it."
"I could take huge gulps of this one, particularly on a nice pre-summer day like today? What am I doing inside reviewing this beer? I don't know. Call me crazy."
"Notes: Pretty decent example of a dopplebock. Mouthfeel isn't the best, but it still is a good drinking beer."
"Very drinkable, albeit slowly due to the 8% ABV. A 500 ml bottle of this won't disappear in a few minutes time, but will slowly as you linger over the various flavors. Highly recommended. This beer single-handedly destroyed all my preconceived notions of what a German beer tasted like. A definte, ""must try"" beer. In my top ten of all time."
"This is still a very good beer even with my blundering pour. It remains drinkable in the Summer and Fall and Winter. This is a versatile weisse."
"Nice thick, creamy head, the color of the beer is gorgeous! It's at once brown with purple tints, some red and black too. Head lasts a little too little, but it's very large. Smell is awesome too, I get some raisins, banannas, maybe a hint of toffee. Taste-spectacular! Absolutely delicious, almost ""chewy", it tastes so incredibly rich, it's almost sinful. High marks for this beer all around."
"This beer is truely amazing. Watch out when you pour this beer, a monster tan head arises. Use the largest pilsner glass you have available. The smell is a citrus aroma, if you weren't looking at the extreme dark color of this fine beverage you would think this was a plain old hefe. The taste will knock your socks off: citrus, cloves, an explosion all over the lingual taste buds. Thsi is one wonderful spicy concoction, which unfortuantely limits its drinkability. Enjoy one ASAP!"
"Overall: This was a marvelously complex beer, very similar in tone to Wolnzacher Roggenbier. And the fact that the high malt content comes primarily from wheat malt gives this beer an interesting character that few other beers can match. Recommended."
"The alcohol made its presence known as the beer warmed, but in a complementary way. This along with the carbonation induced light mouthfeel leads to great drinkability. But beware, it'll sneak up on you."
"The reddish orange to burnt amber looking body surprised me with its initial clarity and the lack of cloudiness. The second pour however had a large number of floating clumps of the little friends. The initial head was an inch and a half in height with a fizzy carbonation. The head did not last very long at all, and there was no lacing to speak of. The smell was perfumey to medicinal alcohol with underlying banana, clove, and ripe cherries. The taste was initially quite sweet with lots of fruity esters and spices typical for a German wheat beer. The alcohol appears to be very well hidden at first, but as the beer warms up, it starts to step in front of other flavors and introduces a lot of dryness in the mix. Towards the end of the glass, the hops make a surprisingly strong appearance. There is a faint smokiness to the malt that is like a wispy ghost. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I had hoped for, and the yeast adds a mildly unpleasant metallic twang. Very complex beer that starts out easy, and then changes its tune a couple of times as it has your attention."
"overall this is probably the best wheatbeer Ive tried, its also very unique. Cheap at $2.75 cdn a bottle too."
"0 for 2 with Schneider."
"Anyone who loves rich alcohol-laden and flavor packed beers must try an Aventinus. You will not regret it, even if you don't love it as much as I."
"Medium to full body. More carbonated than I thought it would be. A little sweet for my tastes but still a fabulous beer.Good beer"
"Medium bodied and crisp. Good drinkability for the ABV, feel like I could have a couple."
"Pours a nice cloudy copper under a voluminous three finger beige head wiht great retention and firm body. There was some lacing, but should have been more. The nose is a wonderful combination of the strong malt expected of a doppelbock and the yeast and spice of a Hefeweizen. The compliment each other very well. The mouth is very prickly and too light for this style. The taste is ooh so smooth, with lemon and coriander on top of a good barley base. When cold, there is no noticeable caramel, with the sweetness far more citrus than candy. As it warms, though the candy emerges, and takes over, leaving a very sweet aftertaste from the final swallow. There are no discernible hops, and the alcohol is very well hidden. This is a nice enjoyable drink. My wife's comment after a sip: umm, unusual. Yup. Unusually good!"
"Wow this is an interesting beer. The mouthfel is nice and soft, the carbonation is very subdued which seems strange to me given the massive head. Im not sure I would have more than one of these in a sitting due to the alcohol content, but it is a nice change of pace beer."
"As the bar maid was bringing this brew to us, it almost appeared as though it was 1/2 liter of purple liquid with a giant fluffy white head on top. As it got closer, I realized it was merely a deep ruby color, but what a color it was. The locals at the table tried their hand at English with us, giving us the warning that this beer was not for amateurs. Taking a sniff, you could tell this beer was in the 8% range. Pretty alcohol smelling. As I took the first sip, my worries of it tasting like pure alcohol were put to ease. While there was a bit of an alcohol taste, there was plenty of malt here to balance that out. A bit of a clove taste followed it as well. It was a lot crisper than I was expecting. Definitely a refreshing bock to take down mid day."
"The head is big, noisy and collapses unevenly, leaving runny spots of lacing. Its color is a light-gray/tan. The beer is a clear, dark red/brown. The yeast pour adds a slight haze. Spicy! nose. Sweet, with cream. The front is tangy, tangy fruit. Green apples and candy sugar. With temperature that tanginess tames to the point where some banana shows. Sweet fruit in the middle with some cream. The creaminess builds as the beer warms, turning almost milk-chocolatey. Tangy again in the finish; toffee, some bread, lots of spice. Some alcohol in the aftertaste. This beer really needs to warm up to bloom. When cold, the tangy fruit is almost overwhelming. With temperature, the fruit softens considerable and the thick, malty, creamy, chocolatey malt starts to shine through. Stunningly good when warm. It's like a good, fruity, creamy dessert."
"Poured a nice dark amber with an immense white head. This stuff has some pretty intense aroma. Grassy notes flooded my room when i poured this into a glass. Very wheaty smell. Taste is pretty interesting. To me this beer seems to blend the qualities of a nice German wheat and a nice Belgian dark ale. It's bubbly and complex like a Belgian dark, but also very wheaty with hints of banana like a German wheat. Very interesting beer. It's a nice to have a bottle every couple of weeks or so."
"While I felt the Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock was good but perhaps a touch overdone, this beer is simply outstanding."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I would not hesitate to have one in the future. It might be a little bit much for someone to have repeated pints of, however. There's a reason few bars have doppels on tap. This is a good thing. Something 8%abv that goes down this easy should have some sort of arresting effect."
"The taste reveals the wheat and some dark malts. A great sensation on the palate. The beers is nicely fruity and ends on a very pleasing note of nuts. Raspberries. Some caramel too. The hoppy bitterness was almost hidden. A zest of lemon. Very nice mouthfeel. Very smooth. You feel the alcohol after a few sips, but it is well balanced with the powerful flavor. Such a good beer. I could have many of these... Why am I sharing this bottle with my friend who says ""it's ok""???"
"Overall, this is definitely a ""WOW!"" beer! One to savor."
"WoW!! This is bottled ersatz ecstasy ! Back to the LCBO for more, I hope it cellars well."
"I'd heard so much about this beer as a Top 20-ish beer, so I was glad to come across the wrapped bottle in Akron. I'm glad I did too, since this is a fantastic beer. The dark barley malt and wheat malt mix very nicely into a unique experience, and certainly one I'd hope to have again in the future!"
"Bottled: WOW! Came out a little fizzy, but the head died down immediately. The color is a slightly cloudy brown. Malty, wheat and cloves make for a rich taste. Undertones of alcohol, but doesn't overpower the taste. Nose is a bit floral. Also hints of clove. Very full taste. VERY GOOD! This bottle was aged for a year and a half. It was much better than when new!"
"Drink till you can't."
"Overall, this is just a tasty beer, I will definitely return to this from time to time."
"A good first impression, I look forward to many more of these."
"The wheat doppelbock pours a amazing apple cider in appearance and color. All sorts of very fine yeast sediment visible. Impossibly tight carbonation sits as a thin ring around the edges of the beer, only to foam and billow up as I swirl the glass. Low to moderate lacing of the glass. Aromas are all over the place: fruits by the truckload, with ripe banannas and granny smith apples leading the way. A spicy, almost peppery zip as well. I didn't note the chocolate that others have smelled. Flavor is complex. Large dose of grain-like flavor initially, followed by a quick burst of sweetness, then ends with a strange mix of peppery bitterness. Almost an acidic-dry finish. Warming effect from the alcohol becomes more prominent at the very end. Decent body and carbonation. Drinkability is good as well. For as complex a beer at this is, it comes off very well-balanced and flavorful. A keeper!"
"Aventinus is a bit of a letdown. I'm not sure what I expected from a weizenbock, but this wasn't it. It's a little too sour, a little too dry and way too carbonated. I'll probably give it another go sometime, since this may not have been a properly cared for bottle."
"The alcohol was hidden so well this could be lethal for a session. After a 1/2L, I was already struggling. I will definetely get this again."
"This is a very good complex beer that I think has improved greatly with 3 years in a cave. I am going to buy more of these if I see them for sure!"
"I honestly had no foreknowledge or expectations about this strange wheat doppelbock. It just looked good and it was on sale. It has proven to be an indispensable beer drinking experience I could not otherwise imagine was possible."
"Overall, I still prefer the original, non-aged version, in all its wonderful wildness (especially at half the price), but this was still a fantastic beer."
"Some may say I am nuts, but I have noted the smell and taste of bubble gum at times. Bubble gum!!! Is this beer? The answer is no. It's ambrosia."
"Spicy, fruity - notes of figs & raisins, along with a big clove flavour that if overpowering. Medium/full bodied, slick, with robust pinpoint carbonation."
"It starts as simply lovely to look at, then carries through as wonderful to the last drop in the bottle. The full flavor and spicy character give it a big and true identity. As full a beer as it is, though, it ever sacrifices being refreshingly drinkable. Even the relatively high ABV remains well hidden, and doesn't seem to wreak any havoc. It promises big things, them keeps those promises, a trait that makes it something to keep close by, like in your refrigerator, in quantity, so you always know the next one's there and ready for you."
"Deep amber hue, huge rocky, bubbly white head, decent lacing throughout the course of this masterpiece. Fresh fruit, grapes, orange peel, plums, bananas, cloves all grace the nose. Up front, a definitive sweetness, spicy cloves with a gigantic malt back base. The definition of full bodied, toasty and bready flavorings are offered, somewhat acidic, subdued, but revealed alcohol presence. The massively complex flavorings of apple pie, fresh plums, cherries, bananas, hefe-spices, and cloves are all there. Remarkable, world class and superb."
"I really enjoyed this!"
"A unique and wonderful brew that's become one of my all-time favorites."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"I was expecting something nearer a stout. I was pleasantly surprised. I may have to experiment and try it with strong meats to see if that enhances the experience. I was having it with pasta and cheeses and the food seemed to stop the beers tastes."
"Not sure about this one. Smell was that of raisins and prunes but the taste was a bit unbalanced IMO. At times smooth and at other times a bit harsh. Sound weird? Well it was. Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of this beer to begin with. Hard to finish a whole glass for me but I definitely appreciate it. I was expecting more from this 5 year old beer."
"This is my favorite beer, hands down. I read many of the reviews on Aventinus that talk about how great this beer is on tap. I have unfortunately never had this beer on tap but it is hard to imagine it being more exquisite than it is out of the bottle. I first had this beer at the Silver Swan in New York City while eating wild boar and venison. It is a great beer to accompany a heavy meal. It is a great dark weisse and right after you open the bottle you can smell the distant smells of banana and cloves. Once you taste this beer you will be astounded by the flavor. It is 8% alcohol but goes down smooth and if you aren't careful, after a few you will definitely feel it. I recommend Aventinus to anyone and if anyone knows where I can find it on tap in the NY/NJ area, let me know!"
"Huge bubbly head that mounds high above the rim of the class. Nice clear deep brown color until the last pour when the yeast pours and slowly falls to the bottom of the glass. The head eventually recedes to a sparse bubbly lace. Clove and other spices stand out in the aroma, with a hint of plum and chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Medium mouth feel with a high amount of carbonation that gives a fluffiness to the mouth feel. Sweet dark fruity malt up front followed by clove and some yeast notes. A touch of citric hop comes in towards the finish. The alcohol is also a bit noticeable towards the end and ever so slightly warming. The clove flavor lasts into the long aftertaste along with some of the alcohol. Very pleasurable brew to drink again and again, yet not one that Id consider a session brew."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. Definately my favorite Doppelbock to date."
"In brief, liquid bubble gum without the sugar. A substitute for people who drink white sweet wines but do not care for beer taste. tasted like fruit flaroured bubble gum, alcohol well covered. Colour included. Also banana, cloves, nutmeg, some wheat."
"Brown body with orange highlights, topped by a fist-sized beige head of microbubbles, topped by a dollop of whip cream rising above the glass. A punch in the nose of bananas, clove, and bubblegum. Taste starts off very sweet, first with some candy, followed by some dark fruits, and finally a dash of hops in the aftertaste to take the edge off the sweetness. Still a little sweeter than I would ideally prefer. I expected the mouthfeel, while hardly classifiable as thin, to be slighty fuller. This is a wonderful beer. However, I will say that my local Ramstein Winter Wheat is even better. Still, this is a style to be reckoned with, and this is one of the standard bearers."
"-Update: Great from bottles also, but I prefer the tap."
"Imagine Aventinus. Then imagine Aventinus with less sweetness more balance and one of the smoothest taste you will ever experience. I can't say enough about this. Ecstasy is the word. Rivals any beer I have ever had."
"While weizens are not my favorite style I was intrigued by the ""doppelbock"" aspect of this particular brew.Pours a hazy amber brown color with a very nice head that slowly receeded.Little or no lacing left on the glass.Very grassy aroma-spicy,cloves,yeasty.Yeasty comes thru in the flavor-some phenols,sourness.Very pleasant mouthfeel-full bodied and high level of carbonation.Slight ""puckering"" effect which I like.Overall a very nice beer-wouldnt be my first choice but is a great change from the stout,IPA,amber,etc routine that the average beer drinker consumes.I'd have another."
"(This is my desert island beer and has been for awhile, interesting to actually write a review.)"
"The taste was just a bit less appealing than the appearance. I tasted hints of chocolate and spice and was left with an overall sweet taste. The typical grainy, wheat taste was also very noticeable, but not offensive as it has been for me in other weizen beers. Overall, this is the best weizen beer I've ever had and I'll not hesitate to pick up another."
"Overall it was an enjoyable beer that made me sit back and examine what was going on with the beer flavorwise, kinda mysterious - like as in what am I tasting here. Well balanced and fun to drink. I think as many people who drink it will describe it differently. A good beer to compare directly with someone else."
"This beer is the king of dark wheat."
"2000 Vintage, caved aged for 36 months in Aventinus' ice cave in Germany. The appearance is very similar, if not the same as regular Aventinus. A dark, yeasty, murky brown colour with a humungous tan/beige head of foam. If swirled or allowed to garner up a big head, the aromas of this are also very similar to the regular Aventinus. I smell cloves, various fruits and esters, slight spicy alcohol, a bit of malt, and very, very slight floral hops. The aromas are actually a bit more well integrated than the aromas of the regular Aventinus, but at the same time, they are also less pronounces/pungent and complex. The taste is more subdued than that wild-fresh Aventinus, but all of the same major flavor hints are still there. Slight bitter-sweet chocolate, dark fruits, german yeast, malt and hops, alcoholic spiciness, and spicy clove hints. The mouthfeel is a bit creamier and more smooth in the mouth than fresh Aventinus and the drinkability is excellent for an 8.0%ABV wheat beer. Please remember to serve this cool, not cold at cellar temperature, because this is were Aventinus is at it's best. Since these 99 and 2000 reserve bottles have been aged in an ice cave for 36 months, they should be served straight from you ice cave (ie: cellar) or brought up to cellar temp, by sitting in the fridge for 30-40 minutes."
"Pours with a big, fizzy head of large, airy white bubbles that quickly dissipates into nothing at all! (BTW I had not cleaned my tasting glass with detergent, or a towel, so I'm at a loss as to why there's no head... what a downer!) The beer itself is well-carbonated, though, with plenty of streamers rising through a light-chestnut colored brew with highlights that border on amber. Immediately weizeny aroma up front, with the distinctive refreshing, near-citrus tartness; there follows a banana-bread mealiness in the middle; with toffee malt rounding out the back. Flavor is of clove and slight cinnamon; sour-wheaty with suggestions of bubblegum and melon in the midpalate with spicy clove; highlights of raisin and white grapes. And oh yeah, a lot more clove--so much that it almost borders on black pepper. If you don't like clove, then forget it. Mouthfeel is spicily dry, effervescent, champagney with more peppery tingle; yet somehow quenching in the back of the throat. This combination of spiciness and quenching character infers a high drinkability. I could drink this in session if I wasn't feeling the alcohol already... I might try this again to see if the ""appearance"" score goes up a bit, but for now let's just say I didn't get as much out of this beer as I had hoped."
"Overall a superb brew and even smoother and more refined after aging."
"I can see why this is on the Top 50 list; it's got that perfect combination of well-blended, yet complex flavors. Prosit!"
"I couldn't remember the last time I'd had this, but I figured that since I was bottling my own weizenbock today, I should drink this purple beast. Pours a murky dark brown (with a reddish tinge) with a towering tan head. Smell: rich vinuous character with sweet hints of bubblegum, some banana, and hint of alcohol. Taste is tangy champagne banana wheat bread. Acidic, yeasty, sour apples, some clove. Finish is wheat bitter with lingering banana yogurt and alcohol. Delicious. Big and uncompromising, yet utterly drinkable. I can only hope my brew turns out one third as good!"
"Bought a 1pt .9oz bottle for $2.49. Totally worth it for this amazing beer. This is one of my favorite brews of all time. It's not often that I give a 5 for taste but this one deserves every point. Poured a cloudy brown hue. Very nice fizzy head with good lacing. Very spicy smell. Can smell the wheat and malts right away. Tastes amazing. Not sure how anyone can give this less than a 4.5. I gave it a five. Wonderful weizenbock. Yummy malts and fruity spices. 8% is a decent amount of alcohol. Goes very well with almost any meal. Try it out. I'm sure you will enjoy it."
"Reddish dark brown with a gem-like glow, substantially tall evenly bubbled light tan head, frothy topped and whipped with a few divets and little sparkly specks within the foam. Fades slowly to a heavy skim always present but very little lace sticking, most drips back in. Aroma is citrusy and spicy with mild lemon and orange zest mostly coming through, lighter wheat and malty sweetness, musty yeast, and clove spices engaged within. Taste is a total brigade derived from the smell, pretty sharp toned up front with a strong wheaty carbonation that grabs hold right away and sticks with ya the whole ride through. Middle strikes with a yeasty take and citrus zest of lemon and orange, carbonation finally settles out and leaves prickly notions of malted sweetness with some dark fruityness of banana and starfruit tangyness and spice that lingers with a light chewyness that smoothes it out some but that carbonation really stands out and adheres to your mouth. Quite a ride in the feel dept., lots of hold and carbonation that creates lots of those little burps at first but as it warms it mellows and becomes more gratifying. A pretty nice brew, seemingly one dimension in a way, but complex enough to keep interest and finding something new nearly every sip makes for a welcome experience and favorable enjoyment."
" Taste is like a Hefeweizen on steroids, with a maltier presence as it warms. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated but otherwise pretty good. Drinkability is above average. Good beer, but doesn't seem like a doppel. Also very similar to Trois Pistoles."
"Drinkability: This will cause me to give even more wheat beers a try (big revelation for a stout guy). Straight high marks for a very balanced and enjoyable presentation."
"Warm alcohol back is secondary but noticable."
"Enjoyed in the festive enviroment of the Schneider Weiss tap house in Munich. Color was essentially that of any dunkel weiss, possibily with a slighter deeper brown color and more predominant orange hues. The head of the brew was extremely thick and long lasting. I bet I coudve floated a penny on the top of it (note-did not try). Flavor was particularly heavy in the aspects of bananas and even offered some notes of flat n/a apple cider. A very slight taste of alcohol could be tasted. Mouthfeel was extremely luxurious and thick. The strength of the flavors did however slightly detract from drinkability."
"there are others i prefer to be drinking, but id never knock this back. if my tooth was a little sweeter these days i would have rated this much higher. there is no doubt aventinus a beauty even if its not really a style i go in for often."
"This is like a super version of their hefe's. Wild stuff, throughly enjoyed it."
"Probably not the sort of thing I'd drink every day, but definately something which should be tried. Completely unique and enjoyable."
"This must be a rare case finding this stuff on tap - I just started getting Aventinus on tap at Mugs Alehouse in Brooklyn and I've never seen it tapped anywhere else before. I have to admit I prefer it on tap over bottled (though Aventinus Wheat is still one of my favorites in the bottle.) The color (deep brown) and flavor (fruity with a bit of cloves) are still excellent. I think the tap controls the carbonation better, cutting the head down, making it a bit heavier and giving it an even smoother mouthfeel and drinkability than the bottle. Feels a bit more like a 8.0 ABV beer on tap, and it will catch up to you after the second 16oz one, believe me."
"Cloudy deep red to brown color. Very fruity smelling, notes of ripe plum, a bit of banana, and some definite clove in the aroma. Well carbonated, pours with a rousing head. Tastes sharp from the carbonation. There is some definite banana flavor in the finish. This beer is lightly sweet, has a light bit of astringency in the finish. the dark malt adds a richness to this beer, in combination with the yeast, it gives the beer dark fruit type flavors. This is like a richer, more chewy, fruitier older brother of a great Hefe-Weizen. All of the characteristics are here, just more so. My only complaint is that I wish it had finished with a slightly higher final gravity, a little more thickness & sweetness would have been ideal."
"Nice thick foamy head, light tan in color, a little overcarbonated though. There's definitely some alcohol present in the aroma, mixed in with some yeast and banana. The liquid has a creamy brown color to it. The alcohol aroma carrys over into the taste, and ends up as a warm feeling in you belly. The taste is just a little bit sweet, with maybe a little caramelized banana in there. Strong, but smooth beer, maybe more of a fall beer than a summer one."
"Gets better as it warms."
"Prosit!"
"open it up and out poors a deep cloudy monster with a thin white lace. smells of spices and clove with bits of fruit and alcohol present. the taste is spicey with no hop bitterness present. the alcohol taste is present but subdued by the wheat/spice. the mouthfeel is slightly thick yet crisp and finishes a bit dry. this is a pretty big beer and pretty complex and hard to describe for a n00b like myself. but all i know is i like it."
"Pours a solid dark amber with a light head, the essence of any bock. When held up to the light the redness can really be shown, but in a medium lit room it is a very nice, not quite black amber. The most distinguishable characteristic of this beer is banana. It is overall fruity and quite sweet, but the banana overshadows all. Other flavors present are chocolate, cola nut, and apple. there is not initial hit to the pallete, rather the malt steadily accumulates, first with banana flavor, then trailing with the others. As it warms up the flavor changes noticably, becoming even sweeter and more balanced amongst the flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit more carbnated than most other dopplebocks, and I like it. Perhaps I'm partial to my celebrator, but this beer makes a great substitute for dopplebock when you need some variety."
"Quite solid overall. Not something I could see drinking a ton of at a sitting, but delightful as a one off."
"Saved this one for a while.. Its one of my favourite beers around ( given my handle). Pours a almost cola colour with a nice firm head when poured properly. The nose is full of life with , caramel, bananas, cloves and even a almost light tobacco. The taste is the nose times three.. All of the sences are hit with the fruity, spicy, and almost cola like sensations. The carbonation just lifts these onto the palate and makes the tongue dance with joy.. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation keeps this from being to heavy.. This would be a great beer to through back if not for the fact that 3 or more will leave you hurting due to its ABV, which is not even noticable. An all time favourite. For a great treat drink this with Bananas foster for dessert!!! now if i could keep my wife from drinking half of my Tinus id be a happy boy."
"Deep trouble copper appearance with a nice head that stayed there for a while. Aroma is quite complex, mayble a little bit fruity and even roasty. Alcohol is very discreet. Not my favorite style or indeed a style that I know much about but I wouldn't mind trying this again."
" Notes; This is the first beer (of those I have not had) on the top 50 list that I went out and bought based on BA rank. I now understand exactly how valuable BA is as a resource.... thanks all."
"Pours with a nice head that is a bit craggy for a wheat beer but head stay throughout the drink. Aroma is not too strong, with a bit of clove to suppliment the general wheat beer breadish aroma. There is a fair amount of body and which I think comes from the wheat side of the brew but the finish owes more to the bock side. This is a fairly strong brew but the combination of characteristics diguises the alcohol and you would be tempted to make this a session brew which would be a mistake"
"I made a good choice of beer for my first review."
"I've never had a wheat doppelbock before tonight. I was always told that this was a beer to check out and now I understand why. I was never a big fan of wheat beers in general, just a little too sour for my tastes really. But a wheat bock? This beer smells like a wheat beer. But the taste is exactly half sour wheat-ness half malty bock-ness. An excellent balance with lots of flavor. Might be my new favorite beer."
"I don't think it gets any more dangerous for the average beer drinker than this. A perfectly constructed weizen that is highly drinkable and an 8% abv. Awesome to look at in an Aventinus glass. While this is not my favorite style, my wife loves it now and I will be on the hunt for more."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have one of these again. Thankfully I can find it. However, due to the serving size and richness, this would probably be the only bottle I'd be consuming that night."
"i highly highly recommend trying this. it goes a step beyond the doppelbocks."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a weizen glass. It pours a dark muddy brown, almost like chocolate milk, with 4 huge fingers of head. There is almost no lacing left on the glass, despite the huge head. The smell is super malty and yeasty, and very full of clove spice. It smells like a dunkelweizen on steriods. The taste is also packed with malt and cloves, and also contains some fruity esters. There is a bit of yeast to the finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and super smooth. The drinkability is also fairly good for being 8.0%. My first taste of this style, and I'm already wondering how anything could come close to this."
"Time to drink a good beer for a change. Pours a dark murky brown with swirling yeasts and enormous thick tan head that I could barely contain in the glass. Be sure to swirl the yeast at the bottom of the bottle--it's imperative. Smells of bread with Nutella; with hints of chocolate and vanilla and some spices, clove, sweet. Rich tastes of dough up front with sweet dark fruits in the middle smoothed by a banana flavor from the yeast and some cloves and a warming alcohol sensation on the finish. This beer is 8% abv?! Wouldn't know it until the end. This is an amazing, complex, drinkable and flavorful beer."
"Big beautiful head dissipated at a moderate pace. Dark red color with a lot of big bubbles of CO2. Aroma is very fine with a slight estery character that is very spicy and clovelike. Taste is a balance of sweet and dry malt flavors starting with a dark brown sugar flavor and a dry balance. There is a definite carbonic bite in this one that somewhat detracts from the flavor. Very smooth clean finish with a hint of alcohol and a lot of clove and spicey esters. Mouthfeel is light despite the high alcohol. Drinkable as long as it is paired with the right foods or the right moods. An excellent brew to enjoy on a cold winters evening with some good cigars."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable save for the ABV %. I could keep on drinking this but I'd be whacked in short order. That said, this is an excellently crafted beer wholly worthy of the praises sung on its behalf by BA's in countless Forum threads. Add another devotee to the list!"
"You all know what the bottle looks like, I poured it out of that. It's a rather intimidating, yet somehwat appealing hazy (murky) deep mahogany colour, massive beige head on the pour, spilling over, bursting at the seams. But that soon fades away, leaving me to deal with the matter at hand. The nose is quite nice, never noticed it much before now, rather inviting. Spicy and rummy, hints of preserved fruit, like the jarred cherries my Baba used to make. Quite intense. Flavour is very similar. It's something I've yet to find the words for. Wet IKEA throw-rug is not it though, I stand corrected. Like spiced buttered rum mixed with fruit, and then that elusive special ingredient (oh yeah, banana, that's it!). Yeah, this is pretty good stuff. Not the cat's ass like everyone else makes it out to be, but not as bad as I first took it to be either. Not a big fan of the style, couldn't drink more than one in a sitting, but I'm willing to give it the respect it deserves. I'd rather have a Unibroue instead. I think I will..."
"Update: Reviewed 11/23/04 and raising the Mouthfeel from 4.0 to 4.5. This beer is utterly consistant from year to year."
"poured a dark brown with a nice lacey head. has a full malt\fruty smell that comes through in th taste.with the higher abv i doubt i will be drinking too many in one sitting. but at has a nice body and a all around very nice beer."
"Another truly wonderful beer. Proving that once again this world is full of new tastes to be explored. Granted this one is quite old, but it was new to me!"
"Basically this beer is pure germany. I'm not sure if it's the high alcohol content or what, but this beer really tastes like a fresh wheat dunkel as if you're in Germany."
"Notes: Absolutely beautiful. Ripe fruit characteristics begin to rage as beer warms."

"A very drinkable beer, I would be happy with glass after glass."
"I originally sampled this brew many moons ago. I am writing this review from my notes. This beer has a very nice, complex aroma when poured. It's nice frothy head dies down quickly. It's dark amber in color w/ a flavor of cloves w/ hints of banana. It's a nice beer, but for my taste, it's nothing too exciting. At $3US a bottle, I won't get it again, not that it's bad tasting, it doesn't justify the cost for me."
"When poured into my glass, this beer poured a dark brown head with medium sized bubbles. The nose was that of clove and I could definitely taste the alcohol in this beer. I just couldn't acquire a taste for this beer. I thought it had a slight bitter aftertaste. To each his/her own."
"Overall: Highly anticipated, and now much respected, Aventinus is a legend well worth the hype. Dopplebocks are one of the most fascinating styles and this is an amazing interpretation of such. If you see it buy it, its that simple."
"Pours a medium brown with a nice big creamy head,the aroma is slightly sweet ans clovey.Has a banana pudding quality to it with some chocolate wafer tones,like some of the others I think this a pretty complex beer.A little heavy in the stomach so its not a highly drinkable beer for me,but a great complex beer."
"This beer would be fantastic late fall with a home-made apple pie, perhaps covered with some melted chedder, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This stuff is loaded with spicy apple/raisin, cinnimon, clove, and even a dusting of cocoa powder. The fruitiness is faint, while the waves of flavor attack with cheerful willingness, over and over again. A warmth from the alcohol is present throughout the experience with some noticeable heat on the palate. In addition, a near perfect bitterness keeps the beer in check. This is cool stuff, but after one I'm done for a while-kinda like cheese fries. The low drinkability reflects my personal idea of drinkability, which perhaps reflects the season In which I have sampled a particular beer. Drinkability to me means when I have finished (a fairly regulation size serving) drinking the beer, I say man, I'd really, really like to experience that again, and very soon at that!"
"Pours a light mahogany color and is topped with a beige, fizzy head that runs away quickly. Nose is full and sweet, fruity and malty. Flavor is very rich and sweet, primarily of strong malt plus some plum highlights. A slight alcohol aftertaste lingers on. Very tasty and enjoyable, but perhaps a bit too rich to have high drinkability."
"This brew poured a nice dark brown pour with a very lively medium head full of medium sized bubbles. It has a very mild cloven aroma. The body contained some yeast residue floating in it. It's taste leaves a lasting impression on your tongue as it goes down. It has a very nice taste with a hint of raisin and at the top of my list, but not the very top. After a few drinks, the alcohol content really comes through."
"Initial aroma of apple cider eventually leads to aromas of wheat and a slight phenolic waft. Poured a reddish-brown in color with a nice head. Chocolate and dark fruit come out more as the beer warms. Caramel and dark fruit are the most dominant flavors. Spicy on the back of the tongue leaving a nice tang. Very nice. I wouldn't necessarily call it to style, but damn is it good."
"A good brew, thick, rich, flavourful"
"Deep, dark brown pour with an enormous foamy head. Light hoppy nose with underlying hints of chocolate and plum. Lovely mouthfeel. Flavours of light, unsweetened chocolate, raisin, plum, a hint of banana and a spicey finish including some clove & nutmeg. Of course there is a noticeable alcohol kick on the finish. Very warm beer but yet not heavy. It stays light on the tongue and refreshes and yet is intense and complex in its flavours. A classic in my book."
"Overall: Very enjoyable example of the variety the reinheitsgebot purity law can offer. A well made, dark, rich beer that satisfies. You could drink more than one, but one scratched my beer itch. Highly recommended."
"Conclusion: Aging doesn't hurt, but doesn't increase the complexity or depth of flavor to as great a degree as I'd figured it would. Drink it fresh for best effect IMO - but if you have an aged bottle or two, it's still a wonderful brew."
"Another pickup from beer mecca(see: Half Time beerfly). It had a fizzy, bubbly white head. It was a deep and cloudy leather color with tons of carbonation bubbles fizzing to the top. I liked this beer better than the Celebrator. It had a richer, more distinct aroma full of berry bouquets and a hearty yet refreshing wheat smell. The taste was yeasty and fizzy, but perfectly balanced with a bitter aftertaste, musty a damp like a piece of water logged wood. A hearty ammount of spiced, ginger etc. flavoring, but nothing artifucial. Kinda resembled an iced tea. Very good."
"500ml bottle. I am a big fan of Weizens, and this is my first taste of a doppelbock. Pours a dark brown with hints of red, with a nice head that slowly settles. Aroma of cloves is evident. The first sip gives you that hint of chocolate and spices. Great mouth feel and finishes cleanly. An exceptional Weizen."
"Me likey. The cloudy amber beer with a wonderful thick head, it's purdy. And the aroma is awesome, a fruity, spicy aroma mixed in the texture of hops and malt with a hint of ginger. The smooth fruity tang livens up the front of my tongue. There is a cranberry type feel amongst the array of hop, malt, and fruit. The spices of ginger and cinnamon are evident to me in this wonderful beer. A great brew."
"Overall a very good beer. I really enjoyed this one."
"Notes: Another remarkable offering from Schneider & Sohn. The high alcohol content gives an extra dimension than many wheats. That said, the alcohol really comes to the forefront as it warms. This is a delicious, boozy brew, but enjoying for a session might land unexpected results."
"The beer pours a nebulous mahogany with orange highlights; the head is preposterous in size, the structure frothy, the color a medium tan. Nose has a bit or hint of the wheat grain. Mostly sweet malt, quite pleasing to the senses, start is ambrosial, nice malted grain profile with the top middling in feel. Finish has a crisp acidic bite, the hops subdued, the aftertaste dry and long lasting, a quite nice beer, as I have always been partial to the Bock sub-style."
"Drinkability: This is amazing. I could chug this, savor this, cherish this and love this."
"Solid mouthfeel, I like it, malt and fruit components up front, light chocolate blended with yeast on the finish. Very smooth, very drinkable and at 8%, very potent."
"Really looks like a very good wheat, but the color of a brown ale. A little lighter than a brown, but not much. Looks like there's a storm inside the beer and the thick, seafoam head continues to grow long after being poured. Smells like cherries and berries. Fantastic taste -- very complex. Can taste some fruits and wheat, and it has the clean, refreshing finish of a wheat."
"This a Great Wheat Bock beer. Impressive compacted head that stays throughout and a malty ultra smooth flavor with nice yeasty tones overall. Hints of caramel and clove as it warms with a very slight sourness. The 8% ABV is obscured by it's full body and flavor. Another very impressive beer from Schneider."
"My bottle (German) says Aventinus Weizenstarkbier (Italian: Birra Doppio Malto), but this must be the same thing (same ABV too). Theoretically I might encounter a better Weizen than this one, but I doubt very much that will ever happen. Murky brown colour, large head, aroma of Paradise: Cloves and other undefinable spices, dried fruits (figs), oak and sandalwood. Oaky cloves flavour with hints of burnt caramel. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelmingly so. Dry aftertaste. This is a thoroughly well made beer!"
"I poured this beer into my special German drinking glass and watched the enourmous, delicious head foam up. After a minute or two the head dissapated and revealed a dark brown beer. The taste of this beer is pretty strong, like a super Hefe Weissen. It goes down smooth and, with an 8% alcohol content, gives a decent kick. I recommend this beer for anyone who enjoys Hefe weissens, or anyone who wants to enjoy a fine German beer. However, the average Corona drinker probably wouldn't appreciate it."
"Pours a dark caramel color with a thick, off white head. The head retention is tremendous, as it lasts seemingly forever. The aroma is roasted malt, bananas, clove, and a touch of alcohol. The taste is sweet and crisp, all at once. A great roasted taste is combined with a fruity, bready, yeasty component, all well balanced. A touch of bitterness is in the finish, along with the characteristic wheat crispness. The aftertaste brings to mind chocolate covered bananas, with just a hint of cloves. The mouthful is creamy, feeling sinful on the tongue. I think I could drink these all day long! I bought this particular bottle in November to celebrate a pending job (so I thought). I cracked it open tonight to celebrate a different job that was just finalized. Although I was expecting great things from this beer, it still surprised me. A must buy for any wheat beer lover."
"This poured a brownish red with a small slightly tan head that managed to remain pretty well despite the fact that i did not give it much of a vigorous pour. I'll just have to try it again and pour with more energy. The smell was dominantly fruity and sweet, with a hint of yeast. I picked out apples and raisons, with a bit of caramel. It actually smelled a bit like a caramel apple to me, very pleasant. The taste was equally as pleasant, sweet and malty with a hint of caramel and fruit while also spicy and yeasty. Very complex smooth and tasty. Medium carbonation and body combine for a very good mouth feel, and smooth drinkabilty. I never got a sense of the 8%ABV. Overall a wonderful brew, and my first venture into the world of wheat ales or doppelbocks, but it will definitely not be my last."
"The nose is very strong and you can pick up on the hops, fruit notes (apples and raisons) as well has the the great yeast that goes into this brew. I had never had a doppelbock and I don't think this one was the best place to start beings as it was dominated by its yeast. Still, this is a great beer. A ton of complexity here, and also a very smooth brew. I compared it to Rare Vos (Ommegang) to my friends but pointed out that it managaes to be even more drinkable and smooth even with its greater alcohol content. Great beer!"
"Pours a dark murky brown color with a nice 2 finger off white very dense head. The aromas of light wheat and faint fruit delight the senses in a subtle way. The first swallow reveals a hop/carb bite that opens your eyes in sheer surprise. The flavors of wheat, smooth malts, cloves, and light spices start revealing themselves about midway through each swallow. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for such an array of flavors but it does not take much away from such a well-balanced complex brew! Very nice! Prosit!"
"front lines. Ein Prosit."
"Another great offering from Herr Schneider and Son. Good looking cloudy dark peach color with a decent head and great lacing. I really sense cloves in the wheat beers from this brewer and I like what I'm tasting. Somehow what doesn't sound that good to me does taste good. The mouthfeel is a bit astringent and there is too much aftertaste to rate it 5s, but this is good stuff nonetheless."
"The classic example of the Weizenbock style...enough said!"
"Pours a hazy, dark brown color with plum colored highlights and a lot of carbonation bubbles. The massive, fluffy off-white head presented itself immediately upon pouring. The froth died down incredibly slow, leaving a beautiful lace on the glass. The nose is very complex, there are so many things going on here. Every time I took a whiff, I smelled something different, bananas, cloves, alcohol, raisins, chocolate, and just a hint of nutmeg. The flavor knocked me off my feet, it matched the aroma perfectly. Initial taste was of sweet fruit, followed by a bit of hop bitterness, then the alcohol, and if that wasnt enough there was a spicy zing of cloves at the finish. The only mouthfeel complaint that I have is that there was a bit too much carbonation, it think it distracted me a little from tasting all the flavors that that this beer contained. This is one of the best dopplebocks that Ive had, and its very reasonably priced."
"Had a moderate to short finish, with a subdued cream in the finish. Very quiet hops and sour were in the aftertaste and lingered with welcome on the appropriate buds. This beer is so unobtrusive yet still so hearty in both taste and aftertaste. There was some tingle on the tongue that helped to call me back, and the mouthfeel was sort of watery-oily. And from these notes, and everything else with it, this beer is so very drinkable. Compared to the other classic dopplebock, Celebrator, more fruity and spicy, and classic in its own right."
"This wheat-doppelbock poured a cloudy brown color with a lot of light tan foam. The smell was very fruity (bananas), which surprised me for a doppelbock, but I suppose the wheat is responsible for these esters. The taste was also dominated by the fruity banana oils, but caramel malt, yeast, and a trace of musty grape flavor came through. The mouthfeel was sweet and fruity, with medium carbonation, and medium body. This bock was very drinkable (I guess I am a sucker for fruity esters)."
"A great brew. Pours a cloudy light-brown, like a doppelbock. Nose is fruity, with some banana, and yeasty. Flavor is fruity and a little spicy with some chocolate undertones. Clove finish. Medium-bodied with a tingly mouthfeel. Somewhat alcoholic. This is a great beer. Definitely warming. A little on the pricey side, but great once in a while."
"The kind of beer that makes you say, ""Hmmm," after every sip. That's not a bad thing, but I don't think most of us would want to have more than one per night..."
"It's a very dark and murky brown color with a moderate tan head which leaves a nice coating. Aroma consists of raisins, bananas, faint alcohol....flavors in this beer are very much ripe fruit and faint alcohol as it warms. Quite an enjoyable and full-bodied brew. I don't think I could have more than one though."
"Over all a very good and enjoyable brew."
"This is an outrageous beer. To my taste and in my experience the best of its type."
"A remarkable looking beer, this one poured into an official Aventinus wheat glass, with a very full head. Not only was the head nice and full, but as the beer sat the head expanded. It didn't bubble down to a thin layer, but it started to expand until it rose above the rim of the glass. I watched the beer for at least two minutes before I even took my first sip, it was just amazing how long the head was lasting, unlike any beer I have ever seen. The dark brown amber body complemented the creamy brown tone of the head so well. The sweetness in the aroma carrie wheat barley along the alcohol. The nose was like a sweet fig brandy with raisins to complement the complex full aroma. The yeast character from the banana esters were also detectable with in the scent of the beer. The lace formed perfectly and full as I sipped on this huge beer. It is so full bodied with a creamy thick and chewy mouthfeel, that this beer is a meal by itself. The same yeast flavors of the banana and clove is here with buttery notes of apples and raisins. A wonderful aftertaste full of malty goodness laced with alcohol on the tongue. I would love to enjoy this beer regularly, but too many of these put down could equal quite a mess with the high alcohol and full body these are meant to be enjoyed one at a time. I wish I could put more of these away, because it is amazing in every way."
"Ruby-brown in color with a minimal head. The aroma is of sweet malt, wheat, and somewhat clovey. The flavor is big and malty, with the hints of clove. It is medium bodied with an alcoholic finish. A smooth and drinkable German brew. I enjoyed this beer, and most definitely will drink this one again."
"This was one of my two lunch beers today, and it's a classic that I've enjoyed many times -- this time in a bottle. Deep copper brown color -- like mahogany furniture or something, really. Head dissipates a bit faster than most wheat beers, but the aroma is strong. Raisinets and wheaty lemon zest. Tastes great as well. Someone put their Christmas gift basket of fruits and bittersweet chocolates in this beer. Wheat finish with a stronger malt presence up front. Overall a nice combination of flavors. Great beer. The vintage 1996 and 1999 are, to my recollection, even an improvement upon this."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown, with a huge, light-tan, puffy and cloud like head. Head slowly dimishes to a pretty strong lacing. Aroma is strong on the banana, with some clove sneaking in, too. Flavor is also strong on the banana, with some slight hints of chocolate, and ending with some clove and spiceyness. In the mouth, it has some tingly carbonation, and a tiny hint of alcohol as it gets warmer."
"Glad I picked this one up. Big tan creamy head on a thick dark copper beer that is anything but clear. The foam sticks for a while and seriously feels like shaving cream. The beer smells fruity and spicy with clove and apple being most distinctive. Tastes are similar with banana and brown sugar or molasses flavors present. The carbonation is fine with great mouthfeel and this is an altogether extremely pleasing brew."
"Pours a brownish copper color with a huge foamy off-white colored head that eventually dissipates into a creamy and sticky lace. Nose is wonderful overripe banana, clove, and nutmeg with a touch of light caramel. Leaves me almost drooling to take a sip. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is quite fruity with notes of sweet malts, spicy clove, molasses, and a mild alcohol bite that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. A truly wonderful beer. Perhaps the finest Weizenbock Ive ever sampled."
"Pours a deep chestnut with a highly carbonated off white head that fades fast to a thin carbonated layer. No lace to speak of. A wonderful fruity aroma, malt, mollasses, breadiness are all there too. Taste of raisins and cloves most prominent. Sweet with very little bitterness. Very malty. Carbonation is just right with a smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable considering the 8% abv."
"I've always enjoyed a good dunkel-weizen, with the only drawback being a relatively low ABV. I also love a good doppelbock, but it's not a refreshing style of beer. Well, here's a great combination of the two. Refreshing, easy to drink, and plenty powerful! Pours large head (as to be expected), dark and creamy. The alcohol makes itself noticed, and the clovey-spiciness is prominent (along with the taste of banana). Overall, one of the absolute great beers. This is one of my regulars, and I've tried many other attempts at the style -no other comes close."
"Pours a copper-orange with full tan head, that dissipates rapidly. I'm not a big fan of Wheat beers, and this is just a reminder why. I have tried it several times now, and I find it no better than drinkable. Way too fruity for my tastes, but it does improve as you go. Strong bannana and a bit of clove and raisin. A complex beer, if you enjoy the style you will likely find this a rewarding taste. I try to rate with the style in mind, otherwise this beer would have a very low rating from me. Its not the beer's fault I think the style tastes like ^%#@."
"What a fine, fine beer! I wasn't expecting to like this beer as much as I did. Complex doesn't begin to describe it. Pours out to a plum darkness in the glass with a light brown head that reminds you of brown sugar. The aroma is that of fruit. The taste. Man, the taste. Where to begin? Initially, there is a presence of nutmeg, cloves and banana, much like a regular wheat beer. But just when you think this is what you get, the beer transforms as it warms and the clove/banana taste leaves and a warm fruit taste of raisins takes over. A wonderful beer that truly hides the 8% ABV very well."
"I've tried this one from the bottle too and the difference in taste/drinkability is tremendous! On tap this stuff has no business going down as easy as it does with an 8% abv and tons of taste. Cloudy orangish/brown with a nice head that dies quick..but who cares? This beer still tastes great down to the last sip! A welcome fruity taste but not overbearing by any means. Definitely bananas detected, some other slight tropical type fruit tastes. Has a slight alcohol bite to let you know what you're getting into, but really adds to the overall taste. Two twenty oz. glasses and you're feeling grand, but could easily drink many more. This is great year round and should be sought out by all!! Fantastic!!"
"As tasted in Munich, a wonderful, full-bodied Weizenbock. Very drinkable with a chocolaty aftertaste and very filling being that it is a Weizen. Alcohol is noticeable and makes an impact at the end of an 18 oz. glass. The beer is excellent alone or with dessert, mainly a sweeter one. Worth seeking out on draft in March in Germany."
"Mike"
"Here goes.another one down the hatch, a few more of these and I wont be able to judge a thing. Anyways, the head come in a shade of off-white that is often associated with cheap white walls. The bier color is..um.root beer candy brown. The aroma is that of a lemon/citrus hefe. Slightly off-colored from most hefe smells. It tastes like a burnt orange peel soaked in a light hefe-weizen. Brewed for the hefe lovers only, and not for the beginner hefe drinker."
"Big off-white head, dark violet color. Chocolate aromas detected from arm's length, just after I poured it into it's own unique Aventinus glass, footed at the bottom, ballooning at the top. With a closer sniff, all kinds of things come spilling out of this aromatic cornucopia! Cloves, cocoa, anise, spices, dark fruits. Great malt, some sparkling hops, long, luxurious finish. A glorious balance between dark and light. More flavors leap to the imagination as I savor each sip...peppers, raisins, I search for other fruits, but I'll stick with grapes. Halfway through this 16.9 oz,. bottle the head has disappeared, but the flavor's still bursting through! Heavy, alcoholic, but remarkably drinkable, with spice and raisiny flavors standing triumphant. A unique creation, and one of the best sips I've ever put to my lips!"
"[16.9 oz. for $2.99] and well worth every penny !!"
"very nice balance of yeast and wheat flavors dominate the beer. you get a constant sweet flavor that will warm you a little bit, but you will not get any of the alcohol flavor despite the 8%. tingly carbonation and a solid body that is nice and rich give it great consistency and a wonder to drink. this beer has a lot of flavor, and its complexity is truly remarkable. this is fine beer."
"Dark brown color. Large creamy head. Malty spicy aroma with a touch of banana and clove. WOW. Big, bold beer.Banana and cloves moves to raisins, fruit, chocolate and citrus. Taste really grabs at you. Which is NOT a bad thing. Warming taste. Alcohol is evident, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. NICE beer."
"It pours a very cloudy deep brown, with a thick head atop, and the yeasty spice aroma hits you immediately. Very nice. Quite bubbly in the mouth, yet extremely pleasing to sip. The wheat flavor stands out, and the yeastiness is balanced well with a bit of a sweet, almost fruity flavor. Mild warming alcohol, but you would never know this was an 8% ABV beer. An excellent brew, I am glad to have finally imbibed this baby!"
"It pours your basic brown with little head. The smell and taste are spicy with the characteristic bock flavors. The wheat does make for a bit of a departure from the typical dopplebock. It goes down well and is highly drinkable in spite of the 8% abv."
"This is not your regular Aventinus, its vintage dated by the brewery 1999. Great beer thats just a little smoother with age. All the details of the beer are the same nice creamy copper color, with nice frothy head. Classic bannana, clove nose but a little more subtle with age. Very drinkable, but the cost is also about double since they aged it."
"Goes a bit wrong in the mouth. The clove is there, although a bit strong, but the sweet malt is an almost over-whelming presence. Not enough bitterness to balance the too sweet palate, and the alcohol is apparent on the finish - always a turn-off for me. Perhaps an off-bottle, but I couldn't finish it. Based on reputation, I'd be willing to give it another shot, but this was disappointing."
"This beer pours a nice deep brown. This beer didnt have much in the way of head, most other times Ive had this beer I've gotten a nice layer of creamy head. The aromas are of fruit and caramel, but a hint of cloves can be picked up. This is defiantly a full-bodied beer. Chocolate and cloves dominate the flavor. I absolutely love this beer and it is a staple in my beer diet. Drinking more than 3 of these would bring me to my knees. The alcohol is not as present as some other beers that I have drank with similar alc./vol."
"This is one of the best wheat beers I've ever had and also one of the few BA top 20 beers that I feel actually deserves a higher ranking. I bought one of these to review, I should have bought four!"
"I have been waiting to try this beer as there has been so much talk about it. It pours a ruby brown color with a three finger off white head that lasts and lasts. The smell is typical of most Weizens with bananas and yeast coming through. This beer has a more complex flavor than most in this style. Plums, raisins & bananas are the flavors that I find come through. Very smooth in the finish. I would love to try this on tap!"
"Pours a cloudy honey-brown color, crazy ass, foamy, clingy white head, nice lacing. Aroma of toffee and bananas, strong banana yeasty bubblegum flavor, some alcohol taste in the finish, a very good weizen bock."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Dark amber color with an off-white head. Nifty fruit aroma of grapes and raisins (same thing I guess). Complex flavor of fruits and malt. I am new to the Weizen Bock genre but this was good!"
"Little know fact: Schneirer Weisse also makes a distilled liquor from this brew called Aventinus Elderbrand (Noble Fire) waiting for a shipment from Germany to try this though - next week. Just got confirmation on it. I will add a review for that after we try it."
"Tasted 12-27--02. Aromas of clay, terracotta, wet rugs, cola, vanilla, fresh plum, very complex and subtle. Not having another, ""fresh"" Aventius to compare it to, I opened another ""aged"" beer, St. Georgen Kellerbier. The latter seemed to wear its age more gracefully, with plenty of lively flavor. I'm sure it's a difference of tank vs. bottle age as well."
"Nonetheless, a damn fine beer. I just know I am going to enjoy my Suarez into the world of German beer."
"Pours a dark brown with the usual high off white head that lasts through the glass. Aromas of the usual Hefe- but with a more pronounced malt nose, not the usual banana/clove. An excelent beer with the meal I was having, thirst quenching. I will try it again without the meal."
"This beer poured a murky brown color and formed a huge, I mean huge, foamy off white head that retained for quite awhile.  Heavy amount of carbonation present.  An aroma of clove, citrus and malt.  The flavor was of clove and malt."
"Long lasting, fine, creamy head.  Deep cloudy mahogany color.  Very strong currant/raisin, clove nose.  Full bodied, tingly tongue sensations, mellows.  Toasty malt, prune, currant, caramel flavors.  A grassy/flower-like finish.  Way nice!!!!"
"Wow, i like this one. Cloudy, well carbonated with a active off-white head. Toasted malt and a fruity (banana) aroma jumps at your nose. Smooth, spicy and clove just begin to describe the taste. The alcohol presence is comfortably warming. I'm dissapointed i only have one, wish i bought more.Well  deserving of it's high ranking."
"Wow, here's an irrestible beer. Pours a fascinating, off-white head that positions itself nicely atop the cloudy brown liquid. The smell is very diverse with notes of clove, yeast, bananas, perhaps some chocolate and caramel, as well. Taste is similar, but is more on the malty side with some spiciness tied in. Tastes rather sweet, with that caramel and/or chocolate malt taking priority. Very tasty. It's all accompanied by a solid, smooth mouthfeel. For a doppelbock, this one easy drinking beer -- a must-try!"
"Tasty with a pronounced sweet desert characteristic, Aventinus Wheat-Doppelbock is a major wheat Ale."
"Deep, dark chocolate color with cloudiness that you can see in the edges.  Foamy, light tan head that is very active from the heavy carbonation caused by the yeast.  Strong yeast character in the nose, a bit sour, almost like vinegar.  Fruity and malty undertones are also noticeable.  As it journeys to your palate, you find a very spicy dried fruit character with an underlying chocolate maltiness, and then a unique spicy finish, which the bottle describes as ""clove-like"".  A smooth, yet exciting mouthfeel from the carbonation and spiciness.  This reminds me of a Belgian tripel in many ways.  This is excellent!  I didn't know what to expect from it, but I got quite a pleasant surprise.  A very complex brew that intrigues your palate and makes your taste buds dance for joy!"
"Pours a dark, reddish brown, cloudy due to the yeast. Big, tight head with nice lace. The aroma seemed a little spicy, with a peppery bite and some alcohol to the nose. Well carbonated but slips down with ease, creamy and very full mouthfeel. Slight hint of alcohol (rum) with spicy and fruity flavors. In the end, the flavors are very well balanced and plentiful. Thankfully, it comes in the larger 500ml bottle, and I get the chance to have a generous second pour into the glass."
"Pours a cloudy/murky brown with a densely packed head. Wonderful fruity-yeasty banana nose. Excellent clove and banana flavors wash over the palate, maltiness is balanced beautifully with the power of the alcohol notes of this awesome beer. Finishes malty-sweet, drying slightly at the end. A wonderful beer to enjoy slowly...almost a Belgian quality in it's taste profile."
"Drinkability is only 3.5 because while I was very satisfied after I finished it, I did not need another one (right away).  Maybe it was too damn delicious for me to handle."
"This is the mother-of-all Weizenbocks.  The classic aroma hints strongly of Weihenstephan yeast.  Full-bodied with a strong warming alcohol sensation.  At 8% alcohol, this is definitely a strong beer, but the alcohol doesn't overpower the complex fruity malt flavors.  Virtually no hop bitterness.  Overall, an outstanding doppelbock."
"Malty and deep with just the right amount of spiciness. Lighter than one would expect just by looking at it because of the relatively high (8%) alcohol. Great beer for relaxing with in the evening. Perhaps a little bit too carbonated."
"This is a dangerously drinkable beer, and something I can see myself coming back to again and again."
"Whenever I happen upon a beer that is as highly rated as this one, I feel I must give it a try, even if I think I won't like it.  Well, this beer packs a punch on many levels.  It poured with a dark chocolate color with tiny tan bubbles.  Smell was that of a rich port, but with some citrus notes.  The taste is truly overwhelming- massive amount of malt with a slight tang of cloves and figs or some other dried fruit was predominant.  Filled up my mouth and my tastebuds.  You cannot drink another beer after this one, and frankly, I'm not sure you can have two of these in the same sitting."
"I am not in love with this one as most other BAs are, but it is not bad.  It poured a very cloudy amber with a thick off-white head.  I thought the aroma was very malty.  The citrusy taste of the wheat comes through at once, giving way to a smokey aftertaste.  I do agree with most BAs that it is a thick, chewy beer.  Refreshing, but not my style."
"An interesting beer - my first wheat doppelbock, so I don't have a standard by which to judge this.  Very pleasant clove aroma and flavor from the yeast.  Less malty than most doppelbocks,  but more body than most weizen styles.  Alcohol is a noteworthy flavoring component, lending some pepper to the finish, with some rum-like notes.  I'm not sure I'm quite as taken with this beer as my fellow BA's, but a tasty beer, without question."
"Dark reddish brown, like strong cloudy tea. Easy head had fairly large, soda-like bubbles form the head, but without the fizziness. As for taste, it's got the same strong esteriness of the Schneider weisse with the richer slight caramelly taste from the darker malts. Finishes with cloves. Tasty."
"The brew was a dark amber/ruby color with a nice yeasty haziness and a good creamy head that fades slowly.  The smell was sweet with tons of fruitiness and some nice biscuity yeast.  The flavor starts off with some nice sweet/tart vinous fruity flavors with some definite banana qualities and some raisins as well.  There is some yeasty biscuity/bready flavors as well as a nice warming alcohol glow.  The brew was very smooth and creamy and had the trademark full mouthfeel of the unfiltered wheat beers.  For the strength of this brew it was amazingly drinkable.  I could see myself putting away a lot of these and being very happy to do so."
"Pours with cloudy, dark tones that hint at the dark flavors that round out the taste.  Ripe, fruity (banana?) aromas are inviting but are only part of the full flavor profile, which starts wonderfully crisp and finishes with a dark, full flavor.  Exceptional mouthfeel.  I can't imagine drinking tons of this, but I also can't imagine liking too many beers more than I like this one."
"Nice light brown / dark copper color, bit foggy / hazy. Very nice creamy head. The aroma is a fruity / banana and yeast. The taste is fruity, sweet taste; hints of bananas and cloves, touch of caramel, and some raison notes in there as well. I thought it was balanced to near perfection. Overall a excellent brew! Enjoyed this at Ludwigs Garten (in Philly) with the Bierman9 & Artied2."
"I am glad I tried it due to other ""BA's"" ranking it quite high.  Nicely drinkable at 8% abv."
"This is one excellent brew. It pours a very dark brown almost black color, with a tan head that quickly dissapates. Upon smelling the beer, you can smell a strong carmel and malt presence, as well as alcohol. The first sip is pure heaven, very smooth and refreshing. There are slight fruit flavors and alot of spice. One might also notice a very very slight chocolate flavor. Overall this is one very smooth beer, and very strong at the same time."
"The garnet hued, slightly chill - hazed bubbly brew is topped by a dense, creamy and smooth off - white head. The combination of banana esters, toasty munich malt, subtle chocolately notes and dark caramel is reminescent of a banana split topped with chocolate syrup and roasted pine nuts.  The overall flavor is incredibly smooth, sweet and is comprised of a fine melange of wheat tartness and residual and caramel malt sweetness... The fruitiness from the yeast adds complexity yet doesn't detract from the mellow chocolate notes.  Full in body and quite rich, but there is nothing cloying overall at all in this fine brew.  Flavorwise, this brew truly exhibits a fine balance between the rich, melanoidin qualities of a doppelbock and the lighter yet complex fruity notes of a German wheat.  The finish is sweet, a bit tart, but an enjoyable dark Munich malt toastiness lingers.  Smooth, satisifying, alcohol warmth coats the throat several seconds after the sip is done.  Aventinus Wheat Doppelbock is an absolutely rich, delicious, yet highly drinkable brew."
"Absolutely heaven. The taste of banana's and clove's are well balanced. I have never tasted a wheat dopplebock like this. First impression was like tasting heaven, smooooth and velvety. Absolutely the best wheat dobblebock I've tried this decade. Everytime I've tried it, it's still number one."
"This is a wonderful beer.  The aroma is an experience in itself.  Over-the-top Yeast, clove, spice, banana:  Extreme Weiss.  The beer has a soft, dark brown color with a huge tan head that lasts through the bottom of the glass.  Smooth, velvety mouthfeel.  Not much alcohol taste despite the 8%, but there is a nice warming effect.  I loved every sip of this one."
"Who's the monk-looking dude?"
"The pinnacle of wheat beers. This classic became a favorite of mine since my first sip over a year ago and still is. Head froths up even with a gentle pour and is hard to contain in the glass. Delicate brownish color and hints of banana fruitiness in the nose. Banana-clove, chocolate, caramel, and alcohol flavors all mingle together and is offset with just the right amounts of hops to subdue the sweetness of the malt. Has a creamy mouthfeel from the yeast and is much easier to drink than the 8% abv suggests. IMO, the world's greatest beer."
"Looks like a pilsener shaped tootsie roll with a bone white beard in the glass. A cream puff doused in a pear and brandy sauce might smell something like Aventinus. Still a hefeweiss, but a hefeweiss with a serious malt base. The malt is kept in check with bittering hops while the typical hefe lip-smacking tartness asserts itself by stepping all over spicy clove toes. A myriad of flavors compound to make this one outstanding brew. If you like hefeweissbiers, than I beseech you, try an Aventinus."
"Weiss Doppelbock:  Good looking, nice smelling, but man that Weiss/yeast flavor is over the top. It was just too much for me, as I’m not a huge fan of the style, but if you are, this is the one to go to.  It is the Weiss beer on steroids."
"Man oh man, what a treat. First off, I love the look: deep caramel, almost brown with an orange tinge, and yeasty cloudiness. Nice, foamy off-white head that dissipates a bit quickly. The smell is unique, not quite a weisse, and not quite a doppel. I swear it smells like a cross between a weisse, a doppel, and, of all things, a Belgian dubbel. Huge fruity flavors, banana and raisins and tropical fruits, with the traditional wheaty clove finish. Quite a bit more tang than a doppel bock! Carbonation is also reminiscent of a Belgian more so than a traditional weisse or doppel due to the bottle fermentation. Despite the 8% abv, I find this to be incredibly drinkable, and not just in cooler temps, either!"
"A chill-hazed amber-orange appearance with carbonation evident.  Very nice clove and nutmeg on the nose.  Tangy wheat malt aroma also present.  What strikes me on first tasting are 2 things:  One, this is a very easy drinking beer foe 8% a/v.  Two, this isn't overly sweet like I was expecting.  On the buds, you get some of your typical weizen characteristics:  Phenol, Clove, Vanilla and Banana.  The phenolic character is really kept in check nicely.  Must be some nice hopping in this brew to keep what could be a very sweet beer (and style) from becoming too sweet.  Was surprised I never tasted the alcohol in this one.  Great brew."
"Dark caramel color, medium bubbled thick head that is charged from bottle fermentation.  Slightly marmalade and malty aroma.  Nice smell...Deep maple, raisins, and spice flavors, fades just about perfectly.  Just a touch of wheat acidity.  Nice medium body that's not at all sticky.  Finishes as diminished spicy and raisiny, not cloying, adding to drinkability.  Dang fine brew here."
"amazing.  pours out an off brown, and after you work up the yeast, it turns a more milky dark tan.  the nose is unbelievable...ripe fruit, ripe bananas, clove, some caramel and chocolate malt.  an intoxicating wine like aroma to adds to the sensory overload.  taste is of caramel apples, with prune, plum, banana and clove on top of  a slick, buttery mouthfeel. the addition of all the yeast really expands the taste.  some light spicy hops to add an ending crispness.   you have reached german beer nirvana.  the best of both worlds in a bock and wheat.  a perfect selection for the first warm days of spring.   outstanding."
"This beer really impressed me. Dark amber brown with a big white foamy head. Thick rich taste and feel for a wheat. Heavy yeast flavor, almost chewy, but delicious. Hints of roasted malt and nutty as well. Is there brown sugar in this ? It tasted great. 8% ABV warms you quickly, but easy to drink. 1/2 hour after drinking, I was wishing for more. I only had one bottle, comes in a basic brown bottle with a purple label. A beer worthy of a national championship game or a holiday meal !"
"Reminds me a lot of the Hacker Pschorr Weiss Dark that is my favorite summer brew....Really charged up on the pour..bubbly head settles down quickly....The aroma is what I would expect of a dark wheat...banana, cloves...citrus..brown and cloudy in color, this is one tasty beverage...sweet and fruity...plums..banana's...oranges...covered in brown sugar...an excellent beer.  One of the finest I have tasted for this style."

"Thick head with lacy bubbles on a hazy caramel colored beer. Strong straw-like yeasty smell, laced with plums, banana, and rum-alcohol. Thick and syrupy on the palate, with a strong earth yeast character, rich sugary plum, and heavy alcohol. Almost no bitterness of hops. Thick on the mouth, with a near perfect carbonation. All in all, perhaps a little sweet for me, a very very good beer, but a tad sweet."
"Every time I have this I wonder why I don't stock it more often.  Simply a world classic.  Take all the properties of your favorite dunkel and combine them with your favorite bock and you'll get close to Aventinus."
"fantastic beer, great drinkability, especially for a winters night, fantastic drop, lots of banana, clove, chocolate and even a bit of spice and some dark fruit, moderately acidic bitter finish, pretty good stuff."
"A gift from the gods ... I love having this with some stilton and rye bread. Now that is sheer heaven."
"A very easy drinking 8%. Nice chocolate and roasted malt, trace alcohol."
"A wondrous spicy / fruity dark wheat. If I want wheat I would go for this beer every time."
"Are there any others like it? Banana, clove, bubble gum -- all the classic weisse flavors -- plus caramel and a strong alcohol kick. Very effervescent. This is the original weizenbock and it's still the champ. At least, I think it is -- what's with Schneider's relabeling of all their beers with the Tap numbers? Regardless, I love it."
"Notes: A massive wheat brew that is unsurpassed by any other of its kind. Unpasteurized, unfiltered, top fermented and original bottle fermentation. The yeast in this brew, make the brew. After pouring, there was enough yeast to begin propagation. This is by far one of the best bock beers tasted to date."
