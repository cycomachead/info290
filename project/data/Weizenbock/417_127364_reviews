"Overall, a wonderful experiment from Schell's.  I like the little bit of hop bitterness added to a weizen. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"overall, an experimental concoction that is interesting, yet disappointing.   oh well, nice try at a style i know Schell can crush if they so desire."

"Overall: Beer #3 from the Schell weiss mixer. I was most looking forward to this beer because I absolutely loved the 2010 Schell Snowstorm weizenbock. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this nearly as much. It was kind of all over the place, and light on what I enjoy in weizenbocks (lots of banana, heavyness, sweetness). Interesting but a little disappointing."
"Poured this into the Schell hex-base weisse glass. Slightly cloudy golden liquid, with a large fluff of white head that displayed good retention and lacing. Aroma was yeast-dominant, notes of banana and clove, as would be expected, toasted wheat, citrus zest. Taste was on the dull side, bland pale malts and toasted wheat, bready yeast, banana and clove, slight sugary sweetness, damp compost. Not too bad for the style, but I wasn't really feeling it. Seemed old. Light-medium body, a bit harsh in the mouthfeel. Not terrible, but I definitely wouldn't want anymore than a single serving."
"The ""bock"" part of this is background and it presents as more of a bigger weizen and from that feels more summer like than winter like. Some hop presence with a green taste and feel in the finish and lingering. Soft fruit flavors show (eg. orange shows in time), but to me they are in the background to the spiciness of the yeast."

"Good experiment, it teeters between sublime and awful."

"I wouldn't call this horrible but it is not real spot-one for style and I expect a German type brewery to be spot-on and not push the boundaries in new ways. It's OK. I wouldn't buy it again if offered in six-packs or whatever. I know what I like in this style and this interpretation does not do it for me. Funny as I love the heck out of their hefe."
"Overall: Pretty dry and hoppy for a Weizenbock. This is certainly not typical of the style, but like the August's Bock they made last fall, I like the use of nontraditional hops in a traditional German beer. I hope the average goes up for this one, because I don't think many people get what was intended here."

"Overall, a lighter weizenbock in my opinion. Easy to drink and good for the summer. A bit dry for me, however."

"Very underwhelmed with this beer. I know Schell's can produce a weizenbock, so not sure why this was not that good."
