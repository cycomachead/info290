4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, 4880 bottle code. Pours very hazy/cloudy dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, date, banana, chocolate, brown sugar, dark bread, molasses, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with incredible complexity and balance of big dark/bready/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, date, banana, chocolate, brown sugar, dark bread, molasses, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, date, banana, chocolate, brown sugar, dark bread, molasses, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible weizenbock style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

3.77,-3.3,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"This beer poured out darker than I thought it would. The color was a murky brown with a pretty nice looking bubbly head on it. The smell of the beer was of strong malts and some wheat in the background. The taste of the beer had a slight acidic bitterness to it up front, possibly from the dark malts used. The aftertaste though was a smooth wheat flavor that I found to be quite refreshing. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and overall I found this beer to be pretty good.","Knapp85","Jun 25, 2011"

Scent is quite a welcoming blend of fresh crusty dark multi-grain bread, roasted nuts, hint of tootsie roll like chocolate, notes of blackened banana, light berry fruityness mingles with grassy and grainy hops. Begins with quite a taste of tartness that was unexpected from scent, behind the tartness, one can pick up the wonderful components of scent, but slightly washed out in the finnish by an odd medicinal sassafras/root beer barrel candy note. As i sip, the taste becomes more cohesive and works quite nicely - i thought it was going to be undrinkable at first. Medium bodied, light grainyness on the palate, slightly dry. I thought i was going to love this beer, then i thought i was going to hate it, and then in the end i ended up mostly liking it. Oddly enough, wish i had another glass at home so i could sit and think about it some more.","rfgetz","Jun 20, 2011"

The flavor is a bit off. I know my store may be selling old stuff from other German imports I have bought. This flavor has a tangyness and no balance which I belive is uncharacteristic for the style.

The malts used here are more earthy and the grainy bread like flavors are paramount. Not nearly as much of the banana, clove flavors typical of regular Weizen beers.

4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This was a new arrival at our store, so I decided to try one. The beer pours a rich brown. Slightly hazy with a thick off-white head that thake forever to calm down. Aromas at first were that of wine. It had a sour, yet earthy character reminiscent of young Chateau Margaux. It dominated most of the boquet until I really stuck my nose into the glass and detected the aromas of the grains that were used to make this brew. The flavor was amazing. Fruity, yet at the same time mellowed out with sweet caramel and toffee overtones. Followed with a touch of dried fruit and a nice dry finish. This beer is definitely one to leave its mark. It's been almost five minutes since my last sip and I can taste it like it just came off my tongue. This was one unique brew. My standard for thisstyle is Aventinus, but I can almost put this there if not in front. A great sipper for these cold winter nights.","WYVYRN527","Jan 24, 2009"

All these, I hope, are due to the expiration issue of this bottle, otherwise I really can't find it worth production at all. Got to try it again!","wl0307","Dec 01, 2008"

3.9,0,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Mahrs is one of my favorite German breweries, so when I saw that they had their Weiss Bock out on the shelf, decided to see what it was all about. I poured this one in to a Schneider Edel-Weisse glass. Color is an opaque brown, with two fingers of frothy tan heading. Smell is of sweet brown bread with powdered sugar on top. Some clove and medicinal aromas also show themselves. Taste has brownies, dark fruit such as plum, raisin, more clove, and perhaps a bit of cinnamon. Body is light, bright and spritzy, with good carbonation. Malt is nice on the palate, with little hopping. One of these is good enough for me, but certainly a respectable Weiss Bock from the Mahrs brewery. Recommended.","jamie2dope","Aug 10, 2008"

Flavor is well layered and quite sweet. Creamy texture with lots of taste. Caramel, toffee, spice, pie crust, loads of fruits (apple, plum), even a light hint of tobacco.

3.92,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"These beers typically have everything in them, even the kitchen sink, and all going a different direction. This beer is no different, but the flavors and characteristics seem to come together more than most. The beer opens with an expected hazy, rusty, dirty hue, great head formation that faded rather quick for a wheat beer. Aromas of strong wheat malt wrapped into the barley well, leaving a nice base for intense fruity esters and complimentary phenolics. Bannans, grapes, berries, dates, figs, plumbs, prunes, and apples round out the esters, while a clove, peppery, smokey character is given with the phenols. Quite rich and full palated with warming alcohols that thin the beer for easy drinking. The carbonation fell quickly, leaving the beer a bit flat late. It's not quite Aventinus, but it's a nice Weizenbock.","BEERchitect","Apr 29, 2008"

The smell is heavy with malts, bock-y and sweet, a little phenols from the yeast give a hint of banana. The smell isn't really as fruity as I'd like, but then again I always rate weizenbocks against the unfortunately incomparable Aventinus. The taste is a little oppressive in its strength, it's a little bitter and alcoholic. More malty than anything, again not enough banana/clove or bubblegum.

Reddish/orange hues shine through when the beer is held up to natural light. The aroma is a sort of a smoky banana scent, with some dense vanilla extract smells as well. I also get a slight burnt coffee sensation in the nose, which counters the sweet banana-ness nicely. Some clovey, pepper spices too. It tastes nice, bittersweet like a good weizenbock, but it just doesn't anything sexy about it. Nothing really jumps out and grabs my attention. It's a smooth, steady brew, with some nice features, but nothing spectacular. Mouthfeel is smooth and solid, but thin at times, and almost watery in the finish.

It has a crystal malt sweetness with a dry, fruity finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a pretty good beer.

4.05,3.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Another nice find on tap at the Blind Tiger. Poured a hazy/murky shade of dark plummy brown with a soft puffy head, that showed moderate retentive powers. Sticky and fine lacing left on the glass. The nose was strongly fruity with a wiff of sourness and alcohol . This is a slightly sour, mellow, yeasty and musty concoction. Lots of complex fruit, spice and yeasty notes floating around. Interesting, sophisticated, old world brew. If you like a complex, strong German style Wiesse Bock, this one is well worth a try. I'd like to try a fresh bottle for a comparison.","Billolick","May 21, 2005"

Juniper, sugar syruo, clover and juicy malt on nose. Awfully jumpy but a fine base malt that is thinned a little by a sweet grassy presence and a light treacle. Cooling, comforting pour with a lemony aspect which makes me think this would actually be a pleasant summer brew.","Truh","Mar 17, 2005"
4.23,8.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Sampled from 16.9 oz bottle, the bottling date on the back is smeared out. Der Weisse Bock pours a hazy, dark brown color. Head is tall and thick. The aroma is of rich, dark European bread with a distinct banana smell. This is very strong and inviting. Taste is complex. Banana and clove notes are joined by big bready malts. Flavors are noted on multiple levels. Finish is sweet and slightly nutty. A mild alcohol taste is also noted. This is great stuff, and is sadly from another great brewery that we're missing out on in Houston.","Gagnonsux","Mar 04, 2005"
3.93,0.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a standard brown color with a very tall head that subsides quickly but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has some chocolate as well as some dark fruit. The flavor has characters from the chocolate and the slight fruit, but also has a nice dose of wheat malt. Mouthfeel is slightly thin and the drinkability was nice. The wheat gives it a nice creaminess.","clvand0","Dec 09, 2004"
4.17,6.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this beer. The beer pours a strait up brown color with 3 fingers of head that falls to a finger over the beer. The nose is really about the bock in this one. There are hints of cherries and figs, and just full on bock nose. The flavor is pretty much a marriage between a bock and a wheat. The wheat mellows down the flavors of the bock, rendering it just a bit smaller in flavor. This is a nice beer overall. Better than the victory beer in the same style. The feel is smooth and creamy and a bit velvety. A nice drink. Drinkability is not bad either. This is a drinkable beer. I would have it again.","kmpitz2","Nov 24, 2004"
4.03,3.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a reddish tan color with a stiff white head on top. The aroma is sweet and malty with a touch of raisins. The flavors follow the lead of the aroma with a sweet wheat bread maltiness along with notes of lavendar and cinnamon. These spices are not potent or up front, but more subtle in the back of the flavor. It has a clean and crisp flavor and a medium body.","BrewMaster","Nov 17, 2004"

4.34,11.3,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Only my second Weizenbock after Aventinus and that's tough competition. Pours with a nice thick head that dissipates pretty quickly. A rich mahogany/cherry colour that seems pretty impervious to light. Smell is out of this world; a rich raisiny banana. Taste is a little different to the nose however, still raisiny but I'm not getting the banana anymore; especially surprising due to the amount of reviews here that claim it's like liquid banana bread. I do, however, detect faint molasses and that strong raisin character coming through. Starts sweet, finishes dry with a semi-sweet chocolate flavour. Basically a delicious brew. I'd recommend this though, especially to anyone who is a fan of Weizenbocks or even Dubbels.","Ardon","Jul 17, 2004"

Good weizenbock flavor; banana and clove with a nice roasted wheat malt sweetness... almost syrupy with a subtle tartness. I was a little worried cause this on had been in the fridge for a while, but I'm not picking up on anything off. Solid weizenbock, which is one of my cherished German styles of beer.

3.91,0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"...BANG-O, what ballsy carbonation this has. It's like a bock/seltzer blend. The taste, once you get beyond the tongue-seering bubbles, is predominately sweet bock, but the wheat really comes out in the aftertaste and is almost metallic in nature. If nothing else, it gets points for being unique. I don't know if I'm going to come back to this one too often, but my mind is frantically searching for the perfect food pairing, because something as bold as this must have a soul mate.","86MonteSS","Apr 30, 2004"

The aroma is fruit, wheat, malt, and restrained alcohol. The main fruit aroma is raisin with caramel. The flavor is slightly sour caramel and raisins with a sour lingering dryness. There is some wheat in the flavor, but you end with the dryness and alcohol. The alcoholic warming tells you that the drinkability is just not there.","GCBrewingCo","Nov 16, 2003"

3.11,-20.3,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Turbid chestnut brown in hue and covered by a uniformly thick, seemingly static tan one fingered head. Ripe, sweet banana esters and mellow notes of clove phenol. Phenols take on an odd, napthalene like nature as the brew warms, but remain mild. Hint of spicy alcohol and bubblegum. Surprising note of mint chocolate in aroma. Banana laced sweetness upfront in flavor is ceded by grainy wheat tartness and mild notes of dry, powered baker's chocolate. Sweetness quickly resumes, but this time of a generic dark caramel nature. Subdued hint of raisins and chocolate emerge late. Moderately bodied, but just a touch thin in mouthfeel, lacking both the proteinaceous quality contributed by wheat and the creamy dextrins of a bock. Finishes lightly sweet and bready, but clean otherwise. An understated and tame example of the style, but flavorful enough to keep the palate interested. Tasty, but seemingly simplified in character.","marc77","Jan 09, 2003"

Less hazy than expected, but there are some larger particles in suspension suggesting the yeast cake had been quite compacted - probably an old bottle. The aroma is limited with some caramel-like maltiness and a bit of a bready character. There are some very light notes of brown sugar and citrus, matbe some spice. The body is somewhat thin but the high carbonation level compensates in the mouthfeel. The flavor is restrained with a lighty sweet malt character. Very basic, no real fermentation characteristics seem to come through. Gently balanced hop bitterness finishes slightly dry. Although this beer is from Bamberg it doesn't seem to display the characteristics normally associated with the region. This may just be an old bottle that's lost some of its complexity.","NeroFiddled","Jul 27, 2002"
