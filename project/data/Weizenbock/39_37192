Nose is wheat brought to richness.  Toasty bread crust and a bit of clove.  Light banana and a creamy but crisp wheat flavor.  Slight warming in the finish.  Finishes with just a touch of  hops  for balance and so that the malt can reside splendidly in the after taste with some dark fruits and bread crust.","utopiajane","Mar 08, 2015"

I've tried a fair few now but I think this is quite possibly my favorite. Aventinus is another great one but it doesn't have the same refreshing quality. Vitus is great also but not as cloudy and substantial. I should add that I had this beer after a long day working outside. My thirst and desire for a cold refreshing beverage may have something to do with my decision to award this brew a near perfect 5.","Markle369","0"

Pours very hazy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big banana, orange peel, pear, apple, bubblegum, white grape, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and balanced malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big banana, orange peel, pear, apple, bubblegum, wheat, bread, light honey, light clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of banana, pear, apple, orange peel, bubblegum, wheat, bread, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome weizenbock. All around great complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast ester and balanced malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

In traditional weizenbock fashion, this beer sneaks up on you. Since it tastes so simple- much like what you would find in a hefeweizen, but a bit sweeter- it lulls you into a false sense of security. Only after this point do you start feeling the alcohol a bit. Fantastic beer. Very, very different from Aventinus, another popular weizenbock. Looking forward to comparing it to Weihenstephaner Vitus soon.","Beric","Mar 20, 2014"

I've only been able to find one other German Weizenbock stateside, which was brewed by Schneider & Son (the makers of the Aventinus). This beer carries the Ayinger quality. The taste is incredibly well balanced, combining the bittersweet wheat flavors with the bubblegum and malt flavors effortlessly. It pours a murky amber and smells like most Weizen beers would. This beer is a good spring or summer beer and I'd recommend it to any lover of wheat beers.","jmendels","0"

Nose had a fruitiness like Juicy Fruit gum and I was becoming intrigued. I do not remember the last time I drank a Weizenbock, but Ayinger is always a solid choice. Mouthfeel was medium and the fruity sweetness made for an easy drink. Too easy as I was through over half the glass before I realized it. At that rate, I will be as drunk as the goat who is toasting me from the label. The finish was sweet, but not cloying and as it warmed, I began to get some alcohol heat coming through. In fact, as it warmed, the mouthfeel became fuller, not creamy, but big and full on the tongue.

4.15,-1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a fine example of a traditional German Weixenbock, it pretty much had all the nice features that I look for in this style and they all come together nicely. This beer had really good drinkability, it went down really smooth, was refreshing, and flavors held my attention, I drank this faster then I thought and I think two or three of these on a hot summer afternoon would be perfect. What I liked most about this beer was how drinkable it was and how great the mouthfeel was, they were both better then I was expecting. What I liked least about this beer was the price, it's a little on the steep side, if this brew was a little cheaper it would stay in my fridge all summer. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good and very drinkable Weizenbock, I highly recommend giving this beer a try. Ayinger has proved to be one solid brewery, all the beers I have had from them have been nothing less then good and it seems like they have the traditional German Styles dialed in. While Heavy Seas Hang Ten is still the best one I have reviewed, I would say that this one is slightly better then Vitus and it now takes the place as my favorite German Weixenbock, good job guys, keep shipping your great beer to the USA, and I'll keep drinking it.","StoutHunter","Jun 01, 2012"

The classic wheat malt crispness shines through. Mouthfeel is soft and full with a nice sparkle from the carbonation. Drinkability is almost TOO good for a beer with that packs a 7.1% abv punch.

Taste is insanely creamy and full of bananas, butterscotch and natural fruity yeast flavors. Touch of sweetness towards the end of the sip, with just a tad bit of bitterness and alcohol presence to round the brew out nicely.

Bready malt comes through as well, but I'd like some more malt character. On the palate, the body is noticeably heavier and wheatier than a typical hefeweizen. Alcohol heat is kept to a minimum. Carbonation is a little low, failing to liven up such a hefty wheat beer.

Rich and full mouthfeel of German goodiness. If I had to pick one beer that I've ever had that screamed "GERMANY!" to me, this is it. It's one of the most drinkable 7% brews I've ever had and I could see myself, and probably any beer lover, getting stupid drunk off this very quickly.

It has a bit of an apple-cinnamon character, along with the banana notes you would expect from a hefeweizen yeast. The body is medium, bordering on full, and the sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a few ounces, as this really doesn't dry up in the finish at all. Banana bread flavors linger on the tongue between sips. Spicy phenols become more prevalent as the beer warms, which doesn't enhance the drinkability much. A fairly good beer, but not great.

Mildly stinky with plenty of other flavors to go around, especially bread, honey and a little brown sugar, this beer is rather intriguing on the palate. Just a touch of smoke is present as well, this is seriously off the wall. Moderately sweet on the finish with the spices coming in, especially clove and a little cinnamon, this medium bodied beer has a moderate level of carbonation with a lingering finish with honey, a little smoke and some spice.

A great smoothness and balance is in this lighter weizenbock, with a citric and clove taste along with some residual wheat sweetness combo w/ some type of candi sugar-esque sweet malt for a light to medium body beer that has a sweet touch along with a distinct sharp hefe taste and it finishes slightly nutty and dry.

As the head slowly receded, it revealed a hazy orange-gold body. Some strands of lacing, but no legs - only a few residual spots. Nose is dominated by bananas and cloves with a hint of wheat. Taste is somewhat of a let down considering what the nose put off - a mere shadow of the nose and a bit watery, with a a strange aftertaste (maybe a little plasticy). Mouthfeel is light-bodied and starts off flat, but as I finish the bottle pour it becomes a bit more crisp. Better than I initially anticipated, but not quite where I expected it to be overall.

Taste has a whole array of fruit such as banana, pear and apple again, peaches...also it has a great bread like base, and even some powdered sugar qualities.

4.2,0.2,4,4,4,4,5,"This beer threw me off because i thought it would be like a dark wheat. It is really just a strong wheat beer. The beer is very good and has a very nice taste. It's flavor has a mix between banana, clove, and zest with a sweetness and bitterness that blend together nicely at the end. It is very cloudy and golden with a white head. It smells like banana laffy taffy with some spice. It is very drinkable and it has a nice thick mouthfeel. The only thing that is bad about this beer is that it costs $4.50 for a single 500ml bottle. Very good though.","huricrane47","Dec 02, 2009"

Carbonation is mild to moderate. The aroma is of green bananas, light cloves, pale malts. Mouthfeel is soft, lightly tart, clean, with a big wheat aftertaste and mild residual sweetness. Taste opens with green bananas and green apples, followed by a very mild bitterness, with a decent malt body bigger than your average hefe weizen. Cleanly fermented with no off flavors. About as typical as you can get for a weizen bock. A great example of the style. Recommended.","Mitchster","Nov 21, 2009"

While I like this beer I think I prefer my wezienbocks a bit darker, and with a more complex character (e.g., Aventinus and Moonglow). Nonetheless this is a fine beer and a treat to drink.

The aroma is of wheat malt, some metal, banana, clove, lemon and tart apples. The taste is of clove, bananas, bubble gum, a hint of berry fruitiness. The malt takes a slap to the wheat edge and makes it sit down. As it warms there is a light lemon edge. Nice concentrated hefe flavors. Solid moderate feel, tingly carbonation, sits well and finishes awesomely terrific (a touch sweet). Very smooth feel, velvty. A very fantastic brew, a hefe on 'roids.

4.62,10.3,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours a very cloudy orange into my weizen glass. With hard pour it takes three tries to fill up the glass with a nice white head that doesn't hang around too long. The aroma is what I expect from a well built wheat beer, with aromas of bready bananas and spice. The flavor reflects the smell. Banana, clove, but a bit hot from the alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is rather light for a beer that is 7.1% alcohol, I wasn't expecting it and wouldn't be able to pick it out if you didn't tell me. This is a very drinkable beer, that I will go back to on occasion. Brau-Weisse is my #1 beer and this certainly reflects a stronger version of that classic. Overall, solid weizen-bock.","bigreduw64","Nov 02, 2009"

3.92,-6.4,4,4.5,4,4,3,"500mL. Poured a cloudy and opaque deep yellow color with a nice tall white head. Retention was decent, but left no lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet and full of wheat, banana, clove, and yeast with some scents of grainy maltiness as well. Tastes are very similar to the aromas (banana, clove, wheat), but also has some vanilla notes and is rather sweet on the palate, especially on the finish. Alcohol is faint, but noticeable - seems more estery, but doesn't seem to reveal any sort of fruity notes that I guess I expected like others in this style category. Mouth-feel is medium bodied while being creamy and smooth. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this offering. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but I would tend to lean towards others in this style if given the choice. This one seemed a little too weisse-y and a little too sweet for my liking.","barnzy78","Oct 26, 2009"

Pouring the yeast in gives it a soupy weizenbock opacity. Clove in the nose, with the standard Ayinger hefe yeast. A little phenolic with a trace of banana. Flavor is lightly sweet and bready, more clove spice than banana in this one. Leaning more towards hefe than a supercharged weizenbock like Aventinus. Still it's very clean and refreshing.

Then the banana kicks in...this is really good! Malty sweetness is there, but very moderate. To me, it was everything good about a weizen, just more of it. Also has a richer feel than a regular weizen. It's really hard to believe this has a 7.1%ABV...drinkability is scary. This stuff is fantastic.","alkemy","Oct 08, 2009"
