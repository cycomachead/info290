"Poured a cloudy golden body with large head and some lace that stuck around and has an aroma that is citric and spice with faint yeast/orange twang. Beer is smooth, easy to drink, the yeast is there and adds a touch of sweetness and fluff in the beer, also get hints of tropical fruits but mostly a citric, hoppy body mixed with spice (to bastardize as done before - imagine your typical wheat beer with extra hops). Pretty good and had on a hot summer day and it hit the spot."

"O: I can see why some people would really like this beer as it is a melange of different flavors, but they don't fit together well for me with too much yeast character and a strange interplay between the estery nature of the beer and the citrusy and floral American hopping."

"Overall: Awesome beer, not sure if it follows the style as it comes off more as some sort of hoppy american wheat ale. We stopped at multiple breweries on the brew ridge trail and this is the one beer that blew me away. It sucked when I went inside the brew house to buy some bottles to find out they only have it on draft. If you like A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale or the wild version you will love this."

"A good straight forward version."

"D-Really nice...I always like a beer that has a lot of flavours working together and this one has it. A bit of a burly kid though at almost 8%...but it's well hidden and isn't noticed at all. Well done ""experimental beer"" as the brewery notes call it."
"Drinkability: Blue Mountain's best beer yet, in my opinion - the nearly 8% abv doesn't even make an appearance. The melding of the American hops and the German yeast notes is fantastic, the beer is gorgeous - this is really just an impressive, impressive beer."
