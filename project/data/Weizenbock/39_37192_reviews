"Pours golden with an orange blush.  Hazy with a frothy foamy head of creamy white foam that lasted.  Matte appearance, no shine or glow to this beer.  Nose is wheat brought to richness.  Toasty bread crust and a bit of clove.  Light banana and a creamy but crisp wheat flavor.  Slight warming in the finish.  Finishes with just a touch of  hops  for balance and so that the malt can reside splendidly in the after taste with some dark fruits and bread crust."

"Solid take on the style. Plenty of sweet fruity esters to go around. Highly drinkable and the ABV is barely noticeable. A must try for fans of the Weizenbock. Well done Ayinger..."

"One of the best I've had in the style!"

"This beer was trash baud"
""
""
""
""
"Swirling the last 1/4 of the bottle to rouse the yeast created a super cloudy appearance and made it even spicier. A solid Weizenbock that would make for a nice treat once in a while but not something I'm grabbing for everyday."

"Medium full body, medium high carbonation, very fine and soft, creamy."
"O:  really good and a great way to get a bit more ABV out of hefeweizen ... honestly, the only thing different from standard hefe here is the extra 1-3% ABV and that Belgian witbier spice ... other than that, it's good banana hefeweizen"
"Overall, just a wonderful brew."
""
""
"Cloudy, golden appearance with two fingers of fluffy white head. Aroma is huge bananas and cloves, with I slight hint of bubblegum. Taste is bananas, cloves and just a minor bit of citrus tartness. Mouthfeel is just outstanding, fairly light bodied with perfect carbonation that complements the flavor. This beer is comparable to Vitus and Unser Aventinus in every way- simply wonderful"
""
""
"Overall a nice Weizenbock but there are a few better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent pale Weizenbock. Don't pass this up if you even remotely enjoy wheat beers."
""
""
""
"This is a strong offering from one of my preferred Bavarian breweries, very easy to drink with a higher abv (which could prove to be dangerous). Prost!"

"This beer was a surprisingly delightful experience. I poured the cloudy, lively-colored brew into a glass and was converted into a weizen-bock fanatic instantly. I've tried a fair few now but I think this is quite possibly my favorite. Aventinus is another great one but it doesn't have the same refreshing quality. Vitus is great also but not as cloudy and substantial. I should add that I had this beer after a long day working outside. My thirst and desire for a cold refreshing beverage may have something to do with my decision to award this brew a near perfect 5."

"Overall, I really like this one."

"An easy drinking non-aggressive beer. Pleasant and relaxing but, IMHO, overpriced."
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours hazy gold with a large, creamy white head, good retention with good lacing. Aroma is huge banana esters with caramel and vanilla nose, light bread and biscuit malt. Light noble hops and a warm alcohol character as it warms. Flavor is lightly sweet with bready and slightly buttery notes. A light hop bitterness. Banana esters and a dry finish. Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation."
""
"Rich malty head on the pour. Scents of lemon, raspberry, and dried cloves. Cloudy strawberry color. Lots of lacing down the glass. Fruity tartness on the palate. Low carbonation and low hops, as a great bock should. Easy to drink. Hard to put down. Not a session beer, even though I'd love it to be one. It can be quaffed until you are oblivious. Love this one!"

"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, no bottle dating. Pours very hazy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big banana, orange peel, pear, apple, bubblegum, white grape, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and balanced malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big banana, orange peel, pear, apple, bubblegum, wheat, bread, light honey, light clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of banana, pear, apple, orange peel, bubblegum, wheat, bread, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome weizenbock. All around great complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast ester and balanced malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"A wonderful brew. While it is not my favorite in the style, (Schneider Weisse Tap 6 is), but it is still a substantial and tasty bigger brother of the hefeweizen."
""
"Overall: If there is such a thing as an imperial hefeweizen, this is it. All the notes of a traditional hefeweizen are emphasized and made bigger in this brew. In traditional weizenbock fashion, this beer sneaks up on you. Since it tastes so simple- much like what you would find in a hefeweizen, but a bit sweeter- it lulls you into a false sense of security. Only after this point do you start feeling the alcohol a bit. Fantastic beer. Very, very different from Aventinus, another popular weizenbock. Looking forward to comparing it to Weihenstephaner Vitus soon."

"There is NO BITTER taste. I'm one of those people who hates bitter (hoppy) beers. I just can't understand why people pretend to like those beers, haha. The human body has evolved to dislike bitter things, hence why we hardly eat anything that is bitter (fact). This beer is on the opposite spectrum of the beer world. This is a malty beer so have no fear people with tastebuds, this actually tastes pleasant! You don't have to pretend to like this, you just will. :)"

"O - Though shockingly lighter than most weizenbock beers, Ayinger Weizenbock features all the same characteristics and blends them fabulously! Spice forward, this beer has yeast incorporated through every aspect of it from the aroma and flavor to finish. Creamy smooth, it's like fresh, moist banana bread, without any nuts, filling the stomach providing sustenance."
""
""
""
"Overall, I really love this beer! There is a real richness from the aroma and flavor along with very well-hidden alcohol. One to work into the regular rotation."
""
"Pours a cloudy copper color with a large foamy head. Aroma of bananas, fruity sweetness, spice and yeast. Taste follows with banana, clove, fruity sweetness and spices. Mild bitterness and the finish is a bit sticky. medium body, smooth and flavorful. A well balanced beer with no hint of the 7.1% ABV. Enjoyable beer from a quality German brewery."
"Pours a little cloudy yellow with rockin white head. Smells of bubblegum with supportive banana and a touch of clove. Tastes of sweet cotton candy with doughy wheat undertones. Mostly sweet tasting with medium fullness. Pairs excellent with a Weeping Radish brat, homemade sauerkraut and some self-made potatoe fries from a skillet. Easily drinkable and great treat for the colder temps. Floral hop aroma. Alcohol seems mostly nonexistent. Perfect liquid candy treat."

"Ayinger's doppelbock gets the lion's share of the attention from this brewery but this stuff is easily as good for its style. I would think that this one would be an even better crowd pleaser. This is one of those beers that, when confronted with someone who says ""I don't like beer"" I would have him/her try. Well balanced and easy to drink, I'd have to have a pretty specific beer craving in order to not want to drink this beer."
""
""
""
""
"The Ayinger weizenbock poured an opaque straw color with plenty of head. The bubble gum and clove nose was immediately apparent and the first taste was heavy on the signature hefeweisen flavors. It had a wonderfully smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I love a good weizen-bock and the Ayinger version was heavy on those classic hefeweisen flavors and just plain excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very solid. clean and refreshing with more grain than other weizenbocks. not quite as well integrated as Vitus or some others."
""
""
"Overall: what a great beer. I was kind of worried about this one; the last few beers I've had along these lines were not so impressive. But here we have a clean, tasty and aromatic delight. Wonderful!"

"O-delicious summer beer for a hot day, great flavors"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very flavorful hefe/weizenbock. There is a lot of sweetness throughout, but not overly so. The huge banana and clove notes really make this beer shine."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer that is easy to drink. I would love to try this one fresh, given how good it is as an import. It's the type of beer where you have to hunt for any negatives, because they are not readily apparent. Even after hunting, there are precious few to focus on."
""
""
""
"Overall-More of a hefeweizen with attitude than a bock but easy to drink and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw color with a decent white head that persists forever. Smells of pepper and clove with hints of lemon honey and light sugar. The flavor is rich and malty with lots of yeasty phenols that get in the way of me enjoying this beer. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. I did not enjoy this beer at all."
"O: Yet another fantastic beer from Brauerei Aying. This must be one of the best breweries in the entire world! If you find a beer from Aying that you havn't sampled - be advised - try it, you'll like it!"
"O: C,pled and balanced with flavors that work very nicely together."
"This is impeccable."
"This is a fantastic beer. It's a concentrated burst of sweet Bavarian wheat beer flavor. Pale weizenbocks seem to be a delicate thing and have a tendency to stray into boozy territory, but Aying is clearly too good of a brewery to go down that road. This is a very likable beer, and it's hard not to smile with each sip."
"Overall this is more wheat beer than Bock. It is light and easy to drink. It would be good on a hot summer day."
"This is so good. It tastes pretty much the same as it smells, but somehow even better. With each swish in your mouth you find tiny explosions of orange, then some other fruit, then banana, all having a bit of spice to it. The drink feels excellent in your mouth. Only positive things can be said of this delicious brew. I will definitely get this again. Once again, I love the new design on the label."
"Overall: This is a damn good beer. A very easy drinker as well, and at 7.1% ABV, a couple of these could really do you in on a hot summer day if you don't watch it!"
"O - This beer tastes old, tired, musty, stale and overall an unappetizing weizenbock which is a shame because this a beer style that should shine from Bavaria. Could it be an old bottle? It's possible yet I don't think it would have been this detrimental to it's flavor and aroma. Aventinus is leaps and bounds better, as is the Americanized version from Victory, Moon Glow, which is pretty damn amazing."
""
"I've never known Ayinger to make a beer that wasn't enjoyable. This one is no exception. I've only been able to find one other German Weizenbock stateside, which was brewed by Schneider & Son (the makers of the Aventinus). This beer carries the Ayinger quality. The taste is incredibly well balanced, combining the bittersweet wheat flavors with the bubblegum and malt flavors effortlessly. It pours a murky amber and smells like most Weizen beers would. This beer is a good spring or summer beer and I'd recommend it to any lover of wheat beers."
""
"Not my favorite of the Weizenbocks I've had (I prefer less ``weizen'' and more ``bock''), but still an awfully nice beer. Perfect on a Sunday afternoon while relaxing or taking a break from yardwork."
""
""
"O- not as malty as the others on the market, but that makes it sort of interesting. not one of ayingers better brews, but still a respectable effort."
""
""
""
" Edit: As it warmed a lot more emerged, like a little toffee and a hint of heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Rich wheat and banana with a big bready malt backbone. The carbonation holds up the flavors perfectly. I freaking love Ayinger."
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't feel like this was as amazing as their regular hefe, I guess I'm partial to the darker weizenbocks. This still disappeared quite fast."
""
"O - a very very good weizenbock. I tend to enjoy the helles(light) weizenbocks more than the dunkels(darker) offerings. Probably the 2nd best weizenbock I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Its a great style and Aying did it right. There should never be a discussion about the best of Germany without Brauerei Aying being mentioned. They just deliver world class German ales on a regular basis. I say this is a must try if you like German wheat beers. I could enjoy something like this any time of the year."
""
"Overall this is not my favorite style of beer, but when comparing to its style it is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy dark amber with a moderate head. Huge pleasant aroma of banana, pear, cloves and peaches. Taste is sweet, fruity and delicious, similar to the Ayinger Ur-Weisse multiplied by 2. Thankfully all of the Ayinger beers are easy to find in the area for which I am extremely grateful. For me they are the gold standard of Bavarian beers although I have never travelled abroad. I have consumed several cases of the weizenbock and ur-weisse and have never been disappointed, regardless of what I am eating, drinking or feeling. They are truly miraculous in this respect, always enjoyable."
""
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was expecting something a little darker and heaver, but this is so drinkable and smooth I'm not complaining."

"I initially had just over a finger of french vanilla-colored head, but it quickly fell to mere wisps. Color was a cloudy yellowish-orange. Nose had a fruitiness like Juicy Fruit gum and I was becoming intrigued. I do not remember the last time I drank a Weizenbock, but Ayinger is always a solid choice. Mouthfeel was medium and the fruity sweetness made for an easy drink. Too easy as I was through over half the glass before I realized it. At that rate, I will be as drunk as the goat who is toasting me from the label. The finish was sweet, but not cloying and as it warmed, I began to get some alcohol heat coming through. In fact, as it warmed, the mouthfeel became fuller, not creamy, but big and full on the tongue. Note to self (and others) - allow this to warm slightly before consuming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer, not the best of the style though."
""
"To me, this comes across (tastes) like a curious hybrid of the hefeweizen and weizenbock styles. Fringe - - doesn't have what I envision as the classic weizenbock flavor - but quite tasty all the same. Stupid-easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: I was quite disappointed with this. Still, not a bad brew."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink even though there is a relatively high ABV because it is very well hidden. Very tasty and very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another fine offering from Ayinger. An outstanding beer that satisfies. I could drink several at a time and be a happy person."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale golden with a slight glow to it, and a head that is pure white and fades somewhat quickly to a thin ring. Honeyed aromas are very pleasant and set the stage for the even more appealing taste. Nice notes of honey, bananas, stone fruit, and a just a touch of spice, with some breadiness on the finish. Slightly sweet, but wholly appropriate for the style. Very smooth, and just a pleasure all around."
""
"Very nice and refreshing. Tastes a lot lighter than it is. Definitely another winner from Ayinger."
"A great example of quality beer."
"O - May not be the most complex beer I have ever tasted, but this is a good beer. I would be happy to buy again at $3/bottle."
"Bursting with tons of flavor. Bready, cloves, banana, bubble gum, orange spice, peppery, caramel. Crisp smooth finish. Full bodied, milk shake texture, soft carbonation."
""
"O - Like a big brother to a hefeweizen. This beer stayed clear of any caramely/roasted malts like you are likely to find in a dunkel. Modest on alcohol. Very drinkable (deceiving)."
"phase 1 complete, phase 2 on the pour..."
"Overall - Fairly similar to their other wheat brews, particularly the dunkelweizen, though this one's a bit sweeter. Hard to believe this has about the same ABV as Arrogant Bastard; virtually no trace of alcohol in this well executed brew."
"Not especially complex but it is insanely refreshing and easy drinking. Well crafted and hides the 7.1% extremely well. Very nice."
"O- Very tasty and very easy to drink. Almost cider like. Definitely will pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, it just doesn't get better than this. Deep, complex, and refreshing? How so. Never seen this one available to me before. So very glad I grabbed one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A fantastic example of the style that is well worth grabbing. A delicious full flavored weizenbock, super yummy and so glad I was able to take it for a spin. Thanks Joe!!"
"Possibly the yeastiest beer I have ever had, an amped up sweet hefeweizen. Very good beer and definitely something I'd have again."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a deep golden orange and very hazy. It had tons and tons of head that dissipated very slowly with no lacing. The nose was banana, citrus peel, and more alcohol than I would have expected. Af first, the flavor was very banana, fruity, almost sour. I let it breathe a little and it mellowed to a delicious banana and yeasty bread. Let it breathe for sure. Big mouthfeel with avg carbonation. Tasty and smooth. Give it time to open up and it's great."
"Overall, a delicious, easy-to-drink beer. I cannot believe this thing has 7% ABV ..."
"O: A little different from what I expect from a weizenbock, but tasty. Nothing mind blowing, just good solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a fine example of a traditional German Weixenbock, it pretty much had all the nice features that I look for in this style and they all come together nicely. This beer had really good drinkability, it went down really smooth, was refreshing, and flavors held my attention, I drank this faster then I thought and I think two or three of these on a hot summer afternoon would be perfect. What I liked most about this beer was how drinkable it was and how great the mouthfeel was, they were both better then I was expecting. What I liked least about this beer was the price, it's a little on the steep side, if this brew was a little cheaper it would stay in my fridge all summer. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good and very drinkable Weizenbock, I highly recommend giving this beer a try. Ayinger has proved to be one solid brewery, all the beers I have had from them have been nothing less then good and it seems like they have the traditional German Styles dialed in. While Heavy Seas Hang Ten is still the best one I have reviewed, I would say that this one is slightly better then Vitus and it now takes the place as my favorite German Weixenbock, good job guys, keep shipping your great beer to the USA, and I'll keep drinking it."
"overall: solid stuff"
""
"I know it's an Ayinger product but damn. This was super tasty. I'm going to say better than Vitus, but continues to confirm my opinion that Aventinus is the best Weizenbock."
""
""
""
"Overall: Another nice beer from Ayinger and while the malty bock character is appropriate to this example, it is not my favorite element in the world of weizens"
"Awesome beer! Ayinger makes a lot of 'em. An incredible weizenbock. 4.5"
"A cloudy brown amber on the pour with a large lasting white head. Aroma of sweet malt, yeast, banana and fruity esters. Taste is sweet malt, banana, fruity, yeast, wheat, with some sweet tart notes. A medium body with soft carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast, some banana and fruity flavors, wheat, ending has some light bitterness for balance. Overall a very good, tasty and flavorful brew. A solid all around ale."
"O - Very tasty beer. A bit of a meal in a glass, but nothing wrong with that. A bit more weizen than bock, but very tasty."
"Overall / Drinkability: I wonder how this beer would have been had I given it a more careful pour and left all the sediment in. Still, a good combination of a hefeweizen and a bock beer. Quite drinkable - I would not mind cracking open another bottle and continue to savor this beer."
"It smells like it should, and it is obvious this is a European product, but once is enough for me. Try it if you want to do a unique wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an amped up hefeweizen rather than a Weizenbock. I would expect some deep, toasted malt flavors and melanoidins to accompany the hefeweizen profile. Still a well made and tasty beer."
"Pours a murky honey gold with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy chunks of lace slowly slide down the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, yeast, spices, and some pepper-like aromas. There is a slight fruity note that I am getting more as the beer warms as well. Taste is quite sweet and is of wheat, banana, yeast, and some very nice spice flavors in the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a lightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is very drinkable and very tasty."
""
"O- Perfect beer for a warm spring night. Tons of fruity banana and spice, excellent carbonation! I'd like to try this with a 1/4 shot of spiced rum!"
""
"(This is my first real written review using ASTMO, so the descriptions and words are not flowing from me yet!)"
""
""
""
""
"O - a very tasty and easy drinking offering that echos the virtues of the German purity law, a must try"
"A wheat bock ale with a fluffy head, light bodied, and tastes as good as it looks. Sit back, relax, and indulge on a smooth fruity splash of malts. A bit of frothy carbonation, a tang of yeast, and what most like to say—banana sweetness. Excellent beer to sip and enjoy, and probably the best Wheat Bocks that I’ve ever laid my palate to."
"Overall not too bad, refreshing, a little soda pop like though for my tastes."
""
""
"O- Up there with the best wheat beers ive ever tasted, this is a special beer that everyone should enjoy."
"Cheers"
""
""
"A very fine beer. To me it stayed more true to a Hefeweizen flavor with just added sweetness, whilst other examples of Weizenbock I've tried were a bit different. Recommended."
""
"O: Though meant for winter, this beer is not too heavy. It is worth sipping though. It has lots of great fruit and spice flavor that is balanced very well."
""
""
"Very solid, very classic beer. Pours a pale golden/orange color with a nice bit of foamy head. A bit of yeast stayed behind in the bottle. Smelled of citrus and banana, very appealing. Excellent crisp taste, a lot of the same notes from the aroma come through in the beer with a bit of sweetness as well. Nice crisp finish that makes you want to go back for more."
""
"Pours a pale orange with a two-finger, long lasting cloudy white head. Aroma of yeast, spices, banana and orange peel. Very balanced and tasty flavor. Starts with strong orange peel notes as well with some clove, wheat and spicy yeast flavors in the background. Nice sweet banana flavor is next which transitions nicely into the sweeter flavors of the beer. Sweet sticky bread and caramel malt (to a lesser extent) mesh perfectly with the banana notes to close this one out. Lingers very nicely well after the finish. Classic German flavors."
""
""
"O: Very smooth and drinkable. Ayinger quality, IMHO, one of the best german breweries"
""
"A great beer, I'm beginning to find I have quite a fondness for weizenbocks, and this is another good one."
"A delicious weizenbock. Not really that unexpected from ayinger as this is yet another excellent offering from them"
"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a tulip, unknown freshness date. This pours a very hazy golden color with a massive white head. The smells are good, wheat, Belgian yeast esters, banana and other fruit. The feel is medium to light high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, wheat, very light hops, some sweetness, overall a pretty tasty beer."
""
"Tastes like it smells, only the wheat's a bit sweeter than the bock. Nice blend, though. White pepper moves into banana esters and then the back end in a delicious blend of chewy yeast and tangy bock malt."
""
""
""
"O: My only complaint is that the sweetness wears on me a tad as I progress through the beer. Otherwise, it strikes me as a unique twist on the classic hefe, and along with its stupid drinkablilty factor, makes it one that's well worth diving into."
"Overall, solid brew & quite a tasty Weizenbock. I am not a huge fan of the style, but this is the best offering I have had to date."
""
"Smooth, lightly creamy. A great beer, one to sit and enjoy one a winter night."
"Well, this is a pretty quintessential weizenbock and a must-try for any Aventinus drinkers out there. Happened to get this on a pretty big sale ($3?), making it as cheap or cheaper than Weihenstephaner's ,5L bottles. In the style, value for money still probably goes to Victory Moonglow, but likely because they're domestic. It's getting a high rating, but I just can't fault it."
""
"This is one amazing wheat, complex, delicious, wonderfull."
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation is fairly prickly and the mouthfeel on the week side. Overall it just doesn't do much for me."
""
""
""
"O- fantastic beer and another winner from ayinger. 7.1% hides very well in this beer making it very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Love it. It's my reach to beer even with the 7.1ABV. I think the sticky sweetness would prevent me from having more than 2 at a time. Someone said it's a Hefe Weizen on steroids and I have to agree."
""
""
"a hefe on steroids and just perfect for this chilly evening, the price is right and this may be in my regular line up for a couple months"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nicely crafted beer. I've had some bad weizenbocks in the past that have not been that good. Most are darker. I like the light and refreshing quality of this beer. It's almost like an Imperial Hefe. Very nice."
"O-Not bad. More clovey than I prefer my weizenbocks but a solid version of the style."
""
"Very drinkable."
""
"O -- As a Weizenbock -- it doesn't compete with Aventinus in complexity and character. Just seems a little lacking, yet a terrific Weizen for anyone to try."
"One of the top-tier examples of the style, though it lacks some punch/depth/intensity compared to Aventinus or maybe even Vitus (the latter having a somewhat similar flavor profile)."
"One of the most sensational beers I have ever tried. I certainly do have a fondness for heffeweizens, tripels, etc so I am making that my disclaimer here before my review. I could literally drink this beer forever and not get tired of it. Smells like delicious wheat, banana, hint of clove and citrus, all perfectly balanced. Nice solid 2 finger head that dissipates within 2 minutes. very nice white head with a hint of yellow around the edges. Tastes delicious, full thick wheaty taste, with lots of banana and smooth as a baby's bottom. clean and crisp from start to finish, no hint of alcohol, no burn or heat emanating at any point during a sip. Enough complexity to keep me coming back, and as my amateur palate develops, I will continue to drink this beer to continue to explore all of its mystique and beauty."
"Wow, yet another awesome, tasty brew by Ayinger. Fruitier than Ayinger's hefeweissen and slightly heavier (as you'd expect with a bock), drinking this is like drinking beer nectar. Delicious!"
"overall: I bought the pint bottle and had heard great things about Ayinger. I really enjoyed this beer, it was very delicious but slightly more sweetness than I prefer but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this beer. Very drinkable beer, I would definitely buy this again"
"murky straw-orange color. white head made up of tiny bubbles. surprising low head retention considering the wheat, it could be the notable alcohol content. yeasty in smell, I actually don't find the aroma appealing. my first impression was off-putting mold smell. thankfully, it tastes much better than it smells. wide spectrum of flavors. dark malted wheat flavor - into clean yeast and a slight acidic ending. nice caramel aftertaste. clean flavor really isolates and accentuates the malted wheat flavor. creamy smooth mouthfeel. low carbonation enhances the smooth quality. pretty unique and tasty beer. Ayinger has yet to disappoint."
"O- A pretty good weizenbock. This one was quite a bit sweeter than any of the weizenbocks I have had, a little too sweet."
"Definitely not a beer to drink by the liter if you intend on drawing out the fun all night long."
"Overall I'll get this again. A wonderful beer. I think that aventinus is better overall for a German weizenbock that's easy to get, but this is no slotch."
"This is a tasty, fruity (estery) beer that is easy to drink but a bit sweet and a bit boozy."
"Certainly a beer not t be missed!"
"It poured a hazy yellow color beer with a large white head which dissipated quickly. It smelled of wheat, yeast, straw, malt. It tasted of wheat, yeast, slight nutmeg, bread. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied. Overall, This is a top 10 German beer. finally a fantastic tasting beer. It just warms in your mouth like a spoon full of french onion soup. yum give me another."
"O- overall this was a very enjoyable beer that reminded me more of a hefeweizen. check it out if you havnt. anything ayinger makes is pretty good."
"Medium carbonation and a medium body for the style. I have had thicker, but I think this is more drinkable with the body as it is. Overall job very well done"
"D: It would be very easy to drink several pints of this. The alcohol is concealed dangerously well."
"D - Not bad, this is a logical extension of the intense yeast character of Ayinger's lower alcohol wheat beers. There is a dense malt note that is present throughout, but I really would have expected it to be darker with some caramel and toasted notes; I guess it is a helles weizen bock. Drinkable enough, but I would definitely take their Brau-weisse or ur-weisse over this one."
"Finishes very light with a creamy body. Crisp rather than hot alcohol on the tongue. A drinkable weizenbock."
"Final thoughts - for a hefeweizen, it would be absolutely amazing. But I terms of weizenbocks that I've had to this point, its second only to Aventinus. Hey but wait it only lost to the best beer in my opinion. If you can get this beer, do it!"
"O - Very good brew. I like the style, the wheat adds some smoothness and nice sweet notes to an already malty brew."
"Very nice beer. Creamy and decadent on the palate, not big on the ""bock"" aspect but more like an imperial hefe. But oh so delicious. Bubblegum and clove at the forefront, middle and through the finish, banana flavors linger on the finish as well. A bit bready with light toffee flavors. Yeasty throughout. Light raisin quality deep in the finish that peeks out after a few sips."
"Low A-"
"I like this beer, but I don't think it's more exceptional than their regular weissbier, and really, just more alcoholic than complex, though of course the increased alcohol leads to a slight increase in complex character. I'll probably just go with the Ayinger brau-weiss over this, but who can say for sure, after all, I've made impulsive buying decisions before, and will do so again."
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 9, 2011. It pours a bubbly but hazy starw yellow with an incredible head that is topped off with a silky, delicate frosting-like cap. The aroma is full of yeast and wheat with a little banana characteristic. The body is comfortbale on the tongue and does not break down into a fizz. In the taste there is a lively combination of traditional German malts, a bhiunt of wheat, a bite of clove, and a tangy, tart end."
"O - This has great drinkability. It goes down smooth, and I love the flavor. Overall, I think this is a really good beer. The flavor is great. I recommend giving this one a try. I will definitely be picking up some more."
"plenty sweet punctuated and contextualized by meaningful bitterness. mouthfeel is creamy but still a little springy"
"Take a look at the label art, and notice our friend the German billy goat (Bock) has a pair. Quite appropriate, since this Ayinger Weizen-Bock definitely has a pair too."
"I would never get bored drinking this beer. This is a perfect complement to a hot Florida day."
"There's a mix of berry candy and mild banana with soft wheat bread in the background. That said, there's that backing malt is rich and full, giving this a heavier body, but an appropriate weight for the style. So if you love hefe's and want to see and taste what they can be amped up, this is exactly that. All the same rich yeast character and smooth malt."
"Nothing wows me with this Helles Weizenbock-- it's just a solid brew. Very drinkable."
"Fantastic, and while it's many months old, I don't have many complaints."
"Pours a very cloudy light golden color with a dense white head that sticks around for a bit. Some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass and a thick collar throughout. The nose is filled with clove, alcohol, and a strong bready presence. The flavor scales back on the bread and picks up more clove along with a bit of banana. Booze there as well. Body is medium with moderate carbonation. Pretty good, though nothing I'd go out of my way for again; nowhere near Celebrator."
"D- 4 I could easily enjoy a few of these on a hot afternoon or lazy day. It doesn't bring anything extraordinary to the table but has a sweet and smooth wheaty taste that addresses the palate well."
"O - this is a great beer. i originally compared it to the hofbrauhaus hefe in overall taste, but after having a couple over the past few months, i can really sense some fairly large differences. make an effort to pick one up and give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
"What to make of a weizenbock that drinks more like a hefeweizen? I'm rendered speechless. What is there to say? German breweries in general, and Ayinger in particular, have consistently excellent output. This offering has made the distinct and strong style exceptionally agreeable, and unthinkably drinkable. I guess all I can do is recommend it."
"Cloudy, straw yellow with a fluffy white head. Descent retention and lacing. Smells of yeasty wheat with hints of bananas and cloves. Hints of citrus. Very clean tasting for this style. The banana clove tastes are subtle. Hints of lemon, pepper, and orange with a very sweet front end. Overall a very clean and easy drinking beer."
"O - A very nice wheat choice. All that youd expect from one, but more pronounced and warmer."
"I dont think this is necessarily a classic example of the style ( im thinking more of Aventinus with a bigger malty bock like chocolate note). For me, this is just a higher abv Hefeweizen. This is still an excellent beer though! Must try"
"overall; not overly impressed with this one in comparison with others of the style. Still, its nearly indistinguishable characteristics from a regular version of the style make it a nice drink."
"O: This one is a beer I will certainly try again. Wow. Great offering."
"WS"
"500 mL bottle from WF, Arlington"
"Pours a nice hazy bright yellow color with a frothy two to three finger head which gives way to some lace. The aroma is of toffee and nice citrus fruits and a sweetness. The taste follows suit, a sweet malt backbone hit with hints of banana like a hef as well as light citrus fruits. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and creamy and smooth. The drinkability is high, it is an easy drink with enough flavor to keep you goin."
"Future months are looking good, only March and I found this beautiful wheat beer to spend some time with. Delicious!!!"
"was hoping for a bit more robust offering, but this beer delivers a nice experience with what it gives and definitely is worth a few sips."
"Fullish body, light effervescence. Slightly warming. Very, very good. Rich, almost silky as it flows towards the throat. Excellent."
"I'm a big fan of the style, and a fan of this brewery, and am not disappointed in any way here. Not quite a new favourite, but definitely a good brew."
"Poured this Wizen Bock out of a 500 ML bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a hazy golden color. It produced a beautiful think bright white frothy head. It settled to a 2 finger widths and was very well carbonated. There was no lacing to speak of. The beer had a aroma of rich wheat with hints of lemon, banana. The mouthfeel was watery. The taste was overall very nice, very much dominated by wheat and finished with light citrus and banana. Here was also a slight taste of clove. Very Good example of a Weizenbock! Prost!"
"Notes: This is a lovely showcase of deep wheaty flavor."
"Light colored for the style, cream and brassy gold with a fine, soft white head that leaves some gritty lace on the glass. Tangy wheat malt and big banana in the nose with apples, clove and bubblegum. Over-ripe banana and phenolic, estery yeast flavors with hay and a cracker-like dryness in the finish. Medium bodied with palatte scrubbing carbonation. Another fine beer from Ayinger."
"The color when poured was a hazy golden yellow with a reddish hue, little foar and no lace. The smell had the aroma of wheat yeast, fruit, spice and citrus. The flavor bad the taste of yeast, a hint of banana, orange/lemon, with a touch all spice. Not to citrusy, not overly sweet. A nice balance of all the compentents that will make this Weizenbock a favorite for all Weizenbock drinkers!"
"D: Very drinkable. I could put quite a few of these down with no problem at all."
"A good companion with grilled meat, quite too pricy around here given its not so outstanding value"
"Drink - Another Ayinger beer that I really enjoyed. It was very drinkable and I'd be happy to drink it again anytime."
"Drinkability: Not your average weizenbock, but I am not complaining. Another high class brew from a high class brewery."
"D - Its very drinkable but better to enjoy steadily. Pretty solid overall."
"Poured out of 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours hazy dark yellow / orange with a fluffy white head. The aroma has creamy wheat, some banana esters, light spices and is a bit rich. Medium / full body with lots of flowing soft carbonation. The taste is like the aroma, but is very smooth and full with smooth wheat and some cinnamon-like spice on the finish with lots of effervescence. This does not really fit my concept of a winter warmer style, but a nice German Weizenbock."
"Drinkability: This beer may just be the best I've ever had. World class for sure."
"Goes down uber smooth."
"D-Excellent, highly drinkable"
"Pours from the 16.9 oz. bottle a cloudy, hazy yellow with a giant 2 1/2 finger head that stays for quite a while. Very active carbonation...tons and tons of bubbles rising in the murky haze. Aroma is of banana , lemon, and perhaps a little orange, with a hint of spice (coriander?) as well. 1st sip is an amazingly delicious blend of the banana and citrus, with a soft, sweet, almost candy-like undertone. The classic wheat malt crispness shines through. Mouthfeel is soft and full with a nice sparkle from the carbonation. Drinkability is almost TOO good for a beer with that packs a 7.1% abv punch. These would be such a treat on a hot summer day, although it hits the spot here in January, too. Overall, a very tasty and satisfying beer! I'll be picking up more of this soon and letting some age for summertime!"
"D: Incredibly drinkable for a beer over 7% and really smooth. This is a great beer overall and a great example of the style."
"Pours a golden-orange hue with some good lookin haziness, not much of a head seemed to form up, but what did seems to leave pretty good lacing on the glass. Has a very fruit forward aroma, with some vanilla-creamy notes and a slight butterscotch smell to it, pretty enticing. Taste is insanely creamy and full of bananas, butterscotch and natural fruity yeast flavors. Touch of sweetness towards the end of the sip, with just a tad bit of bitterness and alcohol presence to round the brew out nicely. Very smooth and refreshing mouthfeel, leaning towards the medium-light body, this is a great beer and one that should be shared. Drinkability is definitely on the high side, such a flavorful and delightful experience to kick back and enjoy this one."
"Drinkability- It's a good drink with a complex flavor and cannot be consumed quickly. It's a sit down experience."
"D - eminently drinkable; wish I had more tonight"
"A nice, pretty warm and wheaty, fruity and yeasty German ale. Not nearly as strong-seeming as the labeled ABV would indicate, which suggests a certain set of capable integration skills, if not any more overall complexity than what I am able to describe here."
" I really have to admit I am hot and cold with Weizenbocks I really dug this one. It is a quality beer with so much drinkability - I savored it since I only had one bottle. It is one I would not hesitate to buy again and again. The blend of wheat and bock is seamless and it is a substantial all around pleasant and delectable beer."
"D: Not my cup of tea."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of spices and banana. Taste is good, banana, spices, grains, lots of flavor coming through. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a top quality beer."
"Can't say I have much to compare this to except for the darker Aventinus, but it definitely speaks for and stands on its own, and based on its merits. A very well put together Weizenbock, and worth seeking out to try."
"Overall a beer that lives up to its other siblings from Ayinger quite notably. I look out my window and see the snow starting to fall and whip around tumultuously as I sip this. No worries, this ale is a soothing cold weather treat. I feel like I'm flying first class in stormy weather, but do not feel even the least bit of turbulence. And this is the kind of ride I like."
"Overall, this has been a long time favorite of ours, and is the beer that got us into weizenbocks. What is best about this beer is the complexity of the taste. There is such a range of flavors here, from fruit, to cream, to smoke, which, curiously and expertly, are melded together to form an entirely unique brew of the highest quality."
"I think I'd rate this beer the equal of Weihenstephaner Vitus, and in fact I think I enjoy it just a little bit better."
"in Philly, wow good stuff. Highly recommend if you like wheat beers. Outstanding!"
"D: High; a very enjoyable brew -- left me wanting more!"
"Drinkability - This is an all around terrific beer and shows a lot of discipline for this most difficult style. I'd say that this is one of the hardest beers to do just right but Ayinger pulled it off quite nicely."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, light carbonation, drying on the finish. Pretty good drinkability, alcohol is a bit prominent, and the size makes balance a bit more of an issue. While this is still a very balanced beer, it seems like the effort to maintain that balance is more obvious."
"drinkability - highly refreshing, alcohol is pretty well masked, price brings the drinkability down a bit (~$4 for 500ML), no doubt this is among the best I've had among its style, this is a beer I would love to enjoy again down the road"
"Alright this was a surprise.Someone at a beer store told me I should try this one,that it is really good.And right they were.I poured this into a glass,checked out the nice golden haze.Watched the tiny bubbles.I took a drink of it and tasted a lil citrus,but unexpectedly banana and cloves.THe beer has a fresh and smooth taste to it.Great taste of hops and malts.Alcohol of 7.1.I became happier the more I drank. I tried to enjoy every single drink. Before I wanted I had finished 17oz?.After that I was mad for not buying more.Wow what a great Beer!!I will be buying more soon and trying to share some with my friends."
"D: This was a very nice weizenbock with superb balance and clean taste. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was super easy to drink. I liked this better than Celebrator, and rank it among the top weizenbocks. Very well done brew."
"Ayinger Weizenbock was very hazy and yellow-orange in color. It had a very large, fluffy white head with good retention. The aroma was banana, clove, and wheat. The taste was full of banana, clove, and pepper with some wheat and light malt mixed in. The finish was dry with more yeast flavors, spices, and a little throat warming alcohol coming through. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and fairly high carbonation. Drinkability was very good as well. This is a very good beer and well worth seeking out."
"This beer is quite different from what I was expecting. Unlike a typical Weizenbock, this is pale colored with very little dark malt character. For this reason, I think this is a beer that would have been better if it was fresher. In the nose is a moderate yeastiness with a touch of bannana. Bready malt comes through as well, but I'd like some more malt character. On the palate, the body is noticeably heavier and wheatier than a typical hefeweizen. Alcohol heat is kept to a minimum. Carbonation is a little low, failing to liven up such a hefty wheat beer. This is an interesting take on the style, but I'd prefer a regular hefeweizen or a more traditional weizenbock."
"Drink- What a great Weizenbock, a deservedly earned solid A, I haven't had a bad Ayinger yet and the trend continues."
"This is a very tasty beer; it really hides its strength quite well, which is certainly dangerous in a 7.1% beer. I really like how vibrant the traditional Hefeweizen character is here; it definitely seems like the character volume has been turned up a bit, which is really then only, subtle, sign that this is not a traditional strength Hefewiezen. Very tasty and one that I am definitely enjoying, this must be an absolutely killer beer when it is fresh."
"D: Not a problem at all to drink the half liter bottle of this one. Maybe not quite as good as some of the other weizenbocks I've had, but still quite quaffable."
"Pours a little bit hazy, and a beautiful pale amber. Lots of carbonation and a two-finger of soapy head that persists as a off-white crown, leaving no lacing to speak of. Wonderful grapefruit peel and lemon peel aromas, along with some wheat malt and yeastiness. Some spiciness, more typical of Belgian Golden ales, is in there. Wonderful so far. Rich and full mouthfeel of German goodiness. If I had to pick one beer that I've ever had that screamed ""GERMANY!"" to me, this is it. It's one of the most drinkable 7% brews I've ever had and I could see myself, and probably any beer lover, getting stupid drunk off this very quickly. Flavor profile is loaded with banana, yeast, wheatiness. This is delicious beer. I could session this, and get hella sick, for sure...High ABV wonderfully masked. This beer is really good, and probably great any season - hot or cold. You should always have a few bottles of this in your stash. Top notch."
"This beer has everything I love in a hefeweizen, and more. Poured a bright gold with a tinge of haze. Fluffy white head and sharp aroma of spices. Slightly tart at the front, then softening with pronounced clove and spice, with muted yeasty banana notes in the background. A tiny bite of pepper at the end, which could have been ETOH or the yeast spicyness. Finish was slightly sweet. A classic."
"The taste, like the aroma, is very sweet. Esters and phenols lead the way, with some light maltiness buried beneath the fruit and spice. It has a bit of an apple-cinnamon character, along with the banana notes you would expect from a hefeweizen yeast. The body is medium, bordering on full, and the sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a few ounces, as this really doesn't dry up in the finish at all. Banana bread flavors linger on the tongue between sips. Spicy phenols become more prevalent as the beer warms, which doesn't enhance the drinkability much. A fairly good beer, but not great. I'll stick to Vitus if I want a pale weizenbock."
"Drinkability - This is a fantastic brew. I almost wish I was sipping it along with my hookah. At 7.1% abv, it might not be a beer that I'd go back to more than once per evening, but definitely worth a sixpack!"
"It is highly drinkable and very satisfying."
"D: The beer is quite refreshing and the alcohol content is completely hidden from both the smell and taste."
"D_Very drinkable. Very affordable."
"Cloudy honey-colored brew with rigorous carbonation gives a huge 3"" of white sticky meringue head. Nose gives a great pineapple sweetness, a bit of banana and cinnamon. Taste is also sweet pineapple spiked with cinnamon, a bit of yeast and general wheaty spice. Feels wonderfully thick and creamy, soft carbonation. No sign of the 7.1% ABV, very smooth. Maybe a bit too sweet, but still very tasty. Highly recommended."
"Cloudy caramel amber colour with a fairly dense white cap, kind of short but with great head retention. Sticky and a bit clumpy, lots of lacing. Bready and banana in the nose, cloves and caramel. Notes of bubblegum and faint citrus. Low bitterness, sugary caramel flavour with fruity bubblegum, banana, and a hint of lemon in the finish. Bread and wheat crackers, some yeast and mild alcohol, spicy in the finish. Lots of flavour, but surprisingly balanced and mellow. Medium bodied, lots of carbonation that was a bit creamy and smooth. Some dryness and a hint of warmth. Great stuff. Very drinkable and quite tasty."
" D- This beer has nice classic weizen qualities with pleasant club soda and soft hop support. This is a great weizen that is not a full meal like many and goes down really smooth. This would be a great session beer."
"D - Such a drinkable beer that I could easily do three of these 16.9oz bottles. A really pleasant experience."
"16.9 oz bottle poured into a weizen glass. It is a cloudy golden color with a few inches of head. Smells include banana, cloves, and peaches. Taste is, again, very prominent in cloves and banana. Aftertaste is slightly metallic. This is very smooth and refreshing with almost no bite from alcohol. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and bubbly. This is another solid version of what is becoming one of my favorite styles."
"Beer is fruity and mildly bitter. Finishes wet and has a medium to light feel in the mouth. Lots of carbonation on the palate and some nice flavors throughout. I would drink this beer again in a minute. Very enjoyable, high drinkability and good mouthfeel."
"Yessir! This one hits the spot. Slightly on the malty side but exquisitely balanced."
"Edit: Reminds me a bunch of Vitus... wish I would have saved it to drink side by side."
"D: Of course I want more. Any time, any place, I just want more. A world class weizenbock."
"At first pour i wonder where they get the sense to put Bock in the name, this is rather a pale golden color, with a great pearlesent head, a very attractive beer, but not the brownish body i was expecting when i pryed off the cap. very attractive looking non the less. Spices and Banana, Yeasty, estery and light fruit such as pears red apples. Yeast is pretty forefront considering the style, but i offer the disclaimer i did pour in the yeast Hefe style half way through this review, i'm not one to shy away from a good helping of yeast if its around. medium carbination in a medium light body, with a semi dry finish. this one is great and refreshing chilled right now as im sitting in my 80f room. very drinkable. this is one i would enjoy keeping stocked as a refreshing summer beer. very good."
"I poured into my glass to a generous, three finger, white head. I smell is wheat, yeast, spices (clove), some citrus and banana. It's a golden amber color. It is lighter in color than I expected. The taste is banana, cloves, yeast. There is also a bready malt character to it. There is a constant stream of bubbles coming from the lasar etching at the bottom of the glass. I also noticed a layer of yeast settled at the bottom of the bottle. This is a pretty tasty beverage. I have liked all the weizenbocks that I have tried to date."
"D: only bought one bottle ;-( but I can see drinking it all evening long!"
"Overall a very nice beer. Super easy drinking. Quite refreshing. I will have to pick more of this up for the summer."
"M = Maybe just a bit too much foam once it enters the mouth, medium body, good mouthcoating."
"Nice beer but I was wishing it was Aventinus the whole time. The perfection of that beer makes other nice beers pale in comparison, quite literally."
"Fantastic. Really good drinkability. Enjoy."
"D- Overall, Ayinger Weizenbock is a world class beer that's definitely worth picking up. This beer is welcome in my fridge any day. Highly Recommended!"
"Was pumped to see this, as no one in my area stocked Vitus this year. Pours a very hazy amber with fluffy white head, fades to a thin layer leaving thin sheets of lace. Smell: heavy on wheat and overripe banana, faint spicy hops, faint butterscotch. Taste: banana, wheat cracker, a touch of cloves, and a bit buttery. A touch of slushy red delicious apple towards the end of the sip. Active carbonation with a fluffy, creamy feel. Pretty nice, but not great."
"Not my taste. I could see some people really liking this beer."
"OVERALL: A good beer that is certainly enjoyable and drinkable. The nose was a little too muted, unfortunately, and the look disappointed by the end, but nevertheless, this is a good brew worth checking out."
"D: definitely a solid weizenbock. Definitely worth seeking out."
"The palate opens with something I've never experienced in a beer before - jackfruit. Yep. Jackfruit. Probably a useless descriptor 'cos it's nigh on impossible to find it in the US, but growing up eating the heck out of it, I find it rather unmistakable. Mildly stinky with plenty of other flavors to go around, especially bread, honey and a little brown sugar, this beer is rather intriguing on the palate. Just a touch of smoke is present as well, this is seriously off the wall. Moderately sweet on the finish with the spices coming in, especially clove and a little cinnamon, this medium bodied beer has a moderate level of carbonation with a lingering finish with honey, a little smoke and some spice. It also does come across as a touch watery, but this really is a very very interesting beer that I will revisit."
"All the visible bubbles are a bit of a head fake, as the mouth is miles from fizzy or prickly. Good heft for 7% and such subtle flavor. It is no Aventinus and I believe I'd select an excellent hefe over this Ayinger brew."
"Excellent purchase."
"Almost want to drop some ice cream in it for a cream pie in a glass! Love the way this evolves as it warms...."
"D: Extremely quaffable for a 7% beer, goes down far too easy for a beer that could sneak up on you."
"I am ashamed to say this is my first Ayinger beer, but I will try them all now!"
"D: This beer is excellent. Great flavor and the alcohol seems non exsistent. Very well crafted."
"D: Refreshing and flavorful."
"Bigger medium body, soft, round, tangy, smooth, fluffy, and a delight to let sink in. Its much like a really good hefe but with more body, and therefore, much better then most hefes in that dept. I really enjoyed the way it feels in the mouth and the way it drinks with so much ease. Very soft, smooth, and fluffy with an incredible balance of tang. Perhaps the just over 7% might be a small set back for drinking more then a few of these quickly. But damn if that isn't an oxymoron with this stuff! Solid as always. Ayinger is my fav German available brewery here in MN!"
"D-this is quite a tasty brew! Definitely more hefe than bock; but the flavors work very well together. Highly carbonated and good body keep it quite refreshing."
"D: A solid weizenbock, but I'll take an Aventinus over this one."
"Not a bad beer at all. It's a very drinkable strong hefe, basically. Bock-wise, it compares poorly next to the excellent Aventinus weizenbock, though."
"Ho-Slaps every other bock I've ever had. Period."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden straw topped by more than enough bright white foamy head that left surprisingly little lacing behind. The smell holds notes of banana, clove, wheat, sugar cane, and toasted rice. The taste generally follows, those clovey banana notes up front, followed by a rush of wheat and a vague sense of non-cloying sweetness, ending with some coriander and a yeasty funk that melds nicely with the wheaty flavors. The body is medium at best, with perfect carbonation and a very smooth texture. Overall, a tasty and highly drinkable brew."
"Drinkability is great another fine creation from Ayinger strong like the horned goat and smooth like the winter snow. I'm down for another and more if you can find this brew."
"Poured a well-carbonated dirty gold with frothy head that sticks around for awhile and dies slowly with lace. A clear wheat/yeast twang with some spicy clove and a lemony/orange citric dominates the nose but there is a strong malty background as well. A great smoothness and balance is in this lighter weizenbock, with a citric and clove taste along with some residual wheat sweetness combo w/ some type of candi sugar-esque sweet malt for a light to medium body beer that has a sweet touch along with a distinct sharp hefe taste and it finishes slightly nutty and dry. Not a strong beer, although the ABV is deceptive, but a great beer to sip on."
"Lighter to medium body with the great spritzy carbonation of a weizen. Very easy to drink, as the alcohol is barely noticed. Very delicious."
"Brauerei Aying is one of my very favorite German breweries. That's largely due to the excellent Brau Weisse, but Ur-Weisse, Oktober Fest-Marzen and Jahrhundert Bier are very good in their own right. Weizen-Bock is an outstanding weizenbock if you like 'em pale malted and bananarific."
"Pours a hazy golden with a big white head. Smell is of freshly cut wheat and a nice yeast phenol. Taste is light and syrupy sweet up front, with a grainy wheaty middle, and a tart, yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is super thick and creamy, high carbonation. Drinkability is quite good, especially for 7% ABV. This is an excellent Weizenbock that I plan to get again."
"500ml bottle. Slightly hazy golden beer body with a large tightly bubbled white head. Lovelly,honeyish,spicy, banana-bready aromas..very delicious..my mouth is watering. taste is very similar to the aroma but with a more phenolic quality, and for me hints of marischino cherries. peppery finish. Nice intresting mouthfeel to this its carbonated but just anough to let this roll over the tongue easily. very nice beer. i am really enjoying this."
"Quite good but you got to like characterful and sweet wheat beers to thoroughly enjoy this beer. Where hops are absent, the complexity and balance comes from the intense spicy phenols and frutiy esters.... and that odd meaty taste."
"overall a really good brew, one of the best weizenbocks that i have had."
"After hearing that this beer was a must, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. As a fan of Vitus, I was thinking that maybe this beer might be a good partner to it. Frankly, Vitus kicks this beers butt all over the place. So, while this is a good beer, it's not in the upper echelon of W-b's."
"D - Hmm, tough call. The alcohol is well hidden and it's delicious, but I wouldn't really want another(tonight, that is. A 500ml bottle is a nice serving size)."
"1 Pt. .9 fl. oz. bottle served at 52 degrees in my Weihenstephan weizen glass. Poured all head - creamy, dense, bright white and occupying 90% of the volume of the glass. As the head slowly receded, it revealed a hazy orange-gold body. Some strands of lacing, but no legs - only a few residual spots. Nose is dominated by bananas and cloves with a hint of wheat. Taste is somewhat of a let down considering what the nose put off - a mere shadow of the nose and a bit watery, with a a strange aftertaste (maybe a little plasticy). Mouthfeel is light-bodied and starts off flat, but as I finish the bottle pour it becomes a bit more crisp. Better than I initially anticipated, but not quite where I expected it to be overall. Could potentially be past its prime; I'll have to retry this one at a later date."
"I'm always on the lookout for weizenbocks, so I was excited to try this one. Tasty stuff, nice blended flavor, not overpowered by any one component--not too spicy, not too sweet. I also liked the mouthfeel of this, I've had some strong bocks that felt watery, but not this one. Good stuff!"
"My first ""oh shit!"" beer of 2010 comes from my favorite German brewery, and one of my favorite styles of beer. I'm very glad Merchant du Vin began importing this beer to the states, because I'll be getting more of this stuff very soon."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy golden yellow with a huge foamy white head that isn't going anywhere. Smell is strong of banana, clove and yeast. Smell and appearance suggest a hefe, rather than a weizenbock. This is barely darker than your average hefe. Taste leads off with a blast of banana with some spiciness going down. Smooth malt balances the other flavors perfectly. Flavor is top notch and lingers on the palate nicely. Carbonation is perfect for the style and helps the beer go down really well. Another great wheat offering from Ayinger. I'll be buying a lot more of these once warmer weather rolls around."
"D- Very good, Id say this is more of a summer beer."
"It has been a while since I have had a Weizenbock, looking forward to this one. Poured this one in to a Weiss glass. Color is a murky orange, light for this style, and a quick to fade white head. From the nose I get some pear and apple, cream, and some chalky yeast. Taste has a whole array of fruit such as banana, pear and apple again, peaches...also it has a great bread like base, and even some powdered sugar qualities. The carbonation on this one makes it incredibly drinkable. The alcohol cannot be felt at all, and goddamn, what can I say, this is a real treat, and one of the best Weizenbocks I have ever had. Any fans of the style should seek this one out immediately."
"A Little disappointed I didn't get quite the flavor I look forward to in a dark wheat doppelbock. This here's a blonde wheat bock, and tastes more like a regular hefe weizen, with a bit more body. Tasty, though, undeniably tasty."
"D-its a good beer and the alcohol is well hidden but a little apparent; for me it reminded me of their dunkel but a bit stronger and maybe a bit sweeter. I really like the Aventinus version of this style because of the dark color and more complex flavor. The Ayinger weizenbock is decent, but not much different than their dunkel version."
"Overall an enjoyable beer but probably not worth getting again soon."
"D: Nice drinkability but a pint sits well here. Solid recommend and cant go wrong with this brewery."
"A classic, for sure! A HW on steroids...very banana-ish with nice spicing. Drinks very well even with alcohol touch, that adds a nice pepper note. A strong HW (thus weizen bock) that is dreamy!"
"This is hugely deserving of its acclaim, and instantly goes to the top of the list in terms of my favourite weizenbocks. This should definitely be regarded in the same league as the Aventinus and Vitus of this world."
"Very clove-y, very dry body and highly carbonated. Wheat malts aplenty balance with German hops and light yeast esters that suggest pear and banana. Slight tinge of ethanol in the background lets you know the 7.1% is working. Body is on the light side of medium, and the creaminess picks up after several minutes as the intense carbonation settles to a more reasonable level. A bit rough around the edges when drinkability is taken into consideration, but Ayinger still makes a very tasty Weizenbock."
"D: A good drinker."
"Overall- Pretty tasty. Sweet with a warm finish."
"Pours a cloudy dark straw color with a white head. The main aroma is bready malts and German yeast but you also get some banana and clove. The flavor is heavy on the banana and clove but the bready malts are still there. Thinner mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I had read reviews stating this was basically a souped-up hefeweizen and those reviews were correct. Whatever it is, it is very good."
"The mouthfeel is disappointing. It probably does not deserve the average score I gave. It feels flat. It just lies on the palate with no life. And this also limits drinkability. What otherwise could be a wheat ale for the cold weather makes it somewhat of a drag to drink."
"D: Nice helles weizenbock. Didn't wow me with flavour, but a solid example of the style from this country brewery."
"D- could be dangerous. Alcohol is barely perceptable, and it possesses all the refreshing qualities of a normal hefe. Bigger bolder and delicious doesn't hamper this D,"
"D Good as this is a smooth, lighter side beer and it is sweet. The late soapy taste drove the drinkability down a bit but it remains good. 4.0"
"D: Personally, I could session this, but for someone not used to the above average ABV, this could be a sneaky brew. It's just so incredibly tasty and easy to drink."
"You know I didnt even know Ayinger made a weizenbock,man was I in in the dark.Poured a mix of tea and lemonade with a large blooming crown atop that settled very slowly into a creamy-like mass.A mix of green apple and lemon stands out most in the nose,light yeasty spice and sweet alcohol shows thru as well.Lightly medicinal and clove spice hit the palate melding into lemon pith and sweetish alcohol,although the alcohol is not obtrusive.Honestly I would have never imagined the abv of this beer,its not light as far as feel goes,it just goes down easily.A nice beer from a very tradional brewery."
"cloudy golden-light-orange with a huge tight-packed head that settles very very slowly. citrus-yeasty smell that reminds me of something belgian i drank last night. yes, lighter than expected, this is creamier yet has a nice carbonated edge. the sweetness does not overwhelm or stay around (thankfully...). i like it's punctuality. noting some sourness that compliments that smack of sweetness. good balance. drinkable for the style for sure, just not my favorite style. i'd still definitely take one of these anytime. nice to finally try this one."
"Tangy wheat and the yeast esters give this kind of a ""imperial"" hefeweizen flavor with some light graininess and alcohol suggestions. Not overly full bodied in the mouth, and actually is one of the lightest feeling wiezenbocks I have had. Still, a very tasty beverage that goes down very easily considering the ABV. I like it, but not quite as much as Aventinus and Vitus."
"D: A whole lot of weizen, not much bock. This is basically a slightly souped-up hefe. That's not a bad thing, though. Recommended for fans of German wheat beers."
"Not much for that kind of mouthfeel, and hence, makes this guy undrinkable for the most part. Glad I only bought one. The aroma is pretty much the flavor. No thanks."
"OVERALL Maybe I went into this expecting it to be something it not only wasn't, but didn't intend to be. So maybe my scores reflect my high expectations? But it didn't amaze me as I'd hoped. I'll have it some more, and see what I think. But it was fairly complex, and the booze is well hidden. It's interesting, but perhaps too sweet and malty, even for this style?"
"Hazy gold in color with a huge, rolling off-white and very stubborn head. Spice and big bananas float to the nose. A modicum of coriander and yeast follow up. Creamy around the palate with hints of citrus, light fruits (bananas, apples), and a malty base. Was expecting something a bit darker, and this one could pass for a straight up hefe, and a damn good one at that."
"Opinion: Well, to be honest, I am a little surprised that I liked this beer as much as I did. I am not a fan of Weizen beers, so I put this review off for a couple weeks. I do like Aventinus quite a bit, but I like that it is a darker Bock style. This one being light colored intimidated me a bit as I like the Dunkel Weisse more than the Hefe. All this said, this beer really surprised me. It is very drinkable thought it is fermented at least partially with Weizen yeast. I really like the balance in this beer and it makes it really approachable and drinkable to me. I would definitely not hesitate to try this beer again and would look forward to trying it on tap."
"D: I was really impressed by this. Perfect balance, complex flavors and a nice warmth make this one a winner. I hope to revisit this again the next time it comes around."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable. Good beer and a style I haven't had often if at all. Ayinger rarely disappoints but I have a lot to learn about german beer and classic german beer."
"The body is light while remaining full, very pleasing to the touch. Drinkability is top-notch, this beer goes down easy and having multiples would be a pleasure. Grab a couple next time you see it."
"1200"
"D - Very drinkable - especially in the summer months. Combine that with the zingy ABV, and it may sneak up on you. Flavors are well integrated. Downshot is that it does seem a bit filling."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has a really nice pale and wheat malt scent along with an outstanding hefe yeast aroma. The banana/clove character is well pronounced. The taste is good. It has a solid malt flavor that 's extremely dry with a nice fruity yeast finish. The yeast character really makes this beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good weizenbock. I've been a fan of Ayinger beers before, but this one is outstanding."
"Wow...really glad I got to check this one out. Perhaps my favorite style done in a Helles version of a Weizenbock. Hard to go toe to toe with Aventinus but this is the best example of a non-dunkel version I remember having to date."
"Drinkability: That lively, engaging effervescence lends a remarkable keen ease to the overall drinkability, making for a fine, enjoyable, wheaty brew."
"Fuller end of medium bod with a lot of smooth bread yeast. This gives the beer a lot of it's full body and contributes wonderfully to the flavor. Lots of zesty, peppery spice and crisp citrus fruit are very well integrated making this beer extremely flavorful and quite complex. Plenty of ripe banana along with hints of apple, lemon zest, pepper, clove and citrus lemon peel. All of these flavors are extremely well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the other and the ABV is excellently masked making this beer extremely quaffable. Highly recommended for German wheat beer fans or anyone reall. Excellent!"
"D: Awesome D here. First sip turned into a quaff on the second. Bottle killed waay too quick. Weizenbocks are a great style, this is one of the top 2 in my book!"
"Recent bottle. Pours big head on lighter yellow body. Aroma is pure bannana, good thick mouthfeel, and bannana in the taste. More like a hefeweizen. Drinkability was good. I was looking for more of an edge and complexity I love so much in weizenbocks. This was full, just the bannana overode the taste department."
"Overall, an exceptional brew and top 2-3 weizenbocks that I've had. A most welcome addition to the Aying family. Most highly recommend. Rotation - avail in TX and will be a big player in the rotation."
"D: Very drinkable. I would recommend getting this one if you see it on a menu. It won't disappoint."
"I would recommend drinking this beer at a warmer temperature than normal serving temperature to fully experience the full range of fruits and fermentation character. a good example of the style but still lacks some of the dark fruits and maltiness from german bocks that I so love in weizenbock. To me this is almost more of a maibock. I can appreciate the pale weizenbock but miss the dark fruits especially."
"Quite drinkable. Alcohol is well-hidden."
"D: Very easy to drink, and a great light colored winter beer. Excellent flavors, somewhat sweet but has just enough alcohol to hold it all together. Very flavorful."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. I was glad to see that this would make it's way over to the US."
"Overall, a wonderful example of a pale Weizenbock. It's really just like an amped up Hefeweizen. I still think I prefer the dunkel versions but I'll drink one of these any day."
"D: This beer suits itself pretty well for winter and for any other time of year for that matter. For a beer this size it certainly doesn't drink that way, almost refreshing considering the size. A delicious beer and a great representation of the style, good to see this in stores again."
"Drinkability rates high for this weizenbock. Tasty and a pleasure to drink."
"This is the first beer I've tried of Ayinger's besides their amazing doppelbock. I can see why this brewery is so celebrated, if you'll pardon the bad pun."
"This beer threw me off because i thought it would be like a dark wheat. It is really just a strong wheat beer. The beer is very good and has a very nice taste. It's flavor has a mix between banana, clove, and zest with a sweetness and bitterness that blend together nicely at the end. It is very cloudy and golden with a white head. It smells like banana laffy taffy with some spice. It is very drinkable and it has a nice thick mouthfeel. The only thing that is bad about this beer is that it costs $4.50 for a single 500ml bottle. Very good though."
"Overall, I would be happy to have another."
"Creamy and soft, with a faily light body and high drinkability."
"D: Very nice drinkability, the ABV is very well hidden. Another great beer from Ayinger, loved the label as well. One of the best W-bocks I've had, if not the best"
"Pours a cloudy dull orangish color with off white head that stays aloft for quite some time. Smells as a good weizenbock should - sweet banana and clove with wheat and maybe a touch of vanilla. I think I get a touch of alcohol on the nose. Taste is earthy with the same attributes as the nose. A very nice weizenbock. Body is light/medium and mouthfeel is very active carb yet fairly smooth. Some creaminess in the carbonation. Overall one of the top 3 weizenbocks."
"Very drinkable and well done. Enjoyable. Exactly what I was hoping for as far as the style goes. Worth your time."
"D - The 500ml serving size is no problem with this one. If you're looking for something a little more substantial that your typical hefe, this is the way to go. Probably the best example I've had of this style."
"500mL bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a hazy light orange with a decent frothy off-white head. Aroma is a nice amount of bananas and citrus with mild spice. The taste is similar to the nose, sweet fruits, bananas and mild spice, quite flavorful. The beer is medium bodied with slight warming alcohol. This is a very enjoyable weizenbock, one I'd certainly have again."
"This is a great beer and I'm glad to have had this weizenbock pretty fresh. It's hard to procure these imports when there still remotely fresh. You can definitely tell the difference. Throughly recommend this brew to anyone looking to see what a wiezenbock taste like especially while it's pretty fresh."
"$4.99 for a 1pt 0.9fl oz bottle. Pours out to a cloudy orange, forming a tall whipped white head with awesome retention and a solid sheet of meringue like lace. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The aroma is of green bananas, light cloves, pale malts. Mouthfeel is soft, lightly tart, clean, with a big wheat aftertaste and mild residual sweetness. Taste opens with green bananas and green apples, followed by a very mild bitterness, with a decent malt body bigger than your average hefe weizen. Cleanly fermented with no off flavors. About as typical as you can get for a weizen bock. A great example of the style. Recommended."
"Conclusion: Really tasty Weizenbock and a good example of the style. I got to have this and Victory's variation within two nights of each other; wish they'd have this style around more."
"D - Very drinkable, I venture to say these would be just as pleasing in the summer time."
"A quality Weizenbock without a doubt. Looks like it's time for another."
"In the same vein as Vitus, this is a pale style weizenbock. Also in the same vein, it's worth seeking out. I'm not sure if aging would be a good plan to get rid of the alcohol, but it's really not that hard to live with as is."
"Very flavorful and recommended. Flavor is pleasant and rich in clove and bubblegum. A touch of alcohol heat that I find attractive. Well done."
"D - This is a true German weizenbock because it is more weizen than bock. It is very delicious and a bargain at less than $5."
"EDIT: I haven't done a pale weizenbock comparison yet, BUT I did do a side-by-side with Aventinus and this brew probably does have more depth...even if I do like the chocolate flavors from Aventinus. I'd dare say this beer might be better than I thought."
"a pour orange pour that is quite cloudy. translucent at best. nice tight head. candied citrus for a nose. pineapple and cotton candy. palate that is wonderful creamy but also very refreshing. this density gets more prominent when the beer warms. palate as their hef with a boat load of bready protein and crisp floral on the tongue that cleans all the density off. marzipan and chamomile, honey, and lavender... great beer. could be had any day of the week as a large amount of nearly musky wheat malt. i would to say some the the best body around."
"D: Highly drinkable, but I have a hard time thinking of this as a weizenbock. Would not be opposed to having again. More along the lines of the Weihenstephaner Vitus than Aventinus."
"Drinkability: As a wheat beer this is quite good and different from the Brau-Weisse from the same brewery. While I like this beer I think I prefer my wezienbocks a bit darker, and with a more complex character (e.g., Aventinus and Moonglow). Nonetheless this is a fine beer and a treat to drink. But at the end of the day, given the choice of German brewed Weizenbocks I think I'd opt for the Aventinus."
"500ml bottle served in a Weizen glass. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy gold with three fingers of white head. Lots of carbonation per style. Nice mix of clove and banana in the aroma. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Good and spicy with clove in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Very easy drinking for the ABV. Classic rendition of a Weizenbock."
"Overall I am not a huge fan of this style but it's hard to not be a fan of a beer this good. It's not terribly complex but all of the flavors hold their own and have a good amount of pop. Well worth a shot."
"Note- Weizenbocks are among one of my favorite styles. This is damn near perfection! Amazing, Ayinger!"
"D-Even though this beer is 7.1% abv, this beer is very drinkable! I highly suggest this beer to anyone who loves craft beer."
"D. Very drinkable. Easy to drink and refreshing. Hard to tell that it is 7%. Good Summer beer."
"Excellent drinkability."
"Pours a super cloudy dirty orange color with a huge white head that slowly dissipates into a solid cap. The aroma is of wheat malt, some metal, banana, clove, lemon and tart apples. The taste is of clove, bananas, bubble gum, a hint of berry fruitiness. The malt takes a slap to the wheat edge and makes it sit down. As it warms there is a light lemon edge. Nice concentrated hefe flavors. Solid moderate feel, tingly carbonation, sits well and finishes awesomely terrific (a touch sweet). Very smooth feel, velvty. A very fantastic brew, a hefe on 'roids. This is very good and you must seek this out."
"Pours a very cloudy orange into my weizen glass. With hard pour it takes three tries to fill up the glass with a nice white head that doesn't hang around too long. The aroma is what I expect from a well built wheat beer, with aromas of bready bananas and spice. The flavor reflects the smell. Banana, clove, but a bit hot from the alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is rather light for a beer that is 7.1% alcohol, I wasn't expecting it and wouldn't be able to pick it out if you didn't tell me. This is a very drinkable beer, that I will go back to on occasion. Brau-Weisse is my #1 beer and this certainly reflects a stronger version of that classic. Overall, solid weizen-bock."
"Drinkable, hardly taste the slightly higher ABV..which is always a good thing."
"Pours a hazy golden peach with a creamy white head. Nose has wheat, tropical fruits, spicy yeast and cloves. Taste is quite fruity yet well balanced by the bready malts and peppery yeast. Crisp refreshing body is well carbonated. Another great beer from Ayinger."
"This is a great wheat beer for the Winter, proves you can have it year round for all those naysayers out there."
"D: this is a fantastic weizenbock. wish i had more of these. It's like their brau-weiss but a bit more bready malty complexity going on."
"500mL. Poured a cloudy and opaque deep yellow color with a nice tall white head. Retention was decent, but left no lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet and full of wheat, banana, clove, and yeast with some scents of grainy maltiness as well. Tastes are very similar to the aromas (banana, clove, wheat), but also has some vanilla notes and is rather sweet on the palate, especially on the finish. Alcohol is faint, but noticeable - seems more estery, but doesn't seem to reveal any sort of fruity notes that I guess I expected like others in this style category. Mouth-feel is medium bodied while being creamy and smooth. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this offering. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but I would tend to lean towards others in this style if given the choice. This one seemed a little too weisse-y and a little too sweet for my liking."
"Drinkability is good, it went down easily. I think I prefer Aventinus, but this was good."
"Recommended..."
"Taste is high quality HEFE. Bananas, citrus, yeast, bread and spice everywhere with excellent carbonated bite at the end. Alcohol is not apparent. This taste like a regular good German wheat beer. YOu would never know it has the high alcohol. A fine offering."
"Poured into a large Spaten weizen-shaped glass with a handle. Murky orange with a fluffy cap resting on the surface, at least a 3 finger head. Pouring the yeast in gives it a soupy weizenbock opacity. Clove in the nose, with the standard Ayinger hefe yeast. A little phenolic with a trace of banana. Flavor is lightly sweet and bready, more clove spice than banana in this one. Leaning more towards hefe than a supercharged weizenbock like Aventinus. Still it's very clean and refreshing. Overall i'd try it again, it's a nice Fall beer."
"Poured into my Celebrator glass a very nice cloudy darker yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a huge one-finger plus creamy white head, lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, very nice notes of spice/bannanas/cloves. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, yeasty, with some bannanas/clove notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew."
"Cloudy pale gold in color with a big fluffy white head sitting on top. Lots of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass. Got the typical banana, clove, and bubblegum along with that hint of pepper that other reviewers have mentioned. Clove simply dominates the taste for me. Then the banana kicks in...this is really good! Malty sweetness is there, but very moderate. To me, it was everything good about a weizen, just more of it. Also has a richer feel than a regular weizen. It's really hard to believe this has a 7.1%ABV...drinkability is scary. This stuff is fantastic."
"Overall a fantastic weizen bock. Again, this is on the wheat end of the spectrum for sure, but thats how i like em. An excellent beer that any wheat beer fan should never pass up. Will be going back to the store to stock up on these bad boys tomorrow. Great beer. Firmly in my top 5 for weizenbocks, without question."
"This is a good beer, and follows the style. Something that is worth a try."
"Drinkability: Besides the Aventinus offering this is probably one of the best Weizenbock's I've had the pleasure of having. I love how spicy the aromas and the actual taste are and it really shows off true Weizen properties with an excellent showing of bubblegum/banana like elemenets. At $3.25 and 7.1% ABV, this is not only a bargain, it's a steal! Grab this while you can!"
"F: Actually, I couldn't quite tell that this was a 7% beer; it tasted strong, but not that strong. This is a delicious and very drinkable beer."
"Man am I glad Aying is shipping this one to the States, as this is just a really fantastic beer."
"Very drinkable. I'd have one on a mild summer day anytime."
"As expected, Ayinger delivers another knock-out."
