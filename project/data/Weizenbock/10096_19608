Aventinus and the relatively new Weihenstephaner Vitus really blow this beer out of the water. It's certainly not a bad beer. It's just sort of simple and unsophisticated in comparison to the big German entries, which happen to be a couple of my very favorite beers. Anyway, this beer looks pretty good, red amber liquid with a dissipating beige head. There are some good wheat and fruit notes in the nose, but they're a bit restrained. There just isn't enough depth The flavor is too sweet and cloying for my taste. The flavors are syrupy clove, ripe banana and caramel malt. There are also some unpleasant alcohol notes. It's not sharp, but there's just a bit of a rubbing alcohol flavor around the edges. I sound down on this beer, but I think it's good. It's just not great.","popery","Jan 16, 2009"

Great aromas of plum, bread, clove, banana, and even some faint bubblegum. Hops aren't noticeable in the nose or taste, But the sweet, fruity yeast or carmelized malt is not cloying at all. Great banana bread combo of yeast and malt upfront. Good carbonation lets the 8% abv give some kiwi fruit flavors. But the alcohol doesn't add a warming feeling to the mouthfeel. Pretty fruity, the wheat and east flavors are shown in full glory with this beer. Plus the deceptive alcohol that mingles very well with the rest of the flavors.","scruffwhor","Dec 21, 2008"

It's unfiltered but the yeast was packed pretty tight on the bottom and little clouded up the beer. An aroma of toast, light caramel and some plum come out at first and later some earthy spice notes were detected. Very inviting. The mouthfeel is smooth and fluffs up like a friendly pillow. The flavor is clean with great light caramel malts, moderate bitterness and is well balanced. Overall, I was rather impressed with this one and found it quite drinkable.

The sweetness and alcohol become a bit much in the flavor (although the alcohol isn't exactly overpowering, it's more than I'd like). The yeasty complexities are there but in the shadows of the overwhelming dark malts. Almost has an artificial sweetener flavor to it.

Flavor wise the taste is a bit clouded with spices and it really dominates the effervesent green apple and raisin fruit esters dough powdered yeast sits heavy with light herbal hops this beer is not harmonious it's in battle of spice versuses the yeast almost seems like something of Belgian character rather than a German style weizenbock alcohol is pretty well hidden even as it warms. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy yet soft flowing the carbonation gives this medium to fuller bodied brew enough moving power to not sit on the palate completely but once again the yeast and spice characteristics sit heavy on the tongue in the finish in trainwreck fashion.

The nose is a little solventy sweet, with a very sweet banana, strong yeasty and lighter bready charater with a caramel sweetness playing in the background. I like the aroma on this one, even with the solventy sweetness in there. The flavor is very well blended with the yeasty softness and bready character being prevalent on the start, moving to a mild banana and very light raisin fruityness, and finishing with a bready and caramel maltyness. I enjoy the juxtoposition between the estery fruit and the bready and yeasty character. I think they play well together. Mouthfeel is chewy and moderate thick with a mild carbonation. The contrast between the lighter carbonation and the thickness of the body is good for this one. There is a mild drying character after taking a sip and it really hangs on the sides of my tongue. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one. The flavors and aromas are prevalent, but not obtrusive. I think the beer really blends together in all aspects.

Mouthfeel is quite nice, small & steady carbonation. I like the style a lot and this is one worth trying, but not worth going out of your way for.","clickpush","Mar 29, 2007"
4.18,12.4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This one didn't fill the mouth quite like the Aventinus, so I docked it for mouthfeel. In general, it is creamy and smoothly full. The wheat goes down very smooth. I absolutely love this style of beer, and this one is just fine.","BretSikkink","Mar 27, 2007"
4.05,8.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is maybe a touch thin for a Weizenbock, but still very smooth, and just short of creamy. The drinkability for me is very high, as i would have no problem putting a few of these down in a night, though with the alcohol, it might hurt a bit the next day.","RedHaze","Mar 25, 2007"
3.96,6.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth, not as rich as Aventinus or Mahr's, but very pleasing and drinkable. Overall a solid Weizenbock.","emerge077","Mar 05, 2007"

4.02,8.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D: A tasty beer, nice flavors and excellent mouthfeel. Brazil would not seem a likely locale for brewing quality traditional German/Euro brews, but if this one's any indication of what's typical, I'm certain I'll try more from Cervejaria Sudbrack. Recommended!","msubulldog25","Apr 20, 2006"

4.17,12.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Rather malty than fruity. Good balance, toasted, caramel, spicy (cloves), and esters (banana, apple). Low bitterness, as expected for the style. Good mouthfeel and drinkability.","schiaveto","Nov 23, 2005"
3.92,5.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"poured a murky reddish-brown color with modest head. Smell is extraordinarily enjoyable with profound yeast and ester notes combining with banana and cloves. Taste was also suprising, seeming to be a combination of a doublebock and a belgian ale, with some hefeweizen thrown in. Very confusing but supremely enjoyable. Only slight notes of alcohol to be found at the finish, which makes this beer a bit scary. I really liked this beer. First class effort.","tgbljb","Beers"

2.52,-32.3,3,3.5,2.5,2,1.5,"Not overly impressive or lasting head on a beautifully hazy dark brown ebony color body. The smell is wheaty but also shows notes of pear, apple and alcohol. In the taste, the wheat gets overwhelmed by a darker, more roasted malty flavor, and by the fruitiness of apples and pears already noticeable in the smell. Alcohol is clearly, and excessively present. 8% are hard to hide, for sure. Carbonation is a bit low to clean the palate of this excess of alcohol. The finish and aftertaste are chewy and dont fit in the style. Lacking sweetness and a refreshing character. Something interesting here, a nice try, but not a success. Undrinkable alone, I couldnt drink half of the 330ml bottle; maybe paired with some food, it could be a little better. Two thousand miles behind Aventinus.","tjd25","Beers"
