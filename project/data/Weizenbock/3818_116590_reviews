"Overall:  Once again, Southern Tier makes me happy.  A repeat buy next year?  Maybe.  Glad I tried it today?  Yes, definitely."
"O-Not a bad beer, not as good as a lot of Southern Tier's other offerings."
""
""
""
"The taste is a nice malty balanced taste that has a little hops that shine through too. It's a dangerously easy drinking big beer. It would be a pleasure to drink a lot of this. The style is meant to be that way - drank exclusively, in quantity, and it works."
""
""
"Southern Tier took the style and made it their own. An interesting weizenbock. Hops are more moderate than mild.  Overall, a pleasant unique brew."
""
""
""
"Fab brew for pairing with Prince Edward Island Mussels Belgian style of course, the beer is a wonderful blend of natural flavor. Not bitter to the pure tongue - Southern Tier lightly hopped perfect for the ladies that don't drink beer everyday."
""
""
"Caramelized bananas and sweet malts should create for a smoother, tastier experience. I would definitely let this one age."
"For some reason this just didn't work for me"

"At 7.5% ABV, I would argue that this should not be called an Imperial Weizenbock.  Despite this, it's a nice Weizenbock, albeit no cloves, less banana, and more bitterness than it's German parent."
"Pours a clear moderately dark red/brown tinted orange, thin eggshell colored head. Smell: quite sweet... peppery more than clove, very generic dark fruit (plum-ish, fig-ish). Taste: syrupy sweet, milk chocolate..ish, pepper, clove, tea leaf..ish. Muddled mess of a weizenbock. ST marketing department: the bomber may sell better when it says ""Imperial"" but when you're at the low end of the abv/etc for the style, you look like a jerk. ST has plenty of hits and their fair share of misses, this is among the latter."

"a nice banana like after taste. Very smooth going down.  Very tasty."
""
""
""
"The taste is also bready with a meaty fruit character and a bigger bitterness than I expected."
""
""
"I have great respect for Southern TIer, but this was a miss for me. I got some average bock flavors but no bananas as the label indicated. The label was far superior to the beer."
""
"I don't know why I don't like this beer, by all prospects and smell I should but it just tastes like I'm drinking a big prune dirt ball when I take a sip... maybe I got a bad batch or something..."

"Never had this type of beer before, but wasn't to bad"
""
"I don't think this holds up too well when compared with the best of this style.  There aren't many complex flavors, just very sweet and lots of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma caramel malt, brown sugar, faint spice & banana, bubblegum. Taste sweet malt, herbal, slight banana, spice, rye, dry finish. Ok!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A shade sweet for my taste, but loaded with delicious caramel flavor."
""

"Medium-ish body, effervescence is middle of the road, as well. Aftertaste fades really quickly, sadly. Finish is a bit harsh, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. Has a somewhat bitter aftertaste which I am not used to in this style of beer. This is a good to very good Weizenbock, but there are better ones than this."
""
""
"O: This is WAY better on draught; the banana and bread notes work better. In the bottle it gets muddled into this hot mess of flavors that don't work well together."
""
"O: Very banana and malt forward, so if you like the combo then this would be a great choice. Solid brew for sure"
""
""
"Dark orange in color with a ruby red hue and good clarity. Poured with a short light beige foam that reduced to a thick, sturdy cap. Fresh wheat bread and sweet banana aromas with hints of dark malt, dark fruit and a light touch of spice at the back end. Surprisingly, smooth, viscous feel up front with soft carbonation on the edges. Bready malt and banana flavors up front, dark fruit notes follow with tangy hoppiness on the edges. Spicy flavors arrive in the middle and slowly intensify to the end. Semi-dry finish, lightly crisp, with dark bread flavors and a lingering, spicy, peppery aftertaste. A wonderful balance of sweet and spice with a great feel. A great autumn style."
""
""
"Prost!"

"Overall: Except for the excessive sweetness, I might have rated this beer between 4.00 and 4.50.  I'll buy another bottle in the future to see if it has changed."
"pretty straight forward was expecting something a bit more unique. still a pretty solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like cloves, spiced bread, slightly earthy/funky yeast, and sweet. Tastes like cloves, sugar, toasted wheat bread, banana. Fairly sweet with the banana flavor really plowing through toward the end as it warmed. A lot of spices here. Also a very astringent taste. No noticeable hops. Slightly creamy/buttery. Very easy drinking and very average."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a very hazy orange amber with a one finger light tan head that dissipates to a thick cap with good lacing. Aroma of caramel, dark wheat, banana and clove. Flavor of lightly toasted wheat, caramel, banana clove, about as close to banana bread as I've ever had, with the only competition being Wells Banana Beer; this is more interesting. Finishes with mild hop and clove bitterness that lingers for a while. Medium bodied. A nice fruit forward weizenbock, with good caramel and clove. The sweetness is balanced by the drier clove finish. Southern Tier tends towards the sweet side in most styles, this one included, but that's to my taste; enjoyed this as much as any weizenbock I've had."

"Price Point - $6.99/22 oz bottle"

"Smells nice and hearty with a predominant smell of cloves. Pours a nice cloudy light brown with a slight tinge of red/orange and a nice head. Smells slightly sweet. Taste is fairly sweet at first which tames down quite bit after subsequent sips. Nice bitterness at the end. Strong clove taste and smell. Get a hint of banana and other spices. Has a nice funk to it also. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a brown body with one finger head that slowly died. Yeast is prevalent in the aroma, as is banana and other citric notes, some clove/spiciness and hints of sweet malts. Smooth, light body for style, good balance between a light sugary sweetness and the citric notes, especially the banana. Not typical of style, per se, and probably a beer that would grate on most people after awhile given the sweet and banana flavor aspects of this beer. However, for me it hit my sweet tooth and banana is my favorite fruit so this beer really hit the spot for me (that banana bread flavor they mention on the label, or something similar, is something I really liked in this beer)."
""
""
"O: Decent enough, but a bit expensive for what it is. I would have rather gotten a sample of it at Max's. This will make great pancakes (I siphon off 8 oz. of bombers to make pancakes, unless it is a really intense beer or I love it)."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/17/2014. Pours hazy deep ruby brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big banana, raisin, plum, apple, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big banana, raisin, plum, apple, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy clove spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, raisin, plum, apple, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn good weizen bock. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: A good weizenbock. I tend to like Southern Tier's bombers and this lives up to expectations. I will get this again if I want this style."

"Overall, a nice beer but not sure if its some I would have some then once in awhile. Glad to try it."

"A tad sweet, but very reminiscent of banana bread. Somewhat of a guilty pleasure beer."
""
"I'm on the fence whether I would want to try this again."
""
"O: Enjoyable but not great - I really enjoy most Southern Tier brews, especially the ones that are in the bombers but this one just was not as enjoyable as others in the style. Alcohol is well hidden and it is easy to drink, though it is a touch too sweet for me."
" Flavor has some malty sweet notes akin to a combo of rummy brown-bread and banana bread. It has a healthy amount of clove here, too, plus more hints of choco and soft, ripe banana. The finish has some florality which lingers well on the palate. Lastly, the 7.5% ABV is well-hidden here. All in all, an enjoyable weizenbock. Prosit!!"

"Pours a really interesting color. It looks like an overripe banana: brown in the center and a creamy yellow color at the edges. Light tan head that faded within 30 seconds to a thin collar. Aroma is heavy on the wheat and clove, some banana, some caramel. Taste is the same but with some nuttiness. Medium body and carbonation."

"Overall: A very solid imperial take on a Weizenbock. Good banana and yeast flavor with a nice dose of spice."
""
""
"Overall a very tasty Weizenbock a tad expensive for 8 bucks but other Southern Tier offerings are more expensive. Worth trying!"
"Overall a tasty and drinkable weizenbock. I used to not be a fan of german wheat beers, but beers like this are going to be my in-road."
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol essence on the finish was quite surprising since this is only a 7.5 ABV and ST is generally good at hiding the alcohol in their higher ABV beers."
""
""

"Overall: Once again, Southern Tier puts out another solid beer. I could revisit this one again."

"Medium body with a zesty spice presence up front that lingers over the sweeter notes, prominent yeast and citrus sweetness into a tart, dry finish. Lots of clove and other peppery spices up front followed by hints of sourdough bread, banana and citrus. Sweet malt backbone with caramel, toffee and light chocolate followed by zesty orange peel in the finish. Doesn't quite live up to the aroma but this beer is refreshing and easy to drink with some nice flavors. I would have preferred a little more malt sweetness/silky chocolate notes to counter the heavy spice and pithy citrus."
""
""

"The beer was clean, but I can not say crisp. I was waiting for something more to happen with the taste or with the finish, but none of this seem to be happening"
""

"I love it when you can really see the amount of sediment in an unfiltered beer. The appearance was a light hazel color with a fizzy head with bits of the sediment sticking to the side of the glass. The smell was sweet, almost banana, with almost a mint characteristic to the wheat smell. The taste was great. Full yet not too filling or overpowering. A lot of wheat and the end had a sweet taste about it from the amount of alcohol in it. Very refreshing despite it's weight. I didn't think there would be as many bubbles in a beer that felt this dense, but overall I thought this was a superb beer with a lot of great flavors and would definitely recommend for those who enjoy German or Belgium styles but wanted something a little different."
""
""
""

"The beer is an amber color with a short lasting head that leaves lacing once poured. The first smells that come to mind are of other banana nut bread and nutty malt. A very pleasing aroma. Once tasted the mouth feel was excellent with a medium body. Instantly the first flavor that hits you is banana, caramel, breading, malt, and slight hop. After another sip the hop edges its way in more but compliments the other flavors rather than overpowers them. I have to say this is a great Weizenbock and can compete with the German labels. Will buy again!"
""
""
"O: an interesting beer at a good price. if WF has any more of this in stock next time i'm there, i would pick up another bottle to see what a little aging does to this beer."
""
"Way to go, Southern Tier. Flavorful, tasty, odorous, and chewy. Impressed with this' un."
"O: Overall I was very impressed with this beer. There were many elements that were on par with a classic Weizenbock such as the light caramel flavors and papery taste along with some of the fruity esters that pop in and out. To me it seemed a lot like the imported varieties that I can buy. But, I feel that it is hopped a bit heavier than what you would find in a classic Weizenbock. This is obviously just how I perceive it but it seems like it was a more modern interpretation of the beer without sacrificing its heritage. It's a good beer to sit back at the end of the day and contemplate with."

"Overall – This was a rather tasty and big sweet weizen. I very much enjoyed this one and would certainly recommend it to others. Very tasty and easy drinking."
""
"Pours out a slightly cloudy deep ruddy brown, lighter at the bottom rand darker at the top. A thick creamy head holds its own and lasts a while. The aroma balances the Belgian yeast and bock malts. The taste is similar. It has a great weight and an awesome silky feeling. A great twist on spring Saisons and bocks"

"Pours into a weizen glass a hazed orange tinged tea brown with a thick creamy off white head atop that left some chunks of broken lace behind as it settled slowly.Yeasty and a little medicinal in the nose,some faint phenolic smoke-like notes are there as well.A creamy feel to the beer adds to the positives,flavors are yeasty with spiced notes and some sweetness,not much banana or chocolate wich you will find in alot of the style,the alcohol is kept in check pretty well.I love Southern Tier and I really like this style,I thought this beer was ""decent""."

"Lovely and traditional."
""
""
"Poured from bottle a ruby red with beautiful lacing and tight beaded bubbles. Caramel and banana on the nose with fresh baked bread. Excellent mouth feel with a mild copper tinged aftertaste that lingers. Bread and banana with great caramel notes. Beefy. Very nice and true to form, this is a winner of a weizenbock. Imperial by alcohol that would make any German envious. Great beer overall and will have it again."
"Quite typical of American brewers making classic European styles, the taste here is slightly muted, lacking the complexity or depth of Bavarian versions. Still, its sugary weight supersedes its malty-dry finish, causing the beer to wear on the palate unnecessarily."
""
""
""
""
""
"The banana flavor and aroma was too over powering even though I really enjoyed the way the beer finished as well as the way it drank. It poured really nicely almost a a dark Caramel color with a great head. But again all I smelt was banana and all I tasted was banana which isn't my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm impressed with this one. Not a style that many brewers tackle and Southern Tier does it justice. Perhaps it is not as well rounded as the German variants but it can still hold a candle."
""
""
""
""
"O- big lager with some interesting flavors and some off flavors. Sweet and sugary brew with some mineral like earthiness to it"
""
"O- A damn fine Weizenbock. This is one of my fav. styles and rates just below the German big boys for me. I will def. be picking up 2 or 3 more bottles."
