"Best American Weizenbock I've had to date. A touch too sweet and chewy but otherwise a great beer for the price. Neshaminy is really progressing nicely in the beer game"
""
"o: Some good stuff going on here, but this is a miss for me. Honey bock sounded good too."
"Overall, a bit sweet for my taste, but the flavors are interesting as it warms with deep sweet flavors and subtle banana."
"Nice to see this style on the US shores. A bit sweet, but even some of the German varieties are guilty of that. Dark brown body with near perfect beige head, thick and creamy, coats the glass. Aroma is sweet (raisins), taste is also led by the sweetness, but with the body of a decent hefeweizen nice and chewy. More sweetness on the finish."

"brown as cola, a bit muddy/foggy. aromas of nutmeg, some dark fruit. roasty malt notes, wheat, brown sugar, fresh dark fruits, raison. its a treat, another solid brew"
""
"O- Reasonably enjoyable brew by Neshaminy. Can't wait until Punkel Dunkel comes out again in the fall!"
""
"Overall: this weizen bock has a decent flavor and was slow sipping."
""
"Dark raisin brown in color with deceptive opaqueness. Poured with a rich, off-white foam with respectable retention. Sweet malt aromas were prominent with earthy, ripe, dark fruit in the background. On the heavier side of medium bodied with rich, somewhat aggressive, pleasantly tangy, carbonation.Sweet caramel and wheat malt flavors up front followed by earthy, herbal hop bitterness that slowly builds through the middle to the end. Ripe, raisin and dark fruit flavors throughout. Finished semi-dryly with a earthy hop tanginess followed by a sweet  bready, yeasty aftertaste. Dangerously drinkable considering the +8 abv. Certainly an under-appreciated style."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, chocolate, a bit of honey. Taste is malty, bready, a hint of chocolate, alcohol is well hidden, Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"Overall –A fruity and sweet Weizenbock with nice big and thick flavors and a great feel. This is an enjoyable and robust brew that is nice for the cooler winter weather."
"This is the best weizenbock from a US craft brewery I've had so far. It has the banana fruity esters, sweet malt, rum, and dark fruits along with a signature hint of honey. In addition, this complex bock has coffee, dark chocolate, burnt wood and friendly hop finish that does not destroy all of the other great flavors. Similar to the Neshaminy Creek Dunks Ferry Dunkelweizen times two or the Punkel Dunkel without the pumpkin or spices, this is exactly what I had hoped for in their weizenbock. Definitely more intense than an Ayinger, and more charred oak intensity than an Erdinger Pikantus. I will be drinking this whenever I can find it."
