3.74,-12.8,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"The beer pours a slightly opaque dark amber (more viscous than cloudy), with no head or sediment. The nose has an off-putting amount of fruity acetone upfront with candi sugar and oak doing little to entice. The taste has a similar nail polish quality, but more tartness and is made drinkable only by a modest brown sugar sweetness that comes in on the back end. It's medium bodied and mildly carbonated with fruity sweetness the lingering element in its semi-dry finish. There is minimal bitterness, but alcohol slowly creeps in for a warming effect. Honestly, this has been a let down for me considering the difficulty it was to track down and seemingly promising ratings.","ThePorterSorter","Feb 21, 2015"

Allagash continues to impress with their higher-end beers, with bold and complex flavors. It smells great and it drink just as satisfyingly. I didn't get the funk that others did--something I noticed with most old ales. Instead, I got an appealing sour and tart taste that is balanced by the right amount of heat.

The taste is nicely tart with a light fruitiness â€“ strawberry and raspberry, followed by funkiness and more sour notes. Thereâ€™s a slight buttery flavor as well, but very faint. Finishing with a pleasant oaky dryness, this beer hits all the right spots. Thereâ€™s a lot of alcohol at nearly 9% but itâ€™s very well hidden and it drinks wonderfully. The carbonation level is quite good. Thereâ€™s not much lacing on the glass but the head is retained very well as I drink. This is the first sour Iâ€™ve had from Allagash and it does not disappoint.","greenmtn1111","Sep 10, 2013"

4.5,4.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottled 12-21-2012. Picked up a bottle at the brewery tasting room. Served in a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white surface coat of head. Some very small bubbled carbonation activity throughout the body. Aromas of tart berry and cherry sweetness, with a touch of booze, some woody characteristics, and a sour highlight. Very balanced and robust nose. Flavors are rich and tart cherry on the forward tongue, with a sour tang throughout. Wood character balances more as the beer travels the palate, ending with an almost wine-like feel at the end of each drink. The carbonation and thin body lead to an effervescent feel in mouth, with a crisp, almost bubbly finish. The tartness builds slowly in mouth, with an underlying cherry sweetness. Very fruity and very crisp, with bold notes of sour and tart. Tremendous representation of the style.","GarthDanielson","Jun 18, 2013"

4.14,-3.5,4.25,4.5,4,4,4,"375ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash chalice at 55 degrees. Pours a dull copper with just the slightest haze. Head is 3/4's of an inch, bright white and rocky. As it dissipates into a soapy slick, delicate, textured, concentric bands of lacing are revealed. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution and also adhering to the walls of the glass. What a great nose on this beer - tannic, tart, some vinegary notes, all reminiscent of a flanders red or oud bruin. I also get a suggestion of cherry Sucrets. Taste follows nose; however, there's a slightly medicinal quality to the flavor profile and some vanilla notes come out as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light-medium. Carbonation is minimal, but the acidity gives quite a bit of character. There's also a trace of creaminess to the texture and the finish is quite dry. Overall, more of a Flanders Red/Oud Bruin in style than what I have come to associate with an American Wild. Enjoyable, but for the price point, I'd go with a Rodenbach Grand Cru.","Jwale73","May 30, 2013"

3.72,-13.3,4.5,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"The beer pours a ruddy orange/red with a big tight creamy yellow/white head of tiny, small packed bubbles. In body the beer appears clean but hazy with lots of bubbles racing to replenish the head. On the nose, the beer smells of funky cherry fruit leather with a smell resting below these scents and adding a malty backbone to the yeast funk. There is a touch of deep funk in this beer as well that I canâ€™t decide if I like it or notâ€¦ It is prickly on the nose with hints of pineapple, then pine, and then compost, but it is not particularly displeasing, just a little odd. On the tongue, the beer tastes funky acidic and then very oddly bitter. At first I thought I might have an infected bottle, but as I let the beer sit and I sipped it more, some of the off flavors, oddly, mellowed out and the beer became not bad. I have had this beer before on tap, however, and it was far fruitier and more interesting then. In flavor the beer begins with tart green apple but then opens into weird grassy bitter and pear and apricot notes, with funky cherry fruit leather thrown in. The beer then mellows out into smooth malty brown sugar notes with light caramel and funky notes thrown in. Throughout the taste, the bitter occasionally become unappetizingly medicinal with a touch of compost added in, which takes away from the taste. The tart green apple flavors seem to linger in the mouth throughout the taste and then return in the aftertaste to leave a nice pucker along with a lingering bitter medicinal flavoring. In the mouth the beer feels on the heavier side of light with prickly carbonation that is soft and fluffy except for its bite. The mouth is left puckering and oddly bitter with a weird saltiness as well. There is a decent amount of saliva filling the mouth to neutralize the acid. Overall, this is a weird beer. I donâ€™t think this one held up as well in the bottle, and I probably wouldnâ€™t spend the money on it. This is an alright beer but it has off tastes and a weird, chemically bitterness that gets better but is never that great on the tongue. That being said, I only realized now that this beer is 8.9% alcohol, which is impressive. This is an interesting beer. If Allagash can perfect bottling what they served on tap for this beer, then it will be amazing, but as it is, it falls short. An okay beer that I would like to see improve.","Maxwell","May 21, 2013"

I would rate it higher if not for the slightly astringent aftertaste (I am particularly sensitive to this in some Brett beers). I would recommend this to a friend, but at $1/oz.

I started drinking it slightly chilled in the fridge, where the sour notes were prevalent, allowing the slight effervescence to play on the tongue.

Quite acidic flavor-wise...tart fruit, oak, spicy sharpness, some tannins, and a pleasant sweetness. Dry, yet slick, medium body and no trace of alcohol. A little rough around the edges, but still very tasty and well-crafted in the Flanders style. I have to wonder if they were to blend this with a younger beer, if everything would smooth out and take this to the next level.","wedge","Mar 28, 2013"

4.13,-3.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"D - The heavy oak character gives this a more American spin, and it's not quite as sweet as something like Rodenbach. I enjoyed this, and it's nice to see that the quality has been maintained, or even increased, as Allagash expands their wild program. Would happily drink this again.","MasterSki","Mar 27, 2013"

The cherry / wine nose and flavors were great for not having added anything like that. I hope eventually the price comes down, I would definitely we willing to pay $12-14 for a 750ml, but for a 375ml it feels kinda steep.","jrstamp","Mar 14, 2013"

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, funk, subtle tartness, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, funk, earth, fruit, and subtle tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I was really glad to see this one show up at the festival as the reviews Iâ€™ve read on this one as it all sounded really good. While this one was solid for the style, it didnâ€™t quite deliver like I would have hoped. Still very nicely done and glad I got the chance to try this one on tap.","thagr81us","Mar 08, 2013"

3.38,-21.2,4.5,4,3,3,3.25,"Pours a rich burgundy going into mahogany, with a small white head. Smells of sour cherries, green apple, oak. First flavors that hit your tongue are unripe apple, cooking spices, with a sherry finish. There is a little funk here, light barnyard, hay, biscuit and bread flavor. The finish is harsh. Cloying acetic quality burns the back of your throat. This is not a jaw cramping sour but more of a slow heartburn quality. Vomit flavor? Mouthfeel is fine, its certainly not viscous or vinuous. Carbonation is ok. The tour guide said it best when he described when he would have this beer: ""I could drink one glass, with a friend, in front of a fire, while discussing Chomsky.""","Brewsephus","Mar 05, 2013"
