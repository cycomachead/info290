"Sour up front with a dry finish. Some unpleasant cheddar in the finish. Good, but not among the best."

"Bottle: Poured a hazy blonde color ale with a medium size foamy head with limited retention and not much lacing. Aroma of tart and oak notes with some light funky ester is quite nice. Taste is also dominated by tart and oak notes with some funky ester with low level of acidity. Hops presence had pretty much disappeared which is no surprised considering the age of the bottle. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Quite complex beer that retained some good drinkability."

"Very nice sour beer. Pours a nice amber beer, and really has little head. Smell is very subdued and yes, you can tell it has those funky agents in it. Taste is great. Not overly sour, but sour enough. Has a bit of dryness toward the end. Lots of fruits involved. Light beer also."

"A very oaky wild ale, heavy on the vanillin. IMHO, not up to the usual quality of JK."

"O: An amazing beer from one of the sickest breweries and friendliest brewers in America. True fact. This is a refreshing and surprisingly drinkable brew for a 10.2% abv tag. Does not seem like it at all. That in itself is amazing. but regardless, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you can buy a bottle or two, or at least sample any JK beer, DO IT!"

"Nice copper color with a big foamy head and decent lacing. The nose on this brew is strong and has a lot of sourness right out of the gate with a some funk; some oak and maybe some tart citrus rind, grass/hay, earthy. The flavor kicks like a mule though and is face-melting sour...but in a good way! This is a massively sour ale with plenty of funk and on the finish some more subtle notes of the farm, earth, grass and hay. A delicious beer, but I am glad I had help with this bottle!"
"Overall, I loved this beer. If you like sours, you'll love this one."

"The beer is light copper with ample head. A bit of a gusher. Served at cellar temp, so maybe best to chill this a bit prior to opening. The aroma offers funk, oak, white wine, earth, residual citrus. Champagne and white wine notes amid an earthy, grainy body. Very nice. A great afternoon sipping beer, which is exactly what I did. Dry finish with lingering funk. Very enjoyable."

"Overall this is a great beer, not as outstanding as the Oi Oi in my opinion but the interplay between the hops and wild yeast is pretty incredible."

"The beer pours a tarnished copper that gushes thick foamy white head from the bottle, but settles into a residual thin halo around the perimeter. There's decent lacing and some flecks of sediment on the bottom. Buttery whiskey and vinous oak presence upfront, funky citrus, and some booze dominate the nose. However, the beer's citrusy tartness is amplified in the taste, leaving a strange orange juicy concentrate mix of spirit barrel caramel/vanilla and tannin bitterness. This beer is thick, medium bodied with modest bitterness, citrusy sweetness, a distinct alcohol presence towards the finish, and residual bitter/semi-sweet finish. The beer definitely reminds me of bottleworks 14 from cascade, and I'd say this is safely in second by comparison."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a great brew. Definitely quite the acquired taste (wife hated it, you better like sour and funky!) but I dug it!"
"Boxers Revenge is a masterfully blended ale that doesn't push the barrel aging too far but allows them to make a meaningful mark upon the ale with nuances of both wine and whisky. Despite its complexity, it's a highly palatable ale that is begging for cedar plank salmon and pecan pie!"

"unique brew here, even in the out there context of wilds anyway, this is just different. tons of yeast floaters snowglobe style in a hazy brown amber liquid with an inch of thick white head and an aroma of heavy whiskey barrels and farmy yeast. fruity notes, apples and pears, give it a sweetness, while bacterial sour notes dry it out. as far as the flavor goes, its complex as anything and well built, but im not sure the right barrel was chosen to compliment the beer itself. i miss the subtle pucker and malt balance. i get a ton of vanilla, and it clashes with the sour a bit. getting more and more funky as it warms, the alcohol strength remains well hidden, a real impressive feature of this slightly confused but very intriguing brew. fuller bodied for a sour type, and not quite as well carbonated, but the feel works fine. overall this is a one of a kind beer, but for 16 bucks a bottle its not good enough for me to justify another bottle."
""

"A wonderfully aromatic sour.; definitely one of the fruit forward(without having actual fruit added) that I've ever smelled. Unfortunately, most of the fruity aromatics are not carried over in taste; Most of the juicy, tropical yeast driven characteristics that are there in taste initially, are quickly overwhelmed by barrel presence and hop character. This is a very unique sour beer."

"Flat, malty, not very sour or funky just kind of odd and inappropriately sweet. So different from last bottle I had."
""
""
""
""

"O - This is delicious and wonderful. Tart but still retains that distinct Jester King funk from the yeast. I could probably spend more time trying to discern some of the flavors, but I'd rather just enjoy without thinking about it too much."

"Previously, from Tap: This pours a ruddy ruby-amber color with thin lacing. It has an incredible aroma, amazingly tart and sour with an incredible flavor and a funky, dry finish. I get an assertive mouthpuckering tartness up front and a sharp intensity of tastes which cut like a samurai’s blade. No hint of it’s ABV even as it warms. Fantastic! Utterly delicious!"
""
""
""
"A pretty well rendered affair, with so much exploratory brewing prowess, all of which falls suitably in line. Woody, funky, fruity, and rather pleasantly not boozy - that, mis amigos, is the most newsworthy effect here, amongst stiff competition. Totally worthy of investigating - ok, drinking carefully, should you get the chance."

"O - I was expecting a flavour bomb given the ABV. Nope, think subtle and complex. And dry. Not my first Jester King and i suspect won't be buying any more due to over-dry finish across their range. I disagree with suggested serving temp of 50-55, seems to be best chilled."
"The brew is aged in oak whiskey and wine barrels with multiple strains of wild yeast and bacteria and exudes a rustic earthiness as soon as you open the bottle. The beer holds a myriad of flavors that meld into a wonderful and unique experience. You can definitely pick up the whiskey and wine oak aging on top of the funky sourness and earthy barnyard qualities. Wrapping all these flavors is a hop blanket that weaves in and out of all the flavors and lingers on your palate. This is just an all around fantastic beer. None of the flavors overpower you, the sour fruits and barnyard funk hit the right notes with the hoppy bitterness and oak keeping everything in tune. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for such a high ABV brew and opening my palate to a larger world of sour and funky beers."

"Got in a trade with Cyde. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy orange amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big orange zest, lemon zest, pear, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, clove, oak, floral, white wine, grass, pepper, bread, funk, light caramel, and spicy yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of hop, yeast, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, pear, grapefruit, clove, oak, pepper, floral, white wine, grass, light caramel, herbal, funk, and spicy yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pear, pineapple, peach, clove, oak, pepper, white wine, floral, funk, and spicy yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and barrel flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with an acidic, moderately crisp, slick, and earthy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop, barrel, and yeast/brett flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for being over 10%. A very enjoyable offering."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is boozy yet the barrel quakity is evident and interesting. I am typically distracted and find high alcohol in wild beers to be clashing. However, it really worked in this brew."

"Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku. Poured a vibrant yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount vey slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange zest, citrus, orange soda, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, funk, citrus, orange zest, orange, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The orange note I picked up on in this one was really quite nice and made this one quite easy to drink. The funk was definitely present throughout the glass which was very well incorporated in all aspects. This one was quite easy to drink and refreshing. Definitely a well done brew that I am glad that I got the chance to try and would love to do so again."
""
"This is a strange beer... The previous sentence loses some significance considering I've pretty much said the same thing about every single Jester King beer. Personally, I think this is somewhere between an American Wild and an American Saison. There's a lot of wood, white wine, tart, funk, and barrel in here. Definitely worth a checking out."
"Decent. Not the best offering I've had from Jester King, but complex. A bit muddled in terms of the barrel and yeast influence."

"Pretty tasty wild ale with a tartness that wasn't overboard and a funkiness that wasn't too crazy either. Just a nice blend of the two that's sure to please any fan of the style. I will say, the heaviness of the booze eventually started to take a toll on my palate; this beer would be difficult to drink in large quantities. Luckily, I had someone to split it with, but even a 12 oz pour was quite a bit. Good beer, but better in smaller quantities for sure."
"O – This is a nice beer that really lives up to the title of a wild farmhouse ale. It’s just tart enough with the great accents of different yeast and different barrel flavors. Really tasty and seriously drinkable for 10.2% ABV. Jester King strikes again."
""
""
"Pours a golden hue with a creamy two finger ever present head and lacing everywhere,the smell is vinegar,white bait,Brett,farmhouse funk and herbal hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,dry with moderate carbonation and the taste is wow it definitely could not be explained in one word but it does have tastes of funky vinegar,Brett,tangerine,herbal earthy hops,lemon and finishes with a sour dry tartness and overall I love it basically a wild imperial pilsner and ill be buying more cheers."
""
"Overall - Complex but not in the best way all the time. Forgivable though."

"Pours yellow, bright and cloudy, with a fizzy, champagne-like head on top. Smells of citrus, tropical fruits, some white wine, and heavy, tart wild yeast aromas. Funky and delicious. The flavor follows the nose fairly well, some apple, mango, pineapple, grapefruit... all of which is wrapped in sour, funky wild action. Very flavorful, alcohol well hidden amongst a plethora of the sweet and the sour. Mouthfeel is light to medium, with bright, active carbonation keeping it interesting. Overall a satisfying, unique, wild beer."
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens with a slightly sour, sweet white wine flavor. Some fairly complex malt and wood flavors with a dash of brett. Faint hints of citrus, tropical fruit and barrel. A nice dry finish with a touch of wood and more funk. A really interesting beer. Dry but sweet. Tart but smooth. Big in alcohol, but light on the mouthfeel. Really good stuff."
""
"Ahhh, I've been waiting for a beer this sour from LK for quite some time; its fairly puckering. Not as clean of sour flavor as a Cantillon, but still drinks quite nice. A little bit of woody character comes out from the time spent in barrels (I get more wine barrel than whiskey) along with a hint of brett. Mouthfeel definitely could use some more carbonation. This is a pretty darn good beer now, but I am excited to see how it progresses as JK gets better at blending. Im amazed a beer this light in malt and body can cover such a high alcohol with ease."
"O: Yet again, Jester King has made a big, likeable beer. Drinkable."
""
""
""
"Cloudy yellow with a thin small white foam layer, JK nailed the color. On the nose a light lemon tartness, grass and hay, downplayed sour. Lightly sweet citrus flavors, lemon tart sweetness similar to a lemon square desert, alcohol is completely hidden. JK's has accomplished what I have been waiting for from a Texas brewery or any brewery for that matter someone who can regularly put an excellent sour/saison on a Texas shelf."
""
""
"D - Great sour beer. Fantastic overall complexity and balance."
""
"O - I'm really excited to see this brewery available to me in such variety. I have had several of their beers, and they are all very good and distinct, in their take on standard styles. This was no exception. I really enjoyed this beer. I think part of my problem was that I was expecting it to be sour since in my mind all wild ales are, and that just simply isn't true. The wild yeast they use is very distinctive and very nice."
""

""

"O: My first beer from Jester King, and needless to say I am impressed. So complex, yet so drinkable. I would have preferred a little more sour kick, but Im just nit picking. This beer is awesome. Highly recommend."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some malt, wine, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with a nice acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty damn good I would say, has a decent about of alcohol so you will feel good after knocking back a bottle. A good sour taste but it's not overly sour, would seek out again if it was easily found in Houston. Would like to see if aging has any changes in flavor."
"Thanks, mhenson42, for the opportunity"
""
""
""
""
"Overall. An interesting, higher abv wild with some good sour citrus going on. Pretty easy to drink and at this abv, feeling pretty fine already. Digin' it."
""
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Hazy peached colored with residual white head. Its' smell is more bit of light citrus and some funk. Sourness is definitely there with funky and citrus hops. I can sense that there is some of brett into this really great sour beer. I definitely look forward to its' next release next year."
""
""
""
"Have yet to really be impressed by a Jester King beer. This one is so close. I'd love to try a version that leaves out the whiskey barrels. I feel the base flavor profile and the wine barrels create a delicious combo, but the whiskey butts in at the end and completely clashes leaving an muddied aftertaste and overall lowering the enjoyment of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Again another great beer from Jester King. This is a must buy when you see it. I would have liked it to have a bit more depth to it, maybe a little more sweetness, but it was still excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- This was a good beer. It was unique, well crafted and very flavorful. I enjoyed the duality of the treatments but I think the ABV and body needed to come down a couple touches. I would say this might get better and I might wanna go find a couple more bottles."
""
""
"O: A very good sour ale, not too heavy given the ABV and perfect for the aperitif for instance. I would love to get more of this!"
""
""
"D: Very drinkable for a sour, goes down easily and hides it’s 10% ABV easily"
"O - Tart and funky, not much carbonation, but still nice."
"Overall: This was a really interesting sour. Lots of complexity. I really enjoyed the wine notes very much. I don't think the whiskey added much here. I would definitely have another bottle of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a pretty good beer but there's so many better sours out there."
""
""
""
"O- Good sour, not too complex but no complaints either"
""
""
"O: Sampled Boxer's at the brewery, was happy to pick up a bottle. I like the elevated hop presence compared to other sours I've had. Glad to have access to a quality local sour."
""
"M: Medium bodied. Good carbonation but not overly."
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice. A very nice American made sour, with great tartness, sour fruit flavors, good acidity and tannins, and lots of buttery vanilla oak to round it all off. And a big abv that is hidden well as lots of booze is hard to go with sours."
""
""
"O - Probably my favorite Jester King offering so far, would love to see their dream of this becoming a year round on Texas shelves become a reality."
""
""
""
"O: Good overall. One of my Favorite Jester King beers"
""
"O. As far as I recall I had three of these at the Draught House, and I can't even remember if it was served in pints or tulips or Jester King goblets. All I know is it was one of the most refreshing beers I've tasted in a long time and I couldn't get enough of it. Good job I was going home on the bus that night and didn't have to go to work next morning."
"The pour is a light straw color with a white head. Very lactic aroma with tons of lemon and lemon zest. A bit of straw, lightly tropical, and maybe some other citrus notes. Very mild oak. High acidity on the palate with lots of tart lemon and green apple flavors. Hints of tropical fruit and oak, minimal funk, and straw."
"Overall: Simply put…I really dig this beer. The flavor starts off tart and simple, but becomes more complex through the middle, wrapped up again in simplicity by the end. Another very solid offering from JK!"
""
""
"O: very interesting beer, strong flavoring mainly dominated by the sourness, will definitely try again"
""
"O - Another great offering from Jester King. Boxer's revenge is a wild ale/sour that delivers a ton of flavor without being too sour and leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth. I really enjoyed this beer and I am looking forward to seeing how this beer ages."

"I like it. Never had a beer from this brewery before, and I'd definitely be open to try more. this particular beer I wouldn't go through too much effort to seek out, but its an enjoyable quaff."
"Can't wait for the second batch of this to come out. An improved level of carbonation could give this beer quite the face lift it needs. It has a great flavor profile working for it as is."
""
"O: My favorite Wild Ale to date due to its high level of drinkability and surprisingly complex flavor. I WANT MORE!!!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Easy drinking for 9%, nice amount of sour notes, and a nice dry finish. Enjoyed this one for sure, and would buy another bottle if I have the chance."
""
""
"the rare find as most american sours seem to be. whiskey and wine barrel aged. sour with a wonderful nose and a sour mash whiskey quality to it. nose is sauvignon blanc, funk, and hint of melon and horseblanket undertones. palate is actually much more sour than expected. quite bright. but balanced. very dry with that sour whiskey mash note and hints of whiskey noted coconut. nice buttering that comes forth grassy... wonderful. one to share."
""
"Poured from bottle into JK farmhouse glass. When opened, barely even a hiss. Notably lacking carbonation. With a little bit of a rough pour, some head rises off the top of the beer, but it goes away quickly. This beer is indeed flat-ish. Other than that, a nice orange/yellow color, with some cloudiness. Smell- tart and sweet, nice vinous aroma from the barrel. Some funky bouquet as well. Taste- puckering sour with a salty dry finish. Tastes like sea salt meets sour patch candy. No ABV is present at all, for 9% it is well hidden. With carbonation, this would have been way better, but still a nice effort from JK, albeit not my fav sour from them (Das Wunderkind)."
""
""
"Boxer's Revenge is a great beer and a welcome addition to the Texas sour ale scene, but like the angry horse on its label, it hasn't yet made up its mind as to the direction it's heading. Still, I'm very much excited to see what path it takes."

"d - good, but it is a bit winey sweet, like a very fruity white wine. It has an overall refined profile, the flavor are interesting and unusual but seems carefully balanced. The wild yeast is kept in check, not too much earthy medicinal funk."
"I really love this. Again, well done Jester King. Just an excellent Saison. I am not sure if I like this as much as Boulevard's Saisons at the moment, but I would hate to live on the difference. Highly recommended."
"D - This is dangerously drinkable for the ABV, well done Jester King."
"Drinkability is fairly good. Not being a particular fan of sours, the tart qualities are mild and tolerable for me!"
"A very nice saison, I just wish it was a little bit funkier."
"This was a good beer, but I think with some more effort and time it could be great. Come on Jester King, hit the funk out of the park!"
