"Really delicious. It's extremely tart, but the cherries come through on the backend and this is very drinkable."

"One of a large number of samples I had at the Extreme Beer Fest in Boston 3/21/32014. Great sour and cherry flavors!"
""
""
"Excellent mouth puckering sour with an awesome cherry aroma.  Not picking up much of the wine barrel aging, just some hints of must in the nose.  Delicious malty backbone and  very subtle oak in the finish."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, smooth and thin feeling with very mild carbonation that is a little fizzy on the tongue and fades off sweet and sour. A really enjoyable beer overall and one I will definitely have again."
""
""
""
"Wow! Sooooouuuurrrrr!!!!?? I'm not sure how I feel!"

"O: This is a good example of how some US breweries are bring it now, very close to their Belgian fore-fathers. This is a top-notch Kriek, hands down. I'm big on this beer. It has a low-coarse carb feel, but the texture and flavors balance that out to create something very similar to GI Loloita. I will search this out again."

"O- Pretty good wild, not one that ranks among the best but it's very tasty in its own right. It has that house yeast flavour, but at the same time it's a bit more complex than their usual offerings. It's a poor man's Consecration, I think- less complexity and more tartness."
""
""
"Beautiful reddish hue not really much head to the beer. Kind of a funky aroma, maybe a little sulfur. Not the best of aromas, but as the head dissipates there is a tart red wine aroma with some subtle sweetness too it. Very lip puckering sour, tart cherry flavor. Nice and dry very light on the tongue. The puckering sour goes away and mellows out as glass becomes half empty but still just sour cherry on the flavor that's it. I don't get any of the wine barrel on the flavor just the aroma."
""
""
"Orange-brown translucent. Really nice nose. Tart fruit, soft, acidic finish. Really pleasant finish. Nice overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great nose, weird color but you can taste the cherries"
"Overall: Very solid sour. I would definitely seek this on out in the future."
"O: Not bad, had a Belgian Flanders Red ale that was really good, this didn't measure up, I was expecting more cherries since they were added, did not pick them up, will try more Almanac sours in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Batch No 3 - Another great sour from Almanac."
""
""
"Overall:  A decent, but fairly one dimensional sour; not among the best Almanacs I have sampled"
""

"The taste of this beer missed for me...Seemed a bit flat and not very sour."

"Really good sour, in the RR consecration mold (only slightly less tasty)."
""
""
""
""
"Rusted gold, outer lining of fine white head. Tart cherries, no funk, muted vanilla. Smooth malty sourness. Very approachable."
""
""
"After this beer and Bourbon Sour Porter I am extremely impressed by the sour ales brewed by these guys. Delicious job!"
"Overall, very tart and acidic cherry sour.  Not as good as I remember from on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"8 oz. draft. Fine wild ale!"
""
"This is a fun beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite assertively sour, cherries are present but don't become overwhelming. Really nice American sour."
""
""
"Definitely could taste the cherries.  Would definitely drink again!"
"Overall a very good beer that is super sour; very good and very mouth puckering. More complexity and sourness in the taste; if you like big sours definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
"375ml poured into a snifter. The brew appears a beautiful clear orange color with a white fizzy cap. The smell is mildly bretty and vinous with some oaky barrel and cherry skin/pits. The taste is all the same with some alcohol warmth and slight herbal bitterness. This is medium bodied, effervescent carbonation and overall real nice stuff."
""
"t/m/o - the sour slaps you in the face gives your mouth a quick tight pucker and then settles into that lush cherry found in the nose.  super solid brew.  Feel is a bit fizzy and prickly and there is a definite ""I am gonna need tums"" to the sourness, but dat cherry.  Worth checking out for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Puckering sourness. Short finish. Decent cherry flavor with only a touch of sweetness. This is delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste was also puckeringly sour, maybe an 8/10 on my sourness scale. Indistinct fruit in the background, very citric and sour upfront, short lived in the finish. Spritzy and medium bodied. It was pretty good though not something i'd probably get again. Needs more nuance and fruit character."

"i like this better than the other fruited variants of it. its gritty in texture, almost dirty earthy. dense and just a little pink. its sour beer first, fruity second, with the cherry putting in about as much as the red wine barrel, really cool. wild sourness lacto maturity and a lot of malt character in this, wheaty and a hint sweet. Cherry is just in the finish, and the red wine tannins exacerbate the dry pucker. Acidity is high, oak character is prominent, and the overall quality of this is enormous. Rad to have it on tap too. Thanks to hops and pie for that. More bubbles would make it feel perfect, but I like the light prickly and dry density. World class no doubt. amazing to me that this and the cerise sour are both cherries in red wine, but this is such a flavorful and honestly superior use of those ingredients comparatively. its really excellent."

"Overall: very drinkable and refreshing sour.  Most of the elements are, if not subtle, then employed with a sophisticated restraint.  Very nice."
""

""

"Very tart and sour upfront. Once you get past that some sweet cheery and bready yeasty flavors come through. There are some red wine properties just shy of and in the finish. I get a slight vinegar backbone that is present throughout, from start to finish. I've had few sours such as Consecration by RR (on tap), but definitely not a sour expert. Looking for that one that will convert me to the sour side. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Good brew. Complex. Respect. Just not for me."

"A clear copper brew. Nose is subtle but the flavor is incredibly tart, acidic and delicious. Notes of tart cherry, oak, plastic and vinegar. The sour never really lets up. Feel carries the flavor perfectly. Aggressive, crisp and finishes puckering. Certainly worth having."

"Okay, it's not that bad, but it may be the most sour beer I have ever had. Since Almanac is saying this a Flanders Red, I have to say ti does not stack up favorably in either flavor or price to the reigning kings of the style."

"The beer pours a tarnished copper color with a dense population of floating particulates and no head after settling. The nose is funky cherries carried by some syrupy sweetness, grain, and a hint of ethanol. The taste is aggressively tart cherries upfront followed by chewy yeast and lingering malt and cherries in the finish. This is a potent sour that finishes with bone dry cherry-lime acidity, minimal acetone, modest complexity, chewy yeast, negligible carbonation, and a distinct cherry presence throughout. Although this is not my favorite almanac it's still a great sour that doesn't disappoint."

"375ml bottle purchased for $10.99 which was a little pricey for a brewery I'm not familiar with. Light orange color, no head really. Aroma is the mildest hint of strawberries, nothing like an oudbeitje, touch of malt and and brett. Flavor was easily identified as a wild ale but the strawberries just were not there for me. Overall it felt overpriced for the quality and not much better than the farmer's reserve blackberry."
""
""
""
"Overall- Really nice Flanders style ale. Cherry is awesome in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very clean and easy drinking. Just the right amount of sour and sweet. Not the most complex, but extremely enjoyable."
""
""

"As great as the nose is, the palate is better. Bursting with juice, fleshy sweet and sour cherries, cherry skin tannins and a wonderfully complementary red wine vinegar note, this is brilliant stuff. The mid palate brings in flavors of honey, a little sugar, vanilla and oak. The funk is moderate and similar in character to the other Almanac sours I've had - earthy, damp hay - but this time around, the fruit character dominates it easily. There is also that characteristic malt flavor, rustic, earthy, mildly oxidized even, but it is not particularly intrusive on the palate. Medium light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer finishes long, juicy, tart and refreshing. Highly recommended."

"Overall crazy, but great. So much acidity with different acids, great cherry, but very very little wine barrel. Gotta remember to take my tums. I do wish the barrel notes were a bit bigger."
""
""
"O: Wow, not at all what I was expecting but in a good way. Poured very nicely, looked great. Smelled very strongly of lactic acid with cherry and hints of barrel and then the taste comes through with this impressive wave of apple cider. Great flavor profile. So much going on here. Not unbalanced. Can't really find the barrel in the flavor because the combination of yeasts and bacterium develop so many individual flavors. This is impressive. Great brew. Thanks for sharing!"
"Good but not one I'd have regularly."

"Batch 2. Pours a hazy, golden color. Medium white head that sticks around for a bit. Scent is probably the most funky of all of the Almanac Farm to Barrel beers. Lots of funk, with sour cherry skin on the nose. A hint of vinegar, but mostly some musky, funky, cherry aromas. Great nose on this one. Taste is just as good. The funk lives on through the flavor. Barnyard wheat and hay with sour wine-like flavors. Lots of sour cherry. Mouthfeel is somewhat juicy, with a bit of dryness in the finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this batch is better than I remembered from batch 1. The cherries seem to be more complementary to the beer, and it seems to be a bit more sour. Glad I bought a few of these."
""
""

"Pours a cloudy brown hued amber. Nose is a biting funky thing. The flavor on this is superb! I started going for a sip, which turned into more. And then some more. Very easy to drink and refreshing. Yet it has the earthy funk, mild old fruits, and lactic on the back - and no short supply of it either. This is well done. Carbonation is a bit high as some of the others of this series have been, but who cares. I could drink a gallon of this."
"O - Very sour, and refreshing, yet lacks the wood character, complexity and funk which make for a more interesting brew."
"O: Good level of sourness, enjoyed quite a bit. Could definitely go for more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid, straightforward sour ale, similar to a Flanders oud bruin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really liked this beer as a whole. It was a new experience that left me wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is a murky deep orange with a thin white head. Nose has a bit of wood, dusty with a hint of mushroom and a light cherry. Very sour, a bit acetic, strong carbonation and a light body. Dusty brett and faint mushroom funk with some tart unripened cherry. Assertive sourness and some acetic acid in the finish but not much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very prominent and enjoyable stonefruit notes (e.g., plum). Maybe just a bit of brett funk on the nose, but not much, if any, in the taste. Easy to drink. Not overly complex for a sour beer, but quite nice."

"Once you get past the initial lip-puckering tartness, this becomes a refreshing and tasty American wild ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens tart with lemon, white wine and rolling waves of tart red cherry over the palate. Slight bit of oak, lemon seed and pink grapefruit. A long lingering tartness lasts forever. I like this a lot."

"Taste had tart cherries up front with some sweetness and funk after. The flavor was nothing like the smell. Very good sour, very alike to the other recent releases."
""
""
"As much as I love sour ales, this one may be a little too tart. The cherry flavors are lovely and the subtle apple tones come out if you slurp it. it is a perfectly dry beer. The smell is very enticing. This is a bold and interesting American sour ale."

"O: Tasty, and definitely nails the mark with big tart cherry flavor. I was a little surprised that the wine barrel character was only a bit player in this show. But still, very tasty. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this beer is exceptional. It's hellactiously sour but the flavors of the beer do manage to poke through."
""

"O-The balance was rather good, a solid sour. It could have used more complexity but the flavors that were there were good and balanced together."

"O - Overall, this was a solid wild ale. Quite sour, wish there was more sour cherry notes in this though."
""

"Bottle from George. Thanks buddy! Pours a murky red-orange color with very little head that dissipates to a ring on the glass pretty quickly. Bit sour vinegar aroma with lots of sweet cherries and a hint of brown sugar. Nice nose on this. Flavor is a nice sweet and sour cherry, some yeast funk, lacto. Pretty expected for the style but with a bit more sharp tartness to go along that makes it nicely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and a bit more body than other sours, and with carbonation on the lower side--just a little prickle. Overall this was enjoyable."

"In the vein of Supplication, but quite far from that level. I like Rainier cherries, but they are far from the most flavorful and seem like a poor choice to incorporate in a beer - so its no surprise that the cherry billing was a bit of a letdown. Moderate tartness - lots of vinous notes, wood, sugars. Good, but not great and not on the same level as the other wild ales I've had from Almanac"

"O - Nice but not great. Somewhat disappointing. If it was any other brewery I wouldn't be, but as one of my favorite breweries I hold Almanac to a higher standard."

"Overall: After having 3 different Almanac sours, it seems like Almanac's calling card in sour beers is a subtle wine barrel notes with fantastic balance of the fruits used in the sour. It has been unmistakable in all three of the Almanac sours that I have sampled thus far. I enjoy the uniqueness of the Almanac brand sour beers. They may not be as high end as Cantillion or Drie Fontenien, but they are biting at the heels of these breweries."
""
""
""
"Overall, really nice; the individual elements don't stick out so much as combine to something well constructed. It's an enjoyable beer in a less common style, that's very drinkable and doesn't go over the top."

"O - A really good sour. Easy to drink. Not sure if I would want to pay $11 for a 12oz bottle again, when I can buy a fantastic 22oz stout or IPA at $7-$9, but if I can find it under $10, I will definitely pick up more. Highly recommend you give it a try."
""
""
""
"The beer appears orange and hazy with a quarter inch or so of off-white head. My wife's is significantly redder and darker. The aroma brings wine barrels, oak, cherries, yeast, farmhouse funk. Lovely flavor with wine character leading the way. Prominent cherries with cherry juice and oak. Light to medium in body with a mild puckering finish. Terrific. I would really like to have this again."
""
""
"O: I am quite impressed. This is a lot like a slightly muted Supplication to me; I'd be interested to have the two side-by-side."

"0- Outstanding beer. Would have no problem drinking this regularly if it was available in my neck of the woods."
""
""
""

""
""
"0- Outstanding beer. In the world of sours there's so much to explore that I would imagine trying others before diving back into this one, but a great beer I would buy again and enjoy."
"Pretty much all one wants to ask for in a sour. Spunky like Buffy the vampire slayer, yet subtle like Grace Kelly during her princess days. Raul likes it, Raul likes it a lot...but it is also so amazingly average at the same time (if that makes sense) that Raul wouldn't mind trying something else if he had other options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the only thing that you can knock this beer is the clarity, both in bottles and on tap it was very hazy. Otherwise it was my favorite sour by them besides farmers reserve number two. It had a nice lacto sourness accentuated by the cherries and then balanced out with oak. Almanac is doing things right for sure."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with grain, red wine, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy sour cherry and grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a better sour fruit smell in the aroma in my opinion."

"O: One of the better sours I have tried. Not a mouth-puckerer but has a nice tart hit for sure. Well balanced flavors and surprisingly easy drinking for a sour."
""
"I will continue to keep my eye out for these sour releases from Almanac. These have the potential to get better and better, and these recent wild ales from them that I've had have been really delightful. Even though there's less cherries than desired, the sour flavors of this beer are good enough to merit a visit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light brown color with golden edges with an off white head. Smell is sour, tart wheat (sourdough?), a touch of cherry. Taste is more of the same but it seems a bit muted. Some caramel sweetness. The finish is short-lived. Not much complexity to keep me interested. The more I drink the less I think of this beer. This is a good beer but really falls short of my expectations. Tried this along with Red Poppy and Supplication. The Dogpatch Sour was the unanimous loser in the tasting. Again...its a good beer but there are many better options out there."

"Bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Pours a murky orange-brown with tan head. Aroma is part tart and part sweet -- lactic acid, underripe cherries and slight vinegar for the tartness, and butter, honey and melon for the sweetness. Flavor has a unique but slightly understated Rainier cherry character, sweet and fleshy but very obviously not black or maraschino cherry like many other Flemish-style sours have. There’s a significant oaky buttery note throughout, but it isn’t really off-putting. It lends a honeycomb aftertaste that competes with cherry pits and fermented strawberries in the finish. I’m also getting a sort of milky lactose mouthfeel with a drying sensation, like if you’ve ever added honey and milk to a cup of tea. I like this beer more and more as I go along. Overall a unique mix of lactic acid and lactose notes with a moderate amount of fruitiness."
"jd"
"O - the comparisons to supplication are inevitable. Unfortunately, this beer isn't in the same league. That being said, this is a delicious sour and really refreshing. For me, not as impressive as #3 or #4."
"Another really fantastic sour from Almanac. Though not particularly attractive, the aroma and flavor make up for it in spades. Huge notes of cherry Fruit Roll Up, wine notes, oak, and a bit of sourdough yeast character come through nicely. The wine character is quite pronounced in the flavor, especially as the beer warms. I've been wildly impressed with most everything I've had from Almanac's sour lineup, and this one is fantastic as well."
""
""
"Light body with some decent carbonation tickling the tongue. A decent beer, but the flavor on the tongue was a bit lighter than I expected."
""
""
"A tulip is ideal."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Potential for cellaring is good to see how the funk might evolve. Cherry flavor component is already fairly light, so additional aging may not have much impact. Nice fresh. Solid, but I feel Reserve #3 and #4 are superior."
""
""
""
"O-Visible yeast in bottom of bottle makes me believe this will develop more complexity and funk in the next few years. Definitely worth picking up for now and aging. Delicious. Tied w/ #4 for personal favorite almanac. I know many prefer #3 though. Not sure which wine barrel this was aged in. I want to say white. One friend said it had an aroma similar to supplication which I caught a whiff of, but I got the sense instead of pinot noir barrels like supp, it was aged in a white varietal. I could be wrong though."
