"Hazy, straw yellow body with some yeast evident. Small, broken head. Lovely aroma of lactic funk and citrus. Orange, apricot, melon, assorted stone fruit with tropical notes as well. Juicy and delicious. Gently tart balanced my a natural fruity sweetness. Notes of pineapple, guava. Light in body and dangerously drinkable. Fabulous."
""
"Overall a really balanced and mellow fruited sour that demonstrates that a clean flavor profile complemented by superior drinkability can really go a long way. Definitely worth trying."

"One of the more overrated beers out there. Apricot pit and mild sourness. Get a de garde imperial apricot bu and thank me later."

"Batch 7. So happy to have tried this one. I swear this beer morphed into something different in my glass several times while drinking it. A beautiful beer that is both delicious and fun to drink."

"During SF Beer Week 2015, Trappist Provisions in Oakland had a Sante Adairius event, including a keg of West Ashley. Delicious, balanced, subdued apricot sour."

"and excellent example of brewing with fruit. fully attenuated, not juicy. funk and fruit as well as anyone."

"Like other fruited SARA Saisons this is not dominant on the fruit but just a very integrated and pretty complex farmhouse ale. As it warms the apricot comes out more on the nose and the taste gets more complex. Fantastic wild ale, love them apricots."

"Bottle: Poured a straw color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention.  Aroma of sour and tart notes with some light funky yeast notes is quite nice. Taste is a great mix between some sour and tart notes with some funky yeast. Apricot notes a very subtle and kind of hard to distinguish. Pinot noir barrel lend a light vinous feel to the beer. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Enjoyable sour but I would have preferred more apricot notes to be upfront."

"Pours a golden straw color with a short-lived head leaving no lacing. Beautiful nose, tart fruit (peaches?), nice Brett profile, acidc, yeast.  On the palate, this beer is dry/tart, sours fruit, tight on the back of the tongue.  Really nice!!!"
""
""
""
"Pour is a lightly hazed golden amber with a white head. Nose is lambic esq. Has some  dusty cellar brett, and nice notes of nectarine and peach. Taste is less lambic and more fruity. Not sour. Moderate carbonation and a creamy body. Bright peach, nectarine and some grapefruit. There is some dusty brett, gentle acidity, a bit sweet in the flavor."

"O- This is an excellent beer, without question. The aroma is splendid, and the flavors are superb. A firmer body would tie it all together in near perfection. Glad to have had the chance to drink this one, and now know that SARA deserves the hype."

"Verdict: The fruit comes across superbly well, but the base beer is certainly not forgotten, complex, balanced and quite refreshing. Very reminiscent of Peche n Brett, in that the saison qualities are not lost. I really enjoyed this one and can't wait to have it again in the future."

"Really well balanced saison with just a hint of apricot skin on the finish.  The base beer is so well made in terms of carb as well as balance in the funk and tartness.  It's a quenching tartness that highlights the beer."

"my first beer from these folks thats not a collaboration, and its a pretty good one, albeit a little short of where the hype would have it. the apricots didnt seem that prominent to me, but the sour saison base was awesome, and the barrel aspect fantastic. hazy orange tinted blonde color, short but lasting white inch on top. the nose here is more saison yeast than brett, but there is some funk intermixed with the moderate acid tartness. the apricots arent invisible on the nose, but their presence is light, more of an orchard fruit sweetness than apricots specifically, but i get it. the flavor is light on the apricot too, which is fine for me, i dont reckon it needs much. the blonde sour saison beer is just great, with a lot of yeast character in addition to the mouthfeel, its got a little spice, and the wheat malt base has some serious body to it. the carbonation is pronounced, and the finish is dry. as an apricot wild ale, its not my favorite, its not fruit forward enough for that, but as a wild ale in general, its exquisite. the oak on this adds a nice layer that jives famously with the yeast. i would buy this if it were available here for sure."

"A bit too sour for my (virgin) sour tastes, but this still had a lot of great flavors that I could enjoy."

"Overall- One of the best American fruit sours/saisons I've had thus far. Jeez! So much more delicate yet flavourful than the likes of Chez Monus and Atrial Rubicite. It's up there with New Glarus' Very Sour Blackberry in terms of the drinking experience. Sante Adairius is for real!"

"This pours a bright yellow with clear white foam. There’s a crisp, lemony, floral tartness to it that just absolutely snaps. The beer tastes amazing with notes of lemon and jasmine on the back end. It is incredibly delicate—dare I say sublime—with a long tart finish."
"The beer pours a light yellow orange with a thin, white, tightly knit head that fades rapidly. The nose is a distinct shotgun of apricot to the face, some funk and and sour, little malt, no bitterness, touch of red wine and acetone. The taste is also distinctly apricot that is tart with just enough sweetness and has a lingering dried apricot finish. The beer's light bodied, true to fruit with layered barrel complexities, light-medium carbonation, and a mouthwateringly dry finish. This beer is quite fantastic, really nails the apricot sour profile."

"Poured into a tulip glass. Bright yellow/orange, small white head. Bubbly ring around the glass. Smells tart, with oranges, peaches. It's so fruity. The taste is tart upfront and all peach and apricot on the back end. Sticks around in the mouth for a while after you swallow. Medium mouthfeel, almost no carbonation. Feels a bit heavy on the tongue, in a good way. I would like a little more carbonation, but my bottle may have been compromised in the mail. All the other flavors are there, though. Nice level of tartness here, very refreshing and meshes well with the fruit flavors."

"Great stuff. Fairly simple concept but phat and delicious."
""

"Overall: West Ashley is a fantastic American Wild Ale and was the perfect beer on a hot summers day. I think a little tweaking of the funk profile (to limit the dirty character) will put this beer on the map as one of the best American sours."

"Need another bottle - outstanding and likely best in the wine barel saison category. Perfect golden pour big white head and amazing spotty leg/lines. Smell nice wine barrel, slight champagne, apricot tartness. Taste and feel incredibly smooth"
""
"T: Opens with a fantastic pull of tartness, full of underripe apricot, meyer lemon flesh and lemon seed. Bright apricot notes galore in here, full of apricot skin, dried apricot and underripe white peach. Finish shows a touch of apricot pit, light oak and a nice dryness. Mouthfeel is impeccable, bright and light in body without being overly carbonated. This is an amazing beer. One of the best sours I have ever had. Maybe even the best."

"Yes, I gave this beer the elusive 5 because I thought that for what it is (a soured, fruited, wine barrel-aged Saison) it did what it was supposed to flawlessly. It skyrocketed immediately to my top 10 favorite beers of all time and is worthy of the hype and what I traded for it. A truly memorable experience."

"A very good beer with a bit too much sulfur in the nose. Hopefully they get that figured out (it's been present in some of their others beers) as it is detracting. Who needs spontaneous fermentation when you can inoculate with a house strain of this quality?"

"I'm heavily biased, as this beer opened up an entirely new dimension for me. Call it the gateway drug to sour beer. Tart without being over-puckering. Intense but not overpowering. Complex but not complicated. Bright, fruity, spicy, and playful. Remarkably easy to drink."
"D - This was quite enjoyable, and perfect for a hot 4th of July. My first Sante Adairius experience that bodes well for future offerings. I'd love to have this again and see if the wild yeast develops over time."
""
""
""
""

"O - Loved this one. We drank a bunch of other Peach and Stone Fruit sours the night before and I would say this was my favorite of the bunch. I would love to get my hands on a couple bottles of this one."

"O-Ohhh the funk. A very tasty beer."
"Overall - Really nice. Not earth-shattering, but greater than the sum of its parts."
"O - Light saison with a nice apricot and a nice hit of tartness. A true gem here."
""
""
""
""
"Good, but not sure if I'd get it again."
"Batch 3: From bottle at Jupiter Sour Sunday. The aroma has taken a leap forward, just tons of dried apricots. Clearly more fruit in this batch, in a good way. Flavor is tart and tannic, apricot skin galore."
