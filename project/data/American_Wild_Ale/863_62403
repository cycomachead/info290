Taste is also dominated by tart fresh raspberry notes with light acidic notes noticeable and light oak notes also perceptible. Body is about average with good carbonation. Great trade-off between sour notes and fresh fruit notes with good overall drinkability.","Phyl21ca","Jan 24, 2015"

4.43,-0.2,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Framboise for a Cure (2014) - Russian River Brewing Company - Santa Rosa, California - American Wild Ale - 6.70% ABV - This delicious wild ale poured a ruby red color, with a small pink head that dissipates immediately. The nose featured aromas of tart raspberries and white wine up front, followed by undertones of oak, apricots, and peach. The mouth was very tart, with flavors of juicy raspberries, Chardonnay, oak, and peach that blend together nicely. The mouthfeel was light bodied, with an enamel ripping finish that was quite refreshing. This was a solid offering from Russian River, but I prefer Supplication (I'm just a sucker for that beer) and Beatification over this one. 98/100","thebeerfrontier","Jan 22, 2015"

This beer is very, very razzy. Plenty of raspberry notes, some dry tartness, lacto tartness, some gain and peppery sharp notes. It’s tart, but has a hollow middle for me.

There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Not quite as sour as some of their others but it made it so drinkable that it was addictive. Definitely a strong dose of raspberries. They put 100 pounds of raspberries in per barrel. It had a sweet aroma with a touch of bread. The mouthfeel was incredible. I could've chugged beer after beer if I wanted to. Moderate sour and sweet crisp finish. I wasn't able to get any bottles but I definitely drank my fill on draft. Excellent beer highly recommend of you're in the area during the month long release","ThaddeusGhostal","Oct 03, 2013"

Smells of raspberries, lemon, lactic, grass and some more raspberries and their pithy, vegetal character. This beer is very, very razzy. Plenty of raspberry notes, some dry tartness, lacto tartness, some gain and peppery sharp notes. It's tart, but has a hollow middle for me. Medium on thin bodied with moderate on hi carb and a semi dry finish. This one is good, clean and approachable.","harrymel","Oct 11, 2012"
3.75,-15.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is similar, mostly dry raspberry with faint sweetness, lightly sour and tart and acidic, a light but firm rustic yeastiness underneath and light yeasty bread in the aftertaste. It has some noticeable rustic/funky yeasty and sour-ale character but it certainly could use more to make a really complex fruit wild ale. However, it is very good, crisp, bright, quenching, and has a little complexity but not nearly enough to be a truly exceptional example. I like beers of this sort to have a lot of flavour, not be really lean and dry like dry champagne, which this tends towards. I also like my fruit wild ales or lambics to have plenty of very evident funky/yeasty character in addition to the fruit. The feel is pretty good, but a bit thin and not lively or engaging.","Offa","Oct 10, 2012"

The nose is full of tart raspberries and a mild sugary sweetness. Some musty hay and acidic cider vinegar. On the palate, the raspberries are front and center. Big, bold tart raspberries rush the palate with a mild sugary sweetness in tow. Some hay and light manure-like funk come through in the middle before tart raspberries pop back up in the finish. The finish is sharp, dry, and tart. Light body with high carbonation. The raspberry flavor really lingers; your mouth is coated with fresh raspberries. A really delicious beer with loads of fresh fruit. Extremely drinkable.","ColForbinBC","Oct 08, 2012"

Puckeringly tart on the tongue, fresh raspberries dominate, citric, lactic, acetic (just a bit), mild grassy funk, and a touch of woodiness. Tasty!

The hint of the lambic, or "Sonambic" as Russian River calls Beatification, really adds a layer of nuanced funkiness that really sets it apart from the previous two vintages which utilized purely their blonde sour, Temptation as the base beer.

However, in a showdown with the better ones, this Framboise for a Cure is downgraded to the fish-stick- and Wageningen Ice Tiger level .The Hommage simply did to this beer what the atomic bomb did to Nagasaki, it completely wiped it off the (beer)map.

About a finger of rose tinted foam briefly graces the top of the glass, before quickly fading away. The nose is nearly flawless. Raspberry is the first thing to jump out, and is the dominant aroma present. Earthy brett funk is right behind, playing a strong second. An acetic sour twang is also there, but very much in the background compared to the other two. My only minor quibble is that the whole thing could stand to be a bit more powerful. The first thing that stands out about the flavor is that it's much more tart than the nose would have suggested. A close second is that the raspberries have fallen way off from what I expected. If the aroma profile was 50/40/10 in terms of raspberry/funk/sour, I'd say the taste is at 20/30/50, with the berry flavor only creeping in on the back end. The body is fairly dry, and works nicely with the expansive, champagne-like carbonation. Framboise for a Cure is another world class wild brew from Russian River, though I'm surprised both at how just how wild it is and how muted the fruit is for a relatively young beer.","axeman9182","Dec 09, 2011"

Glad it became more available this year so more people can taste it, even if the base beer isn't the same (last year Beatification, this year it's Temptation). Trade for this if you can, it will not disappoint.","auroracrisis","0"

4.2,-5.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a prickly and lively level of carbonation in the mouth but visually it looks to be a bit lacking. Even though this is my first time having this brew, it carries with it some very familiar aspects to it. It was quite enjoyable and the alcohol level is well integrated throughout. An interesting brew that is worth the try if you ever get a chance. Not fully worth the price tag of admission but for the cause it is well worth it and something I would see out again just because.","stakem","Oct 22, 2011"
4.15,-6.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, another impressive Russian River sour. However, I'm left feeling a bit dissapointed. I'm not sure this is any better than temptation, which is a shame given the rarity and increased price.","readbaron","Oct 17, 2011"

4.36,-1.8,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"2011 vintage. Thanks Mario! Pours a beautiful bright red with a nice, small baby pink head. Scent is RASPBERRY CITY! Nice tart funkiness and acidic aroma. Taste is more sour than aroma portrays, which is never a bad thing. Delicious sour raspberries with yummy wild yeast flavors that RR specializes in. Finishes with sweet raspberries and a tart bite. Mouthfeel is light and puckering. Drinkability is very high...if you can afford it. Thank God it's goin to boobies. Overall, this beer was like The Bruery's BeRazzled on steroids...a better version of it. One of the best Framboise style beers I've ever had.","DovaliHops","Oct 12, 2011"

While this was very good, I don't think it quite compared to the Cantillon. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this stuff brewed in the future and potentially making its way up here for sale at the bottle shops in Portland. I would definitely buy up some of those bottles.","hopsbreath","Jan 10, 2011"

4.3,-3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Quite a bit different from batch one, with far more fruit and less 'wild' character. I think I liked Batch 1 a tiny bit more, but still a quality brew.","MasterSki","Dec 05, 2010"

3.95,-11,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a glowing pink/salmon with a bright white head. Some little floating chunks here though the bottled was calm and upright for 2-3 months. Nose is vibrant, funky, and bright. Some light manure and citrus fruits, light raspberry. Very nice, fresh, bright on the nose. Mouth is at first very sour. It's all about the base beer here (Beatification?) and not much about the berries. In fact the berries act mostly to muddle and confuse the Beatification. A fair amount of lemon in the mouth, some salt edges in. The fruit just struggles with the sharp sourness of the base beer, which lends to a lack of balance in the flavor profile. Awesome nose, awesome base beer, but this was a bit of a disappointment. Looking forward to future batches as I think Vinnie will hone it in.","JAXSON","Nov 26, 2010"
4.36,-1.8,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this was a great sour from RR. The raspberries used very excellent and it was very drinkable. It was definitely a treat to have. Sour, tart, and fruity. Awesome stuff. Thanks Kevin for sharing this one.","mothman","Nov 20, 2010"

Poured into a tulip glass a very bright, vibrant reddish grapefruit color with a with fluffy head. Some yeast sediment floating around. Did someone say raspberries were in this?! The aroma is strong tart raspberry with some underlying brett like florals. Light mouthfeel. Holy tartness batman! The raspberry tartness takes center stage on this with some additional notes of barrel and floral. Highly carbonated but surprisingly it doesn't take away from the flavor of the beer. This is such a nice drinking beer, clean and crisp with strong fruit and sour qualities. An excellent beer!","kbutler1","Nov 20, 2010"
