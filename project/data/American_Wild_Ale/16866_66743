Didnâ€™t hurt that I bought a couple of bottles, too. Appearance is pink-orange with a white collar. Aroma is funky, lactic, oaky, citrus, grape skin, raspberries. Taste is tart berries, acidic, and funky to open. Light fruit sweetness and oak bitterness supply some balance. Medium bodied, thin crisp texture, lively carbonation, dry abrupt finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

Wheat character is present but restrained, yeasty esters are on the mild side, but that's pleasant for a beer this big and fruity.

The sourness is just one component of a beer with a lot of depth and interest to offer. I love how the use of fruit and lacto take the subtle bit of tartness that you often find in classic witbiers and turn it slightly on its head, amping up the sourness, but not at the expense of the overall beer. I'd love to get my hands on some more bottles of this.","LambicPentameter","Jul 23, 2014"

Taste is of tart raspberry, oak, sour lemon and mild citrus fruit, barnyardy brett, funky all the way through, drying finish with lingering fruit and oak. Spritzy high carbonation, dry medium body.

The alcohol is just high enough, and it displays only the best aspects this brewery is known for - excellent oak blending; sour, fruit infused notes; sweet, yet not over-the-top maltiness; and, the always caramel forward, thick forward mouth feel their beers are known for. Tasting like this a whole full year after being bottled - why, it's the stuff of wizards. I want a whole case of this. Mind blowing, life changing stuff.

Its fleshy but not super bright, there is a hint of barrel and a touch of leathery bret. Taste is little brighter raspberry with a fair bit of lacto. Finish is highly carbonated and muddles the flavor in back a little with a touch of sulfer. Soft creamy body and actually pretty dry.","cpetrone84","Jan 10, 2014"

I expect some of the berries to drop out, but frankly they weren't predominant fairly fresh so I don't expect the beer's flavor to suffer particularly.","macrosmatic","Jan 03, 2014"

There's a small dose of funk and vague spice, but even without those lesser notes, the base flavor would rock anyway. The carbonation level is light, perhaps from aging, though its mouthfeel is still at an acceptable level. Better late than never, and I'm glad I got to taste this creation.","DoubleJ","Sep 12, 2013"

4.24,-2.1,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"O - Very good raspberry summer refresher. Great, fresh raspberry character in aroma and flavor. Crisp and refreshing tartness and tingly carbonation. Base beer is pretty basic with the fruit and wine barrel yielding most of the character. Alcohol presence isn't noticeable even at 8%. Mild funkiness. Very nice beer - expected a ruby colored beer with an overwhelming abundance of raspberry. Instead, I got a nicer balance. Tart, a little bit of funk, well balanced and garden fresh raspberry addition and subtle wine barrel influence...what I got was better than I expected...and I had high expectations for this ahead of time.","portia99","Sep 01, 2013"

Here they took an Imperial Witbier, dosed it with their Berliner Weisse culture and threw it in red wine barrels with fresh raspberries. Incredibly, they managed to keep in balance the tart Berliner Weisse cultures and naturally tart raspberries with the normally very delicate Belgian Witbier style. Although its not my favorite sour from the Bruery, this is a very high quality beer and definitely worth tracking down.","flayedandskinned","Aug 27, 2013"

The nose starts with some citric funk followed by lemon and wheat. The raspberries work their way through with tart notes and a bit of oak comes through at the end. The taste matches the nose with a light refreshing wheaty tart palate. Reminds me of a beefed up Berliner. I wouldn't call this beer overwhelmingly sour, but it does have a nice dash of tartness. Notes of lemon and raspberry again followed by some hints of wheat at the back. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, the 8% is non existent which works well for this brew.

Everything going on in the flavor here was really nice and when there was one note, another followed close behind that worked in unison to help you get through the sour/tart mashing on your palate.

4.47,3.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This pours a straw-yellow without a hint of raspberry and a whitish head. The nose is raspberry and musty, horse blanket funk. Smells really interesting and good. There is a strong presence of wheat-funk and sour in this beer, with the sourness being sharp like unflavored sour candy that is reminiscent of beatification. Raspberry, lemon and oak round it all out. This really comes together very well. Soured Imperial Wit beer didn't sound good to me, but it really worked well. Good carbonation with a decent body. Overall, I thought this was a really fantastic beer.","seeswo","Oct 30, 2011"

3.97,-8.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Thanks to Dr J for sharing this treat with me. 750ml bomber, poured a fuzzy yellow color with a tannish head and nice lacing. I commented that it smells like something my daughter would like. Aroma was like a mixture between Tang and Squirt. So I am expecting a sour influenced Witbeer. Okay, thatâ€™s new. Starts off with doughy grapefruit and apple skins. You can get the influence of the wine barrels and raspberries right up front. Lighter notes of the brett throughout. Well carbed. Somewhat lactic, with orange rinds and kumquats on the finish. This is different, but a pretty nice brew. Thanks Jason.","Doodler","Aug 10, 2011"
4.5,3.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A surprisingly excellent beer. I expected this to be good, but didn't expect to come away thinking it was so exceptional - nice balance between acidity and tartness; brightly fruit; and refreshing.

4.68,8.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"O: Hands-down one of the best tasting beers I've ever had. If the smell was a little better, this beer would be an all-time great if you ask me.

5,15.5,5,5,5,5,5,"it was really, really, really good. the tartness of the raspberries was the overwhelming note, but there's plenty of belgian yeast and sour goodness that shine through as well. this was acquired due to a friend's overwhelming kindness to share it with the g/f and i, as it's a limited release decently beyond its time, and i'd have near-zero hope of getting it without similarly hyped beers in trade. a high point of my trip to seattle for sure.","Franch","May 31, 2011"

4.38,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy hazed yellow straw color with a nice little white head. Good carbonation. The wheat and straw type notes are eveident right off the bat in the nose but you also get some barnyard funk, raspberry, and lemongrass. I am really hoping the taste is like the nose! The flavors in the taste are nice with notes of lemon, wheat, and raspberry. As it warms a bit the barnyard funk flavor moves in and becomes more apparent. I could drink this one all day! There is little to no real alcohol flavors here.","kbutler1","May 30, 2011"

3.44,-20.6,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"O - This is certainly an unusual brew. I am not terribly fond of the nose, but found the taste much more palatable; I enjoy most of the aspects at least moderately, the major gripe I have is the taste reminds me of the nose (and associated unpleasantries.)","ktrillionaire","May 07, 2011"
3.76,-13.2,4,3,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but also a bit slick and goes down rather smooth. Moderately carbonated, it's a mild sour with a bit of tartness that pokes at the cheek from the sides of the tongue. Finish is a bit dry, but the raspberries continue on the palate. Overrall, it was incredibly drinkable and pretty refreshing (shouldn't be a surprise for a Witbier). Wish I could have picked out more of the spices, but they seemed to be very much in the background. I'd love to try this again in a few years and see how acidic the raspberries make it.","sarro","Apr 22, 2011"

4.3,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The body is great - it's a bit denser than expected from a ""witbier", but it works. The carbonation is on the high/sparkling end of things, but that's OK. Overall, this beer lived up to the hype. If you're sensitive to sulfur or dirty sour smells, you may not be able to get past that, but bear with it, trust me, it's worth it!","jampics2","Apr 13, 2011"
4.75,9.7,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Thanks to Adam and Gregg for supplying me with these to share. Bottle poured into Lost Abbey tumbler. Color is a hazy pinkish orange, very reminiscent of grapefruit juice. Small off white pinkish head fades to a collar. Smell is very yeasty, lots of sour lemon lactic acid. Some raspberry, oak, and wheat as well, but very heavy on the berliner weiss yeast. Taste is sour but balanced, kind of like an imperial berliner weiss more then a wit. Sour raspberries and lemon acidity, yeast, wheat, some oak and a tart finish. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation, finishes dry. Incredibly refreshing with some very well hidden alcohol. This is a huge success for bottleworks, one of my favorite anniversary beers for them so far. Very unique, try this one out if you get a chance.","nkersten","Apr 10, 2011"
4.44,2.5,5,3.5,5,4,4.5,"O: Delicious, crisp and refreshing sour. Highly drinkable, great combination of sourness and tart raspberries. This would be perfect to crack open outside on a hot summer day.

4.12,-4.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer appears hazy and light orange in color. The beer has a thick white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite pleasant, with scents of funk, raspberries, and coriander. I did not enjoy the flavor as much as the aroma, but found the beer favorable nonetheless. Plenty of tartness to be found here, with a healthy dose of raspberries. The body is moderately thin, with a solid carbonation level. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good beer and I would definitely like to have it again sometime.","Huhzubendah","Mar 28, 2011"
4.4,1.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"D - The 8% is a shocker, as this could be mistook for a ""heavy"" US Berliner Weiss in the 4-5% range.

In some ways it's a shame this is a Bottleworks Anniversary beer, as it deserves to be a summer seasonal.","MasterSki","Mar 24, 2011"
4.08,-5.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinking a bottle of the new batch, thanks to Abraham. The nose is beautiful, bright and fragrant with a wonderful, clean raspberry aroma along with a moderate blend of wheat, lactic sourness, citrus, funk( earth, dust, must) coriander. More coriander and orange peel than I remember the original batch having. The palate has a bright raspberry fruitiness, tart, bright and super clean - no seed character whatsoever.  Pairing really well with the wit beer base and the moderate yogurty lactic sourness, this beer is medium light in body and finishes dry, carbonic and spicy with a touch of funk. A little citrus sourness is present too. Really good. 4.25/4.25/4.25","DefenCorps","Mar 21, 2011"

4.61,6.5,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Taste, simply put, every sip was better and more sour than the last. A medley of fruit tastes came about from this one. Maybe peach, strawberry, something to give it the pinkish appearance. Puckering. Probably my favorite soured beer, definitely favorite witbier (although the taste is anything but witbierish).","Beerandraiderfan","Mar 21, 2011"
4.15,-4.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I enjoyed it, it was like a really heavy berleiner with syrup in it in the end. I don't know why it had to be so high in ABV and there seemed to be a connectivity issue with the flavors on the palate. Still enjoyable but I like my sours to be lighter and more effervescent. I think the lactic character of this beer could have bee complemented with some carbonic acid and a thinner body.","drabmuh","Mar 20, 2011"
4.25,-1.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"d - Overall this was an interesting beer that I liked. I think some people were mixed on this and got more of the witbier characteristics, but I got a lot of funk in the nose, and a lot of tart fruit in the taste. Would like to try again sometime.","mdfb79","Mar 20, 2011"
4.57,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is, for lack of a better term, a very fun beer. The pink and cloudy color, explosive texture, and huge tingly sweet and acidic fruit character make for an engaging and pleasing drinking experience.","MrFootstones","Mar 20, 2011"
4.64,7.2,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a bit lighter than the color of pink grapefruit juice. The nose is really enticing with a mild lactic character along with a great raspberry presence. Really nice fruit all around. Damn good. A bit of mild coriander in there as well; if not that, then some other spice. The flavor is sublimely fruity with a beautiful sourness hitting in the midpalate and carrying through to the finish. A bit of light spicing is there in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel was splendid and did a fantastic job blending the fruit and sourness, and had a really fantastic level of carbonation as well.
