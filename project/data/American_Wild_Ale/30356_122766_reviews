"On tap at Mongoose Vs. Cobra, served in a tulip. Nearly clear, yellow gold, with a modest fringe of white foam and lasting skim. Aroma is full and fruity, plenty of citrus, some tropical fruit, spice and funk. Tastes of juicy grapefruit and tropical fruit, nice tartness, dank notes, a crisp and bitter, dry finish. Wild sourness nicely highlights fruity aspects of the Mosaic hops."

"O - My first dry hopped AWA and it was quite good."
""

"Overall:  A very easy to drink ale that goes down too easy.  Where it’s at now, it doesn’t have a full out sourness as much as a lemony tartness.  Nice brett forward nose not unlike Orval with a wine like twang.  Overall a nice funky and tart ale, hits the spot if you’re looking to get your brett fix without going full out lambic."

"16.9 ounce bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with a couple inch white head that stayed around a long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  I like the aroma, the brew smells like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, lemon peel), funk, and some grainy malt.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some grassiness, lime and green grapes/grape skins noticeable.  The tartness isn't very strong at all, but with that being said it still tastes good.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated.  Overall I liked this brew, and it was one that I liked more and more the longer I drank it.  Definitely worth trying!"

"t/m/o - the feel jumps out at the first sip as this one is alive with big fizz.  Prickly carbonation.  Taste is uber funky.  Really eggy with a plastic edge.  Finishes dry and musty.  Gold ale beneath with soft tangerine hop somewhere in the middle.  The finish is a bit odd and dry and musty. Not bad, but probably won't be more than a one time affair for me."

"Overall this is a fine beer. Wish I had it fresh to see if the dry hopping was more prevalent. Not worth the $12 bottle though."

"Wow, this is a near-perfect beer. I agree it's more Berliner than sour. Eminently drinkable. Perfect hop balance that shows itself then quickly leaves to present the other flavors. This is my idea of a summer beer."
""

"Overall:  this beer appeals to me in a way that's hard to articulate.  I think I like it because it is simply weird, like They Might Be Giants or something.  Anyway, I am very sad I can't get it here in Seattle without trading."

"Tart aromas of peach, lemon, and chardonnay are accompanied by must and grass, along with lightly phenolic pepper. Flavor is exceedingly lactic, tart, with lemon at the forefront and peach skin adding complexity. The aftertaste is slightly musty, vinous, then lightly bready. Very complex, easy drinking beer, if you're into sours."

"Overall (4.25), this is a stellar beer that i would gladly drink again and again. I can't say it's my absolute favorite dry-hopped sour, but that is only because that spot is occupied by one of my favorite sour beers, period. This one, however, is one that I hope Prairie decides to produce again and again."
""
"O - Nice mix of hoppy/funky/tart flavors with decent complexity, though doesn't seem quite put-together. Almost too dirty-feeling in a way, kinda would've liked to see a base beer of sorts as well. But it's good enough to kinda forgive those factors."
""
"This is a solid beer.  Pours and bubbles almost like Champagne with tons of bubbles an an inch of head that retains for a while.  It smells of funk and lemon.  The first sips while still fridge cold are nice and light.  Theres almost no detection of alcohol and it drinks like afruity saison.  As it warms midway through it turns more towards the sour feel with a tart taste and a dry finish.  Almost reminds me of a carbed pinot grigio.  I really enjoyed this one and I'm glad I traded for 2!"
""

"Pours an opaque but bright gold, with small fizzy white head. Smell: soft grain, dough, white grapes, lemon rind, unripe peach. Taste: lemon upfront followed by very dillute tropical fruit juice...passion fruit may be the closest, then as the carbonation builds it moves to lactic doused canned pear, and as it dries out this all fades into grain twang and brett-land with acetic and white wine notes and finishing with unripe peach and lemon peel. Very tasty with quite a bit going once it's warmed up."
""
""
"O: Lovely beer. I don't get enough chances to get the wild ales as much as I'd like to."
"Grapefruit,  passion fruit and sour citrus explosion. Not sour but quite tart which suits the fruit flavors presented. Bitter citrus zest seems to linger with tarts forever."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I heard good things about this beer and it lived up to its name, a very solid sour, not a world beater by any means but a good beer. I like the way hops are played in the beer, gives real character."
""
"Overall pretty nice, grassy mosaic but it overpowers the nice light sour funk and little fruit notes.4"

"A fun refreshing tropical hopped saison."

"O – The mosaic hops definitely add a bit of a tropical feel here. I like the balance on this, and the lactobacillus is very much present but not overwhelming.  While not the best example of its use, I think this is a beer worth drinking."

"Pours hazy golden in color with a fluffy one and a half finger white head that has great retention. Smell has some incredibly fresh juicy stone fruit aroma, primarily peach. There are also some slightly herbal, mango and pineapple hop aromas. Taste follows nose with bright juicy tart flavors of peach, crisp tropical hops, semi sweet light grainy sweetness to balance. Awesome sour"

"O: As of writing this review, I've had a couple goses, lambics, and slightly sour fruit beers but this is my first AWA. Not sure where this falls on the sourness scale, but I can definitely see myself drinking a lot more AWAs. I like it a lot."

"Pours a hazy white and light yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma if funky with the traditional barnyard aroma, pineapple, grape, mango and melon on the fruit end and just a touch of some grassiness. Flavor follows suit and is slightly tart. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, decent beer but not my favorite from Prairie."
""
""
"The name definitely fits the beer. It's darn solid. Approved!"

"O - Luscious  tropical fruit nose, lemon tart acidity white wine taste and a dry body. It's a legit summer beer that definitely quenches your thirst."

"Sour and full of passionfruit, juicy and tangy. Dry Brett aftertaste. Effervescent and spritzy. Light to medium bodied, very easy drinking, wish I had a few bottles of this."
"O-This is a nice summertime beer with delicious fruity aromas. This style can be one of my favorites (I love Le Terroir and Red Swingline, for example), and I have enjoyed most Prairie offerings, so it is no surprise that I enjoyed this beer. A little more depth in flavor might help, but as is, I would easily drink more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly briney and earthy with straw and hay, the beer's IPA tendencies show with bold citrusy bitterness and candied pine needles. With its fledgling sweet balance wisping away, the finish it a tandem of hop bitterness and barrel sourness to strip the palate of all thirst and to keep the complexities coming, even deep into aftertaste."

"8 oz. pour at Jester King Brewery on 8/8/2014. Floral and catty aroma, you expect a West Coast IPA, but get a mild sour with strong hop characteristics. Tons of off white head. You might expect medium to heavy body with a fair amount of residual sugar, but what you get is dry, light bodied, and low carbonation. A near perfect amalgam of IPA and farmhouse sour. Very clean finish. One of the more interesting beers of the year for me."
""
""
""
"O: Oh - this is nice. Well balanced. Lightly sour, funk and hops."
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. Love everything I've tried from Prairie and this is no exception. Hops and certain strains of Brett play well with one another, and this beer is a very balanced example of that. Very glad I picked this one up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The sourness comes out on the flavor, but more in line with a good berliner than a full on sour beer. The hop flavors are well integrated and fade quick before any bitterness is perceived. The grain is light and the yeast has a nice rustic thing going on, quite tasty. This has certainly got some wheat in it, a crisp snappiness does it impart. Another fine ale from Chase and Co. Glad I picked up 2 of them, despite the steep price tag."

"Shared by burg at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. Pours gold--imagine that--with a fluffy white head. Aroma of grassy hops, lemon peel, lightly sour lacto notes, and some honey sweetness. Flavor follows the smell just like that, with some additional sour, tropical hop notes, vetegal fresh hops up front, sweet and tart lemons, and some straw. Pretty light bodied and easy drinking. This was very nice, and prairie continues to make great stuff."
""

""
""
""
""

"Through the roof drinkability, not terribly sour, but I could drink this in warm weather all day long; if the price was kinder. This has a Champagne feel/vibe to it... Prairie, you have hit another home run!"
""
""
""
""
"O- My first sour beer. Upon the first smell, I was a little worried, but to me this beer just reminds me of a lemony beer. It almost seems as if the sour notes are derived from lemon, so it in my opinion was a good sour to be my first. Not to funky, just enough."

"O: Farmhouse-styled ales are usually not my thing, but Prairie had never disappointed before, so I wanted to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. This is a fun and creative spin on a style that needs some invigoration."
""
"Pour is hazed pale yellow with lots of tight white head. Nose is faintly dusty, leathery brett, a good bit of orange citrus and lots of pineapple and tropical fruits. Taste is a bit more musky, leathery brett, still tons of pineapple and citrus. Medium body, assertive carbonation, and lightly dry finish."

"Overall, an enjoyable wild ale. Very easy to drink and I could have a fair amount of this. I'd prefer a little more tart and a little less funk, but other than that it's solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer but lacks complexity, body, and pizzaz. Not nearly sour enough and not nearly enough hop character to make up for the week base. I found the original beer to be better than this. I've also been a bit more disappointed with Prairie overall lately. Maybe their sudden gain of popularity affected their egos and they presumably think everything they make will be great. Sorry to say, not the case."

"Highly-refreshing and slightly interesting, but somewhat lacking in flavor."

"On tap at Hops and Pie. Yellow, hazy, it has a decent little white head. Aroma was this weird funky lemon type aroma, really different and must be the mosaic hops. Flavor was nice, mildly sour with a strong citrus lemon flavor. Unique beer and one I'd live to grab a bottle of."

"Pours out a slightly hazed gold with a thin head. Smell is gorgeous. Fresh bread maltiness and some light wild house yeast funk. The majority of the funk in the nose comes from some raunchy mosaic hops: mango, peach, guava, guanabana, and BO. Flavor is big on crackery malts and acid. Hops aren't as much in the forefront, as it's the dry hopping adding those massive aromas. Pleasant and VERY light and refreshing bitterness in the finish. Yeast offers up some fruitiness. Refreshing and palate cleansing. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and effervescent. Acid strips the tongue. It's a shame that I'm not having this beer with food. This screams for a runny, washed rind cheese or fried seafood. Excellent."

"this beer is outstanding, such a wonderful mosaic hop aromatic. its an increasingly popular variety, but examples of it being used this well are still few and far between. delicate blonde sour beer here, accentuated by generous mosaic dry hopping. its like pineapple juice in color, and the aroma follows suit. not overly sour, but unique to prairie, the way elizabeth was. where that one let me down though, this one takes off. juicy wet hops through the whole beer, but instead of a bitter finish, the bacterial funk kicks up and closes it out quickly with a tart dry and very bubbly finish. i love the yeast complexion in this, its dynamic and different, and makes this what it is. the hops though are the real genius. its tough to have both i have learned, hops and funk, they can really cancel each other out sometimes, or worse, produce unpleasant synergies. this one puts all that behind it though, and offers both a highly hopped and quite wild ale. very impressive stuff from prairie, its beers like this that keep them as one of the premiere operations in the country. best use of mosaic ive seen since odells woodcut number 6."

"O: Not as outstanding as I'd hoped, but still interesting and worthwhile. I wish there were more Mosaic and less lemon/funky strange juice. Still. I'd have another, if someone else were buying."

"O- one of my favorite offerings from Prairie. Beautiful beer on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"Overall it's an amazing sour beer. I give it high marks all around as it's a very well balanced beer. I want more of it."
""
""
""
"Extremely hazy to the point of being mostly impenetrable to light despite the light golden color. There's a half inch of eggshell white tightly knit head. Strong aroma of floral mosaic hops and some horse blanket funk which was a very well matched blending. The flavor is more sour initially and turns to floral to slightly citrus hops at the back of the palate. The mouth is quite smooth and delicate. This is a great beer for the hot summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dull, pale honey/apple cider vinegar yellow without sediment and is topped by a loose white head that fades quickly without lacing. The nose has pronounced pineapple/citrus in the forefront followed by some funk and grain sweetness (especially when warming) - it's juicy and aromatic. The taste has similar resemblance to pineapple and oranges which quickly transitions into a slightly chewy, yeasty middle and finishes with hoppy, tropical fruitiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good funk and bitterness, potent citrus, adequate carbonation (that comes off a bit creamy), masked booze, and a semi-sweet, juicy finish. This beer is outstanding when fresh (drink now) and hits the dry hopped wild ale target better than my previous style favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are almost two beers here. The first shows up with a huge juicy hop burst. On second sips the sour and funk come through. Which end up intermingling perfectly. Well made, and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid beer that I could defiantly see myself drinking outdoors in the summer heat, however at $8.99 per 500ml, I doubt I'll be doing so. This drinks like a beer that should be packaged in a four pack or even a six pack for the price of this single. As much as I love Prairies product, their prices are slowly pushing me away."

"Prairie just keeps hitting all the sweet spots with well-crafted brews that keep the flavor hoppin'. And While this one may not be as ""wild"" as some of its brethren, it sure does taste good, and has just enough funk to pucker you up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really nice. The fruit flavors work really well with the funkiness, and I haven't had regular Gold, but I think the hops add some nice citrus. Well done!"

"Pours from the bottle a hazy apricot with a foamy white head. Tons of carbonation. You can smell this one during the pour. Loads of bretty barnyard funk, hibiscus and tropical fruit. A swirl brings out the mango and papaya. Maybe a touch of pine. Taste is nicely acidic, but not overly sour. The brett isn't nearly as pronounced, and balances well with the floral and fruit notes. Mid-dry medium mouth that's is really crisp. This is a very good sour saison, another in a growing line of creative brews from Prairie Artisan."
