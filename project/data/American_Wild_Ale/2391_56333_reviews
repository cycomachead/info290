"Mild sour, some funk, nice blend of apricots and raspberries.  The balance is rather good."

"Huge alcohol ester smell. Underneath that, you get raspberry. The taste is where it's at on this. Hits you right in the corner of the jaw. Short finish. Makes you want to keep drinking it."

"Glad I snagged this before they shut down online sales. This beer is pristine and smooth. Delectable tart raspberries with some hints of oak here and there. Some lemon tartness adds into the mix, and some earthy notes come through as well. I should've bought more of this beer..."

"another gem from cascade, although i dont really know what i was expecting with peach nut. it certainly doesnt taste anything like peaches, and is in fact rather nutty and sweet, almost like and almond, while the tartness of fresh raspberries add to the tartness of an already very lactic sour beer, and the port wine adds a rich booze kick and thicker texture. to call this complex is a gross understatement, but unlike the sangs, this one doesnt resolve quite as well i dont think. the fruit seems intense, i find myself looking for the peach nut, which i dont even know what that is supposed to taste like, so im assessing it weirdly. i need to learn to relax on analysis and just drink a beer i dont understand. the fruit is great, raspberries are subtle, but bring the best out of the barrel treatment. the alcohol is a little sharp in the finish, but its a nice cut to the fruity sweetness. the grain seems heavier in this one too, fuller bodied and more dense. white port is not something i am real familiar with, but i still taste red grape here, maybe a skinless wine, not sure, but its a neat twist on the palate. as a beer on the whole this is genius, but its not a real good one to dissect, being foreign to the main ingredient. a touch more carbonation would lift it a little, but i like the slow unwrapping of it all. cascade is no doubt one of the best in the world at these inventive wild beers. maybe below my expectations, but those may have been ignorantly founded. beautiful beer, worthy of its high praise and then some."

"Overall: Another good one from Cascade and well worth seeking out. However, as is typical for them, this is a more clean and fruit forward sour, so don't go in expecting something funky."
""
""
""
"Overall - It's intense. Good flavors, but really really sour."

"For me the tartness in this beer overpowered the fruit and wood characteristics. A little disappointing."
""

"Absolutely loved this, the apricot and raspberry work beautifully together. The fruit flavors are balanced perfectly, great color, plenty of tartness."

"An 8 oz. pour at the Cascade Barrel room on 8/19/2014. The second of four beers I had while at the Barrel room (first being Sang Noir). Golden with a tinge of red. Clear. Very similar to Sang Noir, despite the lighter color. More acidic and lighter bodied. Nice play between the fruit sweetness, cherry sourness, and oak acidity. Light body and low carbonation."

"Shared at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. Pours a funky reddish brown color with fluffy white head on top that sticks around a bit for a sour brew. Beautiful aroma of apricots and strawberries, some definite vinegar and acidic notes to go with it. Flavor follows the aroma perfectly with juicy raspberries and tart apricots, and some expected sour vinegar flavors to go along. The body is juicy and finishes dry, with medium carbonation. This is easily the best sour I’ve had from Cascade, who has been a mixed bag for me. My two favorite fruits in a sour come together beautifully here."

"Pours a clear orange with a touch of gold a thin white head that starts and remains at the edges. Aroma has a good amount of oak and apricot with a bit of sour red fruits and light acid. Flavor starts with more raspberry and sourness with a bit of apricot towards the finish and an acid note that grows throughout."

"Ended up being very sour, not particularly complex and that is probably due to its age. I don't know how it was cellared since 2011, but it is delightfully sour and worked well as a palate cleanser in a pinch. I get the sense that this beer used to be more than this though, and would probably recommend trying this beer fresh."

"I totally missed the fruit in this one. The fact that it wasn't carbonated really threw me. I just had a bottle of this last week, and it was carbonated, so I'm not sure what happened. The good news was that the beer was still quite good, just a different experience. I was definitely fooled."
"Taste, this one does not disappoint, plenty of fruit character. Plenty of tart fruit notes (apricot) and sourness. Wheat? Some minor amount of cherry flavor with a stronger raspebrry presence in the mouthfeel. Throw in more and more citrus sourness and acidity. This is not a mild sour by any means. Carbonation is powerful. Hides the alcohol wonderfully."

" O: Pretty good and definitely enjoyable - a cut above some of their other offerings. That said, you couldn’t get me to pay the asking price for a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real enjoyable Cascade brew, very enjoyable."
"I had no idea what this was. I have had Noyaux twice in the last two months, and I don't remember it tasting like this at all. The other two bottles all had more carbonation than this one did, so we were thinking slight leakage maybe..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An ok beer overall but for what Cascade puts out, this isn't one of their better offerings. A bit flat and way too acidic and tart. I feel like the sour really covers all the complexities of the fruit they tried to use here. Where am I supposed to taste the toasted apricot seed meat? Cool to try but I wouldn't revisit this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is also sharply sour with vinegary traces of acetic acid in the mix, fruity sour notes blending seedy raspberry into other indistinct sour fruit notes. Bright and crisp with a very acidic edge to it, Carbonation is moderate, and it finishes dry with some traces of wet wood in the aftertaste. Overall pretty nice, and a bit more complex that the standard fruited sour ales in their lineup."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very pleasant sour from Cascade, which is no surprise. It has quite a nice fruit profile and the wine influence is a great subtle touch. The complexity is there and the balance is nice, but this is a fairly aggressively sour brew that isn't really all that delicate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O -Super acidic and tart but nice raspberry flavors do show up."
""
""

"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one at a recent Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, apricot, fruit, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, apricot, tart, sour, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I honestly did not know what to expect going into this one as I had heard of it, but not really paid it any attention. However, what I found was really quite excellent. The apricot notes in this one were really nice and very refreshing. This made it quite drinkable despite the major tart aspect going on. A really nice surprise that showed up at the tasting that evening that I wouldn’t mind trying again or seeing how it develops with a little time in a proper cellar."
""
""
""
""
"O - this is a really nice raspberry sour. The raspberry flavor isn't huge like NG Rasperry Tart, but there is just enough to compliment the puckering sourness. Another great beer from Cascade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. One of the better tasting sours from Cascade imo. Really enjoying this one and wish I had bought several more bottles."
""
""
"Overall quite nice, a very good sour, great fruit and barrel flavors, etc."
""
""
"O: Excellent sour by Cascade. I've loved everything I've had by them so far. Highly recommended."
"taste- well definitely one of the best I have had in a while, full on delicious sour raspberry notes, followed by a soft, lingering sweetness. mouthfeel is superb, the sweetness stays on the palate and does a folk dance across my tongue, it really won't go away . nice singe at the front of the tongue upon sipping, sour notes and a clean sour bite hit you while the sweet raspberry flavors play around and hang around long after you swallow this excellent brew. I shall certainly be ordering more from Cascade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, this was just lovely. I'd be pleased to find this in my glass any day or night. Maybe this Cascade thing will grow on me. Excellent, excellent beer."
""
"O - Overall, this was an awesome beer. Super stoked I got to try it. Big fan of cascade beers and I love raspberry so I knew this would be solid. Wish I had another one!"
""
"Served in hill farmstead stemware - pinkish orange body, fizzy white head with no lace. Extremely tart - unmistakably Cascade. Tart raspberry, apricot, sugar, highly acidic, sour apple, waves of vinous notes. I'm a Cascade fanboy, but fruit is my bag, baby. Dig this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: exceptional beer all the way around and definitely glad I have more to crack open at my dispose. Geeahh!!"
""
"In the vein of most other Cascades. Lactic sourness with fruit. Probably about middle of the road in terms of the Cascade fruit sours I've had. Some complexity is there, but raspberry overshadows some other flavor nuances. Still tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"9.2/10"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty stuff, in the style of Cascade's other sour beers. I like the combination of fruit, and the barrel treatment adds a nice element. Sourness is a bit fatiguing and can limit the drinkability."
""
""
""
"While this isn't their most sour beer, it's a damn good one. Very well balanced with a real good tartness to it as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Raspberry jam, apricot flesh, some tart mango, a good dash of lactic sourness without ever becoming too sour, tart plum and some oak. Really good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was another very solid American Wild ale from Cascade but I think it may be a bit green right now. The lactic presence is pretty abrasive and may need some more time to mellow in the bottle for the flavors to develop. I feel these blonde based fruit beers are best at around 9 months in the bottle but maybe that is just me. I put these beers in a high regard so maybe I am alaways expecting too much after sampling all the best ones; not as spectacular as I was hoping for but still super solid."
""
"I have yet to be disappointed by Cascade. Quickly climbing my favorite brewers list. There is a great combination of flavors with some nice woody notes. This is an amazing brew with mix of raspberry and apricot flavors. (5.0)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A damn delicious beer, so far I haven't had anything from Cascade that wasn't excellent, and this is up there with Sang Noir with my favorites from them, the use of noyaux is really awesome and unlike any other beer I've had before, this is a really great beer."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours like a can of seltzer would with a loose white head that fades as quickly as it forms without lacing. The body appears to be a cloudy, dull, rusty amber with a nose reminiscent of vinegar, berries (in this case raspberries and cherries) and no distinct notes of toasted noyaux. The beer drinks with a lot more fruit forward sweetness than expected followed by a tart, dry, yet sweet palate washing. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, and semi-sweet. It's definitely one of the most drinkable sours I've had since figaro. I'd recommend trying this beer, it's at least worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""
"Big thanks to boralyl for getting this out my way. Served in a Cascade goblet. Pours a peach color with a light pinkish tint. The nose has aromas of raspberry and light apricot, along with a pretty heavy lactic presence. Flavor is quite pungent and very acidic. Mostly lactic, but a touch of acetic. Fruit character is fairly mild."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pink hued golden ale with a loose surface of grey-white foam. Smells of raspberries, bits of marzipan, and a little oak - really reminds me of Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus. Some hints of almond. Taste is crazy sour - ripping my enamel sour! Raspberries are in there, but fuck, this is SOUR. Some acetic quality, but tons of lemon, and hints of apricot in the back end. Thin beer with low carb and a dry finish, but the tartness makes me salivate Pavlovian style. Crazy beer."
"Light body with a slight prick of carbonation. Pretty tasty beer."
""
""
""
"D - A solid beer, and one I'd drink again, but not my favorite Cascade offering. The acidity seems oddly disconnected from the extremely fruity and sweet flavor; perhaps a bit more time developing in the bottle with improve things."
"D - Not as hugely rich as I'd hoped. The fruit blend here is nicer in the aroma and is a bit more restrained in the taste."
"Amber with a dense, white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is lactic and sour with a moderate acetic character. Plenty of berry character is present. Nice. The palate opens fatty, rancid, greasy with a blend of raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Mildly buttery, this is oily and greasy. Poor IMO."
""
"O: I think this is my 2nd favorite beer from Cascade (first one being Nightfall). Quite pricey though at $25 a bottle. Seek this one out!"
""
"O: Had this one immediately following a Sang Noir, so the comparisons are inevitable. Noyaux had a better nose to it, but Sang Noir tasted better, offering up more fruit and a better balance. Overall, a nice beer, but not one that I think I'd want a whole bottle of."
""
""
""
"Appearance is cloudy yellow with almost no head. The nose is somewhat musty with a huge dose of earthiness, with tons of apricot and oak. Taste is very tart up front with a nice amount of sweetness. Oak is a little lighter on the taste than the nose. Cherry, apricot, and oak come through the strongest. Overall, very nice with to a of flavor."
"Overall: This is a really awesome Cascade sour! I am definately a fan of Cascade Sours! They have done this beer right as expected!"
"Really like this one, per usual with Cascade. Thanks a bunch 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
"Bought two bottles of this...may need to buy more. Pours a cloudy reddish-pinkish-orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Very nice-looking beer. Scent is wonderful. Good amount of acidic stone fruit and fresh raspberry. Wow, such ripe fruit aromas. Raspberries are more in the nose than any apricot (or other fruit) aromas. Wine-like aromas...chardonnay. Taste is immediately reminiscent of a dry chardonnay...but with a ton of raspberry flavor. The raspberry flavor is not forced or out of place though. Very fresh and complimentary to the flavor. Acidic, but only for the sake of great fruit flavor. This beer sure does have some great fruit flavor. Mainly raspberries, but as it warms up, you get apricots, nectarines, plumots, and a hint of strawberry. Oaky, wine-like finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat dry, and puckering in the finish. Drinkability is very high. Almost 9% ABV is non-existent in the aroma or taste...possibly there in the mouthfeel. Maybe a slight warming sensation. Overall, Cascade is just killing it with the sour genre. Never had a bas sour beer from them. I will continue to support this brewery if they continue to put out delicious gems like this one. I'm hesitant to age my other bottle, considering how tasty the fruit profile is right now."
"O: This beer is a fruit bomb, and very sour. I really liked how the combination of raspberries and noyaux worked. Just a really great beer."
"One of Cascade's more intense beers. Very nice but some funky brett would really blow this one out of the water."
""
"Overall, if you like sours, you will want to try this. Absolutely delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"To sum things up, Noyaux may be the best Cascade brew I've had the pleasure of drinking and none that I've had came close to disappointing me. A BIG thumbs up to Cascade's brewing efforts!"
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some berry, apricot, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a super tart and acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some fantastic flavors that make it a treat to drink."

"In retrospect, probably should have had this beer before the bourbonic plague. Regardless, this was another exceptional beer from Cascade."
"Pours a golden/orang-ish with a thick, fluffy, white head. Aroma of sour berry fruits, lactic-like yeast, and surprisingly, a very noticeable almond-like note from the apricot nut. Dry palate, very sour and puckering and very astringent. The raspberry lent towards fruit tones, but didn't stand out as raspberry. The Noyeaux made an appearance towards the finish."
"Drinkability is pretty high, this is an amazing beer."
"D- A perfect companion on a hot evening; what I fondly refer to as a porch-sipping beer. Simply a pleasure to drink."
"drinkability - truly an amazing AWA, complex and enjoyable"
"- Another huge win in the sour department.... this is up at the top of my favorite sours from them. I can't wait to see their lineup expand even more!"
"Very good stuff, but it probably took 3rd place at the event behind Sang Noir and Manhattan Transfer. Unique stuff that's different from anything else I've had."
"D: I enjoyed this one. The market saturation of American Wilds is producing a lot of high-quality beers. This isn't in the top tier, but it's enjoyable enough to be in the next one."
"D: For an 8.5% brew that smacks of all things tart and funky - well, it's pretty damn drinkable. The subtlest boozy glow, but really the test is how much 'wildness' one's palate can accept. The 10-12 oz. in this glass was plenty good in a short sitting, but I coulda/woulda/shoulda enjoyed another had I had more time to spare. Worth seeking."
"One finger frothy white head, medium dissipation with some lacing present throughout. Pink grapefruit colored cloudy body, a bit of visible carbonation. The nose is dominated by the raspberries, a bit of raisins from the port barrels, pinto pony horse blanket. Taste is the trademark Cascade Sour, berries up front healthy wallop of funk a bit of mango with a dry roasted finish from the yeast and apricot pits. Mouthfeel is light, very dry, astringent. Drinkability is dangerous at this ABV, perfect for a hot summer afternoon. Very tasty, another winner from Cascade, home of America's best sour beers."
"The flavor is of slightly tart apricots, raspberries, oranges, and white grapes, with a light acidity and a fairly clean lactic sourness. A slight musty quality is evident. Sweetness is at a moderate level and I notice a faint nuttiness. Carbonation was very low, but the acidity adds some texture. Another unique and enjoyable beer from Cascade."
"D: Cascade really makes some great sour beers and this is no exception. A fantastic wild ale that I hope to try again at some point."
