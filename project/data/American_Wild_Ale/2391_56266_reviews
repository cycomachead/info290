"2012 on tap at brew pub.  Ruddy chocolate brown with a few bubbles of tan head sticking to the snifter. Aromas of rich dark cherries, red wine and bourbon. Smells like a mouthful. Taste is quite sour.  The sourness overpowers the flavors present. I get cherries and some woody bourbon but the sour acetic/citric acid notes overpower the rest. This takes away from my enjoyment. Mouthfeel is dry and and thin with a sour aftertaste.overall a sour buddy with a nice aroma that is overshadowed with sour."

"Pours a cloudy dark red beer. Forms very little foam at the top. Smell is yeasty, funky, sour. Taste is typical of Cascade Brewing: very sour and a bit over the top. This beer has to be shared, as all other Cascade beers. Body is medium thickness, and even though a couple glasses can be enjoyed, it is better to share this one. Keep anti-acid close by."

"An 8 oz pour at the Cascade Barrel house on 8/19/2014. As close to perfect as possible. It starts brown with a copious head, producing a good amount of lace. Aroma: sour fruit and oak, very Flemish red. Nicely complex flavor: cherries, prunes, oak, bourbon. Dry with a light to medium light body and low carbonation. Lower acidity and more dried fruit than the usual Flanders red. A must have."

"Overall, just an awesome beer. It's hard not to say that it's my favorite from Cascade, but it's been awhile since I had the Apricot. Regardless, this is a fantastic beer that manages to be aggressively sour without being a tooth enamel-peeling chore to get through. An excellent balance of the acidity and sweetness."

"my brother is a deadset champion for sharing this bottle with me. its one of those beers ive been after for years, but my travels or trades havent gotten me there. what a rare treat it is, wine and bourbon sharing the barrel influence of this burgundy sour beer accentuated with tart cherries. i would put this one on par with any of the russian river dark sours, and i think it needs to be mentioned in that breath. its almost purple in color, darkened to a rich ruby wine shade and showing about an inch of really light lace head. cherry is evident from first sip, tart pie style cherries in there mixing with the bacteria cultures and the wine tannins, its a really mouth watering nose. the whiskey part comes more towards the finish in this beer, more hot oak than vanilla, with just enough char to slow it down to be savored. the body isnt real big, but it doesnt need to be, the flavor complexities ride and appear one by one on the sour waves, which are dominated by lacto, but not entirely. some brett in here too i have to imagine, there is some funk in there with the acid. it warms up to show even more wine properties, pinot for sure. its usually tough for me to identify a grape varietal in a beer, especially from a barrel, but i think its unmistakable here. cherries never get sweet, even exacerbating the already extremely sour feel to this. carbonation is mellow, but more isnt wanted for. the process and the execution of this beer are both something to behold, it never shows its alcohol strength, and at room temperature sips like a fine glass of port or something. cant say enough about this one, a crown jewel in the increasingly crowded fruited sour world."

"Cracked a bottle of this recently for my birthday. A truly superb beer that showcases the excellent balances of this brewery. Nicely tart, but with a depth of lush fruit and a firm backbone of barrel aging. The sour cherries in this are mouthwatering, and the bourbon adds such a nice complexity. A masterpiece."

"Overall: Cascade.. probably the most consistent sour producing brewery out there. I've had this in the past and prior I got more of a sour bomb with heavier lactic component. This is still amazing, hasn't changed much. This goes in the top 5 Flanders Reds I've ever had. Pairs amazingly with a cave aged gruyere."

"Pours a murky burgundy-tinged mahogany capped by a light beige one and half finger head. Excellent retention and significant lacing. Oak, light lactic sour, wisps of general dark fruitiness and berry-like accents. Opens with both sour and sweet cherries, plums, and cranberries. Very light brown sugar and molasses join in. Pleasant oaky accents throughout. Finishes with juicy cherry tart and sour, continued pleasant oak, and just a tiny hint of underlying bourbon notes. Lighter side of medium bodied; smooth with moderate carbonation. It's hard to find a brewery in the U.S. putting out better sours than Cascade and Sang Noir is one of their best. Truly exceptional."

"Pours a brownish body which sounds plain but is anything but. Strong blackberries, currants and cherries are accentuated in the flavor and the aroma very nicely. Body is quite lively and tartness isn't overdone but felt. First time trying these guys and i will come back for sure."

"2012 project. First beer for me from Cascade based on high recommendations from fellow BAs. Very pleasant aroma and for the first half of the bottle could not stop from enjoying it before every taste. Loved the sweetness and sour cherries. Very easy to drink and the 9.8% snuck up on me. I'm so glad I had ordered more than one. Can't wait to try this brew again after some aging on my other bottles. Enjoyed it so much I burnt my dinner."

"Sang is a beautiful cherry mahogany color on the pour. The nose is grenadine. Sang is more restrained sour-wise than the other Cascades I've tried -- and all the better for it. No need to grab for the Tums. The cherry and oak interlace perfectly and the bite of sour cherries is rounded out nicely by the malt. I had a Supplication last night, so it's interesting to compare the two. Supplication is more complex, but Sang is an excellent beer."

"O-This is a great beer and easily the best wild/sour beer I have tried in a while. It is complex with a great balance of earthy, sweet, and sour flavors. The cherry character here is really well done. as it permeates the beer, but never overwhelms it. The mouthfeel comes closest of almost any American sour beer I have tried to matching the feel of the best Belgian sours."

"Will happily drink this any time"
""
". Pours a brownish-reddish color with a small white head. Aroma is of tart funk, lots of tart and sweet cherries, oak barrel and light vinegar. Taste is complex, sweet cherries, tart cherries, light lactic acid, funk, sourness, some oaky wood, and not much of a sign of the alcohol. Very complex sour, very well done."
"Overall a very nice treat. Sourness is perfect. Not over done at all. All the flavors blend together just perfectly."
"O-Let this beer warm up. It becomes more sour and the balance improves. A solid sour."

"overall fans of lip puckering sourness will love this. recommended."

"Overall one of the better Cascades I've had. Really great beer, glad I got another of last years vintage"

""
""
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is somewhat effervescent yet meets everything expected of a fruited sour. I really enjoy tasting the barrel character in sours blended with the fruit addition. I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin head on a murky amber and copper body. Aroma of apricot, raisin, oak, cherry and caramel. Flavor includes a perfect degree of sour dark fruit, oak, red wine, caramel and earthiness. When you drink this one really let it sit on your palate to enou the sour degree. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This is a brief review for an outstanding beer. It lives up to the hype and will always remain a must try."

"Cascade Sang Noir (""black blood"") indeed drinks like some kind of dark, mystical gospel. A beer this intricate and transcendental is the stuff of folkloric legends. Of course, given how difficult it is to find (and expensive to buy) it may only ever be fantasy for most people. For those of you fortunate enough to come across this dream beer, be sure to enjoy it with someone you really want to impress (i.e, your favourite person in the world)."

"O: Sort of like a black cherry warhead in a sense with a less intense sour pucker. Zingy and tart with some sweetness from the barrel. Nice beer."
"This beer is good, had next to other beers in the style and it was better in many ways. Nice."
""
""
""
"O- This is probably a top 2 sour for me to date! Absolutely superb, and hard to find flaws in unless you can't handle really tart/sour beers!"
""
""
"(O)- A superb showing of what fruit, oak, and sourness can do together when blended expertly. So very sour, but so very good and welcomed with the incoming of warmer weather. Very easily my favorite Cascade to date!"
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best sours (and best beers for that matter) I've had the pleasure of trying. This is an example of the art of barrel aging at it's finest. Despite the high price tag, I'll definitely seek this out again."

"One of my first wild ales, and one that I will not forget! It definitely leaned towards the sour side, but was well-balanced and not too puckery. The appearance and taste were both outstanding. Poured a dark red/brown color, with a decent amount of head. Lacing lasted until the last sip, and really helped capture the aromas. Worth trying if you can manage to find."
""
""
"Deep blood red, light tan head with good lace and nice retention. Nose is bourbon cherry pie, sharp acidity, oak and cherry pits. Harsh acidity, but the bourbon smooths things out. Taste has light bourbon, oak, an intense sour cherry blast, tart, acidic, and more cherry pits. Finishes sweetish, but tartness prevails. Rich, intense cherry character, and a lovely malt profile. Medium full feel, lasting finish. Awesome."
""
"A cherry attack, following an invitation of funk and cherry in the aroma. A lasting head and spider lace. Above average mouthfeel. Mild acidity, its nothing compared to the sours we had today. A pretty perfect beer.Great and dangerous. drinkability.Liam's bottle, thanks!"
"Overall it reminds me of a bit of apple butter character and a toned down Weyerbacher Riserva. Still decent even for a one tricky pony like sense."
""
"A very well made sour, just wish I was more of a fan of the style so you can probably bump my grade up a notch."

"This beer poured out as a clear looking reddish color with a foamy white head on top. The retention is thin and not much lacing. The beer has lots of carbonation. The smell of the beer is tart, oak and sour cherry aromas are subtle but definitely in there. The taste of it is also sour, some sharp cherry notes in the fading aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is clean and tart, nice high level of carbonation that dries the beer out. Overall it's a good brew. Not typically my style but it's a good brew."
""
""
""
"This beer is really balanced in flavors with the vinegar sourness and lasting bitterness sticking their necks out among the other flavors. The oakiness is there but not over the top. In addition, I can't detect the high ABV at all and the buzz comes slowly, as this is a sipper. I was strangely underwhelmed, but then I realized it's because there is no one stand out feature due to the balance nature. I wouldn't age this too long, as the oak will fade completely."

"Smelled great, lots of cherries and some minor bourbon notes. Tasted amazing, slight sourness and bourbon on the front with a more distinct sour and cherry notes rounding out the finish. Cherries throughout. Amazing, for sure the best American sour ive ever had."
"D - A solid dark sour that's sufficiently complex, but doesn't really blow me away. I'd certainly have this again if offered, but I'd take Russian River's dark sours over this pretty much every time."

"Appearance is cloudy reddish with minimal head, plenty of lacing. The nose is full of red apples, cherries, oak, vinegar, and pithy character. Taste is very tart up front with plenty of acidic character with oaky notes. The finish is plenty sour with an adition of some earthy character. Mouthfeel is heavy with moderate carbonation. Overall, nice unique brew with plenty of tartness and fruity character."
"Overall this brew is a very good wild ale. The Cascade crew knows how to do them. There are some nice slight bourbon notes mixed in with intense tart notes. Great sour fruit with some slight vinegar and some nice cherry notes. There is a nice woody and tart finish with some nice wine acidity and tannin.(5.0)"

"Pours a deep garnet brown with a huge tan head that slowly dissipates and leaves much lace on the way down. Smells of balsamic, cherries, lemon and funk. Light alcohol note and a touch of wood. The flavor is complex and varied. Up front I get some sweet cherries and a light sweet maltiness. Tart cherries, a bit of lactic acid and lemons destroy the sweetness in short order. Woody oak come in next with a bit of funk and vinegar and an ever increasing lactic tartness. The finish leaves a lingering sweet tart candy feel on my taste buds. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart chalky puckering mouthfeel. Very nice Flanders style ale very complex. Maybe I should have asked for more than one bottle!"
""
""
""
" Enjoyed this one alot!"
"Drinkability – A decent wild ale, but a touch more sour than I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid beer, but I felt that the aroma was far superior to the flavor. Because the cherry aspect was so fantastic and the tart/acidic quality seemed a bit overwhelming, I would strongly recommend drinking this sooner than later."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This stuff is really tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an incredibly deep beer. I really enjoyed the wine notes along with the sourness. I'd definitely have more in the future."
"T: A nice lactic sourness upfront that's chock full of sour cherries, cherry pit and vanilla. A touch of bourbon before a finish that's long and ever changing. Pinot noir barrel, red delicious apple and some tannins on the finish. So freakin good."
""
""
"750mL. Pours full haze deep ruby brune. Wispy tan foam. Nose is apple cider vinegar, small red apple, apple skin. Taste is sharply lactic, big red wine barrel, Flemish red all the way. Very sharp and clean. Oerbier Reserva like. Loves. Palate is very sharp and lactic. Becomes sharper and sharper on the palate. Wow. 9/8/2012 6/4/9/5/15=3.9"
""
""
""
""
"O: Great. Worth the Hype. It would have been all 5s if the individual flavors had been more distinguishable. I am a fan of this."
""
""
"O: This is possibly my favorite from Cascade so far. Glad I shared it though, I think the sourness could get overwhelming if you drink the whole bottle. Excellent beer though, I enjoyed it very much."
"Overall: The merging of bourbon barrel and pinot barrels in the aging process of this beer produced a whole new kind of beast. I will absolutely seek this out again."
""
"Overall: for the sake of my wallet, I almost wish I'd never encountered this beer. I usually like cherry beers, but this manages to create a big and interesting natural cherry flavor without being candy-like at all. I'm gushing. This beer is great."
""
"O: Very nice. This is a good amount more sour and less barrel-y than I remember it on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall nice and refreshing. Very enjoyable."
"This is pretty tasty. A nice balance of sweet and tartness."
"There is so much going on in this beer, and I think this may actually be a flaw. This could use some simplicity. It's very sour, and very tasty, but a little crazy."
"One of the better wilds from Cascade. Lots going on. My mouth is a desert. Moisture is gone."
""
""

"Pours medium brown, with a hint of red. Gorgeous. Smells of different fruits, however cherry jumps out and is the most potent. Tastes like a cherry blowpop, with the dry back end of a cherry blowpop as well. Very tart and sour and well put together. Fantastic taste. My only knock, is the carbonation. To me, this is over carbonated and would've been much nicer with a less carbonated, creamier mouthfeel. Still nice, but not what it could be. That being said, this is fantastic. Kind of one sided as far as the cherry goes, but I think that was the point. I'd trade for this again in a heartbeat."
"Overall, a really nice fruit forward American wild and one of the better Cascade beers I've had, although I find their sours unbalanced a lot of the time. This was definitely enjoyable, refreshing and complex, but the aroma was a bit much upfront. I like this, but I think there are more enjoyable sours for the price."
""

"Sang Noir's flavor hits like a sour slap to the dome, blending complex tartness with disparate food characters. At once, brown sugar, green apple, balsamic vinegar and milk chocolate can be detected. Swirling the medium-bodied brew about the mouth activates both moderate fizziness and high acidity, with the sharp bacteria gripping the tongue like tiny rock climbers. The swallow brings the oak -- a huge, vinous blast peppered with sour cherry, lemon and vinegar. Granny Smith apple peel and Bing cherries blend in the finish."
""
""
"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
"O - I really enjoyed this one. It easily is one of the better Wild Ales I have had. The sweetnees and the sourness balance very well given everything that is going on in the beer. Can't wait to have some more!"
""
""
""
"D - I like this but im not blown away. The cherry is very natural and well done and reminds me of RR."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body with a bit of mild but sharp carbonation stinging the tongue. Really deep and flavorful beer that really attacks your taste buds."
"Overall this was a super surprise for me in a good way. I was intially hesitant on this beer because I am not a fan of cherries in beer, but I think more and more that it is that artifical cherry flavor associated with some Krieks or beers like Mad Elf. This has real dark sour cherry fruit flavors, mixed with the oak induced bourbon and vinous flavors which complement each other quite well. Not as stellar as Sang Royal but a slouch my no means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good beer overall. I wish the flavor was as complex as the aroma, but it's still quite good."
"Verdict: One of the best sours from Cascade, who is arguable the United State's premier sour maker. Such a great blend of rich deep flavors from the bourbon and tart fruit from the wine barrels."
"I didn't know what to expect from this though Cascade has had a long history of making very solid fruit sours. This is no exception and in fact, may be the best of the bunch I've had yet. An incredible beer all around."
"Overall- This one didn't come cheap, but I'd like to pick up another bottle. If you can get this one, I highly recommend doing so!"

"Tart, puckering medium body with a strong red wine barrel presence. Dry toasted oak with subtle lactic funk and a ton of vinous sweet fruit.  Hints of grape, tart cherry and other dark berries provide the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the sourness.  Slight acidity but not harsh or solvent like.  Tart and dry with lingering acetic vinegar presence that leaves me drooling formore.  Decent amount of sourness but very well balanced and easy to drink."
"Sang Noir goes out pretty dark red almost faded black but more of a badly burnt brown color shifting towards red. An off white head that is short lived with no stick. Smell is pretty promising. A nice amount of oak underlined with some bourbon tomes and wet wood. Some small berry scent with some lactic funk rising up. Taste is tart, leading in with big wood, oak, small bourbon, dark cherry and a lot of lactic sourness in the end, perhaps too much. The beer pretty much stays neutral from cold to room temp. The feel is medium and has some bubbles. The lactic blast is felt when getting this down the gullet though. It causes heartburn, quite unsettling. This is tasty beer, yet a bit too bitey for me. a 3rd of the bottle was plenty."
"Pretty purple ale with some light pink surface bubbles. Up front in the nose for me are the bing cherries and pinot notes. Nice and full bodied with a hint of ink and cassis. Some hints of alcohol and oak alongside leather and sweat. I like the already. The flavor carries more of the grape than I'd anticipated - refined, plummy and juicy. A bit of booze (maybe whiskey..) comes through just in the back end, but as an accent and overture - really nice. Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb. I like this beer - just ordered four bottles."
"O: excellent, would have again. I'm still not a huge fan of very dark sours, but this one didn't display any roasted notes to me. Only real downside was it may be more delicious if it were 7% ABV instead of nearly 10%. $22 per 750ml from the brewery."

"O: The first beer I have had from Cascade and I am a big fan. I look forward to trying their other beers in the future. Kinda dig the bourbon coming through underneath the sour/cherry flavor."
"The pour is a deep mahogany color with an off-white head. Smells of red wine, oak, and red wine vinegar, with a light balsamic character. Some dark fruit aromas are also present such as raisin, plum, and black cherry. Quite tart on the palate with good fruit notes of cherry and plum. The red wine character is strong and there is lots of tannic oak to it. Lactic tartness, a hint of red wine vinegar, and a mild leather note. Another good one from Cascade."
""
"This is simply an outstanding fruit sour. It has a hefty dose of sour, but it's not enamel-stripping, and the real highlight is the balance. One of the best that I've had, and I really can't think of how I would improve on it. Delicious."
""
"O: this beer is excellent, this is my second time having it, the first time I didn't really like it, I'm glad I gave it a revisit because it is phenomenal. Grab this if you can."
"bottle"
"O- I tried but failed to pick up bourbon but what I did get out of this beer was stunning and I might start touting this as the best sour I've ever had."
"O: Moderate-heavy sourness. Big cherry, raspberry, concord grape and lactic characteristics. Unfortunately there isn’t very much oak apparent and barely any bourbon. Just a hint in the throat if you’re really searching for it. Pinot Noir characteristics are there. A phenomenal Wild Ale and holds up with the best of them!"

"The only down side is that this is a powerfully acidic brew after a while, and you feel it: you couldn't drink more than one without it starting to hurt. But oh god, is this good. It's so damn good."
"O - This is really tasty. The bourbon notes are very subtle, more apparent in the aroma than the taste, and the huge tart cherry aspect is great. Not much funk, but still quite complex."
""
""
""
"O- This is really good sour. Pleasant to drink. Worth the price."
"Overall a bold, flavorful sour ale that comes together well. Great depth and complexity."
""
""
"O - I found their Kriek too be enjoyable, but a bit simple. This just puts that beer to absolute shame. What an amazing use of cherries. I think I prefer this to any Belgian kriek or even fruit lambic that I have tried as the whiskey and pinot barrel notes are just so smooth and seem to compliment the bing cherries. World class beer for sure!"
"Overall another amazing cascade beer...worth every penny"
"O - Overall this is a stellar wild ale/sour. The whiskey really adds something nice to this. The only downfall is how damn expensive this bottle is. That all said, its delicious, absolutely delicious."
"O- One of the best sours (forget American wilds) that I've had. Takes the top spot for me in the Consecration category. Seek and destroy this beer."
"The taste is sour and sweet with a hint of cherries and bourbon. It's very drinkable and has a rich, malty backbone to balance out the beer's initially tart mouthfeel. The aftertaste is strictly tart cherries. Overall, this beer is excellent and worth trying...However, it's tough to justify $27 for any beer that you would consume regularly."
""
"O- An incredible beer, the tart cherries and sweet malt and bourbon flavors work together perfectly, this was a real treat, very drinkable and complex."

"Enjoyed as a part of my 27th birthday evening! Big thanks goes out to dprouty who sent me this one in a recent! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku. Poured a dark ruby red-orange with a half finger light tan that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, tart, sour, wood, fruit, vinegar, and subtle raspberry. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, fruit, sour, tart, tart cherry, and very subtle vinegar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one definitely brought quite a bit of pucker power to the party. The aroma was pretty nicely balanced which made it really enjoyable and easy to drink. Really glad I got to enjoy this one, even it was a full bottle. An absolute must try for any sour fan out there."
""
"O - One of the best Sours I've ever had. Right there with Brute and Supplication. I was bummed at the price but it's definitely worth it if you like Sours."
"Overall: I love this sour. It has lots of oak, and a solid fruit flavor. A winner. And a beer that I can justify paying the $25 a bottle for."
"O- 7.5/10 sour factor. This is a great sour with the big green apple aroma and taste and just enough sour to go with it."
"Overall: Tried four Cascades(Sang Nior, Sang Royal, The Vine & Kriek) at our tasting last night and this was the clear winner by a landslide! Its up there with one of the best sours that I have drank!"
""
"Overall: I love Cascade sours, and this is no exception. Lactic sourness, lots of oak, and a solid fruit flavor. A winner, as usual."
"Yum yum, the cherries hit the spot on a hot ass day. One of the better sors ive had in awhile. Thanks egrace84."
"O - A really nice American Wild that we destroyed in minutes (between 4 of us). I have a couple bottles left, so I'm excited to see how this will progress with some age. Right now, good stuff and right up there with some of the best Flanders-esque beers."
""
""
"O: definitely was exceptional all around and to me was really similar to the bourbonic plague. Really glad I got to taste this one. Peace to my boy beezler who brought this down to Socal."
""
"O: Well worth the money at $22/bottle. Well-balanced is an understatement. The huge sour presence is complimented by a strong oak taste and subdued by a subtle cherry sweetness. As far as style similar to Pays Du Soleil from Saint Somewhere, expect a bit more malt body in this one."
"Cheers!"
""

"O: A little pricey, but well worth it. I'm just getting into sours, and this one gave a nice interesting twist on how I perceive them. I've basically only had fruit lambics from Cantillon before this, and it was nice to see an almost brown ale aspect built into the sourness. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it. I look forward to trying other stuff from Cascade."
"Overall - This got much better as it warmed. When it's cold, it's all cherry flavor. As it warms, the wine comes out and the body becomes more appealing. Upon a second drink of this beer, I'm more an more impressed by its complexity. The barrels each add separate dimensions and the fruits are dynamic. Superb sour."

""
"Overall. Very tasty beer that I found more complex than other Cascade offerings, but still (a little too) easy to drink. I need to get more of this!"
""
"This is one of the best flemish styled reds that I've had. A wonderful beer that encapsulates what a sour is all about."
""
""
"Big sour cherry fruit bomb with a barrel but not Bourbon backing. Comparable to Cantillon or Russian River."
""
" Blueberry"
"Overall sometimes less is more, this beer may be a bit much and could use a little less. The marrage of all the flavors is not seamless, but still works well. In any event I have really been wanting to try this for a long time, can't believe it made it to my market. Really, really enjoyed this."
""
"** 10/12/14 - Tried another bottle of the same vintage at a tasting. Definitely nice bourbon presence coming through now. Adds some alcohol heat but mellows the sourness a bit and melds well."
""
""
"Drink- It was very tasty. Glad I have a bottle to sit on for a bit to let flavors meld a little bit."
""
"Been looking forward to trying this one for a while and it definitely lived up to expectations. One of the more complex sours I've had, every sip was something new and delicious. The evolution of it from slightly chilled to room temperature was also good as different elements shone through more at various temps. Absolutely phenomenal beer."

"I'm very impressed with what Cascade has made here. They sure do know their s*it."

"This is a pretty easy beer for me to really get into. Cherries, sourness, mild barrel character that is way in the background."
"O - Good cherry tartness. So nice and lovely."

"O: An exquisite biscuity Flanders in the style of Red Poppy. also some great flavor contribution from barrels, improving drinkability. You would never guess this had 9.2% alcohol if it wasn't written on the bottle."
"Cherries and oak atop the sour base = deliciousness. Seriously, this is fantastic. Don't know what else to say except that I need a case of this stuff ASAP."

"Pours a murky brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with sweet/sour cherry and wood aromas. Taste is the same and strikes a very nice balance between the sweet and sour flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good sour with some great cherry aromas and flavors that are nicely balanced."
"O: Very drinkable and the flavours are very complimentary. An excellent sour."
""
"2011 Vintage. Pours a very murky reddish purple brown color with a medium yellowish cream color. Scent is quite acidic at first. Very vinous with a good amount of cherries and chocolate. Sweet dark fruits with a bit of funk, not a whole lot though. I'm very impressed with the chocolate-covered cherry aroma with a nice tart twist on it. Some brandy aromas as well. Taste is a pleasant acidic tart chocolate flavor at first, which turn to sweet/tart cherry. Such complexity to this beer. I am blown away right now. Nice bourbon.brandy flavors with oak and cherry. Reminds me of a quad with some oaky sourness. Outstanding flavor. Mouthfeel is slightly dry with a sweet, puckering finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an amazing beer from a brewery that continues to produce amazing sour beers."
""
"Wowza, what a beer. A real sour lovers specimen with plenty of intensity and complexity. Highly cellerable, for sure."
"Clear crimson body with a head that crackles away quickly. Smells strongly of bourbon and acetic acid, with an unpleasant metallic note that dissipates as the beer warms up. Vinegar seems dominant over the typical Cascade lacto character. Cherries are barely present on the nose. The palate is similar, very bourbon-heavy and rather sweet, with milder vinous notes and a hint of cherry. Stomach-churning acidity is pervasive and makes this beer a chore to drink after 2 or 3 oz. Pretty harsh and unrefined stuff, but not bad."
""
""
""
"overall: a great beer"
"Pours a hazed, dark brown ruby with a transient, thin head of tan bubbles; not much lace or retention. Nose as dominated by vinegar and tannins, cherry, vanilla and light acetic notes. Red wine and cherry are forefront in flavor with an underlying acidity and oak with mild vanilla sweetness. Medium light body, soft carbonation, acidic finish; this was adequately sour and fruity but not on par with Consecration. Easier to obtain bottles are welcome, but I'll be too lazy to bother with ordering any based on this sample."
"I'm off to my gourmet beer shop tomorrow to buy them out on this happy birthday weekend."

"O - This beer will not disappoint. Absolutely fantastic sour ale. Similar to the RR consecration but better. The pinot and bourbon barrels add a unique and charming character to this beer. I have had the pleasure of tasting a 4 year vertical and this one really changes with age. Word is that they will be bottling later this spring. You will want to get several bottles - some for now and some for a few years down the road. One of, if not the, best sour ale made in America today."

"o - Overall a very good wild ale, probably one of the better ones I've had from Cascade. Has an awesome sour nose to it, though I didn't get much bourbon at all. Would love to have it again."
"Overall: tasty but I was expecting much more from this one."
"Strong beer, thin to medium in body, sweet mildly up front with a winy, oaky, finish, decent throughout. Great beer but not Earth shattering."
"Overall, a really solid beer. I had waited a long time to be able to grab this one, and it delivered. At the same time, I think it could have been a truly great beer with a bit more whiskey character in the blend, sort of a Cherry Adam from the Wood with red wine and acidity. Still, a very nice beer that I would love to have again."

"The beer is ruby to copper colored with a small, quickly vanishing head. The aroma brings sour cherries, bourbon, oak. Smells tart. The flavor carries more oak and is tannic in nature. The bourbon is there, but cherries and a tart sourness are the primary flavors. Acetic finish with some alcohol presence. Similar to Russian River Consecration, a beer of which I am very fond. Very tasty. Overall, I am very glad to have tried this."
"Pours a reddish brown with a thin white head. Smell is a great mix of red wine and oak. Flavor follows the nose, great mix of sour and red wine flavors, pretty similar to Consecration. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice beer from Cascade, but not quite worthy of the high praise it has received."

"Rock on Cascade - thanks Biscuit for the great barrel bevs !"
"Overall: Awesome beer. Killer fruit presence combined with the wine and whiskey barrels. Drinks like a beer half its ABV. Highly recommended."
"Edit from 12/13/10 visit to the barrel room. Was told that they are now out of the 2009 edition, but had just put on the 2010 version. While fairly comparable to the 2009 version, the fresh 2010 version comes across as a bit more acidic and sour. There's still more than enough going on for me to enjoy this excellent beer, but as I'm not a huge sour fan, I found myself longing for the 2009 version (which I thought showed a bit more fruit and vanilla, and was not quite as sour). Regardless, there's no doubting that this is one fine beer from the folks at Cascade."
"D- I could drink this over and over and would still want more. It would be especially excellent on a hot day...with the sound of a mandolin being gently strummed and the slow, steady creak of a well-used rocking chair on a hot summer day."
"- One of the best sours I have had.. better than the others in the Sang series I think... though very close to the Sang Royale."
"Awesome stuff that I feel quite lucky to have tried a couple snifters of at Belmont Station. I'm more and more impressed with Cascade every beer I have. This was the standout of the evening with the other two beers at the event, Noyeaux and the Manhattan Transfer, also showing very, very well."
"D. I was sad when it was all over. Wish this one was bottled. One of the best wilds I have ever had. And one of the best beers I have ever had for that matter. Fantastic beer from a great brewery!"
"Pours a nice black/dark burgundy with a solid tan head and nice lacing. At first, cherry and grapes dominate the sweet aroma with hints of blackberry. But as it warmed, a great wood began to dominate. This was a nice sweet beer balanced incredibly well with the sourness. This had a little wild carbonation but a nice long sour finish. As this got warmer, the beer became more and more complex as various flavors came out. This was the highlight of Sourfest for me (and I sampled it three times throughout the day to make sure) and one of the best beers I've ever had."
"1/2 finger tan head, good retention, reddish brown opaque body, trails of carbonation rising up side of glass, Nose is huge frickin' cherry hit up front, more sour than sweet, little if any hops, with oak notes becoming more prominent as the beer warmed. Taste is cherry domination, tart, funky, sweet, some oakiness, all in balance an incredibly complex tasting beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full, not a lot of effervescence, not sticky despite the sweetness. Drinkability is high despite the ABV, just a crazy tasty beer. Thirty months of barrel aging, along with the sublime blending of Ron Gansberg, one of America's best Wile Ale brewers results in this truly amazing beer. An absolute must for aficionados of the style. Very highly recommended."
"Sang Noir by Cascade Brewing is a barrel aged sour brewed with cherries and 8% abv. It poured a pitch red dark brown with a hint of black. It smelled of cherries, Brett and sweet malts. It tasted sweet and sour with cherry goodness, malt and oak notes. It was my favorite of the bunch, but I am a fan of Cascade and any sours, so I'm partial."
"Poured into a tulip glass at Toronado. It's a very dark ruby red almost opaque with pink head, little lacing. Smells heavy of dark fruits. The Taste is delicious, very tart. It has lots of chery, fig and raisin flavors but is not sweet at all, mixes in well with the wood flavor from the barrels. The mouth feel is very pleasant, with just enough carbonation to make this go down smoothly. It's crazy how smooth this beer is for 10% abv"
"Drinkability is insanely good. This is their best beer I've had yet. I'm a big fan of sour darks, and this one really kills it. The intense flavor hides the strong ABV, making this one potentially very dangerous."
