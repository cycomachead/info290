"Can totally taste the hints of current and cab sauv. Wonderful offering from RR that deserves its rating."
"Wow!  What a beer.. Had on draft at BLAH, can't wait to do that again,  best sour drink I ever had.. Well it's the only one but I am going to hold all sours to this standard."

"This was was SO SOUR, but SO DELICIOUS. It literally made my entire body pucker. The wine comes thorugh nicely and the mouthfeel is on point. I aged mine for about 1.5 years and it drank so smoothly after."

"On tap at Beachwood BBQ poured into a tulip. Appears reddish brown with a thin cap that is not sticking. Aroma is sour cherries (the currants?), vinegar, barrel notes of oak and grape, plus tobacco and the yeast/bacteria funk. Flavors start with puckering tart cherry, ease into light fruit sweetness, and end with those drying red wine elements. Medium-full bodied, silky texture, active carbonation, and a dry finish. Complex and interesting overall."

"It gets no better than this, currently my favorite beer ever."

"O: Overall, this beer is very dry, very oaky, very wine-like, lightly acidic, with a strong alcohol taste. I hate to sound sacrilegious, but this beer really didn't do it for me. It just wasn't what I was looking for. If I really wanted all of those wine flavors, I might as well have gone with wine. I have found a few Belgian sours to be more pleasurable and interesting to me, but it is obvious that many people get very excited about this beer, so I couldn't not recommend it. At this price point though, I think I'll be holding off for a while before reevaluating this interesting creation."

"First time tasting a sour.  Pours a purple wine color with a little head and plenty of carbonation.  Not much lacing, but quite a bit of suds.  The odor is champagne like, fruity, lie de vin, farmhouse, yeasty, metallic, wine like.  The taste is very crisp, fruity, peach, grapefruit, currants, champagne like, wine, dried fruits and dry sour on the back end."
""
""
""
"Dark brown w red edges.  Aromas of crushed cherries and oak.  soft balanced palate with long lingering finish."

"O: Very good beer, the quality just comes through on this, not as sour as I thought it would be, very dry, alcohol is well hidden, I don't have too much experience with sours but I am hoping to sample more to get a better grasp on them."
""
""
""
""

"O-delightful sourness in a mild way delicious to sip like a fine wine"

"It was good, but not great. Sour, but pretty straight forward sour. not much depth."

"Pretty much just a Belgian strong put in barrels. No currants, nothing outstanding. Maybe an old bottle? Bottled 2013"

"Excellent beer tastes like a sour champagne."
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyable! Fizzy champaign like carbonation makes it a fun feel. You can taste the Cab from the barrel, the 10% is covered well. Cherries, very nice amount of sourness. A+"

"Begins with musty, wooden malts, joined by prickly currants, on which a dry, funky sourness settles, accompanying the fruity acidity. The barrel character provides wooden oak qualities, setting the balance of the beer. Then the sourness gets even dryer and more acidic, drying-out the tongue. Drinks dangerously easy, the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Finishes with matured, slightly wooden, leathery malts, with the addition of ripe grapes, while the tartness covers the outside of my teeth, leaving back a melange of joung currants and slick acidity."

"I was in San Diego for Beer Week and SD Taproom had  a Russian River tasting.  I was in pursuit of Pliny the Elder but got there too late.  The only beer left was the Consecration.  I am not generally a big fan of the sour beers but this was fantastic.  The high alcohol was well-hidden under the many layers of flavor.  One of the best beers I have ever had.  I can't wait to get the chance to try other beers from this brewer"

"Real nice balanced wild ale. A tad sour with real strong wine notes... Cherry, Grape, Oak, Green Apple, Cigar, Berries, Soda, Vinegar (think wine) a touch of Vanilla and Raisins. Nothing like I have ever had. I will say I thought 'Temptation' was a bit more satisfying for me. The more I sip, the more my palette really begins to crave it. Amazing carbonation. Overall, I would love to have this or any Russian River readily available~"

"Tulip pour at City Beer in San Francisco, and in several 375 ml bottles since. Rich but subtle; chocolatey, tart and a pleasant smidge syrupy. Hardly poundable, but a fantastic treat."

"Pours a purple/brown with little to no head. Smells very sour. Fig, cherry, wet bread. Can't really smell the wine. The taste is very tarte with notes of tobacco, tannins, wine, and an old wooden flavor to finish it off. One of my favorite sours."

"A dark ruby colored beer with a nice dense ivory colored head on top. Rich and fruity up front on the nose. The currants come through nicely here. First sips gives a great introduction to this beers wild side. Not immensely sour, but a nice tartness with a bit of a vinegary note and sour cherry. Nicely carbonated and a fairly smooth and creamy mouthfeel."

"Bottled 2014-02-11. Poured on 2014-08-13. Delicious as could be. Not sure what this is like super fresh or with another 5-6 months to put it at a year old, but right now it's uber-tasty. Wish I could come across more in an easier fashion and I cannot wait to try again and try it's brother/sisters (Supp, temp, Beat, etc.)."

"Bottle date 07.18.13. Pours a ruby brown with a thin, quickly dissipating off white head. No lacing. Lots of dark stone fruit and vinegar on the nose with gobs of oak, vanilla and red wine, what an aroma! Incredibly complex. Sour on the tongue with lots of oak, vanilla, red wine and black cherry. Ends slightly bitter but doesn't last long. The complexity helps tame the 10% ABV. Medium bodied with silky mouthfeel. Carbonation is intense initially but overall rather light. Finishes dry. Overall, a beautifully crafted American Wild Ale that takes its place in the pantheon of great sours!"

"overall it's a great example of a sour ale. We'll balanced and unique."
"Poured into a snifter. A: dark brown with a reddish tint, with a small thin lace of white head.  S: funky tart cherry aromas with a hint of chocolate. T: Very sour and funky with a cherry, currant and chocolate aftertaste.  M: medium bodied at first, but it does not last long. O: A very good sour, however I prefer Supplication."

"Like Supplication on steroids, you get flavors of cherries, oak, chocolate, cognac and sour citrus with a deep, caramelly malt backdrop. Appearance is a deep, dark amber with almost no light penetration or head. Thick, chewy mouthfeel and a deep, vinous smell. Worth over penny. A perfect beer."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, batch 005X2E. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing fairly quickly. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit flavors; with a great sweetness/sourness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, acidic, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited wild ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This still hangs with the best of them. My preference has always been Supplication and I've had many more Supplications than Consecrations in my life. But this right now is tasting as good as the Supplication I had the other night. They are really toe to toe and I may even be enjoying this a bit more but possibly because I hadn't had it for a good while. A classic, a legend, still wowing to this day."

"Certainly has to be one of my favorite beers of all-time. Pours a dark orange hue. The heaviness of the beer is masked by the sour taste while at the same time, not taking away from the sour taste. If you should find yourself in the situation to buy one, DO IT. Thank you Monk's in Philadelphia."
""
""
""

"M- Absolutely no head yet an interesting, effervescent feel to it. Fuller bodied than Supplication yet just as easily drinkable. Still can't get over how dry it is as well. It's in perfect balance."
""
""
""
"Poured into a chalice from a 1.5 year old bottle. Smelled very ""champagney"" and tasted the same. I was expecting it to be a bit more tart and sour but it wasn't. It was almost too balanced which unfortunately I do not like as much with wild ales. Still was outstanding though just not what I thought it was going to be."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a delicious dark reddish brown color. Smells pure of funky yeast. Taste very tart, maybe some blackcurrants, definitively some grapes from the barrels. Has high acidity. Has to be enjoyed little by little, if not it's too sour. Good work."

"This is a beast. Poured dark ruby with a 2 finger fine bubble head. The nose indicates this is going to be sour. Notes of sour yeast, neutral oak, and dried cherries. The taste is very similar to the nose. The taste is much the same. Excellent. Very smooth. High carbonation. This is an incredible sour. This is very rounded and consistent. Obviously drink this."

"moldy and vinegar aromas. flavor is way more sour than expected. a lot of grape, cranberry, currant, even some grapefruit sourness. starts off mellow in the sip. ends brutal, very tart. its complex though and each sip has a story to tell. still no supplication, to me anyway"

"O: My favorite sour as the interplay between the intense tang/funk/fruit/oak is just perfect."
""

"Overall: A surprising and exciting ale, even though I had an idea of what to expect going into it. Ridiculously funky in the nose with a leveling sour tang in the taste that is wrapped up nicely in a package by the wine barrel and some encouraging fruityness at the finish. The true story behind the name of this ale is that Jesus did not turn water into wine but water into beer, hence the name. Recommend consumption during worship services. Recommend pairing with dark chocolate with strawberry filling."

"Bottle from the brewery. Poured to a Ynibroue tulip glass. This one pours dark reddish purple with a hint of brown and a one finger off white head that dissipates quickly in a fizzy furry.. Aroma is strong vinous cabernet notes, sour vinegar, black cherry and other fruits. Flavor is a beautiful medley of dark cherries and sour vinegar, some bold wine like notes, other fruits, and a bit of booze intermingled with oak on the back end. Super tart and sour with nearly spritzy high carbonation. Heavy bodied and a big beer that can probably sneak up on you. Good stuff."

"O: Big sour fruits in this one. No major acetone, vinegar or even the typical citric acid. Just mouth puckering sour fruits. Very interesting. Big, sharp, bold flavors throughout. Almost no sweetness, all tartness with a drying aftertaste. Pretty unusual for a 10% ABV beer of any style. I'm not a huge fan of wine barrel beers but this is still a quality brew."

"The cats meow. I love Russian River Sours. They are second to non. Temptation is my favorite in the line of sours but this one is amazing as well. A little bit of the old world funk, and some nice barrel flavor as well. They have also mastered the perfect sour taste. Not like Love Child where it taste artificial and just pure sour. I recommend this beer to anyone."

"This is an amazing sour. I defiantly have a world yet to explore, but this is the sour flavor (at least) I have been looking for. Perhaps it's a more obvious beer than supplication (the only other RR sour I've had), but I appreciate that aspect. I really really enjoy this."

"An excellent sour beer. One of the best I've had. Though, I like Supplication better. This one is darker and much more harsh on the tongue."

"Overall, my first taste of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale that went through some sort of souring process. Forward with the overall taste of fruit, but the maltiness sticks up for itself. Not overpoweringly sour, but it definitely has a bit of a kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a fantastic beer. I had a vertical tasting at toronado in San Diego in August 2012. That was an amazing experience. Served from a bottle aged 1 year in my refrigerator beer pours dark purplish brown with very little head but a lot of fizzy carbonation. The mouth feel is fizzy with a pleasant tart puckering. The taste is vinegar and very little malt and granny smith apple peel. In my top five sours of all time and proof that Russian River is one of the best breweries in America."

"Beyond those criticisms, Russian River Consecration is a finely crafted brew. If you are looking for a brew to serve to a group of friends looking to have a few, this may not be it. If, however, you are looking for an immaculately-crafted beer full of surprises, then try this one."

""
""

"This beer really stands out for me having had it next to Supplication. I preferred this actually. It’s so interesting because I’ve never had a beer that has had more red wine character in it that this. This for me is probably the best Wild Ales I have had. What a treat. It’s so different and amazing."
""
"O/D - Enjoyed it. Too bad there couldn't be more malt complexity with the Brett dialed back. Carbonation was also a bit much and made tasting a bit difficult. Not bad for a wild ale though and was pleasant to drink, but didn't seem to break new ground for the style ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Reminds me more of drinking a slightly tart red wine than a beer (so to speak) but it is definitely an enjoyable experience. Due to the tartness, it was one that I needed to enjoy by sipping rather slowly but it is definitely a phenomenal beer. Nice job of balancing the sourness with the red wine flavors."
""
""
""

"O: This beer has a good balance for an barrel aged beer and doesn't seem too winey."

"Pours a deep ruby with soda like off white head. Smells like vinagar with some fruity tones. Tastes like tart plums and blackberries with a little bit of oak and a slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is light with fairly high carbonation. I had this beer years ago and hated it but I think I just got a bad bottle...this was very suprising."
"I don't know what temp RussiannRiver suggests to drink this, but if/when I drink this again, I will start closer to the temp I drink wine. It made a world of difference to me."

"Pours a deep red with very little head that doesn't linger for more than a few seconds. Definitely has a unique smell of raisin, Cabernet wine, champagne and sour dark fruits like prunes or dates. Initial taste is one of a rolling bubble champagne but complex taste where I really got some of the red wine flavors. Overall very delicious and a fairly heavy hitter for a wild on the alcohol content."

"O: 4 5 - one of the better American sour ales brewed with a concoction of yeast and bacteria; there are some really nice flavors and aromas imparted by the aging in cabernet savignon barrels; however, I am a little underwhelmed after seeing a 99 rating on BA; I picked it up for $13.99 in SF, which, to be frank, is too steep for the quality and have seen it for as much as $30.00 in D.C., which, to be franker, is insane"

"O - I consider this to be an Imperial Flanders with a twist and a very tasty one. Certainly not the most extreme sour, but that isn't a negative coming from a sour head. Brewed with careful restraint, but far from being bland. Very good beer!"

"Overall: Another awesome AWA by Russian River. It's definitely a beer that any wine lover would enjoy, and absolutely a beer that any sour lover will love. It borrows a lot of characteristics of the used Cabernet barrels, but the base malt really makes itself known amidst all the sour, dark-fruity and earthy funkiness. There's a lot going on here that comes together very well, and it's truly an excellent bottle of beer to drink. (4.5)"

"O- 7/10 sourness. Another good sour from RR. Light sweetness, with vinegar and dark fruits make this a well balanced sour. I would take Supplication over this but this is still close."
""
""
""
"Wow! This definitely is very different from other sours I've had, and is a totally different beast compared to Supplication, for instance. There's less focus on fruit or tart and lot more on grape must, oak melding properties, and bacterial funk. Not my favorite, but really refined and perhaps unlike any American Wild Ale in the country. I will be sure to save another one of these for a special occasion. It's not as accessible, and definitely for wine fans (such as myself) and of the strange and sour stuff, but it's definitely a must for people looking to get into more ambitious beer styles. World class stuff, in my view."

"Final Thoughts: This is only the third or fourth sour I've had but it was very good and easily approachable for any craft drinker. I would hazard a guess that the oak aging has really smoothed out the flavor. Would I drink it again? Yes, but it's definitely a special occasion type of beer."

"O - a phenomenal sour if you like sours, a nice blend that blends the best of wines and beers"

"Overall: A very different beer than supplication, which speaks to the creativeness of Russian River, in my mind. This beer highlights the balance and smooth texture of the ideal AWA and is well-complemented by cab sauv barrel aging. Equally as good, in my opinion. World-class. Enjoy whenever available."

""

""
"I was so pumped to have this...way more than worth it!"
""

"O: So I really liked this beers but it is not my favorite RR sour. It has some sourness and tartness but not enough imo and could do with a little more carbonation. Though that is really just nitpicking as this is a fantastic beer that I highly recommend."

"O- Yeah, I definitely dig the darker sours more than the lighter ones. Probably my favorite RR sour to date."

"On draft at Capone's, pours a clear dark red-amber with beige head. Aroma is reminiscent of balsamic vinegar and ripe wine. The taste is tart as expected from the nose, not as sour as some Oud Bruin, but RR Supplication, but still good."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a muddy red with high carbonation, no head at all and moderate lacing. Aroma of sour cheery, apple, citrus, with a sweet malt backbone. All the standard ingredients to a sour. Taste follows the nose well, sour cherry, tart apple, grape, oak, berries, sweet malts, and some alcohol. Feel is full bodied with a good tingle on the tongue. Very juicy, makes my mouth water. Overall a solid sour from Russian River. Can't wait to see how this beer ages"
""
""
"Very good beer."
"O: This is a pretty amazing wild ale. It is perfectly balanced in its flavors and is a fantastic example of the style. Highly recommended."
""
"O: I love the Russian River sours which really showcases the ingenuity, creativity, and wine background of brewmaster Vinnie Cilurzo. Consecration marries a dark sweetness with a balsamic vinegar bite with wonderful subtleties inbetween."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown, mostly clear body, head settles quickly. Smells sour and funky. Tastes sour and has nice notes of currants and Cabernet Sauvignon. Palate is alive and bubbly. Overall much better than the first time I tried this 3 years ago. Highly recommended."

"O: Great example of what's possible for this style. A very friendly brew that it full of flavor yet simple enough to enjoy on a regular basis if more readily available or if my wallet and gas tank could afford it. But regardless, great beer that I will continue to drink as often as I can visit our good friends over in Santa Rosa CA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Never had a beer like this. Good beer. Making me excited to try more Russian River."
"750mL b1 poured into tulip a clear, deep mahogany (cloudy brown with the yeast tossed in). Head is extremely temporary tan that evaporates. No lacing. Aroma is heavy on oak barrel character, port wine, sherry, sour cherries, a bit of spiced rum or whiskey. Amazing. Taste is mouth-puckering sour cherries, sherry, a bit of vinegar, warhead sour candies, a bit of warming alcohol towards the end. Palate is very much red wine: lots of Cabernet Sauvignon/blackberry/blackcurrant throughout the taste and palate. One of my favorites in the RR sour series. More robust than Supplication. Not as soft as Temptation and Sanctification."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a very nice sour that had a great wine presence to it. There was a nice fruity tartness to it. It's definitely one of the better sours I've had and I enjoyed it more then the Temptation we had right before this. I highly recommend checking this beer out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good sour ale, with an progressive taste. Even if redcurrant is not particularly my thing, I found the palate is even more interesting than the nose. It offers a very nice balance between sourness, woodiness and fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another world class beer from Russian River. Maybe not quite as good as Supplication, but still a very good sour."
""
""
"O: Such a fantastic beer. I'm glad I had one of the older batches that has had time to develop. I could see this beer having a more upfront sourness and vinegar taste. Since it had time to mellow out a bit the sourness is quite faint and upfront. It allows the flavors of the dark fruits, chocolate, and oak to really shine in the finish!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a magnificent beer--sour but so complex and the wine barrels play so well off the tart currants; so damn good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I like this beer quite a bit, it has a really nice, well-balanced smell and flavor profile that not many brews can match. That being said, the appearance is underwhelming and the mouthfeel is a little dead."
""
""
"O: The Cab didn't overtake the base beer which is awesome. It gave it just enough earthy undertones to provide some more depths of flavor. This is right up there with Supplication as my favorite RR sour. The booze is extremely well hidden as well. Well put together."
"The beer pours a relatively clear light brown/dark amber with a razor thin halo of white head. The beer's nose is complex with tart currant fruitiness, buttery oak, and blistering alcohol. As expected, this beer drinks like a fine wine with a tremendous amount of fruit forward flavor, yeast funk and oak. It's a touch too acidic, but the booming flavors pull together and mask the beer's staggering abv. The mouthfeel is puckeringly sour and mostly dry with a touch of initial sweetness. There is a mildly umpleasant funk that lingers, but the mouthwatering sourness cleanses the palate quickly. This is an excellent beer that's worth the hunt!"

"I have to admit, while I really like this beer, I can find similar Belgian offerings cheaper and more easily. It's worth drinking but it's not worth what you have to pay or go through to obtain."
"D - A bigger, juicier sour variant from RR. I'm not sure it has the finesse of Supplication but it touches that nice jam sweetness without offsetting the good sourness. Nice brew, easy recommendation."

"Pours a deep, dark maroon/purple. Very rich color. Strong aroma of cabernet grapes, cherries and blackberries. Flavor begins with puckering cherry and blackberry notes. Very nice. Followed by big tobacco notes, some of the best I've had in a beer. Bits of oak as well. Big bold and sweet cabernet wine notes on the finish. Great sweetness to balance out the beginning tart berry and cherry flavors. A big, bold sour. Very worthy of the Cab barrels it was aged in as it picks up a lot of this bold wine's flavor profile. Excellent."
""
"Pours out dark brown black with thin brown foam which quickly falls. Smells is sweet and funky with some wood. Taste is fizzy with nice tartness. Great sour cherry notes with some funk present. Dry finish with great sticky sweetness. One of their best beers."
"O: fantastic, even worth the $18 or more it sells for here in Philadelphia. Wish it had a bit more carbonation, but it's one delicious beer. This was a batch 5."

"I've tried this several times. The old bottles are insane. So complex and interesting. The newer bottles are great as well, but they push a lot more acetic and tart. Not a bad thing, just a thing."
"O - Very tart sour from Russian River with only a slight funkiness to it. This only really brings the tart was but it is almpmost too tart for me to pick up anything else in it."

"O: Delicious. Awesome barrel character. I can't believe this beer is 10%."
"Overall: A very good American Wild Ale worthy of a special occasion. I love the wine-like qualities in this one--although I do prefer Supplication. This one is a complex sipper that I would pick up in a heartbeat if I could find it."
"Reddish brown color with small off white head. Lots of sour in the nose. Red wine vinegar, cherries and oak. Taste is a nice sour cherry with dark fruit. Full bodied and decent carbonation. Overall one of the best sours out there. Dont waste time trying to age it. Perfect fresh."

"my most wonderful girlfriend hooked this up for me. it almost looks like a glass of rootbeer, brownish in color, lively carbonation, and a faint red glow. the head is excited but quickly receding. the smell is a dead giveaway that this is another russian river sour gem. notes of vinegar, decaying wood, dried plums, caramel corn, and cane sugar unite in an aromatic orgy. the taste is incredible, the currants are obvious up front, but the finish is what makes this beer. its so sour it hurts my jaw. sour more than brett too, its sort of like sucking on a lemon for as long as you can, puckery, funky, and delicious. its too complex to finger all the flavors here, but many many more of these need to be consumed to fully appreciate it fully. the mouthfeel is as perfect as it can be, medium body made light by the effervescent carbonation and tart bone dry finish that somehow makes my mouth water for another sip. how the hell is this 10% abv? it is not at all detectable in the flavor or the feel, and im just waiting on my buzz... overall this may surpass suplication as my favorite russian river brew. they do some incredible stuff out there, and this is the cream of the crop. if i play my cards right my girlfriend might get me another..."

"O- Incredible wild ale that takes so many different properties and delivers with a fantastic brew. Not many beers like this in the world. Will be trying to find a way to get more"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. It was extraordinarily complex, but blended so well that what we were given was a cohesive, definitive end-product. The sourness is gloriously huge, and as in the nose, each taste of it becomes more inviting than the last. Additionally, the 10% abv is almost virtually unnoticeable, allowing space for the yeast and the intrinsic flavorings to work their magic."
""
""
""
"Lives up to the hype. Incredible sour with great power, but also great balance. 10% alcohol is extremely well hidden and allows the beer to be more full bodied. Very, very easy to drink. A world class offering – reminds me of Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien. Only wish I could have this as a regular offering – the west coast beer drinkers are lucky. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Realistically, Russian River knocked it out of the park again and they've clearly demonstrated that they dominate not only with IPAs but also sour/wilds. I give the upper hand to Supplication, but try both!"
""
""
"This pours a wonderful hazy, ruddy brown/cherry red with thin whispers of foam. There’s an incredibly vibrant, tartly sour aroma of berries and cherries that pops and swirls and tickles the olfactory factory. On the palate it’s more more more, with a finish that I only wish lasted as long as the memories. Incredibly good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – An all around decent sour, but I drank it next to a Cuvee des Jacobins, which a lot of other reviewers did, and I think that was better side by side."
""
"O - A pleasing sour! I'd expect no less from Russian River."
""
""
""
"O: It has a depth of flavor that is much more interesting than many in this style. These different flavors play off of each other well enough that it doesn't overpower you with any one of them."
""
""
""
"O- I love these wine barrel aged beers from Russian River. They really do take brewing to the next level of creativity."
""
"O: Good, but not great. I'm not sure I understand the fuss. Not worth the price, but worth drinking. Good wild ale!"

"Overall: Good, but probably my least favorite of the RR sours I have so far (sanctification > supplication > consecration)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like all of their sours, this gem from RR is worth seeking out. As good as it is, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Supplication, which for my palate has a nearly perfect balance between sweet and sour. This beer is probably more for fans of intensely sour beers."
"O- More of a wine then a beer. Must say i like this more then 'Supplication' the taste and smell will blow your hair back."

"This over-hyped concoction was a major let down for me. After wrestling this thing for several swallows of varied volume...it ended in drain pour. A good brew should not make me pucker and salivate profusely. Consecration lacks the all-important balance I search for in a good brew. Now I can say, ""Been there. Done that."""
""
"2010 750 ml. Pours a transparent dark amber with a thin, light tan head. Complex aroma of sweet dark cherries and oak. Starts with nice biting carbonation and tart complex oak and cherries with some other dark fruit notes and good acidity toward a slightly warming finish. Shared with 3 other people, Damn I'm a nice guy."
"O - Yum. A gentlemans beer."

"O: This is not beer, it's wine. After I finished this I had to switch to wine for the night, there is no way to transition to an IPA or any kind of malt driven beverage after you have one of these. A masterpiece. Thank you."

"D - Very drinkable. I really like how sour the beer is, but at the same time the balance is still very good. The dark fruits really compliment the sourness nicely."

"Definitely worth trying if you like mouth puckering beers!"

"Verdict: This is fantastic, this beer is aging gracefully although I would be weary of aging it too much further as the currant flavors could easily drop off leaving behind a bit of a vinegary mess. The fruit flavors are nice and tart and impressively potent which is all one can hope for in an aged beer. If you have the opportunity to try a vintage sour from Russian River, make no mistake, you will be well rewarded."
"More amazing from the bottle than on-tap. Deep mahogany with a perfect dose of bone-colored foam on top. Sour certainly. But deep and complex. Cherry, plum, and toffee at the base with a nice spicy Brettanomyces note. Leather, shortbread, vanilla, and red wine vinegar as it warms. Great balance between fruit, sour, and malt. The price is steep, but the beer is nearly perfect. American craft beer at its finest. Oh, and the 10.5% ABV is silent."

"Pretty great; much like what I hoped it would be."

"D ~ Damn fine sour ale that showcases how well it can pair w/ fruit. Wild & refined complexity here. One of the greatest."

"Taste is good but not as exciting as the aroma. It has tart-sour fruits and wood up front, light winy sweetness. It is very drinkable, has a good, lively feel. However, it is rather one-dimensional and not interesting, lacking in complexity or depth of character and thus gets somewhat boring rather quickly."

"O: Definitely a good sour beer, though not my favorite RR sour so far. I considered changing my description of the flavor - I'm assuming that I tasted Cabernet, not merlot. But I decided to leave my initial impression intact and expose my wine ignorance."
""
"M: This is a lighter, medium mouthfeel for me. It's very drinkable and pleasant."
""
"Overall: He went from wine to beer... artist to artist! 10% ABV never tasted so... nonalcoholic?? Cheers!!"
""
"To me this is everything geat about Roddenbach Grand Cru time a thousand... more complexity, more sourness, more leather, more better. Clear brown with a dark red tint. Amazing! Currants, jucy, sour, balanced, tobacco, oak, and clove. Its hard for me to describe just how much you’ll like it. Subtle and delicious but crazy complex. Get it!"
"Was able to try this at the brewery. Poured dark rosey amber. Very sour but I preferred supplication. There's a little bit more of booze In the taste with a more malty finish.. Makes your mouth pucker though. This brewery sure knows what it's doing with sours."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a top-notch sour. I've heard these (and other) RR sours can go downhill after some aging, but I'm excited to check in on my batch #006 in a year or two. A must try. 4.5"

"Medium bodied with low carbonation; I would have preferred a crisper, livelier, and cleaner feel, although the finish is quite dry. Interesting beer to be sure, curious about the stillness of this particularly bottle. Very good, but not as appealing as Supplication, Sanctification, or Temptation for my money."

"Overall - Interesting flavors, but a huge sour ale that gets sluggish and repetitive as I drink it. Tasty, but not something I could drink all the time."
""
""
""
"The beer, poured into a tulip glass, gave a reddish brown hue with a modest head. The head rapidly disappears, giving a better look at the beer. The initial taste immediately caused me to think of a tart lemon candy. Though as the flavor develops, one can sense sour red fruit flavors that are rounded by oak chips. There are a certain vinegar notes, typical of a sour present. The spiciness leads well into the aftertaste which ends the experience on a dry note. The modest level of carbonation allows the flavors to linger and develop. Of course, this is improtant because Consecration is a complex beer."
"Overall this is a splendid ale from RR. It's probably my favorite wild ale that I've had from them (this or Beatification, totally different though) I usually try to keep these in stock because of how available they are, just finally got around to reviewing it. Great fresh or aged too, the bottle I had was one of the newer batches though, 007"
""

"Pours an opaque caramel color with no head. Tart apple and Belgian yeast aromas. Ok, so I'm not a wild fan at all. I mean, as much as I want to get it, I just don't. Have you ever picked up a sack of apples that have fallen off the tree? The sack was left outside all night. You went out the next late afternoon and picked them up. The movement stirred the honey bees inside. You stuck your head in the sack. This beer tastes like that apple sack smells. I do enjoy how after the beer disappears from the palate and I lick my lips, there's a sweet taste that, subsequently, appears on the tongue. I'm still developing my palate for the wilds. Bear with me."
"O: Very good stuff, a very drinkable sipper sour"
""
""
""
"O- the first time I had this beer I did not know what I was drinking. Several months later i now understand what a sour beer is I appreciate them much more. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I've had Sanctification, Beatification, and Temptation this week and this beer is just as awesome."
""
"O: A very good sour beer. There are a lot of dimensions to this beer; it covers sour, tart, funky, vinegar and tangy. The fruit flavor is also vibrant."
""
""
""

"This is my first Wild Ale. I'm impressed. It's complex, drinkable, smooth, refreshing, but a sipper. If RR was available around NC I would have this more often for sure."

"Batch #7: This tastes like he's starting to dial in the recipe; it is similar to batch 5, but with less acetic burn. It has a dominant lactic sourness (though it is not palate-destroying or stomach-churning) with a huge buildup of tannic currant and grape skin in the finish. The barrel is really prominent here; the cabernet sauvignon is unmistakable, making the beer taste like a slightly soured wine. Good, not great. (3.63)"
""
"O- Russian River is out of hand. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nicely done American Sour, the Cab barrel and Blackberry add a little something extra that is nice."
""
"The medium body is refreshing and easy to swallow but just a tad sticky. The carbonation is worse than a bowl of Rice Krispies with milk being added. As the beer warms, the carbonation seems to die down, really letting all the flavors come to fruition."
""
"Overall: This is a damn fine example of a american wild ale I really enjoyed this and was glad I tried it"
"Overall: Really, really dug this. I could literally picture the currants i was tasting in the beer. ABV has zero impediment and this awesome blend is excellent."

"This is a beer that every time I have I enjoy more, it just keeps getting better. I think I like it more than supplication now."

"O: Overall, an excellent beer. Very unique, and a must try for fans of sours, wild ales, and unique beers in general."
""
""
"O: Overall I enjoyed this beer, but it didn't wow me the way I thought it would. Still, for an American Wild Red Sour Ale I found it to be quite pleasant. I will have to branch out and try the other wild ales Russian River makes because both Supplication and Consecration were very unique and interesting beers."
""
"Overall, this is a very unusual, wine-like brew that takes on some unfamiliarity in the visual department but makes up for it when tasted. I was uneasy but now satisfied."

"Overall/drinkability- while this beer was better then many of the other sours I have tried it still just is not my thing, i just simply don't get it, i can appreciate the complexity and strong flavors of this beer but to me these are just super hard to drink, i mean when i say this beer is sour its super super sour like lemonhead sour, certainly a unique experience but for me just not enjoyable really beyond the novelty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Sadly consecration suffers from the same woes as Temptation - it just doesn't seem to have the depth of flavour that Belgian sours do. On the plus side, this is certainly the most drinkable 10% beer I have had! I will consider getting another bottle of consecration in the future - maybe a year or two of age will bump up the flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall...Not my cup of tea. The beer might've been too young, and I don't know anything about aging sours or the style in general. It's not too harsh or intense. Just not pleasant to me. Gonna stick to PtE for now, but I'm glad I tried it. Any insight to sours is welcome through beermail."

"I'm certain some lovers of this beer and/or sours will report this review (much like my review of thomas hardy's old ale). To these people i can only say i tried to be open-minded and enjoy having my own opinion, and that i prefer beer to wine."
"O - Another great sour beer from Russian River. Perfect blend of sour tart cherries with a hint of wine from the Cabernet Sauvignon bottles."
""
""
""
"Consecration is classified as an American Wild Ale, and the label gives hints of what awaits the lucky drinker. Words like Saccharomyces, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Lactobacillus hover around the words Sour Ale, and the excitement begins to build. Add all that to the fact the beer is aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels and you realize you have something pretty special in your glass. Consecration pours a reddish-brown, yet near the edges appears very plum like, with a quickly disappearing head that fizzes almost like soda. Hugely vinous aromas greet the drinker, including notes of vanilla, oak, Cabernet Sauvignon, and earthy hop tones/funk. The pallet erupts in an orgy of flavors, with the initial sourness giving way to darker fruit, citrus, Cabernet notes as well as earthiness (horse blanket) from the Brettanomyces. The fizziness noticed in the pour sticks around for the entire brew, a sign of a huge amount of carbonation that is met with a medium body."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is definitely a sipping beer, both because of the ABV and because one wants to keep those small sips coming along to refresh the palate and give it a chance to sort out the complexity. This is not a subtle beer, rather it grabs your taste buds and wrestles with them, challenging them to pick up and identify all the flavors. My overall impression of this beer is that it is yet another winner from Russian River and I’m glad there are so many Cabernet barrels in CA so that we can expect to see this one again and again."
""
""
"The Sept 2012 bottle pours with little head but a decent ring of lace atop a body the colour of American Mahogany. The nose leads with lactic acid, wine, and funk and is balanced by the smell of currants. When you take a sip the beer explodes with a lactic sourness rounded by the oak and a slight astringency from the tannins. Currants and acrid vinous notes hold the middle leading to a slightly sweet finish. With lively and sparkling carbonation, this is a great sour."
"M - Good amount of carbonation, dry finish. Medium body."
"O - Another RR sour knocked of my list and a great one at that. I like Cabernet wines so I figured I would like this and it came through."
""
""
"This is a style I'm just getting into. This is a great example of an American wild/ sour. The way I can describe it is it's like drinking a glass half full of wine and half beer. A very interesting beer."
"Overall this was a nice treat for me. I really loved the flavor profile despite it being fairly one noted. I would have liked to sample it fresher to see if I could have tasted more currants or some actual fruits beyond the sourness. Drinkability is off the charts expecially for how high the ABV is on this beast. A really solid sour and worth seeking out for fans of the style. Nothing mind-blowing, just super solid."
"o-what a wonderful use of the ingredients. truly an artisanal beer. Maybe some day a wizard for find a way to produce this cheap and plentiful. Until then I will drink as much of this as I can."
""
""
"I love the way this thing feels. Its not Belgian, but its damn close!"

""

"O: This beer is extremely impressive. The tartness and fruity notes are spot on. It's not overwhelming at all. To date... this is one of my favorite sours."

"I'll let the sour beer lovers have this one, as I'm not in that camp."
""
""
""
""
"Seriously, this beer is the f'n best thing ever. The pour comes out the same shade of brown as the bottle's label. It reminds me of root beer in its appearance and slight carbonation bubbles steadily rising. There isn't a whole lot of brett funk in the aroma, but more of a wine aroma. A friend said 'paint stripper'. I said that's the smell of 'awesome'. I can't write a review that would adequately describe the taste of this brew, or do it any justice. It's tart, sour, but not overly so. Your mouth waters after each drink, begging for one more taste. It has the perfect balance, allowing you to drink this endlessly. Despite being a heavy-hitter at 10% ABV, you do not taste it at all. The warmth from it comes through, but that is it. Consecration finishes with an dryness that finishes its statement of 'Yes, you are drinking the most epic shit ever'."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy reddish color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of oak and tart notes with some blackcurrant notes – very complex. Taste is also a very complex mix between some blackcurrant, some tart notes and some pedio with light sweet figs at the end. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation and no signs of alcohol even though it does pack quite a punch. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty complex sour ale, but it might be better to call it a ""tart"" ale. The sourness is better described that way. Highly recommended to try. Really like the balance, it provides a refreshing flavor on the tongue. If you like fruit-tart-wood-wine notes in a beer, you should love this."

"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, well disguised kick, good representation of style, this is a good sour beer to drink for a long time."

"Overall: an interesting beer to be sure, and the only barrel aged offering from Russian River I've ever had (Supplication and Temptation are in the fridge). It was certainly enjoyable, but I wasn't really blown away.. And I'm not sure if I'd be willing to buy it online again and eat the cost of shipping. Now if I lived in California it would probably be a different story."
"Overall : overwhelming well done brew. Strangely addictive the more RR sours I have the more I want. The best way to describe this beer is that it is somehow a hybrid of beer/wine/ champagne"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown in color with a small off white head. In the aroma, tart dark fruit and a note of licorice. In the taste, dark grapes, small tartness and small alcohol notes. A sour bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry grape and note of sourness in the aftertaste. A small tartness, nice alcohol note, and quite wine like."
""
""
"O - Excellent wild ale. I prefer the flavor profile of Supplication, but I have no complaints about this whatsoever and will have it whenever I can."
""
"Awesome fruity vinous flavors with a pucker and an alcoholic punch. Amazing how consistent Russian River can make an availably, high quality sour ale like this one. They never disappoint."
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a very good beer. Its not, in my opinion, on par with Supplication (which I had just a few days ago) but it is definitely a great example of sour ales and something I would pick up again given the opportunity despite the price tag of $13 for 375ml."
""
""
"Poured into small wine glass (only thing available) from 375 ml bottle batch 007. This is my first review as a member so pardon my inexperience in describing the beer. This is not one to pound down- definitely a sipper. The Cabernet comes through strong in the nose and in the taste. Has great carbonation. Sour cherry flavor and cabernet flavors followed by earthy malt taste. I'm usually not a fan of sour ales but this one is certainly one to try- after a few sips I was hooked. Very pricey but if you want something out of the ordinary go for it."

"Poured a dark amber - almost ruby red with minimal head and very little lacing. Beer was extremely aromatic and immediately noticeable once the cork was removed. Smells of a yeasty cabernet, wild cherries, roasty malts and oak. Those aroma characteristics were consistent with the flavor of the brew, some mild tartiness and yeasy flavors - a medium to heavy body, creamy texture and light carbonation ... very interesting. Not one I would continue to pursue due to personal tastes - but a very interesting beer to sample!!"

"O: Wild ales are a relatively new style for me, but this is one of the best I've had. The wine barrel aging is readily apparent here, and it really makes this one memorable. Definitely an after dinner sipper, like dessert in a glass. If there were one nit, I would have preferred a slightly more tart finish with a little less oak presence. But it's a minor nit. Consecration is the real deal. Can't wait to try more RR sours."

A little vinegar, currants, and slight oak all balanced perfectly. After taste is all oak.. Some vanilla and currants very mild overall. This sour beer leaves me begging for another sip!"
"This is a good sour and very easy to drink for the high ABV. I found Supplication tastier and more complex, though, with noticeable wine-barrel flavors. I'd love to try an older batch of Consecration."

"O - Another great brew from Russian River. I've only had a couple of the RR sours but this is one of my favorites. The wonderful taste combined with a pleasant mouthfeel and amazing drinkability make this an excellent sour ale."

"Sharing with sour beer fan friends Mike n Bryce (homebrewers). Poured with no head or lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy honey amber. Aroma is yeast, sour, oak, sherry, malt. Flavor's similar to taste but not as complex. Body and carbonation are perfect for style. Finish is like flavor, clean, balanced, and a nice alcohol prod. Very nice."

"SkÅL!"
"O- Another home run from RR. Extremely drinkable and I never would have guessed that this brew was 10% abv. This will join Supplication on my constant ""wants""."
"gotta love that classic, in your face russian river sourness! a very solid wild that i would never turn down, but perhaps not the best amongst all the RR sours."
"This is not a beer I would drink every day, but definitely worth revisiting once in a while."
"O - Looks like another winner from Russian River."
"In terms of drinkability and personal taste, I prefer the more delicate Temptation and Sanctification. With that said, this is still a phenomenal brew."
"O: Infinitely drinkable. I have absolutely no idea where these ABVs are hiding. Looked down and it was already half gone. Wish it wasn't so expensive because this is one of my favorite beers of all time."
"D - I'm new to sours and this was the first one that I actually enjoyed. It has a wonderful array of flavors backed by a nice sour funkiness. The high alcohol content is hardly noticeable, making this a very drinkable brew. The taste seems to only get better as it warms. Overall, an excellent offering from Russian River and so far, my favorite sour."
"Bottle to tulip. Smells good; like a strong ale should. Tastes Fantastic! I LOVE the Cabernet influence! Does wonders for the flavor. Complex, but not in a "" I taste plums, cherries, and earthiness, etc."" kind of way like you'd get from wine snobs. Just. Good. Beer. Mouthfeel is great; what looks to be relatively low-carbonated is actually deceptively carbonated, just as a sour should be. Overall, a great beer that I'll definitely be seeking out again!"
"10% ABV is very well masked. If I had to guess I would have thought it was around 6%. Sour beers tend to really cover up any alcohol taste. Enjoyable but at $15 for a 375 its hard to justify the price. I can get a six pack of a very comparable sour for around the same price."
"This beer pours a nice deep amber/red color. The aroma is a tarty fruit with a little bit of funk. This beer has an amazing taste to it. It has a sweet and tarty fruit taste to it. I think its more tart than sour and I could easily drink a whole 750 bottle to myself."
"I have only tried a few of the Russian River offerings, to-date, but would definitely seek this out again. Fantastic stuff!"
"This is a wonderful sour. I tried it first at RR's brewery and it was too much for a first timer. After some Oude Bruins the sour flavor has grown on me and now I can fully appreciate the more potent sours. This is flavorful and complex. The sourness is in perfect equilibrium with the amount of flavor in this beer. All that in a 10% beer that doesn't taste alcoholic at all. A must try, but don't dive into this expensive treat until you've tried a couple other sours, because some context really makes you appreciate it better."
"Overall: Not as sour or flavorful as New Belgium's La Folie, but better than most other sours I've had - especially given that it doesn't cost near as much as La Folie. A complex blend of fruity flavors but maybe a bit too sour as its a tad over powering. Definitely a contender for one of my favorites."
"Probably not something I'll come back to in the near future, but I can see the appeal and appreciate the quality that Russian River puts out."
"O: A fantastic beer that I can't believe I have left sitting on the shelves all these times. I have always been skeptical of the price for these but now i know they are the real deal. Will be coming back multiple times for this."
"O - Completely awesome. I love how the wine barrel aging really played a part."
"overall, a hell of a sour. of the few dozen or so different wild ales i've sampled, this is on a very short list for overall best. neck and neck with temptation."
"Pours a dark ruby red color w/ a sliver of a head on it. It looks very similar to a glass of wine, or a port. Head is gone within 10 seconds. Small amount of lacing on my glass, not much there at all. Nose is wonderfully complex. Wine, port, berries, funk, sweetness, some yeast all in there. Really opens up as it warms and airs out. Zero alcohol in the nose. I have a feeling I'm really going to like this one. Taste is equally good. Sour, but not overly so. All the smells really come out, and the flavor just blows my taste buds out of the water. cherries and some oak come out as the beer opens up. This is a very tasty Wild Ale, and I can't believe that it's 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is medium, w/ good carbonation and a dry finish. Almost a wine-like dry aftertaste. Overall this is a fantastic beer, and I would buy this one again in a heartbeat. Cheers!"
"O: Complex, but I feel my sour taste buds just haven't developed as of yet. Comes off a little bit harsh and is focused more on red wine flavors. I do enjoy some of the flavors though especially the woodiness and the tobacco in the finish. The nose smells absolutely phenomenal. I will respect it for what it is."
"O: this is a delicious and well balanced Wild Ale. The 10% is very well hidden and the range of flavors is vast. Definitely worth a try."
"O - Fantastic beer. A+"
"O- Really nice all over, looks and tastes great. Wish this was on shelves around here"
"I like this beer a lot and always pick up a bottle to enjoy whenever I can."
"D- Very sour to the point where it compromises drinkability. That being said, it's got a ton of character. I'm curious to see how age affects this."
"Dr: It hides its ABV very well, and has some great complex flavours, but does suffer from some minor issues, namely overcarbonation. I could see this getting better with age, but it'd be very difficult to drink more than one. It's nice to kick back and enjoy after returning from work, but sippers only go so far. Excellent value in California."
"D - Really excellent. I like it even better than when I first had it on-tap at the RR brew pub as I've learned to better-appreciate this style."
"We really enjoyed this ale. The label does not mention that is a sour. But it turned out to be an excellent example of the style. Poured a rich burgundy color with a faint aroma of currants. The sourness is very refreshing. Currents and rich cabernet wine flavor is evident from the start. The flavor grows more complex as the beer warms adding hints of tobacco and figs."
"O: Another great wild ale from Russian River. I have been lucky enough to have multiple vintages of Consecration. I am partial to the earlier batches of this beer, batches 1 and 2 being my favorites. Later batches are very similar, but don't seem to have the same levels of oak and fruit flavor."
"O - One of the best American sours, bar none. Give me another pint."
"overall its awesome and a good drinker, you dont know its 10% abv at all while you drink it."
"O: Delicious, such a complex funk."
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. The color is a rich burgundy with just a faint head with faint lacing. Very effervescent and bubbly. Can taste the wine and sweetness, easy to drink, with each drink changing slightly. Slight tartness with an after taste of sweetness. Probably my favorite ""tion"" beer. Will continue to seek this one out."
"12 oz corked and caged bottle. Pours a rich mahogony/ruby color, more or less clear and a small fizzy head forms and crackles away. Aroma is big and wine like, alittle alcohol peaks through, and then theres the funk which all make for a complex nose. In the taste, almost sweet and sour with grape notes, oaky tannins, bitter brett offering a strong sour, and alcohol is almost un-noticed. Malt body is more or less overrun by these strong flavors, but there is a light touch of caramel. Its all about the lovely sour in this beer though, and the delicate flavor of currents. The feel is medium bodied and semi dry. Overall, this is one hell of a beer and I wish I could get it all the time with a reasonable price tag. Mighty fine."
"O: I like sours so far, but I don't think I was ready for this one."
"mouthfeel - silky smooth a bit sugary. carbonation is funny. thought it might be overcarbonated but if anything its under. body is dead on."
"-Cheers"
"An all-time favorite of mine."
"Pour is a murky brown color, glows in the light, slight haze to it. Head is pithy and large bubble, doesnt generate much. Looks very oily and slick. Aromas are of soured grapes and dark fruit. A hint of oak woodiness can be found, but the buggies really jump out at you. Flavor is mellow and soft, bunches of sour fruits and a mellow caramell, oak, nuttiness to the finish. Warming on the palate, the body doesn't lend itself to the abv, but the finish reveals a little heat once warmed. Very nice brew, mellow, perfect sour level and nice funk to it."
"Overall: Interesting sour beer. Not my favorite sour we had that night, but its decent!"
"O - its sour alright."
"Not my favorite RR sour. Still love me that Temptation. I will say that the AVB is really well hidden... This is FFO Flemish reds."
"Overall, a very good beer. It looks great, smells great and tastes good with just a small astringency problem which comes from the use of barrels and bugs. A great effort by RR and I look forward to trying more of their sours if and when I make it to California."
"O: This is definitely my favorite of the easily available sour 'tion beers (Supplication, Sanctification, Temptation). A sour beer for red wine lovers."
"O - This particular beer confused me more than anything. Granted, I've not had much experience with sours to date, but I still imagine this has greater depth than most. I'd say its sourness in taste overpowered some of the darker fruits that the scent gives off, and the final product ends up tasting a bit like a carbonated grapefruit juice without any sweetener. But there is much more here. As it warmed, I felt that the malt I detected in the nose came out a bit more, but the yeastiness was seemingly lost in the sour. I enjoyed this, and have a bottle in the cellar that I look forward to revisiting in a year's time to see how it changed."
"O- One of my favorite Russian River brews. The wonderful meritage of sour, tart currants coupled with the complexity of the oak and Cabernet make for a very enjoyable sour experience. Highly recommended!"
"Poured a glorious garnet red color with no head at all. No lacing. Smells like a sweet red wine and fruit. Tastes like currants. The sweetness of the candy like currants balances well with the sour tart dryness. Tastes like cinnamon. Closest thing I've had to a sour red wine. Little carbonation. Medium feel. Brilliant."
"D - This is a fruity and tart wild ale, but with a lot of dry, thick malt and enough funk to keep it interesting."
"My favorite sour from RR's regular lineup. Big but not brash, simultaneously over-the-top in flavor yet somehow restrained, this is fantastic. I would love to see the funk develop in an older bottle, but alas, I'm an impatient man."
"Overall: Aroma and taste are matched incredibly well. No doubt that this beer genre is dominated by Russian River."
"Taste was dried fruit, like cherries and currents. Also got cranberry and red grape. The oak flavor that was so strong in the smell is much more subdued in the taste. There is a slight bit of alcohol warmth, but it is surprisingly not noticeable. Mouthfeel was medium, with a good amount of tingly carbonation and a dry finish. The beer was tart, but not over-puckeringly so."
"O: This is without a doubt one of the best ""sours"" i've had and really hit the mark with all the flavors. The most surprising thing is that the alcohol is almost totally undetectable. Great beer!"
"BEAUTIFUL, MUST TRY!"
"O - Delicious. It's hard to really explain it since it doesn't taste much like a beer and more like champagne. Seriously, you have to try this one. Incredible."
"Overall Impression- A very straight forward Wild/Sour! Pleasant, nice cherry taste/aroma, and well balanced. I am excited I got to try these two RR brews @ Naja's and will be keeping my fingers crossed to enjoy many more in the future."
"Overall: A very nice beer, bit high in the alcohol, but still dangerously drinkable. I prefer the puckering funky sourness of the Belgium wilds though."
"O-Could be slightly more balanced but it is still a great beer. It was my first sour as a heads up. Looking forward to trying more."
"D - Not sure if I could drink more than one of those but this is definitely the most interesting sour beer I have had. I think I prefer the sessionable enjoyability of Supplication. We had both of these back-to-back in a recent sour tasting."
"Beer pours a slightly hazy reddish brown, actually reminds me a lot of Coca-Cola especially the way the off white head fizzes up and then dissipates. Aroma is amazing, very complex for any beer. It shares some aromas with Cabernet, which is not surprising given that this beer is aged in Cab barrels. Black currants, red fruit, vanilla, cola and tobacco all come to mind. This beer has a moderate sourness with a fairly dry finish and just a bit of bitterness, I read biegaman's review mentioning that he associated the bitterness with tomato and although I don't get that specifically I will say that it has a certain umami quality that is usually associated with tomatoes, so I could see the comparison. Overall this is a very good offering from one of my favorite breweries and I think it has amazing complexity that is best enjoyed over a long period of time, letting the beer warm a bit and change over and hour or two."
"Consecration is an artistic and innovative experiment... that for all its intricacies and inventiveness ends up tasting a lot like watered-down cab sauvignon. What to make of that? It blurs the lines not only of the beer/wine world, but of the perspectives of the reviewer too - $11 is a lot for a bottle of any beer, but at $23 this would make a reasonably priced bottle of wine. I suppose for me, personally, that makes it more a novelty thing than anything else."
"O - Amazing beer, very complex. Sour, but not lose your lips puckering. Clean sourness. Lots of wine attributes. Would love to have another, especially with a lot more age on it."
"O: Offering up a wonderful blend of flavors, I found this beer to be sour, tannic and complex. Very good."
"Appearance is reddish brown with very little head. The nose has grapes, black currants, cherry and a tart quality. Its` taste is sour, red wine, lemon and is also sweet. A nice mix of different flavors are here. MF is medium with not very much carbonation. This is a nice wild/sour beer which lived up to its` solid reputation."
"I actually had a sample of this on draught a while back and didn't like it, I'm glad I gave this bottle with its hefty price tag a chance!"
"O- Awesome sour, one of the best and certainly very consistent."
"O: A good American Wild Ale that is quite tart. I preferred Supplication, though."
"Another classic from Russian River. Worth trading for or paying its hefty price tag. Excellent."
"Really enjoyed this beer, definitely on par with tempation and supplication, maybe a little behind. Definitely has a more tannin and red vinegar note. But great overall."
"O: I've had this a few times, and this wasn't the strongest showing. I wish I had made note of the batch as it was really quite a bit more acidic than I ever had before. This was my first time out of the bottle, but even then the youth of the wood and harshness of young currents pillaged the palate. This beer is much better in different batches, but I would say that the taste character is fairly the same. There was a bit more lime/vinegar than I'd like, as the flavors are already acidic and bold enough. By no means a crap or unexciting beer, but I dreamed of acidic remedies after this one."
"enjoyed this at a barrel aged tasting on 2011-08-06 alongside a sanctification, temptation, supplication, and consecration. my opinions were exactly what i felt on my first taste of this fine beer."
"O-gets more complex as i drink this. its definitely a tasty and well balanced wild. its very easy drinking considering the high ABV. there is no warming which is nice. i could drink a lot of this."
"Amazing beer. Russian River proves to be the best American sour producer there is with ever sour they make. Consecration is an amazingly well crafted beer and Vinnie has one of the greatest palates ever to be able to taste this beer out of the barrel and know whether it is time to bottle it yet. Consecration blows my mind every time I drink a bottle."
"O-Overall i liked this. But it was prob my least favorite of all the wild ale's by RR. It was nice a tart but didn't have a ton going on in the beer. Def. try this one but i will not be seeking this one out again."
"O - This was a very good beer and I'm glad I got to try this. Its not on par with the belgian sours, but this is a very impressive american wild. It was my first RR'ion beer and from what I read this is the bottom of the tier. Can't wait to try some of the other ones."
"Overall, my least favorite among the bunch and only because the base beer, and fruit, seem to have lost to sourness & funk. Did too many cooks (bugs) ruin the broth? 3.5/5"
"Overall, a spectacular showcase of RR's ability to make a funky sour beer."
"O- I pretty much love everything these guys do, I'm not gonna lie"
"O (D) - a pretty good beer, I'd say, with preference going to batch 005"
"overall: never had a beer like this, truly unique for a Sour Beer."
"Thanks again to Ken for bringing this one to a recent tasting. Poured a clear copper color, topped with a light white head. Aromas of funk, plums, currants, and vinegar. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied and tart, with flavors of red wine vinegar, currents and wine."
"Overall both are great... I think i like the batch 5 a touch better because of the thickness of it"
"Overall a great example of the style and one I'm working to appreciate."
"Thanks to GRG1313 for the opportunity. Batch 004X2 served in my CL tulip at 53 degrees. Pours a translucent reddish-brown with a loose, quarter inch off-white head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders leaving a broken, sudsy skim across the surface. No lacing on this one. Fantastic nose - oak, buttery notes, currants and a vinous quality all interwoven into a complex palate of aromas. Taste follows nose - no real surprises here. The flavors are refreshingly tart and the alcohol seems non-existent, despite the 10% abv indicated on the label. Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. The tartness lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks and there is also a slight acidic burn that lingers on the lips between quaffs. Not much more to say - a solid American wild with a great deal of complexity. Another impressive beer from this brewer."
"Pours a deep amber red. Off the of the pour the head dissipates almost immediately. The smell is that deep funk that we have all come to love with wild ales. A bit of cherry comes off the nose also. Taste is a mouth puckering sour with loads of tart cherry. The mouthfeel is light and playful, but not flat by any means. Quite and exceptional beer from an exceptional brewery."
"I'll edit tthis to state that this beer doesn't age particularly well in my experience, but is fantastic fresh."
"O- Very delicious sour from Russian River, very easy drinkability for how high the abv is, not my favorite of the sours released from RR but still very enjoyable, quality beer that I hope to be drinking again."
"Draft. Poured a clear brown color with an average fizzy off-white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy sour and yeast aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy sour flavor with a medium to heavy sour finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer for style."
"Pours an attractive vermillion-mahogany color with a delicate beige head with some tinges of ruby here and there. Sour aroma, dark fruits, leather, and vinegar. Flavor starts out sweet almost like a kriek or framboise, with notes of cherry, blackcurrants. Soon turns more tart with the more sour qualities of cherries, red wine, and hints of vinegar coming through. In turn moves to more dried fruit--figs, prunes, dried cherries--soaked in wood-aged wine. Finishes acidic and bitter overall, yet still smooth. Medium body, complex, and very enjoyable."
" Light to medium in body with fine, fizzy carbonation. Finishes with a long sour note and heavy dryness"
"Overall: Very good and I would highly recommend if you can get your hands on some. The alcohol is very well hidden for a 10% ABV beer."
"This beer pours a reddish brown color with a decent white head. the smell is slightly funky and fruity with a definite sourness to it. the taste is very sour with a definite fruit flavor that I assume is the currants, thought i have never had a currant and do not know what they taste like. the mouthfeel seemed a little heavy, not that it was sweet, but there seemed to be something about the beer that was fuller than most other wilds I have had. overall this is a good beer, would drink it again"
"Sucks your cheeks out sour. Dark red pour into my chalice with nice rusty head and adequate retention. Currants show through with intensity intended by the brewers. This was a great representative of the style and one that should be experienced before you die."
"Overall a very good wild ale."
"Another great Russian River beer. Not that much different from some of their other sours, but they all are quite delicious."
"Thank you Toronados!"
"Pours an amber/ruby color with almost no head. just a tad lingered. Nose of wild cherry, wine vinegar, and vanilla. mouth feel is great, perfect amount of carb. taste of sour cherry and vanilla, almost a hint of white zinfandel in end to go along with the booze bite. i did not find this overly sour, it was balanced nicely with the wine/cherry/vanilla flavors"
"I'm getting stinkeye from the crowd on this one. Maybe rightfully so. Last I checked though I don't get mad if you dislike the ipa or stout in your glass."
"O- Lots of sourness. The one I had a DLD didn't seem to be as sour, but has some age on it. Wouldn't be able to drink another bottle of this in the same night. Always fascinated with sours like this, try to pull out more flavors, this one was tough to do though."
"O: I've been slowly getting myself into sour beers and this one was a nice one. Great representative of the style, but a sipper nonetheless. I can only handle one bottle at a time. More mild then some of the sours I've had which made this one more enjoyable for me."
"D: This was a highly complex beer that was delicate but powerful. The scent and taste and body were all awesome. It wasn't overly puckering either, and the alcohol was undetectable (scary!), so this was very inviting to continue drinking. Could be aged for a long time, but very nice fresh. An excellent sipping wild ale, which I might enjoy over other Russian Rivers due to it's depth and balance."
"O- This beer is unlike anything I have had before. The wine characteristics were so prominent and the sourness and acidity of the beer made this a very tasty and memorable beer. This is the first beer my wife has ever enjoyed too, so I was pretty impressed."
"D: AMAZING. By far best beer I have ever had. For $17 for a 375mL it was totally worth it. Thank you Russian River."
"375ml bottle, Batch 5. It was acquired in a recent trade with BrewerB, thanks again Brian! This beer pours a fig like brown with reddish/purple highlights and an off white head that laces the glass. It smells of tart cherries, currants, grape skins, and moderate brett funk. It tastes sour cherries, tree bark, tannins, brett, and light alcohol. It drinks medium in body for a wild with a moderate amount of alcohol, but for 10% it is well hidden. It has a sharp, dry finish. Overall this is definitely a fine beer but certainly not the best I've had to date."
"Rating: 94 out of 100. Not as good as Supplication or Temptation, but extremely solid."
"O: Not my favorite from Russian River, but a nice beer overall still!"
"Overall: Anyone could drink this forever. Excellent beer, great sourness."
"Excellent beer. Flavors are a bit more layered than what I expected, retains the flavor of the base beer quite well. The higher Alcohol is well hidden, the 10% abv is barely noticed. This is just another reason I wish I had access to Russian River. Outstanding beer from a world class brewery."
"Drinking batch 001x4. This is like a whole new beast. And it's amazing. I'm tempted to upgrade my ratings here (which are already stellar), but I guess that's not fair. This is the definition of epic."
"A bit disappointing and one dimensional after Supplication. Not sure if there is a recommended drinking temp for this style but a bit more sour kick comes through as it warms and it gets more of an overall presence which helps define the beer. Would like to try another bottle some day as this ones now gone. Enjoyable but didnt leave much of an impression."
"Drinkability: A delicious and complex sipper. The sour is assertive, but not overbearing, as is the wine flavor. As I said before, I thought Supplication was to wine-y, this one is just right."
"Yet again a solid offering from RR!"
"D: I love RR sours and initially this was my favorite. Seems like a fair amount of batch variation with consecration but nonetheless a great beer by RR"
"I openly challenge anyone and everyone to do a blind tasting of these beers. They are interesting in their own way, but all I see them as is a vessel to deliver the bitter strain of yeast that they have in common. This beer is nothing more than sour, you cannot taste the currants or anything. RR Cornered the DIPA.TIPA market with the Pliny's and is in search of a new thing, unfortunately it does not deliver. These beers are nothing more than sour."
"Overall this is just great and I am going to stop writing now and just enjoy it while it lasts. Good RR, good job."
"375 of awesomeness. Pours a reddish brown, only slightly hazed. 1 finger head that doesn't stay long. Aromas of red wine and oak and so much more. Taste is tart with the oak and red wine notes, slight vinegar aroma. Overall another very tasty sour one of the best I've had."
"After all the hype, including the price, I was unimpressed. I was expecting an eye-opening sour experience, and I got what I consider an average experience. Maybe some more aging would have improved it; I don't know. Just underwhelming all around."
"D: This beer is sour, of course, but it is a very easy drink, unlike other sours out there. The 10% ABV is hardly noticeable, the beer is very smooth and well balanced."
"Drink and Overall: I gotta knock the appearance for lack of carbonation. I expected a little more head, and therefore more nose. It was wonderful, but I will update if I taste again with different reaults."
"D - I was happy to finally try a beer from Russian River...and I'm starting to get used to trying wild ales...the tartness level in this one was apparent from the first sniff and very apparent as you swallow...I liked trying a dried currant along side because it really helped me pinpoint the currant flavor in the beer...again, a big thanks to Deuane for sharing this one with me"
"cheers"
"D - This beer showcases to me why RR is considered one of the top, if not the top, wild ale producer in North America. Really nice complexity that makes this stand out from some of the other sours / wilds I have tried. I am going to have to get some more of this one for sure."
"This is a beautiful beer. It's a deep garnet red with just a wisp of head that quickly dissipates like soda bubbles. The effervescence carries a lot wine notes: black peppery, damp oak, crushed and blackberries, with just a whiff of earthy funk. The acid and alcohol and definitely present in the nose and on the palette. The wine notes dominate, with big fruitiness, leather, tobacco, and a dry tannic oak finish . The currants add a bit of jammy, creamy fruit. The finish is boozy with just a slightly tart and minerally finish. There is a bit of lingering funk that coats your tongue. Very tasty and complex. Great beer. Thanks Vinnie for making this."
"O: Damn good. My only complaint is that it's gotten easy enough to get around here that it's no longer the treat that it used to be."
"O- Very impressed. This being my first Russian River wild ale, I was expecting a great funky beer and came away with just that. A perfect send off beer for my best friend, Emmaus217. Good luck man."
"M/D: very little carbonation, medium body. Fruity and sour. I drank this after a cantillon rose de gambrinus, and I knew this was good, but it was tough for the Consecration to follow the Cantillon."
"O: Excellent sour. I prefer the supplication series, but this is a close second from RR. Good job again Vin."
"O: Solid sour ale, tastes great but I would drink a Supplication over this any day. The currants add a nice unique flavor to compliment the sourness and sweet fruit. Drinks really well for a 10% ABV ale, the alcohol is barely noticeable."
"This would go great with grilled goat cheese filled mushrooms."
"This pours out as a pretty nice wine like Amber Red color. The head vanishes quickly after the pour and just leaves a thing white film on top of the beer. The smell is super tart smelling, very acidic like vinegar. The taste is of sour cherry and stomach acid similar to a Geuze Lambic. The after taste leaves a dry mouthfeel in the back of your tongue. It makes you want another sip but since I'm not into this style too much it's almost unwanted. The mouthfeel is similar to a red wine in my opinion. It's an awesome beer for those who like the Wild Sour Ales but it's just not for me."
"One of the top wild ales in the world. I like some of the other russian river wilds better (i.e Supplication, Compunction), but this one is still very good."
"Poured into a RR Belgian chalice glass (seemed fitting?). Garnet body with a fizzy offwhite head that rapidly fizzy away quickly. Aroma is filled with oak & red wine notes; cherries, plums, grapes. Very barnyard-like funky aroma. Flavor is bracingly sour, funky, and oaky. The sweet fruity characteristics really shine in the flavor as well. Finishes bone dry with a mouthwatering astringency. Bubbly/prickly on the tongue with a rather light body. To top everything off, the alcohol is extremely well hidden, making this one incredibly drinkable brew. Russian River knows how to make beer."
"Overall alright but sort of pedestrian. Feels like a food beer than for casual drinking for me. It will do."
"Mouthfeel: This beer is definitely medium bodied, but is lacking a bit of carbonation for my taste. Fairly low for the style, but still good. Overall, a good wild ale that really satisfies if you're looking for something sour. I wish the other aspects of this beer were as good as the taste, because it is good."
"Mouthfeel is thin, a little filmy. Overall, I'm enjoying this more than the Sanctification in the other glass."
"as a whole this beer is amazing, will probably drink again as a special occasion."
"I've had the opportunity to have this on three separate occasions. Once at GABF, and twice at home with some bottles I was able to find while out there. The beer at first is unassuming. It pours a cloudy, hazy, mahogany with a small, tiny head. Then you smell it. Smell is oaked funk. Very sour, with a sufficiently huge aroma. First taste is an explosion on the tongue, with a huge sour note exploding outwards midway through the first taste. Wow. That's really all I can say. Must be tasted to be believed. The standard bearer for sour beers. . Pliny gets all the press but this beer deserves all the accolades - and more. Most assuredly up there with my favorites of all time."
"Overall this is only my second sour ever and I enjoyed it quit a bit.I have another in the celler, interested to see what age does to it.Try this if you have not tried it yet."
"M/D: crisp and dry like a fine wine never had that from a beer. All this blends together well and creates one very drinkable beer."
"Overall: I haven't found a sour beer that I like better than this one. The flavors are so well balanced, and the alcohol isn't anywhere to be found. Very smooth."
"D: This is a great beer, but not as good as fresher batches, IMO."
"Aroma is very sour with notes of fruit. The appearance is a brandy color with red hints coming through. The taste is sour, but in the best way possible. It is a perfect example of a wine-barrel aged beer. My favorite sour ale at the moment by far. Hopefully my local store will have some more soon. Russian River Brewing really has their act together with a great variety of top notch beers coming out, I have yet to be disappointed."
"Cheers..."
"O - This is the best sour I have ever had. The complexity is overwhelming. This is so masterfully crafted that it rivals the finest Bordeaux blends. This should be on every beer lovers bucket list."
"D: A great sour that is pretty dry. This was my first sour which I was excited about and scared about if I would like it. Cant wait to try more sours!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - My initial response after my first drink was that this was a heavy-bodied beer. But it soon mellowed out to be pretty average-medium bodied. Sour and tart with a hint of sweetness. Heavy carbonation becomes clear upon my first drink. Slight sourness left on the lips. Nice to sip and enjoy. Ethanol is hidden quite well but stands out at times. I think I would prefer sanctification over this one."
"O: This was wonderful. Very glad I tried it again. 4.5"
"D: This is an amazing sour. The barrel aging in Cabernet barrels with currents truly gives you a puckering affect that's sour and tart from start to finish. This isn't over done on sour instead is incredibly balanced for how intense and big this beer is."
"I could drink this one again; RR is more of a pain to get and I have a supplication, temptation, and sanctification waiting in the wings. It will be interesting to compare this ""more commonly"" available RR sour to a couple that tend to be a little more hard to get (especially to me)"
"It pours a rather nice looking grape juice colored reddish purple color with a fairly small off white head with no lacing. Smells of black currants, cherry, horse blanket, and a little funk. Tastes of black currants, cherry, brett sourness, funky yeast, oak aging, and tons of mouth puckering goodness. Mouthfeel is medium with a heavy carbonation and a crisp feel. Overall it is absolutely awesome."
"drinkability: probably one of the best sours I've, very pungent, but also very drinkable."
"O-One of the best sours to come out of Russian River. I could see this going another 2 years at least."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Uncomplicated, enjoyable flavor, with just the right number and combination of notes to hold your interest, without being pretentious or muddled."
"overall: the lesser of all the RR sours, but still not bad. price was $22 a bomber (Batch 3) which is much lower than prices for others."
"Overall: The best wild ale/sour I have ever tasted."
"One of my go to Sours that I'm finally reviewing."
"Consecration (noun): the act of dedication to the worship and service of a deity. It would be blasphemy to suggest that Vinnie is a deity, so how about craft brewing god? Bottom line: this outstanding elixir is another in a long line of outstanding -tion beer from one of the best breweries in this, or any, country."
"Halfway in, it's getting deep, plummier, richer...moreover. I'm more impressed-er, for sure. Deeee-licious. Mmmm. Mmm. Mm. M."
"D: Definitely a great sour. A bit drier then most. I think I prefer Supplication though due to a bigger fruit presence"
"D: As good as it is, i dont know how many id want to drink. Not to take away from the beer, but this is one of those that are probably most appreciated when served with food, not to be consumed in quantity. This beer bitch slapped my brain, id have a headache if i had another."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer pours a deep, dark amber color that appears to be clear, and starts with an inch of bubbly head that quickly vanishes down to nothing. The beer smell is an uncanny comparison to a light merlot. The currants are definitely apparent when you raise the glass to your nose. The beer has good carbonation throughout drinking, which helps to keep the heavy flavors light in mouth. The beer is sour on the tip of the tongue, and continues down the tongue, almost puckering at points. Dark fruit flavors abound throughout the mouth, with a slight peppery spice every once in a while. Very tasty, and again, the lightness and crispness provided by the steady carbonation make this a nice, smooth drink. The beer leaves a sour grape-type flavor in the mouth after each sip, but light. The sour aftertaste and the lingering finish pucker the mouth a bit, and it begs for another sip. Delicious!"
"The mouthfeel is soft across the palate and coats the lips like a soft red wine. Theres the dill again and sourness that gives way to more of the cranberry/currant tones. Theres a bit of sugar that I can actually feel light up endorfins, but the ale finishes somewhat dry. Makes the saliva glands leak with the sourness."
"Poured from bottle (batch005X2F) into snifter glass. Pours a deep reddish-orange-brown color with a small off-white head that dissipates, although there is some visible carbonation throughout. Aroma of sour lemon, tart cherries and other dark fruits (must be the currants), oak, vanilla, and some funk. Flavor of tart cherries and currants, sour lemon, tart apples, oak, vanilla, funk, and a hint of vinegar. The ABV is well masked here. Medium-bodied, with a sour mouthfeel and mellow carbonation. Complex, well-balanced, and interesting. I am not a big fan of sours, but am glad to have tried this one as well as the other RR sours!"
"All in all, this one definitely did surprise. This definitely is tart, but is so well blended that it makes this easy to drink. If you like sours, this will be like the holy grail of well blended sours. If you're looking for the most puckering brew around, this is not. It's puckering, but is so well blended."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly lacking much of the carbonation that was easily visible on the pour. I think it just leaves the drink before you know it. The beer is better for it though, as it drinks like a wine even more so. Drinkability is great: the beer has lots of strong flavors, yet I see the 10% abv and am perplexed. Finish is cleanly tart and nice, which sets up the next sip pretty well. This is even better than I remembered it."
"consecration would be nice with some food--thai, indian, duck confit, gelato, chocolate?--actually, that sounds good."
"Drinkability: Something I definitely enjoy, and a change of pace from my normal hoppy beer. Sour and enjoyable."
"D- This is easily the most drinkable sour I have tried. There is no appearent alcohol and such wonderful flavor."
"M/D: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Has a dry finish. Overall extremely drinkable, does not feel like 10% at all. Look forward to drinking this one again. Had it at the end of a night, so might amend this review later."
"Drink- Damn, I could drink this all day, fall off a bar stool and keep drinking some more. Was tastefully crafted with well blended flavors."
"Batch 005X2E. Had this beer quite a few times and I absolutely love it! Pours a slightly hazy brownish red color with a small white head. Scent is not nearly as sour or funky as I has remembered. It's actually very sweet smelling with some dark fruit aromas. Smells somewhat like a desert wine. I get a small hint of vinegar. Now here we go! The taste is like I remembered! There's that puckering sour taste I was lookin for! First I get some sweet dark fruit flavors...cherries and plums. Then I get a bit of vinegar flavor followed by delicious sour fruit. There is definitely some funk in the flavor and sweet wine notes. It finishes with amazing oak flavors and tartness. High alcohol is so well hidden that it's crazy. Delicious beer! Mouthfeel is very full and complex. Not syrupy and not as dry as other wild ales and sour beers I've had. Drinkability is high...as long as the ABV doesn't creep up."
"D: This beer is perhaps a bit sour, alcoholic, and expensive to drink more than one or two. That being said, I would drink it all the time given the opportunity. I would consider pairing this with an aged or stinky cheese. It stands up to other strong flavors very well, pair accordingly."
"D-- ABV hit me very early in this. Still very good and very drinkable. Very good with all the sourness but I wanted more of the cherry sweetness in this. It is a sipper due to the sourness but in some odd way that is what makes it so addictive. The flash of sweet and the huge sour kick. Very much like a cherry sweet tart and a better version of one."
"Overall, if you're new to sours, let this brew warm up. The tart will take the back seat, and the dark fruits and sugars come to the forefront. An expertly crafted brew, this can be enjoyed by anyone."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. This beer is sweet and tart which keeps the palate refeshed. I never get tired of drinking this beer, and am thankful that I have easy access to it. A fantastic beer. Caution is advised though, 10% abv will sneak up on you in a hurry!"
"Batch 04x2, 375ml Bottle purchased at LaBodega Wine and Spirits in Riverside CA. Pours a clear, beautiful reddish-brown color with little to no head. Aroma is fruity and sour. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Flavor is a clean sour with hints of fruit and oak. Extremely smooth. I said it about Supplication, and I'll say it about Consecration: I would drink this every day if money and availability would allow."
"This is a beer with a big flavor, but one that also seems not to be a beer. I could drink a couple glasses of this."
"This beer was a nice addition to the quality and craftsmanship of not only RR but what American beers are and what they are becoming. Good quality beer but is it worth the price tag? You be the judge."
"Impression: Sadly a plane ticket will be required for my next taste of this. If you see this get it and try it ferabsolutesherrrr!!."
"Definitely heavier than temptation and supplication - but perfectly carbonated and pleasantly dry."
"A 375 bottle courtesy of my buddy Steve on the West Coast (who is drinking Younger as this is being typed). Poured gently in to a Duvel glass, there isn't much heading here, though the color is nice. It is almost Dubbel-ish, coming out a murky rose color. Nose is full of tart fruit, strawberry, raspberry, sour funk, and a hint of dark chocolate. Mild sourness hits the palate at first, with an aftertaste of juicy stone fruit to round things out. Alcohol is nowhere ti be found on this one. Mouthfeel is medium, with the sourness always present, but never overbearing. The balance here is incredible, as is the case with pretty much all RR beers I have tasted. RR makes the wine of the beer world IMO, except more textured and delicious than most wines I have encountered. Russian River, please come to Massachusetts soon. Cheers"
"T: Jammy with an oaky presence, brett, a nice sour bite, currants, raspberry, black cherry and some of that wonderful cab flavor. This is a wonderful beer and shows absolutely none of its high ABV. Scary drinkable."
"overall - its not my fav. RR, but its very nice. I just don't think it needs such a high abv. it is very drinkable for a 10% beer though!"
"Appearance is dark red with very little head. The smell is bourbon, cherries, vanilla, and raspberries. As good as the smell is, the taste is quite a letdown - lemons, sour grapes, slight biscuit, bitters, and booze; really though, none of these flavors meld into anything too good. The drinkability is fair, but the sourness and the overall blandness of the taste makes one glass of this beer just plenty."
"Russian River, as is its habit, has deeply impressed me once again. It somehow has mastered the act of transubstantiation--it is able to take a worldly object and transform it into something heavenly, something sacred, indeed, something consecrated."
"another one to do it all over again!"
"Also, for some reason, I am getting a vibe of cool forests when drinking this, not exactly sure why, but it's a great, relaxing feeling."
"Drinkability:high for 10.00% but if I drink a 750ml bottles im pretty well done."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with no head. Aroma full of malts and cherries; slightly sour, but not overwhelmingly so. Dark malt flavor with some nice sour cherry flavor. Medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Darker than most sours I've had - I like the additional malts here, it works well."
"Notes: Not for the faint of heart. This is definitely a sour-lover's beer. Work up to this one. You'll be glad you did."
"Love this and all of the RR sours. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up..."
"This beer has an incredible balance of tart, acidic, funky sourness and sweet, vinous dark fruit and it is the perfect blend of the wine and craft beer worlds."
"D:10%??? Doesn't feel like 10% at all, extremely easy to drink!"
"D- This does not taste alcoholic."
"D - So impossibly easy to drink for a 10%. No booze at all. Delicious and a real joy to experience such a unique beer. High marks because of the ease of drinking compared to the ABV."
"D - Very drinkable, ABV doesn't seem like it's close to 10%. One of the most sour beers I have ever had, but still surprisingly easy to drink and go back for more."
"Loved having this in the bottle as well, the cork was all twisted to one side, so you knew there was lots of carbonation in there (not too much though)."
"D - While this is certainly a sipper, I had absolutely no problem drinking the bottle (almost) by myself."
"The feel of this beer is pretty big, there is a large flavor and it finds its way down but has an aftertaste that lasts and lasts. Smooth is the feel but there is a punch coming at the end"
"Drinkability is high and is a beer I wish I had more of!"
"I prefer Temptation or Supplication but I'll rate this high anyway being that it is still an amazing sour. Thanks again Russian River (and thank you bartender for the free beer!)"
"Pours a very dark garnet color, almost ruby when held to the slight, lots of small champange sized bubbles that settled into a nice collar. The nose is restrained but inviting, sour dark fruits, figs and dates. Earthy, damp, musty are things that came to mind. The flavor is unquestionably more sour, very acidic, chalky, very dry. Has almost a chocolately, earthy component, not unlike characteristics I get from some belgian quads, definitely interesting. Oak from the barrel aging is also noticable. High ABV with this one compared to some other Russian River wild ales, the body is a little more full, the malt a little more perceived. After having this fresh on tap at the brewpub and after a couple years in the bottle, I prefer the older and bottled version."
"Drinkabilty - The alcohol is masked good, this is a session beer, and quite good for a sour ale. I could drink this again, its not the sour monster then supplication is. Wine drinker would enjoy this for sure."
"Aggressive pour leaves almost no head and little carbonation with a reddish amber color. Smells like a red wine, sour grapes, cherries, and smell the currants. Tastes like a sour red wine, picking up lots of tart flavors and light citrus. Light bodied with little carbonation and a dry finish. Very easy to drink, and @ 10% can sneak up on you quickly, just getting into sours, and this was a nice one to enjoy."
"A very complex beer."
"Beer? This is somthing a bit beyond beer. Perhaps it needs it own catagory. Glad I tried it for the experiance but not a beer for watching the game tonight. This is unique and very different. As this is is quite a long review, I have had quite a few sips and I must say as both it and I warm up, that it is growing on me. Sort of like those sour candies that you just cant stop eating."
" Super happy I tried and not close to what I was expecting."
"Drinkability- alcohol is well masked, may be a bit too sour and tart for some due to the style...but well balanced with the fruit and easy to drink...but hard to find on the East Coast...and when you do it comes with a high price tag."
"The CPJ"
"Batch 004x2. Pours a dark amber color, little to no head. A constant stream of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass keeps it from being completely still. Smell has a good amount of funk with some fruitiness behind. Taste is sour, but not over the top. Just enough lactic sourness for my liking. The currents are there, but in good balance. Starts off slightly sweet, and finishes dry, funky, and sour. Delicious. Mouthfeel is lively. The 10% is no where to be found, the nature of the style hurts drinkability slightly... but I could drink quite a bit of this one. RR is the king of American made sours, and this one is near the top."
"D- Almost too easy to drink. 10%ABV is not noticeable at all. This is just a great sour ale that is worth trying if you like sours. I wish this was easier to find around me, so far this is the best sour that I have had."
"Amazingly drinkable. I wasn't sure what to expect in regards to sourness but this is very well done and taste great. I'll be buying this a lot many times over and over."
"D: Very nice indeed. This beer could define the category."
"A little low in this category because of cost, availability, ABV, and taste. I think the taste is good, but not so good that I have to try another."
"I feel like there should be more to say about this but there really isn't. It's a straight forward, fantastic sour ale. It's a fantastic beer that is very drinkable and extremely enjoyable."
"D--Supplication is still my favorite, but this is a damn fine beer. I am consistently impressed by the sours turned out by RR. Obviously, this is a must try if you are a sour fan."
"D: RR has taken beers to a different level, which I mean in the most respectfull way. The aroma is as almost as attractive as the taste. As a fan of Imperial Stouts and big IPAs, at times I don't think I have the sosphistication for sours and wild ales, but this brew is easy to understand. The subelty of the complexity of this brew is the amazing skill of the brewer. So, the downside of loving RR is the difficulty in obtaining. Joy of the hunt."
"Had this on-tap at Toronado in San Francisco. Pours an amber-brown colour with thin off-white head. Great head retention and lacing down the glass. Smells of sour cherry with some vinegar and maybe some raisin. Huge sour flavour, but also a little bit of candy sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel. I think I finished this off a little bit too quickly."
"D= I think this is a great beer would love to try more."
"D- My favorite Sours and now one of my favorite beers hands down."
"What a great vintage and an even better way to share with friends. Thanks techster82"
"D: Incredible. Amazing. Easily rivals anything brewed in Belgium. Brewing brilliance at its finest. I wish it were more widely available."
"This isnt a beer youd want to drink too fast, more so to just enjoy it through out a night and good dinner. I probably wouldnt buy this beer again though due to the high price but Im glad I got to try it once."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. Strong flavors, but very pleasant and unique flavor profile. I want more!"
"Taste starts out with a sour pucker, the currants add a nice layer of fruitiness that isn't overly sweet, this is one beer where the barrel aging is perfect since it complements the beer wonderfully, the oak has just the right balance, the strength is well hidden behind the tartness, the carbonation is quite active but works for this style."
"Having bought this bottle in PA, I paid quite a bit for it. Looking back, I wish I had bought a whole case of the stuff. It certainly isn't the type of beer you could drink a few of in a night, but it is the type of beer you could drink one of all night. 10% ABV? I would have believed it was 6% if someone had told me, the alcohol is nowhere to be found amidst the layers of yeast, barrel character and malt."
"Got to try this thanks to rencelas. Poured into Schlafly large tasting glass. Pours dark brown with a reddish tint. Smell like plum and cherries. Taste is very sour but very enjoyable. I could share a 750ml of this but not drink one by myself. Overall a great first sour for me from RR."
"The body is light to medium, and the carbonation is softer than a lot of other wild ales (because of the relatively high ABV). This is very good, but not one of my favorites from Russian River. Still, this gives a unique flavor that one can't find elsewhere. I still look forward to trying this one again (hopefully soon)."
"A great RR sour, little expensive tho, but nice for a celebration night."
"D: It was fun to try... a lot of fun to try. But it's not terribly drinkable for me. I wouldn't have wanted another one that night, and I don't think I would be interested in trying it again until some time passes. I certainly wouldn't go so far as to say I'd never try it again, just not anytime in the next several weeks."
"d- not bad drinkability here. obviously it's not an everyday beer because of the style and the price, but i bought several to crack open sporatically. top notch beer from russian river."
"D: Goes down easily, very tasty, major kick, somewhat filling, very good representation of style. I can't believe that I passed on this when at RR last year. Oh how a year can make such a difference in opening up your palate..."
"D - hard to put down. lots of nuances to this beer that would lend itself to aging (lucky enough i have another bottle). russian river strikes again with a great wild/sour."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall, and more heavy then most I've had in the style. Carbonation is very high and sharp. Drinkability is good, it had some excellent flavors to it and some great complexity. As I said before I loved how it had both sweet and tart flavors at the same time. The currents were also excellently done. Very tart and sour too. Excellent beer overall."
"Shared by Fred82. Merci Fred! (batch 4x2) Brownish red pour with a ring of white foam around my tulip. Aroma is actually quite mild for the style, currants, subtle (winey) oak and sour aromas. Taste is this beer's strength, a well balanced mixture of sweet fruity flavors of the currants and the lemony tartness. Some oak flavor as well but nothing overpowering. Palate is smooth with a nice dry tart finish, I can also get a bit of alcohol heat, which I understand now that I've seen this beer's ABV. Not something I'm used to for the style but quite interesting."
"CHEERS!!"
"Very drinkable as a mellow and malt balanced sour. This may chnage over time, but much more enjoyable and approachable than I expected."
"For 10%, this is one of the most drinkable beers I have come across, and I will continue to do whatever I can to get my hands on this even if I have to drive 300+ miles every month."
" This is not a wild ale for the faint of heart, it is strong puckering and I consider it only above average drinkability-wise overall, just not something I could see have many back to back of, a good wild brew and I guess Vinnie has us spoiled because this is great, just not outstanding like his other American Wild ales."
"This beer is very different from its counterparts Damnation and Supplication and I would rank it second amongst the three. I would definitely recommend this beer-so good! Enjoy!"
"D - Fairly high. I really like this one but when you put all three of these together you really see how different they really are. I would rank this one last out of the three but it is still so good that you can not go wrong. Glad I have a few bottle of this in the cellar."
"D-Good. Nice representation of the style. I would drink this again."
"So delicious and packed with flavor that you can't put the glass down! And I recommend that you NOT put your glass down if you won't want to share! (as I found out)"
"Another exciting brew i get to sample im stoked and it pours a light reddish/brown sherry hue which starts off with the carbonation look of a beer with a frothy two finger head but it quickly recedes to look like a fine wine with no head left or lacing whatsoever,the aroma is a combination of dried red berries,figs,oak and of course currants,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated and to be honest the mouthfeel is a cross between wine and beer and flavours of red currants,cab sav,tobacco,oak and red grape sourness all come through combined rather nicely and the dry sourness right at the finish really makes it very drinkable for me as i do like my lambics and its 10%ABV is nowhere to be found it is so well hidden its not funny and overall if this is what AWA's taste like i think i might have found a new favourite style,highly recommend cheers."
"D: I would like to say I could drink these all day, but the acidity would probably wear out my tongue. Since I only have the privilege to drink one, I can only assume."
"Very drinkable, you hardly notice the 10% ABV on the finish. Becomes more funky as it warms. I like this beer..."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle, batch 3x3 with almost no head but still retains carbonation. One of the most aromatic beers I have ever had. Smells like an entire bouquet of berries and wine and a bit of wood. Tastes very very tart and has a hot after taste. Lots of wine flavoring that comes through in every sip. This is very drinkable for being so strong but it is still a sipper because each sip needs to be enjoyed and savored on a special occasion."
"A lovely beer, and it definitely makes me want to try Supplication - I'm curious as to what a year or so more oak aging does to this formula."
"I am officially ready to move to the San Diego area so I can have RR sours on a regular basis."
"The weight on my mouth is great. The beer spreads to all of the parts of my mouth and coats my tounge with a varie of colors. For being an acetically dominated sour beer, this is wonderfully drinkable. I normally can't handle these, but the finish here is so inviting that I can't help but drink more. I'm finding it harder and harder to not fall in love with Russian River. They need to start distributing to Texas!"
"Whoa way darker than I thought it would be... a ruddy cherrywood brown color with moderate tan head. I guess it makes sense since this is a kriek-esque brew, but it just surprised me. Smell is tart with some cherries, a bit of funk, some leather. Taste follows suit, a bit tart, but not as tart as some other RRs I've had, with nice cherry flavor that flirts with medicinal flavors (not overpowering thank God). Decent malt to it, a bit of an oak touch on the finish as well. MF was medium-light, dry finish, about normal for a sour. I was pretty surprised that this one was 10%, pretty easy drink. Worth a try, but at $17 a bottle, I find it hard to justify when I can get other fruit lambics that are almost just as good (or just as good) for half the price. Rose de Gambrinus, for example, (I know it's raspberries and not cherries) is every bit as good as this guy, in my opinion."
"I feel bad because my only experience with this beer is with lack of carbonation, so I can't tell if it's the beer or just the bottle."
"A dam good, well crafted beer. I could only drink one or two in a sitting, but I sure would like to have a cellar full of this treat. Another beer that will remain on my wants list."
"Overall, a good beer, a must try if you see it."
"Temptation is probably my all-around favorite from Russian River, but this and Supplication are right up there as well. A wonderful treat to savor slowly!"
"Highly drinkable. I would give this a 5 but it can get sour and a little cloying after a while."
"D: Very drinkable. Sour, but no trace of alcohol. Pretty good."
"I really loved this brew a lot... If this was available here, I'd always have some for sure... Its all I was hoping it would be... Better than Supplication which is the only other RR sour that ibe had... Was sad to see this 375ml bottle go... Could easily drink another one if the ABV didn't get me..."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers and definitely my favorite sour ale. It's a little pricey here in Philadelphia, but it's worth every penny."
"Drinkability: Definitely a bit of a rare treat here -- glad I've got a 750 mL bottle stashed away still for another special occasion; amazing beer, but at 10% and a higher acidity, I do feel it is good in drinkability, but not great."
"Bottle batch 004x02 poured into Oerbier tulip. A hazy dried blood redish brown with an off white fizzy head that disappears quickly. Not an attractive beer. Smell is sour fruit, cherry pits, sugary sour candy, a hint of wine oakiness and funk. Taste is not nearly as complex as the smell - sour grapes at first, followed by a hint of alcohol and some wet oak. Mouthfeel is puckering at first, light body with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Pretty drinkable, though not the best batch of consecration I have had."
"I'm still trying to get my palate for wilds but this one is right up there all the other wilds I've had, tart, dry and fruity."
"D - 10% is hardly noticeable. While the flavour is amazing I couldn't drink, or afford, much of it. A rare treat & very happy I bought 2 bottles."
"The clear amber looks absolutely glorious in the glass, sturdy and lovingly giving its all to you, astute beer drinker. Smells and tastes sharp and slightly fruity, currants. An absolute treasure, a pleasure. It rips its flavor into your throat, forcing you to appreciate or die trying. The alcohol comes out a bit but the sour dominates the profile. This is a magical beast, worthy of all praise."
"Batch 002X003 poured into a Delirium snifter with a color of dark cherry wood with brighter shades of red when held to the light. Loose tan head that is gone in a flash with little lacing. Smells of yeast, must and horse blanket. Lots of wood, cherry and vinous aromas, too. Taste is a wonderful blend of oak and sweet fruits with a tart lemon flavor, like a good red wine but with a sour twist. Not anywhere near overly tart or overly sweet, the two are in perfect balance. Subtle grain characteristic in the background. Clean on the palate with no real lingering tastes. Medium carbonation with a light body that has a sweet flavor but a dry and puckering finish. Drinks surprisingly easy for a 10% ABV beer. I will have to trade for more of this and try it fresh too."
"Have had this many times on tap. Lets talk about a Saraveza pour. Ruby hue with a beige head. Tart, funky tones, with oak and yeast on the nose. Well carbonated which balanced the alcohol and tart, sour characteristics. I could feel the alcohol going down my esophagus which was pretty warming. Some flavors of oak and wild yeast which was noticeable but not as smooth and tart/sour as I would hope. And the currants were very subtle and in the background mostly and a little in the finish."
"Very drinkable. Can and have sipped this for hours. The effervescence and tartness pace the consumption, and the quality keeps you coming back for more."
"D: I enjoyed this beer and the fact that it really resembled a wine, minus the carbonation. I would gladly have another but for the ABV which at 10 is very high. While I don't notice the alcohol presence in the taste or scent I am sure I will feel it after my first glass."
"This is as drinkable as an ABV of 10% or above could be."
"Overall it's an excellent beer that provides that perfect sourness."
"Overall, this is one of the best tasting, balanced sours I have ever had. The aging in Cabernet Sauvignon oak barrels, coupled with the addition of currants (and perhaps lactic acid or Brett) makes this a beautifully crafted beer."
"D: For a 10% ABV beer, the ABV is undetectable and the beer goes down easy. The drinkability is somewhat limited by the high carbonation in my opinion, as I feel that if I drank this too fast or in too high of quantity I would get the hiccoughs or an upset stomach. Overall, an interesting beer though, that I am glad I got the opportunity to try. If I was blind folded though, you'd be hard pressed to convince me this wasn't champagne."
"Poured a new 375ml into my Dogfish Head snifter. Fairly positive its the first batch in the new 375's but I have already recycled the bottle without looking at it. This beer pours a prune brown with just a hint of a tan head that leaves no lacing. Very little carbonation leaving no bubbles. The aroma is extremely fruity. Tart organic cherry juice with prunes and dates mixed with just a hint of fresh oak. It terms of tartness, most of it seems to coming from a lactic twang. The flavor is much the same. Sour cherry juice dominates the flavor profile. Hints of fig and date come thorough behind the cherry. Oak comes through at the very tail of the profile. Major lactic acid presence. It really feels one dimensional. This is really one of those beers that no matter how dirty your teeth are, they come out feeling clean. The mouthfeel is very full for a sour. Really enjoyable. It really feels full on the palate and finishes extremely dry. Great. I've been lucky enough to have every batch of Consecration. While it is a good beer, I dont think its in the realm of Russian Rivers other sours or in the top echelons of American Wilds."
"D- So incredibly dynamic. And the EtOH is SOOO well-hidden, it's amazing!"
"Poured vigorously into my Liefman's Goudenband glass, head quickly dwindles tan head forms thick but fleets me. The carbonation never quits moving, leading me to believe that this beer is still alive. Aromatics are so deep with vinous tones in this case it seems to be currants added to the mix for the super fruitiness. Batch # 004X3 weird stuff that keeps giving off a wonderful nose. Hints of sherry vinaigrette blowing off the rapid bubbling head, mild cider notes with wild funky tones that could only be dreamt about if your not drinking this wild ale...horse blanket barnyard doesn't even do it justice. Flavor hits you with a blast of oak with tart fruits galore seems like currants are the victim once again. This beer dares you to keep drinking it make sure your immune system is up to par it hit's with a very acidic tartness that's probably not healthy for your digestive tract unless your consuming this regularly. If Vinnie just all about vomit acid inducing sour ales I've gone too far, but so far his Damnation was the best American brewed Belgian anything that I've tried thus far. I guess it's a question of do you really like sours? I do...it's so different from your average brew out there this wild fermentation really peaks my interest even if it ends in a sour vinegar lactic pedio WTF?"
"Drinkability: One of the readily available (seasonal or when they release it at least) Russian River sours. I really enjoy this beer and get it whenever I see it on tap."
"Sour beers aren't really my forté, but this tasted like wine and sweet-tarts. It was odd and flavorful. It was also a tad too sweet for my taste."
"Drinkability - A good sipping ale but hard to put down. Has a funky wine vibe going on."
"D - well, it certainly hides its very dangerous ABV quite well. also, this will be the third 750 i've polished off on my own, so i cant complain about the drinkability. where it lacks in subtlety it makes up for it with a clean and sharp mouthfeel and an old fashioned sour beatdown. was fortunate to pickup a case of this awhile ago - they will find a good home."
"Reviewing the latest small bottle offering of this outstanding beer. Light brown / auburn pour with a very short lived white head. No lacing. God awful funk smell, reminicent of rotten berries and old fruit - but in a good way. Taste is a lingering sour tart funkiness, mouth coating and pervasive. Very nice carbonation, which once settled, lends itself to a smooth sipping pleasure. Alcohol only becomes appearant toward the end. Drinkability in this portion is fine, but a large bottle would approach Cantillon level difficulties. This is a grand beer, meant to be shared or greedily hoarded. Entirely your decision. I wish I lived in CA."
"D: When in the mood for a sour I would enjoy a big bottle or two, it is delicious."
"Excellent beer. Wish it was readily available in Illinois."
"Believe it."
"Drinkability is quite good; definitely an enjoyable sour. I like the progression as it warms with the emergence of more prominent funk notes. I like Supplication a little better, but I wouldn't have any qualms revisiting this one."
"D: Very drinkable, but best enjoyed in small doses and I'm glad Matt was there to share it with me."
"Overall, a really great wild ale and one that deserves all its recognition. Highly recommended."
"I've had this once before and I think I enjoyed it just as much blind. I guess that's the mark of a good beer!"
"A very nice wild ale. I think I prefer Supplication, but this is also very good."
"Drinkability: The alcohol content shows itself pretty quickly yet you barely notice it. It's a very tasty, serious drinking beer that I like to drink slowly to savor the taste. I've had this many times on draft and can find bottles without a great deal of trouble when released. Philly has a good beer thing going."
"Drinkability: Probably a one-glass brew, but I will definitely revisit this one, as the experience is incredibly unique."
"Pretty good but underwhelming, definitely not in the league of Supplication or Temptation in my opinion."
"D: I will certainly seek this out again and be very excited to imbibe it. I did split this four ways, though, and that is about all that my mouth could handle in a sitting. Russian River, wow. Another great brew."
"Long story short: buy it and drink it."
"This beer in one word: Rancorous."
"Sampled this as part of my own personal taste test. I had both Consecration and Supplication at the same time. This poured a dark brown with a white head, it was sampled out of a tulip glass. The aroma was intensely sour with a lot of dark fruits mixed in. The taste was just an outright assault of sourness which I enjoyed very much. It was very aggressive while still having a nice balance between the sourness and the acidity. The body was very light, this didn't taste like a 10%abv beer. However, I don't see myself being able to have more than 2 of these since sour beers can tear apart the stomach after having too many. I could see this being too aggressive for some, those people would probably enjoy Supplication more since that was the more mellow of the two."
"MF/D: a sizzle of carbonation w/ a lingering heat and a quickly receding bitterness. like drinking a liquid warheads candy. certainly doesn't taste like 10%."
"Had two pours from the local Belgian pub and two bottles from the supermarket. Both showed a beautiful reddish-brown color with a small head. The taste was sour without being gaudy about it, with a balancing sweetness that covered the high ABV almost entirely."
"Huge thanks to a generous BA that set me up with this. Right now I'm so excited to try this. I poured this into a tulip, just as Russian River instructs me to. The pours is lively! Fizzy and awesome with a small head the does quite the vanishing act. It's here then gone! The body looks stellar, a beautiful dark cherry red with lots of lively carbonation. Smells sour. I like it! It starts with a sour cherry with a bit of vinegar; oak aromas with nice earthiness. This smells a bit funky with a sweet finishing aroma. I'm down with this. Tart right out of the gate! This is great, oak and earthy flavors with tart and sweet cherries. This has some solid funkiness to it. This is really well balanced, it's not overly tart and the mild sweetness is a welcome finish. The mouthfeel is nice, a bit drying to the end but the light body and the carbonation makes this really enjoyable. I could drink this all the time. I get a bit of heat from alcohol but this is so good I don't even care. It's easy to drink and this glass is lasting me a while. This is a really nice sour and I will certainly be seeking out more."
"D-I've only had a handfull of wild ales but this one i enjoyed the most. I could drink this all summer long if i had the access. I wish RR would put these in sixers and ship them over to the third coast."
"Light brown color with a thin head that quickly disappears. Very little lacing is left on the glass. The appearance was not really a disappointment considering the style. Wonderful aroma of wild funkiness, leather, grapes, currants, and wine. The finest tasting sour/wild ale I have drunk. Plenty of lip puckering sourness but it does not interfere with the subtle fruit and malt notes. The currants are tasted but they definately play a supporting role. This beer seems to be perfectly blended and balanced. Light body with crisp carbonation that seems well suited to the flavor. With the ABV way up there, it limits drinkability but the 375ml bottle seemed like the perfect serving size."
"Overall this is a nice sour. It is definitely one of the sourest beers I have had yet."
"I've got one more bottle of this; I'll update if that one is more carbonated."
"Between brown and black with ruby highlights around the edge where light catches it. No head retention, just a white ring around the side of the glass. Aroma is woody, earthy, with maltiness and a real dried fruit presence. Wine n grape notes really come through. This ones good but at 10% and barrel aged I think it needs time to mellow. Sour power up front and all the way through with a lingering finish that is funky n dry. Malty n fruity with flavors of deep toasty malt and dried fruit, leather and earthy. Pretty tasty and drinkable, but I always think that about sours. Nice mouthfeel, full and thick."
"D: Nobody does IPAs and sours like RR. Damn. This is sour to die for."
"Bought from a small beer store in Paulsbo, WA near Seattle. My first wild ale from Russian River, though I have been a fan of the sour wild ale style from Belgium for while. It's an attractive red, plum, amber color. Carbonation is fairly high and makes it looks just a bit like Dr. Pepper - but in a good way. The smell is really nice. Sour, cherries, alcohol, and a sweet/acid mix. The flavor is similar, but with more dark fruit, a bit of the cabernet and oak. I give it some minus-points because there is a bile-like quality as well that didn't sit well with me. Mouthfeel is nice and lively and it would be very drinkable for me if not for that bile-thing going on in the background."
"Delicious tartness with some great slight fruit sweet notes. The high ABV is nice and warming and lends the brew a richer note."
"Pours a thin head at first, which quickly dies to a creamy ring around the edge of the glass. appearance is pretty decent, beer looks very nice with some back lighting, a burnt brown glow. smell is not what i expected (having no idea what to expect), and is FULL of rich butterscotch, caramel, and toffee. dome darker fruits come out as well (can't place specifics, but very sweet), and a rush of sour apples. damn great smell. taste follows suit, very sweet caramel toffee with some sweet malt. the sourness is not as intense as other RR offerings (it is still the main theme though!), but it actually complements the sweetness very well and doesn't overpower the rich flavor profile. mouthfeel is where this one falls a little short for me. it's a little thin, especially for a richer tasting beer. the carbonation was just a hair much, though not distractingly so. the drinkability is good, balanced flavors and not tongue destroying sourness, and pretty light (see mouthfeel)"
"This is exquisitely brewed. This is the kind of beer that can (and did) help set off a national trend."
"This is a solid drink. It is so sour that I want more to believe how sour it is."
"Looking forward to more Russian River after a splendid first experience."
"These are expensive, and worth every penny. Absolutely delicious, refreshing, vibrant, exciting, and pleasant to drink. I only wish we could get RR in NJ, but at least Philly is within striking distance."
"M&D - layered and beautifully complex, the age on it mustve added to it, id love to compare notes on a fresh one, RR is reason #137 to move California"
"Drinkability -- It's good, but I'm not in love. Probably due to my mixed feelings toward currants. I really had to give this beer a chance, but toward the end of my glass I was feeling okay about it. Still, I won't be actively seeking this out any time soon."
"d - mind=blown. this is going to be my gateway sour. i'll go back to this one as the one that converted me to the style. AndrewK, you sir are an enabler! thanks again."
"A must try!"
"Fairly light, with a dry finish. It's hard to think this is 10% ABV."
"On tap. deep dark red in color. First taste was a blast of sour cherry. Carbonation was a bit odd, kind of like a mellow champagne. citrus, lemon. This beer was just amazing as it warmed there was flavors of oak, rum, brandy. This beer is a real treat for the taste buds, sensations of all types. A slightly sour finish. My wife even liked this one and she hates beer!"
"Small corked & caged bottle, poured into a glass. Pours a deep, dark reddish amber with off-white head that subsides almost immediately. Vinegar, booze, and fruit are evident in aroma. Vinegary flavor combines with a sharp lemony acidity. Dry fruity finish. Light on the palate and has an almost champagne-like carbonation. Very tart, sour, complex. Drinkable for an ale of this strength. VERY enjoyable!!!"
"Pours a cloudy ruddy brown. Very similar to muddy water. The aroma is very acidic with just a small hint of berry flavored. There was almost no head at all. The taste is tart and sweet, but not overly so in either category. The drinkability is absolutely tremendous for any alcohol level. To have a beer at 10% that goes down like fruit juice is an awesome feat of brewing."
"m/d-Very full bodied and extremely drinkable. Goes down really smooth and you could easily accidentally drink your whole glass in 3 minutes flat."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is sharp from the sourness and has a bit of the feel of pop rocks. The flavor is so good that it's hard to keep it in the glass. This is exceedingly drinkable and overall an amazing beer."
"This one of those rare sours that displays a substantial level of sourness while still retaining a great deal of complexity. It doesn't just taste like cider vinegar, their is a lot going on here."
"Overall: Wish I would have sat on this bottle for another 6 months, but if I had ordered this at a bar, I'd certainly consider ordering a second. Doesn't have the ""jfc"" factor of other versions I've had, but it's still a beautiful beer."
"Light mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is off the charts, I'll drink this 10% beer all day anyday. Bravo."
"*From notes taken on 6-22-10"
"This was my first time having this on tap. Id hate to score this low if it is a one off because it destroys from the bottle."
"D: Super easy to drink. Very surprising for a sour ale and a beer with double digit alcohol. The light tartness, the sweet fruits, and refreshing mouth, most everything about this beer works. I was worried it might be too much, but I'm glad I have this whole bottle to myself."
"D: Fairly drinkable. Still a lot to handle alone. I am new to the sour dept, but this one still leaves me wanting to try more, so that's good. I was a bit worried."
"Overall, the Americans just can't keep up with the European lambic brewers."
"D- the sourness could be a little too much for some...but not me. I love this. It packs a punch though, but you can't really taste the booze at all. First class sour from RR."
"Absolutely a world class brew and one of the finest American wilds ever made."
"though I'd like to try this one again with more patience and allow it to warm more (served at cellar temperature; did notice it improved as it warmed beyond that)."
"Delicious!"
"D-I only have one of these and I wish I had many, many more. Excellent. Alcohol is masked perfectly. The harsh taste leaves you wanting more."
"Not bad at all. I have had this many times, and it is about time to put my thoughts down. Very enjoyable, but Russian River have a lot better Wild Ales IMO. Still very much worth a try."
"Drinkability: This beer had so much hype around it that it pains me to begrudge it so much. It needs more attention to detail. Head, head retention, aroma, mouthfeel all need to be seriously reconsidered before releasing to the public. I feel like this beer was sold just to get it out of the brewery for some $$$."
"I've had this a couple times now and I really just love that acidic, balsamic vinegar character of the beer. The flavors are quite intense, and yet this beer isn't really a ""palate destroyer"" like IPAs/DIPAs. Ultimately, I could drink this ALL THE TIME if it were available in Wisconsin. As is, I'll just hafta enjoy the hell out of it when I can."
"D - A serious sipper... The sour tartness is uber potent... Lots of depth and complexity... Teetering on overbearing... I really have mixed feelings on this after each sip..."
"A very delicious beer."
"Big thanks to MCLK for this as an extra! Batch 003X3. Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pours a deep reddish brown with a two finger off white head that subsides to one quickly. Lots of carbonation rising to the top and makes a fizzing like a soda. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of yeast, bread, sour apple, and grapes. The flavor is of sour apple, grapes, very subtle alcohol, and citrus. It has a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was the first Wild Ale I had tried back at a tasting and it got me interested in the style. This is a very nice blend of flavors all in one package that makes my taste buds jump for joy after every sip. If you have not tried any Wild Ales, this might be a good place to start."
"In the mouth, puckering dry and effervescent. Strong lactic tang, lemon, brett funk, white grape, mild acetic, and strong dry wood character. Think cherry balsamic vinegar meets fermented cherry pop-tart-filling 'gone wild'! The finish and aftertaste stings with acid and a very dry lingering cherry and lemon. Light body and very sharp carbonation. Typical american wild ale."
"D - Really drinkable for the ABV and style. My girlfriend made a huge pucker face so I'm thinking these really punishing sours are a little easier for me to handle than most. I really enjoyed this and wish I could get more easily. Will definitely grab this again if I can."
"M/D: Prickly, medium bodied. I can feel the 10%, but I cant taste it, that must count for something. A top sour, just not as ""vibrant"" as some others I have had."
"Nice movie beer that I will most likely be drinking again very soon."
"D - My first wild ale, and I am certainly impressed. Alcohol presence is hidden extremely well. Very complex, well balanced."
"Notes - First time I had this beer and it was fantastic. Had it along with the Charcouterie platter full of meat, cheese and fruit and paired nicely."
"What a beer - there's nothing left to say."
"D-awesome beer, great vinous characteristics with a light barrel aging and great balance of sweetness to sour. the spice adds some kick and this is a beautiful very wine like brew."
"One of my favorites."
"Very carbonated, but man this beer is smooth. Could definitely slam the whole bottle. But might be in a little trouble. Will buy this again whenever I see it. Absolutely worth the money. Worth searching for. Very new to the style of wild ales but this was one hell of a start."
"Overall this is a wonderful wild but I am still becoming familiar with the style. I'm not sure what is up with the finish but the rest of the beer is solid."
"D- the sourness could be a little offputting to some...but not me. I love this. It packs a punch though, but you can't really taste the booze at all...dunno if I could handle more than one without my tastebuds being shot. Unreal beer"
"Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights that had a half finger head and very little lacing left on the glass. I love beers that have a nose like this one which consisted of oak funk, wine vinous characters, acidic sour notes, apples, and currants. You can definitely tell its gonna have some sour tartness. Sour vinegar currants strike first on the palate with oaky traits from the barrel, citric lemons, and cherry accents; nice sourness. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation with a sweet sour and dry finish. It drank very well and is very tasty but for some reason everytime I drink a consecration I get a hangover. I guess I have overlooked the 10ABV and I always seem to drink a 750ml bottle to the neck.."
"Oh so tasty, can really only have one at a time but man what a winner."
"The mouthfeel and carb are spot on for the style and the drinkability was exceptionally high for the ABV and style. All in all, one of the best American Wild/Sours I've had. Incredible balance of flavors. Well done."
"This is pretty delicious. Well worth trading for; better still if you can purchase it retail. Far from my very favorite sour beer but that doesn't matter because Consecration is plenty delicious."
"A big thanks to enelson for this one. Poured a plum mahogany color into a tulip, one finger khaki head that recedes quickly. Smell is currants and raisins up front with slight tobacco notes and some sour apple in there too really wonderful complex stuff. Taste is wonderful, sour, but not too sour it could be compared to sour plum juice with brett there really is too much complexity here to identify. Mouthfeel is light and slightly oily. Very little alcohol presence makes this extremely drinkable."
"This was a really great beer. As a wild ale, I expected funk, but I never expected the amount of lemony sourness. I was expecting a more beer type sourness, like more funk to it. At times it was almost like drinking lemon juice with beer, and it was great. This was a great continuation of sour beers for me. I can't wait to crack open my others."
"This beer drinks really well, wish I hadn't finished the last of the keg. To all the Boulderites before me, I salute you, to all those who didn't partake, you missed out. Can't wait to have this again, but I did see a bottle a few days ago..."
"A litle dry and not totally smooth, but very good."
"Pours a dark amber, very little head. Aroma: Oak, Cherries, sour, sweetness. Taste: very sour currants/cherries/plums. very complex and oakey. Finish is very sour and leaves my mouth watering for more. Best sour I've had and for a 10% brew i could drink this all night."
"D: I'm taking on the whole 750mL tonight, but this is certainly a good candidate for splitting amongst a few friends."
"M/D: Big carbonation and effervescence keep such a great clean taste. I love the thickness of a stout, but this is the complete opposite and so well done that I really appreciate it just as much. The 10% is essentially nonexistent. I couldn't drink this every day, but the complexity and style is something I would enjoy on a semi regular basis. 4.5/4.5"
"D- Moderately high. I think I like temptation better but this one is right up there. A supremely tasty beer. I'll be seeking this one out again. The intense fruit really makes this a stand-out beer."
"My first RR wild, so let's do this. It pours a translucent dark garnet topped by a fizzy tan foam that's just too effervescent to exist for very long, kinda like those crazy man-made elements at the end of the periodic table. The laser etch at the base of my glass must be workin', 'cause a perpetually resurgent ring o' fizz is dancing around on the surface. Good times. The nose comprises a good amount of funk, oak, sour grapes, sourdough, prunes, and a touch of a bleu cheese/ranch blend. I can only assume this is one of those wild/sour beers. Am I right? Regardless, the fizzy ring continues to mock the lack of perpetual motion machines out there. The taste is a new kind of melange for me: sour berries, sour apples, rye bread, a slight bit of vinegar, extra sweet toffee in background spurts, some of that blue cheese again, and an underlying current of oak. I'm both pleased and intrigued, leading to a clear desire for more of this. The body appears to be a whispy medium, with a surprisingly slight carbonation and a very smooth, fluid feel. Overall, a very tasty and interesting brew. Simply put: get some!"
"I probably wouldn't want to drink a lot of this, mostly because of the price, but it is delicious."
"D- A very complex beer that hides the 10% very well. Overall, great balance. Probably my favorite offering from RR thus far."
"This one even tops Stille Nacht Reserve '96 as my all-time favorite beer...there is little I can say, other than to delineate its complexity thusly...Chocolate, coconut, currant, caramel, candied orange, coriander, celeriac, radish, the requisite horse blanket, and barnyard funk, rhubarb, lemon zest, lots of tobacco, black pepper, walnut, tangerine, acanthus leaf/bay leaf, cherry skin, strawberry, kiwi, balsamic vinegar, sweet cream butter, cigarette ash, kale, ginger, cardamom, Branston pickle, pineapple, and pink grapefruit are somehow all orchestrated meticulously, and even seamlessly, into the absolutely hands-down best beer I've ever had the delight to savor...the body is creamier than I've ever experienced in a sourale, and the 10% alcohol really allowed all those aforementioned flavors to blossom to their absolute fullest If any of you real beer aficionados get the chance to try this one, don't let the $22 price tag scare you off. After all, it's a 25.4 0z. dose, and, believe me, it's cheap for what it is."
"drinkability: good"
"Pours a dark amber color with an off white head. Smell is sour, funk, brown sugar, raisins, vanilla, and oak. Taste is sour cherries, brown sugar, dark fruits, funk, and oak. Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Overall this is another great sour from Russian River."
"D - Very, very good beer. I will definitely buy this again, but the price is pretty steep. Overall a great wild ale and another great beer from Russian River."
"The beer pours a rusty brown, with red highlights when held up to the light. What little off white head does form immediately fizzles out. Given the style of beer and the ABV though, this isn't really a surprise and I'll just focus on the gorgeous color of the beer. The nose was easily appreciable even as I first poured the beer, and it's an awesome mix of horse blanket funk and sweet dark fruits, with just a hint of vinegar skulking around as well. The straight up sourness of the beer is much more prominent in the taste, and especially while the beer is still cold it overpowers the fruits and funk. The balance does improve some as the beer warms. While not overly thick, the beer absolutely coats my mouth, and there's a subtle carbonation highlights the sour flavors. While the beer is plenty tart, it shows up on the front of the palate, so by the end of each sip I'm ready to go for the next one. In addition, there's no heat at all from the beer, impressive at 10%. A great beer from Russian River (in other words, par for the course for them), and one I'll be looking to acquire more of in the future."
"I haven't had alot of sours so I'm no expert but this was a very enjoyable glass of beer. The science behind these sour ales really amazes me. Thanks RR!"
"great high carb mouthfeel, and i could drink this all the time until the 10% gets me, which is the only thing keeping it from being a higher score there. lovely beer."
"The beer pours a clear dark red color with a white head. The aroma is awesome. I get lots of brown sugar, oak, vanilla and a low amount of tartness. The flavor is brown sugar, medium tartness, dark fruits, vanilla and oak. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. This beer matured into a wonderful drink. It was tried alongside Sanctification, Temptation, Supplication and Beatification and I think this beer was easily the star of the show."
"Both refreshing and complicated at the same time, every sip is a new experience. Admittedly sour, not initially for everyone, but will grow quickly on some. Pair with goat cheese on sourdough with fresh red grapes on the side. Complex like a wine, but refreshing."
"This is a very impressive beer. Considerably sour and no sign of the alcohol, almost hard to believe it's 10%. Good craftsmanship."
"Pretty good sour, a little heavier and darker than I usually like my sours, definitely prefer a fresh Supplication to a fresh Consecration..."
"D: This beer is truly a challenge, both in terms of alcohol content as well as flavor. It is most similar to another Russian River sour, Supplication. Neither drinks as easily as some other American-brewed sour brown ales such as The Bruery's Oude Tart or Jolly Pumpkin's La Roja. Be warned before you open a large bottle of this beer for yourself--you would have to love sours unconditionally to enjoy all 750 ml."
"D - This beer is fantastic but, damn, the sour finish and resulting sensation is harsh, even for a guy who loves sours. I'm thoroughly enjoying it but it is a a bit much to drink. Sharing the bottle is perfect."
"Overall a bit more of a boozy kick is felt with this one compared to the other RR wilds. Still super drinkable and tasty."
"Batch 4. Pours a deep amber brown color with a medium off white foam head. Has an aroma of vinegar and cherry. Has a sour, tart taste with hints of cherry, some grapes as well. Very excellent sour brew. I have been very impressed with this brewery. Ready to move to Cali and hang with Vinne. Just good stuff."
"D- how this pulls in at 10 abv ill never know but damn! Super good stuff and not to buggy, but can something be to buggy?"
"D - Very solid example of the style; not the best, but damn good."
"(D)- Yet another great wild ale from Russian River! Stronger than the others, but still has that delicate yet pronounced funk and sourness. Great Stuff! The abv could really sneak up on you if you had a whole bottle of this to yourself."
"Overall: Hard to predict how wild ales will present. This was a tasty wild that is best consumed with respect."
"Cloudy, murky brown in color, with ruby highlights. Aroma is sour, musty and woody. Flavor hits with sour cherry coupled with a nice oaky barrel flavor. Tart with a slightly dry finish. Haven't had many sours, but this one was quite a treat."
"O - Great; I could definitely see myself starting out with one of these every time I stop in there."
"Cheers!"
"Definitely a complex, interesting beer. Wish it came out this way more often."
"Drinkability: slow sipping beer and the sourness is a bit strong so one will not look for more than a glass in a session."
"D: Drinks better as it warms. Not a sessionable drink but something to enjoy on a warm summer night. I really like this beer and would like to try other RR sours. So far the best American Wild I have had so far."
"This is a sour delight. Reminds me a lot of a geuze, but with hints of red wine. Rather complicated. This is probably not for everyone, but everyone should try it."
"Red and fizzy. This was sour, like a beer brewed with warhead candy. The taste crosses the line of tart to sour, its much like a white wine or champagne. It was hard to pick out much of the flavor over the sourness, but it was certainly different and enjoyable. I would love to drink this again, but not tonight. The flavor is intense, and while fun, does not promote drinking much of it."
"Nice light body. Easy to drink with a dry red wine like finish."
"Overall, for $25 for 750 ml this is not worth the money, but it is not a bad beer at all."
"Wow, if I was ever on the fence about sours, this beer has officaily converted me. Wallet: I am sorry, get ready for a beating."
"Drinkability: This beer is a rockstar in the sours category. I could have this everyday but I'd rather save it for a special occasion."
"I may need to re-visit this one in the bottle, as (with the exception of their IPAs) I usually prefer RR in that modality..."
"F: Dry finish, with some lingering mouthwatering goodness. It has a hint of sweetness but mostly dry, leaving the mouth ready for the next hit. Lots of lingering sour tangy fruit, a little sour cherry. A touch of wild Brett lingering on the finish, little funk even which seems to be a little more on the finish. Breaddy malts also come through. For being 10% there's no real booze, it drinks so well. This is a super delicious amazingly awesome sour. I wish so much we could get it around here, or even better if I could brew this myself. Sooo tasty."
"Batch 003x1."
"batch number 003x1. pours a hazy ruby brown color with good tan head and good lacing. lots of lively fizzy carb almost reminds me of a soda pop. hints of wine and oak are apparent. maybe a bit of fizzy fruityness as well. light body, thin slick texture, and very long flavor duration. finishes a wonderful sweet and tart. couldn't ask for a better brew. hard to tell between this and supplication which i like better. wouldn't change anything about either of them. i guess for now they'll have to both remain tied a top my list of favorite beers."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but seems like there are too many flavors competing without any direction."
"D: I am in love with sours. At 10% this is way up there when it comes to sours, goes down incredibly easy."
"Supremely well balanced between sweet and sour, and dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is expertly hidden and the flavors work very well together. Just enough fruit flavor and sweetness without overtaking the sour aspects. Flawless..."
"Fantastic beer very delicious one of my favorite sours. I can't wait to try some of the other sours from Russian River."
"A very nice effort from Russian River."
"Beers like this really make you wonder why you ever drank PBR, Bud, or Corona. Consecration is one beer raising and bettering beer's reputation (ruined by the macro brews)."
"On tap at the Lagunitas beer circus. Poured into a 4 ounce sample glass the shape of a small pilsner glass. Light ruby colored body with a small light beige head. Aroma is of very tart and funky dark fruits. Can't pick out any specific fruit in particular. Taste is mouth puckering funky tartness to the extreme. Very fruity. The barrel aging adds depth and complexity. Delicious all around and I'm sure very satisfying to someone in the mood for some serious funk."
"D: Awesome. I could finish the whole bottle and more."
"Really a great beer! I think I might like this more then supplication?"
"Quite drinkable for a sour of 10% ABV, I like this beer quite a bit and will seek it out in the future."
"beautiful deep reddish brown in a tiny snifter. Bubbly and more bubbly. Smells of the currants with some sour notes. On tasting, bubbles attack every exposed part of my mouth, giving birth to a flavor explosion. Is it wine? ale? sour? wood? Delcicious. Best of all, for having a such great, complex taste, it doesn't kill your palate. This my favorite of the Russian River 'tion beers. It's a good beer to give a swill drinker a taste of, exposing them to what's possible with a little creativity and experimentation."
"Drinkability> Wow. That was great and a nice switchup from my usuals at the Toronado, but I couldn't have more than one... more than two would definitely be bad on a weekday."
"D- this was very easy to finish. that was pretty unexpected for something this big. not the most sour or funky beer ive tried, but one ill try to get again so i can see how it develops."
"Overall, this fourth batch could use some age, BUT, GDit Consecration is Consecration. And it feels like Consecration: raising me up to the heavens on a 10% ABV. God's work continues to be done."
"Ah, I love my birthday. Great weather and great beer. Can't wait for next year."
"Picked up a bottle at a Portland co-op, because that's the sort of town Portland is. Anyways, I split the bottle with a couple friends and was worried the sour and funky flavors, but they actually mild compared to some of the guezes I've tried. Instead of being a big, beat you over the head sour beer, the tang compliments the fruit, estery yeast, and mellow dark malts. I should also say that for 10%, this is as drinkable as any good beer is going to be."
"D - This beer hides its ABV well, but is not something that I can drink a lot of in a sitting. Because it is so tart it much be sipped and savored so I don't think I would have more than a glass or two at a time. Its refreshing for the first glass but after that the ABV starts to hit you. Good beer overall and for the style."
"D= Another home run from Russian River in the sours I've had from then. While excellent this is not as good as Supplication. I like RR sours more than Cantillon. While they are both excellent I think the RR sours add another layer of complexity you don't find in Cantillon. California has no idea how spoiled they are. This beer is world class."
"d - Pretty good and better than temptation, but not as good as supplication. Worth checking out and I would have again. Thought it smelled a little better than the taste."
"D- I could easily have drank the whole bottle. I'm looking forward to trying the batch #2! I liked this more than the supplication, which we drank right b4 this."
"Overall, this is another winner from Russian River, but maybe not quite on par with Supplication. I remember the sample I had on tap being smoother and a bit fruitier, but that could be due to the fact that this bottle has been aging for about a year. All in all though, this is a tasty beer and one that I hope to have again in the future. Looking forward to trying more Russian River sours."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is somewhat lower. This one is extremely sour. Overall, I had this one back to back with Supplication, and let me tell you, it dosen't hold a candle. It is a little too sour for my taste, and the oak and wine barrels, while good, didn't do it for me in this brew. I liked it, just didn't love it. Skal."
"Poured a clear dark amber color with some redness and brown hues about it. Served with no head present and minimal amount of faint spotty lacing. Nose is funky with oak and woodsy characteristics. Alcohol and Brett are apparent. Dry fruit smells riddled with alcohol. Taste is puckering with sourness and alcohol right upfront playing a lead role. Quite drying and tart. Flavors of dark skinned fruit come through as it warms...and warms it does as the alcohol in this beer is there in both warmth and taste. The woodsy flavors mesh favorably with the alcohol. Lingering tartness is left in the mouth that is puckering enough to make you go back in for continuous repetitive sips. Light feel and highly carbed this was one very enjoyable experience."
"Served in a snifter."
"still scores highly."
"My favorite out of all the Russian River sours I've tried so far."
"This is a very impressive american sour. It is easy to understand the high ratings. Awesome."
"D - Better with every sip. For a sour it goes down well and does not fade, opening up as it gets warmer."
"This had a lot of hype around it and lived up to my expectations. Delicious and interesting."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and even my wife appreciated it, but it was a little too sour for my liking. I definitely recommend it and would have it again, though. It's just one that I'd only have a single glass of at the end of the night."
"Overall this was a pretty solid beer. I found it to be similar to others in the Russian River line (Supplication & Damnation) in that it reminded me of a beer/champagne and wine all wrapped up into one. Very complex. I hope to visit this again when my palate has become more developed."
"Overall this is a good beer that s very drinkable even though it is at 10% ABV. If you have friends that are wine drinkers you need to have them try this, they will love it."
"Had this at Monk's cafe in Philly. Poured into a chalice, beautiful dark amber brown with great cream colored head, great retention and lacing. Medium carbonation. Smell was earthy and sweet, then bitter. Taste started out momentarilly fruity and sweet then going to incredibly dry and bitter from the currants and barrel aging. Very complex, hard to drink in quantity but paired well with a steak and was able to finish it quite easily and was left wanting more by the end. Very good."
"On tap at the brewpub on 6/30/09. Poured a beautiful dark burgundy with a cream head. Mild aroma with hints of berries. There is a mild sweet flavor, but ultimately the brett and sour currants take over. This has great flavor, with touches of sweetness, then a very well balanced bitter finish. The hype is worth it."
"Loved this can't wait to have more !!!"
"This is a solid beer! High carbonation, medium mouthfeel, funky and sweet flavor, LONG lasting sweet aftertaste...with a competing sourness! Drinkability is excelent. I finished the entire bottle in about an hour, and of course, as it warms to room temp, it's still AS enjoyable as the first pour/sip. GREAT beer!"
"This is one of my all time favorite beers."
"Mahogany pour with a ruby highlight and a short lived, fizzy, off white head. Deep oaky aroma with a strong tartness, sweet rich molasses, and strong aromatic black currants. Rich buttery charred oak flavor with some sweet molasses and caramel in the middle and finishes with black pepper, vinous black currant and a strong lactic sour bite. Dry medium body with loads of carbonation."
"Awesome, but definitely an acquired taste. My wife liked it, but one of the other wives hated it. Hop heads might not like it."
"For the style, I found this to be amazingly drinkable. The tartness never overwhelmed, and the dark vinous qualities were able to shine through, bringing a welcome balance."
"Try to drink a aged bottle of this to yourself sometime, it's a treat and goes through many changes over three hours. The wine is huge, the funk is light, the fruit is fading but still large. This got me a pretty tipsy. I'm feeling this 10 percent, this is drinkable, but it will do damage, I can't wait for the smaller bottles. I plan to drink the rest of my batch 1 bottles in another 15 to see where this goes."
"The third RR beer I tried at TJs in PA yesterday. Could this day get any better? Another awesome wild ale. Served in the same glass as Supplication, oversized flute like shape. Comes out with a dark red-brown color which light can get through, not much. The head and cloud are missing but I have never really seen a wild ale with one. The ring around the edge leaves sticky suds behind but no real lacing. The smell is a very nice blend of oak wood and sour lambic. Some dark toasty/caramel malt shines through leaving me with a very interesting beer ahead of me. The taste comes down to sour fruit, oak and brown ale malt hints to me, in a very nice way. The sour and barrel wood notes compliment each other very well and the brown ale malts help back up the sour nicely. Not very complex to me but very cool and creative. Mouthfeel is nice. Moderate body with moderate carbonation and good cream. Not as solid as Supplication but still very nice. A coat of sour oak and malt is left on the tongue. This one gets very sour to me after a while, one glass is the perfect quantity for this great beer. The price was awesome and so wasn't the flavor. RR is great to me so far."
"I poured it into my Russian River goblet and was greeted by the tangy smell of Brett and the other wild yeast that Russian river uses to make their sours pack the punch they do. The color is deep, deep red, almost purple. Aromas of sour fruit, currents mainly, waft from the glass. The taste is just as lively and tangy as the smell, perhaps even more so. There's also a good deal of wine flavors here, in addition to the yeast and fruit elements. Surprisingly drinkable for a ten percent beer. This was the beer that made me fall in love with sours, and every time I drink it the moth puckering sensation reminds me of why I will never look at beer the same way again. This is an absolute must for sour fans, and highly, highly recommended for adventurous souls looking to break away from the usual."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is extremely excellent given the 10% ABV. Extremely well crafted and delicious, and the alcohol is not at all apparent."
"M/D - Dry and sticky. Fills out the mouth then washes it clean. Overall, an absolutely fantastic beer! Different aspects of this beer seem to contradict one another, but somehow combines to make one intricate beer."
"Paired with cheese, the acidity is more obvious, and scrubs the palate clean."
"D-Not as easy drinking as Temptation due to the dryness, but still a great beer."
"D: Not quite as good as Supplication, but still a great concoction. A great brew to sip on and appreciate."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a snifter as final beer at the Lion's Pride's Belgian Beer Dinner (past of their first Belgian beer Fest). It is a clear beer with a dark plum color. There isn't much head, just a thin off-white ring of foam where the beer touches the glass. The nose is just amazing, with notes of port, sherry and a bit of wild, sour yeast. I can taste sour grapes, both white and red; each has a distinct flavor profile. There is a warm alcohol ester aftertaste. It tastes incredible. There is a medium body with a ton of carbonation. The alcohol vapors feel great. The carbonation and sour flavors leave a little tingle on my tongue after I swallow. As a single glass pour, the beer is very drinkable. If I ever found myself in possession of a full bottle, I'd want to split it with a friend."
"D - Drinkability is very good. Very, very nice balance of flavors in this brew. 750ml? No problem. One would never guess this one at 10% until it was probably too late. Didn't really know what to expect opening this one up and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. The initial tartness is a blast at first but quickly drops to a moderate level that just...works. Very happy I got the chance to try this one out."
"Taste of currants mixed with grape juice, a non educated beer drinker could think it passes as a wine. Extremely tart and sour flavors from wine barrel aging with 4 different strains of wild yeast, this beer is very complex and tasty. Where some wild beers taste slightly offensive, this one tastes delicious and has balanced flavors where one particular side doesn't overshadow the other flavors, oak perhaps being the strongest. Wine barrel aging, lacto, and fruit additions all complement the flavors in this delicious treat."
"Overall Impression: This was the first Wild Ale I've had since Victory's Wid Devil - a beer I disliked so much I almost dumped it. Almost. Having said that, I was unsure how this would beer would go over with me. Upon the first sip, my skepticism was gone! This is without a doubt the most complex beer/ale I've ever tasted!!! First the aging in Cabernet Sauvignon Barrels was obvious. The brett was a perfect compliment to the complexity of this amazing ale. It's kinda like a cross between a wine and a beer, and not a cheap version of either. If this is not Nectar of the Godz, I don't know what is."
"At this level, drinkability is pretty good, though it certainly will take some time to down the 750."
"I approached Consecration with quite a bit of skepticism. I recall hearing how much it blurred the line between wine and beer. Personally, I don't think that's the case. It's very much a beer, and that's not a close question. It has some vinous qualities, but they complement its Wild Ale qualities rather than compete with them. Russian River really has a special creation with Consecration. I don't know how the other batches stack up, but this one's a dandy. Do yourself a favor and seek it out."
"D: I could drink this one everyday if I had access to it. It's probably in my top five brews of all time. If beers were to be classified like wines, this would truly be be at the top tier. Russian River is the Domaine Leroy or DRC of beer."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a 1/2"" off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild sourness in the nose along with a nice barrel aged aroma. The crystal malts seem to mellow the overall sourness. The taste is more laid back as well. It's easy drinking. I cannot believe this is a 10% abv. beer. I could drink this all night. It has a more moderate sourness than Beatification. It's also a darker beer with some crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is very drinkable. It's tasty and not overly ""wild""."
"D- The flavor is sublime, but Consecration lays a bit heavier on the stomach than Russian River's other sours due to the 10% ABV, the highly acidic sourness, and the richer dark fruit element. Still, I was easily able to navigate my way through two large pours of this complex beer."
"Minimal head, quick dissipation, no lacing to speak of. Dark amber body. Faint dried fruit in the nose, little hop presence. Taste is of tart dried cherries, no noticeable hops, a bit of funk (Brett?) pucker powered brew. Dry attentuated finish. At this ABV not sessionable, one is enough, but quite drinkable. Not quite in the league of Cascade Brewing/Raccoon Lodge, but this was a very tasty sour, certainly worth seeking out for fans of the style."
"Although I enjoyed this beer, it was not quite as full-flavored or as complex as I was hoping it to be. Regardless, this is another noteworthy release from Vinny and company at Russian River."
"D: I'm typically not too big a fan of Russian Rivers sour ales but this one was my favorite."
"This is a great beer for catching wine enthusiast's or non-beer believers off guard in what they think a beer can be. Glass is filled carefully and slowly to the lip, leaving no room for a head and initially served a little too cold. Color is a murky, reddish brown, fairly clear and viscous looking. Strong vinous aroma, balanced and alternating oaky, mild vanilla sweetness with acidic funky dark fruit sourness. Flavor is deep, dark and complex. At colder temps the sour and funky dominates ripe apple, cider-like, tart cherries, berries, Brett-funk, etc. Warming up this becomes much more complex as the sweeter wood flavors reveal themselves and turn this into even more of a sipper. Sharp mouthfeel, fuller bodied and moderate carbonation and lingering finish, relatively dry. I still prefer Supplication to this, but that's not really a bad thing. Not easiest to approach of the RR wilds if you're not a fan of the style, but if you are this is exceptional."
"I have yet to fully enjoy a sour experience, so maybe its just not my thing."
"An excellent, extremely thirst-quenching, interesting, pleasant, beer. I could go on. An excellent choice to be my #500 review."
"This is an absolutely exceptional beer. There's no getting around it. This beer proves why American Wild Ale is a unique style, and why it is such a well-regarded one at that. It also cements in my mind Russian River as an exceptional brewery. The complexity is incredible - I can't believe how much there is going on. Let's just put it bluntly, this is a really, really, really good beer."
"Drinkability: This beer was my first funky American Wild Ale that was conditioned in cabernet oak casks. The sourness was honestly overpowering at first, both through the smell and taste (more so with the taste). However, as the beer opened up the aromas firstly became very exciting and did the beer's conditioning absolute justice. The taste took longer to come around, but as I began to realize the complexity I wanted nothing but more."
"Overall, a very good sour beer. A sipper, and one to enjoy over the course of an hour or more. Savor this one, enjoy it. I look forward to trying more of this in the future. Thanks Sean!"
"Poured a burgundy color with red hues and a nice white head. Nose is tart berries, oak and just a plain overall sour aroma. Taste followed the nose ery much the same with tart berries being the first thing you taste and then oak, booze and earthiness. This is my favorite RR sour. Very tasty, big, and awesome. Alcohol is noticable but the flavor just tends to bury it. Very damn good."
"D: Highly enjoyable. For me, this is strictly better than Temptation though both are solid beers. Deeper and more complex and I enjoy the dark fruit overtones in this one. Worthy of the praise. Seek it out!!"
"Notes: Like a great Cabernet but sweeter, fruitier, and more delicious."
"Wonderful dark brown color with red hues. Nice tan head fades quickly. This beer has fairly restrained carbonation. Sourness is evident in the aroma from the first whiff. Apple cider vinegar mixed with brown sugar and fermented berries. Wow, this tastes amazing. Tons of sour, tart cherries, berries, citric acid and vinegar. This is backed up by a dark sugar, caramely malt base with what seems like a hint of vanilla and a bit of spice. Also has a bit of a red wine like quality. Quite tasty and begging for another sip. Fairly full bodied with a somewhat sticky finish. The sour helps balance off the sweetness in the finish. Also worth mentioning that for being it goes down quite smooth. Cannot detect the 10% ABV at all. For the style I would say this is quite drinkable. I think I will have another!"
"Drinkability - Delicous beer. Highly regarded and worth it. Could easily finish a 750mL bottle if I wasn't driving anywhere."
"Amazing barrel-aged sour beer from Russian River. Thanks Cole for having this brought in from the West Coast for some Midwest beeries. Lots of sour and delicious puckery taste to this beer. The currants add a rasiny almost fruity aftertaste to the palate. The Cab. barrel must have had a hand in adding some sort of tannic quality to the beer but it is not overpowering. The sour really shines through. Excellent time in the barrel and very delicious. A true sipping beer and a worthy treat!"
"Consumed on 1/27/2010"
"Finishes dry, with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. The alcohol is well hidden for 10%. Light, fizzy carbonation, and medium bodied. Very smooth for a sour or wild ale. Very drinkable."
"This is my second-favorite Russian River sour behind Supplication. Highly, highly recommended."
"Pourned a murky reddish brown with a soda fizz head that dissipated as quickly as it formed. Smell was really great. Deep musty wood, a hint of barnyard and sour fruit. Taste rivaled the tartness of La Folie, bracingly sour. I couldn't believe it. A healthy dose of barnyard funk intermingled with red wine tannins and oak wood. Almost spicy. Outstanding. Mouthfeel was light, not too fizzy but kept a nice sour tartness on the tongue. Not thin by any means. Drinkablility was pretty good although it was a little rough getting the last bit down. I could feel the glands in my jaw start to swell a little bit, and my mouth was getting pretty dry from all the tartness, but didn't change the amazingness of this beer. 10%? No way."
"Out of a bottle, provided by a BA member, this beer was a murky, copper color. The head was similar to the color of toasted wood, the retention was ok as a thin collar and the lacing in spots. The aroma was big and sweet with dark fruits, grapes and raisins, currants, sweet dough, alcohol and candied fruit. Like an alcohol infused fruitcake! The flavors were very similar to the aroma but aggressively tart. Highly acidic which was further pronounced by the alcohol punch and I tasted the additions of kirsch as well as some funky, musty wood. The currants truly came through on the finish giving the brew a unique character. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation light/medium. For 10% it was very drinkable and an excellent example of the variety and complexity available within the American Wild Ale style."
"Overall this is a top notch sour, one of my favorites by a lot. All three were great and I would have them again."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and crisp. The carbonation was wonderful, adding another amazing aspect to this beer. It's amazing that it has taken me this long to venture into sour beers or anything from RR for this long. Definately an amazing treat."
"Drinkability: A stunningly bold achievement; may be the best thing Russian River produces"
"The drink is light-medium in body with vivacious carbonation. The fluffy, refreshing, tangy nature of the brew belies the otherwise invisible 10% ABV and lends itself to being quaffed more quickly than is likely advisable. Good stuff, Murch, and thanks again!"
"D- Wow. This is another excellent sour from the folks at Russian River. Delicious, rich, and complex. This beer has aged very well so far and is certainly a slow sipper. This should definitely be shared- 750ml is too rich for one person in one sitting. This is a beer that I would love to have again."
"D= This was balanced, complex, and extremely refreshing. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. A world class beer for sure!"
"Clear chestnut brown with a fizzy/soapy, short-lived beige cap. It looked a lot like a glass of Coke, with not much head or lace to speak of. It was a light gusher too, so watch out. Aromas of tobacco leaf, cherries, berries, currants, earthy with a light funk, red wine, strawberry seeds, hint of cocoa. More earthiness as it warms. The flavour was a combination of fruity and earthy, chocolate covered raisins, berries/currants, a bit tart but very pleasant and non-aggressive in this character. Faint vinegar, light woody oak, green berries. Mild alcohol and warmth in the finish with a lingering berry sweetness. Medium bodied and off-dry, moderate carbonation after the initial loss of aggressive carbonation (it took about 20 minutes to clear from the bottle), a bit of woody astringency. I really liked this one. Nicely balanced with complex fruit flavours."
"It's a world class brew from a world class brewer"
"Drinkability: There was a time not too long ago when I'd have rated the taste and aroma of this one well below the mouthfeel and appearance. Sours have grown on me since then, and this is one of the best I've had. The sweet and sour combo almost reminds me of an Oud Bruin in places, but there's enough sourness here that it falls firmly in the right place (and it's also probably not purely funk enough). It's hard for me to give anything that's 10% abv a drinkability that's too high, ergo the score on this one, but it's still pretty amazing. This one seems like one you couldn't age too terribly long without it getting violently carbonated, but I would have liked the pure Brett on this one to be a little more pungent (something that would only come with additional age) - I'd love to try Batch 001 right around now, or to get a current bottle and let it sit for 2, 3 years. A phenomenal brew, brimming with complexity, aromas, and flavors, this one would have paired well with some Roquefort or Stilton ... had I had any. Curses!"
"Pours a dark ruby with a foamy head that doesn't linger long and settles to a ring for the rest of the drink. Smell is of light sour note of currant. Taste is clean, sour, currant again with nice full oak flavor that balances well to the finish leaving a great aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good as well with pleasant carbonation, a great sour. Drinkablility is lower simply because of the 10% ABV but could easily have a couple of snifters of this."
"3.5/4.5/4.5/5/4.5"
"D- For a 10% sour, its pretty damn drinkable. I think the the thin mouthfeel contributes to this."
"D - alcohol is masked very well, but I'm feeling it after only half of the beer."
"Pours a red wine like brownish purple hue with a small head. Funky, mildly vinous nose with some wood character and currant fruit. Wine-like, tannic and sour with no alcohol note apparent. Dry and very ripe with a fresh fruit note, the skin of the currant and the Cabernet barrels harmonize wonderfully. A truly nice beer, i was lucky enough to enjoy a little less than half of this bottle and enjoyed every sip thoroughly. This bottle is worth the 25$ charged, share it, for a full 25oz may be a bit much to the tongue."
"Batch 04x04"
"Fantastic offering form Russian River--the best of the night in the Belgian/sour tasting that was had. ISO."
"Honestly, one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had!"
"D: the first time I had this, I enjoyed the 750mL myself. I'd easily do it again, but I love to share this love. If it's on tap, this is usually all I have."
"Somewhat muddy chestnut color. Opened with a loud pop and quite the foamy pour but quickly settled down to a thin layer of tight bubble. Fruity aroma, big red wine presence to it. Extremely complex flavor. Deep dried fruits, sour grapes and a slight caramel like taste. Oakey, woody, Heavy blast of brett lasts a while. Complexity just gets deeper and deeper. Great body,very lights and crisp. The heavy carbonation level makes it very bright on the tongue. Just a killer beer in general. Sure wish this one lived closer."
"D: If I can drink an entire 750 by myself, you can too."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor profile on this beer is fantastic which just brings you back for more. The abv is easily managed and well incorporated. All in all this is a really solid beer."
"750ml caged and corked bottle recieved in a trade with NCBeerFan. Batch number 002x2. Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light with a nice head that quicly fades to a small ring around the glass. It leaves no lacing. Smells mostly of barnyard, and hay. Sweet sour fruit dances in the background. Also nice oak flavors in there as well. Sour fruits dominate the palate. Nice oak flavors in there as well along with the hints with of cabernet. The mouth puckering sourness leaves me wanting another sip after sip. Loads of carbonation but that's expected with the style. Not a hint of the 10% alcohol. This is my first true sour and I can't wait to try more."
"O: This beer is not for the weak of heart or mind. Among the sours Consecration Batch 3 is demonstrating the finer points of this brewing art. The sourness hits you on the tongue and in the jaw muscles like a sour apple with each refreshing sip."
"D: Drinks amazing for 10% and keeps getting better with age."
"If this were lower in alcohol, it might be a little more versatile but otherwise this is excellent and worth the $20 price tag."
"This is one of those beers that drinks more like a wine than a beer. Aged in wine barrels and carrying the flavors over into the finished product with a unique character added to the tartness of this beer. All the RR products are made to the highest of standards by one of craft beers true master brewers! I recommend trying all their brews if you can get your hands on them.."
"I am overwhelmed with appreciation for this tasty beverage. Pours dark amber/ruby (my lighting is not very good) with almost nonexistent white head. Feels very smooth in my mouth, and mouth-puckeringly sour. With grape, floral, and oak tones, it almost tastes like a fine red wine--maybe a Syrah?--and I mean that in a good way."
"Pours a brillant amber hue that is flat in color and appearence. No head at all with zero lace. Good for the style. The aromas are bold and big on wine. Tons of sour red fruit with hints of sweet tarts, funk, and cherry juice. Inviting. The sweet tarts come thru as does a bit of crushed aspirin. Beneath that is a wonderful mix of red fruit that is heavy on the cherries. Winey sourness pushes thru along with bits of wood, and vineous qualities. Medium in body, a bit sharp on the tongue with a dry finish."
"What have I learned here tonight? Like all the other Russian River sours, this one just gets better with age. I have never been a big of a fan of Consecration as most beer geeks have seemed to be, but after tasting this batch 1 some time later I think I may be converted. Really tasty, recommended for cellaring."
"Drinkability - This one is a sipper for sure. The extreme tart/sour/funk flavors make this a beer that is best enjoyed over a longer period of time. Don't get me wrong, this is quaffable no doubt, but there is no reason to do so. Additionally, the alcohol is well hidden and I get just a slight warming after each sip. A very enjoyable sour/wild ale."
"This was one of the more enjoyable sour beers I've had in a while. The oak aging really makes this beer what it is. Worth a try if you can find it at a good price."
"Overall this is so different, but so good. If you love wilds/sours, this beer is for you. Complexity really makes this beer a one of a kind. Very nice, glad I got to try such a rare beer on tap."
"Drinkability: Russian River always does a great job on sour beers (as well as DIPAs) and Consecration is up there with the best of them. It started off with a bang with the bottle explosion, slowed down in the appearance, and then kicked into high gear with its top notch sour and tart aroma and taste. Of course, like every other Russian River Beer, it's expensive as hell! It's worth a shot once if you can pry open your wallet far enough."
" Ye Gads! BRAVO!"
"Drinkability: this beer perplexes me a bit. Each time I take a sip, the sourness blows me back; soon, however, I am appreciating the undertones, and finally I find myself yearning for another sip. This is a truly interesting beer."
"Well done and keep up the great work Vinnie!"
"Drinkability - Lovely beer - one of the most drinkable soured beers I have ever tried. Will gladly recommend to experienced beer lovers and inquiring minds concerning innovative soured beers. Go Russian River go!"
"O: Strong oak (might like less better), very complex, very wine like, more tart than i remember (last time was on tap) and more funk"
"Overall- very good, more oak and less sour than on tap at RRBC and Toronado. one of my favorites RR beers."
"Barrel aged 6 months in oak with currants. Brett, sacc, pedio, and lacto cultures. Batch 002x2. Maroon label with a black and white line drawing of a spear, I assume the lance of Longinus. My fiance carried this back from Cali for me. Poured at 49° into a snifter. 1/8th inch head settles out instantly to a bubbly ring. The body of the beer is sorta a tawny port color, a reddish-orange in the deepest spots. Sweet oaky nose, some fruit, smells like a fruit forward red wine, not a lot of sour in the nose, maybe just a hint. The body is good, spritzy carbonation, lightly coating, lightly puckering. Flavor comes on strong with cherries, currants, very tart, a nice long rolling tartness, just a faint bit acetic, which I like in small quantities. Lots of oak, woody and dry, not vanilla, perhaps they used non-American barrels. As it's warmed slightly I'm picking up the brett in the nose, a kinda spicy chemical-leather. It's coming forward in the taste too, again, leathery and earthy melding into the sour fruits. The alcohol is really well hidden on this beast. It's an intense beverage to be sure, but well balanced, the tartness is just right, no real sign of the booze, goes down easily all things considered. I wish I had more of this stuff..."
"This is a very nice beer and fairly complex."
"I approached this beer with eager anticipation and confidence that it wouldn't disappoint. As expected it did not. Consecration pours a deep ruby red with almost blood orange hues and a healthy pink lacing. A depthful aroma forwarns of tartness but better yet contains a rich dark fruitiness and even...what is it,, Tamarind? Hints of vinegar and dried fruit follow. On the tongue the beer is obviously tart, subtly sour, and surprisingly chewy and full. Ever present is oak rounding out dried fruits lactic notes. At times lighter notes of raspberry almost shine through. A beery like vinegar flavor stings at the palate long after the sip is consumed. If one focuses in on the oak it opens up just slightly enough to reveal vanilla and coconut. Vinous. Though a lesser masterpiece than Temptation, Sanctification, Supplication, or Beatification in my opinion, this is a tour de force nonetheless."
"Caged and corked Belgian style bottle, pours a regal tone of soft brown, under a lighter mocha head. The nose on this one is infused with wood and hints of maple. On the tongue instantly noticable are notes of soft vermouth, ripe fruit, light pepper, complexity extending light funk and echos of yeast coursing through, simply delicious in every way. Smooth, soft, flavorful and yummy in a dark and wet Belgium filtered through sunny California sort of way. Please consider distributing this to my local bars and stores sometime soon..."
"D: I was one and done with this beer, not because it is bad, because it wasn't. The higher ABV made this beer a one and done for me."
"Overall, I feel this brew lacks a complexity that I like in a wild. I enjoy this brew immensely, but this 750 is going to be a chore to polish off."
"overall i fear that my review will not do it justice as i really am at a loss for words...so much complexity i dont know how to describe it...thanks james for the truly warming house warming..."
"D - Delicious, complex wild ale, far exceeded my expectations. Yet, between the ABV and dry finish, finishing this big bottle was a bit laborious."
"Taste is almost perfectly balanced. Initial sourness melds into some wonderful fruit nuances. Just the right amount of sourness for my tastes. Tartness livens up the mouthfeel, while the beer remains very refreshing and non-cloying. Extremely drinkable at 10%. Well done sirs. Well done."
"Overall, a very nice beer - one of the most compley I've tasted. Very full bodied, with sour flavors playing 2nd fiddle to the fruit and oak. I'd love to see some age on this beer, where hopefully some of the fruit will calm down a hair, allowing the brett/sour to show through."
"Drinkability: I was really afraid that I wouldn't like this beer, but that wasn't the case at all. This was fantastic! I couldn't get enough! I'll definitely be buying Consecration again. Also, I liked it much better than Temptation (see review here: http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/9474/?ba=ThreeWiseMen)."
"D - Too tart and too much phenol like taste to drink a lot of. In all fairness this might be a better beer than I'm going to end up rating, but it was following two sweeter beers that were both amazing (NG Raspberry Tart and RR Temptation)."
"D: A remarkably good drinker."
"Overall, pretty damn good sour, but not world class as its rating and ranking suggest. Worth trying but don't overpay or trade for it."
"Got a bottle of Batch 1 (involuntary response) from Hi Times in Costa Mesa, CA. Smelled like currant jam and a little bit of balsamic vinegar had been smeared right on my upper lip, and I eagerly awaited licking it off. Poured like juice, slightly viscous, thin syrup, like from canned fruit. Little to no head. Tastes like (involuntary response) currants picked at the peak of perfection, crushed by the feet of nubile virgins. And I was licking their feet, gratefully, smacking my lips, licking my lips, leaving it in my mouth just to tease to see how long I could go without swallowing it. When it was finished, I was a little tipsy and begging for more."
"It was a great beer and I will drink again."
"Starting to overcarbonate, champagne style large bubbles muddle up the complexity of this one. Touches of unwanted acidity are also coming forward, and the fruit has definitely died off a bit as well as the sharp tannic bite from the wine barrels."
"* Not saying it isn't deep. Just not as much as I was expecting."
"Drinks easy as a wild ale & the ABV, a touch too dry for me to be completely happy with it, another great sour from these guys!"
"What a great beer. Side by side vs. T20 I prefer this one. Much more depth of flavor and juicier. Not quite as funky and dry as the T20 though. I can only see this getting better with age also. Yikes."
"Such a joy. Preserved lemons, red wine, leather, fruity red wine and just plain fuxking delicious. Moderately tannic. A fucking masterpiece on the nose. The palate is similarly deep, complex and very well balanced. The lemony sourness is a characteristic that is diminishing in the newer Russian River sours, a change I'm not a huge fan of, but this vintage is a clean, crisp sour one with a nice blend of lactic and citric. Wonderful wine and fruity notes, very Much so. Awesome awesome stuff. 4.75/4.5/4.5"
"This was my first RR Sour beer, and it has inspired me to seek out their others."
"D - Overall the beer looked great, smelled great and went down easy. The 10% alcohol was enjoyable as well. This would be a interesting beer to share with others."
"the mouthfeel is thin and light, as the bubbles explode fiercely all over the palate. its sticky and stays with you for a while. drinkability is no doubt limited to this 750ml bottle. i would prefer less, actually, but since its here ill drink it."
"D- Wow, this is one tremendously complex brew. This could easily bridge the gap between beer and red wine. A breed all of its own."
"Had this again batch 4 fresh on 4/20/2010 and it's very, very well done, a currant bomb."
"overall, I'd say this is an extremely light, very drinkable beer... almost indescribably so considering it's heavy hitting ABV... you wouldn't know it was 10%."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, the sourness is not so insane that it ruins your palate. I can drink this all night long. What a treat. I still have not met a Russian River beer that hasn't amazed me. Highly recommended."
"D - Really drinkable for the style and ABV. You would never guess it's a 10-percenter."
"Overall, not impressed with this beer for the price we paid. Vinny could stand to take some lessons from Peter or make a return trip to Belgium and learn from the masters"
"Pours a deep dark amber with a small head with almost no lacing. Very carbonated which makes it look really nice. Very funky and sour, there's some cider and vinegar to it. Very sharp on the tongue, it gets a bit better as it warms up. Really cool and worth trying."
"The carbonation is lively on the tongue and the finish is dry with dark fruit character. Great head retention and nice lacing. THE BURGUNDY OF BEER."
"Notes - such a crazy brew, some beers can e likened to muscat grapes, this one is more like French red wine"
"Drinkability is moderate, slightly drying. The bitterness limits drinkability somewhat."
"A healthy 10 oz served in a wine glass (closer to 12 or 14 oz). Brownish red in color, with very little head. It is oily, with the existant lace sticking and sliding down the glass. Clear, mostly opaque and with medium carbonation. Berries and bananas in the aroma, it reminds me of a Belgian. None of the banana characteristics are present in the taste, however. Sour, but not over the top, with very noticeable ketone/aldehyde characteristics. Hints of bourbon in the flavor and a bite to the tounge. Light mouthfeel. Surprisingly bitter finish. As a lambic, a nice balance between the sourness and malt. Worthy of a second tasting."
"Personally: Up front, I am not a fan of the oak barrel infused types of beer that tastes like wine or whiskeys. Consecration is in this category. Although, I can see drinking this over Temptation Blonde, that's not saying much. Not worth the price, I rather just buy a Flemish Sour."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation."
"About a year later on tap at the brewpub. Just as good."
"I'd drink more if they weren't 20 each ;). This is a beer I cannot think of a food to pair with. It stands alone to be tasted, enjoyed on its own merits."
"Very full bodied, yet not over the top thickness works well with the high level of bubbles in this guy. Another awesome RR."
"Overall a fine beer, and a really interesting (at least IMO) melding of styles. I like the flemish lick that the addition of currants and barrel aging provide, and the fact that it doesn't get too flemish on us and forgoes having too much vinegar barf flavor. An impressive and incredibly complex and educational beverage. One i will be sure to cellar, and enjoy again in the future. Excited to see how this batch 2 is...Great beer."
"Sourness puckers the tongue initially, but otherwise, it is smooth and silky, leaving a syrupy funky taste on the palate. Probably the best batch of Consecration that I have had."
"Not quite the Duchesse, but a damn good Sour."
"Bottle shared by miketd. Thanks Mike! Pours dark brown with off white head. Has acid and tart cherry aromas. Flavor is tart cherry, dark fruit, wood, and some wine notes. Finishes with a super pucker mouth watering sourness that is great. Medium light mouthfeel. Overall a great brew and one I really liked."
"On tap at Belmont Station and Bailey's Taproom in Portland. Pours a hazy ruby/plum with a small head. Aroma is red wine, cherries, and oak. The taste is more of the same but with a strong sourness that reminds me at times of some of my favorite sour candies. But it isn't that simple since the barrel creates a nice complexity and keeps me going back for more. I'm not a sour beer expert but I really liked this."
"drinkability is excellent. prefectly proportioned on the palate with a wonderful fruit bouquet and mildly vinous finish that works magic on the palate. this beer is phenomenal. it dances on the palate with a sour character that enhances the drinkability. cheers!"
"Light body, and carbonation. Good amount of acidity. Some alcohol warmth, but not as much as you would expect for a beer of this size. Very complex, and delicious."
"Dark amber colour with large bubbles at first that could have easily fooled me for being a Belgian import. Nose has a pleasant sour cherry component, with light vinegar, and fig newton snacks. Just as I'm starting to enjoy it the brett funk kicks in and the fair reviewer side of me reminds me that barnyard is supposed to be good here. The sourness dominates on the palate, with cherry taking some background to the fig newtons and vinegar. Finish is long and vinegary, and really smacks you in the face with the flavors. Even if you like the style it is still hardly something that anyone should describe as having high drinkability."
"D- Wow, if i was never allowed to drink red wine again and wanted to still experience many of the positives, i would reach for this. The ultimate American Wild Ale experience."
"I will revisit this again next year and see if my opinion has changed."
"I been hearing how good this beer is and I'm glad I tried it. Also glad the price I paid for wasn't wasted (It's a wee bit up there). Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice sour taste. The carbonation is caused by the refermenting in the bottle and it definitely shows in the glass and the way it pops in your mouth. I could drink another one easily but I'm gonna have to break my piggy bank for that. Wow, look at the fizz of that second pour and the smell. This is good!"
"I would like to thank alot of the people on BA who pretty much told me it was a good deal to get this. Otherwise I might have forgotten about it. Thankyou."
"I have to be in the mood for this sort of beer (which has a lot in common with an Oud Bruin), and it's generally not the sort of thing I'd reach for if given many other choices, but the quality and character is clearly on a high level. Very glad to have tried it."
"-really gotta be in the mood to drink a sour. if i was in the mood for a beer i would never go for a sour. it is good for the style, but that i think will always be the case"
"Just a fabulous outrageously tart acidic wild ale. Black fruit dominates obviously driven by the black currant with full bodied berry, tart cherry, black raspberry and plum. Thickly tart with brett and a bit tannic from the oak. Mouthfeel is a blast of spritzy carbonation and acidity. Brett shows well throughout and keeps things fresh. Wish I could afford more of these."
"D- Drinkability is inhibited by the intensity of the acidity, which is really accentuated by the tartness of the currants. Of course its delicious, although not my favorite RR beer, but difficult to drink a whole bottle in one sitting."
"M:"
"Amazingly fast fading deep tan bubbles reach three fingers and then fade to nothing in just seconds. Body is a deep brown mahogany tone in color, really romantic. Nose is lovely with up front raspberries, so lush and slightly tart. Rich dark fruit tones come through with some oak and even a hint of sweet bourbon. With first sip you get some vanilla and oak then quickly comes the tannin based dark fruit sour feel that really embraces the tongue completely. Raisins, figs, blackberries and citrus rind all mark a wonderful tart fruit profile. The bold almost rich tannin feel really rounds out the taste perfectly. Superb balance and complexity make this beer a real standout. Mouthfeel is very red wine like, really making you want the next sip. Off the chart drinkability for a beer in this category."
"Very enjoyable beer that gets better as it warms. Another RR winner."
"Drinkability: For a 10%, it's excellent. Could drink it all night. Definitely warms you up quickly however, and would be tough to drink the whole thing on my lonesome ABV wise eventually. Thoroughly enjoyable, and Wild Ales are quickly becoming my new favorite style. While expensive, it's certainly worthy and fantastic, and more than just an enjoyable brew but an excellent one."
"D - Quite nice...and very drinkable. Going well with pizza. Definitely could have more of this...very good."
"M + D: Starts quite carbonated - though this calms the more I swirl it, naturally. The flavours hold on for quite a while, and the warming on the way down makes for a pleasant sipper. A great beer, with plenty of complexity to keep the nose and palate busy."
"When you let this beer warm a bit, and allow the carbonation to settle down, it turns out to be pretty good in terms of drinkability. I wasn't as amazed as I expected to be considering the hype, but I did like it. I'm not sure it is worth the price tag, but I would be interested in trying different batches to see any differences..."
"Overall this was a very good AWA and my first foray into RR sours. A good way to start."
"This is a hell of an interesting thing. The lady friend was startled. She had no idea beer could taste like this. I am really enjoying it. Just a funky, weird, crazy thing going on."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer. I am trying not to drink this treat fast, but it that isn't happening very well. Very drinkable and I want more. One of my favorite beers I have had yet!"
"A little fizzy, but i like how the tartness puckers and dries you up. Goes down way too easy for 10%. Maybe the batch I got was over-oaked. Would definitely love to split a 750mL of this sometime..."
"Split a bottle with abfraser last night at Cheeky Monk in Denver. (by the way, great price for a bar - $26). This is my third time drinking Consecration now and I love it. Dark brown with a red tinge, I assume from the currants it's brewed with. Plenty 'o head. Crisp, tart smell. A very dry beer (though not as dry as I remember batch 1 being, but maybe I just forgot), tart, but not crazy sour like an Isabelle Proximus or Beatification. Nor is there a great deal of funk. Plenty of fruit flavors as well. So this is a very refreshing beer and was perfect for a hot summer night sitting out on the sidewalk. I'm grateful that RR is now distributed in Colorado."
"Drinkability was great."
"D: Virtually invisible alcohol content. Characteristically awesome. Thanks Joe!"
"Very good beer. Can't say that I'm as enamored of it as the general BA population, but I understand the appeal. A wonderful once-in-a-while treat."
"The yeast used, Bretanomyces, also adds some earthy flavors to the mix. This is then counterbalanced by the bright sourness produced by the bacterias: Lactobacilius and Pediococcus. FWIW, that kind of sourness I can only relate to candy like sour patch kids, but the sourness has a lot of flavors competing for attention. This brew has some real complexity and depth of flavor. Highly recommended."
"Loved it..."
"Pours a rich plum color with some glowing red hues and a light, fluffy tan colored head that quickly burns out into a nice thin wispy ring around the glass. The aroma is filled with tart berries, touches of oak and just a plain overall sour aroma. The flavor is very much the same with tart berries being the first thing you taste and eventually allows for some oak and touches of earthy hops to shine through and finishes very dry. Its a very effervescent beer and is light bodied. This is quite a tasty beer. It has very nice sourness which doesn't blast you away but definitely makes you pucker. The alcohol is very well hidden and will sneak up on you if you aren't careful as this is an easy drinker. Lovely, delicious stuff."
"D- I am always down for a wild ale but the guys I spilt it with were not fans of wild ales and wanted me to crack open another one....if only I had another I would have. Good job Russian River and great job Mike for getting this wonderful beer to me!"
"J"
"- Quite drinkable.. but fizzes up a lot on the tongue.. I guess the way it's produced.. like a sparkling wine.. will do that, and is normal... but this is a sipper! Very drinkable, and as I am not a huge fan of the style, I am further understanding it... and I must say, with this one I am truly floored at how well put together and complex it is. A great sour wild ale from Russian River."
"D: Incredible. You would never know the ABV strength of this beer as the alcohol is completely covered by the wonderful taste."
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is sour with a vinous and vinegar thing going on (in a good way). Also has notes of cherries/currants, grapes, and wood. The flavor is like a great mix of sour cherries and a touch of apple cider vinegar. Very complex and thoroughly enjoyable. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is quite good."
"this style is way out there for me...like i stated earlier this is my first time trying an American Wild Ale...took me a while to drink it, but made my way through it with no problems...taking a few sips of ice water between sips of beer made it a bit more bearable...i'm always willing to try anything from Russian River so I couldn't pass this one up....would I go back to it again if I found it, probably not but that doesn't mean it's a bad beer in my eyes...when i become more familiar with this style i may have it again and re-review it"
"overall a very good sour ale."
"Batch 001X2 bottle, corked and caged, purchased from Monk's Cafe 4 months ago. The beer is hazy, dark reddish brown with a 1-finger off-white foam that quickly dissipated to a thin ring around the glass. Much darker than I initially expected. The aroma is sour and acidic with a strong raisin character. There's much more dark fruit than I normally get in a wild ale, I think I smell plums and a touch of alcohol also. I like everything about the aroma except the alcohol, maybe it can't be helped due to the high ABV. The taste is not as sour as feared or hoped, but crisply tart. Lots of raisins, plums, some sweet and tart cherries, very very good. More in-your-face than Belgian wild ales, this has more evident alcohol and bolder flavors overall. Medium body but the rich flavors and threat of 10% tempers the drinkability a bit."
"So far this is one of my favorite wild ales, it is very sour but yet still has nice sweetness and great complexity. I can't wait to try more wilds from Russian River!"
"D: Slow drinking due to the mouth-puckering tartness. Still managed to finish the whole bottle over the course of an evening though. Very tasty!"
"thanks again to max and vinnie for making this happen!"
"Overall, I don't see many sours coming close to this. Vinnie hits it on the head once again. May be arguably the best to come out of Santa Rosa ever."
"Color is dark amber with small lacing. Head was think on pour. Nose has barnyard, coffee, fruit, and a hint of perfume. Taste was strong sour with hay and fruit flavor finishing with a hint of tannin and bread. Not the most drinkable beer but a 10 ounce pour will do the trick. Excellent!"
"overall one of the best beers i have ever had russian river really knows what they are doing when it comes to sours i cant wait to try the rest of them"
"D - ABV well hidden. Tartness does not tire easily. Think I am getting used to fine sours."
"That being said, this is an incredibly unique beer that explores the boundaries of what beer can be. I loved it and was very sad when I reached the bottom of my 6 oz pour. Will definitely drink again!"
"I liked this beer very much, but to me Compunction, Supplication, and Toronado are far superior. You can't go wrong, but for the heafty price tag I'd rather drink a Rodenbach Red. Cheers!"
"Deep dark ruby red/brown with a nice light brown/red foam forming to top off this brew. Aromas of berries- the currants are there for sure. Cherries, a peppery spiciness with a prickly carbonation. Complex funk mixes with vinous red wine grape characteristics. Another winner from Russian River- it'll be great for years to come. Very slight alcohol burn from the high ABV but it is not distracting from the brilliant marriage of tart, funk and fruit that take place in this beer. Chris- how the FUCK do you not like this?"
"Pours a clear translucent brown color with a full finger fizzy light tan head that is gone in a blink. No Belgian lacing afterward. The smell is great; sweet apple over a wine vinegar. Full flavored, the taste and nose are mirror images. Granny Smith Apple Ale flavor and tartness with a light body over an effervescent mouth feel that dries up quickly while leaving the fruity earthy notes and hint of a dark fruit linger nicely. A way too easy drinker...the 10% ABV provides a notch of warmth with the first mouthful, but is quite well integrated. I will savor this one as long as I can. Highly recommended."
"D: Not a problem to drink at all. Sometimes I have a problem with some sours and wilds, but this one is easy to take care of. Actually refreshing as hell and has a nice and light drinkable quality. never have a problem taking another pull. A well crafted beer from start to finish. Sure I could use a bit more head and lace but screw it, the flavor, aroma and feel more than make up for that lack. Drink it if you got it. Great beer."
"By far the best sour that I've had the pleasure of drinking. Even better or equal to the Belgian sours. If you enjoy sours, then you absolutely must seek this one out."
"Drinkability: 4.5 still damn drinkable."
"What can I say? It's incredible. I'm going to strictly edit myself in this review, so I don't get too gushy. Giving two 4.5's feels wrong, and the five in flavor seems a bit low. At any rate, the beer pours a translucent auburn with nice lacing. There are notes of red wine, currants (of course), cherries, malt and a wonderful sour like an incredible vinegar. The flavor is similar. The sour bites nicely. There's actual malt presence behind all of the fruit and sourness. The fruit flavors are refined and elegant. The whole thing is a wonderful experience. I can't imagine how they could improve on this flavor profile. The sourness blends with the fruit and malt at just the right level. There's also a dry oak flavor that keeps any possible sweetness in check. It drinks like a beer with half as much alcohol content. Bravo to everyone at Russian River."
"Poured this one into a Tulip Glass that looked like Dark Raspbeery rust with an off white head lacing and some sticky foam. Big fruit nose you wouldn't believe from the currant. notes of tart cherries, esters and red wine. I'm a Gueuze fan so the Sourness hit the spot. Flavors of Sour Cherries, oak, funk and some dry hops is in the background. Feels like a lightly carbonated red wine which made every sip one to remember. Hats off to Russian River!"
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Nice but brief head with a dark, mahogany body. Smell is (unsurprisingly) currants and dark fruit. The taste is really where this beer shines. Wonderful currant with an extremely tart, dry bite and a pleasant champagne carbonation. One of my favorite beers after the first sip. I'm glad I don't live in the bay area because I'd go broke drinking this."
"Bottle Pours a clear brown with a good off white fizzy head. The head leaves quickly. Reminds me of soda pop. Aroma is of dark fruit. Apples, cherries, and a touch of the oak. Has a good carbonation. The flavor is real good. A lot of sweetness but kicked up by a sour ending. Has a dry texture. This is a differnt style than I would normally drink but it is excellent. Has a great finish and the aftertaste stays with you for days. This is quite a tasty beer. Cost a little more than I spend but was worth it."
"This is far and beyond my favorite beer to date. Too bad it's so hard to find. Would love to get my hands on a case of this and age it. This one is made to be shared. Just awesome. This is the reason I drink beer."
"definately need an open mind for this beer(most non BAs need not apply), but you will definately reep the benefits of a unique and delicious beer. not much to improve on only wish i had more..."
"This beer may be the finest example of working with wild yeast and bacteria. Outstanding."
"D - holy crap... this was my 2nd beer of the day this morning (the first was Pliny the Younger) and I can still drink more!"
"Batch variation seems to be pretty obvious. I didn't get that vague plastic smell from the batch 001x4 bottles I've sampled. I'll comment further when I open up my own bottle at some point. I'm also looking forward to batch 002."
"Hell yes!"
"D- Wow... This brew is amazing. So earthy and drinkable with a fantastic fruity quality that isn't sweet or bitter. Unlike anything I've tasted to this point. I was expecting a straight up sour with a slight fruity dimension but not so. Awesome stuff, thanks Matt!"
"Overall my favorite wild ale to date. Truly world class. Vinnie & co have hit another one out the park. Don't miss this one."
"The tartness keeps begging for more."
"drinkability is pretty good. the alcohol is very well hidden. vinegar and acidity is pretty well balanced. nice fruity depth. not my favourite RR sour, but damn tasty."
"Poured into a chalice a nice ruby color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy off-white head, very minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty/yeasty, oak, cherries, currants. The taste is malty/yeasty, soury, slight oak, funky, cherries/currants. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, for some reason, I'm not really into the AWA as much as I use to be."
"D: Wierd, but the sourness makes you want to go back for more. Certianally interesting, and, even refreshing. Need have a cold water after this, but, nice, in a wierd way."
"I am glad I waited for a nice day to enjoy this gem of a beer. RR hits another amazing beer."
"Pours a clear dark reddish orange, some amber highlights, thin off white head forms, quickly drops to a thin ring around the glass before almost disappearing, some lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is real nice, currants and funk, sour fruity, cranberries, alcohol, candi sugar, grapes and oak, vanilla, very sour and acidic in the finish, nice complex tropical fruitiness, does remind me a bit of the Toronado 20th. Taste is similar, lemony up front, very sour and funky, acidic, caramel/honey sweetness, currants and grapes, sour fruit, oak and vanilla, very dry in the finish, tons of fruit, sourness is not overdone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth going down. Very nice sour, don't think I enjoyed this one as much as most of the other RR sours, but still pretty damn good. Thanks Carlos and Greg!"
"If you can get your hands on this, buy it. One of the better sours out there. Well balanced and gives a nice sour flavor without being overly acidic. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability= High. Extremely good. Alcohol is hidden nicely. Taste is awesome. Nose is awesome. What more could you want?"
"The only Russian River brew I've tried so far, but I'll definitely be picking up more next time I'm in the Northwest."
"d: i tried to age this a bit, but only got about 4 months in...still a very nice balance of characteristics -- the beer portions won out enough to maintain this as a beer. over-priced, but very enjoyable"
"Hard to chug this brew but with a $25 price tag, you wanna sip on this brew for all its worth. Looking forward to having some more of this."
"Draught at the brewpub. Brown color with a red tint and white head. Darkly vinous, tart, and oaky aroma. The flavor is quite sour with lots of oak and sour fruit. Malty underneath, with a less alcohol that I was expecting. Richly smooth and medium-full body. High-gravity sours are new to me, and I sort of miss the light, refreshing quality that you get in a lighter option, but this is really great stuff regardless."
"D - Great overall. Not sure if I could finish a whole tulip pour."
"Overall, a really good AWA from RR but is missing a couple elements from being a classic. Still very enjoyable but not the ""I'd kill my mother to get it"" like Supplication or Temptation for me. Do highly recommend. I've got one left for cellaring so curious to see how this one ages."
"A great beer to mark #100 on BA. Consecration and Supplication are without a doubt my two favorite sours from Russian River. The bottled version was as good, if not better, than the version I have enjoyed many times up at the pub in Santa Rosa."
"D- Share this one with someone. An ale which needs to be experienced by many. This ale is definitely not for all but is an excellent example of true artistry at work. Beers (and breweries) like this give me hope for the industry and make me proud to say I am a beer drinker (and maker). Thumbs up for originality and passion. My hat is off to you Vinnie."
"D=good, the bomber was ok, but more would be tough given the sweetness (personal preference) and the alcohol."
"In some ways wine-like, but with a funky, malty character. Well-balanced - sweet and sour but not too much in one direction. An interesting, delicious, unique, sipper."
"d: Huge thanks to rallison for the chance to try this one. I think RR achieved exactly what they set out to do with this one."
"The acid ensures a crisp dry finish, really nice on the tongue, warm and very pleasant."
"Overall this is an amazing sour and an extremely flavorful example of Russian River's ability. Thank you Brian for trading this gem to me."
"D: Definitely the most drinkable sour that I have had. Very complex, and also soothing on the palate."
"Could easily down this one quickly, but it would be such a shame to get to the end any faster than necessary. This is the type of beer that makes you want to go back and rethink some previous ratings -- completely redefined what the style can be."
"D- So far this my favorite sour by far wish and one that I can actually drink and not gag."
"Wild Ales are not usually my bag, but how can you turn down a healthy and free 6oz pour? I'm glad I did... this stuff is incredible. Perhaps it was the muted funkiness that I loved so much, but Russian River continues to do no wrong."
"This is the first beer of this style I've tried. I would not want to drink this all the time, but as something occasional to mix things up it works well. This beer isn't cheap, but it's probably worth having one or two in the cellar."
"Drinkability - I'm not a huge sour fan, but I had to try this one. Definitely a pleasant beer, though the tart can be a bit overwhelming at times. If it wasn't $20 a bottle I would probably revisit this."
"M/D - Full bodied with an incredibly lively carbonation. The beer tickles your mouth and throat the whole way down. Ridiculously easy drinking as well."
"I was really looking forward to trying this beer, so I popped the cock and prepared to drink this bottle (batch 001x4) a couple of hours before a big STL Blues playoff game. Pours light brown with a tan/creamy head into my Duvel tulip. Not much lacing along the glass and the head quickly goes away leaving a small tan rim along the sides of the tulip. The smell is amazing, green apples, very sour, but in a great way. Taste is great, lip-puckering sour, but it's just as if I'm drinking a nice cabernet or pinot noir...wow. Lots of fruit up front and a great mix of sweetness and tart on the finish (makes me want MORE!). Mouthfeel is perfect...just the correct amount of carbonation with this wild..really helps the flavors. I would say this is right down the middle in terms of body, medium. Drinks like a wine with some carbonation, very nice. I still have a few bottles left and they won't be around too long as much as I enjoyed this one! An awesome wild."
"Very, very smooth feel. Light astringency, definitely not unpleasant, leaves a very nice tingle on the tongue. Nice, even coating made me feel like I needed to brush my teeth afterward. I was really sad to see the bottom of the glass. For my first Wild Ale, I thought it was highly drinkable. I really hope I'll be able to attain this sometime over the summer."
"It doesn't take long to realize that this is indeed a 10% sledgehammer. But there is nothing that can diminish how good this thing is. My cellar awaits for another bottle. What will this taste like in a few years? I am drinking this very slowly but I am enjoying every sip. Not that I'm a sour maven by any means but this is the best one I've experienced to date. In-fucking-credible."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, funky, chewy, with barnyard funk sticking to the palate."
"HV"
"Overall, a pretty one-dimensional sour, but boy does it do the sour well. This is right up there with La Folie for my favorite sour."
"Batch 001x4. Another amazingly artistic beer from Russian River. Trying for the second time. A deep garnet color, calm looking brew. This beer is both complex yet accessible and quite easy to drink all at the same time. Tartness and raisiny currents in the nose, a big of soaked woodsy oak. At first taste this beer has a tart but not necessarily very sour kick to it, then mellowing into deep fruit and a soft funk. Very balanced and subtle, yet plenty of flavor and very arousing to the tastebuds. Slight grape husk vinous character imparted from the barrel aging. Really excellent. Prickly and juicy on the palate but with a tart dry finish and highly quaffable. A real gem."
"I understand that Brett was used along with two other usual suspects, but I could not discern any obvious rotting humus or bovid urine, rather just the usual organic yeast remnants."
"D- I split a 750mL bottle with two friends and I wanted more after 1/3 of the bottle. Overall, extremely well-rounded. One of the few American Wilds that I've had that's not sour for the sake of being sour, but sour to impart flavor to the rest of the beer...Another excellent brew by RR."
"D- This one was very drinkable. It definitely wasn't a standout for me as far as russian rivers lineup goes, i'd much rather grab a temptation. At 22 dollars a bottle id venture to guess this will be the last bottle i'll buy for a while."
"This is a top ten beer for me, no doubt. Delicious and creative, worthy of the awe it inspires."
"My first crack at a wild or sour beer, but it was a great new experience..The pour yields a cloudy, glowing, rusty sienna colored body with a lasting, pillowy, cream colored head. Minimal, spotty lacing shows on the glass. Aromas include a dark, fruity malt base rich with currants and some sour cherry. Dry cocoa adds a hint of sweetness, while soft, oaky vanilla lends a perfumy, lightly woody overtone. Traces of bretty funk add an earthy character. Flavors show more dark fruits, primarily tart dark cherry, fig, and currant, mild sourness being tempered by the soft, oaky carress. The body is substantial and semi-dry, perfectly carbonated. I think I may have another style of beer to add to my list"
"Very dry mouth, astringent. Light to medium bodied. Light carbonation. As dry as some champagne I've had, which for me, is not a positive quality I'm looking for in a beer."
"Make for the hills. Ride. Do not look back at the looming thunderstorms, they are not there. Ride. Your freedom is at stake, your entire world. You must not let them catch you. Ride for your life."
"I can't believe this is 10% ABV. It is completely concealed. I would love to continue on to another bottle when I finish this one, but this is far too precious a beer to treat in such a frivolous manner."
"D: The 10% alcohol never rears its head. The ale is very approachable with a pleasant tartness that never makes me pucker too much."
"I could drink this again and again and again. However, this ranks behind Supplication and Beatification for me."
"O - Best wild ale yet."
"I think at some point I will be able to appreciate this style, but it's too radical to me right now to feel comfortable with it. I can totally see how people enjoy this beer a lot though, but I think it's an acquired taste that I just haven't acquired yet."
"Poured from a 750ml caged and corked bottle (Batch 001x4) and served in a snifter. Generously provided by doubleo. Thanks Kyle! This beer poured a mahognay brown with some ruby highlights and a fizzy, highly carbonated two-finger thick head of tan foam that quickly settled into a lasting cap. Some slippery lacing. The aroma included strong oak, vinous dark fruits, and lightly sweetened tart currants. Some lightly sour notes. Definately a strong wine character. Nice mix of sweet and sour. The flavor displayed a fairly intense oaky, wine barrel character. Tart currants followed by a mellow acidity. A lingering woody, cherry pit note was left on the tongue. The 10% ABV was undetected. Finished mostly dry, but there was still some unexpected sweetness lingering. Medium-bodied with crisp, aggressive carbonation. Very well done. Quite a bit more tart, and not nearly as sour as expected, but it works. A wonderful beer!"
"M/D - overall, I think this is an amazing brew. I'm just getting into liking sours and this one is a hit for me."
"Another Wild work of art here. The melding of the oak, cherries, and wild yeasts in this was just fantastic and the drinkibility was quite good for a beer of this size. Awesome."
"Thanks for Reading"
"D - This is a really good wild yeast ale. The aging served it well."
"9/4/8/3/15 (3.9/5)"
"Drinkability - More of a treat than a session beer, but don't pass this one up if you can get it on tap, or aged for 1+ years."
"Overall, definitely an amazing brew that everyone should try. Not something I can see myself drinking regularly, but more like a celebration brew to break out on special occasions. I'm definitely interested in cellaring this and trying it a couple years down the line."
"I had this on tap today at Capones. It pours a deep ruby red with a thin head. The aroma is full of cherrys, and red wine. The flavor is a bit sour, but full of cherry, currants and a dry red wine. The brew is full bodied and very dry, possibly from the tannins in the wine barrels. The beer is a definit sipper, but I am very suprised about the 10% abv. This is the best sour i have had and I consider myself fortunate for being able to try it."
"D-Superb, quite drinkable, well done sour with the tart and dry characteristics balancing each other very well. A totally enjoyable and refreshing brew."
"D - Quite drinkable for one of the most coveted American-made sour ales in beer-lure. While this is a Brett-head's dream, I actually found it to be not as harsh as I was anticipating. Really glad to have had the opportunity to get this on tap outside of Cali."
"Over all I thought this was quite tasty, but not as impressive than other wild ales, especially those offered by RR. The big downfall for me was the carbonation. Maybe I should just swirl my glass for a few minutes?"
"On tap at the brewpub, shocked that I got a 16 oz pour when I was expecting a 10, but it was a bargain at 6.75. Dark cherry red pour with a hazy tan head that lingers. Very sour aroma of cherries and plums with a light vinous smell to it as well. The flavor is like a sour fruit explosion in your face: cherries, grapes, blackberries, and a nice wine thickness. Very nice carbonation in the mouth and a nice malt profile as well. Hopefully my future experiences with sours will match up to this one."
"Drinkability: It's hard not to gulp this one down like a madman. All in all, this is one excellent beer layered with rich complexities and one that I cheerfully recommend."
"Overall impression: Another great wild offering from Russian River. It is amazing that we can get these in Colorado now - the CO beer scene just keeps getting better!"
"Tap @ O'Briens TION night. Was easily the best beer of the night. Poured deep mahogany with a thick, creamy off-white pillow for a head. Light lacing. Delicious tart cherries-and-red wine aroma blended with more currants, tobacco, and a nice funky wood. Smooth, slightly carbonated mouthfeel. The taste really follows through on the aroma. Vinuous, red-wine overtone with tart cherries and the funky yeast flow throughout the beer. Slight white wine vinegar with Granny Smith apples. A pleasant rich, oaky flavor in the finish gives the brett and cherry/currant flavors a subtle sweetness. Awesome beer."
"D: Not my favorite RR wild ale, but still outstanding and worth the $25 price tag."
"EDIT: While the nose/taste seem to be the same, a recent bottle of this proved to be much lighter in color. While previous versions looked almost like a red wine, this one was a much paler beer with maroon highlighting things. Not really a problem, but just worth noting."
"Batch 001X1 750 ml bottle. Beer poured into a duvel tulip glass and forms a lovely 3 finger head. Frenzied carbonation feeds the head. Then a truly unique phenomenon begins to unveil itself . . . the beer begins to make crackling sounds just like a bowl of rice krispies! The head holds along with the crackling sounds for a couple of minutes but then quickly vanishes once I start drinking. The appearance and sounds of this beer was quite an amazing experience . . . never felt like a beer was as alive as this one. Beer is a gorgeous dark burgundy color as well. The color especially the crackle make this a 5 for me. Smell of dark fruit, cherries, apples, brett, and a little vinegar. Initial taste is sour and tart but then it is balanced out quickly by some malts. Beer is tremendously complex. The finish is long lasting and leaves you longing for more with the cabernet sauvignon grapes lingering . ..very nice. Moutfeel is tantalizing as the beer dances across your tongue and feels as alive as it did when it was first poured. I really enjoyed this beer but could probably handle no more than 2. A lot of hype with this beer and I'll say, for the most part, it lived up to it IMO. I'm aging a couple of other bottles and I imagine they will improve quite a bit. Will revisit in a couple years."
"Drinkablilty is great here. I love this. Perfect."
"D: My 150th review on St. Patrick's Day with corned beef brisket and grilled vegetables. Sacrament or Sacrifice? Communion or Condemnation? This beer is truly unique . Drinks both steadily and dangerously. Settled into some Spirit Caravan and Metallica."
"Had a bottle of this the other night for a tasting. Pours a dark cola Burgundy into a Snifter, carbonation is clearly scene but not overwhelmingly. Minimal head retention with a small but nice amount of lace. The aromas coming form the beer are very complex, black currants, cherry's and Tobacco every so slightly. Was a mind opening taste for everyone at the tasting and actually for a couple people their first addiction. Taste is a sour that leaves your mouth a bit dry. Flavors of cherry's were dominate for me not others, with black currants and a hint of oak in the back ground. I am not a big fan of sours but this beer did well for being a sour and converted people in the tasting to sour lovers. Mouth feel is like drinking a very dry and tart wine and I wouldn't be surprised if some was used int he brewing. This type of beer is definitely a slow and sip drink, at least for me. It is a very interesting beer and would recomend anyone to give it a try at least once!"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a crisp smoothness that runs throughout each sip. Good, steady carbonation throughout. A contemplative sipper of a beer...let it meander it's way across your palate with each sip to get as many as the nuances as possible. Complex, tasty and a masterpiece of the brewing and barrel aging art. Chalk this up to one of my favorite Russian River creations yet!"
"Draught, Catalyst Coffee. Light brown color. Full, layered foam. Nose is perhaps the weakest point of the beer, but still hints of funk, wood, dark fruit. Flavor is amazing. Complex, integrated, beautifully balanced. Notes of cranberry, currant, blackberry and wood. A beauty and one to put away."
"d - pretty high, I could drink several but acid reflux would probably kick in. It's a bit pricy to be very drinkable though ;)"
"Glad I had a chance to try this one, but once was enough for me."
"This remind me a lot of supplication with the most noticeable difference for me being the different wine barrels the two beers are aged in. I like what the cab does to amp this beer up. You know, I wish an east coast brewer made some sours of this caliber... that way I wouldn't have to either pay an arm and a leg or wait months to find them."
"Overall- good sour dry feel with a nice black currant flavor. 1 or 2 would be good at dessert."
"a def sipper, along with Ommegang Rouge the best interpretation of a Belgian ""Sour"" that I have had... just remarkable"
"I have tried a number of these beers in the last year or two but this one is in a league of it's own. If you like sour, go for it but if you are not devoted to this style try something less intense. I couldn't finish it."
"This stuff is very intense it has a very tightly concentrated sour flavor that will take you by surprise if your not ready for it. Very sour up front, and then the flavor spreads out a bit. The 10 ABV is completely hidden by red fruit and spice. After sipping it for a while, your mouth adjusts to the intensity and if you like sour style beers this will do the trick. I wonder how it will age, I feel that with some time the beer will mellow out some and perhaps be more approachable. All things considered, this one is very unique and worth the 20 bones."
"Notes: Damn! This is one hell of a ride! Very fruity, very sour, very funky, very intoxicating, and very good. Another perfect example of why people go ape-shit over Vinnie's concoctions. If you love sours, you owe it to yourself to get a hold of this one! Highly recommended"
"If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this you will not be dissapointed"
"Awesome, amazing beer that everyone should try at least once for the experience. This beer deserves the praises and ratings it has received. Very well done from one of my favorite Nor Cal breweries."
"More recent bottles indicate some signs of wine oxidation/stewed fruit. Nevertheless, if you consider yourself a sour fiend and enjoy fruited ales, do yourself a favor and seek this one out. Killer beer!"
"Keep in mind I wrote this at the brewery towards the end of a very long Russian River day. Thought I should re-write it a month later and laugh about it again."
"M/D- Really solid - the carbonation matches very well. Light, crisp feel that seems like a combination between a fine Cab Sav and a fantastic beer. I could drink this all day.... try it with some Jalapeno jack cheese."
"D- Very easy to drink, almost too drinkable. But after 3 6oz glasses it does start to get a bit heavy in your stomach, but it is still tasty to say the least and super drinkable for 10%."
"D. This is a highly drinkable beer, can hardly even taste the alcohol. This was an amazing beer for me, definitely gonna be looking for many more sours now. Well worth the 23 dollar price tag."
"Finally..a big Thank You goes out to The Wine Underground in Englewood CO for making this available online!"
"Flavor is tart, sour, fruity, acidic, oaky and altogether complex. Besides being a big sour ale, the flavors are a bit difficult to describe and really require an individual palate test. Mouthfeel is medium and supported by some fine carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding beer that masks it 10% ABV. It would go well with some tender hoofed wild game."
"d-good, but I'm shocked to see I prefer the RR in the shootout. The oakiness is a bit much, it hasn't gotten overly funky like I'd hope with the age, and the depth doesn't match the RR. I like a sweeter beer, or more sour, but the aged DD reminds me of the disappointing 05 Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien I had on xmas eve, which was also over oaked and not that sour."
"Insanely drinkable, still waiting to try a bad beer from Russian River."
"The cork was the loudest cork ive ever heard and damn near flew out of my hand when i opened it. The instant sour fruit smell was heavenley, It pours a dark amber color, The taste is absurdly complex so much so im sure you could find almost any flavor you looked for. This and the brabant have mad me officaly change my favorite style from ris to american wild, an absolute must have for an ba"
"Poured into a tulip glass. Root beer color with a deep amber tinge. Dark but mostly clear. Nice beige head fizzles out due to the acidity. Aroma is sour raisins and currants with a striking cabernet character that blends into the overall profile better than any other wine barrel-aged beer I've had. A brown sugar note emerges once my nose acclimates to the acidity of the aroma. Maybe even a little bourbon and light alcohol too. Very complex smell. Flavors of jammy wine, berries, raisins, oak, vinegar, brown sugar, and a bunch more I can't even articulate. Definitely improves as it warms up. Ridiculous complexity all around. Mouthfeel is rich and well carbonated with delicate bubbles. A joy to drink. RR just can't miss."
"D: Very light and dry, minimal to no aftertaste. Huge drinkability."
"D: Consecration is an amazing beer. Highly drinkable. I can not wait to have another bottle of this stuff, and see how it evolves with some cellaring."
"Drinkability: I can't really tell there's any alcohol in this. It's 10% but you wouldn't know it. It's definitely a pleasure to drink and one of the few Wild Ales I've had the opportunity to try - the other being Ommegeddon (which I rated B+)"
"Pours a deep dark almost blood red with a quick (and quite loud) bubbly two finger light khaki colored head that falls to a thin pillowy layer of foam that lasts throughout. Virtually nothing in terms of lacing, a bit of a disappointment there. Aroma is heavenly; tart fruits, wet tobacco leaves, and rhubarb. Underneath the funk is a touch of chocolate and oak with some dark grapes and fig as well. Taste begins with some leafy greens, dates, and brett. Midway a bit of alcohol comes to the surface with a woody oak flavor and some vinegar. Aftertaste is where the sweetness lingers; bitter cocoa nibs, dark berries, and leather. Just a complex orgasm for the tongue, mmmhmmm. Pretty light and fluffy for a beer at 10% abv, I'm blown away. Lively, puckering carbonation, just a perfect feel in the mouth. Just a wonderful beer. Still no Deviation, but another sour from Russian River that definitely needs to be experienced by all."
"Don't miss this one. As I've said before, Consecration is to wild ales what the Younger is to Imperial IPAs. If sours weren't so darn polarizing, this would undoubtedly be on the top 10."
"Great beer, very enjoyable. Little outright funk, but still complex and interesting. I'm looking forward to trying this with some age on it."
"Had this on tap last night at The Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. Delightfully acetous on the nose! On the palate...piquant, snappy, tannic, broodingly acerbic and redolent of macerated currants. Exquisitely tangy on the back of the palate with a sappy dryness and an extraordinarily long finish. A pleasure to drink!"
"Drinkability is exceptional. If I didn't notice the bottle, I would have never guessed this beer pushes 10% ABV. It drinks more like a 6% or 7% beer. This is more of a refined sour, not like the big blast of sour you get from something like the Supplication and Beautification. It's like this one is better ""put together"". Wow... yet another super offering from Vinnie and crew. It's currently my #2 sour from them, Sanctification still wins by a nose though."
"Overall: beats Temptation as my favorite sour to date"
"in the mouth. Tastes like champagne to me with apple and citrus notes. I enjoy drinking this as it is mellow and bubbly. Overall a decent beer that is worth the price to drink every once in a while."
"More tasty than it was fresh, might be worth saving."
"This is by far one of my favorite sours as for as drinkability and flavor goes."
"Edit: I went back on 3/5/09 and finished off that keg... (only a glass and 1/2 left in the keg)."
"My only real knowledge of sours was with La Folie and I had mixed feelings. It seemed too sour and difficult to enjoy in larger servings (i.e. a full glass). Consecration has a more rounded balanced feel to it and I could enjoy the entire glass without feeling like it was a burden. It's expensive but certainly worth it for a special treat."
"The body is closer to moderate than dry. Extremely clean for being so much on the ABV side. Carbonation is low but ok as it really lets all the different flavors come out. Just really impressed with the balance between fruit, funk and sourness. Overall a fantastic beer being so fresh"
"Body is refreshing yet full and a crisp carbonation enhances the vast variety of flavors. Nice dry finish. I could enjoy this ale any time."
"D: I'm not sure what to say about this beer right now. I think it could use some time in the cellar. I find myself longing for some of the funky brett aromas and flavors which never really materialize for me. Is this a world class brew? Certainly. But I would take a Cuvee de Castleton over it at this stage of ripeness. It absolutely pushes the envelope in blurring the lines between wine and beer."
"Overall, this beer was glorious. The mouthfeel was highly carbonated and perfect. The 10ABV was absolutely nowhere to be found. And I am glad I do not live on the West Coast for once, otherwise I would spend my whole life savings on this beer."
"Overall I was totally floored by this one. One of the best beers, easily a top three to five I have ever had. It was perfectly blended and just really ungodly drinkable. I cannot say anything else, instead I will sit back and simply enjoy this one again."
"This beer is fucking awesome. I would drink this beer every day."
"Overall: A great beer! The sour and fruity notes are very nicely balanced, and the smell was impressive as well. I can't wait to cellar one of these and try it again. A must try. Cheers!"
"A bit thin in the middle, would benefit with some more malt dept."
"D - amazing drinkablity with just the touch of sour and no way to tell its high in alcohol"
"Drinks well for 10%, can't taste the alcohol, too much else going on. Doesn't really warm on the way down either. It's very sour though so it demands drinking it pretty slow. Really enjoyable though to sip on all night. The warmer it gets and the more acclimated your tongue gets, the more enjoyable it becomes."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability speak for themselves. I would happily drink these till I couldn't see anymore and damn near did! This was there best beer in my opinion! Other than the price there is nothinhg wrong with this beer in my opinion! One of the best beers (better than Abyss and KBS) I've ever had!"
"*NB: Had the newest batch on 4/7/2011, either they grow much more sour with age or the newer bottles are much less sour and flavorful/bold."
"D) I could drink a lot of this but due to how pricey it is I think I'll invest in bottling other sours. Glad I got a few bottles but glad I did not purchase an entire case. It will be very interesting to see how this one ages. A bit over hyped but quite delicious and an enjoyable experience."
"Big thanks to Henry for bringing this to our tasting. Pours a toffee brown with little head that quickly becomes a pleasant lacing. Smell is sophisticated currants and sour notes with brett. Taste is sticky fruit, woody oak, white grapes, and plumb. There are also deep sour currants. Finish is long and dry with a lingering sour and maybe even a little salt. Well blended brew. Very good."
"D: Not gonna say this is the greatest thing I've ever had, but it's tasty. Damn tasty. Surprisingly easy to drink, with a nice level of tart/sweet 'refreshment'. Complex enough to sit and savor, enjoyable enough to have another, even two (if it weren't 10%). Glad to have tried this on draught, will age a bottle or two to see what develops."
"Bottle shared by Bobby91w at the Sexual Chocolate 09 release party. Pours dark red-brown with not much head to speak of. Really nice nose of oak, and dark berries. Huge tannins sour bomb. Nice fruit flavor. Med syrup body. Dry finish. Pretty good stuff."
"Overall impression: Definitely doesn't live up to the hype for me. Hopefully the Supplication and Temptation I recently traded for are better. This much brett has no place in beer! (at least not the beer going into this mouth)"
"Drinkability is high and usually I can't drink that many sours in a row but I could drink the entire 750 by myself but I'm being nice and sharing it with a buddy. Glad I bought a couple."
"Pours a clear reddish amber color with little head. Aromas of sour fruit, woody tannins and wine characters blend well with dark sour fruit flavors, oak and red wine. A drying, tart finish full of wonderfully balanced flavors rounds it out very well. High drinkability for a beer that is 10% alcohol. You would never know it. I could drink an awful lot of this beer, and thankfully have had it 3 times now. Fantastic."
"Huge thanks to swnicholson for the chance to try this gem. Poured into a tulip. Pours a murky brown with a very active, but thin head. Smell is of ripe fruits- I get prunes, rasberry, and the like. Some sugary alcohol and vinegar as well. Taste is not as sour as I had imagined. Really smooth flavor, actually. Again, some dark fruits, and smooth rich wine flavor. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Some active carbonation in the mouth, but overall very smooth and rich. Not my fave RR, but very good."
"This is going to be a tough beer to find, but trust me, the search will be worth it. This is one of those breakthrough beers that really pushes a new style to the forefront."
"This is a medium-full bodied sour with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is vinous. This is the closest thing I've had to Toronado. I'd love to do a side by side comparison of the two. The alcohol is well hidden, which leads to a damn drinkable strong sour. I'm glad I stocked up on this."
"Overall: I have loved each of the RR sours for what they offer and amazingly they are all different. This one is a welcome introduction into the world of dark sours and I absolutely loved it. An ace."
"D- I could drink this all day, except for the fact that it will give you a headache from the acid...or at least me haha."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Tart fruitiness quickly followed by woody tannins, earth and dry red wine. Hints of chocolate and caramel are present beneath it all, the last remnants of Salvation, perhaps? This all leads into a tart, dry and juicy finish with a blast of black currant. Consecration has nailed the beer/wine hybrid more than any other Russian River beer. While it's good stuff, I do find it a bit overwhelming. 9 times out of 10 I'd rather drink Supplication or Temptation."
"A good sour, but I'm not as big of a fan as everyone else seems to be. But I have had heard several accounts say the bottled version is ten times better than the draft version I sampled Maybe I need to sample the bottle someday for its optimal performance."
"Overall, great RR offering that i will be stocked up on for a while if i can resist the temptation to drink, so far i am not doing good and at $25 a bottle i cannot afford any more!!"
"D- Another great tasting sour from RR. You have to be able to appreciate sours to appreciate this excellant sour. I have only recently started venturing into the wonderful world of sours. I am glad to have had this opportunity."
"There is nothing glamorous about this beer's appearance. It's murky maroon'ish brown looking but there's nothing really off putting about it either, hence it's fine. What my nose and tongue pick up is a very sour cherry-like presence. This is followed by a dry tannic finish, very woody. The high alcohol is not really noticeable and the mouthfeel is a pretty light consistency. This beer is so easy to drink it's dangerous at 10%."
"On tap at Russian River. Pours dark, but not cloudy, just shimmering and purple to deep red. Almost no head, just a ring of light purple bubbles. Smells of tart cherries, red wine esters, alcohol. Nose is rich and inviting. Taste is supremely delicious. Sour, wine-like fruit flavor...lots of tart cherries, lip smackin'! Chocolate malt lingers beneath, but the feature is the big sourness that's just everywhere. I also get some currants and raspberries in there too. Sourness doesn't decrease much as i drink more, which i've found to be the case with other sours, it just sticks around and makes every sip a great and interesting experience. Drinks like a dream...a fantastic and memorable beer."
"**As I continue to drink this, the theme of this beer is ""balance."" Just perfectly in harmony."
"Na Zdrowie."
"D - Effing awesome at the bar. I gave this a perfect as it made me think twice about getting another Younger, but it ultimately lost. I will have this every chance I get."
"Color was a dark burgundy red, aroma had wine and fruit notes. Taste was great. Not too sour, very drinkable, lots of wine characteristics, dark fruit, kurants or cherries. Medium in body, light, if any head, almost no alcohol noticeable for 10%, delicious! I'll be trying to get a few bottles of this one..."
"Heavy influence of currants and cabernet / oak flavors. Blue and red berry fruits. Cassis, seemless and very balanced. Long finish and almost thick silky texture. Zero alc noticable. Tried from Keg at O'Briens Russian River nite. Not sure aging this would be helpful in developing more complexities?"
"Edit - I've had this beer a few times since the original review, still not wowed, but I've found myself liking it more and more. Upping the taste score to a 4 (from 3.5)."
"Thanks so much to Grant for sharing this wonderful growler with me, RustyDiamond, Brickstoredave, Ding, Atlantabeerdog, and SaintNathanial. Absolutely delicious and a great pleasure to drink this with friends. Poured a garnet tinged amber with a slight head. Beautiful color. Lovely aromas of cherries and ruby Port, with some astringency on the finish. Tastes tremendously complex with cherries, a little bit of funk, quite loamy and bitter- not horseblanket funk, but an earthier, forest funk. Quite astringent and a bit of sweet licorice on the finish. Dark and brooding with wildly interesting flavors. Quite intriguing. Smooth, tannic, and sour in the mouth. Utterly delicious and fascinating and extremely easy to drink despite the high abv."
"Amazing beer!"
"D: I had several glasses."
"Overall: This beer is yet another outstanding wild ale from Vinnie and Russian River. I love it, as I expected. If you ever get the chance, do not hesitate to try this beer."
"Growler from the brewery, I was stoked that my buddy Dane brought this back for me on his trip home from San Francisco, damn it was expensive though, split with my dad, poured into my New Belgium snifter, color was a dark red with some purple tint, minimal bubbly tannish head that went away quickly, no lacing, smell was black currants, raspberries, cherries, brett, oak, mild booze, toffee, sugar, and tart, flavor was great and you could not taste the ten percent at all, starts off with a nice sour bite, soft carbonation allows the grapes and cherry flavor to really come out in the middle, musty earthiness in the finish with more tart, like how this one feels at the end, mellows as it warms but nice sugary fruit work well with the sourness, mouthfeel is full and rounded, thicker body for a sour with a lower level of carbonation, taste lingers very well, easiest drinking ten percent beer out there, feel free to argue if you disagree, could have finished the jug off myself, not heavy on the stomach, somehow refreshing which is incredible for how strong it is, those red wine barrels did wonders to this one, Vinnie does not brew a bad sour and one thing is for sure, I will buying numerous bottles when this stuff is finally released outside of the pub, highly recommended"
"Pours a root beer color with almost no head (from a growler). The small head that is there quickly dissipates. The heavy aroma of sourness has me sniffing for a tad longer than usual. First sip is a puckering sour with wild yeast notes completely in charge. A wine flavor slips through the bitterness. Even with a somewhat low carbonation, the mouthfeel here is excellent. Truly an amazing beer. WOW!"
"This is a fantastic beer and one of the better sours I've had the opportunity to try. It's superbly well balanced and extraordinarily drinkable for the ABV. Highly recommended."
"Wow, I wish I could get a lot more of this one!!!"
"An extremely good beer overall. I haven't reviewed a beer in awhile, but this one warranted a formal review. I didn't find this one quite as good as Beatification (one of my top 3 beers ever), but it's not far behind. The cabernet barrel aging is very well done in that it lends complexity and character to the beer without totally overwhelming all other flavors. It'll be great to see this in bottles eventually."
"Drinkability- Right up there with all the other Wild Ales Vinnie brews, one of my new favorites. Winner of the fest IMO."
"On tap @ Russian River. Hot damn am I happy to see this on the chalkboard.Clear ruby brown with a small beige head, fading to a thin ring before long, and swrved in a snifter. Big oak and red wine nose up front with the vinegar and sour apple notes next. Buttery brett and leather peak out stronger as I nose this, and it's hard to pick out the sweet dark fruit that is Salvation in the base beer. Whoo! Flavor is full of tons of sour fruits and berries with a definite dry red wine and oak finish. Sour factor peaked ~ a 6-7,and I wanted to add there was some low earthy bitterness in the backend as well. I'm hard-pressed to find any Salvation in this. Full body with light prickly carbonation--just a little warming in the belly implies the 10%. Really effing good--looks like my Iowa homies are getting one pricey growler!"
"Wonderful beer and wish it was bottled"
"D - It's very strong for a sour, but it works as a sipper. This was so tasty that I got a growler, despite the hefty price tag. Vinnie is still the king when it comes to sours."
"D: A pretty intense but delicious beer, so couldn't have too many. My favorite sour ale as of yet. Would've got a growler of it but a bit too spendy."
"I haven't said this yet, but this beer is just fantastic. It has an incredible balance of tartness to rich fruit and light, though structured oak character. The flavor is just so well integrated, everything just seems to work together to carry this beer up to another level of complexity and interest. The oak really does add lots of structure, which goes a long way towards helping the overall balance of this beer. I like that the incredibly rich fruit character never gets overwhelming (back to that balance again). This is an awesome beer, whose enjoyment I am sure was magnified by the setting as well as the prior afternoon session of the GABF."
