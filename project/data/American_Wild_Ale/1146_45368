Perhaps it's just a factor of production totals. Certainly one of the better American-made sours that is widely available, calling to mind traditional Belgian styles like kriek and flanders red, but as noted, the unique element--blackberries--simply doesn't come through in a way that would really make this brew truly one-of-a-kind.","LambicPentameter","May 04, 2014"

4.46,4.9,4.5,4,4.75,4.25,4.5,"The beer pours a rich, pale purple with an amber flair. It sits in the glass as a rich, rose color with a small head of off-white bubbles that quickly leaves. In body, the beer is a deep, colorful murk with a definite opacity to it. When splashed against the sides of the glass it leaves a receding tide of lacing. On the nose, this thing is richly acidic with tart lemon, rich blackberry, blueberry, and even fresh and antiseptic mint. On a second sniff I receive rich, lightly toasted oak, soft malt vinegar, and smooth caramel malt. As I sniff more and more, I do get a sense of chlorine and pool house air, which isn’t completely off-putting, but is odd. On the tongue, this beer is hugely vinous with rich acidity that blossoms into sweet fruit, very faint salinity, and the briefest kiss of herbal bitters. The finish is rich with oak tannin, sweet fruit, and soft acidity. In flavor, this beer is delicately beautiful. It begins as a rich tide of lime and lemon citrus that erupts into rich berry notes mixing strawberry, blackberry, and blueberry. This is then ballooned outwards by a rich, lightly roasted oak and soft earthy characters. The finish returns to bright citrus that blends the berry and oak into a long and fruit-forward finish. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium with a rich, jam-like mouthfeel that gives a lovely bristle of fruit skin. Carbonation is soft but gives a nice sparkle and snap to the sip that keeps the beer from feeling heavy or syrupy. The mouth is left slightly wet and sticky from saliva. As I drink more and more the beer does become a little syrupy and left the tongue feeling a little heavy. The tannins add a touch of astringency that really helps with balancing out the syrupy sweetness. Overall, this beer is impeccably balanced. The syrupy sweetness does win out as you drink more and more of it, but it is never tiring to sip and the rich, subtle complexity in flavor makes it quite enjoyable. Goose Island must have a hell of cellar, and their blender’s tongue must be really refined because this beer is miles ahead of many of the other American Wild Ales. Haters be damned, Goose Island has still got it, and it is very good.","Maxwell","Apr 18, 2014"

Pours lightly cloudy red-orange color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart blackberry, raspberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, pepper, musty brett funk, leather, rye, toast, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of tart fruit, fruity/funky brett, malt, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of tart blackberry, raspberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, pepper, musty brett funk, leather, rye, toast, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart blackberry, raspberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, musty funk, rye, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of tart fruits, wine barrel, and big fruity/funky brett presence; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible fruited sour ale with 3 years of age. Big brett presence with great balance of wine barrel and blackberry fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 26, 2014"

It's worth a try if you're willing to shell out the money and I'm looking forward to trying their other sours.","Elprico","0"

I smell barnyard funk, straight brett. There is a dryness exemplified by the wine barrel on the back end. Tastes juicy, with the blackberry fruit bursting at each sip. The Brett character is apparent definitely keeping the sweetness in check. Carbonation is light on the palate, but I think it's just fine for the style. Overall a nice American wild that showcases great fruit character. I loved this and the Lolita I had a few nights back.","PlinyBeMiney","Jan 01, 2014"

4.38,3.1,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and a very good example of the style, so far it's the best American Wild Ale I have ever had, it took this style to a whole new level for me and I never thought that loads of tartness could work that well in a beer, it really changed the way that I look at this style. This beer had good drinkability, for as tart and sour as it is, it still goes down smooth and it was dry, clean, crisp, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention and keeping me coming back for more, but I would have a hard time limiting myself to just one glass since I think any more then that and it would just be too acidic for me, but I think it's a great beer to split with one or two other people. What I liked the most about this beer was how well the high level of tartness worked with this beer, it blew my mind. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, I thought the color was great, but unfortunately the head and lacing didn't match that and it ended up looking fairly wine like. I would for sure buy this beer again if I ever saw it, I wouldn't hesitate to grab a few bottles and see how it changes over time and for $12 I think this is a bargain. I highly recommend this to people who are a fan of the style and even to people who are just starting to get familiar with the style, like me. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, I didn't know I could like an American Wile Ale this much but somehow Goose Island managed to show me how good this style can actually be and they are quickly gaining my respect by producing these incredible American Wild Ales and Belgian inspired beers. Escoffier was my favorite American Wild Ale, but now it is Juliet. Great job guys this is now my favorite Goose Island beer and now I really want to try the remaining sisters that I have yet to get a hold of, thanks for the experience.","StoutHunter","Dec 28, 2013"

The flavors aren't very distinct (or I just can't describe them well), but I know that I like this beer quite a lot. It is probably too expensive, but I found myself thinking about buying another bottle after drinking this one on Christmas.","spoony","Dec 25, 2013"

Tart and funky fruit dominate the aroma here. Lemons, cherries, and berries with lots of lactic sourness and funk make up most of the nose with hints of brown sugar deep in the background. The flavor puckers your face up front with lemons and tart cherries. Light brown sugar malt sneaks in before the citric return and burns a hole deep into your nether region. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick tart puckering mouthfeel. Nice American wild, I'm glad I got to try it.","johnnnniee","May 17, 2013"

Hard to do, but the style says so, so for an American Wild, this is great. It is easily my favorite out of the 3 sisters, though all are fair examples of American interpretations of sour beer.

Aroma is nice and sour, it smells like tart berries, oak, and red wine. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, except that the berry flavor tastes more like sweet and tart blackberries, and that the sourness is stronger in comparison to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this beer, it's tasty and tart so I can't complain about that! $15.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Oct 03, 2012"

4.62,8.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a brown color with a ruby twinge and a slightly off white one finger head which recedes to skim and leaves little lacing. There is sticky carbonation bubbles on the side of the glass and the inside appears very carbonated. The aroma is wine like with blackberry and cherry notes very present along with a hint of white grape. The taste follows suit with a sour cherry flavor up front before a white grape wine taste takes over. The back end is all blackberries, well blended and a very good taste. The flavor leaves you wanting more. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and a bit stingy, almost like a champagne. Overall a very good beer, great aroma and flavor, I will seek this out again for sure.","goblue3509","Jun 07, 2012"

4.3,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Figured I'd celebrate my birthday with some bottle, might as well be a shelf sour (check my local's shelf...it's definitely there...). It pours a mostly clear sunrise auburn topped by a half-finger at best of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet berries, light tart cherry, very light and very mild Brett funk, and a kiss of vanilla. The taste eschews the eminent sweetness of the smell in favor of a few waves of varying degrees of sour: tart berries, sour cherries, tart red wine, a small bit of straight Brett funk, and a bit of white vinegar for the sake of it. Nothing is exceedingly powerful, though, allowing everything to meld together without o'erwhelming the taste buds or peeling the enamel off of the teeth. This is what sour beer brewers should be aiming for, dammit! The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, a very nice bit o' sour goodness, one of the premier beers I've yet had from Goose as a whole. Happy birthday to me!","TMoney2591","May 14, 2012"

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, funk, fruit, and vinegar. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, funk, fruit, blackberries, and subtle vinegar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. When I first smelled the vinegar aspect on this one I was concerned that it would overwhelm the beer and make it not so enjoyable. However, there was a just a subtle note of it in the flavor which allowed the blackberries to come through quite nicely. A really nicely put together brew for sure. Glad I got the chance to try this one and that I have one or two in my personal cellar for a later date.","thagr81us","0"

As she came of age, she learned to hone in on the narratives and focus in on the voices in her head. She had learned to learn a lot of things from the flowers, especially in the month of June. It was an ethereal talent that really did not give her any special insight to the world, but it was a power her own. “JULEZ? Are you still sitting out in the boysenberry patch?” Her conversation was interrupted abruptly and she had to put the rhododendron on hold. “Yeah mom, hang on.” The flowers really just complained and imparted sour notes into her life, but, somehow being so in sync with the idle problems of the flora made he feel whole.

Very sweet fruity sour. Well carbonated, sour throughout, and finishes (for the most part) dry. I find the finish to be almost stuck in the middle of being sweet and dry.

4.28,0.7,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"My 600th review and doing it in style. Been wanting to get a bottle of this for quite some time and found this bottle while on a recent trip to Chicago. Pours a dark orange/pink color with an enormous light pink head that fell slowly, but the bubbles were so big that it left virtually no lacing. It couldn't have looked much better on the initial pour. Big berry and tart lemon notes on the nose, light on the barnyard funk, but it's there buried beneath the fruit and the subtle oakiness. Upon first sip, this beer has a wonderful sourness, tart and lemony, mild red wine flavors, then slowly turns dry with a light rasberry-like tartness. The funk and tartness mingles well with the light fruit and is easily quaffable. The only complaint I have with this beer is that nothing really stands out with it. It's very light and very accessible for someone new to the style, but I'm liking it a lot, nonetheless. Carbonation is a little stingy at first, but a few swirls really calms it down and brings out some more fruity aromas. This is a fantastic brew, and I wish I would have picked up two bottles of this instead of the let down that was Allagash Interlude.","KeefD","Jan 27, 2010"

Lots of grapes and blackberries, but also a little toasted wood thrown in to this diverse grab-bag. Funky yeast and to different fruit flavors make the flavors of this wild ale pretty complex.

There is a surprising tart quality which is offset by a sweet flavor as well. Overall the sweet/tart is very balanced. It does resemble a wine in many ways.

The beer tastes just as good, not puckeringly sour, more of an accessible wild ale with just enough bite to keep an experienced palate happy. Undertones of berry flavors (apparently this was aged in wine barrels with blackberries) along with a mellow pucker and hints of lactose, delicious.

4.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"pour is murky... the best way to put it is a berliner weisse with the raspberry Himbeere. smell is initially blackberry, plum yogurt... palate of cabernet grape with a heavy accent of blackberry and rosemary. spanish wine simple but solid. tart with a banana bread finish. a light meaty quality. almond malt, vanilla mellow. appetite inducing. has a flemish wild ale odor that carries. not overpowering but works with the character. fantastic. glad its a chicago brewery. quite unique. not an american beer expectation to say the least.","rtepiak","Apr 08, 2009"

3.87,-8.9,4.5,5,4,2,3,"The aroma was great with hints of citrus, blackberry, and sour cherries galore. The beer poured a hazy orange color with just a slight head and good lacing. The flavor was an immediate sour cherry, almost overwhelmingly so. I got a faint hint of the blackberry, wood and spice. My major problem with this beer is that it had no body to it at all. It had the mouthfeel of sherbet mixed with 7up. I like effervescence in my beer, but this tasted like sour punch without the sugar. There's a nice alcohol finish to it and it's pretty well rounded on the finish...I just really wanted more body to it.","Benjiehorn","Apr 01, 2009"
4.7,10.6,4,4,5,5,5,"Overall, I believe this beer presents a compelling argument against the notion that a wild ale must be predictably pungent and puckering in sourness. I find it much more drinkable (and appreciable for a longer duration) than some of the other highly touted wilds.","kasper","Feb 15, 2009"
4.42,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Much more acetic, lacking the spritzy carbonation of batch 1-2. More fruit flavor, but it sacrifices carbonation. Will age one, jury is still out.","emerge077","Jan 29, 2009"
4.45,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is light with a vibrant, sharp carbonation up front.","JohnQVegas","Nov 12, 2008"
4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with an airy quality about it helped along by some fast moving carbonation. I'm unsure of the ABV here, but the brew goes down easily and has a refreshing quality about it with the vinous berry flavors and the subtle sourness. I could even see drinking this one the beach on a hot summer day. Very glad I was able to sample this and look forward to its release. Keep up the experiments Goose!","orbitalr0x","Oct 15, 2008"
4.45,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a fully clouded red hued brown. Nose is just funky sour goodness. Flavor brings the same. Lots of sour. Lots of funk. Tart fruits on top of vinegar. Yes friends. This is an American Wild Ale. Feel is typical; kind of thicker with a lower and slightly biting carbonation. Mmmmm. My favorite style. I love it.","RblWthACoz","Sep 25, 2008"

4.82,13.4,4,4.5,5,5,5,"So, my thoughts on the Juliet. First thoughts were that this is one of the most unique beers I have ever tasted. I don't have a lot of experience with Brett beers but after Juliet I will be seeking more out. There was a nice balance between the funky, tartness of the Brett and the mild sweetness of the berries. It started out with a mild tartness, similar to a wine and then finished with a faint sweetness and a hint of oak. The tartness was the flavor that lingered the longest afterwards but it was pleasant and not overwhelming. Honestly I haven't been able to stop thinking about this beer and the impression that it left on me and my taste buds. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many different beers I have tasted and few, if any, have left me pining for another almost a week later. I was somewhat reserved about it when it was compared to a lambic but I personally think it has much more appeal than a mainstream lambic such as Framboise which I feel is somewhat cloying. Also, it is much easier on the palate than a lambic such as Cantillion which can shy new beer drinkers away from the enjoyment of tart flavors. From what I've read the Sour Beers are going to be the next big thing. They are huge on the west coast but besides from a few small brewers (Jolly Pumpkin for example) no one has really tapped into them here in the Midwest. I think Juliet would be wildly successful and a great addition to the reserve line.","littleg","May 04, 2008"
