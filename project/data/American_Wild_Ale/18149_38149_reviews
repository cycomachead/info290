"This beer is really a treat. Its just the perfect American take on a classic Belgian Stye. It tasted like sour cherry lemonade. Hints of barnyard funk that were buried under the strong lemon tartness mixed with the perfect hint of cherry sourness. The oak provided an unbelievable barrel character that tied the beer together. It's truly a special beer"

"Bottle: Poured a clear yellow color ale with a nice white foamy head. Aroma of funky notes with clearly identifiable sour notes with some acidic notes also noticeable is quite intense. Taste is also dominated by funky notes with some sharp sour notes, quite a bit of acidity and a short finale. Body is about average with good carbonation. I get what they are trying to do and I also get why people enjoy this but in my opinion while this is a great beer there is a lack of balance and too much acidity in the end."

"Drank this in celebration of my engagement! Doesn't get any better than that.....or does it?!"
""
"Overall: maybe I have odd taste in sour beers, but this one certainly doesn't blow me away. it tastes good is well done but I don't understand what sets this apart from hundreds of other sours."
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the most balanced beers within this style I have had so far.  Very drinkable and extremely tasty.  Happy I had the chance to try it."

"this is whale status, thanks to these guys for bringing the 2013 edition to gabf this year, the line was worth it, although i think the hype out shines this one a little, and i frankly took more away from the framboise de amorosa than i did from this one. still, elite level sour beer here, blonde and hazy in the look with an enormous gushing white head that never settles. the nose is lambic like, oaky and quite sour, with lemons being the leader of a fruit gang that also seems to include white grapefruit, chardonnay grapes, and orange. wheaty base is real simple, lets the funky critters shine, and shine they do. moderate body with maxed out carbonation moves a little too swiftly though the experience for me, and my two ounce pour wasnt really enough to contemplate this one the way i otherwise might, but a second dose clarified what i suspected from the first, this is one of those beers that is partially famous because its awesome, and partially famous because its a standard setter, it came before a lot of the other new wave sours that everyone loves, its a precursor to a trend, and i respect it highly in that context. the beer just didnt seem to have the depth of some others, not missing anything per se, but i expected the world here. not let down, just dont all the way get it. the fruitiness is nice, and the sourness is reserved and mature but definitely distinct. not way different from duck duck in a lot of ways, although i think this a much more highly refined brew. overall outstanding, but less compelling than i hoped for. i will have to get a bottle and give it more attention..."

"O - This reminded me a lot of DDG. If I had to choose between the two, considering the difficulty of obtaining CC, I would have to go with DDG. They are both on par in terms of taste, but the difficulty pushes me away."

"O: Such a treat and what a surprise. Amazed this is holding up so well. A wonderful wild ale. Only minor flaw is the lack of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is up there with the best gueuze I've had. It definitely holds back on the funk unlike Drie Fonteinen and Cantillon, but has a wonderful complexities and restraint."
""
""
""
"O- Very aggressive but not as complex as Duck Duck Gooze is. In my mind, this beer is somewhere in between Beat and DDG on the spectrum of AWAs- aggressive but with a solid layer of complexity that's done very well with time. This one did not disappoint, though it's still a long-standing philosophical question as to whether it is worth what it requires to obtain a bottle of this. While I would recommend going after Duck Duck Gooze or Beatification instead of this one, please don't get me wrong- this is an excellent AWA."

"D - It's lost some character over 6 years and not made up for it with sour development. Whereas Beatification is explosive and overbearing and DDG is fresh and focused, I find this sitting somewhere in the middle."

"Overall: Cable Car is a great American Wild Ale, but as with so many beers it is no where near the hype. I wonder how the earlier vintages compare to the 2013."
"Pours a clear light peach color with almost one finger of white head. Head dissipates pretty quickly, but maintains a thin collar. Aromas of white grape, brett, light peach and mild funk. Funk is more pronounced in the taste, but is still on the mild side, with nice brett presence. Tart without being overly sour, with a nice white wine aspect to the taste, along with citrus, peach and nectarine. Quite easy drinking. Finish is tart and semi-dry. Mouthful is medium/light with a bit of creaminess. Nice carbonation level. I think I like DDG a bit more, but this is an excellent American wild."
""
"Pour is golden yellow with a bubbly white head. Nose has very faint barrel with hints of acetic acid, notes of leathery bret and orange peel with a nice vinous quality. Taste is very drinkable, sour white grape skins and citrus with hints of oak and vanilla. Faint leathery bret and a touch of citrus towards the back of the palate. Lighter body and strong carbonation (shocking) with a dry and lightly sour finish. Very delicate flavors and pretty well done."

"Felt this one needed a full review. Acquired my bottle from a friend who was in the right place at the right time. A big thanks to her for scoring me a 2013 vintage of this. This beer poured out as a hazy orange gold color with a foamy white head on top. Lots of bubbles rising to the top and collecting at the surface to hold a strong retention. Decent lacing streaks down the glass with every sip. The smell of the beer is potent, it's pretty funky and rank. Basically it stinks but it's awesome for the style, it's exactly how I would expect it to smell. The taste of the beer has a sharp tartness up front which then settles into a really nice sweet grainy wheat like finish. This beer is very bold yet delicate in flavor, it's hard to explain. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a solid carbonation. The beer is very drinkable. Overall this is definitely something special and I believe it's worth seeking out at least once. I'd love to drink it again one day but I don't want to drop the money on it like I did for this one."

"O- I think this is good, not great. I have the whole vert, so maybe if I popped open the '09 I would get a religious experience, but not yet from the '13."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour and tart fruit-like flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and very easy to drink."

"Bottle was hard to open and barely a sound as the cork came out. Barely any head was produced as it poured. The smell is sharply acidic with not to much funk and hints of apple. Flavor follows suit with a lot of acidity but not to much else going on. The mouthfeel is low carbonation highly puckering. Overall this is a very tasty sour just kind of one dimensional and under carbed, not worth what a lot if people trade."

"O: Delicate, but vibrant. Delicious American Wild. The fruity notes that came out were great despite no fruit being added. Thanks again to Kevan for sharing."
"Verdict: A remarkable sour from The Lost Abbey that rivals anything being made in America currently. The fruit characteristics of this beer are remarkable and while it lacks slightly in funk and barnyard character, it is really a well rounded and balanced sour."

""
""
""

""
"T: Pretty sour right away with a big lemon warhead kick. Layers of unripe green apple and sour red cherry and just a touch of funk. Finish leaves just a touch of dryness on the tongue with a lingering sourness. Tight, prickly carbonation works perfectly in here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Large bubble thin head. A weird orange color head. Body is cloudy. Wheat color. Aroma is the best sour I have had. Lemon, twigs, slight funk. Very delicious. A little young. Well balanced. Nice lemon tart, funk, and a little sweet. Lacto. Mouth is light carb and puckering."

"Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle."

"O: A fantastic AWA that has held up nicely, though not sure how much longer it will hold out. Thankful I was able to give this one a try."

"750mL 2010 ed b4 at Toronado SF. The pour is a bright yellow with a medium, white head that leaves incredibly sticky lace. Pretty much a 5/5 for sour beer where the near zero sugar content makes it tough for lace to stick. Aroma of cotton candy, caramel, pink lemonade, sour/acetic impeding funk, fresh grapefruit, lemon, and acetic spice reminiscent of Hanssen’s Gueuze, funky white wine. Taste is incredibly soft, not truly sour as much fresh and tart. Bretty earth comes into play atop a beer that exhibits a sweet and sour play on the tongue that is hard to describe with sufficiency. Fresh caramel and sweet oranges take center stage rather than lemon or vinegar. What a perennial treat. 2/4/2011 9/5/8/5/16=4.3"

"Overall: This is a very good beer, but it was missing that wow factor for me. Still quite nice and I wouldn't turn down more."
""
"O - this beer is something else. Each vintage was different and special in its own way, but I'd say the '07 or '09 were the tops. I'm honestly surprised to see how well these are holding up and think they could go shoulder to shoulder with any of the Loons or 3F out there."
"O - An extremely solid American wild. May not be super fair to put this up against everything else. It doesn't fall short, per se. It's a very very good sour."
""
""
""
""
"Similar carbonation and appearance to 2009. More funk than fruit and not quite as sour as the 2009."
"Drink- Very tasty and much creamier than the 09. I can see this one aging very well. (4.5)"
""
""
""
""
"This was incredible. I'm glad to have skipped the line at Churchill's for this. This is a great sour with lots of citrusy complexity and a great mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - What an excellent beer. People say that this is the best year so far though - I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to try this. The thing is, as good as Cable Car proves to be, it's really not necessarily any better than the readily available Russian River sours that sit on shelves within their range of distribution. With this in mind, Cable Car is a beer that lives up to the praise, but not the hype."
""
""
""
""
"At the Alcohol level, a whole bottle of this would be a sinch to a sour lover, alas, thats never going to happen. Lost Abbey sure can brew some sours and CC is no slouch"

"This is Cable Car, and it's great. Tasting it after the 2008 and 2009, it's not my favorite, but as a sour beer it's still world class and something for brewers to aspire to."
""
""
"Pours a relatively clear golden copper color with a nice white head that hangs around and leaves light rings of lacing. Aroma is surprisingly funky and complex with lemon and green apple sourness dominating. More fruit and tart than earthiness but there is light straw and grass throughout as well. Body is very citric and crisp, full on the palate with high carbonation. Flavor start with lemon and other citrus rind, before becoming more oaky and tart with only lingering sourness. Expected to be let down by this, but was pleasantly surprised and look forward to trying other vintages."

"O: Fantastic! Well worth the price tag and visit to Toronado. I managed to share about 6 ounces with my wife and I honestly regretted letting that much get away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light body with minimal carbonation, a slight prick of a bubble here and there, but expected for a wild ale. Very easy to drink but one to savor with how nice it is at two years old. Hopefully Toronado still has a 2010 bottle available when my birthday approaches in a few weeks as I was hoping to go open one then. Excellent beer."

"D: Sessionable, even at $40/bottle. Although to be honest, I won't be ordering this again while there's still an available stock of '11 Kriek. Cheers!"
"D: What can I say, this was a great beer. Very happy to have finally tried it. At first I didn't get it, but the beer eventually showed me what was up. Seek out if you like sours"
"O: Lost Abbey's Cable Car comes about as close to perfect as any brew I've ever encountered. It does everything right, with not only ease, but a deft touch. Absolutely worthy of the epic hype and them some. This brewing masterpiece easily receives my highest recommendation. Happy 30th to me!"
"Overall: The flavor is great and sour throughout, and each flavor note is so robust, I really enjoyed this beer."
"(D)- Honestly, this is a great wild ale. Worth the hype? maybe, but definitely not worth the difficulty in getting a bottle outside of Toronado; glad i didnt have to."
"This is a great sour. So well done. I understand the hype on this beer."
"Finish has some citric notes, but somewhat dry earthy finish as well. Exceptional beer."
"O: Good. This is a solid gueuze, but not outlandishly good."
"D - Very drinkable. The sour and tart flavors are outstandingly balanced from start to end here. It was really a pleasure to drink this beer, regardless of the price since I felt it was really that good."
"This is good. I'd love to drink another bottle or two of this beer-- but I wouldn't want to be the one to trade for them!"
"Despite the enjoyable tartness and light fruit flavors I was underwhelmed by this. I’ve heard the bottles taste better however so I’m looking forward to trying it another time."
"A really good wild ale with a balanced funk character, good tartness and solid flavour."
"Cheers"
"Update, after flying to San Francisco and bellying up to the bar at Toronado with a bottle of '09 Cable Car; I realized that I might have just hit the apex in my pursuit of sour/wild ales!!!"
"2007 bottle. Big thanks to Gtreid for the share, and to mikesgroove for trading this bottle to him in the first place. The brew pours a radiant golden hue and is capped with a filmy white head. My glass is quite translucent due to a careful pour. The nose is very nice, although slightly too understated for me; lemon, green apple skin, cut grass and tannic oak are the mainstay of the aroma, and it is quite similar to a mild Hanssen's Gueuze in smell. The flavor ramps up the complexity and intensity relative to the aroma, and the result is outstanding. Perfect tartness, notes of lemon juice and zest, kaffir lime, nectarine, green apple, general acidity and woody notes are observed on the palate. The feel is very smooth whilst retaining tooth, and has an unbelievably clean finish. Overall I am very impressed. Worthy of the hype. Better than DDG. Almost as good as IP. I cannot yet make a YB comparison."
"From Notes (Finally coughed up the $40 for this treat). It was worth every single penny! 2009 Vintage at San Francisco Toronado. Pours a light, golden-amber color with a medium white head. The carbonation is looking quite delightful on this beer. Scent is very funky with some intense lactic sour notes. As the beer warms the fruit really comes out. I get some sweet pear aromas, along with peach and apricot. The taste is out of this world... I went into this with high expectations, and I was not let down! Mouth puckering! Much more sour than expected. There are some sweet pear flavors with lemon and a close resemblance to Sweet Tarts candy. Mouthfeel is extremely dry and puckering on the inside of my cheeks, tongue, and roof of my mouth. Drinkability is high, as this beer is just so damn tasty! Overall, I'm just very happy this beer did not disappoint. It exceeded in all aspects. Good job Lost Abbey!"
"Overall this is a fantastic sour. Each sip is more enjoyable all the way to the end of the bottle. Very aromatic and fruity, but not sweet. Drinking amazingly right now. The sour interacts perfectly with the fruity taste."
"O: This is one great beer. I don't like the overpowering sourness of many wilds, but this one is just about perfect for me. I would put this at the top of the list in terms of sours. Skal."
"Pops open with a bit of a gush, but the pour smacks the head in the face and you get a pour with almost no head. Bubbles gently caress the outskirts of the bottle. It pours a golden rod yellow and is very opaque. The smell is very fruity, but not very yeasty as some American Wild Ales tend to be. The tartness is also very well toned down in this beer. The mouthfeel on this beer is very playful its not too light. A very refreshing beer! Overall this beer is a definite A+ but the drinkability of it is kind of low unless you have an in with Toronado crew."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma ws comprised of sweet malt, fruit, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. My only gripe about this one was that the flavor was quite subdued... While the flavor was great it just seemed slightly watered down compared to the other offerings I have had as of late. The aroma on this however was nothing short of excellent though. How good was this one you might ask??? Myself and Kenneyho started using it as a palate cleanser at around 2AM that morning... Definitely worth the buzz that surrounds this one. Hope to try some older vintages for comparison in the future for comparison (hint hint traders)."
"All in all an enjoyable beer, glad I made the journey to get it, but don't think I'd do it again."
"3.5 D: Good beer, but it isn't as impressive (at least not this vintage) as the reputation suggests. However, if nothing else, it is well balanced and highly drinkable. Good value for $20, barely acceptable for $30, but $40 is far too much after the novelty is achieved."
"Medium light in body with medium carbonation. There’s a pleasant dry finish following the lactic acidity. Very drinkable, though I wouldn’t object to a little more acidity, which I’m sure varies according to the vintage. Personally, I wouldn’t give up the farm for this, but wouldn’t pass up a chance to try it."
"Overall: well worth the 40.00 price tag when split 5 ways."
"O - Pretty good, but not as good as previous vintages. Still an excellent wild ale, and worth seeking out."
"Overall great, very drinkable, light tartness, nice dry light bready funk, even has some carbonation."
"O: I would drink this over and over again."
"Mouthfeel: thin bodied. Medium carbonation. Just perfect for this style. I could drink multiple glasses of this without getting sick of it."
"O- This reminds me alot like a shocktart. Makes your face pucker but you go back for more. The more I drink this, the better it taste. To me, this is definitely not worth the $40 pricetag. I'm glad to say I tried it but I won't be trying this again anytime soon."
"Overall - This was a delicious beer that challenges the taste buds with the exceptional balance of citrus sourness and superb fruit flavor."
"Thanks Alex."
"O - Outstanding, great wild ale. Another one I was beginning to think I'd never get to sample. Interesting, slightly different combo of fruity flavors in a wild and balanced very well with a distinct but manageable tartness/sourness."
"Orangy-yellow with a tiny amount of head. The nose is tart lemon with a nice funky sour smell. Like funk-spiked lemonade. The taste is like the nose - sour, funky, dry lemonade. No booze comes off at all, this beer is light and freshing. If this beer came in $9 6-packs, I would enjoy them all summer long. Really a fantastic, easy drinking sour. If you haven't enjoyed sours before, this is a really nice entry point - too bad it is so difficult to get."
"Narrative: Sir Fredrick Willingsly is repossessing your car. You can't hate him for doing his job, but, without a 1998 civic DX, these pizzas arent going to deliver themselves. You hate him, with his cliche antagonistic handlebar moustache and fogged up monocle. However, his wry quips relating to Howards' End and class struggle made it all the sweeter. ""And thence upon from which one has had, none shall take without"" he declares with a cloud of aplomb that almost makes you lighthearted in his usurpation of your chief economic asset. He is akin to the Mr. peanut of recurring vengeance. your pocket despises him, yet you respect him for his casuistic enforcement of the law. ""God speed Willingsly, dont scratch my sick mugen exhaust on the dip. Godspeed."""
"Very good, very expensive."
"Expensive. Can't get a perfect overall score when you're $40 and only available at 2 bars, one of which sucks ass."
"O: I was glad to have tried this, but given the exclusivity and price tag, probably won’t search it out again. It was good, but better, similar beers can be found much more easily."
"Over all pretty damn tasty and can't wait to do a side by side car tasting with the 2010"
"O - Such a wonderful beer, having it at the Toronado only makes it a more memorable experience. What a night!"
"o - Overall one of the best sours I've had; I'm really glad it actually lived up to my expectations. Had a lot of great beers at DLD and this one was probably my favorite. Lots of sour and tart lemons and while not overly sour, it's very refreshing and enjoyable. Would jump at the chance to by a bottle of this one when and if I make it out to Toronado."
"A huge thanks to jedwards for sharing this beer. 2009 vintage served in a Sinners tulip. The color of this beer is really quite eye-catching. Bright tangerine in color with a loose, bright white head and a semi-hazy clarity. The head is refreshed with a gentle swirl of the glass and sheets of lacing coat the sides of the glass, gradually yielding to some strands and spots of lacing encircling the bowl. Nose is fairly subdued - tart citrus and a trace of cork. Taste reveals tart and acidic citrus fruit, a slightly salty character and the flavor of cork. Mouthfeel is light in body with an effervescence akin to champagne. This beer is so tart that it puckers the cheeks before culminating in a very dry finish. This has to be, by far, the sourest sour I've had to date. There's a lot going on here and I'm grateful to finally have the opportunity to try this beer outside of a fest."
"Pours a pretty golden yellow. a bit hazy with a nice amount of white head. Smell is phenomenal. Tons of tart sour lemons with a nice grassy touch. The sour kick is very prominent but not offputting like some ""overly sour"" beers I've had. Tastes very mellow. Lots of tart lemon with a sourness that melds well with the rest of the beer. I could drink this all day every day. The flavour profile is predominently lemon with some nice grassy tones in the background. Overall solid mouthfeel, very drinkable. My favourite sour to date."
"The carbonation is very active. Prickly on the tongue throughout most of the bottle. A little drying. Overall...wow! So glad I finally got to have this one. Worth the wait."
"O - Way too expensive, but a very tasty brew. May have to bring a couple friends to drink one of these next time."
"Overall its a great one. Price tag is high but I'm on vacation!"
"drink: forever"
"D - Drinks so quickly and the carbonation helps save the palate."
"Excellent beer. Pretty much all I drank first night of '10 GABF. Great glowing pour, silky head. Nose is quite sour with lots of fruit and sweet malt notes. Taste is perfectly balanced. Belgianesque as usual Vinny. Cimplex and refreshing. Great stuff. Could drink any time."
"D- Nice refreshing, light, balanced beer. This is one I could finish myself and still want more."
"Truly a world-class beer."
"D - Quite high. How could I not give this a five? I drank the entire bottle in one sitting and I barely felt it. Not too tart like some of the other wild's I have had recently. Nice and refreshing. I wish this wasn't such a pain in the ass to get. I would love to have a few of these for special occasions. Quite tasty stuff for sure."
"09: Bubblier than the 08. Big acetone notes. The most tart of any, and the harshest. Still a great beer though."
"Interesting and complex, Cable Car is a pretty good Wild Ale that doesn't leave your tongue feeling like it took a beating, but maintains a lot of sourness. With that said, I really wouldn't pay forty bucks at Toronado for a bottle. Well, if I could go back in time I wouldn't anyway."
"Bottle. 2010 vintage. Had at Toronado San Diego! So excited. Saw this beauty behind be glass cooler and just had to have it, even at $40/bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazed amber gold color with a nice fluffy white head that settles to a nice collar and leaves lace. The aroma is very nice, a blend of sweet grape, fruit, and a nice sourness as well. Very white wineish. Light mothfeel with a fai bit of carbonation. The taste is nice but not as sour as I thought it would be but being the 2010, I'm not surprised it hasn't fully soured up yet. Slightly sweet start like apricot gives way to some funkiness. Finishes dry like a white wine. Splendid."
"I like the fruit rather than funk oriented Lost Abbey sour character present in this, DDG, Brouwer's imagination, IP. I wish it had more funk but all in all a very good beer and time seems to be helping it a lot from reports i heard of this initially."
"D: Easy drinker and very enjoyable. Just wish it were a little more affordable."
"Overall, Lost Abbey has failed to impress me on so many levels. However, this beer (and vintage) might be the exception. Might be one of the best American sours I have had aside from Deviation."
"over all a great beer. This vintage is certainly young and needs some more time to develop and creat the tart sour flavors that are missing!"
"D: Hugely dirnkable. Very balanced in every way. Tartness is present but not overwhelming and this is one of the fruitiest AWAs that I've had in a while. 7% is not high but alcohol seems nearly non-existant here. Never thought I'd say this but... worth the price!"
"Overall: A very good ""sour"" for sure, just not sure if it's the best. I prefer ""Duck Duck Gooze"" and/or ""Isabelle Proximus"" over ""Cable Car"". A must try. Cheers!"
"Ive had this beer a number of times, A fresh bottle is about as sour as it gets IMO. I had this a few times in all vintages, I opened a batch1 about 10 months ago and remember that it was alot less sour and funky, It had supprised me how much it had faded over time."
"Cable Car is definitely one of the best American wild ales I have yet to try. I would love the opportunity to sample this again."
"2007 bottle generously shared at a recent Chicago crew tasting, thanks! Pours a golden yellow with no head, some bubbles here and there. Smell is a musky spice, some lemon and acidic notes, a bit of funk. Taste is pretty amazing - tart orange, cinnamon spiciness, sour but very clean. Some mellow peaches in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium/light with a low carbonation, not too dry but finishes clean. An amazing beer, different from any sour I have had. Very, very drinkable."
"Pours a lightly hazy amber-brown color, with a good, white head. Funky and tart on the nose, lemon, citrus and aged leather. On the palate, a good sourness, with apples, citrus puckering wine. This one was tart and dry, with a prickly carbonation. Didn't think I'd have the opportunity to try this one, but I did, and I'm glad, though I have no intention of ever tracking a bottle down."
"This is a damn tasty bottle of beer and probably the ultimate representation of the American Wild Ale style. Not too sour, not too funky, highly drinkable."
"D: I'd drink a lot if I could (I'm not sure my stomach would agree). I feel lucky to try giving circumstances and not to lie, I tried more than once!"
"2009 bottle. Slight chill haze golden with frothy 2 fingers of white head. Aromas of champagne vinegar, apple cide vinegar, slight horse stable, meyer lemon. Effervescent dry and lemony on the nose. Slight lemony vinegar tartness. The funk is there, but underneath it all. Very dry and tart, moreso than sour or funky. Very delicious and highly drinkable. Splendid ringed lacing in the glass with a white ring staying on top of the golden liquid. More lemon than green apple, with zesty fruity to say the least. Dry yet glossy citric lemon tart mouthfeel, with a side of dry funk."
"Exceptionally drinkable (despite some of my adjectives above, this really isn't an esoteric beverage), and a great beer to share with good friends."
"O - Hmmm. Is this a beer that I would cross the world for? Or pay $40 for again? Well, probably not. It's too similar to several cheaper, although also very limited, beers that I have in the cellar. But is it a beer that I'm very glad to have tried? Absolutely."
"D: $40 for this beer is idiotic. If it were outstanding, I might consider paying it; but for a beer that is a misfire out of the gate and needs time to improve (if it even does), no."
"J"
"Drink- Easy drinking beer, especially for a sour, possibly too easy of a beer for this style. Overall a good and well balanced beer, but could have used a little more flavor. I will be interested to see how this beer matures over time in comparison to the previous vintages."
"Now that I have had this fresh, I prefer this aged. The aged 2007 seemed to have more fruit flavors where as this came across as a fresh unbalanced gueuze. Would I pay forty a bottle again? Most likely..."
"This one lived up to the hype for me.  This is probably the second best American sour that I've had after RR Deviation, and slightly ahead of RR Beatification.  Well done, Tomme!"
"Puckering and tart, balanced sourness, lemon, orange, and grapefruit blend seamlessly. It lingers on the palate, with traces of oak, citrus, and grape. Salivary glands kick into overdrive. Clean and quenching sourness, balanced with a good deal of wild complexity. Unique but maybe not the pinnacle sour ale from Lost Abbey. Thanks again Anwar for the opportunity!"
"I was very glad and thankful for the opportunity, but solidifies my poor overall impression of Lost Abbey."
"D - Very drinkable, as it is happily complex and there is nothing overpowering going on here."
"D: Very drinkable all around for a sour. Definitely glad to finally be able to try this one out and would love to have it again, although it's definitely not quite up there with Isabelle and Veritas 004."
"Perfect carbonation with some serious drinkability for a sour as it's not too sour. Amazing stuff."
"Overall this beer didn't disappoint. It isn't the best sour that I've ever had but it does come very close. Well worth the shot if you can get your hands on it."
"2007 bottle thanks to Sean. Found this to be very sweet."
"D: chased this beer for a couple months and was not dissapointed. I could drink quite a bit of this beer if it was avaliable like that."
"D: Yeah. This is good. Real, real good. Wish I had more. But sadly this is it."
"The body is medium/full and the carbonation is about perfect for the style. Overall this one met my expectations and was definitely memorable. One of the better American Wild Ales I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"The mouthfeel is nice and light, with a good level of ""tiny bubble"" carbonation to make it refreshing and easy to drink. I would love to have more of this. I'm very glad I got to try this."
"Cable Car 09 by Lost Abbey is an American Wild Ale aged in oak barrels and 7%. It poured a hazy straw yellow. It smelled very sour, some Chardonnay notes, citrus, oak, wood and some funk. It tasted like citrus, lemon, a hint of pineapple, oak, wood and extremely sour from start to finish with some good bitterness in there as well. It was the tartest of the evening."
"The beer is very carbonated, which is something I really appreciate for this style. I think the carbonation compliments the sharp fruit flavors and overtly sour tones of the beer, there is a nice dry finish that leaves the palate feeling nice and clean and craving more. The crisp flavors, dry finish and well masked alcohol make this beer very drinkable."
"Overall, I found this to be right in the middle of Isabelle Proximus (funky) and DDG (fruity). I'd like to think of this beer as the definition of a sour."
"D: This particular bottle was the best of the Cable Car pours that I've had. A solid sourness and nice fruit character, but a little lacking in the ""funk"" department."
"Drinkability was higher than I originally thought upon first sip. As you become acustomed to the sourness it goes down easier and easier until you want to just chug the whole glass. It's kind of like drinking the sweet tarts candy :)"
"N: Not overly tart or sour. Well done, and damn tasty for sure."
"There aren't many beers that are hyped as much as cable car that are genuinely this good. I love me a good wicked tart beer and this qualifies. Both the aroma and the flavor are pungently tart and dry with a touch of the horse blanket. It is still pretty smooth despite the intense tartness. Perhaps a bit of apple in there also. One of the driest beer beers in the aftertaste, perhaps almost a bit too much. Overall, a terriffic beer."
"Beer is medium to low bodied and has a slightly citric sourness to it. Nothing much in the forward but there is a definite and growing sourness in the back of the mouth. Drinkability for this beer is really high and mouthfeel is great. Lots of carbonation on the tongue contributes to the overall sourness and feel of this beer. I'm in love."
"D: A fine brew, and easy to sip, given the style."
"Popped and poured into Lost Abbey chalices at Toronado. It gushed after popping the cork. It was hazy golden yellow, a healthy amount of foam and good lacing. There is a strong aroma, with plenty of citrus and some nice funk. The taste is fantastic they are notes of citrus, lemon, pineapple, some nice bitterness, some oak, that hoarse blanket goat cheese flavor, the strongest flavor is the tart sourness. Its exquisite in it's balance and complexity. It has a nice carbonation and it goes down very easy. It's amazingly drinkable. you could sip it all night!"
"2009 version, at Toronado, so glad to finally try it. The first pour was a little hazy and light golden colored, but each successive pour was a little darker and murkier. Judging by aroma and taste, this is exactly what an American wild ale should taste like, at least in my humble opinion. Musty sour barnyard funk, some lemon, this is really not that far from some of the best gueuze I've had in Belgium. Lost Abbey may have some bad press due to carbonation issues on high gravity ales, but they absolutely have wild ales by the balls. The sour bite never infringes on my enjoyment, maybe because it's expertly crafted, or maybe because of severe acclimation to the style. It truly sucks to like something so much when you know you can't easily get it. This will always be on my WANTs list. At least there's Cantillon to hold me over..."
"Overall, a world class wild ale that earns all the hype and high ratings. Highest recommendation - you must try this especially if you love wild ales. A bitch to find but so worth it. Rotation - not avail in TX. Extremely rare release. If I could, I'd have a bottle constantly in my fridge and cellar. As is, I'll keep searching for a trade as well as having at the Toronado-San Diego during my soon to be annual trips out there."
"This is a superb American wild - well balanced but still nice and sour. I wouldn't put it in the same class as the T20, but it's still a great beer."
"Overall, a very nice wild ale. Nice and sour, just the way it should be. I could go for a lot more of this. A very well done sour. I hope I can try a fresh one of these in a month or so when I visit Toronado."
"We'll continue to try to catch it, catch the fog, but we will never understand what it will be like until we're there, gleaming white robes, the airy, tearful metallic tartness that reminds of sunny fog, rainy sunshine, the most beautiful days on earth."
"I had the opportunity to try some of the '08 next to this and I must say that I think I prefer this fresh, as the citrus is more pronounced and the funk hadn't yet started to overtake it. That said, this stuff is the real deal, and I feel very fortuitous to have been able to try this on draft. I think that there might certainly be some comparable Wilds out there that are a bit easier to get but by no mean pass this up if you get a chance to try it."
"Clear golden yellow color with a slight orange hue with a quickly dissipating white head, leaving only a ring around the glass. Lactic acid and citrus in the nose. There's some funkiness to it, but I get more tropical fruit than anything else. Lightly spicy on the tongue with some barnyard funk and a little bit of tropical fruit. As it warmed in the glass, the tropical fruit remained, but more of a foot-like Brett character came through. Medium high carbonation with a dry finish. Drinkability is exceptional; easy to drink a bunch of this, though availability won't allow it. Flavors aren't all that intense, but they are refined and lead to a good drinking experience."
"Great mouthfeel, nicely carbonated (!) . Very drinkable and I'm glad to have the chance to try this one, but I think that I like DDG better, not to mention how much more attainable it is/was."
"08 and 09 sampled side by side toro sd during sdbw. 09 was better in almost every facet. Funk, sour, mouthfeel and complexity. a step below something like DDG. both had similar color, mouthfeel ect. 09 just smelled and tasted funkier. Very cool to try and both vintages to boot. Horse blanket, some citrus, wheat, and nice brett ect flavors. 08 was just flat in flavor and funk, maybe more mellowed. hadn't had 08 when it was 1st released so maybe on release it was like the 09 this nite. would say hold 08's if in bottle for a later date for the funk to develop with more time."
"To start this review off I want to thank sprinkle for this delightful oppurtunity to try this beer. I have just recently gotten into sours and wild ales and I know that this was a very special treat for me to be able to try this. The intital taste is sour, but goes away with a warmth feeling. A touch of a salty taste to it, but not very predominant. This beer by far exceeded any expectations I had for it. Again very blessed to have tried this and added this notch to my belt..."
"I hate to repeat myself, but this is the perfect execution of funk. More than any other beer, but it is a higher quality funk as well, if that makes any sense. Very approachable and tasty. This batch seems to be doing quite well, might be the best of the three. As I drink it all I can think is ""this is how a beer should taste."""
"D-Highly! This is quite delicious. Not too tart, not too dull...a wonderful amalgamation of flavours. A highly regarded sour for a reason--fine stuff."
"A let down...I can only hope to acquire a batch #2 or #3 soon."
"D: I was pouring for Lost Abbey during BBF and I kept drinking this. I had the duck and yellow bus and sinners but my glass was constantly filled with this. I though this would be much more sour. It is more balanced than I thought it would be."
"This is an amazing beer that for me truly lived up to the hype. It is just a perfect blend of tart/puckering sourness, crisp delicious fruit notes and a dry sweet yet tart delectable finish. This beer tasted better with each sip and my mouth was literally watering in anticipation of each sip. This is one of the most complex, flavorful sours I've ever had and I cannot recommend it any higher. I only wish I had more."
"D - Well, the sourness, while not too intense, gets to be a bit much in this case, and I don't think it's all that drinkable overall. Oh yeah, and it's way overpriced at $45 a bottle."
"Overall wow. The taste was just out of this world. It could have used a bit more pop in the carbonation and appearence but that being said it was still unreal. Super damn drinkable and just absurd. Worth the hunt as I cannot compare it to anything else."
"D - This beer makes you sit back and appreciate it. It's easy to drink fast, but why? It's great to chill out while sipping on this from time to time. I don't want this bottle to end, but I'm glad I was able to pop this one open and enjoy. Lost Abbey, you have done it yet again!"
"Tasted at Cleveland tasting on 8-23-08. Thanks!! Batch 2 was poured with a golden color and thin white head. Has a slight funk aroma, some citrus, and some spice. Has a medium body. Taste is tart, some fruits, and has a sweet sour finish on the back end. Overall I was expecting more from this beer. Considering the hype around it I found it did not live up to the hype. Its a solid brew, just not worth the ratings it gets here. And I wasn't the only one with those sentiments."
"Overall: Solid, and excited to have the privilege to try it on tap for $5."
"batch 001. Hazy amber pour with a nice sized white head. Silage and earth aroma. Flavor was silage, dust, grass, earth, stomach acid, lemon, oak, and orange peel. Tart dry finish with the sourness coming through but not overpowering the beer. Very nice."
"The 2007 batch has noticeably declined since I last tried it. I laughed at the thought before we opened the batches side by side, but it truly is the case. The 2008 is clearly the better of the two at this point in time."
"Really unique in my experience. Thanks to Chad for purchasing and sharing this."
"Really glad I got to see what all the talk is about!"
"Rating #1,300, I will admit that I have enjoyed the first batch a lot more than the second, it was more aggressively sour while the other batch was more subtle and mild, still mouth puckering though, I wish this brew was not only available at one place in the world because I would drink it all the time if that was not the case, this is worth all the hype indeed, this is truly one of the best sours I have ever had and probably will ever have, hopefully Tomme brews this for Toronado in the upcoming years because it is well worth the seven hour drive up to San Francisco to buy some, this brew is a masterpiece, cannot recommend this enough"
"The nose is very nice. Mildly melony, moderately lemony, moderate funk, earthy, loam-like, complex and very well structured. Makes me think of a real gueuze in its delicacy. The palate opens mellow, complex, funky, earthy, lemony. Very, very nice. 4.5/4.5/4.5"
"D - Drinkability is very good. The strong flavors and overall complexity just keeps you coming back for sip after sip. This one goes down surprisingly easy. Lost Abbey has a winner with the Cable Car. It would be nice to see this one become more available in the future."
"Overall, this was an incredible beer!"
"After having landed this white whale I'm not certain I'd give up as much as I did again - however it was still worth it to try this rarity. I'm wondering how different this is from the first batch, as the rumor has it that the original recipe was never recorded and batch 2 is a ""re-creation"". This is a superb wild ale, it just had the misfortune of following up the sublime Deviation and paled a little in comparison. If our sour lineup was analogous to the LotR trilogy, this would be The Two Towers."
"D - One of the better Wild Ales I've had thus far. Big thanks to akorsak for pulling out this 750ml before I had to leave his tasting on Saturday afternoon. Great stuff!"
"D- Tasty sour, not sure I fully understood it in my 6 oz sample to be able to rank it relative to other great sours I've had, but it was a good beer."
"Just crazy stupid that this thing cost $50 at Toronado, though. But I was willing to split with my friends once in order to give it a try."
"Like a wedding video, I'm purposely avoiding documentation on this beer because I want it to live in my memory as I remember it - a special beer that rewards beer exploration."
"Oh, and for the fella that hooked up me, pwoods, Ftownthrowdown and yetiman420 - THANK YOU (you know who you are!)!!! You can't get a much better gift for a BA friend's review milestone..."
"Cheers!"
"D: Extraordinarily drinkable. I could drink this all day every day. The tartness and sourness doesn't linger too strong or long. Very good. Yet again, many thanks to you, Shane. You really made my day and you better watch your back when it's your turn to be given a milestone beer! And a million thanks to the one that traded this to Shane ;)"
"I had set the bar extremely high for this one, so I suppose a letdown was inevitable. A killer sour beer, but not head-over-shoulders better than other similar sours from LA or RR. If it must be checked off your ""to try"" list, by all means seek it out. If not, stick to the easier to find sours."
"8/4/9/5/18 (4.4/5)"
"A rare beer that lives up to its reputation. Pours hazy gold with an oily white ring. Lovely perfume nose, sour mash, brett, and butter. Quite sour up front with a rhubarb flavor. The sour slowly turns into a buttery dinner roll. Tannins and oak along with a bit of cheese show up, too. Very acidic at first, but mellows into a nicely vinuous beer."
"drinkability is great. while the bigger body and solid malty base were unexpected, they really helped hold it together. a great balance between the funk, sourness, and malt. top notch stuff. if only i had more!"
"Fairly clear orange/peach colour, turned cloudy once the dregs were poured. It had a thin, whitish cap that produced thick and spotty lacing. Sharp aroma, lots of tart and vinegar character. Sort of earthy with some funk, leather and lemon zest, fruit tarts even. Very smooth. Big fruity tartness in the flavour, earthy raspberry seeds, leather, a bit juicy. It did have a solid malt base, caramel and bread, but this was really there just to provide balance for the craziness. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation, just a bit of dryness. Delicious. Very smooth and balanced, highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy pale golden yellow, thick white head forms, drops a bunch of lace spots on the glass, settles to a medium sized ring, looks nice. Smell is great, very acidic, charred wood, vinegar, lemon juice, fruit, very funk, leathery, alcohol, mangoes, acidity burns the nose a bit. Taste is nice too, sour fruit up front, vinegar, wood, sour mangoes, honey/caramely malt, bread, very acidic funkiness in the finish, very sour. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very nice, burns going down, very acidic stuff. Great sour, nice woody character, Lost Abbey can do no wrong. Thanks Russ!"
"D- It seems ridiculous to rate the drinkablility of this beer as no one will ever have the opportunity to try it as a session beer."
"Golden and cloudy, with a bit of head that fades to a thin whispy layer. Smells pretty sour, without too much barnyard funk, and with a little peach and green apple. Taste is very sour at the start, but fades to a complex and fruity finish. Carbonation is well balanced and does not detract from the beer, and it goes down smoothly. I'm lucky to have tried this after never really thinking I'd even see one, and I wish there were a chance of me tasting it again."
"Notes from and tasted on 10/11/07."
"Thanks to cloudskipper for this Batch 2 bottle. Shared with bgramer last night. Pours bubbly hazy yellow with a small layer of foam on top. Aroma begins with green apples, lemon and barnyard; pineapple, wood, light banana, cobweb; musty and more funky as it warmed up. Flavor was lots of green apple, tart grapes, lemon, subtle funk at beginning; slight oaky tannins, banana, and a slight alcohol bite as it warmed; slight corn in after taste. As it got completely to room temp it was like juicy ripe pineapple and got more sweet overall. It coats the mouth with tingly bubbles and leaves a lasting impression on the palate. I absolutely loved this one; it had so many layers and subtle flavors/smells."
"On tap at Toronado in August. This is a pretty tasty sour beer. I was very impressed. Hazy golden color with solid white head. Taste is crisp and tart, fruity, oaky, and sour. Funk is certainly present, but not excessive, which I appreciated. Considering the style, which I generally can't drink too much of, I was very impressed with this, and look forward to opening up the bottle I also purchased on Toronado's 21st anniversary night."
"I will say I did feel that I was a bit let down. It was good but it by no means blew me away. This may be a beer that is real over hyped IMHO. I can think of 4-5 Belgian Geuze that I would grab before this one that are much cheaper and readily available. Maybe this would improve with age??"
"Had this at Port Night at Toronado the week after their 21st anniversary party. This is batch #2, the 2008 one. I had a couple. Pours a totally opaque golden with almost no head and some spotty lacing. Carbonation level was fine, though. perhaps somewhat on the soft side but entirely within a normal range. The aromas are fairly light, nut a light funkinesss comes through as a does a clean sourness and a tang of brine. The taste is much more impressive and oddly addictive. There is a delicious savory component to the beer that is hard to place, but includes a tangy saltiness that really blends well with the funkiness and sour. It reminds me slightly of sprinkling salt on crab apples when I was a kid to make the sour and tannic flavors more palatable. Their is a nice soft funkiness up-front and some mellow sourness throughout. There is a bit off butterscotch here as well and a nice jolt of tannins in the finish. Complex, intriguing, and delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly tannic. I really enjoyed this on tap, but haven't tried it from a bottle yet."
"My second pour of this is a touch more yeasty, which seems to soften the tartness a bit and also adds some raw, fermented dough notes (though only just a touch) as well as enhancing a cooked bread like character (sour dough to be sure though). I easily polish off this 750ml bottle, though there is enough acidity to make my empty stomach feel a bit rumbly. Worthy of the hype that I built up in my mind? I don't know, but it is definitely worth the hype to try it. It could use a touch more carbonation as a beer like this could always use a lively carbonation in my book."
"Notes: Drank far too many of these on tap at Toronado's 21st anniversary party. Great stuff."
"Split a bottle with Overlord. Poured a cloudy yellow, with a fairly good white head. Smelled of sour fruit, funky horse manure and yeast. Taste was a complex balance of sour and funky, funky yeast. A truly great beer, that unfortunately is hard to get."
"Bottle sampled at Lost Abbey for RBSG. Pours hazy gold with visible sediment. Head is modest and watery. Aroma is very tart with red and dark fruits, oak, and spicy sweetbread. Epic complexity. Flavors of pie spices, yeast, lemons, vanilla, apple brandy, and some funky must. Palate is dry even without a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is very good considering the tartness."
"**Tried batch two of this. Seemed like more funk/oak, less complexity. I think the first batch was much better, and given that Tomme informed me (IIRC) that the original recipe was not retained, I can't help but think the second batch was an approximation."
"Good to see that batch 2 is holding up fine and could age a bit longer, I will keep my bottle for as long as I can and see what happens."
"D: I almost passed out when Carl pulled this one out of his cooler. It is easily one of the most drinkable sour ales that you'll come across."
"Golden. with a small white head, minimal, but nice lacing. Aromas are super funky sour barnyard like beatification on crack. Super sour almost bile like with a wonderful wild and wiley yeast portfolio. Light, buttery, and wine like. Not unlike a smooth cantillon gueuze. Probably the best gueuze like wild ale ever produced by an American brewer."
"Drinkability: A very fine beer. I'm quite pleased I had the chance to try this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, full of candy orange, funk, with a dryness covering the palate with citrusy zest."
"Drinkability: This beer certainly lived up to all the hype that surrounds it. I feel lucky to have quaffed it with other knowledgable advocates of beer. If you are a fan of sours, this is your nirvana. Seek it out at all costs and please share some with me. A bombshell of a beer. While I am hesitant to give this beer all fives, I do not think there are others out there that will match its complexity and well rounded aromas/flavors/mouthfeels. Each area is like a yin/yang of sour/sweet, sour/soft, fruity/spicy which is more than can be said for other beers that can present themselves as superb one dimensional beers, but not all encompassing. I would consume this beer with any meal and feel confident that it would pair well. I'm eager to try it again. I want the remaining 99 bottles."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- Damn I hope they decide to bottle this. Probably the winner of the night for me. One of the best sour beers I have ever had."
"On draft at Toronados B-day - color of hazy mango, with a thin eggshell colored head - nose of apricots, sourness, cobwebs, slight sweetness, and dry taste of apricots, sour, tart cherries, and slight cobwebs - body is medium, dry, and with medium to high carbonation  aftertaste of dried apricots, tart, dry, and gummy"
