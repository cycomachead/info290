"I never really enjoyed this, just a mess.  Trying it again just confirms that it is pretty poorly made.  No definition, and probably not something I am coming back to again any time soon."

"Drinkable but not truly memorable. The flavors never quite meld and the sour nature becomes too acetic as it warms. Maybe a bit more time or a more nuanced blend."
"Sour stouts are very hit or miss. This has a huge amount of what generally makes Jester King beers great, like their intense funk and yeasty flavors. Overall, they somewhat clash with the burnt malt profile. If you're a fan of the style, this may be worth seeking out."

"this one really took me by surprise. expecting an enormous oak heavy full bodied wild stout, akin to something like tart of darkness, i was totally wrong. its so light in body, not bitter at all from the roast, minimal viscosity, and really pretty clean finishing, borderline refreshing for what it is, and totally different than other wild stouts. might even be a stretch to call it that. dark in color with an average head, i am taken aback by its runny texture, not rich or syrupy at all. the nose shows lemony lacto pretty intensely, but also notes of brett, oak, vanilla and bourbon. the barrel has influenced this quite a bit. lemony citrus all through the taste, and less roasted character than i am used to in a stout, more of a dry cocoa thing, not quite as bitter, but definitely dark. i may have enjoyed black metal more, the bourbon barrel, while adding a ton of flavor, i dont think all the way jives with the sourness. the sweet vanilla seems to be fighting the bacteria cultures, and never really resolves itself. complicated set of flavors on this one, and i like it a lot, very different from anything else out there. more carbonation would be helpful, but maybe then it would even be too light. curious to see how this one evolves in the cellar over time."

"Served in Jester King stemware (thanks Michael). The beer is a near black shade with an oily beige head. The aroma is quite interesting. Dark fruits, plum, brett, oak, sour cherry, rye bread. Intense sour with an overly ripe sour cherry flavor. Lactic mouthfeel with a puckering finish. Roast and stout character is overwhelmed by the wild ale component. That said, I don't mind the imbalance that much. Intriguing and interesting. A nice sipper."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a large dark brown foamy head with light retention Aroma of sour tart notes with light roasted malt notes that are also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by tart and sour notes with light acidic notes and some light dry roasted malt with light vinous notes. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Pretty enjoyable even though soured stout are not something I look for on a regular basis."

"O - exactly what you would think and like nothing else out there."

"Overall a great sour stout - interesting and complex."

"Really loving this beer. All the awesomeness o a sour with lots of chocolate and dark roast."

"O- one of the most unique beers I've had, amazing balance between stout and sour, very smooth texture, tart and roasty. Tons of complex flavors. This is a little over a year old so I'd be curious what it would taste like fresh. Wish I would get another bottle."

"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Batch 1, bottled in Fall 2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, red wine, dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, toast, oak, clove, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, oak, and acidic yeast ester flavors; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, red wine, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, oak, clove, hay, straw, vinegar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, oak, clove, vinegar, straw, hay, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of roasted malt, oak, and acidic yeast ester flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly acidic/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome sour imperial stout. All around great balance and complexity of roasted malt, oak, and lactic yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Very pleasant and enjoyable beer. It's definitely an interesting take on stout. Even if it weren't sour and had that extra level of complexity and funk, it would be an incredible beer. Well worth a trip to Austin or bottle trade."
"0 - really quite impressed with this one - a beautiful marriage between two seemingly polar opposites. would have again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this incredibly complex and tangy stout. The amount of control that must have been needed to brew this beer: letting the tangy and slightly lacto flavors out, but not overpowering the chocolatey, roasty stout notes. This beer is more art. And I would gladly have this again."

"O- This is a very intense sour stout. It has all of the hallmarks of a big sour, but without any vinous notes or fruitiness that usually goes with it for balance. The stout notes are dry and bitter, and make this a one-note beer... Thankfully that one bitter/sour note is very well done."
""
""
""
"Black beer with a thin tan head. Smells of funk, roast, coffee, acid. Taste is pretty sour up front. Funk comes out in the middle with some stout-y flavors. Typical charred, roasty coffee-like flavors aren't as strong as in most stouts. I get more tobacco and leather with cocoa powder than anything in terms of the malts. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is moderate in body with prickly, tiny bubbles. If ever there was an 8.2% stout made for drinking outside on a hot hill country day, this is it."

"Tart and Tart and sweet in all the right places makes for nice, unique drinking."

"Had this sitting in my fridge for a while time to crack it as I love the brewery,label and style and it pours a black as night hue with no moon out its black with a two finger chocolate creamy head and clingy attractive lacing everywhere,the smell is Brett,red wine,oak,bourbon with cola and sour snake lollies,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of red wine,sweet bourbon,funky Brett,the slightest touch of dark chocolate,a nice hit of oak mid taste and finished off with a sour funkiness and overall it's amazing how much Brett and barrel ageing can change and overtake a brew but luckily enough I love my sours and reminds me of some Flemish red ales or brown bruins and yeah like most of their range I'd revisit it cheers."

"Enjoyed from a jester king snifter. bottle was explosive and a gusher shortly after open. beer poured deep black with massive fizzy tan head that fizzed away relatively quick. smell is sour berries. Taste is nice tart berry. Soft but subtle prickle in the mouth. Really nice sour. A bit fizzy, but fairly enjoyable. Not overly sour. Kind of like the purple sweet tart. Cheers"

"Overall. Very nice stuff. For some reason, a sour stout never sounds appealing but this is a fine beer. Great flavours that work well together."
"Mouthfeel remains sour throughout, you can start to think they flash burned the barrel, the smallest smoke contingent gets in there. If I had a bunch of these, this would be a good sour to take camping I'm thinking."
"O - This was certainly different. Loads of sour cherries and lactic acid dumped on top of an innocent stout. The barrel aging is subtle but the bacteria really steals the show here. I feel a charred heartburn coming on but it was damn worth it."
""
"Overall great beer."
"Overall - Decent for a sour stout. Not a great deal can be done with a sour stout, I think."
""
""
"I can't do this brew justice with just my meager description. I wasn't really a sour beer lover until I visited Jester King but they have won me over. Somehow they have managed to bring together two completely different types of beer and have done it superbly well. The price and availability (I was even told by employees they aren't making this brew anymore!) keeps this from being something I can try regularly but if you see this on the shelves get as many bottles as you can."

"O – This beer is fantastically different from anything that I’ve ever had before. It has elements of a good stout but also has great sour aromas and flavors. I never would have thought that a sour stout would be good, but Jester King has proven me very, very wrong. This is a delicious beer and one that I’m extremely glad that I got to try."

"Shared with my doppelganger on his wedding day prior to getting ready for the festivities! Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was compromised of sweet malt, roasted malt, fruit, earth, sour, funk, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, sour, tart, funk, roasted malt, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The tart and sour twist on this one was actually quite nice on the base brew. This made it quite drinkable and enjoyable throughout the glass. Wish this were readily available in my area so I could crush this daily! Definitely worth your time!"
""
""
"O - Overall this was a good beer with nice cross platform. Aspects. Solid and drinkable glad I shared it."
""
""
""
"M - thick, rich and drinkable"
""
""
"Overall, I'd say this beer is for the adventurous and the enthusiastic. Intimidating, unique, and memorable."
"Overall: It's an odd, rarely seen type of brew even in the vast world of craft beer, but this is just insanely refreshing and light. Dangerously drinkable for an 8.2% ABV. I paired this with a lemon bundt cake with icing, and the duo is an absolute dynamic!"
""
"Overall- Well, I'm impressed. I've got mixed feelings about JK, and some of their more experimental offerings (such as the one-off mash-ups they offer on tour days) are just a hot mess. This, however, is spot-on. None of the sometimes observed (what I would consider) ""undesirable"" wild characteristics (dirty feet, horse sweat, asparagus, etc.) are evident. The slightly sweet and well-rounded stout flavors blend perfectly with the not-quite puckery sourness and produce something both unique and delicious. Bravo. I'd like to see more like this. Absolutely, absolutely worth trying. Highly recommended."

"O: I was super curious to try this because of previous reviews comparing it to CD4. It is similar in that is a dark sour but is also clearly different at the same time in that funk metal sticks true to its stout by nature. I'm unaware of the blend of base beers of CD4 but I know it wasn't as chocolaty. This defiantly blows tart of darkness out of the water. That's for sure. I'd like to try it again in a few months to see how it tartens up."
""

"Pours black and murky. Just a sliver of dark brown around the edges of the glass. Little head. Just a thin film of brown bubbles of various sizes, and even that disappeared fairly quickly. I've seen pictures of this beer with a lot more head, so I assume that my bottle is just a bit low on carbonation. I really don't care about appearance nor expect perfect consistency from sours, so it doesn't bother me at all. The aroma has lots of fruit and some underlying stout character. I'm getting a lot of blackberries and red wine. There's a good dose of oak in there. Underneath that fruity sourness, there's chocolate, a little caramel and mild roast. Very pleasant mix of chocolate and fruit. The flavors are well composed and seem much more intentional than probably any other sour stout that I've tried. Taste is similar to aroma. Primary flavors are chocolate, sour, tannic oak, blackberries and red wine. Fairly tart, particularly in the finish. Some cocoa sweetness, but the oak provides a drying tannic bite. Nice lingering red wine and chocolate aftertaste. Carbonation is relatively low, but that might just be my bottle, in part. Very good sour stout. Probably the best I've had. I haven't been a big fan of many sour stouts, but this is an excellent beer. Jester King continues to impress."
"O - Jester King calls this a Sour Barrel Aged Stout - if that is really the case, this would be the weirdest beer I have ever had. I certainly agree with BeerAdvocate, this fits more of the American Wild Ale style. Regardless, excellent sour love the Brettanomyces . Tart level is 6/10. Roast level blends in really well. At 16.99 its a tough beer to 'highly' recommend. But the monetary value eliminated - it is certainly very good and very unique."
"O:this one of the most interesting beer I have ever tried it is a sour upfront with a stout finish the transition is clean and works well I am really surprised but it is a mash of my two favorite styles. My first jk beer and i will be back. Not my favorite beer ever but this is 100% worth a try just for the experience."
""
"Wow - this is extremely complex, flavorful, sour, and easy to drink. Has more sour characteristics than stout characteristics, but that's OK because it was very well crafted."
""
"D - Great sour stout. Great overall balance and mouthfeel."

"Overall this reminds me a lot of the Melange No 1 flavor profile, albeit much lighter and more drinkable. The savory, roasty flavors throw off the flavors for me a little. I like but I don't love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very well done beer. Body is what makes this a nice stout, but qualities otherwise make this more of a black saison. I'd say this and CD4 are nearly interchangeable, albeit for the mouthfeel."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with dark roasted malt, dark fruit, wood, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with only a mild sourness and more emphasis on the stout flavors. There is a mild amount of roasty and woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but the flavors don't match up in my opinion."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown color with a layer of creamy off white head. Lots of sour notes in the smell, but there is a strong chocolate component as well. Just a touch of vinegar. The taste is quite sour but not at all abrasive. Lots of sour vinegar notes but not particularly funky. The finish is tart with a mild smoke notes. Everything works well together in this beer."
""
"O - Tart and dark cherry, strong wood lingers for a bit."
""
"Served with a nice tan head that settles to a ring. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is tart, roast, fruit. Flavor's largely tart with only a bare suggestion of stout. Body is a little on the thin side and again little like a stout. Finish is like flavor, on the short side, and I'm not so much a fan."

"D: I will have no problem putting down this 750ml by my self in not a whole lot of time, actually, I’m going to have to pace myself to enjoy it because I could only find 3 bottles of this, and the other two are going to age for a while before I dig into it again. Fine job, Jester King, fine job indeed."
""
""
""
"I noticed after this beer had been out for a while and warmed up the bitterness totally dropped off and it was much more like the first time I had it. Much more smooth and tart. Very nice. The next bottle I drink ill let it warm up a bit."
""
"Overall this was odd and very delicious. Will definitely buy again if I can find it."
"O- Excellent! Think chocolate covered cherries."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. It is nice to see someone souring a beer other than a belgian gold."
"The beer itself is black, a definite stout. I got an instant sour berry smell followed by some oak and slight chocolate. Very pleasing. Taste is very tart, yet a good malt and coffee finish which is very well balanced and very very good. This is surprisingly well balanced for such a mixture of styles. I had never had a sour imperial stout before but I can't imagine it being done better."
""
"With very few sour stouts to reflect upon- Funk Metal gives me what's best about oude bruins, but elebated the ""bruin"" part to moderate roast and keeping the ""oude"" part maturely sour and earthen throughout. This is simply a masterpiece of a beer!"
""
"I’ve had most JK offerings and this here is a homerun. Like Eli, they did it."
"O - Very interesting. I could see myself buying this again. If you love sour beers this one will not disappoint."
""
""
"O: Never been a huge fan of sours but this is one sour I can get on board with. The balance between sweet and roasted with sour is superbly executed. So easy to drink and refreshing...my new favorite Jester King beer."
"The flavor is first and foremost a barrel-aged wild ale, and almost a belgian dark ale second. A nice biting acidity greets the tongue but is more funky than sour. Barrels, dark fruit, roast, and vinegar ride the back of the palate with ease. Such a great blend. Body is light and effervescent. Some lingering barrel wood and dryness on the back of the palate is all that keeps the mouthfeel from higher marks--something I didn't notice on tap at the Funk & Sour Fest. Looks like Jester King has found their mojo in a big way after some lackluster releases!"
"O: This my favorite beer created by Jester King. The flavor is just like nothing else that I have tasted and just almost imposible to describe how delicious this is. I am glad that I have bought a few bottles, cant wait to see what it does with some age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This will be a big pleaser for all those JK sour seekers. Definitely not a gateway brew into the master craft that is Jester King, but a very talented brew nonetheless. Just like when an epic band releases a new album, this is one of those pieces that needs to be revisited and revisited and revisited to appreciate every aspect of this beer. On my initial taste, I have to say, well done."

"The beer pours a deep, black color with a tan head - exactly as expected. However, this is where things take a detour from the traditional. The aroma is extremely funky, with some very tart fruit notes and some oak, roasted malt and a little chocolate. The flavor is similar, with a lot of tartness and some vinegar notes, complimented by the expected notes of chocolate, coffee and heavily roasted malts. Surprisingly, all of this works together fairly well. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
