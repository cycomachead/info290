"Outstanding Flem Red with a delicious choice of cherries. Rich, tart with a special robust sour cherry addition. Has a better than average malt backbone and mouth feel as well. This is a special beer for anyone who enjoys Kriek but on the drier more tart side...and definitely for those who like a bigger body Fem Red. Can't recommend enough."

"Dark red color.  Nice cherry flavor.  A little sweet to go with the sour of the straight oude tart(with is a great beer on its own)!  A little red wine vinegar tang in the background.  Aroma is excellent.  Complex with red fruits, some sweet, some sour."

"2013 bottle. Cherry had fallen off a bit, slightly vinegar-y, but as the glass sat exposed the cherry flavor intensified nicely."
""
""
"2013. pour dark reddish brown, murky, some sticky light brown head. smell vinous red wine bordering on vinegar. taste tart cherry, red wine vinegar, oaky, tannins, leather. sour and sweet with candi sugar mixed in with tart fruit, sticky mouthfeel, some carbonation. hard to get through an 8 ounce pour. wanted more fruit, less vinegar, wondering if this would be better fresh."

"Overall (4.5), this is a perfect example of how the proper additives can really kick a good beer to great status. Certainly adding sour cherries to a beer with sour characteristics is nothing new, but The Bruery has definitely added their own stamp to the idea."

"Pours a nice reddish dark beer. Little foam is formed. Aroma is of sour beer, bretts, and a hint of cherries. Taste is almost identical to the regular Oude Tart. I wasn't able to taste the cherries at all. If it comes around I'll give it a try again."

"The beer pours a dull, dark brown highlighted by hues of garnet in the light, a thin fizzling halo of off-white head, and no sediment. The nose has molasses sweetness touched by cherry upfront that's followed by oak, some acetone, and a slightly poopy fart. A similar molasses sweetness washes over the palate in the beer's taste and transitions into subtle tart cherries and modest oak. The beer has a heavy-medium, chewy body with minimal carbonation or alcohol, palate coating and mildly abrasive cherries and oak, and a dry, tannic finish. This beer is big and flavorful, the cherries have faded some, but very drinkable and relatively balanced."

"this is wonderful beer, it really is, but im not sure how much the cherries really add to it. i mean, the original beer has a lot of tart cherry notes in it already, but remains balanced and rather true to the flemish red tradition. this edition actually has cherries in it, and while they get lost a bit in one of the most sour beers ive ever had, they give it a gritty sort of sweetness before the acid attack on the back end. deep ruby red in color with a ton of bubbles, no problems there. the nose is sour, but doesnt show nearly the intensity of it that is about to follow. the cherries add a nice layer to the smell, tart and familiar, but they come through a bit sweeter in the taste at first. nice sour red base on the first sip, but ive oude tart enough to know that its about to get gnarly. the sourness here is perhaps the most of any beer i have ever had, in fact im pretty sure it is, it almost hurts my jaw just smelling it. the flavors are awesome for the first few sips, and i get a nice earthiness that comes along with all the cherry, but after about half a glass i cant really taste it much anymore, certainly not as well, because my taste buds have been basically scorched off my tongue by all the acid. im not complaining, i like that, but i could never take down a bottle of this without help, it would turn my guts inside out for sure. the carbonation is high, which amplifies the sourness to even a higher degree. i love this beer, but i may like the base beer better than the cherry version. it just doesnt really need them."

"Served alongside Oude Tart. Similar appearance to the standard version. Russet to ruby hued with a fizzy beige collar. Lots of sour cherries and oak with ample funk presence. Piquant and intense. Sour cherries take center stage. Puckering finish with a drying oak presence. Medium bodied and palate coating. Delicious."

" The taste is superb, very interesting how it develops with some layered stone fruit tanginess and acidity in the taste with fruit skin and slight balsamic sour woody combination of flavor with light vanilla and alcohol with lasting acidic dry finish. There is a complexity and yet drinkable quality in this unrivaled in many sour ales fruity and unique...I can't say for sure I would want to down a whole bottle to myself, but then again I would"

"Really well balanced sour. The cherries are sweet enough to really balance out the oude tart base, which can be too vinegar sour for me at times. Dark ruby body with a thin tan head. The scent with tart pie cherries, which is very nice. The taste is almost exactly the same. Just enough cherry to give you that tart fruit character, but the base beer still shines. Excellent and an upgrade from the Oude Tart base beer."

"When I thought I had had I true sour beer from The Bruery... THIS comes along. What an intense, fruity, acetic monster of a beer. Definitely never had anything quite like it in the realm of American sour ales, and in spite of its over-the-top intensity, it's got a lot going for it and makes a good sipper throughout. It's not the most practical sour I've had, but the fruit characteristic, as well as the intense oak, is notable in its class. I don't know if I'll ever get to try other fruit infused sours from The Bruery, but I am glad I got to try this."

"O - Very nice sour beer. As much as I enjoy the regular version of Oude Tart, this is a notch above it. Cherries accompany the beer quite well and add some additional complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not sure what the price tag is on this one but I doubt I'd buy it over vintage Rodenbach, I'm glad I tried it for sure but I doubt I'd place it on the top 250 IMO"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was very tasty. The cherry flavor was unmistakeable without being at all artificial, and the rest of the beer was plenty big enough to stand up to the big cherry presence. Good levels of sourness as well. I really enjoyed this one."

"M - Medium body. Exceptionally dry. Light carbonation."
"Oud Tart really does all it says in its name. Yet its acidic cherry flavor dwarfs its more succulent fruit tones; Its lacking savory presence allows the sourness to act much more like a young, green and imature lambic more so than a mature Flanders Red Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most sour, yet complex beers I've ever tasted. The flavors work well here and the cherries add a nice level of complexity that makes this brew one to seek out."
""
"The feel is creamy and smooth with very little carbonated bite. This does give one the feeling it needs to be sipped and not drunk done quickly."

"Appearance is a deep red with nice clarity and not much head. Nose is entirely different than regular oude tart. Tons of cherry skin, dark fruit, lactobacillus, and a bit of oak. The flavor is very sour with tons of tart cherry, oak, berry skin, and tannins. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated. Overall, this is a different beast than the base beer."

"Loved this beer. Tried it next to Sour in the Rye with Kumquats. Two very different styles of sours. Some of the group liked the Sour in the Rye better and some agreed with me and thought this was a better beer. You pull some of the cherry and the wood from the barrel and the nose is very nice. It just seems to be a well balanced sour and I would like to see what happens to this beer with a little age."

"Oude Tart is one of the few Bruery beers I like, but somehow this version didn't really do anything for me. Dark ruddy brown pour with a thin, wispy head; minimal retention and lacing was not surprising. Fairly tart aroma, as would be expected, some earthy funk, notes of phenolic cherry. More of this in the taste, tart, somewhat acetic, earthy, funky, oaky, overripe cherry pulp, leather, cherry cough syrup, with a slightly tea-like herbal quality coming through. Medium body, slightly chewy mouthfeel, with a sour prickle to it. Seemed kind of like an ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" scenario to me, where they took an already decent base beer and went just a little too far. Still good, but I prefer the original."
""
""
"As nice as the nose is, the palate really shines. Plenty sour with a blend of moderate red wine vinegar and plenty of sour cherries, bursting, fresh and unabashedly flavorful. Leathery, tannic and with a touch of tobacco, the contrast here is really nice. Tannic red wine, especially on the mid-palate, is present. Sour on the finish with a fleshy, fruity, juicy sour cherry flavor dominating, there's also a touch of meat, a flavor I've found in more than one oud bruin (I'm not making this up, I swear. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer feels good on the palate. Both the base beer and the fruited version are intense, but this particular batch manages to channel the intensity in ways that make this really work. Recommended."

"Very similar to what I remember of the original Oude Tart with the tasteful addition of tart cherries. Beautifully done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. This brew is outstanding. Nice notes of vinegar and sour cherry notes mixed in with woody funk notes and a nice medium-loght body."
"This is a medium bodied brew with with a modest to lighter level of carbonation. It is quite a nice upgrade from the base brew. The cherry inclusion is very enjoyable but it is quite sharp though and that hinders the overall drinkability a little for me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Oude tart with a nice oaky-cherry finish. Nice."
""
""
""
"O: I think this lived up to my expectations. It has the stock Bruery wild ale flavors and comes together as oude tart with a darker color. The cherry flavors are not overly strong but doesn't add a ton of complexity to the beer. It seems like oude tart with a twist which is a good beer to begin with but not too much of a differentiator really."

"The feel is obvious very acidic, but has a nice body and flavor profile as it rolls over the plate and leaves quite a mark in the aftertaste. Overall a very good brew, super tasty."
""
""
"O - The thoughtful addition of cherries to Oude Tart, an already sour base beer, brings a harmonious congregation of assertive flavors to the table; oak, cherry skin, tobacco, and leather, just to name a few. It's tear-jerking sourness will more than satisfy the cravings of any sour power lover, making it one hell of a beer!"

"darker than regular oude tart. Nice slight head of carbonation that dissipates fairly quickly. The cherries give it a more fruit forward taste and more clean tartness. I love the regular version, but this is definitely a notch above. great beer to drink at cellar temp or warmer"

"2013 Vintage bottle. Pours a VERY dark reddish-brown color...almost like a deep mahogany. Medium, light-tan head. Scent is heavy on the cherries up front. Tart, dark-red, overly ripe cherries with a good amount of oak and vinegar. Sweet cherries as well with a hint of vanilla and more wood. Some funky notes with a lot of sour aromas. As this beer warms, the cherry comes through fantastically. Taste is initially sweet cherry deliciousness, switches quickly to puckering sour. Light vanilla and heavy oak flavors. A bit of red wine vinegar. Puckering. Mouthfeel is full bodied, lip smacking, and puckering. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is fantastic. I enjoy it a bit more than the regular Oude Tart. The cherries shine through very nicely. Glad I stocked up on this one!"

"O: Very drinkable, smells phenomenal, with very good complexity. Definitely an improvement over the regular Oude Tart (which is also solid)."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherries/berries, balsalmic vinegar, and some nice funky aromas. Taste is of sour cherries, vinegar, and earthy and funky flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer and the sour cherries are a great addition to the base beer."

"D: Drinkability is extremely high. I could drink this for days on end. Overall Excellent."
"d - Overall I thought this was a really great beer; pretty on par with the regular Oude Tart, just more focused around cherries. Would love to have this one again and it was one of the best beers at EBF."
"The flavor wasn't quite as complex are integrated as the nose, and it was a tad bit more acid-forward without as much of the underlying cherry, oak, and fruit flavors. Still, quite good. The feel integrated the two acid components quite well and mixed things up really well with the cherries. Overall, a very nice beer that I was thrilled to see on the menu."
"Bottle This Now!"
"Minimal head. The beer is a mahogany color. Tha nose is red fruit. Cherries ( obviously), rasberries, it even smells tart. Taste follows. Super sweet and tart. In fact it is reminiscent of the candy Sweet Tarts. Feel is light with great carbonation. Good Drinkability due to it's refreshing nature. ABV is completely hidden by the mouth puckering sourness of the beer. I like it! Wish it was available in bottles."
"Carbonation is thankfully there to help lighten up the medium bodied beer, soft and delicate bubbles preventing an overly syrupy mouthfeel. Tart but not alcoholic at all. Very easy to drink for how sour it is on the tongue, but it makes me both thirsty for more, and hungry for some food."
"D - I am glad I got a sample of this. It could have used a bit more cherries but it was still pretty good. I hope they end up bottling it at some point. I would love to have a few."
"Will definitely be looking for this one again and again at Bruery events."
"Overall, I can't say this is better than Oude Tart, but I can't say it's worse. They both have their own qualities that I like in them. Prettty drinkable."
"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a murky rust mahagony color with a slight tan head that collars around the glass. Nice tart cherry aroma in the nose along with slight acetone. Light mouthfeel. Well balanced comes to mind as I drink this. It really isn't overly sweet or sour but somewhere in the middle with the sweetness of the cherries being counteracted by the tartness and vice versa. Ends with a lingering tartness. Very drinkable."
"Very pungent cherry and vanilla, strong bretty sourness and acidity, refreshing and refined. Bravo."
"Served from tap into a Bruery sampler imperial pint at the Reserve Society Party. Poured a murky brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and cherries. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, citrus, and very slight cherries. It had a light feel on the palate with med-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The cherries were definitely a nice touch as when compared to the regular version of Oude Tart. If you like sours you will definitely enjoy this one with its well balanced flavors and good aroma to bring you back for more. A definite must try."
"Drink- Superb beer in my opinion. I really enjoyed it along with Choc rain and 57 wild for the day."
"Tastes like sour cherries, unsurprisingly. Cherries are dominant, but there's an acetic and vinous undercurrent that's quite nice. Very enjoyable and balanced, albeit somewhat one-dimensional. There's a touch of sweetness, but this is largely sour. Large quantities could get stomach-churning, but I enjoyed drinking a few small pours."
"This is the best wild ale I've ever had from The Bruery. They really nailed it."
"Poured a dark murky brown with reddish yellow highlights that had a thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was huge on the cherries along with mild vinegar, acidic character, oakiness, and faint citrus notes. The taste was also slammed by the cherries with vinegar, oaky, tart, and acidic accents but did have a touch of citrus that added a little dimension; nice cherry bomb. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet , fruity, slight acidic, but oaky sticky tart finish. It drank real good and was glad that this was left over to try after the reseve society party. Nice beer all around, I honestly hope they can find it in them to bottle this tasty goodness."
"With cherries or without? That is the question. Better yet, drink both versions and you won't have that problem."
"D: Cherries are just a great complement to the already phenomenal Oude Tart, glad I got to try it."
"Overall: Very good, and though I can't say its an improvement upon the original, which was already a great beer, it's certainly very nice in its own way."
"Really a superlative beer."
"D: Probably the best beer of the event/afternoon. The addition of cherries seemed like a natural addition to this beer, and they certainly were."
