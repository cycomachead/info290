4.6,3.1,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Bottle date 06/18/2014, aged about 10 months in bottle. Taken out of fridge and allowed to warm up.  Poor a bright golden colour with lots of visible carbonation. Fruity smell, and dry fruity taste. Not too sour. Surprisingly carbonation seems to die down as warm up and don't get much drinking. Great beer, would love to get more of these.","Corson","Monday at 05:34 PM"

Champagne-like mouthfeel, with flavours of lemon curd, brioche, yogurt and green apple butter. Refreshing acidity that lingers for minutes. Complex, but so damn elegant. Perfect.

Malts and hops play an important role, as they prevent the beer from becoming too sweet and fizzy. The subtle musty and earthy additions do the same, convincing me this is still beer. Finishes quite refreshing with a faint lemon fruitiness and an almost bitter, punching, dry sourness. This is incredibly complex and very convincing.","aleigator","Dec 12, 2014"

Pours a hazy golden orange with a white sudsy head that dissipates quickly into a frothy retention cap that sticks around throughout and leaves some lacing. Its a lovely beer to look at. Lemon on the nose, with hints of oak and white wine grapes. Very light and crisp aroma. Tart and puckering on the front of the palate, with notes of lemon, oak, and sweet grape. Finishes extremely dry with little to no lingering aftertaste. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, a supremely well crafted barrel aged wild ale. Well balanced, complex, and extremely drinkable!","JohnG190","Jul 30, 2014"

The flavor was really good, but was a bit one-dimensional (I'm thinking of it compared to a Pliny the Elder that was consumed last night).

It mostly depends on what flavor profile you are in the mood for, as those 3 are all fairly different, so its not an entirely fair comparison.","MCImes","Jan 02, 2014"

The taste is incredible. You can taste the Chardonnay and the citrus with a strong but pleasant sourness. One of the best balanced sours I've had. This beer is really carbonated and the drinkability is on the same level as Champagne. An excellent beer.","mc4z","Dec 03, 2013"

4.32,-3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, batch 05X1E. Pours lightly cloudy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tart green apple, grape, pear, lemon zest, straw, hay, grass, oak, clove, pepper, white wine, vinegar, leather, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big complexity and great balance of yeast ester and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart green apple, grape, pear, lemon zest, hay, straw, grass, honey, bread, oak, clove, pepper, white wine, vinegar, leather, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, grape, pear, lemon zest, hay, straw, grass, honey, bread, white wine, oak, clove, pepper, leather, vinegar, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding wild ale as expected. Tons of great complexity and well balanced flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

I like sours, but this isn't totally 'there'. it's definitely a unique brew which Russian River just seems to be so capable of producing. now there IS a certain residual 'property' which lingers on the sides of the tongue as it builds up with continued draws... i'm not sure how to classify it, but it IS a 'residual' of some sort. not quite 'chemical'. not completely 'organic'. and not always present. this is certainly one of the great brews to have tasted... I completely bow down to Russian River for the successes... very rich, very pronounced properties. a little more difficult to acquire down here in orange county, and definitely one you need to grab if you ever find it on the shelf. IF you're open to a slightly sour brew... rescued the day!! compared to that Alaska mikkeller, this is heaven!!!!","pkalix","Oct 01, 2013"

Nearly flawless, with the exception of some personal preference towards appearance and mouthfeel. Even still, it gets incredibly high marks there. It's a wonderfully tart and refreshing beer with the most pleasantly subtle oaky chardonnay background. This is a prime example of how to use Brett in a beer. It's vinous and effervescent, and just awesome.","dwagner003","Sep 28, 2013"

Medium carbonation coats the glass with some decent lacing. Smell of white wine, sour apple, cherry, and citrus. Some funk blends with a sweet malt and a touch of alcohol. Taste follows the nose well, sour apple and cherry with some chardonnay. A mild malt base mixes with some alcohol and citrus. Pretty solid feel, crisp with medium sourness, not much face twisting as the rest of the Russian River sour line. Good sticky finish. Over all another quality sour from Russian River, however probably my least favorite of the line so far. Can't wait to see how this ages","lordofstarside","Feb 22, 2013"

The aroma is quite vinous with a sour funky edge. Grapes, lemons, cherries, plums, oranges, tartness, sweaty horses its all in there and it smells great. The first sip pierces my tongue with lactic but smooths out quite quickly. Grapes, candy sugar, brown sugar come up front and provide a great balance against the lemons sour cherries and apricots that come in next. A bit of lactic and funk find its way in there towards the finish but smooth out with a fruity sweetness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet tart mouthfeel. This is a beautiful beer! Wonderfully complex and incredibly drinkable.

It's wonderful that an American brewer is making such unique, distinctive beers, but it's criminal that they aren't distributed more widely. Here in KY, we have to trade for them.

The fancy bottle, complicated process, high price, and perceived exclusivity of Russian River's brews are great marketing but do nothing to enhance the taste of Temptation. The best thing this has going for it is that it's a great thirst quencher in the same vein as a Bavarian hefeweizen. On its own it's just a little one-sided and boring. I'd recommend treating it like wine and having it with food. On the other had, you could always just buy some wine...","MadeInOregon","Apr 04, 2012"

There's so much tart chardonnay it's crossed over from being a beer to being something else. It's as much wine as it is beer, and in many ways it's no more beer than a malternative is. Still, a great drink, but I've penalized the overall rating for the identity crisis.","lurpy1","Apr 02, 2012"

The lacing is noticable and there is a bite of crisp and sharp flavors when sipping this one. It is a sipper unless you were born with an affinity to tartness. The alcohol is well hidden and the there is a heavy infusion of Chardonney from the aging process. I am quite impressed with my first sample from RR wild ale series.","phishgator","Feb 03, 2012"

Color is a pale, slightly hazy amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is very good with sour and yeast on top, followed by oak, malt, wine and citrus. Flavor is not quite as complex with the brightness of the oaked sour malt with citrus; wine is in the background. Body and carbonation are exactly what they're supposed to be. Finish is like flavor, clean, balanced and refreshing. Nice picnic brew or for cooking.","drpimento","Nov 17, 2011"

4.22,-5.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Body is a translucent yellow, though an ever present stream of bubbles obscures some light. About a centimeter of bubbly white head forms. The aroma is of tart fruits (peach, apple, pear, grape), slight funk, and some crisp, floral scents. It tastes of grape, tart apple, peach, and pear, various other fruits, straw, grain, faint yeast, a hint of oak, and white wine. Mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, clean, and finishes a touch dry. Overall, a great sour that is easy drinking; I could happily have one daily.","eclipse54","Nov 06, 2011"
4.42,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer is a bright yellow with a hint of yeast haze and a very patchy ring of white foam. The beer smells very good, very much like 3F gueuze, with a hint of crush granny smith apples, juiced lemons, and a layer of musty funk. The beer tastes very similar to the aroma, with a nice tangy lemon upfront, a bitter tannic oak in the middle that is almost minty and numbing, the finish is juicy like apple rind. The alcohol is really well hidden and though the slightly lower than expected carbonation knocks it down a notch. Overall this is very good, almost as good a 3F Oude Gueuze, but not quite. It's nice the RR or any American brewer/blender can make a beer this good. I wonder if more time in the barrel would drastically improve this beer since it is conditioned with brett and bugs.","Soonami","Nov 02, 2011"

The lemony fine dining funk that I currently get in this beer is as refined as it comes. I'd be more than happy to grab a case of batch 6 and see how it goes, but at the same time I'd be tempted to drink this as is every night that passes. Simply an absolutely fantastic drinking beer. This is worth every penny, I want a 750 or two to compliment some future cases of 375s. Give batch 6 a try and see if you don't feel the same.

It really does smell like a tart chardonnay. It's very impressive. The flavors too are very acidic, lactic, and very heavy on vinous and slightly buttery California chardonnay. This beer puts ""Russian River"" in perspective, being in prime wine country this emulates the local wines and is really quite transcendiary. It is impressive through and through.

Strong sour notes, almost mimicking lemon rind, but more bitter and sour than that. Musty, funky, and oaky tannins are present with some wood notes, mildly astringent but sour the whole way through.

Taste brought out a lemon component that I didn't get in the nose. The white wine presence was more noticeable in the taste than the smell. The tartness was relatively light in the taste, but pleasantly refreshing. Finish had a slight bitterness to it. Mouthfeel was light with a high amount of carbonation and a dry finish.

The smell of the beer smells a lot like Chardonnay with a bit of wild yeast coming through in the back end. The taste of the beer is actually pretty good. I was surprised that it really didn't give off much of a pucker factor after each sip. The flavors of white wine, tart grapes and some wheat are what I'm picking up here. The mouthfeel was pretty good, almost refreshing. Overall I was very impressed by this beer. The flavors and the other elements that it brings to the table were really good.

4.25,-4.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice goldenrod yellow, and it is very well carbonated. But of course, never had any carbonation with Russian River brews. The nose is an immediate waft of Brett which is always a pleasant scent to my nose at least. A little bit of that French Oak barrel comes out in the nose too. The initial taste is dry and sourness all at once. Upon more sips a nice oakiness comes out and melds nicely with the Brett tones. I know the beer is only 7.5% but there is absolutely no alcohol bite or any semblance that this actually has alcohol in it. I might be crazy but the after taste is just straight grapes to me, like I have been drinking a wine almost. The mouthfeel on this beer is good, but leaves the mouth a little dry like a tannic wine.

Lots of fruit, both sweet and tart, pears and peaches, apricots, and apple peels, wine-soaked oak, with touches of vanilla bean and lemon, toasted grains hint to a solid malt base.

Crystal clear beer with plenty of bubbles rushing to the surface. Very white-wine like aroma; white grapes, french oak, apples/pears. Brett is prevalent in this beer with a medicinal/barnyard funk. Very faint acidic sourness in the nose too. Flavor follows the nose. Pale malt backbone, honey sweetness, grapes, oak, vanilla, slightly salty (olives?), and finishes with a dry medicinal/barnyard funk. Sourness is more mellow in this beer than the other RR sours, but this still creates a nice mouth-watering astringency. Bubbly on the tongue with a light body.

Taste is sour upfront, some bitterness with a moderatly sweet fruity finish for the style. It's all about balance. Grapefruit skin and lemon rind, white wine and woody flavors. Awesome beer, I was tempted to give it a perfect score in every class because its beautiful balance and drinkability. The only flaw would be its sweetness.

I must say I didn't notice as much wine barrel contribution when I tasted this on tap, but it is pretty apparent in the bottle -not sure how long this one was cellaring. The slight tropical element is a nice addition to the vinous qualities in this with slight spiciness from the yeast and hops. The hop presence is more assertive than in other wild ales which I enjoy -it is just enough to add to the fruitiness from the bacteria and not too much. I found myself really holding this in my mouth longer to pick out more of the flavor until a semi dry finish as it is swallowed. This is truly great - A beer I could never get tired of -the hop, barrel and blend of wild yeast and bacteria are all playing and major part w/ lots of strong flavors, yet it is pretty easy to forget the abv and drink it like its juice.

4.55,2,3.5,3.5,5,5,5,"Temptation pours a burnt yellow orange at first glance, but when held up to light it's more of a lemon yellow. At its peak, there's two fingers worth of a frothy white crown. Retention is very good, but the lacing is spotty. The aroma starts out being dominated by the aroma of chardonnay, with just a hint of funk in the background though. As the beer warms though, the balance between the two evens out some. Still, I was looking for a little bit more in the way of complexity. Whatever I didn't find in the nose made itself apparent as I sipped on Temptation. The taste of sweet apples shows up first, before a brief, subtle flash of clove reminds me that brett and other wild critters weren't the only things used to ferment this beer. The back half of the beer is all chardonnay and sour/funk, and the two are almost entirely intertwined. I'm not always a fan of chardonnay, I find it to be a bit harsh in general, but the flavor here has a bit more of a soft edge. The mouthfeel is absolutely luxuriant. For a beer so dry it's not thin at all, and the carbonation is picture perfect, very expressive without treading into fizziness. I honestly can't think of a single thing I'd change about it. With an out of this world flavor and mouthfeel, and a restrained sour/funky contribution from a relatively fresh bottle makes this an incredible easy drinker.","axeman9182","Nov 21, 2010"
4.15,-7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Nice Wild Ale. The oak isn't apparent until the finish and the carbonation is just a bit more than I prefer. The mouthful is nice and not to thin or viscous. Its almost like a Saison with Brett added. I get some peach and white grapes that I'm guessing, comes from the yeast. I think this is an excellent wild ale to introduce people to Brett C. Its too funky and is a good representation of the style. I dont think this is one is too complex but all in all a solid offering from Russian River.","AndrewNations","Nov 21, 2010"

The nose is full of lemon, hints of oak and cedar, sour grapes and a bit of brett and balances the aromas very nicely letting everything meld together to compliment. The taste is lemony right off the bat. Nice and sour with a little bit of wood and chardonnay flavor and a nice funky brett finish. Honestly, excactly what I would want from a wild ale. Sour and funky but not overpoweringly; just a nice brett and sour balance with other flavors showing their profiles as well.

The brett and pedio are wild this ale is sour puckeringly so with barrel aged effects going on as well. Funky yogurt notes, barrel aged oak, sharp acidic tones this is pure sour ale. Mouthfeel is dry carbonation is effervescent body is in the medium range, I've had some nice sour ales recently this one is a bit rough with barrel aging but it works.

Metallic orange rust color, also clearer than expected, strong bubble storm inside the glass, few actual beads. Raw yeasts and super-sour white grapefruit to lemon citrus set the tone in the nose, matted wet straw, old kindling wood ashes, charcoal, then angular green apple, green grape and pear scents, white pepper and caraway seeds, Full-bodied, in large part due to the carbonation foam which feels like someone emptied a fire extinguisher in your mouth, expands to near dripping out of your mouth. Sour, yet would be much more so were it not for that carbonation, keen edge to the lemon, white grapefruit citrus. However, here more vanillin oak comes through to at least momentarily soften things. Does not have the funk of the nose but no sense trying to avoid the earthen straw, mud and animal hide notes. Boozy, even with the relatively low alcohol percentage, pear, pineapple, white grape, apple citrus, were it a wine it would likely need malolactic fermentation. Violets, anise and more caraway, at times recalls dried Indian spices. Its tight grip on your palate extends the finish texturally way past the flavors.

Very small amount of oak comes through with white wine. Taste of tropical fruit, white n green grapes, such an amazing balance of flavors! The chardonay oak is apparent, first time I've had a beer aged in a white wine barrel pulled off so well. The beer is tart and sour, but not as bracingly sour as I had expected. I imagine this is due to the quality and age of the barrels aged in imparting a smoother quality then more raw oak. This beer straight up fills your mouth with flavor on all sides.

4.48,0.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Bright, golden yellow with a small white head. Smells very citrusy, especially lemon, some oak, white wine and a little funky yeastiness. Tastes very unique. I don't think I've ever wanted to describe a beer that spent any time being barrel aged as bright, crisp, or refreshing but all of those seem to fit here. Taste is predominantly sour citrusy fruits, with subtle white wine, oak, yeast and funk. Well carbonated lively mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable, very agreeable stuff. Its complexity probably means it should be sipper but I found myself taking large gulps and drinking it pretty quickly. Good thing after stopping at Russian River for lunch my girlfriend could take over driving duties for our road trip as I sober back up and review from my notes on my blackberry.","Shumista","May 11, 2010"

Floral (major rose), banana, pear, bubble gum and funk. A lot going on and it's all good! The taste has a sour barnyard funk with a spicy kick on the swallow. Not as sour as I thought it would be which makes it even more enjoyable. Awesome stuff. Nicely carbonated and a high drinkability though the sourness makes this a sipper.

As with all the RR pint bottled beers it definitely has the crisp smell I've grown accustomed to. From the bottle it smells faintly of not yet ripe green apples, and then once it my glass you can really get that full orchard in the rain kinda smell. Very nice to see the constant stream of bubbles and well as the 1/3 inch of foam that never really goes away. At first taste it did remind me of RR's darker Consecration, which is one of my favorites. I can really taste the granny smith pearesc kinda taste. I do taste a little chardonnay as well. I am very happy to live in the same town as this brewery as I have spent many a night drinking the varieties they offer and this one will be purchased again for sure.","Radiapathy","Apr 22, 2010"

4.6,3.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D - Very nice, this beer combines balance and complexity in a way that one rarely sees in this sort of beer. There is a great deal of fruit from the yeast as well as a strong acidity in the flavor that compliments the fruit and brings out a greater depth of fruit character than I have ever experienced in a beer that doesn't actually have any fruit in it. This acidity is very well balanced by a thick backbone of sweet malt and a finish that is not quite as dry as I would normally expect in a belgian style beer of this strength. It is surprisingly drinkable, both for a wild ale and a beer with this alcohol content. My only complaint is that I don't have much hope of getting another bottle of this beer any time soon.","nickfl","Apr 05, 2010"

4.42,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5," The Temptation 08 poured a clear deep marigold with a creamy white head. The 08 is a shade darker than the 09. The 08 had an incredible nose- chardonnay grapes, oak, fresh green grape juice. It tasted of fresh grapes, lemon peel, oak, chardonnay with a hint of honey. A very pretty beer. The 09 did not have a strong aroma compared to the 08. I had to smell it hard just to get some oak notes out of it. It tasted of citrus, pink grapefruit, honey, and a sour dry finish. It was good, but I hands down enjoyed the 08 better. It was almost like a completely different beer. Get your hands on some if you can.","femALEist","Mar 25, 2010"

The color on this beer is wonderful, a crystal clear golden blond that foams up nicely and leaves a fair amount of lacing. Aroma is absolutely divine. Sour tangy notes from the wild yeast which make Temptation a world class beer float out of the glass and could likely be picked up from across the room. Truly wonderful. Balancing the amount of sour bite that this beer packs with all of the other elements here is a remarkable feat, and Russian River continues to impress. It's smooth and refreshing, while at the same time aggressive and tangy.

It pours a beautiful bright golden yellow with a hefty white head that leaves a substantial amount lacing clinging joyfully all over the glass. Smells of brett, lemon, various citrus and funk, white wine and an oakiness - like that found in chardonnay. I don't even know how else to describe it. It is amazing. Best smelling beer I have had in quite some time. The taste is out of this world as well. It is fairly sour, but not overpowering. Very well balanced. This is how brett should treat a beer. The wine like qualities shine and the oak flavors add nice complexity. The mouth feel is medium and well carbonated. Again, this beer is so great because of its balance.

Mouthfeel is effervescent, but a few swrils of the tulip tones it down while also bringing out more aroma creating an overall more delightful beer in the process. This was great brew, ultra sour at first, but really becomes more developed as it warms. Good stuff, but I still haven't found a golden sour that can live up the greatness of Brute.

As good as this beer will likely become, I can't fully appreciate the nuances of this beer against the strong flavors of chardonnay and brett.

The best Russian River brew I've yet to try, and thus - in my opinion - the best of their wilds (Supplication, Consecration, Beatification being the ones I've tried), this one succeeds not because it is the most sour, or the most funky, or the most <fill in the blank>, and instead excels in the authenticity and quality of what really epitomizes sours in my mind - balance.

Overall this had a great scent and taste with just enough funk but still very clean. It wasn't too overpowering, and the alcohol was well hidden, but this was still definitely a sipping beer.

Nose is citrusy and buttery. Taste consistent with nose, some tartness, some green apple and some residual sweetness.

Taste is dry that fades quickly with little taste on the finish besides oak. The biggest taste is noticed at first sip with lemon and wine notes. I think this needs more time.

The brett character is blends exceptionally well with the rest of the aromas. The flavor is wonderfully dry and oaky. There are a different fruit flavors layered throughout the beer. The best thing, though, is that the flavor stays full and round from the first taste to the finish. The brett, oak and fruit all come together.

Incredibly strong oak character with some musty brett notes. Noticeable bitterness leads to an extremely dry finish. Medium-bodied and very effervescent. Very drinkable for what it is.

Nose is absolutely penetrating as the yeast carries the sour funk like menthol. With first sip you are shown how the yeast really drives this beer. Lemon zest and cherry pits are at the heart of the sour feel that sits fat on the middle of the tongue. The tart feel is not big, it carries noticeable minerals and seems to be mellowed nicely by the oak. A nice orange, grapefruit rind sour feel stays on the back of the tongue and creates the mouthfeel. Very Chardonnay like drinkable.","SPLITGRIN","Jun 16, 2009"

It's very refined and absolutely crammed with depth and character. But, it's not too bold and goes down like a dream. Personally, I believe this one's a little better than Supplication and Beatification. Not much, but enough to distinguish itself. If I could award tenths of points, the flavor would score better than a '4.5.' I've had this bottle for over a year now. I can't imagine the flavor's gotten worse. It's too good.

The smell is aggressive and all about the chardonnay barrel treatment; earthy, very lemony, fruity and tart...way more character than the base blonde. The mouth feel was tangy and effervescent. Full flavored, the tart lemon character and barrel treatment tastes like drinking a chardonnay out right. Too tart for me and with a bit more wine character than i could appreciate at this sitting.

Having had the previous two batchs, the brett is definitely more prounounced each time out. Great stuff","oakbluff","Sep 27, 2008"

4.54,1.8,4,5,5,4,3.5,"Pours a brilliant medium gold color with a tall, bubbly white head of foam that seems ever expanding and long-lasting. Ample carbonation is visible rising up in the glass. A sight to behold. The nose is wonderfully complex and replete with brett character - slightly acidic and quite musty with the obligatory ""horsey"" notes for which these wild strains are famous. Hiding behind the marvelously funky notes are wisps of oak and citrus, making this beer an incredibly intricate and challenging subject. This just from the sight and smell. The palate is not to be outdone, of course. The fine, almost effervescent carbonation delivers a startlingly dry and exceedingly tart experience in the mouth. At the same time earthy, floral and citrusy with notes of dry white wine, wood and tree fruit. Nothing short of incredible. Medium bodied with a full, voluminous mouth feel and bone dry finish. Some residual tartness with hints of oak are left on the palate, but otherwise this beer finishes completely clean - almost astringent - and as tart as they come. The oak, rather than mellowing this beer, has accentuated the subtleties and only served to make the ale more complex than it was already destined to be. In every regard an incredible beer by a master craftsman. Vinnie, you do astounding work. With a tartness that might exclude some, this beer is a wonder in the wild ale classification and a must-drink experience for the senses. One of the very best I've sampled - be it from this country or another. Outstanding.","beerphilosopher","Sep 20, 2008"

Thick columns of cyclone-like carbonation rise and support the bouquet from the etching in a St Feuillien snifter. The nose is straight up sour power, lots of sour funky goodness, Sweet tarts baby. While tasting, the slightly acidic sour twang that first tickled the nose upon smelling bites the tongue gently, the bright carbonation explodes the subtle flavors of mature aged wood, smoke, and a definite, quality, malt presence. Nevertheless, sour dominates, other twangy notes of lemon/lime skin and sour green grapes. The slightest hint of the 7.5 ABV shines through on the finish. The body, begins bright and alive with tiny Champagne-like carbonation bubbles but gathers itself into a nice coating mouthfeel, the only thing that comes to mind is that this beer leaves the same feeling that lemon heads do to the tongue and cheeks, amazing!

The smell is very different, consisting of sour cherries, apples and a hint of lemon. Taste is equivalent to the smell, instantly hitting your palate with sour fruit and yeasty bread. Not a beer I am used to but definitely grows on you after several sips. Mouthfeel is dry with an almost champagne like carbonation and slight alcohol on the finish.

All kinds of complexity in the taste - white grapes, lemon, orange, and some hints of vanilla sweetness in the end. Totally awesome.

The label has a story about the beer. Poured into my Chimay goblet. It has a hazy golden yellow color with just a few bits of yeast floating around. It had a small head that turned into a constant partial film that was fed by a carb geyser. The aroma was amazing. I love sour beers and this had a great sour beer smell. It was heavy on the brett but you could also get a good hit of the oak and some lemon in the back. The taste was also exceptional. Nice and sour with a carb attack on the tongue. Reminds me of Le Terrior from NBB. Mouthfeel is great with good sour bite and carbonation. Overall, I loved this one and highly recommend. Can't wait to try it and some other RR wild ales again.

On the palate, softly sour at first before it works up in intensity and complexity, with highly acidic brett sourness and light, sweet malts vying for attention. Things dry out completely by the finish, which is full of sourness that lingers for a while on the tongue.

Taste starts off with a lime tartness blended with a dirty earth hop flavor. Definite metallic notes linger on the lips from the frothy head that just won't go away. Vanilla like alcohol presence in the aftertaste from the wine barrels with a nice bready malt smoothness. Such a complex flavored brew. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation.

As far as the taste, if you can take the sourness, as I could, this is one of the most complex beers I've ever encountered. Once you look past the sour, there is an interesting blend of German hefe and Belgian Tripel characteristics. In the mouth, the sourness is a bit overbearing, but I'm able to appreciate that it goes with the style. This is certainly a beer that takes some effort to appreciate, but I must say, it's worth the effort.

4.3,-3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"375 ml punted green bottle, corked and caged. Batch 002. I was thinking that I'd wait until the weather was more spring-like to open up my first Russian River ""wild ale," but then I remembered I'm in Buffalo, and that won't be until June...It was sunny for most of the day today, so what the hell. Anyway, served at cellar temperature in a Russian River Barrel Aged Ales stemmed glass, Temptation is a cloudy golden-straw color, with a sudsy dull-white head which is clingy but recedes to a surface film rather quickly. Aromas are on the sharp side, with green apple, musty phenols, and acidic Chardonnay scents standing out the most. A tart ""lambic"" smell is also noticeable -- brettanomyces at work, I imagine. An extremely tart ""lambic"" edge greets the palate at first. This acidic funk greeting is followed by a more variegated citrus blend, with lemon and lime flavors predominating. A very faint biscuity flavor appears both somewhere in the middle and briefly in the aftertaste. Rubbery phenol notes waft in at random throughout mid-sip. Some white wine fruitiness comes through as the beer warms with an initially detectable mineral twang subsiding at the same time. Minimal touches of oak tannins near the finish, which is mouth-puckeringly dry. Light body with a slightly sticky but overall airy and smooth mouthfeel. This is a fascinatingly complex ale, and I'm glad to have the rest of this bottle to finish this evening. However, I think it's more appropriately drunk in weather warmer than today's snow-blanketed 20 degree February business. Would likely pair nicely with a super-stinky cheese.","orfeu","Feb 19, 2007"

4.88,9.4,5,4.5,5,5,5,"375 mL olive brown cork-n-crown bottle. Batch 002, brewed on 6/11/05 with house Belgian and abbey yeasts, unfiltered, and aged for 16 months in French oak chardonnay barrels with saccharo- and brettanomyces. It was bottled on 11/15/06, and conditioned with their house wine yeast and more brettanomyces. It pours a transluscent gold with medium to high carbonation and two inches of white head that settles at an eighth of an inch and leaves sheets of sticky lace. Very nice - it is reminiscent of a well-crafted Belgian. The aroma is also quite Belgian - fruity, oaky, and winey, with the addition of sour and lightly funky overtones. If it were a bit more aromatic it would warrant a five in the category. On the palate there are notes of pale or pilsner malts and green (noble?) hops blended very nicely with a brett sourness and touches of white wine here and there. There are additional notes of grassy/spicy hops, a medium sourness, a mild (but increasing) bitterness, some drying tannins, and oaky/winey notes that increase near the end. So complex and completely delicious. The medium body is drying and lightly numbing, incredibly smooth, and has medium carbonation along with a medium to long finish. Overall an awesome, very drinkable and refreshing beer (a non-stop sipper) that is a testament to the creativity of the American craft beer revolution.","mmmbeer","Feb 12, 2007"

Smells musty and a bit like an old sweet champagne. Also some clementine-like citrus on the nose. Taste starts out thin and orangey and wine-like. A bit like a cyser i had on tap at Bell's in terms of the initial flavor profile. Some sourness that builds as the beer warms. Citrusy astringency. bitterness grows as it warms, which melds well with the orange flavor. some light alcohol flavor is apparant too. thin, effervescent mouthfeel.

Brett funk and a lemon zest edge lead into a sweet and dry white wine-laced middle. Bright and fruity with moderate dryness, the finish has an ample amount of funk, but it does not linger long. The back corners of the mouth instead are grabbed by a refreshing crispness. There is a fair amount of sweetness beneath the surface.

Poured carefully from a long-standing bottle it delivers a clear (I can see my fingerprints through the glass) dark gold body beneath a creamy head of white. The head retention is superb, and it leaves a solid wall of foam around the inside of the glass. The nose is bright with Brettanomyces (mineralish, leathery, acidic, musty, barnyard, ""horseblanket"") , tempered by oak, and sparked with a spritz of lemon. In the mouth it's very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation caresses the tongue with a delicate bristle. Medium bodied. The flavor is as the aroma suggests with a firm bitterness for support and a little more acidity. The label suggests that it picks up wine flavors from the oak barrels and I think that's true, there's a definite white grape flavor there. There are some other fruits in there as well, maybe some apricot; some mildly tart tangerine; a drop of pineapple; and even some grapefruit as well. It finishes with a flick of acidity that receeds to leave a citrus-rind bitterness behind. Remarkably refined and easy to drink for the style.","NeroFiddled","Feb 17, 2006"

Taste is totally incredible with huge amount of farmhouse (there is probably a better word for this but it is the only I can think of right now), sour notes resembling a lambic and Brett, which is reminiscent of Orval. The Chardonnay barrel effect is maybe a bit too accentuated but still very interesting. Also, it might be a bit too acidic for my liking but it is still very much enjoyable. A more balance level of acid and this would have been a perfect score. Now, I just need to get my hand on some more of this.","Phyl21ca","Jan 09, 2006"

Sourness dominates the aroma. The flavor is much less sour than the aroma would allow you to think. Actually, there isn't a ton of flavor in this one. At the beginning there is a small bit of fruitiness and some sour notes along with a large kick of wood, but the flavor quickly disappears.

It's light and refreshing with a kick ass sour finish that's a bit warm on the way down. This is a great drinker.","WesWes","Oct 07, 2005"

Time for Temptation to be bomber-ized, methinks. Anyway, another fabulous beer by Vinnie and the crew at Russian River.","Boilermaker88","Sep 25, 2005"
4.55,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"This beer is very drinkable, but I'm not sure how many bottles I could have in a row. I love lambics, and was pleasently surprised by this my first taste of an American Wild Ale. Very impressive, and I hope to try more of these.","Beervis","Sep 14, 2005"

4.62,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Hazy golden sandy blonde. Head is white, small, lasting. Very vinous nose contains strong farmy and funky notes that seems to multiply the fruit presence. Banana bread soaked in cider and banged around with tart white grapes. Globally very fresh and classy, yet you feel this would survive many years. The palate is delicate, flowery and vibrantly tart in a pineapple way. Fresh fruitiness brings the complexity through the roof. It somehow manages to remain accessible thanks to a striking balance and transcendent ""classiness"". Bretty cobwebs, cidery salty minerals. Satisfying, juicy, yet dry. Firm champaigny carbonation, smooth palate. My new favorite from Vinnie.","Rastacouere","Sep 11, 2005"

4.72,5.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5," Drinkability is limited only by price and availability. Amazing complexity as each sip brings forth a different note. An exceptional sipping experience here. Don't drink this one any colder than cellar temperature. Room temperature brings out all sorts of interesting flavors and aromas. Very playful on the nose and palate. Incredibly well constructed.","merlin48","Sep 11, 2005"

4.23,-5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability and Notes Â– A really interesting beer, but not one that I am overly in love with. The wine like character makes this slow, but enjoyable to drink.

4.64,4,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"RBSG 2005... Poured a hazy orange gold color with a small, white head that left spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of cherries, brett, chardonnay grapes, and faint diactyl.

I nabbed one, price unseen, and the manager had to key it into the register. The 375ml bottle ran $21. Takes it out of the ""I'll have two more"" range.

4.3,-3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On label it says ""Is it wine or is it beer?"" Well, this is the closest tasting to wine beer i've ever had. Chardonnay flavors dominate this beer...but there's more than just that also a sourness..mild compared to some lambic. typical descriptions of malt and hops don't really work here. This one was served chilled and it's so darn drinkable...if it wasn't 8 dollars a bottle i could go through a 6 pack like nothing. maybe one of those 1.5 litter bottles would a fun way to spend a summer evening alone. a very different beer for sure. tastes alot like chardonnay. .. but's it's better :)","pjwilson","Aug 24, 2005"
4.2,-5.8,4,4,4,4,5,"hazy and foamy carbonated apple cider appearance.. some frothy lacing.. poured into a flutelike fischer tasting glass. pleasant barnyard aroma with buttery wood notes and a bready yeast that dulls the beer's potential for unbridled funk. tastes like a mild lambic infused with the chardonnay from the barrels.. love the dryness this imparts. splitting a bottle of this two ways yields too small a sample to get too much out of.. not to mention that when served chilled, this is a refreshing, thirst quenching beer that you just can't put down. alcohol is mild and all that makes a wild ale a sipper is muted here. a pretty excellent brew, not nearly as complex a brew and worthy of the hype as supplication. ill have no problem drinking the remaining bottles of this beer in my closet. will certainly re-review with further notes when i can hog one of these bad boys for myself.","goodbyeohio","Aug 18, 2005"

(almost $12 after shipping) i also have some supplication waiting in the fridge, and that's supposed to be better. it'd almost have to be perfect to be better than temptation. 2 enthusiastic thumbs.","Px2GrafX","Aug 08, 2005"

The taste was very good with definite white wine crisp clean notes with a oak aftertaste - not quite like a beer spritzer. This is very well made with so much depth and complexity but sublte like a good white wine or gueze. Unlike supplication, it should be enjoyed colder. Warming didn't hurt but it didn't help. Also $8.00 at Ledger's.","lou91","Jul 21, 2005"
4.69,5.2,3.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This beer is really quite interesting, Vinnie still has a ways to go, but this has more to do with letting the barrels reach an equilibrioum point than Vinnie at this point. I think that Vinnie has the touch, in perhaps 5 years (if the wee bugs are compliant and amenable), subsequent releases of this should be quite stellar.","Gueuzedude","Jul 14, 2005"

4.85,8.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Another brilliant, brilliant brew from Vinnie and co. Appearance is great, bright golden with a huge fluffy white head that is bubbling over the chalice that this stuff is served in. Aromas are all Belgian funk and refreshingly hoppy/maly Belgian blond ale notes. The chardonnay barrels that this was aged in also impart some lovely light oak, and big fruity white wine grape notes. The mouthfeel is superb, creamy smooth, and unfaulted. Drinkability is absolutely insane. Refreshing and just killer. Damn, I love this stuff. A fantastic, one-of-a-kind brew!","francisweizen","Jun 01, 2005"
