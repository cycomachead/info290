"I found very little kumquat aroma or flavor. Very of dimensional"
"Extremely sour. Wish I had had it side by side with the other Sour in the Rye variations, but as far as I can remember I preferred the Kumquat version. Added a lot more sour with some tropical resiny citrus character. Very nice."

"The feel of this beer gives you the same reaction as eating a warhead candy. It's great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good. Rye gives it some unique characteristics for a sour, and the citrus is a nice improvement to the regular SitR. Worth trying for sure, but no need to go crazy seeking it out."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark golden haze, low carb. Beautiful citrus nose. Thin to medium bodied. Perfect balance of sour and citrusy flavor. None of that vinegar either. I can crush a bomber of this alone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25), the addition of the tiny citrus fruit does marvels for this beer, and makes it quite refreshing and a bit easier to drink more of than the non-fruited SitR. It certainly makes me curious to try more beers that utilize kumquat in the future."

"I had this back to back with Sour in the Rye and it seemed that this was a very different beer. Age and a batch from a different year may have made all the difference but it has a more pink grapefruit like color. The nose was sweet, sour and tart citrus fruit but there was more of a minerally acidic aroma. The flavor was more earthy, minerally and orangier than Sour in the Rye. It felt about the same. Very good beer but I liked the Sour a bit better."
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, clean and utter refreshing, the thirst-stripping sourness leaves the palate dry and only moderately earthy as subtleties of cork, cellar-like must, weathered oak, tobacco and damp soil emerge in aftertaste."

"Bottle shared at the Swamp Head Bottle Drop. Pours slightly murky orange colored with a fluffy white to off white head on top. Beautiful aroma of sour vinegar, tropical fruit, and the light spice I get from the regular SitR. Flavor follows with light sourness that is sweetened up by the semisweet and tart kumquats, clean crisp finish with a lingering fruity flavor left on the palate. My wife, not being a fan of most beers, actually even really enjoyed this one. The fruit balances the sour perfectly here and creates a new beer that retains the beautiful sour flare that I love in the regular version. A little more heft than the regular version, creamy yet crisp, sweet and tart, with medium plus carbonation. I would have this one again and again."
"Interesting use of the kumquats. Bravo."

"Drink- I think this one is the best of the 3 in terms of bottles of SITR. More balanced and layered than the other two and cloyingly sweet or overtly acidic and a drain pour of the last 1/4 bottle as the peach version was. Was very happy I got to tick this one."

"The beer pours a dull darker amber brown topped by a halo of tightly knit, off white head that provides minimal lacing and fades quickly. The nose is potent, with distinct kumquat upfront (spicy, super citrusy) a little caramel sweetness, slightly sour and some funk. The taste is definitely similar to SitR, less sweet, more mature and citrusy, but has a lingering citrus that's far more potent than the regular. It's light-medium bodied, citrusy, sour and dry, acidic, slightly undercarbonated, and definitely drinkable. Tried this side by side with the regular, definitely dig the kumquat citrus addition."

"Hazy, golden brown. Nose is fragrant and pungent like an orange tree orchard. Starts with a tart pucker, opens to bitter kumquat rind and finishes with a sweet juiciness, not that far from a glass of OJ. The fruit is really forward in this. Nice to have a beer aged on Kumquats. Different, but really nice."

"Highly agree with the review about 6 entries down, there is a weird metallic aftertaste to this beer, which throws it off even more..."

"Poured a hazy/murky burnt orange color with a small off-white head that sank to a ringlet. Aroma of kumquats, apricot, citrus, acetic acid and lacto, with some yeasty funk. Lots of tartness/sourness in the taste, citrus mainly, acetic, more of the yeasty funk that was noted in the aroma, sour toasted grains. I never bothered trying the original version of the beer, so I really have no basis of comparison between the two. Medium body, a bit rough in the mouthfeel with a slightly metallic aftertaste. Decent."

"O: Quite sour, but very tasty. Frankly, I don't have any idea what a kumquat tastes like, so I don't know how well that flavor comes through in this beer. But either way, this is good. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"overall much better than original, recommended!"
"Overall- Just a great beer. So approachable but also a bright star among many good sours. Very accessible for a non-beer drinker. Without a doubt, a must try. Even if you don't like sours. It's that good."

"Much has been said about whether the AWA style is a poor man's lambic, but this beer shows that there's a time and a place for a sweet and sour beer. Very nicely done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very well done Bruery. I had only been moderately impressed with your sour offerings before, but this beer was fantastic and hopefully a sign of things to come. One of the better American wild ales I've had."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Dry. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It’s amazing how much fruit flavor comes through in this beer, both on the nose and palate. A nice beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer regular Sour in the Rye to this. It has more sourness and less of that weird kumquat character. I'd probably like Peaches better than this one. Still, this one isn't a bad one to get if you enjoy fruited sours- but be forewarned, this one is more fruity than acidic."
"Overall: this was a solid beer but I think I was expecting too much. Clearly it would have been best to try this fresh but I did not have the chance. Still enjoyed this very much; pleasant experience!"
""
""
"O: Drinks very well. Great unique flavors is more than just a citrus sour. Well integrated and smooth. Oak works nicely with the ‘quats. One of the best Bruery sours I’ve had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I remember liking the Peach Sour in the Rye better."
""
""
""
"This is a very very good beer. I have traded for a bunch of this after having it for the first time. The Kumquats actually pull through on this beer and makes a big difference from the regular Sour in the Rye which is also a great beer. However the regular Sour in the Rye is not as good as this beer. Perfect amount of sour and fruit. You do still get some of the wood finish as well which is a must for me and a sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours deep orange-amber with a medium off-white head. The nose is orange, tangerine, kumquat, citrus rind, marmalade, fresh orange juice, some acidity and barnyard. The taste is crisp, sour sherbet, big sourness, kumquat, orange, tangerine, candy, tangy, decent acidity, wood and pickled onion Monster Munch with a dry, tangy finish. Medium body and fine, prickly carbonation. Crisp and sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is very tart yet easy drinking and enjoyable. It had a noticeable difference and enjoyable factor from the base. Dare I say, I enjoyed this even more than the peach version. Sour in the rye remains my favorite bruery sour and this fruited version is just fantastic. It brings the kumquat character and a whole lot more."

"O-SitR was a great beer already, adding the kumquats gave it a nice citrus finish, allowing for perfect balance. An amazing beer. Huge thanks for offing up unused allocations."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Super tart and acidic flavors of unripe fruit, mainly crabapple and grape (the tiny green sour variety). Very dry and puckering, gets the old salivary glands working into overdrive. Can't say i've ever had a kumquat, but guessing it adds some acidity and sugars to fuel the wild yeasts' activity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Of beers with additions, this really does the beer well. I'm really impressed and truly do like it more than the original. That exotic tropical kumquat really pushes this beer to another level."

"It's funny, every time I think of kumquats, my mind goes back to that skit from Sesame Street back in the day about the picky girl who didn't like kumquats (mostly because she'd never had them before and was skeptical of new things) until she'd tried them. How odd the brain works sometimes, amiright? Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy sunset ruby-amber topped by a short finger of cream foam. The nose comprises apple vinegar, cherry-flavored ShockTarts, light balsa, mild toffee, light sour plum, and a wash of sour citrus juices (potentially including the kumquat, but I have no earthly idea what that smells or tastes like, so...). The taste brings in more of the same, plenty of vinegar and straight sourness mixing with the fruit and an undercurrent of toffee-imbued sweetness that serves mostly to buoy and support the sour rather than combat it. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky-ish finish. Overall, a damn fine bit of sour, and, brother, does it ever bring the sour! Still, it's not overwhelming, but rather delicious and complex, not unlike Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge with a sharper acidity and highe3r fruitiness. Good times, indeed."
""
""
""
""
"I found this much more to my liking that the base Sour in the Rye. The sweet citrus notes add so much. I may have to get another bottle if it's still available."
""
"Overall: I have no clue what I Kumquat is, but... it really work nicely in a sour beer! I would be very receptive to more wild ales brewed with kumquat. Almost reminds me of Upland Persimmon fruit lambic. Yeah, true story!"

"D - This is a very approachable, sour. Soft, delicious. Sour, but not over the top. One of the better, more drinkable sours I have had."

"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit; I felt like this was a better version of SitR, as it was that with less vinegar to it and more citrus and oranges, and fruit in general. Plenty of sourness there too and no problem taking down the whole bottle, big fan of this one. Now I just need to get a bottle of the SitR with peaches."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is another solid brew from The Bruery. I enjoyed this one, but the Sour in the Rye w/ peaches is certainly the best variant to date. Glad to be a member of the Hoarder's Society and have more of these for the future."
""
"O - Tart - but not puckering tart, cant specifically pick out the kumquat. Was actually thicker than I was expecting. Beer is phenomenal. Oak & Rye are spectacular. Far too easy to drink. 7.6% is almost shocking."
""
""
""
"It's nice how the added fruit just accents the brew, leaving the delicious flavors of Sour in the Rye in tact."
""
"Overall not bad but nothing too special, fruit is great but overpowers at the same time."

"Easy to drink. Very tasty. I like this one."

"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer, not as sour as u thought it would be but still super fruity and deficits. Like this much more than the peach version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Certainly medium bodied. There is some fullness that comes from the oak aging. Rounds the mouthfeel."
""
"T: Opens with a drawling sour note across the palate. Faint lacto, lemon and unripe green grape hit with a touch of underripe tangerine towards the finish. The kumquats don't really hit the taste until the finish and they leave a sour and slightly bitter citrus flavor, less like kumquat flesh and more like the skin and oily residue of the fruit itself. I don't think The Bruery could have picked a better fruit to add to Sour in the Rye than kumquats. Fantastic stuff."

"O: I am very pleased that I maxed out my allocation. Definitely a sour ale that is worth seeking out."
""
"Whew! I fell in love with this one right from the first whiff. Taking the first sip only made me fall even harder. I'll definitely be drinking the bottle I have coming to me, and I might even venture to seek out a few more. Twenty bucks a bottle? Ain't no thang - this beer is totally worth it. Straight liquid kumquat and citrus Shock Tarts dipped in a vinous, vinegar-y bath. Take it to the dome and tell me you don't love it."

"O - Good sour with lots of kumquat presence that provides a tropical fruit presence that is definitely unique in a wild."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really an excellent sour beer--one of the best I have had from The Bruery. It is very drinkable, with moderate alcohol level, and the taste of fresh kumquats is just amazing for a bottled beer. One might say it is so fresh fruit dominant, that it doesn't really taste like a beer. I don't consider that a problem. It is not a fruit lambic and should not be compared to one. I'd suggest you drink this one quite fresh to retain the citrus outburst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The kumquats are a nice addition to sour in the Rye. My favorite version is still Sour in the Rye with peaches but I'm really liking this beer. Picking up my allocations was perfect timing to help get me through the hot days of summer with bottles of a tasty sour."

"Hazy orange color with minimal head due to the cask pour. Starts out with a nice vanilla aroma. Tons of kumquat and a very citrusy aroma overall. A decent amount of wood with just a mild rye and vinegar note. A touch of grass along with the wood really the only funk. Restrained acetic qualities and a nice tartness overall. Plenty of kumquat flavor makes this really enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Superb. The best beer of the day."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good. The fruit is fantastic."
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with no head and no lacing. Smell is incredible with sour, funky, and tart fruits especially the kumquats and tropical fruits. Taste is also the same with a very nice kumquat flavor that takes prominence. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very nice wild ale all around but it smells a bit better than it tastes in my opinion."
