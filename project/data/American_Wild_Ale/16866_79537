Actually, we found it pretty challenging to dissect through the thick blanket of sourness that cloaks each sip of this guy!! We were going to sit on it for a bit longer, but a friend suggested we hit it now, as its tartness would only enhance, so we decided to give it a go, and MAN, this is one of the most puckering, souring, wild things weâ€™ve ever had the pleasure of sipping. After taking those first few sips to get a handle on what exactly youâ€™re dealing with here, it starts to go down extremely smoothly, while retaining punch at every turn. Like many within the style, it is brewer with fruit, and while the cherry is certainly present, if we were told this was brewed with raspberries, or blackberries, or the likes, we wouldnâ€™t contest it. That said, it is wonderfully executed from head to toe, and has that bright personality that only The Bruery can conjure.","TheBrewo","Oct 05, 2013"

That being said, I found this beer slightly too one-note and slightly too sour for my taste buds. It's just not as complex as some of my favorite sours on the market, probably because of the massive amount of sour cherries used.

The nose is sour upfront with light sour cherries, lemony zest and a touch of something sweet in the back. The taste is just dominated by vinegar and an acidic presence that is just off putting. The beer needs more cherries and something else for balance. A thin layer of cherries, oak and lemon work against too much bacteria for sure (lactobasillus?) without any type of structure...now that I've had mother funker, oui oui and now this; I'm starting to gather a typical vinegar presence from the bruery wild stuff that is uninviting and narrow. There is a minimal amount of carbonation and the mouthfeel is medium with a very dry finish. Overall I wanted to like this beer but the truth is, is that's it's a terrible kriek and needs to go on home. A sour, acidic, vinegar, light cherried mess that looks like chunkless vomit. $20 are you fucking serious? I'd rather eat a bag of shit.","JayAre46","Jul 03, 2012"

Smells of sweet malt and sour cherries with enough funk and sour tartness to keep me interested. The tartness pricks the tongue at first sip and never lets go. I get lots of lemon and tart cherry flavor and I swear I'm getting coconut as well. Earthy and fruity tart describe this one fairly well. The finish is quite dry with a long lingering tartness on the palette. Medium to thin body body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart almost salty mouthfeel.

A couple fingers of white foam crown the beer, showing little head retention and no lacing. The nose is excellent, led by a blend of earthy funk and cherry skins. A solid supporting tart aroma rounds out the picture. The flavor profile has far more acidity than I expected. It really takes over the beer and drowns out the cherries and brett. They're both still there (though definitely the former more than the latter), but this is a very different beer than the nose had suggested. The body is very light,and paired with an expansive, active carbonation. The mouthfeel is champagne-esque. Sans Pagaie is a bit aggressive for a beer that's just out of the gates, especially compared to some classic Belgian krieks. It's definitely not without its charms though.","axeman9182","Jul 02, 2012"

The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart cherry, sweet cherry, sugar, funk, subtle saltiness, and subtle wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The cherries on this one were one of the most intense experiences I have had to date with this fruit with both sweet and tart going on at the same time. The funk laid a nice foundation as well to follow-up everything. The mouthfeel on this one was great to say the least. Felt like little scrubbing bubbles dancing on my tongue.

4.4,5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a reddish-grapefruit like color that is almost clear with a medium white head that disappears instantly. Scent is heavy with the cherriesâ€¦a ton of funk reached my nose the second I popped off the cap. A bit of citrus on top of the cherriesâ€¦Iâ€™m picking up grapefruit and tangerines. Just a touch of vinegar. Taste is initially delicious tangerines, which graceful transforms into tart cherries. Finish with a sweet cherry flavor on the back of the tongue. At first this beer seems extremely sour, but as you take more sips, it becomes much more balanced. Nice cherry sweetness to this beer. A bit of oak in the middle of the palate, but not nearly as much as Otiose. Mouthfeel is light bodied and very fizzy, almost soda-like. Puckering sour leads to sticky sweet. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is another outstanding sour from The Bruery. I was worried the cherries would not be as noticeable as I was hoping, but it definitely pulled through. Bravo Bruery!","DovaliHops","May 13, 2012"

You may be let down if you are looking for something mouthpuckering. So far this is my favorite sour among the Bruery's 2012 releases.","pmarlowe","Mar 19, 2012"

Taste is of sour and tart cherries, funk, and some slight vinegar flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.
