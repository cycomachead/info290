Malty flavor has woody and tart fruity notes, giving it an almost wine-like nature. Smooth texture has good fizz and rather wine-like body, leaving a tart and woody finish. Distinctive, enjoyable, tasty.","Cyberkedi","Mar 07, 2015"

There's a bit of sour cherry tartness, but it's restrained.  Not a whole lot of depth to it, but what it does, it does fairly well.  Malt isn't very pronounced, hops aren't a factor.  No hot alcohol taste, which is good for a 9% ABV brew.  A well done effort by Sam Adams.","SaltyDog75","Jan 19, 2015"

3.99,6.7,3.75,4,4,4,4,"so good and so different, its nice to know the big guys can still pull off beer like this. its cool stuff, somewhere in the flanders red neighborhood, but it feels sour from a blend, not sour from a raw ferment, which is fine, but that's the point of departure for me. deep brick red color with some haze to it and a tall tan head with 100% retention, as long as I drink this the head holds up. the nose here is tangy with some fruity notes, dried cherries or even cranberries seem obvious, but red wine tannins, plums, lacto, and wet oak are all there too. the taste is similar with the sourness coming fist, even before the malt, which is big and round and caramel based but only moderately sugary. pucker but not caustic on the acidity, and its short lived and quickly balanced out by the fruit and the density of the grain. a really unique beer, especially at this abv, which I think is an odd feature for it. heavy oak too, really pleasant this time of year. super impressed with the clever uniqueness of this beer and its overall quality. im so used to seeing the seasonals and boston lager from these guys, its nice to know they are capable of beers this special. worth way more than what they ask for it, I like that too!","StonedTrippin","Nov 22, 2014"

There isn't much of the bourbon barrel aging process noticeable either, beyond a hint of wood towards the back of the tongue.

4.06,8.6,4.5,4,4,4.25,4,"O - Samuel Adams greatest achievement with Stony Brook Red is making a near double-digit alcohol beer drink like half its content. This Flanders Red, if you will, has a nice touch of oak aging and funky sourness to it that creates a different experience but it's greatest achievement is also it's undoing I feel. The strength in numbers doesn't shine through, but the slightly heavier body and fuller maltiness leads this beer down a path of less drinkability; a detour from the course the style originally intended. It's nice to see big brewers like this playing around with sour beers though.","BeerFMAndy","May 30, 2014"

There are also some dark fruit notes but they get lost in the tart smell. The taste notes are similar to the smell. The taste has the same funk taste but the dark fruit notes are much stronger.

Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.

Aromas of tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, plum, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, caramel, toast, light chocolate, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, plum, red wine, oak, clove, leather, funk, light vinegar, hay, straw, herbal, caramel, toast, light chocolate, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, cranberry, green apple, plum, raisin, red wine, oak, clove, leather, funk, light vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, oak barrel, and dark malt flavors; with balanced sweetness/tartness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/acidic mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice wild ale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

The base beer is a big, smooth amber ale - warm, toasted, and caramelly. Big, coarse, woody oak note on the finish that is a bit jarring at the beginning but is really quite pleasant when it's all said and done. Really smooth at 9% ABV. Don't expect a traditional Flanders Red. The sourness is pretty subdued, but there is plenty of complexity and the big maltiness and 9% ABV make it a nice sipper. A great value at $4.99/750mL. Enjoyable enough to convince me to try the other 2 beers in the barrel room series.","bump8628","Dec 19, 2012"

The taste is surprising, as it hits with the initial sweet-tartness of an oud bruin, but finishes bitter, like a hoppy red ale. There is a great yeast presence and the beer is relatively balanced/drinkable with my simple dinner. The mouthfeel is a little off, but I can't place my finger on what I don't like. I would recommend letting it warm a touch to let the full flavor profile shine through.

(Which could potentially change with cellaring adjustment.) It also suffers from being about 15% too sweet IMHO. It's identifiable as an introductory-level (newbie accessible) American-made Flanders, but still a lot less raunchy and wild than the real McCoy from Belgium. If I see it again in the stores I know I'm going to be picking up another bottle or two to see what a year or so of basement aging does to improve yeast funk and tanginess levels. It's got the right amount of oak wood, acidity, and sourness, but needs some more dryness, funk, and wild yeast character. Give it a shot fresh if you prefer your sours woody yet still semi-sweet. If not, either give it a pass, or try to see what happens with cellaring it.","WastingFreetime","Nov 05, 2012"

Is the Samuel Adams name on the bottle making people underrate these? Anyway, Stony Brook Red pours out a deep red color with a small head. The aroma reveals layers of tart cherry, oak, vanilla, and a bit of vinegary funk. The flavor profile is similar to a Flanders Oud Bruin, with the tart cherry, grape, and funk taking center stage here. The toasted oak comes through on the late finish, bringing along it's buddy vanilla for a great aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's highly carbonated and very dry. The drinkability is also great. Another winner from the Barrel Room Collection. The oak on the finish really pulls everything together for me, it's integrated so well.

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"750ml corked and caged bottle courtesy of Brett. Served in a tulip . Pours a burnt red hue that is closer to brown than red with a hazy clarity. The one and a half inch, cream-colored head gradually dissipates into a sudsy slick. Nose expresses tannins, vanilla notes and oak - there's also a vinegary tartness that intermingles with the other aromas. Taste follows nose - the flavors meld together nicely - tannic with some medicinal notes at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with lively carbonation and a slight astringency. I have to say that I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer although I would say that it is more reminiscent of a Flanders Oud Bruin than an American Wild if I had to guess.

Second, I don't find wild ales in general to be particularly high in terms of drinkability when I try to rate it objectively.

Oak pulls through nicely, sweet and acidic but gets kind of overly funky in the aftertaste and an oddly bitter finish. Feels light in body and crisp due to high carbonation. Drinks easy, especially for a 9% beer. Flavorful and a good interpretation by Sam Adams, but not anywhere near as good as RR or other popular sours. Best out of the Barrel Room Collection, without a doubt, but I don't think I'll really seek this one out again. I might reconsider that if only to see what some age in the bottle does to it, however.","kbanks13","Nov 27, 2010"

It's definitely a sour beer, but the tang isn't that ripping. It reminds me a touch of the Odell Woodcut beers, and that's a good thing.

An agglutination of foam in the center lets me know the laser etch is workin' just fine. The nose comprises dark, tart berries, sour cherries, a touch of vinegar, dark wheat, oak, and a scraping of brett. The taste follows, upping the oak ante, as well as that of the brett and sour notes, and tossing in a pinch of salt for good measure. The body is a sturdy medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a rather dry finish. Not bad, overall, though not something to drink regularly.","TMoney2591","Jun 21, 2010"

I snagged this one at the local Foodmaster (yep, a supermarket with liquor license...decent beer & wine and only getting better...and carpeted!). I wondered, what kind of red ale it might be, like a bland Irish red...wondered what the waters of Hyde Park might have spawned beneath the cork & cage...A hearty pop of the cork later released an aroma that I initially took for spoilt, as the sour funk escaped. The pour was a wet dark red with a fluffy off-white head of 2 fingers that soon sunk down to little, though some lace stuck around throughout. The aroma definitely pushes the funky farmhouse thing, evoking cherry & ripened green apples. This holds true with the flavor: sweet & tart, cherry-rose hip-apple with some hefe-like yeast & rich malts all work together so that not one thing overpowers. A bit lacking in body and mouthfeel for something akin to a Belgian farm ale, but still mighty fine.","selecter70","Mar 20, 2010"

I had been interested in some of SA's barrel aged brews since I heard about them, and was very happy to see this one in the box as an extra. Pours a dark amber color with a very large tan head which was long-lasting and left some sparse lacing on the glass. First aromas I get are tart apple skins, a bit of lemon, some cherry, and a musty, basement-like quality as it warms. Taste is somewhat tart, barrel flavors are there, wet oak, etc. The base beer is solidly noticeable, much like a strong brown ale, with some caramel and breadiness and a touch of tart cherries added to it, yet the cherries aren't overly predominate. A little bit of cheesy funkiness is in the depths of this, but would really like to have more acidity and more cherry flavor. Becomes a bit too sweet and boozy as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium-full, average carbonation. A decent barrel aged wild ale, but nothing to write home about. That description is pretty much standard for all BBC brews.

Nose initially seems to be typical belgian phenols but gives way to more. Aromas of belgian style yeast meets spices akin to clove, minor amount of banana and then increasingly more tartness, funk, fruit and then an ever so slight bit of oaky subtleness as it warms. Taste is tart but includes some musty notes, fruity apple and pear, clove, slight bit of banana and finishes slightly bitter and quite drying. With the drying finish comes some of the oak and woodsy characteristics in the taste. Feel of this beer is light with moderately high carbonation. Very drinkable and the alcohol is hidden quite well for 9%.","stakem","Feb 26, 2010"

There is a touch more vinegar to this beer than I would have liked, and for that I'm keeping the beer out of the A range, but it really is refreshing, sweetish, cherry tartness, sweet malts, floral, with a slight mouth puckering acerbic punch. The wild yeastiness brings the vinegary flavors to the fore. I think the yeast needs to be tamed a bit.

I worked up about two fingers of heading, which fizzed away, and faded quickly. It definitely smells like a wild beer. I get plenty of fruit, some degree of funk, smells sort of like sparkling wine. Taste has some tart cherry, apple skin, barnyard funk, and little touches of the oak here and there. It feels pretty light on the palate, with a good dose of carbonation, furthering it's similarity to a sparkling wine. Alcohol is evident in the taste, but it does nothing to impair the drinkability. Not a bad beer at all here from Sam Adams. The price tag isn't too bad, the bottle is nice, and the liquid within it is as well.
