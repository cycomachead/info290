Taste is a great mix between some sour and tart notes with some funky yeast. Apricot notes a very subtle and kind of hard to distinguish. Pinot noir barrel lend a light vinous feel to the beer. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Enjoyable sour but I would have preferred more apricot notes to be upfront.","Phyl21ca","Oct 08, 2014"

The taste is also distinctly apricot that is tart with just enough sweetness and has a lingering dried apricot finish. The beer's light bodied, true to fruit with layered barrel complexities, light-medium carbonation, and a mouthwateringly dry finish. This beer is quite fantastic, really nails the apricot sour profile.","ThePorterSorter","Feb 03, 2014"

Feels a bit heavy on the tongue, in a good way. I would like a little more carbonation, but my bottle may have been compromised in the mail. All the other flavors are there, though.

5,9.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Yes, I gave this beer the elusive 5 because I thought that for what it is (a soured, fruited, wine barrel-aged Saison) it did what it was supposed to flawlessly. It skyrocketed immediately to my top 10 favorite beers of all time and is worthy of the hype and what I traded for it. A truly memorable experience.","ironchefmiyagi13","Nov 09, 2013"

Intense but not overpowering. Complex but not complicated. Bright, fruity, spicy, and playful. Remarkably easy to drink.","dv8sean","Aug 14, 2013"
