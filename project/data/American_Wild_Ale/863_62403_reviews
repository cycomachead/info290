"Bottle: Poured alight reddish color ale with a nice off-white head with OK retention and light lacing notes. Taste of lightly tart fresh raspberry notes is very pleasant. Taste is also dominated by tart fresh raspberry notes with light acidic notes noticeable and light oak notes also perceptible. Body is about average with good carbonation. Great trade-off between sour notes and fresh fruit notes with good overall drinkability."

"Framboise for a Cure (2014) - Russian River Brewing Company - Santa Rosa, California - American Wild Ale - 6.70% ABV - This delicious wild ale poured a ruby red color, with a small pink head that dissipates immediately. The nose featured aromas of tart raspberries and white wine up front, followed by undertones of oak, apricots, and peach. The mouth was very tart, with flavors of juicy raspberries, Chardonnay, oak, and peach that blend together nicely. The mouthfeel was light bodied, with an enamel ripping finish that was quite refreshing. This was a solid offering from Russian River, but I prefer Supplication (I'm just a sucker for that beer) and Beatification over this one. 98/100"

"Overall, this is a very well done fruited sour. The balance between the fruit flavor and the sourness is almost perfect, with neither flavor ever taking over the other. It's been a while since I've had a Russian River sour, and I really miss them now."

"O: Good, but not quite befitting the frenzy.  Happy to have tried it, happy to have not had to deal with the craziness at Russian River to do so."
""
""
""

"Really nice Framboise.  The sourness/tartness is actually pretty well balanced by the raspberry flavor.  Malt is barely there but also helps to balance.  Overall its sour yet smooth and refreshing.  I think the hype has made this beer into a little more than it is, but it's great and I would happily have this whenever given this chance.  Definitely, try it if you can but don't trade your whole cellar away for it."

"Always delicious had it on Tap at RRBC and got a few bottles obviously. I think i like it a little better than last years batch. One of my favorite Raspberry beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the brewery - Light and refreshing, nice raspberry flavor. Of the other sours, Probably closest in mouthfeel and body to Temptation. Not too much pucker, more tart than sour. Nice on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-the nose is fantastic and has a great balanced and integration of juicy fruits and nicely done funk. the flavor falls slightly short of that in that the fruits are more mild and the funk is slighly muddled. still reasonably good flavor, the balance is there it just seems to become ever so slightly messy."

"I know this ain't the most detailed review but I enjoyed the 11, 12,13 better than the 10 for what it's worth. I hung onto the 10 since the release and really wanted a 5 year tasting but popped it early. Glad I did. Seems it's prime was a while ago"

"A nice light frothy pink on the surface. Smells of raspberries, lemon, lactic, grass and some more raspberries and their pithy, vegetal character. This beer is very, very razzy. Plenty of raspberry notes, some dry tartness, lacto tartness, some gain and peppery sharp notes. Itâ€™s tart, but has a hollow middle for me. Medium on thin bodied with moderate on hi carb and a semi dry finish. This one is good, clean and approachable."

"O: Easy drinking, tasty, refreshing, and a good level of sourness. A solid effort overall, though nothing out of this world, and not substantively better than their (excellent) shelf sours."

"been wanting to try this one for as long as i can remember (which, as i have admitted before, may not be all that long honestly), but thanks to drlovemd87 as always, for breaking out the whales. pale pink in color like raspberry ginger ale, and possessing the same sort of bright carbonation and lightness of body as my favorite soda. white head is wispy but quick to go, and the nose is a wonderful sensation of fresh and freeze dried raspberries, wild yeast tartness, lacto, and lemon. there is an herbal softness to kick this off before the berries come in, and when they do, they are subtle, mellow, and not sweet in the slightest. i also get some moderate oak, more woodsy than vanilla, i suspect a real light char if any. beautiful fruit complexion as it finishes, unfolding like a blossoming flower, and has that same delicacy. i love the mouthfeel too, soft as can be, carbonated like a soda pop, and drinking like anything but beer, just light and effervescent and uplifting in every way. not as raspberry forward as i sometimes like these to be, but this is a creation unique to itself, unlike the others, and so i don't wish it to be any different. another beautiful russian river brew worthy of the highest trade value. just sensational."
"O - Overall, I enjoyed this beer. The taste though was a big time drop of the nose. If this was aged/old, I could understand and justify it...but for a fresh wild the raspberry should be much more powerful. Would definitely have it again though."

"Overall - The aroma builds anticipation that doesn't fulfill in the flavor, but the base beer is too good for this to be anything but tasty. Temptation is subdued, but holds this on its shoulders."

"O- A very good take on a framboise. I would put this one behind Framboos and Hommage, but better than LP Framboise."

"The beer pours a dull blood orange/pink with a thin, foamy white head and touch of sediment. The nose is subtle tart raspberry with deep funk and touch of alcohol. The taste is definitely tart raspberries in the forefront with an acidic funkiness that really ramps up the fruit's juiciness. The mouthfeel is light bodied (but not watery), effervescent, tart/acidic, and definitely drinkable. This is a lighter bodied, subtle raspberry framb with a big funk presence and balanced acidity...just wish it wasn't so hard to get!"

"Pours a hazy light red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, raspberry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour and tart raspberry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better sour raspberry quality in the aroma."

"A little candy-like, not the most complex sour they've brewed, but this would make a great intro to the style. Of course you have to get your hands on it..."

"O: This is a delicious beer. I know I've never had a framboise I enjoyed more, and am fairly certain I've never had a sour I enjoyed more. If this beer were easier to get and more consistently available, I'd consume it regularly and be thrilled about it. As it is, it's just a great treat."

"I was lucky enough to be in the area during their October release of this beer and I'm so glad I was. I love all of Russian river's sour ales but this one was unique. Not quite as sour as some of their others but it made it so drinkable that it was addictive. Definitely a strong dose of raspberries. They put 100 pounds of raspberries in per barrel. It had a sweet aroma with a touch of bread. The mouthfeel was incredible. I could've chugged beer after beer if I wanted to. Moderate sour and sweet crisp finish. I wasn't able to get any bottles but I definitely drank my fill on draft. Excellent beer highly recommend of you're in the area during the month long release"

"I'm glad to have tried this. If the opportunity to get this again comes up, it's just as high priority as Beat is. It's just a nice, well-balanced and sweet American sour that hits the spot that some of the Belgians don't (read: less funky, more sweet). It's a great beer for sure."

"O: This beer is very well blended and provides interesting complexities from the sourness and raspberries. It's not too sour and the fruity flavors seem very natural."
"O: Easy to drink and really well balanced between the upfront sweetness and tartness/sourness. Very enjoyable and probably one of my favorite framboise beers - no hints of anything artificial (very much the natural flavors of the fruits)."

"O- This was a great framboise and probably my second favorite I've had next to Cantillon's Lou Pepe Framboise which add a little bit more funkiness that only Cantillon can achieve. It was very drinkable with a nice sweet fruit presence balanced with a nice tartness. If you like the style of framboise I definitely recommend trying this out."

"Framboise for a Cure is damn good. As I stated earlier, I'm a huge fan of raspberries and I tend to be somewhat biased towards beers with well-integrated raspberries - exactly what this beer is. That being said, and somewhat shockingly so, I think I prefer the regular Temptation to this batch of Framboise for a Cure (which is essentially Temptation with raspberries). Nevertheless, still a fine brew and sure to make any raspberry and/or sour lover go nuts. Get some!"

"This poured out as a beautiful red color with a light pink head on top. The retention is pretty good here, not much lacing. The smell of the beer is slightly floral and fruity with a tart aroma on it. The taste is tart with a nice raspberry sweetness. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied with a good carbonation. Sweet and dry plenty of sour tart fruity notes. Overall this is a really good brew. Glad I got to have it!"

"Overall: Framboise for a Cure is a great fruit sour, however it needs a little more complexity from the base beer in order to compete with the likes of Lou Pepe Framboise or Southampton Black Raspberry Lambic."
"Tart and puckering with a nice balance of musty funk, sweet beery and earthy oak. Â There's a subtle lactic presence in finish that compliments the barrel, fruit and sour notes. Â Not acidic or harsh with the perfect amount of sourness that counters the oak barrel and seedy berries. Â Sweet vinous raspberries flavor is strong but not as prominent as it is in the nose. Â Very juicy and fresh with lots of raspberry, currant, grape and other dark fruits. Â Very complex yet remains delicate and very easy to drink for a sour. Â "

"O: Very well done fruit sour; top of the charts for an american wild. Thanks to deeblo for the chance to snag a bottle of this."
"O - Tart and sweet, then tart again, very tasty."
"O: Very very tasty. Not my favorite RR sour, but I'm very impressed. Would drink this anytime it's available."

"Verdict: Just delightful, a pleasure to drink and another world class sour beer from Russian River. The raspberry flavors are really allowed to shine here and with it, bring out some great complimentary aspects that take this to a new level, rather than just being a sour bomb. Glad to have another one to cellar."
"O: this elusive beer has been in my gots list since the first batch and it did not disappoint. Solid beer all around and glad to have another bottle in the cellar. Good lookin out beezler."

"This thing pours pink, pink, pink. A nice light frothy pink on the surface. Smells of raspberries, lemon, lactic, grass and some more raspberries and their pithy, vegetal character. This beer is very, very razzy. Plenty of raspberry notes, some dry tartness, lacto tartness, some gain and peppery sharp notes. It's tart, but has a hollow middle for me. Medium on thin bodied with moderate on hi carb and a semi dry finish. This one is good, clean and approachable."
"Taste is similar, mostly dry raspberry with faint sweetness, lightly sour and tart and acidic, a light but firm rustic yeastiness underneath and light yeasty bread in the aftertaste. It has some noticeable rustic/funky yeasty and sour-ale character but it certainly could use more to make a really complex fruit wild ale. However, it is very good, crisp, bright, quenching, and has a little complexity but not nearly enough to be a truly exceptional example. I like beers of this sort to have a lot of flavour, not be really lean and dry like dry champagne, which this tends towards. I also like my fruit wild ales or lambics to have plenty of very evident funky/yeasty character in addition to the fruit. The feel is pretty good, but a bit thin and not lively or engaging."
"O-What a beer. Russian River knows what they are doing with their sour program."
"Feel is a nice step below medium with a great pucker on the end of the tounge, swirling this around the mouth keeps the berries coming, very fresh beer here, I wonder what time would do to this but I would have a hard time holding it. I ordered another glass on the way out."

"Pours distinct raspberry red color with a finger of light pink foam. The head fell somewhat quickly and left nothing behind. The nose is full of tart raspberries and a mild sugary sweetness. Some musty hay and acidic cider vinegar. On the palate, the raspberries are front and center. Big, bold tart raspberries rush the palate with a mild sugary sweetness in tow. Some hay and light manure-like funk come through in the middle before tart raspberries pop back up in the finish. The finish is sharp, dry, and tart. Light body with high carbonation. The raspberry flavor really lingers; your mouth is coated with fresh raspberries. A really delicious beer with loads of fresh fruit. Extremely drinkable."
"Served in a tulip glass, poured a bright magenta color, with a small, frothy white head that fizzled out after a moment, leaving a ringlet and a few stray bubbles behind. Lots of raspberry in the nose, as would be expected, lesser notes of musty grass and citrus juice. Puckeringly tart on the tongue, fresh raspberries dominate, citric, lactic, acetic (just a bit), mild grassy funk, and a touch of woodiness. Tasty! Good balance of sour and sweet, once your palate gets used to the initial snap of tartness. Light-medium mouthfeel, very drinkable if you like sours/fruits/lambics."

"Drink- Cant thank Jim enough for helping me tick this one. Good sour and an even better cause."
""
""
"This year's vintage of Framboise for a Cure was blended 80% to 20% with Russian River's spontaneously fermented sour, Beatification. The hint of the lambic, or ""Sonambic"" as Russian River calls Beatification, really adds a layer of nuanced funkiness that really sets it apart from the previous two vintages which utilized purely their blonde sour, Temptation as the base beer. While not Russian River's most complex of their sours, the 2013 Framboise for a Cure really harnesses the raw essence of fresh raspberries like no other beer I've had. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O- This beer was awesome! I can't wait to try it as it progresses!"
"Tasty beer but needs more raspberries to be a world-class Framboise. The sour/acid level on this beer is right at the threshold or perhaps a bit overdone, as the throat burn lingers with a good length."
"375ml of the second batch, temptation base. Bright red, almost fuschia color, pink head that disappeared quick. Looks like a Kriek. The smell was funky, sort of fecal like manure, a hint of fruit. Flavor was sour, acidic, sharp fruit but not a distinct raspberry flavor. Overall, a good beer but not one of Russian River's best. I'd like to have tried the beatification version so hopefully that make that again."
""
""
"This beer pours the brightest cherry red in color, a little light in body with a lot of carbonation but only a slight pinkish head. It is bright, bright red. The nose is sour and has great acidity. It features a nice balance of tart and sweet raspberry with just enough fruit. There really isn't too much yeast character at all. It drinks almost an off dry due to the presence of juicy raspberry. It is just fantastic. This is such a great and easy drinking raspberry sour. I place it at the very top, above LP Framboise. This is one of my all time favorites."
"O: A fantastic sour, and one which I would love the chance to try again. A must-try for sour fans, if you're lucky enough to find it and have the cash."
"Anyways. This has a mellow and nice funky thing going on, but the raspberries really take a hold of this and throw a lot of ""natural"" flavor in as well. It leans towards too fruity a bit, but doesn't get overly obnoxious so much that we're entering artificial lambic territory, a la Lindemans. A treat to be able to try. And I'm glad I didn't make the trek all the way to Santa Rosa and was able to try it at City Beer instead."
"Mouthfeel is puckering, but doesn't destroy your mouth with acidity. Sweetness keeps it incredibly drinkable. Seed aspect is incredible on all levels. Overall there are not too many other sours I've had that can measure up to this one."
""
"Well, this is a nice, if not a bit simple. A slightly sour raspberry delivery vehicle that serves a singular purpose. Drinkable, if not a bit one dimentional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big thanks to KevSal for the hookup! Pours a ruby red with a nice head. Nose is blanketed with funky barnyard aroma with some citrus and raspberry. Taste starts off with a burst of raspberry citrus flavor. This moves to a funky must and mushroom. Ends nicely with some citrus sourness and a lot of raspberry. Overall, this is pretty awesome framboise. I like the funkiness and the sweetness recommended if you can snag a bottle."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really great tartness from the raspberries on top of the temptation base. The extra flavor adds some great complexity and sharpness to the beer."
"Nice one, Russian River, keep fighting that fight, all in the name of boobies. Hooray for boobies!"
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was an awesome beer. I had heard Batch 2 wasn't that good but was pleasantly surprised by this when I finally opened it. Ton of sour dark fruits in the nose, a beer I'll certainly try and get when they brew it again. Worth seeking out."
"This framboise is all about what makes the raspberry fruit shine and what complements it in what intensity. The riddle is answered with this well controlled taste in one of the best ales of its style!"
"O: Pretty bummed about this beer, least the $20 went to the hospital down the street. Dunno why this is so highly rated."
""
""
"Overall: This beer was a huge let down after the 3 Fonteinen Hommage. It is like comparing fish-sticks with freshly prepared codfish, comparing the Wageningen Ice Tigers with the Boston Bruins. It just doesnâ€™t make any sense; it is a completely different league. If one is unaware of the greatness that is out there, one probably thinks this beer is world-class. However, in a showdown with the better ones, this Framboise for a Cure is downgraded to the fish-stick- and Wageningen Ice Tiger level .The Hommage simply did to this beer what the atomic bomb did to Nagasaki, it completely wiped it off the (beer)map. The only thing that has to be cured now is my faith in US-Raspberry soursâ€¦."
""
""
"OVERALL: Wish I could say I was more impressed with this than I was. We had this right after Hommage. That probably didnâ€™t help. This simply looked and tasted artificial, as if something unnatural was added to get the color and flavor they wanted. The nose was simply too mild and boring to be worth noting as well. Another member of our group that day thought this was the best sour of the day, so take my review for what itâ€™s worth. I found this to be a big disappointment, especially after having Hommage."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. Temptation is one of my favorite wild's from Russian River and it worked very well as the base for this beer. Awesome stuff for sure."
""
"O: Good American framboise but is not in the league of some of my favorites from Belgum."
""
"O-4"
""
"thanks for sharing this 375 ml., Tom. well, very pink bodied for starters. A great aroma of fruit dessert. The taste came off quite well, with sourness and fruitiness. I could have easily have finished it myself if someone had not kept grabbing the bottle. Certainly worthy of RR. Good mouthfeel for a sour."
"Beer pours an awesome-looking brilliant ruby red with very little head. Smell is equally excellent, great mix of raspberries and the typical Russian River sour/oak aroma. Flavor has a little bit of funk up front before the raspberries take over, then it finishes a bit tart and acidic. It's medium-bodied and a little dry in the finish. Overall, this is a really nice raspberry sour, one of the best I've had - my past experiences with raspberries haven't been super positive and this one definitely stands out above the pack."
"Overall quite a nice beer, definitely worthy of some trades."
"O: This is pretty much everything I was hoping FfaC would be, and more. I think this is now my favorite RR beer and quite possibly a very close 2nd to Rose de Gambrinus. Very pleased with this. Very good beer and one well worth the price of admission. If you haven't tried this and like sours and/or fruit beers and like supporting good causes, GET THIS BEER! I could seriously put a dent into a keg of this...if not finish it off within an almost medically unsound timeframe."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a sour bomb, it's mouth puckeringly delicious, fresh raspberries dominate and the mouthfeel is light with a lot of carbonation. Finish is very dry and sharp."
""
""
"O: I never thought I would get to try this stuff. I'd say this is the best American framboise I've had to date, RR really kills some sours. The Temptation base is awesome as always and the fruit is as fresh as a daisy."
""
""
""
"O- Really impressed with this beer, I had high hopes and was not let down, love the sour tartness that comes out, I also love fresh raspberries, which came out upfront in this beer, extremely grateful to have traded for this gem, and would love another opportunity to try it with some age."
""
"Really wish they put the back label on this guy to show what they feel the aging should be like and how exactly this one was made. The $20 price tag is also a bit steep for the beer your getting but it is for a good cause."
"I gotta say, it's going to be tough for any new beer I try in 2012 to top this one!"
""
""
"Bottle shared at the December iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours a vivid magenta color without much of a head. Absurd raspberry aroma, fruitier and more tart than even NG Raspberry Tart. Really the most realistic, eye-popping recreation of fruit in a beer that Iâ€™ve ever smelled. Great balance in the flavor between sourness and fruit. Divine."
""
"Dark purple raspberry hue. Pink head. Smells of full on fresh raspberry puree. Touch of tart funk with a good amount of barrel wood. Flavors are pretty much raspberry city. The tartness is mild until the finish. Medium body with mild carbonation. A true delight to drink for sure. Very glad I got a chance to try it."
""
""
""
""
"4.5/4/4"
""
"The beer is a dark ruby hue, unsurprisingly resembling raspberry juice. The head is pinky and foamy, rapidly receding to zilch. The aroma brings some distinctive Russian River yeast with a bold serving of raspberries. Great flavor, with lots of fresh, slightly tart berries. Pretty straightforward. Not overly funky, sour, or tart, hut rather refreshing, chuggable, and delicious. Light on the palate with spritzy carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this. An excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful, dark clear crimson color with a dense light pink/rose head; nice retention. Complex aroma of tart raspberry, earth, funk and oak. Flavor is dominated by the raspberry, lactic and earthy must; not particularly sour or as interesting as Temptation, but not good nonetheless. Light, crisp, mild bite on the body. I like raspberries, so I liked this a lot, but fresh the depth of other RR sours is lacking from this batch."
""
""
""
"Framboise for a Cure pours a somewhat cloudy cherry red. There are plentiful gorgeous ruby highlights shining through, even when the beer's not backlit. About a finger of rose tinted foam briefly graces the top of the glass, before quickly fading away. The nose is nearly flawless. Raspberry is the first thing to jump out, and is the dominant aroma present. Earthy brett funk is right behind, playing a strong second. An acetic sour twang is also there, but very much in the background compared to the other two. My only minor quibble is that the whole thing could stand to be a bit more powerful. The first thing that stands out about the flavor is that it's much more tart than the nose would have suggested. A close second is that the raspberries have fallen way off from what I expected. If the aroma profile was 50/40/10 in terms of raspberry/funk/sour, I'd say the taste is at 20/30/50, with the berry flavor only creeping in on the back end. The body is fairly dry, and works nicely with the expansive, champagne-like carbonation. Framboise for a Cure is another world class wild brew from Russian River, though I'm surprised both at how just how wild it is and how muted the fruit is for a relatively young beer."

"Flavor largely matches the aroma, with a bit more of a punch from the raspberries, but still not as tart as I had anticipated from a Russian River sour. Biscuity malts in the background. Dryness is on-point for the style, and the carbonation level really suits the drinkability. Enjoyed every sip of the bottle without getting fatigued like other sours have the capability of doing. A nice Framboise in the end, but slightly underwhelming given the attention paid to this sour."
""
"I think Framboise For A Cure is a well-applied use of raspberry and barrel, aside from the finish. In any case, I am quite happy to have tried it."

"Pours a bright pink color with no head into my ccb snifter. Aroma of raspberries, oak and funk. Taste follows the nose with raspberries up front then sour notes and funk, then oak while finishing back with the raspberries. Tart but not crazy which makes this highly drinkable. Overall this is my favorite framboise to date!"

"D/O - Drinkability is high. During a night which we had a good amount of sours, this one stands alone as one of the highlights of the night. It doesn't rely on the oak barrel to provide the flavor even though it was present, and the tartness is just prominent enough to deliver the strong raspberry flavors but keep it balanced and enjoyable. One of the best Russian River beers I've had and one of the best sours I've had period."
"O: Best sour of the night, including the Goose Island 3 Sisters and Bruery Oude Tart. One of the best American Wilds I have ever had the privilege of tasting."

"Taste, jeez, this just doesn't let up! Incredibly flavorful, rich raspberries, seemingly picked at the height of sweet and tenderness. Somehow neither the immense fruitness or sourness envelope each other. Russian River really outdid themselves on this one."
"O - Very good framboise. As much as I enjoy the sweeter and fruitier framboises out there (NG Raspberry Tart, Blushing Monk, etc), I have to say this was just about as enjoyable, but in a different way. Refreshing tartness with fresh raspberries mixed in and still retaining the wild characteristics...interesting and having some added complexity. No letdown here at all - glad to have gotten the opportunity to try this one."

"very drinkable and one of the best american framboise i have had. never overpowering and well integrated through out. no sign that temptation is the base for this."
"cheers, russian river."
"Beer is light, airy on the palate, mildly sweet, acetic bite, strong raspberry, overall a nice little beer. I'd have it again."
"O- Best sour I've had to date. Just absolutely incredible. The sour was pungent, but didn't detract from the fruit flavors one bit. Not quite as sour as Cuvee de Jacobins, but close. Officially an always want of mine!"
"Excellent, and I would not expect anything else from Russian River. Perfectly bubbly and champagne like. I love it."
"O: Very refreshing and an excellent example of the style."
"Overall this is a great beer, really really good. Wish it was in a bigger bottle!"
"Brashly fruity and tart with a good funk. An awesome example of an authentic framboise by Russian River. Glad it became more available this year so more people can taste it, even if the base beer isn't the same (last year Beatification, this year it's Temptation). Trade for this if you can, it will not disappoint."
"Very impressive beer, though at least for me, this isn't the sort of thing I'd want to drink every day. Still glad I had a chance to try it."
"Overall this is a treat to drink. Plenty of fresh raspberry fruitiness intertwined with a lemon rind sourness, and barnyard/wet blanket funk. Complex, layered yet balanced and drinkable."
"Overall, this was pretty good, though I think Beatification would certainly make a better base. That said, I'd love to try the first batch."
"Fresh raspberry dessert sour. Drinks very easily and each sip brings complex deliciousness."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a prickly and lively level of carbonation in the mouth but visually it looks to be a bit lacking. Even though this is my first time having this brew, it carries with it some very familiar aspects to it. It was quite enjoyable and the alcohol level is well integrated throughout. An interesting brew that is worth the try if you ever get a chance. Not fully worth the price tag of admission but for the cause it is well worth it and something I would see out again just because."
"Overall, another impressive Russian River sour. However, I'm left feeling a bit dissapointed. I'm not sure this is any better than temptation, which is a shame given the rarity and increased price."
"Overall: I am normally a huge fan of raspberry sours, but I felt the raspberry flavors blocked out the other nice complexities in the base beer, resulting a slightly lower score."
"Overall: Well done. Sour, good fruit flavor. Well balanced. Delicious."
"2011 vintage. Thanks Mario! Pours a beautiful bright red with a nice, small baby pink head. Scent is RASPBERRY CITY! Nice tart funkiness and acidic aroma. Taste is more sour than aroma portrays, which is never a bad thing. Delicious sour raspberries with yummy wild yeast flavors that RR specializes in. Finishes with sweet raspberries and a tart bite. Mouthfeel is light and puckering. Drinkability is very high...if you can afford it. Thank God it's goin to boobies. Overall, this beer was like The Bruery's BeRazzled on steroids...a better version of it. One of the best Framboise style beers I've ever had."
"Awesome beer. Just the right amount of tartness and barnyard. Very well done."
"Overall a very nice raspberry wild ale. A bottle or two could be finished easily in a sitting if one had money to burn. Perfect candidate for pairing with cheeses and charcuterie."
"A unique beer from a great brewery for a great cause! Love that they have throttled the release this year so that geeks like me get a shot at buying it."
"O: This aroma of this beer is amazing. It is like diving into a basket of fresh raspberries. I was really surprised at how mouth puckering this beer was, but it added that feel of eating a tart raspberry. This beer was quite amazing, and is probably one of the best sours i have had so far."
"O: Good but not great, would strongly prefer a funky geuze, pleasant, somewhat one dimensional"
"M: Smooth, bright, moderate carbonation, light acidity in the finish, light-to-medium body."
"Appearance= 4.5 Smell= 4.5 Taste= 4.5 Mouthfeel= 4.5 Overall= 4.5"
"overall i could not say enough good things about this beer. a massivily wonderful addition that i really wish i could try more of. this was just amazing."
"Overall: This brew is greater than the sum of its parts!"
"I wish the fruit were a little fresher, because it just doesn't hold up as well as I expected. It's almost more about the citrus acidity at this point. Still, a real pleasure. I look forward to trying this again someday."
"3.5/4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0"
"D - Very easy to drink and tasting. I think the rarity and fact it is RR bumps it up just slightly in a lot of reviews, but this is a great beer I'd love to drink again."
"drinkability is great. good balance. nice depth. this one perhaps suffers from being consumed right after the stellar framboos, so i'm trying not to hold that against it. i like the brighter aspect that it brings."
"D: Super stupid easy to drink. I was fortunate enough to try a Cantillon Lou Pepe framboise early last year and although I didn't rate it, I remember it fondly. While this was very good, I don't think it quite compared to the Cantillon. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this stuff brewed in the future and potentially making its way up here for sale at the bottle shops in Portland. I would definitely buy up some of those bottles."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"Loved it. Pity it's so rare. The mouthfeel is superb."
"D: I'm really thankful to have gotten the chance to have this one as there was a bit of craziness when it first debuted. I have to say though, this one lives up to the hype. An amazing creation by Vinny and his team. Worth the trouble to seek out."
"D - Quite a bit different from batch one, with far more fruit and less 'wild' character. I think I liked Batch 1 a tiny bit more, but still a quality brew."
"D - So easy to drink and very enjoyable. Not mind-blowing but then again, it's solid enough to be enjoyed for exactly what it's advertised to be. Recommend, another winner from RR."
"Pours a glowing pink/salmon with a bright white head. Some little floating chunks here though the bottled was calm and upright for 2-3 months. Nose is vibrant, funky, and bright. Some light manure and citrus fruits, light raspberry. Very nice, fresh, bright on the nose. Mouth is at first very sour. It's all about the base beer here (Beatification?) and not much about the berries. In fact the berries act mostly to muddle and confuse the Beatification. A fair amount of lemon in the mouth, some salt edges in. The fruit just struggles with the sharp sourness of the base beer, which lends to a lack of balance in the flavor profile. Awesome nose, awesome base beer, but this was a bit of a disappointment. Looking forward to future batches as I think Vinnie will hone it in."
"Overall, this was a great sour from RR. The raspberries used very excellent and it was very drinkable. It was definitely a treat to have. Sour, tart, and fruity. Awesome stuff. Thanks Kevin for sharing this one."
"Bottle. Big, big thanks to EliottJW from BA for grabbing this one for me. Poured into a tulip glass a very bright, vibrant reddish grapefruit color with a with fluffy head. Some yeast sediment floating around. Did someone say raspberries were in this?! The aroma is strong tart raspberry with some underlying brett like florals. Light mouthfeel. Holy tartness batman! The raspberry tartness takes center stage on this with some additional notes of barrel and floral. Highly carbonated but surprisingly it doesn't take away from the flavor of the beer. This is such a nice drinking beer, clean and crisp with strong fruit and sour qualities. An excellent beer!"
"Definitely an experience that I am glad I shared with petesuphi, cmurren25, Jwiss22 and therealnomayo. I think the CA BAs are too critical of some of the ridiculous beers that have been produced in their state."
"This is just another sign to me that Russian River is frozen in time from about 5 years ago, or perhaps on the decline. While RR certainly blazed the trail; many US brewers (Cisco, Allagash, Ithica, Lost Abbey, Cascade, Upland) are in the process of leaving, or have left, Russian River behind."
"This beer was a bit more hype than I care for but the cause is definitely worth it."
"D: Very refreshing and easy to drink. I liked the bottle of Beatification I had better, but this is one of RR's better sours, and a fantastic beer all around that should get better with a little age. Definitely worth seeking out if you have the ammo."
"D-its really really tasty. i could drink this all night long."
"This exceeded my expectations, another truly great sour from RRBC."
"Overall: Reminiscent of a drier, funkier Lost Abbey Framboise de Amorosa. A complex and delicious American sour fruit beer."
"D: Nothing wrong with this one, as you would expect from a Russian River wild ale. I'm glad they'll be making this again as I'd love to get my hands on some next year."
"EDIT: I've had the pleasure of sampling a few more bottles since my review. I like it more and more each time. I don't know if it's just developing well or if bottles vary, but my impression rises steadily. I wish this weren't so rare."
