4.66,1.5,5,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.75,"Very impressive! Sort of reminded me of supplication but the Michigan peaches made me like this that much more. Despite being close to 2 years old, the peaches could not have tasted any more fresh and everything about this beer just seemed so fresh. Very nice blend of fresh peaches, oak, bourbon, leather, and supposedly horse (not a flavor familiar to me, just reading from the label). Would like to obtain another bottle in the future or if I'm lucky enough to try the elusive vsb.","blockdude","Mar 28, 2015"

Lots of fresh peach flesh in the taste, again, not overly tart and sour, somewhat earthy and mulchy, leather and a little farmhouse. Also some almond in there; wonder if they left the pits in the peaches. Body was medium, mouthfeel wasn't really crisp like I prefer in beers like this, more chewy, with a toned-down acidity.

Pours dark hazy orange with a big fluffy off white head that sticks around a bit with some big bubbles. Aroma is insane fresh peaches, even feels like I can smell the peach fuzz, a bit of dry oak, then more juicy peaches. Flavor follows with a lightly sour fresh peach flavor, hints of oak throughout, just a tad bit of bourbon, a light sweetness. The tart-sweet-dry balance here is rather incredible.

Very artificial.  Taste follows the nose a bit along with a very slight tartness.  I would not call this beer sour at all.

4.25,-7.4,,,,,,"This reeked of peaches and was extremely fruity, par for the course for new glarus. Taste was bright and champagne-like at first, but never kicked in with a substantial tartness or acidity. Peach flavor prominent throughout, but the lack of acid made it unbalanced and a little watery. This drinks great now, but should improve in the upcoming months.","MCain04","Aug 25, 2014"

4.85,5.7,,,,,,"The nose on this beer is unreal.  It smells like canned peaches, a fresh bag of peach rings, and the freshest peach flesh you've ever picked from an orchard.  Really hard to not just keep smelling this beer.  The color of the beer looks like caramelized peaches in a cobbler.  Light brown essentially.  Nice wispy carb throughout.  You get that distinct natural fermentation smell and taste that really set these open fermentation beers apart.  Really light lemony tartness and a rich peach flavor.  Not as much peach as the nose, but as much as I've ever had from a beer.  The carb carries the flavor perfectly and this beer does nothing but get better as it warms.  This isn't big on sour.  It's a naturally fermented beer with some light funk and some tartness.  Seek this beer out if you love peaches, not if you desire tongue-buckling sourness.","PHBoiler","Aug 17, 2014"

4.55,-0.9,,,,,,"Pours a deep orange with some haziness and generous bone white head.  Nose is chock full of candied peach.  Bright and sweet peach flesh notes with a touch of sugar and a hint of lactobacillus in the background.  The aroma is fantastic!  The taste starts with notes of wild yeast, then comes the sour brown base.  Light malty notes are followed by moderate tartness and then the finish is all peach.  Again, fresh and bright peach notes with a clean and slightly sweet finish. The acidity on this is mild for a sour beer, but I get the sense that age will bring on a more forward tartness.  Mouthfeel is medium with a moderate to high level of carbonation (no gushing as the special warning stated was possible).  Overall, a very successful peach brew.  Probably falls a bit short of Fuzzy, but either way, one of the best peach beers around.","homebrew311","Beers"

4.82,5,4.5,5,4.75,5,4.75,"O - Rumors circulated around the long lines leading up to procuring this rare beer on a hot Saturday at New Glarus that it was "OK"; that it wasn't bold with peach presence or as sour as their previous R&D release, Very Sour Blackberry. Simply put, those rumors are false - ok, maybe it's not quite as sour as VSB, but they're different beers. New Glarus' Wild Peach, a sour fruit beer from THE fruit beer master, Dan Carey, is rich with fresh peach aroma and flavor so pungent, it's like biting into a real peach. Underlying maltiness provides a complex and delicious base for the wild yeast's playground; funky, sour, and refreshing, this unique and flavorful beer is where it's at.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 10, 2014"

This has really evolved over the past year to develop more of an acidity and funk without any fading of the peach flavours. Incredibly, the aroma smells very Fou' Foune-like, and if you know how I like my beers, that's high praise. It doesn't follow as well on the palate, but it's still very peach forward and funky. I highly recommend this beer without reservation. It will likely continue to drink very well from here on.","Stevedore","Aug 09, 2014"
