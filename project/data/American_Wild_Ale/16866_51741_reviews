"On tap at The Bruery poured into taster. Appearance is cloudy golden-orange with a thin white head that leaves spots on the drink down. Aroma is sour grapes, white wine vinegar, cherries, funky, tart, oaky and spicy as well thanks to the barrels and rye. Lots going on. Taste delivers on the sourness from the nose, with a forceful blast of initial tartness - citrus, cherry, grape - followed by a mellow vanilla sweetness, rye spice on the swallow, and a touch of oak bitterness in the finish. Medium body, a little creamy, moderate carbonation, long puckering dry finish."

"This beer was phenomenal. I was fortunate enough to get a bottle last night, and wasn't sure what to expect, but it was amazing. Do yourself a favor, and if you see it pick up a bottle."
"Had at brewery the bruery...awesome sour. Perfect expensive tasting round though. But worth it"

"This is an complex beer which balances and blends a variety of different elements into a excellent whole.  Sourness is noticeable but not intense like say a Love Child.  I suspect that cellaring this for a few years would deepen the sour flavors."

"Tasted 2012 reserve.  Beautiful orange color with good clarity with slight head.  Prominent sweettart flavor with woody finish.  Fruit showing through reminiscent of kiwi and lemon flavors."

"This is an excellent sour ale ... surprise, surprise. Very nice feel, puckering sourness, and some good complexity. I'd like to get another bottle some time and age it for about three years and see what happens to it. My bottle was relatively ""fresh"" at just 11 months old."
"While some reviewers felt that Sour in the Rye is an overwhelmingly sour and acidic wild ale, I found it to be remarkably complex and amazingly well balanced. In fact, this is definitely one of the best wilds I have tried in quite some time. I would love to lay down a bottle or two and see how the beer ages, but my guess is that it peaks after only a year of cellaring."

"Poured a gorgeous translucent reddish orange body with a finger and a half of foamy pinkish head. Very nice looking. Scents of sour cherry, wild, barnyard funk, stone fruit, and sweet, tart red berries along with slight oak. Overall impression is of a nice sour aroma that is fruity and nicely funky. Very nice. Flavor begins moderately sour with notes of sour cherry, Brett funk and a bit of spicy rye, along with hints of oak. This moves into a still sour middle, with further notes of cherry, and a bit of spicy rye, with oak still present. Finish is dry and moderately high in sourness with notes of sour cherry and berries and oak. Aftertaste is sour, with notes of sour cherry, berries, especially raspberries, a bit of oak and a hint of spicy rye and grainy malt. Overall impression is of a nicely sour, dry and fruity beer with a nice oak presence and funk. Very nice and quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation, and a drying, puckering feel. Quite nice and very drinkable. Overall this is a good sour ale. It has a wonderful aroma and flavor profile that is fruity, funky, oaky and slightly spicy with a nice mouthfeel that aids the drinkability. Highly recommended."

"Medium body and heavily carbonated with fine carbonation that is very gentle on the tongue, keeping the beer very drinkable."

"This is a world class sour. I get sour, sour, and more sour, with a slight vinegar aftertaste. The vinegar is very mild, and not the taste stealing the show. The rye comes in slowly, but it's there providing a great layering.  Faint lemon juice, but this is a puckering masterpiece."

"Wow! This is goodgoodgood! The sourness sets you up for the vanillin from the oak as well as the rye spice. Can’t drink just one! The lack of head is typical of the wild sours, at least the ones that I have had the good fortune to try, but is still detrimental to the overall enjoyment."

"The taste is very sour with excellent depth - after the initial shock of just how sour this beer is, it really begins to show off. I would definitely recommend it for fans of sours, but newbies will want to stick to less-intense varieties. After having tried only one of The Bruery's other sour offerings (Tart of Darkness), I have to say that I will be on the lookout for others."

"Pours a nice reddish, brownish beer. Has very little foam forming at the top. Smells like bretts. Taste is sour, raspberries and tart fruits, and then the rye comes in strongly. It adds a dimension that reminds me of whisky."

" Bravo!"
"Pours crystal brown. Moderate carbonation. Good for this style beer. Aromas of slightly fermented red fruits, aged malts and sourdough. After the first sip I couldn't say anything for about a minute because of how much saliva the acidity drew out. The taste started with super high acidity but gradually gave way to nice integrated malt with an amazing long finish."

"O.A. definitely worth ever dollar, with I had a few more bottle for the cellar and wanting to seek out more by these guys, a bit spendy but sure beats many other sours I've had for the same price or more!"

"Overall this is an incredible sour with a great level of tartness. Hard to believe there isnt any fruit in here with how much flavor there is. Good job yeasties."
""
"Had this on draft at Bruery Pint night at Columbia Ale House. Similar to style there was very little head to speak of. Excellent smell but not quite the bang of some. Then the taste, wow, excellent. Made me pucker which was awesome and enjoyable. One of the top Sours I have had and one I would love to have again. The sour was very comparable to the Tart of Darkness which I had last night. Great beer and a must try if you like sours."

"Great sour- nice and puckery, with lots of citrus and tart flavors, but with a slightly soft finish with a touch of creaminess- so it doesn't feel as if it's taking the enamel off of your teeth. Good long finish with just a touch of sweet citrus at the end. The most intriguing part of the beer, though, is the touch of spicy rye that intermingles with the sourness- it's definitely there as an undercurrent to the more pronounced sour flavors. The rye really adds something here and rounds the whole thing out. Very enjoyable beer from a great brewery."

"Very frothy head, crests around one finger, almost entirely extra large bubbles so it’s gone like that, no meaningful lacing to speak of. Strong glow to the liquid, really captures light inside the glass, gauzy rust orange to yellow in color, filled with very fine, microscopic bubbles. The nose is laser like in its precision, tart lemon to orange citrus, moss, forest floor matter, white pepper, caraway seeds, mostly green apple and pear fruit, a little peach pit, needs to warm to get the most out of the rye but even then not getting much oak element, glimmer of caramel, its muscular nature keeps it loitering for some time. Medium-bodied, the sourness and overall bite activates the palate right off while here the oak brings some textural creaminess in addition to vanilla and butter notes. Even dill weed, as created by some American oak barrels. There is a certain volatility to it, like an anxious finger tapping. Again, loads of sour grapefruit, lemon, orange citrus. Rye bite, sourdough bread, dried yeast, nothing “doughy” or uncooked. Close to peaty at times, definitely earthy and evokes the “sous bois” character. Carbonation is delicate, does not distract from intentional sourness. Green apple, pear, cherry, apricot fruit, more snap and crackle than juiciness. Linear and angular finish, no soaking into the palate, zips across the tongue. Refreshingly easy to drink."

"Bottle from Tipples. Pours a nearly clear dark orange color with a one finger off white head. Sour lacto dominates the nose with some apricot, peach, and a little white vinegar. Not the peach version but still has some of those notes. Really nice. Flavor is a nice crisp sour green apple, with plenty of lacto and big acidity. Some light fruits and a hint of spice in there dancing around, and a clean dry finish. Light to medium mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation. Really awesome sour here."

"An amazing blend of sour fruit, barnyard funk and spicy sweetness. If this wasn't $20, I could drink this all the time. Definately gotta grab a few more for the long haul. Intense and complex, but somehow simple and easy."
""
"Wondering what one of these would taste like if aged for a year or two but satisfied nonetheless. Also hoping to get the chance at some point to try a sour in the rye with peaches or other fruit as that might be where it lacks in the taste."
""
""
""
""
"Another case of a beer not being on my radar (in this case, was looking for Bottleworks XII but alas). Mouth puckeringly tart with lots of oak and strong white wine presence. Very tannic with an acidity that feels right at home. Quite the surprise."

"Pours a clear polished copper, thick offwhite head, big splotches of lace on the glass. Smell: acetic soured apricot, vinous, oak barrel, herbal brett. Taste: unripe green apple, acetic, apricot, white grape, faint vanilla note, dill-ish herbal note. Medium bodied, puckering, tasty."

"A reasonably well executed and interesting beer for the sour lover that falls a bit short. This beer is short on depth and the flavors do not support the level of acidity. Glad I tried it but I will not return."

"Appearance is copper like/wild ale looking..smell is funky with alittle sweetness, somewhat subued, not complex aromas. Taste is strickingly sour all the way through, (what i expect from a sour) nice citrus and like rind flavor, woth the barrel pulling this through..mouthfeel is light..carbonation is medium..leaves a nice feeling on the toungue from the dry fruity flavor and sour appeal..not sweet at all. Overall a well executed beer with enough sour notes and barrel influence. Nice for a sipper on a hot summer day/night. Refreshing for a sour..pair with dried fruit, stinky cheeses, watermelon/fruity salads.."

"A golden body with a beautiful reddish hue, massive lacing. A massive nose that is dry, spicy with lots of acidic citrus and a massive tart/sour aroma, slightly sweet. The palate is sour and acidic; a bit salty. The rye keeps the malt dry and spicy, the sweetness in the nose is absent on the palate. Not much oak. It finishes long and tart. Medium body and carbonation. Wow, a really nice brew; super tight."

"O: I love it. Highly recommended. Will have again. Very competent and enjoyable example of the style."
"If you think about it, actual fruits are typically somewhat tart as well as sweet; this is true, to varying degrees, of apples, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, plums, currants, etc. American Wild Ales like Sour in the Rye simulate the fruits of Mother Nature's labours (pun intended) and, using another wonder of nature (wild yeast), simply amp up the tart part. What a treat!"

""
""
""
""
""

"The taste of rye and sour is a challenging attempt as both types are highly polarizing and not widespread just yet. But its added complexity is undeniable taste that's salty, briney and deeply earthen."
""
"Somewhat of a one dimensional sour, has everything you would expect in a good sour, but lacks any extra complexity. Still top notch and worthy of a bottle for the cellar, still another well made beer from the bruery."

"Almost identical to the Sour with Cumquats, without the citrusy twist. No discernible difference between tap and bottle."
""
"Tastes very fruity with plenty of apples and pear. The sourness is very apparent and strong with acetic acid. Very little if any rye impact. A touch of sweetness on the end with maybe some sour cherry. Mouthfeel is on the lighter sid of medium with lively carbonation that seems to increase the impact of the sourness. A truly wild sour ale with the acid overtaking some of the subtleties."
""
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2013. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, pear, clove, pepper, oak, vinegar, hay, straw, funk, red wine, leather, bread, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of tart fruity/spicy/funky lacto with wine barrel notes; and great strength. Taste of big sour cherry, green apple, pear, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, vinegar, red wine, leather, bread, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, pear, clove, pepper, oak, vinegar, hay, straw, red wine, leather, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of sour fruity/funky lacto, wine barrel, and malt flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp, smooth, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane wild ale! All around fantastic complexity and balance of sour fruity/funky lacto with balanced malt and wine barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. An amazing offering."

"Very awesome stuff, if you're into puckeringly sour and vinegar-laden wild ales. This brew isn't for everyone, but it's certainly for me. Although it's sometimes hard to justify spending nearly 20$ for a bottle of beer, I think I can easily make a case in my mind to keep a few bottles of Sour in the Rye stocked at all times, when I'm in the mood for something white wine-y and sour."

"Poured an almost light brown with one finger tan head that died quick without much lace on top of an aroma that has a touch of sweet or tropicalesque fruit but also a large sour and tartness to it (want to say cherry b/c that's first thing that comes to mind). Medium bodied, not chewey but a little filling, the rye helps smooth out as well, this beer has a crisp feel and dry finish that perfectly complements and balance the sourness of the beer, and the spiciness and very mild sweetness of the beer helps round it out. A complex brew that I can't really get a handle on but know I like and a great beer for all to try."

"O: I wish this beer turned down the acidity just a tad - to let all the subtle notes come out a bit more. I think there could even be some malt sweetness underlying, but that's hard to get as well. But, it is very good. Give this to someone that appreciates good beer and wine for that matter. They will enjoy it."

"O: Not the type of beer I would want to drink every day, but damn tasty. The sourness is up front and potent. The rye is awesome as a balance to the sourness, it adds a spice that cuts right through."

"This pours a hazy caramel-amber with thin foam. There’s a sharply tart and sour touch of funk, with a hint of wet hay backing it up. Tastes zesty, spicy and vibrant—I know that’s not a flavor description per se but that was what ran through my mind while sipping. This beer definitely lives up to its name as it finishes sour, tart, acidic with a dry end. Wow."
"O: Amazing sour brew!"

"O: Very nice."
"Pours a clear mandarin hue with one finger head and some subtle lacing here and there,the smell is mandarins,spicy rye,slight oak,tangerine and an ever present woodiness usually only smelt in fine wines,the mouthfeel is light bodied and a touch spritzy but spot on and the tastes are mouth puckering sour with hints of tangerine,mandarin,a slight hit of spicy rye,cheddar and finished with a nice hit of oak and sour citrus and overall it's a beauty of a beer that I would definitely drink again and be nice to age to bring out more of the oak quality and this delicately tasted quite fresh cheers."
"O- Really impressed with this sour. Haven't had too many of The Bruery's sour beers, this one did everything i was hoping it would. Refreshing, sour, cant taste the alcohol at all. Glad i have this bottle to myself."

"One of the more sour beers out there. Not particularly complex at all, but very good at what it does bring to the table. Don't know if this is worth $22 a bottle but this is a very good American wild. If you like sours, it's worth trying at least once.. if you don't like sours, please do not buy this beer."

"Pours dark copper with 1/8 inch white foam. Oaky notes, woody. Powerful sour flavor, from the very start. Puckering tart. Hints of the advertised rye. Profoundly sour from start to finish. Full of flavor. The oak really lends a great balance. Fantastic."

"D - This is arguably the most well balanced and smoothest American Wild Ale or Sour Ale that I have ever encountered... It's smooth, sophisticated and deeply complex... I can't say a single made thing or make any suggestions for improvement... Probably the single best beer I have had from the Bruery... I highly recommend and suggest any BA to seek out and enjoy..."

"O. This is an increadibly flavorful sour. The rye is very much underneath, which is dominated by the rye. But the aftertaste is very much flavorful and true to the label."

"Like all sours from The Bruery, this one is very aggressive in its acidity and does not hold back. I don't think I taste much of the rye spiciness, as it seems completely overpowered by the force of the sour flavor. Nevertheless, this is one of the better American-made sours I have had that is not from Russian River. Despite the price, I will likely buy this again the next time it is released. It is definitely worth revisiting, but it's not for those who are new to sour beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"If there is to be a new world challenger to the throne of Cantillon, then this may be it. It's a little too bad that they had to throw in a rye component here, because it sadly goes unloved, seeing as it doesn't prick the tongue as harshly as the yeast and acid so capably do. Once acclimated, a caveat hardly used this side of the pond, this is generally palatable, but methinks for the wrong reasons, at least a tad, I suppose."
""
""
"Amber color, hazy, medium-frothy head. Canned apricots, acetic acid, a hint of biscuit. On the palate, quite sour, mostly lactic acid, but there is still some malt backbone to balance. Alcohol well integrated and doesn't stand out. Texture is creamy, with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer from The Bruery, certainly in league with any of the Russian River wild ales. Just barely worth the high price tag."

"I'm still just dabbling in these sours so while this isn't something that I'm going to necessarily crave it was an enjoyable departure from my typical big stout and IPA routine.

"O: On these kind of occasions, I can totally justify spending $20+ on a bottle of sour ale (because YOLO 'n' shit) only for yours truly to consume solo. Thankfully this is good enough where I could easily justify doing such a thing again. Actually, it's pretty fantastic where I'd purchase this somewhat commonly...goddamnit, I've been suckered in by another sour ale. STOP DRAINING MY WALLET DRY, DELICIOUS YET EXPENSIVE STYLE!"
""
""
""
"Overall, a wonderful sour. The spiciness from the rye isn't as present as I'd hoped it would be, but it's there if you hunt for it. I would drink this quite a bit if I lived in the San Diego area, but there is a local wild ale that reminds me a great deal of this one that is much easier to get."

" The taste is very lactic acid infused with a saliva starting taste up front with some lemon and greek yogurt like tangy flavors with a slight citurs juiciness and mild grain tinge in the back with interesting spice quality and dry finish. Overall this is a super sour wild beer which is not for the timid - it is pretty easy to drink considering how sour it is though."

"Sour in the Rye is very, very impressive beer! It delivers. It’s not too sour, not too funky…just right. It features a rockin’ flavor profile that’s deep and very tasty. Find a bottle. Definitely worth seeking out!"

"The beer pours an amber orange with syrupy colors and a nice finger-width head of creamy tiny bubbles. The beer’s body is clear and practically crystal clean with just a slight haze from the malt and yeast. The beer’s head leaves a lacing sticky dots and strings. On the nose the beer smells like a light gueuze, with beautiful funk and cherry leather notes and a faint tinge of spice. The smell is not as strong as a gueuze, but it is still beautiful and funky. Leather is definitely the dominant smell in the nose, but it is paired with a sweeter funk and some light spicy rye. On the tongue, the beer tastes funky sweet with a light underlying rye spice and some nice acidity. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, fruity funk that moves into distinguished leather notes that stick to the tongue and only give light hints of cherry. There is an underlying spice from the rye which is light and bready, but I honestly can’t say if I would have noticed it unless the beer specifically had “Rye” in the name. The funk does hit almost cloying notes as it builds, touching citric lemon and some slight pineapple notes in the start of the taste. The finish is sweet lemon citrus with a touch of leather and then a final burp of spicy rye with a faint touch of bread and chocolate. In the mouth, the beer is medium plus in body with a creamy carbonation and a great citric pucker at the end without the citric bite. This beer feels really nice in the mouth. Overall this beer is a terrific sour with a great mouthfeel that doesn’t bite the hell out of your mouth with acid. This is a very balanced and tasty sour. Try this beer, but share it. It is worth the money."

"O- 6/10 sourness. very tasty sour with big cherry notes. Sit was as sour as I thought it would be from the first whiff of the beer, but very smooth. I just wish this beer was about $5 cheaper."

"Poured into Bruery snifter. Appearance is a reddish orange with nice clarity and significant head upon pour. Head dissipates to a collar and leaves some lacing. The nose is complex and oaky with heavy tart fruit, notes of peach and cherries along with a touch of rye malt on the finish. The taste is super tart from start to finish with nice underlying fruit and oak character. The rye is subtle but adds a nice complexity to the sour profile. Mouthfeel is effervescent with medium body. This is a deliciously sour ale and definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
"O: All in all, this is a sour beer at heart; the oak and rye simply smooth out the rough edges and wrap it all up in a neat little package. Its darkness reminds me of an Oud Bruin – one of my favorite styles – but with a punch that will leave you reeling. Be warned: this one is addictively sour."
""
""
""
""
"O-Another stellar sour from The Bruery, expensive but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"An interesting ghost flavor of the malt brew this used to be, before the bacteria were turned loose. Just plain sour, but it has a lingering grainy and faintly hoppy taste. Not much for drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one definitely makes you pucker up a little bit from the tartness/sourness but yet this remains one of the most drinkable sour beers I have had - and I am a fan of sour beers. There is a great complexity of the flavors in the sourness. I found this one real easy to drink but I needed to sip it."
"O: The beer is quite easy to drink for a sour beer but is pleasant to sip."

"O - another great sour from The Bruery. Not super complex, but quite tasty with a very pleasant aroma."
""
"I use this site often but rarely review beers, i love this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall. A really nice sour, better than I was expecting for some reason. Probably because the rye wasn't so pronounced and there was a ton of fruit flavour."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm quite mad at myself. I picked this up at the Blue Dog in Chalfont, and this has been on their tap list for some time. It's probably done now. Had I known I'd of stopped every day after work and had 2 or more. One of the best sours I've had, and I will certainly be ordering this whenever and wherever I can."
""
""
"O: This is one of my new favorite sours. It holds up really well against the more well-known sours from producers like Crooked Stave and NB. It has a unique, fruity flavor profile that is propped up by an excellent malt base. Great job Bruery - I'll be purchasing more if I see it again."
""
""
"Lots of tannic grapeskin in the taste, bracing acidity that gets the salivary glands into overdrive. Fruity and sour with some acetic acid and malt character in the middle. Dry and puckering, medium bodied with balance carbonation. Overall nice to try, though not overly complex, it fills the sour fix."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a super solid sour beer, just don't expect very much in the rye department. If you like sour beer, it is still very worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks Wisconsin!"
""
"Overall, a really enjoyable and tasty sour ale from the Bruery. It is really nicely balanced and the fruit notes given off are really enjoyable. The sourness is not overdone at all. The rye doesn't really give off much in the way of rye spiciness, but I don't really miss that type of character in this beer. A bit on the pricey side, but really tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall very nice, very little rye, but great lambic like sour fruit and tartness, good funk overall, juicy fruit, light barrel notes, very tasty."
"O: A great sour brewed without the addition of fruit. I am partial to the sours with added fruit, but Sour in the Rye manages to impress me with the breadth and harmony of its nuances."
""
""
""
""
""
"A really really good sour beer though not as complex or nuanced as many nor priced economically (I paid 19.99). I still like this one a lot but after half a bottle, I've convinced myself to not get another bottle anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
"B+"

"O: Still, Oude Tarte is the one to beat. This was quite good and worth the price tag over. Not sure I was age a bunch of bottles though."

""
""
""
"Didn't think I was gonna get such an easy second chance with this beer, much less on tap, but here we are. It pours a hazy amber topped by a couple fingers of cream foam. The nose comprises soft cheese, tart berries, light wine grapes, and a bit of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a strong semi-lactic sourness pervading quite nicely. It's strong, but you get to keep some of your enamel if you do things right. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice sour, though I'm unsure whether or not the coriander ahd much impact, if any. Just sayin'. Good times, though."
""
"Would recommend!"
"Overall (5/5): This is undoubtedly one of the best sour ales I have ever had. Perhaps only bested by the Bruery's Oude Tart, it is a beer to seek out if you're into the sour stuff."
""
""
""
"O: this probably the second most sour beer I have ever had (behind motherfunker) but that is a good thing. It is also extremely easy to drink as it has a sweetness to balance the sour to make it like candy and rye to make those flavors all balance out plus the feel adds to it. Overall I'm very impressed and highly recommend despite the high price tag in some markets"
"Unreal good. Like a sour rock and rye. Killer beer. I need a solid Bruery connection because of beers like this."

"D - Great rye and sour beer. Great complexity and balance."
"O-Excellent AWA. Great balance of flavor and tartness. Probably pick up a few more of these to see what a little age does to them."

"I flat out loved this beer. It's really sour and mouth watering with great flavor."

"This poured out as a hazy amber color with a thin white head on top. The retention and lacing fade completely. The smell of the beer has a heavy amount of funk and tart fruity aromas. The taste is very big, lots of sour fruity flavors followed up with a malty rye finish. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and dry, nicely carbonated. Smooth and drinkable. Overall this beer is very good. There is a light medicinal taste I'm getting the more it sits on my tongue, regardless still worthy of trying."
""
"O: It's quite good. it's not overly sour but it has a nice pucker to it, good flavors and a solid complexity."

"Overall: Smells amazing and has a nice flavor and complexity in there somewhere underneath the sourness but it was tough to finish a 10oz pour and now my stomach lining is being eaten away."
""
"O-This is another enjoyable Bruery sour beer. It is not as complex or impressive as Oude Tart, but it provides a nice punch of sour with a reasonably complex and integrated flavor. I also find it to be a good looking beer. I don't know if it is worth $22, but I would drink this again for the right price."

"O-one of the best wild ales I've ever had. The quality in this sort of ale does not get higher. Tying new Bruery beers is such a joy, and beers like this remind me why it's one of my favorite breweries. I was craving a wild ale, and this beer will keep me satisfied for a long time."

"this one is really really sour, and I like it a lot. the pour is cloudy and orange, looking more like funky soda than beer, with its huge bubbles rushing to the surface and fizzy white head. the nose is pungently sour, holy cow! wow, I don't smell hardly any rye malt, or really anything much but lacto acidic sourness and tangerines, a funny combo for a beer I expected to be far more woody. the taste is also sour all the way through, but there is a dab of rye spice right in the middle, which makes for a unique sensation in the mouth. my roommate jeff described it as a mega sour warhead candy, which isnt that far off. there is also a ton of fruit to the finish of this, not sweet at all, but almost like if sour patch kids were made from real fruit like cranberries and oranges. tart and sour at the same time, not as bretty or oaky as it might have been, but the sour lingers on long after the beer is swallowed. this one came across a little sloppy to me compared to say the white oak or the smoking wood, which to me are calculated masterfully. this is a bit more hodgepodged, but it ends up being a pretty tasty final product. dry in feel, medium in body, excessively carbonated. all up this is something very unconventional, and if you like sours give it a shot. price point is brutal though, being over 20 bucks."
""
""
"Overall this is a top notch American wild. I am usually a fan of funky sours but this does a good job balancing the sourness with other flavors like oak and vanilla. If you like sours this is definitely one to pick up."
""
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a cloudy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head that stayed around for a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, the brew smells like lemon, peaches, oak, some funk and an overall tart fruity aroma. The brew tastes like lemon, sour cherries, peaches, apricots, and some vinegar, vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has a good amount of carbonation. I don't pick up any rye in this beer, but maybe it's overpowered by the tart/sourness that's in it. I think it's a good sour brew, I'd like to try this again. It's pricey at $19.99 a bottle, but I'd buy it again. Definitely worth trying!"
""
""
"Overall: Good sour from the Bruery, though as is the case with a lot of their beers, the price tag ($21.99) will make it difficult to justify a repeat purchase."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would like to see something more in the middle with this beer to balance out the acetic tartness but I suspect many sour lovers would disagree as it certainly hit the hot buttons for a tongue assault"
""
""
"Murky auburn capped with some patchy white foam that dissolves to pretty much nothing. Tart, dusty fruit aroma...berries, sweet cherries, vinous notes, ripe fruit, light citrus. More floral as it warms. Super sour, acidic tartness, lactic notes, fruit, mild lemon, and cherry juice. No rye anywhere, as far as I can tell. Very dry and tart. Not the most complex sour, but quite enjoyable. Kind of Flanders sour-ish."
""
""
"Overall It's not particularly complex brew, but a solid fruit bodied ""sour"" beer. I wish I could say more about it, but unfortunately that's about all there is."
"Oh My! The Bruery has knock it out of the park. This beer gets started from its sexy looks, then draws you near with its insanely amazing odors. Then you actually get to drinking it, and I have never tasted a beer that so completely encompasses your entire mouth. From front to back this little bad boy reels you in. I have never tasted a mid-section so complete and mind blowing. From its parts that are amiable and tender like a cider, to that last little note of twangieness flexing that tiny muscle under your jaw bone; this bitch comes through like clutch free throw shooter being giving the ball in the last seconds of the game. You know they are going to foul, but you know those points are as good as already on the board."
""
""
"Have had this in multiple variations, year to year, on tap etc. . . and they've always been good and consistent. Very good. One of my favorites, can't wait to try the peaches version!"
"The price of $19.99 is also way too high to pay for a beer of this quality. It has to be a solid 5.0 for that price. Cantillon is deserving of it; The Bruery is not."

"A great beer and one of the better sours they produce in my humble opinion."
""
"O- A nice sour overall, has great fruity and tart flavors and is very drinkable, I finished the bottle with little difficulty, this is definitely worth picking up."
"I poured from a bomber into a Cigar City snifter. The pour is hazy orange, light white head, no lacing. The aroma is sour apples, apple cider vinegar. The beer is acidic, tart, vinegary, lots of green apple notes, drying finish. The body is light, carbonation medium. A solid sour, I did not pick up much of the rye."
""

"O: One of the more impressive sours I have had recently. Still trying to wrap my head around the peach aromas and flavors I am picking up in this one. Fantastic beer."

"O- The aroma and the flavor are nice. The beer needs at least double the carbonation."
""
""

""
"Very unique brew, worth $25/750ml. Recommended even at that price point."

"I always held off on reviewing this one because I didn't actually believe it was as good as I thought it was. I wanted to sit down with a full glass of this beer and really contemplate it before giving it such high marks. A year after release, I'm finally doing just that, and this beer is exceptional. It's one of my favorite American sours. I suppose if I had to find a flaw, I'd want more funk, but the flavors that are here are just too extraordinary to worry about complaining about anything."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a really attractive deep gold. Frothy head that disappears pretty quickly leaving little to no lacing or head. The initial smell is of apricots and sour mash. The apricot smell weakens as it warms. Tastes exactly as it smells; slightly funky with a bit of apricot. I can barely detect the oak. The rye is also faint. Mouthfeel is medium. I really enjoyed this sour and look forward to getting more."

"Fairly standard issue stuff, & a pretty good brew. I'd have liked the rye to see its shadow more than it does. Can a brewery please make sours with some other tastes in them? That would great. 'Kthxbye."

"O - Sour, subtle wood and rye bread. Very nice."
"Fairly simple beer. Very good though, the light fruit element works well"

""
"Pours dark amber with a very thin white head. Nice aromas of brown sugar and toffee. balsamic vinegar, cherries. rye malt, and oak. Similar to the nose, lots of sweet and spicy rye, red wine vinegar, oak, currants, and cranberries. Kinda reminds me of Oude Tart, but with rye. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, with a medium body and fairly low carbonation. Another nice Bruery sour, the rye addition is quite nice."
""
"Overall an incredible wild ale. Get many if you can!"
""
"O: Overall, slightly more lactic than I like in an American Wild, but very good otherwise. There is a good butterscotch presence as it warms, a good caramel and toffee presence and other than that, may finish slightly syrupy and a little sweet on the negative side."
""
""
"D - Aroma was overall a bit better than the taste. Just not ambitious enough and a little too single note in the sourness. Worth a try though."

"Another nice sour from The Bruery, though I do prefer Mother Funker."
"O - Definitely brings something different to the sour arena. While it isn't my favorite sour, or even favorite sour from the Bruery, I can appreciate that they were doing something a bit different with this one."
"Hold your stash, as this is a reasonable way from peak."
"Pours an absolutely beautiful clear deep amber with a bright white heads that slowly dissipates. Aroma is sour lactic acid, green apples, light oak, and a nice sweet and spicy grainy scent. Wow, a beautifully balanced wild ale. The flavor is just perfect - it starts a bit slow with a bit of funk and oak, but throughout the swallow the lactic sour washes through and finishes very nice and dry. This is really well done. The rye lends a very subtle touch of spice and stays in the background, but is a welcome addition. Mouthfeel is a bit full for a sour but certainly doesn't detract. Carbonation is spot on. Overall, this is a home run for me. Very nicely done."
"Overall this beer would be something I would drink often, but unfortunately it doesn't make it out to these areas."

"The addition of rye to this sour beer really imparts a new dimension. Smoothness in the feel helps bring out the flavors well. Still though, a bit over-the-top sour for me with a touch too much vinegar. A decent beer overall but a bit lacking in the balance/flavor department."

"An initial sweetness greets the palate with juicy fruit notes of white grape rind and peach before quickly giving way to a lightly puckering tartness. Decadent and sour, but not enough to wear away at the palate. Instead, this drinks amazingly well for the style. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a gentle carbonation level. Finishes dry with notes of vinegar and fresh, oaky wood. I must admit, The Bruery is absolutely killing the Sour/Wild Ale category as of late. Chalk 'Sour in the Rye' up as another clear-cut winner."

"3.5 D: Tasty beer and nothing quite like it. I'll enjoy my other two bottles."

"Overall I have nothing bad to say about this beer. The sourness is middle of the road, the rye is also not overdone but definitely makes its presence know. All the key flavor components are perfectly in balance and make for a super solid American Wild Ale."

"I enjoyed this beer, but as my sparse words show, there wasn't a whole lot to say about it. Solid sour with a good contrast from the rye. Not bad, but not exceptional either."

"Sour in the Rye pours a relatively hazy amber, with prominent burnt orange highlights. The bone colored foam pillows up to three fingers in height, before displaying a surprising amount of head retention and lacing for a Wild Ale. The nose is reminiscent of a flanders red. There's plenty of cherry led dark fruits, oak, and acidic tartness. No real contribution from the rye here. The flavor profile does make room for some spicy earthy rye notes to emerge in the background, complementing the woodiness from the barrels. The sour aspect of the beer is a little more overpowering here, not leaving as much room for some of the fruit flavors to shine through. The body is a little creamier than normal for the style, while still being fairly dry. The carbonation is nice and bubbly, creating an interesting contrast with the body. While I wish the rye used for Sour in the Rye stood out some more at times, it still helps the Bruery make a very good wild ale with a bit of a unique twist."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a slight viscous feel to it from the rye inclusion. The alcohol is felt with a slight warmth and accenting fruity ester that is very well balanced. You can actually see how this brew is ""thicker"" than the norm with how the rising bubbles of carbonation have a hard time rising to the surface and do so very slowly. I will admit that I took a peek at the previous scores to this brew prior to trying it. I was pleasantly taken back at how much I enjoyed this. Anyone who was disappointed in this can gladly forward me any bottles that they purchased that they now regret having. I think this is fantastic."

"Batch 1 seems better than batch 2, but I wouldn't particular seek out either again."
""
"Pours a murky dark gold with a beige head that fades to nothing. Thin streaks of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is all kinds of funky, sour, and tart with a nice fruity presence as well. Taste is outstanding and is a perfect translation of the smell made better. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent sour that is just super tasty and super easy to drink."

"2012 Vintage. Pours an orangish-amber color that is very hazy and has a medium-large white head that diminishes rather quickly. Scent is quite lovely...smells like some fresh rye bread with some sour yeastiness. Spiciness perfectly blended with sour, wild yeast notes and barnyard funk. Some nice hoppiness in the nose as well. Taste is just as good as it smells. I was kinda nervous going into this one, due to the mixed reviews, but damn this is good. Perfect mix of rye bread and lacto flavors. Some white vinegar with fresh baked bread and bitter hops. The rye makes this beer have some spiciness after you get the tartness up front, but then it finishes sour. Very complex. Mouthfeel is very well-carbonated and medium bodied. Puckering. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a fantastic sour that I wish I was allowed to purchase more of. I was only allowed three bottles, but would gladly purchase more."
""
"D: This was a fantastic sour, with bold but delicate scent and taste. The body was great too, and the alcohol was well hidden. But the finish was really intense, so it must be sipped. Would age a very long time, but is already great fresh. Recommended."

"O: Not a bad offering, very curious to see how thing one progresses with age."
""
"Medium bodied but a bit thinner than expected with a balance of oak, funk, spice, rye, dark fruit and sweet malt. Slightly tart and puckering but more funky than sour. There's more acetone than the nose suggests but it isn't too overpowering or vinegar-y. Dry, toasted oak and lots rye flavor. This beer would probably be terrible if it wasn't for the rye but it counters the funk and acetone with a nice sweet and spicy character. This is complimented by some dark fruit and sweet malt. Finishes dry and tart with a touch more acetone. Overall, well balanced and flavorful but the acetone turns a beer that could be amazing into slightly above average."

"O: This is not a good beer. The lack of carbonation and the overpowering rye, did not make this drinkable at all. We had quite a few beers to get to, and I didn't want to waste my time or my palate on this train wreck. It went down the drain."

"Overall: I wasn't very impressed with this one, it is very one dimensional and I find the rye to be odd."

"Rating: 95 out of 100"
"Appearance is a cloudy orange tone with a short white head, kind of like part of some sunsets. Its` nose has cherry, sour apples and yeast present. There is tartness there, no question about it. It tastes of oak, spice, more of those fruits, and more of that tart aspect to it. Mouthfeel is at a medium level, fair carbonation level. An interesting sour from The Bruery and a pretty damn good one."
"I’m going to throw this out there, and I don’t say this lightly: Sour in the Rye is my favorite Bruery beer. The balance of spicy rye malt, tart bacteria and oak is just perfect. Like I said, I finished the whole bottle myself, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Glorious stuff."
"Overall: Very tasty. Very drinkable. The sour beer and the spice from the rye play well together. Very well balanced."
"Bottle from Hopscotch. Pucker up and get ready for a wild ride. This beer is full of awesome sourness. First I didn’t taste or smell any rye, but I didn’t care. From nose to mouth, I would say it was like sour tasting pop rocks in your mouth. The higher abv really helped give this beer some extra body but without the booze taste. This is a Top 3 American made sour and I would love to have another bottle."
"Decent enough, though a bit of an underperformer. A little more contrast would work wonders."
"O: Great stuff and finally a good use of a newly overused grain!"
"Very interesting, the texture is something completely else; luckily I knew what to expect from the rye, but it certainly threw my wife for a loop (she really likes light bodied lambics, and so this beer definitely doesn’t really appeal to here). I am definitely enjoying this beer, if for nothing else than its unique texture then so be it. There isn’t really a whole lot of complexity here; I would have expected that the rye would have added more wild graininess and spiciness to this brew and even the funkiness is focused on the lactic acidity rather than more wild notes from Brettanomyces or other wild-bugs that can produce a lot of “off” flavors. If there were a lot of sour, heavily laden rye beers out there this wouldn’t be much of a standout, but as it is there is not, so this is enjoyable for its relative uniqueness if nothing else; it is indeed an experience."
"I guess the majority of BA must really like drinking salad dressing. Or it's the rarity. Hard to tell."
"Ultimately, this beer is just overdone like nobody's business. Drinking a whole bottle is nigh on impossible, I'm going to have to make a salad dressing or something with this. I would not age this any longer as at this point, my bottle is already a lot more sourer than an of the C&C La Folie's I've had. This seems like a recent development as some of the early reviews mention balance, low sourness, neither of which are evident from this sample."
"Pours a orangish brown. A touch of white head. Looks fairly pretty. Smells spicy and tart. Not particularly sour on the nose or tongue. There is a spicy and sour burn that is really interesting. Tons of rye on. The tongue that combines nicely with nose. Fairly thick pn the tongue, not a lot of carbonation. Overall interesting but not something i would seek out"
"D: I'm not a huge fan of sours but this is one of the better ones I've had. Nice balance with the sourness and the rye malt."
"O - Good sour, but I really hope that the Bruery crew can figure out a way to cut back on the acetic qualities in their sours. These are all A beers but for the vinegar notes/taste. Maybe its the OC water?"
"Aroma is loaded with fruit, pears are dominant, as much as you would say blueberries are in blabaer, this has the most pronounced pear aroma and flavor I have ever come across. Light tartness builds as it comes up to room temperature giving you that horse funk you are looking for but keeping it light with tons of light grain and bready notes back building the pear and now light sour apple. Each sip seems to get even more complex then the one before. Rich pear and apple flavors, light sour notes, hints of grass and liht bready malts, complex as hell. Perfect carbonation, light, bubbly, full enough to coat the tonue, perfectly done with the abv so well hidden I thought it was 8 percent."
"Shared this one with the group at the ""Evening Wood"" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy red-orange with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and acetic acid. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk, and vinegar. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. It was also a REALLY big hit with the other who were tasting it as well. The look of this brew isn't that nice, but it definitely made up for this fact with the flavor and aroma without a doubt. Really wish I could have gotten multiple bottles of this from the Reserve Society this year, but I am glad I got to share this one with quite a few good BAs and others who appreciated it. Definitely worth your time to try or trade for."
"I knew I needed to try this beer as soon as I heard about it, I love the bruery and Catcher In the Rye. Pretty murky beer, very dark amber brown with a reddish hugh. Not such great head retention, just not the best looking beer. Strong aroma of dry oak and vinegar, very vinous. A very nice aroma with some grape skins and hints of sweet rye. Rye, yup its there in the flavor, but plenty more oak and vinous notes. A bit sharp and biting, with a great lactic sour character. My only critique is that this beer could have more depth and complexity. Dry, period. Just a great beer. I love Bruery sours and this does not disappoint, plus the bottle is awesome."
"O - This is a pretty solid beer, although not spectacular. It's sour enough that it makes it hard to drink tons of, but it was pretty enjoyable and I could drink it again."
"O - Not fantastic nor horrible, but it is certainly not something I would seek out. Very similar to Cigar City's Vuja De."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this. Any time I have the opportunity to try a new sour / wild ale, it's pretty exciting. This one delivered."
"o - Overall a pretty nice sour from The Bruery. Nose is pretty sour and funky and lots of brett in both the smell and taste."
"Would really like to see this with sour cherries similar to OT."
"O - One 4oz sample is enough for me here. This beer is (dare I say it) too acetic for me to enjoy all that much. It's not a bad beer, by any means, just a little over-the-top. Decent."
"The rye is a cool choice for this beer. It is interesting and very nice. Bright, mild acetic sourness, lots of woody Brettanomyces character in there. Really nice sour / funky beer from the Bruery."
"Sounds like having this on-tap remedies some of the issues I had with this one. Would like to try a glass at the Bruery some day."
"Bottle from our RS membership. Dark hazy orange pour, no carbonation and an aroma of acidic sour apples. Flavor is tart right off the the bat, then mellowed into creamy malt and berries with a good balanced aftertaste. This was a really outstanding beer!"
"O= I could drink this beer all the time. So sour, so pleasantly sweet on the nose, and just right in the ABV realm. One of the best Bruery creations yet."
"Overall I would like to have this on draft and see what the differences are. I would of also liked to try the first batch of this, since the reviews are higher from the 2009 run."
"The beer drinks well enough-- it doesn't wow me, but it isn't bad either."
"Overall, admittedly, I am not that into sours, but I have been sampling more lately, and doing a bit of dabbling in them when given the chance. They were pouring this from the draft at this tasting, but later when that small keg ran out, they switched over to a few bottles they had. For my palate, I greatly preferred the keg, as the bottle was more sour and tart, and the oak and bourbon backbone was pretty faint in contrast to what was coming through on tap, not sure as to why. I have a bottle of this from my RS membership, not sure what to do with it yet."
"Patrick, Tyler et al continue to produce some of the tastiest stuff around."
"I found it one of those beers that clearly remind you how important serving temperature is. When I first started drinking it, a bit under temperature, I found the vinegar to be overwhelming and found it to be harsh with just a hint of rye. At the proper temperature the acetic, citrus, and rye notes appear balanced."
"A slow but easy drinker: maybe not an introductory sour, but certainly not advanced. Another reviewer compared it to an oud bruin, and I concur -- that's probably its proper category."
"This is pretty damn solid. Really nice flavor profiles, however can't tell there is rye at all. The tart vinegar is a little coy on the taste, other than that almost perfect."
"D - OK. After these three beers (the other two being Chocolate Rain and BBA Two turtle Doves), I am officially a fan of The Bruery. I had been on the fence before, but no longer. Amazing stuff! This is such an awesome, tasty sour beer... definitely one of the best American sours I've had to date!"
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice American Wild and a 750 goes down pretty easy with 1-2 other people. Finishing an entire bottle by yourself might be a bit rough though. This beer is already quite acidic, but I would be interested in seeing how it ages and if the brett comes out more. Definitely worth checking out if you can find a bottle. The rye spice / blue cheese combo is pretty cool."
"Overall, a really nice sour. The rye adds an awesome layer to the sour. Pretty drinkable."
"Murky orange-amber, nearly opaque. The head fizzles away quickly. Interesting, complex nose. Rye is evident, lending a dry earthy note, but there's a more dominant fruity, vinous sourness that's both acetic and lactic. The palate shows a nice blend of cheesy lactic acidity, fruity acetic acid, earthy rye and oak. Balanced, but somewhat thin for nearly 9% ABV. Quite good overall, the rye contrasts nicely with the bugs and funk."
"Poured a caramel in color with light brown highlights that had a thin bubbly head and left some lacing sticking to the glass. I did detect a little rye but was faint chillin in the background with citrusy vinegar notes vinous character and faint vanilla as well. The citrusy vinous and mild vinegar flavors dominate the palate with rye spice, oaky, and grape accents with a touch of acidic sour notes. The brew was medium in body with a pleasent amount of carbonation which had a mild acidic but vinous, rye spice, oaky,and citrusy sour finish. I got to try it about a year ago but was happy to have another stab at it since I thought it was tasty the first time around. It was pretty sour and drank really good."
"Alcohol is very well hidden the juxtaposition between sour and sweet bourbon like flavors is amazing."
"Drink-This is a great sour overall for me because its not too over the top."
"Unfortunately, the complex taste does wear a bit compared to other ""sours"". I did not come back for a second, but probably could have and not been disappointed. Again, some age would probably cut down on this a lot with a sacrifice to the intense mouthfeel which I love."
"Moderate body with a really nice amount of sourness. Overall, this drinks quite well and I was really thrilled to be able to try this. This trip was some of my first exposure to The Bruery's beers and I'm glad that they have nice experimental brews like this on."
"D - A little too tart for my taste."
"Well this certainly brought the goods, with a hearty even mix of tart/sour/spice/bread notes and a well done barrel character that pulled it all together. Great stuff as usual from The Bruery."
"The flavor opens up piquant with a distinct lemon rind and cherry tartness, as well as a clean lactic sourness and a touch of sweetness. Spicy rye is well integrated and I detect an earthy component. Acetic character is at a moderate level and I experience that same sharp Blue Cheese character I detected in the nose. The drying finish is lactic with a moderate acetic character accompanied by light wood and tannins. Another delicious and unique beer from The Bruery and I'm surprised it wasn't better received on the forums. Recommended."
"I found this beer to be great. Drinkable is a term that you can use easily with this. I went back not only for seconds...but fourths. this should be bottled and distributed directly to my beer room. Whadda you think Patrick? no? ok I will just wait for it to be put on tap again."
"D - High for the style, benefiting from the sourness not being over-the-top. This is a great sour overall."
"Insanely drinkable, absolutely perfectly balanced. Nice well carbonated mouthfeel. They refused to give me a growler of it."
"An example of why The Bruery has such a good reputation, there are probably less than half a dozen breweries in the country that can do sours this well. This is just good beer, which is underrated at the moment."
"Low to moderate carbonation, just a tad syrupy for my liking. Quite an interesting sour that's worth a try."
"D: This is a great sour beer, the 2nd time I've had this one, always enjoyable and an experience."
"An interesting sour. Its tartness/soruness would be in the middle ground for the style. Hints of grapes and pinneapple show up. Quite cheesy....like swiss cheese. Surprisngly full in the body, while not having the high acidic qualities of a sour. Cheesy aftertaste. Another worthy wild ale produced by The Bruery."
"Overall: A try it beer. Cheers!"
"D: As with most sours, great drinkability. I'm glad to have been able to try this out a few times."
