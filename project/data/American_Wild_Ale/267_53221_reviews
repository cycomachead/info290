"This is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall nice stuff with lots barrel flavor to balance the tartness. I would drink this again if the opportunity presented itself."

"Not one of Odell's better attempts, and there are way better American Wild Ales out there.  A miss, from an all around great brewery for me."

"friek is a clever beer, a mix of cherries and raspberries added at differetn stages of the brewing and barrel aging process, it is complex and unique, delicious and drinkable, and a great expression of both fruits. thin reddish in color, purple and mahogany undertones, and just a mild off white patchy layer of bubbles on top. the nose is more cherry than raspberry, a touch medicinal perhaps, but the sourness in it brings it right back. the raspberry adds some tartness, while an unexplained lemon citrus component is also there. the flavor i think balanced both fruits well, but the raspberry seems like fresh berries while the cherries seems more of a candy thing, maybe to do with when they were added and how long residual yeasts have been working on them. not overly sour in taste, but there is definitely a lambic-esque mix of yeast and bacterial character, between lacto acidity and bretty funk, it fits the bill pretty well, although brett is not readily apparent here, some other yeasts may be acting similarly upon it. fruit is forward but its beer first, which i appreciate, but to me the body is too thin for all the flavor. carbonation could be ramped up a bit, and the watered down fruit syrup texture needs a lift. either more grain body or less leftover sugar, its a tricky balance in a beer like this, and its not quite reached. overall though this is amazing beer, maybe the best balance of the two fruits ive encountered."

"O: A clean and easy fruit sour. Fruit/oak flavors complement each other rather than overpower. Thanks again, buffs9!"

"A nice fruity sour with oak and yeast drying out the sweetness and adding depth. I will pick up several of these the next time I see them."

"Plenty of fruitiness with the raspberries and cherries, oak, and a light mustiness. Lots of carbonation and a sharp acidity."
""
"Bottle share at Proof. Rosy pink in color with only the thinnest of collars, and no head present. Aroma is fruity (more raspberry than cherry) and tart/dry yeast. Taste is sour cherry, a slight raspberry, but mostly just sour and not well balanced. Light body, low carbonation and tongue puckering from the tartness."

"O - A very good Kriek like beer that I found very enjoyable. I thought it was perfect for my new years champagne."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Excellent drinkability and sessionability. A solid brew, but not superb. Another nice offering from Odell."
""
""
"Definitely a wild one, crazy tart, almost vinuous at times. Nothing too strange going on, however, I'd almost call it classically wild. Raspberry flavor mostly gets lost in the mix. A nifty beer that sour fans should experience at least once, but perhaps too aggressively tart for many palates. I generally go for more sweet with my sour, but Friek is so well done, I'll make an annual exception to check it out again anytime I find it."
""
""
"Overall, this is a tasty, light, fruity beer. However, the price is absurd ($17.62 for 750) and the barrel aging, which increases the price, doesn't seem to add much."
""
""
"O - I like this a lot. It has a very fruit-forward flavor (not too sweet though) but is balanced nicely by its sourness (it certainly won't make you pucker). Compared to other sours that I've tried, this is much less ""funky"" and would be a good choice for someone interested in trying wild ales. Well worth it's $12-$14 price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours bright, translucent red with a slight amber hue the deeper into the drink you get. Minimal off white head that recedes to the sides and leaves no lacing on the sides. Aroma offers a little funkiness, the raspberries are stronger while its colder and cherries become a little stronger as it warms, the fruits give offsome sweetness and tartness, there's some vinegar hanging out, as well some funk and oak. Flavor pretty much follows suit. Pleasantly moderately sour. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall. great beer. Wish it wasn't so expensive so I could buy another bottle (or 2)."
""

"2012 version on tap at Bulldog-uptown. Like most lambic a this isn't much to look at. Light pink and quite clear. Served with no head. Smells like a Kriek and that is a complement. Aromas of cherries and musty funk. Tastes like the aroma with a bit of lactic and acetic sourness in the finish. Light bodied and easy to drink. Refreshing for a sour. This is one of the best American lambic style beers out there. Has that Belgian funk. Tart and refreshing."
""
"Overall. Pretty damn decent for an american lambic. I would definitly drink this again but I seem to remember it being quite expensive. If that's the case, I'll stick to the real Belgians."
""
""
""
"Well done and that's after it had lost its pizzazz."

"The medium body swells nicely, and it's a pretty dry beer overall. Crispness is big without biting too hard."
""
""
"Overall - Decent sour. This bottle might be old, for the record."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the better American-made kriek ""style"" beers I've had, although I've admittedly had only a small sampling. But this could stand up to any well-made Belgian kriek. Not saying it tastes the same as some of the greats, but it would hold it's own."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a good beer, but not a great one. Even though the cherry is subtle, I still really like it. Its piquant yet not-overdone sourness also makes it easy to quaff. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a gorgeous ruby red with a thin white head that quickly dissipated. Lovely to behold. Scents of barnyard funk, slight cherry and slight raspberry and hints of oak. Flavors of strong sour lambic, some sour raspberry notes, slight hint of sour cherry and oak on the finish. Very complex, the fruit flavors have blended together with time and sour brett character has increased. The oak from the barrel aging remains and is quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. True to style for a Belgian sour. An excellent sour, with a good deal of complexity and excellent flavors added by the oak aging. Well worth the $18 price tag."

"O: A very well crafted and tasty beer. fantastic complexity and oh so good. the sourness is there without being overbearing and the fruit flavors are nice without being overpowering"
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid sour it is really fruity and juicy while maintaining a nice sour flavor though I wish it was more powerful or tart. This was the first I've tried from odell's and I'm impressed/will be back.I wish I was able to get two bottles so I could taste it in a few years but nonetheless I definitely recommend this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a stand-out sample of the style that I really enjoyed. Loads of flavour and a nice balance between sweet and sour, with the fruit notes coming through on the finish making for a memorable brew. Highly recommended and really glad I had the opportunity to try it."
""
""
""
"Friek is a fruit-forward sour ale that supresses the more earthy or ""funky"" aromas and taste in order to allow the dry and tart fruit to become the showcase. I rather like the beer as its balance begins to tilt to the world of fruit beers as much as it does wild ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, meh. I was really looking forward to this one but was left slightly disappointed. I feel like this is a beer that is almost really good, but none of the flavors really want to stand out. At the price it's hard to say if I'll get another bottle."

"O: Not extremely puckering but a good sour IMO. The cherry (kriek) side is nice, and though I'd like more raspberries, the fruit component is nice.."
""
"O- Good beer. Wish it was a little less sweet and a little more sour. Worth trying even at the higher price tag."
""
"Decent, but I came away disappointed due to the strange cheese aroma."
"O-This 2012 batch was my first Friek, and although the cheesy, funky smell initially turned me off, the pleasant taste or tart red fruit and mild oak grew on me. I also liked the dry, crisp mouthfeel and finish. Still, the cheesy nose never completely disappeared and this brew lacked the complexity of a true lambic, both factors that drop this beer a couple spots in my scoring."
""
""
""
""
"O - Dry and fruity without being overly sweet. I would like to try this one again."
""
"Lower side of carbonation. Finishes on a nice dry puckering note."
""
"M: Light to medium bodied with good carbonation."
"O- 7/10 sourness. Really enjoyed this sour. Has very nice tart/sour flavors complemented with some fruit flavors from the raspberries and cherries."
""
"Pretty average, flavors work for the style, i suppose."
"O - Amazing sour ale that sets a nice standard for depth of flavors and drinkability."
"O. Pretty straightforward. The beer turned out like I was expecting it too. Tastes and drinks like a fruit lambic. Nothing that is going to blow you away, but a solid well done sour. Wish I had two to see if age changes the Friek."
""
"Pours a ruby red color with a head that disappears with fizzy noise. Nose is sweet cherries and some raspberry mixed in with some subtle citrus lambic notes. Taste starts with lemon sour notes that is quickly replaced by some soft raspberries and cherries. What's enjoyable about this is that the raspberry cuts into the cherry and prevents this beer from being overly sweet, like some krieks fall prone to being. Mouth is a little watery, but decent. Overall, this is enjoyable Kriek - I like the raspberry addition to the beer. This is the best sour I have has from Odell."
""
"O - Love it. Cherries, raspberries, sour, oak aged? Sign me up!!! Again and again."
"Odell's latest stab at the sour beer arena. Comes at the palate perhaps too green and finishes a bit too quick, but it did nab a gold at the 2011 GABF in the Wood & Barrel Aged Sour Beer category. Might be interesting to see where a few years of cellaring could take this brew."
"O: I really like this one a lot. I am new to the wild ales and I am definitely finding I am a big fan of the style. This beer has some sexiness and class to it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Friek is a really solid sour; probably one of the better shelf sours. I would put this on the same level as most Russian River sours. This beer doesnt see the credit or hype that is due to this fruited wild ale. I would definately more Friek give the oppurtunity. Thanks to TATURBO for bringing this home for me the recent trip to the western part of the USA!"
""
""
"M/D - thin bodied, nicely carbonated, its not too overly sour to be undrinkable and i'll have no problem polishing off the bottle."
""
""
"O - A nice kriek and I would definitely drink another bottle (if I had one). Not sure about the price, but I would stock my fridge with this one, as my wife would love it (but didn't get to try it this time around). Good stuff."
""
""
"O: This was alright, but the taste was just slightly odd compared to the nose and the low carbonation hurt it."
""
"O: Pretty darn fine brew for a nice, sunny, warm day on the balcony with the bbq going."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a slightly hazy light red with no head and no lace. Smell is of sour cherries and some funky aromas. Taste is of funky and sour cherry flavors with an acidic quality. This beer has a high level of carbonation with an extremely crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good sour with a nice cherry presence."
""
"Fizzy, near seltzer-like carbonation on a medium light body actually aids drinkability. Overall it's very crisp and dry, refreshing and nicely watching with spicy foods. A bit pricey, could maybe use just a wee bit more sour bite to clean things up. Very enjoyable, though."
""
""
""
"Odell Friek has a ton of flavor, with a great deal of fruit and a wealth of sourness. The balance of fruit and sour is impressive. It becomes more complex as it warms, but I am sorry to say that it does not approach the complexity of some other sours (I am looking at you, Russian River). This is remarkable nonetheless."
"O: Was not expecting this to be as good as it is. Although Belgian inspired, it's also very Belgian in every aspect. The fruit flavor tastes a bit artificial, and unlike that of traditional Belgian lambic brewers, but the funk/tart/oak in the nose and taste is definitely very similar. Very drinkable and very delicious. Need more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If it weren't so expensive - id probably pick up some more."
""
""
"Overall Impression- While I've heard this wasn't the best brew, I beg to differ! Maybe this years version is better than in the past. I'm not sure. Perfect cherry flavors throughout. Didn't find raspberries much in here but when the sourness and cherry characteristics come together, almost everything else fades. I enjoyed this GREATLY and recommend getting a bottle or whatever offering you can get it in."

"Awesome, I got to taste this beer at Savor last year and loved it. Glad I got to enjoy some more."
"Meh, twice what I'd pay again for it."
""
"O - Quite good, rich and fruity, and fairly unique as well. I'm really enjoying the combination of fruit flavors...this is somewhat dessert like in its fruitiness. I could picture this being made into an outstanding sorbet (but would definitely be hesitant to ""waste"" a bottle doing this). I wouldn't call this the best wild ale I've ever had, but definitely enjoyable, on the very mild side of tartness/sourness/wildness, but satisfying nonetheless."
""
"Creamy, light carb, light body, just plain Jane lambic."
"Huge thanks goes out to Phyllis for giving me this fine beer as a thank you for the trip. Not something I was necessarily seeking out but certainly something I'm happy to be sampling. Great mix of lambic funk, tart/sour fruit, and subtle berry sweetness. Excellent."
"o - Overall a really nice beer. Not super sour but smells and tastes great, and easy to drink. Would like to have it again."
""
""
""
"Interesting sour beer. Enjoyed enough to drink again."
"The beer is hazy and ruby/orange colored with minimal head. Cherries, oak, and wild yeast make up the aroma. Acetic feel with lots of tart cherry flavor. Well done. Delicious with lots of fruit. Slight pucker in the cheeks. Acetic finish. A solid fruit sour ale."
""

"Bottle courtesy of scray24, shared at the December iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours the color of unfiltered apple juice with no head. Aroma of fragrant cherry, citric acidity, tart raspberries. Flavor is more lemony than cherry/raspberry but those notes are definitely there. A little light but very drinkable."
""
"In this case you get Odell's GABF Gold Medal winning Friek. A tart and sour combination that plays on lambic styles mixed with wild yeast strains, aged in oak barrels, and completed with locally picked raspberries. Friek pours a ruby-red with flashes of orange, a thin ring of a white head comes and goes, leaving no lacing. The aroma of cherries leads to a tart nose, underlined by the raspberries. The mouthfeel of this brew seems a bit light, but is brightened by tongue prickling carbonation. A slight puckishness first greets the pallet from the tartness of cherries, but develops a wider range of flavors (including tartness, fruitiness, and sourness) that mingle well on the tongue with the sourness preceding the dry finish. An interesting interpretation on a classic style, and Odell's has a winner here."
"Overall, the more subtle notes made it seem like this could have been a terrific beer. I don't mind farmhouse ales, and I love a good kriek, but the amount of funk I got from this overpowered most of what it was trying to be."
"500th review!!! mildly hazy reddish-pinkish-amber with a pink-white head that pops and fizzes like crazy while it dissipates and then disappears. cherry and raspberry blend to create an earthy strawberry scent that leads the nose. undertones of earth, funk and wood as well. really nice balance. nod to the og producers and tradition, but with a nice american flare. taste is near perfect balance of tart and sweet. sweet wins out, but the finish is tart and fairly dry. tingly carbonation that really elevates the flavors on the palate. fun experiment from a great brewery."
"Dark blood red nearing purple. Simply wonderful nose. Raspberries and cherries fight for my attention. Flavors are a great blend of both fruits. Mildly tart yet cut with a sweetness that doesn't come off cloying at all. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Fantastic beer. Shame it seems the bottles vary."
"O - I really wanted to like this beer but the lack of carbonation essentially harmed every single aspect of the beer. Shame, really..."
""
"O: My favorite ""surprise"" beer of 2011 at the very end of the year. Can't recommend enough. I have always sought out Odell's beers, and have usually been very pleased. But this is world class.Get one if you can."
""
"A delicious treat. Truly yum yums."
"D - Bravo. Really well built and balanced. It's complex without being overbearing, drinkable, and delicious. I'd certainly have this one again."
"B+"
"Overall: This was a nice spin on the style. I liked the mixture of aged beers and the carbonation and funkiness produced from the yeast. Another beer that gets me used to sours and wild ales. Like them a lot and not sure I can fit a bottle of this in my suitcase to take back to Boston. Enjoying what I can't bring back while I am here in Denver."
""

"(D)- A great wild ale that works well and balanced well too. Overall, just an excellent take on the style. Very surprised by the other reviews on this one; bottle variation?"

"O - Pretty good wild ale. Not too intense. Very approachable and a good balance of sweet and tart with some nice funk. Refreshing."

"This beer pours a nice ruby red color with a one finger head. The smell is oaky tart and loaded with cherries and raspberries. The flavor is a little funky and tart with definite cherry and raspberry flavors throughout. The mouthfeelmwas anoittke thicker than expected. Overall a good beer just wish it were a little more tart and dryer"
"Overall: Carefully treads the line between fruit beer and American wild. Loads of sour and enough fruit to keep it all interesting. Oak really shines through. Nice depth and complexity in the long run."
""
""
""
"I'm still curious about aging this one."
""
"Light bodied, effervescent carbonation, the mouthfeel is good and it's very drinkable. Thanks, Odell!"
""
"O - Redemption! Finally a good beer tonight. After two drain pours I needed something quite tasty. This was recommended and didn't disappoint. I have had this a few times before but first time reviewing it. This is a beer that should be consumed fresh (The above review was of a new 2011 bottle)"

"Like it? Sure, It's Fine"
"Not bad, needs polishing though. My first Odell."
"O- this is a really good beer. Its unique and has a nice combination of flavors that keep your tongue happy. Would definitely want this again"
"O: Overall I am a huge fan of this beer. I would recommend it to anyone and would buy it again."
"Overall a good, but not great beer. Good flavors, but nothing extremely great and the carbonation issue knock it down a peg, but would still try again."
"O - An awesome brew to share with some great friends! Glad I got to try this one, highly recommended. This is not a brew for the extreme fruit lover, it's light and relaxed, not aggressive. Great work Odell Brewing!"
"Body stays light throughout, big points for not relying on added sugar (or at least it not tasting that way). The fruit really comes out in this one. Highly recommended."
"As I commit this rating to the internets, I must admit shock or bewilderment at the mere B+ this delectable brew currently holds; this beer is fantastic! Big thanks to G311 for the share. The brew pours a rustic ruby hue and is capped with a filmy pink head; good looking stuff. The aroma is excellent; rasperry leads the way in the aromatic department with cherry hiding behind oak and vanilla notes, and also revealing itself through the fruity tartness, which hides the acidity well. The flavor is just as good as the nose, but is apportioned quite differently. In this case sour cherry is readily evident, paired with a musty oak funk - the raspberry shows up on the finish with a sort of clean sweetness. The feel is petillant, and just under medium-bodied. Overall, this is an extremely enjoyable beer, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
"Picked this up recently for $16 despite passing on it earlier in the year. It's dark purple-red-burgundy and had a head for a moment then it disappeared. It is carbonated fine though so maybe my glass was dirty. Smells very woody like barrels and a hint of cherries and Brett. Taste is cherries, tart raspberry, very strong wood barrel flavor, not bad at all. This really doesn't taste like lambic to me but as an American Wild Ale it works. Only problem is the price tag, the quality if this beer does not justify $16 and I would never buy it again."
"A very nice lambic fruit style attempt by Odell. The mixture of two fruits adds a little extra character. It's not quite as funky as it's Belgian brethren, but still quite good."
"Thanks, crajun (from the other site), for the opportunity"
"A nice american interpretation of the fruit lambic style. Very solid though lacking a noticeable cheesy funk. Still, pretty good and I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"-Cheers"
"This is not the most complex beer in the world; calling this a Lambic could certainly lead one to be a bit disappointed, though I certainly wasn’t expecting this to be anything like a Lambic, so I am not nearly so disappointed as I would be. I definitely feel like I should be able to say more about this beer than I am able; it is certainly a bit more simplistic than it should be. The beer actually has a bit more carbonation than the feeble head would suggest. In some ways this can taste a bit like watered down cherry / raspberry juice, though it is not quite all that bad."
"Took forever to get the cork out, but when I did, it poured out with a good red color, but no head to speak of. One definitely notices the fruit aroma coming from it, and they are also evident in the taste, which is nice and tart. Finishes with a little bit of a puckering in the aftertaste. Would I drink it again....? If someone else was buying, sure. Otherwise, it's a bit too expensive ($17/750 ml) for what I am getting for it."
"O- I need more of this for sure. Quite excellent. Well done, Odell!"
"O - I enjoyed this one. The flavors worked well together and it never got to the point of being overpowering. I didn't detect much of the raspberries but it still had plenty of cherries to make up for it."
"O- i guess i was expecting more from this. im glad i got to try a bottle now and that i have one more to age. it will be interesting to see what a year or more will do to this. my first odell wild ale, and im not dying to open the other ones i also got in this trade. definitely a decent beer, but it doesnt compare to the likes of supplication like i was expecting."
"O - Solid beer, easy to get down, and tastes pretty good. No problems drinking and enjoying this."
"Shared this one with the group during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to Rake for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured ruby red with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, and cherry. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, cherry, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This one tasted a little watered down on the flavors to me which was unfortunate. Not sure why this was the fact, but it really left me craving something more from it. However, the flavors that were present were quite enjoyable though. The aroma was not very complex but was pleasant on the nose though. Worth trying if you get the chance to do so, but not my favorite offering from Odell."
"Thanks to schmittymack for pulling this one out last Saturday night. Poured a medium reddish color with a small, dirty white head. Nice tart aromas, sour cherries, wood, light raspberry and a little funk. On the palate, this one was light bodied, tart and funky, with early hints of raspberry followed by a long, woody, cherry finish."
"Smells appealing and tastes decent enough but this could really use a shot of the bubbly."
"This is a lambic that borders on sour without being too sour. Pretty drinkable and refreshingly so. The fruit works really well together and the barrel aging adds depth. I think Odell did a really nice job with this one."
"O - This is a really good lambic. I loved the blend of cherry and raspberries."
"O - I've been impressed lately by Odell's sours. A solid effort on their part. I have another bottle that I'm thinking of hanging on too, interested in seeing how it develops as the fruits fade."
"Felt this was a very middle of the road example of the style."
"Cherries is dominant, lactic acid is creamy in the mouth, thin body overall. The finish is mildly oaky and overall strong. It is a fruity beer, strong cherries, I""d have it again, a nice sour."
"Medium bodied but on the lower end of the spectrum with a very tart, mouth-puckering character. Sour without being acidic. Very dry with lots of funky bugs and toasted oak barrel character. This beer is bursting with fresh fruit. There s plenty of tart dark cherry but just like the aroma the tart, funky raspberries are more dominant. This adds to the sour, tart, puckering mouthfeel while being sweet and refreshing, not harsh or solvent like. Very dry and tart but not overly sour or difficult to drink. This beer is pretty interesting and I'm curious how it will hold up as the fruit fades."
" Rich Raspberry taste wraps around the tongue and then puckers the cheeks with the tartness. Very nicely done. Some subtle apple, maybe pear like flavors dancing around in the back now as well, before really drying out for the finish, leaving a long lasting taste of fruit in the mount, begging you for another sip."
"O- Solid sour, easy drinkability, nice cherry flavors, I’m glad I was able to try it, not amazing or worth paying 18 bucks for but still solid beer."
"Low carbonation isn't fully detrimental, but also doesn't help. A nice sour and tart beer that would benefit from a carbonation pick me up."
"O: refreshing, tart, and fruity but I wish there was carbonation and a bit more complexity to this beer"
"Overall: Nice fruit profile but not super complex. Still enjoyable."
"Great effort from Odell!"
"Overall - an excellent beer from Odell. The fruit has a stronger presence than the lambic, but it is nonetheless delicious. I've got one extra to cellar for a while. Hopefully it will develop more sourness and funk as it ages."
"Pours a cloudy red color with an average white head and some sparse, spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries a ton of cherry aroma along with a slight bit of oak. The flavor is more of the same -- the cherries really dominate and there's a bit of oak and light acidity in the background. Light body with a dry, slightly-acidic finish. Really nicely done."
"Dry, acidic, light to medium bodied, with average carbonation. Not as tart or acidic as most sours, but still very nice. A very nice effort by Odell, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"At times this one is very nice, but its also very middle of the road at other times. Pull out its high points and you'll like it just fine. Trouble is, its not all that unique. Ultimately good, but forgettable."
"This beer pours a hazy ruby color with a trace of white bubbly head. The aroma has notes of raspberry, cherry and vinegar. The flavor is like a Warhead candy... if you don't know what that means... is has a very sour taste to start with a fruity flavor afterward... In this case, raspberry and cherry. The mouthfeel is nice and clean... maybe could use a little more carb. This beer is definitely worth a try."
"D - This is pretty good. Not sure where the various Ds are coming from, as even without carbonation I can imagine this would still be pretty enjoyable. Extremely easy to drink - I could have tackled the 750ml on my own quite easily."
"I would pair the Friek with strong cheeses - that would be awesome!"
"D: Great drinkability. Not overly complex, and not as agressively sour as many of its contemporaries. But given O'Dells background this is a step in an intriguing direction for them."
"Drink- This was a perfect way to start a tasting event. It was light, tasty and sweet. Not over done or underdone and was pretty tasty."
"Appearance is a mury and cloudy reddish brown, almost copper colored (think like an old penny, not like a new penny). Head dissipates pretty quickly, leaving a small amount of bubbles that circle the glass. Tart cherry aroma explodes throughout the aroma, with familiar and yet complex hints of oak and sour funk. Aroma is definitly a highlight of the beer. First taste is sour fruit, as the sour raspberries and cherries really stand out. As your palate adjusts you can start to pick out the fruit notes, which really work well. Oak finishes. This beer could use a little bit more complexity in the finish, as it goes straight from sour fruit to the light oak finish. Sourness is abrupt at the beginning but fades as you continue to drink it. Mouthfeel is very full bodied and the carbonation is relatively light. This means the beer kind of melts off your tongue as you drink it. Not sure if there's such a thing as an easy drinking sour, but if there is, this beer would likely be it."
"i was impressed with this. i hope odell continues with lambics."
"O: This was an experience, and for my first Lambic I was really impressed. Odell’s is really onto something here and they seem to consistently produce better and better beers. They continue to impress me."
"Overall, I am glad I traded for this, but wouldn't try to get one again. Worth the effort in a fair trade I'd say."
"Taste is really watery... cherry comes through a bit, nice oak flavors coming through. The sour is not really as strong as the nose would let on. It is kind of disappointing. Raspberries are faintly present. Overall this is a bit of a disappointment. I was really interested in this, but just... Meh."
"Overall, this is a really nice American made fruit Lambic. I like."
"The taste is somewhat pleasant, relatively tart (cherry) up front with lingering sweetness as a backbone (raspberries). The mouth-feel is quite thin and it feels as though each mouth-full never quite materializes. There is something incomplete about this beer and it was not quite what I was expecting. Definitely worth trying (although the price tag is quite steep), but not one of the finer examples of the style."
"This is not a beer that I would go to on a regular basis, but I am sure my wife would if we had an unlimited supply of it!"
"And now the true Dark Lord Day festivities can begin in earnest: the random group tastings. This product thereof pours a murky amber grapefruit juice (red, o' course) topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises cobwebs, oak, caramel, and black cherry. The taste holds notes of sour cherry, ruby red grapefruit, light cobweb, oak, and dank raspberries. The body is a stoic medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and an oily feel. Overall, a solid bit o' lambic, something very akin to New Glarus Enigma in taste, though the occasional pricks of tartness and cobwebs, without some sort of consistency (if that makes any sense to anyone but me, I'll be surprised), keep this from making it up to that lofty point (I really enjoyed the Enigma). Still, a tasty specimen indeed."
"3.0 D: I'm not really that impressed with this one, especially given the high price tag. I would have preferred a much bigger fruit component, with a ""buggier"" base beer."
"Probably not sour enough for true sour Frieks..."
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a blackberry purple with a decent 2-inch bubbly head that quickly dissipates into nothing. No ring, no lacing but not abnormal for sours. The aroma has a lactic twang up front melting into tart berries. Both the cherry and the raspberry come through in the nose, along with a bit of oak, vinegar and just a hint of must. The flavor falls off a bit. While the fruits are still there, the tartness isn’t as sharp as it is in the aroma. The vinegar is a bit more vocal with the must and oak almost non-existent. As it warms up the raspberry comes through a bit more and lends just a touch of sweetness at the tail end of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is great. Crisply carbonated, leaving a prickly sensation on the palate. Finishes extremely dry making the tongue almost feel stuck to the roof of my mouth. Overall I thing there is some room for improvement but it gives me hope that Odell’s could become of the better and more consistent sour producers in the US."
"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel glass a murky, deep ruby color with a white head that quickly settles to form a tiny collar. Tart cherry in the nose right off the bat followed by a slight funkiness. Light/medium mouthfeel with carbonation. Very sweet upfront with both cherry and the raspberry fruit flavors but then transtions to a sour/tart funkiness, not overly funky but there. I find myself rather surprised how well I like this beer. I would for sure drink this again and am glad I have a second bottle to cellar."
"O= Great brew. Worth checking out for sure at the price point you can't find too much better. Great balance and easy to drink. I'll be picking up a few more bottles if I can find them."
"Overall, this was a really nice sour. I was shocked by this one after having Odells first sour. This was a lot better. Really drinkable as well. Good flavors. Good stuff."
"O: Entirely pleasant, not overly sour, not overly complex. Not a top tier beer, but there's also nothing I can find to complain about."
"O: Pretty darn good beer here. Not quite as candy-like delicious as Lindemans Frambois, but it makes up for it with depth and neat Brett funk. Wish it were more affordable, as this is something I could enjoy frequently on a hot afternoon."
"O: Not a bad effort from Odell, I have really enjoyed this beer. Nice flavors and a good intro to sours for the uninitiated. I'm glad I have another bottle to lay down and let age, because I think this will continue to get funkier as it ages."
"draft at the brewery taproom"
"The wood aging adds some pleasant flavor to this lambic evening out the tartness some and adding complexity. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of raspberry in the flavor profile. Nice to try but I feel a little cheated by the $18 price tag."
"O: Very solid beer. I enjoyed it after I wrapped my head around it. I expected a more sour beer after smelling the nose, but this beer was more sweet with a mixture of tartness. I'm excited to drink the bottle I purchased and hope it's similar to what I had on draft. I would definitely recommend this beer to others who like creative beer or softer lambics/sours."
"O: Solid beer overall, could have used a little more tartness, but it was good."
"This is another really nice effort from Odell and actually one that may be worth watching age for a year or so."
"D: Great beer by Odells. Definitely one of the best I've ever had by them. While I expected sweeter fruit and more sour, it was the opposite and I liked it. Balanced softer fruit with more tart notes. Great summer beer, first beer, or desert beer."
"I love the use of the barrel on this beer -- it imparts a big flavor that so many fruit lambics tend to ignore. The fruity flavors are a bit one-dimensional, being overpowered by raspberry, but I polished off the whole bottle without a problem. Tasty and easy-drinking."
"(750ml bottle). Pours a beautiful cloudy red with full head. Aroma has some cherries and lots of wood. Taste is sour with some cherry sweetness. Medium bodied with a dry, woody finish. This is the most sour odells as others have noted, but I'm still waiting for them to produce a consistently great sour. Their sour old ale, though, is delicious"
"Notes: Friek is a light to moderate bodied brew, but flavor is intense. Thirst-quenching is this beer's priority. It's tart flavor and dry finish makes it a perfect before or after-dinner sipper. Or with a fruity desert would be ideal. Drinkability is impeccable. Mad props to Odell for this release!"
"Overall a really nice beer. I judge this to the standard of Cantillon and it is in the ballpark despite a few minor flaws. Can't wait to begin pimping this beer out at my craft beer store job on Thursday based on really liking it."
"Overall: Very solid Lambic-style ale here. Not mind blowing but nicely balanced, light, pleasing and very refreshing. Another great job by Odell."
"D: Really enjoyable but now I have to decide whether to drink my bottle now or hold onto it and see what it's like a year from now. Curious what this might taste like with some age on it. Solid again Odells. Hope they keep it up on all their new beers."
"Overall, a very nice sour - more sour than I remember from other bottles and on draft. Reminds me of a soured New Glarus fruit beer. This is better than I remember their earlier test versions. Odell has been playing with Brett, but this is the first sour that I know of...very impressive."
"It's not a lambic that will wow you with sour or pucker your mouth but it's enjoyable and more drinkable for that reason."
"Excellent work boys, keep it up!"
"Taste follows smell pretty closely. Nice range of fruits; cranberries, cherries, currants, grapes. I don't detect too much oak aging, perhaps some in the brief middle. Wish there was more present malt in here, the taste needs to be fleshed out some; it's too thin and one dimensional on fruit and the wild ale sour finish. There is less dryness in the finish than expected."
"D: The tartness, sourness, and bite of carbonation is a bit much to drink a lot of it."
"Label # 2177"
"Light body is crisp and refreshing. One of the better beers Odell has released."
"Well done Odell's.  You continue to impress me.  I hope you keep this one in your rotation. "
"The body is light with a nice acidic taste. But the cherry balances it out well and lingers into the finish. Overall pretty tasty but if I were to nit pick I would say it could use some more complexity. Still very tasty and drinkable."
