3.98,2.1,3.75,3.75,4,4.5,4,"Dark with minimal head that quickly fades.  Smells like earth, tart berries, and a tiny bit of funk.

4.33,11,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Overall: This is a pretty nice beer by Allagash! Very different and interesting.  I cant say that I would call this a soured stout, but it is defiantely a dark beer with brett. Perhaps it could be considered a combination of a black saison, a wild ale, and a mellow porter. As always... Allagash delivers an awesome looking beer, with nice complexity from the flavor profile, and a great mouthfeel to boot.  Should I just move to Portland Maine to be closer to the source of so many great wild ales?","4DAloveofSTOUT","Feb 25, 2015"

4.19,7.4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Bottled June 16, 2014. Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is an extremely dark, almost opaque, brown coloring that borders on date colored. The beer pours with a dense, foamy, bubbly head that quickly recedes into a surface coating of off-white. Aromas of farmhouse funk, date and red grape sweetness, solid roasted character, licorice, cotton candy, and some earthy notes. Flavors are roasted and sweet forward, with notes of date and fig, licorice, tobacco, brown sugar, red wine dry and sweet, and tart berry. There is a sharp and very tart/sour undertone, with hints of citrus, mint, and an herbal blend of spices. Cherry, subtle yeast funk, and earth round out the tail end of the palate, with the tart and sour notes carrying through into the aftertaste. The body is robust and dry, giving a solid and consistent feeling across the palate. Very subdued roasted sweet and tart aftertaste compared to the palate, but a perfect transition into the smooth, dry, and soft finish, with only subtle lingers of old world fruit and berries. Very solid, balanced, layered beer.","GarthDanielson","Feb 20, 2015"

The brett here seems to be really only in the nose, pretty much a somewhat bland, fairly light tasting, stout otherwise.

4.04,3.6,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours a dark maroon with brown sugar highlights, it forms a small head of fizzing lightly yellowed, tan bubbles with mild retention. In body, the beer is a dark, opaque murk. On the nose, the beer smells of bristling tannic oak with raisin and dark cherry accents and a hint of plums and chocolate. Subtle brown sugar softens the edges of the nose, as well. The beer unfurls more and more as it warms in the glass, and is full of quite a few layers of complexity. On the tongue, the beer begins as tart, nearly sour with fruity accents that unfurl and then are coated in thick roasted malt bitters. The finish is lightly dry and bitter. In flavor, the beer begins as tart dark cherry pie coated in dark sugar with hints of plum. These flavors unfurl into dark, caramelly bread with roasted coffee and burnt toast character. Slight bitter, herbal hops and oak tannin enter on the finish to give structure and further complexity to the sip. The aftertaste is of bitter roast and cherries. As the beer warms, the tart cherry flavors begin to blend in with the middle and finish of the sip, which is lovely. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body, with a strong carbonation that scrubs the tongue. Mouthfeel is luxurious and smooth, with a crisp bite from the carbonation. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly dry, but with plenty of saliva on the edges of the tongue, and a slightly bitter stick to the tongue. Overall, this is a lovely dark sour with phenomenal funk and roast. If I had to label it, I would say more sour brown porter than sour stout, but honestly this beer defies modern categories; it’s a new style that needs to be further explored. This is a lovely sipper that could pair superbly with darker meats or chocolate raspberry desserts. This is a beer to try.","Maxwell","Jul 27, 2014"

This is followed up with some roasted notes and mild chocolate character. The Brett notes seem to work nicely with the roasted malts. The taste features notes of Brett, fruit, funk, and chocolate intertwined. There is a slight tartness at the beginning, but that is overshadowed by roasty malt notes. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, I like the combo of dark malt and Brett. I think the two strong flavors do a nice job of balancing each other.","homebrew311","Apr 07, 2014"

Allagash have mastered nuance and balance in there wild ales and while this is not there best effort it is better than many wild ales I've had because of the balance and nuance.

Whiffs of dark cherries, accents of dark chocolate, balsamic vinegar, and mixed berries on the nose. Opens with dark chocolate and caramel joined by dark cherries, blueberries, and other dark fruit notes. Finishes fairly dry with tart cherries, a bit of balsamic vinegar, light oak and mild rye spice. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation silky smooth and creamy. Really wonderful, unique brew. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.","chanokokoro","Jan 25, 2014"

Aroma is big funky vinegar and wet dog, black cherry, tart apricots. The flavor is tart up front with black cherry, but then fades into an interesting taste of roasted malt and dry rye--still lightly funky and sweet--then back into fruity black cherries that linger a bit. Relatively light bodied and perhaps a bit more watered down than one would like. Medium carbonation. A unique beer worth trying, but not sure it is worth stocking up on. Maybe the tartness will come out more with some age?","BMMillsy","Jan 11, 2014"

The beer itself is a dark black with hints of dark, ruby red that adds a nice shade to the black. The smell is very good and certainly worth writing about. The beer has a strong funk (tart) smell from the Brett in addition to hops, a bit of the roast, all of which to form a cherry smell when it warms up. Some of the raw wheat gets through and combines well with the Brett but easily gets lost if you are not looking for the wheat. The roasted character also comes out a bit to make the combined smell similar to berry. The hops do not seem to be very present if at all. The taste is a bit different from the smell but still similar in some respects. The funk is still the strongest flavor but is less sharp than it is in the smell. Rather, the funk (tartness) seems to mix with the other flavors and comes out a similar flavor to cherries. The light roast also makes an appearance and the hops are make an appearance in the aftertaste. The beer feels bubbly and smooth but not crisp, which makes it an easy but unique drink. Overall, a very good beer and one that I will get again if I can swallow the price tag.","HattedClassic","Jan 05, 2014"

The tartness was minimal and the beer just didn't seem as lively as it was fresh. I just don't feel like the roasty bitterness from the malts and slight tang from the brett worked very well together.

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, big funk, dark fruit, wood, earth, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I will come out and say it right out of the gate. I’m not the biggest fan of soured/funked stouts, etc. However I do mind giving them a try. This one was one I’m glad that I gave a shot. The funk on this one was definitely the dominate factor going on here with some of the notes from the base brew taking a backseat. The brett didn’t really add any balance to the brew which is what hurt my flavor score on this one slightly, but it was still a brew that I’m glad I got the chance to try and wouldn’t mind doing so in the future again.","thagr81us","Mar 08, 2013"
