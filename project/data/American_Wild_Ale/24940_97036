I'm big on this beer. It has a low-coarse carb feel, but the texture and flavors balance that out to create something very similar to GI Loloita.

Not the best of aromas, but as the head dissipates there is a tart red wine aroma with some subtle sweetness too it. Very lip puckering sour, tart cherry flavor. Nice and dry very light on the tongue. The puckering sour goes away and mellows out as glass becomes half empty but still just sour cherry on the flavor that's it. I don't get any of the wine barrel on the flavor just the aroma.","i4ourgot","0"

4.39,3.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"i like this better than the other fruited variants of it. its gritty in texture, almost dirty earthy. dense and just a little pink. its sour beer first, fruity second, with the cherry putting in about as much as the red wine barrel, really cool. wild sourness lacto maturity and a lot of malt character in this, wheaty and a hint sweet. Cherry is just in the finish, and the red wine tannins exacerbate the dry pucker. Acidity is high, oak character is prominent, and the overall quality of this is enormous. Rad to have it on tap too. Thanks to hops and pie for that. More bubbles would make it feel perfect, but I like the light prickly and dry density. World class no doubt. amazing to me that this and the cerise sour are both cherries in red wine, but this is such a flavorful and honestly superior use of those ingredients comparatively. its really excellent.","StonedTrippin","Nov 06, 2014"

The taste is aggressively tart cherries upfront followed by chewy yeast and lingering malt and cherries in the finish. This is a potent sour that finishes with bone dry cherry-lime acidity, minimal acetone, modest complexity, chewy yeast, negligible carbonation, and a distinct cherry presence throughout. Although this is not my favorite almanac it's still a great sour that doesn't disappoint.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 12, 2014"

Bursting with juice, fleshy sweet and sour cherries, cherry skin tannins and a wonderfully complementary red wine vinegar note, this is brilliant stuff. The mid palate brings in flavors of honey, a little sugar, vanilla and oak. The funk is moderate and similar in character to the other Almanac sours I've had - earthy, damp hay - but this time around, the fruit character dominates it easily. There is also that characteristic malt flavor, rustic, earthy, mildly oxidized even, but it is not particularly intrusive on the palate. Medium light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer finishes long, juicy, tart and refreshing. Highly recommended.","DefenCorps","0"

Lots of funk, with sour cherry skin on the nose. A hint of vinegar, but mostly some musky, funky, cherry aromas. Great nose on this one. Taste is just as good. The funk lives on through the flavor. Barnyard wheat and hay with sour wine-like flavors. Lots of sour cherry. Mouthfeel is somewhat juicy, with a bit of dryness in the finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this batch is better than I remembered from batch 1. The cherries seem to be more complementary to the beer, and it seems to be a bit more sour. Glad I bought a few of these.","DovaliHops","May 13, 2014"

Bit sour vinegar aroma with lots of sweet cherries and a hint of brown sugar. Nice nose on this. Flavor is a nice sweet and sour cherry, some yeast funk, lacto. Pretty expected for the style but with a bit more sharp tartness to go along that makes it nicely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and a bit more body than other sours, and with carbonation on the lower side--just a little prickle. Overall this was enjoyable.","BMMillsy","Dec 30, 2013"

It has been unmistakable in all three of the Almanac sours that I have sampled thus far. I enjoy the uniqueness of the Almanac brand sour beers.

Smell is sour and tart with grain, red wine, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy sour cherry and grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Aroma is part tart and part sweet -- lactic acid, underripe cherries and slight vinegar for the tartness, and butter, honey and melon for the sweetness. Flavor has a unique but slightly understated Rainier cherry character, sweet and fleshy but very obviously not black or maraschino cherry like many other Flemish-style sours have. There’s a significant oaky buttery note throughout, but it isn’t really off-putting. It lends a honeycomb aftertaste that competes with cherry pits and fermented strawberries in the finish. I’m also getting a sort of milky lactose mouthfeel with a drying sensation, like if you’ve ever added honey and milk to a cup of tea. I like this beer more and more as I go along. Overall a unique mix of lactic acid and lactose notes with a moderate amount of fruitiness.","illidurit","Jul 28, 2013"
