"EBF sample. Pours a turbid, light brown color. Aroma is both sweet and tart. Reminds me of a Flanders Oud Bruin. Cherries are tart and also sweet smelling. There is also a good dose of funk and other fruits. A bit oaky. The flavor is sweet with some dark fruits and caramel and cola. Also there is a good dose of tart cherry. Quite complex. Finishes with some oak. Has some heftiness to the body but I'm shocked that it's 11%. I've wanted to try this for a while and I found it to be a rather interesting 2 ounces."

"The flavor follows the smell. Not extreme like some. There's an element of darker malts. I detect no bitterness. A mild sour."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Excellent brew"
""

"Still on draft at Monk's in Philly a couple of days after their Lost Abbey dinner.  Awesome sour. So glad I tried some."
""
""
""
"Not sure how people get this Quad confused, what other master brewer can cherry out a quad like this??"
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the best beers I've ever had. There is a combination of sour and aged old ale / quad I've never come across before."

"An excellent Flanders brown. Poured a dark brown (SRM 37) out of the tap. Minimal head. Medium tart, but balanced with the sweetness of the roasted malt, it is not too acetic and puckery. ABV listed at 11 percent, but there is absolutely no alcohol burn. Huge beer that manages to hide its alcohol in tartness and malt and notes of sour cherry and vanilla. Great take on the Flanders brown."
""
""
""
""
"A little tart for my taste,  but a high quality beer."
"Sour cherry dominates. I get some barnyard, some oak and then some warmth in my tummy. Solid."
"On tap at the Aptos St. BBQ.  Been quite a while since I had the opportunity to try this well crafted beer.  The wine barrel aging really dominates the flavor profile (at least that's what I detect, though the recipe doesn't list any wine barrel aging), giving the beer a lightly sour, wine infused finish.  You still pick up some light chocolate and malty sweetness from the underlying base beer, and the overall combination of flavors is quite.  Aptos St. was doing small, 5 ounce pours of this beer, which I found was just right for me (would have had difficulty sipping a pint or even a 12 ounce tulip of this beer).  Overall, another solid effort from the folks at Lost Abbey."

"Poured from a 12.7 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"This one didn't seem to suffer at all for it's age, and maybe I'm just getting used to sours, but I'm going to finish this one off and wish for more."

"Tastes like a sour old ale.  Nice sour cherry nose and you certainly get the sour cherry flavor.  This beer could use some sort of carb.  There is none.  It's a little pricey for what it is.  Expected something more complex or complete.  It's a solid sour if you're a big sour cherry fan."
""
""

" The flavor is lovely with a mld vanilla mixed with sour cherry and bourbon juxtoposition just tantalizing along with gentle tangy yeast with the sour elements blending well with the mild alcohol and wood from the bourbon with cherry skin tannin in the finish and warmth of the bourbon continuing in the back with slight dark sugar accent. The tangy sour is in harmony with the carmelized malt flavor with light sour flavor of fruit and mellow fruity sweetness combining to finish tart with a drying alcohol taste and barrel tannin in the end. Overall this is a true joy to savor -for a strong 11% ale to have a quad base and the cherry and sour elements all working in unision is a testament with exceptional drinkability with the bourbon enhancing the overall enjoyment-great mix of fruit and barrel aging in this."

"On draft at Monk's.  This latest batch is my favorite.  Wonderful fresh, bright, sour cherries."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another really good one from Lost Abbey. I can't speak for the bottled version, but on tap this was excellent. Really glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O: The sourness can almost hide the alcohol content, but the telltale sticky sweetness on the endtaste conveys all the booziness of a good brandy. Would love to drink again."

"O: Alcohol is somewhat apparent in the nose and flavor as well, but this is to be expected with a beer this strong, and it's quite well masked. I would recommend this beer. It is my favorite sour. I'd say have a few other sours first, get accustomed to it, and then try this beer. It's really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd be willing to give this beer a second try if it was given to me, but I can't see myself paying for this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A mix of many different worlds but they come together to remind me of something between an Oud Bruin and a Kriek, aged in a Bourbon barrel. Pretty unique and a must try for sour and barreled beer fans."
""
""
"O: Very nice flavor and I'm enjoying the tart cherry notes. Although this just doesn't do it for me without carbonation. It tastes flat. I appreciate it as a quality craft beer, but it's not my thing."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great integration on a really complex base. Really nice sour character; well balanced, and not overly acidic."
""
"Overall, interesting; the tart cherry is intense, and the overall flavor profile hits hard. It's drinkable if you like that kind of thing, though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Different, confusing, awesome. It's very complex and you get all the advertised flavors and nuances. I want to try this with a few years on it."
""
""
""
""
""

"Great flavor on this but still falls a little short with the carbonation issues."

"O: a great sour from a great brewery. Need I say more? This is a perfect lemon square, limoncello dessert in a glass, even if the dull brown would suggest otherwise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body with little to no carbonation, a little syrupy on the tongue before a drying finish. The lack of carbonation is a bit disappointing."

"Poures into delerium tulip. Looks dark and slightly murky with tones of brown black and carmel. Not to sticky on the glass, light, and definately sour..taste is cherry and chocolate rounded out by a good malt presence, very light mouthfeel for a quad based beer..this beer puckers the toungue with fruity flavors such as cherry and citrus, with the hops displyed on the finish...airee and dry. Carbonation is medium, which I like to go with this dry beer..This is a great 11% barrel aged beer. Some sours just dont pack the abv, and I can't drink more than 22oz of ""sour-beer", so this one boads well for me. This with pizza, sherp aged hard yellow cheese, salty food."
""
""
""
""

"If I didn't know I was drinking a beer I would have thought it was a very dark strong wine. Lots of cherries, sour and a very slight bourbon after taste. The one thing it needs more of is carbination. There doesn't seem to be any, thats a big reason I would almost mistake it as a wine. But all and all it is an excellent Cuvee."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very wine like. Maybe aging the bottle would help build some carbonation, but after reading reviews of aged bottles it appears this will not help carbonation build. I really think some carbonation would help this beer a lot. Again no noticeable bourbon barrel flavor is kind of a let down, not a bad beer but not something I would want to try again especially for the price. Can definitely find something comparable to this from a real Belgian brewery for 1/3rd the cost of this beer. Bottle says brewed with old world and new world processes which to me means they probably took shortcuts to make it using new technology which could be why this beer just is not that good. $18 for 12floz"

"o: this is a really interesting brew. the sourness is the most detectable presence in the flavor, but its goes down smooth. the combination of sourness and oaky tannins is a really interesting combination that you really just need to try to understand. well crafted"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"No need to belabor the point, but I prefer the low end of the carbonation scale, as long as there is SOME carbonation. Otherwise, a delicious beer."

"so stoked to finally try this, a beautiful specimen from the lost abbey. a rich mahogany color to it, lots of bubbles for what it is, and a nose to die for. really tart cherries and citric acid present themselves right up front. stick rich grainy beer follows, belgian loosely, but more raisin and molasses heavy than grain specifically. light spice, tons of cherries on the flavor. some residual sugar too, but they are balanced well with one another. it coats my palate well despite vbeing rather well carbonated for the style. cherries ll the way through start on the sour end and finish a little sweeter and fresher. dynamic and complex as anything, the sourness on the quad base make it like no other beer ive had. great use of fruit here, and very well hidden alcohol strength. one of the best beers from the lost abbey, and thats saying something."
""
""
"a favorite of mine. great!"
"I liked this beer. It was interesting and weird, but I just wish it had some carbonation. It's a nice representation of the dark sour style, though."

"Lost Abbey bottle, no date, looks new. Pours a dark murky brownish red with no head whatsoever. Aroma if black cherry, some tart cherry, plums, oak, hint of vinegar, slight booze, even a bit of sweet chocolate. Flavor is big black cherry up front, some booze, tart cherry skins, dry oak, lingering dry tart cherry. Brown sugar comes out as it warms. No carbonation in this, medium heavy mouthfeel. Some heat lingering in the back of the throat. Very interesting beer. I like it but the flatness and the ugly look are hurting the score a bit."

"Overall: I like it! The flat murky first impression is a bit disappointing but it totally delivers everywhere else. I think this is best to be enjoyed on a dark cool night by an open fire."
""
""
""
"Slight smell of oak. Taste of vinegar and sour fruit. Finish is very acidic. This would make good salad dressing. Seriously, I think I might make salad dressing out of this. When the world gives you lemons..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think if this thing actually had carbonation, it would be on par with RR sours. But it doesn't--which isn't necessarily bad. This would be a great post-hoilday meal beer. Very complex and worth a try...On the expensive side but I'd still recommend."

"O: really interesting brew. Looks are as unappetizing as they get, but the flavors are wonderfully integrated and contrasting. Bottle shape/size had me thinking Russian River right away, but the lack of carb makes me think Lost Abbey. The beer resembles Red Poppy in look, which I just tried for the first time last week, only perhaps with more age?"

"Interesting, and has some tasty aspects, the beer really loses points with the lack of carbonation. This type of layered, complex beer really needs some scrubbing bubbles."

"I'm guessing I opened one of the classic Lost Abbey's dead bottles, no where near ""off"" but it needs some life to be a great beer. I can see how many things could go wrong brewing something like this but I doubt this is exactly what the envisioned"

"This poured out kind of flat looking which is always a disappointment to me. Had some minimal bubbles around the edge of the glass but with time they vanished. The beer is murky brown looking with plenty of sediment floating around. The smell of the beer is funky with a boozy sweetness mixed with the cherry aromas. The taste are a sour tart cherry flavor upfront with a very subtle vanilla oak flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel I the beer is smooth, kind of flat which is a shame. Overall this beer has great taste and aroma but falls short in most other aspects."
""
""
"O: Great beer but a little sweet for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""

"M: Medium full bodied. No carbonation is a fail. Sucks."
"From notes, 1/31/11. Bottle. This is a delicious sour. It’s got tons of sour cherry flavor, but it doesn’t quite overwhelm the palate. Lots of acidity. Great pucker. Good funk in the aroma. Finishes dry and sour. It’s fairly complex, but the barrel notes kinda get lost. It’s a dark brownish red beer with no head, really. Very wine-ish. It’s one of the best from TLA and a wonderfully dry, fruity beer."
"O - very good beer, a bit on the fringes of the wild ale style with less focus on the sour and showing an even balance between the cherries and the malt in the flavors."
""
""
""
""

"Vintage 2010 i am guessing based on when i picked this up. A murky dark brown with a slight rhubarb hue - zero head and zero carbonation. The nose and taste really mirror eachother minus a big acetic balsamic note on the finish. Notes of sour cherry, barrel, bourbon caramel, light tobacco, puckering citrus along with a rich malty note. Overall i enjoyed this complex beer but it was undone by its complete lack of carbonation."
""
"O: Totally blown away here. This is the best beer I've had so far in 2013."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"bottle opened WITHOUT a pop (uh oh). pours still as the night. maroonish purple. smells super sour and rubbery. tastes like a brown ale with some funk and oak. definitely sour. rubbery sourness. i wish it was the beer without the barrel since the base beer seems interesting. little acetone, some heat, but flat like crazy...overally drinkable, but the lack of carbonation is a big let down."
"overall: pretty good - would have a hard time justifying the sticker price on a bottle though"

"O- This was a decent sour that I definitely enjoyed drinking. It wasn't as tart as I was hoping for, but the oak and dark fruits provided a nice taste and aroma to the beer. Not my favorite beer of the night, but well done. At $7/glass I would consider having it again and I'd recommend trying it."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this glad i got to try it"
""
""
""
""
"O: I really don't understand what happened here. Last time I got a bottle of this (a 750mL) this was sublime. Tart and sharp and perfect. This is an unmitigated disaster. And I have one more. With any luck, this will taste good in 2014. And if it seems I'm being overly harsh, it's because I know how good this beer can be."
"O - This one is sweet and sour. Somewhat over the top for me. I like the idea of trying to meld the tartness with the sweet bourbon qualities but it seems to lack that cohesion that brings them together."
""
""
"Overall: This is one of the better dark sours I've had. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
""
""
"Judgment Day is here transformed into something closer resembling a wine than an ale. Careless with the carbonation perhaps, but the flavor is superior, comparing well to some of the best offerings from Rodenbach in fact...will re-visit when I get around to cracking open my 2009 vintage."
"A"
""
"The only thing nice about this brew is the scent. sadly, this brew ended up as a drain pour... I hope to try it again, when LA figures out how to produce carbonation, but not at the $18 price tag."
"O- This is a damn awesome beer, the flavors are delicious and extremely complex, drinkability is pretty good for such a big beer, alcohol is well-masked for the most part. It's a bit pricey, but this is a really enjoyable beer overall."
""
""
""
"Overall. Very interesting beer, lots of flavours going on here but they don't work very well together for me."
""
"O: not very tasty or drinkable. Won't be visiting this one again any time soon"
""
"This is a world class sour that delivers on all fronts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was very tasty and perfectly sour enough to be drinkable (as opposed to a sipper). It smells and tastes great but the lack of body really holds this one back. It drinks way more like wine than beer due to the ABV, flavors and aromas, and lack of carbonation. That being said, it was a very enjoyable sour, the ABV was hidden extraordinarily well, and I’m very, very glad that I got to try it."
""
"It’s an interesting bottle and I was glad to have tried it. There is a lot of complexity here and it’s certainly thought-provoking. However in the end I found it to be a bit of a failure, and I like sours. There’s just not enough that’s appealing here, and certainly not at the price this one goes for. If you like old vinegar wine or stale cider you may enjoy this but I certainly wouldn’t buy or trade for this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a deep dark brown with no head and little carbonation. It looks like ripe cherries and is definitely getting me hyped to taste. The smell is also incredibly ripe cherries with a subtle touch of brine and sourness. An absolutely lovely taste follow through with a dry, sour aftertaste mixed with cherry sweetness. It's definitely got a slightly medicinal aftertaste, but there's so much going on it's not distracting. It's a super drinkable sour with notes of deep pit fruits and screams cherries. Worth trying for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great beer. The complexity of the nose and palate are what make me respect the brew. Although there is no head or carbonation, I don't think this detracts from the overall experience. I'm going to acquire another bottle next year."
"O: Despite the carbonation blunder this is a delicious and highly complex beer. I'd buy it again."
"O- never trading for or buying LA ever again. I have a bottle of Serpent's Stout left, and once that's gone, I'm done with them. This is the third issue I've had with their bottles, and I'm done."
""
""
"O: A pleasant sour which shows some nice barrel characteristics. As far as characterizing the beer, this reminds me more of a sour old ale (like Angel's Share) than an RR-type 'tion sour."
""
""
""
"Cuvee de Tomme pours almost entirely black, lightening to mahogany along the edges. There's no head formation whatsoever, let alone retention or lacing. It looks like another flat bottle from Lost Abbey. The nose falls a bit flat as well, but what is there has plenty of cherries and bourbon, along with some vinegar-like sourness an a hint of earthy brett funk. There's also just a little bit of soy sauce. The front half of each sip has some sour cherries and bourbon, but then the beer fades to a strong, unpleasant soy sauce flavor, along with a bit of oxidation. The body doesn't feel too full, especially considering this is an 11% brew. The complete lack of carbonation kills the beer though, as not only does it make the beer feel dull, but it allows the unpleasant close of the flavor profile to sit and linger on my palate. This bottle of Cuvee de Tomme is a major let down. I've had plenty of draft pours of it before at festivals and absolutely loved this beer, but tonight it's an absolute drain pour for me. Last time I seek out a bottled Lost Abbey product for a while."
""
"Overall I felt it was too acidic and vinegary to drink too much. Glad I had a small bottle of this. It was much better as it warmed up from being chilled. Some of the more desirable flavors and aromas came out and made it a pretty good beer."
""
"O: A wonderful beer overall. Glad to have made it to Monk's to try this special brew and chat it up with the brewer. Awesome beer experience."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this offering from The Lost Abbey. Still think it was pretty expensive for a 375ml bottle."
""
""
"A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, now I've experienced Tomme & I have to say I'm underwhelmed. Under carbonated, stone-heavy in the stomach, & not much depth underneath the blistering sourness of the cherries. Honestly, this feels like a home brew experiment gone haywire; hard to score, it has it's moments, but ultimately, this can't be the intended outcome. I hope."
"Overall this is a good beer. I do believe it needs some more time to develop some more complexity, but I don't know if I'd spend another $16 to buy another one to age. It is definitely a beer to be sipped and appreciated for all of the hard work and vision that went into it."
"On tap at City Beer Store. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is vanilla, bourbon, hints of brown sugar, some light funkiness, a little leather, cherry, and hints of raisin. The initial taste is quite tart with some lactic acid and a bit sweet with some brown sugar. There is also bourbon and vanilla, and some cherries. The finish is tart with some acetic acid and some lingering bourbon. Full body. Medium-low carbonation. The alcohol isn't detectable, but you can tell it is a fairly big beer. Quite enjoyable, but a little bit more sweetness than I like in my sours."
""
""

""
""
"O- I really like PP/LA beers, but this was an absolute abomination. Im pissed off that i paid $15 for this beer. I was thinking that it was going to be more like Red Poppy which was AMAZING. Wish i was drinking Red Poppy instead. Going to fix this with a bottle of Temptation."
""

"Picked up a bottle while in Escondido. I do not see a date stamped on the bottle or label. Purchased January, 2012. Poured to tulip. The beer pours a deep dark amber brown color with minimal head and as such not much retention or lacing. The nose is a pleasant mix of cocoa, raisins, fig, and a lot of cherry. Not overly sweet. Nice. The flavor is full of character: slightly sour cherry, figs, raisins, cocoa. Dark roast. Complex and yet well-crafted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. Finishes with a lingering cherry raisin flavor and mild bitterness on the tongue. Overall, I enjoyed this beer, interesting offering. I would happily have picked up additional bottles to cellar...perhaps next trip out to CA."

"its an excellent beer, i dont think theres any other similar beer out there going this direction, which makes it nice on its own. Just it could be more carbonated."
"O - Overall this beer was alright. A bit too boozy for my liking. Nice Bourbon notes too. Still not my favourite."
"Wild offering from Lost Abbey. I love that they keep making really unique beers. Keep it up!"
"Final thoughts - at 11% abv and a $17 price tag, I like it, but don't love it. It's only a 375"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When you swirl the glass, the beer has a reddish hue, and the head is off white with a faint pinkness. Flavor wise this has held up excellently and still has that tart sour cherry quality - I'd say more tart than sour though. This beer is really aging and holding up well even though I've kept it in less than ideal conditions."
""
"I would say this is closer to a Sour Brown (Oud Bruin) than anything. An interesting beer with a lot of subtleties and layers. Good stuff!"
"I finally got one, a flat Lost Abbey bottle. I knew there was a chance this would happen, but I went for it anyway. I'm glad to report that even flat, Cuvee de Tomme is still good. Still, one wonders what the experience would be like with proper carbonting, and at $17 for the bottle, really hope that issue can be resolved."
"I cannot grade on past bottles which I've enjoyed so much that I'd had it marked a ""5" on my ""Hads," now to review it and significantly down-grade it based on just this bottle, the 2011. I'll keep a bottle and see what happens. (I have a stash of 2009 and 2010 that I'm going to open this week and add notes to this review. Whether it will change the score or not, we'll find out)."
"O - wow, very disappointing. I had it when fresh, and thought I might get more complex/carbonated over the year. No. Not impressed, especially for $17 (375ml). I don't want to say it's a bad example of this style, because there is a broad array of beers that can fill this genre... But I would say that it wouldn't be a great introduction to the style for beginners. I will not be buying again. Sorry Tomme."

"Older Viscosity and the Angel Shares suffered from lack of carbonation as well that made those beers intolerable by being a cloying mess. This beer is able to skate by because it's not cloying and the sourness distracts for the most part, but I can only imagine how good this would be if it were properly carbonated."
"This is a wild beer (no pun intended). Although I am very intrigued and in awe over the flavors coaxed out of this beer, it is ultimately not one I would really want to try again. I am very happy to have had only a sample, as a 10oz glass would have been too much. I cannot imagine how someone would finish a 350ml bottle of this. As a homebrewer, I really want to pick the brewmaster's brain to see how he accomplished this. It just makes me want to try Red Poppy all the more."

"This beer pours a murky, dirty, stained wood brown with cherry highlights and no head or carbonation to speak of. The aromas consist of sour cherries, lactic sourness, light vanilla, and musty oak. It's interesting and heavy on the cherries. I don't get any of the bourbon barrel though. The flavors begin with the intial tart and sour cherry then go into an odd musty oakiness. It's different. It leaves an off raisin flavor in your mouth in the aftertaste. It reminds me of Veritas 009, which isn't good. The beer is lightly carbonated and drinks a little thin. It's just a strange sour. The alcohol isn't present until you're done sipping, then it warms your palate. Overall this is a miss for me. It sounds good on paper but then in a glass it is odd and disjointed. It's as if this beer doesn't have a purpose or isn't trying to necessarily accomplish something. I have yet to be impressed with a Lost Abbey sour with the exception of Red Poppy."

"D - I think this vintage may be on its way out, as it's gotten a bit unbalanced on the sour side of things. However, it's hard to know if the flat 2009 bottles or tiny 2010 batch would be superior at this stage - I'll have to give them a try in the near future. The 375ml bottle is a good format to share with a friend, as the high alcohol, intense flavors, and occasional harshness makes this a slow sipper."

"Unfortunately it poured as flat as can be. A rigorous pour down the middle produced zero bubbles. Smell is great. Tart cherries, chocolate covered cherries. fig/rum/raisin characters. Amazing smell. Taste is more of the same. As it warms the taste really improves and opens up. The taste softens. Chocolate covered dark cherries w/ figs & raisins. It's really too bad they couldn't get the carbonation. It didn't need much, but with even a small amount of bubbles this beer would have been world class."

"Overall: This is one of the better sours I have had. I am still not a fan of sours and nor will I ever be at this point but this is a pretty damn good sour"
"Overall: one of my favorite sours from Lost Abbey. This bottle however was very acidic/vinegary. I don't recommend holding onto these more than a year or so."
"Lost Abbey cops a lot of crap but I really enjoyed this. The tart character is very good, the fruitiness adds depth and there is even a bit of sweetness to the malt."
"O-- Ugly looking beer but very good. Not the big bright flavors or sour vinegar that other sours have. Really good beer and really enjoyable."
"Another great Lost Abbey beer that I probably need more than the quarter of the bottle I had to do justice in a review. In particular, the barrel imparts plenty of complexity that takes time to unpack. 4.5"
"Was very, very low in carb; almost absent, but I didn't even notice while drinking it. The alcohol in this beer was also extremely well concealed- drank much lower than it actually was."
"Overall, a very good beer. I've certainly had better american wilds but I really enjoy the cherries in this one, a very nice American interpretation of a kriek."
"I tossed the second half into the freezer to see what the beer is like very chilled. The aroma is much more muddled, but similar with less oak and more cherry. The tartness is more apparent on the tongue, but I think people are mistaking tannins for tartness; they're admittedly much more similar when the beer is very chilled. I like that the beer isn't quite as heavy this way, but overall I prefer this at cellar temp."
"One of my favorite beers ever. This was a very good year. I would love to try another 2009 at some point."
"Overall, I wasn't impressed by this beer once, and again I'm not overly impressed. Framboise de Amarosa and DDG are such outstanding sour ales from Lost Abbey. Not for me, but I'm obviously in the minority."
"Overall - Delicious beer. I would like more of the original quad to come through, but as a sour it is near perfection."
"O-Would drink again."
"(O) It's a lot like beefed up juice. It's really good but not as tart as I had expected."
"O: Well, it's sour. It's low in carbonation. It's hot. It's got potential. Just not my bag. Still pretty pathetic for carbonation, but at least it's not infected (per se)."
"Overall, I'm very happy I was able to try this beer and I can say for sure I've never had another beer quite like this. I think it could be tweaked a little more to get it just right but all in all, this is a very interesting, very good beer."
"O - Overall, this beer has a lot of potential and could be excellent with the proper carbonation."
"Note: 2005 Vintage"
"Pours a murky reddish brown with no head to speak of. Smells heavily of cherry with a nice tartness. Tastes cherry heavy and very tart. Fairly flat but thick and viscous. The tartness is pretty nice but i wish it had some carbonation. Overall it's okay but definitely doesn't live up to my expectation"
"-GFunk"
"Poured a hazy reddish brown color with minimal fizzy off-white head with virtulally no lacing. Moderate to heavy sour cherry, yeast and brown sugar aroma. Medium to full body and a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy sour & sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet & sour finish of moderate to long duration. This is a complex beer."
"2011 Vintage. Pours a very murky brown color with a beautiful red hue when held up to the light. No head whatsoever... bummer. Scent is fantastically tart with some nice chocolatey notes...very unique. As the beer warms up, I get a delightful chocolate covered cherry aroma. Smells VERY inviting. Taste initially sweet chocolate flavors, immediately followed by tart cherries. Dark fruits and chocolate are much more distinct than I had imagined. Not mouth-puckering sour, but a little tart. Finishes with some lovely oak, bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate covered cherry flavors. Very complex. Nice alcohol burn at the end due to the high ABV. Mouthfeel is vinous and creamy...severely lacking in carbonation. This beer has potential to be all 5's if it were well carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high...it is a sipper, but it is VERY delicious. Overall, this beer drinks more like a wine due to no carbonation. The aromas and flavors blow my mind though!"
"Overall Cuvee de Tomme is a very good beer that could be phenomenal with the help of a bit more carbonation. My bottle was not completely flat, but it was far from fizzy. I enjoyed it nonetheless, and consider it another solid offering from Lost Abbey. Looking forward to my next bottle."
"O: Tomme Arthur has made some of the best beers I've ever had, however has disappointed me the same amount of times I've been blown away."
"O - Not my favorite beer from Lost Abbey but given the degree of difficult this one is to make it is very impressive. It's a solid beer with simple ingredients that come together to make a solid offering."
"Pours opaque brown, thin head. Great complexity! Bretty nose, slight sour cherry and blackberry notes. Very slight bourbon character comes out as it warms. Alcohol warms the throat. What an awesome ""malt beverage"". Make sure you don't serve it too cold, you will miss out on a lot. I have done a 3 year vertical tasting and it definitely gets better with age, although it all vintages are good right now."
"D- can't taste the alcohol one bit. It is hidden behind the huge flavors. Still a slow sipper because I never want it to end!"
"Overall this is a great beer, a little carbonation would be nice though."
"O- the lack of carbonation killed the score on this, but i still really enjoyed it. i would love to get my hands on one of the older/carbonated bottles. i remember liking this bottled version much more than the one at EBF. palate fatigue?"
"O- Not my favorite offering, too sweet and under carbonated. If it were more lively i could have easily bumped the score up substantially."
"This is a full bodied brew that is undercarbonated. Big booze and sweetness is a constant reminder of raisins soaked in alcohol. I could not finish my glass, I had a hard time finishing but 5-6 ounces of this. I've had this brew before and based on that experience and the reassurance of this brew's description makes me believe that something different was going in here. It is grossly under-attenuated, undercarbonated and displayed zero of the described character of tart cherries and ""wild"" barrel influence. I have a bottle which I will end up reviewing but I seriously hope it doesn't taste like this."
"O- didn't know what to think about this brew but after I spent my time with it I'm very impressed and really enjoyed it. Interesting and fun, I'm really glad I got to try this on draft since the bottles seem to have many issues."
"Pours a murky dark brown color with no head. An oily film develops on the top of the beer and there is some floating sediment that sinks to the bottom of the glass. There is no lacing whatsoever. Smells of vinegar, sour cherries, and funk/must. Taste is of sour cherries, malt vinegar, wood, and funk/must. There is an alcohol presence in the throat after each sip. There is no carbonation on this beer. Extremely flat and somewhat drying in the mouth. Overall, this is a nice smelling and tasting beer but the appearance and mouthfeel kill it for me. This would be awesome if the carbonation issue were fixed. Disappointing for the $15.99 I paid for the small bottle."
"O: This beer far surpassed my expectations. I loved it. The carbonation wasn't a problem for me, however if there was a bit more this beer would definitely rank higher and be on a whole other level. Worth the hunt if you're into sours."
"O- epic beer. i want more."
"O - Overall... if this beer were carbonated even a little bit, it would be world class. There is a lot going on, and it does work well together. I'm very glad to have tried this beer, but probably wouldn't seek it out again due to the carbonation factor. This has been beat to death... but c'mon Lost Abbey... carbonation is not that difficult unless youre bottling unblended lambic, which you are not. End rant. Very tasty beer."
"I dedicate this to 3000 beers, some good, some not so good, some so beautiful."
"O: If carbonated, this would have been VERY delightful. However, in this case, it was only OK."
"Overall I've had this beer several times and it's good when carbed. Still tasty when it's not though."
"The 2010 vintage (opened immediately following) pours slightly darker in appearance. The nose on the 2010 is a 4.5 in my opinion - bourbon notes comes out as well as dark or caramelized sugar. Some cherries also come out as the brew begins to warm. Taste follow nose - much more cherry is expressed in the 2010 than the 2009. I'm also digging the bourbon character in this vintage. There's also a bit of citric acid in this one. The drinkability on the 2010 is a 4.5 in my opinion. I have to say that I enjoyed the 2010 vintage more than the 2009, but they really come off as two distinctly different beers in my opinion, so it's probably more of a preference thing. That being said, I'd have to rate the 2009 as a B+, while the 2010 is a solid A."
"Over all this is a world class brew. The style says some may not care for the sourness. I think the sour cherries are brilliant in the brew. This beer drinks way to easy for this style. Kudos again to the brewery who took over the old Stone building!!!"
"glassware: tulip"
"T: A lot of tart cherries, some vanilla and a little bit of a funk/sour flavor. This had a lot of wine qualities to it and the tannins were definitely present and gave it a dry feel. Overall, I'm glad I tried this one, but I don't think it's worth $40 for a bomber."
"D - I really enjoyed this wild ale a lot. Really good spectrum of flavors that came together to form a delicious beer. I would love to try this again."
"3.5 D: Despite Tomme's usual carbonation antics, this is actually pretty good. This would be one hell of a beer with carbonation. This has a lot of things done right, but one major thing done wrong. Shame on you Tomme for releasing your namesake with such a major flaw."
"Drinkability is low to moderate on this vintage. I stress this vintage. I have heard good things about the others but try to stay away from"
"Overall - Sadly, I have two more of these in my cellar. Perhaps with time they may gain a little carbonation. I obviously know LA is known to have carbonation issues but you would think after all this time, and with there being carbonation in this year's Red Poppy, it would have been fixed. I refuse to rate this high because of the slight hype around this or to justify the price. To be honest, this was probably the worst $16 dollars I have spent on beer. The flavors didn't impress me, the beer was flat, and the alcohol was noticeable. Red Poppy was much more enjoyable. I really haven't given LA much business in the past due to known carbonation issues and this has affirmed I will pretty much stay away from them in the future. They do put out some good stuff but I refuse to drop that much money on a beer that does not perform. Additionally, don't try to claim ""it is supposed to be that way."" There should be SOME carbonation. Mine had ZERO. It was a flat boozy mess. Not impressive at all."
"Beer pours flat, little sign of carbonation, whisps of lacing on the top. Dark body with reddish hues, murky and smooth looking. Aromas are immediately cherries and brett, slight smoke, sweet malt, slight vinegar, cinnamon, honey. Taste is interesting and complicated; chocolate cherries quickly upfront, followed by bourbon vanilla, some malt somewhere in there. Slight alcohol burn, not really too tart; sourness contribution could be confused between cherries or bacteria. Slightly medicinal but well balanced flavors. Slick mouthfeel, barely perceptible carbonation tickles the tongue, medium bodied. Pretty darn drinkable, if any one of the characteristics got too out of whack, drinkability would have suffered for me. It will be interesting to see how this one ages and tastes in a year."
"Super drinkabilty for the style & ABV"
"D-For 11% and despite it being un-carbed, I am hugely impressed with this beer. I could rink a bomber easy - with such a huge beer, thats saying something"
"I am saddened that I was cursed with a sub-par example of this beer, made all the more painful due to the hefty price tag ($16 for 375ml). I am sure that with a bit of carbonation this is a world class brew (or with a bit more alcohol a great port like fermented beverage). Perhaps one day, I will venture back to the North County to try Cuvee De Tomme again. Until then, I am left with the memory of what may be the poorest value beer I have ever purchased."
"This was the highlight of the tasting for me personally. A beer I've been seeking out for quite some time and it was really nice to be able to sample this one."
"drinkability is really hard to judge - i was happy with a 6oz pour and wouldn't have wanted another one, it was just so so so complex and intense, like no sour or wild ale i've ever had - wholly unique, very interesting and very wierd."
"D: Ok but not great."
"D. Like most wilds, a little bit goes a long way, but this is one I wouldn't mind sipping for quite a while. Very nice and worth seeking out."
"Serving type: bottle, 375ml"
"D: Actually quite tasty. I had no problem finishing my glass. I think the heavy dose of cherry helped a lot for me."
"D: What can I say? A lot of differences of opinion here. It was labeled as an AWA, but this is hardly that. The finish is long and boozy heavily on bourbon and less on sour. Some slightly unpleasant vinegarish tingling throughout. Well-crafted, but a little hot."
"2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a green Man snifter. Poured a deep reddish brown with a half finger very light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherries, sour, and oak. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherries, sour, tart, oak, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really glad that I got a chance to try this one. I wish I had a 2010 vintage to be able to compare as this one seems like it might have dropped off in the flavor department some as compared to it being fresh in my opinion. Still very good, don't get me wrong, but could be better. Had a nice aroma and decent flavor here. Worth trying without a doubt."
"Drinkability is a little low because the stuff is just so dang expensive ($40 at the goat) and isn't too easy to find around my parts. This was the 09 version."
"Overall, a really interesting, unique, complex beer that I enjoyed for the most part. Definitely has its flaws but certainly worth trying. The sour component works well with the quad and the cherries are very nice. I would love to try an older vintage of this sometime to see how it evolves over a couple years."
"Bottle. 2007 vintage. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass a slightly murky reddish mahagony color with a slight tan colored head that collars around the glass. Swirling does does some minimal head. Sour cherries right off the bat in the nose along with acetone sourness. Oaky as well. Wow, that has a lot going in the flavor. Sourness right off the bat with a malty belgian backbone. Some red wine type flavors as well in the end along with a dry finish. Light/medium mouthfeel. The 11.5% is in there but not really all that noticeable. Very easy drinking and smooth. Overall, I am very pleased with this in so many ways, the flavors are really nice, the sour/tart is there but not too much, and its carbonated nicely."
"Drink- 11% and no trace of it on each sip. I'm glad my bottle shop had one for me. This was a great beer. Sad I could only buy 1."
"D: Very good and great example of the style."
"D= Tasty indeed. Wish it was carbonated but there is nothing here. Flat as a board."
"D - Ok drinkability and nice blend of the fruity esters with the wild funk but after the great wilds of the night so far, it's the least drinkable on the totem pole."
"2007 bottle, thanks Tom. Pours a dark coca-cola brown with a small wisp of a white head. Really sour initial aroma, a bit of sour cherries and balsamic vinegar. First impression upon sipping is of a strong malt base, with chocolate and some dark fruits, yielding to a lighter sourness, heavy with sour cherries and apple vinegar. Nicely integrated flavor. The malt is surprisingly strong here, the strong, heavy malt is a signature of most lost abbey brews I find, and it actually works kind of well with this one. Some alcohol heat around the edges, which makes sipping a bit of a chore at times. The finish is long and leans heavily on the light sour components. Some slightly unpleasant vinegarish tingling throughout. Well-crafted, but strangely heavy and a little hot."
"D: it was drinking good and for some reason everytime I have CdT it taste slightly different."
"Lost Abbey has a lot of detractors, but thus far they are 2/2 with me (this and Deliverance). I can honestly say that this is one of the best wild ales I've ever had and a truly unique beer for fans of sours."
"EDIT: drinking a 2008 bottle, very different then fresh. The nose is muted, but the flavor is kicked up. Much more sour, acetic, vinegar, and sour cherry. Still very low carb even after almost three years. Glad I had this when I did. Drink 'em if you got 'em because I think its peaking."
"(D)- A unique and dynamic, yet fitting take on the style. Obviously a darker representation, but it does pull it off well. Worth acquiring and enjoying. I rather enjoyed this one."
"The nose is heavy with a deep, dark red wine (shyraz or maybe syrah) scent. The other heavy aroma is a brown sugar/alcohol smell. There are hints of cherry and earthy smells. The beer has a sour initial taste, with undertones and highlights of vanilla, dark cherry, and wood. The sourness stays through to the aftertaste, but moderate and mild. There is almost a chocolate note in the later flavors, but a bit too spicy to be sure. The finish is crisp and sharp, and the beer has a sour linger in mouth. Not a beer to sit around and pound, by any means. I can absolutely appreciate what they were trying to do, but this one just isn't for me."
"Glad I got a few of these, they are tasty and worth a try. Interested to see if they self-carbonate in the future but if they do I doubt they'd change my score much."
"D - well, this one is a bit al over the place. big and bad, cures the biggest sour craving. split a big bottle of this with at least 4, if not 5 people. can be a bit wearing after a bit of time. the 11% is virtually non-present."
"D - Good beer, quite drinkable for 11%, I liked this quite a bit and would gladly drink more."
"Drinks well for being 11% and the stickiness isn't bad, tartness and vinegar balance really well with the malts, for a nice drinkable beer."
"Taste is quite sharp and tart, it's got a very sharp funkiness that's quite unique an tasty. Finish is sharp and funky, quite good."
"Grr, this is a beer I have been looking forward to trying for a while. Though once again, a flat beer has ruined another Lost Abbey for me."
"Drinks: balanced. It's amazing that such a striking sour character could be so masterfully reigned in, but Cuvee de Tomme accomplishes it by loading the other side of the seesaw with sugary dark fruits. A highlight of the day."
"This beer is just gorgeous. This crisp carbonation and sourness are perfect for the fresh salmon burgers I threw together. They even match the mini-cupcakes that my wife brought home. Each sip refreshes the palate perfectly. It's medium to full bodied, and it tastes like it's a 3% abv beer. Incredible! I saved a few ounces in the bottle to try tomorrow, but I could easily have finished the entire 750ml. An 11.5% beer that I can drink like a session beer. Incredible!!!! OMG this beer defied all odds -- 7 years old and less than ideal storage conditions -- and it is just beautiful. I have one more Cuvee de Tomme from 05, I think, so I think I may sit on it 2 more years to get to 7 years old as well =)"
"D: Quite tasty and profound. This is a great treat to share several ways. Recommended."
"Pours flat, dark ruddy brown, a shade browner and lighter than red wine. Darker than I remember. Slight oxidization but it's very light. There is lots of oak and deep fruits, cherries, and must. Flat mouth, no carbonation, with a tartness that is not even close to the 09 I reviewed. Not much sourness but a bit of acid. Drying mouth and slick. A little too old but amazingly good for its age."
"This beer is nearly still. In fact, I think more carbonation left the bottle when opening it than what was actually in solution. Oily on the palette. Pretty unpleasant mouthfeel."
"Overall this really is a fantastic beer and shows why people continue to buy LA beers despite the occasional QC issue. Well worth a shot."
"D- Outrageously drinkable for a beer as big as it is. Just a fantastic high-powered sour that has me loving it more and more as I drink it -- one sip begs for another."
"Send some of this to the East Coast!"
"Not a bad beer at all, though if I want a beer that fits this mold, I would normally just reach for an Abbaye de St. Bon-Chien if it was available in my area - many of the same characteristics (down to the still mouthfeel if sampling one of the 375 ml Grand Cru variants), only with just a bit more sourness, and just a bit more refined in all the right places. Regardless, this is still a very good beer, and certainly something I would be proud of if I had brewed it."
"D: This is a very easy beer to drink, the alcohol is hidden and the sour aspects are not overpowering."
"D- This is a VERY good wild ale. Its a nice dark wild ale that is quite complex and quite sour-but not over the top."
"D-quite tasty, great balance. i really enjoyed the the hint of earth to up the complexity with the sour tart cherries. the oak is played in pretty well also."
"A world-class beer for sure and worth seeking out. I'm really bummed now that I don't have another. Time to start planning that next California trip."
"d - I thought this was an amazing sour, one of the better ones I've had. It had an amazing sour cherry and dark fruit taste, with hints of oak and funk. Would love to try again."
"D: The ABV is well hidden and the acidity is never overpowering, goes down remarkably easy."
"D - This beer was very well-received by the whole group, it was considered world-class by several tasters. I would highly recommend it; even if it was totally flat (which it wasn't) it would still taste and smell good."
"D - Pretty good at 11% the alcohol is there but similar to the way that its there in wine."
"This is certainly a beer to slowly enjoy and savor. I am very happy to have multiple bottles of this gem. Well done Tomme."
"I was happy to have finally tried this. The abv is a bit much though. It's hitting my sour fix, but it falls a bit flat since it doesn't have enough depth to hold it up."
"Cheers!"
"Light body for an 11% , light carbonation , making it a little more drinkable than if the carbonation were higher. Cork had a muted pop"
"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!"
"Pours a beautiful dark mahogany color, capped off with a nice collar of off white head. Huge aromas on this one, bourbon, vanilla and tons of cherry. Taking a sip, I get some nice sour funk, followed quickly by bourbon, tart cherries, yeast and alcohol. Nicely carbonated, refreshing and delicious. Outstanding."
"D - As far as a Wild Cherry, this is awesome. No alcohol, I could have sessioned this by myself, but enjoyed sharing with others."
"The first time I had it was at Stone on a Sunday, when sours are 25% off. What a ""deal""! I loved it instantly, because it's a combination of so many things I love about beer. Quad-style, sour, mmm"
"Overall, this may be the best beer I have had from Lost Abbey. I have yet to try some of their rarer releases, but this brew is top notch. Lots of flavor, complex, and unquestionably sour. My only gripe is the price tag, which is the case with almost all Lost Abbey brews. With that being said though, I will be in search of some of their finer offerings in the future. Thanks again for the taste Dave!"
"Consumed: 3/12/2010"
"M/D - Medium bodied and a prickly carbonation. Sourness lingers after the beer is gone. Very easy drinking with a well masked 11%"
"Drinkability: Really good and pretty smooth, but this is still a hefty beer. I was happy with my ~6oz. sample."
"D - Would definitely seek out again, pretty sessionable but a brew to be shared among good friends."
"The bottle opened with the faintest ""pop"" and was poured from 750ml bottle into a red wine glass. Its appearance is dark brown. Mahogany. Fine leather bound books. No carbonation, a few random bubbles from the disturbance of the pour remain on the surface. No lacing. Quite boring in appearance. The smell is great however. Smells of sour cherries, caramelized sugars, and funk. The bourbon barrel comes through. The taste threw me for a loop. It was quite sour, more sour than the smell led on and oh so sweet on my tongue. Black cherries are very noticeable as well, staying with you from start to finish. The bourbon barrel aging gives this beer some nice complexities, especially in the taste. To me it gives it a vanilla flavor in the mix. Very good. It is very drinkable and the alcohol is very well hidden for eleven percent. My only complaint would be the lack of any carbonation which I hear is a problem with the Lost Abbey beers. Glad to get to try it."
"Good job!!!"
"d- the 11% sneaks up on you and completely whacks you about half way through. i cant imagine drinking more then a 750ml of this without accompanying it with a bottle of tums. great to split a bottle with someone wanting to try an ass clenching sour though!!"
"Cuvee De Tomme is good beer. Damn near very good. At least that's true of this 2008 release. I like the flavor quite a bit, but it seems to be held back by its all-inclusiveness. There's a little too much going on. It's tough to appreciate all of the flavors due to the volume of flavors present. Perhaps it's just me. It's good beer, but I wouldn't say it's special. I don't have any hesitation recommending it, but stick with a single bottle."
"Overall, this is a solid sour beer. I am surprised by how sour it is. I don't know if this is a quad base or not, but the cherries take over the base beer. I am a big fan of this beer. I want more."
"I had been wanting to drink this for a long time and while good, its not exactly what I'm looking for in a Wild Ale, especially when a bottle cost $30. All that said, I will probably give it another try next year."
"Taste is complex, its strong and sweet, the sweetness of the beer is almost immediately cut by the sour. There is a hint of cherry flavor in here and then at the end some oak. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is really good. Its a good beer, I wish I could try a more recent vintage to compare."
"D- Amazing, many thanks to Mawr for this. Absolutely delicious."
"D: A good beer and very complex with a... strange mouthfeel. I really appreciate it but like I said before, this one is hard to understand... like a cross between a sour and an imperial stout. I'd like to try it again though, maybe with a bigger pour to try to unmask the mystery here."
"A really good beer. Complex, interesting and tasty - what more can you ask for?"
"Drinkability: Drinks nicely, like a fine wine. Eleven percent ABV could catch up to you, but one glass is more than enough."
"D: A very nice sipper. Other than the slight warming no real hint of the ABV at all. One could easily put down a 375 by themselves but it is probably a beer that is best to share."
"D: This is great. A sipper, but very tasty and drinkable. I poured a glass for my friend Jessica who isn't into craft beers at all, and she even appreciated it."
"D: Very tasty all around and one that sat well for quite some time. Glad I picked this one up."
"4.5/4.5/5/4/4"
"Dark burgundy with amber around the edges, no head due to the high alcohol and low hops profiles. Good mouthfeel, not thick and syrupy, light in the mouth for having an ABV at this level. Low visible carbonation. Smell and taste are redolent of sour cherries, red wine, and caramel malts. Taste is more oud bruin or Flemish sour than American wild ale (as the style has been listed). Lamic-like tartness, though when I think wild ale I think brettanomyces yeast, barnyard, horse blanket and funk--none of that here. Great tasty and rich malt vinegar flavors but with balanced astringency that slopes in a nice dry finish. Cherries are the dominant flavor, though there's also plums, oak, zinfandel and tempranillo grapes, lemon juice acidity. A tasty beer, perhaps not worth the price (the price--$16 for 375 ml--is the only reason this isn't an A. For $16, you can get true Belgian in a big bottle), but it's nice to see an American brewer making this style."
"Maybe I lucked out with the carbonation? Who knows, but it was a tasty beer. Wish I had an 09 to compare it with."
"Had this a couple times in different vintages..Poured a deep cloudy reddish color ale with a small bubbly head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma of sour and tart notes with some cherries and light oak notes are all noticeable. Taste is close to a Flander red style beer with loads of oak and cherry notes and a well balanced tart finish. Balanced acidity but still has a nice bite to it more tart wine like than anything.."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy reddish color ale with a small bubbly head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma of sour and tart notes with some cherries and light oak notes are all noticeable. Taste is close to a Flander red style beer with loads of oak and cherry notes and a well balanced tart finish. Balanced acidity is well appreciated while Brett is very hard to notice. Body is quite full with limited filtration and low carbonation. Well made though not s complex as some of the staple of the style such as Rodenbach."
"O - freaking love this beer. Wish it was cheaper, but damn Tomme has something amazing here. This beer makes me look past all the lost abbey hate and appreciate a great brewer. Get this beer if you like sours."
"75cl bottle thanks to Guy411. Working my way through the LA sours, and a pattern emerges: they take a hefty base beer and decimate it with brett and whatever bacteria they are using. Oh, and I'm still 100% on carbonated bottles from Port/Lost Abbey, with this being my 28th rating for them, so there. Brown-red color with a small tan head. Lots of sour cherry in the aroma, with some barrel, light bourbon, and clean sour that isn't coming from the cherries. The flavor has a rich malty base that is toppled by a dry cherry tartness. Alcohol is present but light for a beer this big. Then, sourness. Lots of it, and that is impressive considering the base beer was a pretty malty quad. Lots of cherry flavor, but there is so much going on that the balance seems about right. Full bodied with a medium carbonation level and smooth texture. A huge sour, but very well balanced. Great beer."
"Overall: An 11% beer that tastes this good? D - licious."
"Taste: It's good, but labeled completely wrong in my oppinion. This is straight up a sour. There's no resemblance to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale what-so-ever. Very decent sourness from the cherries, and once again...the dominant quality. Enjoyable...and very tasty."
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed as I had such high hopes. Its an ok beer, not a great sour though. It is not complex enough for me, perhaps it ages over time. But for me, if you want a sour there are a lot better options."
"I'm going to enjoy drinking this and will not need another for quite some time, mostly because my memory of it will be good and intense, of which I will want to savor. Overall, this is very good and drinkable, but the intensity gets it docked a small amount."
"rich and full bodied."
"This is a very nice beer, with lots of good things going on. Unfortunately, the lack of carbonation is a problem. I'm reminded of Consecration which has a wonderful prickly carbonation, and this beer could use some of that. I'm not going to bother ripping Lost Abbey on this account, I;m just a little bummed because otherwise it's a really nice beer."
"I don't know if I would ever pay the asking price of a bottle or if I will ever have the option to purchase one, but I can say that this is without question one of the most satisfying beers I have tasted. Between the Thursday and Friday GABF sessions and the Pints for Prostates Rare Beer Tasting, I had the opportunity to try hundreds of this countries finest beers. This may have been my favorite."
"Alcohol well-covered, helping it to drink well. An interesting brew that is unique and creative. Quite a bit going on here. Sour/funky, sweet with a very dry finish."
"- Overall one of the better brews I have had from Lost Abbey.... super drinkable, 11% Alc? No way... cant tall a bit at all. Tasty and good. Worth $30? Hard to say.... I would much prefer $18 lol... but the price and/or trade doesn't affect opinion here in this review of the actual brew."
"J"
"mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated, but it works because its a sour. also a little thin, but nothing really to complain about. the drinkability is fantastic. i want to spend an hour and a half on it, but at the rate im going it wont last 45 minutes."
"Rushed review....my apologies."
"I'll have to admit this is one of the most ambitious brews I've come across when it comes down to the overall concept. It's very good, but a little 'busy' for my tastes. I'd rather have a great Bourbon aged dark ale or a great sour than a very good combination of the two."
"Overall, for the price I will pass on this beer every time. So many better, similar beers out there, such as Consecration or Cascade Sang Royal. Bottom line, why pay big bucks for a beer when the brewery can't even fix their quality control issues? I'd rather support other brewers that don't try to rape their customers with insane prices and horrible QC issues."
"Overall, what more needs to be said? This is an incredible American Wild Ale that rivals my favorite at the moment, Consecration. I would love to side-by-side it with a Red Poppy, but alas, Red Poppy is no more (as of this review)."
"D: I polished this bottle of fairly quickly. Certainty an enjoyable brew."
"Poured into a chalice a dark brown color, very little carbonation, basically a little fizzy light tan head, no sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slight yeast, tart, with some dark fruits. The taste is tart, malty, slightly yeasty, with some dark fruits. Medium body. Drinkable, kinda dissappointed with this brew, it should have been way better."
"D - High ABV, very expensive, but oh so delicious."
"D: A great all around experience. Great flavor and sourness."
"While this beer tastes great I really wish it had as much cherries in the flavor as in the nose. This is about as sour a beer as I've had (minus La Folie). A great one for sure, but I'm not sure if its worthy of all the hype its gotten. Still, I would definitely have this again"
"Fantastic beer. Great at cellar temp. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Poured into a Maudite Tulip. Looks the color of coca cola, only no head. A few small bubbles cling to the surface but quickly disappear. Smells of raisins, cherries, vanilla, brown sugar, a touch of vinegar and alcohol. Taste is sour cherries, tart acidic flavor with some funk. Slight vanilla, vinegar and a touch of alcohol. Carbonation is almost non existent, mouthfeel is a sour syrupy mess, body is medium. I think I would have really enjoyed this one if it were carbonated, but as is Meh."
"Moderate carbonation, light, airy, soft, and creamy. The finish is medium to high dry as well. Fairly easy to drink despite the high abv. The 08 batch was really good, the current 09 batch is even better though and I would give it a slightly higher score on taste!"
"EDIT: Cracked open another 2009 bottle in November 2010. My previous description is accurate, but I need to bump up my scores. Really a wonderful beer, the sour cherries and oak complement each other perfectly."
"D - This is a flavorful and complex beer that is able to blend some strong flavors and make them work well together. I can't say I'd advocate paying $30 for a beer very often but this one was worth it."
"D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a little warm at times but seems to always to stay just under control. The high alcohol makes this one a sipper but having more than one over the course of an evening isn't out of the question. This really is an all around good brew. It borders on great but appearance really drags the score down along with my impression of the beer. It tastes great but really doesn't look very appealing. I'd have it again though...no question about that."
"D: Well drinkable especially for me since I'm not really into sours. The flavor is definitely interesting and complex and even though you can tell it's a big beer you are enticed to want more sips."
"Thanks, Chad!"
"Drinkability: At around $30 a bottle, this is worth it for a few people to split. I would've been happy to drink this myself, but I would 1) want more people to experience than just me, of course, and 2) want to save a bit of money. Five people could easily enjoy this and talk about it for a long time while sipping. But wow, yes, this was an experience. It's unlike any beer I've had, and as the years go on, we'll see what kind of copycats emerge, and if someone can actually attempt to do better. This was my first Lost Abbey brew, and I hope I'm able to afford and find many more as they keep brewing."
"Good stuff!"
"D: This beer is very easy to drink for its ABV and has fantastic flavours. Do I think it's worth $30, no, but if it was half the price I'd be all over a couple bottles."
"Drinkability: As with sours of late, I could really drink these all night. This 11% warmed as it went, but so, so drinkable. I couldn't have done the whole 750 by myself due to the sneaky ABV, but I certainly could have taste-wise. Fantastic beer that I couldn't get enough of, if only it weren't 30 bucks a bottle. This and the Duck Duck Gooze from Lost Abbey have me hooked on the tart sours, and I couldn't be more excited about the horizon of sours to come."
"After the pour and my nervousness about the Lost Abbey carbonation issues I was worried that the mouthfeel would be disappointing, but that is just not the case. The beer is pleasantly carbonated enough to balance the intense sour cherry flavor and the dry finish is incredibly palatable and refreshing. The 11% abv is hard to detect, aside from a slight (but very pleasant) warming of the belly after a few sips. This is a beer that I will definitely pursue in the future, and a great introduction to Lost Abbey."
"D - So easy to drink for 11%, it's just dangerous. If I wanted a nice Pinot Noir or Cab and had a bottle of this laying around, I'd have to do a coin toss to pick what I'd like to drink. CdT or a Napa Cab/Russian River Pinot...it's that good."
"[1x]"
"Overall: One of Lost Abbey's better beers. Cheers!"
"I scored a few bottles of this from tproko07, thanks for the chance! Pours a dark red color, without much head. In the nose is dark fruit, vinegar, Sour nose of sour fruit....very nice. Taste is medicinal at first, then becomes fruity, leaving ona mix of the two. Mouthfeel is between light and medium, and very drinkable. Overall, this is a very savory Wild beer. I only wise LA would release a year round sour beer. Either way, seek this one out. Cheers."
"D- The drinkability factor is very high given the richness of the flavor coupled with a high ABV. I found that I had to pace myself with this one."
"D - You'd better like cherries, because this is a bucket of the most sour, tart cherries you'll ever have! With that said, the cherries work nicely with the Brett and oaky notes here. While it's not overly complex, this is definitely a tasty cherry-infused wild ale."
"Drinkability? I'd have no problem finishing a 750 never mind this 375! This *is* a top notch brew and I'm very happy I made the commitment to get some. *Very* happy!"
"Overall, a pretty solid beer. Lacking a touch of complexity I thought, but worth a try for sure."
"Amazingly complex brew here. Very tart with cherry and wild yeasts. Finish is dry with hints of acidity and thick wood tannins. Bourbon shows through on the middle with fig, prune, black cherry, hints of cocoa, candied licorice, a bit of alcohol and thick oak on the finish. Carbonation level is spot on for this brew and really lets the beers flavors show forth. This is an amazing beer."
"Having read so much about this beer, I was glad to finally try it. I do feel the carbonation was not an issue with this one. I would love to try this one with some age on it to see what happens."
"Pours a light red color with a small head that fades quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The carbonation seems very light. The aroma is excellent. Raisins, dark fruit - cherries, some tartness, and a touch of wood. The flavor is much more than the aroma led me to believe. Lots of dark fruit flavors meld together with a decent malt profile and cherries with a touch of wood. Extremely tasty. The mouthfeel is moderate as some of the sweetness sticks to the tongue. The drinkability is wonderful - the alcohol was a total surprise when I glanced at the bottle and saw it was over 10%! Fantastic."
"It takes balls (and a big ego) to name a beer Cuvee De Tomme, but if you can back it up... This style-busting, dizzyingly complex ale is yet one more reason why The Lost Abbey is on my list of top-10 favorite American craft breweries. If they keep pushing the envelope and pay attention to quality control, they should be there for a long time to come."
"D: My only complaint is how expensive it is. I refused to buy a bottle because I've had some issues with flat beers from Lost Abbey, and I didn't want to take the risk again. But on-tap it's quite good, and I'd definitely have it again if I saw it."
"Drinkability- Right up there with the best wild ales I have had. Incredible drinking beer worth seeking out."
"Coca-cola appearance. Thin film forms on top. One of the most complex aromas I've come across. The layers are incredible. Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, cherries, raisins, vinous notes, a slight nuttiness, oak, vinegar. The best thing is that not one of the flavors overpowers another. Some of the beers with bourbon components are so blatantly overpowering, but this was far from the case here. Lightly carbonated. Great mouthfeel, alcohol is barely noticeable for its ABV. Some tartness is present but there is just so much going on here that no one flavor dominates throughout. A vanilla-bourbon sweetness marries with the alcohol to help conceal it. Very glad that I was able to stock up on the 2009 batch- I will be enjoying this beer for years to come."
"D: For what this is, it's very well done. The tartness masks a good slice of that 12% ABV. There's complexity but balance, which makes it a great sipper. If anything, it's heavy on dry, woody characteristics and I don't mind that. Def wish I would have grabbed another bottle or two."
"D- If this bottle was available year round i'd pick it up every month even at 30 bucks. Terribly smooth for what it packs, and im pretty light headed now! good night!"
"pretty drinkable all things considered, that is if your into very sour liquid."
"Carbonation sticks to the side of the glass but barely shows up on the head as just a skim of graham cracker colored lace. Body is a deep murky root beer brown in color. Nose is very bright and luscious with tones of barely ripe cherries, vanilla, cola, acidic vinegar tartness and ripe dark fruit. Mouth really wasn't ready for this attack of sour on the tongue. Tartness is very acidic and borders on vinegary with definite cherry tones. The fruits from the dark ale are truely there surrounded by all the tartness. Dark fruits play more of a role as the beer warms developing red wine like tannins. Serve this one on the warmer side. Mouthfeel is lovely with nice tannins and tart dark fruit. Drinkability is so good that I really never wanted this one to end."
"This is the kind of beer that a wine snob that is anti-beer would appreciate. Many of the characteristics of Red Poppy are present in the Cuvee but I must say I like this better. Maybe a bit more sour, not as musty, less dry and astringent, not aged as long in oak barrels, smoother and more drinkable. I certainly am glad I tried it, but at $29.99, I paid a bit much and would not go seeking this out again at that price level. My review is not taking price into consideration. Throw style out the window on this one - nothing like a Belgian Strong Dark, actually I'd say it is a wild/sour/flanders combination of sorts. Wow Lost Abbey, I am impressed."
"D - The abv is completely hidden. Interesting but doesn't really blend together as well as I would like."
"D - Well, not very drinkable, so this scores a little higher on RB than BA. Great beer overall though!"
"Overall: Very unique beer that probably will age very well. One of my favorites."
"Pours a hazy dark garnet red almost brownish color with 1 finger of tan head into a Lost Abbey tulip glass. Head fades fairly quickly leaving only a little ring of tan and some thin lacing. Smells of oak, sour cherries, apples, light vinegar, red wine, and some funk. Tastes of sour cherries, raisins, wet oak, vanilla, caramel, light barnyard funk, Belgian candy, and red wine with a splash of alcohol in the finish. Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation. Fairly thick clinging feel, sour with a light tartness, sweet with a very dry finish and some warming alcohol presence. An amazing and unique brew from Lost Abbey, a sipper, but enjoyable from start to finish."
"Big, thick body delicately complimented by a soft carbonation and a dry acidic finish. Another classic artisinal ale from Tomme."
"Cuvee de Tomme is medium-full bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a vinous mouthfeel. This is, without a doubt, my favorite sour cherry beer, and one of my favorite beers period. I can't wait for the next release."
"More similarities than differences when compared to the 08 version, but the 09 version for me is much better. Not as tannic, oaky and just more balance in the beer. The sour cherries are delicious fresh. Scores are still for the 08 version."
"A tasty brew for sure and a nice change of pace for sour beers for me."
"D- Drink is off the charts but alas I probably won't see this for some time so I'm savoring my ounces. My 1st ""sour"" from lost abbey is a winner. This kind of reminds me of a flanders red beer. This was a pleasure to drink and everyone should get to try this at some point, worth seeking out."
"Overall: s'okay"
"Taste was where it all came together. This beer is just so wonderfully put together. Every aspect made sense together. Dark Cherries, caramelized sugar, oak, the wonderful tartness..it was a complex treat."
"D: Wanting is more pleasing a thing than having. Thanks to Mr. Spock for that insight. In this case, my longing was well rewarded. This is a fantastic beer, so complex and nuanced. The only drawback is the strength; it hits you like a hammer. Well done."
"The beer pours dark red/brown/black, depending on how it is held to the light. The only signs of head is the slight ring around the edge. Aromas of black cherry (comes of Jolly Rancher-ish), soy sauce, slight musty basement, and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is nice and fruity. Loads of tart cherry and plums. Warm alcoholic finish. Silk and oil over the palate. Moderate carbonation. This is less like a beer and more of a wine or high end liquor. Thanks a million Mike."
"2008 Bottle. The beer pours a deep mahogany with a tiny tan head, that disipates quickly. The smell is of sour cherries, dark caramel malts (raisins?), and mellow oak/bourbon. Wonderful. The taste is well balanced between the sour/tartness from the cherries, the wild yeasts/bacteria and the deep caramel malts and vanilla like flavors from the barrel. The beer finishes with a tartness and slight tannic finish. The after taste is vanilla and sour cherries. I love this beer and this style. The mouthfeel is full yet not too big. This beer has many wine like properties in smell, taste and mouthfeel. This beer is extremely drinkable, but at 11% abv be careful. I could drink 10 of these no problem. I have to say that this is my favorite of the Lost Abbey yearly releases. Some of the special one off sours are excellent, but I am really glad that this one is released every year. Can't wait for the 09 due out soon."
"D: Very drinkable. 12% would definitely sneak up on ya."
"This was a 2008 12.7oz bottle obtained in a trade with organicbrewer. The label states it was brewed and bottled in San Marcos. The beer is dark murky brown color with a thin tan foam. The smell is way complex, sour, cherry, whiffs of alcohol, raisins, strong and rich. The taste is wickedly good too although I'd swear it's a Flanders Red by flavors. Very sour without being too puckering, nice cherry and raisin, almost a little chocolate. The body is full, this is filling and delicious and burns just a little going down."
"Not a big fan of the cherry bits in the beer, but other than that an excellent beer."
"Color is very dark red with a beige colored head that recedes to a ring around the glass. Smell of acetic acid, cherries, caramel, oak, dark fruits, and brown sugar. Taste is sour with cherry pits, maple, bourbon, dark fruit, and caramel sweetness. Medium carbonation with medium body. Good stuff, I look forward to trying it with a bit more age on it."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"2009 - Even less carb. The last 3 caged corked epic beers I have gotten from LA have been virtually flat. Guess they 'meant to do that' but it's not a big turn on for me."
"The 2009 release, which reflects the score since it is the one out there, is a disgrace. Flat, uncarbonated, a very expensive drainpour. It unfortunately reflects their total lack of quality control, since it is the 6th different flat beer I have from them."
"Pours reddish brown in color. No head to be found on the pour. Smell is lots of sour cherry and some woody oak. Incredibly lip puckering and tart. Lots of good sour notes coming through in the flavor. The cherry flavor is perfectly done. Very complimentary to the rest of the beer. Just a hint of alcohol burn in the finish. Fairly thick and coating in the mouth. The cherries, sour and oak work amazingly well together and are incredible. This is a world class beer. One of the few, rare and hyped beers that has lived up to the expectations. Incredible beer."
"Glad I had the opportunity to try this incredibly unique and rare beer. Thanks again, Matt - you've opened my door to the world of unique, American-made sours (I was going to say ""pop by cherry", but it something about that just didn't seem right)!"
"Thanks to srroos for this one."
"Pours cloudy brown with a nearly tan head. Cherrybomb aroma, with nice oak and bourbon. Taste is heavily cherries, but nice brown sugar, nuts, sour yeast, and alcohol round it out so it is not overwhelming. Good bourbon and cognac flavors come through as it warms. I know it says this is a Strong Ale, but it drinks like a liquer."
"Currently on the Top 100....it's not going to last long on ""the list"" if you ask me."
"D: This isn't good, it's great. The tartness is good but not over the top. Nice balance between fruitiness and tartness."
"Poured a deep dark brown color with a small tan head and nice lacing on the glass. Funky, sweet caramel, brett, tart apples some roast, cocoa, and pineapples. Roasty and tart taste, more apples, vinous, some strawberries and sweet finish. Fuckin awesome!"
"Drinkability: Just an extraodinary beer, but not something you can drink on a regular basis; definitely meant for sharing"
"Brown, coppery colour with a thin cap of beige bubbles that formed a thick collar and left a thin skim on top of the beer. Some lacing, not overly sticky. Earthy aroma, tobacco and wood, cherry pits and light bourbon, just a bit of sour cherry. Same in the flavour, but with a mild tartness up front and a hint of acetic acid character in the finish. Very earthy cherry flavour throughout with mild bourbon and vanilla towards the end. Mild caramel and brown sugar, but with a lot of fruity character in the forefront. Fairly acidic, but not overpowering, since there's some sweetness to provide balance. Quite complex, with a lot of wood and funk going on. Medium bodied with soft, creamy carbonation. Some dryness from tannins, mild alcohol warmth. Great stuff and very drinkable. Very nice balance too."
"D- This one's a sipper, but not at all from the alcohol. I actually am just realizing the high abv on this beer. The sourness isn't incredibly intense, but certainly adds a good kick."
"Bottle generously shard by footbalm. Pours a dark red/brown with a small white head. The aroma is just amazing; bourbon, sweet fruit and tart cherries, vanilla, just tons stuff in here. The taste was surprisingly tart; sour cherries, whiskey and bourbon, some funk and yeast, raisins and more of that full tartness from barrel aged sour cherries. A full and medium thick mouthfeel. A great aftertaste like a amazing dessert. Just great. Sour, but also allowing so many other flavors. Thanks Eric for this gem."
"drinkability is great. the alcohol is hidden quite well, and the sour character manages to stay just in check without taking over. great depth to the fruity character. overall, quite a fine beer."
"Pours a hazy dark brownish red, almost burgundy in the corners, thick light tan head forms, drops to a thin ring around the glass, tight bubbles, thin layer, looks real nice. Smell is big, very sour cherries, bread, alcohol, wood, very acidic, lemons, caramel, quite funky, real nice. Taste is very sour, apple juice up front, caramel, lemons/orange peel, sour cherries, quite acidic, bit of funk, lots of alcohol, brown sugar, very woody, pretty intense finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, very mouth puckering finish, but very interesting. Thanks Scott!"
"Pours cloudy and reddish brown, without much head. Smells very sour. I know it's supposed to smell like cherries, but even searching for it it's tough to find behind the sourness. Slight astringent taste just as the beer hits your mouth, but it quickly fades to sourness and dark cherries, which are much more prevalent now than in the smell. Some dark plum and blackberry flavors in the finish. Carbonation is balanced, but it is very acidic in the stomach."
"I've had this a bunch more times and various vintages, and all I can say, is this one has never let me down!"
"D: A beer to be sipped, though not in your face gigantic flavors. I could chug this if I had to. But I'd rather enjoy it. I appreciate the effort to create an interesting, unusual beer."
"375ml 2007 bottle. Thanks a bunch to numbeercruncher for sending this my way. The first sniff was cherries and I expected something akin to supplication but as I poured this into my snifter I quickly realized that this is a totally different animal. Dark brown with red tints. It has a hint of cherry in the smell but there is a lot of barrel going on here, wood, whiskey. The taste is more bourbon barrel, wood, slightly sour interesting mix of flavors. Overall this was interesting but not something I will seek out again. The bourbon flavors are good but don't seem to match up with the sour flavors and really start to wear on me after a while, I wonder what this beer would be like if they had only used wine barrels...."
"A very complex, different beer. Was expecting the quad to come through a bit more, but still quite commendable. I still don't get the lack of carbonation I've had recently in a lot of Lost Abbey beers. This would be that much better with some. Overall, clearly one to get but a little less than I was expecting (maybe its the utter scarcity?). I've got a couple more bottles; we'll see how this one ages."
"Wow! This really was a pleasure to sit down and sip at. A fantastic marriage of Brett, cherries, Quad character, and oak aging that drinks incredibly well for it's size. Another outstanding offering from the Lost Abbey."
"Pours a dark brownish/raspberry color with no head whatsoever. Beautiful smells of tarty, sour fruits with pears, cherries, and raisins. First taste is sweet, tarty and sour with cherries, raisins, green apples, and grapes all meshing into wonderful full sensory experience. Damn this is good. A tad more carbonation, please? - Complex yet mellow. Loud but quiet."
"Small bottle, pours very dark amber, dangerous at 12%, long lasting dark tan head, rich nose of dark malts, wood, dark fruits and cherries. Rich, complex and viscous on the tongue. Cherries, wood, bourbon, more dark fruit, moderate sour permeating the mixture and adding more interest and somehow more complexity. World class creation. Night capper, dessert beer supreme. Please send this to NYC/CT/NJ/Mass sometime soon"
"So tasty I could sip on this one indefinitely. I'm definitely feeling the alcohol warmth, but the taste keeps me wanting more. It's surprisingly rich though, and the tart sour character certainly lends a hand to easily drinking too much too fast. Sip carefully and enjoy each taste."
"M + D: Smooth carbonation, rich feel... I might prefer it a little dryer (more of a preference for the sour cherry kinda thing being a little more dry when it finishes). No real love lost, though, by any means. A good sipper, and that aroma! Definitely worthy of having again."
"Drinkability: This was one strange, crazy beer, though it's exactly what you'd expected from a quad aged in oak barrels with cherries. Not one I'd try often (least of all because of the price tag), but a tasty dessert beer if you're into wild ales."
"Drinkability- This is most definitely a sipper. There is a almost bitter part of the taste that lies somewhere in the middle that seems just bit off to me. It's the only thing that is stopping me from a perfect 5 on the taste. It's definitely hit that sweet spot in terms of sourness and the cherries are really awesome. Great beer and big thanks to Tom for his generosity!"
"Thanks to Weibull for the bottle!"
"Vintage 2008. Rather plain brown in color. Bottle opened with a pop but fairly flat looking beer. Nice aroma of sour cherries and a touch of oak. Reminds me of a very thin or light port. Very complex flavor-cherries and plums come to mind up front. Raisens and dried fruits round out the taste. Somewhat oakey-not overly so. Great sourness upfront but helps to accentuate the fruit not overwhelm it. Nice mouthfeel-lactic sort of tang is good. 12%? Where? A very interesting and unigue beer from a great US brewer. I need to get some more to age. Great stuff, completely enjoyable."
"Tastes heavy dark cherry with drying tart. Syrupy with mild lambic sour. Sour of cherry melds with the sour of the yeast contribution. Woody/pit-like driness. Is this a brettanomyces beer? The horseblanket is extremely low. Md, but slick mouthfeel when sloshed in the mouth. Moderate carbonation and decent drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth airy quality about it. Good carbonation all the way through. This is somewhat more acidic, with more woody tannins than the original black label bottles I've drank. Overall though, it's still a very tasty treat and I'm glad to have had the chance to sample this year's version. Cheers to Lost Abbey and the Sinner's Club."
"The pour was still, muddy brown, not particularly attractive, but who cares? The nose is quite awesome with a pronounced chocolate character, some oxidation, a little more vinegar than I'm used to, and less cherry while staying fruity. The cocoa character is awesome, this beer is surprisingly boozy with a big barrel character. The palate opens with plenty of bourbon with vanilla and brown sugar, more than from the more recent vintages. Some oxidation is present, the bourbon really dominates. The sourness is comparatively lower too. Medium in body and relatively flat, this was a treat to try. If I were to score the S,T,M, I'd give it 4.5,4.25,4.5"
"Dark brown with a reddish. Attractive in a tulip or stem. This beer has one of the best aromas ever. It is an intense combination of wood, chocolate, cherries, vanilla, booze...maybe a little raisin. Those aromas are also in the taste. They seem to layer upon each other...and well. In general I don't like sour or tart beer. This one was a pleasure. The tart cherry made me want to sneak another little sip. Then sweetness would come a long and confuse me. Each little taste was like a guilty pleasure. There was a richness that imo begged for a nice cheese. This beer is not a style I appreciate and it still managed to impress me. This is one of those beers you really have to try for yourself."
"375 mL bottle sampled at Lost Abbey for RBSG 08. Poured into a wine glass. Shimmering amber color with no head or lacing. Aroma is dominated by barrel influences with a big scotch note, musty wood, and vanilla. Flavor starts out with caramel and scotch, then tart overripe cherries shine through mid-palate. The sourness and the booziness make this a bit uneven, but a prime candidate for aging. Medium bodied with a semi-dry finish."
"Overall I was blow away with this one. It was just ridiculously good. I have had very few beers that can live up to this kind of expectation, but this one I am proud to say was one of them. I would love to try this again any day, it was just fantastic. Go out and try to find this one if you can, it is well worth it."
"One problem might be the carbonation level. The flavors, while strong, tend to get a bit one-note. Still, it's sour with a splash of delicious cherries."
"Comparatively dry, clean aftertaste with a bit of lingering sour cherry. Sort of a reproduction of a 19th century, extremely old vintage infected strong ale. Sets a new standard."
"Pours dark brown with a quick khaki colored head that vanishes into almost nothing other than an outer ring on the sides. Swirling the glass leaves a tiny bit of lacing, but not much. Wow, smell is like no other. Tart cherries, honey, bourbon, dates, caramel, raisins, booze, and fig. The aroma with this is so complex and full, I know I'm missing something. Taste begins pretty funky and sour with young cherries and oak. The bourbon appears midway with some bready characteristics and a touch of sweet butterscotch. Aftertaste consists of sour grapes, green apples, and vanilla. Pretty sour all the way through, I could use more dark fruits on the tongue. Light to medium body with a very lively carbonation that stings the mouth. The fact that this beer is 12% is pretty scary. If I was to guess before knowing the abv, I would probably say 6-7%. Very crazy beer to say the least, one that I look forward to seeing what some age will do to it."
"08 375ml at O'Briens in SD. Drinking pretty darn good right out of the bottle. Murky brown color. Nose is slightly sweet, burbon with a super thin head. Tons of aroma when you swirl this around. Great balance, somewhat sour, but then the finish shows the burbon barrels, oak, carmel, burbon alc, very nice. Easy to see the sour aspect and the barrel aged aspect side by side in the same beer. Really nice. Glad to have more to age this for several years before revisiting."
"D: This is an extremely unique offering and I enjoyed it thoroughly though I would definitely term this one as a sipper."
"Carbonate this one properly and I think the score goes way up! that said, still worth a try if you can score one."
"I was excited to finally get to try this, as I'm a big fan of Belgian Darks and of sour beers as well. I think this brewery can be among the best in the country when they get it right. The definitely got this one right. I'm drinking the most recent bottling of this for the review. Pours extremely dark brown with a light head and no real lacing. The aroma is incredible! Dark fruits, rich cherries, bitter cocoa, and some nice sourness seellessly blended. The taste is even better, with those same wonderful cherry and bitter cocoa flavoers melded together with a wonderful sourness that is somewhat restrained, but accented by the tartness of the cherries. Even though the beer is quite sour, the chocolate is so lush and pronounced that the flavors are balanced. It is like a cherry eggcream, with brandied cherries, the best quality dark chocolate, and a wonderfully minerally seltzer and some sour cherry juice added to funk it up. In addition, the oak comes through cleanly, but as a nice additional flavor and supporting actor rather than the star. Not overwhelming at all, it adds a firming woody note and some sweet vanilla. Wonderfully enjoyable! Extremely rich and lush in the mouth, but with the sour cherry that cuts right through that and makes the whole thing tremendously delicious. What a tremendous beer!"
"Bottle from O'Briens. Dark brown color. Aroma of sour cherries, oak and some strawberries. More sour cherries, wood and spices. Very tart with a hint of sweetness towards the end. I was the only one who liked this so I drank the entire bottle. Tastes almost like a port and I've never really been a big fan of ports but this was pretty good."
"Pours a smooth, rich dark muddy brownish color. Smell is slightly sour cherry, and very smooth. Taste is lightly sweet and equally mildly tart with nice semi dry cherry flavor. I thought this one was really nice, and look forward to trying it fresh as well. Thanks for this one, Mike."
"This poured a translucent brown in color with almost no head at all. The nose was sour with vinous scents of red fruit (mainly cherry) and a woodsy element from the oak along with a touch of baking spices. In the mouth it was tart and kept the red fruit from the nose. Given the level of sourness this was amazingly concentrated and came off almost full-bodied as well as light-on-its-feet. Just a wonderful drink with a lingering finish."
"Notes: This just makes me appreciate Enigma that much more. Quite frankly, if this had the same mouthfeel as Bourbon Angel's Share, and vice versa, it would put both these beers in the A+ range."
"Poured from 375 ml bottle from release at Lost Abbey, into a Delirum Tremens snifter. It poured a dark brown color with a small fizzy off white head that was gone in 60 seconds. Smell is tart cherry with spiced plum pudding and a slight brett funk. Taste is raisin, dark fruit, tart cherries, a mellow oak tannin flavor comes out along with vanilla and a warm alcohol feel. Mouthfeel is a medium body with a dry tart feel, the carbonation is low for my taste but all in all one of the best beers out there, highly quaffable."
"D: Not the most drinkable of beers, though I don't think it is intended to be."
"D - Overall, a very interesting and complex beer. You have to love all of the experimentation going on out there in Port Brewing. This beer really stands out on it complexity more than anything else as each sip is a unique experience. Definitely would have trouble having multiple given the alcohol level since I am feeling it a bit after one but that doesn't mean I wouldn't mind having another. Seems like a good beer to have with some cheese and crackers as well. The one thing hurting the drinkability is that the tart flavors are the ones that really last. After they sit in your mouth for a while, I start to tire of them and desire another beer."
"If this beer was not a limited edition/seasonal, limited purchase, expensive beer I could drink a glass of it every night. As it stands, at $15 a pop I am still thankful I bought my limit, and I will ration them accordingly to make them last until the next release."
"Taste: Tart Cherries, Bourbon, Woody, finishes with a dry wine like kick to the taste buds. Pretty Tart and Sour, a little boozy, medium body and carbonation."
"I think Tomme needs to work on the carbonation issues of his beers though. If this beer was carbonated the aromatics would have been more intense, and the pallet could use some liveliness."
"This is probably a bit tastier than the black label (Russian River) version I had before this, but I get the feeling that prior versions achieved a closer-to-perfection result than this; such is the vagaries of experiments with bugs and barrels. I look forward to sampling future vintages in the coming years."
"This is a great dinner beer or substitute for red wine. I'm going to love finishing off this bottle."
"It's interesting, and I keep going back for more... but it's never satisfying. It's an awesome creation, and maybe this just needs a year (or two, or three, or dozen) in the back of a properly temped cellar for this to come together... but for now, this is nothing more than a beguiling, entertaining mess."
"Drinkability: Man, I never would've guessed it was over let alone near being 10% ABV. Very tasty for sure. Well played, Tomme."
"Great beer overall. I love the taste and aroma, and the drinkability is quite high for something so strong. Perhaps something happened in transit from CA to cause the film or cherry skin-like substance. I'm not going to dock the appearance or mouthfeel too much, because I think this is probably just something unique to my bottle. I'd love to try this again."
"t - up front is slight sour cherry and other fruity taste with a whole face full of brettnomyces which seems to be the case with most of lost abbeys special release beers. as this beer tastes perfectly crafted i can tell that with age the beer will come together more as the sour notes are having a hard time blending with the malt foundation. but who can really say anything bad when there is just too much flavor goin on in a beer! so look for my followup review in a couple months."
"Glory, glory, hallelujah!"
"Drinkability: Goes down ridiculously easy for an 11% brew. The balance of flavors and lack of noticeable alcohol make this incredibly drinkable stuff."
"Finally got to try this after hearing so much about it, further proves why Lost Abbey is one of my favorite breweries, the cherries do this beer wonders because I could not stand Judgment Day by itself, will definitely be drinking my other bottles of this in the next couple months, highly recommended"
"Amazing ale the is worth your time and money...get it while you can, each batch is different."
"With this and the Angel's Share, its very easy to see why Lost Abbey brews are so highly regarded, and so sought after. I feel privileged to be close enough to the brewery to have access to these amazing beers. Aquire at all costs!"
"Big thanks to BA OWSLEY069 for sharing this beauty with me. Pours up a dark brown, almost purplish tinge with relatively little to no head other than a thin cream-colored collar. Woody, grape/cherry nose melded with some cedary notes and a healthy dosage of brett. Hints of Bourbon. Lovely sourness with suggestions of a day-old manhattan glass, some sour cherry and significant oakiness. Lightly sweet, yet lightly astringent; but finishes dry. Lowly, yet amply carbonated. Some beers are just difficult for me to formulate words for, this gem is one of them. Mind-blowing, to say the least."
"Third Tasting: The new lost abbey version is pretty much the same exact blend as the Russian River bottling as far as I can tell. Not quite as complex yet, but this was the first batch thjey released at the new brewery. I believe that by the second or third batch at the nrew brewery this will be one of the most magical beers in the land. Truly a piece of modern art."
"Pours a ruddy brown color with garnet hues, fairly hazy, and very still with just a few bubbles appearing. Cherries come through nicely in the aroma, both tart and sweet, like tart cherries dipped in sugar. The sweet cherry blends with a light vanilla and a deep woodiness. A hint of the alcohol in the aroma as well. Taste is also a great blend of sweet cherry flavor along with a well balanced tartness. Light vanilla complements the cherries and a dry oak flavor begins mid taste and lasts in the aftertaste. The 11% is unnoticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium, very little carbonation. A slightly tannic bitterness blends nicely with a drying woodiness in the finish. Delicious beer with the perfect blend of sweet and tart, all accentuated by the cherry and wood notes"
"Had it on tap during the anniversary party at the Lost Abbey and remember the cherries and sourness coming in more than last year's bottled version, but the level of bourbon was very nice and rich as it was last year. The bottle that I opened up tonight, had a pretty big sourness as well, cherries were really good, but I couldn't detect much, if any, bourbon character at all."
"Body is full and smooth with very light carbonation. The aftertaste is long on this one allowing you an extra bit of enjoyment. Deliciously drinkable and worth the hype."
"D- I think this is a very interesting beer and haven't had one like it. Very complicated and complex. I'm not sure if it's one of the best beers I have had but if I get the chance to drink it again I will jump on it."
"Pours a deep, dark amber, small tan head that did not last at all. Aromas that are dark cherries, vanilla, cedar/ oak and bourbon hints. In the taste, sour cherries and a woody sourness, kind of like a huge Rodenbach. A sour, fruity mouthfeel and a dry sour cherry/ bourbon aftertaste. Complex with the sour cherry, bourbon notes, and woody charcteristics. Fantastic beer."
"This was a very intersting offering, nothing else like it in my opinion. To me it was so much like wine, and unfortunately I have little knowledge of wines. Perhaps I am not worthy but I would love to experience again the depth and complexity of this beer..."
"2001 North Vineyard. Tomme produces an unlabeled bottle with cryptic Sharpie markings on the cap. According to him, an unreleased early vintage. Pouring into the glass a cherubic Indian ruby sapphire, glowing with clear glassy edges and a blood rim. Aroma carries one away into an overwhelming presence of intense red fruits from across the board, cherries and raisins percolate in the core of my brain. So bright, alive and refined. Absolutely stunning. Finally passing my lips, this lubricious liquid takes form as a mindnumbing shapeshifter. What first presents itself as a unmarked, world class malt and fruit chimeric belgian strong ale, quickly cloaks itself in a world of sourness. The best of both worlds! Trying to parse out the intricate corners of the beer, Im at a loss, its all too much. Rodenbach Alexander quickly comes to mind. The fruit character so deft, real and upfront. Palate couldnt be more satisfying, yet exacting. Ill review again with a bottle of the current batch, but I needed to expunge my thoughts with this rarest of gems."
"The carbonation is tight and compliments this beer's punch. Highly recommended if you can score a bottle."
"D: Scrumptious. I try not to use that word. Sounds a bit flamboyant and pretentious if you ask me. But in this caseI cant help myself."
"Overall: I have had this beer before, and I will have it again. I love it. What more do I need to say?"
"The beer poured a nice deep brown color with a slight tan head. This beer definitely has the look and aroma of a nice fruity Port. The taste was of a nice low carbonated, earthy brew with slight taste of oaking from the aging process. The 12% abv makes this a nice dessert drink to sip on and that is how I had it. The alcohol is apparent but not overpowering."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Excellent, pleasing texture in the mouth... the gentle prickle of carbonation recedes and becomes almost spongy, giving me something to chew on as I take in all of the flavors. This beer is enormous in its proportions, yet fantastically drinkable. I want to sip and savor this one all night, I know that when it's gone it's gone forever... this is a rare treat that is impossible to replenish. Thank you Tomme and all of your creative, inspired brew team for this experience."
"Thanks again to the D-Man from Long Beach. I got this right around Christmas 2 years ago with a Silver Foil bottle and ""C" bottle as well. Thus I was afforded that chance to see what a little age does to the beer. Thanks yet again Darren!!"
"Another example of two of our craft beer pioneers pushing the envelope (and the discerning drinkers palate) further."
"As the beer descends into my vessel it appears a deep mahogany bordering on russet in color. Rich caramel and chocolate aromas waft upward while the other elements of plums, raisins, grapes and cherries seem delightfully restrained and well masked by the aromatic brettanomyces contribution, oak and leather aromas. The front palate is initially malt accented providing hints of chocolate and roast, which then leads into the mid-palate, where the brettanomyces begins to take over giving a subtle and funky tartness along with notes of cherries and green grapes. The finish is unusually lingering where the chocolate, fruit and oak flavors create a simplistic bliss. Extremely complex flavor. But the most amazing thing about this beer is its feel on the palate. Knowing that it is basically fermented with 100% brettanomyces, I expected it to be fairly light in body, yet it is by far the most coating and texturized brettanomyces infused beers that has ever touch my lips. A true sensory receptor overload with a numbing effect."
"Taste: Excellent body, the cherries and acidity make a wonderful balancing act, the murky, yeasty funk is there and the alcohol is solid and warming at the end. Really not much to look at, but if you can look beyond that it's a phenomenal Beer."
"Oak and red wine as well as some bourbon notes. Dark amber in color with a large fluffy head. Sour fore that tastes like a stab at bourbon vinegar. There is a whole basket full of fruits making appearances here, but the acidic sourness dominates the flavor profile. The overall feel is smooth though and it is a beer that compels you to keep sipping."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable and dangerous - lots of complexities here that are beyond my reviewing skills. Definitely a great example of an American brewers attempt at a Belgian style."
"M &Dr - a little over medium on the tongue and rather complex, well rounded, thick but crisp beverage. I have to have more of this."
"Another jewel available at Chicago's FoBAB last weekend. Colored the belgian mohogany-rust color with little 'floaties' swimming around in there. Lightly fizzy head retention reduced to a film. Aromas are solid, spicy of the Belgian Trippel base but with some serious tartness and fruitiness. Musky, but not yet horse blanket like. Low level sweetness gives way to tart cherries, grapefruit, peaches, and pears. A mild nutty, cocoa, dates sweetness rounds off the lactic sourness to a pleasant tartness. A thin, yet creamy, texture thins into the throat. Mildly puckering, but not astringent or grainy. Warming in the back of the throat accompanies some bittering. Finishes clean and tart. Not as drying as expected. My first Pizza Port offering did not disapoint!"
"This was a definate treat of a beer and I am indebted to Venom for the opportunity!"
"Black label with the big C, no foil. Pretty dark cola color with a tall light tan head, which fell quickly leaving some webbings of lace. Big woody notes come out in the aroma with a strong tartness. There are some noticeable sour cherry notes with a hint of sweetness. Seems like I pick up a faint chocolate smell in there as well. Very interesting aroma. Flavor starts off with a big sour cherry that is sweet at times. Plenty of wood in the flavor as well. No sign of the huge 12% alcohol here. Vinous notes and some funkiness play well also. Plenty of little complexities going on with this one that keep it interesting. Mouthfeel is smooth and surprisingly drinkable. Very unique and flavorful beer that I enjoyed a lot."
"Drinkability...I love this, especially the aroma."
"Burgundy colorregal apperancesoft little tan headWood, earthiness, soft cherries and sweet bourbon on the nosefirst taste impression is tart cherriesmellows into a smooth bourbon soaked cherry flavor.a lot of booze in thisnice sippernice tartness without puckering up your mouth entirelysome very nice componentsnice treatthanks go to Long Beach Bum via Big Hugey for the chance to try this hard to find classic."
"Overall, rather drinkable, once you get used to the OAK."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed 1 1/4"" of airy tan head over the deeply burgundy brew. Head lasts well due to brew's effervescence, and lacing is heavy and frothy. Aroma is fermented cherries, with a creamy vanilla tinge to it. Taste is dominated by the sour cherries, then goes into lots of oaky barrel character, and closes with some alcohol warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great. Interesting brew here, pretty much defies logical description from me."
"As the Irish would say, Saints Forgive Us"
"This beer, when opened, was way too excited to get out of the bottle, it reminded me of Oer Bier, which also always gushes out for me, I imagine the yellow Oer Bier man is in there and is really anxious to get out really fast; maybe this was Tomme trying desparately to race out of the confines of the small 750ml bottle, barely being caught into several glasses before finally calming himself. The beer was tea-coloured, a slightly red-brown with a light tan fluffy head that, after the initial explosion, settled rather quickly to just a thin covering. The first thing that hit my nose was ALCOHOL. Very very alcoholic aroma, followed by cherries and a teeny bit of vanilla hiding in the background. Tasted not as alcoholic as it smelled, it was a bit oaky, very fruity with tart cherries in the forefront, very desirable in my opinion, along with other dried fruits like apricots, plums and grapes. I got a very roasted, almost too bitter aftertaste, but not really off-puttingly bitter. I really really liked this beer, it made me smile big, which was a difficult feat, considering I drank this after my first day back at work from a week-long gorgeous California vacation. But this did the trick, it made me smile. Mouthfeel was hot, and by hot I mean HOT. I felt this beer, Tomme if you will, going down the whole way, it was that warm. Cozy almost. Drinkability is very good because of the smiley cherry goodness, despite the slightly over-alcoholic feel to it. In the end it gave my tongue a tingly sensation, by the end of my glass- yes, I only had half a bottle of this, I felt quiet tingly, almost into my fingers even. It was quite nice and snuggly, and I'm oh so happy I got to try it. Good times. :)"
"Overall, a very interesting and excellent beer. I'm extremely glad that I had a chance to try this."
"Incredible. Complex. The bottle talks about an experiment that led to lightning. A Cantillon plus. The yeast, the sourness,the berry, the cherry. Pizza Port, here I come. Radekfest 05 sample 33, thank you Eyedrinkable. Best 1% of beers I have ever had."
"In any case, the intensity of the alcohol and the flavors limits my ability to consume this moreso than I was hoping but not more than is realistically expected for a beer of this size. Excellent stuff, despite the small gush of beer that emerged at its uncorking."
"Anyways smell is interesting...a fruity port like wine aroma. Aroma and boquet was very intriguing and enticing. However the taste was of acetic acid to me...too much so. I''ve had Belgian sour ales before but this one was pretty much vinegar. No hops whatsoever. I realize that this brewery is well known and makes quality beers but I simply just did not like this one. Maybe it needs several years of aging for the raw, young flavors to mellow out?"
"Tomme, himself, poured this for me recently at the BURP Spirit of Belgium 2005 conference. It was a deep, dark brown color with a light, brown head. The thing that really jumped out on the nose was the scent of alcohol, which prepared me for the somewhat hot mouthfeel, accomapnied by a taste of sour cherries. The finish was extremely sour with the cherry flavor really asserting itself. After a moment, I also began to tatse lightly of sharp cheese. A very interesting drink, mos def."
"Silver foil. Not much head, looks like quelque chose and the aroma has some common notes too. Muddy brown with bold reddish reflects. Although its totally unique, Id compare it to an oerbier reserva. It has an appealing earthy cherries aroma that lets you know from the smell its gonna be thick. Leafy, heavy vinous, airy, bitter, sweet licorice, leather and various brett tangles. Enjoyable aroma, at the limit of 8 and 9 for me, but the taste is even more so. Extremely vinous, working wonders with a sharp cheddar as I imagine it with plenty of cinammon, I could imagine mulling this. Sharp and strong herbal character, rhubard, star anise, cloves. Never feels like 11.5%.. Maple, flowers, chocolate, meat, caramel, mud, ashes etc... Liquorous texture, very syrupy, not quite still, but definitely lparticularly ightly carbonated. Surprisingly never too sweet, warming and drying out. A sensory overload. I plead guilty to still expecting it to be better though as Ive been hunting that one since it had almost no ratings. Thanks Eyechartbrew!"
"Dark brown color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate, fruits and malts. A very complex beer. There are definite and separate flavors of; sour cherries, chocolate, raisins, rum and bananas. Nicely mixed and well balanced. Touch of alcohol bite at 12%. Very smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice, complex beer, hides the alcohol well."
"Originally sampled on 9 March 2003 at Pizza Port's Belgian Beer Fest in Carlsbad, CA. Dark brown pour, it looked like a porter. A nice aroma of sour cherry hits you. As it aired, lots of notes of brandy & complex flavors came out. A beautiful sipping beer."
