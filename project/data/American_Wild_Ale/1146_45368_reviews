"2012 vintage. Not my kind of sour beer!"

"I am not a sour lover so you have see my review like this. Drank it during an epic BCBS tasting to clean the palet."

"Overall: I drank the 2009 first and gave up most hope for the beer. the 2010 was much better. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle of 2009 or if its just past its prime but 2010 is much better."
""
"Pours fizzy murky amber and grapefruit in color. Smell has deep acidic and slight vinegar aroma with notes of berry, hay, and hints of wine an oak. Taste follows nose with a nice tart acidic crisp flavor forward before a ripe berry and sour vinigar flavor. Oak and wine finish. Mouthfeel is crisp, tart, sticky, moderately carbonated and finishs dry."

"Of a group of four for the bottle share, the consensus was that this beer was better than both Oblivion and Love Child No. 4. That both of those beers were excellent should impress on you just how tasty this brew was."

"2013 765ml. Let this one age for at least a year. One of the best tart/fruit brews I've tasted recently. My favorite out of the Goose Island sister series. I'll be buying a few to sit for awhile."
""
""
""
"Has a lovely, tangy taste and the 8% abv is cleverly hidden by the various other flavors - of oak, wild yeasts, blackberry and rye malt (subtle)."

"2012 edition that's been waiting to be let out. Lots of funk upfront; acidic, piercing. Funky, barnyard, TART - well rounded and really comes together as it warms a little. Good prickly carbonation dances around. As advertised, a great sour/wild that I would recommend to anyone interested in a representation of what the style should be."

"O - While very good, I had to compare this to New Glarus Very Sour Blackberry. It held it's own and was tasty."

"Great bubbly feel almost like a champagne followed sour sweetness of blackberries. Great nose, has all the sour characteristics that you hope for. Appearance is a nice orange amber with very little head retention and super clear. Definitely top 5 for me."

""
""
""
""

"Light bodied with appropriate carbonation. Has a tart fruit aftertaste. A very nice easy beer to drink."

"Juliet pours a amberish color, with no head, and lots of bubbles. There is a strong sour aroma, very yeasty, and very sweet. The taste is very acidic, sour, lots of yeast, and nice subtle blackberry colors. Very bold, strong flavors, good to sip on. Overall a very powerful enjoyable wild ale."

"Overall, a very good beer, but I'm a little confused by the fact that this particular ""sister"" sour is more expensive than Lolita, because it doesn't really stand out. Perhaps it's just a factor of production totals. Certainly one of the better American-made sours that is widely available, calling to mind traditional Belgian styles like kriek and flanders red, but as noted, the unique element--blackberries--simply doesn't come through in a way that would really make this brew truly one-of-a-kind."

"The beer pours a rich, pale purple with an amber flair. It sits in the glass as a rich, rose color with a small head of off-white bubbles that quickly leaves. In body, the beer is a deep, colorful murk with a definite opacity to it. When splashed against the sides of the glass it leaves a receding tide of lacing. On the nose, this thing is richly acidic with tart lemon, rich blackberry, blueberry, and even fresh and antiseptic mint. On a second sniff I receive rich, lightly toasted oak, soft malt vinegar, and smooth caramel malt. As I sniff more and more, I do get a sense of chlorine and pool house air, which isn’t completely off-putting, but is odd. On the tongue, this beer is hugely vinous with rich acidity that blossoms into sweet fruit, very faint salinity, and the briefest kiss of herbal bitters. The finish is rich with oak tannin, sweet fruit, and soft acidity. In flavor, this beer is delicately beautiful. It begins as a rich tide of lime and lemon citrus that erupts into rich berry notes mixing strawberry, blackberry, and blueberry. This is then ballooned outwards by a rich, lightly roasted oak and soft earthy characters. The finish returns to bright citrus that blends the berry and oak into a long and fruit-forward finish. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium with a rich, jam-like mouthfeel that gives a lovely bristle of fruit skin. Carbonation is soft but gives a nice sparkle and snap to the sip that keeps the beer from feeling heavy or syrupy. The mouth is left slightly wet and sticky from saliva. As I drink more and more the beer does become a little syrupy and left the tongue feeling a little heavy. The tannins add a touch of astringency that really helps with balancing out the syrupy sweetness. Overall, this beer is impeccably balanced. The syrupy sweetness does win out as you drink more and more of it, but it is never tiring to sip and the rich, subtle complexity in flavor makes it quite enjoyable. Goose Island must have a hell of cellar, and their blender’s tongue must be really refined because this beer is miles ahead of many of the other American Wild Ales. Haters be damned, Goose Island has still got it, and it is very good."

"D: Extremely refreshing and drinkable. ABV is very well hidden. A light and airy brew that does not disappoint."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall- The first Goose Island beer to wow me and wow did it wow me."
"Overall, a very good sour, though not on the same level as the sours from Russian River. One can taste the fruit in those sours and it adds a balancing sweetness to the sour notes. I prefer those kinds of sours and wish more brewers would strive to emulate them, instead of bombarding us with acidity the way they try to one-up each other with hop profiles in IIPAs. Still, this is a superb wild ale and fans of sour bombs should seek it out."
""
"Overall- I need to find more of this I would recommend this to anyone. I see a lot of reviews of other wild ales that say ""not sour enough"". This will for sure cure that need! This reminds me a lot of supplication, I give the slight edge to Juliet."

"For context, 3.75 on my personal scale is ""better than average"" while 3.5 is ""average for craft"" and 3.0 is ""average for all"". Beeradvocate has added ""outstanding"" next to 4.0 in the past year which for me means a lesser ""very good""."

"Pours a near clear burnt orange with a dark pink tint and minimal fizz. The aroma is crisp musty cidery with an acidic funk. There is a quick sharp front to the beer and a pleasant lingering finish. There is a rich brett and lactic character with a lemony vinegar in the forefront with a musty funk and earthy dried fruits. The finish ends softly carbonated with a smooth tartness and the fruits and wine flavors peeking through."

"Pours a orange-russet color, cloudy and glowing, with a small white head that retains as a fine, bubbly ring. Fruity berries and dry mustiness in the nose. Tart juicy sweetness and woody spice. Quite sour in the mouth, loads of blackberry tartness, dry oaky wood, and lactic notes. Increasing lemon acidity and some funky straw notes. Not necessarily the most complex thing ever, but damn tasty. Medium-light and acidic mouthfeel, finishing tart and dry. Mmmm...enjoyable and a bit more sour than Lolita. The blackberry isn't super prevalent, as the citric acidity tends to dominate."
"Orangy-peach-pink-garnet colored beer under a small tight head. No lace and sparse retention, but very nice unusual color. Aroma is tart purple berries, stinky orange, wine, musky wood, floral, yeast, brett, funk... Taste is a perky surge of sour mouth watering fruit, fermented and tangy. Nice dry, super smooth mouthfeel. Smacky. Very nice..."

"O- I really liked the blackberry notes in this beer, it was just enough sour, yet well balanced. I'd put this up there with Lolita as my favorite of the sister beers."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/11/2010. Pours lightly cloudy red-orange color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart blackberry, raspberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, pepper, musty brett funk, leather, rye, toast, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of tart fruit, fruity/funky brett, malt, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of tart blackberry, raspberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, pepper, musty brett funk, leather, rye, toast, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart blackberry, raspberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, musty funk, rye, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of tart fruits, wine barrel, and big fruity/funky brett presence; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible fruited sour ale with 3 years of age. Big brett presence with great balance of wine barrel and blackberry fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O-Overall, a great sour. The tartness was balanced with the dry, crispness of the wine and wild yeast, even if can be a bit overwhelming in the long run. It's worth a try if you're willing to shell out the money and I'm looking forward to trying their other sours."

"O- A very nice sour that has hints of greatness. The jam-like blackberry flavors are fantastic, but the overwhelming blue sweet tart flavors sometimes get in the way. All in all a very nice sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Appearance is a orangish pink. Light carbonation upon initial pour which dissipates into just a subtle amount of bubbles hiding unless you hold the glass closely up to light. I smell barnyard funk, straight brett. There is a dryness exemplified by the wine barrel on the back end. Tastes juicy, with the blackberry fruit bursting at each sip. The Brett character is apparent definitely keeping the sweetness in check. Carbonation is light on the palate, but I think it's just fine for the style. Overall a nice American wild that showcases great fruit character. I loved this and the Lolita I had a few nights back."

"Excellent sour or wild ale that gives strong Belgian impression and matches many of the better belgian wild and sour ales. Very recommended and glad I purchased a second for cellaring."
""
"B+"
"Overall I thought this was a great beer and a very good example of the style, so far it's the best American Wild Ale I have ever had, it took this style to a whole new level for me and I never thought that loads of tartness could work that well in a beer, it really changed the way that I look at this style. This beer had good drinkability, for as tart and sour as it is, it still goes down smooth and it was dry, clean, crisp, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention and keeping me coming back for more, but I would have a hard time limiting myself to just one glass since I think any more then that and it would just be too acidic for me, but I think it's a great beer to split with one or two other people. What I liked the most about this beer was how well the high level of tartness worked with this beer, it blew my mind. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, I thought the color was great, but unfortunately the head and lacing didn't match that and it ended up looking fairly wine like. I would for sure buy this beer again if I ever saw it, I wouldn't hesitate to grab a few bottles and see how it changes over time and for $12 I think this is a bargain. I highly recommend this to people who are a fan of the style and even to people who are just starting to get familiar with the style, like me. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, I didn't know I could like an American Wile Ale this much but somehow Goose Island managed to show me how good this style can actually be and they are quickly gaining my respect by producing these incredible American Wild Ales and Belgian inspired beers. Escoffier was my favorite American Wild Ale, but now it is Juliet. Great job guys this is now my favorite Goose Island beer and now I really want to try the remaining sisters that I have yet to get a hold of, thanks for the experience."
""
""
""

"O-This is probably my favorite of the Goose Island sisters. I find it complex, very vinous, pleasantly sour and well-matched with food. The flavors aren't very distinct (or I just can't describe them well), but I know that I like this beer quite a lot. It is probably too expensive, but I found myself thinking about buying another bottle after drinking this one on Christmas."

"I'm rating this just above outstanding because: 1. It made me enjoy a beer with an element that I usually don't and: 2. It's balanced, with not too much red wine character and very drinkable. Would definitely drink again. Sometimes less is more, and that's why this beer wins for me."
""
""
"Overall a pretty good wild ale, as mentioned above comparable to Rodenbach or maybe The Dissident. But at about twice the price, probably not worth coming back to."

"08/01/13 large format bottle poured into a snifter for tasting. Minimal head dissipates pretty quickly. Opaque ruby color, no lacing or cling. Dark fruit aromas but super tart. More of a specific, dark berry, flavor, and also very tart, but not too sour. Feels smooth up front, but dry and highly carbonated in the middle/end. Berry/tart aftertaste. Overall, really good beer. Super unique and interesting; really enjoy what Goose Island has done here. Cheers."

"Should another bottle come into my possession I would probably cellar it for at least a year or two to allow for further evolution of flavor, especially in regards to brettanomyces or any wild yeast. As it stands this is a nice enough beer to consume fresh and in my opinion worth a try."

""
"As someone who's still more of an appreciator rather than lover of sours, I quite liked this. Great aroma, great complexity."

"Interesting GI sour. Not the best sour by any means, but its not bad. Wish this has a cleaner, lighter flavour and mouthfeel like the Belgians do. This is a bit heavy-handed, but this is GI after all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another good one from Goose Island. I'd like to see them tone down the lactic character a bit, as it detracted a bit from some of the the other complexities of the beer, but not so much so that it wasn't still enjoyable. Worth picking up if you find it reasonably priced."

"Easy feel. Plenty of carbonation, but nothing astringent. Crisp and refreshing. The flavor profile on this one keeps me gulping. Tart blackberry, lemon, lactic character, oaky dryness. Fruity finish from the barreling for sure. This beer disappeared quickly. Loved it. Thanks again, Ed!"

"Pours a lightly hazy deep golden color with a huge fluffy bone white head that that dissipates as quickly as the bubbles in a glass of ginger ale. Tart and funky fruit dominate the aroma here. Lemons, cherries, and berries with lots of lactic sourness and funk make up most of the nose with hints of brown sugar deep in the background. The flavor puckers your face up front with lemons and tart cherries. Light brown sugar malt sneaks in before the citric return and burns a hole deep into your nether region. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick tart puckering mouthfeel. Nice American wild, I'm glad I got to try it."

"Tart and delightful. Good balance of fruit and tart magic."
"This is wet, funky, and tart. It's very interesting, with some nice berry notes. If this were easier to get, I would buy it again. This bottle is from 2012, and I would imagine it gets more complex or something."

"Last one from an awesome box from deyholla. Pours a beautiful deep ruby orange with tiny fizzy head that recedes quickly. Smell is sour vinegar and very sweet fruit and berries. Flavor is sour up front with a smooth berry finish. The berry is not too sweet and has just the right balance with the sour and barrel notes. Prickly carbonation and light-medium mouthfeel. Awesome sour, probably my favorite of the GI ladies."
""
""
"O- Initially graded this a little harshly, but then changed my mind that I should keep the Belgians out of my mind when rating an American sour. Hard to do, but the style says so, so for an American Wild, this is great. It is easily my favorite out of the 3 sisters, though all are fair examples of American interpretations of sour beer. For someone new to this beer, I'd definitely recommend one fresh and one for cellar if possible as some time may dry this out."

"2012 vintage. i should be fair to this beer and admit that i enjoyed it in the same session as several new glarus sours, a consecration, and yes, a cantillon saint lamvinus, so some features that came across as lackluster or negative might actually not be so in another light, but i had one bottle and its been consumed, so here we go. pours a unique mix of orangey rust and rose pink, they kind of wash eachother out in a hazy melted crayon look. a finger or two of off white foam dies right away. the nose is quite sour and fruity, cherries maybe, lots of vinegar and lemon. it smells as bretty as it does like a kitchen cleaner for hippies, but im being critical. the taste is quite good, again with the fruit, maybe wild raspberry or something in there providing that tartness along with what must be a heavy dose of lemon peel and some sour yeast, which is quite intense towards the finish. lots of acid, and lots of residual sugar, not a combo i usually like at the tail end of a beer, but they seem to neutralize eachother reasonably well here. really poppy mouthfeel, gnarly carbonation over just a medium body. long drawn out aftertaste of lemony yeasty funk. i also taste some tonic water in here, especially in the aftertaste, which i cant explain but i dont care for at all. this one starts better than it ends."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the complexity through the sourness. We were very excited when we first sipped this beer, as the tart Brett really takes off robustly from the start. The entire time you’re trying to pick apart all of the flavors that make it so puckering, but keep it so drinkable and juicy. We do wish that the blackberry was more present in its sweetness, alongside its sourness. Either way, this beer had an excellent flavor, and was insanely drinkable."
""
""
""

""

"Overall - Solid. Better than Lolita by a fair margin. Muted fruit notes yield a nice sour beer behind it."
""
""
"O: Overall, quite a good brew here. It has the big sour notes I look for in a wild, and a nice bit of funk and oak barrel characters as well. I would have liked the raspberries to be a little more prominent, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Not mind blowing but Id drink again in heartbeat. I recommend."

"Juliet is a really nice release from Goose Island. I’ve wanted to try it for a while. Expectations were high. For the most part, they were met. I could handle maybe just a little less tartness and a few more bubbles. Those two tweaks would improve it in my book. Still a very impressive beer nevertheless."

Nice balance of tart and sweet. I would definitely enjoy revisiting this. Definitely exceeded my expectations."

"O - Overall this really has an average appearance as well as aroma, but the taste really grew on me. Quite tart."
"Was really hoping for a wild that showcases the berries, but this beer just shows up with sour, tart, & more sour. No rye, berries scarcely noticeable - blah. Still tasty, just not what was advertised. Pretty good beer."

"I could drink this for a while without getting board, a fair bit going on and I like everything that’s happening, worth seeking out"
""
"D - A tasty and ultimately drinkable offering from GI. All the care and consideration put into brewing beers like this really comes through with beers like Juliet. There was some talk a while back about GI coming to Canada, and while I doubt offerings like Juliet will see their way North of the border, I'd welcome more from them after this brew, that's for sure."

"I have been consistently blown away by Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout variants, and now I know that they can make an amazing version of a wild ale as well. This beer ranks up there with some of the best sour ales I have ever tried. Truly a superb offering."
""
"O- great wild ale from GI. 7/10 sourness, gives a nice pucker from the sourness but has enough raspberry to balance this beer and make it very enjoyable."
"22 ounce bottle, it's a 2012 bottle but there's no bottling date printed on the label. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours an orange/red color with a half inch head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is nice and sour, it smells like tart berries, oak, and red wine. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, except that the berry flavor tastes more like sweet and tart blackberries, and that the sourness is stronger in comparison to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this beer, it's tasty and tart so I can't complain about that! $15.99 a bottle."

"O: The black berries and red wine barrel really play off each other nicely. The lacto sourness cuts the sweetness of the berries and the malt body brings it all together. A very solid sour overall and definitely a beer that I would like to have again."
""
"O - Good flavor and goes for that super sour beer thing. I do like the not so subtleness, but can only handle so much."
""
""
"Poured in a tulip glass. Pours reddish copper with zero head. Aromatic notes of wood, tannin, dark fruit and spice make Juliet an ideal beer to suggest to Pinot Noir enthusiasts and beer drinkers who are fond of Belgian sour ales. Flavors of tart fruit; definitely a complex ale. While an interesting and complex brew, this did not cut it for me as I am not a big fan of sours myself."

"pour is a dark transparent ruby red with a beige tiny bubbled head. Nose is heavy tart berry, fair amount of dry wood, hints of lacto and vanilla, light Brett leather note. Taste is heavy sour dark berry, lightly lactic. Wood isnt there near as much as the nose. Body is lightly dry, a hint syrupy, rather puckering and highly carbonated. Not bad, pretty sour, strong berry note, not too much else."
""
"Overall: This beer took me by surprise and was pretty kick ass."
"Overall: A really good take on a sour. A good combination of tart and sweet fruits. Bold but not overbearing with the sourness and acid."
"A very tasty fruit sour. I'm most impressed by the balance between the berry fruitiness and the tart sour. Another impressive beer from Goose Island."
"Overall: amazing balance, brett mainly in the nose, don't get much blackberries, but the wine barrel really came through. One of the best American wild ales I've ever had."
""

""
""
"I got a 750mL bottle of the 2012 in Spring 2012. Pours a copper orange that is hazy and has a slight but quickly disappearing head. Scent is strong of aged blackberries. The taste is mostly of fermented blackberries that are fruity, delicious, and has a good drinking texture. Mixed with some wine but I'm not sure what kind of wine. Has a dry finish. A delicious beer that doesn't really taste like a beer."
""

""
"O - This is a really good wild ale. Love the sourness and funkiness."
""
""
"O- A good sour beer."
"O. Very unique and excellent beer. Not much different than Lolita for me. Lots of flavor nuances going on. Great beer to give someone who is a wine drinker and is new to craft beer."
"Overall, a very good sour from GI, but nothing compared to the Cantillon Iris I had right before."
""
""
""
"O - Evaluating this beer is tough. I don't know if it should be more of a sour summer/refreshing beer with light brett characters and lighter acidity or bigger and more complex overall. However, There are things I greatly enjoyed: the subtlety of a brett smell, the curveball of huge acidity, the unique color."
""
"O: Very nice (but pricey!! - $20 in chicago). I am glad I got to try it. In my personal opinion (which doesn't mean much since I am relatively new to sours) this beer tastes more like a flanders red than anything else."

"O - Great sour and tartness with a sweet cherry body."
""

""
""
"I really enjoy this beer, it might help that I love black berries, and they shine nicely in the mix. Good complexity in every sip."
"American Wild Ales have a pretty high ceiling, in general. Juliet hovers amongst other great examples in the top tier of sour craft beers. An elegant offering from a prestigious brewery. One o'their best sister beers. 4.5"
"O-A great Sour. Better than Lolita, looking forward to Madame Rose. Would be great to try those three blind."

"O: The only other sour I've had apart from La Folie - and it ain't La Folie. This is best split amongst multiple people, because a little REALLY goes a long way. Despite that, it's still a wholly solid and unique wild ale that any sour lover(s) would enjoy."
""
"A totally awesome beer from Goose Island. This impressed me as much as any of the Russian River sour beers."
"O: Drinkability is so-so since its so damn tart and funky. Split this two or three ways and it's good. Well made for sure and worth a try."
""
"Overall a delicious sour that is certainly worth a try. Glad I got two bottles, just wish I aged one :-)"
""
""
"O - This beer really reminds me of Cantillon Kriek. Just strong mouth puckering sour fruit. Only it has light notes of berries, oak, malt and rye in there making it much more interesting. Certainly one of the better executed American wild ales I have tried. Well played Goose Island, well played!"
""
""
"O: This is a great sour. I love blackberries, and while I expected a stronger blackberry presence, I am actual happy that this beer is what it is. The flavors are well-balanced without a single dominant note (other than the funk). I love this, and I want more."
""
""
"Pours a reddish brown, almost plum color with a nice fizzy white cap on it that dissolves quickly like soda bubbles into the air. Smell is of sour berries, a bit of lacto, faint leather and horse blanket. Tart, puckering blast of sour berries (Cherries, blackberries) immediately following a sip, smoothing out into a brett middle with a nice wine-like finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with a good level of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden very well. Overall a very solid wild ale from Goose Island. Would buy again for certain."
""
""
"O - Nicely complex wild ale. Wine barrels are not my favorite for aging but they do a nice job with Juliet. Not my favorite sour but well worth trying out if you get a chance. Well crafted."
""
"Clean and a mostly light mouthfeel in the texture. Overall, an excellent beer that I would readily recommend."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. The $16 price tag is a little steep, but this beer really delivers for me. Nice, firm sourness with a touch of funk and fruit makes it a awesome beer to have on this 90 degree day."

"M: Light bodied. Very easy drinking. Alcohol amazing hidden. Don't taste it at all."

"overall, very delicious. never boring. 8% makes it a bit slower of a sipper but really easy to drink away on. great flavor, cannot see it improving."
""
"Pours a brown color with a ruby twinge and a slightly off white one finger head which recedes to skim and leaves little lacing. There is sticky carbonation bubbles on the side of the glass and the inside appears very carbonated. The aroma is wine like with blackberry and cherry notes very present along with a hint of white grape. The taste follows suit with a sour cherry flavor up front before a white grape wine taste takes over. The back end is all blackberries, well blended and a very good taste. The flavor leaves you wanting more. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and a bit stingy, almost like a champagne. Overall a very good beer, great aroma and flavor, I will seek this out again for sure."

"O- Goose Island did a great job with this beer and it is extremely easy to drink, 8% ABV is not noticeable at all. I wish I had more, such a treat."
""
"O: Though it’s a good mix of solid flavors, this beer is not without its weaknesses (mainly the huge presence of lactic acid). Still, it would go wonderfully with a variety of entrees, or cheeses, for that matter. Makes me even more excited for Madame Rose…"
"O: A really nice wild ale that has nice balance between the berries and sourness. A great treat and wish my second bottle had not spontaneously exploded so I could enjoy it again without searching."
""
"O: excellent, wish I hadn't drank my 2010 now, but I'll know that my 2012s are good for a while."
"O: Pretty new to the sours, and this one is by far the best tasting sour I’ve had to date. Definitely would like to see how some of the more renown sours such as those brewed by RR stand-up to this because I thoroughly enjoy this brew. Price is very steep, but I have no regrets trying this one out, very pleased."

"I think I prefer this one to the Lolita. A bit more balance and drinkability. Really a delicious beer I think."
"A bottle from the 2012 release, poured into a small chalice. This is very well carbonated and a faded ruby color, close to a dark orange or pink. Smell is very sour with lots of funky acidic berries and grapes. Taste is very sour, with a citric flavor similar to a lemonhead. Lots of barnyard funkiness and berry lemonade flavors. Alcohol isn't noticeable at all, keeping this very drinkable."
"All that's lacking is the intensity of complementary flavors to accompany the fruit in the same way that Belgian lambics do. In the end, the beer has a more simplified palate as does some like Cantillon and 3 Fontienen."
"Overall this is a very good good wild ale, and (imho) a touch better then her sister Lolita. The blackberries lend a deeper, less tart, flavor that lets the brett and wine barrels come through a bit more. Super drinkable for 8%. I'm intrigued to how these brews do with a year or two on them. Highly recommended if you can get it. Cheers!"

"O: This is really tasty. I wish the rye and blackberries came through a little more though."
"Figured I'd celebrate my birthday with some bottle, might as well be a shelf sour (check my local's shelf...it's definitely there...). It pours a mostly clear sunrise auburn topped by a half-finger at best of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet berries, light tart cherry, very light and very mild Brett funk, and a kiss of vanilla. The taste eschews the eminent sweetness of the smell in favor of a few waves of varying degrees of sour: tart berries, sour cherries, tart red wine, a small bit of straight Brett funk, and a bit of white vinegar for the sake of it. Nothing is exceedingly powerful, though, allowing everything to meld together without o'erwhelming the taste buds or peeling the enamel off of the teeth. This is what sour beer brewers should be aiming for, dammit! The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, a very nice bit o' sour goodness, one of the premier beers I've yet had from Goose as a whole. Happy birthday to me!"
"By far my favorite Goose Island sour and one of the better ones out there overall. The brett is well done and complements the main flavors instead of overwhelming them as some do. Again more tart than sour, but a winner in my book."

"I quite liked this. Not incredible, but very pleasant and drinkable."

""

"A solid sour, for sure, but the price point makes it something I won't buy again."
""
"O- A really awesome wild ale, easily my favorite of the GI sisters, definitely give this a try, I would buy a ton of this if it wasn't so damn expensive!"
"O: The biggest flaw a brewery can make when making a sour beer, in my personal opinion, is to make it with too much alcohol. There's a reason why Belgian masters stay at 6% or lower. Any higher and the alcohol will be too noticable. The balance will break. As it has here. It's not horrible. It's just not great. Also, I was told there were blackberries here ... not a hint."
"O: It's well-balanced, other than the overwhelming oakiness, and has ""interesting meta-flavors," but lacks subtlety and complexity."
""
"In recent months I've been trying to open up my palate more to sours. This seems like a good ""entry"" type into the sour world. I've had a few of the RR sours and I'm confident in saying Juliet stands it's ground strongly in comparison to them."

"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue. We opened all 3 sisters at the same time and this one was easily my favorite."
"Drink- The 3rd of the 3 sisters has again lived up to the hype. A great american wild ale with wonderful use of a often forgotten fruit in the blackberries. Great beer. Need another one."
""
"O: Fantastic. I would say that this beer is better than Lolita. The blackberry flavor really lends itself to the tartness. 4.5/5"
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a tan head that settles to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of sour blackberries, slight vinegar, and some funky aromas. Taste is very much the same with a slightly woody taste that is present as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good wild ale with some very nice sour blackberry aromas and flavors."
"O: Best colder. I still liked a lot and will get again."
""
"Overall: A good sour. The black berries are very prevalent. Fairly complex. Drinkability is good."

"O- Another outstanding wild ale from Goose, a little less dry and leathery than Lolita, this brew finds my highest favor amongst the sisters thus far."
""
""
""
""
"Over carbonated at first and just sort of explodes in your mouth, scrubing bubbles style. After time the bubbles calm down. Perhaps age was not kind to this ale, I remember it being much better fresh."
"O= Is this the beer it has been hyped to be? Not in my opinion. I wish I could but it regularly and I enjoy the hell out of it but there are better sours around. If GI decided to distribute this here however I would buy a ton of it and love it like a small child. A tasty beer indeed."

"2010. Pours a ""berry-red"" color. Very hazy amber-red with small, white head with the slightest bit of pink to it. Scent is immediately strong blackberry aroma with boysenberry and raspberry. Some strawberry, oak, and vanilla. Tart aroma...not very funky. Taste is a berry explosion in my mouth. Tart strawberry, blackberry, and blueberry flavors. Red wine vinegar, oak, and vanilla. Finishes oaky and sour. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with wine-like characteristics. Slightly puckering finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very tasty beer. I had no idea it would still be this ""berry-forward"" after a year and a half of aging. I would recommend this to people wanting to move from sweeter fruit beers to sours. Very tasty and great for those who love berries."

"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. Of the Three Sisters, this one is probably the best one since the fruit makes up a bigger component of the taste. Lolita is a close second, and then Madame Rose rounding out the trio. She must be the grenade."
"O: The drinkability on this is really high. This was the best of the 3 IMO. Most balanced, best taste, best smell."

"O-I would love to have this beer again. I wish it saw more distribution because bar prices on this are ridiculous but I had to try it."
"Bottle courtesy of GRM: Poured a cloudy reddish color ale with a nice foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of sour cherries and raspberries with sour notes, light oak and barnyard. Taste is a nice mix between some lacto, sour cherry and sour notes with light vinous feel and a strong barnyard finish. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation. Very well brewed with nice level of complexity while retaining good drinkability qualities."
"O - A very nice sour, and my favorite of the three sisters. The big fruit presence combined with the tartness and funk put this ahead of Lolita and Madame Rose for me."
"D_I am enjoying this quite a bit. The berries are not that evident but I think that is a good thing. There is a background fruitiness that does this beer well."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer overall but there are better sour beers out there."
" M .very drinkable"
"Pours a reddish orange. No head. Nice and clear. Smells tart and sour. Nice fruitiness on the nose. Tastes sharp and tart. Vry acidic and sour. There is a lot of fruit on the tongue. Blackiberries apparently but i would never have guessed. Highly carbonated and sharp. Overall very enjoyable but too acidic for me"
"Overall not the best from Goose Island esp. for the money this one costs."
"If you get a chance to try this beer, do so. Very, very nice. I loved it."
"Overall: This is my favorite of the three sisters, but I was not entirely blown away by this fresh bottle. With the amount of Brett that was noticeable, I think this could really mature over time."
"Wow this beer was better than I was expecting it to be. The beer pours a light red color with little head and low carbonation. The smell is berry and cherry with a good bit of acetic sourness. The flavor is surprisingly tart and the fruitiness from the smell comes through well along with a good bit of funk. The mouthfeel is slightly Puckering and dry with low carbonation. A very well crafted beer"
"Overall good, this is the best GI sour and I'm going back to the store for more!"
"It feels good in the mouth, though comparing it to something like cantillon it's not perfect. Could be a little lighter in that respect."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is very high. Overall it was a pretty good beer, but not one of the best of the style. It felt lacking depth at times and a little acidic as well. I enjoyed it, but the Cisco sour I had earlier was much better."
"o - Overall a really great wild ale. I think I liked this one better than Lolita; really looking forward to Madame Rose. Lots of funky brett and sour raspberries; would highly recommend and would like to have again."
"D-A very delightful beer that I wish I could indulge in a little more frequently; unfortunately price and scarcity make this tough to do."
"Cheers!"
"O - This is a very drinkable beer. I could easily keep drinking glasses of this tasty brew. Overall, I thought it was a very nice sour. I just wish the berry flavor wasn't masked so much by the brett. Other than that, I thought it was great. I would buy it again."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, funk, fruit, and vinegar. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, funk, fruit, blackberries, and subtle vinegar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. When I first smelled the vinegar aspect on this one I was concerned that it would overwhelm the beer and make it not so enjoyable. However, there was a just a subtle note of it in the flavor which allowed the blackberries to come through quite nicely. A really nicely put together brew for sure. Glad I got the chance to try this one and that I have one or two in my personal cellar for a later date."
"2/21/2011"
"Pours a cloudy brownish red, with an transient offwhite that falls to a think collar. Nose gives off sour notes immediately, cherry, raspberry and some less noticeable blackberry. Wild notes and lots of funk, oak and some sweetness as well. Taste echoes the nose, piercing sour cherries and raspberry throughout. Some tannins, puckering and juicy feel. Some vanilla and general barrel character as well. High carbonation, and an impressive sour."
"Deep pinkish amber colour, light pink head, some lacing sticks to the glass. Smell is of sour fruit, cherry, blackberry, subtle vanilla, wild yeast and barnyard notes are there as well, light oaky impressions are present as well. Taste is tart with sour fruit, berries take over the palate for a while, cherry is present, nice dry tartness in middle and finish very flavourful with lots going on here. Med-high carbonation, dry and slightly syrupy at points in the mouth. Great wild ale, one of the better ones I have tried, could have easily knocked off this bottle on my own but glad I shared this with friends."
"Narrative: Juliet knew she had something special to her. At first it was just idle whispers when she was younger. As she came of age, she learned to hone in on the narratives and focus in on the voices in her head. She had learned to learn a lot of things from the flowers, especially in the month of June. It was an ethereal talent that really did not give her any special insight to the world, but it was a power her own. “JULEZ? Are you still sitting out in the boysenberry patch?” Her conversation was interrupted abruptly and she had to put the rhododendron on hold. “Yeah mom, hang on.” The flowers really just complained and imparted sour notes into her life, but, somehow being so in sync with the idle problems of the flora made he feel whole. Juliet was a sweet minx, but sour through and through."
"My birthday treat from Peensteen, and it did not disapoint. Great pink foamy look, great aromas of berries, cherry, raspberry. Large retained head. Well malted, and bretted sour that enticed the palate. Tart, berry, great drinkability.Lovely sour.Cellaring for a few months likely rounded sour edges."
"Overall I really enjoyed this.  It has a really nice fruit concentrate like sourness.  I think most wine lovers might appreciate this."
"Overall this was very well done, one of the most complex American sours I have ever tasted. I enjoyed this a lot, though it is a bit of a sipper. So far over anything I have tasted from Weyerbacher, Jackie O's, Russian River, Odell, etc, this is the American Wild I would be most happy to be able to buy a second time."
"D - It is good, and yes this fits the bill as an introductory offering into the world of sours. The sour character is definitely present but it appears that GI wanted to exhibit the wine and fruit characters with equal importance, so it makes for decent balance across the drink. I'm glad I got to try it."
"Overall impression - really enjoyable. The blackberries add a nice touch. Very well-done. I'd like to give it another go sometime."
"Overall this is an very good sour beer. It's fairly dry and sour but not the sourest beer I've ever had. I think the berries and rye really add to this beer making it extremely drinkable. I don't think this is the be all and end of of sour beers but another strong offering from Goose Island."
"Overall: A splendid sour. The fruit and wine barrels have worked wonders on this beer, but the brett and rye beer base are still present and pleasing. If you can find this, buy it!"
"O: a deliciously fruity craft beer that's easy to drink, and an overall well-balanced sour. A great introduction to the diversity of American craft brewing for your ladyfriends."
"O: The beer isn’t too difficult to drink because although the sourness is strong, it is not overpowering."
"dark ruby red color with very weak white head that almost immediately disappears. decent amount of carbonation visible. slight ""wild"" notes in the smell along with prominent fruit notes. taste is sour with sweetness from the fruit. slightly funky, at least more in the taste than in the smell. lively mouthfeel, however I do not like how before the glass is done the beer eventually goes pretty still. No head and almost no carbonation, despite the fact it started out adequately carbonated. Overall, it's a solid wild ale with a somewhat favorable price compared to others (like RR, Lost abbey, etc.), but not positive if I'd get again. I'd favor Madame Rose or perhaps a Cantillon offering if I'm looking at price/volume."
"O - Good brew from GI. I think I enjoy the MAdame Rose more but this is still a very well crafted beer. Good tartness that is intense but maybe not too overwhelming. (4.0)"
"O - I love this beer; it is as nice tasting as I can ever recall a fruit-forward sour being. Seriously, on a Cantillon level."
"Damn good stuff. I want a bottle all to myself now."
"(22oz bottle courtesy of cosmicevan!). Pours hazy cranberry juice color with no real head and light carbonation. Aroma of cheap wine, ripe fruit and wood. Taste is both tart and sweet. This beer has more funk than the other sisters. Medium bodied with a dry finish. The wine is very prominent in this beer and the tannins are quite noticeable. Good, but I prefer the other sisters."
"Well done by Goose Island for the style. I will not be seeking out more but was happy to have tried it."
"Whoah! I LOVE this beer. I had it fresh from the second 2009 batch and it was great. Then had it again after like 6 months and it was horrible and a big gusher. This 2010 batch is a HUGE improvement. Way uglier than the 2009, and also no big head. Great beer that should go back on my wants."
"O very very good i like it enough to get it again"
"Edit: After sipping on this for a while, the acidity level is getting to me. A little too much like a Flanders Sour Red for my liking."
"D- Very tasty, i really appreciated the vanilla notes to calm the sour, it made this wild ale really accessible for me."
"D: This may be a little be too sour and even acidic for some palates, but it is an interesting take on a wild ale."
"Highly drinkable. This would be better in the summer time as a great thirst-quencher."
"Deep ruby/brown pour with just a faint white ring of a head. Very good lacing as I swirl it around my tulip glass. Aroma is very vinous: lots of red wine and grapes. Strong fruity/funky presence in the nose as well. The aroma is definitely the strong point of this beer. Flavor follows the nose. Tart cherries, grapes, leather, some vanilla, and slight vinegar. Very sweet fruity sour. Well carbonated, sour throughout, and finishes (for the most part) dry. I find the finish to be almost stuck in the middle of being sweet and dry. Maybe due to the fact that this is still a young bottle and the brett hasn't had a chance to dry this one out. Very drinkable, enjoyable wild ale without being overly sour."
"Overall, the appearance was the worst part, the way the beer settled so fast had me worried but this one is solid. I liked the twist that the blackberries added and I found this to be a very drinkable beer. Not overwhelming on the sour notes and very well balanced overall"
"This is really a nicely blended brew. Its a nicely done sour from GI and I'm glad I stumbled upon this one. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to try this one and I'm glad I didn't end up trading it away as I was originally intending to do."
"I got this in a trade from enelson, 2009. Because of its rep for being a gusher I popped the top when it was cold, no problems. It pours a pretty pink with a very big fizzy white head, that settles nicely. The aroma is a mix of sweet and sour cherries. The first sip is very vinous, lots of sweet and sour cherries, light funk. It has a sweet lingering finish that is balanced by some tartness. The beer is light and effervescent, highly carbonated. I really, really liked this. I definitely will be getting more of this."
"Notes- It seems the '09s tend to be gushers, the '10, at least at this point, thankfully is not."
"D: I will finish this bottle easily, but I would not recommend picking up the 2009 if you see it. It is too much of a bubbly mess without the reward."
"Split this with 3 friends but easily could have drank the whole bomber myself."
"D - The acidity gets to be a lot towards the end of the bomber, especially the dregs, so I wouldn't reach for another bottle. But, this is refreshing, sour, tart, funky and deliciously fruity."
"Belgian Sour again aged in cabernet (oak) barrels but this time with blackberries. This was the best of the bunch (along with Lolita & Madame Rose) in my opinion. The full mouth feel and balanced sweet & sourness made the other two seem a bit one dimensional. Big jammy, wine-like, I picked up on hints of blueberries. I would love to pair this with a nice piece of grilled lamb and some feta-heavy rocket salad."
"3.5 D: It's an okay brew if there's nothing better around, but a bomber of this is a rather boring experience. The aromas and flavors are okay, just too weak to make this a truly enjoyable experience. The overcarbonation and the price didn't add anything positive either."
"Drinkability: There's freely wild funkiness, there's fruit, and plenty of bubbles. Interesting and enjoyable for a bottle's worth."
"Wow was really blown away by this beer. This has the qualities of both a great beer and a great wine. The cabernet barrel ageing really lends a nice dimension to this beer, particularly the vanilla and leather notes it adds. Not sure how much better this will get with age as it is already on top of its game and I would be afraid that it would loose its pure expression of blackberry."
"Drinkability: The overcarbonation is a real distraction from this otherwise nicely balanced wild ale; while not the sour bomb that some may be seeking, I rather enjoyed it"
"D- This is a very good wild ale overall. The highlight is the tartness-but overall its mild to moderate with a clean finish. This was a good sour to start the family off with as its not really offensive."
"MF/D: hard to get past the blast of carbonation. i'm sure it diminished the flavors somewhat, and the constant bubbling in the mouth felt like poprocks..."
"The taste of this brew is very carbonated. Continuous swirls attempt to release the carbonation and tame this brew down a little. It takes some effort to make it drinkable but it is worth it. A flavor of brett runs rampid through this brew with a taste of wet leather and minor puckering quality. Quite drying finish with earthy notes that are almost grassy and cheese like that hang inside the mouth. This is a light bodied brew that is excessively carbonated. Overall though it was quite enjoyable."
"Sour fanatics will probably love Juliet. In my view, this is a damn good wild ale that could have been a great wild ale if it toned down the wild yeast just a little and emphasized its other 'ingredients' (rye malt, blackberries and Cabernet-soaked oak) just a little more."
"Drinks: forgettably. Juliet's nice and drinkable, but as wild ales go, she's run-of-the-mill. Too little sourness and not enough supporting flavors."
"2009 vintage bottled on August 14th. Open this over a sink because it is a gusher - a good 1/4 of the bottle ended up on the coffee table. Poured a hazy pinkish-plum with a loose, half-inch, pinkish head. Nose is slightly tart and acidic and reveals blackberries, currants and grapefruit notes. Taste follows nose; however, it's not as tart as suggested by the nose. Flavor profile also reveals some rye and buttery notes. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency with a lively effervescence and a semi-dry finish. This is a really easy drinking American Wild - not too tart, but really quite refreshing. A top notch brew from GI and definitely a personal favorite from this brewery."
"Mouthfeel is super carbonated! Light body, semi-easy drinker. Reminds me of an unblended lambic, with a ton of carbonation believe it or not! Flavor is full of mild, yet nice tartness. Funkiness isn't strong in the flavor. A lot of fruits in the backbone. A tasty sour! Great beer from Goose Island!"
"D - Probably one of the better sours I've had. Really easy drinker...could stand to have a bit less carbonation, but other than that, this one is a winner."
"An all around solid beer. I'm a little pissed about the gushing issue, but aside from that I really can't find any faults. Just make sure to open it over a sink."
"Note to Goose Island - distribute this to Wisconsin. Please."
"D - This beer is still pretty good despite the horrific disaster upon opening the bottle. From what I've heard there is a new batch out now. This'll definitely be something to pick up on my next trip to Illinois. Right now though, I've got enough Vitamin B to last me for the next week. Open over a pitcher and filter with a cheese cloth."
"Beer is thin and moderately acidic. The sourness comes through but its more subtle than the aroma would lead you to believe. Body builds on you and there is some growing tartness in the back. Overall its a good example of a brett beer."
"D: A really great beer. Highly recommended."
"Price = ?"
"Conclusion: Popped this open to celebrate sending off my MA thesis to my committee tonight. Was it the life-changer I thought it might be? No. But then again, beers you've looked forward to for a long time rarely are. What it was was a seriously good American Wild Ale. The brett was just right (in my opinion) at just about a year old, the fruit was natural and juicy-tart, and the sourness was at a perfect level. I won't go to the ends of the earth to get another one, but if I ever saw it on my travels I'd definitely pick one up. Goose Island is really and truly going places."
"D: A pretty easy to drink wild ale. Not overly sour, but good fruit character and a nice bit of oak to it. Glad to have another bottle."
"D: Goes down very easy, nice kick, nice balance. I highly enjoyed this beer and would love to have it again!"
"Drinkability: it's a good beer but is a little too sour for my liking, it's worth a try but beware of the exploding batch from 2009"
"Very excellently done, Goose Island!"
"Consumed: 6/5/2010"
"The mouthfeel is way too f*cking carbonated. It's difficult to sip. The carbonation level of this pretty much kills the drinkability. I struggled getting through the last bottle, and I'm struggling to get through this one."
"A nice example of the style. I was just hoping the beer would be more complex. Not worth the $15 I paid for the bottle."
"Drinkability - As with all AWA's, in my opinion, you can't really session them. This beer was quite drinkable in the fact it was not as mouth puckering as other AWA's or sours. Overall an enjoyable beer to be sipped on the 51st floor of a downtown Chicago condo looking out over lake Michigan and Navy Pier. Glad I have one more in my Midwest cellar, and that I know of a place that will most likely have quite a few of these on their shelves for years to come."
"2009 vintage. The beer pours an orange-pink color with a large white head that has a pink tint. The aroma is pretty tart with some blackberry and oak. The flavor is not near as tart as the aroma led me to believe it would be. I get some oak with a hint of blackberries as well as some lemon tartness. The fruit comes out more as the beer warms up. Fizzy carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. The beer is very prickly on the tongue. The beer reminded me a little bit of LeBleu, but that may just be the mouthfeel and carbonation. I wish the carbonation was toned down a bit."
"Overall, I was really excited to try this and it didn not dissappoint. Very good overall."
"Drinkability is OK. The smell is fantastic, but taste doesn't really live up. Maybe I caught it in transition, where the fruit has dropped out a bit but the brett hasn't cleaned things up enough....I wanted to drink it as soon as I caught it to catch some of the fruit, but probably should have waited...que sara sara, I'm still happy to have tried it!"
"D - This beer comes in at a bit above 6% so it can be a very drinkable beer. My one concern would be the sourness becoming a bit overwhelming after 2-3 glasses of this. A very good american Wild/Sour ale indeed>!"
"Overall a great sour beer from Goose Island, though a bit pricey."
"D: The alcohol is moderate and never gets in the way. The acidic funk gets a little filling at times, but that is a minor issue. It can be both delicate and forceful."
"This is an interesting, funky beer that is quite enjoyable. The oak can be a bit much at times and despite the complexity, it isn't as well balanced as I would like. This is a very solid offering though, but I definitely prefer Sofie to this beer. The funkiness of the nose is much appreciated by this lover of funky beers though."
"D= If you like your fruit beers to not kill you with sweetness you will like this. If you like your sour beers to not pucker you with sourness you will like this. Its balanced and delicious."
"Overall-- I have had lots of sours, including many from Russian River-- I would put this beer up against any of them! It's good to see that Goose cam represent the Wilds so well and that Cali isn't the only place find a beer like this..."
"Incredible beer from Goose Island. One of my favorite new beers over the last 1.5 years or so...hope none of the other bottles I have are over-carbed like so many say..."
"Very different and very tasty - definitely something I would drink again."
"A beautiful pairing with the beef and chanterelle pot pies as sort of a digestif."
"D: Pretty underwhelmed by Juliet. It's a nice first (?) attempt, but it doesn't measure up to anything coming out of Russian River or Lost Abbey at the moment. It was nice to try, but in the spectrum of wild ales this is decidely bottom-tier."
"I had to track down a second bottle the following week, and was shocked to find it was only $13 dollars. In a world of $35 Cantillon and $25 Russian River, this is a shining star that will be seeing some serious time in my cellar."
"d- not very difficult to drink since there isnt much to it, a very mellow and toned down sour for sure. i might have to come back and try this a few months (or years) down the road to see if it has gotten any better with some age on it."
"D - this beer is made to be drinkable. It's good, and goes down so easy. Drinkable is this beer, but not much else!"
"Juliet is tasty. It just isn't as complex as I thought it was going to be. It is a very nice beer that also happens to be a disappointment in many ways."
"D - Very glad I tried this, but wouldn't seek out again."
"d: I've given up trying to get Jes to share my passion for beer. It just isn't her thing. At least she has good taste on the rare days she is in the mood for a beer. She tends to favor saisons, tripels, and wheat beer. I have to say though, that I'm alarmed and dismayed at the enthusiasm she showed for this and for Consecration recently. I love my wife for being low maintenance, at least I thought she was. Thanks to OHLRangers for helping her affirm her love of beer aged in wine barrels with fruit. Thanks goodness they are so inexpensive and plentiful. Seriously though, thanks for this Ed, we both loved it."
"D- Wonderfully drinkable. The initial carbonation is intense on the palate, but only hurts the mouth-feel, not the final drinkability. Great beer, that I have waited too long to try. Worth the wait, but where is the rye??"
"D: Very drinkable. At 6.7%, this sour goes down really easily. Next time I am in Chicago I will be picking up more than one bottle."
"Thanks Greg!"
"D - an interesting one, especially on the eyes and nose. threading that fine line between sour, tart, and funk...going more in one direction might give this beer a better identity. maybe this is slightly past its prime. 22oz is perfect to split."
"Overall, not a mind-blowing American Wild Ale but one of the best looking ones I've ever seen. A decent intro to the style and worth a shot on the whole though."
"My 600th review and doing it in style. Been wanting to get a bottle of this for quite some time and found this bottle while on a recent trip to Chicago. Pours a dark orange/pink color with an enormous light pink head that fell slowly, but the bubbles were so big that it left virtually no lacing. It couldn't have looked much better on the initial pour. Big berry and tart lemon notes on the nose, light on the barnyard funk, but it's there buried beneath the fruit and the subtle oakiness. Upon first sip, this beer has a wonderful sourness, tart and lemony, mild red wine flavors, then slowly turns dry with a light rasberry-like tartness. The funk and tartness mingles well with the light fruit and is easily quaffable. The only complaint I have with this beer is that nothing really stands out with it. It's very light and very accessible for someone new to the style, but I'm liking it a lot, nonetheless. Carbonation is a little stingy at first, but a few swirls really calms it down and brings out some more fruity aromas. This is a fantastic brew, and I wish I would have picked up two bottles of this instead of the let down that was Allagash Interlude."
"Drinkability is undeniably high. It is almost not even like drinking beer or alcohol. More like deliciously fizzy juice. An altogether wonderful beer."
"Medium body is well carbonated. Nice dry and acidic finish. Tasty stuff, well balanced."
"D- This beer seems to have everything going on for it but the taste... Hopefully it will get better as I adjust to the sourness. Not sure if I will be able to finish this bottle on my own, but still enjoyable."
"And it's that mouthfeel that ruins the drinkability for me. It's seems so carbonated and so sweet that it no longer feels like an ale. Wild, yes. Ale, no. The bottle states ""develops in teh bottle for up to 5 years"" and I would like to know how that changes this brew. But now, 5-6 months after bottling, it is still too young to enjoy to its fullest."
"An off white head jumps off to nearly two fingers and fades to a skim in nearly 3 minutes. Body is a hazy apple cider color in tone. Nose is distinctly tart with a real brett horse blanket feel up front. It has some raspberry and powdery sweet candy in the smell also. This beer immediately delivers on the super sour feel up front with a very brett induced tartness. This is very funky with a consistent mineral feel to the palate. Such a firm bold malt profile really balances the tartness to perfection. Mouthfeel is thick yeasty and really dough based and overall truely attractive. This is a perfectly drinkable sour that I wish I had a lot more of."
"(D)- A fantastic wild ale with a great flavor to it. Now, I havent had very many wild ales at this point, but I am really loving this one! The high fizzy carbonation may turn you off initially, but seriously... let it mellow for 20 minutes or so and you are good to go. Fruity, with a classic tart, almost sour kick. Very drinkable with only a 6.7% abv. This 22oz. bottle didnt last long, nor will the next one! The bottle says it can be aged for up to 5 years. . . I will definitely try to grab a few of these for the cellar."
"I don't have a clear recollection of a flavor three years ago, but I think this is sourer, and less Hawaiian punchy. More sweet tarty. I might give it higher ratings this time."
"D - Once the extreme carbonation subsides, it is nicely drinkable and quite refreshing."
"not quite Drei Fontainen but %^&ing delicious nevertheless"
" D- This beer has a big tartness and a big grapefruit bite but not much else. I don't know if age will help but the brett notes are pretty soft in the background."
"M/D - crisp mouthfeel, good carbonation, very nice flavor and balance all around, I try to grab this whenever i seen one."
"I found this to be a very decent offering from Goose Island. I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did, but would love to have another couple bottles. I have not yet been let down by their ""Belgian Style"" beers."
"Very enjoyable and elegant beer."
"Mouthfeel was great - effervescent and amazing. Drinkability was also a strength. Glad to have had the chance, and I'm also very interested to keep a bottle around for a while and see where she goes. While this wasn't anything near a Cantillon or Russian River in terms of bold flavor, Juliet was a really nice beer!"
"Holy head a-roonies!!! I barely get two ounces in the glass an I'm overwhelmed with head. Very spectacular looking, but a bit much at the same time. The color is a juicey and carbonated light merlot and amber. Holy wine barrel aged funk with a little monk! This beer hasthe aromas of blackberry, vine, oak, and some earthy yeast funk. Tart wine grapes mingle with fruity and also tart blackberries. The funky yeast just encourages the wine barrel flavors. Lots of grapes and blackberries, but also a little toasted wood thrown in to this diverse grab-bag. Funky yeast and to different fruit flavors make the flavors of this wild ale pretty complex. The palate is tart and fruity orchard farm funky. Lots of carbonation visible and palatable. Very nice offering from Goose Island."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. Nice light fruit notes, quick hit of tart flavor and a nice and even profile kept me coming back for more. I would have no problem at all trying this one again."
"J"
"D - Good and fruity wild ale...not overly sour - rather refreshing. This would be a great summer beer, but works well even in the winter. Probably good for those getting introduced to wild ales. This is good now, but think I'd like to try to put some age on a bottle or two and see how this progresses."
"Champagne-like feel. Light body, high carbonation. Airy texture. Much more drinkable than most sours. With most sour beers, a few ounces is more than enough, but a whole bomber of this wouldn't be a problem."
"D: this is quite tasty and leaves you wanting more. Very complex with a lot of sour character as well as fruitiness. If it weren't for the price tag, I could see my self drinking a lot of this"
"Drinkability is high and this is pretty refreshing for a wild ale. Overall very good, but not quite a standout within its style."
"Wonderful. Maybe not quite worth what you pay for it, but still effin wonderful."
"I guess it's not bad for a first effort, but can't say I was overwhelmingly impressed."
"D: Not as complex as some other sours but the appearance and mouthfeel make up for a lot here. A very enjoyable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to have again."
"Overall: This was a great way to discover the world of American Wild Ale. If you can get it pick up a bottle and try it. I will be getting more of this. Great taste and easy to drink."
"D: Like champagne , this one is really easy to put back. You need to sip it slowly because of the harsh feel but the taste is very subtle that would be appealing to a wide variety of people."
"Side note, with the carbonation as it stands after just a half-year, I'm not sure I really want to sock this one away for 5 years, if there's still fermentable sugar in there for Brett to work on."
"Edit: The addition of the yeast to the beer does improve the feel, specifically the body, a little bit and goes a someway towards improving the complexity, almost to the point where I'd give the taste a 4, but not quite."
"M/D - Light and very well carbonated. Verging on too much carbonation. Very lively in the mouth. Just the right balance of sweetness and sour in the beer to keep this one very drinkable."
"Overall, this one is a little bit messy as it sits, but it just reeks of potential (for both aging, and small tweaks by the brewers during the next batch) The carbonation makes me worry a touch about cellaring this one near any gems, but im gonna put some age on a bottle in the corner, hahaha. Other than that it shows great aging potential. This is a great beer, but i think the next batch (assuming they make a couple tweaks) with a little age on it could be a real gem. A fine beer."
"The mouth is crisp & dry with active carbonation. I like this beer. It is a perfect size to split and savor with the wife. Another winner from Goose."
"D - I found this to be very Cantillon-esque, perhaps a more lightweight version of a Belgian wild ale. However, Juliet remained quite drinkable throughout despite her tartness."
"drinkability is good. the acidic side is feeling a touch high, but it's pretty tasty and otherwise fairly balanced. a nice wild ale."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, very tart and dry in the finish, pretty neat stuff."
"Great experience with this. Thanks again to Scott. This is going right back onto my wants list."
"D- easy to polish this one off and was left wishing i had more. something id like to check out more often, but the price tag is quite the deterrent."
"Overall, another one of those beers that I just want more of. Easy drinking and a ton of nice sour flavors. I can't wait to see what age does to this one."
"D - Can happily get this down and drink it all day."
"Update based on 2010 bottled. This version is brand new. Biggest difference is the aroma, very buttery, not very tart. Still not a big fan of this beer, 2009 is probably better."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable sour ale that is a little more simple and approachable than many others. Quite excellent."
"For such a monumental head, the carbonation is maintained masterfully. Never does the spritzy nature of the drink hurt the ability to taste the broad spectrum of flavors. The crisp acidity of this beer makes the a brilliant (if expensive) potential partner for an array of foods. This may be the finest thing to come out of Goose Island, which considering it's company (BCS, Matilda, Naughty Goose, et. al.) is quite an accomplishment."
"D: This would be a fantastic introduction to sour beers for anyone who is interested, though it may be a bit hard to come across. Knowing how much I paid for this beer I am trying as hard as I can not to gulp this beer down because it is just so gosh darn refreshing, it's a shame this beer was released in the fall it would have been an excellent compliment to summer. Can't wait to see what a few years might do to my other bottle."
"D - A great wild from Goose that I hope they keep making for future batches. I would like to try a batch #1 to see what (if any) differences there are."
"Sparkling, effervescent, quite drinkable for a sour."
"drinkabliity is great. an easy going sour with a very palatable character. finishes lighly sharp with a soft aftertaste. very well put together and solid with a bit of aging. can't wait for the next batch to come out! cheers!"
"Truly a special beer with complexity for miles."
"D:Super easy drinking. Very nice and light. On tap this would be a wonderful joy."
"First batch from early '09, I believe. 22 ounce bottle shared by HopHead84 a while back. Thanks, Shane. Pinkish-amber appearance, a large white head rises and retains well. Tons of brett funk in the nose, with a tart berry-like undercurrent that I couldn't specifically identify as blackberry. As it warms, I get a touch of pale malt and something a bit hay-like. Fruity, dry and tart on the palate, quite acetic but not in a stomach-churning way. Light bodied with high carbonation. Dry, woody, acetic finish. This is a great first sour for Goose Island, I hope they make more in the future."
"D: Great wild attempt from GI."
"D: Wonderful sour offering by Goose Island."
"If you like wine, you'll like Juliet. This is a wine-drinker's beer if I've ever had one before. The color is sparkling ruby red with a white head. The aroma is of oak, wine, berries, yeast, alcohol, and funkiness. The beer has a wonderful effervescence that makes the flavors come through even better. The taste is of berries and wine. There is a surprising tart quality which is offset by a sweet flavor as well. Overall the sweet/tart is very balanced. It does resemble a wine in many ways. This is no doubt due to the aging in wine barrels."
"Light carbonation tickled the tongue and made me want more. This is a bottle that is definitely going on my wants list. Just wish it was available in New York... That should speak volumes about its drinkability."
"Smell and Taste: Besides the cherries, the fruity qualities have started to fade and the brett is beginning to take over."
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a cloudy orange. Aroma of sour notes, yogurt, and sweet tart candies. Flavor is initially acidic with some yogurty and funky notes in the finish. The palate was a bit on the acidic side. Tasty but I wasn't as super impressed as I thought I'd be."
"Juliet is a damn fine brew from Goose. I can see a few more months making this sour incredibly delicious. The blackberry notes work incredibly well to make this one hell of an easy drinking wild bug driven libation."
"Thanks to GbVDave for this one. 22oz bottle served in the new style Boulevard Chalice. Poured a pretty reddish orange with a quickly dissipating head. A little Brett in the aroma also some berries. Decent amount of sourness. A little sweetness. Light bodied. Some berry flavor. Nice sour pucker in the finish. Also subtle wood in the finish. Very easy drinking. I wish I had another bottle to age. I'd like to see where this one goes."
"Aromas are pretty subtle and muted, especially at colder temps. Fruity and berries. Some wild yeast. Everything about this beer is very delicate... except for its carbonation. Wow this is just too bubbly and effervescent. Spritzery bubbles scrub my tongue and steal away some of what could've been. Still, there are bright flavors of tart fruit and berries. Light merlot and grape juice with a little earth. An interesting beer which might pair nicely with a summer salad - it's certainly thirst-quenching, crisp and dry. I look forward to future properly carbonated batches."
"The bomber won't be hard to finish, but this is not something that you would drink more than one of. Moderately low ABV, but it will definitely kill your palate for a while."
"650mL bomber, dated JAN 09 on the label, purchased from Binny's in Lake Zurich for about $16 after Dark Lord Day. The beer is faded pinkish lilac color, hazy to the point of opacity, with an off-white thin 1/4 finger of foam that laces with good adhesion to the glass. The aroma is everything you could want in a wild ale, musty leather and horse blanket with a hint of tart berry. The beer tastes just as good, not puckeringly sour, more of an accessible wild ale with just enough bite to keep an experienced palate happy. Undertones of berry flavors (apparently this was aged in wine barrels with blackberries) along with a mellow pucker and hints of lactose, delicious. The beer is well carbonated and light bodied, enhancing drinkability (and only 6.7%). This is definitely one of the better wild ales I've tried, Goose Island is showing strong brewing chops lately."
"This is a good example for the style; I truly wish something similar was available locally. That said, there are others I would seek out instead after having tried it once."
"This beer is extremely drinkable if you can appreciate sour beers. I had been waiting a long time for this to be bottled - I'm glad that it's finally available."
"The American Wild Ale is currently my favourite style and Goose Island did a *great* job with Juliet. Thanks a bunch again, Joe!"
"nice drinkability"
"Tasted very similar to the aroma but not as sweet. A tart berry blast on the tip of the tongue with some funk and plastic flavors in the finish. Quite dry in the end and the dryness seemed to intensify with every sip. Tart and salty berry flavors, lemon tartness, and a bit of dry cracker flavors in the aftertaste. Getting more merlot-like flavors after a few sips, dry and tannic with hints of brett. Medium-high carbonation at first but it mellowed down a bit after a few minutes. Very tasty beer and would love to have again."
"D: A sipper secondary to the tingly carbonation. Tasty, and sour. Glad I got the opportunity to try this beer, a solid wild ale. Wish I had a few more bottles to lay down and see how it changes with time."
"I'll be interested to see how my remaining three bottles develop over the years. I look forward to less wine/fruit and more wild/funk and sour."
"Drinkability- Very tasty brew that is on its way to what I wanted it to be young. A bit more funk would have gone a long way but regardless this is a fine brew. Nice and fruity and very enjoyable. Thanks much Mike!"
"A really enjoyable sour from Goose Island. The first I've had from them."
"D: Very solid overall. Goose Island is really stepping up its game with the new collection."
"pour is murky... the best way to put it is a berliner weisse with the raspberry Himbeere. smell is initially blackberry, plum yogurt... palate of cabernet grape with a heavy accent of blackberry and rosemary. spanish wine simple but solid. tart with a banana bread finish. a light meaty quality. almond malt, vanilla mellow. appetite inducing. has a flemish wild ale odor that carries. not overpowering but works with the character. fantastic. glad its a chicago brewery. quite unique. not an american beer expectation to say the least."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a strong bite of carbonation keeping it lively."
"Amazing beer. The balance between all the flavors was great. I was afraid it might be too fruity, but was not disappointed."
"D - The best version I have tried out of all the samples Goose has been giving out over the last year. Complex and tasty."
"The aroma was great with hints of citrus, blackberry, and sour cherries galore. The beer poured a hazy orange color with just a slight head and good lacing. The flavor was an immediate sour cherry, almost overwhelmingly so. I got a faint hint of the blackberry, wood and spice. My major problem with this beer is that it had no body to it at all. It had the mouthfeel of sherbet mixed with 7up. I like effervescence in my beer, but this tasted like sour punch without the sugar. There's a nice alcohol finish to it and it's pretty well rounded on the finish...I just really wanted more body to it."
"Overall, I believe this beer presents a compelling argument against the notion that a wild ale must be predictably pungent and puckering in sourness. I find it much more drinkable (and appreciable for a longer duration) than some of the other highly touted wilds."
"Much more acetic, lacking the spritzy carbonation of batch 1-2. More fruit flavor, but it sacrifices carbonation. Will age one, jury is still out."
"Mouthfeel is light with a vibrant, sharp carbonation up front."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with an airy quality about it helped along by some fast moving carbonation. I'm unsure of the ABV here, but the brew goes down easily and has a refreshing quality about it with the vinous berry flavors and the subtle sourness. I could even see drinking this one the beach on a hot summer day. Very glad I was able to sample this and look forward to its release. Keep up the experiments Goose!"
"Pours a fully clouded red hued brown. Nose is just funky sour goodness. Flavor brings the same. Lots of sour. Lots of funk. Tart fruits on top of vinegar. Yes friends. This is an American Wild Ale. Feel is typical; kind of thicker with a lower and slightly biting carbonation. Mmmmm. My favorite style. I love it."
"D: This was incredible! This needs to be available in more places...like now!"
"So, my thoughts on the Juliet. First thoughts were that this is one of the most unique beers I have ever tasted. I don't have a lot of experience with Brett beers but after Juliet I will be seeking more out. There was a nice balance between the funky, tartness of the Brett and the mild sweetness of the berries. It started out with a mild tartness, similar to a wine and then finished with a faint sweetness and a hint of oak. The tartness was the flavor that lingered the longest afterwards but it was pleasant and not overwhelming. Honestly I haven't been able to stop thinking about this beer and the impression that it left on me and my taste buds. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many different beers I have tasted and few, if any, have left me pining for another almost a week later. I was somewhat reserved about it when it was compared to a lambic but I personally think it has much more appeal than a mainstream lambic such as Framboise which I feel is somewhat cloying. Also, it is much easier on the palate than a lambic such as Cantillion which can shy new beer drinkers away from the enjoyment of tart flavors. From what I've read the Sour Beers are going to be the next big thing. They are huge on the west coast but besides from a few small brewers (Jolly Pumpkin for example) no one has really tapped into them here in the Midwest. I think Juliet would be wildly successful and a great addition to the reserve line."
"Drinkability: Very high. I look forward to drinking some bottles of this when it is released. Could be funkier for my tastes but really quite a pleasant beer just the way it is."
"Overall, a great beer and I look forward to release in bottles."
"Very nice in the mouth, good carbonation, and very drinkable. A great try and a solid lambic."
