"O- very fruit forward sour that drinks pretty easy and hides the alcohol well"

"Beer pours a clear amber with a white foamy head that falls to a thin collar. Nice thick gobs of lacing despite the subdued head.  The scent is full of tropical fruits as well as peach. Very fresh scent. Upon tasting, the initial fruity sweetness gives way to a crisp, tart, and acidic finish. Not a full on sour bomb, but it is there and very enjoyable. Wonderful lingering flavor of a slightly sweet mango. Lively carbonation and light bodied. Very enjoyable beer and a sour ale that is likely to be best fresh."
""
"pours a nice amber orange.  smells a bit strange due to the dry hopped sour.  very crisp.  really enjoy this taste as the sourness is mild and the hops mesh well."
""
""
""
"not as big a fan of dry hopped sours as I thought I would be.  This is a good example of the style though."
""
"Pours a cloudy dark golden color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are mild.  Has that Belgium yeast sour aroma.  Slightly fruity.  The taste is excellent!  Bready at first but quickly hits you with a sour, fruity blast.  Leaves that sour taste on your palate.  Definitely one of my favorite beers.  I just wish it wasn't so damn expensive."
""

"O: 4.25 An excellent example of a dry-hopped sour. Neither the hops nor the sour flavors are too aggressive. All very balanced and refreshing with enough going on that keeps you interested."
"Tasty unique beer, sweet and sour with a pleasantly astringent and floral dry hopped flavor. Pours a hazy light copper color, and has an aroma that matches the taste."

"On tap at Naja’s. Pours hazy orange with no head and some lacing. Aroma is sour tropical fruits, vinegar, and a little funk. Taste is initially sour peach and mango, settling to a slightly spicy hop bitterness. Medium bodied, low to mid carbonation, dry, and a little sticky."

"This smells like an IPA and tastes like an IPA that's a little sour. Overall a really good beer."
""
""
""
"Beautiful pale golden color....the head is white and lasting.  Effervescent and a bit of haze. Mine aroma is enticing...sour notes, but much more wood,mfruit, and an undercurrent of hops.  The taste is spot on....lots of up front sourness, but it isn't overpowering.  Huge lemon and grapefruit flavor.  Wood, some balance, and a little grain.  Finish is tart and clean.  Great."
"Nice hop  still sour notes. Clean finish"

"Le Terroir pours a golden color with a small swirling head.  There is a big aroma, big grapefruit notes with hints of peach and hops.  The taste is very sour, nice grapefruit flavors, hints of peach.  Nice body nice feel.  Overall its a big sour fruity beer."
""
""
"Little too sour for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good stuff. Hops play really well against the beer's sourness and provide lots of flavor and aroma while not really adding any bitterness. Definitely worth trying."
"It was so good on tap had to go buy a few bottles!"

"Many points for originality here.  Exceptional flavor profile as well and very well balanced.  It's kind of a cross between an IPA and a sour blond ale.  I'm happy to say, its a good combo.  I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""

"Incredibly refreshing and punchy.  Not overly bitter - has a nice lingering finish similar to blood orange.  Expensive in Portland, OR at $15 a 22oz."

"O: not a big sour beer drinker but the are growing on me. This one has some great aroma but most of the taste is a strong sour."
"Pretty solid sour and the hops add a nice complexity. Overall it's nothing amazing and not worth the $15 price tag. For a dry hop IPA I'd rather have a red swingline."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was delicious. Decent sour/tart pucker as well as the bright notes from the dry-hopping. As I sat with my buddy trying this one, we agreed that this would be an awesome brew to try and clone, and that it would be a great house beer. I am new to sours, and this convinced me to take a further plunge. Lips of Faith series rocks!"

"Single pint bomber poured into a tulip. A sparkling dark orange with two fingers of sudsy, rocky white foam. Aroma is initially innocent enough, some orange and lemon rinds, but blooms into some pretty serious sour funk with a fruity flair, full of sour mangoes, green apples, peaches, white grapes, limes, vinegar, lemon juice. A massive sour gummy candy bouquet with just a hint of barnyard. On the palate the hops seem to accent rather than dominate. Tons of sour fruit: Muscat grapes, lemon-lime, those sour tangerines that are full of seeds, and green mango, super acidic and corrosive, again with little true funk in the old style. Fiercely carbonated as well, like a sparkling wine. Getting more hops on the nose late, quite floral. A subtle sweetness like a pina colada lurks underneath. Body on the light side but not watery or thin per se. I'm still branching out into sour beer territory but this burgeoning fan deems this an ""instant classic", at least if one is trying to capture the sour fruit stylings of Rodenbach or tannic white wines. Wonderful."

"Excellent sour wild ale with an ideal mouth feel"
"Pours a clear medium orange, with creamy one finger thick white head, settles slowly to a thin ring and a mess of lace down the glass. Smell: sour peach, mango, green apple candy, lime; herbal, hay and acetic notes. Taste: lime segment, green apple, peach skin, tart white grape, woody and mildly herbal notes. Creamy, medium bodied. Hopping and tartness are well integrated, quite tasty. 2014."

"O (4) – Overall, I’m glad I got this beer.  22oz is a lot, and I’d have probably preferred it to have been a 12 oz bottle!  I have no other sours to compare to, but I would drink this again."

"Orangish pour light head. This beer smells awesome. Hoppy and fruitastic. Here is where things go south for me. The taste punches you in the mouth. I'm not a fan of sours. The thing about this one though is that there is some tasty stuff going on after the initial kick in the pants. It has a complex taste that I think would grow on me if not for the sour kick. I think this is probably right up the alley of all of the sour drinkers. Not for me, but I think it has some tasty aspects to it."
"O - A good tasting sour, great aroma."
""

"Delightfully tart. Subtle pickup of the Amarillo hops. Yeah, I'd drink this one again.  And again."

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, I have had hardly any dry hopped sours, but to me this is what they should be all about, it's a sour beer first and once the sourness starts to fade just enough hops show up to remind that there is indeed some hops and this beer and I think it adds complexity to a style that can sometimes be to dominated by just sour and not much else.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little acidic, a little crisp, not too dry, not filling at all and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me, I might be able to drink the whole bottle, but there's a good chance that the acidic aspect would start to wear on me.  What I liked the most about this beer was how well the hoppy aspects worked with this beer, it's got some nice hop flavors and some really nice hop aromas with out adding bitterness which I think would really clash with the sour.  What I liked the least about this beer was how acidic it was, I know that comes with the territory when it comes to sours, but if it was toned down just a little I think it would help the drinkability.  I would for sure buy this beer again and I wouldn't mind seeing how it ages, but I'm not sure it would get any better since it's dry hopped.  I would recommend this to any sour fans, it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I was little impressed with how well the hops worked with the sour, they used the hops in such a way were it accents the fruity sour flavors and it's far from dominating.  So far this in now one of my favorite beers from New Belgium and in the lips of faith series, it's one of the better sours I've had and it's now the best dry hopped sour I've had.  Great job guys this is one tasty beer and I really enjoyed drinking it, keep up all that hard work."

"Hoppy, super light-bodied, lightly sour. Nice."

"Poured into a small tulip- quarter inch light head that quickly faded to a very thin film. Hazy golden color.  Aroma has huge fruity smells, both lots of tropical and citrus. I also got some sweet malt notes and some funky yeast. The taste is wonderful, with so many great flavors assaulting your palate. Grapefruit, mango, and peach notes slap you in the face up front with a nice lingering sour yeasty flavor on the back end. Mouthfeel was fairly light and crisp, with the tartness putting a nice prickly feel on your tongue. Overall, this is an outstanding sour, with the dry-hopping adding those great aromas and flavors. This one's a keeper!"
""
"Extremely enjoyable sour/wild ale that I've had the pleasure of having on draft 3 occasions in 3 different locations.  Aroma is a bit deceiving in that I picked up a nice dose of hop and fruit but the flavor that followed was more dank and earthy. Very dry finish with a bit of tannic bitterness lingering.  Very good beer and would happily enjoy anytime....salute."

"Bought this beer twice. $16.99 bottle, little bit of more money on this one, but well worth it.  Very sour! Best sour ale as I tested so far.  I actually have bought two bottles and they both were a treat. Weird taste, but after the taste you just want more and more and more!!!!"

"I had my reservations, but this beer really surprised me. The strong fruit (mango, papaya, grapefruit) blasts through at first, and then the sour hits hard on the back end. Realy, really unique sour and definitely worth the $16 price tag."

"This is one of the most interesting beers I have ever had. It has a fruity profile from the hops that is quite different from a traditional sour or lambic, and which blends with the tart, puckering sourness in a unique fashion. I'm very glad I got to try it."

"The beer pours a fairly vigorous and creamy white head that dissipates moderately. The beer itself is a clear solid gold. The beer smell is pretty complex and delicious. The beer has both a tarty component and a fruity/tropical part. The tart sour (similar to that of grapefruit and Granny Smiths) is pretty strong and dominates the smell but is delightful when the tropical part comes out. The tropical smell is a little bit like watermelon and melon with a bit of sweet papaya. The beer taste is similar but the tart is stronger and the tropical part is harder to make out. The tropical part still comes out and is pretty good but it's hard to keep the beer in your mouth for that long. The tropical portion is generally stronger after the beer has warmed a little and stronger in the aftertaste. The same melon notes from before are present. The tart comes out with the same notes but is amplified by the bitter citrus hops."
""

"Fantastic beer, actually comes close to my favorite Dry hopped sour from the same state. Batch 60. and a touch behind love buzz that share similarities. Highly recomend."

"Crisp, lightly acetic, and has a great fruity taste that hits you instantly.  The hoppy flavor hits afterwards, which isn't overwhelming to the rest of the balance of this terroir.   Not too sour, not too fruity, enough hops, perfect terroir."
""
""
""
"One tasty, and ultimately approachable wild ale, the yeast and beasties having learned a whole lot of manners and decorum, apparently, or maybe it's just the huge fruit notes (origins duly muddled) that gloss and smooth everything over.  Whatever, this is a pleasure to drink, especially given the thoroughly integrated 15-proof booze.  Hello mueder, hello foeder!"

"I couldn't decide for a long time if I loved or hated this beer. It's just so different than anything I've had before... actually, no, it's really similar to two very dissimilar things I've had before (IPAs and sours). Some swigs feature an explosion of hops, while others are straight-up sour, and most are some crazy commingling of the two. Once I wrapped my brain around the dichotomy, I decided I loved it. The fruity notes in the hops provide a great layer on top of the fruity sour of the base beer. Will be seeking out more of this."

"Great beer, thought last years was not as hoppy though but had a bigger sour kick than this years, I dont know if it is just me or not. One of my favorites from New Belgium."
""

"Pour is mostly transparent golden amber with lots of off white head.  Nose is heavily resinous hop with citrus notes and a bit of candied sugar and light nights of bread crust and grain.  Taste has a bit more grain up front, gets resinous, lots of hops, moderate sourness, a bit bitter in back, light acidity, candied sugar mid palate, citrus and some leathery brett notes.  Medium body, a bit syrupy, decent carb."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy reddish orange body with two fingers of fluffy, long lasting off-white head. The beer looks wonderful and very appealing. Scents of orange flesh, tropical fruit, especially mango, but also with some pineapple, some spicy yeast phenols and a hint of wild yeast and a very faint light pine. Overall impression of aroma is light and fruity, very bright, with a nice undertone of spicy yeast keeping it balanced. Very nice. Flavor begins moderately sour, with a nice wild funk, light pine resin, notes of tropical fruit and lemon zest. This moves into a middle that is still moderately sour, with more pronounced notes pine resin, wild, sour funk, some lemongrass and lemon zest. Finish is dry with high sourness notes of lemongrass, tropical fruit, indeterminate citrus fruit and zest, wild, sour funk and light pine. Aftertaste is wild, sour funk, lemon, hints of peach and tropical fruit and slight lemongrass. Overall impression of flavor is of a sour, funky, complex ale that combines nice wild funk, combined with nice levels of fruitiness and a pine and herbal character from the lemongrass. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a puckering, drying, refreshing feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nicely sour and puckering wild ale that is quite refreshing. Overall this is a wonderful American Wild Ale that is refreshingly tart, fruity, wild, funky and piney in aroma and flavor. Aided by a wonderful mouthfeel it is a nicely refreshing ale. Very well done and quite good."

"Looks great! Golden with good clarity and a big white head. Very interesting and unique aroma.  Fruity, earthy and funky.  Good depth.  Tartness leads in the flavor but doesn't overwhelm. Fruity and hoppy aspects play along with it making something, again, very unique.  This is nothing like any beer I've had before.  Well worth a try."

"2014 Bottle shared with friends at home on Oct. 3, 2014. Pours golden, with a bit of slight orange hue, small white head that dissipates quickly. Beautiful aroma of grassy hops, hay, a little funk, some nice citrus and tangerines, and some sweet bready maltiness. Flavor follows the smell, but with much more citrus fruit and sourness. A nice sharp lactic tart here with big juicy apricots and tangerines, and a light grassy hay-like hop bite that doesn’t get in the way of thtis juicy sour brew. Dry finish after the juicy fruits, light to medium bodied, with plus carbonation. This beer exceeded my expectations. What an awesome, awesome sour from New Belgium."

"Really awesome tartness in this. Not getting a ton of the hop bitterness in the finish due to the crazy awesome tartness but I do get a nice aromatic sweet hop smell in the nose. Really great beer."
"I am not sure if I like the addition of depth to a sour.  There seems to be a regular beer not-too-well hidden behind a dose of fruity tartness.  I liked the tropical fruit tastes with the sour.  However, adding the more earthy tones that I assume come from larger amounts of more flavorful hops than might otherwise be used in a sour I think detracts from the part I initially enjoyed.  I still rated it decently because it is a fine beer, but I think there was potential to be even better."

"Not a big fan of sours, but this beer has so much going on, it's hard not to be impressed.  Along with the expected sour component, there's some nice vanilla, grapes, and wine (cabernet is what I thought I picked up).  Can't imagine drinking a full pint or tulip of this, but in a small, 4 ounce taster glass, this was very nice.  Impressive."
""
""
""
""
"Clear orange sun colored pour with an airy one-finger white head. Aroma is big and fruity with grapefruit and apricot standing out. Excellent tart flavor of tropical fruit and citrus. Grapefruit, apricot and orange peel flavors really stand out. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - My first foray into sours, and I must say, I'm veryimpressed with this beer. It's a sensory delight with a big blast of tartness up front that quickly mellows into a brew with many elements and complexities. I may not know a lot about sour beers right now, but I can tell this is a beautifully crafted beer in general."

"Golden beer with little head, smells of fresh hops and flowers. Taste is a medium bitterness with citrus notes, grapefruit, crisp apple, oaky sweet hops and refreshing."

"Overall (4.5): This is, without a doubt, at least as good if not better than the sum of its parts. And yes, I know it’s pasteurized and the heyday of all New Belgium sours is supposed to be prior to the era of pasteurization, but goddamn this is delicious. Absurdly good, like, why-isn’t-this-always-available delicious. The base sour is extremely solid, which I feel confident in saying after having had an old bottle (post-pasteurization) a couple of years ago after the hops had died off, and that was plenty tasty on its own. But this is in a zone of its own right now, while the hops are still kickin’. Definitely pick this beer up."

"Pours a nice gold body with a chill haze and spotted lacing. Aroma is fresh hops, very floral and citrusy, almost certainly Citra. I take a gulp and my senses are thrown for a loop! Vinous, white-wine like, sour and ends with citrusy hops. My taste buds were going crazy and i loved it. Meshed hoppy and sour perfectly, a win for me."

"Hazy, rusty orange with a small white head that amounts to a loose collection of frothy bubbles. Tart, fruity aroma with some acetic notes coming through to join a touch of wood, while citrusy hops and grass waft above. Peaches, flowers, bergamot, and lime, getting better as it warms, adding a subtle tea-like smell to the equation. Sour flavor with a definite peachy, fruity hop element. Lots of stone fruit, grapefruit, and lingering sour lemon. Such a smooth melding of hops and sourness. Refreshing and drinkable, but not super acetic, which is pleasant. Very smooth and well rounded. Dry and slightly puckering, leading to some dryness on the gums. I could drink a lot of this if given the opportunity. I had to keep restraining myself from taking huge gulps. Seems less super dry and funky than Felix on its own, thanks to the lovely fruity and floral integration of hoppy goodness. Good stuff!"
"Glowing amber orange under an off white small but bubbly head. Aroma is lovely. Bright, floral and juicy pitted fruits/fresh peaches and apricots, and a tropical kind of refreshing tartness that permeates the nostrils. Nice doughy malts underneath. Taste is also very refreshing, sour but rounded out with lightly sweet fruit. Very dry and snappy throughout. Clean, fruity, tart, balanced, and extremely drinkable. The hops work great with their sour base beer here."

""

"If you want to pucker your face off.... This not going to do that. It shows what moderate sourness, zingy hops, and interesting flavors can do as a team."

"Light brown to dull copper penny in color with moderate clarity. A minuscule layer of thin white head partially covers the top of the beer. Aroma is a complicated mixture of tart Brett and earthy citrus like hops. The taste is initially very tart and yet quickly the citrus like hops follow and help keep the tartness in check. The fade is an interesting tango of the ultra sour Brett notes and more fresh citrus hops. The mouth is dry and earthy. This a very refreshing roller coaster ride for your palate. Not for the meek tongued!"

"This was a perfect sour, very complex, and right to the point. You get so many different flavor profiles from this. You get lemon, Granny Smith Apple, just a bitter/sour fruit bomb. The dry hopping of this beer works perfectly, and the low malt profile balances this beer out."

"Overall: A high quality American-ish Sour Ale. A good introduction to sours IMO."
"This is a bad mama jama right here..."
""
""
"In the world of wild ales, this is more a somewhat tame one. Leather and barnyard tones. Mostly leather with a minimal hint of the barn. This is okay. I don't know if this was meant to be aged in order to bring out more character, but I feel like it could be bringing a lot more, but just isn't. Glad to try it, but not really doing anything for me. I prefer La Folie over this one."
""
""
"O: First and foremost it's a sour ale. The barrel aging appears to have smoothed it out a bit, and it's very well balanced by the hops. And I have to mention that it's refreshing, but in that slightly dry way that leaves you wanting just one more sip. Honestly, I can't wait to have another."

"22 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 8/23/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour green apple, cherry, grape, cranberry, grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, floral, grass, clove, pepper, oak, leather, hay, straw, vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of hop, yeast, and oak notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart green apple, cherry, grape, cranberry, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, hay, straw, floral, grass, oak, clove, pepper, leather, vinegar, musty funk, white wine, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart green apple, cherry, grape, cranberry, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, floral, grass, hay, oak, clove, leather, light vinegar, musty funk, white wine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of yeast, hop, and oak barrel flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible dry hopped sour! All around fantastic balance and complexity of the hop and wild ale flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. An extremely delicious offering."

"As far as sours go, this is quite unique and enjoyable. The hops seem to be adding a lot of grapefruit and other citrus notes to this beer- combined with the acidity of the sour ale, makes for a grapefruit juice-like experience. Wish there was more to the nose, but honestly, with the way the hops complement the sour ale base, I really cannot complain about the overall beer."

"Le Terroir has been a favorite of mine for many moons now. The bottle doesn't stand up to draft but it's in no way shabby. A bracing vinegar tartness, fruity dry hopping, minerality, and an insatiable drinkability make for a highly enjoyable libation."

"2013 bottle shared at Proof. Pours a pale gold with some white head. Medium white collar, and no lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops and a bit of pine, lots of fruity funkiness. Taste is mouth wateringly sour, in a good way. Some of that fruit ester funk in the taste too. Light body, sour bite on the tongue, and low carbonation."

"O. A very nice sour. I took my time with this beer, which certainly may have influenced the appearance. This ale leaves a very gentle aftertaste that is awesome. I didn’t see the hops but I’m not holding it against the beer because it’s flat out great. I highly recommend this to sour fans."

"Had this for the first time over the weekend and was quite delighted to get another shot at it last night. Off the bat I love the idea of this beer, barrel aged sour then dry hopped for 8 days... Pours very cleanly, but the aroma off this one was more attention grabbing. Fruity and floral with a bit of funk, you're drawn right in. Don't get it twisted, this is a sour beer that begs to be consumed slowly as there is a fully formed wild palette in the brew. The hops do a lot to cut the sharpness leaving this a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer. Perfect gateway beer for IPA drinkers trying to get into sours."

"Great offering from new belgium, might have some competition with la folie. A fantastic sour blonde. The combination of hops with beer adds a great taste and feel to the beer. I would wish this was offered year round rather than just being a seasonal beer."

"Overall, another sour LoF beer that I'm just blown away by. I'm glad that NB decided to re-release this beer, as I missed out on it the first time it hit the market. This one is wonderfully balanced and I might suggest it to someone who was looking to get into sour beers, as the hoppiness provides some flavor profiles that might be more familiar to someone who was new to the characteristics of sour beer. I will definitely continue buying this beer as long as they keep releasing it."
"The beer pours a hazy golden amber with a thin off-white head that fades while lacing. The nose is a potent mix of piney/earthy cascade hops carried on by a bit of tart funk. The taste brings a lot more malty sweetness and flavor forward accented by earthy hops and a light, tart fruity (watermelon, kiwi, grapes?) funkiness. Medium bodied, well carbonated, slightly tart and acidic, but drinkable, earthy hops, lingering fruit, masked alcohol...like whoa. This beer is a great seasonal sour from NB, more drinkable and approachable than la folie (which I also thoroughly enjoy) and has a better chance pairing with a meal for that reason. I'd definitely drink this one again and recommend to others."

"Have had the pleasure of enjoying this beer many times in many settings, finally time for a review. Pours a somewhat cloudy orange with a blanket of white head that retains nicely and leaves heavy lacing. The nose starts with fresh hops, the simcoe and amarillo bring some pine, grass, and tropical fruit to the table. This is followed by some toasty malt aroma paired with a nice dose of lactobacillus. The taste is way more tart than the nose lets you believe. Notes of tart cherries, lemon, balsamic vinegar, and tropical fruits are all present on the palate. The sourness is refreshing and plenty puckering, the hops kind of tame down the intensity. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and light. Overall, this is a very unique sour that features the best of both the hoppy and the wild ale world."

"What a beer! If you like sours but do not want to be overwhelmed with tartness this is your baby! Probably my single favorite hands down New Belgium beer ever produced. Luckily my local brewery taps this the past couple years. Not much I can say other than you just gotta try it. Some folks are not fans and this seems to be a love it or hate it kinda brew. Barring some of the Trappist sour offerings in Belgium this is one of the best to come out of the New World!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very interesting brew. Glad I tried it, but not a beer I will come back to."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great, crisp refreshing and tart. Everything have come to expect in a good sour and more."
"Wow."
"O-This is a damn sour brew. Not a lot of funkiness and the nice aroma doesn't follow thru into the taste. An interesting brew but too much sourness and I don't care for the bitter finish."

"This beer was my baptism in sours, and I couldn't be happier with it. Ended up leaving the store with a bottle of Cuvee des Jacobin Rouge and Petrus Pale to round out the night!"
"Very well constructed beer. It has renewed my interest in New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm blown away, I did not realize I would enjoy this so much. It's like a really excellent sour beer and a really excellent IPA all in one, and the two halves combine to produce a beer greater than the sum of its parts!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I want more. It's an amazing beer. The 96 point rating is a tad bit low in my opinion, I can't find anything wrong with it. I'm not the most experienced sour beer drinker, but I've had Cantillon , Drie Fonteinen, Cascade and Russian River offerings and I wouldn't hesitate to put this up against any of them. Thank you New Belgium. What a truly fantastic beer."
""

""
""

"O- Great beer this one is, not too sour or funky and the hops are faint enough not to clash. This replaces La Folie as the best New Belgium beer I've had. For a place that does a lot of middle of the road stuff, this shows they can really deliver when they want to."

"T: There is a ton going on here. I picked up apple cider vinegar, black cherries, a little spiciness, apricot and a little white wine as well. The sourness is big (though not as big as some of RR's sours) and the prickly carbonation really does well to enhance the sourness. There's a bit of bready malts in the background that hold the tartness in check a bit. Overall, this is a really well done sour. It reminded me a lot of Compunction and it may be better. I'll definitely be trying this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lower carb than I expected. Medium mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden color with a funky floral, citrus, grapefruit pine aroma. Taste is like nothing I’ve had before. It starts off like a solid IPA and then slowly melds into what a sour ale should be. Tastes of lemon, grapefruit, oranges and lime on the hop notes. The sour starts when it crosses from pine into the citrus flavors that complement this beer perfectly as it transitions into mango and peach.Tons of tropical fruit flavor in this. Mouthfeel is very nice and refreshing."
""
""
""
"While I have not tried the esteemed wild/sour ales from Russian River, I am a big fan of what New Belgium as done with wild/sour ales, especially La Folie and Le Terroir. I do object to La Folie being categorized as a Flemish Brown. It is just as much of an American Wild Ale as this is. Both are first rate, though."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber color. Creamy head with slight lacing on the side of glass. Smells sour, similar to a lambic. Taste has an immediate tartness, reminds me of a cider a little bit. As the tartness faded there is a hop aftertaste that comes out and lingers. It's not over the top hoppy like some IPA's but just a light pleasant hop presence. Overall different from what I'm used to, but very refreshing in it's own way."
""
"O: An exceptional beer that places a unique dry-hopped twist, on a sour ale. We'll worth a try or two."
""
""
"Overall: A nice, tangy sour ale from New Belgium. Excellent, fruity hoppy nose and tart taste. Really showcases the lacto in my opinion. One thing is that I definitely wish I could have picked up on more oakyness from the foeders these are aged in. Given the cost though I would recommend splitting the bottle with a friend."

"Hazy amber pour producing a couple of fingers of white head that recedes to form a lasting ring. Body is fairly light and sprightly for a sour. Aroma and flavor are complex with peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, cedar shavings, sour cherry, vinegar, horse blanket/barnyard funk, anda bit of allspice, The judicious use of Amarillos for dry hopping was ingenious, as the fruitiness imparted by the hops segues seamlessly into the funkiness contributed by the brett.. This one is not quite as sour as La Folie, but has a more intriguing balance and flavor profile, and it has a better drinkability. Buy at least few, (it’s considerably cheaper than the Folie) if you can find them."
""
"overall an excellent sour!"
""
""
"O: Fuck, this is tasty. Normally, a brew I really adore (for example, Troegs Perpetual IPA) I just want to guzzle 'til the cows come home, but this is something I'll savor happily - and still wish I had another bottle to drink. I need more of this in my life, right now."

"Update: After having this many times over the last 8 months, I need to adjust my scores down a bit. The awesome mango fruit flavor is completely gone along with the hops. Still good, but not quite what it was when fresh. Will still age some and see how it does."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy dark orange color with a two finger head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Decent carbonation. Smells of bretty funk, mustiness, sour cherries, tiny bit of mango, peaches, good amount of lemon, white grape, a tiny bit of sweet breadiness. Taste starts with the dry hop qualities. Get peaches and mango, as well as a tiny bit of grapefruit. Then gets much more tart in the middle, along with notes of lemon, funk and some oak. The finish brings just a tad bit of sweetness, but is just overtaken by the funkiness from the brett, as well as more peach, mango, grapefruit, almost a white grape flavor, cherry, tropical fruit. You can tell the beer has been sitting in oak barrels for a few years, as the oak is very apparent in the finish. Very tart, puckering, acidic finish that lingers on the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Crisp, slightly creamy, and sticky mouthfeel with a medium body. The dry hopping adds a whole new dimension to the beer. Extremely complex sour for a reasonable price. This is hands down the best beer I’ve had by New Belgium so far."
"O - One of my favorite sours, love the hopped up twist on the style!"
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a small white head that last very long. Smell is citrus, green apples, some hop notes and wild yeast funk. Taste is not super tart. I get some peach, lemon and green apples. Nice funkiness. Hops balance it out nicely. Medium to light body with lighter amount of carbonation. Overall a great beer worth picking up."

"Verdict: A very nice sour ale from New Belgium, one of my favorite's that they make. The hops are a great twist and really bring out the earthy and bretty qualities while not overshadowing the fruit and floral qualities. Cheers to New Belgium, I hope they continue to feature this in the Lips of Faith series."
""
""
""
""
"O - Love the flavors, their quite unique and a bit difficult to explain."
"Overall- Great beer, delicate take on the style. The addition of the hops really mellows it out and reinforces the sublime nature of the beer. Definitely worth a try. I will be grabbing one or two bottles to age- this is too great of a deal to pass up."
"this didn't quite live up to the hype for me. a cool sour, highly prized, and finally scored. it pours a clearish orangey resin color with a good inch or so of just off white foam. the nose on it s quite sweet, and this beer is in fact a sweet and sour package. starts sweet in both taste and nose. mango and peach are obvious, possibly from the hops, possibly from something else. the sour part is the second half, lactic and puckery, but not as intense as it might be. its a good late summer palate, and a much more mild type of sour than I was expecting, and certainly when compared to la folie. bright fruit and sour go well together, but I found this a touch too sweet. it hurt my teeth and left my mouth feeling strange, like eating too many sour patch kids. dry as dry champagne too. the carbonation is nice though, and the body is right on medium. I am glad I had some friends to share this with, a whole bomber would have been too much."
"O - This is first year that I have had the chance to try this beer. I am slowly becoming a fan of New Belgium's sours. They are far more talented in this department than in others. Will seek out again next year. Highly recommended!"

"Overall just an outstanding, interesting wild ale, by far the best I've had from the Lips of Faith series."

Flavor is quite similar, with the grassy finish offering a nice mild touch of hoppy bitterness. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, finally got to try this one and even with all the hype it has generated over the years it definitely surpassed my expectations.

"Bottle: Poured a clear light amber color ale with a nice large foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma of fruity notes of peaches and mango with light tart undertones is quite unique. Taste is quite unique with subtle fruity notes of mango and peaches with very nice fruity ester with some well balanced tart notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. It is a wonder the aroma that was created using hops; this is definitely a beer I will seek again."

"This poured out as a slightly hazy copper orange color with a soapy white head. Very scattered lacing and thin retention. The smell of the beer is earthy, slightly tart, some cherry notes and oak. The taste of the beer is very tart, far more sour than all the other ""sour"" ales that New Belgium makes. There is more cherry in the flavor with some vinegar. The mouthfeel is pretty good, drinkable and light bodied nice carbonation. Overall this beer is good, the hops have faded but the sour notes are what seem to me as their peak. Really nice beer."

"O-A very unique and delicious beer. Perhaps my favorite offering from New Belgium. All of us around the table couldn't believe how the nose misleads you into thinking you're going to get something slightly bitter and IPA-like, only to discover a fabulously tart sour brew is really whats in store."
""

""
""

"Taste has a nice sour tartness up front that's a bit vinegar-like, it's not overpowering though because of the barrel aging, the barrel imparts some subtle nuances of wood and a hint of funk, any hoppy character has mostly fades by now but certainly played at part at some point."

"First, I thought it was little too sour for my taste. after a few sips, it's actually nice!"
""
"This was pretty was pretty nice and I really liked what those American hops brought to this despite the age on the bottle. I can only imagine how much this beer popped when fresh. I’ll definitely be seeking this one out again next times it’s released, as it’s a great example of how well hops can still compliment a sour beer."

""
""

""
"Also, goes great with food--a rarity for me, beerwise. Paired excellently with some pad see ew and Chinese broccoli."
" Overall, I love this beer! It's kind of an advanced sour for beginners? Does that make sense??? I guess what I mean is it is more sour than some of the docile ones out there that people call 'beginner sours', but it isn't over the top, tear the enamel off your teeth sour. The hoppiness makes it approachable to some that may have only tried a sour or two before. I would definately drink this again and again....and again..."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with adequate carbonation to assist this in foaming slightly on the palate, rendering a fairly smooth mouthfeel. Finishes semi-dry, with a bit of stickiness around the lips from residual sugars. Mildly acidic throughout, but particularly noticeable in the close, the throat both enjoys and does not appreciate the mild burning the beer is able to cause."
""
"Pours a deep orange to almost copper color. Not much head from the pour. Smells is full of fruits with some funk. Nice malt backbone as well. Taste is nice. Loads of fruit and sourness up front. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is thin and great carbonation. Overall a decent american sour. I bet this will hold up nicely with time."

"Bomber. Pours straw golden with lacy white head. Aroma is green apple funk, light mint from the dry hopping, bright fruits also from the hops. Taste is sour kick balanced by nice hop presence. Pungent sour but not quite as much as la folie, still a big sip makes the blood rush to your face. By far the best of the lips of faith series and its not close. Wish they would make this again but heard from Kim that they wont."

"O: The dry hopping really added a nice citrus hop undertone to this and I'm glad I was able to still get a little pucker out of it."
""
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. Overall it was a pretty cool beer with some very interesting and unique flavors to it. Very flavorful and pretty enjoyable as well."
"Overall: A pretty approachable, drinkable sour ale. Again, the hops add nice complexity, and the sourness/funk are not taken to the extreme, which I appreciated. Highly recommended!"
"O - good wild ale although it's somewhat two-dimensional... Dry hop aroma and sour... Nothing more"
"Found this beer to be much better and fuller in flavors and aroma when it was fresh. It has definitely mellowed and balanced out a bit but I miss that fruit-forward character it had a few months ago. Still worth seeking out."
"Overall, one of my favorite sours. A huge amount of sourness with some yummy brett."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good steady carbonation. This one packs quite the sour punch but it is still quite drinkable. I think I would've liked it a bit more fresh...don't hang onto this one, drink it now if you have any left as the hops always have made this for me. A great brew overall."
"The CPJ"
"A delicious and highly drinkable apricot sour. I would love to have a keg of this at home."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer from NB."
"Enjoyed at the 1st Annual Brass Hat Brewing Brewfest in Watertown, CT, this little beauty from the bomber shows a somewhat cloudy straw-yellow brown color with a decent frothy white head and very healthy lacing. The aroma impresses you immediately with lemon-bread, skunky yeast and a little sweet bubblegum. I like it and the sour invitation is compelling. The flavor again echoes the lemon sharpness detected by the nose but there's also some peachy vinegar and some vanilla biscuit. Bitter but perfectly drinkable for the style. It's medium-light bodied with lively carbonation and a light, crisp feel. Once again, this Lips of Faith series is really translating the Belgian ideas into accessible American lingo that I thoroughly enjoy. While it's a little different from the couple of European leaders I have sampled, it stands well with them in my mind. Enjoy this if you find it!"
"O- its a unique beer that was pretty good."
"O: Overall, I think this is a great beer. Good sipping beer that is mellow enough to enjoy casually but with enough flavor to want another. Definately a beer I would get again."
"Overall, this isn't really what I'd expect when drinking a sour; sort of reminds me of a combination of a not-too-sour cider and champagne. Not the best sour I've had, but easily the most easily drinkable...a bad combination when it's sitting at 7.5%."
"O: This is an incredible beer. Even if sours aren't your thing, Le Terroir is worth trying, and it could be what gets you into them. I can't think of anything really wrong with this beer, other than it's done for the year and I have to wait a while for more of it. Easily the best thing I've had from the Lips of Faith series and definitely rivals the best American Wild Ales."
"Light bodied with a really gentle and soft carbonation that is nearly perfect from a wild ale. A relatively high abv is well hidden, maybe contributing slightly to an over ripe fruit taste at the back of the throat. Would have liked just a little more acidity, but there are so many excellent flavors going on here that this is still worth trying at least once."
"O - I enjoyed this one, wasn't as sour as I was expecting, but overall was a good pick up. Quite refreshing."
"O- this is a fantastic, unique sour. I love it"
"O: It is overall a really nice well done wild sour. It's super drinkable. It's lighter than their La Folie, making it more of an everyday beer. I'm loving this one, and will be very sad when this keg kicks."
"D - I'm on a sour beer kick and I'm not at all disappointed in this one. This probably isn't a brew for everybody, but if you enjoy something a little differentr every now and again you'll probably appreciate this one. I know I did."
"Overall: This is right up there with Temptation and Supplication for me. The added aromatics and dryness from the dry-hopping set this apart from the rest of the sours out there, and definitely the rest of the Lips of Faith beers. Truly excellent."
"Overall: Not all that intense of a wild ale so there is a bit of drinkability just not for me"
"Light, assertive carbonation,but not enough to squash the lovely flavor emanating from those Brett bugs. Fantastic."
"D-probably ordering another after this, but 3 would be too much, so pretty drinkable as wild beers go."
"shared this with some friends. my first dry-hopped sour and i loved it. big citrus aromas and flavors of grapefruit and oranges to go along with a lot of tartness but not too much that it overwhelmed the hops. mouthfeel was lively. a really great beer."
"overall -- Great sour, probably the best of the lips of faith sours, and something i plan on getting often"
"Damn French and its crazy pronunciations... Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly murky golden amber topped by a finger or so of kinda fluffy white sea foam. The nose comprises lemon peel, orange rind, lime, pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, sour watermelon, currants, and a touch of peach. It's a tart, fruity wonderland in my nose. I believe there's also a hint of mild mint and pine in there too. The taste is pretty similar, but with the sourness pumped up significantly. It's not necessarily mouth-puckering but it's more than palpable, lemme tell ya. Still dominated by fruit, though a bit of hoppy goodness does make it through the produce stand and onto my 'buds. Unfortunately, it's not as easy to pick out the individual fruits now. Still pretty tasty, though. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, good times all-around here. Thankfully this is one relatively readily-available sour that does not disappoint."
"Overall: This was one of the funkier sours I’ve had to date. I enjoyed it and as I was told when I first traded for some sours, they are addicting, damn it he was right!"
"Very solid sour."
"Overall- Another nice sour from New Belgium, they seem to have this down pat! The Amarillo addition adds a nice extra dimension of citrus, creating a great balance of sweet and sour, juicy and dry. One of the more affordable sours out there too!"
"I don't think it would be unfair to say of New Belgium that they are still tinkerers, rather than trained engineers, when it comes to wild ales and barrel-aging. But it must be said that Le Terroir is a masterpiece that doesn't just approach the best American sour beers, it actually surpasses many of them. A beer like this is worth paying whatever the asking price for."
"O- This is a fantastic beer, and my favorite New Belgium offering to date. I prefer it to both La Folie and Eric's Ale, which would be 2 and 3 in some order of NB offerings that I've had. Funny how a brewery that seems to be known as the 'Fat Tire guys' puts out such amazing sours (albeit with a few missess....*cough Vrieinden cough*). I don't know if there are plans to brew/bottle this in the future, but it'd be a damn shame if there weren't."
"O: Such a nice, complex sour with a bit of a hoppy kick; one of my 3 favorites from New Belgium--nice stuff!"
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. The complexity, balance, price point, and availability make this beer tops."
"On tap at Burger. in Santa Cruz. POurs an opaque tangerine bronze color with a sticky white head. Aroma is lemons and unripe berries, blackberries in particular come to mind, seedy and tart. Flavor is acidic unripe fruits, citrus and berries, something subtly herbal, lemonhead candy, slight honey malts in the finish, very dry and tart. Palate is very nice but I'm somewhat underwhelmed by the depth of flavor. Reminds me a lot of unsweetened lemonade. Still a good beer."
"O: Can't wait to have it again and again. Includes a great sour taste along with some hop taste in there also."
"O-well this is one of the most sour sours i've had. it comes in with great appreciation. the flavors are unique and tasty. i'll be craving this one for awhile. please seek this out!"
"3/3/2011"
"Heck of a beer. I'm immediately hit with a tangerine and clementine - big fruit citrus with even the peel and seeds in there. Seriously, it's like fresh fruit. There's there's a peppery-lime tang with a balanced (not too big, not too small) sour hit. This is a juicy beer, but not too thick and on the drinkable side of sours."
"A very nice beer, if not that sour or puckering. Too bad it is too expensive."
"A really, solid Wild Ale. I love the balance combined with the intensity. Great."
"D> Light body and carbonation is spot on! This beer almost numbs the lips. The sourness goes great with the bitterness in the end. It almost locked my jam the first time i had it but im glad to say i have had alot more and its a great summer sour beer!"
"Definately very clean for a sour ale, without those earthy yeasty tones, but the brightness and intensely tropical vibe make this so nice on a hot summer day. The flavors in this are simply out of this world."
"A fantastic American Wild at a decent price. New Belgium hit a home run with this one."
"O: an excellent sour beer where the mixture of hops and acids intertwine seamlessly."
"O (D) - A palatable sour beer for sure. Not that well balanced or complex, but nice flavors."
"O - I'm really impressed with this. Nice sour and fruit flavors, some nuance."
"O - Really enjoyed this one. The hop bitterness mixed in with the really sharp tartness is an interesting combonation."
"D: A super sour brew. Needs a bit more complexity for me, maybe some sweeter flavors of vanilla."
"Lips Of Faith Le Terroir was golden orange in color and hazy. It had an off-white head with decent retention and a little lacing. The smell was quite interesting with sourness and citric hops. The taste was tart with grapefruit flavors (sort of like a tropical fruit sweet-tart). It finished dry with some sourness on the tongue. It was medium light in body with mild carbonation. Overall this is a very interesting and refreshing beer. This beer is definitely worth a try."
"Didn't know what to expect. Nice sour ale taste, the dry hopping adds a slight degree of hopiness. More than anything the hops dilutes the sour ale profile."
"I am all about this beer. The dry-hopping adds an earthiness that plays nicely of the funk of the yeast. A very drinkable, interesting sour."
"Every sip is like the most perfect concerto of flavors rewarding your senses and leaves you wanting more. Every time I get one of these on draught I share with whoever is around and almost every time they are floored. If you can't tell by this review yet, I am a big fan."
"Overall, this was a solid brew from NG. Very drinkable and one of their better sours. I could definitely drink a lot of this."
"Cheers!"
"This is a great sour, besides some work on the mouth feel, no qualms. I would not want to kill a whole bottle of this as I would be scortched mid way palate wise. I would drink these up and stock one or two for some cellaring."
"O- this is a great american wild ale and the bold dry hopping is killer. I really wish new belgium would come to philly where the beer flows like water."
"All in all, a good Wild Ale, with the issue of not being dry enough IMHO. A little dryer and the drinkability would go up. Could also use a little more funk, but like I said, maybe I'd get more of that in the bottle."
"Drinkability- wow this is a sour bomb but overall I would seek it out again."
"O: The beer is quite easy to drink for the style because it’s not too sour."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This is an interesting beer and I think the dry-hopping really adds a lot to this beer. I'm not sure of the age on this, but I don't think this has been released for a while, but even still, the hops still add a good amount of nose and flavor to this. The tartness makes it a slow-drinker, but the sustained mouthfeel and unique finish keep this one in my hand."
"Overall, among the best sours I've consumed. Highly drinkable, very smooth, fruity, tart, well-balanced, with the citrus dovetailing perfectly with the dried-hops. For all that, however, I could probably only consume two per sitting, as the combination of hops and funk appears to knock the taste buds out cold. Who would've thunk it?"
"O - Very nice; this is one of the best Lips of Faith brews, if not the best, that I've had."
"O: Hard to say this is very drinkable because of the tartness, but it's damn tasty. I wish I had purchased a couple more of these before they sold out everywhere. This is a really nice beer and welcome in what is otherwise a sour/wild poor market(Nashville)."
"O - This one left me longing for more."
"O: This beer exceeded my already slightly inflated expectations. Good beer. Glad I have three more to sit on. Yum!"
"D: Want more, please."
"Overall I had to have this beer again after being a big fan of it from the bottle, and it didn’t disappoint. The slight age does temper the the hops a bit, I'd be interested to see how this tastes in a year or two, although I can't imagine it getting better. Well worth a shot however you find it."
"The beer is a hazy amber color with a thin coaster of white foam atop it. The aroma is lemon zest and light funk. Taste features big citrus notes, bitter hops and acetic tartness. Starts out sweet and fruity followed by a very nice hoppy bitterness and a sour, tart finish. Feel tends toward the lighter side with a nice level of carbonation. Overall I found this to be a very enjoyable offering from New Belgium. Light, refreshing and very easy drinking."
" Kudos."
"4/4/4/4.5/4.5"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the brew pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is fruity and sour, it smells like tart apples, apricots, peaches, lemons, and some vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but I notice some white grape and a bit of pine/citrus hop flavors, too. The sourness isn't overpowering but you definitely can tell it's a mostly sour brew. I know it's a dry hopped brew, but I pick up more sourness than hops in both the aroma and taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and also dry. I think this is a pretty good overall beer, I'll definitely buy this again the next time I find it."
"New Belgium does most of their beers well, but they really seem to excel at sour ales. I'm wowed every time I try a new one, and each has it's own distinct character. This one is almost...""clean"" for a wild ale."
"Overall-Awesome beer, only reason why this isn't an A+ is because it's my first Sour and need to leave room for improvement. I will be buying this beer often. Unbelievable achievements with this beer. I could probably only drink one bottle, but wow, this is a treat."
"O: A great sour. Polished off a whole bomber by myself, which I usually can't do with most sours. I think the lack of gut-rotting yeast was what allowed me to enjoy this brew all the way to the bottom. At 7.5% this one will sneak up on you because it's so drinkable."
"The body feels a bit thicker than I'd prefer. The problem is that it is underattenuated; the light carbonation makes this beer take on some unnecessary weight. Overall, this is one of the best beers from New Belgium that I've had. It's pretty unique and really tasty. If you like peaches then you should love this beer. Definitely pick one up if you see it."
"For a long time this has been one of my favorite sours, this batch is the first time that I have had it out of bottles. Dark Golden appearance with a small lacing that forms on top. My favorite smelling beer, strong smell of hops, a floral earthy hops. Woody smell on the back end but a small amount. With each sip, a sweet floral start is overtaken by a tart earthy lemon. Very tart on the end with a earthy hoppy aftertaste. This one is sharp and dry on the tongue. Light bodied. This is a great beer that is light enough to be very drinkable. Perfect for spring."
"Another success from New Belgium's Lips of Faith series - wonderful for a hot day, so grab it while you can."
"O: I love it. This has everything I've been looking for in a wild. With the perfect balance of funky sour and a balancing earthiness of dry hops, this is high on my trade list already."
"This one is a definite acquired taste which I'm still acquiring."
"O: This is delicious, drinkable, and refreshing. The sweet and sour paired with the citrus and earth is a great combination. I keep coming back to this beer."
"D/O: History tells us that New Belgium is much more adept at harnessing sourness than hops, yet this beer's flavor makes something amazing out of both--and it happens simultaneously. The attraction is found early in the flavor of the cellar-temperature beer; it may taste more like real grapefruit juice than any other beer tasted so far. Unfortunately this beer's pleasant but unremarkable smell is not its lowest point--the burn of acidity builds on the palate over time, becoming uncomfortable. Still, the flavors win out; they are impossible to resist, the resultant burn being a cost worth paying."
"M/D: Light bodied, fresh and effervescent - drinks crisp and finishes clean with a noticeable bitterness from the hop. Extremely drinkable, especially for this time of year - great summertime/springtime drinker."
"The beer is orange in color with a slight haze. The head is about a half inch thick, and leaves a fair amount of lacing behind. The aroma is complex and inviting, with scents of oak, apples, white wine, and a subtle funky tartness. The flavor is well balanced and pleasant, with a nice grape juice / white wine character. The finish brings a nice puckering sensation, with a lasting flavor of sour apples. Overall, I really enjoyed this, and would happily have it again."
"O: very solid sour from NB! The combo with the dry hopping/sour was amazing! Worked out excellent!!"
"O- This was a nice drinker overall. The sourness to this beer was never over the top and the ABV was never really a problem while drinking. I think this was left in the barrel for the perfect amount of time. Nice job New Belgium on making yet another great tasting sour."
"Pour is a little darker that I expected with little head retention though overall it still looks appealing with a cloudy pine sap color. The dry hoping is notable but not dominant, surprisingly it mixes well with the mild acetone tartness. There is also a little mustiness and a tropical fruit profile in the aroma, any concern about a mediocre NB commercial sour has been put aside now, I can tell this will be enjoyable. The flavor is soft amalgamation of peach, apricot, grain, lemon zest, and grass with none of those flavors coming through more than any other. This beer is more tart than sour but as a sour lover this easily scratches my itch for sour beer. Also the acetone detected in the aroma is not nearly as prevalent in the flavor as it was in the aroma, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is moderate, could stand to be lighter but thats nitpicking abit. As far as drinkability goes this reminds me of a Berliner Weiss in that it is flavorful and refreshing without being overbearing or cloying, very satisfying. I would buy this if it were available to me locally. Recommended."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Little patches of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of spicy hops, apricot/peach, mango, and slight funk/must. Taste is of fermented peach/mango, vinegar, funk/must, with the spicy hop flavors coming through on the finish. There is a sour and spicy feel on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. A bit sticky in the mouth. Overall, this is a really awesome wild ale and one of the best Lips Of Faith beers. I only bought one because I wasn't too sure how a dry-hopped wild would pan out but I am going to stock up on these for sure."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. This American Wild Ale pours a cloudy orange golden color. The head is white, retention is below average and lacing is also below average. The aroma was almost tropical and slightly sour. The taste of the beer is very tart and is very acidic. The finish is slightly sweet. The fruit profile is very complex, i can barely register it all- I taste grapefruit, tangerine, sour cherry, raspberry and pineapple. It almost seemed with every sip, I would detect something else. I am a relative newcomer to sour beers so with out much to compare this too, I really like this. The body of the sour was medium, the carbonation was very nice and it is very drinkable. Very Very Very Berry good Beer!"
"O: Was excited to try this and was disappointed. Too sour and too much vinegar for me."
"O - Great introduction to the sours. Looking forward to trying more and getting more attuned with this great beer style."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: A bit over light bodied with a reasonably high level of carbonation. A bit spritzy, and about right for the style. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. The strong citrus notes are very much at odds yet really compliment the sourness and funk well."
"Overall: A very refreshing wild. I thought the beer could have used a little more body and maybe a little more on the nose."
"Served from bottle into a Bell's tulip. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. The hop character on this one really makes its presence known. Really adds a very nice additional character to the sour and tart backbone going on in this one. A definite must try without a doubt!"
"I can't get enough of this stuff. If you get the opportunity to try this, prepare to get yo jaw dropped."
"Overall, this beer was a nice mix between a highly hopped beer and one that is supremely sour. I've not had a lot of sours, but to me the hops really made this one stick out."
"O: Great beer, fruity deliciousness, tart sour fruit, tropical hops, blended well, drinkable and delicious."
"D - Interested if the heavy fruit comes from the dry hopping or Brett C strain. Very good."
"This was definitely an interesting and complex beer; very refreshing for a warm evening drinking on the porch or in the back yard."
"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is funky lemons and oranges, pineapple, papaya and some tartness. I get a ton of tropical fruit flavors in addition to the expected tartness/sourness. The flavor is heavy on the sour oranges, but I also get a lot of the other tropical fruit that I got in the aroma. The beer is juicy tasting, but very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice sour beer."
"Pours a cloudy peach color with a thin white head and a bit of lacing. The nose contains strawberry seeds, hints of cherry, and a sour lactic presence. Mild earthiness there as well. The flavor has a bit of strawberry and cherry, which are followed up by a mild sourness and a slight amount of funk. Don't really smell or taste any of the dry hopping here. Light fruit throughout and in the finish, going along with some mild sourness. Pretty good; interested to see how this one ages out."
"O: Probably a great sour for people that are into this style. I ranked it based on the quality of the beer, which I believe is good. My palette just wasn't ready for it."
"Conclusion: This is a great American wild. Not traditional, but a version of this wide style that works very well if you love both hops and sours. I applaud its excellent aroma and balance of flavors. The best beer I have tried from New Belgium to date."
"O - quite an experience, i wouldn't mind having more or seeing what some age will do. Interested to try more of the style."
"Perhaps some Noble hops might work for me, but for this I feel that I'm a victim of an experiment gone awry."
"Cheers!"
"Overall I was pleased with my first sour. I was told that this was a great starter sour and a very good beer and I couldn't agree more"
"Taste is citric, tart-sour fruits, some sweetness, light earthy yeastiness, hint of grass, with vinegary lemon and crackers really dominating the finish and aftertaste."
"The Lips of Faith series is wildly inconsistant, but offerings like this keep me eagerly awaiting the next one."
"Drink- Great craft intro sour. This was balanced, tart, crisp, aciditic and dry all at the same time but it all worked. I would like to have this one again."
"D: Le Terroir is an engaging and uniquely American take on the sour ale style. The citrus of the hops work wonderfully with the sour and acidic taste. A fun and interesting beer to drink on a pleasant spring evening."
"Super refreshing/tart wild that really ramps up the sourness/tartness the warmer it gets"
"overall/drinkability: nice"
"Unique sour something unexpected but enjoyable to the last drop. I've tasted this one on tap at the brewery before and it's markedly more bright and carbonated on tap. Some of the hoppy dynamics have started to fade with age. Still a great offering."
"Overall the beer is unique, but I would rather have a Lost Abbey or Russian River sour in a smaller bottle for more money."
"22oz. bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Poured a light gold with a couple of fingers of white head. Lots of carbonation. Citrus and hops in the aroma along with a slightly vegetal scent like green pepper. Nice tart bite, plenty of tropical fruit. Dry and light bodied. Hops come through in aroma, but not bitterness. Easy drinking. Nice beer, though the aroma dinged my rating a bit."
"This is excellent. One of the most fruit dominate beers I have had. Add the tartness and the complexity of the wood makes for a great beer. Well done New Belgium, and highly recommended."
"This beer is really different because it starts off tart and puckering before being countered by the dry, sweet hop presence which again gives way to a lingering mouth puckering vinegary finish. I've been let down by the Lips of Faith series but this beer is a very interesting take on the style and something that I would like to drink again."
"I'm somewhat new to wild ales, but I tend to like sour things so I enjoyed this one quite a bit. As I explore more, I'll hopefully find out if this is exceedingly tart for style or not."
"The beer presents rather sweet with a strong strong fruit character so much so that it is like drinking pineapple juice with a really dry finish. The bitterness at the back is decent. Eh, not a repeat for me."
"My first review of a sour. appearance is a golden pale with a slight haze mostl likely from the yeast. effervescent for the first couple of minutes then the head dissipates to a thin white ring. no lace at all in my pour. Smells citruisy and earthy, the dry hopping is dominated by an aggresive american hop , my guess would be amarillo, brett is present in the background, but the american hops definetly dominate the aroma in this beer. Fresh squeezed lemonade is what comes to mind at first, but the bittery bite of an ipa is present on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth and light. thiis a refreshing beer i've had this both on draft and in bottles within a couple of weeks of each other. and the draft version has less tartness, and you get more of the belgian funk, brett, horseblanket character. This bottled version kept more of the hoppy character to this beer, more like a sour IPA in my opinion."
"Had this one on tap at the Rackhouse in Denver tonight. Poured a slightly hazy golden color with a nice rocky white head. Nice tart aromas, with lemon, vinegar and wood. Light bodied, refreshing and tart, with flavors of lemon rind, vinegar and grapefruit."
"In the end, this is a unique beer, for sure, and I can't wait to try the next offering from New Belgium."
"O: I'm pretty sure I've eaten this flavor in ice cream form, when it came in some orange and green color. There's a huge candy-like component. I feel the dry-hopping added some aromatic complexity to what would have been an otherwise one-dimensionally citrus sour, albeit a tasty one. This isn't the best sour, but it's certainly one I'd order again and one I'd love to attempt to brew."
"Pours a hazy light toffee color, nose is full of sweet green apple fruit and bretty straw/hay. On the palate this makes itself known with good acidity, but it's balanced with a lovely ciderlike sweetness. This tastes fantastic, an almost perfectly balanced sour that leaves your palate with the impression of sweet apple fruit but stays fresh and acidic enough to keep you coming back for more. There's only a hint of acetic/vinegar character. This is a knockout sour from New Belgium. Not as impressively powerful as La Folie but perhaps their best balanced offering to date."
"(D)- A solid to great wild ale. A great acidity, while not being over-the-top in your face sour. A good fruit profile too. An easy drinker as well; great for how nice it is becoming outside!"
"I know that this beer has torn apart families, but I like it well enough. It's not the most complex sour you'll find in today's market, but it's imminently drinkable and it's just different enough to interest the palate. Plus, Amarillo hops are among my favorite."
"Golden with a slight haze, fluffy white head that can only be reanimated as a film, and lots of carbonation. Sour apples and cherries aroma with a hint of oak. A balance of mostly sour, but some sweet from front to middle. Mild bitter finish. A good amount of carbonation and light body. Flavor is similar to the aroma, lots of sour fruit, but with enough sugar to create an interesting balance. Every now and then the fruit esters give a paint thinner like sensation. Think La Folie dialed back a notch or two."
"O: Great tasting sour that really showcases the hops in the both the smell and taste. I'll be buying more of this for sure, solid all around and costs significantly less per ounce than most sours around."
"Light bodied with soft carbonation, and a vinegar forward aftertaste. Not a bad effort, but not as good as the best sours. I am glad I had a chance to try this though."
"Overall, this is a great sour, but be prepared for the big sour blast on the palate, because if you are, you're rewarded with a complex and very drinkable beer. Big fan of this one."
"The taste! Oh man, this is a delicious beer. Very acidic, similar to la folie, but not nearly as puckering. Strong lemon presence...like sucking on a lemon. :/ Very dry finish and extremely easy to drink. As it warms up, the hops become more apparent and the ac idity is a bit more muted. This is a wonderful beer, and a really good value for this style. I will be buying this regularly."
"Yellow not to carbonated light tangy. Like a pear jelly belly. Can taste the spicy hops in the nose at first sip. Pretty wild! little bit of lemon zest at first reminded me of apricot and lemon hybrid. Malty after taste, very tasty. A little bit of dry to it making you want more, well done! Similar to la follie maybe yeast but of course 2 different styles plus the hops make it completely different if that makes sense... Wonder how an IPA sour would do?"
"Opinion: Well, about all I can say is WOW! This beer is a trip!...literally! It is undoubtedly one of the most unusual beers I have tried in some time. It practically defines a style as nothing exactly like this exists that I know of. I would say that if you are a fan of sour/wild ales like I am, you absolutely HAVE to give this a shot. It is so different I think that you will be pleased. If you are expecting an IPA with a bit of funk, this beer isn't for you. It is complex and well blended with the hops participating in the whole ensemble rather than dominating it."
"O: not what I was expecting but surely it was enjoyable. Will look forward to having again."
"(22oz bottle). Pours hazy apricot color with chunky off-white head. Aroma has lots of citrus, ripe summer fruits, and funk along with some florals. Wow, this is quite acidic/vinegar-like and I didn't expect that. Medium bodied with a dry finish. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the sour fruitiness is very refreshing. I like this quite a bit."
"A lovely sour, one of my favorites. Like a summer field in a glass."
"edit: had another. on second thought, I wouldn't change much. The hops had started to fade, but the beer overall is quite tasty. Upped the score some."
"D - Solid sour here. As I am just getting into this style this will set the bar pretty high. Given the price point, this seems to be a very affordable wild ale. I'll have to go out and grab another."
"Pours a dark golden orange, slightly hazy, with a thin white head. Smells acetic and lactic, with some late creaminess. No funk at all, just tart and sour and cream. The taste is mostly similar, but with the addition of some earthy hops at the end. Pretty tasty, but honestly it would probably be at least as good if not better without the dry hopping. The spicy hops distract a little from the sour flavors. Not the most aggressive sour in the world, not the most complex, but it's a fairly easy entrance for the non-sour drinker into the world of sours."
"seeing as the dry hopping was far more subtle, this was almost different. tasted more like a fresh Eric's Ale. very good in its own way."
"Overall: Tasty, tropical, refreshing, and a nice compliment to a warm Sunday afternoon. An interesting sour. I dug it."
"One of the best and most interesting beers I've tried this year. I'm a big fan of New Belgium, and I'm glad to find an accessible and intriguing sour. Pizza Port in San Diego (Ocean Beach) had this."
"Drinkability: Rather unique among sours, it makes you wonder why other brewers don't experiment with a west coast hop addition to their sour brews"
"D: Very good. Would def recommend and go for another one"
"O- a very drinkable sour which is dry hopped very drinkable very tasty"
"Overall I am quite impressed with this beer, the aromas are wonderful and the hops play nice with the sourness. I will be having this again."
"D/O: Wow, a very drinkable sour... tart, but refreshing; the amarillo dry hop is great as I think it gives this beer a touch of sweetness; definitely one of the more drinkable sours I've had and a likely candidate for any sourhead's fix."
"As with all of the Lips of Faith series this is an interesting and challenging offering (in a good way!)"
"O: I found this to be a very interesting take on the American wild ale. Sour enough to earn the label and the American hop varieties bring a new element into play. It would be interesting to see how this beer ages as the hops fade and the funk grows. Cheers to New Belgium. This beer alone makes me wish they distributed to NYC!"
"Tart and dry. Very interesting to say the least. Worth trying for sure."
"One finger slightly rocky white head, medium dissipation with significant lacing. Multiple streams of rising carbonation quite a bit of which clung to side of glass, orangish amber clear body. Nose features a fairly significant hoppiness due to dry hop, citrusy, which compliments the sourish aroma. Taste mirrors the nose, more sour re vinegar than tart, big dose of citrus re meyer lemon on the back end but balanced by a Jolly Rancher sour apple (!), sweetish pears, dryish malt profile, damn funky. Mouthfeel is medium very good effervescence, not sticky. This was my buddy's first 'sour' and he was certainly intrigued. I liked the citrusy hoppiness of this which aided in drinkability and approachability. This was a very pleasant surprise, I wish I'd have grabbed more bottles, though I suspect the hoppiness won't hold up to prolonged cellaring. Another winner in the Lips of Faith series. A must try for the adventurous palates. One of the better beers I've had so far this year."
"I like this beer. I like the sour flavors, and I like the citrus hops in the nose. But I want more from the flavor than the initial punch of sour. Just not as complex as I was hoping."
"D-Very high drinkability and a very interesting beer. I was worried the dry-hopping would overpower the sour aspects, but its very nicely balanced."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"O: I'm on the hunt for some more of this, I like Wild Ales and I love IPAs, and this is the best of both worlds. It safe to say this is presently my favorite Wild Ale I've ever had."
"NB's best beer? It might be. If not, it's at least on par with Eric's and La Folie."
"Didn't quite know what to expect from this, but very pleasantly surprised. Yet another one-timer that I wish I could have again. Will need to check whether any of the local stores still have some on the shelves. Delicious."
"O - Great pick up. This is a nice wild ale example and well done with the hops. A true American wild ale at that. (4.0)"
"O: Great beer! An extremely unique drink fresh and still a solid sour when the tropical dry-hopping fades. Definitely worth the $7 a bomber I paid. 4.5/5"
"Overall a great beer, possibly the best American Wild Ale when considering price ($8.89 for 22 oz)"
"draft at Falling Rock, Denver"
"Pours an apple juice hue. looks pretty carbonated. half-finger white head, looks like it's not going to stick around after a minute or two. A little hazy, but mostly clear. Decent hop aroma, sweet, a little tropical fruit and a little sour bite from the yeast. Very juicy, sour bite. Juicy hopped finish which eases the sour flavors in the start. It's not bitter at all. The dry hopping definitely helps this beer and provides something unique. I'd be curious if they chose to make this beer again and give that fruit-juicy hop flavor more presence, it could be a pretty good upgrade. However. I'm definitely enjoying this as it stands."
"O: This is probably the best of all of the New Belgium wild ales I've had and definitely unique among wild ales in general. I was worried that the dry hopping would create a weird IPA/wild ale hybrid that didn't seem at all appealing, but the wild ale characteristics definitely stand out most prominently with the hops hanging in the background and integrating themselves in very well."
"o-a very good sour...far superior to last years la folie....but not on par with erics ale....quite pleased with it...will go back for more.."
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this. Only just recently started getting into sours, and I loved this one. Make sure you pick up a bottle. Or two!"
"Ahhh...The joy of finding a new excellent beer. A darker amber pour than expected yields a short lived white head, with sparse lacing. The smell is straight up IPA territory, but the taste, ah, a beautiful tropical laced sour with a comforting acidity. Mouthfeel is smooth, coating, and acidic. No carbonation evident despite the pleasing head. I would never have thought this combination of IPA and sour to be as comforting and pleasurable as it is. A transition beer from an IPA tasting into a sour tasting? I never would have thought of it, yet here is is. Affordable, wonderfully tart, and at the same time, a resiny grapefruit kiss. This has entered into regular rotation for me. Exceptionally well done."
"Overall: This sour is pretty solid -- very robust, citric and funky smells and flavors really meet what I feel is intended with this one. The ABV isn't overly high, but the acidity would likely catch up after a while -- one 22 oz. bottle is just about perfect. An excellent and refreshing beer."
"Only $8 for a bomber of an undeniable soured beer, much less the barrel and dry hopping. Probably suffers a little rating wise bc its from NB, but I'm telling you, this can hang with Russian River's Temptation or Sanctification any day. I might even like it more. I've had 2 of these now, about 10 more to go. We'll see."
"If you like Sour, this beer will be your thing. But it's not mine."
"Fantastic! If you like big juicy hop aromas and beautifully balanced sour ales do yourself a favor and seek this out."
"This is tasty stuff. Light bodied, but with persistent, sour, yeasty flavor, ends on a light note. Starts strong, ends soft, stays pleasantly weird and wonderful."
"Notes: Really nice sour and at a pretty good price point for a sour. Nice balance and the hops really add a nice subtle something. Barrel aging adds another subtle aspect. Great fruity flavors and tartness. Well done sour."
"Pretty good, and definitely unique, but I'm not sure these specific hops did it for me. I think there's potential in a dry-hopped sour, but the catty hop tones were a little off-putting, especially in the flavor. On the whole, I liked it, and I'm definitely glad I tried it."
"O: I have no idea where all those high scores came from. This stuff is nowhere near a solid wild ale. I had high hopes. Sadly my hopes were dashed."
"D - This is a very nice wild ale. I'm glad it finally made it into my hands/beer glass!"
"Interesting to say the least for this sour noob. I really like the aroma in particular and the flavor is quite good, just need to get used to puckering tartness in a beer. At the very least this has me intrigued to try other Sours and Wilds."
"The drink is incredibly interesting. I'm glad I bought it, and glad to have another one. As I suspect is normal for the style, I wouldn't wanna drink a whole bomber alone, much less take two! Great beer to share, certainly, and a good experience!"
"O - The sour finish is very good but the food aroma is pretty terrifying. The flavor pulls the overall up a lot more but it's just an ok beer. At first experience I really wouldn't get it again, but seeing so many positive reviews coming off this one, I'd love to nab another bottle and see what the deal with this one was."
"O: Again: SURPRISINGLY tasty."
"This is a very well made beer; a really nice sour right now and one that should be tried fresh and enjoyed before we all jump to age it. It will likely age well but perhaps lose some of that wonderful tangerine/orange/apricot fruit character. One of my favorites of the Lips of Faith Series. I really like this one."
"Nice bubbly mouthfeel. Really enjoyed it."
"My advice: Ignore the bad reviews and give it a try. This is a fantastic sour, and it may just be an acquired taste for some."
"Overall it smells nasty but it tastes pretty good though it is nowhere close to being one of the best sour ales I have had."
"Overall, not bad, but not very good either. The schizophrenic taste is a big detractor, but if you want something kinda sour, this is a relatively cheap choice."
"Make more so that I can get this in bottles on a consistent basis!"
"D - Quite difficult to finish my glass. I have had great sours before and to me this is borderline undrinkable. The initial taste is fine, the second it goes down your throat, the terrible flavors come out."
"D= Awesome! This and the Eric's ale have been some of the best sours I've ever had. This is an excellent brew for sure. Worth seeking out and trying. I plan to buy a few more."
"D: With so much sourness and funk to this beer, it's not extremely drinkable, but makes a great sipper. Overall, one of the best and most unique wild ales I've had."
"Mouth feel is nice as it should be: lots of carbonated bite. This is really an easy beer to drink. Usually I am not as crazy about these, but I like this one."
"For the value, this can't be beat - pick up a couple of bottles when you see it, as you'll wish you had more."
"I hope I can find more of this."
"D - A summer sour for sure, decently drinkable. Solid but not the best out there. I would pick up another bottle for sure."
"Pours a hazy, orange color with a medium white head. Scent is very interesting. I get a lot of lemongrass with some apricot and sour apples and a bit of citrus. I also get some very funky aromas along with pickle juice...yes, pickle juice. And I happen to love me some sour, dill pickles. Taste is just as interesting and different. Unlike any sour I've ever had. There are lovely fruit flavors (peach, apricot, green apple, grapefruit) with hints of hoppiness and funky cheese. I also get lemongrass and leather. Very tasty. Sour, but not overly sour whatsoever. Mouthfeel is very refreshing and acidic. Drinkability is high. New Belgium has really impressed me with some of the latest Lips of Faith releases. This and La Folie are a couple of my favorites."
"Medium body with light carbonation but it works. I had about 2/3 of the bottle and could have easily had more. Hoping to find several more bottles of this to hold onto for awhile and see how it develops."
"This beer was room temp and poured a cloudy, dirty tangerine orange in color with a slight off white head. The aromas punch you right in the nose. It was a mix of oranges, grapefruit, lemon, freshly cut apples, grass, and sour APRICOTS. Oh man this beer smells delicious! It didn't have the stomach acid aromas that some wilds get. I'm already really impressed, especially considering all of New Belgium's other wilds have let me down. The flavor is heavy on the sour apricot which I absolutely love. If I tried this ""blind"" I could mistake it for an Apricot lambic or even a geueze. In fact, it is very, very close to Hanssens geueze. It drinks smoothly and leaves a nice level of fruity tartness on the palate. As wilds go, this is very, very drinkable. Trying it at room temp was a good idea. I came in pessimistic but was really impressed by this beer. I kind of wish I would've snagged another while in Chicago. Hopefully it'll make it to Indiana soon."
"A dry-hopped sour. Who woulda thought? Different for sure. I was pleasantly surprised."
"The flavor is a delightful blend of wooden tartness from the barrels mixed with a bursting hop profile of citrus and pine. Sour and hoppy, with a finish of prickly, green apple bubbles and somewhat oddly-flavored melon rind. Mouthfeel is frothy and medium in body with a juicy, yet drying end. I can't quite put my finger on the essence of Le Terroir, but I can tell you right now: it's delicious. Complexity is off the charts, and this beer goes down far too quickly for only 7.5% ABV. New Belgium hit another Wild Ale home-run with this beer."
"D: Pretty easy to drink. This is an interesting beer. It's taken me over half the bottle but it just hit me that this reminds me a little bit of Cantillon Iris. Not nearly as good as Iris, but similar."
"D: medium plus"
"The beer is a hazy, orange, copper color with a thin, white bubbly head. You can smell a lot of acidity, some peachy aroma from the amarillo hops and I detected some tart apple and tangerine as well. When you take a sip there is lots of sourness on the tongue, taste consists of green apples, orange and white grapes, tart flavors pucker the sides of the mouth. This beer has low carbonation, it's medium bodied and bites at the tongue leaving a dry, sour mouth. I thought this was a wonderful brew, it's the first sour beer I've had and I look forward to having many more."
"Overall impression: Nice little wild ale here. Recommended."
"Pours a solid orange color with a huge white head after a sturdy pour into a Captain Lawrence tulip glass. Maybe it was too hard of a pour as it seems like there's no carbonation bubbles coming up, but no big deal. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is very interesting. Light funk, lots of herbal/grassy hops, some bandaid/medicinal action with a touch of light citrus and fruit. Can definitely tell this one has been dry-hopped. This is isn't super sour or tart, but there's plenty there, loads of citrus, lemon, orange, and just a bit of funky/leathery musty goodness on the finish. Firm hoppiness to it, earthy herbal bitterness, flowery, perfumey. Very interesting. Finding it hard to describe the flavors, but overall has some floral, sweet, and citric characters, and all blends together well. Carbonation is good despite the look, medium bodied. This is a very interesting beer and very delicious as well. I love what the dry-hopping has done for the balance to the sour and sweet components. Good stuff."
"Haven't had too many sours but this beer was solid. Good showing of tartness with some balance and good flavors. Definitely having this again."
"Orangish brew with a fizzy white head. Hops come out immediately, champagne-covered oranges and grapefruit oils in the nose, this is smack-dab in IPA territory. Some sour notes, but more winey than most sours. Taste is outstanding, this is basically a sour IPA. Lots of bitter hops going head-to-head with mouth-puckering vinegar and sour notes. One of the most intriguing and innovative brews I have ever had. Hats off to New Belgium."
"Drinkability - VERY easy to drink. The combination of the hops and sour makes the beer just a joy to drink. And as mentioned earlier, I have no idea why this is so much cheaper than the other sours from NB seeing as this is aged for 2 years (I'm not sure about the process for the others so that may be why the price is increased - will look into this). I am buying more of these ASAP. Freaking great."
"I could drink this for a while and the 7.5% is not noticeable in the slightest. Very happy I found some of this. A very well executed American Wild."
"Best American Sour I have had to date. This beer gave the lie to the unpalatable anticipation you should associate with the flavor profiles involved: goaty, barnyardy, funky....this brewery has not ever been one i held in high esteem until eric salazar put this beast of complexity out. highly recommended."
"Overall really excellent. Similar in chacter to La Folie but much milder and easier to enjoy a full serving. Much enjoyed."
"D: Perceived alcohol is much below actual ABV. Refreshing and enjoyable to drink, definitely something different."
"D - Really easy to drink. A nice sour, refreshing drink. I bought a few of these hoping to cellar them, but I curious how the dry hopping will be affected if I let it age...but damn fine brew and a treat to drink anytime."
"D: Very drinkable. This I not an extremely sour wild ale, but it is complex and a pleasure to drink."
"Bottle. Poured into a New Belgium tulip glass, how appropriate! Pours an ever so slightly hazed copper straw color with a a finger off white head. Hops in the nose right off the bat of a more fruitful note, with grapefruit and some tropical aromas. Behind all that is a medium level of sourness with lemon like notes. Medium/light mouthfeel. Decent sourness and sweetness in the upfront, some mustiness as well, with an ending lingering bitterness from the hops. As it warms, an earthy/oaky flavor makes itself known. For the price, this is a solid brew. The lingering bitterness is interesting. The 7.5 abv is not noticeable at all. No real lace."
"D - By far my favorite lips of faith, good sours are hard to come by down here in Texas, and this one is a breath of fresh air."
"This is interesting and tastes good enough to totally crush. I'd have again."
"Pours a crisp, glowing golden-orange with a thin off-white head. Smells tart and lemony, with an ample amount of hops thrown in. Nice wild and funky smells, much more ""funk"" then ""sour"". Taste is similar, nice tart flavors of peaches, lemons, and oak with a good amount of hoppyness. Honestly, this tastes like sour hop juice, and that's meant as a compliment! Crisp, sharp carbonation with a creamy medium mouthfeel. I'll have to be on the lookout for a bottle of this, I'd like to try it again!"
"Edit: after all the other A reviews, thought I would give it another shot... actually lowering my rating... still a very harsh hop-sour clash. Maybe in a few years... but for now, the taste seems very artificial also... very unnatural. Sprite/lemonade is not natural. Tastes like an alcapop..."
"Le Terroir is a unique Wild Ale, fruit-forward and quenching, only moderately tart. Should appeal to a wide audience without losing any street cred."
"D - decently drinkable. I'm not sure that I really like how citrusy this beer is. I look forward to revisiting this sometime in the future when some of the hop presence has died down. That being said I don't mind drinking it now and might buy a few more to drink now and a few more to lay down."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable, the first glass disappeared. Lactic sourness slowed the second glass down a bit. Put some funk in it, put it in a bottle, and cork and cage it please!"
"Enjoyed at the brewery."
"I absolutely love this beer, I hope I can find it again soon, my favorite so far from New Belgian!"
"22oz bottle $8.99 I've had this before on tap and it was much better but this was still good. The bottle notes that it changes every time they brew it so maybe it has a lot of batch to batch variation. Very light orange color and a sour smell that morphs into hops. The taste is very fruity like an odd peach or tropical fruit but still sour. This has A lot less glue qualities (unfortunately) than I remember on tap but it's worth the price tag. Very unique flavors and the hops seem to be the reason."
"Really great sour I could drink all night. Slightly lower than perfect marks for slightly off putting smell."
"D - Really liked this one, glad I was lucky enough to be able to try it. Amongst the top-tier of American Wild Ales I've had."
"drinkability is excellent. vinous, acidic, and funky; just what a good sour should be. the funk is assertive in the nose, but receeds to the background on the palate. very drinkable and solid brew from New Belgium. cheers!"
"Draft at Stone, drank this as a palate-cleanser alongside several vintages of Stone IRS. Poured into a tumbler, the beer appears a murky, hazy orange. The head is small and disappears quickly. The nose is funky and fruity, musty brett alongside aromas of plums and ripe strawberries. There's a ton of acetic acid, some lactic sourness and a touch of sweetness. The ripe fruit character pairs beautifully with the acetic sourness. The taste opens with a ton of lactic sourness and fruity sweetness. Strawberries, vinegar and a faintly herbal hop flavor come out in the mid-palate, with a bit of grain flavor beneath the sourness. The finish is sharp and very vinegary, more than I generally like, but this is really enjoyable in small quantities."
"Fruitier and sweeter with a blend of citrus , peach and nectarines with a relatively clean lactic sourness , this is decent. Acetic character is low. Lemon rind sourness is also present, along with some bitterness. The palate is juicy, fruity and moderately sweet, with honey, nectarines , citrus and lemon juice. Decent. 3.5 3.5/3.5"
"An excellent sour beer, but one glass was all I needed last night. I can't wait to drink more of this tonight though!"
"D - The 41cl(!) glass was a good serving size. I could have gone for another, but I need to save my liver for FoBAB tomorrow. Still it was hard to stop reaching for the glass. Nothing really inhibits drinkability other than having to reach for some Tums later in the evening."
"The flavor opens up with a moderate tartness and notes of plum and grape skins. The beer shows notes of oak and lactic sourness midpalate, with apricot, orange, and a low level of vinegar. There's a low moderate acidity and a tart plum finish with lingering lactic notes. This is a deliciously vinous and damn drinkable sour from New Belgium."
"D: The combination of sweet, sour, and earthiness makes this beer very fun to drink."
"D: I love La Folie, but this IMO is New Belgium's best effort. A fantastic wild ale that could give Beatification a run for its money."
"Pours a hazy orange gold, some straw yellow corners, medium sized white head forms, drops to a thin ring, some lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is real nice, tons of sour fruit, apricots, lemons, oranges, grapefruit, nice woody character, lightly buttery with a touch of vanilla, quite funky and acidic, real nice. Taste is similar, very fruity, lots of sourness, apricots, lemons, orange and tangerine, some wood, burnt toast, very acidic and funky, nice tart finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down, very dry finish. A great sour, definitely well done."
"Drinkability is very good, with a nice tart/sweet fruit combo. It could use more funk but has great acidity. Excellent."
"Sweet and vinegary upfront with some citric sourness and a nice dry puckering finish, oak tannins and bits of vanilla in the back. A bit salty. Some red and green apples, as well as some sour grapes. Low carbonation but quite dry in the finish making it very refreshing and easy to drink. I'd love to have this one more often. One of my favorites at the festival."
"Overall as solid as could be. This was insanely well put together and easily that most sour beer i have come across in months, if not years. Not to be messed with, you need to seek this one out."
"Another outstanding sour ale from New Belgium. Pours a golden brown with a silky tan head. The nose has tart citrus, sweet apricots and peaches along with subtle hops and farmyard funk. The taste is also quite complex. A superble balanced blend of tart and sweet fruits along with rotting wood, damp soil and again subtle hops. Crisp clean body has a dry finish. Delicious stuff. Pairs well with fine cheese."
"D: Very tart and sour... this is borderline too much for me(edit: back then it was... would still be potent but it would be more drinkable and more enjoyable for me now)."
"Enjoyable, nice sipper."
"The taste is pretty tart, though much softer than the Love, which allows a touch more fruit character to come through than was in the aroma. The sourness is much more lactic in focus, but still provides an ample sourness; the acidity accentuates flavors of apricot, strawberry, an incredible sour plum note, tart no make that sour melon and an interesting citrus-vinegar component. This beer is somewhat light bodied, but it does have a certain light-viscous heft to it, though it is still very quaffable; the heft is just enough to be well balanced by the sourness (if that makes sense, the sourness cuts through, yet is tempered at the same time by the body of this brew). Some faint oak flavors towards the finish provide a nice, pepper-like spice / bite. There is some acetic character here, it is light (especially compared to the Love), but really helps to add another dimension to the sourness as well as a bit more balance. This is another phenomenal beer, if not for the Love this would have had a much bigger impact upon me."
"Orange gold, with quite a big frothy head for these New Belgium sour beers. Aromas of citus, citirc acid, oak, vanilla, fruit, and berry. Taste is funky and cidery, butmore fruity than the Foedre or the love. get lots of cherry, and maybe some grape. A bit of sunflower seedin the back their too, with a nice hint of leather pulling it together. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth medium. Drinkability remains high. Excellent."
"Drinkability: Exceptional. I have a high tolerance for acidic beverages and that certainly helps but I feel that Le Terroir is not particularly harsh despite its boldness. For me it makes for a refreshing and exciting imbibing experience."
"d: Very drinkable, excellent tartness. Like La Folie, but lighter malt and with a more pronounced hop profile. An excellent beer, wish they bottled it. I could drink this all night long."
"Orange and amber hues with a slight beige head. Tart and earthy in smell. Not surprising considering that in French it means the land. The first taste hits the back of the jaw and clinches. If you can make it to the second sip you'll find the tartness mellows out into a flavorful yet complex gathering of a beer. An enjoyable beer that should, in my opinion, be consumed slowly, and drinkability is not applicable, because I would think you'd want only one or two at a sitting. A great beer. Unfortunately, only found at the source in FC. NBB."
"Bartender told me it was like Russian River's Supplication, but it was not near as good, and tasted nothing like cherries"
"A remarkable beer and big thanks to Gbontrag for the opportunity."
"Sampled on tap at Monk's Cafe for their New Belgium dinner. What treat this was after waiting to try it for so long. The beer poured a very hazy golden color with an off white head. The nose was a bit hot, maybe high abv but I don't believe the beer has a high abv. There was also a tart barny nose to this as well. The taste is hard to describe. A nice sharp, tart taste with some banana esters and citrus. Very very nice. For lack of a better work, I would compare this to RR Beatification which I happen to love. Although I also love La Folie, I would have to say this was my favorite NB beer of the night."
"Draught today @ Choice City Butcher & Deli. A lovely sour ale. It opens up with an intense sourness then leans towards light hints of caramel and sour apples. Honestly, I didnt perceive much hop character at all, but that is okay. A tremendous brew."
"This one is pretty thick in the mouth. The carbonation feels natural and complements the beer well. I was tempted to give this one a 5 on the drinkability. The flavor in this beer is amazing considering the low ABV, but I think the sour would wear on your stomach after a couple of pints. This is a must try if you ever see it. It's the dry hopped version of La Folie, and isn't drastically different."
"Had during my recent trip to Denver to see my best friend. Great way to start the trip. Went straight from the airport to Falling Rock Taphouse for a few beers before dinner and when we walked in there was a poster announcing a special tapping of Le Terroir. Had to wait about 30 mins for the tapping which was agonizing as I've wanted to try this for years. The bar was kinda dark and the lightning not ideal so kinda hard to nail the color. It appeared to be an apple ciderish color with an orange tint. It was served in a wine glass and had a small head that settled into a thin film with some lacing. The smell was exceptional. It had an amazing sour smell that makes your mouth water. I've tried several Flanders Red Ales in the past year including it's cousin La Folie and this had the best aroma of them all. The mouthfeel was strong with a great sour aftertaste - not too strong, well balanced. The taste was also amazing. I found La Folie to be a bit on the too sour side (not bad but too sour to be a 5). This with the hopping stayed on the not too sour side. It had a great aftertaste and goes down smoooth. Ended up having a couple before we had to head out. Wish they would bottle this. If they did, I'd have one in my fridge constantly. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Overall a wonderful beer that I'll go out of my way to track down again."
"Taste is like La Folie, but not as complex, rich or good. A bit thin, sourness overpowers the sweetness and flavors of the fruits. Does not have the lip-smacking goodness of La Folie. However, this beer is pretty good. Overall, I think this beer is just too sour without having any other comparable qualities."
"Not liked by everyone due to its strong sourness, but def. worth trying a few times."
"Cheers!"
"D- It is strangely good. The first two sips I was kind of worried and wasn't sure I would like this at all. The more I drink of it the more welcoming it becomes. I think I just had to let me taste buds adjust to it. It is one of my first Flanders red (besides Monk's Cafe) and I think I could start to get more into this style. It is very strange how such an offensive beer at first can slowly bring you into it where you just don't want to set it down. Can't wait to try my La Folie."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orangy/pinkish color, some carbonation, no head, and no lacing. The nose is of sour apples, citrus/mandarins, slight yeast, and some hops. The taste is pretty sour/bitter/tangy, but very tasty, it draws you into the brew. The finish is dry. Medium body, well rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, quite a different brew from NB (never had a La Folie yet). I hear it will not be around much longer, so if you can get over to NB, do it."
"But here's the best part: either in spite of or thanks to its challenging flavor profile, this brew is enchantingly addictive and has an awesome drinkability. Had I not had to leave the bar, I could have easily continued satiating my thirst all day on snifter after snifter of this brew. Hopefully I'll get a chance to sample it again..."
"Enjoyed at The Festival of Barrel Aged Beer in Chicago. Listed as a Flanders Red, it was described as, "" Belgian amber ale aged in wine barrels w/ resident bacteria, then dry-hopped with Amarillo hops."" If it sounds good, you can imagine how it tasted. The color is a rust - peach color with a haze. Good head retention that settled to a film over the alcohol and barrel aging. Aromas are of sour cherries, cider, a tart merlot, molassas, musky and complex. The flavors reaffirm the aromas. Throw in a touch of cocoa, raspberries, cranberries, nutty, and woody. Aged for richness and boldness keeps the beer from becoming overly sour or tart. Never astringent or off-putting. The texture is shy of creamy. Thinning from alcohol, low carbonation, and tartness. Lighty vineous in the bitter finish. The amerillo hops really help balance the sweet."
