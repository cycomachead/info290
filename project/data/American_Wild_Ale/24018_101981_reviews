"There's a great bouquet on this with a slightly tart, lightly funky, very berry aroma. The flavor is sourly tart and tangy, yet balanced with a berry squeeze full of juicy flavors. This was deliciousness."

""
""
"This review is for batch 1 NC. Batch 2 paled in comparison."
"Very good sour. Tastes like blackberries. The smell was a bit too funky for my personal taste, but overall an impressive fruited sour."
"Another fine wild beer from JK."

"Blackberries probably just about as good as you can do them. Not all that sour or complex but still a great flavor profile."

"Overall: Wow. This is easily one of the deepest most complex sours I've had and I truly enjoyed it. It definitely settles that sour craving but hidden behind that is a huge earthy oak that I love. I particularly loved how the blackberries don't just add a fruited note to this sour to make it accessible by sweetening it up but instead blend and add to that earthy oak that is so damn good"

"Pour is a dark opaque purple with a pink head.  Nose is faint, touch of oak and a very fleshy blackberry, a bit seedy and pitted.  Taste is similar, the blackberry is seedy, the Brett is very strong, a little too strong as it drowns out the blackberry.  Very faint in flavor. Strong carb on the light body."

"Jester King brings another dry and less sweet version of a fruited sour and are very successful. There are real marriage of the fruit and base beer, hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. batch 2 Apr14'"

"The beer is ruby hued with a small, bubbly pink cap. The aroma is cherries, musty basement, funk. Cherries, raspberries, mild acetic character. Soft carbonation and a delicate finish. This and Atrial Rubicite seem inspired by Cantillon, which is certainly a good thing. A cherry showcase and a fine example of an American wild ale."

"blackberry is such a hard fruit to show through authentically in a beer, especially in a long brett fermented one where all the flavorful sugars just get broken down to oblivion. this is a wonderful demonstration that it is indeed possible. inky purple, hazy and wheaty from the looks of it, this is what i wanted my home-brewed blackberry saison to look like, this color is try blackberry beauty. a nose of brett more than lacto, although both are present, as they always are in jester king stuff. the fruit is musty and yeasty, minimally processed, yet still fresh as anything and juicy and sweet and ripe and sunny and perfect. the berry flavor is right up front with a touch of really pale wheat and slightly sweeter more voluptuous biscuit malt type, while the funk comes second. bretty before acidic again, just like the aroma, and then the berry blasts back in the finish, tartness on tartness, just how these should be. i don't think the fruit shows as well as the wine grape one, the rubicite, or even the cherry one, but its blackberries, and thats part of their modus. great beer, stunning really, worthy of all they hype and then some."

"Dark purple appearance. Very nice looking. A gently foam around the edge with some light colored purple swirls on top. Smell is very fruity, and a little wine like. Some funk and barrel in the nose, too. Starts out with a tart Burst of not quite ripe blackberries. Pick up some nice funk on the very end, with barrel notes appearing, as well. The fruit is nicely balanced here with everything else. Carbonation is around medium. Had this side by side with vsb, vsb was super carbonated compared to this. Nocturn has just a slight amount of fizz in the beginning to go along with that tartness. Not overly sour. Very nice. Pretty easy to drink and very tasty."
"Blend 2 April 2014 bottle from trade poured on July 5, 2014. Pours a beautiful ruby red and purple color with a deep pink head that recedes somewhat quickly. Beautiful notes of vinegar and blackberries, big lacto funk sourness, wow really nice. Flavor is juicy black berries up front but dries out quickly with lots of dry oakiness, light vanilla, lacto, and big sour vinegar notes. Acidic on the tongue and that lingers with the dry oak. Lots of oak tannins and red wine notes both in aroma and flavor. Medium bodied, juicy at first with the dry finished, and high carbonation. This is crazy good and even improves as it warms and the berries really start coming through."

"Overall: This is exactly what I would consider a mellow version of VSB. Jester King is the real deal and this sour is seriously under rated, but VSB is still better sour beer with Blackberries."

"Pours a clear dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, berry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, berry, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but quite sour."

"Recommended."
"This here is better than Atrial. If VSB is better than this then it's probably a religious experience. Do I think it could be better? Probably not. But then I'm a fan of restrained sours whereas others like them mouth puckering. I can think of 10 fruit sours that are ""fruitier"" than this but only in the fruit sweetness sense. This is raw fruit, vinous, dry, funky, oaky, and plain delicious. And the best thing of all, it seems like this will only age and transform graciously. I don't think I'm trading mine. Definitely hoarding this one."

"O: This would be my favorite JK sour that I've had, and in my top 3 sours so far."

"Overall: A HUGE improvement over the last iteration of this beer. The last one was rather vinegary and somewhat light on actual blackberry flavor. This was more like blackberry cobbler. I think by this point it's pretty clear I'm a Jester King fan-boy."
"O- This was a very nice fruited AWA however it's not quite as flavorful as I was hoping. It was definitely very enjoyable but has a hard time standing up against other JK sours such as Atrial and Aurelian. That being said this is a great beer that any fruited sour fan needs to try."

"Overall - It's too sour for me. Most of the other flavors are masked, but what I do taste is good."

"This gorgeous looking brew is one of the better fruited dry sour ales by Jester King (among Nocturn, Atrial and Aurelian). My favorite is Atrial, followed by this, then Aurelian is a distant third. This brew has a much better feel than Aurelian. At the same time, the flavor lacks some complexity. I would like to taste more oak and berry notes. The tart flavor is outstanding on its own."

"Got in a trade with cyde. 500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 1, bottled in 9/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a small foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart blackberry, sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, vinegar, red wine, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, blackberries, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart blackberry, sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, vinegar, red wine, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart blackberry, sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, vinegar, red wine, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, blackberries, and oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of sweetness/tartness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited sour ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, blackberries, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A very enjoyable offering."

"Served in a tulip. Pours a garnet hue with a cloudy clarity and a loose, off-white head. Nose expresses sour milk (somewhat rank) and tart berries. Taste follows nose - berries are much more prevalent and thankfully, the sour milk character drops off appreciably. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an almost still carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a good sour but not mind-blowing."

"The blackberries are there but the fruit character is not up there with Atrial and Aurelian. The base red ale peeks through with some red fruit and chocolate. Medium body, carbonation, and sourness."
