4.49,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"a beer i have missed the opportunity to try on many occasions, so a real treat to finally encounter it again. i was taken aback by its dark color, so may framboise beers are just pale wheat bases with the fruit. this appears to be a rich brown ale, deep and rich looking, with a red accent from the fruit. not what i expected but very cool. the nose on this one is a great mix of chocolate malt from the base beer and tart freshness from the berries, i am surprised how tart they really are, rising above the sweet richness of the brown ale base, which is quite robust on the grain front, toasted and desserty. the bacterial aspect of this is cool too, it seems to exacerbate the intensity of the fruit, and brings a series pucker to the finish of this. the malt chocolate thing comes back a touch, and it feels like a nice valentines day dessert before the acidity washes it out. the lost abbey is famous for a reason, this is the only beer of its kind i have ever tasted, and think it is more than worthy of its high praise. as flavorful a beer as any.","StonedTrippin","Oct 04, 2014"

Probably won’t be my most favorite sour ale but has some great balance and depth of character. One of Lost Abby better concoctions I would say.

Heavy fruit paired with some balsamic vinegar notes present on nose with some mild earth at the end. The taste is a slightly tamed down version of the nose. Raspberries are all over the place balancing between fruity sweetness and acidic tartness. Moderate carbonation with a somewhat fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, this was one of the highlights for me at this years FoBAB. The balance is great and the raspberry character is strong.","homebrew311","Dec 29, 2013"

The taste is slightly funky, followed by tart raspberries, a caramelized sugar sweetness, and a semi-dry, lingering raspberry cake finish. Great malt presence that serves to accentuate the dark fruitiness of the raspberries.

This is followed by the sour base, where the lactic acidity pairs quite well with the fruit. There's also a hint of lemon as well as some acetic character. A little frothy/yogurty as well, the mid-palate is a little chunky/yeasty. Some oak tannins are present, rather well-integrated with the profile. The finish is strongly lactic, scrubbing the palate, almost a little too much, leaving a clean, yogurt sourness and flavor along a clean raspberry sourness. It does, however, feel a little watery. Medium-medium light in body with moderate carbonation, the softness/fullness that the yeast/proteins lend does clash with the brightness of the fruit, but ultimately, I'd say this is one of the better American brewed raspberry sours I've had.

Very pretty looking beer all around. The smell of the beer gives off plenty of raspberry aromas some nice fresh oak and some subtle funk in there too. The taste is excellent in my opinion. There is an explosion of raspberry with the tartness of the fruit itself mixing with the oak from the barrels and the wild yeast. The sourness of the beer is very tolerable in my opinion and still remains very easy to drink. The after taste brings out some of the malt in the base of the beer as the fruit subsides, there is also some hints of cocoa in there as well in the late finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is good, it's a little thin but had a moderate carbonation to it. Overall it was highly enjoyable, I would order this beer again in a heartbeat. Very glad i got to try this, If I ever have it again I want to have it with a rich chocolate dessert of some kind.","Knapp85","Nov 23, 2012"

Aroma is tart and fruity with a massive emphasis on fresh raspberries and lesser accents of green apple skin. Sour raspberry flavor washes over the palate before leaving some sweeter candied berry notes. Touches of wood and a helping of funk with lactic tartness.

Tart smells of raspberries dominate the nose with a hint of grapes and cherries adding to a unique aroma. First sip is almost puckering tart with plenty of sweetness left to make even the most controlled diabetics reaching for their insulin. The raspberries make up the majority of the flavor. Not much of anything else there. Body is super thin but the over carbonation compensates to the point that mouthfeel is quite pleasant. I do believe more time will help this puppy. Time will tell.","ATLbeerDog","Dec 03, 2011"

Exceptional. Taste offers only a hint of sweetness on the aftertaste. Other than that, it is a sour bomb all the way. First sips are highly carbonated and overly prickly on the tongue, but this subsides. Much more character of the fruit than other wilds, making this more of a sour fruit beer in my opinion.

After all, there were plenty of tailors within her Parlor and weekly soirees that would readily repair any damage. Somehow Countess Brioche sought more than just the exploitation of the endearing faces of the working classes. She sought their unending love. Notwithstanding, her acerbic parents brought her up to speak her mind truthfully and freely at all times, no matter how scathing. “Oh-oh-oh!” The Duchess of Piedmont fell down two stairs to her knees upon the rich velvet of Countess Briochess’s train. “Your steps lack precision due to the mass pressed upon them.” Mme. Brioche commented and felt a slight pang at her ejaculation. It wasn’t fair to cut others so deeply with such a bitter acerbic purity. Somehow, in this acidic repartee, others saw themselves, and their own shortcomings, despite the caustic burns they received. Countess Brioche looked upon a bustling courtyard of servants who despised her, but respected her stinging candor.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 06, 2011"

The aroma is incredibly balanced between the high acidic sourness and the raspberry. Great sour smell! The raspberry is very noticeable an compliments the beer's flavors very well. There is no acetobacter and the sourness is absolutely spot-on. What a beer. One of my favorite styles when done the right way (this being a killer American fruited sour). I'd love to try the base beer also. In the mouth it has a medium body which is lightened by the high carbonation, which combined with refreshing sourness, acidity, and tartness from fruit makes this super drinkable. I wish it would last longer.","Douglas14","Apr 18, 2011"

Scent is STRONG raspberry with hints of funk, oak, and sour aromas. Taste is initially sweet, fresh raspberry goodness. Finishes very sour and acidic. There are some lovely wooden notes throughout.

3.2,-26.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a murky dark brown with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, maple syrup, oak, and slight mothballs (oxidation?). The flavor was of sweet malt, maple syrup, raspberries, oak, and oxidation (sigh...). It had a medium feel on the palate with very low carbonation (almost flat). Overall I believe this brew was treated badly in its past. There was no visible leaking from the cork to hint that oxidation should be present. So I was quite surprised when I found it to be. So I will say, there wasn't anything awe-inspiring in this one to say the least. Hate that this one was oxidized. Still had a decent flavor I could tell from the background notes in this one, but the oxidation was just overpowering. Aroma was okay on this one. Would love to try one that had been treated nicely in its past.","thagr81us","Feb 14, 2011"
3.79,-12.7,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Shared by Chris and reviewed from notes. Poured into a lost abbey tumbler, murky red liquid with a dirty off white head, decent retention. Smell is strong sour raspberries, lemon and lime soda, sugary with a slight bit of maltiness. Taste is pretty intense - big sour raspberry flavor up front, sour lemons, a bit of that trademark Lost Abbey funk, some blueberries, slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium carbonation, very acidic, makes it feel like it is coating. Not a bad beer, but the over the top sourness without any kind of balancing could definitley be improved with a bit of oak or more wild yeast flavors and aromas.","nkersten","Feb 11, 2011"

4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Been saving this one for a little bit. Pours a deep, deep red that is just translucent. Lovely bottle conditioned dense one finger head. Not much lacing to speak of, but there are some sticky spots. Aroma is a blast of sharp, tart raspberry, damp hay and straw, light brett funk, and a slight bit of wood. The flavor is dominated by sour fruit, and oaky tannins. The sour is a deep sour, not so much tart. Earthy, musty, woody undertones; not too funky though seems the light brett aroma is left in the hose and doesn't carry to the flavor. Just a tad of pie-crust. Great cleansing dry finish that leaves a pucker of raspberry on the tongue. Feels a little fuller then a standard framboise. A great beer for sure.","pmlondrigan","Dec 11, 2010"

Pours a muted raspberry with a loose, quarter inch head that dissipates into a fairly consistent thin skim with one large dollop of foam that coalesced in the center. Clarity was a little hazy/murky. Nose is big, sweet raspberries and a suggestion of artificial sweetener. Taste is really salty at the start, followed by raspberries and some tartness; however, the tartness, is masked by the saltiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium and the saltiness really stimulates the salivary glands. Carbonation is very lively and falls just short of being prickly.

This beer is still young so the raspberries are prominent adding a sweet yet still tart balance and another level of complexity. Soft carbonation throughout as well as a slight syrupy texture adds some thickness/fullness to the body but the bone dry, intensely puckering finish leaves me salivating for another sip. Only slightly acidic and extremely quaffable. Again, this beer is young so the fruit is still prominent but with some age this is going to develop into a monster.

The ASGC was amazing and this is just sort of the ""cherry"" to top it off. I'm happy I bought my max allotment and would buy even more given the oppertunity.","jjanega08","May 10, 2010"
4.62,6.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Pretty damned tasty brew that I thoroughly enjoyed. It has a fairly nice balance between the sour, raspberries and wood but I really love the big vanilla aspect that mixes with the fruit. Now to just get them to put it in 750's. Thanks much Corey!","younger35","May 07, 2010"
4.37,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D- High. I love this beer. Kind of pissed at the start from the explosion, but by the end I have a smile on my face. This beer is fantastic.","ShogoKawada","May 06, 2010"
4.37,0.7,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"D- Easy to drink and enjoy, awesome nose and a good taste to this beer make it quite enjoyable.","Schmaltzy","May 05, 2010"
3.83,-11.8,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Eventually, I decided to agitate the beer aggressively to help dispel some of the carbonation. I noticed an improvement in the flavor profile, however I still felt that the mustiness overwhelmed the sourness and fruit a bit too much.","alcstradamus","May 04, 2010"
4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This one needs some work - a bit too sweet, and the heavy carbonation is an obvious over-reaction to the many flat lost abbey bottles of 2009. That said, and although there is a long road ahead, this is a great step forward for American breweries in terms of lambic/framboise style beers. ""American Wild Ale"" may no longer be enough!","craytonic","May 02, 2010"

4.8,10.6,5,5,4.5,5,5,"This may be the best I have had from Lost Abbey in terms of fruite beers ever. Maybe it was just me but I have never had something that worked for me so well with this rich flavor. Cannot say enough good things here.","mikesgroove","May 01, 2010"
4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is smooth with punchy carbonation. Good body and overall quite the tasty brew. Of all the new Lost Abbey beers I've had this ranks up there with the best of them. Worth seeking this one out, especially if you're a fan of framboise. No gusher on this bottle, although the cork was a bit of a pain to get out.","orbitalr0x","Apr 30, 2010"
4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: After the first sip my initial thought was ""I wish this was a 750ml."" I really enjoyed this beer.","callmemickey","Apr 30, 2010"

4.6,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"If you're a fan of wild ales, you will be very impressed with the Framboise. Reminds me of the Consecration but aged with raspberries added instead of currants. Pinkish brown pour, raspberries, yeast funk and brown malt in the nose and raspberries, brett, oak and sour cherry in the taste. Mouthfeel is really close to as good as it gets for the style, but having plenty of Tomme's other Sours I can say it could be a touch smoother. You will want another one, the lingering dryness combined with the tart, sour character of the beer will have you thirsting for seconds.","Hopsfiend","Apr 26, 2010"
4.33,-0.2,2.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, with a slightly syrupy heftiness to the finish. I'll say this is highly drinkable, because I wanted more at the end of the glass, and I would love to have this again really soon. I can't imagine this would age well- all of its flavor is from the fruit, which would likley fade with time and lead to the plain tasting base beer.","jeffthecheff","Apr 25, 2010"
4.8,10.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability? This would be a very difficult brew for me to cellar as it is SO ready to drink right now and that being said, the liquid in my glass is flying the hell out. Outstanding. World class. 'nuff said.","Bitterbill","Apr 24, 2010"
4.52,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"an absolutely amazing beer. I think I will have to a trip up to the brewery to get some more bottles!!!","pastradul","Apr 21, 2010"
4.52,4.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"A seven ounce pour of this is a 5 on drinkability, but the acidity makes a full bottle somewhat laborious. It's a chest burner. Still, the aroma and flavor are undeniably excellent. This is one hell of a framboise.","HopHead84","Apr 19, 2010"
4.51,3.9,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: I'm usually not the hugest fan of the framboise variety of lambic/sour beers, but this was a really pleasant and refreshing take on it.","womencantsail","Apr 19, 2010"
4.69,8.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"**had another bottle tonight. If anything, I underrated this on my first review ... maybe due to old ill feelings. Really a splendid beer.","Overlord","Apr 17, 2010"
4.01,-7.6,2.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"All in all a fine entry, and one I'm glad I was able to try both from the tap at the brewery and in the six bottles I was able to pick up at the release event.","belgianjunkie","Apr 17, 2010"

4.19,-3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Draft, City Beer Store. This beer is a darkish pink with no head and looks thick, like a cross between Pepto and the dregs of a fruit beer. The aroma is pretty great. There's huge Raspberry note backed by a clean lactic sourness. It's fresh and natural smelling, no artificial fruit here. It reminds me of making raspberry jam. The flavor is almost harshly tart and lactic sour, which I enjoy but probably isn't for everyone. The mouthfeel seems thick but I could be imagining that. The beer is fairly palette wrecking, pleasingly so at first but it wore on me. The lactic tart raspberry was strong enough to make me almost lose the flavor by the end of my small glass. Very interesting and rather delicious beer, particularly in small doses.","popery","Feb 10, 2010"
4.59,5.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Murky reddish-purple in the glass with a small white head that settles to little more than a film. Huge tart raspberry aroma backed by very clean lactic sourness. I could accuse this of being one-dimensional, but the fruit character is amazing. Tart raspberries are equally dominant on the palate, with the perfect level of lactic sourness backing it. Finishes with a trace of woody astringency, but very clean on the whole. Simple, straight-forward and beautifully crafted, this is what Lindemans Framboise would taste like if it were dry and sour (and good).","largadeer","Feb 09, 2010"
