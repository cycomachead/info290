They make styles that I love, but are hardly ever worth the price tag or even close to the better examples of the style. This however hits the mark. Nice character, and depth of flavor with a crisp drying fuller body. Which almost always seems to be missing in some of their other beers. This is expensive, but very enjoyable and well done.","champ103","May 01, 2014"

4.1,-2.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, January 2013 bottling. Moderate gusher upon opening. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, prune, red grape, toast, toffee, light chocolate, clove, oak, hay, straw, red wine vinegar, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, fruity/acidic yeast, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, prune, red grape, toast, toffee, light chocolate, clove, oak, hay, straw, red wine vinegar, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Moderate fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, prune, red grape, clove, oak, hay, straw, vinegar, light leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately slick/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent sour red ale! All around great complexity and balance of malt, fruity/acidic yeast, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

Either way, this beer was very enjoyable, and it has only reaffirmed by faith in this small-time Texas brewery. I pulled some similarities to RR Consecration out of RU-55.

The smell is a malty with an interesting sweetness, also caramel or cherry on the nose and lightly toasted. The taste of the beer has a really interesting flavor as well. More malty and dry than sour. There is an earthy grain flavor in the finish with the sourness up front. The mouthfeel of the beer is dry, lightly carbonated.

Smell and taste are pretty similar, nose especially has a lots of oak, some vegetable notes, lots of funk, some dark fruit. Taste is drinkably sour and extremely enjoyable. It's just sweet enough to balance out the tartness. Over all this is the best sour I've ever had, being fairly new to the style. Leaves you mouth watering and waiting for the next sip. Glad I got to try this.","brewtus","Apr 07, 2013"

3.63,-13.8,3.25,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some fruity, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells much better than it tastes in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 05, 2013"

The flavors are all there though...tart fruitiness, medium amount of sourness and a nice wood presence. It’s still a damn good Flanders style ale, especially once it gets to room temp and the sourness is more pronounced. If it was under $10 a bottle, I would buy some more, carbonation problems be damned. If they fix that issue, I would love to grab a few of these, even at the steep tag of $15.","twiggamortis420","Feb 26, 2013"

4.21,0,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall this is unlike most Oud Bruin/Flanders Red Ales on the market. It lacks the huge vinegar (The Bruery) and lactic (Cascade) flavors which makes this a much more balanced drinkable sour/wild red ale that I could drink more than one of without wrecking my palate. I would personally prefer a little more so I will be waiting on the remainder of my bottle for several months to see where it goes.","claspada","Feb 23, 2013"

Think Russian River's Consecration without the currants. The finish is dry and fruity with vinegar, black cherry, leather, and woodiness from the barrel-aging. Mouthfeel is juicy where it should be, up until the drying finish, and light in carbonation and thickness. All in all, an excellent sour ale that holds up with some of the nation's greats. Very glad to have this beer at my disposal for the foreseeable future!","wagenvolks","Jan 19, 2013"
