Aroma is full and fruity, plenty of citrus, some tropical fruit, spice and funk. Tastes of juicy grapefruit and tropical fruit, nice tartness, dank notes, a crisp and bitter, dry finish. Wild sourness nicely highlights fruity aspects of the Mosaic hops.","HipCzech","Jan 14, 2015"

Nice brett forward nose not unlike Orval with a wine like twang.  Overall a nice funky and tart ale, hits the spot if you’re looking to get your brett fix without going full out lambic.","CowsandBeer","0"

4.21,1,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"16.9 ounce bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with a couple inch white head that stayed around a long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  I like the aroma, the brew smells like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, lemon peel), funk, and some grainy malt.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some grassiness, lime and green grapes/grape skins noticeable.  The tartness isn't very strong at all, but with that being said it still tastes good.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated.  Overall I liked this brew, and it was one that I liked more and more the longer I drank it.  Definitely worth trying!","bluejacket74","Nov 24, 2014"

Finishes dry and musty.  Gold ale beneath with soft tangerine hop somewhere in the middle.  The finish is a bit odd and dry and musty. Not bad, but probably won't be more than a one time affair for me.","cosmicevan","Nov 17, 2014"

The first sips while still fridge cold are nice and light.  Theres almost no detection of alcohol and it drinks like afruity saison.  As it warms midway through it turns more towards the sour feel with a tart taste and a dry finish.  Almost reminds me of a carbed pinot grigio.  I really enjoyed this one and I'm glad I traded for 2!","JStampler","Beers"

Taste: lemon upfront followed by very dillute tropical fruit juice...passion fruit may be the closest, then as the carbonation builds it moves to lactic doused canned pear, and as it dries out this all fades into grain twang and brett-land with acetic and white wine notes and finishing with unripe peach and lemon peel.

The majority of the funk in the nose comes from some raunchy mosaic hops: mango, peach, guava, guanabana, and BO. Flavor is big on crackery malts and acid. Hops aren't as much in the forefront, as it's the dry hopping adding those massive aromas. Pleasant and VERY light and refreshing bitterness in the finish. Yeast offers up some fruitiness. Refreshing and palate cleansing. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and effervescent. Acid strips the tongue. It's a shame that I'm not having this beer with food. This screams for a runny, washed rind cheese or fried seafood. Excellent.","goochpunch","Jul 18, 2014"

The nose has pronounced pineapple/citrus in the forefront followed by some funk and grain sweetness (especially when warming) - it's juicy and aromatic. The taste has similar resemblance to pineapple and oranges which quickly transitions into a slightly chewy, yeasty middle and finishes with hoppy, tropical fruitiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good funk and bitterness, potent citrus, adequate carbonation (that comes off a bit creamy), masked booze, and a semi-sweet, juicy finish. This beer is outstanding when fresh (drink now) and hits the dry hopped wild ale target better than my previous style favorites.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 10, 2014"

Loads of bretty barnyard funk, hibiscus and tropical fruit. A swirl brings out the mango and papaya. Maybe a touch of pine. Taste is nicely acidic, but not overly sour. The brett isn't nearly as pronounced, and balances well with the floral and fruit notes. Mid-dry medium mouth that's is really crisp. This is a very good sour saison, another in a growing line of creative brews from Prairie Artisan.","MartzMimic","0"
