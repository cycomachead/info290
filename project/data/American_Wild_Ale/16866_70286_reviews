"Overall: as a general thing I simply do not understand this style.  If this is your type of thing then I would suggest getting a bottle because for what it is it does a very good job.  If you don't care for this style don't expect this beer to change your mind.  Overall pretty good, great even just not for me.  Also hab11 just reminded me thus was aged in Oak barrels.  I got no barrel presence whatsoever.  No oak tannins from which this beer could have greatly benefitted.  Not for me but maybe for you."
"2013 Edition.  Pours a nice head that subsides to a thin ring of retention, shows some leg. It is tart, nice solid body.  Roast is subtle, like dark chocolate covered cherries."

"Hard to tell this beer is a stout.  The presence of roasted malt adds some wonderful dark flavors, although not as aggressive a roastiness as most stouts.  Simplicity, subtlety and elegance are characteristics this beer brings to the table better than any stout and almost any sour ale I've ever tasted.  Truly a boundary breaker and a testament to demonstrate where craft beer can go."

"O - 1.5 - I guess some people are really into this whole sour beer craze, and I can imagine there's probably a huge following for this type of beer, but for ME, I'd rather spend a fraction of the cost and get myself a bottle of vinegar and a bottle of soy sauce. Has definitely opened my eyes to the fact that I am indeed not a sour drinker."

"Just getting into sour beers this one was very sour and tasty."
"My enough stout in my opinion. Could taste the oak pretty nicely in the finish, but didn't give me that milky depth that a stout should have"

"750ml bottle shared during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into a tulip. Appearance is dark opaque brown with a finger of tan head that settles to a collar and leaves sporadic, spotty lacing. Aroma is sour cherries, roasted malt, oak, and chocolate. Taste is sour cherries and dark fruit, surrounded by roasted malt and chocolate sweetness, and a drying oak and grape finish. Medium body, slightly creamy texture, average-plus carbonation which is good for the style and weight of this beer, and a puckering, tannic, drying finish."

"If I wanted Sweetarts, I would have returned to the 1980s"
""
""
""
"Not what I expected. Definitely more of a sour than stout, but it was enjoyable. I expected to pick up some typical roasted  character of a stout, but that didn't seem to be present."

"This beer was pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer but not exceptional.  At $20/bottle, I am not likely to try this again.  It is supposed to be a stout/sour hybrid, but I only picked up hints of the stout flavors.  Blind taste test, I would have identified it as a straight sour/wild ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark - almost black.  Much more tart than I expected, given the barrel aging.   A very good sour ale with a nose and taste of sour cherries with some maltiness.  A good beer, but dominated by the tartness."

"Overall(4.25): I am pretty new to sour beers, this only being about my 4th and so far this is my second favorite. This beer drinks like a lighter beer, as I'm sure most sours do. I'd have some trouble calling this a stout, but it is damn good. I'll be picking this up again if I ever come across it."
""
""
"I can't profess to be an expert on sours whether American or otherwise, but this is the type I like. More fruity than something like a Supplication, this stuff was very tasty."

"Deliciously sour.  Looking forward to my next bottle."
""
""
""
""
"I made a sour of my own a few years ago and it was very similar in taste to this beer.  Except that it didn't cost me $20 a bottle.  Ultimately my disappointment is due to the high price of the beer (and thus high expectations) and the optimistic labeling that implies more stout flavor than I was able to get out of it."

"April 2014 bottle. A - black with a hint of brown. Almost no head. Reminds me of coca-cola actually. N - sour cherries, apples, plums, maybe some muted vanilla, some roasted malts, plenty of oak barrel. T - sour cherries, plums, apples, roasted malt, a truckload of sourness and lots of oak barrel. M - a bit creamy, low carbonation, a sticky sweet sourness that coats the mouth and lingers. O - one of, if not my favorite beer. If I have any complaints, it is the sticky mouthfeel that lingers. Otherwise, it is my go to sour."

"Sorry if my score seems too harsh.  This beer is not badly executed for what it is, but it is just not for me.  It would like to have seen the sourness glanced with some stout characteristics."
""
""
"I'm left a little bummed out. Maybe I'm just getting a little annoyed with Bruery's pricing, or I'm just expecting too much. Whatever it is, I think people are overrating this beer a little bit just because it's their way of trying to compensate for the price they paid for this beer. It's a great beer, but the price is just too high for me to seek it out again. Where are the stout characteristics? They're basically nowhere to be found. I was intrigued by the idea of a sour stout, but this doesn't taste like one at all. It's a very good beer I'd probably recommend to others to at least try, but again, the price makes it too high to make it worth returning to -- at least for the next few years. And whenever I do get it again, I'll be aging it a couple years or so to see how it turns out."

"I'm surprised by all the love for this beer.  I found it to be drinkable but not much else.  If the stout character was more evident, then this beer may have been more interesting.  As it is, I finished the bottle myself but I don't think I'll be buying this one again."

"Looks Smell is green apple, a little roast , mostly fruity esters, interesting profile.the color is more black than brown, yet some brown hues are coming through the glass since the body is looking on the light side. More fruity sour than vinegar sour, is refreshing, sour-green apple, good amount of large bubbles, making for a light and refreshing beer, I like the paradox. The hints of chocolate and barrel remains on the palate and nose. Heavy Soups and Stews, red meat, heavier dishes, low-medium spice/herb dishes."

"On tap at local WOB.  Poured black (was dark at my seat) with minimal head into a snifter glass.  Smell was of tart fruit and faint coffee/caramel.  Mouthfeel was light with more carbonation than expected.  Taste was tart fruit, sour, cherry, fig, maybe some dates.  Very faint cocoa/coffee/caramel.  Aftertaste is acid/sour but not offensive.  Overall, tasty and well done."

"Wow! One of my favorite beers but it has heavy Brett,Lacto and bourbon. Not for someone who doesn't like sours or barrel aged beers(20$-35$ 750ml)they offer a beer, MÃ©lange 1, that is a similar beer but with bigger stout character. I prefer this because its so damn tart its like bourbon but sour. Just so full bodied and original, no style to even describe this masterpiece of a beer."
""
""
""
"O - I can't help comparing this beer to JK's Funky Metal which is also a sour stout.  Where Funky Metal does a great job of contrasting the roasted stout flavors of coffee and chocolate against the sourness of that beer, ToD does not have such complexity and just doesn't measure up.  It's a good sour beer but definitely not the best and somewhat pricey for what you get."

"25.4 oz Bottle.Dark brown poured into a 20 oz Firestone glass.Smells like Berry and Vinegar.Very strong wine taste to it.I wanted to like this so bad because I had heard so many good things about it but to me the flavor was just Nasty.Extreme SOUR taste was so present that I could not get around it to decide what the other flavors  were.Made it through about 3/4 through the bottle and then it became DRAIN POUR.And at 19.99 a bottle that hurt.If you like wine this might be better suited for you.But for me I can`t recommend it to a Beer drinker.Needless to say I will not be buying this anytime soon.Sorry Bruery.Thumbs down."
"I was nicely surprised by this ale. I assumed it would be similar to JP Obscrura but I was wrong. This is more a dark fruited sour over a sour stout. It's a bit pricey but a sour folks need to try."

"O:  An awesome, very drinkable sour.  No much stout characteristic here, other than the color. Did not detect much oak either.  This bottle was 2014 release.  Still have a 2013 release; curious to see what an extra year in the bottle will yield."
"I need to taste this next to Oude Tart because I swear it's the same beer, if not extremely similar. I have had this on draft and in a bottle now, I want to love it, but I just don't get any stout whatsoever. Very, very sour. As sours go, I have had better."

"Overall, this is a well done, tart wild ale.  If you can come to terms with the price ($20.12 for 750 mL), it is certainly worth trying."
""
"Not my usual style.  Most interesting beer of the year.   Tart is understated, reminiscent of biting into a lemon but not as strong, more like wild cherry tart.  Oak aged but subtle.  Like Carolina style pork BBQ without the spice.  On draft 6 oz glass at White Oak Tavern in Ellicott city, Md.  Best sipped"

""
""
""

"Pour is purplish black with a soapy ring. Nose is heavy sweetness, disoriented malt sugars and berry sweetness with a light leathery brett presence. Taste is awful, strong acetic acid and extreme residual sugar with tons of malt sweetness. Virtually no stout flavors other than too sweet, finish is bretty and bitter with high acid levels and a slick oily feel. Rough drain pour."

"O/D - This was a pretty nice stout. Sour and complimented by those robust stout flavours but perhaps dominated by that sourness. All the flavours seemed to come together to form a pretty complex and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 vintage. Pours the color of cola with no head. Nose expresses tart berries and roasty malt. Taste is tart; however, there's a dark malt profile, but it is really just in the background. There's also a salty quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body and slightly puckering. Overall, an interesting beer, but it needs an identity - it falls somewhere between a dark sour and sour stout."

"Appearance is dark black..white minimal foam head tops. Sour grapes nose.. Definitely a wild yeast strain evident here. Sweet like wine. Taste is sour and puckers yet rounds out like a merlot.. Very different. Mouthfeel thick and heavy. Overall different.. Refreshing"

"O- really good. Sour stouts get me going and this one is a stud as far as I'm concerned. Big fan of The Bruery and this is outstanding."
""
""
""
"Maybe one of the best sours I've tasted. Wine like, even old wine like fruit with gobs of acidity leaning your palate and bringing you back for more. The aromas of red fruit and cherry and the perfect carbonation make this a top 10 all time sour. ;;;"

"Not sure when I had picked this one up but was excited to give it a try. Split it with my beer guru. Almost no head at all on this one but the smell was unreal, absolutely popped. Taste was awesome, but it will certainly make you pucker so you better like tart. An extremely enjoyable beer that is a must try and one I hope to enjoy again."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Rather nice, really. I would drink it again. For you. For all of you."

"Incredible... Mouth watering... saliva creating.. the best I've ever had. I love sour and I love Stout... and this one took it all the way ! It's hard to find and a bit expensive but sooo worth it ! It's my special day beer. Dark like a stout, but incredibly light tasting nearing an Ale in feel... Smell is very alluring, draws you in with a sour hint and then slaps you once you've put it in your mouth. Makes my mouth water... I've had others from the same brewer and they are all good, but the Stout is by far my favorite."

"Overall, a delicious beer if you like styles that don't hide their sour characteristics. I wouldn't come into this one expecting much from the stout side of the equation--really, the stout provides more in the way of color and appearance than it does with the aroma and flavor. Not sure I'd go out of my way to get this again, given the fact that The Bruery doesn't distribute to my area, but it is a tasty beer to be sure."

"Some orange goop had collected around the rim of the bottle while it was conditioning and I got it on my fingers when I opened the bottle. The beer is dark brown in appearance with a fizzy head that disappears immediately. Plenty of carbonation bubbles are left sticking to the side of the glass. The smell is vinegary with hints of grape and cherry. After a bit of a sweet fruit taste at the front of the tongue, the taste explodes with potent sourness. It finishes with a bready yeast taste to balance it out. Mouthfeel is medium to watery."

"This beer is perfection. Complex, strong from start to finish, biting acidity with huge, beautiful, full flavor to back it up. I would seriously trade one of my cousins for a bottle of this but we don't see each other very often so it's fine. Definitely not for the meek."

"Nice dark lambic style beer. Impressively sour, but enough good flavour around the edges to keep it interesting and appealing."
""
""
""
"I see this as a Flanders Red turn Oud Bruin, turn Sour Porter in the most unique and seductive way possible. Its a procession into a direction that allows its darker side to assist in its sour dryness. Simply sublime at every turn."
""
""
""
""
"O: It was not what I expected, but it was still very good. Just don't expect a stout."
""
""
"Overall, yes, this is good stuff. Probably the best beer I've had from the Bruery. This is sharp, intense and unrepentant. The darkness doesn't come through all that much, but then the colour is just impressive. Yep. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour Stout? Yes please. I was sold before I even tasted it. Poured from bottle into snifter, appears light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Roasted, chocolate aromas. First sip annihilates your tastebuds with a level of sour that would make a warhead's lips pucker. The chocolate/mocha flavors oddly pair nicely with the intense sour. Absolutely delicious."

"I'm a bit surprised at the malt's lesser role here, though it could be that it was all that it could do to stave off the funky, acetic acid onslaught. This one's still all about the sour - it just looks dark. Glad I got a chance to hit a bigger serving, after missing out on this at GABF last year."
""
""
""
"O - Excellent sour. Easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a lot drier and more sour than I expected. It's good, but a little more stout maltiness and barrel presence would make the beer more interesting."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting mix with the dark characteristics and the sour coming together."
""
"O: Alone in its class, in my opinion. La Folie and Crooked Stave are great wild / sour beers, but this is pretty darn close to a masterpiece."
""
""
"NYE bottle share at Proof. Deepest of opaque browns with a thin white-tan head and thin tan collar. Aroma is like a port, dark fruit, deep red wine, some woodiness. Taste is extremely tart. Vinegary almost. I'm getting some of the wine like characteristics, with some roasted malt too. Very interesting flavor. Medium carbonation and medium-thick body."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Re-review: somewhat surprised at how generally accurate my original review was.  I think this beer could be pale and taste just as good, so in a certain way, I'm not sure where using roasted malts is a big part of the beer.  Overall rating increased, regardless."
"finally! I have been after this one for a long time, what a rare treat, a sour stout, not too many of these on the market. its got a velvety textured almost black pour, without a ton of visible carbonation, but just under an inch of fairly robust tannish head. the nose is sour, I mean real sour, as sour as anything ive smelled, save maybe their motherfunker. the sour trumps the blackness of the stout, and the chocolate malt, roasted barley, and barrel are all sort of muted behind the acidity and lactic funk of the nose here. the taste is a little more in balance, and it starts off dark and roasty as expected. I get subtle sweetness, spice, and more complex grain, but before I have time to contemplate any of that, it transforms instantly into a sour bomb, not overly acidic like some bruery sours, but softly feeling brutally sour, if you can imagine such a sensation. the huge body of this beer and its really dark malty earthiness keep the sour in check just long enough to form a really intriguing flavor profile. it is truly different, like nothing else ive had. the stout itself reminds me a lot of darkness, with some cherry and other fruit in the finish. the sour here plays on those fruit notes and carries it away. great idea, brilliantly executed. the bruery has a real knack for doing that, which is why I will always come up with the money to try their new stuff, especially the sours and wilds. this is a treasure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer and worth getting when it's available. As far as wild ale's go, this one is pretty good with an interesting mix of ingredients."
""
"A dark body with a tanned head that falls quickly leaving minimal lacing. The nose starts with a bit of chocolate and roasted malts but transitions quickly to tart sourness with lots of acidic citrus. The taste is mouth-puckering sour; a bit of coffee and a touch salty. The finish is dry, dry, dry and sour! I really enjoyed this beer, but I found it to be a bit one note."
""
"Overall- solid beer if you like sours. The tartness is well blended with the stout flavor and leaves a nice finish that doesn't destroy your mouth like other sours."

"Overall I have no idea what the hell I'm drinking but it's incredibly complex and tasty. First sour stout experience definitely was a good one, going to have to pick up as many of these as possible while they're still on the shelves"
""
""

""
"O- This beer was quite good for not knowing what to expect. I regret not splitting the bottle with anyone, but then again, no one else wanted any. I would recommend sharing this one with friends."
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love sours, so I really enjoyed this one. Definitely one of the most sour I've ever tried. The slight roastyness works nicely here. Recommendable."
""
""
""
"taste was very very sour. dont get me wrong, I love sour beers but this one was way out of balance. the souring agent completely took over and left very little to taste. I really was searching for the fruit that I could smell, but it was buried beneath the sourness. pretty let down given the price and reputation of The Bruery. I can name 20 sour beers that are better than this one. maybe aging would help, but I doubt it."
""
""
"A really nice beer, not terribly complex, but a nice unlikely combination of styles."
""
"O - This is a fantastic sour beer. It doesn't have the kind of vinegar-sweetness that something like Dutchess has. It's not a flanders-style sour. This is a wild ale, and it is a great representation of the style."
"O: As usual, pretty good stuff from the Bruery. There's definitely enough sourness to make any sour lover happy. Not enough depth or complexity, though, and the appearance left much to be desired. Would recommend!"
""
""
""

"Regardless of the base beer, when The Bruery reach for their special, magical blend of bacterias and yeasts you know how that movie is going to end: sour, delicious and pricey. These guys have done for 'funk' what Scorsese has for De Niro and DiCaprio or Burton for Depp: they work together almost exclusively and the genius of one has no doubt made the other a star."

"The beer pours a dark and mysterious black, with a small head of very light, very small, tan bubbles that fizzle away like soda water, leaving only the slightest of tan rings around the glass. The head leaves small tendrils of lacing. In body, the beer is almost visible to the eye, but is just dark enough that no light shows through. The body appears free of particles. On the nose, this beer is certainly tart and funky. Nice cherry fruit-leather scents waft over the nose with touches of cocoa, raisins, dates, and plums. Touches of horse blanket and sweet sweat can occasionally be smelled, and as the beer warms the cocoa become a touch richer and adds light vanilla and oak to the mix. In the mouth, the beer is puckering in its acidity with bright malic acid and other acids singing on the tongue. Touches of sweetness appear in the front of the taste alongside the rich and funky fruit flavors, but this is dried out in the finish. Touches of tannic bitters can be sensed, and grow stronger as the beer warms giving a nice, herbal bitterness to the very back of the senses. There is even a touch of funky salinity in this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sharp green apple and cherry leather with mingling plum and raisin, as the beer warms the mouth is met with a big rush of tannic oak and soft vanilla, alongside sweeter cherries with just a brushing of brown sugar and cocoa. The finish seems quick but actually lasts for quite a while with slightly astringent oak, tart cherries, and soft roast malt. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a puckering and sharp mouthfeel that softens as the beer warms. Carbonation is middling in this beer with a touch of sharpness, as well. The beer finishes feeling smooth and almost velvety. The mouth is left dry and puckering. Overall, itâs a touch too tart, but then again, itâs called the Tart of Darkness. I want a little more in terms of stout qualities, but I have gotten that from other bottles of Tart of Darkness. The funk is rich and awesome in this beer, and the complexity of the beer is deep, bringing new flavors as the beer warms. I love the use of oak in this beer, and like the rich funk and tartness. Personally, I would want to turn the funk up and the tartness down, but that is not what this beer is about. This bottle is totally worth its cost. Try it."

"Poured a deep black with a very thin ring of tan head. It certainly looks like a stout. Scents of apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar and red wine, with slight roast malt. The nose is certainly sour, not quite a RIS in scent. This carries over into the flavor. It's apple cider vinegar, sour funk, red wine and grapeskin, without many other flavors. It tastes quite sour and vinous, with none of the flavors I expected in a RIS. It's not bad, an excellent sour for sure, but less of a RIS. It was quite nice for what it was, indeed it was excellent. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying mouthfeel. It feels like both a stout and a sour, quite nice. Overall this is a good combination of a sour and a RIS, though the sour overwhelms much of the stout qualities. I'd recommend it if you like sours, but if you want a stout look elsewhere."
"Tried this one at the tasting room. Pours a dark brown to black with some ruby around the edges and a light khaki head. Aroma is sweet and sour chocolates, strangely enough, and some light vinegar that I get from the sour beers. Flavor follows with a lightly chocolates sour flavor, rather easy on the taste buds. It finishes with chocolate on the way down, but leaves a tinge of sour lingering on the to hue. Medium bodied. Very unique and they somehow made this work nicely. Would like to have this one again."

"The body was very thin, especially for a Stout, but did have a clean, dry finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smooth and easy. Overall, a pretty nice brew, but probably not worth the $21+tax price tag. Probably worth trying, but that will depend on your wallet."

"750 ml bottle, 2013 edition. 05/13/13 printed on the bottle, I assume that's the bottled on date. Served in a tulip, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing, either. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like tart cherries, dark fruit, roasted malt, and some vinegar. It tastes like tart cherries, dark fruit, vinegar, lemon peel, vinegar, and some roasted malt and blackberries. It's more of a sour brew than a stout, not that I'm complaining. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with low/moderate carbonation. I think it's a pretty good brew, I might have to pick up another bottle soon. $18.99 a bottle. It's pricey but tasty!"

"Overall, really different. I like it, though I think it might be a little bit too sour for the stout notes to work."
"I've found that the Bruery is really good with their stouts and sours overall, as well as emulating their favorite pastries into the beer format. This does all three quite well, and I'm wondering if the extra booze on this vintage increased the sweetness and in the process enhanced a lot of the malty and fruity nuances that this beer has always had. This was unbelievably refreshing to drink after a sequence of oppressive and mediocre sours that night. Fantastic stuff - I'm cellaring a bottle and can't wait to see what it turns into by next year."
""
""
"O-If you like it sour, this is a good beer. If you want your stout to have a kick of funk or sour bite, maybe look elsewhere, because this thing is heavy on pucker and light on roasty malt. In fact, even though I like my beers sour, this is almost too much...to the point that it is a bit simple and not complex enough. But still, I enjoy this beer, I like the grape/cherry combo and there is just enough ""stout"" character to keep it from being a complete stomach-burning monster."

"I'm happy with it, usually when I drink a sour my mouth becomes acquainted and we move past the initial pucker. I'm at the end of my first glass and I think I just had a shiver run through me, whoa. Prior to this, the only sour stout I had tried was Funk Metal from Jester King, which was solid, and had more characteristics of a stout. This however is very sour, I'm reminded that it's a stout solely by the color of the beer in my glass."

"I have been seriously tasting the barrel-aged stouts recently. I like the ghostly presence of the 'stout' I am tasting in this. the 'sour' just dominates. the bruery seems to do well 'blending' their brews and that has been successful for them. I really want to taste this stout by itself, or at least with something else less-intense than a 19% brew. the sour-stout was a great experiment, and I love this beer (I think) but I think making the Melange 3 with the Black Tuesday was a more 'pristine' act. kind of like marrying a catholic with a protestant, rather than a catholic with a muslim..."

"O: This is an interesting take on a wild sour beer. It's sweeter and more ""full"" than your typical light sour beer without being overly malty. That being said, this isn't every sour-heads cup-of-tea. It doesnt have the oak barrel notes that other sours typically have, and I missed that in this beer. Overall, I think Bruery accomplished what it set out to do."

Very good and worth the high price, in my opinion."

"Overall, a highly overhyped overrated beerÂ  7 bucks for a 6 ounce pour, or 25 bucks a 750?Â  No thanks.Â  This is not in the same league as other sours deserving that price.Â  I just donât understand the Burery hype? Overpriced and under delivered.Â  I think this beer was done as a sour mash and not with bacteria and wood aged.Â  I think this would have been a crazy awesome beer had it been done like a traditional sour in wood barrels, but the layers of flavor and complexity are missing for me.Â "

"Served from bottle into a Bruery tulip. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, massive tart, acidic, wood, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, massive tart, liquorices, wood, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. So they put âtartâ in the name, how tart can it really be? HOLY CHRIST! I should have visited my dentist after having this one to have my enamel checked, because Iâm pretty sure I had NONE left after the first sip. While being really tart it did still manage to hang on to some other smaller aspects to help try to balance this one out. Unfortunately it just fell a little short. Definitely worth your time trying if you LOVE sours, but donât unleash this on your unsuspecting friends unless you want a good laugh or are just plain cruel."

"Overall: An interesting beer and certainly one-of-a-kind, but it's not balanced enough for me. It's probably the most sour beer I've had in quite some time and the stout flavor profile is unrecognizable. If you like your sours to be sour and unbalanced, this is your beer."

"Well, I think this was the first ""Sour Stout"" that I had ever had, and I didn't really know what to expect. But it turns out to be much more Sour than Stout. And man oh man is it sour. Like face squisingly tart. Tart and crisp as pretty much any other sour I've had. Funky fermented smell, lemon, apples and the taste follows almost exactly. The only downside is that it leaves your mouth feeling gritty and weird. Lots of carbonation. Not much of the stout comes through, some mild malts if you really look for it. The sour overpowers pretty much everything else, but not in a bad way. Very good."

"Very sour and puckering, salivary glands get working into overdrive. Traces of roasted malt from the stout base, and some vinous dark fruit.

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, cranberry, red grape, clove, oak, pepper, cocoa, light roast, hay, leather, red wine vinegar, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Incredible aromas with great complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with moderate barrel presence, and a touch of roasted notes; with great strength. Taste of huge sour cherry, cranberry, tart green apple, red grape, pear, clove, oak, light cocoa, light roast, toast, red wine vinegar, leather, funk, and earthy yeast spiciness. Big fruity acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart dark and light fruits, clove, oak, hay, leather, light cocoa, light roast, toast, red wine vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and fruity, earthy, and acidic yeast flavors with a fair amount of roasted presence; with a very nice puckering acidity and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a highly acidic, lightly slick, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is excellent. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible sour ale! All around fantastic complexity and balance of flavors with big sourness; and very smooth to sip on, even with the big acidity. This was hardly representing a stout in malt backbone(no idea on age); but damn was this insane as a sour in general."

"Overall this is an extremely interesting beer. I do not, however, like the sheer intensity of the sourness. I feel this sourness completely overpowers the rest of the beer's flavor profile that is seen (largely) upfront on the palate. The sourness does not entirely dominate every other aspect of this beer but it is certainly the leading aspect of it. The sourness still has many flavors underneath it, of some oak, chocolate, and red grapes, but it upstages the malt body. In conclusion, I would have liked to have seen the sourness turned down a tad; with that being said, I have held on to this bottle for about 6 months so I'm not sure if this would be any less sour when its 'fresh'."

"Poured out looking pretty good, nice dark black color with a light tan head on top. The retention is minimal just leaving a ring around the glass. There wasn't much lacing on this brew either. The smell of packed with sour notes, there is some oak in there as well. The aroma of some dark fruits come out but are quickly overwhelmed by the strength of the sourness. The taste is exactly what the label says, it's tart with a bit of the dark malts in there to balance it out a little. The mouthfeel is dry, tart and a bit thinner than I expected. Overall it's a decent beer, not worth the price tag in my opinion but was nice to share with some people."
""
"Poured into a sampler glass, the ale was an odd black color with hints of magenta streaking through the body. The aroma was a of sour fruits, mostly red berries such a cherries, cranberries and perhaps pomegranate. In the initial taste is where this beer earns some serious points. Like a jolt of electricity, one immediately notices the tart cherries. Other fruits can be detected such as pomegranate and tart cranberries. The creamy vanilla backbone that comes from the oak aging rounds the ale out nicely. It prevents the ale from becoming a sour bomb. The sour fruit continues to tickle the throat in the aftertaste. There is also a slight warming sensation which seems unusual for a 5.6%ABV. The stickiness of the mouthfeel and modest level of carbonation allows aftertaste to linger nicely. This may be the best member of The Bruery line that one can find on store shelves."
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was a tossup between the aroma and the taste, with the latter winning by a hair. From the time you crack the bottle you get this insanely complex, deep, dark, and wild aroma filling your nostrils. The âdarknessâ does get a bit lost here, and if you closed your eyes while whiffing you would be surprised at the beerâs color when you opened them. The taste, however, rectifies this gap. While the funk takes up a large, and continuing, portion of the sip, it leaves enough room for not only the depth and roast of the malts to shine though, but the barrel aging (spent Black Tuesday barrels) as well. The amazing thing is you can actually taste the similarities in the wood, with all that inherent dirt, graphite, and muskiness, without the intense boozy heat all soaked into Black Tuesday. This is a fantastic blend of styles and is extremely well executed. As a warning, the level of tartness and pucker here are quite high, and if you arenât a big fan of the style, expect to be shocked."

"Overall: An exercise in excess; The Bruery takes it to the next level in every regard in this batch of Tart of Darkness; They decided that aging a sour stout in oak barrels wasn't enough, so decided to age the next batch of it in bourbon barrels which have previously held their 19% stout, Black Tuesday. Craziness, but it works very well, overall. Although the roasted malts poke through a bit more in the finish as the ale warms up, I do wish that they poked through the myriad of sour and barrel complexities a bit more assertively. I'd highly recommend this beer to any sour fan in a heart beat. I couldn't ask for a more interesting beer to drink for my 50th review."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wouldn't have thought the sour and stout characteristics would complement one another, but they end up working well together. It's a good beer that's worth trying, though given the price point, I'm not sure it's good enough to justify future purchases."

"Shop near me decided to release some stuff it was originally going to use for a sampling, so good timing was mine that day. Poured it with some Sunday brunch with the wife, and wasn't sure what to expect from my first ""sour stout."" It came out dark, but not black hole dark, more like used motor oil through the light. The light fizz went away very quickly. I didn't notice anything having to do with it being a stout with either smell or taste until it was about an hour in the glass, when some room temp warmth finally brought out the faint smell of a stout. Otherwise, it was all sour cherries, with a start of tart, with tart in the middle, and then a strong finish of tartness. It's wicked sour, but it cleans up nicely and doesn't leave any sort of lingering aftertaste. Overall, it's damn good, but at a pretty pricey purchase level."

"An amazing and unusual ale, I'm glad we were able to find and enoy this one. The sourness is more than I typically can take in a sour ale, but it fades so quickly into such a pleasant roasted coffee, toffee and chocolate finish that I don't mind it. Plus, the tart grows on you as you get further through the beer, such that you're looking for that next hit of sour after it fades away."
""
"Poured a pitch black body it seems, with one finger tan head that died quick. Very tart, vinous aroma, cherries, sour apple, touches of oak and wood, with possibly some sweet malt but I didn't pick them up in the smell. Taste is more of the same in terms of strong tart fruits like cherry, sour apple, maybe dark/black druits, as it is a very tart beer, but a great balance from oak and wood lets it be a little fuller-bodied, almost creamy one could say, and while still a dry, crisp finish (and this is a slow sipper, mind you) it isn't overly tart or bitter. Little touchs of roasted malts and/or dark chocolate sweetness seem to creep in as well and make the difference between just a sour beer/ale and a combo of sour and stout. Not real experienced in this ""sub genre"" of brew but this is a quality beer def worth seeking it out."

"This bottle haunted me for weeks at the local bottle shop. With a 20 dollar price tag staring me down, I kept passing it up. Finally, I had to give in. I knew I'd regret not picking it up. Tart of Darkness pours out a dark brown color with a tiny head. The aroma is absolutely awesome. It's got a strong tart cherry thing going on, along with oak and a vinegar sourness. The taste, again, is fantastic. It's extremely tart straight from the get-go, puckeringly so. There's a bit of roast in the background that quickly gets tossed out the window by a very tart lemon juice thing going on. The finish is lingeringly tart and sour. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability is fantastic. Overall, Tart of Darkness is one of my favorite sours I've had so far, and easily one of the best available in this cursed sour state of Florida."

"This was surprisingly good and although it feels a little unbalanced towards the dark cherry at times, I was pleased to find just enough of that cocoa and roasted flavors to not only be present but act as an active part of the profile as well.The tartness is just mouthwatering here at times. Definitely one to check out if you like sours."
"The best part about it is that I've never had anything like this, but feel like this could be a fun style to see other breweries try out. It's rare to come across something like this that doesn't just end in reach exceeding grasp."

"O- 7/10 sourness. Wow! A very surprising beer. Excellent sour, even tough the dark malts play a very small role in this beer."
""
""
""
"An exceptional sour- very nice tart flavors and aromas with some dark slightly sweet flavors giving the whole thing the same gestalt as a good balsamic. Pours a dark brown, with some decent viscosity and some orange highlights. Not a bad head given the style, but it does fade to nothing after a bit. A little bit of spice complements the tangerine tartness and richer umami flavors. Quite well done and very drinkable. I was tempted to blend some with the Stone Vertical Epic 12 for a Christmas trifle effect. A very good beer."

"This beer LOOKS beautiful, but I dunno, guys. I like funky and I like sour; loved the Oude Tart. But this is Warheads sour. If there was ever a stout in there, it has vanished beneath the aggressive, lemon-juicy sourness. I don't see how anyone could call this ""balanced""--the sour is so strong that it takes over everything. Seriously, you could make vinaigrette with just this beer and some olive oil."
"Dark brown, almost black with a cream coloured head. Light retention and OK lacing. Nose is tart, dark berries, some chocolate and even a bit of roast perhaps. Taste has roast, light smokey malt with tart berries character overlying these. Acidic finish, and this carries on for quite some time. Medium body, medium carbonation. Too tart for everyone else who it was shared with, but I quite enjoyed this beer."
""
""
"O: such an awesome brew all the way around. still pretty new to the sour tasting comparatively speaking, but this one is immensely sour and has an awesome balance. definitely a must try."
""
""
""

"O- Interesting and complex brew and at only 5.6% ABV you can enjoy the whole bottle. Not one I would want a lot of but I did like it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty intense brew. A roller coaster ride of flavor descends into a dry finish that may fatigue the faint of heart, if they're not careful. Would drink again, but would just like to have some forewarning..."
"O: Not going to lie this is one hard bastard to down by one's self. Like sucking down 24oz. of lemon juice. Its level of sourness is balls to the wall but its range of flavor and stout qualites leave much to be desired. Like dropping lemon juice into a schwarz bier. Thier Flanders was a fine example, managable sourness and exceptional to style, this was a sour with a misleading stout labeling. Your gonna have to split this with a friend, or two, or three."
""
"overall an excellent beer even if it wasn't that complex due to the sour domination."
""
"Light to medium body and heavily carbonated, but more champagne like with ample fine carbonation that keeps the tongue fresh. Pretty easy to drink and enjoyable, but not that interesting."
""
""
""
"O: Would I drink it everyday? No. But it is a damn tasty beer, and is a nice change from the standard beer-fare. The brown/black ale characteristics play nicely with the sour fruit to keep them both in check."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, jet black pour with a medium white head. The aroma is acidic, vinergary, sour. The first sip is very sour, notes of cherries, definitely sour, not much stout. The body is medium, highly acidic, pleasantly tart. A very tasty sour, a little overpriced IMO at 21 bucks, but very tasty."

"Overall this beer is awesome, a genre bender and I appreciate that. Not a dull moment, great complexity yet easy enough to drink. Would gladly buy if I see it for sale."
"Pours dark black with brown edges and a thin ivory ring and very wispy haze. Nice aromas of tart vinegar, cranberries, dark malt, and a touch of chocolate. Really nice, definitely reminds me a bit of Oude Tart. Taste is similarly tart, with more vinegar, cranberry, oak, dark chocolate, and red berries. Mouthfeel is definitely puckering, with a medium body, good carbonation, and a dry finish. Really neat beer, always stoked to try something different."

"The body sits an ink black with a bubbly tan head. The head fell quickly, forming a thin collar with some dots of lace. The nose is intensely sour. Tons of lactic sourness with black cherries, oak, cocoa, and leather. On the palate, huge lactic acid and cherries assault the palate. Oak tannins, leather, cocoa, and roast are all secondary. Medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Puckering finish, extremely dry. Lingering sour notes with dry oak and mild roast. This is a winner. The base stout has been transformed considerably by the bugs. This guy definitely lives up to its name."
""
"Dark leathery brown with some tam foam. Smells of molasses with a sour cherry and some lemon skin. Flavor is a nice, well less stout, but more brown ale with a good amount of clean plumy, lemon, lactic and cocoa, coffee, some vinegrated character. I'm really impressed with how much I like this. Fuck. Nice medium bodied with sharp and resonant carb with a dry finish. Nice beer. Really nice beer."

"I enjoyed the hell out of this beer, but don't get them marketing it as a sour stout when it's about 99% sour and 1% stout. Well made, but definitely a sour. Still went down very smooth."
""

"A respectable beer considering the amount of this they brewed this year. Tart of Darkness is hardly The Bruery's best work, but if everything they make is at least this good from here on out, that's a resounding win for the craft beer world."
"Pours deep black/brown with a brown bubbly head that fizzes away quickly leaving just a ring. Nose is sour black cherries, red grapes, tart green apples, plums, a bit of roastiness and just a slight hint of chocolate. There may also be just the slightest notes of oak in the back. The nose is tart but not in your face. The tartness of the flavor, however, is a punch in your tongue's face. Acidic without burning, cherries, plums, some berries (black and maybe raspberries too), pears, apples, some lemon and a hint of lime in the aftertaste. The roasted malts and other stout characteristics are there but hardly. All the tart, wild flavors are balanced ever so slightly by a lingering roastiness, but its not there nearly as much as you'd think for a stout. There's also a so subtle bit of oak but again you kind of have to search for it. I love sours, so I love this but I want to find a sour stout with a bit more ""stout"" to it. This and Jolly Pumpkin's Madrugada Obscura are very similar in that the sour qualities dominate excessively. Still an excellent brew though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue. I've had sour stouts before and hated them, but this was pretty tasty."
""
""
"Overall It is dark very true, and truly TART. Would love to try this again sometime, I am wondering if this could have been better."
""
""
"This was just disappointing to me. It julfilled it's sour obligations, but didn't do anything to expand upon that aspect. Meh."
"One of the best offerings from The Bruery to date. A nice blend of tart and roasty without the overbearing sweetness and aggression I expect from The Bruery."
""
""
"O: a nice sour overall. Not the most complex, but simple and delicious."
""
"Overall: Intensely complex and extremely well put together.  It's impressive how the roast is present but not astringent with the dry finish.  (4.55)"

"My man Ryan was raving about this beer, so I felt I just had to grab a bottle while I still could, if for no other reason than to see what the hubbub was about. It pours a deep black-sienna, nearly completely opaque, topped by a fleeting half-finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa powder, vinegar, tart berries, light roasted malts, and a touch of maple syrup way in the back. The taste leads with the vinegar, rolls seamlessly into some tart berries and fruits (lots o' lemon on the back-end), then, just when you think this is just some sour, some roast and cocoa soften things up a bit before a haymaker of slightly metallic tartness finishes things off. Animality! The body is a straight medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a decidedly enjoyable sour stout, possibly the best of the genre I've yet had."
""
""
""
"This is the best sour stout I've ever had. Serious bonus points for this. And it might be the best beer I've ever had from The Bruery. It's nicely sour, nicely tart, and has a nice malt base. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent wild ale that will definitely satisfy your tart urges. Highly recommend if you like tart. Not avail here - got from Hoss! Rotation - wish I could get some more to age as I'd like to see how it develops."
""
""
""
"O: By far, the best Oaked sour stout I've tried... but it was my first also"
"Surprisingly sour but unfortunately loses all Stout qualities. Good sour, bad Stout."
"O: I guess this is a perfect manifestation of the morbid American fascination with all things sour. In this case (gratuitous pun inbound!) I guess it all turned a little sour. All in all a little too extreme for what I think they were going for. Good effort, but that's just about everything I can say really."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"O/D-For $21 bucks (750 ml) this better be a damn good beer. It delivered. It nearly reached my ""Top-Tier"" level but fell just short. I found it to be delectable, but it ever-so-slightly faltered in terms of depth and complexity. Regardless, I will blow this back and be happy. Quite the gem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice sour, just don't really see where the stout comes into play here. Consumed without seeing the color, I would never have pegged it a sour/stout."
""
""
"I haven't had too many sour beers (they're scarce in this part of the country), but this one is certainly the sourest beer I have had to date. If you're a fan of extremely sour beers, you should seek this one out and try it at least once. If you've never had a sour beer, I would not suggest making this your first one. I found it to be pleasant to drink, but I prefer more balanced, moderately sour beers. This one is so tart it overwhelms my palate. I did enjoy it, but given the price of this beer, I probably won't buy it again. If I did, I would let it age for a while, just to see if any of the sourness melded with the other flavors a little better."
"O: I'm starting to love great sour ales, and this is a great sour ale. It's nicely sour, yet not overbearingly oppressive in its dry oakiness. A must try, just expect it to be more sour than stout."
""
""
"O-This beer somehow manages to come together in a very unique and interesting presentation. I enjoy the flavor profile but it is almost too sour and not balanced enough for all the flavors to come out. I would have like to have seen more stout on this but instead I feel like I have just any other wild ale dyed black."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, although the thick layer of chunky off-white sediment that formst on the bottom of the glass is a little strange. Overlooking that, though, this was thoroughly enjoyable, and recommended."
""
"O-an interesting sour stout, strange combination but it works for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Warning: The sourness dominates this beer. According to the bottle, this beer is actually brewed as a stout before being barrel aged with wild yeasts. However, the stout character is very faint. Don't buy this beer expecting a stout."
"Overall, a really nice, tart and complex sour. I really liked the mix of sour notes with some bourbon and stout backing notes that were truly background notes. The low ABV really worked well too in making the sour notes and stout notes come together without any harsh booze character. Very refreshing a drinkable. Definitely worth the price of a bottle. Glad I got one to age."
""
""
"overall: just not my thing"
""
""
"O- A very different sour offering that should be tried at least once. The dark malt adds some balance, but is not extremely noticeable."
"Hugely unique. Try this beer."
""
"The nose is an 50/50 even split between roasted malt / coffee and soured tart raspberry / cherry aroma. The oak wood... doesn't register in the smell until after the glass has warmed up somewhat, but when it does, the resulting combination in the aroma is quite wonderful to smell. Flavor is unfortunately about 85/15 between sourness and stout, which is not as close to the nose's proportions as I had hoped. The bright and puckery sour acidic cherry / oak wood blast masks out the great majority of the roasted flavor, and I am left with a soured ale that uses a whisper of roast as a garnish. Don't get me wrong, it works, but a bit more ""darkness"" on the tongue would have been appreciated."
""
""
"O: Overall I like this one quite a bit. Love the idea, but could be a little thicker in my opinion. Also, a little over priced."
"Overall this is a good dark sour but I have had two better in the last month. It is too one-noted and generically sour cherry brett-forward. It lacks the complexity of Weyerbacher Sour Black that had awesome red wine notes and more roasted malt flavor in the background. It also lacks the sourness that Capt Lawrence Barrel Select Black has which is just crazy sour mixed with lightly roasted malts. This is just a but too generic for the hefty price and won't be in my regular rotation anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: And with that, a new favorite emerges in the world of sours. Even though it was a damned expensive bottle and the balance was shifted more toward sour than anything, to me, every ounce is worth its weight in gold. Superb."
"O- This beer is good but not great. The price point of the beer is a bit high for simply a good beer. I would buy again if this beer was around $14 a bottle."
""
"Overall: Nice play on ""sour stout."" Less going on than in most stouts or sour ales, but to such a degree that it fails to be a good beer. I know the Bruery can do better than this, but I'd buy another bottle if the price was right."
""
""
""
"Overall a unique beer, reminds me most of a Flanders oud bruin. Enjoyable and tasty, but not sure it justified the high price tag."
"o - Overall I liked this a lot. I hadn't heard great things about Batch 1 (which I have yet to try but have 1 bottle of), and had heard good things about Batch 2, and I was very happy with it. Maybe the BT barrels helped this one, but it is a very sour beer with roasted notes to it, and one of the better ""sour stouts"" I've had. Glad to have a few bottles of this and looking forward to trying the 2 batches side by side."
""
""
"O-this pretty much just drinks like an American wild ale with a twist of darkness to it. It's freaking awesome!! It's good enough that I'm going out and buying a few more bottles if I can find them! Its awesome. The tastes are powerful and great tasting"
""
"3.5 D: I'm starting to feel that the Bruery should start making artisanal vinegars instead of wild ales. Most of the stuff they make is acetic acid-forward. While still good, I'm more of a fan of complex funk (which is why I choose 3F over Cantillon most of the time). In any case, I'm glad I have a few more since this will definitely scratch the acetic sour itch that I get occasionally."
""
""

"Pours out what looks to be brown, but when held up to the light has a lovely reddish hue. Little head which dissipated quickly. Prunes and coffee on the nose, with of course, the wonderful vinegar blast of a well made sour. Nice palate cleansing astringency. Sweet and sour at the same time...Nice! I nice bubble on the mouthfeel, with a little syrupy coating. I love sours and this is very good one."
"O: excellent beer and very interesting as well. Glad to finally try it. Good out hopbrizio"
""
""

""
""
"O- A solid sour that is very tasty. I had a small sample at a tasting about a year ago and wasn't the biggest fan of this, but now I am really liking this beer. Only real problem with this beer is that I would have liked more of a sour stout and not just a sour."
"O: A truly interesting beer and one that I highly enjoy. Would recommend. Will drink again."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. In a blind taste testing, I dont think you would initially be able to tell how dark this brew is. But as it warms up and more sips are taken, the darkness reveals itself with some characteristics that really play nice with the vinous/tart cherry elements. Sour fans will really enjoy this. Get out there and get yourself a bottle if you haven't had it yet."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied, but not like stout at all. Watery."
"Pours a dark brown, light rusty copper tint, some particles, little head. Scent leads with vinegar tartness, light roast, cherry and dark bread. Taste brings a quick hit of vinegar, then some roasted malts with a hint of chocolate, muted cherry, dark bread, light oak. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Taste develops more as it approaches room temperature. Solid beer."
""
""
"O: This is a good American Wild ale, not a ton of complexity after getting over the lacto , white wine and oak flavors but after turning down last year in RS, glad to have tried it this year."

"o - overall i had my doubts on this one but after a buddy told me how blown away he was by it, i had to give it a try and glad i did while it is still around so i can get more. what a nice surprise. this new trend of dark sours are really enjoyable. seems to be pretty polarizing, but i can't really understand why...unless a lot of people aren't into sours who are trying this. if you like sour beer, you'll like this. nicely done."
"Tart of Darkness pours out a very black color, not jet black but black enough. A good skim of tan bubbles forming a smooth cap up top, some sticking on the glass surprisingly. The scent is pretty straight forward, some roast and some bugs, I don't pick up any oak or the such, just lacto and the guys. Small traces of cocco and tootsie roll with warming and some faint malt. Wow, this is a sour beer, I thought this would be easy, yet the sour is pumped up. I get a lot of lactic feeling with some berry, blackberry, roast malt, cocco, tootie roll etc. While sour, it's not an integrated sour that leads to a satisfying finish. I get battery acid on the tounge with tartness, small relief from the small stout base. Body is a step up from light. Eye opening. While I appreciate the effort and base style used in this, I just could not drink a ton of it."
""
""
"This is quite a beer, I was very impressed with how tart and tasty this beer was, awesome."
""
"Hands-down one of the most tart brews I've ever had!! Very sour and very enjoyable, refreshing for a summer day. I was scared the brew would be similar to a rotten stout, but it's not even close. Tart of darkness is like a black ale minus the hops. Highly recommended for the true sour fan ONLY!"
""
""
"O: god damn is this beer tart, and appropriately named, tart as a mother and dark chocolate coffe like goodness, another awesome sour from the bruery."
"O - It's tart. If you like tart. Acidic. I have yet to have Mother Funker, but they say it is the most sour beer many have tried, and if it is more so than this it will be just crazy."
"Surprisingly tasty beer! Pours a dark brown glass that is actually transparent in small quantities. Little carbonation even right out of the bottle. The aroma is reminiscent of burnt toast. The coffee in the nose lends it the smell of a stout. Also present in the nose are some sour cherries. A suprisingly complex nose. The taste has a really nice and mellow sourness that makes it dangerously easy to drink. The carbonation is light so the mouthfeel is pleasant. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I would drink it again."
"An interesting beer, but just not my cup of tea. One and done for me I think..."

"Tart of Darkness pours stout black, with about two fingers of light mocha foam crowning the beer. Head retention is brief and there's not really any lacing left behind. The nose has a little bit of roast to it, and a little bit of earthy funk, but it's very much dominated by a sharp, almost fruity tartness. The flavor profile opens with some contributions from the base stout with some chocolate and lightly roasty notes. The brett and bugs did their work well on this beer, as there is again a light bit of funk and a whole lot of acidity. It's not the most tart beer I've had from The Bruery, but it's damn close. A bit of oak and some smooth bourbon come in for the finish. The body has a little bit more heft than your typical wild ale, but less than you'd expect for a stout, and the in between nature of it does a good job of supporting the malty base beer while allowing plenty of room for the wild characteristics. The carbonation leans a little bit towards the low end of the spectrum. I got six bottles of Tart of Darkness through the Reserve Society this year, and initially planned on offering a couple bottles for trade or to friends. After cracking my first one though, I may just have to keep them all for myself."

"The beer really rests on the sour tones, and they are up front and out there. The stout is a very minor player in this, if much at all. It just provides a thicker body on the ale, by just a little bit. The sour tones though really take the cake here, and frankly, provide a bit of a one dimensional ride. But that is fine with me, as it is a nice beer. I can suggest this one."
""
"Note:  Revisiting the 2014 version, I find the beer has more of a vinous character, with a range of lactic berry flavors joining the cherry and I don't find as much of the chocolate or smoke from the earlier version; quite a good beer, but also different from what I remember"
"Overall what I'd expect from a dark sour. Some smokiness and dark fruit. Nice complexity with a solid feel. Decent but really not my favorite style."
""
""
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of dark fruit and chocolate, with some roasted malt thrown in. I don't get much tartness or sourness in the aroma, but that all changes when I take a sip. There is a nice tart dark fruit character, which is complimented nicely by some chocolate and heavily roasted malt. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

""
"Some head on the pour, but recedes quickly. Dark, dark color. Smooth chocolate and cherry, and very sour. Body is surprisingly light, if I couldn't see the beer I wouldn't have thought it was a dark beer at all."
"Pours an almost opaque dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour grape and cherry aromas along with some dark malt notes. Taste is pretty much the same with a very grape-like aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some interesting smells and flavors."
""
""
"This is quite vinous in the end, and is really quite tasty. I didnât expect to like this as much as I have, and I certainly wish I had quite a few more bottles of this than I do; though I am going to quite enjoy the two other bottles that I have of this (assuming I can keep them away from my wife who has really taken a shine to this beer)."
"Overall: The stout element is overbearing, I assume it is some blend of Oude Tart and something else."
"A well-balanced interesting take on the sour category. One of the more complex sours I have had for some time."
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan fluffy head. Dark fruit, roast, and some oak notes in the nose. Light mouthfeel. Much more sour than I would have anticipated. Dark fruit tart sour flavors gives way to a slight roast note that lingers. Nice lacing. Overall, this is a solid dark sour, light and refreshing with a nice sourness and roast level."
""
"Tart of Darkness takes after a good portion of Black IPAs currently on the market, in that it has the color of a stout or porter without lending much of the corresponding flavor. The upside is that the sour notes are mighty tasty, and its ABV and body make it very drinkable. Another good sour from the Bruery."

But it works here, presumably because this isn't a blend, but rather a properly inoculated stout. I feel that some tweaks could bring out the nuances of the stout base more, but it's excellent for a first attempt at this style."

"The beer is dark, walnut brown with an oily tan head. The aroma brings funk, wild yeast, cherries. It smells a bit like Russian River Consecration. More like a wild ale than a stout. Light and easy drinking, with sufficient tartness. Sour cherries, wild yeast, oak. A really tasty beer. Assertive acetic quality throughout. I would definitely have this again."
"Beer is thin in body, very sour, very acetic, interesting, I don't think anyone would think this used to be a stout at all. Very good, quite enjoyable, I really like this beer."
"I'm not sure if this entire batch was soured or if it were blended with a sour beer, but I think using the latter approach with a bit less sourness would be outstanding."
"The beer pours a dark brown with glimmers of ruby when held up to the light. A finger of light brown foam floats atop the dark hued liquid. Minimal lacing. Aromas of roasted malt and sour cherries combine in a pretty incredible nose. Taste opens witha blast of tart cherry acidity. Wow! This is exquisitly tart! Initial pucker gives way to a complex malt profile that features notes of roasted malt, coffee and vanilla. The finish is tart, dry and acetic. A prickly level of carbonation contributes to a lighter body, making the beer extremely drinkable. I really like this offering from The Bruery. Tart, tasty and refreshing. Hopefully they will add this brew to their regular rotation. Highly recommended."
"A pretty excellent effort from the Bruery here, significantly better than the last two I had from them (Sour in the Rye and Melange #1), which were both undrinkable. The only other similar beer that comes to mind immediately is Jolly Pumpkin's Dark Dawn Stout, which, when on, is better, but recent batches of which have been disappointing."
"O - Really enjoyable and so easy to drink. A nice 5% beer with lots going on, which is so nice. Would def drink this one again!"
"O - Surprisingly great beer for something I wasn't initially interested in. Great taste and at 5% can drink it for a while."
"This is a simple beer, a great beer, leave it at that."
"O- An interesting beer and my first sour stout. Has some nice barnyard funk accompanied by roasted malt and dark fruits that can be found in stouts."
"Pours a really dark brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light. Smallish tan head recedes rather quickly leaving minimal lace. Smells of tart cherries, raspberries and lemons mostly. Faint hints oak, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar, but this one is all about the tart. Taste is heavy on the lemons up front, a bit of cherry and apricot midway through then a slightly chalky taste near the finish. Bone dry sour patch kids kind of finish. Tart and chalky mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation, medium body. Besides the color I would never have guessed this was a stout as it retains almost none of its attributes. That said this is damn fine sour beer, lots of tart fruit and mouth puckering going on with this one."
"Trying to review this to style without slamming it. Mahogony pour with a short lived beige head into a tulip glass. Not at all black or thick looking. Aroma yields no stout characteristics, but plenty of woody sourness. Mouthfeel is quite thin. No roastiness, no coffee, chocolate, or any of the other flavors I associate with stouts. Much more in line with a sour Flanders, similar to a La Folie. All in all, this beer is quite like a Flanders brown or red ale. Comparing this to its closest counterpart, Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura, this falls short in that it has zero stout characters. All of that being said, it is a glorious light bodied sour, puckering and mouth drying, and quite delicious."
"O: Much better than I was anticipating--probably the first ""sour stout"" I've truly enjoyed."
"D/O: Without a doubt this beer is one of the most carefully crafted sours yet experienced from the Bruery--this has the feel of an experiment gone very right. While the flavors are metered, impressing in their restraint, the textural qualities carry some wow factor. While it is surprisingly full-bodied for a beer of very ordinary strength, not to mention for a sour, things go awry as the acidity is allowed to build to uncomfortable levels at the back of the throat. Misdemeanors aside, this beer represents an interesting collision of wood and sourness in an approachable package. Advice to Placentia's Bruers-in-residence: put Humulus Lager in six-packs, then do the same to this beer."
"Thanks cavery and brother; most generous. Poured from the bottle a dark reddish brown/nearly black color with a good brown head. Aromas of bourbon, red wine, vinegar, dark chocolate and roasted malt. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and very tart/sour, with flavors of roasted malt, bourbon, red wine, dark chocolate and cocoa."
"Very good, easily the best sour stout I have ever had."
"D - Other than the meaty note in the aroma this is quite good. I really enjoyed this beer and think it's one of the few Bruery offerings that actually belongs in a 750ml bottle. Would like to try this again and see how the sourness develops over time."
"O - I like this beer...decent sour ale, but really not much of a stout. Would definitely have this again."
"D - good, but not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a stout with a bit of tartness; what I got was the exact opposite. Worth a shot but I don't think I would go out of my way to trade for it."
"Pours a pitch black with a medium, tan head. Scent is tannic sour notes with vinegar and hints of chocolate. Slight oak aromas and a little bit of funk, but not too much (is there such thing as too much funk?). Taste starts out with mouth-puckering sour flavors...cherries? Not nearly as much coffee or chocolate as I was expecting. Much more sour than I was expecting, which is always a good thing. Finishes with some funky cherry/raspberry flavors. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a puckering finish. Drinkability is HIGH! Overall, this is another amazing beer from The Bruery...it's just so hard to keep up with these guys considering all the fantastic beer they're putting out in such little spans of time. I wish I had more of this beer..."
"A phenomenal sour stout. Please, make this again!"
"O: Good, I enjoyed it. The sour notes were not too intense (which for me I like) and the stout notes still come through, though are mild. Will hold onto the other bottle I have an age for short time, as the bottle indicates it can age, so will give that a shot with this one."
"(O) It was tough to wrap my head around a sour stout when I first heard of them, and now that I've tried one, I get it. It's still more of a sour beer, but it definitely has the stout flavors to add in to it. This beer (just as Clutch and other sour stouts) kind of stand in a style of their own."
"Pours very dark brown with an off-white head. Looks fine. The nose is funky cherry fruit, oak and maybe some port. It smells decent enough. I get almost none of the 'stout' other than the slightest touch of roasted/chocolate malts. This beer tastes like a pretty normal sour beer. If you closed your eyes, you would have a hard time telling me that this was a stout that was soured. Pretty strong flavors of tart cherry. Acidic and highly carbonated. Dry and light in body. Just pretend it is a run-of-the-mill sour and use that as your guide as to whether you are interested."
"I have to say we all had the same consensus on this beer: extremely weird but it totally works. The stout elements don't overpower nor compete with the funky, tart nature of the beer instead provide a nice base for the other flavors to come through. You get those rich, roasted qualities in the back end and you certainly must like sours to enjoy this beer."
"Pours a dark dark brown. Almost black. A nice bit of light tan head. smells pretty tart. Almost like a sweet tart. Tastes malty and crisp. The tart sourness is very clean. Very highly carbonated. Crisp tart sourness that is lightly fruity. Cherry perhaps? Pretty enjoyable."
"(D)- Very unique and tasty. This really is a style of its own. Uniquely sour, yet still carries a great stout profile. Its confusing yet absolutely delightful at the same time. More please."
"Pours a brown color with light edges. Head is minimal, you can stir up a few bubbles but nothing really to see here. Smell is outstanding. Loads of sour fruit, like pomegranate, lemon, bacteria funk. A hint of roast peeks its head out, but if you close your eyes, you would think this is a blonde sour. The flavor is great, lots of acid and a decent body. Again, the only reason to even call this a stout is the color and malts, the flavor lends itself to a very bright sour style. Awesome taste. Mouthfeel is nice up front, but the finish is a little thin and leaves some harsh acid as the beer warms. They are right on the bottle, 56-60 degrees and this beer shines, room temp and it loses a lot of its desireable character. Definitely one worth trying and I hope to score some more for the basement."
"Overall, awesome stuff. Really interested to see how this develops due to the low ABV, but I suspect it will age nicely for 1-2 years."
"opaque black with a huge tan head on top. Great rings of lace forming all around it. Huge smell of tartness, perhaps raspberries or just straight yeast, but there is a fruit like character to it, chocolate and caramel, vanilla and hints of wood and with some kinda weird dark fruitiness that seems to accentuate the tart flavor. Flavor was huge, after the assault of chocolate dipped raspberries and cherry, a ton of roasted malts, lots of caramel and lactose were really strong on this.. Very sugary and full. A slight taste of cookie dough in the finish"
"O: A nice stout. Sour stout is pretty rare aside from Madrugada Obscura. I liked this effort though it's pretty pricey."
"Overall-- not bad. I could drink this... but it isn't one I'll seek out. It's a bit like Sour in the Rye for me--- it's a beer that isn't bad, but it isn't going crazy over!"
"O- Bruery nailed the head on what it takes to make a sour stout. This is a perfect example."
"Good beer teetering on great. Complex yet easy to drink. I am getting more and more into sours. In a year, I might think it is a great beer."
"O - I love this beer. It's very different, and I hope to see more of this style around. I could drink this beer all day if that was an option. My only gripe is the price on this beer."
"SkÃL!"
"Quite enjoyable. Definitely recommended for sour fans."
"O - I like it. A sessionable sour."
"O: Good well made beer, I would have it again."
"O - Good. I am generally not into sours but I really like this beer."
"Overall â A wonderful beer. Very glad I was able to try this (and a big shout out to mrmiles for giving me this as an extra) and am very happy to have a few more to age for a year or two. Recommended."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Very sour, leaning heavily toward clean lactic sourness. The stout base is still surprisingly prevalent, lending some nice roasty and bready notes. It's an intriguing mix of flavors. There's a touch of cherry-like fruitiness and barrel in here, but it's buried beneath the lacto and roasted malt. Very unique stuff, I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Overall: If you go in thinking this is a stout you will be let down because this is essentually a sour made with black patent or chocolate malt or roasted barley. It looks like a stout and that is about it. If you are a fan of sours you will appreciate this beer."
"O: This was super interesting, I definitely recommend trying it. There are tastier stouts out there, but this one is very unique and complex. Very glad to have tried this and big applause to the bruery for such a bizarre and fascinating beer. If you love to ponder a beer and defuse it, look forward to some hours spent on this."
"O: I wasn't ready for a beer like this, but I also assumed it was possible. This was a very challenging drink in terms of palate exploration. First off, you have very strong associations with specific beer styles that seem to converge in this beer. On one end you have a flanders oude bruin, and on the other you have a stout. In this beer, you get imperial stout flavors in a flanders oude brown sensory experience. Not only is it quite literally that, but new flavors emerge in the simultaneous experience of both styles. Blueberries emerge between tart sweetness and coffee roastiness. Blackberries creep up behind the drying up flavors of the blueberries. This is new and exciting for me. Such discipline in maintaining the integrity of two totally different styles, yet deconstructing them in a way that it becomes possible to combine them. I applaud this effort loudly, and I think The Bruery's craft is second to none in the American Beer movement. They are at the top with a select few other breweries, and this beer is yet another piece of compelling evidence in the assertion of that fact."
"My boy Nevins came through with this bottle. We both agreed if you close your eyes you'd think this was a Cantillon. Some sort of blend between a stout and a Geuze. A black Geuze. Simply amazing. Not alot of barnyard funk in the nose as this is pretty young still but tons of sour. How did they do it? I'd say a bit more body than say Cantillon Geuze and a very faint (toffee) sweetness is hiding way in the corners. Wish I had more of this bad boy for the beer cellar."
"Narrative: Walter Chambers wasnât the best pharmacy technician. He wasnât the best mortician either. Somehow it was his relentless work ethic that kept him powering through both occupations day in and day out. After a solid 3 hours of sleep, he would saunter in, smelling of formaldehyde, dark circles under his eyes. âYeah, carâ¦car problems andâ¦so did we get that Abilify shipment come in?â His dark wrinkled suit had strange stringent notes that wafted through the CVS pharmacy. âWALTER!â He snapped out of a brief nap and realized that he could see his breath in the ice cold body preparation room. âWalter, I told you to prep the gauze wrap and you go off for a sno-â Walter slipped back into blackness."
"Overall im impressed by this one. Didn't think much of it at first glance but I'm glad I picked it up to try."
"O: Really a solid beer and one of the Bruery's better sours to this point."
"Overall: Even though I do detect some slight roast notes, personally I'm categorizing this as a Wild Ale. A very unusual damn tasty one."
"Pretty good deal to at ~$15 for a 750. Wish I bought more. This is my favorite new beer of 2011 so far."
"All together a very tasty beer, any sour craving will be quenched with this batch # 2."
"I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised by this. Only slightly heavier than a ""standard"" sour, it is a complex, robust addition to the breed."
"Opening my first bottle of Bruery's Tart of Darkness I wasn't sure what I was going to think but I love all things sour and all things Bruery so I had to load up. This is amazing. It pours a dark, deep brown with a finger of head which quickly dissipates. The aroma is of sourness, almost vinegary. This is a truly sessionable stout, not huge like a certain other Bruery stout but if you love sours you would be able to drink this all night long. There is so much sourness going on that I don't get much else. There is some malt that is noticeable but this is largely about the sour. This is an amazing beer. I'm going to have to go back for whatever the Provisions store will let me buy."
"Drink- Damn, This was so different but so tasty. So glad there is a 2nd bottle in the cellar on this one. Well crafted indeed."
"O - Very good beer. Not the best that I have had, but definitely worth a buy. Adding the American Wild Ale funk in with the traditional stout tastes could take some acquiring to, but I personally liked the meld."
