Light lemon and oranges filter through as a tropical coconut finishes. The flavor is delicious but perhaps not assertive enough.","KYGunner","Mar 15, 2015"

Nose has a wonderful brett character with hay, lemon peel, underripe pear, slight breadiness. Flavor is delicate tartness with some citrus, touch of funk, white grapes. Body is a little light, but this is so quaffable. A beautifully done brett farmhouse. Among my favorites.","jbwimer","Jan 16, 2015"

Lemongrass, apple cider vinegar, sharp little funky sour note.  Light bodied ale, lacks true crispness or dryness, mellow feel.

3.15,-22.8,4.5,4.5,2.5,3,2.5,"While the nose promised an excessive funkiness, the taste is comparably tame. It begins with white lemon peel, among bready malts and a gentle, strawy, wheat foundation. The carbonation is very lively, pointing out the refreshing sour qualities, while the actual sourness remains quite moderate, hiding beneath the wheat. Got a green apple fruitiness, as well as a yoghurty of flavor to it, which shines during the semi-dry, but not particular sour finish. Drinks fairly easy, very smooth for a Sour, while trying a little too hard to stay in balance, by not providing a convincing acidic sourness.","aleigator","Dec 27, 2014"

3.87,-5.1,,,,,,"Bottle as an extra in trade. Thanks! Pours hazy bright yellow with a big fluffy white head. Lots of tart funky Brett on the aroma, hay, light fruits, more funk. Yup, it's a Brett beer. Extremely light bodied, very little oak or vinous notes from the wine barrels, but with a refreshing funky bretty influence that makes it very pleasant. Super light fruit sweetness. High carbonation. All in all this is nice, but maybe even too light on the flavor. Definitely worth a try for Brett fans.","BMMillsy","Nov 27, 2014"

The smell is a little tropical with a dry and grainy feel before cheesy notes of funk evolve. The taste is dry with neutral grain flavoring, slightly husky, blending to notes that are mildly tropical and vinous. Some oakiness towards the back has almost a cinnamin spice note about it. This is light bodied, modestly carbonated and very easy drinking. The beauty in this beer is the subtle nuance but I dont think I liked it enough to want to seek out any more.","stakem","Oct 01, 2014"

The flavor dials up the floral notes a touch, reminiscent of Orval, but less intense and with an added apple and grape juicy tartness and some oatmeal-like grain.  Tart, but not excessively so, and not so funky as the aroma.  Dry and super refreshing.  Second pour with the yeast is less funky and more floral.

Lots of lemon zest in the nose and the taste follows suit. The funk is very mild, so I see why some folks aren't fully behind this brew; however, IMO, this is probably the best introduction to sours I've ever had. I've turned a couple people on to this brew... who have already embraced the style and tried much more tart offerings they wouldn't have touched otherwise. I could drink this all day... and maybe I will.","Mantooth","Jul 27, 2014"

4.08,0,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"my second and another stellar beer from wicked weed. this is a little more basic than the sour ipa, just a funky bretty wheat based brew, done in white wine barrels. its a really pale brew, frosted blonde with a great big white head with nice thick foam lace left behind. it smells like something out of crooked stave of jolly pumpkin, a curious bacterial and brett culture than really makes the mouth water. there is a real light wheat malt here, and the yeast does the vast majority of the flavoring. plenty of oak and white grape character from the barrel, earthy and funky, which meshes with the yeast really well. its not super complex, but its interesting enough, not lacking anything, but a heavy dry hop with a cool varietal could make this even better i think. light on the hop character as it is. acidic more from the wine barrel than the yeast i think, but a pleasant dry tartness finishes it out. carbonation is interesting. its active but not poppy, feather light feeling, just gentle and comfortable. overall a beer i would love to age a little and let develop, but one thats drinking awfully well right now. a good first few offerings from these guys, really fun stuff they are doing.","StonedTrippin","May 26, 2014"

Smell is sour with malt, grain, lemon, acidic, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt, grain, Brett, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but seems to have a more sour aspect in the aroma to me.","UCLABrewN84","May 25, 2014"

4.16,2,4.25,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,"I see this beer developing into a real treasure in another 6-12 months; maybe even longer. All the reviews I have seen show people complaining that it isn’t funky our sour enough for them. Honestly, this tastes just like it should. It is not a wild ale. It is a Saison aged in wine barrles with Brett, and it smells and tastes liek it should. People get so upset when a style isn’t what they think it should be. It is in the ballpark of the style and a wonderful introductory offering from Wicked Weed in terms of bottle options. Search it out with confidence","ironchefmiyagi13","May 08, 2014"

Similar flavor, finishing with a mild puckering sensation. Fairly light in body. A touch of earthiness with tart citrus. Overall, a tasty beer.","Huhzubendah","Mar 31, 2014"
