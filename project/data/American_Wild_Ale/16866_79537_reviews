"Looks like pink liquid bread. Smell is that classic Bruery smell, taste is addicting. It's not the most sour, most, cherry-like, or best interpretation of a traditional Kriek. But it's damn good nonetheless."

"O: A clean and enjoyable cherry sour. Great funk on the nose that reminds me of the Belgians, but sadly this didn’t carry over to the taste as well as the greats of the style. Solid all-around though."

"Damn if this is not a traditional Lambic Kriek.  Incredibly well done, and spot on for the style.  I was really impressed with this, and highly recommended.  Exactly why I put up with the lows of the Bruery.  Because the highs are this good."

"Excluding the aroma, this offering hits the target on all aspects: Light and refreshing with tart cherry flavors, only the faint sulfuric aroma prevents this from being a top-notch sour."

"Pretty good stuff. The tart cherry complements and smooths out the sour. Not something I'll hunt for more of but nice enough that II enjoyed this try."

"overall a lip puckering sour. i dig those but maybe not for everyone."
""
""
""

"Pours almost the color if pink grapefruit juice with no head to speak of. Smell has sour cherry, oak and a hint of vanilla. Taste a nice mix of tart and bittersweet but not overpowering with mostly cherry and acidic fruit notes."

"Cloudy blonde body with nice white head in the glass. I'm not picking up much from the nose and certainly not cherries. Still no cherries to speak of in this one. It's mouth scorchingly tart/sour. At points it is warhead tart, and other times it is just sour. It's not balanced and it has no fruit in the party. This one is just a misfire for me."
""
"Overall: Another good beer from the Bruery. It's a nice homage to the traditional Belgian krieks though doesn't reach the same level as the good ones. Given the it's a brewery only release, I'm glad I got to try it, but I doubt I'll be going out of my way to track it down again."
"Pours a cloudy pink with almost no head. Nose is super tart acidic funk with some fruit notes. Mouthfeel is basically flat but held up by the sharp sourness. Taste is very sour, some oak barrel, fruity, sweet. Finish is sour followed by nice fruit notes of cherry, passionfruit, grapefruit. Very sour beer. I enjoyed it!"
""
"M: Medium syrupy with surprisingly weak carbonation"
"I'm not sure if I'd want to power back a bottle by myself but it worked well for out bottle share"

"Slightly artificial with a cherry ludens cough drop aftertaste, sharp and super sour up front with biting acidity. Very spritzy and dry, fully attenuated. The sharpness is a little much and more sour just for sour sake, adding little dimension to the beer itself. This was nice to try, but a little one-dimensional."
""
""
""
""
"M - mild carbonation, kind of smooth but the vinegaryness kind of hides that"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste. Actually, we found it pretty challenging to dissect through the thick blanket of sourness that cloaks each sip of this guy!! We were going to sit on it for a bit longer, but a friend suggested we hit it now, as its tartness would only enhance, so we decided to give it a go, and MAN, this is one of the most puckering, souring, wild things we’ve ever had the pleasure of sipping. After taking those first few sips to get a handle on what exactly you’re dealing with here, it starts to go down extremely smoothly, while retaining punch at every turn. Like many within the style, it is brewer with fruit, and while the cherry is certainly present, if we were told this was brewed with raspberries, or blackberries, or the likes, we wouldn’t contest it. That said, it is wonderfully executed from head to toe, and has that bright personality that only The Bruery can conjure."

"O: I'm overall quite pleased with this beer. I think this ranks up there with SiTR as the best sour that Bruery produces. It's mouth-puckering, sour goodness. That being said, I found this beer slightly too one-note and slightly too sour for my taste buds. It's just not as complex as some of my favorite sours on the market, probably because of the massive amount of sour cherries used. I definitely recommend tasting this if you have an opportunity, but I wouldn't trade a whale for it or anything."
""
"TOTAL = 43/50"

"O: This was pretty good. It lacks some of the depth of flavors that the best sour beers have, and I found it borderline too acidic for my taste. But overall quite enjoyable!"

"O: A very well done sour with a nice fruit addition. Not a Kriek in name but it does have that flavor."
"Another brilliant beer from The Bruery; They managed to really harness the sheer essence of cherry in this Kriek(as every Kriek should!) The beer is just sour enough to be refreshing but still leaves enough room on your palate for the cherry character to really shine. I'd recommend this any 'sour head' or anyone who loves cherries!"

"This is a poor way to start off the series, and I'm starting to lose faith in this brewery. Not really the worse wild ale I've had, but I've heard these guys can do better than this. It's drinkable, but many factors I mentioned above do not make this wholly memorable. Not a bad way to start off a meal, but could use some serious pruning, especially if The Bruery is supposed to be composed of barrel aging geniuses, and whatnot."
""
"When blended with the somewhat lack-luster Cpt. Lawrence Barrel Reserve Raspberry and a dash of Rubaeus, it actually turned out pretty good!"

"These sour ales sometimes bring an unusual color uncommon in the beer world, and Sans Pagaie does that with its grapefruit red body. Not much head stays on top. Its aroma brings to mind melon, cranberry, and acidic fruits. It has the taste of sour cranberry, and adding to it is a note of wood. Acid. There's additional vagueness of tart fruit with a rustic kiss. Added all together, you have yourself an enjoyable sour ale."

"Looks like cherry 7-up. Clear, no carb except a few loose bubbles at the bottom. Smells primarily of oak, sour cherries, some raw wood, a little tea and some sour character. Tart, cherries (bing with a little pie cherry), oak, slight sweet character in the background, some earthy character I'm having difficulty articulating. Fuck, this is good. Thin with low, but prickly carb and a dry finish. I'm sad to have had this just because more would be hard to get."

"It was real 'fresh' in terms of the cherry notes back around NYE (Another bottle opened courtesy of koufax21 at the Velasquez/Dos Santos 2 fight). Nice and dry delivery, relatively low alcohol makes this a great beer for summertime (wheels turning, should open one at Silva/Weidman pool party fight this summer). While there is a little bit of sweetness, its well placed with this beer. Funkiness to a minimum, which I tend to like. Carbonation is light, which is fine."

"A good sour ""kriek"" that is refreshing to drink on a warm day."

"My favorite sour from The Bruery is Sour In The Rye; until I had this fresh. I have had many The Bruery fruit forward sours, and I waited too long; so I learned my lesson. I had this one right away. Loved it. Sour blonde with cherries. Delicious. I am so happy that I have two more bottles to enjoy. Keep on with the good work"

"High B-"
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a short lived light level of carbonation visually but inside the mouth it is a bit effervescent and uplifting. I went back and forth between thinking this was just ok and really enjoying it. The last couple of bruery sours I drank I was not the biggest fan of, this one however is much better balanced and overall enjoyable. I am glad I have another bottle of this to revisit sometime. Worth trying if you get the chance."
""
"O: Again, one of my favorite Wild Ales from the Bruery to date. I hope at some point down the road they will make some form of smaller bottles with these sours and Imperial Old Ales or Imperial Stouts at 16-18% abv."
""
""
"Served in a Bruery tulip. Nose has some bright cherry and shows some initial acidity. Flavor is quite tart with cherry and light skin. Light body; needs more carbonation. Sad to say, this is another disappointing Bruery sour after some others (particularly dark base sours) have shown so much promise."
""
"The beer pours a hazy pinkish with almost no head. The nose is sweet, tart and aromatic. The nose is slightly reminiscent of cherries and chlorine but there is so much sourness going on that it's just not distinct. The taste is sour with a great amount of fruit and yeast. Very tart, sour mouthfeel that has a lingering fruitiness. Very tasty beer that is worth trying if you're in the mood for a cherry sour."
""
"murky orange pink with thin foamy white head and spotty streaky lacing. smells awesome. tart and fruity. tastes funky and sweet and fruity. a little watery tropical fruit. watery and prickly at the same time. overall nice, not mind blowing, but REALLY good."
"Verdict: A decent Kriek style Ale from The Bruery, but I'm still not sold on this one. The flavors are almost there, but still come off too artificial and sweet and the syrupy body wasn't doing it for me. I applaud the effort and definitely enjoyed this beer, but it's by no means one of the better sour offerings from The Bruery."
"Medium body, well carbonated, dry and bubbly on the tongue. Fairly straight forward, yet well crafted cherry pie sour. ::highfive:: Bruery."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy watermelon-pink with a dense white head that settles to a thin cap and solid ring, with a few spots of bubbles. Funky cherry and cherry pie, lemon juice, and some nice funk. The Bruery's funky beers are becoming more and more recognizable, and very delicious. Great cherry flavors, like tart pie cherries, with oak, brown sugar, tart lemon juice, and more funk. Light and crisp mouthfeel, with a medium-thin body, good carbonation, and a dry, puckering finish. Another solid Sour from the Bruery!"
"3.5/4/4/4/4.5"
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation feeling towards the lower end of the style. Overall, I thought it was a great beer and one of the best American sours I've had in a while. Admittedly, I'm a huge fan of cherries in anything but I really thought the fresh, fruity, tart cherries were fantastic in it. I thought it was one of the best cherry infused beers I've had and also a very solid American wild ale. Very enjoyable beer overall, and probably my favorite Bruery wild ale so far."
""
"O: Quite refreshing. I would love to have another and would by again (or in the first place - thanks warnerry for sharing!)"
""
"O- nice sour. 6/10 sour. Nice tartness balanced with slight raspberries and lower effervescence makes it easier to drink than many sours."
""
""
""
"D/O: This respectable sour has vestiges of Russian River Supplication, particularly in its yeast and fruit qualities. While distinctly sour, it lacks the sharpness of that other beer. It is well-rounded overall, with late lactic tartness and lingering fruit combining for a strong finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very delicous beer. Simple flavors the work very well together. Would definitely like to try it again"
"M: This is a BIG light leading to medium bodied. It's a very round mouthfeel."
"(D)- Another solid wild ale from the Bruery. The sourness is subtle, but such a vibrant combo of fruits and dry oak that I almost did not miss it. Time might help the sourness to round out though."
"D - This is quite nice - definitely one of the Bruery's best sours. Nice mix of tropical fruit juice, lemon tarts, and cherry pie. I'd gladly have this again, and I probably could drink an entire bottle of this one on my own."
""
"Overall: Tons of cherry here. I enjoyed this beer overall. Not overly complex, but rather enjoyable."

""
"O: A very solid wild ale, definitely a fan and would drink again."

"A really oustandingly done AWA. This is one of the best of the style to come from the Bruery without question."
"Pretty good sour. Straight forward yet delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is pinkish with a small head that recedes rapidly, leaving sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma offers pink grapefruit, wild yeast, pink lemonade. Smells fruity and sweet, with the addition of wild yeast. Sweet / tart citrus with a splash of lemonade. Alcohol well disguised. Medium bodied with a bit of a syrupy, sticky feel on the palate. Overall, this was solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer."
""
""
"O: One of the better American Wilds on the market. Huge props to the Bruery. So glad I have two more bottles of it. I would recommend this to anyone. Between this and Filmishmish I have to say they've knocked it out of the park."
""
"Overall: This is another great bruery beer. I enjoyed this beer way more than oude tart!"
""
"O: Nice drinkability and it was pretty balanced. Nothing was over powering, but that being said it wasn't anything spectacular either. Better than average, but nothing crazy."
"Highly drinkable, just kept wanting to drink this in large proportions. We all thought this was better than Oude Tart. Thanks egrace84 for the Bruery share."
"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit; probably one of the better Bruery sours I've had. While it is pretty sour, luckily it is not overly sour like Mother Funker, and finds a nice level of tart cherries and sourness. The nose is great, and I'm very glad to have a few more bottles of this one. Curious to see if it gets funkier over time like Filmishmish has become."
""
""
"M - Light body, moderate carbonation."
"O - Very tart with a nice sweet oaky cherry flavors."
"Overall quite nice. Barely a blonde ale anymore, more American sour ale with nice sour cherry juice and tart fruit with that slight flash of oak. And mouth puckering sourness."
""
"O - Really enjoyed this beer, definitely lived up to what I wanted. Not quite as good as Filmishmish but definitively delicious. So far, The Bruery has yet to disappoint us with their sour offerings."
"Beer is sharp and bright on the palate, really sour but not overwhelmingly so. Strong but drinkable. I really enjoyed it personally. It took a while to finish but overall I did enjoy it."
""
""
"O- This was a decent sour, but it definitely wasn't anything that stood out compared to other sours such as Cantillons, HF, etc.. Definitely could have used more flavor (especially with the cherries), carbonation, etc.. Easy to drink, interesting to try, would recommend trying it- but I probably wouldn't spend $20 or go out of my way obtaining it."
""
"Overall nice! Very good sour, one of the better bruery sours to me."
"O - Not as refined as Filmishmish, but still pretty enjoyable sour from The Bruery."
""
"Pours sort of a pinkish red color with a pink head. The aroma features plenty of cherry, but there does seem to be a mild butter aroma at first. A little bit carbonic (sort of a soda-water note). A bit of vanilla and wood, not quite as tart as I’d like. The flavor has plenty of cherry. A bit on the sweet side, sort of cherry pie-like. Some oak and vanilla are present on the palate as well, maybe a bit of grass. Not much in the way of funk."
""
""
""
"Somewhat light bodied, with good carbonation, crisp and clean with a puckering, dry finish. Refreshing and delicious, one of my favorite Bruery offerings so far."
""
"O. One of the best sours I have had. It is easy drinking and balanced yet retains the tannic qualities fans of these crave. Great creation here, I would definitely revisit."
"750 ml poured into a snifter with a hazy pinkish orange color, reminds me of....oh just a little vomit, giving a thin white head that falls to nothing almost immediately without any type of linger. The nose is sour upfront with light sour cherries, lemony zest and a touch of something sweet in the back. The taste is just dominated by vinegar and an acidic presence that is just off putting. The beer needs more cherries and something else for balance. A thin layer of cherries, oak and lemon work against too much bacteria for sure (lactobasillus?) without any type of structure...now that I've had mother funker, oui oui and now this; I'm starting to gather a typical vinegar presence from the bruery wild stuff that is uninviting and narrow. There is a minimal amount of carbonation and the mouthfeel is medium with a very dry finish. Overall I wanted to like this beer but the truth is, is that's it's a terrible kriek and needs to go on home. A sour, acidic, vinegar, light cherried mess that looks like chunkless vomit. $20 are you fucking serious? I'd rather eat a bag of shit."
"Bottle opened with a hiss and foamed over about 4 oz of beer before I got it into my glass. Pours a hazy amber orange color with a faint pink hue and a huge head that disappeared almost instantly. Smells of sweet malt and sour cherries with enough funk and sour tartness to keep me interested. The tartness pricks the tongue at first sip and never lets go. I get lots of lemon and tart cherry flavor and I swear I'm getting coconut as well. Earthy and fruity tart describe this one fairly well. The finish is quite dry with a long lingering tartness on the palette. Medium to thin body body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart almost salty mouthfeel. This is a nice tart light beverage to drink, but it's not my favorite."
"Sans Pagaie pours more of a deep orange than a true red, with a good bit of haze to it. A couple fingers of white foam crown the beer, showing little head retention and no lacing. The nose is excellent, led by a blend of earthy funk and cherry skins. A solid supporting tart aroma rounds out the picture. The flavor profile has far more acidity than I expected. It really takes over the beer and drowns out the cherries and brett. They're both still there (though definitely the former more than the latter), but this is a very different beer than the nose had suggested. The body is very light,and paired with an expansive, active carbonation. The mouthfeel is champagne-esque. Sans Pagaie is a bit aggressive for a beer that's just out of the gates, especially compared to some classic Belgian krieks. It's definitely not without its charms though."
"Served from bottle into a Bruery tulip. Poured a rosy pink red with a minimal fizzy white head that subsided to none fairly quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, wood, sweet cherry, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart cherry, sweet cherry, sugar, funk, subtle saltiness, and subtle wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The cherries on this one were one of the most intense experiences I have had to date with this fruit with both sweet and tart going on at the same time. The funk laid a nice foundation as well to follow-up everything. The mouthfeel on this one was great to say the least. Felt like little scrubbing bubbles dancing on my tongue. Definitely a must try for any sour fan out there as this one is really close to a Kriek in my opinion."
"A very solid wild from the Bruery. Tart and clean, incredibly drinkable although no one aspect really stands out as elite."
""
"O: One of those beers that's better than the sum of it's parts. This is simple and clean and delicious, and considerable better than most Bruery sours, in my opinion. Also, kudos for making an American Wild with a reasonable ABV."
"O- A really nice beer, one of the best American krieks I've had, definitely give this one a try if you like very tart, dry krieks."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really solid for an American kriek. Just tasty."
"O - Decent beer but the appearance and finish really take hits on this one."
"Sans Pagaie pours a lighter bodied grapefruit juice pinkish red in color with good carbonation but no head or lacing. It really does look like grapefruit juice or strawberry lemonade. The nose is great. It's tart and fruity with a fresh cherry juice presence. I dig it. The flavors mimic the aromas. There is a lot of sour cherry juice with nice acidity. It isn't overly complex but its a nice sour. It drinks light and dry. I'm a fan. This beer isn't too far away from a Kriek in flavor, just lighter with more tartness and is a tad on the juicy side hut its worth trying. I enjoyed it."

"For a young brewery to produce a sour at this level reveals great potential, I look forward to sampling sours from Rue & co. in a decade or so."

"Pours a reddish-grapefruit like color that is almost clear with a medium white head that disappears instantly. Scent is heavy with the cherries…a ton of funk reached my nose the second I popped off the cap. A bit of citrus on top of the cherries…I’m picking up grapefruit and tangerines. Just a touch of vinegar. Taste is initially delicious tangerines, which graceful transforms into tart cherries. Finish with a sweet cherry flavor on the back of the tongue. At first this beer seems extremely sour, but as you take more sips, it becomes much more balanced. Nice cherry sweetness to this beer. A bit of oak in the middle of the palate, but not nearly as much as Otiose. Mouthfeel is light bodied and very fizzy, almost soda-like. Puckering sour leads to sticky sweet. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is another outstanding sour from The Bruery. I was worried the cherries would not be as noticeable as I was hoping, but it definitely pulled through. Bravo Bruery!"
"Overall: Not really that impressive, I was impressed with the apricot version and was hoping this would be its equal, alas it is not."

""
"O: This seems like more of a sour for non-sourheads. Refreshing, very easy to drink, and mildly tart with wonderful flavors. You may be let down if you are looking for something mouthpuckering. So far this is my favorite sour among the Bruery's 2012 releases."

"Pours a slightly hazy red-orange with no head and no lacing. Smell is of sour cherries, slight vinegar, and some tart and funky aromas. Taste is of sour and tart cherries, funk, and some slight vinegar flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good sour with some very nice aromas and flavors."
