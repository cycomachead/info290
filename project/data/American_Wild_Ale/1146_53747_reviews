"Great smell. The Raspberry flavor is key to the sour/wild taste. Color is a nice red with little carbonation. Oak taste is there very little."

"March 2015, had a 2010 bottle which held up great and had lots of flavors going on."

"Introductory aromas remind me of a nice bottle of red- nothing too punchy or dry. Initial sip is smooth and tart, but does not linger on the taste buds. I could get through a 750ml but not much more than that."
""
"Very good lots of raspberrys"
""

""

""
"Perfect minimal head for a sour/wild. Poured into an Ommegang tulip. All the tart flavors I would expect and desire right off the bat. A mild champaign like finish, but don't underestimate this beer. It will leave you with a fuzzy palette, not sure if you should move on or enjoy another. I enjoyed another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tart but not sour. Very middle of the road and forgettable."
""
"Love this beer. Very nice and tart with raspberries. Nice maroon in color. Aroma of raspberries and tartness. Dry and light on the palate with raspberry and tartness but very drinkable. This one does not kill the taste buds. Very nice beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber in color and very cloudy in complexion.  Significant carbonation activity is noticeable.  Strong aroma of tart raspberries and Brett is present.  The taste is initially tart raspberries and the sourness definitely becomes more prominent at the back of the palate when the Brett kicks in full force.  The mouth is highly carbonated and sticky."
"O - A delicious, fruity sour.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed this too.  Definitely want to have this one again."
"The sourrrr! And the ABV! Yesss!"
""
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer and all its elaborate flavors that weaved back and forth between sweet and tart/sour, letting a lot of berry and yeast funk show off their flavor profiles. A damn good wild ale that I recommend trying."
""
"Amazing Wild Ale with a Sour Finish"
"Pours a dark amber/reddish color with a thin carbonated head.  Head retention and lacing are not apparent.  Has a sweet raspberry aroma.  You can detect a hint of tartness from the wild yeast strains.  Has a sweet raspberry taste that is tart at the end.  You can taste the wine quality to it.  Can really discern any hoppiness to it.  Good beer, but would be too sweet to drink a lot of."
""
""
""
""
"Got damaged in shipping and lost a lot of carbonation, so my review isn't completely accurate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well done wild ale."
""
""
"Very nicely flavored tart raspberry beer. Delicious!"
"Lolita is a gem of a beer. This batch is holding up like a champ. The raspberry is still vibrant, the acidity is bright, and the sheer enjoyment is sky high. I have always been a fan of this beer, this is the oldest I've drank and it holds up well."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty winey.  Lots of raspberry.  Funky.  Great farmhouse.  Will definitely buy again."
""
"Overall, I'd have to say disappointing.  This beer is not tart enough for me.  It almost has a not-so-sweet cranberry ginger ale taste to it.  Obviously the individual attributes amount to ok to me, I see no need for a mediocre beer like this."

"I feel like Goose Island's sours are lost in the mix, compared to their other big barrel-aging project, but this is quite nice."

"O: a mix of wild yeast, fruit and tartness that works notably better than average."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour, that is all."
""
""
"D:  I really am confused by the low ratings here but what a treat at three years let me tell you.  Perhaps this is not the most complex or sour of sours and I am still not incredibly versed in the wild ales arena however this Lolita was simply fantastic.  Goose Island brings the balance which is why I think I love their Sisters line up so much."

"Bottled 12/04/2010 the age seems to have made this more drinkable. I like the beer fresh, but at the four year mark the sourness has faded a little. Well blended between the sweet and sour aspects of this gem"

"a wonderful framboise type beer, wild raspberry ale, loaded with fresh berry character, but a step below stuff like cantillon and others. pink and winey in the glass, not much head after the initial pour, looking almost still, but still sprightly on the palate. nose is huge lacto and barrel character, not as belgian as i expected in the yeast department, just a true wild here. funky as heck, but the raspberries dominate. tart and sweet, fresh and ripe, young and mature elements both present, dynamic, but not as complex as some. the flavor just drips fresh raspberries, a fruit i really love in beer when its done right. leagues below stuff like atrial rubicite in both brett and fruit character, but its like a kid brother to a beer like that. beautifully done, i wish for only richer body, a little more heft, and maybe some more bacterial kick, but i thinks this is one if the best of the sisters, and shows that goose island is still a very relevant player in the beer scene, despite being macro in many ways. beer this good from a brewery this big should cost less though, and ill bet if sierra nevada made it it would cost ten bucks. thats my only real problem with an otherwise very enjoyable and fun wild ale. nevermind that its not the most unique framboise lambic type out there, its delicious and thats what matters. shockingly high alcohol though for its taste and drinkability. wowza!"
""
"I was really hoping for quite a bit more sourness. Has a decent tartness, but really lacking that palate coating acidity I love in my sours. Raspberry and wine barrel flavors are done nicely though."

"O: amazingly complex beer. a must try for anyone that enjoys the sour styles"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is amazing: tart red raspberries (wife says strawberry), nice barnyard, mild oakiness, a very light and playful aroma. A nice tart start that explodes with a nice raspberry fruity flavor and a very nice farmhouse /hay/barnyard flavor. Finishes with a nice oaky-bitterness. This may well be the best GI brew I've had.... And it is very hard to beat the Bourbon County Barleywine & Stout. This is a very enjoyable!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent sour ale with plenty of sour punch without overpowering the delicate fruit flavors of the beer. Certainly a worthy beer to christen a new house with."
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this sour. What I want from sour... tart, smooth, drinkable. This will not be my last bottle of Lolita."
""
"The beer pours a fizzy and bubbly white head that dissipates immediately. The beer itself is a hazy ruby with a hint of cherry red. The smell has a strong raspberry note and a bit of vanilla notes from the barrels. There also appears to be a very weak oak note as well. The smell also has bits of fruity sweetness to it. The beer taste is radically different from the smell. The taste has a very strong raspberry note with a hint of vanilla but barely. The taste also has a red grape flavor similar to a cabernet. The funk is in the form of a strong tart and sour flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but a bit light and watery with biting carbonation. Overall, a decent beer and a decent sour worth getting at least once."
""
"Picked up a bottle of this on special at Butler's for $14. Great price. Decent looking beer with a great smell. Had not looked at it and did not realize it was a sour until I caught a whiff. Not as tart as some sours I have had, which I like, but it was wonderful. I enjoyed this beer very much and will certainly be going back to see if I can snag a few more while they are on special."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really great sour ale. Nicely balanced, and very flavorful. I was a little worried from the aroma that it would be too sour, but it's a great balance."

"O - Fantastic Wild Ale with plenty of tart fruits like raspberries, strawberries, and cranberries. Nice wine character and feel. Excellent."
""
"This beer drinks like a flavorful wine. There's a lot going on, but it isn't merely fruity, it's complex. I'm not a big fan of fruity beers but the way this beer changes on the tongue and the shift from sweet to sour make it a solid beer. (Not necessarily for the novice beer drinker)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Tart. Medium bodied with not much carbonation to speak of. Finishes dry. No residual sweetness. The acidity cuts through the fruit. Doesn't come off at 8%. Funk and oak come though with some nots from the barrel. Really pleased by the overall character. Just an excellent sipper that comes off as a crowd pleaser."
""
""
"O - Three years in, the sweetness appears to have been pretty thoroughly gobbled by the yeast. The result is a pungent, sour beer, but one with several layers working simultaneously. The wine elements are interesting, and the hints of fruit give a counterpoint to the acidic bight that makes the beer's core. A fine offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very nice wild/sour flair, but remains very manageable for those new to style or who dont like things overblown. This has just the right amount of sourness and eloquent feel that it can easily substitute as a wine at a fine dinner party. Very well brewed with a soothing sourness factor makes this an easy try and easy A beer for me."
""
""
"Overall- Really good beer with glimmers of greatness. Sourheads might find it to be a little weak but I like this level of tartness. Plus, there's enough of the funk to keep me interested. Worth a try but it's understandable if you don't want to pay 20 bucks for this. I wouldn't do it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it, could use more depth and refinement."
"Pours oddly clear. Amber in hue. Nose is super sour! Whew! Vinegar, lactic tones; all very sharp. Flavor is just wads of wildness in your mouth. More so a punch than any real grace or character showing. I don't get much fruit; barely an accent. But hey. It's wild and sour. Won't go down as the most graceful wild ale of them all, but I can live with this."

"O - A remarkably refreshing beer which could have been improved if it tasted a little weirder/funkier. This beer is a little simplistic; pretty straightforward in terms of its flavour profiles and the first sip yields much the same flavours as the finish. I have a sneaking suspicion this beer would be awesome with some age on it. I may just have to find out."

"765 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2013. Pours lightly cloudy deep reddish copper color with a small off white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing. No glass lacing, and a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart raspberry, strawberry, sour cherry, red wine, oak, clove, hay, straw, grass, vinegar, musty funk, leather, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart raspberry, sour cherry, strawberry, red wine, vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, sour cherry, strawberry, red wine, oak, clove, vinegar, musty funk, leather, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and wine barrel flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a great fruited wild ale. All around good balance and complexity of raspberry, fruity/funky yeast, and wine barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O- A very nice sour that balances earthiness, funkiness and fruitiness extremely well. Could be my favorite out of Lolita, Juliet and Halia."
"An excellent sour, redolent of raspberries and with enough bite to be very interesting, but not so much as to destroy the tastebuds. The pour itself is beautiful, with the raspberries lending a ruby hue to the base brown color. Little head. Raspberries in the aroma, along with a fairly sharp sourness. The taste is even better, with a rounder profile, a bare touch of sweetness, and a clear, fresh fruit note along with the somewhat bracing acidity. Very nicely done indeed."

"Pours out a hazy rust color with hardly any head. Smells funky and acidic with a touch of raspberry and vanilla. Flavor starts off sweet-ish with some dryness and tartness coming through the middle. Raspberry is tastefully done and subdued. A bit too much oak for me. The vanilla is a little overpowering. Light acidity in the finish. Mouthfeel could use some more fizz to combat the richness of the wood. This is tasty, but I'd have a hard time drinking more than a glass of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: My first ever Sour, maybe my last. Goose Island is my favorite brewery but this simply does not work for me."

"A top-notch Wild from Goose Island. A must try."
""
" The flavor is both sour and slightly sweet with raspberry with red wine tartness and light sweet edge of fruit with fresh tart berry flavors adding to the acidity of lactic acid and yeast which compliments the light oak in the background. Overall very nice sour ale with flavor of raspberry, but not over the top fruit drinkable with a kiss of raspberry"
""
""
""
""
"T: Big underripe raspberry tartness upfront. Meaty sour cherry, big Pinot Noir notes and some lighter white wine notes as it winds down into the finish. Finish is lemony tart and slightly acetic with a light tannic dryness that rounds things out pretty nicely."
""
""
"Overall, very tasty. I want to drink this cold in a hot, humid environment."
""
""
""
""
"Packaging gets a five here and enhances the experience. A nice bottle to share or enjoy alone on a Sunday afternoon like I just have. Lolita is delicious!"

"O- This and Juliet was my favorite of the sisters. Reminds me of a classic Flanders Red. I would drink this one over and over."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and a pretty good example of a American Wild Ale, it had a nice sour base to it that wasn't overly sour or acidic and the raspberry worked well with this beer and the all the flavors seem to come together nicely. This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth a little acidic, dry, not too filling and the taste did a very nice job at holding my attention, the acidic aspect would keep me from drinking the whole bottle, but I think half the bottle is pretty close to the prefect amount for me and I think this would make for a nice beer to enjoy in the summertime. What I like the most about this beer was how well the raspberry worked with the sour base, they complemented each other nicely. What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there is anything that I would change, it's great just the way it is. I would buy this beer again if I saw it, it's pretty pricey at $20, but I think it's worth it and it's a nice special occasion beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes American Wild Ales or sour beers in general. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I'm glad I decided to go half on a bottle with my friend, I wouldn't want to miss out on this one, and the more beers I have from this series the more I like it. Juliet is still my favorite but this one comes in a solid second. Great job guys, this was a really nice beer and I hope I can try the rest of the sisters, keep up the great work."

"Maybe my favorite of the Belgian Sisters. I am really glad to see this in Texas. While it is on the expensive side, still cheaper than the others sitting around and a better product IMO. Highly recommended."

"Lovely glowing pinkish-red orangy color with a quickly fading white head. No lace, no more head, but a very nice color. Clear enough to see a stream of carbonation bubbles rising at the center of the glass. Aroma is clean with a dusting of wackiness. Juicy tart raspberries, wild yeast, white doughy crackers, warm summer floral, and some soft musky wood. Taste is similar but includes increased tart funkiness. Really nice actually. Very fun to drink. Flavors are sweet and sour berries, tangy and tart, woody and earthy, floral, herbal, fermented fruit, white wine, and grape skins. Smooth, soft, fluid texture, with puckering/smacky tart dryness."
"Pours a glowing orange-amber liquid with a low white head that promptly crackles away to nothing. Potent acetic aroma: dry, funky raspberries, mustiness, and dry wood. Sweetish, tart raspberry slickness in the mouth. Dry wine-like fruit, dust, lemon, earth, and sharp woody notes. A bit phenolic in the finish which meshes with the spicy wood. The extremely dry, acidic smell is a little harsh, but the berries really come out in the flavor. Super dry and puckering mouthfeel, lightly carbonated. Very refreshing and surprisingly refreshing for its strength."

"Cheers!"
"All of the 4 Sisters beers are pretty solid - lolita is lively and tart from the aggressive addition of raspberries. Some wood and vinous notes come through from the cab sauv barrels, but those traits are not overly assertive. Bubbly carbonation - good stuff, just wish it was more around the $15 price point"

"i wasnt sure i liked this one at first. let it warm up a bit and the more i drink the more i like. nice sour tart acidity. get some raspberry and get a nice oak flavor. the smell kinda throws you off a bit though kinda get like a hair or nail salon type of smell to it if that makes any sense. but all in all a solid beer. dont know if its worth the $ 22 price tag though."

"The beer pours a slightly hazy burnt orange/garnet with no sediment or head. The nose is quite unique with ripe raspberries, nail salon, and dog saliva. I'd say the taste is a more modest, raspberry-driven, funky sour comparable to a tart, oaky white zinfandel in flavor and body. It's relatively undercarbonated, vinous, tart, tannic, semi-dry, fruity, and a slightly funky sour, but it hides alcohol well and is quite drinkable. This is definitely not a disappointment, but the price point on the bottle is."
""
"Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Purchased locally at Spec's. Tasted on 1-3-14."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into wide champagne flute. Slightly hazy peachy amber color with tons of bubbly whitish pink head that faded immediately. Some bubbles cling to the side of the glass within the beer. Aroma is of sweet raspberry and dry woody wine. Taste is exactly the same as the aroma. Quite sweet. Decent, but nothing outstanding about this beer. High carbonation makes this fun to drink. I enjoy the bubbly feeling. Body is light, borderline thin."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent beer. Price was around $18, but worth it."
""
""
""
"Just do not feel this beer is good enough to warrant the demand and price tag. I will definitely pass if this beer, or any of the other sisters, cross my pass. This in my opinion the best of the groupl."
""
""
""
""
"A nice beer but I would need to give serious consideration to pull the trigger again at 20 a bottle."
""
""
"Overall this might be the most enjoyable of the few dozen or so ""wild ales"" i've had. The sourness is moderate and integrates well with the fruit elements. Really pleasant to drink and a nice intro to the style if you are so inclined."

""

""

"I poured them from a 25oz bottle. This beer has a blush colored body with no head. The aroma has a tart raspberry smell to it. The taste is the same as the smell tart, raspberry flavor to it. The mouthfeel is dry but smooth and overall this is excellent beer, I hope I can get a hold of the other sisters."

"2013 vintage."
"O-I enjoyed this beer, but I had perhaps set my expectations a bit too high. The funky, lactic, raspberry flavors are nice, but simple when compared against better, more complex examples of the style. I could have used more oak in the flavor profile and a more robust body to tamp down the high levels of acidity. All in all, it is a good beer but there are better examples."

"Reddish brown with a small head. A spectacular aroma of stone fruit, dry caramel and balsamic vinegar. The flavor follows along the same lines but without the same level of transcendence. Nicely done, one of the best smelling sours I've had in a long time."
"Minimal head on a slightly hazy reddish brown body. No lacing really. Aroma of strawberry, cherry, wood, vinegar; nicely tart and sweet. Flavors of strawberry tartness with hints of raspberry and background notes of molasses and wood. Medium body and light carbonation. Excellent, balanced but simple sour. Definitely should be tried."

"06/27/13 large format bottle, poured into a snifter. Bright white bubbly head dissipates almost immediately and leaves nothing behind; no lacing. Reddish orange, translucent. Oaky fruity aromas up front. Taste is similar, with tart/sweet raspberry flavors. Definitely taste the barrel; serious cab sav resemblance. Feel is dry and refreshing. Overall GI fails to disappoint yet again; great beer, highly recommend it."

"By far one of my favorite beers of 2013. Prickly, spicy-peppery raspberries with a cleansing tartness. The funk is subtle, and I pick out red wine and barrel taste from the aging. It really is subdued, but backs up the fruit and tartness wonderfully. It bears a beautiful dark rose color with thin lacing as well. WIthout a doubt my favorite of this series from Goose Island."

"Sorry, this beer was nasty in my opinion. It was thin and watery looking, no head at all. The taste was like robotussin, but slightly less mediciney. I can't really describe the smell, other than Robotussin light. Not sure if I got a glass from a bad keg or what, but this was very disappointing."

"Poured a light reddish body with minimal head and lace patches that die off real quick. Aroma packs a razzy punch, but a good amount of tart, sour funkiness is tucked in there and there also some woody and boozy notes as well. Taste is more of the same as a highly caarbonated, sharp beer that is light to medium bodied passes over my tongue with raspberry flavor as well as possible other ""wine"" fruits like grape and there's a boozy, oakiness to the beer as well. The barrel/woodiness helps keeps things balanced and smooth and I swear as the beer warms (or the ABV hits you, depending on how you look at it) there are some minor sweetnotes on the backend. A good sour ale that is worth trying and enjoyable the whole night."

"O-it was good but way over priced would never buy a 2nd bottle of this and i love this style NG Raspberry Tart at half the price was so much better"

"A very well done beer with a good amout of tartness and a good amount raspberry. A good beer for fruit beer or wild ale lovers."

"Rosé de Gambrinus this beer is not. The $18 asking price is outrageous. Nice to try and to savor with some food, but it really is nowhere near what a good framboise should be.. if you make the case that this isn't supposed to be a framboise, well it says something to the effect on the label. Too much barrel, a bit too much booziness, and not enough fruit. It's not complex when its chilled, but it gets boozy when it gets warm. Can't really win with this one."

"O: A very nice American sour with a good mix between the raspberries, oak, and wine character. Quite drinkable for a sour, but it's nice to sit back and relax and just sip it. Priced right around the average for other sours as far as 750 mL bottles go at $18, so it's really not too bad of a deal either. Great if you like raspberries, too"

"Overall: Outstanding!! Well worth buying again! Glad that I have 2-3 more bottles. This is a beer that's well worth your attention if you like sour beers."

"Also had tasted the 2010 vintage a week ago at beervana RI, and it was even better and one of my favorites of the night. Curious to taste last year's and thus years. I would say the '10 was slightly more tart, less sweet of a raspberry flavor and a smidge nicer body"
"O. This is definitely one of my favorite domestic sours. Tart as heck and just as smooth. A great fruit and oak balance. I always have one of these in my cellar and fridge. Certainly worth the price tag. I highly recommend this ale."

"I was salivating from start to finish from the pungently tart aroma and the flavor definitely helped to quench my senses. A very nice sour brew from Goose Island with plenty of fruitiness that never really comes off as sweet; rather, it remains mostly tart and juicy for the entire duration of the beer. Barrel was heavy yet subtle enough to let the fruit work its magic. Great beer all around."

"Bottle: Poured a clear reddish color ale with a light pink bubbly head with medium retention and no lacing. Aroma of tart notes of raspberries with light Brett notes with some vinous notes also perceptible. Taste is a good mix between tart raspberries notes with well balanced vinous notes with some subtle notes of Brett at the end. Body is about average with great carbonation which feels right for the style and no apparent alcohol. Very good level of drinkability with well balanced complexity. I would love to have a lower ABV version of this that could be drank in the summertime."

"Pink brown with little central etching. Smells like cracked hard candy with sour raspberries and some lemons, some cranberry. Taste is tart, not sour, with some raspberries, some sour beer. Thin bodied with moderate on hi carb with dry finish. Nice beer."

"2010 vintage. Bottle on date of 12/4/2010, poured on 2/11/2013. Pours a beautiful deep raspberry red with hunts of dark orange. No head, just some fizz off the top. Smells amazing. Sour cherry, definite raspberry presence, and vinegar sour. Flavor is very sour vinegar to start but mellows quickly into raspberry and cherry flavors. Finishes with some citrus lingering. Clean, crisp and prickly carbonation. Easy going mouthfeel and very drinkable. This is yum."

"I have had this beer on a couple of occasions, but this is the first time I have sat down with it with the intention of recording my impressions. I find that, despite the acidity, it is a pleasure to drink. I would rate it higher if I could detect just a bit more of a contribution from the raspberries. Moreover, I believe the acidity that's present is more than enough to support just a tad more sweetness. At any rate, am hoping I can soon try other sour offerings from Goose Island like Juliet and Madame Rose."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: This is rather nice, but for me (and in this incarnation) it does suffer from quite a bit of hype… If only the promise of that aroma had stood up..."
""
""
""
"The palate opens sharp, lactic and Bretty with clove and plastic, a little harsh and unpleasant. Nice raspberry fruit, mildly seedy and moderately tannic. Drying on the finish with flavors of fruit, oak and tannins, this is decent stuff."
""
"M- Moderate carbonation like you would expect. Kind of an odd, dry feeling. Almost as if it were slightly powdery. A very sessionable weight and not too tart to drink all night. A solid sour from GI."
""
"O - This is very good I just wish it was more sour."

"O: Certainly a good beer. Not the best wild ale I've ever come across, but not the worst either."

"O: Overall, i'm very fond of this beer. Lots of raspberries with a hint of sour tartness. Some wine like flavors and feel. Excellent."
"Very good beer probably behind Juliet, but ahead of Madame Rose for me. Very acidic and dry though. I enjoyed it, but needed a Zantac afterwards."
""
"Lots of raspberry in this one, thanks Americo. Pink coloured body, fruity aroma. Fuller mouthfeel, also with assertive carbonation. A good tartness, a nice bottle to share because of the acidity. Some other berries there, lending balance, strawberry and some wild blueberry. Could even be some cherry."
""
"0-Fan-damn-tastic. Worth the Jackson it costs to buy this bottle. Excellent in any season and environment."
"This perfectly exemplifies the potential of short-term cellaring - the Sour Patch Kid punch that sort of turns me off from fresh Lolita has subsided to a mellow, dry, complex fruit profile. Very nice."
""
"2011 750mL bottle of Lolita. Pours a cloudy amber color with a moderate head that leaves great lacing. Mild scent of raspberries, wine, and yeast. Some of the taste reminded me of olive juice. Taste was smooth and mellow with raspberries, wheats, and yeast. Rich, creamy, and very delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A clean and easy drinking sour beer. Great fruity oaky flavors without being so over the top sour as to prevent consumption of the entire bottle. Thanks again, Jay!"

""
"Overall: Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with rather light carbonation. Lingering tart fruity finish. A little on the acidic side and not quite as good as Juliet. Tart but not overly sour. Would like to see how this one ages."

"M: Light to medium bodied."

"Lolita comes out looking the part with a dark red deep amber look coming from the glass. This is much darker than expected going into blackberry color. Right off the tap, there was nothing in terms of head of even a flimsy foam, nothing, it's all good though. Smell is pretty integrated with raspberry scent over faint wine coming through when the warming takes place. It's pretty tame to tell you the truth. I don't get any funky scents coming up, just mainly fruit. Taste is pretty one sided towards the raspberry flavor which is nice and not artificial. The fruit just does not pop out for me as much as I would like. The wine is light to and the barrel flavor non existent. Some malt presence in the end with a slight tart hit that is not sour, don't go looking for a pucker bomb, Lolita is not the one for that. Body is less than medium with a trace of carb. Nice stuff, but not something I will be going for again."
""
"With so much tart fruitiness and dry sweetness, this beer is ideally suited to win over lovers of all sorts of wines and I find notes of minerally Greek whites, robust Chilean merlots, and simplified white zinfindales sprinkled all over this beer."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a subtle prickliness and modest carbonation. Very nice overall."
""
""
""
"O- A solid beer and worth the price tag, but not as good as Juliet. Good sour qualities, but I feel that it would have been if the raspberries added more sourness and weren't so sweet and tart."
""
"O: If it didn’t feel like a watery soda, I’d be going back for a second bottle; it does, though, and the palate is distracted by it in the end. Still, it’s a tasty brew, especially if you like wine."
"O: Definitely a good sour beer someone getting used to sours (Me) Great smells. Looks inviting. I like the tingle of carbonation and the complexities going on. Hard for me to spell out as my palate is still developing when it comes to fruit/sours. I'd give a 4.25 overall"
""
""
""
"Bottled on 11/12/11 so maybe I should have given it more time, but it's only barely drinkable and just beer-like. There's an alcohol heat, but not much taste. Not my favorite."
""
"O: A very solid beer, although I'd like to see it a touch lighter in the body and the nose wasn't near as complex as the taste. Would like to have again."
""
"Very nice."
"Overall, a good sour, with lots of raspberry flavor, but lacking somewhat in complexity. I'd rather have a rodenbach grand cru."
""
"Notes: Light, but alcohol is definitely present. For folks that love sours, this beer is definitely worth trying. Not the greatest on earth, but still solid. Lacks a bit in appearance, but stands out in nose and flavor. Considering the price, I would probably choose others first, but nonetheless a very good beer."
""
""
""
"This is a real good wild ale. Is definitely sour right now and this was a 2012 bottling."
"Pretty nice beer and one that grew on me as it warmed and seemed to open up in the glass. The flavor profile is pretty complex, and as noted above, there really is a considerable amount of flavor in this beer. Not sure I'd want to drink this again any time soon, but am still glad I had the opportunity to try it. Bottle price in my part of the world was $20, so obviously that's a consideration as well."
"2011 vintage. 22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Poured a reddish gold with a finger of off white head. Tart fruit, oak and a little brett in the aroma. Tart raspberries to start and a long finish of oak and vanilla. Medium bodied. There is a lot going on here. Not super sour, but a nice acetic bite that was in balance with the rest of the beer. A pricey bottle, but I'm really glad that I pulled the trigger."
""
"Medium bodied with a strong raspberry presence that never becomes overly sweet or dominating. Funky, earthy bugs and wine barrel character provide nice balance. Dry toasted oak along with grape, currant and other dark berries. Nice tartness with a puckering feel and just a touch of acetic acid. Not harsh at all however with the sweetness keeping things in check. Pretty good and much better than the Madame Rose."
"A really really tasty sour. Reminds me a lot of RR Supplication - a fruity sour with an excellent balance between those two."
""
""
""
"Lighter to medium body, lower carbonation. A slight alcohol burn, but not overwhelming. Fantastic character added by the barrel here. I imagine a year or two in the cellar could make this a classic. Very nice."
""
""
"The beer is copper to amber in color with a small white head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma brings raspberries, berries, malt, wild yeast. Smells like a tasty American wild ale. The flavor is pleasant. Not remarkably funky or sour, but rather easy to drink. Light in body, but not thin. Raspberries and oak are the dominant flavors. I thought this was a really enjoyable brew, and would happily have it again."
"O- I had higher hopes for this GI Wild Ale. Gets much better as it sits around and warms, especially on the nose where it really opens up and comes alive. Unless I figure out something to cook and showcase this brew... this is a one and done for me. Glad I finally tried it, but wasn't really impressed. Nothing wrong with it to speak of, but very underwhelming overall."
""
""
""
"pretty good, would be far better with more carbonation."
""
"O - Too sour and dry for my liking. Could use more sweetness and carbonation."
""
""
"Overall this one took me by surprise. I like sours, but am not normally a fan of fruit beers. I have always wanted to try this particular brew and was lucky enough to find one. I'm glad I didn't let this sit in the cellar much longer, six months in the bottle seems to be perfect; just enough for the brett to do its thing but keep the raspberries at the forefront. Recommended highly to any BA who can get their hands on it. Cheers!"

"This is a great beer, but it is not exceptional. There are some great fruit flavors, some nice sourness, and a nice balance of tartness, but it's not remarkably complex."
"Overall: Its a beer that has some issues, mainly with carbonation, but the flavor is delicious and very well balanced, with excellent barrel notes. Does not taste at all like 9% ABV."
""
""
""
"Overall: Certainly not one of the most mouth puckering Wild Ales out there, but I am not sure why so many think that is a bad thing. This is actually well balanced from all the components and I love the wine-like character it has. Plus this is much more refreshing than any red wine."
""
"O- This is a home run in my books. It's not an over the top Cantillon sour that the masses would wince at. It's easy drinking, palatable to most and just an overall wonderful experience."
""
""
"O - Nice sour beer"
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a very unimpressive and underwhelming beer. I love sours but this...this just isnt sour. Far too malty for my liking. Glad I didnt buy it."
"Thanks to my cousin Jeff for sharing, it pours a reddish copper, moderate white head, nice lacing. The aroma is sweet, tons of rasberries, some hay. Big sweet rasberry notes, slight vinegar, sweeter finish. It is more tart than sour. The body is light, high carbonation, no discernable alcohol. Very enjoyable brew, very vinous, a beer non-sour heads can enjoy."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lolita is a really nice release from Goose Island. I was apprehensive once I saw that raspberry was used, but it turned out to be a positive. The fruit flavor is nice and subtle. Works really well with the other flavors. This is really good stuff. It’s pricey, but very good."
"650 ml bottle, 2011 vintage bottled on 11/12/11. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy reddish/amber color with about an inch light tan cola-like head that fizzled away pretty quickly. Not much lacing, either. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like sweet and tart raspberries, oak, lemon peel, and some red wine/grapes. It tastes like tart and sweet raspberries, oak, red wine, earth, and a bit of lemon. It's more tart tasting than sweet, but the tartness isn't close to being overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit thin and is well carbonated. It's also easy to drink. All in all, I think it's a good brew. But for $15.99 a bottle, I'm not sure if I'll end up buying another bottle to age or not."
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky, dry and lingering on the tongue. This was another solid beer from GI, although this might have been my least favorite of the 3 sisters."
"Overall: Solid, but not quite of the caliber I was expecting. The flavors war with one another at the start, but eventually settle down. A bit of time might temper it and really let the flavors meld and create something great."
""
"I found this beer very similar to Ommegang's Aphrodite--a little too fruit-forward for me. The barrel characteristics, at least in this fresh bottle, are minimal. For a great Goose Island sour offering, go for Madame Rose instead."
"Overall, this beer is good, but somehow not great. It is more tart than it is sour in my opinion. I live close to Jolly Pumpkin and go there often. If their beers weren't so well done, I might have a slightly higher opinion of Lolita."
"Drink- The 2nd of the 3 sisters has again lived up to the hype. A great american wild ale with wonderful use of a often misdone fruit in Raspberries. I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to aasher for sending this one my way! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Goose Island wine glass. Poured a deep red-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberries, tart, cherry, tart cherries, wood, and acetic acid. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, fruit, vinegar, wood, earth, sour, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The fruit profile going on here was really nice with a nice sour and tart aspect carrying through. This made for a really nice brew that was quite easy to drink and very enjoyable. I honestly wish I had a lot more of this as it was quite nice. A definite must try if you like sours."
"2011 vintage."
""
""
"O: I had this side by side with the 2011 vintage. This beer is much more subdued that it’s 2011 sister. Light caramel malts give a good base for both beers, but this one ends up being sweeter. It is a little bit less “in your face” than the 2011. Also, this has more carbonation which makes it that much more enjoyable. 4/5"
"O-This is considered one of their sours but I prefer the tart beers like Fleur and Matilda to this one."
""
""
""
"Nice american wild, good but a little simple."
""
"O: Well-done. The raspberries were certainly perceivable and enjoyable, and the sourness balanced nicely with the rest of the profile, with the alcohol being extremely well-hidden. Not quite worth the $18 I paid for it, but highly enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
"O- A nice sour, not as good as I would have hoped for the price, but a solid barrel aged sour."
""
""
"Pours dark pink/red. Aroma is raspberries. The taste is sour raspberry and merlot. Very astringent. It’s not as bitter as one would assume. The tartness is well balanced by the malt. Mouthfeel is rather thin. Overall not my favorite beer but worth a try."
"O: Glad to have tried it. For the price, I will not revisit. Not bad, but nothing standout forme. Thanks to GI for putting the time in to making sours."
"This is a translucent red color, with only light carbonation. Smell is sour and tart with some apple and berry. Taste is tart and sour with raspberries, cherries, apple, and grape fruit presence. The alcohol is masked extremely well. Very drinkable, not overwhelmingly sour."
"Very drinkable despite the hefty abv, I'm very happy that I got to try it. Very good stuff."
""
"The wine barrel aging is much more noticeable. This big beer is dry enough and has the red wine characteristics down pat. I would have appreciated a bigger nose, and a little more sweetness to off-set the sour, otherwise a fun beer to try."
"O - Wonderful aroma, boring taste. I was really expecting more from this beer. Perhaps it just needs some age for the brett to start working up, but as a fresh wild ale it is really tame."
""
""
"Cost: $16.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"Beer drinks a little like an oude bruin but more fruity and less sour, mildly tannic at the back an interesting beer. Decent sour for the collection. I feel like with a name like Lolita this beer shouldn't be aged."
""
"Overall: I like it. It's unique and complex. I wouldn't want to drink it every night, but it's an interesting brew to have on occasion."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice light orange color with some pinkish hues. There's a bit of a white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries a good dosing of raspberries plus a bit of oak. There's a good bit of earth and moderate funk behind that as well. The flavor isn't quite as strong and integrated, but is nice nonetheless. Light-medium body with a good bit of acidity through the finish along with some dryness. No detectable alcohol. Really nice."
""
""
"Overall this could use a bit more of everything. Raspberries are weak. Belgian yeast character is lacking. Could use a bit of sweetness to back everything up, or some more malt influence. I'll lay one down for a while but I do not have much faith in this beer."
""
"Verdict: Very pleasant sour beer from Goose Island. I've yet to have a truly great sour from them, but they are definitely on the right track with Lolita."
""
"O. Very unique beer. Definitely has some wine like qualities, and shows how versatile that beer can be. Makes use of nice fruit flavors without being over your face or syrup like. Hides 9% very well. This is a beer that reminds you that craft beer is an art form. Glad I got to try it."
""
"Overall: Goose Island makes another really nice beer. Its delicate and balanced sour beer with nice complexity."
""
"2010 Vintage. 7% ABV. Pours almost clear, reddish amber color with a hint of pink. Small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is immediately musty with a bit of gym socks, followed by tart raspberries. Lots of raspberries with a bit of red wine vinegar. Taste is immediately sweet raspberries. Takes a bit for the tartness to kick in. Some oak flavors with tart raspberries and red wine. A little bit of brett flavor with grapefruit. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and VERY fizzy. Tart, but not puckering. Drinkability is high, as it is a refreshing and tasty beer. Overall, this is a good beer, but probably the least complex and least favorite of the ""Three Sisters"" of Goose Island."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It's not as good as the price point suggests, though. At least they got it to 9%."
"Overall, I am thinking this didn't really age that well, perhaps I missed it at its prime. That's the impression I got, but somehow I can still enjoy this great looking beer."
"This beer pours a light bodied Rose pink in color with a lot of carbonation and a quickly dissipating off white head. The nose features a touch of sweet raspberry before becoming very dry and offering aromas of oak aging and Brett. It’s very Belgian on the nose. It’s nice and features more berry as it warms. The flavors too begin with soft fresh raspberry sweetness before becoming very dry and tart. I get a good amount of Brett. It has nice flavor and no aspect is over the top. It drinks very light in body with a good amount of carbonation. Overall this is a nice, drinkable sour with intriguing flavors. If this was cheaper it would be far more appealing but I don’t think I’d buy much of this at 18.99. Nice beer though. Hopefully the other two sisters are available here soon."

"O- Great american wild ale. Would have liked the fruit to be as forward in the taste as the nose, but that's just me."

"O- A really nice, tasty beer. Very simple, tasty and surprisingly refreshing for 9%. Definitely a beer to try."
""
"O: Nice little beer, this Lolita. I don't know if I'd pay $16ish again for another bottle, but I won't be turning it down if offered at another tasting. Recommended as an entry level AWA, and for those looking for a little nuance with their funk."
""
""
""
"Overall: While I enjoyed this beer it is not my favorite. For 17.99 it would be hard for me to pick up this beer again."
""
""
"O: well this certainly doesn't drink like a 9% beer, lots of interesting stuff going on, I'm having trouble deciding if I like the way all of these flavors blend. Definitely unique for the style and worth a try."
""
""
"Overall, this is a damn nice wild ale that takes on fruit characteristics beyond whats normal. Goose Island knows how to take a beer and a barrel, and create a bomb ass creation. This is a prime example."
"Didn't expect to see a handful of these on the shelves, but when I did I was happy to pick a couple up. The beer is a nice ruby red color. Sodalike head that recedes to nothing immediately. Aroma has a lot of nice funk, with some raspberries, and a bit of acetic tartness. Flavor has some bitterness, raspberry, some barnyard funk, but not a lot, more acetic an lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is great. Dry, nice high carbonation, very refreshing. I really enjoy this beer. Sort of surprised they got this to 9% and kept it so dry. Outstanding."
"O- Surprising stuff, much less of a frilly dessert beer than I had initially expected. One of the better fruit beers or wild ales I've had in some time. Hopefully I can find another to age!"
""
"i like it, she loves it."
"O: This was a 16 or 17 dollar bottle, and absolutely worth it. Among the best American attempts at a funky Belgian that I have encountered. Not quite a proper lambic/geueze, really, but still damn good. Captures many of the desired ""wild"" characteristics in the best way, but in a balanced manner. Thoughtful to the last drop."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a very nice beer. The tart, sour raspberries were very good in it. A little more funkiness to add some complexity would have gone a long way for me. Very tasty beer overall though."

"Vintage 2010: Bottled 12/04/10. 650ml. brown bottle many thanks to Pierre-Luc and Julien. Ale brewed with raspberries aged in wine barrels. Salmon-orange with a white head. The nose is very appealling with red wine (pinot noir) and strawberry. I very like this nose. The taste is wonderfull with wine, pinot, raspberry. There is some oak as-well. This is an easy drinking beer by it's acidity. One of the best."

"o - overall, i'm impressed. i've been hangin onto this one for a while and decided to pop it open for a taste and was pleased i did so. i've been trying more lately and this one was pretty good in my opinion. here's to hoping this is brewed again soon."

"Pours a light red/pink with a pretty small head and a good mount of bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass. Smells strongly of tart raspberry. Taste is giant puckering sour upfront which fades nicely to raspberry. Carbonation and mouthfeel are pretty on par with what I expect out of a good wild ale. Overall pretty decent beer"

"Overall: A real decent wild ale. I've had better, and i've had worse. I would definitely drink this again though."
""
""
"O - Overall a very good wild ale, not quite up to the Supplication standard, but an excellent representation of the style nonetheless."
""

"Nice light red with touches of golden color gave it a nice bright appearence. tart grape skins, cherries and loads of funk, some light spiciness and a decent touch of oak. lots of dark fruit, tart funkiness and a nice earthy, woodsy like smell blending together very nicely on this one. Silk like smoothness, and the finest carbonation bubbles, really well done in that regard. ;ots of sour in here right up front with frapes and light lemon like citrus taking over. Rolling through some nice notes of cherry then came over me. Decent funkiness in through the middle and the finish"
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. Very flavorful taste even though the smell left a little to be desired for. This was the first of Three Sisters, so hopefully the others will follow through!"
"O: I really enjoyed this. I'm glad the barrel and fruit take over the smell and taste instead of vinegar or tartness. It provides a bit more balance than I'm used to with American Wild Ales."

"Overall Impression- Not sure if G.I. was using Lolita in the sense of the novel written in the 1950's but it sure was a good ""special release"" brew. I would suggest you getting the Madame Rose if @ the Goose Island Clybourn location. I haven't tried the Juliet but it is next on my list. The Lolita was easy drinking (like wine) with slight sour notes and raspberry. Enjoyed thoroughly!"
"Found at Cardinal Liq's, Niles IL"
"O_I would say this has more in common with a good Belgian Fruit Lambic than an American Wild. A very nice beer that highlights fruit and the barrels it was placed in. My only complaint is the lack of a proper head but this could have been unique to my bottle. i wish I had more to see how this develops."
"O - A good wild ale. I think I enjoyed Madame Rose slightly more, and haven't had Juliet yet. Would like more tartness, but the amount of funk here is pretty nice."
"Pours a slightly hazy watery cranberry color with a 1/2 inch fizzy white-red head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of tart raspberries, red wine vinegar, funk, and some wood aromas from the wine barrels. Taste is of tart raspberries, wood, and some minor funky flavors. A nice sour flavor lingers on the tongue and in the back of the throat after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel, There is also a slightly acidic quality to this one. Overall, this is a good wild ale with all the nice sour and funky aromas and flavors. I am glad I got to try one of these."
"O: I enjoyed this and had many pours."
"Def. Lolita wins this taste test."
"Appearance is gold with a rose tint to it, a smallish white head. The smell of Lolita contains raspberries, cherries, sugar and funk. I sipped this one and noticed tart raspberries right away, brett and an overall sweetness that goes with its` tart quality. MF medium with a nice level of carbonation. Try this one if you come across it."
"Lolita’s the perfect woman — bright and delicious, yet with an enticing sourness to keep you on your toes. I could sit here all night pondering her complexities, and I think I will."
"O: this is a great beer."
"Nice, I think it's better than Madame Rose, maybe not quite as tasty as Juliet. Worth trying if you can get it for less than the $25 it goes for in restaurants."
"Overall – I feel this is the weakest of the Three Sisters. The high carbonation combined with a thinner than usual mouthfeel really did throw off the beer making the flavors less prominent than I feel they could have been had the aforementioned two things been toned down a bit. I had no problem emptying my glass, and will be curious to see how this is after a few more years."
"Overall: Finding other flavors and depth beyond raspberry takes some effort, and there is nothing about it that really moves me. Compared to some of the other complex beers of this style, this is fairly forgettable."
"O: This is really lovely and delicious and easy to drink. It's more than the sum of its parts. I would drink this on any summer afternoon, were it available in my part of the country (and a little less expensive)."
"(O) I've only had the Juliet before this one and Lolita was a nice follow-up to that. It was a bit like Juliet but with more berry presence than grape presence. Just wish we could get this a bit more."
"Poured brownish red with no head into my DFH signature glass. Aroma of oak and funk, not much of a hint of raspberries but it is there in the background. Taste follows the nose, really oaky more than most beers I've had. More fruit in the taste. Tart but still smooth while hiding the alcohol. Tasty beer, I'm glad I tried it!"
"O - Overall a very good brew. Should go well with goat cheese. Its not my favorite of the GI Wild Series."
"Well crafted and tasty. Solid enough across the board, save for the appearance."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. A reasonable pour produced a barely there head, a puff of smoke if you will. A thin white ring remains. Deep orangish red, and oddly enough some purple hughes as well. The nose is where this beer does its thing. Sharp, sour raspberry all the way, very lactic. Faint, faint white oak aroma. Sadly the flavor doesn't depart much from the nose. Not much complexity. Fruity, but lactickly sour raspberry, sharp and lemony. The sour really gets right into your nose. Some oak and vanilla hits the tongue. Thats it. Fair mouthfeel for a wild, not thin, I think the raspberry rounds that out. This beer is ok, I have one in the cellar for later and it is good enough for me to think about grabbing another to age a bit longer. All in all, more wood and more funk please."
"I didnt have much paper available to me at the time that I drank this so my notes are really sparse. I noted a rating for ASTMO but only a few notes about the beer itself so I'll keep this short. Taste was tart, very raspberry/cherry, with a great, very carbonated mouthfeel that spread through the mouth excitedly. Taste wasn't extremely complex or dynamic, mostly just straight up raspberries/cherries with varying sensations of tartness or sweetness. It was reminiscent of Lost Abbey's Red Poppy to me in this sense though this was a little less layered I'd say. Good, glad I tried it, not sure it's worth seeking out though or worth the price."
"Overall, I enjoyed this, but my expectations were a little higher.  The high carbonation kind of ruins it for me.  However, anyone who enjoys sparkling wine or any red wine would probably like this."
"This one would make a great outdoor summertime drink. Its flavor profile is not burdensome and it's body is light and airy."
"O: My first of the 3 sisters. I was happy with my first go. It's nice to have an american wild that goes the funky route instead of just bracingly sour. The flavors work really well, good for summer. This would have been great with more carbonation."
"Overall quite funky wit nice fruit aromas and flavor. Not nearly as comlex and gratifying as Juliet though."
"2/21/2011"
"Overall: The mild raspberry and wine notes were very nice together, and I enjoyed the fact that they didn't overpower the beer. Sour notes are there but they let the fruit do it's job."
"O- The well blended soft tartness supports the full dark fruit flavor with a nice bit of acidity. It would be nice to taste a little more of the funk and wood but it is delicious non the less."
"D-A very easy drinking and thirst quenching beer; not really all that tart or sour, which I was kind of hoping it would be."
"O: If this didn't have the big sweetness to it, I would have really enjoyed it a lot more. As it stands, just a good beer."
"Overall, a pretty solid sour. Easy drinking. I still wish the taste was more like the nose, however. Another solid offering."
"Served in a snifter glass and pours a rosy, rust colored red with a slight head. Very raspberry fruity nose with some acetone type notes as well. Light mouthfeel. Raspberry sweetness upfront with a slight bitterness, almost like biting and tasting raspberry seeds. No booze notes at all to speak ok. Some mild acetone type sourness but not overly mouthpuckering by any means. I think this is a really decent beer right now but with time should develop further to increase its mediocre complexity."
"Overall very nice. Would buy a bottle if I see one."
"Overall: Goes down easy but isn't very interesting...kind of like a young slut aka a Lolita"
"Again, I wish there was a little more focus on the raspberries. The tartnesss and acidity is spot on though. This is an enjoyable beer to sip on a sunny afternoon."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink for the style because the sourness and tartness are not overpowering."
"Overall: Tasty and refreshing on a day like this. Nice fruit profile."
"o - Was between buying a bottle of this and Madame Rose and while I have still not had Madame Rose, I was very happy with my choice. Overall I thought this was a great, very drinkable sour. It isn't the most funky or sourest wild ale out there, but was refreshing and a beer I felt like I could have drank the whole bottle of. Light sour raspberries and cherries complimented by light funk and oak. Would love to get more of this one."
"The first pour of Lolita yields a radiant, clear, cherry red beer. There's a little bit of pink tinged foam crowning the beer, but it fades quickly and without leaving a trace. The second pour would introduce some sediment and cloud the beer up. The nose is very raspberry centric, with a bit of acidity to it. It comes across as a less bold Weyerbacher Riserva. The flavor has a bit more nuance to it, as pure raspberry is smoothed out by some dark fruitiness from the wine barrels. In addition, there's a little bit of funk to take the vinegar edge off the noticeable tartness. I have to say, for a beer that specifically mentions brett but no other critters, it sure is still overpoweringly sour rather than funky. This one finished out just a little too dry for me, either that or it was too highly carbonated. Whatever the cause, that balance was thrown off and resulted in an overly spritzy mouthfeel, especially towards the end of the beer once it had warmed some. Were it not for a pretty great flavor Goose Island gets from the raspberries Lolita aged on, it'd be an entirely average attempt at a wild ale."
"Overall: Decent beer but not that impressive or worth seeking out."
"It was okay to drink but like all of the Goose Island sours (except for MAYBE Juliet), I would never seek it out or bother trying it again."
"Tasting not surprisingly of raspberry, light acidity and some mild funk flavors. Extremely smooth and easy drinking. Definitely does not come across as a 7% abv beer. Healthy carbonation and a light body. Second of the three sisters in preference. Madame Rose easily beats this on my scale. Partially wild, but mostly tamed. It is good but I would hesitate at the wild ale categorization in taste but the aroma seems about right."
"Overall, Goose Island might be the king of bourbon barrels, but they're definitely far away from being the kings of wine barrels. I don't see Lolita improving with age, because I do not see any flavor notes that are hidden that will improve over time, but only time will tell."
"Hazy reddish-amber. The head dissipates quickly, settling to a thin collar. Tons of brettanomyces on the nose, leaving a damp barnyard aroma. There's a juicy raspberry character beneath the funk along with mild acetic notes. The palate is juicy and lightly acetic, heavy on funky brett with a mild but pleasant raspberry note. Finishes with light tannins, lactic sourness. Very dry, but only mildly sour."
"D: Could be a touch less sour and more fruity, a little bit worse in this category than the other two GI sours (Juliet & Madame Rose)."
"D - Not your every day standard, but interesting. The tartness will slow you down if you're not a fan of sour styles."
"Tart and puckering, seedy raspberry, minor authentic fruit-derived sweetness. Very distinct raspberry notes, mildly acetic. Wet oak. Clean and crisp feel, very quenching. A bit simple, could use more Brett complexity and barrel character. As it is, it seems young. The fruit forward character is nice, and the body is light and crisp, though it ultimately seems to be lacking a bit in depth."
"M/D - Medium body and very dry. Champagne-like carbonation. Very easy to drink, but hard to drink fast due to how dry it is."
"D: It's not a bad beer but I don't know that I would be inclined to drink more than one."
"D: Oh Yes! Without a doubt!! Whish I could get more of this. :-( So lucky to have though!!"
"D: Fantastic drinkability here. Like Madame Rose, this is a sour that doesn't strip the enamel from your teeth. I can't imagine what a 1/6 barrel of this would cost, but this (and Madame Rose) is something I can could see putting on in my kegerator."
"(D)- A good one for sure. Age will open this up more; too bad I cant find out until they actually release this outside of their bar and restaurants."
"overall - i think i prefer madame rose in flavor, but this in sour dryness. i think this has potential for being a big sour with age."
"This is an outstanding beer and a great addition to Goose Islands already fantastic barrel aged series. G.I. has got their barrel game down."
"Lolita is initially flavorful but unobtrusive, which will make it a very nice pairing with just about any kind of fish. Its compatibility with food may be the reason that Goose Island decided that it would limit distribution to restaurants. It's a shame because I believe that -- like its ""sister"" Juliet -- some age could open this beer up and bring it to the next level."
"Whilst out to bear witness to an '80s extravaganza, what better beer to order than a wild that made it only to precious few stores in the area? It pours a clear garnet-amber topped by a minor bit of dirty white foam. The nose comprises light raspberry, cranberry, cobwebs, Brett, peaches, red apple, and sour cherry. The taste holds notes of tart orange, cobwebs, Brett, light caramel, light cream cheese, lime, and grapefruit zest. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a pretty good wild, but nothing really outstanding here by any means. To me, it's too much like an odd, tart wine to allow thorough enjoyment."
"D: The appearance and smell of this beer leads me to believe that this one's gonna be amazing... But the taste never quite gets there. Not really tight, funky, or oaky. I would definitely like to revisit this one somewhere down the line, but as is, I'll pass for now."
"M-D: body and carbonation both fit the brew well. Drinks easily and enjoyably. A solid offering."
"D - solid, no big flaws, interesting take on style."
"This is another beer I look forward to trying with some age. The beer right now is young... With some time, I see this really becoming great."
"A nice splurge, especially for those who enjoy the style."
"Overall, I was pretty impressed with this beer. I am, admittedly, a Goose Island fanboy, but this was a solid beer either way. The fact that it is $26 and [mostly] in restaurants only means I probably won't be trying it again anytime soon, which is shame..."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, this is a good beer, but not great, and was not quite as good as what I was hoping for."
"Great brew! This is a very primary beer; it lacks the complexity of some Wild ales but beautifully displays its fruit characteristics. Perhaps with age the secondary characteristics will come out more, however, like the Juliet I would be afraid that the beautiful display of fruit would fade robbing the beer of its best quality. Well-done Goose Island! It was a treat seeking these beers out. I look forward to the 2011 versions."
"I liked this better than Juliet, maybe tied with Madame Rose. Nothing special by any means. Being only in expensive restaurants at $29 a bottle I just can't recommend this despite the above average rating."
"Interesting beer and something I'm looking forward to trying again, but not sure how much you could drink in one sitting. Nevertheless, this is one to seek out once they bottle it later this year - delicious!"
"Fizzy, decent body, fine for the style. Not an easy drinker, complex brew that is good not great."
