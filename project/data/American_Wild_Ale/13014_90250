Flavor is oaky berries, cherry, leather, tobacco, very tart, some additional funky barnyard thing, acidic and sour, graham cracker, vinous warmth in the throat.

(this is my second brett beer I've had, so I'm still getting used to the style). It wants to be many things all at once but you can still pick out each individual component.

Aromas of tart cherries and lemon with a bit of brown sugar and chocolate at the edges. The flavor is light lactic tart with a healthy dose of funk but still has a bit of residual malty sweetness left to it. The darker malts lend to a slightly chalky mouthfeel, medium body and a moderate level of carbonation. Decent wild ale but nothing horribly exciting.","johnnnniee","May 25, 2014"

The barrel ends up dominating the base beer giving lots of earthy and woody flavors and heavily influences the overall with a big red wine character. Sourness/tartness is held in check a bit - a nice mid-level intensity almost on par with a Flanders Red - which this beer resembles in flavor. Tannic, fruity, reasonably dry overall. Nice beer.","portia99","Sep 17, 2013"

The aroma is of sour cherries, green apples, and jolly rancher. The taste is has some nice sour and tart notes, but doesn't quite create the pucker factor I usually look for in a sour. It does, however, have a really nice complimentary funkiness that fills in admirably in place of the pucker. In fact, the sour-funky combo give this beer a dimension that I can't recall encounterint before. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry with spritzy carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is another winner from Surly. I only wish I'd have bought more than one bottle when I had the chance.","KarlHungus","May 13, 2013"

3.18,-23.4,2.75,4,3,2.5,3,"Pours from a wax-sealed 750mL bottle cola brown with a very transient dark foam head. Quite effervescent, after 15 seconds the head is completely gone but for a thin rim around the glass. So it's not much in appearance, although the bottle is hellishly cool looking. Pervasive smell is of a high quality red wine vinegar, perhaps a hint of Worcestershire sweetness, balsamic, oak and tart cherries. Certainly it smells good, like something I'd want to use for cooking a fine roast shoulder in a reduction with mushrooms and rosemary. Now the taste is immediately far less pungent than the nose suggests, which is a bit disappointing. It's pretty zippy, high carbonation and quite watery on the palate. Back to the taste..it's lightly tart cherries washed with a weak solution of Heinz white vinegar, there is some sense of balsamic sweetness as well. So sweet and sour, medium dry, again watery, and strong carbonation, all sitting on a sort of thinnish brown ale like underpinning. Well then. 6.66% ABV","JackieTH","Feb 21, 2013"

The funk and tartness are more approachable for the style, but the come itty of the flavor is what grabs my attention. If not for the price tag, I would buy up another couple of these. Well done overall for the style though.","jera1350","Feb 20, 2013"
