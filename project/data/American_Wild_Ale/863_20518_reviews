"Sanctification is a great mild sour ale.  It's got some fruit, a little sweetness, a little tart, and a little funk.  It's crisp and refreshing and extremely drinkable (if you like a little tartness).  Lovely stuff."
""
"Quite possibly one of my favorite of all time"
"Not my style, but crisp and refreshing."
""
"An underrated one of the Russian River sours."

"On draft at Monk's charity event on 3-2-15 in Philly. Tasty 8 oz. pour was very crisp and tart. One of the better ""tion"" ales I've had....now back to the Younger."
""
"Overall - A simply fantastic beer.  My bottle is from 2011 and it is holding up very well.  Actually reminds me a bit of a Lost abbey cable car in some ways.  World class stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"F: Crisp and dry with a lip-smacking tartness. Goes well with an aged sharp white cheddar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dry taste. Not bad but not great"
""
"Poured into a ISO tasting glass from the ""Vinnie"" bottle - Aroma is funky. I let it warm and got some major barnyard and hay with some lemon in there. The flavor is crisp and lightly tart. It's just enough to make your mouth water a bit. I got light fruit notes at first, light apple, similar to a cider or white wine. This beer is so drinkable and shares similarities to a much lesser alcohol wild beer or geuze, it's surprising this is a nearly 7% beer."

"Pours Crystal clear golden blonde in color witha frothy white head that retains nicely. Smell has nice tart brett funk and semi sweet grainy malt with notes of white grape, lemon peel, hay and barnyard. Taste follows the nose with tart lemon crisp sour funk forward with a chalky sour citrus flavor. Barnyard straw and a sharp cheesy funky finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body with sticky sour acidic finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tart and fruity on the palate but not overly sour. Notes of lemon and grapefruit are balanced out by the Brett funk, but it's not in-your-face. A more subtle sour beer that can be enjoyed by anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Russian River takes a brett fermented saison style beer to the next level with a delicious citrus zing and near perfect mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Although sours aren’t my favorite style, this is one of my favorite sours."
""
""
""
"The beer finishes with a distinct, acidic sourness, while a sweet malt note provides an impression of adding ripe lemons."
""
"First experience with a Russian River and love it. Crisp and clean beyond compare."
""
""
"Banana, melon, lemon, that signature bretty character. Hints of citrus and some cracker. Nice tartness with a touch of funk."
""
""
""
"O: Complex and delicious, couldn't ask for much more"
""
""
""
"This is really interesting. This is my first sour ale ever. This smells like a sour shock top. The taste is like a really fermented and watered down shock top. Sours are not my thing"
"I had this on draft at the brewery and thought it was great . I have a bottle doing a little shelf time, I hope I can let it sit for awhile to see how it taste after some time. But changes are I drink that bad boy lol"

"Not my favorite from RR. A little bland without fruit incorporation. Wish they used  lacto and pedio for a sharper bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"This light funk comes out further on the palate, with a Bretty lemony hay flavor that doesn't overpower in the least. Utterly fantastic.  I had this on tap but would love to see what some age does to change it further."

"Batch 003. Pours a hazy straw with a thick white head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Bread and Brett on the nose, with hints of lemon and fresh-cut grass. Sour on the palate with green apple and lemon notes. Dry finish. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, a well crafted sour."

"Pours golden blonde, short head dissipates quickly, minimal lacing. Sour cherry, ""clean"" malt in the nose. Taste is of sour cherry, green apple, some Brett funk. Mouthfeel consists of medium body, good carbonation, and a pretty dry and long finish. Overall another solid RR sour/wild beer. A must try in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty spot on. Slightly spritzy but smooth with a very pleasantly dry finish."

"Overall: Pretty good sour. I like that this has the citrus flavors rather than the horse blanket flavor. I think that I would have this a little colder than I did on this one. It was only about 60F when I drank it, somewhere around 50F would be better for sure. For the price of this (this bottle was 12 oz and cost $18) isn't worth it unless you are really into sours. If you see it for a decent price it's not bad."

"Pours gold with a one finger head, but not for long. Smell is very mellow. Slightly tart, with some fruity qualities, and a Brett smell, as well. Picking up some green apple and grapes. Getting a lot of these flavors in the taste. Not too sour, slightly tart with some apple, peach, grape flavors up front and some nice carbonation to make it tingle on the tongue. A little bit of Brett and funk but mostly dominated by fruit flavors. An amazing balance, really. Also some hay/grass flavor mixed in around all the other flavors. My second RR sour and, once again, I've very impressed."

"O: Just a beautiful beer. Refreshingly tart and drinkable, yet provides a solid array of flavors and aromas. Not as complex as its bacteria inoculated cousins for obvious reasons, but is a fantastically balanced example of a 100% Brett beer. Right on Vinnie!"

"Poured on draft at the brewery. chalk board noted this was the 2013 batch, poured March 4, 2014. pours hazy yellow with white head. Sour apple aroma, vinegar, lots of Brett. Nice Brett on the flavor with sweet citrus fruits and lemon peel, some pears and green apples. Tart and lactic but not mouth puckering sour to deal with here. Very light and goes down easy with near spritzy carbonation. Really nice Brett beer that I would definitely have again."

"O: Great sour, i could drink it forever. Does not overpower you. just delightful."
"O: Ahh, one of the best sours I've had. Had temptation last night but this is way better. Not as sour, not as wine-y. Very crisp and refreshing. Not as complex but it works well. Nice refreshing tartness. Really ups the drinkability. Not overpowering either; well-balanced. Really well made."

"Poured a nice cloudy gold with a one finger white head that grew to a two finger white head and stayed around as a ring of white as the glass was emptied, leaving some thin lacing. Abundant bubbles flowed up the side of the glass. Quite beautiful. Scents of brett, barnyard funk, white grape skin, white wine, overripe fruit, green apple, slight pineapple, and the slightest hints of vanilla and candi sugar. A very good aroma, complex with the usually sour, fruity, white wine notes and some more common Belgian notes beneath. Flavor is sour upfront, with that musky brett funk, white grapes, tart green apple, lemon juice, sourdough bread undertones, some oak, some slight medicinal bitterness, finishes bitter with a bit of a citrus rind flavor and aftertaste as well as a dry finish. A very sour flavor, with all sorts of sour fruit and sour funk flavors. Very nice with some complexity brought in by the sourdough bread and oak. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a nice refreshing feel with a drying finish. Nice and drinkable, on point for a sour, very good. Overall this is a very good sour. The 100% brett gives it that incredibly sour flavor but it manages a bit of complexity in spite of it, that gives it a fine flavor profile. Very good, and I wish I could get it easier."

"This is only the 2nd of the sour beers I have tried from RR. The first was Supplication. Supplication was way better as there were more flavors coming from the fruits. However this is a good beer and I'm glad to try it. RR makes so many sours that I have to try others before trying this one again."

"A classic sour from RR. A lazy straw yellow small cream head  with lots of lace on the glass. Mouth feel is sour and dry. Flavors of tart apples with a slight sweet aftertaste. Some slight herb bitterness but not from the hops. Kind of like an apple sour candy on drugs."
""
""
""
""
"What a beer this is. Patience is a virtue, and I believe this beer is over a year in the making from mash to bottling. A perfect example of craft beer being art, and brewers becoming legends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good, starts off pretty medium. Overall very smooth and perfectly carbonated. Consistent most of the way with a nice dry and tart finish, almost makes you pucker, pretty much have to force yourself not to smile. Really drinkable, a nice sipper for my taste, I like it a lot. I'm starting to understand all the hype around Russian River."
""
""
""
""
"Nices sour, tart citrus and some sweetness. 6/10 sourness, medium high carb with semi dry finish."
""
"O: Being my first sour, I found this quite enjoyable. At first the sourness hits your palate pretty hard, but eases after it swooshed around a couple times. It is very carbonated and poured a thick head with lots of bubbles. The fruity and citrus taste is prevalent throughout. Overall, a very tasty quality sour."
""
"Overall a fantastically balanced sour and one I could see being a gateway for people looking to get into sour ales. Tart but not overpowering and highly drinkable."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""

"O - Not a funky beer per the ""fermented with 100% Brett"" on the bottle. But, it's a sour fruity beer lovers dream!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"13 Dec 2014 snifter tasting notes: sweat, earthy citrus peel, hop- and flower stem-like bitterness, granola malt tones... jade/goldenrod color... 'seashell' overtones?... aromas of ornamental flowers (potpourri?) and drying, overripe orange skin... grapefruit in the finish, but not really fruity or acidic..."
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a white head. Like fresh cut grass, a little funk and some belgian malts with a little bit of lemon. Taste starts off with a tart bite that's almost like sucking on a lemon, then moves onto a horseblanket funkyness. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is high. Overall pretty dam good beer."
"Verdict: A wonderful Wile Ale from Russian River, not that it's a surprise. Despite the lack of wood aging and bugs, this beer is still quite balanced and amply complex. A definite must try for anyone who likes sours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had the pleasure of picking this up at RR earlier this year, and let's just say the trip was definitely worth it!"
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice looking golden color with a bubbly white head on top. The lacing and retention was both very thin. The smell of the beer gives off a sour note as well as a nice subtle malt essence in there also. The taste of the beer is really well balanced between the sour elements and the beer itself. It's got a very good 1 - 2 punch going from sour to malty. The mouthfeel is light bodied and very drinkable, this is also on the refreshing side. Overall this Russian River brew hits many of the high notes it should and it worth checking out. Glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - despite being fermented with 100% Brett, I wouldn't call this a funky ale. It's more fruity and tart than funky. That's fine. It's a tasty beer, but it's my least favorite RR sour."
""
"Overall: Russian River does it again. I feel they pretty much own the AWA category at this point in my young sour appreciating life. Very quaffable, full of complex flavours that satisfy my palate without overloading it while not being too heavy on any one particular characteristic. I am a big fan and will continue to seek out the Russian River offerings whenever I can get them. And you should too. (4.25)"

"Pours light amber, hazy, with a small head. The aroma bodes poorly: Brett/wild ale with some vinegar. Intimidating. Given that, the taste was a bit better but still too funky. Nicely sour with a hint of old bread. Fine medium-light feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Awesome, I want to drink these all summer but I can't because I live in TN...occasionally I must though."
""
""

"I do love a good unique beer and Russian River has certainly come up with one with this. What the heck is a sour blond? Well, unless you find one of these you may never know, it is that unique. It is really sour, almost as if they dosed it with lemon zest, and the result is a treasure. It is not the most beautiful beer I've ever seen, the head is average, the ABV is average but when this brew hits your palate you'll know what a sour blond is, it only takes a moment. WOW! OK, I admit that a trip to the RR Brewery helped, so I waited to review a bottle. The small taster at the home pub at RR was not enough to judge, but now that I have opened a bottle I am convinced that this is a world class ""occasional"" beer. Unlike those great IPAs, drinkable by the gallon, this one requires a bit of time to enjoy and savor in it's uniqueness. Lest it be confused, this is not a hop beer, it is a blond that happens to pucker, have I mentioned unique, yes try and you'll be aware that a real style can deliver. I have no idea, but I guess the brewmaster had a demonic possession and he just broke out of hell with Santification. Try it but be prepared to pucker and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this bottle was a bit of a disappointment. It was good, but not as good as I remember it on tap last month. I bought the bottle from the taproom and am assuming they're from the same years batch, maybe the keg had some age though. In either event, I stocked up and have four more in the cellar. I'll be back in a few years"

"D: not overly complex, but still highly drinkable. the tartness is pretty mellow and this is definitely more on the barnyard side of Brett. a good beginner brew for people looking to get into sours."
""
""
"Overall: Probably my least favorite of the RR sours I've tried, but still an excellent beer. Refreshing and pretty easy to drink. It tastes kind of like a sour saison. Definitely worth picking up a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very refreshing beer to have during a hot summer day or late at night when your craving something out of the ordinary or even when treating yourself to something special for no real occasion like my self at the moment. But regardless, really enjoying this RR brew. Very unique brew with a light and subtle character yet complex and unique. I guess that's what you get when you have a brewery in the heart of California Wine country, a brewery and beer that speaks for itself and stands out naturally."

"O-This is another great Russian River wild/sour ale. Brewers can sometimes overplay their hand when it comes to brett beers, but this one manages to keep the smell and flavors that brett imparts without making brett the only thing going on. I'm not sure if this was the right beer to drink on a snowy March evening, but I will certainly search this out again in warmer seasons."

"Another damn good Russian River wild ale. I don't think it's possible for them to put out a bad one. This is probably one of the more funky ones that I've had, but it still had an intense sour element right off the bat, so nothing was lost in that department. Thanks again to Jeff for breaking this one out."

"O - like I said above, my favorite sour to date. Ultra balanced between the flavor profile, level of sourness and mouthfeel. Just an excellent beer, would buy this again and again."

"O: A decent Russian river beer. Nowhere near as bad as New Belgiam's Brett Beer. Very nice balance between funk and tart."
"Very cool, unique beer here. This brew pours hazy, light amber with some sediment and a very thin head. Smell is mostly of yeast and bretts, with some grapefruit, pear and apple. You can smell just how tart this beer is, and the taste is there to match. Tons of citrus (predominantly lemon and lime), tart and crisp, very refreshing served very cold. Fairly dry, and not overly acidic. Very light with tons of carbonation. Stimulates every taste receptor in your mouth and makes you salivate. Super clean finish, just leaves you wanting more. A little pricey, but super drinkable... this is a new favorite."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the heavy tartness to the nose and flavoring, and the broad sweeping complexity of it. From the time you pop the bottle your nose fills with this juicy, insanely funky beast of an aroma, with crisp paler malts, and an accompaniment of yeast, fruits, and musky components. These translate well through the taste buds, with a massive bittering tartness from the first drop to the last. The nicely retained head affords soft creaminess to every sip, and helps Sanctification hold up proudly amongst its brothers and sisters in the series."

"O: This beer is a great marriage of sour and blond the brett plays a great key role I throughly enjoyed this beer especially the taste and feel. It is not mind-blowing but it is a really solid sour and another impressive offering from RR i would recommend it if you can get your hands on it."

"Overall: Definitely one of my favorite beers of all time. Complex, yet very thirst quenching and refreshing. The Brettanomyces really takes on a hugely tropical tone in this beer and makes the beer only slightly tart. This is a great beer for the both the sour novice and the seasoned ""sour head"" Highly recommended."

"O/D-Another well-trained stud from Russian River. Not my favorite ""-tion"" but its better than 80% of anything sour I have tried. Next time I have a chance I will gladly lay lip to this wacky, Bretty beast."

"Overall I enjoyed this very much for my first time sampling it. I was always hesitant because of the inflated price tage but for $5 on draft at a bar during Zwanze Day, why not give it a go (or 2). I enjoy this offering more than Supplication as I feel it is a bit more complex and the flavor profile pops just a bit more."

"O - Great beer from Russian River that reminds me of a tarter and more lively version of Orval. It has a nice mix between Brett funk and the tart sour flavors you come to expect from Russian River. Really was surprised by how good this on was."
""
"Great citrus flavor with nice barrel and vinous notes. An excellent example of a pale American wile ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the closer AWA's that I have tried to get the gueuze style. Really delicious and refreshing. Love that sour bite."
""
""
"O-very enjoyable, simply well-crafted"
""
""
"This is a pretty even and smooth wild ale. Nothing really showy, but it's consistent and smooth. The brett is in no way obnoxious or outlandish. I have to say that this beer is in no way blowing me away. It's good, yeah. But there is no real outstanding character. Consistent, sure. Amazing? Not so much so."
""
"O- This was kind of similar to a much less funky, more barnyard version of Beatification. There were definitely some nice things going on in this beer and it's definitely better then your average sour however I would take Beat any day over Sanctification. The souring did add a nice presence to the blonde ale, which you can still taste the presence of underneath. Overall I'd definitely recommend trying this beer, but can't recommend it over other offerings such as Beatification and Sanctification."
""
""
"D - Very easy to crush this one. The sour elements are beyond accessible and it does the job in terms of avoiding funk while still giving off apparent Brett. Easy recommendation here."
""
"O- RR is amazing. Sanctification is an excellent sour that I highly recommend seeking out. The usage of Brett in the brew is excellent"
""
""
"Overall a very good blonde sour beer. I don't have much experience with wild ales, but this one is approachable and enjoyable."
""
""
"A solid brew although I've had better from RR. Very tame, could be a beginner sour. Thanks stupac2!"
"O- This is my last offering that was brought home from Russian River. I'm sad to see them all drank, but happy that I got to try them. Russian River truly brews wonderful, flavorful, and creative beers."
"Appearance is straw yellow with a very slight haze. Fair amount of lace on the glass. Smell very much reminds me of belgian pale ales and strong ales. A nice yeasty aroma. Hints of banana and bread. Lots of lemon in the taste. Mild/moderately sour. Bit of bitterness as the beer warms up. Soft carbonation provides a nice mouthfeel. Overall a very good, drinkable beer."
"This is probably my favorite American Wild Ale yet. I like that it's lighter sour with a decent amount of tartness and it's basically just not too over the top of an Am. Wild Ale. Though I am sometimes in the mood for a mouthpuckeringly sour beer, this beer is nothing like that and I could probably have one of these just about any time. This could actually be a pretty good intro beer to those who haven't yet ventured into the world of sours/wild ales. Really good and quite drinkable."
""
""
"O: a fantastic beer and I'm extremely happy with it. I would trade for it again, shutout to DovaliHops for the bottle!"

""
""
""
""
"O: Super-light, very drinkable, and quite tasty. Highly recommended. Will have again."

"This is a tasty beer that's not too funky and rather dry."

""
"Recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly good drinkability. Something I could have fairly often. Very well crafted."
""
"Bottle: Poured a slightly dirty bright yellow color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some light lacing. Aroma of Brett is quite intense and dominates with light tart and dry notes also being noticeable. Taste is mostly dominated by dry and tart notes with some malt also perceptible. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed though maybe a tad too one-dimensional with the Brett notes and not my favourite RR beer."

"Still delicious!"
""

""

"Very lively carbonation, tart acidity, and dryness combine to make this beer very quick on the palate! However, as it sits and settles, slower, more nuanced tasting can be achieved. Tart lemon acidity up front. Some grassy flavors and a hint of grainy malt as well. Overall, the tart, acidic citrus dominates. Musty, yeasty funk comes in mid-palate. Very dry finish, with some almost-pucker-inducing grapefruit. Lingering horse blanket. Delicious and quite drinkable for how ""wild"" it is. Another great RR sour!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O : Defines Brett nicely, refreshingly tart and not overly sour. I could session this forever on nice warm summer days. Well done American Wild Ale by Russian River who never lets me down. While there COULD be more to it I suppose, this is what it was designed to be I think - an homage to Brett."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Heard some Orval comparisons, but again the Euro makers do it better. Orval blows this out of the water. Good though. A-"
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nicely balanced wild ale. The tartness is really nice and the finish is crisp and refreshing."
"Very well done RR! Just have Beatification left!"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, but probably my least favorite RR wild thus far. Almost more like a slightly tart Belgian Ale. Still very tasty though and would certainly never pass on it."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer really good...borderline heavenly! I wish I lived on the west coast so I could have regular access to it!"
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"much more a betyer beer okder than new, a thermd I'm not surthe newer will age as well. might beer a different yeast"
""
"One of the most drinkable and to me, enjoyable beers in the Russian River lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression - I enjoy the simplicity of Sanctification; it's an easy-sipping wild ale. I'm glad I have another bottle."
""
""
"O: Really pleasant beer. Not necessarily puckering sour, but a good amount of tartness. I prefer the Supplication for sure, but this is a nice light warm weather beer."
""
"My first experience with a RR sour. It's good, but the aftertaste is a bit of a bummer. Didn't quite live up to what I was hoping. Hopefully beatification will be more rewarding!"
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but my least favorite of the -tions. There is a pleasant tartness, but I could use more lacto and a little less brett as the mustiness got overpowering at times. Still will go back, but not as often as the others."
""
"Body is medium in heft, with prickly carbonation and a dry finish from some residual sugars. Carbonation feels right for the beer, avoiding having a somewhat acidic beer linger on the palate too long."
""
""
""
"O: I'm admittedly not a huge fan of the sour beers and I was a bit intimidated before I opened this one. However, I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. The ""sourness"" is not at all aggressive and while it is present, it presents more like a ""tart"" than ""sour," and even then it is balanced by a mild sweetness. A very nice beer."
""
""
""
"Had this at the brewpub. Pours a light, slightly hazy yellow. Tastes slightly sour, tart with some lemon and grass notes. Makes your mouth pucker in a nice way. very impressed with their wild ales. This brewery blows my mind, and attacks my taste buds beautifully."
""
""
"have been keen to try this one for a long time, 100% brett fermentation. finally splurged for 18 bucks at cheeky monk on colfax. pours an almost perfectly clear radiant gold nugget color with huge bubbles. looks lind of like apple juice. the last little bit i poured in has some serious sediment, i think i poured out just a tiny bit more than i was supposed to, but no harm done. small but lasting white head. smells fruity and sour, but not nearly as intense as the flavor, which is really puckery from the brettanomyces. some notes of dank oak come in, as does a white wine like dryness in the finish. this is a love it or hate it kind of beer, and i absolutely love it. the mouthfeel is amazing, majorly effervescent carbonation and a rather light body make it supremely drinkable. this is a very interesting and unique brew that has no equal in my mind. i cant wait to drink another one of these!"
""
""
"O: My first sour. A interesting delicious brew!"
""
""
""
"O: Overall a really good beer.  It seems that RR hits a home run with every wild ale they produce.  This is probably my least favorite of the 4 I have tried (Supplication, Consecration, and Temptation being the others), but being the least favorite RR sour is like being the ugliest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model.  You just can't go wrong.  Another job well done RR.  "
""
""
""
"Pours a dark yellow with a white head and nice lacing. Tart aroma of grapes and apple with a touch of sweetness hiding in there and some controlled funk. Kinda wine like in flavor with the grapes and apples teaming up to give it some sweetness and a nice tartness bordering on sourness, a little wood in there as well and a wonderfully controlled funkiness. Medium bodied, not much carbonation. Overall, a nice enjoyable wild ale though maybe a touch too much wine-like for my personal tastes."
"O: A great beer, and very interesting considering it is brett only."
""
""
""
"O - Wonderful tartness and flavor. Making me wonder if I should fly to RR or not?!"
""
""
"Overall real solid as to be expected, I think I still might prefer consecration but nobody is complaining here."

"Overall I enjoyed this sour. Great sour presence that isn't overwhelming."
"I could drink quite a bit of this stuff without getting board, my first RR sour and I'm very pleased I'm going to get to try 3 more in the near future thanks to the most awesome Rutager"
"Overall- An excellent beer. One of my favorites from RR. It's sort of surprising because it's more ""simple"" than some of their others, but it's just fantastic. Wish I had more! I do miss Cali sometimes..."
""
""

"I was looking for something complex and this one just didn't deliver. Looking back, I know i had my expectations all wrong, but at the same time, you can make the base malt a little more interesting. There really wasn't much to this beer that I could isolate as interesting. I love the idea of just fermenting with a bacteria though. Gotta give it to them for doing something that no other brewery has tried (to my knowledge). I think a real problem with this was that I had it too cold and in the wrong glassware. The small serving glasses that Harry's serves is more like a tiny Pilsener glass, when something like this would be much better in a globe or tulip glass with something to keep head retention. In my opinion, most beer is served too cold, and I feel it really hurt this beer in particular. Would try it again if someone had it in a bottle or served it properly, but I'm not going out of my way to find it."
"additional info Batch 006"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’ve quite enjoyed this beer and am looking forward to aging a couple of these to see how it changes over the next year or so. This is a well made version of the style and its very interesting to be able to explore the complexity contributed by the Brettanomyces as the primary ferementation yeast. My overall impression is that this is a very well made beer that can be summed up in two words, “complex” and “subtle.”"
""

""

"Mouthfeel is great due to the carbonation. Overall, you should expect nothing less from Russian River. It's outstanding. Buy as much as you can (afford)"
"Pours a deep gold with 2 fingers of fizzy white head that quickly recede to a thin layer. The aroma is very tart up front, lots of sour green apples, slightly vinuous behind the tartness. As it opens up I get some wet hay funk. The taste is slightly puckering but not overwhelming. This is extremely well balanced between tart and funky.It is so well balanced that it is extremely drinkable, no problem finishing off the small bottle myself. A top notch American Wild, Russian River deserves their reputation and I will definitely pick this one up again."
"Overall, this was very nice. Have a few more bottles from this same batch to age and see the changes."
""
"2-3 year old bottle.  Tartness has dropped off.  It's sweet with a slight bitter bite, muted grassy funk, and some pineapple esters.  Pretty underwhelming."
"Overall, a nice sour from RR, but it's a notch below the likes of Supplication, Temptation, etc."
""
""
""
""
"D: There really isn't enough to say about this beer. Russian River again showed why it dominates this style along with the guys from Lost Abbey. A must try beer. Cheers!"

""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip (batch 006... I think, the label is rather worn, though I am fairly certain). The beer pours a hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger white bubbly head with some retention and some lacing. The nose is that of a faint biscuit malt base with lemony citrus, apple and fig fruit tones together with a hint of funk in the yeast. The flavor begins with an immediate acidic assault on the palette. The fruit found in the nose then rushes in and mellows the acid a bit. As the beer warms the sour character becomes more prevalent as does a green apple flavor. Mildly bitter with a faint hint of a biscuit base. The beer finishes with a linger sour apple character on the tongue. Lighter bodied and dry in nature and very carbonated. Overall, this is a good beer, not my favorite wild from RR but not bad. A little too acidic for my preference but I wouldn't refuse another."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Russian river makes beers that are more sour. They make beers that are more interesting and/or inventive. This, however, is just a supremely drinkable beer."
""
""
"Overall a great sour Blonde Ale with a nice apple peel bite at the end..."
""
""
""
""
"Much too expensive at $12..."
""
"O-This combo of golden ale + Brett gives a finished beer somewhat remniscent of a Belgian wit with lemon. Very unique and fun to try."

"O - A great beer with very interesting flavors. RR sure knows their stuff."
"I like it – not nearly as much as I like RR Supplication, but it’s still really solid. Jeff – thanks again buddy, really appreciate it."
""
""
""
"Dr: Drinkable for the style, but too simple and a bit too thin. I might have it again, but Russian River has far better brews."
""
""
"All in all, another excellent sour from Vinnie & co. Remind me again why they don't distribute to NYC?"

""

"375 ml bottle into tulip, batch 005. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some soapy lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of huge lemon, grass, sour apple, pepper, hay, bread, yeast spices, and nice funkiness. Great aromas here with fantastic balance. Not overly funky or sour with a great mix of all aromas. Taste of big sour apple, tart lemon, grass, hay, pepper, spices, bread, yeast spices, and funkiness. Lingering notes of tart apple, lemon, pepper, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Light acidity present on the finish as well, but is nicely balanced and not overpowering. Medium carbonation and body. Incredibly drinkable and smooth; great balance with the acidity. Incredibly crisp and clean body with a perfect amount of carbonation for the style. Alcohol is not noticed at all for 6.75% as expected. Overall this is a smooth and incredible wild ale. So much great complexity and balance."
""
""
""
"Opens with a loud pop, and pours a straw/yellow colored body with about an inch of white, foamy head. Body has a constant stream of bubbles from the base of the glass. Aroma is of tart pear, apple, and some peach. Wood, some funk, straw, and hay are also noticeable. It tastes of tart fruits (grape, peach, pear, and some apple), straw, hay, and faint oak and wine. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. It finishes clean and has plenty of carbonation. Overall, a great sour that is also very flavorful."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow color, with an amazing two finger white head. Great lacing on my tulip glass. Very hazy in appearance. The nose is brett, apple, pear. Not overwhelming, just really nice and balanced Wild Ale. The taste is definitely a step up from the nose. Apple, pear, Brett... Really fantastic balance and flavor on this beer. It's not too overwhelmingly sour, just about perfect. None of the 6.75% abv is evident at all. Feel is medium full, with sourness, not tartness, and very smooth going down. Very refined and easy to drink. Overall, another World class beer from one of my favorite breweries. Cheers."
"O: This is a great sour, and a great beer all the way around. I’m loving all of the big funk and puckering sour."
"Overall: Russian River gets this whole sour/wild ale thing. Lots of depth without any overbearing flavor profiles. Easy to drink and sip at the same time."

"This is another out of the park hit for Russian River...."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sour and a small, sweet yeast presence. In the taste, a small dryness, and sweet tarts, a nice lemon like citrus in there too. A sour bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry lemon and tartness in the aftertaste. A small dryness, small yeast, small lemon like citrus, and a nice good sour all day long."
""
"Sanctification pours a crystal clear goldenrod, with nice lemon highlights shining through. There's about a finger and a half of of white head that lingers around for a minute or two before fading way. Not much is left in the way of lacing. The nose has a bit of light spiciness to it, but is largely dominated by earthy, wet hay brett funk. There's just a touch of cracker maltiness at the front of the flavor profile. Some definite lemon zestiness places off the spice notes from the nose, and the second half of the beer is 100% wild. It's mostly funky like the nose, but there is a slight tart edge to it. The body is dry, but not as bone dry as I might have expected. The carbonation is brisk and bubbly, lending some more excitement to the beer. Another great brew from the best wild ale producer in the country, and I look forward to having this beer again, maybe with a little more age to see what the brett can really do."

"D- Oh yeah. This is a much more funky than sour wild ale. Think a brett saison or something along those lines. Its pretty much a brett bomb. The difference between this and, say a saison with brett is that there is more acidic tartness as well as a presence of vinegar that makes this like a gueze/saison brett hybrid. Anyway. This beer is really good. I wish we got RR where I live-but we don't."

"Batch 005. As Bob Hope would say, ""That's wild!"" Ahem. This stuff pours a hazy pale gold topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, ginger, sweet lemonade, and light coconut. The taste holds notes of light tart lemon zest, ginger, light nutmeg, Brett funk, and light lettuce. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, lightly sticky finish. Overall, a very nice wild, one that certainly lives up to its reputation."
"Carbonation is quite lively. This is a super-refreshing, champagne-like beer I’d drink all the time if I could afford it. Medium light body with a crisp, clean, slightly puckering finish. Made for a great Thanksgiving morning treat while others enjoyed Prosecco with strawberries."

"O - Good beer, refreshing, tart and dry, big fruits, some hay, not a lot of funk for a 100% Brett beer, but still good."
"The only problem I have with this beer is that it reminds me a lot of (Russian River) Temptation; just more mellow, and less woody. I'm sure someone will want to smack me for typing that, but it is my overall impression. If I had to choose between this and Temptation, I would just take both and run."

"Excellent sour blonde! The nose had that somewhat flowery wine yeast & citrusy aroma. Explosive carbonation in the pour that hung around for awhile. There was no sweetness at all in the taste. The sour was smooth, not bitter. Didn't stay on the palate long after swallowing. Very refreshing summer beer IMO. Don't pour the bottom liquid of the bottle in your glass! That spent yeast taste is quite bitter and will sit on your palate for awhile! The bottle tells you not to do that, so that was my bad. Great offering from RR!"

" - 10 oz. pour into tulip glass on 21-Feb-11"
""
"O:  A great beer overall without being overwhelmingly tart or sour and is super drinkable."
"Overall: Glad I got the chance to try this one since I would never buy it for myself. Highly recommended if sours is your thing"
"The body is nice a light but the carbonation is a little bit high. I kind of just expands in your mouth. Overall this one is nice and funky. Pretty enjoyable."
"I'm a fan of this. This has some nice brett characteristics with a touch of tartness."
"Picked up a bottle in Colorado Springs. Poured a slightly hazy golden with a tall white head. Heck of a beer. It tasted like a clean geueze. It was still wonderfully sour, with a fantastic Brett character, but it wasn't rough around the edges (for better and worse). There seems to bet a light toast in the background, from either the barrel or barley, that makes a tasty complement to the ripping citrus sour. Mmm. What a sour."
"Overall: This is a very good beer. I would have liked the herbal notes to be a little bit more pronounced in the taste, but that's just nitpicking."
"overall this is a very well crafted, impressive beer. it didnt blow me away and i wouldnt regularly seek it out (if it was available where i live), but im glad i got to try it, enjoyed drinking it, and hope to enjoy it again in the future."
"O: I was disappointed by this one. Just not enough flavor to hold it together. This was one odd sour."
"Although I really enjoyed this beer, it was not as interesting as I anticipated it would be. Perhaps the decision to use Brettanomyces as the only means of fermentation accounted for the lack of complexity."
"Notes: Amazing. Simply perfect."
"Overall, this brew is amazing in all aspects and showcases how the Westcoast can undertake such an awesome style and take over."
"Another well done Russian River item."
"Taste is crisp, light character, sour but not overly so, tart with hint of sweetness. It has sour lemon and tart fruits up front, with some peppery spice and herb, then biscuit and bread in the finish. It has a good, well-rounded but very light, somewhat thin character, a bit bland and “dry.” It’s very good and very drinkable, but lacks character."
"Just about a perfect American wild. This beer's greatness lies in it's perfected simplicity. The flavors are clean, bright, and powerful. This is a world-class sour."
"Overall - Tasty, but not really complex or outstanding in any way. My first of the RR wilds. We'll see how the others go."
"Overall this is a very good sour that I would recommend to anyone new to the style. Its not overwhelming in the slightest which combined with the light body makes it pretty easy to drink."
"Overall, a really nice, funk wild ale. My biggest gripe was teh lack of carbonation in my bottle. Some more would have really heightened this beer. I really did enjoy some of the flavors though. That said, this was probably my least favorite Russian River sour, but I would definitely revisit sometime."
"One finger white head relative quick dissipation on top of clear golden body, multiple streams of carbonation, need to be careful to keep yeast in bottle or body gets murky. Lemony esters, a bit of light barnyard funk, hay, in the nose, grassy and floral hops. Taste replicates nose, light sourness balanced by tartness. Mouthfeel is just on the light side of medium, good effervescence. IMHO this is a great entry sour/American Wild, quite tasty (the base blonde helps) not overbearing and very drinkable. Well made."
"Overall a really nice wild ale. Maybe a good place to start if you're just getting into the style. At the same time, interesting and enjoyable enough for the more experienced."
"What I love about sours is that if you drink them only occasionally, you can use them to reset your palate. Suddenly my taste buds have been jarred from the typical diet of IPAs and stouts - and invariably after having one of these I enjoy all beers a little bit more."
"Pour out medium yellow/orange with a slight haze. Head is white and like a dense foam. Retention is substantial and lacing is abundant. In the nose you get peaches, sweet clove spice, floral undertones, and a lemon zest also picking up some vinegar in the background. Taste reminds me of straight up lemon juice with grass and tart peach. There something there that I can't describe that I think most people refer to as funk. Very unique. The mouth feel is so damn soft and smooth. Carbonation is great with lots of fine bubbles. This beer is just plain awesome. My first America wild ale and my first Russian River beer. So glad I got to try this one. I wasn't disappointed. Once again thanks to gkunkle."
"Overall, I wish this could be as complex when drinking it as it was when smelling it. Still, a great sour and if it wasn't so hard to find and $11.99 for a 375ml, I'd probably buy it again."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. It didn't knock my socks off by any means, but I am also not the specialist on sour ales either."
"O - Nice beer."
"Pours a nice clear yellow. Very pretty colour. Nice white frothy head. Smells sweet. Surprisingly sweet. Some light citrus on the nose. On the tongue its tart but pretty mild. Sour but enjoyable. Veery light and drinkable. I quite enjoy this"
"Drink- This has to be the best RR sour I have had. It was balanced and light and not over done and didnt need the essence of the barrels to impart other flavors to an already good beer."
"Apricot, tart apple, clean and dry finish. Effervescent, ethereal, well developed and complex. Woody, clean, traces of white wine. Soft aftertaste of clover honey and mild oak. Lightly puckering. A refined Brett focused wild ale... delicious stuff."
"Batch 2...yellow gold, small lingering head. Slight sour fruit and funk aroma. Rich flavors of citrus, horse saddle, kiwi, sour orange, lime. Refreshing and tasty. Shared with 10 others and I wish I'd had a larger pour, meaning a tasty brew overall!"
"overall, one of the most memorable beers of the day which included lots of sought after beers. an ideal wild, one of the most tastiest expieriences ive ever had with brett. this is something i will seek out again."
"D - A super solid sour... Excellent restraint as this one is far from overpowering... Nicely executed and rather enjoyable..."
"O: I would say this us a great intro into the realm of wilds. Great flavors paired with sour undertones. Glad I got to try it."
"O: Overall quite lovely, not so burn you tongue sour that you can't taste the base beer. There is something so simple, so brilliant about this. It is a quite complex beer, but seems to be so without really trying."
"Taste is similar to the smell, a mid-level sourness on the front end with some considerable funk in the body of the beer and a nice, clean, dry finish. It's definitely well made, but in relation to their other offerings, the price, and reputation of the brewery this seems tame. I'll admit though, if it were cheap and available I'd drink the hell out of it, but that goes for a lot of others too."
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. The color is a rich yellow with golden orange hue. The smell is very inviting, hint of citrus and a touch of sweet. Faint 1/4 inch head, with very little lacing. The taste is of citrus sour, with a tiny bit of malt sweetness. The sourness makes you go back for more. The tartness resonates on the pallet once it is gone from the mouth. Very easy to drink. I like this beer a lot, will continue to seek this one out."
"O- Awesome beer, but not as sour as I had hoped for. I was looking for a Supplication type beer here, but it was more of a funky sour. Still great and would, love to have again!"
"A crisp, balanced and fruity sour ale which is nicely built and has a good mouthfeel."
"SkÅL!"
"O: I'm taken by this beer. I am not in love by any means, but I'm certainly happy with the acquisition. I have an additional bottle, and will let it age until I trade it, unless I get a hankering for it prior to that time. This is solid, and would be great for a blazing hot day, ice cold. Great substitute for a shandy IMO."
"D - Drinkability is high. This probably takes the cake for my favorite Russian River sour I've had so far. The flavors are complex and the Brett just adds that much more depth to it. Combine that with a great mouthfeel and you have a recipe for success. I'd love to get a few 750's of this to lay down for special occasions."
"Randall"
"A decent sour ale, but I don't find anything remarkable about it. It's exactly what it says it is, a sour blonde ale, and it's good, but it's rather one-dimensional. Maybe my expectations of RR are too high, but I was hoping for more out of this beer."
"straw yellow, head is thin and bubbly and gone quickly. not the prettiest, but not bad looking. nose is sweet tart, apple, pear, not much of the funk but nice smelling. only a touch of funky mustiness. very tart taste. sweet. candy-like. again, the brett is not too present, but tehre is a hint of mustiness. tart is not mouth puckering, good feel. overall, it is good, but not great. certainly as advertised, a blonde sour...but i was a bit bummed that the brett was so in the background."
"O: A great sour. Not overpowering with any of it's qualities. Very drinkable."
"Overall: Clean, crisp, acidic, and enjoyable. An excellent brett option for someone not yet wanting to dive head-first into a geueze. (Also delicious for someone who already enjoys these!)"
"O-Not as sour as the rest of them but it has some bitterness. I think I poured in a little too much yeast into my snifter. However this is a solid beer that I'd love to try again."
"A pretty nice sour."
"I poured from a 375 ml into SA perfect pint glass. The pour is hazy straw with a medium white head, light lacing. The aroma has tart lemon, and some barnyard qualities. The flavor has lots of tart citrus, passion fruit, light vinegar and some funk. The flavors are sharp and it has an acidic feel. The beer finishes crisp. The beer is light and IMO very refreshing. A very good ""sour", tart without being over the top. The light body makes it very refreshing."
"A bit overdone just in parts, but I do like a good sour beer, and this is definitely a good sour beer. Maybe some more age on this would mellow out the sharp edges."
"I love this beer. It's a great aperitif, it's a great sunny afternoon sipper (year-round in Los Angeles). If it doesn't quite reach the complex heights of Temptation or Beatification at their best, it trumps them in cost and accessibility."
"Consistency is not an easy thing to ensure when you're gambling in mother nature's casino, but (knock on wood) I can't recall a single sample of Russian River beer that was tainted or spoiled in any way. If you're trying wild ales for the first time, start with one of the many ""-tion"" beers, any will do but Sanctification is a safe bet. It is not only among the most highest rated but is also probably the one likely to be most agreeable to an unfamiliar audience."
"Top-notch brew. It's remarkable how clean, drinkable and refreshing this is—usually the RR sours are about depth, complexity and mind-blowingness—this is perhaps the perfect summer drinking beer. Crisp, refreshing and biting. Lovely beer."
"O- A simple but well done take on the style. Drinks fantastically on a rainy summer night."
"O: Very refreshing due to the body and tart crispness. More potent than one would expect. I wouldn't drink several bottles, but I would buy this selection several times. Very solid beer, and an excellent first impression."
"Pours a clear pale gold, a finger of pure white foam, so-so retention and minimal lacing. Smells like sour lemon (in a non-harsh way), brett, nice floral and freshly cut grass notes. Long finish. Taste is brett, crisp lemon and floral, slight sweetness. A nice, moderate level of acidity gives this a very good level of bite. Medium carbonation and body, no alcohol at all here. Overall, although I tend to enjoy the barrel aged sours from RR best because of the complexity, this is very tasty and refreshing. Great for warm weather days. This had enough sweetness and body to pair quite well with Indian food."
"This was the latest RR sour to finally hit Philadelphia, this was sampled months back so this review is off of old notes. This beer poured a straw, pale color with a thin white head. The aroma was similar to a tart chardonnay with notes of white grapes, sour apples, with some brett. The taste consisted of notes of what was mentioned in the aroma above, with the funk more in the forefront. There was a nice level of carbonation which coated the toungue on every sip. This beer was very drinkable compared to some of the other RR sours that were so tart that it would be difficult to have more than one in one sitting. Another solid beer by Russian River."
"Overall: Eh. Refreshing, but nothing to get too excited about. Honestly, I'd have to say that I think this one is a little overrated, just like Supplication. When I see sour written on the label, I expect to taste sour but this simply wasn't the case here. Consecration still tops my list among the RR sours."
"Pours a clear yellow body with a small carbonated white head. Smell of pepper and aroma of lemon, grapefruit, leather and graininess. Taste is Tart and slightly has a flavor of lemon, hay and grapefruit with a tart peppery finish. Damn refreshing and tasty! Even when warming."
"O- Very excellent beer. When compared to the rest of the RR catalog I would consider this by far the most sessionable of all the sours. I could sip on this beer everyday after work."
"Overall: this is just a really good beer. I don't know if it lives up to the high, high bar set by its Russian River brethren, but I find it delicious and refreshing and definitely worth having at least once."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer, but it is not my favorite of the RR sours. It is crisp, refreshing, and jaw-breakingly sour, which I like, but there is a lack of depth to this, as compared to the other sours in the flight."
"O: I always like their stuff. Feeling a little biased, but they do make wonderful beers."
"O: A really good beer; compared to the other reviews here it looks like I dig it just a bit less, but for sure worth checking out (if you can get past the price tag)."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4"
"This one had a nice pop when I pulled the cork. It poured a nice moderately cloudy gold in color with a one and a half finger bright white head that just sits atop the beer for minutes on end. It resembles a quality berliner weiss. It smells of light citrus, light yeast, some hay, light grapefruit, is lighty acidic and has what I'd describe as tartness, not so much sour. The flavors consist of sour grapefruit, sour apples, brett, lemons, and it has a nice tart and dry finish. It drinks light and only moderately dry. I find it the most drinkable of the Russian River sours that I've tried thus far. It just has really nice balance. Overall I really like this one and prefer it to their other rotating sours."
"Overall this was very enjoyable, it reminds me of Cantillon Gueuze, but not as balanced."
"o - great. love it. want it. age it. spread it. great go to sour as long as i got 10 bucks to throw down on a glass."
"mouthfeel - smooth for a sour, love it, great carbonation like most of their beers"
"Perhaps not as much going on flavor-wise as Consecration or Supplication but it's still a great beer and a mouth-puckering sour. Recommended for sure."
"D-Very palatable and refreshing beer that is wonderful after a full day of walking all over sunny San Francisco."
"Looks like chicha. Cloudy yellow hazy milky lookin masterpeice. Frothy creamy off white head. Smells like Sour apple. Mmmm. Amazing smell. Tastes super Sour and slightly puckering. This is funky from the Brett. Woohoo. This is so balanced and tasty. Tingly dry feel."
"This is a fantastic sour...lighter but with a distinct, fruit-like sourness that is completely pleasing. I want more of this."
"Overall, it's not the Brettiest, tartest, our sourest beer on the block, but it's comfortable in it's own skin and ain't that what's it's all about?"
"Very drinkable. I still need more time with sours and wilds to get a feel for them, but this one was a nice introduction. I'm still not sure what barnyard funk and hay taste like, but someday I will get there. I will be enjoying many of these if the weather gets nice and hot."
"O- this was an enjoyable beer that went down very quickly. the alcohol is extremely well hidden. something id love to pick up again to drink as well as lay some down to age. russian river is the king of the american wild ale."
"D- Overall this is an amazing sour by Russian River wish I could get them more often but I enjoy them while I have them."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow with a nice finger of frothy head that retained well. Yeasty aroma, with lots of light fruits and some underlying spice. Yeasty and grassy to the taste, a sweet malty base, with sour notes of lemon zest, pear, apples, and white wine, and a tad of peppery spice in there somewhere. Crisp hop bitterness and general sourness gives a nice dry finish. Light-medium mouthfeel, and very nice to drink."
"I'm a sucker for big, flavorful beers, and this one satisfies that in a new dimension differently than the big IPAs and stouts. Thanks Russian River for delivering us beers to expand our minds and tastes!"
"D - Very nicely done, as expected. This is quite reminiscent of Orval, with a lighter malt body and more citrus character. The aroma has quite a bit of earthy funk, the element that brings Orval to mind, while the wild character comes out more as a lemony tartness in the flavor profile. Well balanced, relatively simple and absolutely brilliant. It certainly wasn't a cheap bottle, but this is one of those rare beers that is genuinely a bargain at any price."
"O- I have heard so many good things about this beer, and I was not let down. Incredibly refreshing and delicious, excellent tasting sour, with an amazing drinkability."
"O: Such a nice, tart beer and so refreshing; a nice take on the blonde ale; not the most sour beer but a nice sour to get your mouth wet; good work as usual Russian River"
"Overall- A great example of a RR sour. There are better, but I think this one is not as mouth puckeringly sour as some of the others. Maybe a better RR sour to start out on for the sour beginner or faint of heart."
"O - I really enjoyed this and will look to acquire more bottles whenever I can. Very refreshing."
"Light to medium bodied with a good amount of tartness and lively carbonation. Finishes nice and dry, just the way it should. A very nice beer, which I will seek out again."
"This is an interesting sour. It starts off as a normal sour, but then turns into a blonde leaving the sourness as a recent memory."
"o-impressed with this RR sour. I'll be buying more to out away. Think the beer is well balanced and the sour and barnyard is under control. Really pleased with this beer, just wish it was a 750ml not a 375ml!"
"Very bright and flavorful - the Brett. seems more forward in the bottle vs. my memory of the on-tap version. While over-all I think I prefer Supplication, this is more refreshing. Russian River works their magic again."
"Overall this was a very unique beer that was a great treat. I would never want to have one every day but it certainly spiced up my normal selection of brews."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow color with a huge 4 inch white head that fades into a chunky small cap. Very distinct rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells funky/musty from the Brett with some sour fruit notes as well. Taste is somewhat fruity all around with green apples and sour citrus fruits in harmony with the funk from the Brett. A good level of carbonation but I was expecting much more after the 4 inch head on the initial pour. Beer is pretty crisp with each sip but leaves a stickiness in the mouth as well. Overall, this is a solid wild ale from RR but not as good as some of their others in my opinion."
"O - get some of this beer as soon as you can, I generally use sours for pallet cleansers, but this beer as well as many other russian river sours might slip into my regular rotations."
"Although, this review is for Batch 5 (bottle), I have also had Batch 4 (bottle) and both of them on draft. There are definitely some variations between batches and drafts. My slight preference is for Batch 4, but Batch 5 is an excellent beer that should age well."
"Arid finish, with notes of muscat grape, Bragg's vinegar, and green apple. Mouthfeel is light but somewhat creamy, and complements the beer well. This is a fine wild ale and well worth your money."
"Finish: Again Semi dry and of medium length. Sanctification leaves behind traces of fruit, yeast funk and earth tones. Layered with flavor and personality."
"This beer rocks, wish I could rate it higher, but there are too many of the finest Wild Ales ever made against which it competes. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is nice. Perfect body and carbonation. Overall a good beer, just not too exciting."
"Overall: I now have had three of the four current RR sours. Will have the last of them tomorrow. This is my lowest ranked out of them thusfar. I am not one to eat food while drinking a beer in general, but I think this would be a great one to pair with a nice seafood dinner. Much much more subdued than the other sours, yet still very enjoyable."
"O- This was pretty solid, and perhaps a nice gateway beer to sours if you can get your hands on some of it. As I alluded to above, now I want to see what happens with the Supplication, Consecration, and Temptation as they sit in some wine barrels. Interesting stuff!"
"Pours a golden pale in to my oversized snifter. Dissipating head, but continues to bubble up from the bottom of the glass the whole time. Smell is definitely full of brett, some sour apples, and grassy funk... very nice. Taste is a little more subtle than most RR sours but very good. Starts off a little bit sweet and fruity, full of apple and lemon tartness. Finishes dry, mildly lactic, and just slightly puckering. Refreshing beer on a sunny evening, great stuff. Mouthfeel is lively, bubbly, and dry. Overall this is another fantastic offering from RR. Not sure if it's as good as its counterparts like supplication, temptation, and consecration... but I'd gladly take one of these anytime."
"I'm new to sours, but this could be the one that makes me a believer. Yet again, a very enjoyable brew by Russian River."
"Popped open a 375, pours a 2 finger head that stays, golden and hazy in appearance. Aromas of brett right away, apples and funk. The taste follows the nose to a tee only strengthened. It's dry but not too dry, just keeps you coming back for more. Russian river knows sours and this is one of the best!"
"Overall: A well made and straight forward sour beer. It cuts through fatty foods nicely, if you're looking for a pairing."
"The beer matched the spring like weather here in PDX."
"Overall, this is damn good. This was the first 100% brett beer I've had, and I'm quite impressed. I'm very much looking forward to the other Russian River sours waiting in the fridge."
"Overall I am very impressed. This was my first Russian River sour, and I only have more sour bottles than this in the cellar! I cannot wait to dig into those soon."
"Special thanks to hurfer for providing me this!"
"VERY GOOD BEER!"
"i could say this was a learning experience. sours are well rated on BA. it seems they fulfill the other side of the heavy handed craft spectrum. its sledge hammer hoppy... or its sour. either way its bombastic. like american merlots. some are rich in flavor and some have holes but that magnitude of the process is undeniable. and i drink this feeling that that is what's most important. its sour... its not a lambic. period."
"Overall: ANother amazing beer from RR. They deserve all the accolaids they recieve as they make amazing beer. Another must try!"
"Good beer i'd drink any single day,but i'm still in love with Suplication & Concecration though, those are RRs gems im my eyes."
"O: This was a really good beer. Thing is, at this price, I'd think you'd be much better off with any other of the RR sours. Unless you want something subtler, I don't see why you'd pick this one up. Even then, there are much better alternatives for less money. Still, this is a very solid beer."
"A great beer that I would drink more of if I could get my hands on it. I do like some of the other Russian River sour beers much better (supplication, compunction, consecration). Sanctification is not as complex as the these in my opinion."
"O: Great sour from RR and definitely very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - Great example of the style. My expectations were definitely exceeded after finishing this one. Wonderful job, RR."
"An excellent offering from the brewing artists at RR. This is more than a beer, this is an amazing beverage."
"O - love this sour. Very balanced and a great food pairing beer. Not too sour, not too grassy, not too oaky, and not too fruity. It's just right."
"D- Overall this is an amazing sour. Think i might have ruined the next few sours i try by trying such a top notch one first. But seriously i want to buy like a whole case so i can enjoy 1 of these a week! a great beer"
"Overall: Another great sour from Russian River (surprise, surprise). I'm glad this made it's way to Philly and I'm definitely going to get as much as I can next time."
"O - 005 is not the best Sanctification I've had, but it is certainly delicious, and is drinking much better than it was a month or two ago."
"Pours a hazed ppale straw color, as expected a rush of bubbles forms a pillowy head, diminishes quickly but leaves sticky rings around the glass. Scent is all about the sour and funk... while being 100% brett, I would expect the funk to dominate, but it is there in perfect amounts while letting other components come through, the tart and sourness is welcome considering the yeast used. Hints of musty grain complete the profile. First sip is whats expected from the scent, great blend of tart and sour flavors with barnyard funk, musty wet straw and a kiss of riper watery fruit. Medium bodied, bubbly carbonation, dry and slightly puckering. A nice simply constructed beer that shows the quality of ingredients and crafstmenship are what makes a great beer."
"Overall, another good sour ale from Russian River. If your a fan of the true sours, those without added fruit, this is a good beer to sample."
"Finish is remarkably dry and crisp. High carbonation gives a mouthfeel very similar to dry champagnes. I'm really enjoying this for now, but I'm glad it is a small format bottle. 750 ml would be too much for me by myself, sour newbie that I am."
"overall, its decent, but not what id be seeking out from this brewery."
"O: Overall this is an excellent example of an American Wild Ale, not to mention an all Brettanomyces version. It is extremely well balanced with an array of nuances. Great beer. Cheers!"
"Overall, I like it, though not amongst my favorites due to the fact that I have nary a preference for lemons. Sorry. If there were just a tab bit of sweetness, the taste preference would steer this in the A category. Plus it’s undoubtedly funky and smooth, though not necessarily complex. I would knock back a couple per serving, but should Supplication or Consecration or Temptation or Beautification be offered in its stead, this would be left to someone else."
"D: This was a great wild ale with lots of dry tartness and and sourness. Not much funk, bitterness, or sweetness. The body was fitting and made it easier to drink. (Any flatter and the sourness would have lasted too long in the finish). This really pushes the tart envelope. Very enjoyable if you're into wild ales. Definitely recommended."
"D - This is a pretty solid wild ale here. Not as in your face sour as others I have tried, but this makes Sanctification that much easier and enjoyable to drink. Pretty solid stuff and has me very intrigued to try more RR barrel beers."
"Mouthfeel is dry and clean, very nice. Overall, good tasty beer."
"O - Very nice. I think I still prefer temptation overall but I really liked this one. Just a bit too strong on the funk at the moment. I could see this developing beautifully over the next year or so."
"This is spectacular."
"Highly recommended."
"O- Overall this is a nice sour, but not at the same level of the other Russian River sours I have had. Reminded me of a solid Gueuze. I would get this again if I had the chance, but would not actively seek it out. I am very happy that I got a chance to try this."
"All in all, a great beer that I will buy everytime I see it on the shelves. These Russian River sours really have grown on me over the years; I need to go back and re-review all of them as their gradings surely will have improved."
"D - Good wild offering. Quite tart so it took me a while to get through, which I didn't mind."
"(375ml bottle courtesy of zestar!!). Pours cloudy bright yellow with white head. Realy beautiful. Aroma is funky, lemony, and maybe a little grassy. Taste is tart. Thin to medium bodied with a dry finish. This is just a solid offering from Russian River."
"Overall: All four of the replacement beers have been deliciously tasty and refreshing. This is what Vinnie wanted me to get from one of his beers."
"Overall this beer is crisp and refreshing. Easily drinkable for me which cannot be said about most sours. I had a hard time putting the glass down even though this is a rare treat."
"Very good, and full of zesty Brett goodness as this is a 100% Brett sour. Spicy and tongue grabbing it is. I would love to see what a bottle of this would turn out like in a 55 deg. F cooler after about 8 years. Super good, and a very unique sour."
"Decent stuff but not Russian River's most memorable. Just a solid, crisp sour that doesn't try to show off. I'll be saving my other bottle for a nice outside summer drinking day."
"O: Very nice overall beer. One of the better wild ales I've ever had and I'd rank it up there with supplication in overall quality."
"O- dear Russian River, thank you for making this beer again. It is absolutely amazing. I want as much of it as I can get. Fantastic stuff"
"Truly exceptional; I'm glad I've got another which I may have to save for a warm evening...hopefully those are coming soon"
"Overall the drinkability was good. Tartness will it for some but its very good. No signs of ABV. Nicely balanced. Very crisp and dry."
"D: Amazing beer. The balance between wild yeast and earthy brett flavors with tropical ripe apples and perfect carbonation is a treat. Perfect with white meat, hot days, cold nights, and just to try something different."
"O/D- A really great beer. This is perfect for a light meal or relaxing on a nice warm day. Well done again RR."
"Many thanks to AugustGarage for the chance to taste this long time want. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a bright yellow cloudy color, nice head that recedes quickly. Smell- tart, sour candy, sweet bananas, green apple. Taste- green apple, sour tart sugar, bretty goodness. Mouthfeel- nice carbonation, wonderful light tart mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is unforgiving in its quest to sour you to death, and is wonderful all the way. Thanks again."
"O: This is a killer AWA. Dry and crisp and not too sour. Very refreshing. Excellent!"
"Tate is very tart and funky. Super sour and crisp, it's hard to believe this is just Brett. Mouthfeel is very light and sharp with good carbonation. Super easy drinking - phenomenal."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Sour on the tongue and back of my mouth while foamy with yeast on the roof. A medium bodied blonde ale that packs a sour punch. Easily drinkable and I really enjoyed this. Reminds me of eating a cut up apple soured with lemon juice."
"Poured from bottle (batch #005) into a snifter glass. Pours nice golden orange color with small chunks of sediment noticeable, and a nice, sustaining thin white head and minimal lacing throughout the session. Aroma is sour but not as much as some of the other RR sours, and is more nuanced. Nose is also picking up a delicate blend of raw, funky brett, burlap, and barnyard hay with sour, acidic fruit notes of lemon peel, apricot, and peach with subtle notes of vanilla, white pepper, nutmeg, and belgian yeast. Flavor is some sour citrusy fruit tones that evolve as the beer warms, plenty of funk, woody, grassy, and somewhat cheesy. Medium bodied with a very dry finish. Sour, but not mouth puckeringly so like Supplication or Consecration. Flavor essentially mimics aroma with alot of sour fruit tones, but with a somewhat floral aspect after, to the dry finish. I am still not a big fan of sours, but this is obviously well-made from RR."
"Taste is great, straightforward sour, similar to temptation in many ways, although a little less complex. Gets the salivary glands working overtime, small amount of white wine residual to it. Very easy to drink. Seems to go good before or after any beer. Light in body, relatively high in sourness. No real discernable fruit feel to it, other than maybe the aforementioned lemon."
"M: Sourness doesn't linger too long. Nice bubbly carb feel on the tongue. Great wild ale."
"O - Im not a huge fan of sours yet, but this one was very enjoyable. I found it sour, but not too sour. I think this is very balanced considering it was solely fermented with brett. The more sip on it and the more it sits in the glass, the better it gets. I'm glad a bought several of them. I will definitely be enjoying these in the months to come."
"Drinkability - It was decently refreshing for me, but I need some more exploration in the sours department. One at a time seems good."
"The sourness seems a little less multidimensional than some of Russian River's other brews, but this one was still plenty enjoyable. What a flavor wallop!"
"D: this is a very drinkable beer. I would have no trouble drinking a few of these."
"Although the extreme tartness may turn some people off, the flavor is incredible, and very well balanced for being fermented solely with Brett. The more I drink it, the more I fall in love with it."
"D - Not all that exciting. Basically, a funky beer that has a light sweetness to it. Some nice when you're looking for a light/funky beer, but I usually either/or, not both."
"Drinkability isn't that good, not digging this one at all. Russian River is pretty hit or miss with their sours, depending on where you drink them in their evolution, and judging by the high scores, I obviously should have given this brand new batch more time. The problem is, it's so bad, I'm not sure I want to buy another one just to see if it improves. Regardless, it's pretty bad right now, I want my $10 back!"
"D- I've had this a few times in the last couple weeks and it just keeps getting better. One of the more quafable american wild ales out there. No surprise when its a rr brew."
"Drinkability- My wife who does not like beer tried this and felt as if it was a general exception to her usual rules. I would drink this every day if it were an option!"
"D - Very crisp and refreshing. Tons of flavor. A really good batch."
"Delightfully drinkable. The tartness never really builds and makes itself unwelcome."
"Drinkability gets high marks - very easy on the palate, and makes this expensive beer disappear FAR too quickly."
"D - Another great offering from Russian River. Was glad to see what they could do using only Brett in a beer. Would love to see how this tastes with a more intensely developed Brett flavor. Nicely done and I look forward to trying this again."
"Expensive stuff, but definitely worth it"
"D: Crisp, refreshing, and relatively moderate ABV. If the price were lower, this would make a nice hot summer's day thirst quencher."
"Batch 4 is far less impressive and would be in the 3.7 range. The pours is pretty and birght golden in color with an active body and a pure white fluffy head. The nose is brett forward, slighlty eggy and perfumey. juicy citrus and lemon peel with some soft golden pears. The taste has a ton more juicy vinous flavors and brett. still some eggy flavors, notes of spicy yeast. white graps and notes of citrus and ripe mango. Soft creamy feel with a dry finish and light carbonation. overall the brett in this is overpowering and the flavors are flabby. not a bad wild but no where near what Batch 3 is."
"Not usually my style of beer, and the tangy funk is what people call ""interesting"" with a slight pause in their voice. Despite all this, the beer is quite drinkable and a real treat. I could easily drink a few more of these."
"cloudy and straw colored with a pure white, foamy head. little lacing. typical RR ""wild"" smell but tropical fruits are more prominent in this one. very puckering upfront in the taste as expected, but goes down smoother that the others. great mouthfeel, very lively like a nice champagne. Very drinkable, particularly for the style. This almost seems like a ""beginner"" version, but still has the punch that a more experience drinker would appreciate."
"D - This is a easy drinker. Grab a few if you can, you are going to need them."
"D: Another excellent beer by Russian River. I was jonesing for some sour/wild ale and this one really hit the spot."
"D; This beer was good not very attractive. I found myself wanting to sip this down so I can move on"
"I could drink this all day."
"D - Nice one. Could have a few."
"Overall: Great Wild Ale and definitely on the wild side of this category as opposed to the sour. This is wonderful for a wild and I'm really enjoying it. It's not as good as supplication or consecration but better than temptation IMO. It's the best pure Brett beer I've ever tried and I'm curious what age would do to this? Wonderful."
"Pours a clear amber/ golden color with no head or lacing apparent at all. Aroma is slightly tart but still a little to sweet it seems. Fruity with mild acidic character. Fruity and acidic but nothing to write home about. Finshes very clean. Within 30 seconds you don't remember what it tastes like. Hints of white wine but not tart it sour enough for me. Mouthfeel is nearly flat with minimal carbonation. I could drink a bunch of these but I wouldn't necessarily want to."
"this is a delicious drinker. even for a sour or something so dry, this is a beer i'd have several glasses of. the 5-6% abv keeps you honest, too"
"D: The beer is definitely refreshing and intriguing, so I prefer to take a bit of time to savor it. If you do have the financial means to stock your cooler with this, by all means...have a blast. Could see this being mighty good with a bit of chill on it during a warm spring day. Nice beer."
"Batch 005, I shared this 375ml with a friend. Sanctification is a beer that I have been waiting for a long time to try this beer and unfortunately it was a let down. When I opened and poured this beer, it was definitely very funky, with the signature brett aroma. The lightly colored beer was as pale and effervescent as champagne but decidedly cloudier. And the nose revealed little more than brett. The palette was similar, it was a little tart, lemony, some mildewy straw, but that was about it. Though it was good, it didn't have as much complexity as I was anticipating. Perhaps this beer just needs some more time. It was easy drinking, but not a wow beer."
"This is a bit of an ""old school"" sour wild ale. No bells and whistles (or unusual barrels/fruits), just a good solid beer with pretty much no flaws."
"Sanctification came in the glass looking like juice of sorts. A light gold with some yellow/orange resembling lemon juice. A nice whisp of foamy white head on top, some patches of stick on the upper reaches of the glass. Smell is pretty tame considering it's RR were dealing with. Pretty much a base blond beer with some brett scent and light fruits. Simple yet so nice. A very light sour, tastes of some Begian yeast (I believe Westmalle), earth, light biscuit, banana, semi tropics, sour brett which is more funky than all out sour at this point. Some nice lemon taste on the backend. I remember this being a bit more complex out of a batch 2 bottle so maybe Vinnie tweaked this some. Feel is light bodied and very refreshing. This is very drinkable beer but expensive for what it is so not one to have two or three of. This is something I would bring to a picnic with a girl on a nice sunny day."
"D: Nice brew if you like the huge blonde sours...excellent as always from RR."
"D: Tart grapefruit taste with a lively carbonation. No alcohol presence as far as I'm concerned."
"Overall another kick ass wild from RR. The brett mixes perfectly with the sour funk, so if you are not a brett fan this one might not be for you. I am looking forward to cellaring a few of these to see how they change. More brett flavor maybe? I bet yes. Great, great beer."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable beer, unfortunately the price tag would hurt it in this category. This was a really well put together beer though, and I'm glad I traded for more than one bottle."
"This reminds me of an unblended lambic but carbonated... Strange and somewhat of an acquired taste. Pretty good one though."
"Anyway, Thanks Parkway!"
"D - This beer is delicious and a good example of an AWA. Especially good for novices of the style. Awesome brew."
"HV"
"Drink is pretty damn good. I love wild ales, and RR has another hit in this one."
"A very pleasant and tasty beer."
"The CPJ"
"What can I say another score for Russian River."
"I held the high expectation of being blown away, but I'll settle for a good sour anyday. Maybe this is a beer than loses some of its character in a keg or requires a larger sampling to better understand this beer."
"highly effervescent - crisp, light bodied, reminiscent of champagne - a bit more viscous - sometimes almost creamy, yet still very crisp."
"D: Overall not my favorite wild but it will do. RR has much better offerings than this."
"Pours a hazy straw with a silky white head. Has a nice funky Brett presence along with tart citrus and sweet malts. Well balanced flavor profile. Medium to light body, crisp carbonation. Great session beer. But $11 per 375ml is way too steep for a non-barrel aged beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. I say this is a very easy drinking beer. The lingering aftertaste makes me want more of this beauty."
"d - I really liked this one and felt like I could drink a lot of it. Lots of funk and brett in the nose and taste; I loved it. Would love to get another bottle of this."
"Overall another amazing sour from Russian River. Get this one for sure because it's awesome."
"Definitely need to get some more of this. Amazing beer."
"This could be a ""go to"" beer if available year round. Really nice effort."
"Lighter medium body, tingly carbonation, dry and refreshing on the tongue. Super drinkable, nice level of sourness but not really lactic or overly acidic. I finished my glass and was ready for another right afterward. Another incredible wild ale from RR."
"Drinkability/Overall - A complex, pleasantly sour example of a fairly rare style. A moderate strength(6.75%) soured Blond that finishes bone dry and begs for another sip."
"Drinkability: Good. I preferr this over the wine inflected belgians that russian river is offering. I wouldn't turn one down. Would make a great gift beer."
"Not crazy about this batch, but a second tier Russian River is still a few miles ahead of most other American choices."
"D - non-stop."
"D: In your face with brett, but the fruity citrus corrals this funk and plays off it nicely."
"T: Brett ahoy! Super sour, as in punch in the mouth sour. There's a peppery bite that goes well with the sourness and as the beer warms, more flavors come out. Tart green apple and lemon add a nice element to this one. Another great sour from Russian River."
"D - I think this is very drinkable for those who like sours. This is quite a complex beer for how simple it is. I'm glad I bought many of these. Although I'm not a huge sour fan yet, I think this is a good starter because it isn't as sour as some of their other offerings."
"I shared this and already want to pop the one I'm about to cellar. Grrr, I'll have to find more. Top shelf brew. (P.S. I found plenty more and am happily going through my third bottle in a month. Very good and cheaper than their barrel aged (but just as good or better) American Wilds.)"
"Caveat-just got this beer in the mail and couldn't wait so it was a bit cloudy. Otherwise its a great straw color under a small white loose head that leaves only faint lacing. The aroma is soft and subtle bringing some citrus pith, lemon, horse blanket, wet hay and fresh cut grass. Even though I know this is 100% Brett I taste some coriander and citrus peel, but initially it is all sour lemon and light funky goodness. As I drink on I find tropical fruit notes, like pinapple hanging around. Back end is earthy and filled with grass clippings. Dry, dry, dry. Too much to polish off a 750, luckly this is a 375! I have brewed a 100% Brett beer, it ain't easy and Russian River makes it taste like a walk in the park."
"Note: When I opened this bottle, the cavs promptly cut a 25 point deficit to 12...but eventually lost by 15. There is only so much you can do Russian River."
"Almost sessionable. I like it a lot. Not quite as much character as some of the other 'tions but very good and highly recommended."
"Light body with a soft carbonation that helps lighten the beer even more. Very refreshing and drinkable. Would be enjoyable to drink any time of year, either to quench thirst or to remind you of better times when in the cold of winter."
"Drinkability - Different from some of the other RR staples (i.e. Temp, Cons, and Sup) but pretty drinkable nonetheless. Glad I picked up twelve of these suckers."
"Massive thanks to thunderroad12 for this necessary tick on my RR -tion Quest and also a big thanks to Huhzubendah for letting me try one of his bottles at Sexual Chocolate '11! Batch 004! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a two finger bone white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour apple, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour apple, tart, subtle fruit, and a dry funkiness on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent. Everything in this one seemed to be spot-on for what they were aiming for here in all aspects. Had an awesomely balanced flavor and great aroma going on here. I have yet to try a bad Russian River brew as of now and this one is no exception... This is an absolute must try for any sour-head out there and is definitely worth the time/effort of tracking down!"
"Damn, these smaller bottles are cool in some respects, but not when you run out of beer!"
"D-Excellent stuff, but WAY overhyped. Calm down, nerds."
"D - A nice drinking wild with subtle complexities, easy drinking and flavorful, this goes down well and pairs nicely with a host of cheese!"
"Appearance is run of the mill for a RR sour - one finger head with decent retention, no lacing, and hazy yellow. This smells more like a saison and less like a sour - some banana, funk, and nutmeg. The taste is all about balance - not nearly as sour as I was expecting, which for the style, is not exactly what I'm looking for. Theres some lemon, but also some banana and clove. As was said by another BA during the tasting, this one sort of tastes like a saison as well. I don't feel that there is much depth to this - the drinkability is somewhat limited by the one dimensionality of this brew."
"D: Overall, I though this beer was excellent. I would definitely like to have it again someday."
"Pours a very cloudy pale wheat/apricot color with no head. Mild sour aroma. The taste is very tart. Sour, with some wheat and yeast. Fruity aromas come out after a while, particularly under-ripe apricot or peach. No citrus at all in the flavor, and not as yeasty as I imagined. Medium bodied, and generally smooth. A bit like a wit meets a sour, but it works well: flavorful yet compelling"
"Had this on tap at the brewpub in Santa Rosa. Pours a straw yellow colour with thin white head. Nice head retention and lacing around the glass. Smells of sour grapefruit, grapes and lemon with something funky (I think this is brett, though I am not sure if I actually can identify this flavour or not). Quite a sour flavour, very dry, though it isn't as sour as some beers. Very unique flavour too. I really enjoyed this beer, I'd love to have it again."
"(D)- Another world class sour from Russian River. Heavy on the Brett, but it is pulled off rather well. Definitely one of their more unique offerings. Definitely worth seeking out."
"D: Compared to batch 004, Brett funk is not nearly as in-your-face in this one. Very balanced. Sweeter and fruitier than many of Russian River's other Wild Ales. Slight tartness but not sour due to the 100% Brett fermentation. This is definitely solid and worth a try but its a different animal than the batch 004 that's now out there."
"Very drinkable, one of the most drinkable wilds out there."
"overall, good. i had this on tap at RR and it was FAR better IMO. this seems to be lacking some of the complexity."
"I've had this once before and, though I didn't take notes, I think this has improved ever so slightly, souring up a bit. I anticipate my final bottle of this batch."
"Bottle. Batch 004. Poured into a tulip glass a cloudy orange straw color with a slight white head that collars around the glass. The nose is pretty Brett with a very floral type aroma but not overly so in a bad way. The taste is fairly smooth with a strong Brett floral flavor. Some white wine like notes. Light mouthfeel. The lemon and sweetness is really nice in this beer. The Brett flavors really do a nice job in this beer."
"Overall, a really nice sour beer for RR. It was different from their others, but still good. Pretty drinkable. I was a fan of this one."
"Nice classic funk in the taste with a lesser wheaty saison base. Lemongrass notes are prominent, but theres a metallic edge that isn't great to it. Sweet as well. The mouth is good overall, bright on the palate."
"D: All day drinker, especially in the hot summer months."
"Overall after my first sniff of the beer I knew this was the most brett-forward beer I've had from RR. After giving it a few sips I found it to be close to a drier and more brett-forward version of Temptation. A very good beer that's well worth a shot."
"Drinkability: Very sour, very complex, and very enjoyable. Get some!"
"Thanks again Jeff. Always appreciate your generosity."
"This is an easy drinker. Another solid addition to the Russian River lineup. This one seems more sour fresh than Temptation, yet I still prefer Temptation to this beer. Would probably pick this over Supplication or Consecration though. I'd really like to get another bottle for the cellar. I think this could be even better in another 2-3 years."
"Overall the beer is fantastic. I don't know what it is about this beer, but it just suits me. When I had read Vinnie changed the recipe a lot with Batch 004, I was extremely worried in what I would think about the changes. It is different than it was, it's less sour, no longer mouth puckering. I would argue that it's basically the same beer underneath the covers, but the complexity has gone off the charts. The downplayed sourness has allowed this beer to speak the rest of its mind. Vinnie was leaning more towards Orval with this batch, and he nailed it with the funk, but added the tartness and more tropical flavors underneath. An absolute masterpiece. I can't imagine ever coming across a beer that rivals this one."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow gold body under a carefully managed one finger fizzy white head. Moderate visible carbonation. The nose is just full-on bretty goodness. Soft maltiness, and some fruity notes. Quite beautiful in its simplicity. Unique slightly biting acidity over a very soft doughy light malt. Finishes with some lemon zest, pineapple, and lots of cellar funk. A little bit of lingering pixie stick. Mouthfeel is light and airy with engaging pinpiont bursts of carbonation. A really great beer, and a nice showcase for all that is great about Brettanomyces..."
"D: I've avoided reviewing Batch 4 because I'm just not a big fan of it. When it warms, the metallic taste fades and it becomes better, but it's never quite right to me. I don't care to drink this too much."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is super drinkable and has a minor puckering quality to the tongue that made me salivate in ancitipation of the next sip."
"Had on tap at Russian River. Nice medium golden color with about a finger of head. Smells lightly of citrus, heavy Brett, some tree fruit like apple and pear. Nice fruity flavors, dry. Great sour bite without ripping my face off. Nice mouthfilling small bubbles. Dangerously drinkable. One of my favorite sours ever."
"D: it was drinking amazing and after every sip it I was fiending for more. Russian river really knows how to brew these wild ales and this one is definitely no exception. I'm really glad I was able to get my hands on one."
"Cheers!"
"D: I wonder if I'll ever get to try this brew again? I'll sure I will at some point and I sure hope so. Look out winemakers....there's a new enemy in town - ""Sanctification."""
"This is an easy to drink beer, not wildly complex (yet, hopefully!), very delicious. Here's hoping it can develop in the bottle from a good beer to a great beer."
"D - I think this is getting the RR sour benefit here, it's good, but not nearly as good as some of their other offerings. I like Temptation much better."
"Much more funky and dry than batch 4 or batch 5. The dryness was especially noticeable. This is definitely the best batch I've had, and it's almost a completely different beer from the other two."
"3.5 D: Somewhat boring for a RR wild, but still solid."
"D - well, only a slight disappointment. good beer but imho not quite as good as the other RR sours. mouthfeel really starts to wear and tear about halfway through a glass."
"Thanks Auroracrisis!"
"Not quite as complex in flavor as some of my favorite Russian River beers but a great vehicle to showcase what brett can do for a beer."
"This has to be some of the best stuff going in the American Wild category. Glad to have had the change to try it."
"Batch 004. Pours an almost clear, very bubbly golden color with a nice frothy white head (clear become cloudy when I get lower in the bottle). Scent immediately once corked was lemons. When putting my nose to the glass I get light funk and some belgian yeasts. Then I get a bit of spice along with some grassy lemon scents. As the beer warms a bit, I get more funky/sour notes. The taste is VERY lemony with a definite Belgian yeast backbone. The brett is very noticeable in the taste. I get some very sour/tart flavors that are mouth-puckeringly tasty. The aftertaste leaves a bit of a pear with a hint of oak and leather taste. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Not too full, and not to light either. The drinkability is fairly high, especially on these warm summer nights."
"D: Extremely drinkable, chuggable even. I'm glad I have more of this in the cellar."
"D- I loved it. I would drink it everyday and not get tired of it. The only brews at the tasting that I liked better were beatification and DDG."
"Consumed; 8/12/2010"
"D: was impressed with how balanced it is. It's not puckeringly sour"
"D: This is wild ale without restraint; drinkable but challenging. After tasting the previous batch of this beer in 2009, it is apparent that the 2010 product is notably changed--it is far more sour than its predecessor. As I have had the opportunity to experience other American wild ales, those produced by Russian River are being pushed more to the fringe of what makes the style appealing--exactly the opposite of what has happened to their pale ales, in my estimation."
"Beer is medium to light in body and quite funky. Again leads with a minimal sweetness followed immediately by a lactic acid almost creaminess and a moderate leather flavor in the mid to late palate. Beer is not especially dry only moderately. I wish I could have tasted the other batches that were not 100% brett beers but as far as an ""American Wild"" goes, this one was quite good."
"I really enjoy this. Not over the top sourness or alcohol, and just all around enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"great mouthfeel very easy and tasty for me to drink. the bottle was actually gone before I was ready for it to be."
"J"
"D: I had to keep forcing myself to put the glass down, the combination of refreshing feel and great enjoyment is a dangerous one. Glad I've got another bottle, I'm very interested to see where this is in six months to a year."
"A totally overrated wild and with so many other Russian wilds to drink, this is not one worth pursuing."
"I just returned from my first trip to Northern California, and I drank so many good beers. Sanctification was easily the most memorable and almost surely the most enjoyable. If you like sours, this is a must-try."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty good here, not the sourest of sours, but pleasant. Overall, very good example. I just wish we had given it more time to fully develop. Skal."
"The body and carbonation levels are normal (good) for the style. Drinkability is high here...this is just so damn refreshing. Price/availability be damned, I wish I could drink this all the time!"
"Yum! Wow...loads of funk, citrus...and as it warms, even more fruits. The tartness isn't super strong, but definitely there. Mouthfeel is both crisp and carbonated...yet smooth at the same time. This is one great beer that meets it's expectations, in my oppinion atleast. So glad I got the chance to drink this!"
"D - This is one exceptionally drinkable wild ale. Sourness/tartness is mild. Very fruity and complex. Very thirst quenching. Excellent overall. Highly recommended."
"O - amazing job Vinnie. Wow, I thought this was all hype, no substance, but I was wrong, this beer deserves all the hype it got."
"-was an okay beer, but i don't think i would ever order again (considering all the other amazing things i can order at RR)"
"O - I really enjoyed this. The lemony-ness is my favorite of the perceived flavors that I can find in this style, and this is yet another of the stellar sours coming out of Russian River."
"Pours a golden color with a nice white head. Smell is sour lemons with a lil funk, apples, grapes, and some oak. Taste is nice, and sour with lemons, pears, brett, and oak. Dry mouthfeel, good carbonation. Overall one of the better sours I have had."
"Batch 003. The beer pours a clear golden yellow color with a white head. The aroma is tart lemons with some malt notes. The flavor is tart lemons with some yeast and brett character. The beer is not too acidic and is very dry and drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: A delicious Wild Ale. Not as sour as I expected. Excellent balance! Another great RRB beer!"
"On tap at Russian River on 6/30/09. Pours an almost opaque yellow, with beautiful frothy head. The sour lemon and grapefruit almost sting the nostrils, in a good way. This is straight up sour in it's cleanest form. The Brett certainly dominates and makes this a truly unique beer. However, beyond the great aromas and interesting sourness, there isn't a ton of complexity of flavors. Still a great beer that I am lucky to have tried."
"Overall- a great beer. I don't think it is only Brett... there is more sourness going on. it was great with the salad. i would love to age some bottles."
"Well, I give out A+ ratings like candy on Halloween it seems, and this is going to be another one. Is it really my fault that I drink so many awesome beers? I will drink this any time I can though, no doubt."
"Slightly creamy lactic medium body with a lot of dry bretty funk. Tart and puckering without being acidic at all. Very dry with a champagne like efervescence in the finish. Very well balanced with a sweet crisp light fruit balancing out the dry tart funk. Lots of apple and pear. Slight vinous sweet aftertaste that lingers long into the finish, making me want to take another sip immediately. Highly recommended!"
"The brett funk is going to continue to develop long after Vinnie says on the label... I may try and trade my last bottle, but seriously.. I doubt it .. I will be happy to do a tasting with my homies in another coupla years..."
"D-Tart and tasty with a very pleasant green apple presence. I am diggin' this one."
"One of my favorites. Has some nice citrus notes, quality funk (feet) and is very drinkable (as far as the acidity not ruining the experience). I cellared this one for a while and the subtle citrus character is quite a bit more pronounced as well as much more mouth feel than previously."
"I thought this beer had a nice interplay between the fruitiness and earthy Brettanomyces characters."
"Pours a bright pale yellow with a nice pure-white head and good lacing. The smell brings out some funkiness and sweetness to alongside the abundant sourness. I picked up quite a bit of lemon in the nose, and it faded nicely into the taste. Not at all as sour as some of the other stuff we had at Russian River this night, but it helped to enhance the drinkability. The body was fairly light, and this combined with the less-than-total-mouth-sourness contributed to this brew's high enjoyability."
"D: Drinks very easily, too bad it's impossible to get."
"Thanks Vinnie. Still a very solid offering from Russian River. I actually enjoyed it more the 2nd time I had it when polishing off the Growler."
"- I recommend not drinking your batch 4 bottles for at least another 1-2 years"
"Excellent beer. It's too bad it's very hard to come by."
"Well, this beer has either improved a good bit since I last reviewed it 3 years ago, or its better on draft. Had this at the RR pub. Pours a pale golden with a thin head that sticks around as a thin swirl. The smell is sour, but there are also notes of wintergreen, lactic aromas, some earthy hops and some slight barnyard, and some lemon. Tastes tangy and a bit sour, but with some distinct earthy hops and some funky barnyard. Tart and refreshing with some lingering bitterness from both the hops and the barrel."
"Drinkability: Off the charts for a wild ale, this one disappears."
"A clear golden amber with a thin, wispy head that falls off to a ring leaving little lacing, this looks solid. The nose has a beautiful melony funk, mildly earthy, a little dusty, nutty ( almonds) , honeydew melon, a tartness reminiscent of Meyer lemons. The palate is similarly delightful. A light yogurty lactic tartness, a clean citrus note, a brightness that has flavors of white peach, cantaloupe and honeydew melon. A mild Brett note- a touch of clove, a wisp of bandaid, are also present. Drying on the finish with a soft, buttermilk-like lactic tartness, along with a touch of honey, this is exquisite. Carbonation is moderate, lending a mild carbonic mineral bite, beautifully so.  Still spectacular. 4.5/4.75/4.75"
"D: A wonderful compliment to my dinner. I think this might be my favorite non-Pliny Russian River brew."
"A very refreshing complex sweet, fruit sour bitter beer so good"
"D - This was definitely not as sour as I was expecting, especially given the ""100% Brett"" slogal associated with this wild ale. However, I found this to be quite drinkable and not too over-the-top, as some other heavily Brett-ed brews. Too bad there were no bottles available."
"D-Odd tasting at first but when you get used to it the ""smoothie"" flavor, its not bad."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, velvety and effortless with an effervescent carbonation throughout. This beer is simply amazingly crafted and downright delicious. I would drink this constantly if it was more available. A tart, funky, beauty in a bottle. Russian River knocks it way out of the park once again."
"Sanctify (verb): to entitle to reverence or respect. Sanctification and Russian River are worthy of both. This is a tremendous American wild ale that deserve to be brewed again and again. If you're cellaring a bottle, it's drinking great right now."
"Quite unlike the other RR sours. Not nearly as tart, with more earth and bready components. Infinitely drinkable, a fine beer, even if it doesn't rely compare with it's brethren."
"D: A very good beer and one that I wish was more readily available. I'm new to the world of sours at this point, but I like where things are going."
"D: The sour, despite its boldness, is very approachable. The booze never asserts itself and the range of flavor that emerges from this simple ale is exemplary."
"Overall, another solid sour from Russian River. I wish I had access to this beer on a daily basis."
"This is one of the more drinkable sours I've had as the tartness and funk is perfectly balanced with the underlying sweetness. A great beer."
"D: One of the more drinkable and approachable of Russian River's wild ales, due to the beer being not as sour as some of their others. Really enjoyed this one."
"Another solid Russian River."
"I was not expecting to be floored by this beer. The initial drink sent me for a loop but as I drank a little bit more, the complexities and pleasantness of the taste definitely came out. This is a very easy beer to drink once you get started and will continue throughout."
"One of the more accessible sours that is out there. A great beer that I would like to see reappear in bottles."
"Draught at the brewpub, 5.67%abv. Light straw with a white head. The aroma is floral, and quite lemony-tart, with maybe a light acetic touch. The flavor is sour, and a little funky, with some lemon, leather, and light fruitiness. Light-to-medium bodied with crisp carbonation. After the last two all-brett beers I've had (proef and avery) I wasn't expecting that much acidity in this, but this guy is pretty damn sour, with great leathery, funky tastes going on."
"Overall, easily one of the best wild ales I have had. Incredibly drinkable and flavorful!"
"D - sours are a ""one and done"" beer for me. Very tart. I will get this beer as my first beer from now on."
"Excellent."
"On the other hand, the flavor is more on the punishing side, with a sour, lemon peel dryness balanced by lots of stinky funk. Imagine James Brown singing with a mouthful of Lemonheads...yeah, that's about right. Body is crisp and clean, with a puckering, dry finish of wild yeast. Although I'm still not sold on the whole ""wild/sour"" experience yet, I can appreciate the craft with which Sanctification was brewed. A must-try for any extreme beer lover."
"What a great beer! The balance between the tartness of the citrus and Brett was fantastic, with both taking equal control of the profile, giving this an exquisitely fresh and crisp feel. Great drinkibility on this as well, I killed this glass in no time flat! Another really great tasting Wild Ale from Russian River!"
"A fantastic brew and one of my favorites from my favorite brewery. Seek this one out...."
"D: I could drink this beer for days on end and not get sick of it. It was one of two at R.R. that did that but the other was 10%. This was great!"
"Bottle @ Hamiltion's. Poured a hazy bright yellow-gold with a billowy white head. Thick lacing. Funky straw and citrus. Lots of lemon and sugar, kind of like Lemonhead candy. A fruit basket of other aromas; apple, peaches, pineapple, its all there. Taste is a sweeter sour. Very bretty, but it accents the peaches and pears instead of overruning them. Wheaty/bready flavors in the background enhance the tartness. Its unbelieveably easy to drink. Higher carbonation gives a pop in the finish. Just wish it wasn't so freaking expensive."
"Light bodied, very dry, and great carbonation. This is an extremely drinkable sour. I drank a growler of this the weekend afterward and enjoyed every sip."
"Batch 002. 750ml bottle provided by csbosox. Pours a murky (gusher) straw yellow with a big white head. Funky, hourse blanket, sweet socks, yadda yadda yadda, with some citrus also. frizzzzle's SweetTarts analogy was pretty good. Really fruity and tart. Dry finish with high CO2. Really love these Russian River beers."
"Less sour than I expected (next to beatification, etc). Straw colored, Like a saison meets sour, medium bodied, almost no head, aroma of funk and sours. Some tastes of fruits, apricot maybe, dry finish, but crisp. I'd love to get my hands on more of this."
"Brett bomb. Yeast, bready a bit. A little tart and would be a treat to find this beer properly stored 5 years down the road. sampled from keg at o'briens 15th annv. Complex mid palate, aroma was just funk and brett. Creamy though. A treat to try this brew."
"D: A top 100 beer and I was anxious to try it. Didn't quite live up to the hype, but very tasty and worth the purchase. I hope to get a bottle someday and delve into it more."
"D - So good, probably could not drink more than a snifter at a time."
"I was really curious to see the results of 100% Brett, and in the hands of Russian River this is definitely impressive. Highly recommended to all lovers of sours."
"Another great wild/sour from RR. Flavorful, crisp and refreshing. Supposedly this one is all brett and it really shows."
"D - Big surprise huh? Another wonderfully delicious beer from Russian River? I love the sours from Russian River and this one is very drinkable. I'll be sad when the growler is empty =("
"Overall: I had this one on tap after the Consecration yesterday, and that was a mistake. The Consecration affected my pallette, and I couldnt fully appreciate this one. My wife insisted on a growler, and now I have come to see this beers subtle charm. This one is a winner. Not as sour as I expected, but very complex."
"drinkability is great. the acidity and sourness is restrained, not dominating the nice funky component or taking away from the drinkability. great balance overall. tasty stuff."
"Cloudy straw yellow with a big, fluffy white head. Good retention, some clumpy lacing. The aroma was heavy on brett earthiness, with some wet straw, grass, and funk leading the way. It also smelled of a sharp tartness that had an edge of vinegar and lemon. Flavour was tart too, light vinegar character and a bit of saltiness. It was juicy too, with a fair bit of berry flavour. Nicely balanced overall, with the sourness kept from overpowering the beer. Light bodied with slightly spritzy carbonation, surprisingly smooth texture. Really quite tasty and balanced for a sour beer, likely due to the brett playing nice with us."
"Pours a cloudy golden, big thick pillowy off white head forms, drops some nice lacing, settles to a thin layer, great retention, looks nice. Smell is neat, brett funkiness, some acidity, lemon and orange zest, wood, leather, honey, vanilla, barnyardiness, straw, pretty nice. Taste is acidic to begin, oak, quite tannic, lemon juice, funky, grapefruits, very juicy, nice and sour in the finish, vinegary, pretty kickass. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, very drinkable sour, sourness is well balanced, very nice. I dig this one a lot, lots of character but not over the top. Thanks a ton Matt!"
"D - Sours really aren't my thing so I'll usually call it a day at one, but could drink more if choices are limited."
"Batch 001... Poured a hazy, yellow orange color with a small, white head that left no lacing on the glass. Aroma of leather, horseblanket, dank cobwebs, citrus fruits as well. Taste of brett, orange, citrus peels, white grapes, and sour lemons. Really nice beer."
"D: Not as outstanding or intense as their Consecration and, as such, much easier to drink."
"This is my favorite RRBC sour beer, perhaps because its not over the top mouth-puckering, but more subdued. Awesome stuff. If you like sours, seeks this out."
"750ml bottle of batch 003 courtesy of Asymon13. Nice orange-yellow color and a funky smell. there was a hint of the perennial favorite barnyard, brett, brett, brett. The taste was a little sour with a bretty pineapple flavor that reminded me of DeProef La Deux Brasseur. Good beer, not as sour as I expected but easy drinking and delicious."
"d - Really good. Could drink for a long time!"
"D - Fresh pours create a funky Brett beer that reminded me of the Flemish Primitive series but disappeared into a much more complex beer as it warmed. Very nice without being a lot of barnyard found in other Brett beers."
"Tastes woody drieness with cherry sweet pucker. Lemon, oranges, green apple, and dash of clovey phenol. Md-light mouthfeel with some silkiness. Medium carbonation and moderate drinkability."
"Just as I had to give this a perfect 5 when I first experienced it (and then over and over) at the Russian River brewpub in the August of '07, I have to do the same for this bottle, Bactch 003 that I brought back from that same trip. This bottle poured a beautiful clear golden with a generous white head. The smell is just sour. Also a bit funky/earthy as it warms up, but not overwhelming. The taste I can't really describe as anything other than sour but it's just so good to me. This is my favorite sour beer of all time, at least so far."
"t: I've wanted to try a RR wild ale since I first logged on to BA. Big, big thanks to JohnGalt1 for the chance. The gentle carbonation makes 750ml relativley easy to drink. I hope I get the chance to try more from RR, as this was outstanding."
"drinkability: easy street"
"My least favorite wild ale from Russian River so far but that isn't necessarily a bad thing to say, this is a very well done funky beer."
"D - If it wasn't so hard to find, I could drink this beer very often. Again, I think it tastes like a braggot. For those interested, you might want to compare this brew with Rabbit's Foot Meadery Biere de Miele."
"The drinkability here is pretty good. Shared this bottle with a friend and he hated it, so I'm drinking the entire 750ml bottle."
"Overall I thought this one was excellent and more then deserving of the rep that it has. Really a tight ale here that I would love to try again any day. Absolutly superb in everyway, this was just pure quality. Great job!"
"Pours a semi cloudy yellowish orange color with a very short lived head. Smell is tame, lightly bretty, oaky and well rounded. Taste is oaky, dry, tart, and a light but sharp and pleasant funkiness to the malt. Very drinkable and remarkable smooth, I thought. Great beer."
"Overall: This is one nicely balanced funky brew. It is not over the top like some wild ales I have tried. There is a perfect amount of funk, sourness, and fruit in this one. The carbonation is perfect and oh the Brett. I loved it. If I could have only one wild ale I believe this just may be the one."
"Mouthfeel was very crisp and refreshing. Light bodied and highly carbonated with an acidic, dry finish."
"Great beer overall, drank this a couple hours after Redemption and it blew it away, hope I see this more after Russian River is done with their expansion, highly recommonded for anybody who enjoys wild ales"
"The beer looks like most others, clear golden color with a thick but finely celled foam. There was a thin layer of yeasty sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The aroma and taste are sour, very nice and puckering. There is a hint of sweet maltiness in the smell but mostly this disappears from the flavor as the Brettanomyce takes over. Another excellent Russian River brew."
"Drinkability- Not being the biggest fan of Brettanomyces I was really surprised how much I liked this. It's not over the top sour but just enough that it's the centerpiece of the beer, not the whole beer. There's enough going on around it to keep everything in check. Great beer that drinks way to easy."
"Taste & mouthfeel - Initially quite sour, with pronounced flavors of lemons, bananas and granny smith apples. A subtle malty sweetness slowly reveals itself, mixing with the puckering sourness to create a surprisingly balanced flavor. Light bodied, perhaps a bit thin on the palate. The sweeter flavors come out more and more in the finish, ultimately leaving a faint honey-like flavor on the palate. Acidity and bitterness are fairly low. Exceptional stuff."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This is a solid beer, although there's no denying it's not quite my style."
"Body is fluffy and expansive with carbonation. Highly drinkable and uniquely thirst-quenching."
"Taste is very fruity and and sour and peppery, and it all melds together to an almost mellowness. Peaches, unripened apples, herbal, spicy, and cheesy. Wow, complex with so many subtleties. Mouth is dry, dry, dry, sticky, medium body, feisty carbonation. This is an outstanding beer, and one that I could honestly drink over and over again. It may never pass my lips again, but at least it did, once."
"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle in my DT tulip. It was a bright golden color with a slight haze from little bits of yeast. It had a small bubbly head that quickly went away. A little carb but no lacing. The smell was Brett and barnyard as others have mentioned. Love the Brett aroma but I like the smell on Temptation better. Same on the taste - very Brett with an awesome sour bite but Temptation was a little better. Mouthfeel was great with the sour tearing up the tongue - in a good way. Overall, another great beer from RR and highly recommend. Wish I could get a steady supply of this one."
"Who's afraid of the ""big bad BRET?"""
"Another winner from Russian River"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet-tart, soapy, oaky, and fizzy."
"Pours a hazy pure blonde with a frothy white head that laces sheets as it dies slow. Smells of a sour, wheat and almost a little clove and some spice. Tartness hits the tongue first thing followed by a fruity finish with I swear some clove and spice. Medium in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. Sip her in delight."
"Tastes like the best kind of soda pop you ever did let past your mouth. Very firm limejuice sourness mixed with an incredibly light (but somehow still firm) burn of the yeast. The balance is so amazing that even though it's not hugely complex it still deserves a perfect score. And--well, Geez I can't even get my head around what it takes to craft a beer as wonderfully unique as this one."
"The first time I tried this was Feb 2005. My latest tasting was Nov 2007. It still is a good as I first remembered it."
"Drinkability: Awesome brett content with plenty of twang and earthy flavors. Very highly drinkable like many other beers from this brewery. They certainly have carved out a big niche that many of us have figured out and have become festidious followers. Seek it out."
"Cheers!"
"I enjoy this type of beer anytime, and this was no exception. This doesn't have the sheer puckering tartness nor the complexity of some of their other Wild Ales, but it is a good, straightforward sour ale worth enjoying time and time again..."
"Blonde with a short lived white head. Moderate lacing. Wonderfuly aroma of funk and peppery spice hits the nose immediately. Taste follows suite - Black pepper, funky tart green apples and under-ripe pears. Quite tart, but not overwhelming. Other tastes are allowed to exert themselves. Mouthfeel is nice, especially as the beer is allowed to warm. Carbonation is not too prickly, a problem my other favorite sour brewer JP often presents. Drinkability is super high for me. Alcohol is not noticable, and the level of tartness is perfect. I'll have to make more trips out West for this baby."
"It starts off good with a slightly cloudy blond body topped with a thinish white head. The aroma is good and sour and have some apple fairly prominently. The apple caries over into the flavor and the sour is good but not too intense. Towards the back of the palate there is a slightly heavier almost dusty sourness that reminds me of Orval. The body is still nice and light and I would love this to be my standard hot weather drink."
"Thanks, BeerTruth for the opportunity"
"Might be a bit too much going on with this beer. The sour isn't really straightforward, and the yeast is a bit misplaced. The fruit component also seems to not be integrated all that well."
"D- This beer is sublimely drinkable. I could drink glass after glass. The sour taste really does it for me."
"Drinkability: This is an amazingly drinkable beer. I could go for this again and again, and can see picking up a case of this if funds permitted (I never buy cases, but this one would be a rare exception). I like it."
"Pretty much perfect. Sanctification could have been be an unblended lambic from one of the Belgian grandmasters. It was so wonderful that I drank four or five glasses and bought half a case on the spot. Its simply that good. Appearance wise we are talking about a very pale, almost white golden ale body with a healthy white lacing. The aroma is powerful, previewing sourness, and boasting of perfectly created and utilized yeast strains and lots of funky, living organisms. Barnyard funk, rotten lemon peals, and apple vinegar are huge. The nose also plays at tobacco and citrus. The first taste is pure heaven. Its tart in a lemony way, sour in a bret/funky yeast sort of way, slightly bitter in a hoppy way, light and spritsy. Sweet, very ripened grapefruit that has been eaten away at just a touch by bacteria, hay, damp corn husks, rotten melons, wood roundedness, dashes of lemon and orange zest, etc Bone dry and fairly light body. Musty and astringent. Sourness is not over the top and although this doesnt enter the battery acid or sweaty donkey hair area, this is at times very geuze like. Sessionable indeed. Pretty much perfect."

"Very nice beer. Good that an experiment in 100% Brettanomyces beer holds up so well with age. The overall balance and uniqueness is pretty special."
"This beer was masterfully brewed and formulated and the brett did an amazing job of creating a truly unique flavor profile."
"A great puckering finish leaves you wanting more. Perfectly carbonated as per usual with RR wild ales. At 6.5% abv (this is batch 3, I guess the BA value of 7.5% abv is for previous batches) this is very drinkable. RR's wild selection has yet to falter, every single one has been excellent and this is definitely no exception."
"It's been a few months since I last had Temptation, but I think Sanctification is fairly similar. A great wild ale and another fine example of RR's mastery of the style."
"Russian River does it yet again..."
"Thin mouthfeel is expected from the high levels of attenuation that wild yeast bring to the table. Lots of carbonation. Very nice beer I would recommend this to any beer enthusiast."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy light golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger white creamy head which lasts a little while, then leaves some nice slicks and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of malts, beligium yeast, grapes, pears, and some spices. The taste is very nice, tangy/slightly sour, yeasty, slightly spicy. Medium body, highly carbonated. Very drinkable, really enjoying this one, another awesome brew from RR. Thanks again buddy."
"750 ml, 6.25 % ABV. Hazy golden in color, with a nice white foamy head. Aroma of lemon zest, and pepper. Funky aroma is present, not quite leathery.Fruity, very tart and full of lemon zest. Great patches of lace are left coating the glass. Great body, almost a creamy mouthfeel. Very soft carbonation. This is very tasty, and full of flavors. The tartness is almost puckering, but stops just shoty. What a great beer. Thanks to mcallister for sharing."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a cratery 1"" bright white head over the cloudy golden brew. Head stand pat for quite some time, and lacing is prevalent and sticky. Aroma indicates sharp tartness and wood notes. Taste is funky sourness upfront, in the middle, pretty much everywhere, with malt backbone and barrel notes becoming apparent at the end. Mouthfeel for the wild style is very nice, with the maltiness smoothing the tart somewhat, making drinkability quite nice as well. Maybe a Cantillon warm-up?"
"Thumbs up to this unique brew! Savoring this 750 bomber, got another for cellering."
"A bit barnyard and yeast aroma. A Good wild ale, it's so great sourness in your face initially,I detect the wild yeast, then you get used to it, in a lemon yeasty haze. Good lacing and head. Satisfying aftertaste.Great with supper. Thanks Solomon420."
"Easily drinkable thanks to the balance of carbonation. Nice smooth refreshing mouthfeel."
"D: This beer really grows on you. Citric acid sits on the lips after each sip, reminding the drinker of fresh lemon juice. I'm really digging this one."
"Very nice overall."
"750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Batch 002. This beer poured a pale golden color with a thick, foamy white head and good lacing. The head stuck around for awhile. The aroma of this beer was lemony and a bit sour. Trademark RR brett but not overly sour and not to the extent of Beatification. The taste is very sour as I was hoping for and has a nice touch of citrus that leads to a dry finish. The body is sort of light but has active carbonation in the body so it feels bigger. Overall a very strong and tasty beer that ranks up near my impression of Beatification but just slightly lower."
"Bottom line: A superb American Wild Ale, in my book. My hat's off to Russian River for, once again, travelling down the off the beaten track!"
"750 ml bottle."
"Overall: Another major step forward by the master of all that is Wild to American Ales. A Classic. Haughty but very well Educated."
"Drinkability: An experience, really something that will take your palette to a new level. If you're ready to move into the double black diamond territory, this is epic, genius, just one step beyond. Best sour ale ever?"
"i plan to cellar a bottle also, hoping for the breadiness to even out and allow the brettanomyces to evolve to the next level. excellent work."
"Notes: this is lambic. is it authentic? is the word gueze or lambic anywhere on the bottle? no. yet it fits squarely within the style. I just started drinking true gueze a few months ago and this is within the style. No, it's not better than true Belgian gueze but it holds it's own. Worth getting for the price alone, as if considered lambic this is the greatest bargin i've seen for the style."
"Hazy orange. Fairly aromatic, not very funky, but full of papaya and lemon scents. Light doughy malt followed by an overwhelming sour assault. Notes of horseblanket, snake skin and sour lemons. Light and bubbly feel on the palate. Its really funny that this beer is made in the middle of Sonoma County. I like it, a lot."
"A very nice brew."
"Finishes long and drying, with puckering warmth and a final yeast bite."
"Beautiful light golden appearance. The light white head fades a bit, letting the beer have your attention. Aromatic and fruity nose. Sawdust-like dry yeast helps to bring out the vinous character from the barrels, feels almost cidery with those apples undertones. Fruits are plentiful in there, grapey, pineapple.. Very classy nose. Pretty accessible palate as well. Sandy dryness all around is enhanced toward the finish. White wine flashes are a constant. Wildish, dusty and woody, tannins are held at a minimum, so is the tartness, mild and diplomatic. Medium-full bodied, very active carbonation, expansive and biting. It feels like scene masters crowning achievement in having everything well displayed. As unique as it is, it makes for a nice play, but one that will never contend being the best of your life."
"A nice brew -- classic, sparkling, summer in a bottle, with enough funk and farmhouse to let you know it's there...but not enough to scare away the casual belgie fan. Solid stuff. Thanks to the fellas who know who they are that treated me to this at UJs. Glad I had it."
"The abv is now 6.25."
"I like brett and the taste, but this one was so overwhelming with the brett it was hard to discern anything else going on. Underlying blonde ale gets overwhelmed. Not nearly as good as Orval. But nice and a very good beer."
"Drinkability was most excellent. I would gladly have this again were it available here."
"822"
"Bright golden with a huge fluffy head. Beautiful lacing patterns ensue. Aromas are pure refreshing brett-laden Belgian golden ale hints with fresh baked french bread, some dank cheese, and other fram house styled funk. The taste follows suit with some plainly refreshing blonde ale flavors hitting the palatte up front followed by all of the funky brett notes, and some bready maltiness as well. There are also some fresh herbal/medicinal/leafy orval-like Belgian hop flavors mid-palatte as well. Mouthfeel is fluffy on the tongue, light, and super refreshing and this makes the drinkability insanely good as well..."
"Drinkability- Summer brew all the way. Put this in six packs and I'm there. Teriffic poolside brew."
"(much thanks to axisjones!)"
"The taste is light and spritzy up front with a sharp lemony acidity that has a nice sweetness to it that almost tastes artificial in nature. This beer foams quite a bit on the tongue as it goes down. The finish is slightly funky, though not nearly as much as the aroma would suggest. The finish is slightly earthy with a musty cellar note. This beer really is quite light and refreshing, it is almost as if a lemon has been added to my Duvel glass. While I really am enjoying this beer, I am starting to think that Brettanomyces is better employed as a supporting cast member in beer. Granted I have only had two of these 100% Brett beers, but as the beer gets older than a couple of months the beer needs some more complexity that would be supplied by a funky Belgian yeast."
"Drinkability: A very good and drinkable beer that is welcome in my mouth anytime!"
"Vinnie described it as a sour blonde Belgian ale. It is primarily fermented with 100% Brettanomyces and bottle conditioned to create lush carbonation. It may not fall perfectly into a BJCP Guideline (other than Belgian specialty, of course) but this is one of the most drinkable ales on the planet. I kind of see it as an American made Belgian equivalent to a German Berliner Weisse, but thats just my own take on it. Whatever you call it, this ale is good good good."
"I sampled this at the wet-hop tasting at RFDs in Washington, D.C. This came out a slightly cloudy golden orange with a decent bit of head to it that left some lace. Aroma was fruity and had a little spice and sweetness to it. Taste was similar with various fruity flavors over a layer of sweetness and spiciness. There was a nice tartness to it as well. Mouthfeel was a bit light and drinkability was ok. Interesting take on the style that I would try again."
"I gather that this one was a bit of an experiment from the brewer. While not outstanding, I would say that the result was a pretty good beer."
