"Excellent, overall.  One of my favorites from a 7-taster afternoon at the Cascade pub.  Though a few were on the sweet side, the apricot was a more well-balanced beer, overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer offers a flavor of underripe stone fruits and apricot, with a full lactic tart quality. A solid apricot sour, but slightly lacking in full palate notes and fruit flavor."

"waves of tartness transform into juicy apricot notes once it begins to warm up."
"2012, nice sour flavor, still smooth, good head, glad I picked this over some others at Nectar in Pa"
""
""
"O - Delicious apricot flavor, even 2+ years out, with a bold, smooth, well integrated acidity."
""
"This brew sure matured well (2011). A Sour with a delicate apricot background that is able to show intense acid and sour notes without producing awkward sensations."
""
""
""
""
"From start to finish this beer was perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really naturally fruity and delicious."
"2013 vintage. Very nice sour, just wish there was more fruit apparent. Dangerously drinkable, I crushed this in less than an hour. Warning: will overflow when you pop it."

"This is a very bold sour, but I do tend to prefer the more nuanced sours."

"Well executed stone fruit sour. Huge notes of apricot and lemon on the nose and mouth puckering fruit forward taste, minimal funk, quite acidic and dry finish.  Cheers Cascade."

"Very sour upfront. Not just the initial shock, but a second tartness in the aftertaste that is very much apricots. Constantly reminded of lambic/gueuze, maybe being an older vintage attributed to this but I am loving it. As my glass warms and my mouth gets accustomed to the sourness, more oak and apricots show up along with a vinious flavor. Not overly dry and well carbonated, makes me thirsty for more without raking my tongue. I'd be interested to taste a fresher bottle but this 2011 is right up my alley - everything I want in a fruited sour is here. Fantastic beer and a wonderful introduction to Cascade."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice wild ale from Cascade, perhaps a bit simple, but the balance is nice. Plenty of apricot as advertised, but aside from the bits of funk and malt, there isn't a whole lot else going on, that being said, this was extremely refreshing and very enjoyable to drink on a relaxing afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've never fallen for a sour. While I can appreciate a good gueuze, I'm never in the mood for one. This might change that. I already want another."

"O: Overall this is very solid. The perfect appearance and mouthfeel are going to garner a very high overall score but the smell will knock it down. I was expecting a little bit more out of this one. Cascade Blueberry is one of my most favorite brews and I think I had such high expectations for Apricot that it almost isn't fair to review it on my first time having it. During the early parts of this review I was sort of bashing it a bit because it didn't live up to the expectations but now that I've been drinking through more of it it is really growing on me. I'd definitely drink it again and will probably buy another one to try to have it in a less biased situation but I wouldn't see myself shelling out $30/bottle for it on a regular basis. In the end it misses the sourness I was expecting while wowing me with lots of fruit that isn't too sweet or dry. Great balance. Great beer. Kudos."

"Beautiful deep blonde color; deep golden orange. Opaque. Rich one finger head when poured; foam laced the surface of the glass and beer the entire time I was drinking the beer. Delicious small; sweet and fruity with a slight sour finish. Taste matched the smell; sweet (but not too sweet) fruity taste with a slightly sour finish. Kind of a sweet and sour effect. Absolutely delicious. Nice medium plus body; smooth with lots of very light carbonation. Overall I found this beer to be outstanding. Definitely one of my favorites of all time. Wanted more!"

"This is delicious stuff yet again from Cascade, with a great take on a type of sour that more of the big guys that make these kinds of beers right should experiment with. There's something really appropriate about using apricots for sour beers - its naturally acidic, dry, and tart character melds so naturally at hand. I'm happy to have another bottle on hand that I've held onto since July. I should consider cracking it open soon before the highlighted fruit character fades away!"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2011 vintage. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of huge tart green apple, apricot, lemon, raspberry, white wine, oak, clove, white vinegar, leather, hay, straw, musty funk, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of tart fruitiness, oak, and funky/acidic yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart green apple, apricot, lemon, raspberry, white wine, white vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, pepper, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Big fruity acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour green apple, apricot, lemon, raspberry, white wine, white vinegar, oak, clove, musty funk, hay, straw, leather, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of tart/sour yeast ester, fruit, and oak barrel flavors; with a good fruit/sourness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very acidic, crisp, and fairly smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fruited sour ale! Amazing complexity and balance of apricot fruit with fruity/sour yeast ester and oak barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on even with the big acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O-This is a great fruit-forward beer. I don't think it packs the complexity of a Fou Foune, but it certainly beats out many other lesser imitations. The apricot flavor is pure and authentic tasting and the balance of fruit and sour is almost perfect. Another well-done sour by Cascade."

"Clear golden with a fluffy white head. Amazing floral apricot, candy sugar, and caramel aroma with vanilla and oak notes. Creamy very bright and yet lively palate. Tastes of orange, apricot, lemon, caramel, green apple, vanilla, and oak with a tart, lightly acidic, crisp, dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's probably my favorite out of a limited sampling of Cascade beers. What minor shortcomings it has in look and smell, it more than makes up for with a fantastic taste and a nice, invigorating mouthfeel. As one of the more reasonably-priced Cascade beers, it's one I'm likely to try to get my hands on again. Outstanding stuff."
""
""
"I really enjoyed the look of this beer. Poured into an oversized wine glass. Tons of bubbly white head that stayed throughout me drinking. I would get to the bottom of the glass and still have some of that sticky bubbles at the bottom, each new pour brought more beer, and lots more bubbles. A great peachy-orangy-ambery-yellowy color that I found extremely inviting. Aroma was a bit lack-luster: citrusy acidic tartness with some faint apricot. Taste was a punch in the mouth sour. I found my mouth watering from the aftertaste. Really dry, super tart, and great balanced fruitiness (apricot/kumquat) with some mild woody-spiciness. This beer literally danced around my tongue and had a nice light body without being watery."
"an absolutely gorgeous beer, totally brings cascade into my most desired breweries list. thanks to my twin brother for making this happen somehow. understated pale yellow color to this, with an active rising white bubbly head, but its the nose that hooks me hard. it smells like fresh apricot, really and truly, the most authentic fruit nose ever, its perfect. i smell the little fuzzies, the juicy flesh, the pollen, the woody pit, all of it, its genius. it has got some lactic funk too and its dry and just making my mouth water like nothing else. superb smell, best i can recall. the flavor is a little less fluently apricot, still head and shoulders more genuine than any other apricot beer ive had, but its not quite as in my face as the aroma. tart as anything too from the yeast and bugs, its funky, summery, desserty. like smuckers apricot jam its got all that sugar, but doesnt really taste sweet, thats the brilliance of this brew. great carbonation and a really intense sour prickle, more than i can almost take. dries me right out too, i cant get enough. in a night packed with world class sours, this was perhaps my favorite. its authentic fruit and tart acidity make a great combination, i would love to drink this again. incredible beer."

"overall one of cascades best. love it and have returned to it many times."

"As mentioned before the flavour components are all there in its full glory. Its not a subtle beer where everything interacts with each other well, but rather it is a brash beer that is tart, sweet, sour, acidic and funky all at the same time.. but it is not particularly complex. In all the jumble, a bit of the essence of this beer is lost. Perhaps some time will do it good."
"O- The sourness on this beer seemed to overwhelm some of the great flavors that I am sure are hidden underneath. I just didn't get much complexity that I would expect for a beer that spent so much time in the barrel."

"The nose has some light apricot smell. Very fresh smelling and bright. Some lemony tartness on the nose as well. The beer is a hazy peach color and reminds of apricots. The taste is like a fresh unripened apricot. After having other Cascade offerings, I was expecting a bit more apricot flavor to shine through. It was quite acidic, but the finish was nice, unripened apricot."
"O - Pricy but well worth a try. Great to see a beer like this produced in the US."
""
""
""
"(O)- Definitely a hefty sourness with subtle oaky fruits, but I dig it."

"Every Cascade sour I've encountered has been great. But this is extra great. Stupidly tart, gloriously sour, and interestingly fruity. This is a gem."
"This is about as complex a wild as I've encountered from a US brewery. Massively fruity and as tart as they come. I'll be picking it up every time I see it."

"T: Opens with a big sour kick in the teeth. Sharp lemon bite, tart apricot and green apple and a ton of lactic sourness. There's a hit of dryness on the finish that seems to suck the moisture right out of your mouth. Once the dryness fades, I get a lingering jammy apricot note with some underripe cherry and oak. One of the best sours I've ever come across. I would love to be able to get this on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The appearance and nose of this beer is underwhelming, but the taste is simply divine. It's really a perfectly balanced sour: acetic without being overpowering, the fruit and oak delicately balanced on the tongue. If youre expecting a fruit beer with tons of apricot character, you'll be disappointed. For all other sour-heads: highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I Guess I will be the exception here. I and the others at my place thought this was just awful. It smelled and tasted like apple cider vinegar with no apricot to be found. I have had and enjoyed a few of the other cascade projects but this was just not drinkable imo. It fizzed in my sink like a cleaning product would."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid apricot sour that balances the tartness and fruit flavor well"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Enjoyable, but really sour, which masks any complexity it has. A passive taste doesn't reveal all of the flavors."
"Pricy but this is the real deal. Not often do you get to see an apricot wild ale and this pulls it off with flying colors. It was a fresh batch and it showed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Each sip just reminds me of biting into a super ripe apricot and other similar pitted fruits. So flavorful and the tart wild aspect of the beer just tops it off to become a truly great brew. Maybe the best beer I have had this year. Some people seem to not get the apricot much but this bottle was fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a straight-up, solid apricot sour. I'd use this as a standard for all other apricot ales. I wonder if its just as good fresh? I believe it's on par with Bruery's SitR Kumquats. Perfect on a sunny, summer day."
""
""
""
""
"overall: after sang noir, this is my next favorite cascade sour. better than figaor, noyeaux, sang royal, strawberry, blueberry. i have a second one and ill be drinking it fresh to make sure its as good as this one. well done cascade!"
""
""
""

"O- one of my favorite beers, This drinks so easily, only drawback is the price, worth considering a move closer to the barrel house"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was an interesting and enjoyable beer for me. For the price tag, though, I'm not sure i'd buy it again. I've probably had about a dozen sour beers at this point, and I kind of consider it the last beer frontier for me. Within the style, its probably the best i've had (or close to it). If you don't like sour beer or have never had it before, i'm not so sure this would convert you though...or at least I wouldn't take the chance for the steep price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: Very well balanced and tasty. This is a well-crafted apricot sour. Being my first beer from Cascade, I am very impressed and will definitely seek out more from them."

"O - a very good sour ale. The fruit isn't overwhelming but instead compliments the acidity very well."

"O: Very nice beer. You know it's a Cascade sour, and you know it was brewed with apricots. Can you really ask for anything more? I'd love to get me hands on a few more bottles and drink this a few times a year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A simply stunning beer. This is fairly close to perfect. I'd like to see just a tad more complexity in the smell. Otherwise, there's not much that can be done to improve this beer."
""
""
""
"Like most of the Cascade fruit wilds, the added fruit does not add much. The Kriek being the exception. Still a worthwhile sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All around, this is really a fantastic beer. The flavors are great; fruity, juicy, quenching, tart, mildly funky, oaky - complex and refined. Really my only large complaint is the fact that your stomach might have an easier time handling battery acid than this stuff. Although I'm not ready to blame my entire abdominal agony on this beer since it wasn't the only sour of the night, you could definitely feel each sip as it went down. But there's no doubt that I'd gladly suffer for this one again, it's far too tasty to pass up."

"Overall Impression- Haven't done a review in a while so when I popped this one, thought it would be a good one to start back on! Super sour and has a great apricot background. Highly Recommend this one and wouldn't mind picking up another one of these in the near future! Trade anyone?"
""

"Something I’d drink again but I know it’s not cheap, pretty stoked I have the blueberry version to look forward too"

"A barrel aged apricot Wild Ale? You know that won't come cheap. You have to open your wallet a little wider if you want to try a beer like this. Was it worth it? I'd say its the price. I'm saying that because I enjoy this style. In the end, this was a very good sour and tart fruit based Wild Ale. It was nice to see that the oak doesn't take over the taste. It was the apricot that ruled over this taste. The beer stays true to its name."

"D - Great wild ale. The apricots are nice and tart and the overall beer well balanced."
""
""
""
"O: Once again, Cascade doesn't disappoint. My favorite offering from them to date. The Apricot in this one is perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has very nice amounts of sourness and tartness, but neither of these are over the top and are somewhat balanced off by the apricots."
"O: The alcohol in this beer is very well hidden, almost dangerously so... This beer has a lot of sourness and tartness, so it is not a fast drinking or sessionable beer but is very enjoyable. I would be happy to find this one again."

"A slightly hazy golden-orange pour that got hazier towards the end of the bottle. A somewhat aggressive pour yielded a large foamy cap of white head that settled down to a thick collar, leaving quickly-receded lacing on the glass. Tart, lactic aroma, apricot and pear. This obviously followed through into the taste, with the tart apricot pretty much dominating all, with a biscuity malt base detectable. Pretty sour, I must say. This followed an Upland Blackberry, and pretty much nuked my palate even after that one. A woody, barrel profile emerged later, getting more pronounced near the middle/end of the bottle. Medium body, spritzy carbonation. Quite good overall, but not something I'd drink regularly. I definitely needed an antacid after this and the Upland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - another well crafted fruit sour from Cascade. It's a pleasure to drink and should satisfy anyone who likes sour fruit ales. This one doesn't have much contribution from the barrel, but I don't care, because it tastes great."
""
"The pour produces a finger of bone-white head atop a hazy, sunset golden ale. The nose packs a big, lemon-lime and passionfruit acid punch with a good deal of apricot, green apple, tangerine, pineapple, white grape, and honeysuckle. Lighter and refreshing with a full carbonation. Oaked, crisp white wine all over this one. Flavors of apricot, tangerine, and green apple with a big crabapple sour that sticks to the roof of your mouth. Aged hops. Dry oaky, vinegar-sour finish. Sour may have moved in a little more than in my August sample. The bacteria is complex, the fruits enticing, and the oak perfect. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: another phenomenal beer from cascade I am extremely impressed. It is sweet, sour, fruity and great feel. I highly recommend this beer if you can get it"
""
""
"The combination of twelve months in oak followed by ten months on apricots did wonders for this fruit flavored sour ale. Not only was it complex and remarkably unique, but also incredibly refreshing and drinkable. This was well worth the steep price of admission and would make a fantastic warm weather treat. If I have the opportunity to sample this again, I would love to try a fresher bottle to see if the apricot flavor is more apparent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic, clean, sour beer. Love the subtle apricots with the sweet candy tartness. Surprisingly amount of malt that really works with the sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"2011, 7.76%, 750ml... cork took some effort to extract. Pours a hazy amber with one finger thick dense white head, settles to a thin ring leaving a couple of rings down the glass. Smell: acetic, oak, a little hay-heavy barnyard funk, apricot. Taste: fruited vinegar, vanilla; tartness backed by sugary dried apricot."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Another great sour from Cascade. The apricot was a bit more toned down than I was hoping for, but this is still an excellent beer. I'd probably put this one slightly below some their others I've had though."

"Pours a hazy gold with amber accents. A big fluffy two and half finger bright white head adorns the glass, fantastic retention and gobs of lacing are left clinging to the sides. Floral and grassy notes, apricot, bready, slightly funky yeast, vinegar, and hints of oak on the nose. Oak, juicy apricot, Juicy Fruit bubblegum notes, yeasty esters, light barnyard funk, that finishes with lactic acid and white wine vinegar sour and tartness. Light medium bodied, moderate effervescent carbonation. Smooth and silky mouthfeel with syrupy accents. One deliciously complex American sour. Definitely one that shouldn't be missed."

"Fresh bottle in 2012 (2011 Project). Unibroue tulip glass. Pours orange with fizzy and quickly receding head. Smell is sour vinegar with a hint of citrus and apricot (as expected). Major sour flavor from beginning to end. Very slight fruit flavor that seems mostly overpowered by the sour vinegar. Perhaps this mellows and highlights the fruit as it ages? Light bodied with high effervescent carbonation. Just was hoping for more fruit. Way overpriced at $20 a bottle for what it is, but a solid beer overall. I think I just wanted more apricot, because the dry sourness is pretty awesome. Good beer."

"Cascade, you are doing it right."

"Medium body, decent carbonation, dry and lasting on the tongue. This might be my favorite wild ale from Cascade yet, next to Vlad."
"This is an excellent, flavorful brew with great tartness and slight apricot sweetness that plays well with some spice notes and woody wild funk. (4.5)"

"Cascade Apricot is a nice orange hued beer with some spots of faded gold within the liquid. The cap was about an inch in height and off white in height. It dwindles eventually into nothing, leaving no stick on the glass. After a while the liquid looks kind of dead. Smell is of fresh apricot pith, this is an extremely fresh bottle that just touched down in Philly, not sure how long it was in the bottle before I opened it immediately. Warmed up, apricot, pale malt, some lactic quailty and no alcohol. It's a pleasant smell, just not all together bold. Taste is pretty balanced, expecting a sour bomb I am greeted by fresh apricot, orange, pale malt, french oak and some lactic funk. The wood shows up more towards warming with orange popping out as well melding in with the apricot. Feel is a step below medium, the funk and apricot hit the tounge and leave off with light malt and lactic twinges. Carb is surprisingly low, but I guess that works with the acidic nature of cascade, which is heavy on the lacto/acidic nature of their sours. While not all that extremely sour, this is a pleasant beer that I think others could open up to, especially girls."

"O - Overall, this was a delicious beer albeit at a steep price point. Wish I could drink stuff like this more often/throughout the year. Excellent job from Cascade."

"Overall (5/5): Apricot Ale was a wonderful introduction to Cascade Brewing. It is a great spin on sour ale. Everything about this beer–its appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel–is stellar. The no-holds-barred tartness and beautifully effervescent, slightly puckering mouthfeel really won me over. If you like sour ales and haven't tried any brews by Cascade, you must do so post haste."
""
"O: this beer is delicious, great balance between sweetness and tartness, with an awesome mouthfeel, awesome!"

"What a fantastic exception if you can't have Fou Foune! I love the fact this is made in America would love to have this on a regular basis."
""
"Overall: this is a tasty and very refreshing beer; insanely drinkable for its high ABV. I happen to love well-done fruit sours, and this beer is no exception. This is where I eschew objectivity and just say that this is a beer that really works for me; love it!"
""
""
"O- A delicious beer, one of the better American sours I've had recently, excellent all-around."

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Pours an amber hue, with a decent amount of hops. Somewhat cloudy in appearance. Aroma is very fruity as would be expected, with apricot, lemon and some earthiness. Some funk in there as well. Flavor is an excellent combo of sweet and sour. More sour than sweet, but a surprising amount of fruit and some malt as well balance out the sourness very well. Nice citrus notes as well. Modest amount of carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent beer - my favorite in this style."
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a huge bubbly white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of tart pitted fruit with a solid shot of funk. The nose is full of citrus and lactic aroma's. The flavor is quite tart and acidic. A solid shot of lemons and sweet tarts with some light tart fruit, a hint of alcohol and a sneaky bit of oak and vanilla. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a tart lactic bubbly mouthfeel. This is a really nice sour ale, I really enjoyed this on the night before hurricane Sandy."
""
""
"2011 Project. Apricot always was one of my favorite Jolly Rancher flavors... Anyway, this stuff pours a mildly hazy golden-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises apricot jam, tangerine zest, mandarin orange, lemon zest, and a vague sense of sweetening spices way in the background. The taste holds notes of lactic peach, funky wheat, and lemon flesh. It's a bit simpler than the nose, but tasty and effective nonetheless. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a highly enjoyable fruity sour, one I really wish I could try over and over again. Good times."
""
""
"O: Overall, a great beer. I loved this one. The tripel base morphed into a sour lambic is my kind of beer. Great complexity and depth. Amazing aroma and great palate profile. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
"Clearly, another great offering from the gang at Cascade!"
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some peach and apricot aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and super drinkable."
""
"O: I've yet to be anything less than blown away by everything I've had from Cascade. Granted I haven't had any of their non-sour beers. This beer is delicious and since it is damn near impossible to cop some Fou' Foune around these parts, this is a worthy substitute and every bit as good in my opinion."
""
""
""
"M: Light bodied, dry finish."
"Murky orange with a billowing white head, that's transient and fades to a white ring with mild retention. Nose has some blond ale leanings with acetic character, sweeter oak and fruitiness - apricot is light but identifiable. A bit of Macintosh apple as well. Taste is acetic up front, vinegar, apricots over a sweeter blond ale character. More green/Macintosh apple, without any alcohol. Sweet/sour finish, medium carbonation and acetic pucker, which gives impression of a carbonation that's higher than it is. More apricot flavour here than Fou Foune I thought, but doesn't hold that same kind of funk that the Cantillon provides - superior in fruit flavour inmy mind though. A fantastic fruited sour."
""
""
"Overall another tasty sour from Cascade. So drinkable and refreshing, I can't stop taking another sip."
"Hazy copper orange pour with a huge plume of fluffy white head that laces thickly. There isn't any distinct sediment and the head retention is quite fair. The nose is distinctly apricoty with an underlying tartness and subtle sweetness. The taste is very well balanced as sweetness from the malt and fruit play nicely with the souring bacteria on my palate. There is a residual acetic dryness, but it doesn't feel as if microbial cultures are growing on my palate. The beer tastes/feels a tad watered down. It's refreshingly fruity, drinkable, and sour as expected without any noticeable alcohol (considering this beer's abv is nearly 2x a fou'foune). I definitely enjoyed this beer and it's reasonable to acquire (including cost and availability in my area - shipped direct from the brewery). I will purchase it again at next year's release."
"O: The fruit presence on this beer is awesome. Really impressed."

"A fantastic fruit lambic, one of the best American ones I've had. Excellent balance of tart sour with sweet fruit, though it definitely leans more towards the sour. Bottle says to serve at 40 degrees F, and I agree. As it warmed up, the sour became more prominent, overpowering the apricot, and it didn't have the same smooth balance."
""
""
"One of my absolute favorites."
""

"pours a nice golden ale with a white rim of foam. I dive in nose first - straight childhood hit me - I grew up with an apricot tree in the backyard. This was beautiful. I can't understand how they get the apricot into the nose like this - fucking magic. I taste, anticipating a little too sweet. I was wrong. Nice and tart with a good apricot flavor and some hints of lemon and the slightest taste of copper. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off dry finish. I left with four bottles - so I musta liked it. So did my bride, so that is awesome."

"Overall: Really satisfying wild ale. It's a touch too hot, and could be a bit more complex, but it's expertly crafted regardless. Leaps and bounds better than the equally easy to find Cascade Kriek. Will definitely buy more bottles of Apricot."
"O: Great beer with the perfect level of sourness, sweetness, and barrel characteristics to make this extremely drinkable. I thought the apricot would have faded by now (early 2013), but it's still there. Does well with food."
""
""
"O- An excellent sour from Cascade. Sour and tart yet crisp and very drinkable. This beer brings the sourness and funk but doesn't completely overwhelm. The fresher the better when it comes to the apricots. Definitely worth grabbing a bottle, even at $17 a pop."

"Overall, cascade can't do wrong, period. An amazing wild with all the trimmings."

"O: This is a great great beer. My first Apricot based sour, and I'm really enjoying this bottle. Many fine layers of flavor are showcased in this brew. Though I do wish there was a bit more apricot in the taste; I assume the fruit has mellowed down a cosiderable amount, as the beer has two years on it. I'd love t try this fresh. Nonetheless, this is an outstanding brew crafted by the crew at Cascade."
"Overall. Starts out slightly ...shocking with that aggressive sourness but man, this stuff is addictive. Really liked it."

"Overall: One of the great american sours currently being produced."
"O- first lambic/wild ale i've had of the apricot variety and really enjoyed it. loving the lactic spin on the tripel. seek this one out as the price was moderate and a quality apricot sour is quite hard to come by."
"This was neat, and really sour, but not worth the hype, and not full of apricot."
""
""
"Tim's bottle, 2008 vintage, that has mellowed out as we shall see. Orange coloured body, understated carbonation. Very malty, subdued acidity. Very good drinkability. i'm glad to have had it, but not overwhelmed, perhaps the bold taste of a fresh vintage makes a difference."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice and inventive sour ale. The barrel notes are really strongly integrated and work well with the heavy fruit. The apricot is definitely the star here, and showcases great sweet and tart notes. I was really surprised the fruit was so present this long after bottling. I would definitely have this again although the price tag is a bit heavy at $20 a bottle."
"2009 bottling. 9,0% alc/vol. 750ml brown bottle shared with friends. Clear amber with a white head. I really like this peachy nose, apricot candy. Some acidity on the nose. The fuzzy peach taste is very interesting. Easy drinking, light and refreshing. This is a classic to be."
""
"Drink- I was just talking with Cpabeer the other day about how good Cascade was and how I needed to try more. This was one of those bottles I need another one or to go seek out some other flavors. Very clean and crisp. Well layered and I appreciate the amount of fruit in it.."
""
""
""

"O: Wow, my first dabble with Cascade and definitely not my last. This is amazing. I have one more bottle of this but definitely going to age it as long as I can to see how it develops."

"Pours a copper orange color with a thin white head and a decent lace left behind. The nose is overly sweet and simple seeming a touch artificial. Candied sugars and spearamint tickle the nose as appricots take over and dominate. The taste is sugary and minty, lots of appricot roll over the tongue. Very little integration as the mint, sugars, and fruit don't seem to have a defined roll. This is overly sweet with a creamy syrupy feel, prickly carbonation in the back, and a touch wet and oily."
"Overall: One of my favorite sours, fantastic blend here with great oak quality and fantastic lactic/acetic treatment."

"This bottle is the 2009 vintage and pours a somewhat cloudied amber in color with a two finger and very effervescent head. The aromas are of very, very fresh apricots. It kind of smells like those candy Peach rings. It is very fruity and somewhat sweet. For the style it isn't on par but otherwise it does smell appealing. It tastes of tart dried apricots and peaches, almost like a poor man's geueze. There is a slight dryness but you do get a good amount of sweet and candied fruit. It drinks semi dry and light to medium in body. Overall this beer is just ok in my opinion. I appreciate that they made a beer with this fruit but it is just so fresh and fruity, even being the 2009 vintage. I would like a more tartness or a legitimate sourness and not so much gummy candies. If this beer was drier, and had some funk, it could be spectacular. Right now, it's just ok and not really of your $20+."

"D/O: An excellent sour ale, this beer is not as palate-friendly as its reputation might sometime suggest. It is full of bold flavors, as suggested by its 9% abv, though pure alcohol qualities are minimized. Look for the apricot qualities to emerge as it warms, but classic aspects of the tripel style are never fully realized. The bottled beers of Cascade are always a tough buy, due to their high price tag, but time spent in the barrel is worth the extra cost due to the powerful and appealing oak qualities that are derived from it."
"Very nice Flanders Style Sour."
"Taste is apricots, it's earthy, mellow, very tart and sour, but still drinkable - there's an earthy quality that's unique and tasty. Mouthfeel is light and smooth crisp and delicious."
"Cascade Apricot is a solid sour that relies mostly on a sharp, lactic sourness and fruit flavors. I like it, and it was quite nice to drink."
"A great beer. Solid fruit flavour. Love it despite it not necessarily being the perfect example of the style."
"overall: great stuff"
"More strange medicinal notes on the palate. It tastes like fake apricot. Fruity and sour as expected, though it could've been even more sour. A little funky/musty/grassy and mildly oaky. Thin, crisp mouthfeel and high carbonation. Not as interesting as I had hoped unfortunately. Real good attempt for brewing this of a base Tripel, a little less ""good"" as a Fruit Lambic, but I consider this more of an American Wild Ale."
"Glowing yellow ornage in color with a solid lasting head and a trickle or two of lace. The fun starts with a simple smell of the beer; apricots! Sour! And the ecstasy continues into the taste, where there is a lot of awesome flavor to fit into the smorgasbord. Apricots all around, but it's not over the top, sour all around, but not over the top, acidic but not over the top, and even some complimentary lemon flavor. And then I learned it was 8.5% ABV, which is amazing considering that there is no harshness to be found. Without a doubt a treat and one of the best beers I've tasted in 2011."
"O - An excellent beer. In short... another home run for Cascade."
"Overall a stunning beer. Not the most crazy thing they make but consistent and very, very high quality."
"O: This is an excellent beer, awesome flavor, crisp and very refreshing during these summer months (not that Seattle got summer this year, still waiting for it...). The apricot is noticeable but subtle which is very nice. I don’t think it should dominate the palate. 4.5"
" This ale has a nice apricot taste, yet you get a true sense of the base beer with the malt flavor supporting very well. The taste has a semi-floral fruit tinge with some mellow candy and jammy flavors iwth light sour element in the background adding to the tangy mild and sweet essence. There is a slight tart flavor in the finish. Overall I loved this a great way to end the evening with a flavor that is both full and subtle where it counts -I would never have guessed this is 8%, it definitely has the balance of sweet and sour covered."
"D - very drinkable, I just can't get enough of this beer. I'd be interested in trying some other years to compare"
"Overall this is my first Cascade sour and I couldn't be happier with it; also my first apricot sour. Very enjoyable but just like all sours I will only really crave/want them on these crazy hot summer days when normal heavy beer is just undrinkable. Do I have to drink this again, no, but would I, definitely. Blows all that crap Lindemans brews way out of the water."
"Very well done. Alcohol is hidden almost entirely."
"A quite nice beer. A tame, gentle sour loaded with under ripe apricot juiciness. Cascade does not disappoint."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with a low to moderate amount of carbonation. I enjoyed the hell out of this beer, and would most definitely have it again. I would love to get hold of a bottle or two."
"The aroma was beautiful. Rich sour funkiness with huge touches of apricot mixed in. Light peppery and spice notes come through as it warms, but the sour funk was so hardcore. The flavor was puckeringly good. Rich apricot and apple vinegar sour notes are all over this one. As it warms like barrel notes, lots of spice and a long drawn out and very dry. Super drinkable and very refreshing, this was one of the best sours I have had."
"Taste is a truly refreshing bretty funky apricot ale. There is a nice complex body to it with sweet fruit flavors mixing with sour ale and a healthy dosing of pale malt flavors. Caramelized sugars also chime in in the background. For a Sour lambic, this is a really nice tasting high octane sour. I have a hard time letting the glass sit on the table as it is nice and refreshing on a hot summer night."
"Pours a orange hazy with yellow edges. A lot of nice white head. Looks pretty solid. Smells sour and tart. There is a nice citrusy fruit on the nose. Smells really great! Tastes nice and tart. The apricot comes through very strong. Very nice fruit presence. Nice level of carbonation. Overall very solid"
"Pop! Clear orange amber body with very thin white head. Nose is packed with citrus fruit notes. Lemon, lime zest, blood orange, a hit of funk and maybe a hint of red wine vinegar. As it warms there's fruit leathers too, like apricot of course and also something like Kool-aid mix. Palate is tart right off the bat. There's enough sweetness there to keep it from being straight up sour. Apricot dominates for sure with tangerine juice and orange pulp. A hint of wood smoke appears and then vanishes. Lemon meringue and key lime pies. Yum. Tart and delicious."
"O - Fantastic. Not a hint of alcohol. Full acidic sourness and apricot fruitiness. This is a brilliant brew! Thanks Todd!"
"Carbonation keeps it from too much heft on the palate in terms of mouthfeel and aftertaste. The slight wood finish to it is never soggy, its a dry one. Did I mention that the alcohol tastes nonexistant? Pricey at $20 a bottle. But thanks to jh1982 for bringing this to March Madness 2011. Hell of a time, we drank this one before the Marquette/Syracuse game, had me worried about drinking an orange beer that it would help the Orange. No such luck! Sweet Sixteen for Marquette!"
"Excellent balance. Dried apricot upfront. Then the sourness hits. Followed by musty barnyard funk. Delicious. Crisp in the end. So juicy and mouth watering. I have to have another sip. Perfect amount of carbonation for the style. Delicious. An excellent sour and my first apricot example. I want to buy a case!"
"2009 bottling, pours a cloudy amber with sunset orange hue. A heavy champagne style foam quickly builds and recedes just as fast. Nose is of sour funk, apricots, must and earth and a little spicy belgian yeast. Taste is a puckering citrus sour, stone fruits and a pleasant funk along with an unfortunate penny taste. Easy to drink and hides the abv well. Solid sour though not great."
"O: Although not as sour as I had hoped this was a true winner in my book. Super tasty sour. I need a case of this."
"2009 Vintage. Pours a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very strong with apricot and sour aromas. A lot of funk and oak as well. Nice acidic characteristics, as well as lemon and grassy aromas. Taste is initially tart with some acid and light balsamic vinegar flavor. Then I get some really heavy farmhouse/Belgian tripel flavors with pleasant apricot flavors. Finishes with some more sourness and a lot of French oak. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very dry and refreshing. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is very unique with it's Belgian-tripel characteristics. Not as sour as I thought it was going to be, but very well balanced and delicious."
"this beer pours a deep yellow color to almost orangish, with a nice off white yellowish head. the smell is funky with some decent sour notes. this beers taste is a little muted compared to the smell, i was expecting some more sourness and funkiness to it, there was a good bit of sourness, but not what i was expecting. the mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. overall a good beer, will seek it out again"
"2009 batch picked up at the barrel house. wow. this one totally took my palate and spun it out. super complex. sooo much palate pleasing stuff going on here and i am not a fan of apricot (?9 aversion east coast?). deep amber with an off-white-apricot-pink(?) head that pops and fizzes but settles in to a creamy thing that sticks around for a bit and leaves good lace. nose is fruity, and surprisingly, other fruits seem more pronounced than apricot. i get raspberry, pear, strawberry, tropical fruit, apricot. so much going on. fruit, spice, wood, tart, earth, vanilla(?), honey(?), citrus, old-school bubblegum... and layers of each. taste is sweet/sour and fruity up front, turns spicy, gets woody and finishes dry with a touch of minerality. medium body that seems creamy, but turns silky. clean with a warming finish that amplifies the aftertaste you wish it had. a stunning beer that defies style and boundary. would love to taste this in 5 years. winner."
"It's a little too sour to drink much of; it would probably leave you feeling like the time you were ten years old and your parents let you eat as much candy as you wanted. In smaller quantities though, this stuff is awesome. Thanks a ton Eric! This was my favorite brew from that particular session. I'd definitely pick this up if I ever run into it."
"D- very enjoyable. the subtle flavor of the apricot is very well integrated here. something id look for again, even with the pretty substantial price tag."
"I'm on a sour kick and this was on par with the 3F Oude Gueze I had yesterday. Yes, slightly different styles but overall the moral is the same. I could drink this all day, especially a day like today where spring is trying desperately to make headway. Cost and availability will limit this to an occasional treat."
"Nicely drinkable and strong but well harmonized flavors. Need more of this beer."
"Overall, a good beer that you may enjoy more than I did. Worth trying if you see it."
"D: The drinkability is really high for me on this one. The apricot is the star of the show, but it is not sweet at all. A pleasant sour funk helps pull the whole picture together. Well done."
"I went into this expecting an American Wild, not a Tripel. Therefore, this is a win."
"D: Tastes like....disappointment. Got this bottle in a trade and I'm totally happy to have tried it, but something has to be off with this bottle. I'll try it again in the future (hopefully with better results) if the opportunity presents itself."
"The beer pours a golden, honey orange color with good head retention and decent lacing. As one would expect, I pick up a considerable amount of apricot on the nose, along with some vanilla and light cherry. I really didn't pick up much of a sour component in the aroma profile, which made my first taste all that much more of a surprise. While not over the top, the sour aspect of this beer really dominates the flavor profile, though I pick up considerable apricot as well. There is also some light vanilla and lemom/lime as well that is intriguing and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, sour apricot finish. The sour component really seems to counter and lighten the alcohol impact on the finish, and once again I was surprised to learn that the abv. was 8.5%. Ultimately, drinkability is pretty good in this beer, though the sour wore on me a bit after a while. Nevertheless, I thought this another solid effort from the folks at Cascade."
"A really nice beer - Cascade seem to do some excellent stuff..."
"Great beer, in line with the others I've had from Cascade - need to seek out more!"
"Definitely drinkable; sour, but not too sour. Another great aged ale from Cascade."
"D: Really liked the nose on this one, and the flavor and drink ain't half bad either. Pretty great all around, can't wait to try more Cascade beers!"
"(750ml bottle from tai4ji2x!). Pours cloudy orange/apricot color with nice off-white head. Aroma is funky, ripe apricot, and so delicious. Taste is a sour, but not overly sour. There is the sweetness of the apricot there also. Medium bodied with a smooth finish. The carbonation is prickly. If you like sours and apricot, then you should like this beer. It's yummy."
"Again cascade has made an amazing beer. I love how the beer is sour yet you can still fully taste the sweet fruity flavor of apricot. Worth buying if you see it."
"The body was slightly over carbonated-- but just barely... Otherwise, this beer drank like a dream. Tasty, intense, and highly enjoyable. This is one of the best fruit sours I've ever had. (authors note-- we have a huuuuge fruit sour tasting coming soon, so that statement may not hold up after March...)"
"I love this beer and would buy this again and again."
"Nice sour. Straight great stuff."
"Overal impression: Another winner from the reigning king of American sours."
"D: More please, at 9% ... definitely more please."
"The carbonation is lively and enjoyable. The drinkability is relatively high for this style. The sourness is in the forefront, but well balanced with a sweet finish and other flavors to make this a really nice beverage."
"D - overall this is a good beer. Shared a 750 with a friend would like another."
"Medium bodied, a bit syrupy, but light and airy at the same time with the high carbonation..."
"Reviewed on 6/2/2010. 2009 bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet apricots, peach, sweet tart candies, light funk, lactic acid. Flavor is very sweet and tart (like the candies) with some sour apricot. The sour apricot really comes out in the finish. Overall, very drinkable and tasty, quite tart. Perhaps not as fruity as I would have hoped but one of the better fruity sour ales out there."
"D: Pretty good overall"
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright dark yellow color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of sour notes with light acidic notes with some light tart apricot notes. Taste is also a very nice mix between some light acidic notes with some tart and sour notes with lightly sweet notes of apricot. No notes of oak and apricot notes are very subtle. Very nice beer and drinkability is quite high with alcohol being well hidden."
"2009 from the bottle. This one could serve as a Flanders for aficionados or noobs. bright orange color. Aroma is more funk than fruit, however, neither is too strong. By style, expect more sour and fruit-forward but still a good beer nonetheless. Apricot is in the background here. easy-drinking."
"Bottle. I believe this is a 2009 bottle. Pours a clear golden honey color with a big fluffy white head that nicely laces as it settles. If memory serves me correctly I don't believe Cascade uses brett but this has an aroma of brett to it with florals and a touch of fruit. I expected this to have a more fruit forward aroma vs. the florals. Light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. The flavor is brett-like floral with touches of sweetness. The apricot doesn't seem to be as strong as I would have liked and the flavor seems almost watered down. Not bad but I thought this would have been better."
"D - I don't like this one as much as the Kriek, but it is still one of the better Wild/Sour brews available."
"D - An enjoyable and sophisticated sipper... Both challenging and intriguing to the senses... I seem to always want another sip before my glass even leaves my hand..."
"Pours a nice pale apricot color with a bit of a white head and some lacing. The nose is really quite tart with lactic sourness and a good dose of apricot and peach flavors. Some light green apple as well. The taste brings in a bit of oak and a really nice sour to fruit ratio. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both out of this world, as the fruit and sourness levels combine quite well. This is just short of the level where the sourness begins to affect drinkability. My favorite of their sours to date. I'm very, very glad they ship this out to Philly."
"Overall, I was expecting more from this, but I couldn't help but compare it to FouFoune. This beer just couldn't compete with Cantillon's apricot sour. It was still drinkable, however."
"Drinks: like every other Cascade I've had. They're good sours, to be sure, but never mind-blowing."
"The beer is well carbonated and has a nice light mouthfeel appropriate for the style. The alcohol is well hidden by the musty and sour flavors, this is one I will look for again in the future, glad this brewery is in New England."
"a gritty lambic that has the air of belgian beers made by american then aged to level out any inconsistencies. this brewer has experience. this a clean beer but not a lambic. too boozy. i can feel the triple in my teeth and throat. the apricot is wonderful though. sits and milds the acidic quality with some mealiness. has a malt finish that really makes the beer and provides a nice balance with the sour. making the sour not appear like a mask."
"For a soured tripel, I think the Vent D'Anges is a far superior beer."
"Very nice beer from Cascade. Recommended, especially if you're looking for a tasty refreshing beer on a hot day."
"After a while the apricot starts to take over the palette and it gets a bit too fruity and one dimensional for my taste. A 375ml would be perfect for this one."
"Drinkability: For an American interpretation of a Belgian style, this is absolutely fantastic. I have a feeling mine was a bit infected as, upon opening, it kept foaming over almost incessantly- the glass my girlfriend poured had no head while mine was thick. Still, being a sour style, this can stand up to that pretty well and still remains a very good brew."
"I could easily have two bombers of these. The alcohol is well hidden for a ~8.5 and its not too sour."
"very easy to drink would pair very well with stone fruit deserts."
"D: Highly palatable and highly drinkable. The Apricot Ale is almost too easy to drink."
"D - Excellent brew from Cascade."
"Overall I was a pretty big fan of this beer - it's not my favorite from Cascade but for a middle-of-the-road beer from a brewery they're doing pretty well. Worth a shot."
"This ale appears a hazy light yellow/orange hue. There is a small head that leaves a tiny amount of lacing on the glass. The aromas consist of funky brettanomyces, oak, and slightly sweet fruits (apricot). This beer has plenty of flavor. The wood is very noticeable in both the aroma and the taste. The beer is mostly sour, but does have a subtle sweet note in there as well. This is a really good beer. It's complex and the flavors are well-balanced. I'd like to have it again."
"pours a semi-transparent copper color with good white fizzy head and lacing that remain. strong wild yeast citrus, apricot smell. the nose on this brew is absolutely fantastic. apricot hints in the smell aren't too apparent but come through strong in the taste. very sweet and sour, a bit tart fruity and flavorful. absolutely fantastic. light to medium body long flavor duration and sweet tart finish. kind of reminds me of the candy smarties. i highly recomend trying this brew!"
"Pours a hazed golden oranage color with full cap of prickly white head, diminishes quickly but leaves great lacing. Scent is of lactic sourness, apricots, tangerine, grahmn cracker. Taste brings a nice sourness that is in great balance with the apricots, nice amounts of grahmn cracker with soft presence of vanilla and oak. Medium bodied, perfect level of carbonation, soft on the palate. An excellent sour from Cascade that lets the fruit shine through with a perfectly balanced level of sourness."
"D- I would have no issues drinking this all day!"
"D and overall impression: The only thing limiting the drinkability is the tartness, which dosen't bring the score down much. Overall, this is a great brew and one that I will be picking up often. Skal."
"Another great sour from Cascade; they're really putting out some stellar stuff. I look forward to trying several others while in Portland this week."
"Little bit of a gush on this one even after a chill. Pours nice after that with an orange yellow hugh and slight cloudy apperance. Crisp white head, lovely lacing. Aroma is blame! Appricots followed by clear lactic sourness. Flavor is of a nice golden ale base, apricots in the middle of the palate with a lactic sour finish. Only two things about the taste is a slight bit of diactyle and some astringency that I get on the finish. Crisp and sharp mouthfeel with a little more carb then i expected. Drinkable, but that diacytle and astringency is getting me."
"Drinkability - Quite so. For a Lambic/sour, this is quite enjoyable and at such a high ABV I can't taste even a hint of the alcohol. I am glad I opened this up tonight to enjoy on such a great, cool summer night in Southern California. Better than I expected, and I will pick this up if I run into it in the future. Can't wait to try the other Sour I picked up from Cascade."
"Drinkability: solid fruit beer and good beer for someone lookign to get into sours."
"I know I love a beer when I am already trying to figure out when to enjoy the next bottle. I just saw this at a store and I will have to pick up a couple more before this vintage vanishes. I look forward to trying this year's version. Great beer."
"D: Having had the Kriek as a comparison, Cascade's line of lambics are a simple, yet very well executed take on the style. Not too tart, not too fruity, with an overall well-balanced favor that won't offend many but won't impress the heck out of anyone either. Still, I'd never hesitate to reach for one of these. Good beer."
"this was amazing, blew away my expectations. flavors kept interest."
"D - Very, very drinkable. Not too sweet (especially considering the style), not too sour. Quite an interesting balance"
"J"
"Beer tastes great, very tart, nice acidity and good fruit flavors with a mild sweetness. Very tasty overall. The sourness is a little subtle but a great beer all around. Loved it."
"Pours a light, shimmering copper color with a light-tan head. Aroma is vivid, sweet, dried apricots. Pretty cut and dry there. Flavor is also apricot-dominated, with a bit of unripeness and a somewhat solvent acidity. Sweet at first but after the palate calibrates, the sharp tartness attacks the corners of the palate. Not terribly sour. Pretty good, the fruit is really bright and fresh-tasting."
"Pours a nice amber color, surprisingly clear, with a huge sticky head. The bubbles are massive and loose and leave cobwebbed lacing a the start, then the head fades just a bit to a ring, and leaves tighter clumps of bubbles. Looks good, darker than I expected, I guess. The smell is slightly tart, pretty fruity, like peaches and some tart berries. It smells pretty sweet. Also, you can sense the funkiness of this one there too. I'd say it's not the best smelling lambic, but all of the elements are there. The flavor comes out with fruit, like fleshy, soft, juicy fruit. The beer is fairly sweetn, not too tart at all, and the apricots kind of win in the fruitiness, but I can also detect berries. I can kind of taste the malt, but mixed with the yeast character, it just comes across as straw and grass. I also get a little peach alcohol taste. After the fruit, and as it warms, you start to get the wildness of this one, and I don't think it is the most successfully developed wild ale. There's just this B.O. and foot funkiness, that didn't seem to get to the point of the acidic bacteria coming in, so there's very little acid or dryness to balance out this thick sweetness in this one. These are definitely characteristics of wild ales, kind of normal ones, but it's too one dimensional, and a little like fruity sweat, if that at all makes sense. The body is nice and full, with a moderate carbonation, but it's not as dry, and maybe a little too full for a good lambic. And I got a little bored of it while I was drinking. I think it could use a little more tartness and acidity, maybe a little longer conditioning to really let those flavors develop more (or maybe it went too long and the bacteria started eating the wrong stuff, sometimes I can't tell the difference - or maybe I don't know it well enough). The fruit would be nice in a more ""sour"" tasting beer, it has a very nice effect."
"Analysis aside, my overall opinion is mmm!"
"2009 750ml bottle thanks to SincereNC. Cloudy orange, almost brown. Smells quite interesting, sour yet not so fruity, not much funk either. The flavor was odd, slightly sour, slightly sweet, almost like a sweet and sour apricot candy but the apricot flavors were very, very subtle to me. At one point I thought it was a sweet pixie stick. I'd be interested to try their other bers but at $22 this would never get a repeat purchase from me. At $15 I could see myself buying this with some regularity. Craft beer prices have gotten a little too out of control these days when they are charging more than Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen for sours."
"A great offering from cascade, probably my favorite beer ive tried from them."
"Slightly funky, dry tart medium body that's on the lighter end of the spectrum. Slightly vinegary and mouth puckering without being acidic at all. The lacto presence from the aroma is very prominent and give the mouthfeel a smooth creamy character. Lots of earthy oak tannis from the barrel aging that gives off some vanilla flavor. Dry bretty effervescence balanced b a very prominent juicy apricot flavor. Extremely quaffable and the high ABV id undetectable. Again, as in the aroma, there is a nice authentic funkiness that adds to the flavor and complexity of an already excellent beer. Recommended!"
"2009 vintage. The beer pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is strong apricot. The flavor is heavy on the apricots with some light tartness. The beer is semi-dry and retains a little of the sweetness from the fruit. Very drinkable. High carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"D - Surprised this is over 8% abv. For that reason it is pretty drinkable, but the syrupy sweetness keeps it from getting super drinkable."
"A very light feel, easy to drink but kinda blah that wouldn't make me want to drink much."
"D: The bottle said 9%, this feels nowhere near it. Dangerously drinkable for its ABV, a damn good fruit beer."
"D: I always enjoy cascade beers and this one is no exception. Glad that I've been able to try this brew a couple times."
"Flavor is awesome! Apricot sweetness there but mild. A great tart and funk controls the majority of the taste. High carbonation but perfect and complimenting. Oak and small notes of vinegar...and dry finish. Light and extremely crisp mouthfeel/body. This is a great drinker! Final thought: an awesome beer from Cascade!"
"I like it, but it's so incredibly bright and sweet that it's like drinking liquid candy, and at 750 ml., all to myself tonight, I can't rate drinkability that high. Doubt I'll even get through the bottle. But I love it big and extreme and alcoholic, so I do enjoy it, and can confidently say this lambic will never be mistaken as a ""girly beer," as some lambics unfortunately are."
"At 20 bones a bottle, I was not sure about buying this unknown beer. Glad I did. Nice pour with suitable creamy head, leaving slight lacing. Dark honey in color. Smell is tart apricots. Taste is magnificently mellowed. The funk of a wild beer, the lactic taste of a flanders, and the alcolhol is never noticeable. Balance is the key here. Sweetness, tartness, and funk are all present, but none are dominanat - none. That is amazing. Mouthfeel is great, and drinkablity follows suite. I will be stocking up on these next week, and trying their Kriek. Best new beer of the month for me."
"750 mL bottle (2008 vintage cork and caged, tasted on 11/25/09). Served at 48 deg. Pours a light clear orange/golden. Huge bubbly white head that fades quickly. Aroma of peach and citrus, touch of some floral hops and vanilla bread. Incredibly dry taste, with very little residual sugar. Just a touch of sweetness with a belgian yeast flavor, then a pleasant mild sourness, but not as tart as expected. Drinks incredibly well and I cannot believe this is 9% (as labeled on bottle) for such a nice light bodied brew. Yet another fantastic beer from Cascade."
"D: The Cascade sours are delicious as a rule, and this one is no exception. A fantastic beer and I'm glad I have some more at home."
"Cloudy golden amber color with a thin fizzy off white head that has nice retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is exceptional punch of brett funk and apricot sweetness, lemon, fresh grass, etc. Medium bodied with strong, fine carbonation. Flavor is pleasant balance of earthy funkiness and sweet and tart apricot. Very unique and very drinkable."
"D: I like this. I expected more vinegar from a Flanders style sour, and I'm glad that's not the case here (I'm getting less impressed with acetic flavors these days). This is a clean, pure sour that delivers the flavors well. At $20 it's a little steep, but it's not a ways off from Russian River stuff. I'd buy it again."
"This was certainly a flavorful beverage that stayed true to its name. This will surely please any fan of the style. Thanks again Brad!"
"All of that said, this isn't bad by a stretch. It doesn't fit my conception of what a lambic should be, but it isn't too bad as a slightly sour apricot flavored belgian. With the high alcohol content (bottle says 9%) it might age well, and I believe that the sour might grow a little more complex. If I ever come across it again I might give that a shot."
"D: This is going to be no problem to kill. If you like Apricots, this is your beer. So . . . it is my beer. The apricot is just so well translated in aroma and flavor. Its crazy. ABV and feel doesn't hurt at all. Just so easy to drink and just fantastic. You can tell a lot of love went into this beer and it is much appreciated to this Alabama beer lover. Lives up to the Cascade hype and then some. Awesome. Simply awesome."
"d - Overall this was a very interesting and enjoyable lambic. I thought the smell was amazinf and the taste pretty good. I thought it would be a little less bitter and am not sure if I could drink a whole one without sharing, but I was very glad I got to try it and enjoyed it."
"delightful beer. this would be amazing for sitting on the porch in the dead of summer. extremely refreshing."
"What an amazing beer! This is the 2008 vintage at 9% abv. Slightly murky orngein color wih a very nice mousse-like head that leaves some lacing. Wonderful aromas of crushed ripe apricots with some tannic notes from the skins. Similar depth of flavor in the mouth, with vibrant ripe apricot,tnnin from the skins, a deep background bitternes, and a lactic tartness throuhout. Wonefuly balnced, quenching and evocative of a summers day. Fairly tart and lactic in the mouth, this is just deligtful all around."
"Overall, an impressive offering from Cascade."
"This one works. It works slowly, but it works. Just what I was in the mood for...something less dry than Brute yet less beefy than the bottle of Consecration I have downstairs."
"D - Pretty good for a sour beer. Kept wanting more."
"D) Could drink this all night even with high alch percentage, but a bit expensive. great gateway mild sour lambic."
"D: No hint of the 9% at all. I have drank a few of their beers now and either they are lying or masters of making super drinkable big beers."
"The apricots can be a bit much after a while, but very good. Nice zesty mouthfeel."
"- Other than being a bit bubbly like a sparkling wine (as it should for the style) its very drinkable, and I downed the whole bottle... very good."
"D: Good, enjoyed sipping on this one while watching the NASCAR. Who says NASCAR and sour does not mix?"
"750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased over the phone from the brewery about a year ago, had this along with the Kriek, Cuvee, and Blackberry with four friends a few nights ago, reviewed from notes, poured into a snifter, color is a deep golden orange, ¾ inch bubbly white head, good retention, some lacing at first, aroma consists of apricot, oranges, peaches, lacto, sweet malt, tartiness, oak, and sugar, flavor begins with a nice dry apricot flavor, sour and sweet in the middle, marmalade-like at times, finish has a big lacto character along with an astringent finish, warms up with more fruit coming to the surface, also a big citrus component here, sour and sweet mouthfeel, medium bodied, nice carbonation, could drink this whole bottle easily and actually have of the previous year's vintage a few months ago, smooth and no alcohol present even though it packs a pretty good punch for a sour, will drink again, recommended"
"The beer is quite dry, pretty light bodied, definitely tart and has a nice aromatic-flavor of apricots; the apricot character is fleshy, almost juicy in quality. This finishes with some phenolic notes in the finish that adds a light, biting sharpness and there is also a bit of astringency. The phenolics contribute a mix of notes of curing plastic and a pale smokiness, though these are kept fairly muted. This is quite drinkable and really hides its alcohol quite well, I wouldn't have guessed that the base beer, before souring and fruit, was a Tripel. It could use a bit more complexity to be truly great, but it is quite drinkable and tasty."
"The beer is light bodied and light on the tongue, with an enjoyable high level of carbonation. Though there is a little lactic character and a little tartness, I'd call this a fruit ale rather than a wild ale. If you open it thinking ""wild"" I think you'll be disappointed by how tame the beer is, but it's a quality fruit beer for sure. It's subtle and authentic, like all of Cascade's stuff."
"This is a extreme beer. Not for everyone. If you are into sours however I would highly reccomend this one. It's a really good American take on a sour beer. Perhaps one of the best I have had."
"D- A bit of a sipper, considering how sour it is, but overall very good. I think it may have been ""sour for the sake of being sour", but I still really enjoyed it."
"Wowza, this ones tasting super fresh and very tart. Incredibly quenching and sharp with loads of apricot. Maybe a bit more funk and sourness would be nice but a great beer nonetheless."
"This beer pours a clear honey colored with a one finger off-white head. Nice head retention - certainly more than I had anticipated in a lambic. Nose is drenched in apricot with a bit of a boozy smell, and the sourness definitely comes through. Taste is apricot mixed with a sourness that balances well. Nose would lead you to believe that the taste would be much more sweet. There is a pretty sweet finish to this, but doesn't leve much of an aftertaste. Mouthfeel is reminiscent of wine, but the carbonation in here definitely gives you the beer feel. VERY dry finish, and I liked it for this beer. This is an outstanding fruit beer. Not my style to sit with for an evening - but definitely one that could be enjoyed with friends."
"Thanks for sharing this one, Arne. 750ml bottle into a couple of pint glasses. Straw-colored with good clarity, for the first pour at least, with a small 1 finger head that dissipated pretty quickly. Big fruity aroma with a touch of musty barrel beneath. There isn't much tripel character left in the aroma beyond the faintest hint of pale malt. Nicely balanced on the palate; not bracingly sour by any means. Light lemony tartness, just a hint of funk. Dry and grainy, big apricot flavor minus the sweetness. Little bit of cardboard-like oxidation in the finish. Great stuff; it lands somewhere between a standard fruit beer and a wild ale."
"Hugely interesting.. and the backbone beer actually shows through with the triple maltiness.. and helps everything tie together quite well."
"soured belgian tripel aged with fresh apricots. golden, crystalline, a joy to the eye. the nose on this beer is pure fruit.. and the way the wild yeast grips the flavors of the tripel.. this is really puckering. less lactic, more fou-foune-y. the beer was rather high gravity to start, and that adds a real pleasant sipping aspect to the experience. most big sours ive had carry some excess sweetness, not this one. balanced for a fruit beer, consumer must love apricots."
"D- Rivals and dominates any fruit beer I have ever enjoyed. This beer demands respect and it is well deserved. Opening a bottle of this on a summers evening is nirvana."
"Drinkability: The flavor profile is compelling; with bit more carbonation, this would be extraordinary"
"Cascade Apricot is a simple and momentarily elegant ale though it is somehow incomplete without a more fully expressed measure of fruit flavor. Give it some warming and a wishful hint of apricot does emerge."
"A highly drinkable beer, bought a bottle after drinking this at the lodge and I am looking very forward to drinking this later (hopefully it will last a while in the 'cellar'<-fridge)!!"
"Drinkability is pretty high for me, this is a suitable champange substitute that even my non-beer drinking wife has indulged me with a glass or two. The booze is a bit heavy in the belly though, with a bit of a solevent feel cutting through the sourness, which, coupled with the high price, limits me to one bottle at a time. Still, as they suggest on the bottle, I've had a lot of trouble holding onto these to age. I think this is probably my fourth bottle, great to share with my wino friends to show them how diverse the beer world can be! I thought this was my favorite of the 3 they've recently released, although the Kriek I had yesterday slightly edged it out score wise, mainly due to the lower ABV/sugar/body. I still really love this one!"
