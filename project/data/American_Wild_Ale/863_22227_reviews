"Muddy rose in color (amber-pink) with a thin white head and clumps of yeast at the bottom of glass even with a fairly careful pour.  It has the awesome, tangy aroma you'd expect from the style, with sour apple notes and other subtle fruity notes, including cherry and plum.  Tartness and the fruit alike continue over into the taste, but there's more sweetness and blended smoothness than many other sours.  There's some carbonation and syrup in the mouthfeel, but it comes off lighter than many of its peers.  It's a great beer."

"375ml batch 04X1. This might just be my favorite sour by RR. This sour solder is orange/amber in color with a small head. The old cake whole is inundated with tart and sour cherries, light fruit, oak, funk, and brett."

"Another great offering from Russian river!  Thanks to my buddy Zach for tracking this one down!"

"A nearly flawless beer.  One of the sours I judge all others against."

"Takes over the title of ""champagne of beers."""

"A delicious sour. Look beautiful copper. Smell of cherries and pinot noir. Taste of cherries and delicious sours. A very pricey beer but worth it one of the best sours I've tasted."
""
""
""
"I love sours.  This is the best sour I've ever had."
""
""
"O: Beautiful to look at, inviting aroma, complex flavors that unfold slowly, but never fight for their place as they move across the palate, all while remaining smooth and silky. The best sour for me thus far."
""

""

"Has an unusual sweet taste for a sour beer, based on its malt and ripe fruit foundation, accompanied by matured, wine soaked chunks of wood, topped with a hint of vanilla. Lactic sourness rises from the fruitiness, giving the cherries a powerful, pleasant character, hovering above musty malts and oak. Acidity then blends outstandingly well into the cherry flavor, adding a vinous note to it without becoming too sour, accentuating the rich fruitiness, balanced by the earth and leather. The beer finishes pleasantly dry nontheless, supported by a vivid carbonation, with cherryskin, toasty stone fruit pits, a vinous tang and tooth quenching sourness, still leaving enough space for rejuvenating cherry qualities."
"One of the best sours around."

"This is the bombest sour ever"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Sharp acidity hits first bam! then an incredible sourness hits the back of the throat BAM. Second sip is better as the mouth adjusts, subtly cherry comes out, sour cherry, white grapes? Lots of funk."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As I said before this is a perfect beer in every way. I am truly surprised. I want more and hope I can obtain many more, I have to be able to share this one with friends, its too good to have all to myself! Thanks man for the trade, truly incredible experience!"

"My buddy came back from Cali with a 3 litre bottle of this from the brewpup. It was a celebration to have this beer in the midwest. good sour flavor. I really enjoyed popping the cork on such a large bottle...it felt like being in the winner circle after an F1 race win!"

"Unsurprisingly, a really well-executed effort by Russian River, and just the sort of sour even those who aren't sour fans would love.  Meanwhile, as an inveterate sour fan, I would've loved to consume a lot more than the (approximately) six-ounce servings poured at Toronado's bar."

"I can't say I agree with the consensus that this is the best sour from Russian River.  It is very, very good, but I would rate Consecration, Temptation, and Sanctification all above this one."

"O: 4.5 This beer is an excellent example of what fruited sours can be. It carefully walks the line between funk, sour, fruit, and sweet with no single element dominating. While super drinkable, there are enough of interesting flavors and aromas to keep things lively."

"My favorite RR sour to date.  So good, plenty tart but with tons of depth.  Loved the cherries."
""
""
""
"Definitely a world class sour.  A nice balance of horse blanket funk, sweetness from the cherries, dryness from the Pinor Noir and sourness.  Can't go wrong with this one.  I wish I had several more so I could age a few in the cellar."

"Re-rating this because the first time i had it was only a 3 oz pour. Managed to enjoy a whole bottle with a buddy. This beer is the closest thing to perfect you can get. The smoothest and tastiest sour i've ever had."

"D: Exemplary to the style with layers of great flavor going on and a very controlled amount of funkiness. RRBC has such great balance in their brews while still delivering brilliant flavors. I found the Consecration to be a bit bolder but I can see Supp as much easier to drink and therefore held in higher regard. Surely recommended for those looking for a great Wild."

"Ruby red over brownish hues with a tan head that goes quickly. Minimal lacing with big sediment at the bottom. Tart cherries, Pinot noir wine and oak notes in the nose. Big tart cherry flavor supported by wine like qualities cloaked in oaky notes in the background. Tartness is cut toward the end by the malt backbone, making it sour and funky but reeling it in before it gets too far out of line. Puckering and tart with vibrant carbonation and a bone dry finish. A sipper for sure and a fantastically different beer."

"Overall: An outstanding AWA from Russian River. Nice juicy almost Kriek like cherries, and acetic short sharp shock with lost of remaining wine from the barrels in the middle. The musky jock strap Brett on the way down and the lactic acid tang complete the package. Really an outstanding sour ale from Russian River."
""
""

"O- This seems to be Consecration's little brother. A little lighter, a little lower ABV, a little less tangy. But a very great beer."

"Pours pretty dark brown, aggressive pour gives about 1 finger of head that is reduced to a film in under a minute but maintains around edges of glass. Smell is tart cherry, and some woodiness. Taste is sour cherry, cranberry, some grassy funk, definite barrel notes. As it warms some bready malts appear. Pretty full bodied in my opinion, tons of carbonation, maybe too much for me, sourness really sticks around for a while on the palate. Overall one of my favorite sours, glad I got my hands on some recently so I could put up a review on this great beer from RR."

"Right, tell you why I like the beer: it's simply one of the best examples of a barrel aged sour beer that exists. The flavor is slightly fruity, puckery, and has these amazing layers that just keep coming. It's one of the best beers that I ever had. I disconnected my analytical beer drinking side, sat, and sipped thinking, ""oh god"" over and over. Not many beers allow me to do that."

""
""
""

""
"Pours a dark beer with a reddish tint. Little bit of bubbles. Smell is glorious, typical sour. Taste is very good. I thought that I couldn't drink this by myself, but I totally can. It is not overly sour that makes your stomach burn. It is well balanced. Some traces of grapes."

"What a great beer with a medium rare steak. Made me feel as if I was drinking a $50 bottle of wine. Oak aged, great bitterness, just super well rounded. What a treat! Just wish I could get this regularly. Wife was super impressed and asked why we can't get this here. Russian River beers are top of the line."
""
""
""
""
"This is among the best sours I've encountered. Not overwhelming tart. Delicious cherry and Pinot noir accents."
"Poured a rich, semi-cloudy orange-brown, with two and a half fingers of fluffy white head that receded very slowly. No lacing. A very nice looking sour. Scents of sour brett yeast, oak, sour cherries, tart wild yeast funk, hints of lemon juice and a bit of overripe stone fruit in the background. A very nice aroma, rich, funky, wild and complex with a nice fruity character present as well. Flavor begins very sour, with notes of sour cherry and hints of cranberry and red wine. This moves into further sour flavors of cranberry, raspberry and cherry with notes of oak and red wine-like tannins. Finish continues to be quite tart and dry, with more abundant oak flavors, sour cranberry, raspberry and cherry and some sour, tannin-like astringency. Aftertaste is sour and dry with notes of cranberry, sour cherry and raspberry, alongside some oak. A very well done flavor profile. Dry and puckering, quite sour, but after the manner of sour red fruit and not vinegar or citrus. It has a depth and complexity to it, with fruitiness and oak helping to keep things balanced beneath the sourness. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a puckering, drying feel. Extremely nice, refreshing, yet also encouraging you to sip. The mouthfeel compliments the flavor profile nicely. Overall this is an excellent sour. It has a wonderful wild, sour, slightly fruity aroma, an excellent sour, fruity and complex flavor profile and mouthfeel that aids both the flavor of the beer and the drinking experience. Very well executed and quite a treat. Bottled on April 11th, 2013 and consumed on May 31, 2014."

"O: A great beer for sure but my expectations where a little high and was slightly let down. Don't get me wrong, its an amazing brew and definitely a must have by RR but maybe I'll give it another shot with some age."

"O - my first time trying Supplication and I really wanted to try it ""fresh"". Not sure how it will age but the cherries just come blasting through. From my limited experience, this doesn't quite drink like a traditional kriek. It seemingly has its own identity that simply relies on cherries (as well as the funky bacteria, oak, Pinot). So distinct and special."

"Pours an amber color. Not much head, just fizzy bubbles. Visible carbonation. Smell isn't overwhelming. Slight cherry, sour, oak, wine. Mostly just tart cherry skin. Taste is very tart, cherry skin, oak, lemon. Nice carbonation, quite fizzy. Medium bodied. Very nice. A great sipper given the tart and fizzy nature."

"I love this beer. I don't live in the area so I can't do a proper review of this beer, but I just want to add the praise that this beer deserves. It is so good. I will drive out of my way to visit the brew pub in Santa Rosa. The Russian River beers are outstanding and this is no exception."

"Overall, pretty much the best sour beer I have had. The appearance is nothing to behold, but the balance in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel is something to behold. While many sours may pound you with severe dryness, achieving great flavor but with severe detriment to your palate over the course of consumption, this ale strikes a perfect balance, never going to far either way. It utilizes a myriad of flavors from many parts of the process and creates one hell of a flavorful beer. This beer absolutely lives up to the hype."

"This is an amazing beer, no doubt about it. There are a number of flavors that intertwine and last forever, helped along by perfect carbonation. This is a beer that goes down easy yet it has so much going on. My only complaint is that it has a little too much pinot grape influence for my taste. I wish the cherries had shown through more than the grape did. Nevertheless, I still love this beer and highly recommend it."

"Great look upon first pour - a dark amber/red. I am a newbie when it comes to wild ales aged with sour cherries in pinot noir bottles. However, this is the second time I have drank this beer and it is pretty damn good. Especially becuase I prefer IPA's and Stouts. Aroma is sour pinot noir, funk and cherries. Taste is might good with some sour, pinot, yeast, cherries and a hint of vanilla. Quite delicious and well balanced."

"new style for me really, haven't had many sour beers. this thing really spoke to me. lot of sour cherry. aroma had sort of a funky note but it wasn't offensive. it wasn't a particularly fruity or tart smelling beer. only had a 6 oz glass and wanted t much more"

"On-tap at City Beer Store (SF), had many times before on-tap and bottle. Far and away my favorite RR sour. Supplication pours a dark opaque red. There is minimal carbonation and almost no lacing. The smell is strong - mainly sour cherries, but the red wine barrel is there too. The taste is brilliant - such well balanced fruit and tartness. Despite the tartness, I could (and have) drink this beer several times over. As I said, definitely my favorite RR sour, my favorite American Wild, and certainly in my top 5 of any beer"
""
"O - I am not an expert on this style but I don't know how this could be better. This is why RR is on that elite level. And this is why American craft can accomplish anything when craftsmen brew this quality of beer. Just a wow moment drinking this one."

"Bottle from the brewpub itself, dated 1/7/14. Pours a dark red color, somewhat opaque, with a one finger off white head on top. Aroma of sour cherries, vinegar, vinous grape notes. Very nice. Flavor is a medley of sour cherries and vinegar first, but with some beautiful oak and vinous notes that give this a huge punch of flavor and depth. Lots of bretty funk and big lacto bite. The wine notes continue to emerge as it warms. Some nice sweetness that balances out the sour beautifully. Full bodied for a sour brew, with lots of carbonation. A top rated beer for good reason. This is honestly one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Truly exceptional among sour beers. Maybe not quite Rodenbach Grand Cru, but then again I could see myself drinking this more readily than that. Undoubtedly top tier."
""
""
"All I have to say is Those Cherries. Awesome Beer! The sweet/sour tartness this beer delivers from the interplay of pinot and cherry is something that remains within my palate memory as a top 5 all time beer flavor. Thats not even mentioning the beautiful appearance (the light rose fluffy 2 finger head and hazy reddish amber beer hue)"

"Great beer very complex both in the aroma and the flavor. The aroma is cherry with some brett spiciness that is much more subdued in the flavor of the beer. The beer had lots of carbonation but not as much as champagne. The beer was dry with some sweetness and lots of fruit flavor with cherry being the dominant fruit flavor. The beer was sour but it was not overwhelming. The beer finishes tart with a slight bitterness. The beer had a ruby red/ caramel color to it. I was very impressed with this beer and I really enjoyed it."

"Part of a special ""barrel"" week at The Beer Junction. $4 for a 4oz pour, 7% ABV. Rich, red-copper color. Tremendous lace sticking to the glass. Aroma was a bit sour and unfortunately, I think I was picking up hints of the sanitation in the glass. Flavor had a mild puckering tang, no hop bitterness and not too sweet. Carbonation was average and viscosity was above average. Delicious aftertaste. This was worth the price for a special treat."
""
""
""
""
"O- Some American sours I've had don't deliver on the funk and sourness but this one certainly does. This is one of the best examples of a sour beer I've had. The fruit is there as a support to the funk and sour. It is definitely a sipper of a beer but for all the right reasons. Certainly a beer to seek out if you love sour beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But the sour cherry flavor makes it my favorite beer by far. I live near RRB and probably drink one 375ML bottle of this beer every week. I don't even care that it costs ~$13. It is worth it."
""
""
""
""

"O. This lives up to the hype. I would go to great lengths for this again. It's way sour but in an excellent way. Super clean. One of the best sours brewed in the U.S."

"Rusty, oxidized brown in color. Cherry, oak and funk on the nose. Baby apple skins. Cherries and a nice bit of backbone from the Pinot Noir barrels. There's a hint of pencil eraser on the finish. A pleasant bit of funkiness and a phenomenal sour. Among the best."

"Thanks Chris for grabbing this on the way through Colorado Spings. Poured a dark amber a bit red. Lots of bubbles. Khaki head very creamy but fades quickly no lacing. Smell is fairly one dimensional and potent it's advertising the presence of sour cherries. Taste is all about cherries and currants it's sour but not puckeringly aggressive. There is a bit of sweetness and acid reminiscent of raspberries. A light dose of funk but thankfully not over the top and it works well here. Medium light body and brightly carbonated. Finish is cherry, tart, and dry. Definitely shows off the Pinot barrel aging. Very good."

"O: Seriously sour, I actually think this was more sour than beatification. Or maybe it's just the wine adding more layers of tartness that amplify the sour cherries. I'm not sure. Strongest/sourest cherry flavor in a beer I've ever had. A little over the top for me, but obviously well crafted. Big and bright flavors for sure. Barrel aging isn't over the top and adds quite a bit of complexity. I'm not a big fan of wine or wine barrel beers so my subjectivity is showing with my scores. It's a good beer but just not up my alley, I think."

"One of the best sours out there. Great beer. Temptation is my favorite of the line but this one is very amazing. Perfect sour with a little bit of funk like the old world sours. To many of the American sours are just sour and miss a lot of the funky barnyard flavor that a sour should have. If this beer is ever available. Don't think twice."

"Pours a copper color with some floaties and a minimal white head. Smell is tart cherries, oak and a little Pinot. Taste is tart cherries and raspberries, I get a little bit of Pinot and oak. Not as tart as I expected. Medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation and a little dry. Overall it is very good, I just expected a little more due to its current ranking."

"O: Awesome beer, glad I got to try it."
""
""

"Supplication is a good - maybe great - sour. But when measured against its reputation, the bottle I had fell short. To that end, it reminds me alot of Pliny - a very well-regarded beer surpassed by other beers in the same genre but still highly regarded based on name recognition. For sour-heads, this bottle is a must-try simply based on what it is. But for my money, there are better sours out there."

"O – This is a fantastic beer and a great sour. It’s extraordinarily drinkable for a sour beer at nearly 8% ABV, I think due to the sweeter elements that balance out the sour ones. It’s very complex but very approachable at the same time. By that I mean that there are aromas and flavors that scream out at you but there are also layers upon layers of other aromas and flavors if you keep digging. Really my only complaint as others have said is that I wish it was in a bigger bottle so I could have more. The price is a little tough, too, especially for a bottle this size, but it really is a fantastic beer. Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this one, Jared!"

"Deep copper in color with a thin, cream-colored, head, this had a softer nose than I expected; subdued scents of cherries and grapes, with a little bit of oak. On my initial taste the beer is only moderately tart, and flavors include cherries, grape must, and fresh blackberries from early in the season; it finishes dry with traces of oak. Hardly any sweetness at all. The carbonation I do sense quickly dissipates. Nearly as good as the bottle I remembered..."

"O- I picked this one up from a Denver liquor store, and I had to ask for Russian River products, which they had stashed in the back. Now I know why. I wasn't disappointed.

"A: Nice rusty gold in color, finger of foam off a hard pour that dropped relatively quickly, some visible sediment – 4.50, S: Cherries are very evident on the nose, soft tartness comes through as well, pinot noir is present but doesn’t dominate – 4.50, T: Quite tart, sour cherries, not the normal brett beer I’m accustomed to, woodiness is subtle, pretty dry, faint hops deep in the body, cider vinegar – 4.50, M: Mildly puckering and with a tannic dryness – 3.75, D: Hands down one of the better wild ales I’ve tasted, seek this beer out – 4.25"

"Aw yea, straight deliciousness right here. Poured a deep ruby with a frothly head that subsided quickly. Smells of fruity cherries, barnyard/hay, funk, and tart cherries. Taste shines right with the smell with a glorious burst of dark cherry, morphing into tart cherry, then transforming into a beautiful barnyard funk, with some horseblanket and hay, followed by wet dirt (think moist turned up soil), and light lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is spot on, bracing carbonation that carries the flavors around without being too abrasive. Must buy, must try for the sour fan."

"Brownish red colour, ring of off white head, not much in the way of lace. Smell is Full of cherry and oak, funky, tart acidity, fruity and some light balsamic with only a little bit of sweetness. Taste is funky, lots of tart cherry flavours, fairly big puckering sourness to it, oak and wine flavours, more cherry in the aftertaste. Medium high carbonation, medium body. Just fantastic, no trace of alcohol at all, just a straight up excellent sour, 375ml is too easy to drink."

Even my wife, who is much more a vinophile than I am, smelled it, she was impressed. Combine that with a phenomenal sour ale, and you've got a sure winner. Absolutely phenomenal, perfect beer. If I could find a stock of this, I'd buy everything they had."
""
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the beer was a deep magenta color with a slight bubbly white head. The aroma, best described as a flowery cherry aroma, was enchanting. In the initial taste, one detects notes of tart and sour cherry, grape skin, sour grapes, sour fruit, and a hint of vanilla from the barrel aging. The vanilla notes come to the front more as the beer progresses toward the aftertaste. The pleasantly acidic mouthfeel is allowed to linger momentarily as the ale's thickness lingers on the back of the tongue. I could easily drink this sour before any other. I like it a lot."
"Though listed as a wild ale, I'll go out on a limb and say that this is what every sour should aim for in terms of profile. It pours a burned red-orange to pink with some lacing. The aroma is out of this world. There are definite hints of cherry and pinot noir as advertised, but I also pick up a hint of eggnog, oddly enough. The taste follows the aroma. There's a definite mouth-puckering cherry tartness that quickly fades to a dry, clean finish. The sourness is very pronounced, and I think it may mask other flavors that are present. Nevertheless, this is one of the best sours I've ever had."

"Overall: What nice intro to wild ales. Definitely one of my top beers I have tasted so far. I will return! Glad I forked out the money for this masterpiece of a brewsky."
"pours light red with minimal head. Smells like red wine light slightly tart smelling. Taste is dominated by a tart bite that mellows to a nice cherry oak aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is there but very soft. Overall this beer is amazing, so well balanced and dangerously drinkable."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. Before you even have this guy it does a really, really good job of raising your expectations. Now, often this can lead to one being let down or disappointed, but here you are left feeling neither. Each flavor that you expect is swaddled beautifully in a blanket of soured yeastiness, bacterial infection, and solid base sweetness. The fruity bite adds to both the sweet and sour side of things, while the pinot noir woodiness adds not only flavoring, but helps to fix the mouth in a persistent, but happy, pucker. The ultimate blend is truly wonderful in its simplistic complexity."
""
""
""
""

""

"D/O: One of Russian River's signature wine barrel-aged wild ales, Supplication excels at finding the happy medium between the golden Temptation and the high gravity Consecration. While the former is overtly wine-affected and the latter is challenging for almost any palate, this is just right. It successfully captures the mood of an authentic Belgian Kriek, at times comparable to lambics and Flanders-style ales. It deserves to be held up as one of the superlative examples of why Russian River beer is so good."

"O – This is a beautiful beer – brilliant complexity and balance in both the smell and the taste. This was my first Russian River sour – I hope the others are on the same tier because I will most certainly be seeking them out now."
"Wow, yet another fantastic Russian River sour. Drinkable beyond belief, as long as you don't mind a stomach ulcer or two. I'd put this one right around the middle of the pack of their regular line-up of sours (which is saying quite a bit, because even the bottom ones in my opinion are still damn good). I prefer this to Consecration and Sanctification, it's a bit more complex and has a better balance of tart and funk. All these sours make me upset that I don't receive Russian River distribution."

"O: Wonderful. This is a perfect wild ale for cherry and/or sour fans. There is a ton of fruit flavor and a good bit of mellowing oak sensibilities. I don't get a lot of brett out of this beer, but the lacto is quick intense. I prefer some of the other Russian River sours to this (not a big cherry fan) but it's undeniable that this is a world class wild. It's a sipper for sure, and I'd be through the roof to have a few more bottles of this in the future."

""

"Overall: I'm amazed at how good this beer is. It disappeared so quickly- it's that easy to drink and appreciate. Smells great, tastes great and overall deserves its reputation as probably the best AWA out there. Sour as hell yet has its sweetness that makes it an incredible sensory experience. If you hate sours, you should still try this beer. If you love sours, chances are you've already had this beer. So I don't know if my review will contribute anything to this site, except to show how much I love drinking this Russian River brew. World class stuff. (4.5)"

"there's a tingly kind of small-bubble carbonation and overall i really really like this brew. i dont want to abuse the 'straight 5' review and i dont want to be intimidated by the super high price i had to pay to try this brew, but i honestly feel it is worthy of 5s across the panel. for me, as much as i absolutely LOVE the sour beers, this one is a complete winner and as close to nirvana as i plan to ever get; thus, the marks."

"i can't even come up with words to describe how delicious this is. i will leave it at this: i am fairly new to the world of sours, but was spoiled from day one, having such things as fou foune, la femme fatale, sonderho hipster ale. i've had plenty of other sours since, and they just haven't had that tangy sourness as fou foune.. even the cantillon kriek was good, but not on par with fou foune. THIS, however, supplication is just as acidic and sour.. not as fruity, more vinegary-acidic with cherries and grape flavor.. but still. a completely delicious, cheek wrecking, dimple giving sour beer."

"Had this beer during the same trip that I tried Pliney. Wild beer. So much going on. I'm not too much of a fan of wild ales, however this one was very drinkable. Again, a barage (is that how you spell that?) of flavors going off in my mouth. Yeasty, bready, well balanced with hops and the sublte taste of the wine barrel that it was aged in. Not as good as Pliny, but a very good ale to say the least. An enjoyable pint!"

"O: I really want to like this one more than I do. It's got a lot going for it, but in the RR pantheon, I prefer Consecration, and in the grander scheme, for fair comparisons, I'd probably go with a Rodenbach Grand Cru for about half the price."

"To date I had tried duchesse, monks cafe, petrus sour blonde, dissident, and odio equus. I knew the hype was all around sours and had always thought of them as more of a novelty thing, not really understanding where the craze was coming from. Tried my first supplication from russian river...i absolutely get it now. Cheers."
"Overall: Definitely a quality sour. I expected the cherries to come out a bit more than they have, but I think they definitely help this one, and leave it well balanced, especially for the slightly higher ABV for a sour."

""
""
""
"This is quite a beer. I'm honored to have been able to taste one of the best sours out there - and I was highly impressed. It's complex, robust, and balanced. The acidity is not cloying in the least bit and works well with the wine/barrel notes. A must try for all beer advocates."
""
"I was incredibly spoiled for this to be the first sour beer I ever tried, on New Year's Eve 2012. $12 for a 12 oz bottle, and worth it. Dark red in appearance with incredible champagne-like bubbling that didn't stop. The bubbles felt great without being overpowering. The various yeasts combined to create a not-overpowering sour flavor mostly of cherries and wine grapes with some slight wood flavors from the Pinot barrels. Such an awesome beer. Having now tried a bunch of Russian River sours, this is still my favorite, although Consecration tastes very similar and is somewhat stronger."
"O: Just another great Russian River sour. Cherries and pino noir are a very nice touch"
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best AWAs you'll ever have. A real pleasure to drink. Pretty close to perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Ruby color with a small head. Smells strongly of tart cherries and sour grapes and tastes the same. Not an offensive flavor, very tasty. Overall, taste is dominated by a pleasant tart cherry flavor. Of all the sour beers I have had (which is only about 5) this is far and away the best. I would eagerly have a full pint of this which is more than I can say with most sours."

"Pours a hazy, dark brownish ruby color with a half finger head that dissipates very slowly and leaves a blanket of lacing. Tons of sediment, but that is expected with the amount of yeast added. Smells of funky, sour cherries, oak, vinegar, grapes, lots of funkiness. Lots of dryness that really does give it a wine-like smell. Smells almost like a cherry warhead. Taste starts with a very astringent, dry, sour cherry flavor, as well as some oak and funkiness. Then get some of the brown ale qualities: slight breadiness, maybe some cocoa (but i could just be imagining that), some carmel malt. Then the astringent sour notes from the brett and bacteria come back even stronger, along with lots more cherry, grape, funkiness, vinegar, oak, some carmel. Extremely dry finish that blends the wine and the beer qualities nicely. So sour, yet extremely balanced. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very lively carbonation from the refermentation that does give it a very champagne-like crisp finish. Very complex and so delicious. Just getting into this style, but I have a feeling I won’t come across many sours better than this one. Hope to try this again someday."

"O: The melange of flavors sums to an indescribable concoction that grays the area between beer and wine. The product is a sour ale with flavors that are boldly distinct yet combine together with synergism. A wonderful brew that is a must try for all beer lovers out there."
"O- Finally starting to truly develop a palate for sours. This one isn't my favorite, but it drinks well and has enough sweetness to balance."
""
"O: I continue to be extremely impressed with russian river sours I would go as far as to say I love this beer it is delicious, has so much depth and so many flavors. It pretty much has everything as advertised cherries pino and yeast/sour taste, I can't think of how to improve it. Its not the best beer I've ever had, but its definitely up there I highly recommend this beer."
"O. This is a marvelously drinkable beer, and a classic American wild ale. One of my favorite ""readily available"" sours. The balance of tart, sweet, and oak in this brew is superb, especially when fresh. The mouthfeel is lacking a bit, and I wish there was a bit more carbonation in the bottling of this beer. Otherwise it's fantastic."

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice appearance although not much in terms of head or lacing. Nose is a basic but a strong fruity bready combo. Flavor is fruity, but only a little sweet, white bready. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"This doesn't become the highest ranked 'American Wild Ale' on Beeradvocate.com without good reason. This beer is absolutely awesome and extremely ahead of its time(for American Craft Beer) when it first came out in the early 2000's.

"Overall, this wild ale has some similarities to the Temptation, but is more sour and has flavors of red grapes/wine vs. the white. The aromas and taste are stronger/bolder and more sour here. An Outstanding beer"

"Overall my expectations were high (probably because it's Russian River) but once again they were exceeded greatly. I've now had almost all the RR sours/wilds now and while they differ in certain aspects they have all been nothing short of fantastic. It's like they have different sours to fit your different moods, much like there are types of wines (and the barrels they age these in). Is there a better brewery for this many quality American Wild Ales in the country? I think not."
""
""
""
""
"What a beautiful concoction that Russian River has once again delivered. Words cannot recommend this more. It's really complex, but all the flavors meld together that it is really balanced. It's not too yeasty yet nicely sour, not too malty yet quite thickened, not too fruity yet deliciously tart overall. Will be trying more of these wild ales from RR in future for sure."
""
"Overall- This is incredible. Glad I have another bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Near perfect beer. Well Done RRBC."

"O: The mountain top of sours. Extremely high quality, very flavorful without being a ""big"" beer. One of the paragons of the style."

"O- A really well done sour that has a nice balance of tartness, fruitiness and funkiness that isn't too mouth puckering. Would love to have a couple more bottles of this and see how it develops."
""
"O - At $13 for a pint, I'd buy a 6 pack. Highly, Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one of the best sours I have ever had and once again Russian River hits a home run on sours. I for one will always look to try any sour beer that Vinnie and the team put out as they are always fantastic. My hats off once again"
""
""
""
""
"O: A balanced and complex sour beer. Along with Temptation and Consecration, it's one of the better Russian River beers (but pales in comparison to Beatification). Just don't compare it to a kriek... it doesn't taste like one, being much darker and heavier."
""
""
""
"i waited too long to try this one. despite its hefty price tag ($12), its one i’ll be enjoying from time to time. the reviews on this are excellent and i agree. it feels light, tastes moderately sour and smells so good that its hard to savor. i like this a little more than consecration, but its close."
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall – An awesome beer that is complex, but not overly so, and very tasty. I only wish I had another bottle!"
"Overall this is a really great sour beer. I don't believe it is the best I have had by far but I cannot deny the extremely high drinkability this possesses. Normally I do not seek out this beer because of the high price tag and ""average"" flavor profile for a sour but for $5 on draft, I'll take that everyday of the week and 2x on Zwanze Day."
"Pours a rusted brown with a little brownish head that sticks around longer than expected. Lots of oak on the nose with hints of sour cherry but nothing overpowering. There’s also a bit of red wine and some funkiness, but not that much really. Over ripe cherries start the palate off and then there’s a nice funky, wood middle with a solid sour finish that doesn’t last quite as long as I’d like."

"O - this beer might not be worth the price tag, but it's definitely solid. I'm going to attempt to age a couple of bottles."

"O: A well done sour ale through its woody, slightly vinous aspect. Quite sober all the same."
""
""
""
""
""
"High carbonation, light body, slightly sticky on the lips"
"O: Wow! A complex, fruity sour with a whole lot of balance. Well worth getting a hold of. This beer could easily substitute for light to moderate red wine when paired with food. There a quiet a few beers with more sour than this but Supplication has elegant refined flavor, I want nothing more out this beer than say a few more bottles."
""
""
"O: This beer is absolutely delicious and makes me want to come back for more. This is by far one of the best beers I have ever had."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Browned red, witha finger and change of eggshell head. Moderate retention and good lacing. Nose has oak, cherries, light acetic, mild vinous character, and some underlying sweet malt predominantly masked by the acid. Some underripe apple as well. Taste has sweet oak and malt character initially, and opens up immediately into really juicy cherries, acid and finishes with a subtle pucker. More acidic than directly tart/sour. Shred of alcohol.Mediumhigh carbonation, slight spritz in the conclusion. Complex and fantastically delicious, has all of the qualities I love in a sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not for the faint of heart. Wouldn't recommend this for someone's first sour. At the same time, I love the pinot barrel taste and the complexities. Not necessarily the best sour I've ever had but I would certainly recommend. Don't get why so many find this one ""world class""...had many European sours that trump this one. Either way, I woould love to try this one on tap to see if I spot anything else. Good stuff."
""
""
"Overall? One of the best beers I've ever had. Sours might be my new favorite thing. Not sure any will ever beat Supplication though"
""
""
"Overall the best sour I've had. This is the first of my russian river sours, and definitely going to make it challenging to continue aging my other RR sours in my cellar. Still amazed how all the different layers can separately and clearly present themselves as you drink the sips down"
"O: Absolutely delicious sour, never gets old"
"Edit: I recently opened a bottle from Batch 11 and was pleasantly surprised. I found much more oak and tart, vinous complexity than my review above indicates. Tasty."
""
""

"This is my first experience with a sour and I must say that I really enjoyed it. I, too, spent $18 dollars on this but I won't let it effect my review. This poured with a very thin head with little carbonated look. The color was cloudy, grainy, red and brown. I love the scent, it's tart and sour with a wine like aroma but a sweet cherry scent. After the initial shock of the tartness I became very comfortable and savor end the flavor. It was like an ale mixed with a red wine, which is very close to what it is. Overall I'm delighted with this experience."

"O - The best sour I've had yet. The balance is perfect and the flavor is incredible. Extremely sour at first, but tamed by a light sweetness and mild tartness."
""
"O: Not great - I don't really understand the praise for this beer. It's not terrible, but it reminds me of everything I don't like about AWAs. Overly sour with little complexity."

"First of all, yes, I paid $18 for this beer, which I think is outrageous, but I always have to grab up Russian River beers when I see them. This beer poured a cloudy reddish-brown color with lots of active carbonation. The head was one finger and pure white and lingered around for awhile, although it didn’t leave much lacing on the glass. On the nose, there was a definite presence of cherries and funk. Minor notes on the nose included oak and a bit of red wine. Complexity much? On the first sip, the first thing I think is that this beer is crazy tart. It took me a few sips to get used to that. It also didn’t have as much funk as I thought it would. After I got used to that, there was definitely oak and cherries in the taste. The carbonation is definitely active and goes well with the brew, which is much lighter than I thought it would be. This brew almost reminds me of a red wine, which also could be because it was aged in Pinot Noir barrels. The finish lingers with tart cherries. Although this would not be a beer I could have every night, the complexity really makes it an amazing beer. I would have this again in a second."
"Pours copper hued than brown with a very good head and lace. The aroma has big funk and cherry notes with some earthy and dusty character, light notes of caramel and bready malts as well. The taste starts with tart cherries, soft oak undertone, and biting brett nature. The Pinot Noir does show, but only at the finish, along with some subdued spice. Bright and dry mouthfeel, very lambic in nature. Did not expect the sparkling texture from how she looked in the glass. Gorgeous."
"O - Probably the most complex of the Russian River sours that I've had. Each sip brings something new as it is tart, sweet and funky all in one beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another sour that I love. Definitely world class, and after having PtE and Supplication, I'm really looking forward to Consecration."
"375mL Batch 4 courtesy of ajm. Pours a cloudy blood orange with a towering, rocky, tan head that leaves insane lacing. Aroma of cotton candy, lacto, sour cherries, baked cherry pie. I’m still not too keen on the taste here. The body is thin and spritzy. And there is a massive oak dryness, tannin, leather quality that distracts from the cherry and sour elements. It’s damn good, but I would take Beatification, Consecration, or Temptation over this any day. 3/22/2010 9/5/7/4/14=3.9"
""
""
"Pours a cherry-wood stain color with a slight off-white head. Aroma of delectable cherries, berries, green apple and hints of red win vinegar. Flavor begins with sour cherry awesomeness. Good tart mixed berry notes, hints of apple, oak, very small amount of funk. Finishes with pleasant vinegar and red wine notes, which help out the very dry, wine-like finish. Perfectly blended. Awesome combination of sweet and sour, funky, tart and dry. This is a sour which leaves you coming back for sip after sip."

"Finally got to try this beer and it didn’t disappoint. Smooth, tasted great and sweet."
"Overall: Really great sour, but I think I prefer Sanctification"
""
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a medium white head. Smell is top-notch: red wine, cherries, oak and lactic sourness all are in there and combine together quite nicely and make my mouth water. Flavor follows the nose almost exactly, red wine and oak stand out at first, then we get a little bit of the sweet cherries in the middle before a blast of sourness hits on the back end. It's really quite complex and excellent. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with really nice carbonation with a great mouth-coating bite. Overall, this really proves that Russian River's year-round wilds are better than most of the other limited wilds out there. It's a great beer with a lot going on."

"O: amazing beer, as expected. Can't think of much to make this beret. $18 per bottle here."
"O: Extremely complex with a moderate sourness. Transforms multiple times throughout the palate. Big, oaky characteristics with a good emphasis on sweet red wine. A lot of fruity and nutty flavors going on as well. There's not as much barnyard as reviews suggest, more of a lactic sourness. Phenomenal!"

"O- Very impressed. Russian River is successful in merging the fine characteristics of wine to the fine characteristics of beer. A must try sour. Glad I have another bottle."
""
""
"O - Got to be my favorite wild ale in the country at the moment. Could drink this every day."
"D - A bit more graceful than your typical sour. Unique in that I can sense the alterations between both the grapes and the cherries. Very easy to revisit this one and for that I am thankful."
""
""
""
"O: Quite enjoyable."
""
"O: Take my review for what it is worth as I admittedly don't care much for sours, though I do tend to like and appreciate RR sour beers. But something about this beer just didn't sit right with me. And while I do think this a very finely crafted beer, I think I just found it too sour, too acetic, too similar to the beginnings of a nice salad dressing for me to be able to really enjoy it."
""
"O- This was a fantastic sour. I'm just getting into sours, but this was one of the better one's I've had. The smell was phenomenal, very aromatic and could smell forever. The flavor was also excellent- with a nice amount of sourness and fruit flavors that were very well balanced. A little bit more age probably would have helped this a little bit- the 2009 Lou Pepe Kriek I had a couple weeks ago definitely had more flavor. Definitely not bad though. For a sour of this caliber that has been barrel aged for over a year, you can't beat the price on this one. A must try for sour fans."

"O - My first real foray into sours. It's a treat! Not a malt bomb or a hop bomb, but a cherry tart bomb! And it's just so drinkable with the cherries shining through but not being overpowering. Loved it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing special in my opinion. Decent enough beer, and it did grew on me a little as I went on, but many of its Belgian cousins are vastly superior."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer definitely lived up to the hype, and I wish I had tried it sooner."
""
""
"**Edit: After more extensive sour testing, this is defintely a higher quality beer than I initially gave it credit for. Raised to a solid 4.5. I look forward to trying this again."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The sour cherries come through really nicely without being overpowering. The balance is very nice with the barrel flavors adding some great complexity."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not really sure what to say, it's unique, different, incredibly complex and an experience in itself."
""
"The beer pours a dark amber with a thin tan head. The nose is pungently sour with notes of acetone, wine, and a slight yeastiness. Very intense flavor profile with bursting tart cherries and an incredibly dry finish. This may be one of the driest and most tart sours I've had, but it's incredibly drinkable. Definitely worth trying if you can finagle a bottle."
""
""
"Outstanding. Thin, thin head dissipates, but continues to create sliding lace as I sip. If you're a sour/wild lover, you owe it to yourself to try the finest I've ever had in the style. Tart nose right off the bat incites salivation, dried not-so-ripened cherries . . . some kind of subtle lactose in the taste, drying tannin, tart flavor with cherries and big oak. Don't have words. It's one of those beers that make you think: how'd they make a beer do that? For the record, I don't like wilds!"
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"I still can't say i'm a huge fan of sours, but this does make me want to try more of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $10 for a 355 ml bottle made from glass that is so thick, you'd swear this was a blunt weapon."
"O: Worthy. I like it a lot. Really coming on board with RR wild ales and this one did not disappoint! Simply put...wow."
""
""
"On tap at Bobby G's. 5/17/12. Batch 10. Pours a reddish brown amber with a small white head settles to a ring and leaves some very light lacing on the glass. The aroma has lots of lactic acid. Cherry, funky earthiness, slight hop presence, and a hint of acetic acid. The taste is tart with a light initial sweetness. Lots of lactic, decent amount of cherry, and just a bit of brett funkiness. The finish is tart and drying with a bit of acetic acid. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Certainly one of the best regularly available sours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite nice. Cherry is subtle, and really sophisticated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I would dump this in the Russian River if I could. Maybe I'll revisit it in the future but why bother?"
""
""
"Recommended. I'm anxious to see where this brew goes in time... I'll be sure to update. It's sour, but not mind buckling sour. The Pinot Noir barrels do this brew wonders."
""
""
"O: can i buy a case? i like this, especially for being a non-Belgian beer."
""
""
"This was one of the two beers that I tried to see if I liked Sour beers. I don't. This ""beer"" poured a strawberry blonde into a snifter. Their was a rush of carbonation that left no head and no lacing. This one tastes Like a sour cherry wine cooler. Zero beer taste. I should note that I do not like wine and this beer had a very distinct pinot noir flavor to it. Every sip made me pucker up and shiver from the sourness of everything in one beer. Sour beers are not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this bottle a lot more than my first one. In fact, I will drink this more in the near future. I still seem to prefer Temptation and Beatification over this one, but regardless, an excellent sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Best sour I've had so far. Look forward to trying it again."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a high quality sour, really glad I had the whole little bottle to myself to let it warm up and explore the intricacies, I will definitely pick this up again if I see it."
"Had this at the brewery. Pours a dark, ruby amber. Tastes quite sour, but it's not overpowering. In fact it tastes fucking awesome. LOts of sour cherry notes that just made my mouth water. A little bit of tartness with each sip too. I wish I had another pint right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"one of the best, and most, sour beers ive ever had! pours a thin brownish rust color with a short but very active tan head. fizzy. smells like sour cherries, old church wine, and brettanomyces. its almost like smelling salts, it throws the head back in intensity. wow. flavor is hard to describe, there are notes of cherries, but nothing sweet. there is so much sour here it puckers you rich up for a moment, then it goes insanely dry and is gone without a trace. the brown ale base is inconsequential here as the bacteria and fruit steal the show. the tannic tang from the wine barrels adds another layer of sour depth to this one. feel is perfect perfect perfect. more than effervescent carbonation serves the sour train well, and the drinkably medium body is a welcomed surprise. russian river rules the roost on beers of this genre. this baby is alltime!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, still not a fan of sour ales, but it's the best one I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer. I wish I didn't have to go so far out of my way to get the greatness coming from Russian River."
""
"I had this on tap at the brewpub. This may just be my favorite RR sour. It's got a big sour bite but a rich flavor that goes beyond that. The fruity and woody notes help make every sip as interesting as the last. I just can't get enough of this one."
""
" This ones changed the way I look at sours, such a well made brew, many things needed to happen in just the right proportion and order to make this what it is. On top of that it also needed to be well packaged and sent to me by the most generous and awesome Rutager"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great sour beer and one that I could enjoy drinking very regularly if only it was more easily available. This beer embodies what a sour/wild ale should be. Not overly sour to put off people new to the style but still really great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For my first ""big sour"" this is a big win. Russian River can do no wrong! (as long as I forget about redemption)"
"O: This is a fantastic sour beer. My experience with sours is limited, but compared to what I have had this is in the top 2 on my list."
""
""
""
"Russian River never fails to impress me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A masterpiece in complexity, balance, and straight-out deliciousness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very well-crafted wild ale by Russian River. It's not as good as Consecration, but it is still one of the better Wilds I have had. I am officially pumped to get into Beatification now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable Wild Ale, not really a weak spot for me, a 'sipper' that went pretty quick, I could definitely drink a couple/few of these on a warm summer day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Den"
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: I know this is a top 50 brew, but I'm still surprised I really like this (I'm not a sour guy). I'd say this is better than many Belgian brews... though personally, I'd still prefer a New Glarus Belgian Red."
""
""
""
""
"Probably about as close to as good as it gets for the style."
"This is my second Wild Ale. My first was Consecration. This in my opinion isn't as flavorful as Consecration, but it's delicous and worth trying. It's drinkable, flavorful, but it's a sipper. I would definitely have this again."
"Overall this is one outstanding beer."
""
""
"If you're looking for rich fruits and deeply complex malts, this is not the beer for you. There's no hop bite in the tailend (sans a little bitterness), nor is there heavy breath-catching sourness. This wild ale is all about balance, complexity, and drinkability. Scarce in the flaw department, this beer drinks like a great wine. A real shmoozer. Skoals! 4.5"
""
"Overall - An excellent Wild Ale and as good as some of the Belgians i've had... probably not for everyone but definitely recommended..."
"3.5O: Eh, it's alright, but RR makes a lot of beers that are better and there are many sours/wild ales that top this one. Not recommended in bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a world class beer. The flavor is aggressively sour, but there's an underlying sweetness and a nice dry finish to complement the tartness. It's one of the most refreshing beers I've ever had and is very reminiscent of Rodenbach Grand Cru (in overall drinking experience if not in flavor). Every beer fan should seek this one out and try it at least once. I can't imagine how difficult this beer must be to make."

"Picked up the last bottle on the shelf at a random store for under $10? What!? Batch 009. Wondered if something was wrong with it, but for the price I was willing to find out. Poured to Duvel tulip the beer is a beautiful ruby amber with a thin white head, some retention, some lacing. Looks great for a beer aged 15 months in pinot barrels. The nose is even better, nice cherry, apple, pear fruit character mixes with with a mild brett funk, sour tartness. I don't know how this could be more inviting. The flavor is complex and perfect, really. Tart sourness at first that blends to a mild sour cherry to lightly bitter caramel with a light biscuity background. So much flavor, so much going on, it's amazing this comes together so well. Phenomenal. Good carbonation and medium to full bodied. Overall, this beer is classic. I think I am in love. I won't wait so long between bottles next time as I forgot how memorable this is."
""
""
"Overall: A phenomenal beer. This brewer, having once been focused on wine, knows what he is doing - and does it well."
""
"Overall this is an unbelieveable sour. I love the complexity. Not as funky as I anticipated, but still it was truly a treat to drink. Looking forward to putting the second bottle in my cellar to see what some age can do."

""
""

""
""
""
""

""
"If Russian River's Supplication were cheaper and actually available in my area I would drink this daily."
"Overall this was a good refreshing beer. Would love to have this in the mountains on a spring day. Not too much into the particular style but would definitely buy another bottle whenever it rarely pops up."
""
"Overall: So impressed by this beer and would happily drop another $15 to get another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good sour overall, though the taste doesn't have quite the complexity of the nose. Still, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like It? Yes, Of Course"
""
""
"O: Great beer! Excellent tart sourness with some bready malt rounded out with Belgium yeast.  Well balanced with strong but not over powering sourness.   This is the third RR wild ale I've had the pleasure of drinking. All were fantastic (supplication, consecration, and temptation), I think I may slightly like temptation the best however all are wonderful and I'd gladly drink any of them any chance I could get.  "
""
""
""
""
"O - I have always liked sours and this one just cements that feeling. I really enjoyed this and wish that this beer were available around here."
""

"Review 600! 375 ml bottle into tulip, batch 006X2. Pours hazy red orange color with a nice 1 finger light khaki head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge tart cherries, green apple, grapes, pear, light vinegar, oak, red wine, hay, light spices, and a lot of funk. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity, Taste of big tart cherries, apple, grape, pear, red wine, citrus, oak, vinegar, spiciness, earthiness, hay, and funk. Lingering notes of tart fruit, oak, wine, and spices on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance of sourness and sweetness makes this very smooth on the palate. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and acidic mouthfeel. Slightly prickly carbonation, but still very smooth drinking. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Overall this is an outstanding wild ale; with great balance, complexity, and smoothness."
""
"Batch 007 poured from a 375ml to a snifter: Pours a BRIGHT ruby orange. An off white thin cap of high carb head that sits off to one side. Brilliant, consistent beading. Lacing is lovely. Nose is complex to say the least. Lots of fruity red wine funkiness backed by the bright clove/sweet bread of a good Belgian golden. On the tongue there’s a surprisingly pungent earthy sour wallop that gives way to a beautiful floral array of sweet complexities. There’s a lingering tart presence on the back of the palate. Sour cherries, of course. The feel is smooth and a bit dry I think. Wonderful. Overall, this is a sour that might even appeal to the non-sour beer drinker. Yum."
""
""
""
""
"O- Again, not my favorite style of beer, but quality through and through."
""
"A-"
"Overall: This is by far the best of the three Russian River sours I have had and the only one that I feel can compete with true lambics. I would love to get another bottle of this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Slowly becoming one of my favorite sours out there. Worth the price tag for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A truly excellent sour, with very nice fruit flavors. A perfect balance of sour and sweet to keep you wanting another sip."
""
"The first sour I have ever had. Served on tap in a 10.5 oz tulip glass. I didn't know what to expect. Nice Amber Color. Nice small head that settles at the top of the glass and dissipates as you continue to drink. The taste is fruity and bold with hints of cherry, oak and red wine. The cherry taste is there and stays with the beer with every drink. It has become the sour on which I will judge every other sour on."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not going to recap here. Just an amazing beer."
"A great sipping beer. Very nice with Kevin's deluxe blue cheese - caramelized onion, and fig pizza."
"Overall, all that has to be said is WOW what an incredible brew. This brew was most likely one of the best things I have ever put to my lips. Just sayin'..."
""
""
""
"Really wish I had another one of these in the fridge. The best sour beer I’ve ever had, might be the best beer I've ever had too. RR rules. thanks again Jeff."
""
""
"O: Balance, Balance, Balance. That says it all, a great sour (and I am not a huge sour fan), well balanced, rich taste, mouth feel and a great nose."
""
"Overall, this is phenomenal. A strong sour cherry presence that plays beautifully off of the more subtle citrus and light grain notes; the wine barrels add an extra layer of complexity that will certainly keep one coming back for more."
""
"O: This is a great sour!"
"O: After the initial smell, I wasn't sure what to think. But a few sips and it completely won me over. This stuff is awesome, and I'll get it in the future if I can."
"Ok, I'll admit, I knew this beer was going to be great. If I could make something this good at home, I don't know if I'd ever leave. Another fantastic offering from one of America's top breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Most people will admit they don't like sour beer, and it does sound gross at first, but give this a try and you won't be disappointed. This is the kind of sour ale where each sip beckons for the next. A refreshing change from the hop overload of RR's famous other beers. The taste is dominated by the sourness of it, but in an enjoyable way. The mouthfeel is wine like in it's tartness, but entices you to drink more. This is a beer that defines specialty, hand craftsmanship, and care. Get it on tap if you can, this beer does NOT bottle well."
""
"O: This is one of the best sour beers I've had to date."
""
"O: Another fantastic beer from RR! This one is usually my go-to beer from RR as it is usually readily available and uber choice all-around. The complexity, yet simplicity is so perfect that words do not do it justice. If you haven't tried it, go get it! If you have tried it and don't like it, send the rest my way. If you enjoy it like me, I dig your style and maybe I'll invite you when I crack open the large format - that will be epic."
""
""
"I have been waiting to open this Batch 8 things of beauty. Well, Super Bwl Sunday seems as good of a time as ever. On he brief tip, this beer delivers on everything it promises. The Pint Noir barrels come thru nicely, the cherries along with the trio of yeasts make this a tart number with a delicious zing. Very nice mouthfeel, but the flavor is the star of the show, and I believe this flavor earned an Oscar nomination in my eyes. This beer has gone to territory only held previously by Abyss and BCBS. Well, there is a new King of the hill, so let us see if any other wild ales or sours can knock Supplication off its new perch. Challenge!"
"O- One of the best sours for a reason. I've had this one multiple times and still love it."
""
""
"O- One of the best American sour beers you can get, a really tasty, refreshing brew."
""
""
""
"O-a deliciously crafted ale with a great blend of flavors"
"Overall - Refreshingly well-balanced between the sour and fruit. Great for a sunny afternoon picnic or just complimenting some brie crackers. If you like sours this is the one to have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor impeccably recreates what the aroma suggested this beer would bring--dry, acetic wine notes laced with cherry tartness and wooden funk. My only qualm is the mouthfeel, as I feel that a tighter, creamier carbonation level would allow this beer to explore the palate a bit longer. Still, my nit-pick is a minor one. This is a fantastic sour ale and an essential representative of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Supplication is a good wild ale, not overly sour or sweet but very approachable."
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a remarkable beer. This has been staring at me from my fridge for a while and it's been well worth the wait. I've had a few wilds, but this one sets the bar quite high."
""
""
""
""
"O: Truly a good beer. 'Delicate' comes to mind, its not too over-the-top or in-your-face like other Brett sours, the barrel aging and cherries are a perfect combination."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is another beer that I'm glad I finally got to try. It pours a deep reddish mahogany with small particles floating in the beer. The beer itself is topped off with a thin off white head that quickly fades to a ring around the center. The aroma is subtle but complex, tobacco, plums, raisins, figs, tart cherries, and currants. The lactic aroma is more subtle then other RR beers. Peaking through the other aromas is a bit of funk, but not a pronounced amount of funk. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma, figs, plums, raisins and cherries with sour tones. The carbonation is at a minimum and the body is medium-light with a lingering sour finish. Excellent beer and something I would definitely seek out again."
""
"O - probably in my top 5 American sours. I need to get more of this to cellar."
""
""
""
""
"O- I did not like this beer the first time I had it. Now I appreciate the sourness. I love RR for the high ibu beers and this beer brings something different to the table."
""
""
""
""
"O - an absolute pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I remember this being better on tap at Extreme Beer Fest a couple years ago. That said in the bottle this is still excellent. Very sour, yet not as sour as most I have had from Cantillon. I could drink several glasses of this if I could find it. One of my favorites from Russian River."
"O - One of the best American Wild Ales I've had. Glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
"O - One of the most interesting beers I've had. You gotta enjoy sours to like this one."
"Not a big fan."
"Opens with a tart snap of cider and biscuity malt flavors. Active, prickly carbonation throughout. Moves into a balsamic vinegar middle with hints of wild yeast and sour cherries. Puckering mouthfeel. Sharp hop presence emerges before reverting to mild malt sweetness. Finishes dry with a touch of wood smoke. So very sessionable; many regrets that I had time for only one. Then again, there was no more to be had."
""
""
""
""
"What a beer. It's nearly the perfect sour. Sour cherries and brett funk dominate the aroma. The taste is so complex. Sour cherries. Tartness. Sourness. Oak. Mouth watering. Red Sour Patch Kids, liquified. It was a real challenge for me to work through a bottle of Supplication. It is so good, but it made my mouth work too damn hard. Too much salivating and puckering. That can be taken as a tongue-in-cheek compliment, but it is also its only detracting quality. I can't sit and drink bottle after bottle of this. My mouth would. not. survive."
""
""
""
"Sourness and oak both very measured, and not much funk. More balanced, rounded and nuanced than any kriek. Not my thing, but a stunner just the same."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best sours I've ever had, which isn't saying a ton. But I have been lucky to sample a few Russian River sours in the past in this is by far my favorite one."
"Pours clear copper color with some whispy white head. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells ridiculously good: sweet cherry and loads of oak and spice, some brett. Taste is more fruit forward (red fruit like cherry), brett, lacto, just a little oak, with some mild bright acidity. The oak aroma is huge compared with the taste. Medium body and medium-high carbonation. Overall, an excellent, very drinkable wild ale. The tartness is really mild. I love the Pinot (my favorite wine) characteristics that come through. I've had this on tap numerous times and never enjoyed it this much."
""
"O: This is pretty delicious. As it warmed sat for a while I got more of the oak in the nose as well as the flavor. It's pretty complex and just damn good. Only complaint was the price, and of course I had to drive to Philly to pick it up."
"Overall this is a great beer with a dry finish that doesn't turn me off like some beers I have recently tasted. Not much sweet which I found very inviting for this beer."
""
""
""
"This is a favorite beer of mine, and has remained very close to what I remember from before. I consider this to be my current benchmark of the American Wild Ale category."
""
""
"O - absolutely amazing sour, my first RR beer too"
""
""
""
"This beer pours a deep golden raisin color with great carbonation and just a thin head. There is an immediate oak and banana aroma. The beer has a clear tart beginning that quickly gives way to fermented fruit. You notice the wine barrel aging at the back of a sip. Cherry tartness is not overly sour and well balanced. The carbonation of this beer really enhances the mouthfeel. All in all a excellent wild ale!"
""
""
"Overall: Supplication is surprisingly refreshing.. and complex. Truly a world-class beer."
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding beer!!! I could honestly drink this everyday! It's tart/sour enough, but displays the beautiful notes that fruit and Pinot noir can add to this style. Beautifully sour, but drinkable beyond belief. I'd recommend this beer as the best 'American Wild' that i've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wild ales are growing on me and seem to get better with each one I have and each BBF I volunteer for. If it wasn't for the fests, I would have very little knowledge or experience with these sour and funky beer. I am happy to have brought this back safely from Denver and to start off the new year in Boston on a good note."
""
"pours out a murky reddish brown with a half finger of light brown head that fizzled out as quick as it formed. smell and taste are both very tart and sour. sour cherries lead the charge and are quickly followed up with flavors of wine and yeast, nice tart earthy taste. mouthfeel is very lively with excellent carbonation tickling the tongue. a medium weight body compliments this beer perfectly. a nice dry tart finish doesnt linger long. this is an excellent beer that everyone should have the opportunity to try."
"Overall - Just a fantastic beer and drinking experience. It's got the flavours found in a average sour but there is also a level of complexity that keeps it interesting throughout. I'm happy I picked this one for review 1000 and I'm looking forward to the next 1000 beers. Happy 2012 BA!"
""
""
""
"O: A great sour. Really deserves all the accolades. More bitter than sweet and finishes nice and dry. A real treat to get to try this finally."
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent example of the style. It's drinkability comes from sour cherries that are just powerful enough to hide the alcohol, but not strong enough to shock the palate."
"Overall: A nice sour although outclassed by Cantillon or 3 Fonteinen. For obvious reason (from a microbiological point of view) the balance and complexity of artificial inoculated sours is always much lower compared to the real air-inoculated Belgium sours, but besides that, this is the best of the rest."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic beer and a huge thanks to Ales4Blado for this in a trade"
"O - Top tier sour with lots of complexity and great sourness. Another great sour from Russian River."
""
""
"It is the most amazing rich ruby red. It smells like sour cherries. The taste is cherries and a slight grapey twist like wine. Very complex citrus and sour cherry characteristics from the brett and its friends. This is the best American wild ale I have ever tasted, not that my experience is extensive."
"Overall, this was a delicious beer. Once this beer has a chance to open up it really blossoms into a complex treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Top notch. Vinnie and Russian River know how to make an outstanding beer. The pinot noir barrels and cherries really bring something special to this beer. Not just one of my favorite sours but one of my beers period. This one is not for someone trying to break into sours but an absolute must try for someone who appreciates the style. I just wish this beer wasn't so expensive."
""
""
"Just starting out with this style of beer but Supplication will be hard to beat. A must try."
""
""
"O: very impressed. After it warmed up I was able to get some great oak aroma. Obviously I love sours or else I wouldn't have bought it, but this is definitely one of the most well balanced sours I've ever had. Amazing oak aroma, semi-sweet and tart body, and dry lingering aftertaste. It's just perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is okay. I have not had a lot of sours so it is hard to rate it against other beers in its style. However, as a beer for special occasion it will not stand out in my memory compared to a lot of the beers that I have had."
"Great sour experience from RR. Very balanced and yet ""in your face"" at the same time."
""
""
"Overall - Really spectacular. I don't get to drink many sours as good as this one. I can't wait to try the Beatification in my cellar. It tempts me every day. Is there anything Russian River doesn't do well?"
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, another great Russian River experience and a very satisfied customer! Sours are definitely an acquired taste, but this is among the best of the best. Definitely lives up to the hype, IMO."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Wow. If you have had Santification or Consecration this beer is similar but way better than both. If you have the money buy at least one and enjoy. I paid 17 per bottle from Pinnochios Beer Garden in Media, PA. Well worth the buy. I offered to a friend of mine who hates all craft beers because he is not open to the ""big"" taste but he was blown away by this one!"
"I acquired this one in a trade from solomongrundy. Awesome trader, thanks again!!! Poured from 375 ml bottle into a chalice. It pours a beautiful pinkish orange with a fizzy white head that disappears rather quickly. Very Tony bubbles of carbonation. It smells of sour cherry and musty yeast. Mild scent of oak is there as well. Wow... Very tart. I'm not really a big sour fan but I've had a few and have begun to appreciate the style. Lots of sour cherry and wine flavors. Mild oak flavors hang on the tongue. This is a palate scrubber. It will obliterate any beer you've had throughout the night. One of the better ones I've had. Very acidic and dry. Tasty, but just not my favorite style."

"Final thought - at $12 a pop and a nice 7% abv this is a great beer. Hard to find at times, but if you do find one, buy one and age it as well"
"Pours a hazy light copper/ruby color with a slightly pink, off white head. Cherry and oak on the nose with potent lactic sourness. Slight earthiness and vanilla on the aroma as well. This batch of draft is not as intensely sour as other bottles I've had. Cherries are a little fruiter and tart, and overall the flavor is sweeter. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation and a dry finish. It is what it is."
""
"Dr: Very drinkable for the ABV, sourness, and style. Affordable (50 cents per sampler!). I think overall it's better bottle-conditioned."

"Overall, a great beer that is exceptionally well made. Get some if you can. Thanks to david131 for the bottle."
""
"D/O - Drinkability is high. This is one of the best Russian River sours I've had and part of that has to do with how complex and smooth it all is. It's easy to distinguish the fruit, the barrel, and the bugs that went into making this, and the final result is a delicious sipper that I am thankful for!"

"Pours out a semi murky brown tinged amber, no head, yet paradoxically has a semi spritzey carbonation as also typical in a great sour. The wine aroma really does come through on the nose, full of bold fruity sour cherry character on a base of tannic wood aroma, just about everything I want out of a sour nose all at once somehow delivered without being cloying or overwhelming at all. I think I may be seeing why this beer has developed such a cult following. Tastes of sour candied cherries and than everything I experienced within the nose coming at me just like clockwork in exactly the same order, only difference being that the pucker of the acidity fades out only to be replaced by the wood tones accentuated in the finish. Very much on the gentler (yet paradoxically also the drier) side of most wild ales that I have sampled as of this date. The body is medium thick and not as astringent as it could have been, job well done!"
""
""
""
""
"I hate to validate all the RR boobs out there, but this is a great beer. Really enjoyed this. At this price I could not drink Supplication daily without liquidating my 401k, but I will seek out other RR wilds and would periodically by Supplication again."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""

"Head dissipated quickly. The nose is incredible. Funk and cherries. The cherries return in the taste along with a faint oak turning tart and finishing dry and almost sweet. It's amazing how the cherries persist throughout without being over the top like a lindeman's. The effervescence sends the beer across my tongue but dries out quickly to leave just a hint of cherries. This is an amazing beer: nuanced and tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Poured slowly from a 375ml bottle and left the sediment in the bottom. It poured a dark cloudy orange with a perfect head. Smells of cherries, obviously. The first taste if of cherries followed by sour. The sour is not overdone. Quite a nice brew and if you like sour cherries, it's worth seeking out."

"On tap poured into a 10oz goblet. Pours a reddish amber in color with no head whatsoever and no sediment. Smell is faint but of mild vinegar and sweetness. taste is of potent vinegar and oaky vanilla. A little bit of cherry coming through not much tho. Not much lingering at all. Love sours and this is one of my favorites!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks Baldo!"
"Conclusion: Not what I expected, but very tasty and complex. I always thought this would be more sour and singular, with bracing sourness and a real smack of cherries. Instead it is softer and presents its flavor profile a gentle touch. The flavors are defined and layered, and overall this is just a great beer."

"Overall - I have had this many times on tap and in the bottle from various batches. I absolutely love this beer and would have it in my top 10 or so of beers of all time. I feel that this beer has a more sour aspect to it in the bottle and is more carbonated than when served on tap. One of my favorites so it's nice to always have this around in bottle and also to get it on tap for only 6.75 at the brewery. If you haven't had this beer make sure you try some."

"Appearance is a red brown body with a small tan head. Its` nose contains cherry, red wine and a general sourness. Supplication has a taste of of more cherries, sour apple, funk and some oak. The mouthfeel of it has some life to it, a very nice crispness. It really has a certain wine/champagne quality to it. This was another very good wild from RR. When I find myself in Philly, its` always a treat to try something from this brewery."

"Overall it was enjoyable. The sourness is strong but not too much. Any more sour and I would have had problems. I think the wine-note crossover is done well. But I still don’t like spending $10+ on a small bottle. Because of the price I probably wouldn’t buy it again if I came across it in CA. It’s nice to have once, though."

"O- This is the first sour I've tasted that really blew my palate apart. I'm hard pressed to try and find something more intense than this. This beer is a game changer . Great offering from RR ."
"I don't know how often I'll buy this one as it costs nearly 15 bucks a bottle on the East Coast but definitely worth a try!"
"O: As good as a sour gets."
"Must Try Recommendation."
"To me this is a super funky beer, though I must admit not as groundbreaking as I had built it up to be. Maybe I don't know sours enough to appreciate the nuance, but I can appreciate the care taken to craft it and balance it. It's sour but not too sour, complimentarily oaked, and definitely quality."
"O - A great sour, starting to warm up to the style."
"Special thanks to Chowdahead for sharing this one. Cellared for a year, then poured into a snifter. Reddish brown in color, not much head or lacing. Nose is tart cherries, apple, and some sweet sugary notes. Taste is mix of tart cherry and sour apple with a little brown sugar in the mix. Never thought I would become a fan of sours, but the Allagash releases got me hooked, and this one takes the cake as my favorite thus far. Mouthfeel was smooth and not overly sour. Looking forward to trying some more sours from Russian River. Top notch."
"Poured a crimson cherrywood color, with a creamy cap of off-white head that left a bit of streaky lacing on the tulip glass. The head dissipated mostly, but left a ubiquitous ringlet of delicate bubbles behind. Tart aroma, rich with various indistinct fruits, and classic Brett-ness; woody, with some nice funk. Incredibly complex taste: starts out tart and sour, with notes of cherries, cranberries, lemons!!! and white wine; mellows out mid-palate with a distinct mustiness that allows the woody characters to come out, then a fruity reprise in the end with dried cherries and dried pineapple, for a solid crisp finish. Not heavy in the mouthfeel, but definitely full on the palate. Beautifully crafted, and highly drinkable."
"cheers"
"This is a great-tasting and complex beer--a good twist on the usual Belgian sour. I will certainly have this again when I can get it. I'd like to try on older batch, or age one for a while."
"Overall - Damn good beer. As a non-sour-about-to-get-into-sour fan this is a great intro into sours. Consecration and temptation was too much for me, but this was good. 4.5/5"
"Overall - This is far and away the best sour I have had to date. The added dimension from the pinot and the balance will be hard to be topped by another sour in my opinion."
"Overall-A good solid sour ale for sure. I would drink it again and look forward to aging one much longer. Probably around 6 months to a year. I guess i wouldnt mind if it was a little less sour but its still really good. Glad i encouraged myself to try this beer."
"Overall this is a fuck of a beer. Easily one of the best offerings from Russian River. PLEASE be sure to drink this at the proper temperature. Minimum of 55F to let all the flavors emerge."
"Overall :cant say enough good things about this beer if haven't had it it is worth the I vestment"
"Pours a hazy copper hue. No head. Nice scents of tart cherries with a faint sweet smell. Notes of red wine are present in the aroma, too and compliment the tartness nicely Big, but tame tartness with a decent acidic flavor. After letting this sit and stir for a while the sweeter notes come to the front. Dark cherries, diacetyl, hints of dry red wine. The carbonation definite helps the tartness of the brew, it makes it sharper. Noticeable notes of brett and diacetyl for a buttery, yet funky finish. The beer's medium body definitely helps your palate deal with the tartness and the acidity nicely so that you can enjoy the complexity rather than focus on how funky it is. Top notch. Very well balanced."
"I like the American craft-brewing tendency of, the higher-quality the beer, the more they want to tell you about it on the packaging...Knowing what went into this offering makes it all the more enjoyable - the sourness, yeast, wood, funk (oh, and actual beer, too!), all kept in balance, yet still rendering a beverage for the adventurous palate. Sort of a more laid-back Cantillon - scary, earth-relationship-affirming, and ultimately tasty."
"Overall, this brew is another great sour from Russian River. Crisp, tart, and full of flavors. Boom, I'm lovin' it!"
"I'm beginning to fall in love with sours. This beer was a huge hit in my book. Such a great beer that I could stock my fridge with if it was available here. Thanks again, Dave, for this awesome brew."
"This is my single favorite wild ale to date. The tartness is not overpowering, but instead mingles with the fruit and malt to allow for a high level of complexity. Very recommended!"
"O: A+"
"The beer does go down pretty easy but it is quite sour might not be something you would have more than one or two servings of."
"Not sure how this is a brown ale because it doesn't taste anything like one. Nice tart, cherry smell with some date and fig notes. It's almost like a belgian dark ale blended with a brown ale--adding some fruit and sour tartness along with it. Incredibly complex and one of the best barrel aged sours I've had, even from RR. I have about 4 of these I've stowed away now, anxious to see how they change over time. I would highly recommend picking some up if you can."
"O: This was a winner in my book. Very well balanced between funk and sour and the subtle sweetness really rounded it out."
"O: Thought this was great, but well below the quality of authentic Belgians I've had. Well balanced, with a bit of a strange aftertaste. I would get it again no doubt, I just wish it was a bit less funk and a bit more cherry."
"overall: i have found a style of beer that i have zero interest in exploring. I imagine that some beer geeks out there will love this, but for me, a sour ale is just not something i'll ever want. the flavor is decent, but not all too complex, and it is not very refreshing at all either. Glad I tried the best of the sour ales before I wasted my time with any other ones. This just isn't my cup of tea."
"Overall: This is a great brew. Lots of interesting flavors and as someone looking to branch out and try new things this is great! Give it a shot if you can, i doubt you'll be disappointed."
"Drink and overall: Fantastic beer. A real nice treat, that I will seek out again in the future. I've had enough to know it's worth it's weight in shipping. My mouth has a great lasting flavor that I am really enjoying, thank you VC."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one quite drinkable in that each sip was easy to take and easily followed the preceding one. If you are looking for one word to describe this beer, think “complexity.” This is a beer that deserves its reputation and overall is an excellent beer. I’m looking forward to seeing how bottles of this one age over the next few years."
"In the end, not something to drink everyday, but definitely a special treat that I would love goretudn to often."
"O: Wow, I'm just dumbstruck with how good this is. It's as close to perfect as I've had."
"O: Overall Supplication is one of my favorite offerings from Russian River. This beer is never disappointing and the hype around it is justified. I seek this out regularly every month or so. Thanks Vinnie for sending this awesome beer to Philly! 4.5"
"Pours a nice dark cherry color w/ a one finger head that quickly disappears to a sliver. Very cloudy and alive looking brew. Good carbonation and decent lacing. Awesome looking Wild Ale. Wow. The nose is fantastic. Cherry, funk, some brown sugar, caramel, sourness, a hint of candy sweetness. Really complex and nice. Opens up really nicely with warming/airing out. Now... on to the taste. Pretty much the same as the nose, minus the candy sweetness. It's really not too sour, just about right. It seems like the taste just keeps evolving the more you get into it. Definitely some wine/oak/vinegar in the taste as well. None of the 7% ABV is evident at all. Very carbonated and dry finish on this beer. A little too carbonated, otherwise a higher score. Overall, this is a top flight Wild Ale. I like Consecration a little better, but this is highly recommended. Cheers!"
"D: 375mL split two ways is simply not enough. Russian River delivers once again! Now if only they'd ship to NYC..."
"D - this is a really nice, complex brew from RR. It is a very good beer, but didn't ""wow"" me as much as I was hoping for. It is almost like a more complex Consecration but not as powerful. That being said, this was an awesome beer, I just think it falls a little short of other Wild Ales I have had (and other RR brews for that matter). Highly recommended!"
"""Batch 006X2. Corked popped off with force. Pours a nice ruby color with a moderate white head. Aroma of sweet and tart cherries with great vanilla cream. Although this one has a much more subtle aroma, I really like the vanilla and wine grape. The beer is a very mouth puckering, medium bodied and well carbonated delight. Well balanced. Not too sweet or dry, with a lingering fruit finish. Very nice. I wish I could get ahold of more Russian River beers."""
"O: Very hard to find anything wrong with this beer, the nose is a bit boozy for some reason but it really is a world class beer. It delivers outstanding flavors and each batch seems to hit the nail on the head."
"O - Solid 4.5's."
"O- An amazing beer from Russian River. The super tart cherry flavors and prickly carbonation make this a joy to drink. Possibly my favorite sour from RR."
"O: Such a nice, not-over-the-top sour: fruity and woody and delicate and funky and awesome"
"O- a solid brew. Simple, But complicated. Worth seeking out."
"O: This is what American wild is all about. Nice tartness, tons of depth, fruit, bugs, its all here. I might not claim this to be my favorite beer anymore but its still got a top 5 spot. An awesome beer."
"Overall, this one was lovely. Out of this compared to the other 2 RR wilds I've had (consecration, temptation) I'd have to put this third. Cheers to them though, never disappointed. Will definitely get again and again."
"O: This is the sort of drink that should come to mind with you think of the term 'fine beer'. Just a pleasure to drink, truly a lovely beer."
"Cherry sours are my favorite sours and this one does not disappoint. Definitely one to trade for regularly. Definitely not as stellar as Lou Pepe Kriek (I love the funk!) but awesome for an American Wild IMO."
"Overall: I cannot believe it has taken me this long to try my first Supplication. This is everything I want in a sour, I will be coming back to this beer again and again."
"Overall: 5/5 acceptional, tasty offering from Russian River."
"O: Currently, this is my favorite wild ale from Russian River. I have been lucky enough to have multiple vintages of Supplication. Based on my experience, the vintages are very consistent and age well for several years. Batch 4 is drinking really well these days."
"D - Loaded with layers upon layers of complexity in every facet... By far my favorite Russian River ""tion"" to date... Excellent brew and a challenge to even the most developed palette..."
"D- As I said earlier, I will need time to warm up to this style, but it was really good... just unusual for me."
"One of my favorite beers of all time, even with its flaws. I'd be a happy, happy man if this were the only beer I'd ever be allowed to drink. For all I know, all they serve in Heaven is Supplication! Even though no individual aspect of this beer is the best in show, it's one of my absolute favorite beers to drink, ever."
"This beer is amazingly complex and delicious. Finally a sour I could drink every day and it has to be one that's expensive and comes nowhere near the midwest. I've got another coming in trade and will definitely seek this one out again."
"A good sour that comes together nicely, but I probably should have let it age a little longer to help the flavor really come out."
"mouthfeel - very light body. great carbonation. a bit puckering."
"O- One of my all time favorite beers. Ever since I had this with my friends at RR, it's been on of ""those"" beers for us. Wish it was cheaper (and easier to find), but I'll take what I can get."
"Overall-If this were available in Tx and not so expensive I would drink one every night. The sour and tartness of this beer did not fright me off like others sours I've tried. Crazy drinkable. If you can get this beer and haven't tried it yet, go get it now."
"This is a terrific beer that has aged tremendously. I'd have to say it's my most successful cellaring experience to date."
"Pours a light amber/brown. The nose is big cherries, a yeastiness, red wine, grapes and a bit of straw funkiness. The cherries and the funkiness come together in a slightly medicinal way. Sour, tart cherries dominant the taste, intermingled with red wine, that yeastiness, a touch of grape and that straw funkiness. The body is medium but the carbonation is quite high, though it works. This isn't my favorite wild, though it is one of the better ones that is readily available. Everyone else liked it better than I did, but that is not uncommon for wilds. Solid."
"A really great wild ale with a nicely balanced and complex fruity flavour. Well built and a damn fine ale."
"This beer is truly incredible and is a pleasure to drink"
"Had this in a bottle in Oregon. It was fairly cool bottle and had the taste of eating a dark freash cherry without the pit. You do get a hint of the p.n wine barrel. This was an easy drinking sour. I would recommend it for the ladies paired with cheeses."
"Overall: Another nice sour from RR."
"O - I still love this beer and it only seems to get better with age. I just wonder how long it can go for. If this one is any indication I would say quite awhile."
"O: Reading over my review I keep thinking it sounds like I didn't really enjoy this one. I did, I always do. It was different than other bottles I've had, which is of course to be expected. Its not a perfectly balanced beer, but its an extremely enjoyable one that fully deserves the praise it gets. It really was a nice contrast to dinner, and I'm hoping it'll do some great things to my conditioning beer."
"dark mahogany, almost brown/red. like the others, the head is thin and bubbly. smell is pretty fruity...cherry, almost brown sugar. taste is nutmeg, brown sugar, cherries...definitely strong cherries, very tasty! smooth easy drinker, not too heavy at all. overall i dug it in the side-by-side."
"Mouthfeel is light to moderate with lingering aroma that you can smell in your mouth. An interesting beer for sure. One of a kind."
"I would love to have another some day. But not sure I'd have more than one in any given sitting. So I can't say it's the most drinkable beer."
"O: Much better sour than others I've tried. The sourness is there but doesn't overwhelm you in any way. The cherries set it off just enough."
"O- This is quite a beer. Tons of flavor and a nice sourness that is a staple of many Russian River brews."
"Overall: A fantastic, balanced, approachable wild ale. Lots to contemplate. Barnyard character is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Aroma presents a cherry-like sweetness while the taste of the beer is tart overall. I highly recommend this one for both the sour novice, who's trying to expose their palate to these types of beers, and also for the aficionado!"
"O: Really solid sour. Not something I would consider a session choice, but very interesting. Excellent with food, and a something I would spend the money on again in the future."
"O-A great well balanced sour. Looking forward to Temptation, but it was better than Consecration."
"D - This is an excellent, teeth chattering sour beer but something I can drink a lot of, like drinking a dry, expensive champagne without the bubbles."
"Yes, there's a reason, objectively, that there is so much hype surrounding RR. But, you can pay 2 dollars more for a 750mL of Jolly Pumpkin and support a smaller, still-growing independent producer that makes a beer that's almost as good in a very similar style."
"Sampled at RBWG 2010 from a 375mL bottle. The aroma is huge oak and Belgian yeast with definite tartness and touches of brett and lacto for sure. The flavor is big sour, plenty tart, with citrus and so much more. The oak presents itself more subtley than in the aroma with a hint of Brett presence as well. Awesome stuff!"
"Overall: I must honestly say it took me awhile to grow accustomed to it and it was a bit difficult but worth the effort. A truly well made beer."
"Pours a darkish amber/brown with a thin amount of head. The aroma right away is sour cherries followed by oak and some funk. The flavor is very complex. There is sour tart cherries and brett with oak and wine. There is also vinegar, but not too much. Its pretty sour on the palate, but not overpowering making this an enjoyable beer."
"O- Great beer, will always get it when i see it."
"Pours a nice light brown with a small tan head. Aromas of tart cherries, oak, and funkiness. Taste was nothing short of amazing..tart, dry and refreshing. Medium body with just the right amount of carbonation to make the sourness pop. A fantastic example of how a sour beer should be done. If I had access to this all the time I could see it being a regular offering in my fridge."
"Ruby colored with fruity notes that are both vibrant and delicately mixed. There's no unpleasant sharpness challenging or harming the taste. Likewise, the carbonation is just active enough to bring out the subtler notes that might otherwise be lost. Smooth and downright delicious, I can't wait to find this one on tap. Curious how it would compare to that fresh Lou Pepe 2008 I just had..."
"I first tried Supplication this February, when I split a 375 with a good friend. Tonight, I was more than eager to polish off a little bottle on my own. I will crush a 750 before the summer is over."
"I had this batch when it was fresh and it has aged wonderfully. I have had a bottle of the batch 2 every year since it was released and it never fails to satisfy. Great stuff."
"O - This is my new favorite beer. Very Drinkable. Great for a hot summer day while sitting on the back porch or anytime actually."
"Bottle courtesy of GRG1313. Batch 04x04. Served in my CL tulip at 53 degrees. Pours a pleasant caramel hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a one inch, dense and creamy off-white head embedded with tiny ringlets. Textured bands of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses tart cherries, a buttery quality and a trace of American Oak. Cherry is much more muted in the flavor profile. There is also a vinegary and citrus character dispersed throughout. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a bright, lively carbonation, some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands and a semi-dry finish. This is a solid American Wild - not my favorite from this brewer, but quite complex and refreshing."
"This is definitely one to be sipped and savored, contemplated. Another home run from Russian River."
"Overall, another nice sour offering from Russian River.  Although this one is pretty straight forward sour cherries on oak, it's nice."
"O - Overall, this is an excellent wild. Very easy to drink and quite tasty. Good stuff."
"overall: great"
"Pours a hazy brown with some slight burgandy tints and nice foamy throughout the session. A lot of floaties but good. Nice funk in the aroma with some cherries, raspberries and wine-like whiffs. Nice. Tough on the esophogus after each sip for me....right to the finish. Tart but not overly distracting. Some cherries and more tart fruit in the taste. Nice. Dry and clean finish. Salivation on the buds after each sip. Overall I thought this was a great wild ale and a great starter if someone is looking to try the style. Not overly sour and pleasant to sip."
"O: With the mythical proportions that Russian River has ascended to, I guess I set the bar too high and ended up disappointed. All of this gibberish about this brew proving beer had no limits and is an American national treasure overhyped this to an absurd level. Sure it was a good beer, but it is not the second coming of Christ in beer form like a lot of people on BA seem to believe. It also doesn't help that this beer cost $12 (american). I will say try it if you're feeling indulgent, but don't invest in the hype."
"O- Russian River has cemented it's reputation as one of the best (if not the best) producer of American wild ales, period. I tried not to judge this brew against my preferred vehicle of sour beers (Flanders Reds) and consider it within the parameters of its style. Personal preference aside, this was a masterfully brewed beer that is positively bursting with originality and flavor."
"Overall - Oh where have you been all my life. Now, I have a ways to go in terms of Wilds, Lambics, and Guezes. I have had several in my time. I still need to try all sorts of beers yet to qualify as some sort of sour expert. However, with that written, I must state this plainly as I can. This is the best Wild Ale I have ever had and one of the top 5 beers I have ever had."
"O- Intriguing, clean yet complex, sour flavors and dry finish beckon you to keep sipping"
"I felt this beer was going to be a challenge for me to get down. Since I'm not a big fan of sour ales if this wasn't a Russian River brew I probably would have just overlooked it. The beer poured out as a sparkling red color with some in there too. The head was fizzy and white and then vanished pretty quickly. The smell of this beer was big, it's stung the nostrils like sex panther a little bit. The smell of tart cherries and oak wood mixed with a big amount of wild yeast explode on nose. The taste of the beer is interesting too, The sour cherries almost make your lips pucker, the sour subsides and leaves you with a nice oak and vanilla smoothness. The mouthfeel is little thin, but has enough flavor to balance out the whole thing. Overall it's a good sour beer, I'm trying to give it praise despite the fact I don't care for the style. I feel that people who enjoy these will definitely enjoy this one too."
"O-well this is almost perfect. this is an absolutely and amazing and unique beer. i love it so much. i'd like the initial hit to be more powerful, but the after-taste is so strong and long lasting. its definitely very dry. i would recommend this to sour lovers and non believers alike."
"O: A+ Worth 25 bucks...."
"O-overall i was very pleased with this beer. Wished the cherry flavor was just alittle more prominate. I think santification is still alittle better but i wouldnt hesitate to trade for this brew again."
"Overall - a superb sour. I can pick out the cherries and the pinot noir barrel aging fairly easily. It's not as funky as some others, which is fine because the flavors are very well balanced. Definitely seek out RR beers if you can."
"O- This is an amazing sour, absolutely surpassed my expectations, out of all the “tions” from Russian River that I’ve tried this takes the cake, now to hunt down some more bottles."
"Pours bright brown with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the surface. Visible carbonation. Smell is yeasty. Big cherries. Taste has a big hit of tartness up front. Balanced with just a touch of background sweetness. Sour cherries are very noticeable but don't totally dominate the flavor. Puckering tartness ends with a dry hit of bitterness. Tons of flavors all over the place. Oak. A bit of herbal hops. Lots of barnyard yeastiness. The wild strains are obvious, although it's hard for me to describe the flavors they contribute (except for some sourness) since I've had very few wild beers. Great well carbonated mouthfeel. Full to medium bodied. Crisp with a lip smacking tart and dryish finish. Great tart and slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this is pretty great stuff. I paid a lot for it but I'm definitely glad I tried it and will check out the rest of their wild ales if I can find them."
"Overall: This is a very well-made beer that I'd like to have more of if the price was right. Most of the elements in this beer tend to balance themselves out so that nothing is particularly overwhelming except that the sourness is always there. It does deserve to be priced higher than many other beers - considering the effort put into it. Any sour lover could hardly do better than this one. It's worth the effort to obtain one and I look forward to it's next arrival in Philly."
"Overall, tasty tasty. I love Russian River wilds."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, really nice for my first sour."
"This beer continues to impress me and it is my favorite. Some time in the bottle really does magic to this. Another pop from the cork, suppy is a brownish red with some orange up towards the light. A cream colored shell of foam stays on top throughout with nice sheets that stick. Smell is straight out lacto with sour cherry at this point. Pungent with leather and I guess you can say malt from the base. A bretty sting with some warming. The cherry has not left, it only got more aggressive. Taste is just oh my god, I love this beer. Cherry flavor with sourness that knocks socks off. I gotta say, Sup does wonders in the bottle if you have a good batch of it and give it some time in a OK enviornment. Sometimes, warm is your friend. Lacto soaked cherry with pedio/sach/brett in that order, no fooling. Supp Vs Sanct, you can tell the difference, especially in the newer Sanct versions with all brett, lacto shines here. Im babbling. All I can say is lay these suckers down if you got em, they will sour till your hearts delight, much more than the batch 4 Temptation which I think is dwindling. I love it."
"Hazy soft rose color with a whitish head. This beer gave much sour cherry and an oaky woodiness in the nose with lesser amounts of green apple and horse blanket. Quite intriguing and inviting. Less cherry in the flavor, but this gave way to other fruits... maybe a touch of apricot, more apple, and a light berry tartness. Bubbly carbonation lifted the light body. A fine beer indeed. Paired nicely with blue types of cheese."
"Hazy deep orange color. Wonderfully tart aroma of sour cherry and funk. Sour cherry flavors and slight oakiness come out as it warms. Sour finish that lingers on the tongue. Absolutely Love it! Could drink this ale every day if I was independently wealthy."
"O: There's a lot to say about this beer, but really it's just so well made. The wood does this brew a real honor by taking would could be seen as too bretty/tart/sweet, and making it a refined offering. All the flavors are in check, but they aren't exactly conservative either. I'd love to hear what a master's palate would say of this one, because I think there's far more in there than a laymen can give credit for. I'd come back to this one after more ""education""."
"The taste was very tart (not overly sour) initially. I was pleasantly surprised by the sweetness. Cherries were the predominant flavor, with a subtle oakiness. The finish was dry and refreshing, with medium carbonation. Overall this was a really tasty and satisfying beer."
"4.0 D: Good, solid all around beer."
"I could go on and on about this beer, it really was a great experience to drink it and I really wish I could get this on a weekly basis. I can say that I am a fan of sours now and look forward to trying more but at the same time the bar is set very high!"
"Supplication pours a rose color with a bit of head retention and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is slightly sour with a nice fruity cherry note, as it warms, a very distinct wine and funky side emerges. The taste has the cherries and a mild mild oak wine presence which is a nice counterpoint to the cherries and tartness, with the same character emerging as the beer warms. This beer is extremely light and refreshing and complex. Very enjoyable beer, especially for the summer. Very light and very well carbonated with a nice bite. Have not quite gotten into sours, but this is a very good beer to get going with."
"Overall: This beer is a real treat. It's one of those endlessly complex and delicious beers where even when you write too much in your review, you still haven't properly described all the beautiful things going on in the flavor. When you get the chance to drink this beer, take it."
"this is described by RR as ""Brown Ale aged in French oak Pinot Noir barrels with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and sour cherries."" it was also my first real sour (i.e. not the duchesse or monk's flemish.) i decided this was the place and beer to try it with. i wasn't disappointed. it was really, really good. it's hard for me to evaluate it because of my lack of sour expertise, but i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to trying other RR sour offerings that i brought back with me from seattle."
"O: I typically don't like sour beers or lambics but I really enjoy this beer. Exceptional."
"O - Always a favorite of mine when it comes to sours. Very complex and refreshing. Im so lucky to have this beer available at all times."
"Overall, very very good, and so refreshing! A testimony to what subtle can be... it is sour but a lot of other things too. I love it. 4.5/5"
"O- I have read and read and read about Russian River this, Russian River that. Well, there is a reason people are talking, this might be the best beer I have ever had."
"Pours a slight hazy reddish brown into the glass with bright Red highlights. Aromas of tart cherry and dark fruit and oak. Flavor is a burst of intense but smooth sourness delivered nicely with the carbonation with a bit of fruitiness and faint oak. Very soft malt flavors stay on the tongue as it dries out on the finish. Not my ""Style"" of beer, but starting to intrigue me more and more. Just like 2IPA's did a couple of yrs. ago, now they are 1 of my favorite styles. Maybe sours will be next?"
"Not my style but highly enjoyable to say the least. Would seek this out again, and continue aging a few to see the effects. Californians - you are lucky. Very, very lucky."
"O: Such a cool beer, but to be honest I’m not sure my palette is mature enough to fully appreciate it…but I know what I like! Can’t wait to try more of these varieties."
"This beer is definately worth the 18 bucks I paid for a small 375 ml bottle."
"Another half a bottle courtesy of Goblinmunkey7. Score unchanged. This is legendary. I want to write love letters to this beer."
"While I don't like having to struggle with the cork, it is a minor inconvenience when it comes to drinking this nectar. Pour resulted in a two finger head of foam with just a little sediment. I guess I should have poured it a bit slower. Nice lace that clings well from beginning to end. Color is a slightly hazy 9 on the SRM beer color chart. I think I am the fault of most of the haze. Smell is a rich complex palate of wonderful aromas. Sweet tree fruit smells, pear, apple, and cherry. Tart smells of mint leaf, and anise. Taste is a grand mixture of pleasing flavors of cherry, caramel, grapefruit, sour red grapes, anise, malt, and a hint of wood. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, much like butter melting in your mouth with zing added for effect. I would like another, but my wallet would scream and so would my head from the rush of alcohol."
"D - An excellent beer that really show off the potential for non traditional sour beer matured in barrels. Nothing is wasted or excessive here; the cherry contributes a great deal of complexity while the wine barrel aging is a background note that briefly pops out as a distinctive, vinous character in the finish. The sourness and bone dry finish both work to enhance the drinkability of an already very quaffable beer."
"Finish: Wow! Dry and complex. An immaculate beer that offers plenty of texture and surprises. One of the better beers in the world."
"O- This is my second of the Russian River sours, and this one was more enjoyable than Consecration to me overall. Love the use of the cherries and the nice oak presence as well. A fantastic example of a wild and a great introduction to wilds as well. Very well done."
"I brought back three of these from Colorado, and now I am really regretting not bringing back more..."
"O: I love this beer and I hope to get my hands on some older batches of this."
"My favorite sour. Aroma is filled with cherries and apples. Taste is the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a sour. But it's not over the top sour. It's basically the most balanced sour I've ever tasted. This is only one of a few sours that I would completely feel comfortable (and excited) about drinking pint after pint. Seriously, I would drink multiple pints of this in a row! I love this beer!"
"This beer pours a rich, brownish amber in color, very reminiscent of cherry wood. It featured a nice cream colored head which laces the glass and sticks to the sides. The aromas consist of primarily sour cherry with a light grape like sweetness. It has a good amount of funk but it's hard to tell which is winning, the cherry or the funk. I'm glad the sweetness is allowed to show past the cherry. The flavors are very sour and dry. You definitely get a boatload of cherry, oak, and nice funk. The tartness is in your face initially before letting the other flavors take place. The most impressive aspect is how the flavor resonates even five minutes later. It leaves behind a really, really nice aftertaste of all of the flavors meshed together in perfect harmony. Overall this is a very, very good wild and I definitely prefer it over Consecration."
"o-I bought another one to cellar, and I am damn excited. This beer should do quite well with some time. This is a great example of a wild ale."
"Great beer, stoked to have access to it."
"All three of these batches are fabulous. The 4 was definitely my favorite as it exhibited all of the characteristics you look for in a sour in spades. One of the best beers I have ever had."
"Just noticed I made it all the way though this review without saying ""sour""... Its Sour folks!"
"Pours a beautiful red orange with no head but some lacing is left. Aroma is of cider, vinegar and cherries. Taste follows the nose, tart in the best way possible. Leaves cherries in the finish. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and dry but not too dry. This is an excellent wild ale!"
"A great beer at this age, but I'm not sure if aging it longer will do it any good."
"This is a very nice brew. The sourness isn't that prevalent, but it meshes very well with all of the flavors. The fruit flavors make this very refreshing and leave you wanting more."
"Overall. Blown away by this one. The wine barrel aging, sourness and vinegar, and light sour cherries really work well together."
"Overall an exceptional beer, and truly worthy of its praise. Easily my favorite Russian River offering to date."
"Beautiful Noir qualities to this brew. You definitely get some of the sweet wine barrel, literally consumed by tart bing like cherries. Tart, acidic, a touch of funk, with some dark grapes and an excellent vinous character. The taste is sharp and sweet. A bit of pucker and some sweet fruits, oak, and those sweet sweet cherries. Carbonation was great for this beer. I wish there was a bit more bite in the flavor. Don't know why i'm hatin', it was delicious, just could have used a little more bite or intensity to set it over the top. Overall, this was one of the best brews of the day. Thanks again chuck! I have another one that I got as an extra from a great trader doverhills (Thanks Mark!) so I am looking forward to trying this batch with a little age, cheers!"
"This is a great beer. The combination of sweet fruit and funky sour is fantastic. It's like a cross between a fruit beer and a wild. And I think the taste is the weakest aspect of it! Wish I could drink it more often."
"o/d- overall i love it, my favorite sour so far, drinkability- is good its easy to take down,smooth and light"
"Drink - Very carbonated. Tartness hits you hard, but calms down. Lingers in the mouth."
"Overall- Great beer, always love it!"
"Excellent overall. I liked it better than temptation and consecration and maybe even better than Sanctification, which to this point had been my favorite sour-ish beer. Glad I have another couple of bottles"
"Definitely something I want to drink more often than the yearly bottle I currently get."
"Overall, a wonderful American Wild. I'd love to see more breweries explore the style the way Russian River has."
"Overall, Supplication is a very interesting, complex and delicious beer. Definitely glad I was able to get hands on a bottle."
"O: The overall value of this sour wild ale is incredible. For the amount that is made of this sour, its pretty impressive"
"O: Another quality product. Something I'd go back to in that $10+ range again & again."
"CHEERS"
"Overall I'm not blown away y this beer but can appreciate it for what it is. At the same time I'm a bit surprised that this came in so high all-time on the rankings. I'd grab for a Blind Pig from Russian River much quicker than I would for this."
"O: This is one of my favorite Wild Ales on the market, and it’s nice that RR brews this and releases it a few times a year. Always nice to have a fresh back to drink and then a few to age."
"O: A nice treat to pop open on my birthday. An easy drinking beer with great flavor. Would be a nice beer to have on hand for certain occasions, but not something I want to drink everyday...but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"Sour, but not overly so. Not much sweetness on this one. Pretty darn good."
"D: I love RR sours but I think this has to be my least favorite. Trying to age some to see if it gets any better but right now id put it in 4th behind Compunction, Temptation, Consecration and Sanctification."
"O: Probably one of the best wild/brett ales I've had. Very delicious. I can't really complain about anything on this one."
"O - This is a very well crafted brew and worthy of being called one of the best beers in the world. One of my first sours and was a little worried if I would like it or not and its great!"
"Overall: If you are in search of a sour beer, this is one of the tops, This will light your taste buds up like licking a 9 volt battery!And thats about it, not much for flavor, price point is off by a mile, and this is something that you would rather have a sample of, not too many people would sit down and enjoy this beer IMO, this is one you split between 5 or 6 people just to say you've had it."
"Overall: Simply amazing!! I had wanted to try this beer for a very long time, and upon finally getting the chance, i was worried i would have built it up too much in my expectations. Certainly not the case though, this is a stellar beer. I love the complexity that this beer holds, and i love knowing how much time and effort went into making it. I will without a doubt be getting this again in the near future..."
"O - This beer is truly a treat and one that I will be seeking out in earnest."
"O:Had this on tap a few times at Monk's and I always seem to pick one up when I go to the bottle shop. Definitely my favorite of the -tions. The only bad thing about this beer is that due to the sourness and acidity I wouldn't really want to drink more than one. Overall a great beer!"
"Pours an amber color, good clarity with active carbonation. A clingy white foam is very active at first, but dies down to sticky lacing fairly quick. The aromas are very cool, lots of funk and sour fruit. The taste is decadent, very mellow with active bubbles that fizz on first contact with the tongue. Quickly the onset of sour cherry and orange peel take over with a very complex finish that leaves a lasting and changing funk in your mouth. Nice acidity, not overpowering, very well crafted sour."
"O: A solid beer I always enjoy. Today's no exception. As good as they make them in America. For $6 a glass, I'd drink this more often. At $12 a bottle, I'm not buying one of these too frequently. Definitely worth a try though. Seek it out, drink it, enjoy. 4/5"
"Narrative: The clicking roll and an L2 against an L3 vertebrae makes a percussive click clack with a certain panache that only Briscoe Wellingstone, berryspy extraordinaire can evoke. Some errant sour juice dribbles from the guard's mouth, but Kiwis weren't fit to guard a hostile embassy. He was hired as a young tart currant, trained in the most hostile vineyards, and was raised a pedigree in solitude for 15 months. Only this sour aging could create an agent of such brackish authority, such swiftly petulany candor, bitterly imparting a smooth sourness to the political fruit world. He rounds the foyer of the Tropicanaria, resolute to steal the famed cherry pit of Largesse. A hardened fruit son of a bitch, but with a slippery smoothe discountenance, lovable, yet stern in his demeanor. Mr. Wellingstone peppers the security cameras during an arching slide across the marble flooring. The pit was obtained, a sour finish left in the museum curator's mouth."
"O: This one has earned its place as one of the best sours on the market. Amazing stuff!"
"Overall: I am loving sours and this sure helps my experience with them. I liked Consecration more than this but this is still a solid brew. I would gladly take more. I cant wait to see how the other one in my ""cellar"" matures."
"I've had all 3 of the regular RR sours several times. This is my favorite. I always wonder how hyped this beer would be if it were brewed once with cherries from some tree that died."
"Overall - Fantastic, I have been slowly getting more and more into this style and after having this one I am hooked. Absolutely a world class beer."
" This is a great beverage. Russian River's experimentation and attention to detail pays off."
"To wrap this up(in comclusion) this beer is medium bodied with ample carbonation. It has a syrupy mouthfeel and a mouthwatering sweet/sour flavor profile acompanied by all of complexities that you'd look for in a beer as deserving as this."
"D: After having Batch 005 on tap yesterday, I'd say the fresher this beer, the better. When the beer is fresh, the fruit flavors or more vibrant, but the sourness and funkiness levels are a little less abrasive. This beer is delicious at any age, but out of the three batches I've had, I'd rank them in the following order (best to worst): 003, 005, 004"
"O: One of my all time favorite sours. So many great clean and distinct layers of flavor make me keep wanting to take another sip. Exceptional ale that I simply can not get enough of."
"T: Huge sourness with some sweet malts in the background. The finish is dry with a hint of nuttiness. The sourness is a combination of apple cider vinegar and sour cherries for me and is incredible. This is such an amazing beer."
"O: would drink again on a special occasion."
"(forgot to write down the batch number on this bottle, but i am pretty sure it is the same as the one i have in cellar.)"
"Overall: Very good well balanced beer. I could feel the sourness in my jaw with each sip I took. Another great sour from Russian River."
"Wish I could say more but I only got this out of respect for how well regarded RR sour beers are. And to be honest, this is fantastic. Met be some type of sour that I don't agree with, but it's non existent here. Supremely enjoyable."
"O - If you are a fan of the style this is a must have beer. If you are just getting into the style this may be a bit intense but should give you some good hindsight about the style. This is a very well crafted brew and worthy of being called one of the best beers in the world."
"Wine-grape like flavors, light vinegar, sour cherries, caramel, hint of vanilla, not-quite-ripe tropical fruits, low acidity with some champagne effervescence, light grassy and funky brett, some wood. Tart but not over the top; Good sweetness to balance, quite a round pillowy body for the style, makes it drink like a charm. Tasty and worth the acclaim - glad to have it."
"D: Fantastic sour meant to be sipped just like a fine dry red."
"Overall, very complex beer. I enjoy sours a great deal and this is the best I've had for the style. Sometimes it's nice to have a sour that has more sweetness but this has a very winelike character and lots of different flavors."
"Fantastic wild ale here, would have this again anytime with food or without. Balanced, not overpowering, great body, tasty brew!"
"Overall this beer is strange yet amazing at the same time. It's quite a unique beer that you will either love or hate and I love it. It's so far from what most people consider the norm yet it is absolutely delicious. One of my new favorites."
"wonderful, wonderful beer. perhaps a bit too sour for the uninitiated, and perhaps a bit too fruity for the sour-lovers, but a great balance and an impressive beer, now only if I could get it more readily."
"Batch 003 bottle The beer pours a nice golden-caramel color with a thin head that diminished quickly. Smell: tart, cherry-apple aroma with undertones of oak. Taste, nice and complex: Sweet, smooth entry leads into a tart, semi-funky cherry and sweet apple. Oak and yeast flavors become apparent on the finish; Drying and semi-puckering. Very nice beer"
"I'm a learner in the sour department, but this beer converted me to the style. I enjoyed it and rushed out the next day to procure another bottle. This will be a beer I'll seek out as a regular whenever it's available."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light, carbonated and bubbly. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a great wild ale. Really nice balance between fruit and sour. I've got both Temptation and Consecration and am interested to see what I like the best."
"This is by far the most delicious wild ale I've ever had. Keyword here is ""refreshing."" Balancing out the sour notes are sweet stone-fruit and assertive oak. Describing the sour flavor is more difficult. I'm not getting much of an acetic vibe here, the pungence is more easily ascribed to whitish grapefruit rind without the bitters. Vivid carbonation really props up the intensity of this beer. Certainly worth the price, and that's saying something for me. Superb."
"Overall awesome beer, great tart sourr flavors, nice Brett and wild flavors, nice cherry flavor and touch of oak."
"Drinkability - I wish I had another. A very unique beer that doesn't feel like a beer at all. the fruity sweetness with tart sourness blends well in a light consistent beer."
"D: This beer is very solid, very crisp and smooth. It's ""sour"" but not overwhelmingly sour, but it's present so expect some bite to it. Although I don't have many sour ales under my belt, I'd say this is one of the better examples."
"O- This is a great sour and I am very happy to have another bottle to save for a later date. I am just blown away by this beer."
"M: Extremely bubbly and carbonated, though light on the palate. Overall, a wonderful mouth feel for the style."
"wow. always awesome. not for the closed-mind or faint at heart. this review is for batch 005x4. gentle pour reveals a reddish brownish orangish beer with an off-pink-white head that hangs in there and leaves lots of lace as it goes. nose is vanilla, cherry, leather, earth, wood, cherry pie, nut, black cherry, raspberry, lactic, vinegar and funk. brilliant. hands down, miles ahead of the competition in the US. in the taste, everything is in near perfect harmony, with dark cherry and nut flavors rearing their heads throughout, leathery wine barrel notes midpalate and a nice, funky sourness that wraps everything up, leaving the palate very cleanly while just a hint of spice and heat/warmth linger. medium full body that never gets sticky. finish is just hot enough to amplify the experience and really add some depth to the character. just wonderful, classy and sophisticated. this is the brewing art at it's finest for sure."
"I think this is the best experience I've had to date with this beer, so I'd definitely recommend aging a bottle for a year and a half. This is the most balanced sour beer I can remember having, with all sorts of flavors and smells to pick up that can too often be covered up by a cloying sourness. I always told my parents I wanted to be a Blue Angels pilot when I grew up, but now I just want to be Vinnie Cilurzo."
"Overall I quite like this beer. Really wished I lived closer to where this was sold on the shelves."
"D: A great brew to say the least. This is balanced in its tartness, impressive in both its breadth and depth of flavor, and yet, remains distinct from the sour ales of Belgium. I couldn't justifiably classify this Lambic nor flanders ale; it is its own style. Definitely worth a try if you are fortunate enough to have access to RR's brews, as it is a great example of America's ability to take the best parts of other brewing traditions while adding our own flair."
"Overall: Excellent taste with a fair measure of sourness. one of my first introductory sours that I'm finally reviewing. Russian River always comes through on the sours."
"Poured into a Russian River ""tion"" glass because I will not have it any other way. Pours a rather hazy golden apricot color with a bright white head. Smell like a goddamn delicious river in the hills of Russia. Some funk and hints of peach behind some fragrant cherry notes. Taste is fortunately the same and this is a rather refreshing beverage. Spot-on carbonation with lighter medium body. Thanks Matt!"
"If youre reading this because you dont know if you should get supplication. Do like I did. Get one every year. By the fifth year you'll like. it. This is some good asss shit."
"Overall - Why did I only bring six back with me.... This is an outstanding wild ale. Crisp and clean, tart on your tongue. Just try to name all of the smells and flavors you experience with this offering."
"Drinkability is good on this one. Low ABV and a great mouth feel are pluses but even though it tastes great I don't think I could take more then 2 of these at a time because of the mouth puckering sour sensation."
"Mouthfeel is acidic, but not overly so. The feel is balanced by some sugary character and the fruits somehow. Drinkabiility is very, very good for such a strong, sour beer - the balance mentioned earlier is a boon to this category. Your mouth doesn't get killed by the acidity in this as much as in some other strong sours, and it lets the beer be drinkable for a long period of time. If you haven't had a wild ale, have this and you'll be sold on the style."
"O: Simply an outstanding beer; one that disappeared from my glass quickly, and certainly one that I will be picking up again."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: I love this beer. I think it's my favorite out of the three readily available Russian River sours (although it is very close). I pick this up whenever I see it."
"O: This beer packs a punch. Sour noobs be aware this is EXTREMELY sour. Very drinkable and perfectly balanced between the fruits, the acidity, the funkyness. This is an exceptional offering from Russian River, definitely one of my favorite beers of all time."
"O - Well, what more can I say? This was an amazing beer, easily one of the most flavorful, complex, and nuanced I've ever had. Another home run from Russian River!"
"Overall- This beer is a testament to the idea that brewing is as valid an art as any. As a beer with unbridled complexity that leaves you wanting more after each sip, Supplication is a memorable experience that is well worth the high price."
"Overall: It is worth all the hype and all the time it took me to get ahold of this one."
"I don't understand why there's minimum 250 word for a review. some beers don't need a lot of word"
"MF/D- Dances on the palate every so lightly, carbonation helps the flavors coat your entire mouth. Very drinkable and at only 7%, can enjoy it over and over."
"The 4 is better than 5. The age defineitly does this body good."
"D. Very drinkable, delicious - I'd definitely seek this out again; one of my favorite sours"
"D-this is very simple and straight forward but still very tasty. the flavors blend together very well and it goes down so smooth. it has a great sourness to it with virtually no acidity."
"It's medium in body with a mild carbonation, but it's a highly drinkable sour and it's a really top notch example of the style. Not really puckeringly sour, but sour enough and the cherries add an extra level of complexity. I'm definitely glad I've got a few more of these tucked away in the cellar."
"Batch 005X5"
"starts off with an explosion of bubbles that help spread the funky goodness. not very over powering in the sour as the hints of oak begin to take the place of the cherry flavor. lingering oak and tart finish. well balance for a sour. very interesting. not sure i'm convince of being a sour fan yet but i wouldnt mind drinking this one again."
"Pours a brownish red with a thick, beige head that dissipates leaving a filmy layer at the top. Smell is of spoiled cherries, hints of oak, and earth. Taste is quite vinegary, almost too much so. Sour cherries and heavy lacto. There is a light funk and light lingering biter on the throat. Pinot very much shines through on the second sip. Finishes very dry, leaving my mouth a bit parched. Heavy alcohol burn on the swallow which is surprising for a beer of only 7%."
"D: Very drinkable, throughly enjoyed this one."
"A slightly cloudy brown amber color with a modest fuzzy white cover and lots of lacing. The aroma is undoubtedly floral cherry with a subtle lemony air. If you enjoy sours this is pretty nice. The flavor initially says sour sour sour! Yikes. It has a definitive Alka-Seltzer quality with cherries on steroids. It's a bit lemony with granny apple cherry tart bite. Quite a lip twister with a hyperactive carbonation that keeps a lively feel in a mid-light bodied fizzy brew. It's pretty drinkable if you go for this sour stuffn and I do. Nice."
"Poured from bottle (batch 005X3) into snifter glass. Pours murky brown / hazy amber with a minor, then dissipating head leaving very thin lacing throughout the session. Nose is big and soft, lots of vinous type notes. Cherries are still vibrant in this one. Funky, oaty, lactic acid, oak, vinegar, tart cherries, wild yeast, and sour nose. On taste, this is how to do a cherry sour. Softened acidity. The oak comes across to prop up the cherry notes. Medium body with some graininess and some sharp, but soft carbonation. The finish is very tart and dry. This is a great sour beer for sour beer lovers. Top 50 material for me? Not for me, but wow what a beer! Respect."
"D - This is a really outstanding wild ale. I'm glad I finally got a chance to try one."
"Pours a clear red color with white head. Lots of carbonation bubbling from the bottom at first but eventually it stops. Smells of typical wild critters along with some indistinguishable fruit notes. Taste is very sour and sweet at the same time. The flavor sits on the tongue for a bit and livens up the mouth. Has some wine-like qualities to it, but not really like a pinot. The mouthfeel is intense as it constantly has that tingling going on. Drinkability is good for a sour. I wouldn't drink these all day long, but very nice. My favorite RR sour of those I've tried (temptation, consecration)."
"Drinkability - Well it cost a pretty penny to get out here. I think the depth/cost/sourness would prevent me from drinking more than one. Definitely intend on savoring this one. Really impressed with my first taste of Russian River."
"I got this from Mikesgroove a while ago in a trade. Thanks again Mike! Poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy brown with a slightly red hue to it. Starts with about a finger of fizzy head that dissipates quickly. At first I kind of just thought this smelled medicinal. I was put of at first and thought I was getting set up for a big disapointment. Once I got into it a little bit sweet cherries reveal themselves as an overtone to the aroma with a nice balance of oak and bret funk. It finishes with a slightly tart vinegar aroma to it. World class flavor on this. Cherries right up front; being slightly tart and a bit of sweetness to finish it out. Woody oak notes surround the pallet here. The feel is kind of dry with lively carbonation. Really nothing to shake a stick at here. Overall, Russian River seems to make some of the most drinkable American sours on the market. File this under perma-want."
"Mildly acidic with a prickly carbonation is absolutely perfect, this beer is insanely drinkable. The alcohol is unnoticeable to the palate. It drinks very similar to a good pinot noir as the wine characteristics truly shine in this beer."
"Another knock-out punch from Russian River."
"The best American Wild Ale I've sampled to date. Funky, complex, sour, but altogether well-balanced and superbly drinkable."
"WOW. This beer was without a doubt like nothing I had ever had before... hard to tell at times if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I am leaning toward good but really struggled to finish with the overpowering flavors eventually getting to me. Quite a bit too much sour for me to enjoy finishing the entire bottle let alone having another."
"this is a beer that i could drink all day"
"All in all, this is a very sour brew. Not really my style. It's a good beer, but not my style. Sours have never really made it up my alley. Good to try if you like tart brews"
"My first foray into the world of sours was extremely successful. A very unique beer everyone should try at least once. I highly recommend this expertly-crafted brew."
"Drink- Outstanding by itself but with the right dessert for me could be magical. The cherries and the bubbles are like a nice white wine. Vinnies background is very evident in the sours he does."
"D: This was a great wild ale, with super sour and tart scent and taste. It had a light and fizzy body, which I normally don't like, but it worked well for the style. Alcohol wasn't noticeable either, so this was really not that difficult to drink. But like most wild ales, this beer is really meant to be sipped. Not sure how age might help this one, but I thoroughly enjoyed it fresh."
"D - Definitely one to sip slowly and enjoy. Makes me want to travel to California more often."
"This is a very tasty beer. It builds on the Belgian bruin style, with a foundation of bacteria-produced sourness and cherries. But aging in pinot noir barrels gives this its lovely spicy varietal element that is unique and delicious (OK, I like pinot)."
"Closest to a perfect beer as I've ever had. As enjoyable as Temptation for me."
"Smell is not spectacular but the taste is very good for this style. Oak smell and the sour taste make this beer quit good. Cherries far away. This is not my style as you may have noticed but not bad."
"Overall, wonderful experience from RR. This one lives up to the hype."
"Drinkability: I love the sour, fruity, and funky notes, but the red wine and tannins are a little out of control. It limits the overall enjoyment. Beer should taste like beer, this one tastes too much like wine."
"Pours a reddish with thin white head.  Smells like oak, cherries with some sourness. Tastes like sour cherries, slightly tart, sour finish. You can taste the wood in there as well, very good beer. Drinkability is high, mouthfeel is good, I could drink a lot of these if they distributed to Indiana, that and if they were cheaper."
"The CPJ"
"D- Thankfully I don't come across this often so I can honestly write that I will drink it every opportunity I get. Really excellent. The funky brett flavor just shines in this brew. Smooth and tart. Complex and well balanced all around."
"D: this is a great beer that I could drink a lot of. The acidity would be the only thing keeping me from drinking it all night."
"D: I could drink this beer all day. I really enjoyed this beer but the main issue is the price. I know that price is not part of drinkability so I did not mark down my rating in this category, but it is an extremely expensive beer and due to that fact I feel it is a great beer to try here and there but not something I would really go after again."
"Pours a lovely ruby red color with a very light, filmy head. Mild sweet & sour aroma; nice hints or orange. Very flavorful taste of orange, cherry, and lime. The finish is very sweet & sour, with a similar yet mild aftertaste. Surprisingly, there's very little bitterness here. Light- to medium-bodied, with mild carbonation. Smooth, and quite drinkable."
"This is batch 04X1. This beer pours a nice copper amber color with a frothy white foam that degrades to a thin layer but stays that thin layer throughout the consuming of this beer. This beer has the funk that is so sought after in many of the sours that I know. There is a citrus sour that comes from all sorts of bacteria. There is some cherry notes on the nose as well with some pretty decent oak notes. The taste is sour, oh so sour. The tartness of the intentional infection is not something that I know if I'm ever gonna get used to, I've really probably got to work my way up to appreciating these beers. The tart mouthfeel goes down pretty easy, it's got good carbonation for the style, and it's pretty easy to drink if I do say so. Again, it's not my style, but then again I never respected hop bombs, so maybe the time will come for me to revisit this beer."
"Another great sour ale from RR. It's got a lot of great flavor and a refreshing quality to it. Definitely want more."
"d- I like this beer and would drink this alot but the reason it isnt perfect just results in the style."
"The sour for me is overwhelming and makes this very difficult to put away. I've been working in some sour beers to get accustomed, but this is still a bit much for me."
"D= Very drinkable wish I had another to go with the first one."
"D - Pretty darn good. I prefer Temptation, but would never refuse another bottle! Try it, you won't be disapointed."
"Drinkability: Really an amazing beer and on part with the other great beers I've been fortunate enough to sample from Russian River; nice smells, amazing flavors and a roller coaster of a mouthfeel certainly give it a lot of credence, however, the strong nature of the acidity and extreme tartness is not something that I feel I would crave on a regular basis, but when the mood strikes, this is a world class offering."
"d: Highly drinkable if you are a fan of sour beers. If I had access to this beer on a regular basis I really think that I would be drinking it all the time."
"A very chill sweetness to it, along with a gritty earthiness. One of the best wild ales out there, only rivaled in its style by Bruery's oude tart w/ sour cherries."
"Drinkability: If I lived somewhere that this was readily available I would line my cellar with it. A great brew. The only thing that hindered its drinkability was knowing that once I drank it all I had no more. Gives a whole new meaning to crying in your beer."
"D - Delicious beer by RR. I really enjoyed this sour and have been slowly getting into them; with this one being the best yet."
"Mouthfeel was spot on - moderately thick, creamy carbonation and a slight drying."
"Fantastic sour, not sure if i liked it as much as Temptation. But very well balanced with great bold flavors. Loved it."
"I've gone out of my way to bring this back to Texas with me a few times and I'm homebrewing a batch to duplicate its wild nd sour character. Can there be any higher praise? This is unquestionably a world class beer."
"Lengthy sour finish. Delicious. This beer would be great with a cheese plate and some dark fruits. Each sip is seemingly palate cleansing. Did I say delicious?"
"MORE! MORE! MORE!...PLEASE!!!"
"appearance is a beautiful mahogany color, with a thin off white collar of foam. Smell is pronounced sour cherry, not much else. Taste is just the right amount of sour, without any yeasty funkiness. Mouth-feel is very smooth, nice and moist to start fading slowly to a crisp dryness. This beer is an excellent reminder of what a good beer can be, and an excellent return for me to reviewing beers."
"D: Mind blowing, had this while brewing a Pliny clone with my father, wow thanks Russian River, great brews and pushing the style envelope. I could find my self drinking many of these sours."
"D - I drink it all the time, and just wish it was more readily available. 12 bucks a bottle on the east coast is also holding this back, but I still buy it."
"The color is a medium colored amber with a typical fizzy head. Aroma is fantastic, citrus, malt, almost fruity. Flavor is also very good, quite sour with a citrus flavor, some sense of the brown ale as well. Overall one of the best sour ales out there."
"D: So nice. I'd definitely order another and will buy again when I can!"
"Definitely something I plan on seeking out in the future, I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for this on tap, too."
"D - This is a Tums required beer; so vinegary, so acidic that you'll eventually need some relief after a 375. As much as I love the flavor, this gets somewhat offensive when you near the dregs. After nearly a whole 375ml, I feel like I've stripped a coat of skin off my tongue and mouth."
"D: Fairly drinkable, very good for a sour though."
"D: This is the first sour that I've been determined to purchase again. Amazing."
"D: High for a sour in my opinion. While most sours are good for 4oz and then you're done, this one you can have a good bit more and not get tired of it. Great balance, tasty!"
"This was on the bottle list at Bar Crudo in San Francisco, I couldn't pass up the chance to try this beer (though I did see bottles of it later, I just wasn't sure that I would). Pours a golden orange colour with about a finger of white head. Nice head retention and amazing layer of lace down the side of the glass. Smells of sour cherries and apples, with some vinegar and oak as well. Flavour is quite sour. I let my friends try this beer, which then set them off on a quest to keep drinking sour beers whenever possible for the rest of the trip."
"do yourself a favor, if this bottle is available to you pick it up, if not, trade for it. You wont be disappointed. if you like sours and flanders definitely give it a try."
"Slow drinker due to the overwhelming sour/vinegar. Glad this was in a 375 mL, I don't know what I would have done with a larger bottle."
"The first sip blew both of us away as we quickly fell in love with it. My Wife who from this beer alone has joined the ranks of craft beer enthusiast, is now drinking wild ale, saisions, lambics, and Barleywines. The flavor was very sour but not to the point where it left no flavor, quit the opposite. The flavors plowed threw our taste buds with the carbonation at a perfect level to achieve this move. After my second sip I removed my self to use the washroom and came back to an empty bottle. The Wife had no look of guilt but of satisfaction. Which she now pays for with the shipping of these types of beers as it is little to find in my area."
"Drinkabilty - This is a sipper, once a year session beer. Its very good for the style but hell, i didnt even want to finish my glass let alone whole beer. Its too intense, no way i could drink 2. Its good experence, and i will drink again, probily next year."
"D: Gets easier to drink as it goes. I have to think a couple bottles would tear up your stomach though."
"Mouthfeel is dry, light, not sticky at all. A little effervescent. I couldn't session any beer this tart, but it's a pleasant, tasty beer."
"D - Despite the sourness I find it very easy to drink. Tart and sweet and an absolute joy and privilege to drink."
"Drinkability is fairly good. A ""classic"" american wild brew. Missing some intangibles from a belgian sour, lack of ""earthiness."" Overall good, but nothing to get too excited about. Not getting the hype."
"Overall this is one sour beer (like I expected anything less), but a great beer at that. RR is amazing with their sours as they are just so damn good. I might like Consecration better, but this is one great beer too."
"Batch 04x5"
"D: Perfect ! I could drink much more than RR would suggest..."
"For all the sour, it's still highly drinkable. After the medium body, nicely carbonated brew goes through it leaves you puckering for more. At 7.00%, that's not hard. Only problem is the price."
"3/4 finger brown head, quick dissipation resulting in thin broken layer on top of clear reddish brown body, small trail of very small bubbles rising from bottom of glass. Nose is a bit fruity, some oakiness, horse blanket funk, not picking up a lot of hop aromatics. Taste features a bit of cherry sweetness upfront, a bit more tart than sour, funky backend, musty, some floral hops but not much bitterness, not mouth puckering sour. Mouthfeel just on the light side of medium, pretty sticky. Drinkability is good for style but dont' want to do multiple glasses re palate fatigue. Complex and certainly recommended for fans of the style."
"D- Sharp and bitter making it tough to do more than sip a bit. Definitely couldn't drink a whole bottle"
"Not to blaspheme, and I'm sure this isn't a bad bottle, but this just didn't deliver on the promise of what I know to be a good beer. A mild disappointment."
"D: Consider me impressed. I would consider this a sessionable sour. Totally excellent!"
"Batch 003! Massive thanks goes out to gcurlow for hooking this one up for beeruser and I to tick! Served from bottle into a Sweetwater snifter. Poured bright orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, wood, fruit, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, funk, wood, tart, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew still. I have been lucky to try this one multiple times and have never been disappointed. While this one did carry a slightly different flavor and aroma there really wasn't a huge difference between the two batches I've reviewed. However, the carbonation seemed to have dropped off a little bit on this one as it was a little older. Still definitely one of my favorite AWAs out there today. 4.5 appearance/4.5 aroma/4.5 tate/4 mouthfeel/4.5 overall"
"I'm literally thinking about moving out to Santa Rosa just so I can go to the Russian River brewpub and drink this every day."
"D - A nice sour indeed. Plenty of funk and other good wild notes. Not as sour as I would have liked but I've found that to be the case with most RR sours. I like this one better than Consecration and Temptation bt not as much as some other sours out there. I would certainly drink/buy this one again if I had the chance but wouldn't go too crazy trying to get it."
"D: Very high. I would drink this by the pitcher if it were possible. A really great beer. I love sours, and this one is no exception. However, I don't think it is the sour that all others should be judged by."
" The flavor is so concentrated with fresh juiced tart cherry and light sweet flavors w/ dry tannic fruit skin notes. The mild pie-like cherry flavor is sweet and acidic at the same time giving a mildly astringent effect on the palate w/ a bit of bitterness from the hops but only slight and the oak gives a mild olive like bitter oily element to the fruity sour in the flavor. There is mild hop spice to accent all the oak and berry complexity. This is a fantastic wild ale, so surpremely drinkable which as Chris Lively said, Vinnie attempted a flavor akin to aged Orval, and he definitely achieved that. The flavor and drinkabililty go above and beyond. I was sad when I noticed it kicked in only a couple hours - so much cherry goodness."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The sourness and the tartness are well balanced. The body is light and very refreshing. A very drinkable sour beer. The beer disappeared from my glass way too fast. This beer is an American classic."
"Extremely drinkable delicious sour ale."
"The beer poured to be an amber color and it had fairly strong aroma of cherries. The taste was slightly sweet and was light in body. This beer was extraordinary and was easy to drink. I loved this beer and I would highly recommend it."
"Drinkability: An absolutely top notch beer. Each time I've had this beer I get more and more impressed with it. I highly recommend this beer to anybody that can get their hands on it."
"I was not able to write detailed notes on this one, but I plan to next time I get the opportunity to sample this one again. I am not scared of the sour just yet."
"D - Very drinkable beer, especially for a sour. Everything is so well balanced that it makes it easy to drink the whole way through. Really can't wait to stock up on a few bottles of this baby."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of alcohol, texture, and tannins. Long, smooth finish. Very enjoyable!"
"This brew pours a light burnt amber hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head with nice sporadic lacing,the smell is a combination of sour,sour cherries,red grapes,sour funk and oak,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel which is nicely carbonated and has flavours of sour red grapes first up followed by red berries,plums and finishes off with a dry sour cherry,wood,oak sour red apple bitterness which is quite dry and mouthpuckering and for me i could drink it all night if only i had more than the one bottle and overall the only thing ive got to say is that Russian River's brews should be available to our shores all the time its such a shame that this fine brewery cannot do what Rogue does and let us sample these exciting fine brews constantly other than that i really like this brew and could not knock it cheers."
"I really enjoy this beer. Nice and tart, but not overwhelmingly so. Wonderful complex aromas and flavors combine to make a highly drinkable beer that never gets old. The acidity is a little on the high side, but with sours, it's hard to complain about that. This may be my favorite American Wild Ale, as a Belgian Lambic fan, I'm usually let down by American Wilds, not the case here..."
"Lighter medium bodied, very nice carbonation which isn't overdone, plenty of dryness in the feel. Drinks incredibly well, and the alcohol is just right. I could easily drink more than one of these if they weren't so expensive."
"Batch 4 bottle. Pours a clear light red with an orange/peach tint and a fairly sustaining head. Nose is quite a lot of wet, ripe cherries, not as sour as I remembered, field-like almost, very fresh and floral. Flavor is darker sour cherries, brett, tart and long on the finish. Sour and dry, a tad bit mineral like in the mid palate. Brett is nicely intertwined and body is effervescent as with most Russian River sours. More sour and expressive than this batch was at a younger age."
"Drink- This is a sipper, let it sit and warm gradually as you work your way through the beer. It can last forever and never goes bad. But hardly what I would call easy drinking"
"D: Relatively new to sours, but this one is my favorite of the ones I've tasted to date. There's a pleasant wine and oak flavors that linger in the mouth long after the beer is gone leaving you wanting more."
"appears nearly as beautiful as possible, solid. it smells moderately of funk with a little bit of cherries poking through, however not as strong as i thought it would be. i feel like i have a cherry pie in front of me fresh out of the oven as soon as i taste it. its a muted cherry, but flavorful and tart. it feels wonderful, as when you swish it in your mouth, it just explodes with deliciousness. i feel less obligated to specify individual specific characteristics of this beer, and rather just sit back and enjoy it. seek it out, ill be enjoying a second one tonite."
"Excellent beer!"
"the taste is awesome. sour, but so so balanced. this beer is nearly perfect as far as taste. the mouthfeel is great. fun beer to drink. i guess thats the best way to describe it. definitely want again."
"Once you become accustomed to its puckering aspects, your taste buds are in for a complex, revolving treat. There is amazing flavor here, and the relatively moderate 7.5% will leave you somewhat coherent by the end of your glass. I'll be drinking this as often as I can."
"Overall: The tannin and sourness mellow as the drink warms a little, which I like. The sourness really wakes up the palate, which I also like. I could have a couple of these a night. The flavors are bold and delicious. Just flat out different, tasty, and I want more."
"The ABV even feels elegantly understated, allowing for a sippable, but endlessly dynamic ale."
"D: this is an all around great sour.. you have the nice big puckering qualities paired perfectly with cherries and just enough brett to really keep things interesting."
"Conclusion: I'm so glad I finally got to try one of these beers. Again, a huge, HUGE thank you to the guy who hooked me up with this. Between hwwty4 and tolann, I've now gotten to try two of Russian River's most highly-touted beers. Pliny the Elder absolutely blew me away. It was everything I expected and more. This did not have quite the same effect, but it was still quite enjoyable. The aromas are absolutely out of this world. One of the best wild brews I've encountered. The flavors are very nice here as well. The sourness here wasn't a problem for me; it was lightly puckering and just about right IMO. The flavors were very nice. If I could change one thing it would be to just ratchet the woodsy dryness back a bit."
"D: Overall, this is very drinkable, and if the sour complexity didn't grab the attention so well, 375ml would be gone very quickly. While it's not a ""big beer," this is certainly one to nurse; the more time you spend with it, the more you get out of it (or at least that was my experience). This is certainly one to seek out."
"D: What alcohol? It has about as much burn as an apple cider. Could have done a magnum of this in a sitting."
"T - very sour like chardonnay but refreshing with tons of carbonation and some hints of fruit"
"The flavor changes significantly with age. The taste resembles more of a Flanders Red. Puckeringly sour cherry upfront with notes of vinegar. What is lost in complexity is gain in intensity. Still an awesome beer."
"Drinkability suffers because it doesn't beg for more consumption. Great as a few ounce pour. After that, it gets burdensome."
"D: This is great beer. By all accounts this beer is delicious. I cant imagine having a lower quality version. The sourness does take a little getting used to after the initial sip but its all world class from there."
"SkÅL!"
"Another great beer from RR. When compared to Temptation, I feel that this is a less interesting but potentially more quality brew. Very very good, though again, I'm not sure if it was worth the $17 price tag (for a 375 mL). At half that price it might be the beer I buy exclusively."
"D- A world class American Wild that will become if it is not the bench mark for all American Wilds with Fruit produced on a yearly basis. A fantastic beer."
"Absolutely delicious, as was to be expected. I splurged and tried this and Russian River's Temptation over the course of a weekend, and while I preferred the subtleties of Temptation just a bit more, Supplication bowls you over with bold and complex flavors that are worth the price of admission."
"My first time pouring bottled beer into a glass but I think I got it to have a decent amount of head and it opened up to some pleasant cider aromas and cherry and malt, the alcohol is also surprisingly apparent on the nose. I was expecting a really bracingly tart beer having had my fair share of berlinner-weissbiers but this was surprisingly toned and balanced. The heaviness of the alcohol goes well to balance out the tartness of the souring bacteria. cherry and yeast are noticeable but are all welcome and quite gorgeously done. For a brett beer I detected no barnyard funk or anything like that, it was just beautifully pleasant and earthy. The aging in pinot barrels brings out some trace wine-like flavors. This really is a beautiful beer, it's not bracingly sour as I was expecting but it's so balanced between sour, and the alcohol and just everything it truly is a wonderful beer."
"This is an amazing blend of flavors and aromas, but not so dominant that it affects how easy it is too drink. Great beer!"
"Taste is very tart and funky, pretty mouth-puckering and slightly fruity although it's not overtly sweet. There's almost no barnyard funk to it which makes it a bit more drinkable. Very dry and fairly crisp finish. Very good beer."
"D: Great drinkability for a sour."
"Overall, the single best American wild ale I've ever had. Extremely complex and flavorful. All the elements work perfectly together and don't overpower. My highest recommendation."
"T- Was very excited to try my first wild ale and it didn't let me down. Thought maybe it would be a little to much, but it had great balance and good taste. The acidity to the beer probably would stop me from another bottle that night, but would drink another one anytime."
"Driinkability: I have had this beer a half-dozen times now, and it's still ringing true as one of the better Wild Ales of its kind. I have had over a liter and a half of this beer in a sitting, and I am positive I'll never do that again for several reasons, namely my digestive tract. That being said, the beer was so fantastic it was very tasty to the last drop. Sure, I tend to like the citrusy sours slightly more, but this beer is nothing short of outstanding."
"D: I would say drinkability is severely limited on cost alone, but as far as the beer itself goes, the real factor is your appreciation of very sour beers. I tend to avoid more acidic beer styles like Flanders Red, but I would consider this to be right at my limit for sourness. Medium."
"Pours an amber color with a medium creamy off-white head that has good retention. The aroma is rich and complex with grapes, cherries and oak. The taste has flavors similar to the aroma, with the cherries being extra tart, the grapes are funky and the oak is a bit acidic. The mouthfeel is smooth with moderately high acidity, and the carbonation is lively and prickly.The finish is long and sour with lingering sour cherries. Overall: A truly great sour ale."
"The taste was sour but not as sour as expected. A great sour taste that stayed all the way through. A very smooth mouthfeel with the carbonation just right. Very nice and smooth to drink. I need more of this..."
"M&D- Very smooth with a delicious sourness to it, you almost don't want to swallow it and just enjoy it in your mouth, the alcohol is very light, just an amazing beer, nothing like it out there"
"Enjoyed (understatement) at the Spinnerstown Hotel in PA. I had heard of this place and cant believe it took me so long to get there, it truly is heaven. Poured a red/brown/amber haziness into tulip with nice head and good lacing. Aroma is of citrus, wine and berries. This beer hit my mouth and it was like the sour patch kids were dancing on my tongue. Cherry and strawberry notes burst forth from the solid carbonation and leave the mouth tingling with joy. Wine and fruit in the crisp finish and I can only say it was worth the wait. Definitely give it a taste if you get the chance."
"This was my first brew from RR(thanks to my good friend Jay & his bro for importing this from Philly), and while it isn't the beer I'd most like to try from them(PtE,PtY, hint;anyone want to trade?), nor a style I try a lot, I was highly impressed as I have had my fair share of wilds and this one FAR exceeds any of the others."
"D-So sour you can't drink a ton of this but that in no way is a bad thing."
"D- A bit of a sipper, but this is absolutely stunning. This gives Jolly Pumpkin a run for their money. Very impressive."
"Drinkable, but I'm only ever having one. And at this price, there are many better offerings."
"As far as sours go, this is highly drinkable, but I will resist the urge to gulp it down and make it last."
"Supplication pours an apricot amber color with fairly good head retention and lacing. On the nose, this beer is quite vinous, showing an iimpressive array of grapes, vanilla, wine and light sour. The flavor profile replicates the nose for the most part, except I'm getting a bit more wine vinegar and sour funk. The sour component definitely dominates the flavor profile, though it's not so over the top as to be unenjoyable. This beer is hugely flavorful with no more than a medium bodied mouthfeel, and the finish is long, winey and sour. This beer has almost an electric component to the flavor profile, at least that's how the sour hits me on the finish. Drinkability is pretty good, with the alcohol nearly unnoticeable. Am not a huge fan of sours beers, but this is pretty fun to drink (though I can't imagine drinking a whole lot of it). However, I confess the sour component does seem a bit more intense on draft then I recall experiencing from the bottle."
"Probably my favorite sour around. As far as a taste review, I cant name everything in it, it is just sour tart and awesome. It has some great wine characteristics and a go to sour when I am at the pub. Russian River makes some wonderful sours but this one is on the top of them all"
"Drinkability 2.5 to 3.5"
"D: This is a sipper as the funk is strong but not overpowering on the taste. ABV is not too high at 7%, but the flavor will keep you drinking this beer slowly. Complex, sour, and very enjoyable."
"Yeah, I like this a lot. It's sour and interesting, but really nicely quaffable. A very steady and skilled brewing hand is behind this. Great Summer or Spring quencher."
"D - After drinking a few different bottles I think this is one my favorite beers to drink now ignore the price and get your hands on a bottle or two"
"Poured from a bottle I picked up at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. Poured into a chalice, showed a beautiful hazy golden with yeast visible, good frothy white head. Smell of bitter fruits, cherry slightly present in the nose, super earthy and yeasty smell. Taste was refreshing and crisp up front, sweet then balanced out by sour fruits and dry finish that left me wanting more after every sip. Fantastically crafted complex brew, one of the best I've ever had."
"D - I could drink these all night. I waited what seemed like forever to try this and it was worth every minute."
"The beer is a light reddish golden brown color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is full of cherries along with some yeast, light malts and a touch of hops.The taste is very tart and sour up front with a strong cherry flavor. There's a thin malt character and a mild hops presence. After-taste is also quite sour. If you're into the sour beers, this is a good one for you. Smooth and very crisp, light body, medium carbonation, clean and dry finish."
"One can be fortunate to come across many beers that are very good, but the beer that makes you pause and marvel upon first sip are rare indeed. Bitter cherry and oak notes drum a steady sour/tart backbeat while the yeast flavors lend a funkyfied harmony that melds into a delightful experience. Must find more."
"Great beer, excellent way to mix it up between normal styles, and I highly recommend it."
"Mouthfeel was solid but bright, spritzy on the tongue. It would be ridiculously easy to drink several pints of this if it weren't very hard to get in Alabama and not so expensive. Great stuff."
"D: Just delightful."
"T: Very easy drinking wild/sour. Not overly tart so I had no issues finishing the bottle. Probably wouldn't drink any more though as I can feel the acidity getting to my stomach. Need to land another of these, so good"
"A great wild ale, I'm glad to be getting into craft beer when this style is really being developed by american brewers."
"Supplication, by Russian River fits well into their line-up. As in it's damn near incredible. Aptly described, strong aromas of cherries and oak, with tastes to match. The beer is slightly sour tasting, but even stronger sourness to the smell. A highly refined package, and a treat whenever afforded. Russian River doesn't mess around, and neither should you. So drink Russian River. A premium beer with very classic sour notes, well aged, with a fine wood finish. (By the way, I think this is my worst review for a Russian River beer, so really, if you have the chance drink everything you can by them)"
"D- highly drinkable if your into the sour side, very addictive"
"I had been wanting to drink this one to celebrate passing the bar exam, and although I have a bottle ready to go, the opportunity to try it came up, and I didn't pass it up. Pours a somewhat medium brown, with a smallish white head. Aromas of red grapes, tart cherries and wood. On the palated, this one is bracingly sour, with fresh cherries and oak fighting the balance battle. Another nice effort from the folks at Russian River."
"Notes: This is not tart, this is sour. I really enjoy sour cherry beers, but didn't find this one to be as complex or enjoyable as it's trumped up to be. It's very clean as others have noted, but the complexity level doesn't rise to the occasion. Don't see the value for the money (quoted as $14). That's not to say that this is not a well made beer and clearly unique - I just personally don't find it that interesting."
"D: very drinkable even at 7 ABV"
"pour is orange crimson cloudy with almost no head. White bubbles. Nose of tart. The palate is very much so that as well. Mild wood and floral lambic qualities, cherry tart, the black berry in the finish as a mineral fused with the malt. Could use some more of that. A fantastic quality the unites malt and sour fruit."
"DR- Amazing. Another winner that can be savored slowly (because you don't want it to end) over and over."
"Overall, I do like Supplication and will seek out other RR sours. If it were me, I brew this beer up with some more yeasty Belgium inspired spicy clove, which would help to massage the pallet and give a good contrast to the sourness of this brew. Very interesting indeed. Note to RR...I like the old style bottles better!"
"Sampled this as part of my own personal sampling. I had both Consecration and Supplication at the same time. This poured a light brown with a white head. The aroma had a far subtler sour presence compared to the Consecration. The same could be said for the taste also. While the Consecration felt like an attack on your tastebuds, the Supplication was less intense while still having a very pleasant sour, fruity flavor. I don't know enough about the process to tell whether the main difference is the Cab vs. Pino barrel, but when having both at the same time it's very obvious which is which. I could see myself drinking quite a few of these (that is if I could afford it) since it is more mellow and doesn't leave your tastebuds totally exhausted by the end. Like every RR beer I've had so far, this is very well done and highly recommended."
"What a lovely drop of beer, and a truly excellent wild ale. There are reasons this is rated as highly as it is. In terms of straight complexity, I think I actually prefer RR's Consecration, but this is probably a more true, more pure and more raw example of the genre."
"Another Russian River beer that just blew me away. One 375ML bottle is enough for a session and I am sure a hangover will follow as it does with sour beers."
"Overall this is an exceptional sour beer and I tend to choose it when I'm in the mood for something out of my ordinary. I definitely recommend this beer to any sour lover and its also a great beer for those who aren't the typical beer drinkers."
"Served in a goblet it had a deep-dark orange appearance, almost ruby, with a nice layer of off-white head with great retention and a moderate amount of lacing all the way down. Sour cherries was the most upfront aroma, some grapes and yeast were also present. I love smelling a beer and already knowing that it's going to be something special. Tasted very similar, lots of sour cherry wang. It's rather sweet at first, every now and then some bitterness came through on the back of the tongue. All sorts of funk going on here, a joy to sit and sip. The carbonation kept things exciting but I didn't find it to be as bubbly as I had expected, still very crisp and light on the tongue. It was a pretty intense goblet of sweet sour funk so it's not something you're going to want all night but it was still delightfully drinkable, almost deceivingly so, drink it slowly."
"D: Sweet and sour coupled with all the carbonation diminish drinkability. Being like candy, remind myself to slow down and enjoy."
"D: With the high level of carbonation and intense sourness, this one is not all that drinkable for me. It was nice to try, but was a slow sipper and I feel like I would quickly develop a stomach ache if I had to much or drank it too fast...Kind of like sour skittles."
"D-Very Very high for the style. This is a beer anyone who prides themselves a beer geek should not only try but stock at home. Incredible plain and simple."
"I think Supplication might be too easy to drink and the 7% abv was nowhere to be found. I may have liked this a bit too much for my own good."
"This is an amazing and complex beer. I feel I am now unfortunately hooked on wild ales. I put off buying this due to the price but I will definitely try this again."
"This beer in one word: Beseeching."
"This is one of those beers that you run into that just completely changes your appreciation for beer. Out of all the beers I have had, this is my favorite."
"It appeared reddish copper colored, like a glass of sherry. There is a small tan head. I can smell cherries and oak in the nose. When I sip, I first get the taste of a nice fruit juice, then Brett and the other flavors their wild yeasts impart. It has a wine-like finish (tannins gained form the wine barrels perhaps?). The beer has some impressive qualities I usually associate with an oude bruin. It has a great tingly sour feeling. It is pretty drinkable; I don't find it too sour at all, but the physical puckering reaction may be hard for some."
"Taste was awesome! Quite sour cherries that I loved. Will definitely seek out more of this in the future. As much as I like Consecration, I'll take Supplication over that nearly every time."
"D- this is a bug bomb and I love it. If your looking for a complex and layered sour this is for you. Different then years past. I've noticed a very interesting herbal nuance that has been arising in the rr run. Very cool."
"What else is there to say? Nearly all cylinders of Supplication were clicking to their full potential tonight, and I'm very glad to have finally be given the moment to do an extended trial of this wild exciting beer. If my palate were in 2007 mode, I would have been scratching my head over the hype. Now I get it. There are few beers that can hit all cylinders like Supplication."
" Rerate: Batch 3. Pours pretty with a hazy orange body with great lacing and a huge white head that stays. Aroma is awesome with vinous notes, funk, cherries, barrel, sourness and wine. Taste is sour, sour and more sour with cherries, wine and a bit of baby diaper. Fizzy, dry and mouthpuckering."
"Overall it is a pretty good sour, perhaps overrated, but great for people who love a ton of sourness."
"Man, I like this stuff a lot. A truly excellent sour, with very nice fruit flavors. Can't wait to try more from Russian River in the future."
"This is truly one of the best sours on earth, let alone in the USA - Russian River just proves over and over that they are the best brewery in the US!"
"Poured a deep orangish red with a solid inch tan of head that took some time to fade and left some very nice lacing. Smell is nice and pretty much what I expected...cherries, wine, and wood with a health dose of funk. The taste is a perfect copy of the aroma but much more in your face. Big cherry tartness with a smooth wine and wood backbone. Funky and delicious all the way though. Mouthfeel was thin and bubbly. Drinkability was good but the beer is definitely a sipper."
"Batch 04*1. Pours a clear dark amber color with a frothy white head. Scent is very funky with a very sweet cherry scent. Sour scent as well. This beer has been aged in my fridge for a while, and I think the 8 months did well for this beer. Had this fresh on draft and loved it, but this one right here is HARD TO BEAT. The taste is sweet and sour at the same time...much like a cherry warhead. Very complex and fruity. Mouthfeel is puckering, crisp, and almost perfect. Drinkability is HIGH!"
"D - You could savor this until you can't walk straight :>)"
"D - This is amazing, with tons of nuanced flavor and smell. I could see it pairing well with a lot of different foods (mussels??) and could stand on its own. Beautiful sour ale."
"The beer pours nearly opaque, inhabiting the space in between burnt orange and brown. The beer quickly has a two finger bone colored crown that cuts itself in half before holding and slowly fading (though never dissipating). The nose is good, but missing some of the elements I would expect from a beer like this. I get tons of funk and tartness from the bacteria, but nothing to speak of really in the way of cherries or oak. Not to worry though as those flavors make themselves known as soon as I sip Supplication. A hint of malty sweetness from the brown ale base, along with the cherries leads off. Oak then makes a brief, but nice appearance, before the beer finishes with the handiwork of the brett and bugs. The body of the beer is nice and light, but I feel like the carbonation could be just a little bit higher. So delicious that it's one of the most drinkable wilds I've ever had, but the tartness lingers just long enough to keep me from scoring a 5. Another fantastic beer churned out by Russian River, and I look forward to seeing what some time does to my second bottle of it."
"Overall, this is one of the sourest beers I've had and one of the best sours. It's very nice - the sweet cherries help balance the sourness and make it interesting. I picked up very little Brett, more could be interesting. This is even more intense in the bottle than when I had it on draft. A bit of an expensive treat at $13 a bottle."
" Another home run by RR"
"D: Goes down easily, mild kick, nice representation of style. I am kicking myself for not being in to sours when I was at RR last December - could have had this fresh on tap. I can't wait to have this again!"
"Paired with a buffalo, cheddar, bacon, balsamic onion, and red pepper burger on a toasted bun, this beer made for the perfect meal. A bit expensive, yes, but man was it enjoyable. AS a beer advocate, this may be the pinnacle of all beer related experiences."
"Don't miss this one."
"for the extremely high price, and the unbalanced flavor, can't say this has a very high drinkability. I've tried a few ""sours"" in the past (ie. Duchesse DeBourgogne and Monk's Cafe Flemish) and enjoyed them, but this one is just too much for my liking."
"great beer"
"Taste has just about everything one could want in a sour ale; wood, brett, lacto and cherries. It is nice that the sourness stays with you all the way through the bottle rather than the palate adjusting after a few sips like some other sours I have had. Brett presence is deep and rich and actually fights the lacto to a draw, both are heavy hitters. Tart cherries play an integral role as well. Yeast addition softens the flavors some at the end of the bottle and it is a sad moment indeed when the last few drops of a Supplication drain from the lip of the bottle. Fantastic brew! I am not sure I could ever pass up a bottle of this at a beer store."
"Another excellent wild ale from RR, easily one of the best breweries in America doing the style."
"Drinkability -- Given easy availability and no lambic-stomach, I could drink this regularly. A rare treat that I enjoyed to the fullest."
"Didn't review this, enjoyed with the wife on December 31st, 2010, our last New Year's in Denver. It was given to us on our wedding night in October of 2008. This one was a MUCH better experience than a fresh batch 5. Sourness was a little less aggressive, more secondary flavors showing through. One of the best beers we have had. My ratings above do not reflect this bottle as I did not take notes, but it would have been in the 4.5-4.7 area."
"*From notes taken on 8/4/10"
"Pours a beautiful deep ruby red with a finger of soft cream colored head that has great retention and great lacing. Smells of wood, red grapes, some spice, cherries, and definitely a funky brett smell. Taste is much like the nose but now I can pick up on raspberries and the vinegar cuts through, in a very pleasant way. The sourness is mouthwatering and refreshing, not burning or overly drying. Nice and sweet but nicely sour too, ends pretty cleanly but still has a faint lingering grain taste, but more noticeable in the slight aftertaste are the sour cherries. Wonderful carbonation and coating round out the dry and tart body. Incredibly delicious and enjoyable, though I could see how having much more would be troublesome for a person's stomach or tongue. Still, this is an incredible beer and I wish that RR distributed in MA!"
"D - This is a classic Russian River sour. I could drink this regularly with little complaint other than the holes in my stomach. A must-try for all lovers of things sour."
"Drinkability- This was really good. It's one of my wife's favorite beers."
"D - Wow, I drank this fairly quickly. Sourness is apparent, but in no way overpowering. I'm going to have to try and savor my next bottle. Everything in this beer just seems to work so well. Maybe I drank it too cold, because I could not find as much complexity as others have in the nose or taste, or else I would have scored it a bit higher in those categories."
"Well done! This is world class."
"Overall, I can drink this beer and enjoy every ounce of it, however, I don't think I could have more than one, as I don't know how much mouth I would have left."
"Notes: Very easily became my favorite sour beer in the U.S. I was charmed immediately. It's the best thing this brewery does out of the four or five I had of theirs."
"This beer was exceptional! I always look forward to finding a Russian River sour beer and this beer is a huge reason. Tons of fruit balanced with some malty sweetness and a bright puckering sour that leaves you wanting more. A must try for anyone wanting to try some sour beers. Reminded me a little of the Duchesse de Bourgogne but with even more sour and a little less fruity."
"D- maybe a little too sour, but its a damn good beer, well worth its rating"
"This is a tart, mouth puckering beer that coats the palate. A 375ml is the perfect quantity. Probably couldn't run this one all night (unless you really hate your stomach). All-in-all, a really wonderful sour."
"Serving type: bottle"
"All in all, not a bad beer at all - in fact, it's quite good. But it's not one of the 25 best beers in the world, IMO."
"Batch 5, duvel tulip, deep mahogany color eggshell colored fluffy head with good retention certainly. Smell has cherries tobacco red grape and a sour phenolic funk. Taste has the cherries show first with an almost medicinal character to it, cherry flavored cough syrup but in a good way a nicer, more memorable way. Mouthfeel is oily and viscous with a nice dryness and the sourness remains for a while. I could have a couple of these but not too many."
"I am a huge fan of Lambics, Gueuze and Wild Ales and Supplication is, if not the top, very close to the top of my list of all time favorites in those styles. This brew should age very well over the next 3-5 years, so I'm glad I have a few more bottles."
"D- you can't taste the 7% abv, and its surprisingly easy drinker of a sour. Can't beat that."
"A very satisfying beer that has both the bright acidity of Temptation and the sweet complexity of Consecration. Liquid awesomeness."
"Are you kidding, I could drink these till I'm blue in the face, drinkablity is excellent. One of the best sours out there to be sure."
"overall - very tasty beer. This was my first RR sour, and I think I'm going to seek out some more soon."
"Popped this brew to celebrate my buddy's engagement tonight. Congrats, Alex and Kristin! This bad boy pours a hazy auburn amber topped by over a finger of steadfast white-ish foam. The nose is up front about its bretty sourness, feeling it better to be open with us than try to hide its true feelings. I can respect that. Some tart berries, oak, light vanilla bean, and caramel corn occasionally bubble to the surface as well, but it's always the bretty-ness that looms over them all, all cocky and whatnot. The taste follows this template, with the sourness rocking my tongue fore to aft without much mercy. The brute. The berries return, along with some decidedly sour cherries, some oak, and a touch of butter somewhere behind the wall of bretty fog. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and an almost sticky feel. Overall, a more-than-solid wild child, though I'm not sure how often I could indulge in this treat."
"Drinkability:An amazingly drinkable sour beer."
"I like it, but Consecration is still tops for me when it comes to the RR 'tions."
"Another RR wild, another great experience. I need to move to Santa Rosa."
"D: I think i much prefered batch four to batch five. Still a great sour that never disappoints"
"Mouthfeel is exceptional as you would expect. It really cleaned up my pallette after a meal. And you would expect this is very drinkable. Probably the best sour ale I have had."
"D: Sour, but not abrasive or overpowering. A little goes a long way though - I would not drink this frequently or in volume."
"Poured into a snifter a wonderful reddish brown color with a slightly off white head of about half a finger that dissipated quickly to a crown with some light clouds of bubbles floating on top. Smell is very tart and some wine-y overtones. Taste is very tar with a crisp white wine flavor as well. Feel is great and crisp, clean as well. Overall a very enjoyable wild ale and definitely one I wish to have again."
"My objection to this beer is simple and straightforward. I love both wine and beer, but this one toes the line uncomfortably close to wine territory in my view. The dominant flavors here are, plainly, largely from being aged in wine barrels (one can pick that out immediately). As my review above states, this is a fine tasting beer and I'd gladly have it again but bluntly if this is the flavor I am craving, I'd rather have a nice glass of Rioja or Cotes du Rhone than this (which, by the way, is equally if not more costly)."
"Not a big fan of sours or wild ales, but I would definitely drink this again if I get the chance."
"It's a sour ale, so yo know it's dry and puckering, not the most sour but enough to satisfy and make you desire it on a hot day."
"Not my favorite sort of thing, especially with the intense tartness, but there's no question how well this is made. I wouldn't reach for it often even if I could, but for lovers of this sort of beer it's got to be total nirvana. I'll rate the drinkability a ""4" as a more objective judgment than I'd normally do. Personally, I'm super-glad to have tried it (thanks Brian!), but still kind of circling around most sours as a merely intrigued novice."
"As said before, I really need to mess around with this style a bit more."
"Bottle 375ml thanks to mikesgroove. Beautiful orange/brown body with tons of white browinish lacing. Aroma of fresh butter, vinegar, tart cherries, rotten apples. Wow, this is complex. Taste is quite different. At first, it's very sour with tart cherries. Then I get some apple/grape sweetness and oak flavors. It finishes with a lemony dry and sour lingering finish. Palate is hard to describe, it is both dry from the sourness yet it also has something sticky sweet about it too. A truly unique experience."
"Another great sour from Russian River. Damn tasty brew. Pours a lighter amber color with a thick white foam head. Has an aroma of vinegar and cherries. Has a nice frothy, medium mouthfeel. Has a sour taste with some bitters and notes of cherries. Really enjoyed this sour."
"D. For such a tart beer, I could drink this one all day."
"D - This brew has almost everything I look for in the style. Just phenomenal. It is a beer like this that makes a brewery world-famous."
"After letting it breathe and adding a little more of the yeasty goodness, Supplication becomes even more complex with more high notes and incredible mouth sizzle; adding in the lees really takes the sour cherry down a peg without losing the oak-fueled finish."
"A wonderful beer I had on tap at Local 44 during beer week. This was the last beer we had in our session and I'm glad because not much really stands up to the acidity and flavor of this beer. It has beautiful bouquet with fresh cherry and grape notes with toasted oak, barnyard and sharp acid. The taste was very much wine like with an interesting combination of both fresh and aged character, there was low apparent bitterness that seemed to get lost in the tartness, but that was enough to just provide balance.. The grape and cherry fruit flavors dominate this beer, with the bret and wild character providing a background of interest. This was a great beer to share because at 10 oz, I think this is the most I could drink before I would no longer be able to taste the different individual flavors and my palate was shot."
"At 7.0% abv, the beer is very drinkable, especially with how quickly the sourness dissipates in your mouth, leaving you with the slight scent of cherry and malt to encourage you to take another sip."
"Drinkability: With the sourness and dry finish, it is easy to drink. Each finish begs the next sip, until the bottle is gone."
"D: This most definitely lives up to its reputation. Crazy, complex and delicious."
"This is a really easy beer to drink and is flavorful but it did wreck my palate. This is deserving of the hype it has."
"I certainly had high expectations for this one and it didn't disappoint. I'm not an expert on sour/wild ales, but I can't imagine there are many better than this on the landscape of American made wild ales. Find one of these and drink it as soon as you can."
"For a sour this has great drinkability. I could easily grab another. THANK YOU RUSSIAN RIVER, and keep up the quality on your amazing beers."
"Dark copper, reddish brown with a persistent haziness. Supplication pours with a one and a half finger head that quickly fades to a thin film that remains for the rest of the drink. Sour cherries, musty wood, vines, slight malts, dark chocolate, raspberries, and booze. Sour cherries and ripe lemons up front followed by a funky mustiness and some alcohol heat. The aftertaste is rich in bread, sweet cherries, a touch of cinnamon, and a lingering sour must. A drinkable beer."
"A small head shows beige over amber and tanned hues. Aromas are sour and acidic. They're undeniably fruity, but I am not confident that it's quite ""cherry"". But a pull from my glass tells another story. The flavors are hugely sour, a massive wop of cherries explodes in my mouth, tingles, tickles, and makes me pucker. The cherries are really sublime, though the oak offers an earthiness that does well to balance it out enough that I don't want to call this a lambic. As I sip, I notice the froth is retaining and lacing the glass ... which is always something I like to take note of. Vinous and flavorful, this ale isn't too highly carbonated and has a light to medium mouthfeel. I love a good sour, and this one is done wonderfully. I can't wait to try future batches!"
"Very easy drinking and definitely a beer made for pairing with food."
"Supplication is most impressive in that the extreme tartness doesn't subside over time. I've been trying to treat it as a sipper, but it keeps drawing me in; I fear I've gone through it too quickly. This is a fine beer; I'd love to give it another consideration"
"Pours an amber color with an off white head. Smell is tart cherries, funk, oak, and vanilla. Taste is sour cherries, oak, and some funk. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. Overall this is a great sour that im glad I finally got to try."
"D- I can see why this beer comes in a 375. It is the perfect amount of this beer. A sipper for sure but leaves me wanting it again. RR has yet to disappoint me."
"D: lovey sour beer from russian river these guys really know how to brew some wild ales. I'm glad I have access to it on a regular. I don't think I can get bored of this beer."
"O - I sampled six beers last night, and this is the only one I had several of. And next time I go back I'll certainly have more -- hell, it'll be the reason I go back."
"Batch 004x1. The beer pours a clear orange color with a white head. The aroma is a lot of tart cherries with some oak. The flavor is tart cherries, vanilla and some oak. The beer is dry but not as dry as Sanctification. The cherries really make this an excellent beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"375ml bottle poured into a lovely snifter. Batch 3, big thanks to Bmoyer0301 for the hook up. Supplication pours a great color copper to red with orange around the edges. Nice white head with tight carbonation. Crazy fine spotted lacing all over the glass. Aroma is of musty basement and damp earthy oak first and then more of a barrel oak aroma followed by the presence of cherries. This beer has a great malty profile which is accented by masterful barrel aging. The flavor from the oak aging frames the cherry flavor very well, not in the way a kriek tastes but in the unique american style. As this beer breaths it becomes a bit more sour and leaves your palate cleanly and dryly. Supplication has great mouthfeel, perfect bottle conditioning. This beer is all about balance. The RR guys are amazing, everything you would want to taste, cherry, oak, wild yeast etc. is there and not one aspect overwhelms the others. Well Done!"
"Drinkability: Do you have some? I'll drink it. I'll drink it all day and all night. I would drink it in a box, I would drink it with a fox, I would drink it in a house, I would drink it with a mouse. I love it and despite the alcohol (which is hidden well) I could crush this daily and never get bored."
"No, it is not the beer for every drinker, but if this is what you crave, then it will give up its bounty with glee and make you among the happiest imbibers out there. It's balanced on a knife's edge between the sweet and the sour, with the earthy goodness that damp, fertile soil of a barnyard will provide you. It has a manageable ABV, and it drinks as though it were devoid of anything that would caution you to have a care. Not only do I appreciate the style, I appreciate everything it entails. It's beers like this that make it oh so easy to do exactly that."
"Overall I wish I had a 375ml to myself. Who am I kidding I wish it was a growler. A perfect balance of sour and sweet to keep you wanting another sip. A simply spectacular beer."
"D - The 375 ml bottle is more than enough for any one person I would imagine but the beer still causes mouthwatering just thinking about it between each sip. So delicious despite the heavy flavor and feel on the tongue."
"About half a finger of light tan to off-white foam spreads across the surface, of a fairly loose knit, all tiny bubbles, goes quickly but easily regained with a swirl or two, average lacing. The liquid is noticeably clear, an orange tinged brown, some loss of hue around the rims, plenty of active bubbles visible within. The sour cherry scents explode in your nostrils, evoke cranberry and pomegranate as well, sour lemons but golden honey too, horsehide, lees, drying chunks of rye bread and oats, rosemary and other garden herbs, with all of the barnyard floor and animality, the pureness of the cherry outlasts all the rest. Medium-bodied with a very strong foaminess, this almost necessary to help you palate acclimate to the unrelenting sourness of the cherry fruit. Yeast, lees, tar and a Sherry-like nuttiness fill in many of the open spaces. Very dry, one of the drier beers consumed in memory. As mouth yields to it, more raspberry, nectarine and lemon zest flavors appear. Hard to track any change as it warms, so pervasive is the sourness. A great ""experience"" brew but not one I'm jonesing to try again any time soon."
"Drinkability: This beer is truely great stuff, while it's hard to really put this stuff down to quickly...It's not hard to finish a glass or two. Like I said about consecration, this is a special occasion type of brew."
"(D)- A wonderful wild. What I love about it is how balanced and harmonious it is; not one character overpowers the other, but together, just creates an awesome beer. I did not want my glass to end."
"Drinkability: for the style this is a very drinkable beer. But one bottle is sufficient in a session. Unique and enjoyable beer."
"Pleasing wild ale which seems simple yet complex all the way through. Maybe it just confused my palate though since I haven't had too many wild ales. This is a tasty ale to say the least."
"Medium to highly carbonated with a light body, which accentuates the refreshing character of this beer. Overall an extremely well crafted sour; top notch!"
"Very unique and complex beer."
"Comments: A great beer with fine complexity. Russian river is making some topnotch brews. I have been lucky enough to enjoy two bottles of this wonderful beer."
"Taste of strong brett flavors , granny smith apples, tart cherry and drier than a desert on a hot summer day. The Brett flavors are stronger than temptation which I thought I liked more. Not a whole lot of flavor from malts that I can pick up among the battering ram of funk. Among the funk some oak is definitely present. Mouthfeel is on the medium side, with a heavy dosing of carbonation. I am under the assumption TUMS will be on the menu later today."
"D: Very drinkable. This sour was refreshing and a really great beer. Wished I had more, but my stomach was about to punch me in the face if I drank anymore sour beer. A great ending to an epic sour tasting that I will never forget."
"D - Considering the punch packed in the first sip, I'm shocked to see how easy this has become to drink after 10 minutes. While a growler of this might be intimidating, I'm having no problem enjoying every last drop of this bottle."
"Also, this was my first sour so I was a bit nervous about what I would find. I had heard that this is an excellent ""starter"" sour, so I'm glad to have received this one. mjmadden came up huge for me with this brew. Thanks again!"
"D: Really awesome beer. Had a 375 and wish it was a 750."
"wave of subdued oak. The brettanomyces funk works against these extreme flavors to provide an earthy balance in the finish. Medium bodied, with bright, sharp carbonation. A sour ale that slaps you in the face and demands your attention."
"Batch 04x2."
"A nice one. Very impressive composition. Quite reminiscent of a sparkling fruity wine."
"D- Very easy to drink and would enjoy this one again."
"D: Awesome. I wish the bottle was much bigger."
"D- wow. i wish i had a 750ml bottle of this. even my wife was impressed and asked where she could pick some up. ill definitely start working on that. the best american wild ive had."
"O - This is an amazing sour. I wish I had move."
"Highly recommended."
"Batch 1- Surprisingly good amount of cherry left but was somewhat mellow in general. Some other kind of neutral fruitiness combining in. Kind of felt 'muted'."
"Tasted from 375mL bottle at Lush CBC event, Batch004. Pours amber brown with a thin white head. Aromas of sour cherry, brett, grenadine, and burnt rubber. Flavors are sour with brett, featuring red fruit on back of palate, and green apple front palate. Carbonation is lively with a medium body and a long fruity finish. This beer is super drinkable and very complex."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and easy to drink, but this beer is so intense that it lends itself more to being a sipper."
"D- Don't get me wrong, I like acetic notes in wild ales... but not to the point that they destroy the complexity of the beer. I don't dislike this Supplication... I just wouldn't go through such lengths to acquire it again."
"Without a doubt one of the finest sour-style ales i've ever had the privilege of tasting."
"D: I really enjoy the sour and dry character of this beer, and having split two 12.68 bottles in separate sittings, I would certainly classify this brew as a drawn out tasting sipper. This is by far the most original and exciting beer that I have had in awhile and it really shocked and delighted my taste buds. What a great beer!"
"D: Fantastic beer, would love to have frequent access to it so I could bury it in my cellar for about a dozen or so years and see what would happen. The tartness my be a bit overpowering for those not expecting it and gives you pause between each sip to let your tongue recover, which I suppose isn't such a bad thing as it lets additional flavors to develop in the finish."
"a somewhat confused thumbs up on this one."
"Thank you Matt at Capone's for hooking me up with this and a few more treats from RR on a recent Philly visit."
"This is another one that several of us were looking forward to opening. Upon opening the bottle there was a nice POP from pulling the cork and the aroma of sour cherries and sour fruit fill your nose and make you want to pucker up a little. Pours a brilliant red with good carbonation and a mild light pink head. The initial taste is that of strong sour fruit and it lingers for a while before living the mouth. Takes you back to the days of sucking on sour worms and war heads until you tongue was sore. Liquid candy was how many people described it. This beer is a solid 5."
"D: Hmmm. I would have to say drinkability suffers because of acidity. A whole 375 ml gave me a little heartburn. Additionally, any sour can become tiresome to the palate. Excellent beer when you are in the mood for it, a ""world class"" sour."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable ale. Strangely, I think it would be really good mixed with iced tea like an Arnold Palmer...though that would be disrespectful to Supplication. The complexity keeps me coming back for more, this is a treat."
"Overall I think this is just the tiniest step up from Consecration. It's impossible to describe but I feel as though it's a tiny bit more complex in the funk department. Either way, both are extraordinary and well worth a shot."
"d - I really enjoyed this one. I tried Temptation, Supplication, and Consecration all in one night and thought Supplication was the best by far. Would love to try again."
"O: This is unique and delicious. Proof that if you take the care in brewing a beer you would in creating a fine wine, the results can be just as mind blowing."
"D- Is really good. I like this a lot. I cared for the consecration even more. I would have no problem at all drinking muliples of this."
"Amazing brew. So consistent. A lot of beers have a great nose, but fail to back it up in the taste or mouthfeel - everything is in sync here. Gets better with each progression."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability for any wild is a little on the lower side for me, due to the palate wrecking sourness. But this one is really quite nice. I would have no problem taking down a bottle or two of this one. Overall, probably my favorite sour to date. Really enjoyed my sample, and am excited to have one of my own. Skal."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer. This is completely different from what I drink, but it's delicious and a wonderful change of pace."
"Sourness and price may affect drinkability but for this style, this is amazingly easy to drink, tasty and refreshing. Every sip left me yearning for more, I finished this too quickly. This is only my 3rd sour I've had so I'm no expert, but goddamn this was a good beer. I can't wait to try Russian River's other sours."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and had fine carbonation."
"I was very impressed by this beer, and found I craved another badly the very next day. Golden brown color, tart cherry smell with a bit of funk in the nose but not much, mostly wood and cherries. The taste offered ripe, juicy cherries, wine-soaked oak and tart, sour cherry skins. Mouthfeel was superb, moderate carbonation with big bubbles, a nice dry, fruity finish. Highly recommended, an outstanding sour."
"D- This beer is very drinkable. This has to be the best sour I have had from RR. I would suggest this beer to anyone that wants to be blown away from a already amazing style."
"Poured a clear orange color with a limited amount of white head that dissovled quickly and left a faint amount of lace on the glass. Nose is a fruity sourness that is somewhat reminescent of oranges. Taste is tart, funky, sour and includes a bit of the previously hinted fruitiness. Light bodied and highly carbonated it has quite a dry finish. As it warms my palate becomes increasingly perplexed as I pick up on tastes of funky must coupled with dry fruits nearly apple-like but sour like a green apple candy. Brett is apparent in both smell and taste without being dominating. Each sip is so drying and puckering that it is hard to stop, put down the glass and stop salivating. This is a very interesting beverage that I found enjoyable and another example of a style I'm not quite familiar with but really enjoy and look forward to trying more."
"O - This sour is amazing. On tap, it's epic, but that will wait for another review down the road. Get this beer if you enjoy a nice sour fix."
"D: Very high on the drinkability, but I have a feeling enjoying a second one in a sitting wouldn't give the beer its due. Incredibly easy as this basically disappears in your mouth. The sourness would wears on me a bit, but it is incredibly enjoyable. Definitely in that upper echelon of beers for me. Highly recommended."
"Exceptional beer - seriously fantastic. I have fallen off the deep end into a deep love of well brewed sour beers. Wow this is good."
"The one small bottle I purchased was $12.50, so it is somewhat pricey. However, this is a beer I can see myself buying plenty more of in the future on special occasions."
"Body is good for the style, although I found it a bit thin. Drinkability was good, depending your tolerance for sourness. Overall, a good beer, worth a shot for anyone and a must try for sourheads."
"100th review! Popped the cork and the beer almost foamed out all over the place. Luckily I had a glass ready. This beer pours a lovely dark mahogany with a slightly tan head that sticks around in clumps and leaves wonderful lace. Surprising that it is not more carbonated given the fact that it was a gusher. The aroma is quite nice and full of sour cherries, vinegar, Funk and earthiness. Taste is very sour and very delicious. Puckering and complex. Pinot noir, tart cherry, woodiness, some wine like tannins, lemon like citrus... there is just so much going on. More vinegar than lactic acid, but both come into play. There is some alcoholic warmth in there as well, and it plays off the other flavors. The finish is long, super tart and slightly sticky. Mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty refreshing and drinkable, but this is one to savor. A fine sour from an amazing brewery."
"Thank you goes out to B Rob for this one. Brett E. Funk. I'm not even gonna follow the typical review order. This is my favorite beer so far. It was my first sour and you always remember your first. Ha, hi SB! It looked like an IPA with a little bit of redness in it. The taste is amazing, I almost can't describe it. I will definitely be seeking out as many wild ales as I can get my hands on due to this. I can't stop thinking about this beer, its bordering on obsession. Definitely one to seek out. Also, it has a cherry taste."
"d- yea, I could drink all my money away on this beer. and probably be pretty satisfied with my investment. dead and dying from starvation but enjoying some extremely fine brew. I've been borderline bumping up a couple stats so I'll say 5."
"The mouthfeel is pretty smooth for being so tart. It's kinda hard for me to get down. But pretty drinnkable for a sour."
"[FeDUBBELFIST, with a look as hard as nails needs to say nothing at all, the bartender realizes he's asked a stupid question and serves him another...on the house]"
"D - I did have some trouble with this beer. Not the beers fault. I am unaccustomed to the style and still have my training wheels on. This beer really opened up a whole new world for me. In my opinion is definitely a sipper. There is crazy stuff going on here and I will soon grow into my pants and be able to run free in this wild pasture."
"One of the best examples of American artisan brewing to have met our palates. Period. Don't bother pairing this one with any food. It's to be indulged in on its own. Batch 002 is on sale now at their website ($11), and they'll ship to about half of the states in the US."
"D: Great beer. 375ml is just about right unless shared (I shared a few drinks with my wife)."
"This beer has phenomenal flavor: sour up front with bitterness following and a long, lingering and delicious aftertaste of fruit and spice. Absolutely wonderful taste. The mouthfeel was also robust and spot-on for the beer, Russian River has delivered again. While this is certainly no chugging or session beer, I would have loved to crack open another bottle and sip my way through it."
"Very drinkable. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite beers to drink. Love it."
"A prolific beer from a prolific brewer, Supplication is a must-have for any lover of sours, browns, or the finer things in life."
"Pours a brownish amber with some haze, and beautiful white head that rose with little effort on the pour. Nose has a fruit dessert-like aroma with a little lime. On the palate there's plenty of vinegary passion fruit, sweet malt, wile sour flavors, and a tangy sweet fruity finish. Incredibly easy drinking for the style, and no unpleasant aspects of the barnyard-ish character."
"D: I really liked this beer a lot. At first sip I was unsure of it, but as I drank more and more, I came to appreciate this gem!"
"Consumed: 3/31/2010"
"Not sure I could drink this all night, but a glass here or there would bean excellent treat."
"When I poured it into my tulip glass the active carbonation danced and propped up a frothy head. I expected the added cherries would have the overly sweetened bar cherry flavor. This is not the case. The cherries taste just as natural as if I had picked them from the tree myself, and the wood from the oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity to the flavor that's just right. What is most interesting about this beer, and what I enjoyed the most was the sourness of it. When you finish your sip the tartness begs you to take another and leaves your mouth watering for more."
"I picked this up at Pinnochio's in Media, $17 for 375 ml. I poured into a snifter, light amber in color with a medium white head. There was minimal lacing. The aroma is very vinous. It is full of sour cherries and oak. It has a perfect cherry flavor. The tartness of the cherries and funk of the brett meld perfectly in this one. It finishes dry and has a little sweetness to it. The beer is a light/medium in body with mild carbonation. For me this is a great sipper. The best ""sour"" I have had to date."
"the smell of this beer alone is enough to give you a pleasant high, or atleast it is for me. Redish-orange color, with little to no head in the pour, but lots and lots of carbonation. It Seemed as though the beer must've had a thousand different flavors it was so delicious. The main flavor that stuck out to me had a sour citrus feel that just burst in your mouth. i can only imagine the type of alcoholic i would become if this beer was readily available to me.Basically this beer taste like heaven. if you haven't tried i would suggest you do so asap."
"D- Is very high, the flavors change as it warms up a bit and it just keeps getting more interesting the more you drink it."
"D: Mighty tasty i must say. while i would want to drink this quite often i couldnt exactly down a whole bottle 375 or 750 for that matter. im still a bit of a rookie with sours but this is the top 2 along with sui generis for me. worth the money for a nice long really well made sipper beer"
"This was equally fun to smell as it was to drink."
"Overall, this is definitely an easy drinker which might be surprising for such an extreme mouth shocker. Equally shocking, the weight of the bottle. This is one heavy bottle for such a small volume of beer. Totally worth the price to try but I don't think I'd penny up another $20 as I'd rather try other Russian River offerings first."
"I need more."
"Re-rate: 375mL bottle of Batch 04x2 tasted on 3/11/10. Pourse solid orange with beautiful cream head. Aroma of orange, cherry, oak and pine. Dray fruity flavor of peach and currants with nice tart cherry. Little dry beer that is very sour but an amazing sipper. (9/5/8/4/18 - 4.4)"
"The Supplication 09 looked pretty much the same except a shade lighter. It's nose was not as pungent at all compared to the 07. The taste is more fresh bing cherries, more oak and less sour pucker. I got some pucker on the roof of my mouth, but it has much more fruit compared to the 07. If you are new to sours, this one would be a good one to try. It's not as full bodied as the 07 but it tastes more fruity and oak. Dave liked the 09 better, however I appreciated the more sourness you got out of the 07."
"The fact that this beer is a bit more atainable than others makes it even better. If you have not had this you must try it."
"D: This beer is chuggable and dangerous. I wish I had an entire cellar full of this. Easily one of the best and most enjoyable beers I have ever had."
"Overall, Russian River doesn't disappoint with this one. Is it better than Isabelle? Some may say so but I don't think so. In a year or two, however, this bottle will probably be much better, so look at it whichever way you want. An exceptional beer and one I would love to seek out in the future. Thanks Kevin for opening another bottle that has been on my wants for some time."
"D- Really good, I could easily drink a 750ml of this and go for more. Reminds me of a smaller La Folie."
"On-tap at TJs yesterday in PA for Pliny The Younger and Friends, reviewed from notes. This beer was a life changer for me. I have had a decent amount of sours but nothing that remotely compared to this one. I think I may become addicted to sours in the next months just because I have always enjoyed very sour foods. Anyways... Served in a large flute like glass. Pours like wine with not much head or lace but a pretty awesome looking orange-copper color. The smell is nice. The lambic-like sour/funk notes are there with oak and cherries. Wine notes come through and also grapes. This balance became more evident as the beer warmed up and I fell in love with it. The taste of this beer was the real life changer for me. Very smooth. Starts out with an absolutely fantastic amount of sour fruits. The wine notes hit me soon after. The aftertaste is what really killed me, out of this world. From the time I swallowed the beer to a few minutes after the taste of cherries just grew on my tongue. Eventually it just tasted like a mouthful of fresh cherries (mind you there hasn't been beer in my mouth for a minute now). The oak and grape notes only add to a flavor that really needs no assistance. God.. the cherries are so good. Mouthfeel is suitable and enhances the beer for me. The body is moderate and nice and creamy. The sour makes my cheeks pinch but I like it. A coat of fruit sour, grapes and cherries stays on the tongue for a long, long time. Do I have to explain the Drinkability? The taste was perfect for the whole glass, the price was great. I will never view sour beers the same after this and will have a new standard to judge them to. I can only hope to have this beer again sometime in my life."
"Ok I'll be trading for more of this. Just an awesome beer to drink. I am making myself savor every last drop however, I want to consume it faster as it's just wonderful. Hats off again to Russian River."
"Overall, this is one great brew and the 375ml serving is perfect. It's sour as hell which could kill the drinkability in any bigger of a containment vessel, but this serving was just right. Becomes incredibly more cherry like and complex as it warms, and once the carbonation has mellowed, this is one fine beer. Not sure if I like it more than Consecration, but it's another great from RR. Can't wait to see how this one ages."
"D - Easy drinker, good taste, sweetness is not overpowering by any means. Great beer by RR."
"Overall Impression: This beer is beyond amazing!!! I enjoyed this even more than Consecration, and I was not sure that was possible. It's very hard to find, and it's expensive, but you simply MUST buy it if you see it. Once you taste it, you'll forget all the price."
"Slainte."
"This interesting ale has a nice cherry hue, cherry aroma, and cherry taste. The fine carbonation gives it a refreshing character and champagne-like feel. Really unique and I wish we could get it in Ontario. Thanks to JZED once again for sharing this rare treat from California."
"Overall, this is my first Russian River sour out of the bottle and I'm finding it to be pretty awesome. Lots of cherry, nicely complex, this beer is a great example of the American wild style. My only real complaint is that I don't have a few to age in my cellar. Keep up the great work Russian River!"
"d: Well, my dad looks like he is trying out for a Rolling Rock commercial. He just doesn't like it. For me though, I'm glad I was able to purchase and consume a bottle before the PLCB got ahold of it. Russian River continues to astound me."
"The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, a bit more would have been good. The finish has a bit of a puckering tannic feeling to go with the acidity. This was a great beer that I will try and have again. Splitting this bottle is ideal."
"Another knockout from Russian River. I just can't get enough of their beers. May not like it quite as much as Consecration, but everyone is a winner in that comparison."
"overall a very good sour ale."
"Nice orange/amber color, half finger white head that maintains throughout the whole glass. Well carbonated. The smell itself hurts my jaw and the sourness has a great bite but is not the most hardcore I've ever had. Instead it's just perfect for continued drinking. Cherries, pinot, and oak flavors dominate. The drinkability is truly exceptional. One of the best wild ales I've ever had."
"D - As much as I enjoyed trying this I can't see drinking it alot, it is a palette bomb for sure."
"D: Good complexity here though not overly so. What does it for me with this beer is the body. Amazingly light, invigorating, and drinkable, it complements the flavors present perfectly. Oddly filling also considering the light body, it exhausts and puzzles my palate. I could have glass after glass of this one though. Definitely worth seeking out and trying if you get a chance!"
"D-Pretty easy drinking for the style and way too close to call between this and Temptation. It's a coin flip situation to determine which is better."
"Overall, this was very close to Consecration, but some extra tartness and oak presence."
"To sum this beer up, it's like beer, wine, and champagne all in one. I have to believe it is truly one of a kind. I hope I am able to get my hands on this again sometime soon."
"D: Surprisingly, even though I'm not a big fan of sours yet, I am liking this beer the more sips I take. I guess that's just getting used to the style. I wouldn't drink a ton of this, but it's a nice change from the usual beers to sip on for an occasion."
"Overall, an outstanding sour. I really like this and it is probably my favorite Russian River to date (out of Consecration and Temptation). Get ahold of this one."
"Thanks Jeff for picking this up and sending to me. More, more, more!!"
"D: Pretty drinkable. This was very interesting and the flavors all mixed very well. Excellent beer."
"Wow, what a nice sour. I was extremely impressed by this beer and would recommend it to anyone who even remotely likes this style."
"D: Delicious and addictive, the tartness keeps you in check, easy to savor sip by sip, a great beer!"
"You want to take very small sips of this one. Each sip brings something new."
"drinkability - very drinkable, excellent flavor, great treat"
"All in all, it's another amazing beer from RR!"
"D- Slightly more acidic that I would like to the point where it had a burn that was slightly more on the esophagus than most any sour I have tasted. This is not to say that it was more sour or worse, it just burned a little. Other than that one downside, however, the beer was extremely drinkable and has held up VERY nicely."
"Overall, great offering from a great brewery. Probably best sour I have had to date from RR. Awesome.`"
"Drinkability- A nice enjoyable drink."
"Thanks waltonc, bbehr!"
"D - a beer like this just begs to be slowly sipped and savored, the problem is its just so damn delicious and balanced. the alcohol is simply non-existent, and balance just unbelievable. sitting and settling for a few minutes brings out a whole new slew of tastes and textures. certainly holds its own against other RR sours/wilds."
"D: I will admit I am not a fan of the style but had to try this due to the hype. The sourness was a shock at first; however, after a few sips it all came together and I could easily see how fans of sours could crush this and beg for more."
"The flavor is tart cherries, wood, a little sweet malt which I did not detect from the smell, and some funk. Very good, very dry and complex as well. Medium bodied, smooth, and quite drinkable."
"Enjoyed from a 375mL bottle (Batch 04x2) in a tulip glass. Dark amber in color with one finger of light tan head, fading into a nice cap and lacing. Smells of oak, tart cherries, and funk, but primarily cherries. Taste is mouth puckeringly tart: sour cherries, oak, and a bitter, tannic finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. As much as I love everything about this beer, it can be very hard to drink. An excellent brew all around!"
"Overall another great beer from Russian River. If I could afford it, I would love to try Supplication, Consecration, and Temptation in a side-by-side sour tasting. Without trying the latter yet, I have high expectations after trying the other two."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Great copper color with a minimal beige head that didn't last long. Minor lacing down the glass. Smells great, big burst of cherries, wood and some funkiness. The taste is where this beer really shines in my book. It's dominated by cherries with a great sourness but nothing over the top. Very, very delicious beer. I felt like I was flying through this beer so I had to slow myself down to really enjoy it. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. The carbonation is spot on and it has a sort of champagne quality that coast your tongue. Drinkability is off the charts in my opinion. Feel like I could sip on this all day long. Temptation and consecration were very good but I think supplication is my favorite of the 3. I will get more, highly recommended."
"Although I don't think this is a session type beer it surely is one of the best tasting beers out there. A must try for everyone who enjoys unique beer."
"The feel of this beer is really great and pleasant on the palette. It has a nice warming feel with a nice fizzy feel. It goes down really well and is quite refreshing. The sweetness is really light on the palette and is really enjoyable. One of the best beers I have had."
"This is really hard to just let sit in the glass... it constantly pulls you back, leaving you quickly wishing there were 5 more of it's sibblings waiting for you in the fridge. But that would be an expensive 6 pack now, wouldn't it."
"Drinkability is good as it is not too sour or overwhelming. Alcohol is not very present. Mouthfeel is creamy and coats the whole palate. Another good sour from RR."
"- Overall I really liked this, and I plan on sitting on others for a long time to see what can happen to this brew, and if the carbonation would calm down a bit. Overall very good. Would still buy Consecration before this one though. Even Temptation too I think.... but either way, I will buy all of them. Love each and every one of them."
"It's a pucker! Solid sour...tons of fermented cherries, carbonation...and very crisp. I guess I should mention I chose to pour slowly at first, and then swirled the setiment and poured in into my glass anyway. I personally love the added flavor. There's a very nice sweet flavor that rests on the tongue well after each sip. A great sour!"
"Pours a cloudy orange tea color with a thick stiff foamy white head that resists fading, leaving a huge amount of Belgian lacing, some 3D. The smell is aggressive, complex and fruity classic Bing cherries down to the unique tart character. The aroma also has a sweetness that i want to associate with malt but with a creamy vanilla note that i sense may be from the barrel aging. Full flavored, the tart cherry character is intense without being offensive and in fact is exceptional. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel finishes clean and dry. This is the most drinkable sour that I've experienced...right up there with Brute and LeBleu. The depth of the flavors and aroma of this one exceeds the other two. Really glad that I had the opportunity to consider it!"
"D - Hmm, very good wild ale...really a toss up between this and Consecration for my favorite RR wild, and up there overall, probably adding Ithaca Brute into the mix. Good blend of fruitiness, sour, brett...sorry that this is only a 375ml bottle...have to try to get a few more of these before they become scarce."
"I consumed a growler of batch 004 back in December, but I've been told that a different blend was put into bottles. I enjoy this even more than the first blend, if that's possible, and I shall drink up while the fruit is fresh."
"Draught at the brewpub for the Younger release. Batch four has a really vivid cherry character right now, wth a ton of acidity, but also a great mLt balance that isn't sweet but provides a lot of counterbalance to the sourness. Just a ton of great flavor. Seems more fruit forward than the last batch. I can't. Wait to see how the bottles of this batch are."
"Very good sour. Perhaps not as good as Temptation in my mind (which is just phenomenal) but a very solid offering worthy of the price (whatever it may be)."
"D: I could drink this all day... and I did! Russian River seemed to have an endless supply of this stuff during both NoTB and session one. I came back from multiple samples :)"
"Yep, an excellent beer throughout. I would expect nothing less from a Russian River Wild Ale. Maybe the best I have had from the brewery, which is saying a lot. Worthy of its praise. A must try if you have the means."
"OK, I like this beer but this is not my favorite sour, not at all. This was sweet and there is a lot of carbonation in the mouth that accents the sour notes. It ends rather tart but overall its not as sour as the other offerings. Its citric and lactic in nature with a pretty dominant sweetness overall. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high. Still a great beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium with a high level of carbonation. This is a very drinkable sour beer with lots of complexity. A real treat."
"It's a given that you will wish this had come in 750s. It's a fun beer to drink, and comparable in quality to the best Belgian lambics, I have no doubt of that."
"The body is light to moderate. Limited carbonation but ok. The tartness leaves a good finish that really helps. But I would like a bit more complexity."
"The Supplication pours a hazy amber color. A nice frothy 2 finger head with great retention sits atop after a very delicate pour. The aromas were noticed immediately after popping the top. Lots of cherries make up the sweetness that dominated the nose. Some grapes are also noticed most likely from the wine barrels that are used during the aging. After allowing the brew to warm up from the 45 degree fridge shelf the first quaff was taken. The mouth is not nearly as sweet as the nose with a very balanced sour tartness. Not a lip smacker like some sour ales can be. Again, lots of cherries are tasted up front. Other fruits that make up the quaff are pinot noir grapes and plums. The brett also come through with the quaff which is expected. Mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated, much like a champagne. This is by far the best sour I have sampled. Very fortunate to have tried this brew and can only imagine how it tastes with a year or two on the shelf. Thanks again Jesse for allowing me to try it."
"D: If not for price and rarity, I could drink this like water...and that's only a slight exaggeration. An amazing beer, and I can't wait to see how it evolves over the next couple years."
"D - This brew is delicious, but far from the most complex sour I've had. It's a kriek alright, but not much more. I would seek out again, but wouldn't go too far to get it."
"Drinkability: The acidity is the only thing that holds this back from being sessionable. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: this is incredibly drinkable. Were I to win the lottery tomorrow, I'd definitely try to get my hands on a few cases of this stuff."
"D: If one happens to get ahold of this brew, buy it! Don't mind the cost. It's amazing, and is the pinnacle of this style. I would like to try a younger example, just to see how it compares."
"D: not too heavy at all and I could drink a few of these."
"I still think I'm getting acclimated with these variety of ales. I respect this beer but don't think I can truly appreciate it yet. I'll be re-reviewing this in a year or so to see how my palate has changed."
"Drinkability: Sadly, I only got about 4oz. of this. I would've gladly taken more. Thank you SO much Mr. Appler! This is the best sour I've had to date!"
"D- This is one of the most enjoyable, drinkable beers that I've ever had. I made very short work of my 375 ML bottle and I'm sad that I only bought one."
"Drinkability: Just one glass for me but this beer could possibly appeal to people who think they don't like beer, or any alcohol [sour candy freaks]. Nice job Russian River."
"Drinkability - It's very smooth considering the sourness. The acidity and carbonation help balance it out and make it a smooth drink amid the sour fruit flavors."
"D- Easy to drink, but the sourness does slow down the drinking of the beer, but I want to enjoy this as it is."
"D: Very drinkable, especially considering the style. Good carbonation levels, beautiful fruit, and a beautifully-balanced sourness."
"D- Really easy to drink a lot of this beer, undeniably refreshing. Reminds me of sour skittles(though not as sweet), they would leave me always wanting more. Best wild ale I have had, worth the cost..."
"Great drinkability, I would love to sip on one of these all day long."
"D- Insane. I'd drink a 3L of it if I could. Really glad I have a few more. Simply fantastic and the best Am. wild ale I've ever had."
"-i am not the biggest sour beer fan out there, and this is my favorite out there by far. very drinkable for me considering the style. could definitely be excited to order this for years to come"
"batch 04x4"
"On Tap at Falling Rock in Denver. Been waiting to try this one, and it did not dissapoint. Little head, gives way to a nice ruby color, smelling of hay and fruit. Mouthfeel is amazing, acidity is there and cuts into it, but you really get a nice dose of the cherry. The cherry element reminds me of New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red, but the sourness creates its own unique world. What a beer, I would gladly drink this all day and all night. Thank you, Mr. Cilurzo. Thank you."
"PS. This is my first sour, and I really enjoyed it. I can see myself really enjoying this style more often. Thanks Russian River."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's very delicious which helps the drinkability out a lot. It's sour, tart and acidic for sure but it's so good and complex drinking it really is a pleasure. Plus I really love anything with cherries involved in it. The acidity is the only thing that would probably get to me if I were to drink too much of this."
"Batch 003. Gold with pink and red in color, nicely robust head with equally alluring retention and lacing. Aroma is sour, acetic, sweet with a mild note of dark fruit. Tastes nicely sour, of cherry skin, pediococcus, and well rounded. Body is moderate in heft with a smooth plentiful carbonation. Tart and sweet and quite easy to quaff, well deserving of its prestige."
"The mouthfeel makes me want to keep sipping, it is addictive in its uniqueness. Would be great with thanksgiving dinner."
"All in all, a very impressive, superior crafted, creative success."
"Overall I would drink this as much as I could because I don't see it often. But I am lucky to see it here and there."
"The body is medium and the carbonation levels are very high, but fairly standard for the style. Drinkability is solid thanks to the funk and sourness being kept in check. Overall this is a fantastic beer, and definitely one of the best sours available."
"d- I could drink this all day, every day. It's a shame it's seasonal (as well as a little pricy) because these are the only things keeping me from doing so."
"D - This is the most perfect sour I've had to date. Awesome."
"Draft, Toronado, 2007 Vintage. This beer certainly changed over the course of 2-3 years. There's very little head. The sourness is considerably amped up. It almost drowned out the malt complexity for me. Those sour cherries are very punchy. It gets almost difficult to drink by the end, but it's a delicious torture. Wonderful beer and I would be very interested to see further changes over time."
"Delicious sour ale that keeps you coming back for more."
"Drinkability - Can't get enough."
"Drinkability - For as sour as it is, I am rather enjoying this 375ml bottle. I really wish I could do a comparison between Temptation, Consecration, and this beer (the only three sours from RR I've had). I definitely feel this is better than Consecration in my honest opinion, and also edges out Temptation. Still, it would be interesting to see them all together. This one has a massive sour punch and I rather enjoy that. An amazing beer and I'm glad I picked up a couple extra so I can age them."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot because it is so unique."
"drinkibility...same notes as the above moutfeel. Exceptional originality in this brew giving it the high scores it deserves."
"J"
"Poured a hazy brown colo with red hues, little white head. Nose is sour cherries and a tartness. Taark cherries and a deeper tartness than Consecration. Pretty sweet, booze and all is well put together, creating a good brew. Mouthfeel has a wine like characteristic. Very good sour and I kept going back to this. So good!"
"Extremely drinkable and delicous, glad I have a growler and will definetly get this when I see it."
"This beer brings tears to my eyes. Highly recommended."
"Taste starts bracingly sour (duh). More vinager-y tartness. Cherries are evident in the middle, and then finishes with a tannic dryness. Sour, yet very drinkable and refreshing!"
"This batch is even better than the last!"
"M/D: This beer is very desirable on pretty much every level. Despite looking flat, Supplication on tap surprises with a tingly feeling of carbonation that envelops the palate, working with the yeast to give a mouth-puckering feeling. As this was the latest batch of Supplication, I imagine that a couple more months of aging will do this beer a lot of good as the sour notes mature and amplify. However, the flavor and the balance of sweet and sourness in the this beer is impressive, to say the least."
"D: Just as drinkable as the fresh batch that will be released on Friday. That said, I think this one should be consumed fairly soon, unless more vinegar is your thing in sours."
"Notes: Amazing brew. My favorite between RR temptation, consecration, and this...though it is a close one."
"Had this on tap at the Blind Lady Ale House. Pours out with a nice copper color, which I'm guessing comes from the cherries, decent amount of head in the glass. Smell and taste were almost identical for me... tart cherries, with just a hint of sweetness. I felt this beer was perfectly carbonated, dry like a champagne and incredibly easy to drink. The bar listed it at 9% abv, though it's listed differently here, either way, it was a beer where the alcohol creeps up on you so beware! I had read that the beer is barrel aged, but I didn't really get ""barrel"" flavors as you might with some other B.A. beers. Another home run from Russian River."
"Carbonation is probably on the high side as has been my experience with most of Vinnie's wilds. The balance of the various flavors keeps drinkability very high. I'm actually enjoying this much more than I expected. Too bad I couldn't convince them to sell me a growler. Can't wait for the bottles to come out next month."
"I am curious to see how my remaining bottles will continue to age. This beer can be aged for up to four years. I can only imagine it will be quite sour in another year or two."
"Funky tart Pickering mouthfeel that isn't acidic in the least bit. Perfect balance of brettu funky sourness, slight malt and sweet dark fruit notes. Lots of spur dark cherrry, vinous grape, raisin and plum. The tart curries really come through and make this beer amazing well balanced and quaffable. The ABV is nearly undetectable and there is a slightly vinegary Pickering aftertaste that leaves me salivating for another gulp. I love this damn beer and am so excited to try it on tap. This further cents my opinion that Russian River is the best brewery on the planet. Sek tuis beer out at any cost, especially on draft."
"A grin and a glance at our comrades, we've run through it yet again, we're warm and cheery now... may it ever be thus."
"Bottle batch 002. A bit of a gusher. Pours reddish brown with a thick foamy off-white head. Smells of damp oak, tart cherries, grassy brett funk, some candi sugar and a bit of port. Flavor is strong sour cherry with a delicate creamy sweetness balancing it. There is a strong oak note and grassy funk from the brett, a bit vinous too. Medium body with a very lively carbonation."
"Growing vinous with age, the pinot character is really dining along with a soft mushroom like funk. The Chris have faded but the vinous notes keep the memory alive. Kinda like a Bon Chien but lighter. Awesome."
"This and Consecration (Batch 1) are my two favorite Russian River sours to date. This is great stuff. I am looking forward to trying it fresh."
"Was worth the payment, regardless."
"Light in feel and briskly carbonated, perfectly balanced and ridiculously complex without ever being a ""challenge"". I had another few things I desperately wanted to try, not knowing when and if I'll ever be back in Santa Rosa, but I could have had a few more of these, easy. Just dreamy."
"Overall, this is a pretty good wild ale but nothing spectactular. I prefer the RR Temptation."
"D: I had two 10oz pours of this and strongly considered a third. In fact, as I'm typing this up, I'm tempted to go back and get said third. Probably my favorite Russian River wild ale now that Consecration's recipe has changed."
"Not too high drinkability as I find this RR sour in particular to have a cumulative puckering affect. Really only one glass is suitable, but that one glass is really a good one."
"O: grapey, subdued oak, lots of acid but balanced well, one of the best rr sours"
"Overall- my favorite Russian River beer so far. I used to be a Pliny head until had some of their sours. More simple malt than consecration, less sour than beatification but the most refined."
"Drinkability is very high and the ABV is very well-hidden. Went back for this two more times despite all the other great barrel aged beers there. Great beer, Vinnie! Worth the long wait."
"This is a standout beer for style. Thanks Brad."
"Overall, one of the best sours out there imo. Very drinkable and I wish I had more of this. I will probably have to get some of the next batch when it comes out. All around a good beer. I really enjoyed that it wasn't overly dominated by vinegar and acidic tastes."
"UPDATE, old score fresh = 3.6. Opened one recently and it had gotten nice and sour, and the lemon had really started coming out. The funk was spot on, not dominating but making itself known. REscored 4/2/09"
"I may like this beer better fresh, but this was still great."
"Probably not really drinkable for a lot of people considering how sour and dry it is. For me, bring it by the pitcher."
"D-This one simply works for me. Like a light, dry, cherry wine! Another American wild winner from the genius mind of Vinnie!"
"M & D - Light/medium bodied with just the right balance of carbonation and smoothness to enhance the flavors. The sourness dries the tongue right out, and the flavors make you yearn for the next sip. A winning combination, but I'm not looking the empty glass that my future soon holds."
"Drinkability - Very smooth with great flavor, I could drink this all day."
"The mouthfeel of the beer is perfect for the style, it is well carbonated, dry and crisp. This is a beer that I wish I had multiple bottles of, and something I would like to drink all the time for sure."
"Drinkability is high, I want more of this but I couldn't see myself craving this all night."
"Bottle batch 003. Pours a cloudy dark amber color with a thick white head. Smells musty and sour. Has a medium mouthfeel. Taste is very complex and has many flavors including: oak, sour, fruit, tartness, pepper spice, and some acidic spiciness. Overall this is not a punch you in the mouth sour like some of the other sours out there. Its more subtle. Its more drinkable. My drinking buddy commented its like eating a piece and candy and wanting more. That's what its like between sips. Overall a great brew."
"D. On this hot, summer brew-day, this beer really does myself and mrandypandy well. So complex and lively. This beer has like 2000 different tastes going on. It feels like a sour pogo-stick jumping around on my tongue. Nice job, guys!"
"D= This was easily the best sour I have had to date...world class for sure. I really appreciated the flavors without being overwhelmed by them. Despite the challenging nature of this sour, I believe it would be easy to have a couple in one sitting."
"D- Amazingly balanced and smooth for a sour. A leader in its class."
"375ml bottle from Batch 3. Pours an opaque dark copper with a fluffy white-orange head that isn't quite as substantial as one would hope. Some sediment. Smells heavily acidic with plenty of leathery brett character. Earthy with some cherry notes. Sharp, acidic taste with noticeable barnyard character. Woody and tannic. The cherry flavors are much stronger here than in the nose. Unapologetically sour and dry. Medium body with high carbonation. Fantastic."
"This is a very nice beer, but IMHO, not nearly enough for the top 50. Certainly worth a try."
"Just tried batch four, moved mouthfeel down a notch as it is overcarbonated (and will probably get even more so)."
"D - A really enjoyable AWA that I'm going to look for again. I know it's getting hard to find, but hopefully I'll be able to trade for another down the road. RR does it yet again!"
"D= super amazing. One of the best beers I've ever had by far. Lew me away."
"This was definitely the best Russian River sour I have had to date and possibly the best sour overall. Not only did this beer contain an amazing amount of intensity and complexity but it displayed a level of balance demonstrated by few others. This brew is destined to be a classic."
"This served for a great start to the day, thanks again Dyan!"
"Overall: What a way to finish off a wonderful birthday...sorry, had to mention it once more. Anyways, this beer is worth getting your hands on, even if you don't like this style of beer. More flavor than you would expect and a great beer overall. Cheers!"
"Overall, this was an incredible beer. Thanks again to Dyan and I can't wait to try this again!"
"If my calculations were correct, this should be the beer that puts the first drop of beer in my mug. Matching it up with review #300 would have awesome, but that just means I have another excuse to open up something awesome again soon. As it is, I'm still reeling from the fact that this bottle will no longer be in my 'cellar'. My spreadsheet says I bought it on 4-18-07 - over 2 years ago. But a birthday is a great day to reward all that patience."
"HV"
"D- This is another great sour from RR. Not as good as their other sours that I have tried, IMO...but still a very very good sour. This one has a bit more of a vinegar presence than the others but is still a very good, well done beer. I am looking forward to Consecration and their other beers that I have not tried yet."
"...at least until next year."
"Overall: Supplication was my first sour. Wow, this is incredible. I can't believe what I've been missing."
"Crisp and so light in body. Beautifully done beer."
"D: The 12.7oz. is definitely enough for me but that doesn't mean it becomes too much. Refreshing and drinkable even with the enhancements from the age."
"Overall: Wonderful sour barrel aged beer, sourness,cherries and funkiness all play together nicely. Very enjoyable"
"Tap @ O'Briens TION night. Poured hazy, bright gold with a frothy white head. Musty, dank yeast funk combined with oaken wine barrel earthiness. Effervescent mouthfeel gives it a light feel. Mouth-puckering tartness right away. Lemony citric bite along with the bretty funk. A vinuous tanginess follows as does the oak and cherry flavors. Definitely a success in terms of aging in that it tones down the sometimes harsh vinegar and cheese flavors. They are present, but in far less degree so the quality of the beer itself comes through. The pricetag on a bottle of this can be prohibitive, which makes having this on tap a rare treat."
"This is one hell of a drinkable beer, but you will definitely be sipping Supplication to savor and enjoy it."
"A fantastic American Wild Ale. What a great beer, I will have this beer any time it is available."
"Overall, why do I have to live so far from Russian River? Their sours are amazing and this is no exception. If you can get your hands on it, do it."
"Taste is all kinds of crazy, to spectacular effect. Tart, sour cherry, oak, funk, must, a dry ending. Quite hard to describe, about as akin to normal beer as American football to 'intl' football. Mouth is mostly dry, medium light bodied, puckering, smooth, rather easy to drink, for its oddity. Its not my first 'brett' beer, but its probably the finest. Much thanks to Tom (MuenchenerKindl) for this one."
"d - super high. I shared this tiny bottle and I want MORE! It's not mouth pucking sour but quality sour that's easy drinking."
"Hazy light amber body hosts a solid beige head that stands at an inch and has about three minutes of retention before staying at a skim. Nose is invigoratingly tart with notes of sour cherries, electric funk, and grape skin. With another sniff you get some woodsy alcohol. Immediately attacks the tongue with yeasty barnyard sour funk. The cherries bring about a nice tongue glazing tartness. Yeasty and almost creamy on the back of the tongue. Oak really comes through as you continue to drink. Mouthfeel has back-end thickness, consistent tart funk, and yeast that turns to a veggie like hue. I shared this with my wife and the drinkability makes me wish the bottle was twice as big."
"Batch 3- poured into a RR barrel glass in celebration of a shitty week at work and my washing machine breaking today. Yee ha. Pours a orange amber colour, with reasonable clarity. Frothy one finger vanilla coloured head with good lacing. Nose- cherry, wood, musty, sour and just damn inviting. Taste- sublime lacto sourness, citric zing, and green apples. Very dry, earthy and woody finish. This brew has dried out quite a bit since the last time I've had one. The cherries are more of a complementary player than in the forefront which is fine by me. Drinkability is superb and the spritzy carbonation dances across the tongue. Very well crafted brew."
"Overall, a fantastic beer that I am joyous to have had the opportunity to drink. If I am in RR's neck of the woods I would probably seek out another bottle but at a $17 price tag I won't be stocking up."
"Its worth the hunt, go get one."
"Awesome brew with consistant notes from tap and from 375ml bottle. Lots of time these type of brews have weird color, this one pulls it off. Amazing aroma that is very complex, funk, bright and muddled red fruits. Acidity / sour is bam! which should evolve well in bottle. Less than beatification and more than temptation for my palate. Lots of upside, some oak tannin. Nice finish, long and the sourness carries thru and brings the flavors along with it. Very nice and distinct."
"A slow pout produces a amber brown with an off-white fluffy head. Smells of apples and white wine. Light musky malts smell too. Taste is intense! A very tart flavor. Makes my checks tingle. Tastes like it smells: apples and white wine. I can defiantly taste the malts too. The oak barrels definitely help bring all the flavors together. Plenty of balancing hops that increases the viscosity of my saliva. Mouth feel is light with lots of carbonation. If you let it wonder, you can feel the bubbles form all over your tongue and mouth. Drinkability is better than most wine/beers. I think the aging in oak barrels have contributed to the drinkablilty."
"D - Drinkability is good. The big tart flavors and complexity of this brew make it a candidate for a sipper. The cherries add something different and unique to this brew and pushes the drinkability up a notch. As it warms the Brett flavors start to smooth out and some brown ale qualities start to come through. This is another winner from Russian River. Highly recommended."
"overall i really enjoy this beer. probably one of the best wild ales ive ever had. i will look forward to hunting this sweet bitch down again."
"D: I had no problem putting this bottle down... and would have another if it wasn't so pricey."
"Color was a dull gold with a light white head. Smells of tart fruits, cherry, apple, sourness. A very drinkable sour, less biting than a flanders or some of RR's other sours, medium bodied, and less fruits in the taste than I expected. Good stuff."
"I don't have much to compare this to since this is my first attempt at this style. I have to say I enjoyed it considering this was totally different. It was very drinkable and especially nice with my cheese and crackers. I would have liked to have gotten a bit more sour apple/cherry flavors. I can't wait to try Temptation next!"
"Very nice and worth the hype! Go out and try this!"
"They say sour is the new IPA. Well if this is the head of the sour class, count me in to the new school. May the beer gods bring Russian River to Western PA."
"D: A sour thirst quencher for any day =P Really balanced wild ale/sour -- what have you. Would like to have more of these."
"To say I enjoyed & savored every gulp would be an understatement. Worthy of the hype & kudos this brew gets."
"Small creamy faintly pink head. Well carbonated. Cloudy rosy amber color. Smells like sour cherry pastry, earthy, yeasty. Starts very sour, puckery, tart. Sour enough to take your breath away. Finshes dry. Some white wine character in finish and aftertaste. Still very sour. Medium body. I want to like this more but sourness overpowers everything."
"8/4/9/4/17 (4.2/5)"
" Drinkability on a sour is a strange question; yes its drinkable but how much sours can one take. I'm glad I decided to crack this one open tonight I have been really missing the sours and it was easy to finish this bottle of myself"
"Overall, a world-class beer that deserves to be so highly ranked. My mission in life is to find more of this beer - now! I could have just drank this all night but this ended up being the first in a classic night of beer drinking at Falling Rock. Most highly recommend - get one now....wait, don't get one as that would leave less for me."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orangey amber with a bubbly white head that sticks around forever. I can smell the sour from here while I'm pouring, yum. Upon closer inspection many layers reveal themselves to my nostrils. There's the sour funk, the cherries, the spicy Belgian yeast, bready malt. Just wonderful smelling really. Taste is sour lemons, limes, green apples, some cherries, a bit of acid. Any trace of malt or yeast gets buried in the sour while tasting. Sour fruits galore, but not overpowering. Incredibly drinkable. Very dry finish. Crisp Carbonation, medium body, Creamy dry mouthfeel. Wow this is good! One of the best I've had, although a little more cherry wouldn't hurt."
"Pours a golden/honey color, minimal beige head, but I poured slowly, as per the bottle's instructions. A few spots of lacing hanging in there. Smells of white wine, yeast, sour cherry. Taste is extremely sour, intense green apples and cherries, maybe some pear as well. Crazy puckering and drying mouthfeel. Certainly tasty, not a style I'm super familiar with, but I'm glad I got the chance, and would love to try this again in the future."
"This is a fantastic example of a style that I'm really not into. It says a lot that I really enjoyed this one despite my palate not quite being ready for sours yet. Get some now."
"Overall, worth a try but to me not among the very best of sour beers."
"Drinks pretty easy considering the tart & sour going on here. Not sure i could do more than 2 bottles of this, but certainly the best of this style in a bottle I've ever had. I must for sour beer freaks"
"Mouthfeel is clean and light."
"Overall: Batch 3. This beer is everything I was hoping for. I love it. This is exactly the way I wanted to celebrate the news I got today about being selected for advancement to E6. A perfect end to a great day."
"Regardless, I've been Supplicated."
"D- Outstanding! This goes down exceptionally smooth and really balances the sour taste very well."
"D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, even though I'm not a big fan of the sour beers, I can appreciate the fact that this is a well-made beer. It's well worth drinking for a while if you're in the mood for the sour style."
"Color is clear and reddish, with a small head that fades quickly. Some earthy scent and some, but less, earthy taste. Bright with carbonation, maybe even a little too much. The RR sour taste is nice and cleaner than many other sours. Burns all the way down to the stomach, which is the only thing that decreases drinkability."
"Crisp body and delicate carbonation fit the style perfectly. Like I said, another artisinal creation from Vinnie."
"By far the best sour I have tried, excellent. Looking forward to the bottle of Beatification I have in my fridge as well."
"Overall: not everyday but makes for a rare treat"
"An excellent beer. Like this the most of the RR sours."
"Had a bottle of this at The Trappist yesterday. Reddish/orange in appearance. Smells like sour cherries, but there also seemed to be a metallic tinge to the smell that was off-putting. Taste was significant sour cherries. Fresh, tart, a little bit of funk. Fairly well balanced. The sourness is under control. Overall, very enjoyable and pretty drinkable."
"D: Not too shabby. Not really one of my styles, perhaps, but a good example of the style."
"Drinkability: I'm still not completely on board with this whole wild ale thing - it's a slow and steady acclimation process, as with any new style. That being said, this was a pretty enjoyable beer in my opinion. It was absolutely incredible smelling, not nearly as tart as some wild ales I've (enjoyed/been subjected to), and overall a very pleasant experience, with a completely manageable abv. Recommended."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ light amber color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, big tart cherries, with some oakiness. In the taste, SOUR!! cherry, oak hints and a touch of vanilla. A sour bite, and a medium to light mouthfeel, with a dry, tart cherry and white grape aftertaste. Big sour, big cherry, FANTASTIC!!"
"D: God damn it. Why can't beers like this be on the shelves of the store. That being said this is a treat. The cherries and the fact that it was a brown ale blend everything nicely. A good starter for someone wanting to try a wild ale. I find that Russian River nails that tart sourness better than just about everyone."
"Pours a light brown, dark gold in color. Smell is tart cherries and funk. There are also some wine qualities from the barrels as well. Taste is more of the tart cherries and a good amount of the Brett showing as well. Tart and sour on the mouthfeel and non-cloying. A real joy to drink. Everything melds itself together well and no one characteristic dominates. Very good sour."
"D : Why did I just get one bottle of this? This is an awesome beer that I want to have again and again. This is one beer that I can't find any faults with and have no idea how you would even improve it."
"this is a wonderful beer. of all three russian river wild ales i've tried so far, this is the one that i can say is certainly worth EVERY penny."
"Supplication (noun): humble prayer, entreaty or petition. Mr. Cilurzo, I humbly ask that you do whatever is in your power to return to the days when those of us who reside outside of California were able to have Russian River beer delivered to our homes. Supplication is well worth its lofty ranking on The Top Beers on Planet Earth."
"Pours a bright orange with minimal white head. Smell is very nice! Lemons, ripe pear, sour green apples, green grapes, tropical pine apple! Wow! So many smells coming and going! Taste is wow. Begins with a puckering lemon juice, hints of lime, white wine tropical notes of pine apple and a wonderful transition to a green apple finish. Mouthfeel is refreshingly carbonated... I am in love!"
"-on tap at the Falling Rock $6.50 per 1/2 pint and worth every penny. Nice brown-red-orange color in the wine glass. Smells sour, dull, hmmm, bottle was better. It tastes nice and sour with some cherry and it does pucker. A lot of people were ordering this and I already knew why. An awesome sour but I preferred the bottled version oddly."
"drinkability is great. the interplay and balance between all the elements here is superb. the depth and complexity keeps you going back for more. i wish i had a case of this so i could just keep drinking it..."
"Finally time to supplicate. Pours a nice clear brownish red with a white fizzy head. Nose is balls out sour funk with some oak and very slight maltiness. Taste follows with typical wild RR flavor. Lovin the brown ale base here, as it adds an interesting subtle flavor to the brew. some light fruit flavor in here, but mostly a brett funk face melter. mouthfeel is nice, a little thicker than you average wild. Drinkability is second to few or none, as are all the RR sours i have yet tried. Thanks again mac to the Murch."
"Supplication is another wonderful creation from Russian River. The levels of tartness along with the semi-sweet qualities make this a great beer. Very thirst quenching with a little of that puckering ability. Thanks for picking these up for me Derek!"
"Drinkability is very nice, flavorful and acidic without being overly sour or sweet, no vinegar notes either, it's really close to my taste in wild ales, well made, and gets bonus points for rarity, especially on draught!"
"Fairly drinkable for the style- has a lot going on throughout the beer and my mouth is pretty puckered after this one."
"Thanks to BBothen for the chance to try this"
"D: Rarity and scarceness should not stop you from obtaining/relishing/savoring/enjoying this offering from RR. Amazing! I will jump at the opportunity to enjoy this beer again."
"This is a world class brew in my book and thanks go out again to Dana for sending this my way!"
"I like it, very much, but thinking about more than one bottle at a time is not appealing. That being said, I'm sure the brewer didn't intend this beer to be sessioned. Something to savour for sure, if you are a fan of sourness, this will test just how much of a fan you are."
"The finish is dry and crisp and is carried along the whole way by a wonderful blend of carbonation and tartness, body is medium. I wish that this bottle was twice the size that it was, but I'll relish the fact that I've got a few more waiting. Just a highly drinkable and highly enjoyable brew."
"Big thankyou goes to jw347 for sending this bottle my way. This will be my first time drinking a beer from Russian River Brewing Company. Poured in to a wide mouthed wine glass a strawberry color, with a very nice, sizable white head show. Aroma is wonderfully funky, with those micro bacteria showing themselves early on. Lemon juice, sour cherry, vinegar, and a slight dry champaign character are in there too. Taste hits the palate with a wave of sour funk, tart fruit, and a lovely, almost spicy feel. Carbonation is just right, giving it even more of a champaign feel. This is one to let warm up a bit as well, as many more complexities push themselves forward. Drinkability is quite good for this style, as the carbonation helps things out. For me, this resembles a Cantillon beer, which is very impressive, because their beers are so complex. I would say that if anyone wants to get an idea of what this beer tastes like, to grab some Cantillon, assuming that it is available in your area. This is an exceptional wild ale. I cannot wait to try some of the other offerings from Russian River. Cheers"
"Overall- Boy was this 1 tart! Quite unique and enjoyable is you like sour tartness. A little like a sour patch kid candy!"
" I'm all for pushing the bounds of yeast!"
"I don't feel I need another, but already I'm wondering about the Avery Fifteen in the cellar & the Riserva that's headed my way via FedEx. I need to try more of this Wild Ale thing."
"Do what you can to try some Russian River sours. Supplication is the epitome of what an American wild ale/sour beer should be."
"This is an amazing sour beer. Its a must try for anyone who calls themselves a beer nerd or beer geek. This really is a beer that is on the extreme side."
"Prosit, und Zum Wohl, MK"
"This poured an orangish copper in color with tinges of red and brown. It had a fluffy head of beige bubbles with faded to leave some island lacing from the constant bubbles. The nose showed off the sour cherries along with other red fruits, ""brown"" wood and an herbal funkiness. In the mouth this is extremely sour and acidic with the tart cherries being the domminate flavor and a tannic grip on the finish. While acidic, the midpalate does come off as balanced with a nice combination of carbonation and supple edges."
"D: Interesting beer. Sour beers are slowly growing on me....this is the most palatable RR I've had."
"Pairing this with a nice rare cut of red meat will bring out some additional characters in the beer. Enjoy this one for awhile, let it warm up a bit and hang on."
"Thanks again to Grant for the opportunity to try this!!"
"Supplication's another fine beer from Russian River. I characterized Beatification as ""art in a bottle"" and this is no different. These really are special beers. Russian River's the most artistic brewery I've encountered. Their beers are really unlike anything else I've tried. Truly special and unique. Hopefully they'll distribute on a more widespread basis someday."
"D: The wood, vanilla and funk are incredible. This is a great beer to sip from a snifter."
"Again this is a great rare beer that could be drank every day but is best shared with friends to make great moments."
"Long sour finish. Very tasty brew and one I wish I could have more often."
"Very drinkable but to rare to drink often. Another smashing hit from Russian River."
"The first sip is very tart, with a slight cherry finish to it. It definitely has some solid bite to it. The more it warms up the more the wine-like qualities of the beer come through, and the tartness mellows somewhat. Some light phenols and hints of brown sugar are there as well. The carbonation is rich and gives it an excellent mouthfeel. Overall, excellent beer."
"As for drinkability, the only reason it does not get a 5 is that it is so hard to come by. I could drink this all day, although it would have to be sipped :) there is no hint of alcohol in this one, completely masked by the tartness. I have a few more of these i wanted to age, but not sure how long i will be able to hold on to them now that i popped the first one open!"
"Overall: Great Brewer, Great Beer... If you have not tried it do all you can to get it. Wonderful!!"
"Drinkability - Not quite what I expected. I expected it to be much sweeter and more balanced than just a huge sour tartness. A cool beer for the style, but I don't get all the hype. I could throw one back every once in a while, but not something I would seek out as an elite beer. Too tart to the Extreme for my taste."
"D- I'm definitely not a fan of this style. However for what this beer is trying to accomplish, it does it perfectly. In the right arena this is an exceptional brew. I would probably enjoy this more if it were paired with foods, but I'm just drinking it straight up at the moment. If your into trying new different styles, this is a must. It's the best Wild Ale you'll get."
"Drinkabilityi s fairly high. Alcohol is moderate and flavors are great, but tart beers are always limited in their consumption."
"Taste starts off rather tart and acidic. Lime and cherry tartness make up the most of it. Relentless sourness is backed up by slightly sweet cherries, red wine, and oak. Delicious. Finish remains tart and acidic with residual cherries, leather, vinous grapes, and oak. Very well done. Medium body with a very dry finish. Spritzy, sparkling carbonation. Would love to get more bottles of this!"
"Thanks to cloudskipper for the hookup!"
"This is not a beer that is not easy for most of us to get our hands on. However, if you've not had it, you should travel, trade, or attend a festival to get it."
"D: Delicious. I could suck this down all day. The funky taste may get to you after a while but definitely not from this bottle!"
"On the nose with cherries, literally. Fragrant cherry aroma hit me immediately. Reminds me of cherry sweet tarts or smarties . Looks great in my Duvel glass, perfect lacing and nice head. Taste is more tart than sour with slight notes of cherry chloraseptic, but not in a bad way, must be the Brett. As it warms, noticeable oak, well balanced. Drinkable? As much as any 12.7 ounce $15 ""if you can get it at that price"" beer can be. Kind of bummer that it is not more affordable and available. Would love for it to have a chance to grow on me more and perhaps share a little with the wife. Very unique!"
"D- Now while I love this unique RR offering, it has to be in the right setting. This needs to be paired with food, or enjoyed as you would a liquor. I would love to have multiple of these on hand to drink on a whim."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. This is probably Russian River's most balanced beer. If you can find it, buy it and drink it."
"Drinkability- This is one of those brews that I could easily enjoy daily and probably not get sick of it. The sourness isn't over the top but it's prevalent enough to satisfy that sour tooth that I've acquired as of late. Terrifically balanced and funky I think this is a absolutely brilliant brew that must be tried! Big thanks to Matt for sending this my way!"
"Amber with some off white fizz. Tart, yeasty aroma. Begins with a sharp, prickly tartness and lively, acidic fruit over some bread and yeast. Mellows out quickly and layers of lean red fruit come through, with a lot of musty, earthy undertones. Barnyard, straw and wood notes add complexity. Cherry flavors are lean and subtle, but add some red fruit acidity. Mouthfeel is medium/light and a bit creamy. Complexities evolve as it warms, leaning toward juicier red fruit towards the end, with some semi dry sherry flavors. Finish is creamy and dry. Very very nice. As top notch as this is I think its a bit pricey. For $14 it should be a 750."
"Batch 003 poured into Delirum Tremens snifter. Poured a golden amber color with slight off white head that was at least 2 fingers thick. After minutes stil an active head with great lacing. Smell is sweet bread, a slight musty brett funk, a slight phenolic smell. Taste is sour cherries some spice, a little creamy buttery nut like flavor, and slight acidic bite. Mouthfeel medium body brew is on the dry side with a little malt sweetness to round out the feel. Carbonation is a perfect moderate level that makes this beer a light refreshing sour with a nice tart balance."
"D - Fairly easy drinking for the style."
"Overall I thought this was wonderful and well worth the price and the hassle to get it. These RR sours are unlike anything else made. It was truly unreal to see these develop and I am glad I have a few to lay down for a while. You really need to go out and get this one if you can find it, it is definitely worth it!"
"O: Best sour beer I've had to date (not that I've had a ton). Very drinkable once you get over the initial shock. I don't know if this will ever be a style that I just love, but this was surely worth the money. If this were more readily available, it would be something I'd try to keep on hand for when the mood struck me."
"Thanks to Weibull & drseamus, who traded me one of these last year."
"D: This is an eminently drinkable brew. Huge flavor, and a great drinking experience. Well done."
"Drinkability - easy to drink for the style, very good, wish I had more of it"
"D- This is another winner from RR. Well balanced, delicious, what more is there to say. Maybe not my favorite of the sours but it is certainly worth a try (or two)."
"I need to get some more of this stuff."
"D: Very drinkable for the style. I could have a few before needing something sweet or some food."
"I enjoyed this sour beer. Not my favorite style, but very tasty. An excellent change up from the hop trip I've been on. As a warning, stay away if you don't like tart flavors."
"Pours a rosey amber color with no head. More pleasant nose than most any of the other sours I sampled on the same evening. Nose of sourness, like funk and some dark fruitines. Taste is very tart, mild sweetness, and some fruitiness. Very oaky flavor and some dry, sour cherries as well. Quite tart indeed, yet still pretty drinkable. I can see this being really good, if Sours were my thing."
"M/D: Sour and hard to drink because of the lock jaw that ensued. I appreciate what the brewer was trying to do and that was create an amazingly sour beer for those who love sour like my wife but this intensity was a little to much for me. I will be having it again since my wife loves this one."
"Nice and refreshing. Great example of RR wild ale."
"D- I could drink this all night. I really like this beer. If I was to be perfectly honest, I didn't like cherry flavor only a few months ago. I have really begun to enjoy cherry flavor in beer. This is an incredible beer. I wish I had a case!"
"Pours a hazy copper with pink hues with fizzy beige head, little retention and spotty lacing. Smells of sour cherry, citrus zest, caramel, bread, yeast, and red wine. Taste is very tart with lots of sour cherry presence. Beyond that there is a taste of grapes, caramel, oak, brown sugar, and a musty funk. Medium-light in body with good carbonation and lots of tartness and an acidic balance. With a good amount of tart and sour flavors it isn't a beer for everyone, but it is certainly different and at least worth a try. A very unique brew that I wish I had more bottles of. Certainly not sessionable, but nice for a change every so often, especially for dessert."
"Pours a tan amber red, with a thin white head. Smell is a mix of sour fruit with musty funk, taste is more of the same. The beer has a good malt sweetness that comes through a little, but the taste is overall dominated by the tartness. A good beer, but not for all occassions."
"This was the first tart beer which I really appreciated. It had a tart cheery flavor in the mouth. A very good beer."
"Deep, burnt reddish orange with a light haze and short-lived foam. The colour was really gorgeous! The aroma was very earthy and woody, juicy cherry, delicate red grapes, a bit vinous, fruity, with tart berry. Mouthwatering tartness in the flavour with a very light acidic character, sour cherry and vinous, raspberry, woody and oaky. Perhaps a hint of funk. Medium to light bodied with a bit of residual sugar present - still some dryness though. Mild warmth in the finish. This stuff is super tasty! Highly drinkable and a great accompaniment to dinner. I'm glad I have another bottle, but I'd love to have more."
"The taste is fairly dry, much drier than the pasteurized Flemish beers, but still strikes a malty balance with a bit of caramel complexity to it. The finish is pleasingly acidic, with a leaning towards the acetic side of things. This beer is really well done, I am quite impressed, this is quite a bit farther along than the temptation. The finish has notes of a tannic woodiness, plus a long sour note that lingers along with the woodiness. This beer certainly reminds me of cherries, with a nice fruitiness to it. The more I drink it the more I become enamored of this beer, an authentic Flemish style sour beer that has not been pasteurized. This is quite a bit better, and much more balanced than New Belgium's La Folie. There is a wonderful interplay between the oak, maltiness, and acid character; this is superb and I can't wait to get more vintages of this."
"Pours a clouded reddish amber. Nose is a beautiful antiseptic funk. Flavor is outstanding. Crisp woody character with wild, barrel aged goodness. Outstanding. Feel is smooth on liquid. Great level of carbonation. For f**ks sake is this drinkable. Obviously a work of art."
"D - Could drink this consistently, if it weren't made in CA and not the easiest to get around me. This may not be the best sour beer that I have had, but certainly highly drinkable an a great offering from RR"
"D: This is definitely one of the best beers that I have ever had. I had had it once before when it was first released in stores here in SoCal a few months ago and really liked it, but this time wow. It's so easy to drink, I could have drank it in like 20 minutes, but I milked it for a couple of hours while watching the Santa Clause because it's so damn good. An extraordinary beer, couldn't recommend it more, go buy it, it's worth the price, even if it is about a dollar an ounce."
"Bottle purchased at Union Jack's in Glenside, PA. Poured ruby read with a touch of brown. Small, quickly disappating head. Thin lacing. Slightly cloudy. Smells of cherries, pungently. Some alcohol on the nose too. Taste is of tart cherries with an earthy sweetness below. Sour, puckeringly delicious malt. As it warms, the cherries soften, or at least become less tart, and some oak and more sour malt come through wonderfully. The finish has some hints of vanilla, which add more depth to the overall flavor. Medium bodied and somewhat sticky. A nice-drinking wild ale that demands to be savored. So many subtle flavors and odors make every sip a treat. A wonderous beer creation."
"Pours a hazy burned orange/caramel with a white head that dies completely. Smells of huge sourness, a little cherry and oak as an afterthought. Taste starts out mild then BAM, huge rush of tarty goodness. You want to pucker its so sour. Finally mellows out with the oak and cherry peaking through. Medium in the mouth and a tickle of either carbonation or the tartness giving its finishing move. You want to sip this because larger samplings at a time would be a waste. A very tasty and different libation."
"Excessively drinkable, complex enough to handle a variety of duties in food pairing, you simply must try this beer. And Russian River simply must find a way to produce more of it."
"The beer finally pours a cloudy ochre color with minimal beige head. Aroma is funky, musty, and some oak and tart cherry as well. First sip reveals a light body with almost no carbonation. The texture is a little thin to watery. Flavor is as expected with caramel and tart cherry, some wooden notes and a fairly dry earthy and vinous finish. Not a bad beer after the initial gusher, but not my favorite sour brew either."
"starts with a gentle cidery sweetness, then progresses to a tartly abrasive and sharply carbonated finish. leaves flavors of woody cherries, sour citrus, tart grape skins, and a slight acidity. a nicely complex, tartly refreshing, very drinkable beer."
"Sorry for not having better notes. I want to be sure to remember to have this beer again when i go to california."
"375mL bottle, corked and caged, batch 002. Thank you to barleywinebrewer for this gem. Served at cellar temperature in an Ommegang chalice. Poured a beautiful reddish orange with brownish highlights, that was quite hazy. About a finger of loose, bubbly tan head sat atop the brew. Had faded pretty quickly and left little lace. Smell is of sour cherries, red wine, and some pretty wild yeast/bacteria aromas. Had a nice yeasty, sour cherry, red wine flavor that was quite tart. Also wood and bacteria like flavors. A nice crisp but very sour finish. Nice medium bodied acidic mouthfeel. Great drinkability and very enjoyable. Not my favorite beer style but this one might change my mind."
"Temptation is looking like my favorite of the three barrel aged Russian River offerings, but this is another great brew."
"Pours a very unique, thick, murky, amber-brownish hue with a thin one finger light khaki colored head that seems to die down to a thin layer that stays for a good while. Stickiness isn't there at all. Smell is sour cherries, nuts, red wine, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is sour/acidic (but enjoyable) cherries, sounds pathetic but reminds me of a sour patch kid. Sweet and sour go back and forth fight each other on the tongue and in the end the sour seems to win the battle. Do I need to mention the Brett's? Well, I did...even though with any RR Wild Ale it's already a given. Beginning; sour. Middle; red wine. End; green apple. Such a complex brew, I'm sure I missed a crapload of flavors but these are the ones that stuck out to me. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a whole lotta carbonation. Crisp and bitter. Drinkability is pretty damn good. I took my time with it not because it was difficult to put down, but just because I wanted to get every flavor out of it I could. I look forward to the bottle of Sanctification I brought back from the brewery this summer. Russian River raises the bar with Supplication. Definitely enjoyed this one more than Temptation."
"Further proves why Russian River Brewing Company is the best of the best"
"Drinkability: This is hard to find in the Richmond area, and a few years ago I got, I think, the last two bottle that Once Upon A Vine had. I still have another one that I'm planning to save for something special, but this one was opened because it's been way too long without trying it. Certainly there are many characteristics related to a Saison, more so than Temptation even I think, but it's truly an experience, and I really hope more folks start to experiment with the style in the future. Worth the $9 in my opinion, but obviously not something you could probably get often (especially since the bottle's slightly over 12 ounces). But still, bravo, this is amazing stuff, and I hope the distribution increases throughout the US as the years go on."
"Crisp yet smooth mouthfeel coupled with the refreshing sourness make this beer highly drinkable. Probably my favorite RR sour ale, maybe even my favorite sour ale. If you can find this, consider yourself lucky, and do the right thing and buy it. I spent 18 dollars on the 375 mL bottle and feel that it was well worth it. Highly recommended."
"Delicate body, carbonation like champagne, very smooth and bubbly. Clearly a beer to sip but it's very rewarding as it evolves with warmth."
"Delicious, depthful, and drinkable by the case."
"Picked up a bottle of this at Capone's. Poured into an appropriate Russian River Barrel aged glass. Poured a dark red/light brown murky color. The smell was very yeasty which was expected because of the appearance. The taste was great. Sour and yeasty with a little carbonation. This was a nice wild ale and was enjoyed over an hour to experience different temps. Another good barrel aged product from Russian River."
"Drinkability is good here except for not being able to acquire more than one bottle at a time. Ky/California delima."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" light beige head over the reddish amber brew. Head fades gradullay, with plentiful slow-falling lace. Aroma is bubblegum upfront, with a strong tartness coming in after. Taste is cherries, sweet and then tart. Not noticing the barrel flavors as much as in Batch 001, seems a bit more lambic-leaning. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very nice. Tartness quenches the thirst as a bonus. Not quite as impressive for me as it's predecessor."
"Enjoyed this very much. Had a nice rich taste within a relatively light alcohol body. Acidity is its limiting quality, as it somewhat burns on its way down. Otherwise the sour and fruit work very nicely together."
"D: It's definitely a sipper. Would pair very will with food. Not something I'll be having very often but highly recommended in order to demonstrate the wonderful range of beer and the incredible things that are being done by American craft brewers."
"Pours a very cloudy reddish brown, nice tinge to it, thick off white, little reddish head forms, quickly settles down to a thin layer, thick ring around the glass, few lace spots. Smell is very acidic, lots of cherry, very oaky, toffee, sweet and malty once you get used to the acidity, excellent. Taste is very powerful, very malty, lots of sweet cherry, oak, toffee, touch of vanilla, sour cherry and funk, moves into a kind of minty citrus, more oak, malty dates, wow. Insanely complex, nice acidic finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, really coating, silky carbonation. Excellent beer, not as insane as Temptation but a broader range of flavours and I think a little more complex. Thanks Scott!"
"Drinkability: Batch 1 has been aging in my cellar for two years and has truly benefited from the age; an extraordinary accomplishment; (Batch 3 is a bit raw so if you have patience, wait a couple of years)"
"Drinkability: Normally such an acidic beer would keep the drinkability fairly low for me, but this is so good that I honestly don't mind it."
"Delicious beer; Id love to have a few cases in my cellar. Matched beautifully with an apple glazed duck breast."
"On tap and upgraded, enjoyed at the brewpub. Bold flavours, decent mouthfeels,despite sourness."
"Really great stuff."
"I traded a growler of Imperial Porter from Portsmouth Brewery for this beer. Chris at Ebenezer's Pub wanted me to try Supplication. (By the way, if you're ever in central western Maine, Ebenezer's in Lovell is a destination). This was a 375ml champagne bottle, Batch 002, poured into a tulip glass. Nice red color with very little head. It had a cherry aroma. The taste was primarily sour cherry, very tart and almost astringent. It was vaguely vinous. A little bit of yeast showed up late. Very good mouthfeel. The drinkability, to me, is limited by the tartness."
"Truly a remarkable achievement."
"Pours a hazy reddish orange with some sdiment and a nice white head that fades pretty quickly. The smell is wonderful- sour cherries and a bit of funkiness. The taste is even better, with an acetic quality to start followed by a long slightly bitter finish. There is some funkiness,but its restrained. There is also a noticeable hit of cherries at the end. I'm putting one of these bottles down for a yewar to see what happens. Very crisp mouthfeel. Eminently refreshing and drinkable."
"D- I think it is very nice. I would probably buy another bottle of this but it isn't #1 on my list. I think the beatification is a lot nicer."
"Absolutely fantastic. Blows away any other sour beer I've had. Amazing. The first beer I've had from Russian River and already I am absolutely in love with this brewery."
"Cheers!"
"Russian River is THE best brewery in America. Hands down. Vinnie truly is a beer genius. Can't wait to try other ""tion"" beers"
"Batch 002. Poured well-chilled into a Russian River Barrel Aged Ales stemmed glass, Supplication is a striking ruby and amber color -- like the blood orange Italian soda my partner brought home the other day -- hazy with a thin but persistent pinkish-grey head. Sour citric aromas (lime, kumquat, orange zest) mingle with a sharp bretty funk, some rubbery phenolic business, and a dusty attic floor scent. Mind-bogglingly complex, to say the least, and incredibly mouth-watering as well. Make that mouth-puckering. This is unbelievably sour, with an acidity that rivals the strength of Cantillon gueuze but retains a fruity zing that is entirely its own. There are slight cherry notes, along with an unripened raspberry twinge. The cherry flavor rapidly emerges to the fore with every degree warmer this beer gets. Mellow wood grain inflections. Tannic grapeskin in the aftertaste. Juicy mouthfeel up front due to the fruit flavors, but extremely dessicating from mid-sip onward to the cottonmouth-inducing finish. An amazing creation overall, and an exceptional beer with which to celebrate the arrival of warmer weather."
"A heck of a beer, sent by skinnyelvis for my BA annv.  thanks again!"
"A great example of American experimentation with craft beer."
"Got a nice pop from cork pull, poured a nice slightly cloudy darker orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some nice sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of sour/tangy grapes, cherries, citrus, malts, and slight caramel. The taste is sour/tangy, slight malts/hops, ends quite dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is another awesome brew from RR, highly recommended."
"I had the pleasure of having this beer completely by chance, as they aren't avalible in CT. Wow, what a beer, I'm a fan of the Jolly Pumpkin's and this was a natural for me. Great tart, friuty aroma that was present in the taste also. On top of this there was slight oak and malt flavors, amoungst a bunch of others that I couldn't even idenify, but did taste them there. The mouthfeel was standard for a beer of this type, and the tartness was not over powering by any standards. I wish I could taste there whole line of wild ales, but my home state has affectively shut me out of this oppertunity, damn shame, brewing is an art."
"Overall impression: As with most Russian River beers, I'm impressed. Huge depth of flavor - although it cost me a fair amount to get it to Colorado, it was more than worth it. Why aren't more American brewers experimenting with the wild styles?"
"This beer is a masterpiece."
"An amazing ale."
"Purchased at Stone Brewery Bistro. Man oh man, this was my first American Wild Ale, and it was a real beauty. After my first drink I already knew it was at least in top 10 favorite beers. I would even venture to say that it is my absolute favorite, right up there with De Ranke's Kriek. It smelled somewhat like a lambic, and it had a similar sourness to it, though I could certainly taste the aging in the Pinot Noir wine barrels...though the alcohol was only slightly present in the taste, it more so affected the mouthfeel adding a little warmth to it. Overall, it was a very distinct experience from tasting a lambic and I highly recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to crack open the one I have waiting at home in California as well as the RR Temptation in there as well. This indeed is the future of beer!"
"Great wild ale from RR. Nobody does this style better. Very complex and interesting taste. Definitely worth seeking a bottle of this out."
"D - highly drinkable. 9% but one of the least noticeable 9% brews I've ever had."
"This is my first Russian River experience, but so far they are some freaking ballers. OMG i need traders."
"This beer is batch 002 and consumed on 3/15/07. When I popped the cork, the beer rocketed out. The beer is dark amber in color with little yeasties floating in suspension. Floating yeast is to be expected from a bottle conditioned beer. The head fell quickly, although I did leave the bottle for a bit after it ran over. The aroma has a strong brett presence with a cidery aroma in there as well. The tart cherry taste, brett, and carbonation make the glands in my neck tingle. The brett is very pronounced and seems to make the body seem lighter and thinner. Overall, the only disappointment is the lack of body."
"Highly recommended. Truly masterfully crafted. This is a beer you give to someone who says all beer tastes the same. One taste and they'll beg forgiveness for spouting off such crazy fallacies."
"Pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smell is very tart, there are aromas of cherries, but there isn't a whole lot to them, predominant smells of sour and funk. This is not as sour as some other beers of this style, but that's not the goal, the goal is to create a damn good brew and I would say mission accomplished. There are sour cherries in the taste as well, but it's more of a vinegar-like sourness mixed with some oak and some grapes. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and had medium levels of carbonation, finish was dry. Extremely drinkable, I would have plenty of this often if I were given the chance."
"Drinkability: I want more, much more, this is now one of my favorite beers. I'm going to order a ton of batch 003 when they finally come out with it. Yum."
"Bottle exploded all over an we lost some of the beer (wait until the yeast is out of suspension when it gets to your house by mail). Yeah. Pours a slight head that goes away right away. The color is brownish gold with a cloudyness. The smell is very Belgian with Brett yeast and some horse blanket, but the age has made it so it's not too offensive. The taste is sour with an lemon-like aftertaste mixed with the horse blanket sourness. It's definetly like my first sour beer where I made a sour face, this is mellowed and nice. The mouthfeel is good, a little heavy like water, but nothing negative to say about it. Overall it was nice to try, I would have this again sometime."
"D - I am beginning to really love the combo of sour beers and cherries (thanks to the help from New Glarus) and Supplication is a great example of this combo. A fantastic beer. Wish I had ordered more."
"This beer is very drinkable and is very refreshing. Just a real pleasure to sit and sip on this beer and try to pick up all it has to offer. I look forward to cracking some bottles and exploring further."
"The body is difficult to judge when my whole mouth is puckering under the onslaught of tartness, but I would judge that it is medium and fairly dry. The 9% ABV is very well hidden. Crisp carbonation as one would expect. Quite drinkable for a strong tart beer. Reminds me quite a bit of Gueuze Boon Marriage Parfait, though with more oakiness."
"This is easily the most interesting beer I have ever tried. Highly recommended! It's a bit too funky to be an everyday drinking beer. This is so different... I just think I like Temptation just a little bit better."
"Its a hazy red with a bit of foam. Smells of oak, leather, paint. Tastes tangy and a touch bitter with cherry and pinot flavors for the barrels. Drink this one cool as the fruit flavors come out more. The funky bacteria flavors tend to overtake this one as it warms. A heck of an interesting brew though. I'd take this over Rodenbach any day. Cheers to RR for making weird stuff like this."
"This beer was exceptional. I could drink one of these every day, if only there was that much to go around. Get a bottle of this and drink it now..."
"Medium with a slight prickly feeling. I could drink this beer daily and be content."
"Pours a hazy deep orange amber color with a tall foamy off-white head that settles into a creamy lace. Sour cherries dominate the nose along with additional notes of sweet malt, leather, wet wood, and a barnyard / horse blanket funk. Quite sniffable actually. Taste is sweet lightly toasted malt and a bit of brown sugar delicately balanced by a tart cherry sourness along with a wild yeastiness and an earthy woodiness. Notes of oak and vanilla are detectable in the background. This was a real treat to drinkI only wish I had more than the one bottle."
"D: This is ecstasy in a bottle. Go get some. Sell off your children if necessary."
"this was truly a perfect pairing with a thick cut pork chop with a sweet and sour pan sauce (sweet vermouth, smoked bacon, shallots, plum tomato, butter, etc.), some roasted yams and a salad. just amazing."
"Lots and lots of samples at the GABF 06. This thing wreeks of funk and tart cherries. I love it. Golden straw color with lively carbonation with a spritzy white head. The cherries come through very nicely. Oat and then the bugs. Awesome stuff. Next time they are selling the barrel stuff online, Im pulling the trigger."
"Drinkability/notes: A difficult beer to review, certainly possesses a daunting complexity, but in a positive sense. Try it if you are able. Thanks to my friend and fellow BA HardTarget for sharing this rare example."
"D: gets better with every sip. That being said, I feel satisfied after drinking the one bottle...good thing too because it's $15/bottle."
"Polished, glimmering bronzed amber. Short cap of tanned, loosely piled bubbles that dissipates to a skim coat. Initial glass-covering large bubbled carbonation gives way to a narrow pillar of fine bubbles. Vibrant aromas of brett, cherry pits and tart skin, some damp wood. Simultaneously sweet and just a touch sour and funky. The taste starts with a nice tart sharpness that is filled with a dry cherry-laced sweetness. The underlying brown ale is readily discernable and serves as a solid base. Some damp wood becomes evident during consumption. The brett character is long in the finish and is complimented by a bit of sourness in the tail end. As it warms, the sweetness comes up a touch. Medium body with barely detectable carbonation, the light sharpness reduces the body a bit. There is a light slickness that glazes the tongue. It was hard to put the glass down as the Supplication was absolutely enjoyable. Unfortunately it was my last bottle, but I am looking forward to the next release."
"Mouthfeel is great, excellent carbonation, with clean biting, semi-dry but still wet. Yes, I wanted more after my half glass was gone, still wanting more."
"Hazy, reddish-brown color with about a finger or so of off-white head. Musty aroma, full of cherries, and also a slight tartness. Almost like a little lemon zest has been added. Nice and funky flavor, with a great sour cherry flavor. A little oaky and some vanilla. Also a little bit of lactic acid flavor. Velvety mouthfeel, great carbonation. It seems like there are new flavors coming out with every sip. Very nice offering!"
"Cork pops off with an explosive pop. The beer pours aky red in color with a moderately thin off-white head. Very sour aroma! Big cherry flavor with a nice oaky character. Flavor starts very sweet. Gets a bit rough on the tongue mid-palate -- like licking a cork. Oaky woodiness then comes through fairly strongly, blending nicely with a semi-sweet cherry flavor at the finish. Yeast pour mellows the flavor a bit, enhancing the fruity character nicely. Another great one from Russian River!"
"i've got nothing but praise for vinnie. truly a pioneer"
"Lovely bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Really velvety and attractive. Smellability is off the scale, but drinkability not so much for me as the oak is a bit much, and the palate just isn't that interesting. Some additional cellar time might allow the sourness to build and break through the palate adding balance and interest. We'll see. Regardless, an inspiring effort and one hell of a nose. Batch one."
"Thanks to Eric for hand carrying it to Texas for me!"
"Initially, the first thought upon getting a whiff of this brew is ""lambic."" Sour, musty funky cherry aroma, but there's also a very earthy rotted pumpkin thing going on here. Innnteresting. Flavors meld beautifully; upfront tartness yields to woody birch bark flavors, followed swiftly (as this is all too quaffable) by the lingering mildly sour cherry vanilla notes. Carbonation is noticeable on the palate, yet somehow has a creamy, lactic milk-like feel that I've never tasted. Usually it's one or the other; this is well carbonated and strangely creamy. What the? Can there be a creativity rating? This gets 5's there. Extremely unique, tasty, complex and worth seeking out."
"Just find it and drink it!"
"Body is very smooth and buttery, with a soft, creamy texture and amazing drinkability. Another superb product from a brewer that is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites."
"Thanks to Ray and Cornelia who shared this at the Charlotte BA tasting. absolutely beautiful bottle score extra points (hey, it's my opinion). The only other Wild Ale I've had is also from Russian River (Insanity?). Nice copper color with sour grape taste and smell. It's hard to be ""wild"" over this style, but I believe Russian River has nailed it."
"I'll definitely pick this one up again on occasion, and I'd like to try it with a heavy meal, perhaps some tri-tip and mashed potatoes."
"I :heart: this beer."
"Hazy orangey-brown with floaties and a white 1-inch head. Aroma is stong cherries as soon as the cork is popped. Vinous with a faint band aid aroma. Taste is sour cherries and grapes. Vinous, vinegary alcohol. Sourness hides any hop or malt complexities. Mouthfeel is nice. Bubbly creamy,medium body. Drinkability is hindered by extreme sourness & alcohol. Not my style, as I prefer the temptation."
"Pours an amber color with very little head that falls fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly sour, but not nearly as sour as I expected it to be. The flavor is surprisingly smooth. Slightly soured, but very mellow. Some fruits linger on the palate as does a light bit of maltiness. The aftertaste is very inviting. The body is light and the drinkability is very good. Very nice beer."
"Pours a lightly ambered color with a finger of head over top that falls to a healthy cover over top. Clarity is moderate, with a bit of haze and without apparent carbonation. Good looker. Nose is excellent, with moderate sourness, with a very solid backing of cherry. Its not biting, but very inviting. Almost a touch of acetone-like aromas that I associate with sour browns. Flavor is very nice, mildly sour, moving towards a very smooth cherry fruityness, finishing with a light tartness. Aftertaste is very solid sour cherry that lingers well in to the finish, enticing me to drink more and more of this beer. Very nice balance between fruit flavor and sour tinge. A mild sourness hangs on the sides of my tongue into the finish as well. Very excellent. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It doesn't interfere with the flavor while having enough carbonation to make it lively. Drinkability is awesome. No hint of the alcohol at all in this one. Its smooth and enjoyable while having a prominent sour character. The fruityness is excellent, and compliments the base beer excellently. Well worth the wait."
"A rich tangy pour with bubbles clinging in ribbons on the glass. Mouthfeel is a soft spritzy flavor with gentle hints of brets. Similar yet remarkably different from the temptation. Was it worth the 8.99 a bottle? Let's just say i'm not gonna go run and get a 6 pack"
"It's quite simply remarkably bizzare and flavorful, yet somehow completely pulled together and ultimately refreshing! It's astonishingly entincing, enaging, and almost consuming."
"Drinkability is very high. Amazingly complex and I can imagine each bottle tasting very different from the last. Memorable for sure"
"Simply an amazing brew, with a fiery orange color, a dynamic and vibrant aroma and an astonishing medley of flavors. Meticulous balance of cherries, yeast and oak, producing a range of flavors. Vinnie does great work with Sour Belgians. I love the wine barrel aging and the vinous character."
"Not over-the-top wild, but already quite complex, and another 3-5 years in the cellar should further ""Supplicate"" this Vinnie masterpiece further."
"Bought this bottle (375 mL, olive green, batch 001) a month or two ago and finally mustered up the will to open it - which I had a hard time doing as the cork was a bit stubborn. I served it just below cellar temperature in a flute/goblet type glass I've got. It pours a beautiful hazed golden/orange/peach color with lots of carbonation and 2 fingers of tan head which consists of small bubbles and reduces to a half-inch, sticking to the glass throughout. It smells sharply tart with sweet and sour cherries, not-quite-fresh milk, oak, a good funkiness, and grapes, currants and blackberries which show up later. It's really making my mouth water wondering how it's gonna taste. It is sour/tart, but not as powerful as I thought it was going to be. There's also some malts, sour cherries, oak, the fruits I mentioned above, and some medicinal and vinous qualities. The pinot noir barrels in which it was aged contribute mainly to the aftertaste, which has grapes, blackberries, and currants, and a dry, woody coating effect similar to the few pinots I've tried. Initially the body is sharp and dry with a carbonation that is high but not prickly and it evolves from being light and airy to medium and smoother. Quite an interesting beer, and one that tastes like a gueuze mixed with a pinot noir. Hats off to Russian River for attempting such a mysterious creation. My only complaint, as others have noted, is that the bottle is too damn small, but other than that, keep up the good work."
" Taste is fucking amazing! Great pinot noir flavor, vanilla, cherries, oak, plus dirty barnyard notes. Slightly sour. Mouthfeel is great, just like that of the Temptation I had before this. Just as impressive as Temptation. I've found the new crack!"
"Drinkability: The tartness beats down the palate but I found it to be very interesting. The best of the tasting flight we had."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for sharing. Batch 001: Ruddy amber color with a thin light beige head that disappears almost immediately. Barely any light penetrates. Tiny rising bubbles and lacing that races down the sides of the glass. Aroma of grapes, brown sugar and sweet candy. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel, and a bold vinous character. Flavors of dark cherry and light spice and oak. The flavoring does not linger too long though. The finish is extremely dry and feels like it is sucking the moisture from your tongue as you drink it. The finish is moderately sour and peppery. Overall a very well-made and enjoyable beer."
"Gotta send thanks out to the Bum for yet another RRB product. It's much appreciated."
"Overall: This is a truly interesting brew, and although I don't love it quite as much as Temptation, I would highly recommend it if you want to try something funky and tart. One note, though, is that I really felt this one got much better as it warmed even after I served it at just under cellar temp."
"Reading the label while I imbibe, its tells of all of the work that went into creating such a brew.: the 12 month aging in French oak Pinot Noir barrels for one year with three strains of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, & Pediococcus. This is a labor of love, brewer Vinnie Cilurzo is clearly ahead of the curve in his creativity."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep red color ale with a medium foamy slightly off-white head with average retention. Aroma of sour cherries and oak are clearly detectable. Taste has a clear sour cherries feel to it with some distinctive note of acidity and oak. Tartness was delectable but could have been more present. Even though this is an excellent Flemish sour, I though it could have had more tart and more complexity in general (i.e. De Dolle Oerbier Reserva). Id definitely take more RR Temptation over this any day."
"The beer pours a nice copper hue with a short foamy white head. I served this one up in a tulip glass to help capture the aromas. The smell was that of a tart lambic with note of toasted oak. The yeast in the aroma was somewhat remeniscent of Orval. The flavor was full of tart cherries, oak, and chardonnay. The malt fills out the flavor and provides a medium mouthfeel. Considering this beer is 7% ABV, it's amazingly smooth - very drinkable. The carbonation is tight and compliments this beer's punch. Highly recommended if you can score a bottle. I recently went to Russian River Brewing and sampled 6 different Belgian beers on tap. All were excellent, but Supplication was notably different and much more complex than those on tap."
"Give me funky cheese, some grapes, some apples, some more bottles of this nectar and a glass. Astonishingly drinkable, this beer is so simple but so complex. It is genius. The warmer the beer became the sweeter and more luscious this beer turned out to be. If you love sour beers, you must try Supplication. I am happy I purchased a bottle online from RR, it was worth every cent. I highly recommended. Why did I wait so long to drink this gem!"
"The mouthfeel is what made this beer for me. Very champaign like. Supper smooth and so active on the tongue. What an incredibly fascinating beer. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who wants to try something different. Not a typical beer by any means but a great example of creativity in brewing. Wish i had more of these."
"A real eye opener in terms of what can be done with beer in the U.S."
"This is an awesome sipper. Definitely give this a whirl."
"If you like Flanders Reds, then you should love this beer. If you expect something else (like I did), you'll be disappointed."
"Drinkability- Wish I hadn't had the first half of this with cheese. Tried Camambert cheese for the first time and found I didn't like it's salty taste. So, the first part of my beer experience was muted. Thankfully I have another few bottles and can get a couple more before they disappear. Overall a really tasty beer. One that I will be sure to have again, hopefully many times. Quite a production from Vinnie...would you expect anything else though? Can't wait to have it again."
"I took 3 bottles home and have had 8 tulips of this beer before the keg was killed."
"I poured the beer into a nice tulip glass and admired it for awhile. I got a nice thick bubbly, off white head that lingered for awhile. The fruit aromas you get from there beer are very pleasing. Cheeries and citrus. I really enjoyed the carbonation and tart taste in my Supplication. This definitely takes on some characteristics of wine or champagne which is a nice take on beer. I will surely be back for a few more bottles and hopefully find it on tap in the near future."
"Batch 001. Special thanks to Brewbacca for the trade."
"Awsome beer from Russian River and Vinnie. Like I said before, unlike anything I've previously had. Almost too good for words."
"Not bad, but I wouldn't call it a drinker. Definitely has alot of craftsmanship involved. I would have it again on another special occaision."
"Notes: Ehhh"
"A pretty classy ho."
"A small head coats the sides as you drink this bad boy down. Cherries are front and center followed by the taste of a nice champagne yeast, unlike anything I have ever tasted in a beer before. This was followed by the nice flavors of a mild brown ale. Tart, but not overly slow with a tangy middle and a nice ale finish. Just a real gem."
"DAMN, this was good."
"Hazy peach with a large fluffy head that dies down pretty quickly. Smell is very strong - floral and herbal characters along with a vinegary smell dominate. There is definitely some sour cherry in there, and a woody smell. Taste is more of the same. The taste is a tad muted, but well done. A tiny bit of spicy alcohol shows through but other than that it is well hidden. The sourness is mild in this brew compared to most of the Belgian lambics I've had, but the cherry taste seems to come out more, along with a vinous character. Finish is very clean with some lingering oak. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style, pretty thin. Could use a bit more carbonation. Drinks very easily. Very interesting brew."
"Pours a beautiful, cloudy, amber/pink color with a fluffy white head. A good 1/4"" of head lasts the whole way down. Lovely aroma of earth with a slight mustiness, behind it all a bright ""sense"" of cherries. Great cherry sourness in the flavor. Spiciness abounds-somewhat peppery though NOWHERE near as ""hot"" spice-wise as Catillion's Rose d Gambrinus, which I liken this to. The tart/sweet combo is amazing. Great body. Quite amazing. This is a lot more my speed then the similar Catillion products. A damn fine beer and a great product by American brewers for sure."
"Very tasty."
"Found myself holding the bottle over my glass trying to milk out any remaining drips or drops of beer in there."
"A most stupendous creation."
"The beer pours a cloudy burnt orange color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice sour cherry scent laid over a mild malt base comprised of pale and crystal malts. The taste is awesome. It has a smooth Belgian brown ale flavor with loads of sour cherries in the taste. It goes down like candy and finishes sour and slightly warm. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a fantastic brew. I love everything about it. I only wish it came in bigger bottles."
"Drinkability is good only thing hurting this one is price I think about 10 at the Vintage Cellar when they have it. Thanks to George I now have one in my cellar :)"
"Man, this was really good; so easily drinkable. At $10 I wanted to savor it yet had a tough time pacing myself to get the fullest enjoyment possible from the all-too-small bottle. Another gem from the creative minds at Russian River."
"Really nice beer. Picked up a few extras to cellar. Wondering how the fruit will change as it's pretty subtle now. May fade entirely."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, wine-like, chewy but pleasant, sweet & sour."
"As this brew warms it becomes even funkier...simply out of this world!!!"
"Drinkability- This one reminds me of an oaky, Flanders Red Ale blended with a geuze. Very satisfying sipper that is quite tasty and refreshing. Complexities abound. Very expensive stuff here. I could have purchased a Rochefort 10 for the price of this one. I'm going to lay down my other bottle for a few months and see what happens."
"A few weeks after, I finally got to try this on tap at BCTC 2005 and there was no diacetyl component at all which left us with beautiful vinous, nutty sweet and sour flavors of cherries, vanilla and a miraculous drying finish. Generous earthiness with a funky soily apple skin yeastiness. This goes from a 2.8 to a 4.1 in my book and is a piece of art."
"Very nice! A strange and wonderful creation. This is certainly a thinking beer. I'm very impressed with the hopping and the overall complexity. I can't wait to have more from Russian River, this is my first experience."
"I have one more to age for a year and am hoping it will sour even more...cheers to Vinnie at RR for this one."
"Drinkable? All day long, baby. All day long."
"12 ounce corked and bailed bottle, Batch 001, $9.29 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, Va."
"About $15.50 for a 375ml at Capital Ale, Innsbrook."
"There has been much love, sweat, detail, patence, and time put forth into this brew. This is truly exceptional offering from what I am experiencing to be atrul exceptional, creative daring brewery. TRY IT and SAVOR! Wonderful!!"
"What a great sipper."
"Drinkability: Well, let's be frank: if this were available in conventional six-packs, they'd run you about $50, so to say this is ""drinkable"" might be a stretch. Still, as an occasional treat, it's a unique and tasty example of the craft to be sure. Made me smile. I have another sitting in the cellar -- we'll see what a year does to it."
"O: This is unique and delicious. Proof that if you take the care in brewing a beer you would in creating a fine wine, the results can be just as mind blowing."
"RBSG 2005... Poured a hazy orange gold color with a light, off white head, that left spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of diactyl, herbs, tart grapes, and a touch of caramel. Taste of sweet malts, oak, coconuts, yeast, tart, and sour grapes. Thanks Eyedrinkale"
"Small corked and caged 375ml. from batch #1. The cork comes out with quite a loud pop. Appears a murky deep orange with good sized off white head. Pretty good amount of sticky scattered lace covering the glass. The tart aroma hits you as soon as you pour this. As it warms funky yeast and woody scents come out more. Lighter notes of cherries and other lighter fruits appear at times as well. Flavor is equally complex with a big tartness and a smaller balancing sweetness coming on strongest. Plenty of interesting yeast things going on including the brett funkiness. Oak notes and sour cherries play into it as well. Some vinous notes at times. Dry sourness on the aftertaste. About a medium body with a dry, tart and tangy feel to it. I found it also quite refreshing. Very interesting stuff it keeps you coming back for more trying to figure out every thing that is going on. By the end of the glass though my palette seemed a bit wore out from all the flavors but I would have gladly drank a 750 of this. Excellent all around brew a must try."
"One of the best I've had in a long time."
"Drinkability: This is hard to quantify. I have to say a four, because I think I could (at most) drink maybe three glasses of it. It's a sipping beer, a conversational beer, not a session beer."
"I would recommend this beer for belgian lovers as well as beer aficianados trying to mature the tastes of a yellow beer or red wine drinking friend with an open mind."
"Update: After a year I drank my second bottle, the strong cherry has melded into a perfect balance with the malt and matured brett character... A different beer then it was, but as good if not better."
"375ml corked bottle, makes a loud pop when opened. Pours a murky garnet hue into my goblet, makes a thin white head of very fine bubbles. Aroma is earthy with sweet dark fruits, bit of caramel and yeast. Flavor is acidic and sour... huge profile of sour cherries... a bit bready, peppery, moderately dry and bitter. Solid meduim palate leaving very thin syrup coating in the mouth, carbonation is high with a likeness to champagne and a warm finish. I like this alot, it is an excellent offering from Russian River. Highly recommended!"
"Smooth and creamy with virbant carbonation that dances across the palate. Each subsequent sip leaves me in anticipation of the next. I really wish this bottle was 750ml as I'm dreading the end of my glass and I could lust after each sip of this beer all day. Truly a work of brewing art if there ever was one and without a doubt one of the most complex, unique and well built beers that has ever graced this beer drinkers lips. Highly recommended and not to be missed. Vinnie has created a masterpiece that I sincerely hope to have the pleasure of drinking again. Many thanks to irishsnake for the amazing opportunity."
"Overall. The only reason that this beer isn't straight 5s is due to the fact the flavors are very strong in this and quite simply, I couldn't have more than one in a single sitting. Apart from that though, I don't see much fault in this beer at all. I kind of consider myself lucky to have been able to try it. Wow."
"This is truly a wow nose of wild yeast cherry goodness that I whiffed like a cigarette inhale after the loud pop from the champagne cork. Hazy, orange amber color with not much head on the pour. I was not sure if this would be better cold or warmer so I took a big first drink and it was as good as the nose. It had tremendous layers of flavors with an easy to approach funkiness and tartness allowing the cherries to balance this complexity and hold it together. As it warms and your palate starts to love the tartness, the buttery oakiness adds yet another layer of flavor and the cherry flavors come forward beautifully. It was $8.00 for a 12oz bottle at Ledgers  pricey but worth a try to see what American brewers are capable of when their obsession matches their talent."
"While the cherry flavor never fully emerged, I was certainly treated to a subtly sour beverage that was impressively well balanced and dry. If one could register a complaint, it's that a leisurely approach to drinking this allows it warm to the point where a slightly boozy red wine burn develops that distracts from the interesting funk and wood flavors present in the beer. Nonetheless, quite an accomplishment."
"Another amazing, boundary-pushing beer from Vinnie. I only wish I had another bottle to cellar. I have a strong suspicion that this beer will become doubly amazing with a few years on it..."
"A shame the bottle is so small, as this is extremely enjoyable... wish I had more than half a bottle to taste, but glad niftypat shared it with me.. definetly need to find some more bottles of this"
"for a beer, this is something else. leaps and bounds beyond the flemish wild ales, but just a tad bit less crazy than the hype will lead you to believe."
"Thanks to my good M8, East Coast Worker cum wannabe Northern-West Coast Resident; Gentleman BA Rapopoda. Im not sure I am worthy of such a gift."
"By far the best American beer I have had this year, It is beers like this that inspire and show where modern American brewers can go ... there are no boundaries."
"Dark orangeish/red with a nice head of light beige/tan foam that dies kind of quickly, but is easily revitalized by swirling my oversized wine glass. Some lace is present as well and it is quite sticky and leaves some interesting patterns. The aromas are all brett, lacto, and sour cherry/oaky funk. Beautiful. The taste is a beautiful blend of funk, oak, cherries, acidic notes, and more. The mouthfeel is super creamy, smooth, and this beautiful brew just slides down ones throat. Drinkability is perfect as well. This is similar yet different than Alexander Rodenbach, but man this stuff is probably better! Just a brilliant Flemish red sort of hybrid oaky cherry brew."
"One more note. Im hesitant to send in a change of style request since I am certainly no expert on Belgian sour ales, but the big malt here makes me think that this is more of a brown (Oud Bruin) than a red. However, this is aged in oak (old pinot noir barrels), so who knows."
