The cherries immediately hit the nose, but no funkiness smell. The cherries provide a stronger sweetness than tartness.  Immediate cherry taste on the tip of the tongue with a nice tartness at the back of the tongue.  There was no sourness or yeastiness expected from a funky standpoint.  Taste is close to balanced, with sweetness slightly stronger than the tartness.  Moderate carbonation and a medium-light body.  It didn't have much yeast or alcohol kick. Good cherry sour, could be have better funk. Solid beer.","OKbrew89","Feb 26, 2015"

Big vinegar aroma, definite tart cherries in there, sweet cherry juice, dry aroma, some vanilla or oak notes. Flavor is lightly tart cherries, a bit sweet, not much funk or lacto sourness here. Sort of like fizzy cherry juice. Light bodied at first but the cherry comes off a little syrupy, big carbonation, prickly on the tongue. This doesn't taste bad by any means, but not Prairie's best effort as it lacks the funk and other sour notes one would expect from a beer like this.","BMMillsy","Jan 20, 2015"

On the palate it has light, tame funk notes, a bit of tartness and cherry notes, and surprisingly little else. Not much in the way of malt to back or any real sourness to take it over the top.

The taste of the cherry works well with the funk in the taste w/out any cherry cough syrup type flavor bu more lemony cherry type combo -in that it is tangy and finishes in a refreshing way. Overall -Excellent cherry beer with mild funk in the flavor it seems to me like a beer inspired by Belgian Lambic as the fruit flavor is prominent and this was a nice treat for me for a wednesday in the 'Burg before Christmas. I would definitely want to see if there is any diference in the bottle version -great cherry taste.","Slatetank","Dec 27, 2014"

The aroma of lemon tartness arises with an addition of cherries. Cherry lemonade anyone? This is especially more true with a taste. Cherry Funk doesn't provide much cherry or funk when compared to the tidal wave of tart lemonade. And more tart lemonade. Dabs of cherry and a vague funkiness don't make much of a mark here; it's a singular tart beer without much variation, and for that reason I'm not floored by Cherry Funk.","DoubleJ","Sep 27, 2014"
