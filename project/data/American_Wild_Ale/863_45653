Aroma is sour cherries (the currants?), vinegar, barrel notes of oak and grape, plus tobacco and the yeast/bacteria funk. Flavors start with puckering tart cherry, ease into light fruit sweetness, and end with those drying red wine elements. Medium-full bodied, silky texture, active carbonation, and a dry finish. Complex and interesting overall.","SierraFlight","Mar 01, 2015"

I hate to sound sacrilegious, but this beer really didn't do it for me. It just wasn't what I was looking for. If I really wanted all of those wine flavors, I might as well have gone with wine. I have found a few Belgian sours to be more pleasurable and interesting to me, but it is obvious that many people get very excited about this beer, so I couldn't not recommend it. At this price point though, I think I'll be holding off for a while before reevaluating this interesting creation.","demon","Feb 22, 2015"

The barrel character provides wooden oak qualities, setting the balance of the beer. Then the sourness gets even dryer and more acidic, drying-out the tongue. Drinks dangerously easy, the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Finishes with matured, slightly wooden, leathery malts, with the addition of ripe grapes, while the tartness covers the outside of my teeth, leaving back a melange of joung currants and slick acidity.","aleigator","Dec 27, 2014"

Cherry, Grape, Oak, Green Apple, Cigar, Berries, Soda, Vinegar (think wine) a touch of Vanilla and Raisins. Nothing like I have ever had. I will say I thought 'Temptation' was a bit more satisfying for me. The more I sip, the more my palette really begins to crave it. Amazing carbonation.

Lots of dark stone fruit and vinegar on the nose with gobs of oak, vanilla and red wine, what an aroma! Incredibly complex. Sour on the tongue with lots of oak, vanilla, red wine and black cherry. Ends slightly bitter but doesn't last long. The complexity helps tame the 10% ABV. Medium bodied with silky mouthfeel. Carbonation is intense initially but overall rather light. Finishes dry. Overall, a beautifully crafted American Wild Ale that takes its place in the pantheon of great sours!","JohnG190","Aug 12, 2014"

Appearance is a deep, dark amber with almost no light penetration or head. Thick, chewy mouthfeel and a deep, vinous smell. Worth over penny. A perfect beer.","Antnego","Jul 29, 2014"

4.2,-6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, batch 005X2E. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing fairly quickly. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, plum, fig, red wine, oak, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, light vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit flavors; with a great sweetness/sourness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, acidic, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited wild ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2014"

They are really toe to toe and I may even be enjoying this a bit more but possibly because I hadn't had it for a good while. A classic, a legend, still wowing to this day.","MarcWP","Jun 09, 2014"

Ridiculously funky in the nose with a leveling sour tang in the taste that is wrapped up nicely in a package by the wine barrel and some encouraging fruityness at the finish. The true story behind the name of this ale is that Jesus did not turn water into wine but water into beer, hence the name. Recommend consumption during worship services. Recommend pairing with dark chocolate with strawberry filling.","CowsandBeer","Mar 15, 2014"

This one pours dark reddish purple with a hint of brown and a one finger off white head that dissipates quickly in a fizzy furry.. Aroma is strong vinous cabernet notes, sour vinegar, black cherry and other fruits. Flavor is a beautiful medley of dark cherries and sour vinegar, some bold wine like notes, other fruits, and a bit of booze intermingled with oak on the back end. Super tart and sour with nearly spritzy high carbonation. Heavy bodied and a big beer that can probably sneak up on you. Good stuff.","BMMillsy","Mar 04, 2014"

Big, sharp, bold flavors throughout. Almost no sweetness, all tartness with a drying aftertaste. Pretty unusual for a 10% ABV beer of any style.

The taste is vinegar and very little malt and granny smith apple peel.

It borrows a lot of characteristics of the used Cabernet barrels, but the base malt really makes itself known amidst all the sour, dark-fruity and earthy funkiness. There's a lot going on here that comes together very well, and it's truly an excellent bottle of beer to drink. (4.5)","Stevedore","May 05, 2013"

There's less focus on fruit or tart and lot more on grape must, oak melding properties, and bacterial funk. Not my favorite, but really refined and perhaps unlike any American Wild Ale in the country. I will be sure to save another one of these for a special occasion. It's not as accessible, and definitely for wine fans (such as myself) and of the strange and sour stuff, but it's definitely a must for people looking to get into more ambitious beer styles. World class stuff, in my view.","magictacosinus","Apr 21, 2013"

4.52,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"750mL b1 poured into tulip a clear, deep mahogany (cloudy brown with the yeast tossed in). Head is extremely temporary tan that evaporates. No lacing. Aroma is heavy on oak barrel character, port wine, sherry, sour cherries, a bit of spiced rum or whiskey. Amazing. Taste is mouth-puckering sour cherries, sherry, a bit of vinegar, warhead sour candies, a bit of warming alcohol towards the end. Palate is very much red wine: lots of Cabernet Sauvignon/blackberry/blackcurrant throughout the taste and palate. One of my favorites in the RR sour series. More robust than Supplication. Not as soft as Temptation and Sanctification.","tarheels86","Nov 13, 2012"

The beer's nose is complex with tart currant fruitiness, buttery oak, and blistering alcohol. As expected, this beer drinks like a fine wine with a tremendous amount of fruit forward flavor, yeast funk and oak. It's a touch too acidic, but the booming flavors pull together and mask the beer's staggering abv. The mouthfeel is puckeringly sour and mostly dry with a touch of initial sweetness. There is a mildly umpleasant funk that lingers, but the mouthwatering sourness cleanses the palate quickly. This is an excellent beer that's worth the hunt!","ThePorterSorter","Oct 11, 2012"

4.59,2,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Verdict: This is fantastic, this beer is aging gracefully although I would be weary of aging it too much further as the currant flavors could easily drop off leaving behind a bit of a vinegary mess. The fruit flavors are nice and tart and impressively potent which is all one can hope for in an aged beer. If you have the opportunity to try a vintage sour from Russian River, make no mistake, you will be well rewarded.","kevanb","May 23, 2012"
4.8,6.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"More amazing from the bottle than on-tap. Deep mahogany with a perfect dose of bone-colored foam on top. Sour certainly. But deep and complex. Cherry, plum, and toffee at the base with a nice spicy Brettanomyces note. Leather, shortbread, vanilla, and red wine vinegar as it warms. Great balance between fruit, sour, and malt. The price is steep, but the beer is nearly perfect. American craft beer at its finest. Oh, and the 10.5% ABV is silent.","bump8628","May 23, 2012"

The initial taste immediately caused me to think of a tart lemon candy. Though as the flavor develops, one can sense sour red fruit flavors that are rounded by oak chips. There are a certain vinegar notes, typical of a sour present. The spiciness leads well into the aftertaste which ends the experience on a dry note. The modest level of carbonation allows the flavors to linger and develop. Of course, this is improtant because Consecration is a complex beer.","JohnnyHopps","Apr 07, 2012"

Have you ever picked up a sack of apples that have fallen off the tree? The sack was left outside all night. You went out the next late afternoon and picked them up. The movement stirred the honey bees inside. You stuck your head in the sack. This beer tastes like that apple sack smells. I do enjoy how after the beer disappears from the palate and I lick my lips, there's a sweet taste that, subsequently, appears on the tongue. I'm still developing my palate for the wilds.

4.92,9.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Consecration is classified as an American Wild Ale, and the label gives hints of what awaits the lucky drinker. Words like Saccharomyces, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Lactobacillus hover around the words Sour Ale, and the excitement begins to build. Add all that to the fact the beer is aged in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels and you realize you have something pretty special in your glass. Consecration pours a reddish-brown, yet near the edges appears very plum like, with a quickly disappearing head that fizzes almost like soda. Hugely vinous aromas greet the drinker, including notes of vanilla, oak, Cabernet Sauvignon, and earthy hop tones/funk. The pallet erupts in an orgy of flavors, with the initial sourness giving way to darker fruit, citrus, Cabernet notes as well as earthiness (horse blanket) from the Brettanomyces. The fizziness noticed in the pour sticks around for the entire brew, a sign of a huge amount of carbonation that is met with a medium body.","phishsihq","Jan 25, 2012"

This is not a subtle beer, rather it grabs your taste buds and wrestles with them, challenging them to pick up and identify all the flavors. My overall impression of this beer is that it is yet another winner from Russian River and I’m glad there are so many Cabernet barrels in CA so that we can expect to see this one again and again.","drtth","Jan 25, 2012"

It reminds me of root beer in its appearance and slight carbonation bubbles steadily rising. There isn't a whole lot of brett funk in the aroma, but more of a wine aroma. A friend said 'paint stripper'. I said that's the smell of 'awesome'. I can't write a review that would adequately describe the taste of this brew, or do it any justice. It's tart, sour, but not overly so. Your mouth waters after each drink, begging for one more taste. It has the perfect balance, allowing you to drink this endlessly. Despite being a heavy-hitter at 10% ABV, you do not taste it at all. The warmth from it comes through, but that is it. Consecration finishes with an dryness that finishes its statement of 'Yes, you are drinking the most epic shit ever'.","stealth","Jan 12, 2012"

4.44,-1.3,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a dark amber - almost ruby red with minimal head and very little lacing. Beer was extremely aromatic and immediately noticeable once the cork was removed. Smells of a yeasty cabernet, wild cherries, roasty malts and oak. Those aroma characteristics were consistent with the flavor of the brew, some mild tartiness and yeasy flavors - a medium to heavy body, creamy texture and light carbonation ... very interesting. Not one I would continue to pursue due to personal tastes - but a very interesting beer to sample!!","brendaniel","Dec 11, 2011"

The wine barrel aging is readily apparent here, and it really makes this one memorable. Definitely an after dinner sipper, like dessert in a glass. If there were one nit, I would have preferred a slightly more tart finish with a little less oak presence. But it's a minor nit. Consecration is the real deal. Can't wait to try more RR sours.","siege06nd","Nov 28, 2011"

The high alcohol content is hardly noticeable, making this a very drinkable brew. The taste seems to only get better as it warms. Overall, an excellent offering from Russian River and so far, my favorite sour.","mooseo","Oct 18, 2011"
4.35,-3.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle to tulip. Smells good; like a strong ale should. Tastes Fantastic! I LOVE the Cabernet influence! Does wonders for the flavor. Complex, but not in a "" I taste plums, cherries, and earthiness, etc."" kind of way like you'd get from wine snobs. Just. Good. Beer. Mouthfeel is great; what looks to be relatively low-carbonated is actually deceptively carbonated, just as a sour should be. Overall, a great beer that I'll definitely be seeking out again!","b3shine","Oct 14, 2011"
4.32,-4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"10% ABV is very well masked. If I had to guess I would have thought it was around 6%. Sour beers tend to really cover up any alcohol taste.

4.65,3.3,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a wonderful sour. I tried it first at RR's brewery and it was too much for a first timer. After some Oude Bruins the sour flavor has grown on me and now I can fully appreciate the more potent sours. This is flavorful and complex. The sourness is in perfect equilibrium with the amount of flavor in this beer. All that in a 10% beer that doesn't taste alcoholic at all. A must try, but don't dive into this expensive treat until you've tried a couple other sours, because some context really makes you appreciate it better.","Philousa","Sep 25, 2011"
4.42,-1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Not as sour or flavorful as New Belgium's La Folie, but better than most other sours I've had - especially given that it doesn't cost near as much as La Folie. A complex blend of fruity flavors but maybe a bit too sour as its a tad over powering. Definitely a contender for one of my favorites.","blincoln","Sep 25, 2011"

4.59,2,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark ruby red color w/ a sliver of a head on it. It looks very similar to a glass of wine, or a port. Head is gone within 10 seconds. Small amount of lacing on my glass, not much there at all. Nose is wonderfully complex. Wine, port, berries, funk, sweetness, some yeast all in there. Really opens up as it warms and airs out. Zero alcohol in the nose. I have a feeling I'm really going to like this one. Taste is equally good. Sour, but not overly so. All the smells really come out, and the flavor just blows my taste buds out of the water. cherries and some oak come out as the beer opens up. This is a very tasty Wild Ale, and I can't believe that it's 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is medium, w/ good carbonation and a dry finish. Almost a wine-like dry aftertaste. Overall this is a fantastic beer, and I would buy this one again in a heartbeat. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Sep 17, 2011"
3.98,-11.6,3,5,3.5,4,4,"O: Complex, but I feel my sour taste buds just haven't developed as of yet. Comes off a little bit harsh and is focused more on red wine flavors.

3.79,-15.8,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Dr: It hides its ABV very well, and has some great complex flavours, but does suffer from some minor issues, namely overcarbonation.

Excellent value in California.","kojevergas","Sep 09, 2011"

4.7,4.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"We really enjoyed this ale. The label does not mention that is a sour. But it turned out to be an excellent example of the style. Poured a rich burgundy color with a faint aroma of currants. The sourness is very refreshing. Currents and rich cabernet wine flavor is evident from the start. The flavor grows more complex as the beer warms adding hints of tobacco and figs.","BeerTwins","Sep 04, 2011"
4.42,-1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Another great wild ale from Russian River. I have been lucky enough to have multiple vintages of Consecration.

Will continue to seek this one out.","biglobo8971","Aug 25, 2011"
4.54,0.9,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"12 oz corked and caged bottle. Pours a rich mahogony/ruby color, more or less clear and a small fizzy head forms and crackles away. Aroma is big and wine like, alittle alcohol peaks through, and then theres the funk which all make for a complex nose. In the taste, almost sweet and sour with grape notes, oaky tannins, bitter brett offering a strong sour, and alcohol is almost un-noticed. Malt body is more or less overrun by these strong flavors, but there is a light touch of caramel. Its all about the lovely sour in this beer though, and the delicate flavor of currents. The feel is medium bodied and semi dry. Overall, this is one hell of a beer and I wish I could get it all the time with a reasonable price tag. Mighty fine.","Stinkypuss","Aug 24, 2011"

Aromas are of soured grapes and dark fruit. A hint of oak woodiness can be found, but the buggies really jump out at you. Flavor is mellow and soft, bunches of sour fruits and a mellow caramell, oak, nuttiness to the finish. Warming on the palate, the body doesn't lend itself to the abv, but the finish reveals a little heat once warmed. Very nice brew, mellow, perfect sour level and nice funk to it.","Tripphop","Aug 17, 2011"

4.15,-7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O - This particular beer confused me more than anything. Granted, I've not had much experience with sours to date, but I still imagine this has greater depth than most. I'd say its sourness in taste overpowered some of the darker fruits that the scent gives off, and the final product ends up tasting a bit like a carbonated grapefruit juice without any sweetener. But there is much more here. As it warmed, I felt that the malt I detected in the nose came out a bit more, but the yeastiness was seemingly lost in the sour. I enjoyed this, and have a bottle in the cellar that I look forward to revisiting in a year's time to see how it changed.","Wreckoncile","Aug 09, 2011"
4.47,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O- One of my favorite Russian River brews. The wonderful meritage of sour, tart currants coupled with the complexity of the oak and Cabernet make for a very enjoyable sour experience. Highly recommended!","Sideswipe","Aug 08, 2011"
4.62,2.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Poured a glorious garnet red color with no head at all. No lacing. Smells like a sweet red wine and fruit. Tastes like currants.

Brilliant.","kbnooshay","Aug 06, 2011"

4.52,0.4,3.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"My favorite sour from RR's regular lineup. Big but not brash, simultaneously over-the-top in flavor yet somehow restrained, this is fantastic. I would love to see the funk develop in an older bottle, but alas, I'm an impatient man.","amphion1065","Aug 04, 2011"

4.32,-4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Taste was dried fruit, like cherries and currents. Also got cranberry and red grape. The oak flavor that was so strong in the smell is much more subdued in the taste. There is a slight bit of alcohol warmth, but it is surprisingly not noticeable. Mouthfeel was medium, with a good amount of tingly carbonation and a dry finish. The beer was tart, but not over-puckeringly so.","surlytheduff","Aug 01, 2011"

4.56,1.3,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beer pours a slightly hazy reddish brown, actually reminds me a lot of Coca-Cola especially the way the off white head fizzes up and then dissipates. Aroma is amazing, very complex for any beer. It shares some aromas with Cabernet, which is not surprising given that this beer is aged in Cab barrels. Black currants, red fruit, vanilla, cola and tobacco all come to mind. This beer has a moderate sourness with a fairly dry finish and just a bit of bitterness, I read biegaman's review mentioning that he associated the bitterness with tomato and although I don't get that specifically I will say that it has a certain umami quality that is usually associated with tomatoes, so I could see the comparison. Overall this is a very good offering from one of my favorite breweries and I think it has amazing complexity that is best enjoyed over a long period of time, letting the beer warm a bit and change over and hour or two.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 27, 2011"
4.19,-6.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Consecration is an artistic and innovative experiment... that for all its intricacies and inventiveness ends up tasting a lot like watered-down cab sauvignon. What to make of that? It blurs the lines not only of the beer/wine world, but of the perspectives of the reviewer too - $11 is a lot for a bottle of any beer, but at $23 this would make a reasonably priced bottle of wine. I suppose for me, personally, that makes it more a novelty thing than anything else.","biegaman","Jul 26, 2011"

This was my first time out of the bottle, but even then the youth of the wood and harshness of young currents pillaged the palate. This beer is much better in different batches, but I would say that the taste character is fairly the same. There was a bit more lime/vinegar than I'd like, as the flavors are already acidic and bold enough. By no means a crap or unexciting beer, but I dreamed of acidic remedies after this one.","Cavery","Jul 08, 2011"

4.17,-7.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to GRG1313 for the opportunity. Batch 004X2 served in my CL tulip at 53 degrees. Pours a translucent reddish-brown with a loose, quarter inch off-white head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders leaving a broken, sudsy skim across the surface. No lacing on this one. Fantastic nose - oak, buttery notes, currants and a vinous quality all interwoven into a complex palate of aromas. Taste follows nose - no real surprises here. The flavors are refreshingly tart and the alcohol seems non-existent, despite the 10% abv indicated on the label. Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. The tartness lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks and there is also a slight acidic burn that lingers on the lips between quaffs. Not much more to say - a solid American wild with a great deal of complexity. Another impressive beer from this brewer.","Jwale73","Jun 19, 2011"
4.97,10.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a deep amber red. Off the of the pour the head dissipates almost immediately. The smell is that deep funk that we have all come to love with wild ales. A bit of cherry comes off the nose also. Taste is a mouth puckering sour with loads of tart cherry. The mouthfeel is light and playful, but not flat by any means. Quite and exceptional beer from an exceptional brewery.","deathcharms","Jun 19, 2011"

Flavor starts out sweet almost like a kriek or framboise, with notes of cherry, blackcurrants. Soon turns more tart with the more sour qualities of cherries, red wine, and hints of vinegar coming through. In turn moves to more dried fruit--figs, prunes, dried cherries--soaked in wood-aged wine. Finishes acidic and bitter overall, yet still smooth. Medium body, complex, and very enjoyable.","Rifugium","Jun 10, 2011"

This beer pours a fig like brown with reddish/purple highlights and an off white head that laces the glass. It smells of tart cherries, currants, grape skins, and moderate brett funk. It tastes sour cherries, tree bark, tannins, brett, and light alcohol. It drinks medium in body for a wild with a moderate amount of alcohol, but for 10% it is well hidden.

The acid and alcohol and definitely present in the nose and on the palette. The wine notes dominate, with big fruitiness, leather, tobacco, and a dry tannic oak finish . The currants add a bit of jammy, creamy fruit. The finish is boozy with just a slightly tart and minerally finish. There is a bit of lingering funk that coats your tongue. Very tasty and complex.

It makes you want another sip but since I'm not into this style too much it's almost unwanted. The mouthfeel is similar to a red wine in my opinion.

The sweet fruity characteristics really shine in the flavor as well. Finishes bone dry with a mouthwatering astringency. Bubbly/prickly on the tongue with a rather light body.

First taste is an explosion on the tongue, with a huge sour note exploding outwards midway through the first taste. Wow. That's really all I can say. Must be tasted to be believed.

4.05,-10,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer pours a deep, dark amber color that appears to be clear, and starts with an inch of bubbly head that quickly vanishes down to nothing. The beer smell is an uncanny comparison to a light merlot. The currants are definitely apparent when you raise the glass to your nose. The beer has good carbonation throughout drinking, which helps to keep the heavy flavors light in mouth. The beer is sour on the tip of the tongue, and continues down the tongue, almost puckering at points. Dark fruit flavors abound throughout the mouth, with a slight peppery spice every once in a while. Very tasty, and again, the lightness and crispness provided by the steady carbonation make this a nice, smooth drink. The beer leaves a sour grape-type flavor in the mouth after each sip, but light. The sour aftertaste and the lingering finish pucker the mouth a bit, and it begs for another sip. Delicious!","GarthDanielson","Mar 02, 2011"

Aroma of sour lemon, tart cherries and other dark fruits (must be the currants), oak, vanilla, and some funk. Flavor of tart cherries and currants, sour lemon, tart apples, oak, vanilla, funk, and a hint of vinegar. The ABV is well masked here. Medium-bodied, with a sour mouthfeel and mellow carbonation.

Now here we go! The taste is like I remembered! There's that puckering sour taste I was lookin for! First I get some sweet dark fruit flavors...cherries and plums. Then I get a bit of vinegar flavor followed by delicious sour fruit. There is definitely some funk in the flavor and sweet wine notes. It finishes with amazing oak flavors and tartness. High alcohol is so well hidden that it's crazy. Delicious beer! Mouthfeel is very full and complex. Not syrupy and not as dry as other wild ales and sour beers I've had.

Nose is full of tart fruit, strawberry, raspberry, sour funk, and a hint of dark chocolate. Mild sourness hits the palate at first, with an aftertaste of juicy stone fruit to round things out. Alcohol is nowhere ti be found on this one. Mouthfeel is medium, with the sourness always present, but never overbearing.

Has almost a chocolately, earthy component, not unlike characteristics I get from some belgian quads, definitely interesting. Oak from the barrel aging is also noticable.

Decent malt to it, a bit of an oak touch on the finish as well. MF was medium-light, dry finish, about normal for a sour. I was pretty surprised that this one was 10%, pretty easy drink. Worth a try, but at $17 a bottle, I find it hard to justify when I can get other fruit lambics that are almost just as good (or just as good) for half the price.

Taste is a wonderful blend of oak and sweet fruits with a tart lemon flavor, like a good red wine but with a sour twist. Not anywhere near overly tart or overly sweet, the two are in perfect balance. Subtle grain characteristic in the background. Clean on the palate with no real lingering tastes. Medium carbonation with a light body that has a sweet flavor but a dry and puckering finish.

This beer pours a prune brown with just a hint of a tan head that leaves no lacing. Very little carbonation leaving no bubbles. The aroma is extremely fruity. Tart organic cherry juice with prunes and dates mixed with just a hint of fresh oak. It terms of tartness, most of it seems to coming from a lactic twang. The flavor is much the same. Sour cherry juice dominates the flavor profile. Hints of fig and date come thorough behind the cherry. Oak comes through at the very tail of the profile. Major lactic acid presence. It really feels one dimensional. This is really one of those beers that no matter how dirty your teeth are, they come out feeling clean. The mouthfeel is very full for a sour. Really enjoyable. It really feels full on the palate and finishes extremely dry. Great. I've been lucky enough to have every batch of Consecration.

Hints of sherry vinaigrette blowing off the rapid bubbling head, mild cider notes with wild funky tones that could only be dreamt about if your not drinking this wild ale...horse blanket barnyard doesn't even do it justice. Flavor hits you with a blast of oak with tart fruits galore seems like currants are the victim once again. This beer dares you to keep drinking it make sure your immune system is up to par it hit's with a very acidic tartness that's probably not healthy for your digestive tract unless your consuming this regularly. If Vinnie just all about vomit acid inducing sour ales I've gone too far, but so far his Damnation was the best American brewed Belgian anything that I've tried thus far. I guess it's a question of do you really like sours?

Very nice carbonation, which once settled, lends itself to a smooth sipping pleasure. Alcohol only becomes appearant toward the end.

The taste was just an outright assault of sourness which I enjoyed very much. It was very aggressive while still having a nice balance between the sourness and the acidity. The body was very light, this didn't taste like a 10%abv beer. However, I don't see myself being able to have more than 2 of these since sour beers can tear apart the stomach after having too many.

The flavor is similar, but with more dark fruit, a bit of the cabernet and oak. I give it some minus-points because there is a bile-like quality as well that didn't sit well with me.

The aroma is comprised of yeast, bread, sour apple, and grapes. The flavor is of sour apple, grapes, very subtle alcohol, and citrus. It has a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was the first Wild Ale I had tried back at a tasting and it got me interested in the style. This is a very nice blend of flavors all in one package that makes my taste buds jump for joy after every sip.

Sour vinegar currants strike first on the palate with oaky traits from the barrel, citric lemons, and cherry accents; nice sourness. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation with a sweet sour and dry finish.

It pours a translucent dark garnet topped by a fizzy tan foam that's just too effervescent to exist for very long, kinda like those crazy man-made elements at the end of the periodic table. The laser etch at the base of my glass must be workin', 'cause a perpetually resurgent ring o' fizz is dancing around on the surface. Good times. The nose comprises a good amount of funk, oak, sour grapes, sourdough, prunes, and a touch of a bleu cheese/ranch blend. I can only assume this is one of those wild/sour beers. Am I right? Regardless, the fizzy ring continues to mock the lack of perpetual motion machines out there. The taste is a new kind of melange for me: sour berries, sour apples, rye bread, a slight bit of vinegar, extra sweet toffee in background spurts, some of that blue cheese again, and an underlying current of oak. I'm both pleased and intrigued, leading to a clear desire for more of this. The body appears to be a whispy medium, with a surprisingly slight carbonation and a very smooth, fluid feel.

Given the style of beer and the ABV though, this isn't really a surprise and I'll just focus on the gorgeous color of the beer. The nose was easily appreciable even as I first poured the beer, and it's an awesome mix of horse blanket funk and sweet dark fruits, with just a hint of vinegar skulking around as well. The straight up sourness of the beer is much more prominent in the taste, and especially while the beer is still cold it overpowers the fruits and funk. The balance does improve some as the beer warms. While not overly thick, the beer absolutely coats my mouth, and there's a subtle carbonation highlights the sour flavors. While the beer is plenty tart, it shows up on the front of the palate, so by the end of each sip I'm ready to go for the next one. In addition, there's no heat at all from the beer, impressive at 10%.

Taste is puckering with sourness and alcohol right upfront playing a lead role. Quite drying and tart. Flavors of dark skinned fruit come through as it warms...and warms it does as the alcohol in this beer is there in both warmth and taste. The woodsy flavors mesh favorably with the alcohol. Lingering tartness is left in the mouth that is puckering enough to make you go back in for continuous repetitive sips.

Served in the same glass as Supplication, oversized flute like shape. Comes out with a dark red-brown color which light can get through, not much. The head and cloud are missing but I have never really seen a wild ale with one. The ring around the edge leaves sticky suds behind but no real lacing. The smell is a very nice blend of oak wood and sour lambic. Some dark toasty/caramel malt shines through leaving me with a very interesting beer ahead of me. The taste comes down to sour fruit, oak and brown ale malt hints to me, in a very nice way. The sour and barrel wood notes compliment each other very well and the brown ale malts help back up the sour nicely. Not very complex to me but very cool and creative. Mouthfeel is nice. Moderate body with moderate carbonation and good cream. Not as solid as Supplication but still very nice. A coat of sour oak and malt is left on the tongue. This one gets very sour to me after a while, one glass is the perfect quantity for this great beer. The price was awesome and so wasn't the flavor. RR is great to me so far.","cbutova","Mar 21, 2010"

The color is deep, deep red, almost purple. Aromas of sour fruit, currents mainly, waft from the glass. The taste is just as lively and tangy as the smell, perhaps even more so. There's also a good deal of wine flavors here, in addition to the yeast and fruit elements. Surprisingly drinkable for a ten percent beer. This was the beer that made me fall in love with sours, and every time I drink it the moth puckering sensation reminds me of why I will never look at beer the same way again.

4.52,0.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a snifter as final beer at the Lion's Pride's Belgian Beer Dinner (past of their first Belgian beer Fest). It is a clear beer with a dark plum color. There isn't much head, just a thin off-white ring of foam where the beer touches the glass. The nose is just amazing, with notes of port, sherry and a bit of wild, sour yeast. I can taste sour grapes, both white and red; each has a distinct flavor profile. There is a warm alcohol ester aftertaste. It tastes incredible. There is a medium body with a ton of carbonation. The alcohol vapors feel great. The carbonation and sour flavors leave a little tingle on my tongue after I swallow. As a single glass pour, the beer is very drinkable.

Extremely tart and sour flavors from wine barrel aging with 4 different strains of wild yeast, this beer is very complex and tasty. Where some wild beers taste slightly offensive, this one tastes delicious and has balanced flavors where one particular side doesn't overshadow the other flavors, oak perhaps being the strongest.

First the aging in Cabernet Sauvignon Barrels was obvious. The brett was a perfect compliment to the complexity of this amazing ale.

It's very much a beer, and that's not a close question. It has some vinous qualities, but they complement its Wild Ale qualities rather than compete with them. Russian River really has a special creation with Consecration. I don't know how the other batches stack up, but this one's a dandy. Do yourself a favor and seek it out.","prototypic","Feb 26, 2010"

I cannot believe this is a 10% abv. beer. I could drink this all night. It has a more moderate sourness than Beatification. It's also a darker beer with some crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is very drinkable. It's tasty and not overly ""wild"".","WesWes","Feb 21, 2010"
4.79,6.4,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"D- The flavor is sublime, but Consecration lays a bit heavier on the stomach than Russian River's other sours due to the 10% ABV, the highly acidic sourness, and the richer dark fruit element.

Glass is filled carefully and slowly to the lip, leaving no room for a head and initially served a little too cold. Color is a murky, reddish brown, fairly clear and viscous looking. Strong vinous aroma, balanced and alternating oaky, mild vanilla sweetness with acidic funky dark fruit sourness. Flavor is deep, dark and complex. At colder temps the sour and funky dominates ripe apple, cider-like, tart cherries, berries, Brett-funk, etc. Warming up this becomes much more complex as the sweeter wood flavors reveal themselves and turn this into even more of a sipper. Sharp mouthfeel, fuller bodied and moderate carbonation and lingering finish, relatively dry. I still prefer Supplication to this, but that's not really a bad thing.

Apple cider vinegar mixed with brown sugar and fermented berries. Wow, this tastes amazing. Tons of sour, tart cherries, berries, citric acid and vinegar. This is backed up by a dark sugar, caramely malt base with what seems like a hint of vanilla and a bit of spice. Also has a bit of a red wine like quality. Quite tasty and begging for another sip. Fairly full bodied with a somewhat sticky finish. The sour helps balance off the sweetness in the finish. Also worth mentioning that for being it goes down quite smooth.

Mouthfeel was light, not too fizzy but kept a nice sour tartness on the tongue. Not thin by any means. Drinkablility was pretty good although it was a little rough getting the last bit down.

The aroma was big and sweet with dark fruits, grapes and raisins, currants, sweet dough, alcohol and candied fruit. Like an alcohol infused fruitcake! The flavors were very similar to the aroma but aggressively tart. Highly acidic which was further pronounced by the alcohol punch and I tasted the additions of kirsch as well as some funky, musty wood. The currants truly came through on the finish giving the brew a unique character. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation light/medium.

It was a light gusher too, so watch out. Aromas of tobacco leaf, cherries, berries, currants, earthy with a light funk, red wine, strawberry seeds, hint of cocoa. More earthiness as it warms. The flavour was a combination of fruity and earthy, chocolate covered raisins, berries/currants, a bit tart but very pleasant and non-aggressive in this character. Faint vinegar, light woody oak, green berries. Mild alcohol and warmth in the finish with a lingering berry sweetness. Medium bodied and off-dry, moderate carbonation after the initial loss of aggressive carbonation (it took about 20 minutes to clear from the bottle), a bit of woody astringency.

Sours have grown on me since then, and this is one of the best I've had. The sweet and sour combo almost reminds me of an Oud Bruin in places, but there's enough sourness here that it falls firmly in the right place (and it's also probably not purely funk enough). It's hard for me to give anything that's 10% abv a drinkability that's too high, ergo the score on this one, but it's still pretty amazing. This one seems like one you couldn't age too terribly long without it getting violently carbonated, but I would have liked the pure Brett on this one to be a little more pungent (something that would only come with additional age) - I'd love to try Batch 001 right around now, or to get a current bottle and let it sit for 2, 3 years.

Sweet sour fruit dances in the background. Also nice oak flavors in there as well. Sour fruits dominate the palate. Nice oak flavors in there as well along with the hints with of cabernet.

Maroon label with a black and white line drawing of a spear, I assume the lance of Longinus. My fiance carried this back from Cali for me. Poured at 49° into a snifter. 1/8th inch head settles out instantly to a bubbly ring. The body of the beer is sorta a tawny port color, a reddish-orange in the deepest spots. Sweet oaky nose, some fruit, smells like a fruit forward red wine, not a lot of sour in the nose, maybe just a hint. The body is good, spritzy carbonation, lightly coating, lightly puckering. Flavor comes on strong with cherries, currants, very tart, a nice long rolling tartness, just a faint bit acetic, which I like in small quantities. Lots of oak, woody and dry, not vanilla, perhaps they used non-American barrels. As it's warmed slightly I'm picking up the brett in the nose, a kinda spicy chemical-leather. It's coming forward in the taste too, again, leathery and earthy melding into the sour fruits. The alcohol is really well hidden on this beast. It's an intense beverage to be sure, but well balanced, the tartness is just right, no real sign of the booze, goes down easily all things considered.

Consecration pours a deep ruby red with almost blood orange hues and a healthy pink lacing. A depthful aroma forwarns of tartness but better yet contains a rich dark fruitiness and even...what is it,, Tamarind? Hints of vinegar and dried fruit follow. On the tongue the beer is obviously tart, subtly sour, and surprisingly chewy and full. Ever present is oak rounding out dried fruits lactic notes. At times lighter notes of raspberry almost shine through. A beery like vinegar flavor stings at the palate long after the sip is consumed. If one focuses in on the oak it opens up just slightly enough to reveal vanilla and coconut. Vinous.

With first sip you get some vanilla and oak then quickly comes the tannin based dark fruit sour feel that really embraces the tongue completely. Raisins, figs, blackberries and citrus rind all mark a wonderful tart fruit profile. The bold almost rich tannin feel really rounds out the taste perfectly.

The aroma is sour and acidic with a strong raisin character. There's much more dark fruit than I normally get in a wild ale, I think I smell plums and a touch of alcohol also. I like everything about the aroma except the alcohol, maybe it can't be helped due to the high ABV. The taste is not as sour as feared or hoped, but crisply tart. Lots of raisins, plums, some sweet and tart cherries, very very good. More in-your-face than Belgian wild ales, this has more evident alcohol and bolder flavors overall.

There are notes of red wine, currants (of course), cherries, malt and a wonderful sour like an incredible vinegar. The flavor is similar. The sour bites nicely. There's actual malt presence behind all of the fruit and sourness. The fruit flavors are refined and elegant. The whole thing is a wonderful experience. I can't imagine how they could improve on this flavor profile. The sourness blends with the fruit and malt at just the right level.

Flavors of Sour Cherries, oak, funk and some dry hops is in the background. Feels like a lightly carbonated red wine which made every sip one to remember.

This is a differnt style than I would normally drink but it is excellent. Has a great finish and the aftertaste stays with you for days. This is quite a tasty beer.

At first taste this beer has a tart but not necessarily very sour kick to it, then mellowing into deep fruit and a soft funk.

Dry cocoa adds a hint of sweetness, while soft, oaky vanilla lends a perfumy, lightly woody overtone. Traces of bretty funk add an earthy character.

The aroma included strong oak, vinous dark fruits, and lightly sweetened tart currants. Some lightly sour notes. Definately a strong wine character. Nice mix of sweet and sour. The flavor displayed a fairly intense oaky, wine barrel character. Tart currants followed by a mellow acidity. A lingering woody, cherry pit note was left on the tongue. The 10% ABV was undetected. Finished mostly dry, but there was still some unexpected sweetness lingering. Medium-bodied with crisp, aggressive carbonation. Very well done.

Then a truly unique phenomenon begins to unveil itself . . . the beer begins to make crackling sounds just like a bowl of rice krispies! The head holds along with the crackling sounds for a couple of minutes but then quickly vanishes once I start drinking. The appearance and sounds of this beer was quite an amazing experience . . . never felt like a beer was as alive as this one. Beer is a gorgeous dark burgundy color as well. The color especially the crackle make this a 5 for me. Smell of dark fruit, cherries, apples, brett, and a little vinegar. Initial taste is sour and tart but then it is balanced out quickly by some malts. Beer is tremendously complex. The finish is long lasting and leaves you longing for more with the cabernet sauvignon grapes lingering . ..very nice. Moutfeel is tantalizing as the beer dances across your tongue and feels as alive as it did when it was first poured. I really enjoyed this beer but could probably handle no more than 2. A lot of hype with this beer and I'll say, for the most part, it lived up to it IMO. I'm aging a couple of other bottles and I imagine they will improve quite a bit.

Minimal head retention with a small but nice amount of lace. The aromas coming form the beer are very complex, black currants, cherry's and Tobacco every so slightly. Was a mind opening taste for everyone at the tasting and actually for a couple people their first addiction. Taste is a sour that leaves your mouth a bit dry. Flavors of cherry's were dominate for me not others, with black currants and a hint of oak in the back ground. I am not a big fan of sours but this beer did well for being a sour and converted people in the tasting to sour lovers. Mouth feel is like drinking a very dry and tart wine and I wouldn't be surprised if some was used int he brewing. This type of beer is definitely a slow and sip drink, at least for me. It is a very interesting beer and would recomend anyone to give it a try at least once!","BZero007","Mar 17, 2009"

After sipping it for a while, your mouth adjusts to the intensity and if you like sour style beers this will do the trick.

A brown sugar note emerges once my nose acclimates to the acidity of the aroma. Maybe even a little bourbon and light alcohol too. Very complex smell. Flavors of jammy wine, berries, raisins, oak, vinegar, brown sugar, and a bunch more I can't even articulate. Definitely improves as it warms up. Ridiculous complexity all around.

Virtually nothing in terms of lacing, a bit of a disappointment there. Aroma is heavenly; tart fruits, wet tobacco leaves, and rhubarb. Underneath the funk is a touch of chocolate and oak with some dark grapes and fig as well. Taste begins with some leafy greens, dates, and brett. Midway a bit of alcohol comes to the surface with a woody oak flavor and some vinegar. Aftertaste is where the sweetness lingers; bitter cocoa nibs, dark berries, and leather. Just a complex orgasm for the tongue, mmmhmmm. Pretty light and fluffy for a beer at 10% abv, I'm blown away. Lively, puckering carbonation, just a perfect feel in the mouth. Just a wonderful beer.

Chocolate malt lingers beneath, but the feature is the big sourness that's just everywhere. I also get some currants and raspberries in there too.

4.6,2.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Growler from the brewery, I was stoked that my buddy Dane brought this back for me on his trip home from San Francisco, damn it was expensive though, split with my dad, poured into my New Belgium snifter, color was a dark red with some purple tint, minimal bubbly tannish head that went away quickly, no lacing, smell was black currants, raspberries, cherries, brett, oak, mild booze, toffee, sugar, and tart, flavor was great and you could not taste the ten percent at all, starts off with a nice sour bite, soft carbonation allows the grapes and cherry flavor to really come out in the middle, musty earthiness in the finish with more tart, like how this one feels at the end, mellows as it warms but nice sugary fruit work well with the sourness, mouthfeel is full and rounded, thicker body for a sour with a lower level of carbonation, taste lingers very well, easiest drinking ten percent beer out there, feel free to argue if you disagree, could have finished the jug off myself, not heavy on the stomach, somehow refreshing which is incredible for how strong it is, those red wine barrels did wonders to this one, Vinnie does not brew a bad sour and one thing is for sure, I will buying numerous bottles when this stuff is finally released outside of the pub, highly recommended","Floydster","Dec 19, 2008"
4.47,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a root beer color with almost no head (from a growler). The small head that is there quickly dissipates. The heavy aroma of sourness has me sniffing for a tad longer than usual. First sip is a puckering sour with wild yeast notes completely in charge. A wine flavor slips through the bitterness. Even with a somewhat low carbonation, the mouthfeel here is excellent. Truly an amazing beer. WOW!","ATLbeerDog","Dec 14, 2008"
4.5,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a fantastic beer and one of the better sours I've had the opportunity to try. It's superbly well balanced and extraordinarily drinkable for the ABV. Highly recommended.","gford217","Dec 12, 2008"

4.67,3.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"An extremely good beer overall. I haven't reviewed a beer in awhile, but this one warranted a formal review. I didn't find this one quite as good as Beatification (one of my top 3 beers ever), but it's not far behind. The cabernet barrel aging is very well done in that it lends complexity and character to the beer without totally overwhelming all other flavors. It'll be great to see this in bottles eventually.","WeisGuy","Nov 28, 2008"
4.47,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Right up there with all the other Wild Ales Vinnie brews, one of my new favorites. Winner of the fest IMO.","GClarkage","Nov 17, 2008"
4.57,1.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"On tap @ Russian River. Hot damn am I happy to see this on the chalkboard.Clear ruby brown with a small beige head, fading to a thin ring before long, and swrved in a snifter. Big oak and red wine nose up front with the vinegar and sour apple notes next. Buttery brett and leather peak out stronger as I nose this, and it's hard to pick out the sweet dark fruit that is Salvation in the base beer. Whoo! Flavor is full of tons of sour fruits and berries with a definite dry red wine and oak finish. Sour factor peaked ~ a 6-7,and I wanted to add there was some low earthy bitterness in the backend as well. I'm hard-pressed to find any Salvation in this. Full body with light prickly carbonation--just a little warming in the belly implies the 10%. Really effing good--looks like my Iowa homies are getting one pricey growler!","iowaherkeye","Nov 11, 2008"

4.61,2.4,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"D - It's very strong for a sour, but it works as a sipper. This was so tasty that I got a growler, despite the hefty price tag. Vinnie is still the king when it comes to sours.","sessycuban","Nov 10, 2008"
4.67,3.8,4.5,5,5,4,4,"D: A pretty intense but delicious beer, so couldn't have too many. My favorite sour ale as of yet. Would've got a growler of it but a bit too spendy.","lhaqq","Nov 08, 2008"
4.65,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"I haven't said this yet, but this beer is just fantastic. It has an incredible balance of tartness to rich fruit and light, though structured oak character. The flavor is just so well integrated, everything just seems to work together to carry this beer up to another level of complexity and interest. The oak really does add lots of structure, which goes a long way towards helping the overall balance of this beer. I like that the incredibly rich fruit character never gets overwhelming (back to that balance again). This is an awesome beer, whose enjoyment I am sure was magnified by the setting as well as the prior afternoon session of the GABF.","Gueuzedude","Oct 30, 2008"
