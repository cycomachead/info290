"O- Not my fav style, and not the best of style. I tend to go toward the sweeter flanders reds like Jacobins, but this was pretty good."

"RU-55 is underrated in my opinion. Very complex flavor profile brought on from the oak barrels and bacteria/yeast."

"This actually tastes a bit different than the ""typical"" Jester King offering. It's woody and funky, but it has a really unique sour component. It's somewhere between an American Wild and a Flanders Red, and it works. It's nicely sour, nicely tart, and definitely worth a try."

"Man, I continue to be so disappointed with most of Jester Kings releases. They make styles that I love, but are hardly ever worth the price tag or even close to the better examples of the style. This however hits the mark. Nice character, and depth of flavor with a crisp drying fuller body. Which almost always seems to be missing in some of their other beers. This is expensive, but very enjoyable and well done."

"a sour red that is decidedly not a flemish style, way less lactic acidity here, far more delicate all around really, but still a nice copper malt driven sour with more funk than tartness to it. bronze in color, rather clear looking from the tap, with a short half inch or so of tan bubbles. the nose is a lot like some other jester king beers, with their mix of bacteria. it has some mouth watering sourness, but also an almost saison style yeast element, with the caramel malt and crystal malt providing the base, which is medium bodied and still a little sweet despite all the activity. i get a ton of oak on the flavor, woody and almost tea-like, a very mature beer based on these flavors. the funkiness increases in the finish, and the swallow is dry, but it all comes rushing back. great mouthfeel results, especially with the carbonation as robust as it is. a very well made beer, less interesting than some of the other jester king stuff, but appreciably different from the flanders type reds out there."

"The beer is dark amber with some crimson highlights. the aroma brings a bouquet of funk, oak, sour cherries, yeast. Beautiful flavor. Simply delicious. Lots of funk and cherry flavor with a lovely sour, puckering finish. Medium bodied and highly drinkable. Flanders red characteristics. I definitely recommend this one."

"Overall: Clean, fresh, fruity sour with some light funk to play along but still meaty enough to stay relevant. Good representative."
"Got in a trade with cyde. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, January 2013 bottling. Moderate gusher upon opening. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, raisin, prune, red grape, toast, toffee, light chocolate, clove, oak, hay, straw, red wine vinegar, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, fruity/acidic yeast, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, prune, red grape, toast, toffee, light chocolate, clove, oak, hay, straw, red wine vinegar, musty funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Moderate fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, raisin, prune, red grape, clove, oak, hay, straw, vinegar, light leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately slick/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent sour red ale! All around great complexity and balance of malt, fruity/acidic yeast, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty red color ale with a large beige foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of oak and tart notes with light cherry sour notes also perceptible. Taste is a great mix between some tart and oak notes with light sour cherry and some funky yeast notes also perceptible. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. I really enjoyed the ratio between complexity and drinkability in this beer and I also appreciated the fact that the acidity level was kept at a more than reasonable level."

"By far the most clean, fruit forward take on a Flanders Red that I have tasted. Jester King have really took their time allowing these bacteria to grow at their own pace, avoiding the unpleasant vinegar-esque acetobactor characteristics that a lot of imported sour reds have. This beer is near perfect for its style. I'm highly impressed."

"Overall-A real solid, easy drinking sour. Hits everything you want in a barrel aged sour red, but only hits them lightly."

"Again, I am more than pleasantly surprised by a Jester King offering. I don't know if I like this one as much as Das Wunderkind, but it might not be a fair comparison since they are slightly different styles. Either way, this beer was very enjoyable, and it has only reaffirmed by faith in this small-time Texas brewery. I pulled some similarities to RR Consecration out of RU-55. When you're getting compared to Russian River sours, you know you must be on the right track."
"Poure out as a reddish brown color, the head comes and goes quickly. The retention is very minimal along with a light lacing. The smell is a malty with an interesting sweetness, also caramel or cherry on the nose and lightly toasted. The taste of the beer has a really interesting flavor as well. More malty and dry than sour. There is an earthy grain flavor in the finish with the sourness up front. The mouthfeel of the beer is dry, lightly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew."

"O – I think this beer is awesome. I first had it at Brewvivial 2013 in Charleston and I was hooked. I needed to have some more. I finally found a bottle and got a chance to fully savor the experience. Of course it may not be as complex or layered or mouth-puckering as some world-class Belgian examples, but it comes pretty close. It’s very tasty and very drinkable given the acidity and ABV. Great beer from Jester King."

"Pours brown with a bone white single finger head, laces really well. Smell and taste are pretty similar, nose especially has a lots of oak, some vegetable notes, lots of funk, some dark fruit. Taste is drinkably sour and extremely enjoyable. It's just sweet enough to balance out the tartness. Over all this is the best sour I've ever had, being fairly new to the style. Leaves you mouth watering and waiting for the next sip. Glad I got to try this."
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some fruity, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells much better than it tastes in my opinion."

"A wonderful beer. I’m glad JK stepped into the Flemish styled sour game and did well with this one."
""
""
""
"It is definitely low on the carbonation, but not completely devoid of some bubbles. The flavors are all there though...tart fruitiness, medium amount of sourness and a nice wood presence. It’s still a damn good Flanders style ale, especially once it gets to room temp and the sourness is more pronounced. If it was under $10 a bottle, I would buy some more, carbonation problems be damned. If they fix that issue, I would love to grab a few of these, even at the steep tag of $15."
""
""
"M: Light leading to medium."
""
"Overall this is unlike most Oud Bruin/Flanders Red Ales on the market. It lacks the huge vinegar (The Bruery) and lactic (Cascade) flavors which makes this a much more balanced drinkable sour/wild red ale that I could drink more than one of without wrecking my palate. I would personally prefer a little more so I will be waiting on the remainder of my bottle for several months to see where it goes."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid brew that can stand up to any other beer, not overly sour, would be a good introduction to the style. Would probably get again."
""
""
"Not bad, but not a fav by these guys. Served with a nice tan head that subsides slow to the bottom. Aroma is malt and tart. Flavor's like nose and dry. Body is ok, carbonation good. Finish is like flavor, of relatively short length, and forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It is a great blend of sour/wild/red ale. It's complex and still refreshing, For me, this one was worth the higher price tag. Will seek more."

"The flavor is aggressively sour, but balanced with enough amber malt presence that it doesn't strip away the enamel. Think Russian River's Consecration without the currants. The finish is dry and fruity with vinegar, black cherry, leather, and woodiness from the barrel-aging. Mouthfeel is juicy where it should be, up until the drying finish, and light in carbonation and thickness. All in all, an excellent sour ale that holds up with some of the nation's greats. Very glad to have this beer at my disposal for the foreseeable future!"
