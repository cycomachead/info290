"O: Didn't know what to expect after waiting so long to open this. It is fantastic. Definitely reminds me of consecration. Complex and robust flavors. Really smooth and delicious."
""
"Verdict: A very nice sour beer from Cascade, certainly one of their finer endeavors, plenty of red wine, smooth and mellow in flavor, not too cripplingly sour, but with nice a pucker, very easy to drink, not too heavy despite the darker base and higher ABV. Definitely worthy of the accolades."

"More wine-like than sour, but I like it still. Lactic Pinot."

"i really dont miss the whiskey element from the sang noir, and think the port wine is way more complimentary to the cherries, which are puckery and juicy and enormous in aroma and taste. dark red brew, looks like cloudy red wine, but with a lively head that settles in time. sharply lactic nose, with hints of lemon and virgin oak, new and sweet, which merges with the cherry very well. the wine has a dessert like character for sure in the nose, like a red wine reduction in a pan. concentrated grape and tannic aromatics, very intense, very mouthwatering. the flavor is equally intense, with the oak and grape intensity marrying beautifully with the cherries. way more sour than other cascade beers that i can remember, maybe one of the most sour beers ive ever had. where this whiskey put vanilla and booze into the sang noir, this royal maintains its fruitiness all the way though, and the sourness is rightly more exposed. beautiful balance, wildly complex, titillatingly sour, luxurious in feel, and frankly one of the more unique beers in the world. every bit as good as consecration, although i have never had the two side by side. stupendously good, even a standout by the already lofty cascade standards. wow, just wow."

"Overall: Another great sour from Cascade. Lots of barrel character that works well with the base beer. Worth seeking out."
"Pours a deep brown, ruby red color, hazy with a short-lived bubbly tan head with no lacing.  Big tart nose here, loaded with sour cherries, lemon rind, a bit of funk.  On the palate, the first sip assaults the sour taste buds on the back of ones tongue; it is an intense blast of vinegar!  The flavor does transition nicely though, especially as the beer and my palate opens up and the subtleties come through, again, sour cherries, grape skins, oak, wet wood, and vinous notes. The body is medium and the carbonation keeps it light.  This was a really interesting beer."

"O. First off, the cherry-ness is perfect. Not medicinal, not cloyingly sweet, not overly candylike, but like good ol' Belgian kriek cherries. The beer is fairly one dimensional, but lucky for it (and reeeealy lucky for me), it is an amazing dimension."

"Interesting ale for sure. Kind of reminded me of a flanders red with plums and dates, along with a little lactic acid. Was definitely interesting, though I don’t know if I’d call it a winner. It could have been the supplication I had prior to this skewing my thoughts, so I’ll certainly have to revisit, but I just felt as though it was a little flat and not very complex. Don’t get me wrong, the flavor was decent, but it never evolved as it warmed and stayed somewhat muted."

""

""
""
""

"O- This is a fantastic sour from Cascade that has a great balance between malts and sourness. The barrel complements the beer nicely. A little bit overrated but easily one of the better sours in the US."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent. Very drinkable, and I think on par with Sang Noir and other of the better Cascade BA sours."

"An excellent wild ale from one of the most impressive small-time breweries that I've come across. Lovin' Cascade from all the way out in Pittsburgh, PA. Somebody get in touch with me about a Kriek. I'm sold on these guys."
"Overall a nice beer, easy drinking for how sour it is, held up really nicely in a red wine kind of way, round and tangy!"

"Pours a cloudy reddish dark brown with a layer of off white head that fades to a ring around the pour. Smell is a bit funky with some vinegar and tart wine. The taste is rather sour, I'm getting vinegar and berries. There is some dark funk in the finis. The wine notes are layered nicely. Quite complex."
""
"Overall - Really nice combination of flavors. Better than the sum of its parts for sure. Cascade always seems to have the ability to make a beer that you know is good, but you can't pick out exactly why it's so good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Don’t know how much this has benefited from extended aging in the barrel. Puckeringly sour and lacking dimension. Meh. It doesn’t taste bad, but it no beauty, either."

"pour is dark murky brown with creamy light brown head. Nose is sour, light red grape and malt olive. More bright dark berry behind. Taste is similar, very sour with a malty olive quality, loads or sour red grapes and light oak. Hint of lactic acid and vanilla underneath. Feel is ok, a hint grainy and extremely carbonated. Fairly dry finish and a touch oily."
""
""
""
"Cascade is one of the most underrated makers of Wild Ales in America in my opinion and this beer is no exception. Wasn't a huge fan at the beginning but this kept growing on me and growing on me. Age has mellowed this one out but hasn't robbed it of any complexity or flavor. A very solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Simply put, this was awesome. We had this side-by-side with a fresher 2011 Sang Noir and it completely blew it away. Different aging and fruits, I know, but still."
""
"O: Not top tier. I've probably had better Cascade beers, but certainly very nice. The 5 oz pour I had was enough. Recommended."
"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, subtle funk, dark fruit, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one was tasted in series with the other Cascade brews and it was another continuation of solid brews. I really like how this one took all the aspects people have grown to expect from the style and make it shine. I really wish there would have been a fruit aspect going on. It would have helped out with the tart and sour dominance of this one. Definitely worth seeking out if you have not had it."
""
"O- 6/10 sour factor. Very good sour and the grapes give this beer sour a different and good flavor."
"Overall: I bumped the overall score because the taste is closer to 4.25. This beer is almost like a sour and a wine blended together. Interesting sour!"
"Enjoyed this one a bunch, the grapeyness was very prevalent...could see wine drinkers highly enjoying this. Thanks a bunch crushedvol!"
"Pours a slightly murky honey brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some fruity and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with a woody aftertaste and an acidic finish. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a very crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great beer with some very nice aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nice brew from Cascade again! I thoroughly enjoyed the cocoa malt background in the finish of this wild ale."
"Sour fruit takes center stage; funky yeast accents the fruit. Mild earthy bitterness combines with the bourbon for a pleasant blend of flavors. Delicious. Mild bourbon coats your mouth for minutes after drinking. Distinctly different from Noir, but slightly below. Still fantastic."
"overall: great stuff, worth the price tag"
""
""
"O - Quite good. Not overly sweet and a great sourness to it."
"Overall. Just a fantastic sour. I love this brewery."
"D - Very easy to drink , especially at that ABV!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice red ale. Got a nice complexity and nice balance between the tartness and oak sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've probably tasted better stuff by Cascade, but this is still a fine example of their work. Very pleasurable beer, and one of the best non-kriek cherry beers."
"O: I like this one. Very complex and drinkable. The cherries might not have center stage, but the show is good without them. Reminds me of Lost Abbey's Red Poppy, but sharper in lactic acidity."

"Cheers!"

"Bold flavor and highly enjoyable. A lot of cherry flavor really shines through. Misc. dark fruits, oak, wine, wild yeast. Yeah baby. Acetic without being harsh. Again, complexities abound. A delightful sipper. One of the better brews by Cascade."
"2009 bottle poured into a snifter. Murky dark brown color with a slight reddish tint with a thin tan head that leaves generous lacing on the glass. Carbonation appears to be moderate. This one starts off smelling FUNKY! Really earthy, barnyard smell, tobacco, oak, pepper, a hint of fruit. Initially offensive, but opens up into all kinds of interesting aromas. Starts off with a tart cherry flavor, mouth puckering, definite oak presence with some white pepper, blue cheese, red wine vinegar, followed by a medium dry finish. As it warms up dark fruit and chocolate start to emerge an increase in intensity. A lot of wine presence in this beer. There are so many layers to the flavor and mouthfeel it is hard to wrap your head around, but it is pretty fun to try to figure it out. Very happy I got the chance to get a bottle of this and would love to revisit."
""
"Acetic sourness, grape and oak barrel notes, sour but still plenty drinkable. Crisp and clean, light funkiness that clears up quickly and doesn't linger. Abv is completely hidden. Overall a tasty Flanders Ale, pretty biting and sour for the style, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"o - Overall a really nice sour, one of the better Cascade beers at the tasting in my opinion. Nose is very sour and full or dark fruits. Would love to have it again."
"Overall: tasty, but I feel most of the darker wilds from this brewer tend to be slightly muddled."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic and am going to have to resist the temptation of popping my other one too soon. Very complex flavors throughout and sometimes wickedly sour, which is a trait I like."
""
""
"O: This bad boy is a rough sour, just the way I like it. I am going to see how long I can save this one. I dare say this one may be better then what comes out of RR."
""
"Overall a very good wild ale that was a pleasure to drink."
""
"Very tasty and not as boozy as the ABV would indicate."
""
""
""
"O: Good"
""
"Outstanding, rich and decadent. Bought a bottle, expensive as it was."
""
"Hey these aren't cheap, but I'd order them over and over, as I plan to keep doing. Thought the carbonation was just right. Cascade is sooo underrated."

"The first time I had this I wasn't blown away, but the last two times it's grown on me. Very acidic, this is one of the most drinkable and nuanced ""dark"" American sours on the market. An oenophile's beer."
""
""
"Overall, this is a remarkably interesting and eminently drinkable beer. Definitely one of the best American wild ales that I have sampled to date. Do whatever you can to get your hands on the 2009 (original) vintage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good sour. Very tart. Alcohol is non existent, except when your friend won't drink his half and you have to drink the whole thing."
"Really quite good. This is my favorite from Cascade-- aside from Apricot, of course!"
""
""
"O - Definitely ordering more of these, very good"
""
"D: this brew was just drinking fantastic and have to say it is one of my favorite blends from the cascade brewery. Good job!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty beer. Good amount of sour, very complex, very drinkable. The pinot is very prevalent. Thanks Ryan."

"2009 Vintage brewed with grapes. Pours a muddy brown color with a hint of red. Nice, frothy white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very funky with a TON of red grape aroma. Lots of oak and acidic characteristics as well. Lovely blend of funk, tart, and grape in the nose. Taste is amazing with complex barrel flavors . Tons of delicious oak flavors with cherry and red grape. Very acidic and sour with mouth-puckering finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with very tart finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, Cascade never has disappointed me, and this is definitely the most complex beer I've had from them. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is epic and I could not be happier. This is like a more complex, Marron Acidife which I also loved. The Port and Cabernet Barrels have really influenced this beer well beyond my expectations. The dark caramel malts are such a great canvas for the Brett yeast and the dark vinous Port and Cabernet barrel-aging. I imagine I enjoyed this beer more than I would have the straight Port aging/Cherry version which either preceded or followed this version. Amazing, probably top 3 sours ales I have ever had to date."
"Really nice stuff from Cascade and I'm definitely turning to the funky side."
"Pours a dark reddish brown. Some nice light white head. Smells oaky and tart. Lots of grape on the nose. Tastes sweet and tart. Lots and lots of grapes. The oak is very nice. A bit harsh but definitely solid. Very enjoyable but more sour than I normally enjoy"
"Clear dark brown with reddish highlights, there a dense, light brown head with nice lacing. A gorgeous sour. There's a nice, bright raspberry/fruit vinaigrette with a rich fruit, mild cocoa. Quite New Belgium-like in some ways. Leather and earth are present as well. The palate opens quite sour with vinegar, apple cider and raspberry , very bright and tasty. The mid-palate has oak, leather and tannins, with grapes and grape skin tannins. The tannins linger on the finish. Medium in body, medium-light in body, this is excellent."
"The sour component seemed to come through a bit more in bottle format than on tap, though either way, this is a very fine beer from Cascade."
"Bottle labeled 2009. Pour is what I would expect from an Oud Bruin. Auburn with faint reddish highlights. Pour into a tulip yields a significant and creamy looking beige head. Very nice delivery. Sweet tart aroma is subdued and somewhat woody. Not as complex as Marron Acidife, or the exemplary Haandbaak, but still very nice. Taste is also more subdued than I expected, but still very tart and puckering. Cherries do not make their presence known. Somewhat similar to Consecration. Mouthfeel is very smooth, very creamy. Bottle was gone in no time. Overall, a very nice beer, and a top eschelon competitor for beers in the Flanders style. Price point, like Marron Acidife, is a bit steep, but there is no denying the deliciousness and quality of this beer. A welcom luxury."
"O - This was fantastic. I've had 2 Cascade beers and both have been amazing."
"Drink- I was very excited to see this and try some. It was one I tried to trade for but never could land. I liked the cherry aspect very much. A nice dry sour with some layers and some tart flavors."
"O - This is your sour."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is light to medium bodied with a moderate amount of spritzy carbonation. Overall, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Not my favorite of the night, as it does turn a bit more sour as I'd like to see. I would definitely have it again though."
"A true American Wild. So much flavor, and so much funkiness without being overwhelming. Such a great beer. Cascade once again proves that they know the style and how to make it great. A truly amazing beer."
"O: Rich, complex and tasty, although the flavors sort of blur together making it hard to pick out the details. Quite enjoyable, though."
"Another winner from Cascade. Looking forward to trying it again in a year or so."
"(D)- A solid wild with some nice complexities I enjoyed very much. I continue to look forward to trying more of Cascades' sours."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation and a nice, dry, sour finish. This beer was heaven on earth! One of the better sours I've had recently and one I'm sure I'll never have again. That's OK, there will always be the memories :)"
"Drinkability:This is another great sour from Cascade. Tons of great sour flavor, and an exciting beer."
"Nice carbonation for a beer that's spent so long in barrels, the cherries added even more to the beer it seems. I liked it a lot, and it seemed everyone else did too. The bottle was drained very quickly."
"Overall impression: Yet another excellent offering from the king of American wild ales."
"D: Good I love cascade."
"This beer has a really big body. Surprising for a sour beer, its got some nice carb too. Its acetic sour with a mild lactic note. Funk is moderate. Tastes great. I love him."
"Very interesting beers from this brewery, sometimes very, very good. I applaud the eforts to make the sour beers, and I think they are mostly successful, and I'm mostly happy to support them. That being said, these beers are quite pricey- in the realm of the better Cantillon brews, and as much as I like the Cascade sours, I think they miss the mark set by leaders in the category like Cantillon, Russian River, and the best from Lost Abbey (although they are even more wildly expensive, albeit better). In short, although I enjoyed this beer but think its a bit overrated, especially for the price. I certainly wouldn't go out of your way to trade anything rare for this. On to the beer itself: Pours a somewhat muddy, reddish-brown with a nice head that sticks around. Smells creamy and tart, with big lactic notes followed by fresh, ripe cherries. Quite lovely in the nose. The taste falls just short of the nice aroma. Similar to start, with very tart lactic notes and vibrant cherries, but the finish is somewhat watery and woody. The mouthfeel is alternately tart and oaky and soft and smooth. Nice to try once."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a creamy finish."
"I'm a big fan of wild ales that don't have overpowering sour/funky components. This fits the bill perfectly and I really enjoyed the huge cherry character. Wonderful stuff."
"I guess I was expecting something ""juicier"". Dry, tart, & sour is good combination at times, but all the puckering made my enjoyment of it minimal. Though once it became warmer & fell a bit flat, it was actually somewhat easier to enjoy."
"The beer pours a murky brown color with a tan head. The aroma is dark fruit with some tart cherries. The flavor is oak, tartness and cherries. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Really pleasant. Easy to drink as nothing is in excess here. A well crafted brew that is worthy of praise. Glad to see Cascade coming to philly any day now."
"D: This is incredibly drinkable, as evidenced by the fact that I can drink a full bottle of it myself. And the price (<$20) is a bargain next to Russian River sours. I'm quite happy to have gotten this and will buy more Cascade in the future."
"Poured a semi-dark reddish rust color with a nice white head. Pretty good legs as it goes down. The aroma is relatively strong in the vinegar department and backed up by some very nice oak and cherry notes. The flavor is loaded with cherries, oak, a bit of earth, and plenty of lactic acid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very nice carbonation level and drying mouthfeel. Drinkability is superb--one of the best sours I've had in some time."
"Cascade Sang Royal (Royal Blood) is an outstanding effort from a brewery that probably isn't very widely known outside of the Pacific NW. If you have any interest in beer of this sort, do whatever it takes to locate a bottle. Thanks a million to BKIII for sending me this one... just because he's a helluva generous guy."
"4.5/5/5/4/4.5"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy reddish color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of oak and slightly sweet cherry with a tart finish is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by oak with some nice cherry notes and some clear tart notes and some balanced acidity with a lingering sweetness which may or may not originate form the port barrel used. Body is quite full with great carbonation. I must admit to being totally shock by the quality of beers form this brewery which I will have to keep seeking again in the future."
"Wow, this is a really, really good beer. It's right there with RR Supplication in my book, and it may even surpass it. As this is my first offering from Cascade, I'm really looking forward to picking up some of their other bottles."
"This is the fourth bottle I've opened, and I honestly enjoyed the others a bit more. I highly doubt it's faded with the small amount of age that's on it, but the cherry was somewhat muted in this bottle. It could have been the environment, distractions, or my palate. It also could have just been this bottle. Either way, I think 3 of the 4 bottles warranted a 4.5 so I'll fault the beer just a hair because of this bottle."
"This brewery seems to get better with each new beer, this being by far the best I've had from them so far."
"I just can't get over how sour this one is. It's going to take me along time to finish off this 750. But this is very tasty and unique and I'm very impressed with what I've had from Cascade so far."
"- Overall this is just damn fantastic.... my only slight complaint would be the amount of carbonation... I could use a little less as it would add much more to its drinkability.... for me a sour of this magnitude should drink more like a sparkling wine..."
"Overall, yet another very impressive cascade wild ale. Really a wild ale with some slight flemish overtones. These guys are quickly becoming the under the radar authority on sour beers in the northwest, and rival the other west coast big boys with some of their offerings. It's too bad their stuff is so limited, because it really is a treat. Great beer."
"With beers like this coming out from Cascade, my cravings for Russian River are being subdued."
"D - Easy to drink, but I don't know if I could polish off several glasses of this. Then again, this is the best Cascade offering I've had to date."
"D - This is another 750ml that I'd totally kill by myself. The only thing that gets out of control is the acidity, but otherwise this is amazing stuff."
"Drinkability? It's a big bottle but it's really so tasty and alcohol non obtrusive that it won't be a chore at all to finish. This is a super well made brew that fans of the style should hold in high regard. Thanks again, Kevin!"
"Very nicely done! Tastes like a well done Flanders Red to me..."
"Poured a medium to darker and hazy brownish color with a smaller sized tan head. Aromas of cherries, some funkiness, musty, lighter vinegar, and vanilla. Tastes of woodiness, vanilla, cherries, and some fruitiness. Nice sour finish. I liked this!"
"Overall - Very solid for the style. My favorite from Cascade to date. This was an excellent night cap for me and I really enjoyed it. Spot on for the style and the cherries are really used quite well. Would have to recommend this one for sure."
"Bottle. Pours a reddish brown with a thick, foamy tan head. Aroma is very sour with some lacto and a light fruitiness (apple skins) that could be cherries but is pretty indistinct. Flavor is super super sour, like sucking on a sour lemon with a tart cherry finish. Tart, sour, and lactic. I would like more cherry. Good beer, a bit tart for me though."
"D:Insanely drinkable. No hint of the ABV at all. We drank a few of their sours and they were all fairly big and none of them even gave you a hint as to their strength. Sharing the bottle made the $20 price tag more bearable."
"I like that this has a nice oak backbone to it; that and the tartness really helps to bring a suave balance to the jam-like, rich fruit character. I paired this beer with some fish tacos for the last 25cl and this brings out a peppery spiciness from the oak as well as more of the wood-like flavors, but what it really does is accentuate the rich fruit character that is in this beer. This is a really nice, rich, complex, layered beer that retains its ample drinkability. A fantastic beer, that I am quite happy to have polished a bottle off of."
"Sampled at the brewery with Ron and Curtis, thanks again for the awesome hospitality guys, reviewed from notes, color is a dark ruby red color, one inch bubbly white head, decent retention, some light lacing, aroma consists of cherries, port, vinegar, various malts, lacto, caramel, wet oak, black currants, chardonnay, and sour apples, flavor starts off with cherry and wine-like flavors, more of the same in the middle, finish has a creamy fruit taste but finishes dry with wood, tart and fruity mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderately carbonate, could have drank the whole bottle as the alcohol was masked and it had a light feel, quenching stuff, glad we got to sample this as I was seriously eyeing it the day before at Bailey's, would like to drink again, recommended"
"Overall, many have compared this to Consecration. Having it on tap just the other night, I have to concur. The only difference I noted was that this was a little sweeter and balanced, where as Consecration has a little bit more sourness. I also think the wine qualities came through little bit more in Consecration. Still, this is just as good, if not better."
"D: Pretty damn good. Among the better American wild ales I've had."
"Just a phenomenal brew."
"I bought a bottle of this very cool named beer at Martys today for about twenty dollars. Poured in to a wine glass, color was darker than expected; almost an opaque strawberry brown, with a full finger of white head. Nose is of tart cherries, berries and more vinous fruits. Sourness in the taste is not too overpowering, in fact it is fairly gentle on the palate. As expected, body is light and crisp. Drinkability is very good, though this beer will sneak up on you, so be careful. This is a damn good offering from Cascade. They are definitely gaining momentum with their beers."
"This would make an excellent nightcap, but I'm having this early in the evening. Doesn't make it any worse; this is well-constructed while being exceptionally accessible. There's a little heft in there but it's some wicked good $#!+. Smoke 'em if ya got 'em."
"Pours a dense burgundy with a frothy, light reddish-tan head that slowly dissipates into a medium ring around the glass. Aroma is tart cherry and cranberry and maybe a big of sour funk/yeast. This beer is fairly tart with cherry and cranberry, flight bitterness and is most certainly mouth puckeringly sour. Its a light, crisp effervescent beer and is extremely drinkable and gets a bit hotter as you sip it."
"D) underhyped like all of their beers. Could be my favorite from them. Really looking forward to aging this bad boy. would choose this over Consecration and it's cheaper."
