"2011 vintage.  Pours the color and clarity of honey with no head.  Nose expresses citrus and some oak notes.  Taste expresses oak, citrus and tannins.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an almost still carbonation and a semi-dry finish.  Overall, a top notch beer.  I think I prefer it better fresh; however, this beer has held up quite well."
""
"Bottle pour into a tulip during #bottlecherwednesdays at Beachwood BBQ. Hazy yellow-orange in color with a thin white head that settles quickly. Aroma is sour, tart, oaky, apple cider vinegar, unripe orchard fruit especially apple, and grape skin. Flavor starts with moderate woody tartness followed by apple cider sweetness, there’s some acid on the finish. Light bodied, thin in texture, high carbonation, dry finish."
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied."

"This is a nuanced, sophisticated take on the style. Right here is why Cascade might be my favorite purveyor of wild ales in the states, because they understand a sour is supposed to taste good, it’s not just an arms race to jack the pucker factor into the ionosphere. After having New Glarus’ Wild Peach a few nights ago, I might have had two of the better American wild ales: this is an elite beer, & no doubt about it. Fantastic."

"Cascade makes a number of amazing sour ales, but Vlad the Imp Aler just might be their best. Although this beer is called a ""blonde quad"" by the brewers and classified as an American wild ale on BA, it had many of the characteristics found in the finest Flemish oud bruins. This bottle had three years of age on it and drank like a dream. I am curious to see how it is fresh out of the gate."

"Sweet and sour, salt, bourbon - too busy? Not integrated enough? A cornucopia of flavours, but suffers next to something seamless like Cantillon. 4"

"Overall this is a great beer. Very unique sour beer that I liken to Ghouschip if I had to compare it to anything. I wish I saved this for thanksgiving to eat with some pie!"

"Amazing."

"Oranges, lemon peel, biscuit, oak, canned pineapple. Medium acidity. Taste is more of the preserved tropical fruit, but also barrel influence with brown sugar and vanilla. Alcohol comes through in bitter finish. Overall, great aroma but a tad hot on the palate."
"Intense and complex. Oak, vanilla, lemon, tropical fruit (pineapple and such). Very heavy body."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark golden orange color, mostly clear, with a white head.  The aroma is sour, with faint toffee like traces and plenty of barrel.  The taste is very complex, oaky, tart, sour, trace bourbon, tannins, ghost fruit.  Finishes bittersweet and slightly dry.  Overall, a world class sour."
""
"Strong sour aroma with a very rich and complex flavor.  Barrel aging is exceptionally well done, with enough added flavor to enhance but not overpower the other, mostly fruity, properties.  Moderately tart."

"Pours a dark orange with hints of amber and a slight coppery redness. Fluffy white head, sticky legs and very good lacing. Aroma is burnt orange peel, a clove/pine note and cardimum? Taste is tart orange peel, clove and a touch of cinnamon. Great medium body and highly carbonated. Another amazing beer from Cascade!"

"2011 Project. Cork was probably one of the most difficult ones to remove...EVER. Pours a murky, golden color with a hint of amber. Small-medium, white head that takes a little time to go down. Good-looking brew. Scent is very inviting... green apples, bourbon, citrus fruit, barnyard funk, pepper, grass...damn, this beer is all over the place. Smells complex. Taste is just as complex! Initial sip is lightly tart with sour apple flavor and lemon peel. Sour lemon flavors with a balance of sweet bourbon. Lovely spiciness that I can't put my finger on...other than being delicious. A bit boozy, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is a little cloying, but with a dry finish. Seems perfect with this offering. Drinkability is high...especially for such large ABV. Overall, like the other Cascade brews I've had, this one is very complex and delicious. The sweet booziness is definitely present, but the tart fruit, light acidity, and mellow funk make this to be a world-class beer. Have 1 more bottle, definitely going to buy more."

"O: A very complex beer. I can't wait to try more from Cascade Brewery. A beer worth sharing. Thank you from Chriscrundwell12 for bringing this to try."
"O- Really enjoyed this one. One of the better offerings from cascade IMO. Complex, tasty, great to share with friends."

"O/D-A really interesting Wild brew. I love the barrel influence and find that the funkiness plays very will with the bourbon notes. It's a pricey bottle that isn't easy to come by but one time is well worth it."
""
"this is one heck of a beer, and about the most complex one ive had in the blonde color. thanks to my brother for bringing this one to the table. its a sour blonde quad blended with a couple of other sour golden beers, barrel aged. hazy pale yellow in color with quite a bit of bubbles. the nose does not give its alcohol strength away at all, and it smells of sweet musty wood, souring bacteria, spiced rum, Belgian yeast, honey, and wheat malt. extremely complex layers of flavors, just like aromas, to this west coast gem. it starts quite sweet, with a honey and spice combination, and its immediately followed by a woodiness before sour kicks it into high gear. the combination of sour and sweet in the finish is a little odd, not dry at all, but its certainly enjoyable. the blonde quad is an interesting base beer for something like this, it holds up well to the other ingredients and blends, but also serves to let the barrel shine through in a unique way. some wine vibes on the finish as well. well enough carbonated and rather light in body for what it is. an extremely impressive beer from cascade, who seems to be doing so pretty special stuff. this one will be in my memory for awhile."

"T: A nice hit of sourness right away, then a rich and fruit laced heavy sweetness. Meaty red cherry, spicy tripel notes, white grape, raisin skins and some candi sugar. Finish brings just a trace of bourbon with some red cherry skin tartness and a pleasant dryness from the alcohol. Not my favorite from Cascade, but it's pretty delicious. Really glad I finally got to try this one."

"A very nice brew, not sure it's a $30 brew, but it still is quite nice. Very well done and blended wonderfully. Highly recommended, if you can get it... Thanks for shipping Perry!"
"Very tasty sour... It's quite strong, although I still don't think it tastes like 10%+ ABV. Good balance of fruit, barrel, and overall sourness, and it drinks really well for the relative strength within the style. It would be interesting to try the non-soured ""base"" beer of this (referring to the pale quad), as that sounds intriguing. Another great brew from Cascade... bravo!"
""
""
"5's should be rare, but I love the 'appearance', the way it sticks to the sides of the glass with its white billow-y-ness. it doesn't 'lace', but leaves thick remaining white bubbles. the taste is a tad thin from perfect and smooth but still awesome. the smell is rather NOT as extra-ordinary as I was expecting, but overall this is class sour straight up. at almost 11%, this is an incredible accomplishment. cant wait to try the others from Cascade..."

"O: This is a great, lightly tart, but not mouth puckering sour brew. Very crisp and refreshing, with no one dominating presence. I'm thinking its some sort of wine barreled golden ale or even Saison, but I can't seem to pinpoint any of it. It's a great balance of tart with a sweetness well incorporated. Incredibly tasty stuff."

"Gushed a bit out of the bottle, but was quickly under control. Poured into a Night Shift mini feku, a darker amber colored liquid, more hazy as it got closer to the bottom of the bottle; very heady, capped with an inch or more of off-white foam, nice retention and lacing. Aroma was sour/tart, apple cider and stone fruits, hints of Belgian yeast and spice, funk. Sourness was quite tame on the palate, taste was otherwise quite complex: apple, cherry, apricot, lemon, grassy funk, peppery yeast, light acetic acid, white wine, wood, leather, and I almost detected a touch of cinnamon bark in there. Medium body, crisp and moderately puckering mouthfeel, very drinkable overall."

"Overall an interesting, complex, bold sour ale that swings for the fences and might have come up just a bit short. There's no denying that it's good. I just don't know that it was quite worth the high price of admission."
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable. I drank the 2009 and 2011 side by side very easily. I would have guessed t was around 6-7%. Great stuff as I've come to expect from Cascade, I'm glad I got to try it and I will definitely be ISO more."

""
""
"Overall: a great beer; I'm glad I've tried it. Is it worth the price? Probably not. But for aficionados of this style, it may be worth your while to give this a shot, or at least split a bottle with a few other like-minded folks."

"The beer pours a hazy amber gold with specks of sediment along the bottom and a constant blanketing of a dense off-white head that laces. It's definitely presents potent notes of bourbon, apricot/ unripened peach, orange zest, red wine, and a touch of ""pure smiles."" It tastes like I'd expect; a wild blonde highlighted by red wine, bourbon, and citrus. It has a elegant mouthfeel presenting as sweet, tart, and slightly vinous, which plays nicely off those big barrel -aged coconut, vanilla, and slight ethanol. It really doesn't dry as much in the finish as I'd expected. This beer was definitely worth trying, although price (+shipping) makes this a hard beer to consider for a repeat purchase."
"I was really looking forward to this beer and feel a little letdown. It is still a good beer, but did come through for me. Some funk would of helped this beer a lot."
"O - This was an amazing beer!!!"
"O - Sweet Belgian with lots of oak and bourbon throughout."
""
""
"Like any Cascade beer, Vlad is layered and complex with a bit of a punch. There is just so much going on here between the base belgian ales, the barrels, yeast and bugs and so on. It's hard to say it isn't good but it's hard to say it's great too - it's just too much. Sweet, boozy, vinous white notes, very trace bourbon, vanilla, pineapple. Interesting - would not buy another $30 bottle of this, but would go after it again on tap"
"M: It's a big medium. The carbonation makes it feel a little lighter than full."
"Not one of the best beers I have ever had but definitely one of the most unique beers I have ever head. Cascade rocks."
""
"O: This beer strikes a nice balance between the malty and estery base beer, the mild acidity, and the tannic bourbon. Very nice."
""
""
""
"Now that they are charging $30 a bottle for this beer, plus shipping, its just not that good to cough up that kind of money. I'll take two bottles of their apricot instead of the one bottle of this that I can get for the same price. Cool beer, enjoyable, but unless you are just rolling in cash, I don't see stocking up on these. To try once? Sure."
""
"O - a very impressive and unusual sour ale. Art in a bottle. A pleasure to drink!"

"Overall. A nice sour with some great belgian qualities. Enjoyed it and looking forward to the vintage bottle at home some day soon."
"Thanks to DaveHack (the effin' man) for opening this one last night. This poured out as a clear looking copper color with a nice white head on top. The retention and lacing were minimal. The smell of the beer is obviously sour but also has this subtle sweetness in there too. I kept picking up elements of either the bourbon or honey on the nose. The taste of the beer is tart but it doesn't melt your face off. There is a nice balance of tart and sweet mixing together on this beer. Really interesting stuff! The mouthfeel was well carbonated and light bodied. Overall it's a great beer, and thats coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of sours. Really quite enjoyable."

"Love Cascade, love Vlad."

"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and somewhat funky with some grain and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a solid flavor but I like the way it smells better."
"Appearance is a copper color with a short white had. Vlad has a nose which contains wood, cloves, grape and a tartness is certainly present. I tip back a small snifter and taste cherry, bourbon and more of that wood. This a a sour that really hits me an alcohol presence. But, I still really enjoy it, it balances out a bit with the other aspects of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, along with a tartness to it, which lingers in the finish. Overall, a tasty sour beer, that is perfect for taking your time with."
""
""

"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue. This drank incredibly well, and the extra time aging really softened the >10% ABV...Probably the best beer I've had from Cascade yet."

"A good sour blonde ale. Fairly simple flavor notes overall, but still quite enjoyable."
"This one has been sitting around much to long, tonight it must be drunk. The cork broke and I had to resort to the corkscrew, the cork was really dry. Pours a deep amber bordering on copper with a small tightly bubbled white head that shows moderate retention. Smells of tart and lactic as soon as I wrangle the stopper out of the bottle. Tart cherries, lemon, oak, vanilla, brown sugar, lots of wonderful aromas waft out of my glass. Taste is tart with a hint of sugary sweetness. Up front I get a hint of brown sugary type sweetness followed by a heaping helping of tartness. Lemons and tart cherries with a hint of acid followed by some vanilla and oak and maybe a hint of ash in the finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart kind of mouthfeel. Wow this is a beautiful beer! Its bigger in body than most American sours, but its base is also a Quad. I really enjoyed this, I wish I had more."
"the pour is a copper transparent color with tight white head. The nose is lightly vegital and medicinal with a strong fruit and barrel component. The flavor is the same with a light bitterness. The body is light and the carbonation is very aggressive."
""
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint. Pours a bright orange amber with a two finger off-white head and lots of lacing. Aroma of sour citrus, slight brett and wood. Tastes sour and acetic with a light brett component. Sour citrus fruits and green apple, some darker fruit. Not as sour as some other wild ales. Not my style. I was able to finish this, but will not revisit. Obviously well made, but there just isn't enough interesting here to overcome the sour/wild aspects."
"a solid sour, cascade really knows what their doing with sour barrel aging and it really shows. i have yet to have anything bad from them. the only thing i couldve hoped for was more of a bourbon barrel character."

"750 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a hazy light copper with a small white head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big oak oak, some light bourbon, vanilla, a lactic sourness, some funk, grape, and a bit of cinnamon. The taste is oak, cinnamon, some funk, light boubon, some vanilla, and a sharp lactic sourness. The finish has some light alcohol as well as a light astringency. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. This beer was quite enjoyable. There are a lot of flavors going on that work well together."
"O - Whiel not as ""epic"" as I hoped, this is a very complex beer that requires some serious time to dissect. In the end I just don't think the parts equal a whole that wows me like I hoped it would."
"This beer smells like a dirty diaper, it is just all kinds of funky. It didn't taste bad, but it just weird drinking something that tasted like a sour leathery funky beer that also smelled like digested food."
"Overall not a huge fan of this one, a bit too chewy and over bearing. I won't seek this out again."
"Overall this is a really great beer; really complex and shows how amazing a single beer can be when you blend 3 separate beers together to form 1 synergistic masterpiece. This is not the sourest or oakiest or anything-est beer I have ever had, but it is just darn freakin' good. Cascade/Raccoon really has this oak aging, sour brewing and blending thing down pat. I look forward to sampling their other blended/barrel-aged sours in the near future."
"Overall, I'm impressed by Cascade. They think outside the box and present beers that others are afraid of attempting, or even thinking up. I love the creativity and uniqueness without being cocky and pretentious. For these reasons, I feel the overall beer is quite exceptional."
"Pours a brilliant golden yellow with a tiny white head. Smells amazingly of peaches and some slight oak. Taste is mind blowing , a great peach taste upfront with some green apple and wine oaky hints. Mouthfeel and carbonation are what I have come to expect from a great sour. Overall one of the best sours I have ever had the chance to try...thanks dyan."
"Overall this is a great beer. I would love to have a bigger cellar to throw a number of these into."
"O: A very solid beer, the ABV is clearly well hidden. Something I'd like to have again to delve deeper."
"O: An exceptional beer, and kind of a confusing, odd blend. One on hand it’s tart, and vinous and yet in the same sip it’s very sweet, and caramely. Lots going on here, super complex. 4"
"O - I liked this beer and I am going to try to get more. ABV is a little big for being a sour, but its delicious regardless."
"What a strange brew. The alcohol is too much here, and the beer stands divided between the funk and tartness of wine barrels and the heat and smoothness of bourbon barrels. A nice, create try though."
"The pour was decent enough with a clear, dark grape juice looking liquid with only the slightest bit of carbonation sticking to the inside of the glass. The aroma is sour, tart notes, hints of a woody or oak like touch with a vanilla touch to it. Small notes of cherry or some light fruit notes. As I take a taste the feel really throuws me off. Nice tart flavors and a really nice well blended profile. much different then anything i have run into before. The bite of tart apples is lightly offset with a touch of vanilla and oak in the finish, nothing too bad at all, Just a nice one to put down, the tartness was not strong enough and the subtle hints of oak, too light to make a difference."
"Vlad the Imp Aler – pours a sour colored grape murky, very murky, no head, little carbonation and bubbly. Bring it to life with a glass swirl. Smell is sweet tart, but not in your face. Pretty well balanced, not over the top, sour in the right places. Mouth is smooth. This is a really solid brew across the board. Very solid mouthfeel with even and perfect carbonation. Solid start to finish"
"O- i dont think i liked this as much as other members of the wild ale family. something about it seemed to lack for me. glad i tried it. this is one i didnt think id have the chance to. maybe its the classic barnyard smells and flavors that are missing from this that make it something i dont love?"
"O - I may enjoy this one the most out of all the Cascades."
"O - Very delicious beer that I would love to have around more often. Very well crafted sour that isn't pretentious but has great flavors and a nice rich body."
"Overall I wasn’t blown away by this beer, but it’s another solid beer from Cascade. Well worth a shot."
"Another beer graciously sent by my East Coast connection, Knifestyles. Thanks Chris! Enjoying this with a plate of Dutch Gouda and crackers. Pours a dull orange color with a large eggshell white head that fell slowly to a nice cap and left some surprisingly nice lacing considering the style. Aroma has a nice citric/acidic punch, followed by some musty basement, bandaid, a bit of hay/herbs, and as touch of sweetness. Taste starts off slightly acidic, tart, with flavors of cherry, grain, lots of apple cider vinegar, some of that bandaid/medicinal-like flavor that I got into the nose, light leather, maybe just a small hint of apricot/peach, mild sweetness, and totally dries out on the semi-sour finish. Not a lot of bourbon from the barrels, but it might be there in light amounts... I have had this one other time, and thought there was more of the lemon/leather/basement flavor associated with Brett, but this go 'round seems to be more on the balanced side with lemon only making a fleeting appearance, and the blonde quad characteristics are coming out much more, which probably gives it that underlying cherry and apple cider flavor. Body is nice, carbonation is good, not too spritzy. Overall, a nice brew. I could definitely go for more citrus/lemon characters from the sourness/Brett, but it's good overall, and and definitely pairs well the Gouda."
"Overall- Loving this beer! Very pleasantly suprised. I love the acidity and fruitiness mixed with the oak. The drinkability for me on this is very great!"
"O - Very good beer, liked it enough to go acquire some more bottles. Not at the top of the line as far as American Wilds go, but an easy drinker that's worth trying."
"O: Very good beer. I enjoyed this very much and plan to open another soon."
"I got this in a trade I think with drez77, thanks man. I was a little worried after the bourbonic plague was so bad but this turned out to be solid. Orange color with a decent head but then it disappears. Nice smell of light citrus, sourness and a hint of barrel. The flavor had a very subtle barrel influence and was sour with hints of bourbon. I liked this but I should have split it with someone."
"Drink- For me the hype was more than the beer. Still SOLID, but with just having Marron on tap I can say I wasnt blown away as I wanted to be, of course I will have this one again."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is lightly acidic and souring. Quite easy drinking with a nice warming quality to it as expected for 10+% abv. A nice salivation factor about this brew makes me want to continue drinking it with ease but it just seemed like it was missing something. Perhaps this one would have developed more in the bottle. As is, it's amazing how wild yeast can alter the blend of base brew's."
"Nice blend."
"4.0 D: Pretty good, though trying to do too much worked against this beer. I don't think bourbon barrels should have anything to do with sours (though sour Abyss wasn't too bad). Anyway, decent taste that gets better as you progress through the bottle."
"D: Not a bad American wild but not cascade's best, either. I wouldn't mind trying this vintage again in a couple years but I don't think I want to trade what it takes to land one of these."
"O: I thought this was a soild sour, just not in the upper eshelon of the style. I thought the bourbon worked better with the darker bourbonic plague. But soild nonetheless. Skal."
"Pours an orangish cedar with a nice cream head. Nose is perfect. Sour and funky yeast, wood, vanilla, bourbon, wine, tart citrus fruits, sweet candy malts and more fresh fruits. Taste reminds me of a fladers bruin. Lots of malts and fruits with a well balanced sourness along with whiskey, vanilla, oak and wine. Full body is very well carbonated and has a dynamic, lasting finish. Really a superb beer."
"The complexity of this beer is fantastic. It's truly takes the sour genre in a unique direction. Very nicely done cascade."
"Drinkability:A very drinkable sour beer."
"D: Easy to drink yet forgettable. Nothing really wows me. Pretty much falls into the middle with many other wilds."
"The palate opens with a rather pronounced sourness, definitely acetic and lactic in nature, and surprisingly huge in strength. It's immediately followed by a prominent, fruity sweetness with honey, citrus, stone fruit (particularly ripe yellow clingstone peaches), white grapes and a little sugar. All of this is probably from the base tripel. I can't really say I taste much of the quad in here, this mostly tastes like a blend of blondes and tripels. In some way, the sweetness does also have a mild Splenda-like component. Very vinous, this does really make me think of a sweeter white wine. The bourbon character isn't particularly noticeable here, all I do get is a little vanilla. Tart with a clean,lactic sourness and moderate tannins on the finish, there's also some sweetness, rather sugary, that lingers. Still, this is ultimately a very fruity and surprisingly sour beer. Medium-light in body with medium-high carbonation,this does feel quite good on the palate, apart from the sweet fruitiness that's present. Alcohol is reasonably well-hidden, though it does make its presence known by the effect it is having on my sobriety. A very good beer, though I have to say the asking price is a little bit too high."
"D - Good drinkability for how high the alcohol is in this wild, nice got a stable balance throughout that's a little more mild than wild. On a side note, it took Sweem about 10 minutes to get the damn cork out."
"I enjoyed this but I think it might get much better as time goes on in the bottle. I have another bottle that I'm going to sit on for awhile. I'd suggest trying this one out if you enjoy sours. Another good from Cascade."
"D: A very good beer that isn't a every day sipper, but a beer for special times. A very smooth beer that needs to be appreciated and not abused. Once you get a bottle, savior it and enjoy."
"A nicely balanced sour. I wouldn't rank it far above the other sours I've had, but there are some very nice flavors here."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some easy carbonation that lets the beer's flavors do the expression without aid or distractions. Some lingering vinegar, sour fruit and booze end the ride and take a victory lap in lieu of slamming on the breaks. This is a nice wild ale and could be more drinkable if the flavor was packed into a less boozy bottle. Still something I would try again."
"(D)- I like this. It is certainly unique which I really appreciate for the style. A richer; sweeter representation with a good sour background. The bourbon barrel aging really adds a different level to its profile. Worth seeking out."
"Taste is really tart and fresh and a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is really lift and crisp. This hong is delicious!"
"Drinkability is good. This is definitely a sipper at 10.6% ABV (ABV on bottle), but quite enjoyable. Bourbonic seems pretty good now, but Vlad could maybe use a little age. Overall, I liked this one a bit more than Bourbonic. The heavy vanilla notes are what made it stand out for me. More sourness would be nice, but maybe that will come with more age. Cool stuff."
"D: Considering this from a traditional American Wild Ale perspective, I'm a little dissapointed in this beer. However, I think you kind of have to take this one for what it is. The Belgian base works wonders with the wine and bourbon barrels and even though its not incredibly tart or fruity, there's very good complexity here. Not your typical offering but definitely worth a try."
"Better than the Burbonic but nothing special"
"Overall a very good complexly flavored ale that is worth seeking out."
"This beer is a freakin' sour fruit bowl. Need to remember to find a bottle for girlfriend!"
"D: An overall awesome beer. I definitely want some more of this."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking, was much better than bourbonic"
"Pours an amber-brown color with a single-finger head that dies down somewhat quickly but leaves a bit of lacing behind and has a nice collar throughout. The nose brings a decent amount of lactic character plus some citrus and a fairly-strong amount of green apple skin. The flavor is sour with a bit of funk as well as some oak and a light amount of acetic acid. Mouthfeel is a bit light with a good sour character. Fair amount of carbonation plus a really nice level of drinkability. Nothing really stands out about this brew, though in the end I simply want more."
"Beer is light in body and moderately carbonated on the palate. Beer is very tart and quite sour. The acetic character makes the palate brighter bringing forward more tannic and oaky characters that may have been lost in the beer otherwise. The lactic is also very forward...overall this was a great great sour. I would definitely have it again."
"d - I thought this was a great beer that smelled absolutely amazing. It had a nice combination of sour fruit and oak, which I thought worked really well together. Would love to get another bottle of this one."
"D: Easy to drink, not overly sour"
"D: This was one of my personal favorites from the tasting. It is unique, and genuinely good (not just sideshow interest at work here). A very creative effort. I can't wait until this is officially released."
"Golden orange appearance with just a bit of smooth head. Sour lacto but doesn't overpower the nose. Some Belgian fruitiness coming through. Tastes of lacto but well balances with fruits and floral flavours on a strong malt backbone. Light and sharp on the tongue making it very drinkable! Easily my favourite sour"
"Overall I just wasn't overly impressed with this beer. No real noteworthy characteristics. Quite average."
"Flavor is awesome. Very, very different from your normal sour. Starts with a very quick sweetness, but taken over by a crisp/sharp tartness that immediately takes over. Then the bourbon hits, and finally finishes with a nice wine dryness! Very complex and delicious. Medium body, high carbonation, kind of boozy. Such a cool and different beer...definitely will be looking to get/trade for a few more bottles!"
"poured a golden orange with pale pineapple yellow highlights with a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. Upfront on the aroma i was able to detect some funkiness from the brett with a little corky character slight vinegar acidic citrusy notes and barrel oak notes. the taste was sweet and sour consisting of citrus, brett, oak, slight vinegar, and pineapple accents to add some fruit dimension. It didi seem to have underlying apple and pear flavor as well. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet but fruity, oaky, bretty funky, acidic, sour and slight dry finish. Drank amazing and was almost sucking the last drops from the bottle."
"Soft, sparkling and sweet-tart. Super drinkable."
"D - I had a couple of pours and really enjoyed this one. I know they are different beers, but I preferred this over Bourbonic."
"Really an enjoyable beer. I've got bottles of Bourbonic Plague and The Vine that I'm really excited about after drinking this offering from Cascade"
"I'm really curious to see what some cellaring will do for this one."
"Overall - I've tried a few beers from Cascade and have yet to be disappointed. Vlad does not disappoint. Flavorful, complex, but not over-the-top puckering"
"Bottle. 2010 version. Bottle opens up with a slight pop. Pours a pretty heady slightly murky orange amber color. The head is a tall 2-3 finger fluffy off white head. Good lace as the head subsides. The aroma to me first and foremost is tart sour cherries. Some minimal funky notes as well. Light mouthfeel. The warming alcohol in the back end is the first thing that I notice. My second sip yields a more fruitful tone up front with that of cherries but not too overly sweet. The carbonation really bites at the tongue ever so slightly more than I expected. Lemon acidic like as well in the back end mixed with the boozy. It's definitely an odd brew the likes I haven't had before. There's is an odd bitterness/funkiness right in the middle that throws me off a little. Some floral Brett notes in the end linger on. Different but not overly amazing."
"Overall, I think it is good, but I am not overly impressed. It is somewhat drinkable, but it does show the abv. I think this one is a bit hyped up."
"Drink ability: Easy to drink and is very pleasant."
"A small head of off yellow foam. Beer pours a strong orange color. cloudy in color. The smell is bourbon and oak intermingling with tart berries and citrus. The taste is complex with spice, citrus, and apple cider. Very nice sipping beer. The mouthfeel is very warming. Low carbonation and a medium body are very welcomed here. The ABV is ridiculously high, but well hidden. Amazingly easier to put back."
"D: Alcohol is well hidden, but the sourness and funk would keep me from having more than one glass in a sitting. Still, sipping one of these over an hour or so is a wonderful experience that I hope to have again soon."
"Poured a nice medium amber color, with a medium bodied ivory head. The bourbon barrel tripel component that was blended into this one was what intrigued me, and I am glad I got to try it (along with the bourbonic plague, which I loved), but this one was way too sour for my palate. Lots of funk, lactic acid, lemonheads, sour cherries and vinegar. For me at least, this one was nearly undrinkable."
"D - the best and most complex sour I've ever had. Russian River should be jealous.  What more can I say?"
"- Overall a great sour, but I think it falls short compared to a few others of theirs... Loving the Bourbonic, Noyeaux, and Sang Noir much better..."
"Tap at the super sweet Cascade Barrel House... It was about time I got my mitts on this infamously hyped beer. Poured clear amber/orange with a white head. The nose was candied, quite sweet with a light yeast funk. The lacto is so clean compared to brett, which definitely is displayed in a lot of the Cascade sours. Some acidity going on, maple sweet sugars, lactic yeast notes, quite sour and tart. Ginger, apples, light fruit. Like a tart, slightly over ripped fruit with a lot of added sweetness."
"Drinkability is damn good considering the ABV. I'll definitely be picking up a few bottles of this when the labels finally get approved. Recommended."
"Rad unlabeled bottle, 09 vintage, courtesy Sam. Dark orange color with an orangish creamy head. Citrusy and grainy aroma, also some bruised apple going on here. Boozy, warming flavor, lots of candied lemon and tart fruit salad notes. Kind of a sour tripel character. A little bit of unwelcome solvent but overall pretty interesting."
"Pours a fairly clear, light orange color, with just a little carbonation creating a faint head. Smell is barnyard funky, kind of bretty, and a faint grape quality. Taste is complex. Tart and sour mixed with a slightly bitter oak wood tannin element. As this warms the alcohol comes on stronger. Really glad to try this. Very enjoyable."
"D: This is a much needed redemption after my taste of Bourbonic Plague. Another good wild ale from the guys up at Cascade."
"Underrated this the first time. Quality sour."
"Minimal amount of head resulted in thin ring around top edge of glass, very little if any lacing. Nose is dry, minimal fruitiness, significant barrel aroma. Taste is tart and light, more tart than sour, some light grape, apricot notes, picked up a bit of vanilla. Dry attentuated mouthfeel, fairly thin. A far different flavor profile from Bourbonic Plaque, not quite as complex a nose and taste, but certainly well in balance and ultra tasty. Really drinkable, though the ABV is a bit more noticeable than the Plaque, this is one subtle and yet sophisticated, drinking experience."
"D - This is shockingly drinkable for the ABV - we plowed through this faster than any of the barleywines that we had beforehand. A fantastic experiment that should be a big hit when it's bottled in larger quantities."
"Citrus fruit dominates the aroma with a hint of the alcohol to come. Nince tart fruit flavor with a hint of the wood and hops. Way too carbonated for my taste, but never would've guessed it was 10.2%! Unbelievable. Nice work, Cascade!"
"A woody sourness hits the tastebuds with a zesty, creme de lemon booze note from the lactic acid. Light phenols balance with tart lemon taffy and oak. Vlad is dry, but not overly acidic or puckeringly sour, a plus for my relatively inexperienced sour palate. A top-tier Wild Ale for sure."
"Amber in color with a slight yeasty haze. No head forms from a gentle pour, just a thin white ring circling the rim of the glass, but there's plenty of visible carbonation. The aroma is bold and complex, ranging from musty wood and damp basement to cherries and plums to white pepper and sweet bourbon. Acetic and lactic acid are present in equal quantities, stinging the nostrils slightly. The taste is equally complex, opening with sour cherries, plums and stonefruit, with a touch of caramel-like bourbon flavor buried beneath the fruit. Lactic and acetic acid are at a moderate level, sharp and biting without overwhelming the subtle complexities of the beer. Carbonation is at a high level, helping to offset the full body. The finish is lightly bitter and dry, leaving flavors of pepper and orange peel lingering on the tongue. This is good stuff, but it becomes a bit overwhelming after a few ounces."
"This is a very fruity beer in a fresh peach kind of way. It has a nice maltiness with lactic sourness livening things up a bit. The alcohol is noticable but that won't slow you down as this brew is quite tasty."
"On the palate this beer shows a nice sweet caramelly backbone. Quite big and fruity, as on the nose, with a decided lean toward peach flavor. Finishes clean and fruity, yet with an earthy dryness beckoning me to take another sip. Medium bodied and round, and very quaffable. Hardly shows its 9.5% abv. Just sour enough."
"Tartness up front with a slightly puckering mouthfeel. Sweet and vinous with some nice estery light fruit, especially apple and grape. The oak presence is subtle but there is a good bit of bourbon heat and warmth in the finish."
"Glad I got to try this one."
"D - Very high for a beer this sour and strong."
"2nd bottle opened by jshufelt at our Cascade tasting on 12/11/2009. Thanks Jonathan! The only thing I'd like to add to my previous review is that the beer is a good deal spicier than I remembered it being. Spices are strong in both aroma and flavor, but a bit more so in aroma."
"Drinkability is dangerously high for 10.3% beer, although mainly because it's so tasty, as you can certainly taste the heat. Factor in the reasonable price and you've got another home run from Cascade."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Nice amber color with a great aroma that hints at the joy to be had. Taste is of dark fruits and is quite sour. The wood aging is tasted in the finish though does not overpower the other flavors. A must try if you like sour beers. I also think the classification as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale is quite misleading."
"D - Very nice sipper beer. Easy to drink and pretty enjoyable"
"D: Review notes from 12/31/08. I had no idea what to expect when I ordered. In all honesty, the name sounded cool so without asking any info I just went for it. I am still new when it comes to expanding my horizons and experimenting with new types of beer. However, the first word that came to my mind when I tried this was ""innovation."" Definitely unique and I am very glad I gave it try. Highly recommended."
"D: Tasty and well-made ale from one of the rising stars in Portland's ever-expanding beer scene. A nice one to sit with, swirl a bit, sip occasionally. Not an everyday beer, but a pleasure to have on this day and one I'd happily get every now and then. Recommended!"
"This is a blend of Cascade's blonde and quadrupel that is then barrel aged with wild yeast, consumed 12/5/08, reviewed from notes, color was bright medium orange with several golden highlights, 1/2 inch fizzy white head that disappears quickly, no lacing or retention to note, smell contained grapefruit, citrus, barley, funky yeast, tarty brett, wood, green apple, and sour cherries, taste was very tart at first which I was not complaining about, malts come into effect and the beer gets sweeter after the first few sips, really like the citric acid and sweet fruit combination, funky lemons and orange peel in the finish, mouthfeel is faintly sour, sweet, and dry, body is on the medium side, high level of carbonation, taste sticks around for a good amount of time, could have drank several servings of this, refreshing, not overly sour or sweet, not heavy, just a nice tarty Belgian ale, first beer I tasted from this brewery but just had the four sours arrive in the mail a few days ago, now I cannot wait to open those, certainly recommended"
"Poured a medium amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of funkiness, leathery, citrus, and some dark fruits. Tastes of woodiness, lighter funk, citrus, and dark fruits. Light tart finish. This one really surprised me and it was very nice!"
