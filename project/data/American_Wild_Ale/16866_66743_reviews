"On tap at The Bruery mercy-poured into a taster after I pleaded with the bartender to give me a pass on the ""bring a toy"" rule they were using to restrict access to a few choice beers. Didn’t hurt that I bought a couple of bottles, too. Appearance is pink-orange with a white collar. Aroma is funky, lactic, oaky, citrus, grape skin, raspberries. Taste is tart berries, acidic, and funky to open. Light fruit sweetness and oak bitterness supply some balance. Medium bodied, thin crisp texture, lively carbonation, dry abrupt finish."

"One of my favorite Bruery beers, ever. Balanced and nuanced, with big fresh raspberry notes and a full, dry wit as its base. Wheat character is present but restrained, yeasty esters are on the mild side, but that's pleasant for a beer this big and fruity. Just a joy to drink, and one that I'd be happy to see them enter into regular rotation (and come up with a name for)."
"For the most part, I haven't been impressed with Bruery's sours. This one is different though. Mellow yet complex with great feel. I'm glad to have had the chance to sample this one."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Really good stuff. The fruit addition and barrel aging each add noticeable flavor and complexity to an already solid base beer. Worth seeking out if you can get your hands on it."

""
""
""

"This is a solid enough effort. It is not overly tart and the raspberry notes help to balance out the sour base."

"Overall, just a really well-done beer. It's not as full-on sour as many of Bruery's best offerings, but I think that's to it's benefit. The sourness is just one component of a beer with a lot of depth and interest to offer. I love how the use of fruit and lacto take the subtle bit of tartness that you often find in classic witbiers and turn it slightly on its head, amping up the sourness, but not at the expense of the overall beer. I'd love to get my hands on some more bottles of this."

"O - Good sour that is well balanced with light tartness and some good fruit presence from the raspberries"
""
""
""
"O - The Bruery's Bottleworks XII has a lot going on; layers of complexity continue to unveil in this big beer from it's impressive imperial witbier base through the deep finish. Fruit thrown in the mix while oak aging in red wine barrels makes for a unique sour that crosses all sorts of boundaries for a delicious beer worthy of aging."

"M - Medium bodied or so, definitely on the heavier end of the spectrum for what it is, pretty serious carbonation that works fantastically for this one!"

"Nice cloudy orange beer. Smells like brett right off the bat. It looks like orange juice was poured in. Taste is very refreshing. This is a wild beer. It could be a Berliner, a witbier, a sour ale, it can be whatever it wants to be. Body is a bit thick."

"Taste is moderately sour, puckering and finishes very dry. Some light fuzzy raspberry skins lend a fruity bitterness almost, maybe from the tannin in the seeds or skins. Very quenching and pretty drinkable, though fairly acidic. A good one to share."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very impressed with this beer. Hits my personal taste on just about everything. Nice mild amount of sour, with a little funk and really nice fruited flavors. Berries and brett go really well together in my opinion."
"Hazy golden colour, one finger of white head, some lace as well. Smell is funky, raspberry and oak, brett, lemony and fruity, some spice with tart with a lingering lactic acidity as well. Taste is of tart raspberry, oak, sour lemon and mild citrus fruit, barnyardy brett, funky all the way through, drying finish with lingering fruit and oak. Spritzy high carbonation, dry medium body. Exceptional stuff, drinks like its 5%, could see myself drinking a lot of this."

"This may be a controversial statement, but THIS is perhaps the greatest beer the Bruery has ever made, and ever will make (at least for now). Why? The alcohol is just high enough, and it displays only the best aspects this brewery is known for - excellent oak blending; sour, fruit infused notes; sweet, yet not over-the-top maltiness; and, the always caramel forward, thick forward mouth feel their beers are known for. Tasting like this a whole full year after being bottled - why, it's the stuff of wizards. I want a whole case of this. Mind blowing, life changing stuff. Get your hands on a bottle as soon as you can."

"Pour is light golden amber, mostly transparent with a fairly tight white head. No red in the appearance, but there is plenty of raspberry in the nose. Its fleshy but not super bright, there is a hint of barrel and a touch of leathery bret. Taste is little brighter raspberry with a fair bit of lacto. Finish is highly carbonated and muddles the flavor in back a little with a touch of sulfer. Soft creamy body and actually pretty dry."
""
""
""
"T: A big load of lemon and intensely tart raspberry upfront with a great lactic sourness. The wit base comes through nicely here, with a touch of coriander and some wheat. Finishes tart and clean with some ripe raspberry and a touch of wine barrel."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was pretty good, but it really didn't live up to my (fairly high) expectations. Perhaps some time in the cellar will allow more characteristics of a sour beer come through. I expect some of the berries to drop out, but frankly they weren't predominant fairly fresh so I don't expect the beer's flavor to suffer particularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent. So much going on but somehow simple and addictively drinkable. Impressive coup."
""
""

"Overall I think this is on par with other bruery sours and quite a nice addition to their lineup which is quite impressive to say the least."

""
""
""
""
"O - The smell was the only letdown about this beer. Otherwise, it's kind of a big deal."
""
"Pours a cloudy light blonde. Very inviting nose with some hints of berries and lemon. Absolutely delicious. Maybe the best beer I've had from The Bruery, certainly the best sour I've had from them. The witbier base is completely on point with berry flavor that isn't cloying and lemony tartness that is refreshing."
""
""
""
"Taste has some seedy berry flavors with some leathery brett and fruity tartness...but its not really all that sour. The funk leans more feet than earth. Mouthfeel is good, the tiny carbonation and moderate sweetness give it a full and creamy feel. Raspberries are nice, but the rest of the beer is pretty meh."

"A fantastic beer and surprisingly has hints of Fou' Foune."
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to effervescent level of carbonation. It smells awesome and taste is well, just decent. For what it is, it is quite enjoyable but I was hoping for less witbier/sulfur/minerals and more tart fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dense hazy orange, uneven frothy head dissipates quickly to rest in a swirl on the surface. Aroma is apricot, citrus, raspberry vanilla cream, lactic tart funkiness, oak, fruity red wine notes, earthy barnyard. Taste is lactic tart malt notes, witbier origins evident, mild acidity and citrus, soft raspberry notes coming through the middle, grapes and vinous character to finish. Medium body, mellow sourness and acidity lends a lot of drinkability, well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing beer. Pours a muddy copper with a think head, probably the weakest point of this beer. Just uninteresting to look at. Smell is raspberry, pineapple, lemon, and wheat. One of my favorite smelling beers ever. Taste is a lot of lemon tartness, mild honey sweetness and wheat. Lots of bread. Very crisp carbonation and light body. Like a dry lemon / raspberry soda. Terrific!"

"The ABV at 8% is just right to make this a very drinkable, satisfying beer. I can drink this with no problem. A fantastic sour beer, to me, The Bruery's best. Given that it can age up to 2 years, I am getting me some more of this for the cellar."

"Wow, this beer is goldenrod colored. Little head on the pour and only a few spots of lace around. The aroma brings to me sweet accents of lemon and a kiss of raspberry. The flavor, straightforward, yet relaxed, easy to translate, and very tasty! It tastes almost like a raspberry lemonade. There's a small dose of funk and vague spice, but even without those lesser notes, the base flavor would rock anyway. The carbonation level is light, perhaps from aging, though its mouthfeel is still at an acceptable level. Better late than never, and I'm glad I got to taste this creation."

"Overall a great imperial sour wit! I have yet to have a sour from The Bruery that I didn't enjoy and I think this is in the top 3. I could easily drink a bottle or 2 of this"
"D - overall, this is an intense beer. Lot of sourness packed into it, however there are enough other things going on to not only cut into the sourness but add very nice layers of complexity. Very much recommended for those who like red wine barrel aged beers, and especially framboises."
""
""
""
"O: I like, but don't love, this beer. It's definitely a porch-sipper on a hot summer day. But it's just not sour enough for my palate. It tends to be more on the funky/complex side than the sour side. Unfortunately, I find there's almost too much complexity going on. Flavors become muddled and the sum of the parts doesn't transcend each individual component. A good beer - it just doesn't have the sourness and straight-forward flavor profile I was expecting."
""
""
""
"O - I had very high expectations for this beer and it definitely delivered. It's not as acidic as some of the other Bruery beers. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Very good raspberry summer refresher. Great, fresh raspberry character in aroma and flavor. Crisp and refreshing tartness and tingly carbonation. Base beer is pretty basic with the fruit and wine barrel yielding most of the character. Alcohol presence isn't noticeable even at 8%. Mild funkiness. Very nice beer - expected a ruby colored beer with an overwhelming abundance of raspberry. Instead, I got a nicer balance. Tart, a little bit of funk, well balanced and garden fresh raspberry addition and subtle wine barrel influence...what I got was better than I expected...and I had high expectations for this ahead of time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Yet another very unique beer from The Bruery. Here they took an Imperial Witbier, dosed it with their Berliner Weisse culture and threw it in red wine barrels with fresh raspberries. Incredibly, they managed to keep in balance the tart Berliner Weisse cultures and naturally tart raspberries with the normally very delicate Belgian Witbier style. Although its not my favorite sour from the Bruery, this is a very high quality beer and definitely worth tracking down."

"Overall meh, not nearly as great as I was expecting, raspberry is more of the tannic seed/stem and very little fruit, funk is muted too much, wit beer comes out too strong, the wine barrel is pretty nice but might be what's muting the other great flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall: A good sour. I will add, upon letting it warm a bit above the recommended serving temp, the taste profile came across more balanced and vibrant."
"O - Overall I was surprisingly underwhelmed by this beer, can't believe how mediocre this is. veryi unfortunate."
""
""
""
""
"Unique and solid sour. One of the best The Bruery beers out there. The Bruery is getting damn good at sours."
"O- This was a good sour for The Bruery; I have heard that this is the one for sours with The Bruery, it was good not great. When CS is in my backyard, I am critical on sours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Had it before at the Anniversary parties and thought it was better. Don't know if that is because I knew it was vintage or this will actually age well. Hoping for the later."
"O: I'm glad I maxed out my allocations. It is definitely an excellent sour. Hopefully it will become more tart with some more time."

"This was provided by Duffman929- thanks man! Pours a hazy yellow with some floaties present. Not a whole lot in the way of head. The nose starts with some citric funk followed by lemon and wheat. The raspberries work their way through with tart notes and a bit of oak comes through at the end. The taste matches the nose with a light refreshing wheaty tart palate. Reminds me of a beefed up Berliner. I wouldn't call this beer overwhelmingly sour, but it does have a nice dash of tartness. Notes of lemon and raspberry again followed by some hints of wheat at the back. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, the 8% is non existent which works well for this brew. A nice unique brew and worth a try."

"O: Highly drinkable and very good complexity. The oak treatment is really nice, but I’m not entirely sure I can detect the red wine’s influence."
""
"7.9/10"
"O: A fantastic AWA, glad it was still on tap when I got over to BW."
""
""
""
"Overall a surprising, tasty, unique beer. Glad I had another chance to try this one. One of my favorite beers ever."
""
""
"(O)- It is really nice how clean this is despite its level of acidity and showing of oak it has. Its almost weird based on its color, yet is has so many notes of the red wine and raspberry. Very nicely done!"
"Verdict: A wonderful Wild Ale, all of the base elements are so nicely captured and the harmony between them is superb. The flavors are complex, balanced and executed to perfection, a must try for anyone who loves a good sour beer."
""
""
"Pours a pale yellowish orange. It’s quite cloudy. White head of fine foam, fairly small in size. Little lacing. Dissipates after a minute. Aroma has some really nice raspberry flavor combined with oak and vinous flavors. Jammy berry, tart and flavorful. Moderate funk. Nice stuff. Taste has a good deal of oaky bitterness, moderate sourness, mild raspberry. Doesn’t quite live up to the aroma. Some vanilla. Light feel, very mild pucker. Nice sour."
""
""
"This was one of my highlights from the barrel night. This is an exceptional wild ale."
""
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one on the One Year Anniversary of My Accident/Surgery! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a slightly hazy pale golden yellow with a three finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, wheat, fruit, subtle sour, and raspberry. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, fruit, tart, sour, and raspberry. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one had quite a bit of really nice things going on in it. The aroma was a bit more complex than the flavor, however the flavor was quite a bit more pleasant. Everything going on in the flavor here was really nice and when there was one note, another followed close behind that worked in unison to help you get through the sour/tart mashing on your palate. This was a really well put together brew that I’m really quite glad I got the opportunity to try!"
""
""
""
""
"I need more of this stuff right away."
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to dots of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace also form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, wood, and some wine aromas. Taste is much the same but is pretty sour and funky as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great beer with a solid aroma and really nice set of flavors that make it easy to drink."
""
"Overall - Light in body and, to be honest, flavor. Not overly sour. Not overly raspberry-ish. The malts come through as much as the sour components and the fruit. It's still a good beer, but not one that lives up to its rating."
""
"This is just as good, if not better, than I was hoping for!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very cloudy/murky yellowish orange straw color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite funky...more so than I was expecting. Some pleasant peaches with strawberries and raspberries along with wheat scents. Some brett with lemon zesty aromas. Definitely has berliner-like aromas. Taste is just as it smells but with more strawberry flavor than I was expecting. A lot of hay though, with a ton of lemon and some very tart flavor. Not overly sour, but borderline. The lemon really comes through nicely in this beer. Nice acidic finish with more wheat. Mouthfeel is very good for this style. Drinkability is high. Overall...they call this an Imperial Sour Wit. The only other imperial berliner I had was from Lips of Faith, and this one blows that outta the water. Would like to have picked up more from the red wine barrels, but it was a great beer regardless. So glad I FINALLY got my hands on a bottle of this."
"O: Very good, enjoyable and worth the hype"
""
""
""
"overall: worth a go, but hard to call this a wild ale, more ""imperial witbier"" or ""derivative imperial berliner"""
""
""
"O - Fizzy, nice sour and tartness. I am so glad to finally get to try this one. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pretty good sour. This definitely is very loyal to the Berliner Style base but with the added delicious fruit notes of the raspberry."
"Tasty beer. Heavily tart without being sour, plenty of hay-like brett, and tannic fruit. A bit on the tame side for my tastes, more funk please."
""
"O: Great flavor in this one. I thought the raspberries were noticeable but they could have been more prominent. Thanks again, Mike."
""
"Low light carb. Gentle smooth body, light. Puckers strong. Great linger."
""
""
"UPDATE: popped a bottle of the 6/10/13 vintage and drank it in Feb. 2015. Not a huge difference from the fresh version, though there does seem to be more pineapple and barnyardy funkiness in the aroma. The flavor, too, is funkier. And seems to have a little less raspberry. Not better overall; but not worse either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a bad beer by any means, but I wanted a little bit more out of this beer. Not sure where the raspberries were, but I don't think they were in our bottle."

""

"the tasted had more tart character alongside, wine oak, berries, and really funky bretty flavor but with a touch of citrus; very intresting. the brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a oaky, fruity, tannic, bretty, funky, dry and tart finish. it was drinking quite weel and was glad to have tried it."
"Good beer, but not as good as I thought it would be."

"This pours a straw-yellow without a hint of raspberry and a whitish head. The nose is raspberry and musty, horse blanket funk. Smells really interesting and good. There is a strong presence of wheat-funk and sour in this beer, with the sourness being sharp like unflavored sour candy that is reminiscent of beatification. Raspberry, lemon and oak round it all out. This really comes together very well. Soured Imperial Wit beer didn't sound good to me, but it really worked well. Good carbonation with a decent body. Overall, I thought this was a really fantastic beer."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow. Lots of nice white head. Looks pretty solid. Smells funky as shit. Horse blanket. Wow... Crazy. Smells very odd. Tastes sweet. Wheaty. Very funky. Tart. Veery interesting. I really enjoy the beer. Not too sour. Nce, well carbonated. Overall top notch"
"Overall: Maybe this was a victim of following an incredible beer, but I was not really impressed with this beer at all."
"Thanks to Dr J for sharing this treat with me. 750ml bomber, poured a fuzzy yellow color with a tannish head and nice lacing. I commented that it smells like something my daughter would like. Aroma was like a mixture between Tang and Squirt. So I am expecting a sour influenced Witbeer. Okay, that’s new. Starts off with doughy grapefruit and apple skins. You can get the influence of the wine barrels and raspberries right up front. Lighter notes of the brett throughout. Well carbed. Somewhat lactic, with orange rinds and kumquats on the finish. This is different, but a pretty nice brew. Thanks Jason."
"A surprisingly excellent beer. I expected this to be good, but didn't expect to come away thinking it was so exceptional - nice balance between acidity and tartness; brightly fruit; and refreshing. I wouldn't say no to another fruited imperial berliner weisse from the Bruery."
"O: Hands-down one of the best tasting beers I've ever had. If the smell was a little better, this beer would be an all-time great if you ask me. Take this with a grain of salt though - this is coming from someone who loves Berliner Weisses, so it's right up my alley."
"O: A good beer, but really not worth the crazy hype. It's certainly a tasty creation."
"O - A great beer worth sharing with friends."
"Overall: I think for the style it is pretty on par, just not my favorite one to drink. I didnt think it was as good as the hype, but maybe if i really enjoyed this style i would think it is amazing..."
"it was really, really, really good. the tartness of the raspberries was the overwhelming note, but there's plenty of belgian yeast and sour goodness that shine through as well. this was acquired due to a friend's overwhelming kindness to share it with the g/f and i, as it's a limited release decently beyond its time, and i'd have near-zero hope of getting it without similarly hyped beers in trade. a high point of my trip to seattle for sure."
"Drink- It was lacking the wow/it factor for me. It was a nice beer but a touch small for the hype. I'm glad I got to try it and have my fair share was just hoping for more."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy hazed yellow straw color with a nice little white head. Good carbonation. The wheat and straw type notes are eveident right off the bat in the nose but you also get some barnyard funk, raspberry, and lemongrass. I am really hoping the taste is like the nose! The flavors in the taste are nice with notes of lemon, wheat, and raspberry. As it warms a bit the barnyard funk flavor moves in and becomes more apparent. I could drink this one all day! There is little to no real alcohol flavors here."
"Overall an awesome beer. Wish I had gotten more of it. Too many beers to try and not enough time. Plus I was pretty toasty by the end of the party ; )"
"A pity it won't cross my path again. Very well carbonated with a frothy white head."
"Overall: I enjoyed this a lot. Complex, refreshing, and damn drinkable. I wasn't expecting much, and I was pleasantly surprised. I probably had 24 ounces of this before the end of the day."
"O - This is certainly an unusual brew. I am not terribly fond of the nose, but found the taste much more palatable; I enjoy most of the aspects at least moderately, the major gripe I have is the taste reminds me of the nose (and associated unpleasantries.)"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but also a bit slick and goes down rather smooth. Moderately carbonated, it's a mild sour with a bit of tartness that pokes at the cheek from the sides of the tongue. Finish is a bit dry, but the raspberries continue on the palate. Overrall, it was incredibly drinkable and pretty refreshing (shouldn't be a surprise for a Witbier). Wish I could have picked out more of the spices, but they seemed to be very much in the background. I'd love to try this again in a few years and see how acidic the raspberries make it."
"Light on the palate, and the sweet fresh raspberries work very nicely with the yeasty notes to create a great beer. Very solid stuff, this is."
"The body is great - it's a bit denser than expected from a ""witbier", but it works. The carbonation is on the high/sparkling end of things, but that's OK. Overall, this beer lived up to the hype. If you're sensitive to sulfur or dirty sour smells, you may not be able to get past that, but bear with it, trust me, it's worth it!"
"Thanks to Adam and Gregg for supplying me with these to share. Bottle poured into Lost Abbey tumbler. Color is a hazy pinkish orange, very reminiscent of grapefruit juice. Small off white pinkish head fades to a collar. Smell is very yeasty, lots of sour lemon lactic acid. Some raspberry, oak, and wheat as well, but very heavy on the berliner weiss yeast. Taste is sour but balanced, kind of like an imperial berliner weiss more then a wit. Sour raspberries and lemon acidity, yeast, wheat, some oak and a tart finish. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation, finishes dry. Incredibly refreshing with some very well hidden alcohol. This is a huge success for bottleworks, one of my favorite anniversary beers for them so far. Very unique, try this one out if you get a chance."
"O: Delicious, crisp and refreshing sour. Highly drinkable, great combination of sourness and tart raspberries. This would be perfect to crack open outside on a hot summer day. Thanks to the guys at Bottleworks and The Bruery for dreaming up and crafting such a great beer."
"Despite an awful aroma, this was very enjoyable. At this point I'd recommend sitting on bottles for a few months in hopes that the sulfur dissipates."
"O: A tasty beer. Its odor is strange, even offensive, but the beer is enjoyable despite that."
"(bottle at Dak's tasting!). I really wanted to try this one and I'm really happy it made an appearance. Pours hazy red grapefruit color. Aroma has some funk and grapefruit/citrusy notes. Taste is sour/tart. Medium bodied with some fizziness on the tongue. A really nice beer."
"Overall, a very good beer that I enjoyed immensely. I just wish I could get more of it!"
"D: Overall pretty enjoyable, drank the whole bottle by my lonesome."
"Overall this beer was very refreshing, and aside from the Sour in the Rye was the highlight of the day for the beers the Bruery was pouring at this tasting. ( the bottle share beers are another matter) Glad I got to try this beer, and from the two, I'm taking a different look at sours now."
"The beer appears hazy and light orange in color. The beer has a thick white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite pleasant, with scents of funk, raspberries, and coriander. I did not enjoy the flavor as much as the aroma, but found the beer favorable nonetheless. Plenty of tartness to be found here, with a healthy dose of raspberries. The body is moderately thin, with a solid carbonation level. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good beer and I would definitely like to have it again sometime."
"D - The 8% is a shocker, as this could be mistook for a ""heavy"" US Berliner Weiss in the 4-5% range. Definitely something I could drink large volumes of, particularly on a hot summer day. In some ways it's a shame this is a Bottleworks Anniversary beer, as it deserves to be a summer seasonal."
"Drinking a bottle of the new batch, thanks to Abraham. The nose is beautiful, bright and fragrant with a wonderful, clean raspberry aroma along with a moderate blend of wheat, lactic sourness, citrus, funk( earth, dust, must) coriander. More coriander and orange peel than I remember the original batch having. The palate has a bright raspberry fruitiness, tart, bright and super clean - no seed character whatsoever.  Pairing really well with the wit beer base and the moderate yogurty lactic sourness, this beer is medium light in body and finishes dry, carbonic and spicy with a touch of funk. A little citrus sourness is present too. Really good. 4.25/4.25/4.25"
"O: Raspberries a bit too strong in taste, nice wit complexities, unique and interesting, best raspberry sour i've had"
"Taste, simply put, every sip was better and more sour than the last. A medley of fruit tastes came about from this one. Maybe peach, strawberry, something to give it the pinkish appearance. Puckering. Probably my favorite soured beer, definitely favorite witbier (although the taste is anything but witbierish)."
"I enjoyed it, it was like a really heavy berleiner with syrup in it in the end. I don't know why it had to be so high in ABV and there seemed to be a connectivity issue with the flavors on the palate. Still enjoyable but I like my sours to be lighter and more effervescent. I think the lactic character of this beer could have bee complemented with some carbonic acid and a thinner body."
"d - Overall this was an interesting beer that I liked. I think some people were mixed on this and got more of the witbier characteristics, but I got a lot of funk in the nose, and a lot of tart fruit in the taste. Would like to try again sometime."
"This is, for lack of a better term, a very fun beer. The pink and cloudy color, explosive texture, and huge tingly sweet and acidic fruit character make for an engaging and pleasing drinking experience."
"Pours a bit lighter than the color of pink grapefruit juice. The nose is really enticing with a mild lactic character along with a great raspberry presence. Really nice fruit all around. Damn good. A bit of mild coriander in there as well; if not that, then some other spice. The flavor is sublimely fruity with a beautiful sourness hitting in the midpalate and carrying through to the finish. A bit of light spicing is there in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel was splendid and did a fantastic job blending the fruit and sourness, and had a really fantastic level of carbonation as well. Overall, a very, very solid beer that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"O: Pleasantly surprised by this beer. The raspberries and Berliner Weiss bugs really have taken control of this and made for an enjoyable beer."
"Finish continues with a light pucker factor and a nice sour character with a sour berry and green apple character and light lacto and brett, all of which just sets up the next taste. The Bruery continues it's roll."
"D - Wow, impressive. So damn good and surpassed the expectations I had for this one. Want more, now!!!"
"O - This is a great beer, would love to have more. Reminds me a little bit of Pinotlambicus. Easy to drink and tasty."
"This is refreshing and incredibly crushable, get this."
"Pours a cloudy peach, white head. Smells of wheat and peach, some sour aroma, and a bit of milk. Tastes Of sour peach, sour tarts, and bready wheat. Mouthfeel is medium full, carbonation high. Very drinkable, despite my not possessing any of this I would seek it out for sure!"
"Overall: As usual BW has really nailed their newest Anny beer. This is such an easy to drink beer, the 8% is undetectable and the creamy mouthfeel makes it so enjoyable. Wish I could've gotten 3-4 bottles but my 2 should make me happy for now. Excited to see how well this develops."
"D: Excellent. Even at 8% this is highly drinkable. Great flavor, great mouthfeel."
