"Glorious magenta colored sour ale with subtle blueberry accents. World class."

"Fairly sour beer. Blueberry is subtle, though blends nicely. Nice, but I would like more blueberry."

"O:  This beer is fantastic.  It's extremely tart but the fruit is still there in a supporting role.  Probably better fresh but still amazing after some age.  Truly a world class sour and I'm not just saying that because it's hard to get."

"blueberry for sure."

"2013 vintage. Extremely sour, even after a year. Beneath the tartness is a small, but noticeable, hint of blueberry."

"Overall: Pretty similar to other Bruery fruited blonde sours. Nothing mind blowing, but still good stuff. Not a must have, but still worth trying if the opportunity presents itself."
""
""
""
"Another solid ""sour"" from The Bruery. Blueberry lends itself well to they're particular blend of bugs and whatnot. A bit unwieldy thanks to an off balance acetic push, but definitely tasty and worth drinking again and again."

"While this may not be the best fruit sour I've had, it may just be the best blueberry sour I have ever had. This is worth seeking out."

"Overall this one surprised me.  It was quite delicious and easy drinking for a sour."

"O - While I can imagine the presence and overall fruitiness the blueberries add when the beer is fresh, Beauregarde is still a delicious and intriguing beer even after a year. Its got plenty of sour power with acidic and funky yeast but bright and drinkable regardless."
"i have not had a ton of blueberry sours, i can recall evil twin, cascade, and a handful of others, and this is definitely up there with the best of them. a great use of blueberries and a rather sour lambic type brew. the pour is gorgeous, deep dark pink, sort of purple, but way darker than raspberry or cherry beers obviously from the skins of the berries. good inch of white foam too. it smells like lacto first, extremely acidic and oaky, a good indication that the base beer is outstanding, which it is. similar to rueuze really, maybe less complex, but the same sourness is present. the berries dont add a ton to the smell, maybe some generic fruitiness, but its hard to identify them specifically. the taste is a whole different story, the blueberries are right up front and center, ripe and tart, just a little sweet, blueberry preserves and lemon juice carry through the whole flavor. the finish is all acid, i can taste the blonde sour through the fruit. its a similar base for the bruery i think, it seems familiar to me, but the blueberries transform it. they say to drink it fresh, and this bottle is over a year old, but certainly i dont think the fruit has fallen off much, its really buzzing. nice carbonation, no leftover sugar, and just a really well made fruit brew from the bruery, who seems to have these styles on lock."

"O: Sour fans, rejoice. Beauregarde is the real deal. A great summer sipper on the veranda. Oh, Beauregarde, fetch me a sour."
"O. The Bruery has been making outstanding sours for awhile, and this is one of their best yet. I love what they've done here with the blueberry profile...it adds a sweetness and fleshiness with the sour notes that takes this to the next level. This is a world class wild ale, and I can't wait to see what else The Bruery has in store going forward. Beauregarde is as good as it gets."

"750 ml bottle. Pours a cloudy purple with a small light pink head that settles pretty quickly and leaves some light lacing on the glass. Smells tart with a bit of blueberry, some hay, and a hint of cherry. Taste has a bit of initial sweetness and is really tart. Mid palated has some blueberry and a pez-like flavor. The finish is quite tart with a bunch of blueberry and a little cherry. The blueberry lingers for a bit. Medium body. Medium carbonation."

"Pours are clear dark purple with white head that has a pinkish hue. Nice clarity and color. The nose features a great balance between lactobacillus tartness and blueberry flesh. Notes of oak are present as well. The taste is super tart up front and followed by nice bright blueberry notes. This reminds me a bit of sucking on a Warhead candy. The outside is tart and puckering and the inside is like candied fruit. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. This brew is hitting it on all marks for me... terrific balance, huge tartness, and nice fruit presence. Well done Bruery."

"The beer pours a dull maroon raspberry color without head, reminiscent of most blueberry sours in appearance. The nose is a distinct blueberry with a touch of vinegar and malt. The taste is an intense washing of blueberries on the palate, some sweetness following, and a lingering tartness. It's mouthfeel is definitely medium bodied, slightly under-carbonated, bone dry, and fruity. This is definitely a delicious sour, comparable to many blueberry sours, bright and fruity, but also slap in the face sour."

"Pours cloudy and purple-tinged amber in color. In strong light, it's brightly magenta. Small off-white head. The head dies away relatively quickly. No big deal, regardless, but particularly not for a sour. The aroma shows off the sourness right away. Lots of acetic and lactic sourness. Lemons and oak. The blueberries come through but get a bit muddled and could definitely be brighter and fruitier. This is a beer to drink sooner rather than later - probably a bit late with this bottle, already. Some vanilla. It's pleasant enough but fairly simple and a touch harsh. The fruit doesn't show up as juicy as I'd like, and there's a sort of bile-ish note to it. More than anything, it doesn't have the funk delicacy of better sours. Taste is similarly a bit too harsh and simple. The acidity is strong and needs to be dialed back so other flavors can shine. Sour blueberries and oak. Finish is a bit gummy as the acidity passes. The vanilla shows up again. Lots of pucker. A bit tough to drink after the first six-ish ounces. Happy to have tried it but it didn't live up to expectations. The base sour just isn't quite my cup of tea."

"Solid and enjoyable, but it's conspicuously another product of the Bruery's well-worn oaked-sour template. Not that it's a bad thing, it's just becoming a bit familiar."

"A wonderful beer. I didn't pull a ton of Blueberries. But it still was an excellent beer again from the Bruery. The nose is almost perfect, The taste is very amazing and sour. You get enough funk and wood flavors coming through. But again not to sour where it is unapproachable. The mouthfeel is there but again if it isn't a stout the mouthfeel does nothing for me."

"Overall - One of the best Bruery sours I've had in a long time."
""
""
""
"O: A little one note-y, with almost no complexity evident on the palate and no evident oak influence. It needs a little funk or oak or other fruit flavors to balance whatâ€™s there."
"Pours a light purple with pinkish edges held up to the light. Little carbonation and barely any lacing. smell is acidic and vinegar with very mild fruit notes. The taste is similar to the taste. The sourness and tartness of the beer are overwhelming for the blueberry flavors. Blueberry takes a back seat but really comes in at the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty dry with light-med body. Overall, a good beer but I was really hoping for more out of this offering."

"O: This was very good, but quite acidic. As much as I enjoyed it, I don't think I could drink more than a glass in one sitting. But I'm looking forward to the couple of other bottles I've got in the cellar. Not a sour for a beginner, but very recommended."

"A solid sour with a unique fruity thing going on. Different from a lot of sours with the blueberry element."

"The palate opens with a wonderful berry flavor and sourness. The brightness and sweetness of the berries is wonderful with the moderately lactic and rather yogurty sourness (closer to buttermilk, actually). The lemony sour notes also appear early up. The mid-palate has a moderate sweetness, surprising given the sourness, that has flavors of jammy berries, a little honey and simple syrup. A touch of spice - cinnamon? - is also present. The finish is a classic American sour beer finish, with a dextrinous sweetness, pronounced lactic sourness, a moderately jammy fruity character and a little vanilla. This is a combination that is especially hard to do well, and is done wonderfully here. There is a touch of dry white wine vinegar, especially in the backend. Tannin character is moderate, with a blend of skin and oak tannins complementing the lactic sourness. Wonderful stuff. Do not age this anymore, it's wonderful as is."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is interesting and enjoyable. Surprisingly, I served this one a little too cold and while allowing it to warm up, it really didnt evolve much. I enjoyed the subtle fruity touch and was impressed it did mot display any phenolics or mild plastic suggestions that are sometimes associated with blueberry usage."

"O-A wonderful sour from The Bruery, one of the more sour sours out there."

"O: This is a solid offering. Like most of the Bruery's sour beers, this one lacks depth but the powerful acidity keeps it enjoyable."
""
"Nothing is over done with this brew, just smooth and even. Highly recommended for a fantastic tart sour."

"Good beer. The blueberries, for me, were most noticeable on the finish and were very pure in flavor and added a nice bit of complexity to this sour ale. The beer reminded me of Oude Tarte in terms of acidity and mouthfeel, but with a bit more lift and freshness. Good beer."

"o - Overall I liked this beer a lot; pretty much what I was expecting and hoping for. Loads of sour blueberries and some light funk throughout, glad I have a few bottles of this one. If you like the Bruery's other sour offering and like blueberries than you'll really like this one."
""

"Wow, what a pretty-lookin beer! Pinkish, purple-red, with a very light-pink head. Scent is packed with funk from the moment I opened the cap. Tart, funky barnyard with some sour fruit skin. Blueberries and plums. Some raspberries as well. A strange nail-polish remover aroma, which is slightly off-putting, but just a tiny bit. Taste is sweet blueberries up front, followed by sour raspberries and tart blueberry skin. Super ripe blueberries with other tart berries. Very berry-forward with a nice lactic sourness. Some nice funk in the flavor, just as the nose hinted. Puckering finish. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, crisp and lip-smacking tart. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this a fantastic sour beer. I definitely picked up on the blueberries, which is very hard to accomplish in sours. Very enjoyable, and glad I have five more bottles."

"Overall awesome!"
"The beer is purple ish blue with a foamy pink head. Violent hissing as the head fizzles away to nil. The aroma brings wild yeast, funk, blueberries. Puckering with a bit of an acetic bite in the finish. Nice blueberry presence, though I could always use more blueberries. Agressive in terms of sourness and tartness. Overall, another solid offering from The Bruery."
"The Bruery continues to keep me digging further into the realm of sours. Not what I'd typically pick up but an interesting change from my typical stounts n' hops. I may not buy another bottle but I'd drink it again without a problem."

"O - Nice refreshing drink, not really complex, but good drink on a hot day."
"Overall: should be what a blueberry sour is with the only complaint being smell - definitely would drink again"
""
""
"M: Light leading to medium. More carbonation would make it feel more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Right away, there's a pretty good hit of lemon/tart raspberry sourness with a little dose of funk behind it. Not a lot of sweetness in here, but towards the finish, I get some tart blueberry and cream notes. Touch of lemon and lactic sourness on a dry finish. Carbonation in here is perfect and really works with the sourness."
""
""
""
"O - Don't get much blueberry as it reminds me of a raspberry beer crossed with the buttery Bruery presence to it. Decent but not that great."

"-carbonation is nicely done with a zesty and sour ending. All though the blueberry smell is subtle, the drinking of this alchemy is were this beer shines. Reminds me of Sans Pagaie with a twist....personally this is a much better crafted brew."

"Pours a murky light red with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of sour, tart, and funky with fruity and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with lots of berry flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is super tasty and easy to drink."
