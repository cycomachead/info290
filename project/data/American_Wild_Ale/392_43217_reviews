"Slight vinegar, some rubber band/band aid phenols.  There was a raspberry seed thing that was not so bad, just did not redeem the beer."
""
"Not quite into the sours yet to appreciate this. I thought the flavors were good, but the tartness just overpowered the beer for me. I'd like to try it on draft to see if it would change my mind."
"O: Overall this is one damn fine beer..  tart, and sour, but with a deepness of flavor that I don't often experience in other sour style beers. I almost wish I got a little more of the oak from this, but still pretty damn close to perfect."
""
""
"O: Awesome beer.  Great combo of tart and fruit sweetness.  4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid wild ale.  Big raspberry finish"
""
""
""
"Low B+"
"O: Delicious enough to justify the price point -- would not be difficult to finish this bottle by myself despite the ABV. This would be a brilliant introduction to sours/wilds for anyone new to the style."

"2014.2 vintage.  i love the color on this one.  pours a hazy magenta with a small and quickly dissipating head.  smell is raspberry and sour.  lots of tart acidity.  tastes less sour than the smell but its still a strong flavor, but the raspberry really shines here.  slighty carbonated and very smooth.  this went down quickly.  nice job weyerbacher."

"Perfect blend of sweetness from the raspberries and tart. Loved this beer."

"Fairly impressed with this one right now. Certainly captures a massive raspberry character and backs it up with hints of funk and lactic sours. Certainly one I would order or buy again."

"the thing about this one is that it has elements of a flemish red, that vinegar character and a real effervescent carbonation. i dont think the fruit is as forward as it could be, but with the lighter side on the malt, i think it shows through well enough. it certainly isnt sweet, and it definitely isnt artificial in any way. super tart and acidic in the nose, citric and even more so from the berries. wheat in the malt, but thats not all. i cannot believe, i mean, i absolutely cannot fathom this being almost 12% abv, it drinks like 7%, with huge carbonation, dryness, and a pleasant fruity thing that makes it feel summery and light. where does it all come from? i have no idea. there is no candy sugar character or anything else, its really cool. fruit and vinegar in the finish, and it tastes a little like salad dressing for a second, but the quality is through the roof, and this is easily the most complex beer i have had from these guys, who definitely seem to be getting better with time. i like the subtle fruit and the subtle alcohol, well done."

"Mouthfeel us nice with a rich creamy carbonation. Excellent American wild ale and use of fruit. Not too sweet or overly tart. Falls just short of the depth and complexity of the finest Belgian wild ales."

"Picked up a bottle of this on the recommendation of both bartenders at Always Ron's in hagerstown. They absolutely nailed it. I gave it a perfect taste, and perfect overall as I could not believe the ABV. Unbelievably drinkable for over 11%. Awesome, hope to buy again despite the cost."

"Riserva 2014; hazy reddish-amber pour with light lacing. Opens up with a wonderfully bright fresh raspberry aroma and flavor fading into a lemon juice and lemon peel overshadowed by both astringent oak tannins and alcohol that is a bit unpleasant. The raspberry is a bit sweet but is not immediately apparent given the acidity. This is one of the most acidic beers I have ever tasted. As a sour beer lover, even my system is shocked. The carbonation is active and prickly. The mouthfeel would be rated higher had the tannins and alcohol not been so harsh. Riserva has some marks of greatness but ultimately it is not very drinkable."

"2014 Riserva. I simply could not enjoy this beer. Flavors were exactly as others described them: Upfront puckering, slightly sour, fruity, then the oak barrel flavors come in, then INTENSE SOURNESS, then it fades into a yogurt after-taste. Separately, I like everything about this beer, but I couldn't handle the oak and sour mixture. Didn't blend well at all for me. Worse still, the sourness was way beyond my threshold. It tasted like I was directly biting into a lemon during the peak. The flavors definitely improved and blended better upon warming, but not enough for me to enjoy it."
""
"2014 version if that makes a difference. Poured a light and cloudy red body (it's not pink but it's not basic red or purple, either) with one-finger offwhite head and left lace along the glass. Aroma is comprised of extremely tart, with a little sweetness, raspberries and there are touches of sour funkiness. Smooth, balanced, and that is key as this could have been a mess, the extremely tart and sour raspberries also have a touch of sweetness, especially in the finish, so you get the best of both worlds and not just a flat, sour mess.."
""
"Overall this is very tasty with a great raspberry sour flavor. May be slightly one dimensional which I feel is an area some of the more extreme sours can sometimes fall into. But certainly worth picking up."

"Mouthfeel is nice- medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This is an awesome beer- I really like it but that's cause I'm really into wild ales. If you like wild ales it's definitely worth the 18 dollar price tag."

""

"Picked up 3 on release day at the brewery. Could do this review in 6 words, funky raspberry mouth puckering sour bomb. Really not much else to say except what I also like about this beer is bang for the buck, $17 but you definitely get your money's worth at this abv. This was a great way to relax after a delicious Saturday night birthday dinner with my girls."

"O - Overall, this is one of the worst things I've ever drank. So pissed...this beer was awesome when it was fresh....it's so horrible now. Why did I not drink this fresh?!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It IS, however, $25 a bottle, and that's definitely a hard sale to make when I can find other excellent options domestically and abroad for far less. Still, I'm impressed how well the fruit flavor has held up (perhaps improved?) over the past year, and I'm curious to see how it would evolve further and find what would replace the fruit notes as soon as they faded off. Absolutely a must-try, and perhaps once again if you're not concerned about the size of your wallet."
""
""
"O - It's not hugely complex, but the beauty is you know what you're getting into."
"The Weyerbacher Riserva!!! I acquired a bottle of the 2012 from a friend via trade... been sittiing on it for a while and finally decided to open it... only beer im having today....The cork pops open pretty decently so i know im in for some nice fizz... the smell is funky with raspberry tannisn and oak funkyness.. ""half digested horse manure smell""... ohh man this is funk...The flav is amazingly full of raspberry kick with nioce funky lactic tones... they dance on tongue as this beer is fizzy...as the beer warms the heat from the 11% peeks out of the corner of the raspberry burst... Superb day after christmas beer... soo glad i kept it to myself...LOL"

"O: No doubt, this is among the tartest beers I've sampled. It's a really nice brute-force sour - it isn't particularly sophisticated or complex, but it brings all the tartness I like, without being moronic. Well okay, it's a bit moronic, and that's exactly why I find it so charming."
""
""

""

"amazing beer. poured into tasting size snifter. appearance is hazy to clear amber. no head but excellent carbonation. fairly standard for this style. smell is all kinds of sour goodness. taste is acidic, tart fruity goodness. mouthfeel is amazing front to back. the fruity sour flavor gives ways to acidic sour dryness on the tongue. overall a very excellent beer worth trying over and over. this would pair well with a piece of fish or nice fruit and nut salad. highly recommend."
""
""
"Taste is spectacular. The mix of sweet ripe raspberries, sour tartness, and barnyard funk play beautifully against each other. Initially the sweet ripe raspberries grace the tongue, followed by a tart zing, and then if held, the barnyard funk comes into play. The finish is raspberry for minutes. The ample carbonation helps carry the tart flavors over the tongue, but isn’t overdone as to cause excessive carbonation. A fantastic beer."

"I really enjoyed this sour. Its not Lou Pepe Framboise by any means, but it definitely brings the sour and raspberry fruit flavour to the table. It's to the point, crisp and enjoyable. Dangerously so considering this is a huge 11.40% bomb."
""
"O: While the alcohol is well hidden in this beer, making it easy to drink for it's strength it is not a beer for people that are not fans of sour beers as it is quite tart. It seems like I got a quite tart batch and it is enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A kick in the teeth, but it remains enjoyable. This might cause some digestive issues if you’re not careful, though."

"O/D-Great beer. Always wanted to try it but I didn't want to shell out the $17ish dollars for it. Now after sampling it I am pretty sure I will be purchasing a bottle."

"Pours a murky dark honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, raspberry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with super sour and tart raspberry flavors on the finish. There is a high amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but super sour and acidic."

"O: This beer is surprisingly drinkable considering its strength because it hides its alcohol very well."

"O: Overall I really like this brew. I'm going to try to see if this brew will benefit with a little age on it too."
"O- For the ABV, this is a very drinkable wild ale. For someone who doesn't normally dig on sours, I really enjoyed this. Can only have 8 ounces at a time though."

"2011 bottle. Little get together with a certain san diego bottle share group. originally had this at a 4.25 but after contemplation and realizing it was 11.4% abv I had to chiggity check myself. The alcohol was hidden too well. I would have guessed 7.75 at the most, maybe 8 if we were getting crazy, but it was a monday night...I digress. It poured a pinkish red the 1st round but got murkier towards the end eventually down until the dregs, which were straight brown and opaque; reaching an extreme funk. The smell was lambic and footy (wild ale for those being PC). The taste matched the smell plus a viscous coating of raspberry puree.. Not super tart but not New Glarus either; A funky raspberry effervescent wild ale/sour This would be very nice as a vertical."

"This is a fantastic Wild Ale. It has tremendous balance, deep flavor, and great balance. The oak-aging is superb as are the raspberries. The lactic, tartness is intense but almost perfect. This is definitely a beer that is worth trying."
"Overall, thought the beer was great and would definitely get again. But next time, I might share with a friend, it is a strong beer."
""
"Overall: A very, very fine beer. Weyebacher has done it again. All of the flavors are complex and complement each other very well. Despite the steep price, I would definitely buy again."
""
"I felt the sourness was a little too overboard and detracted from what is otherwise a really good beer."
""
"O- the reddish pink hue gives it a very inviting appeal. Definately a beer worth aging can only get better with time."
""
""
""
"I loved this beer, I'm going to go out and try to buy some more bottles. I'd love to see how the brett progresses a year from now. Buy this if you see it."
""
""
"O: While this beer may not be in the upper echelon of wild ales, it is quite tasty and incredibly easy to drink for such a high ABV. Count this one as another offering from Weyerbacher that has impressed me."
""
""
""
"2012 vintage Pours deep pink with a small bone white head. Smells like chambord raspberry liquor with a slight bit of funk. Taste is dominated by fresh tasting raspberry with a slight tartness, not super sour with a little bit of the barrel..reminds me a lot of blushing monk. Carbonation is on the higher side with light body. I have no idea why I passed on this bottle so many times..so glad I pulled the trigger and bought one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A tasty but very simple raspberry wild."
""
""
""
"Overall- Way to medicinal and just doesn't work well at all. Pretty disappointed with this one."
""
""
""
""
"Others may rate this much higher if this type of beer is up their alley. Unfortunately, this style was overpowering and just not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent american sour. I can't believe this just sits on shelves in some places. It doesn't get the hype that some of the more popular popular sours get, but it's nearly every bit as good."
""
""
""
""
"Pricey but worth the money. The great balance between fruit and funk is right up my alley, and it isn't at all boozy given the high ABV. Along with Insanity, this is the best I've had from Weyerbacher."
"Overall - Great fruit character but not without its flaws in the sour category. That said I've enjoyed my sizable pour of this."

"Bought a bottle somewhere in Pennsylvania with no label on it because Weyerbacher labels are cheap and fall off. An amazingly beautiful wild ale with some kind of CRAZY funk smell that i'm not sure I enjoy, but is definitely interesting to postulate about. Wonderful sour raspberry flavor and a strong alcohol presence. Overall, a great wild ale, but that smell is something to reckon with. Try it only if you can truly handle wild ales!"
""
""
"Poured a ruby-mahogany color, clear at first, hazier as it got closer to that huge trub layer on the bottom of the bottle. A few stray bubbles formed on the pour, but there was no real head to speak of. Aroma loaded with raspberry and funky grass. Blast of raspberry up front in the taste, very sour, with a saliva-inducing acetic acid sensation, though lacking any pulverizing vinegar flavor, underlying berry and malt sweetness, oak and earth mid- to end-palate, with a slight, subtle grassiness in there that is mostly overwhelmed by the tartness of the raspberries. Kind of hard to believe that this had been mellowing out for two years, because it still packed a mean punch. Contrary to some other reviews of this, I can't really say anything bad about the beer...I thought it was great. Medium body, low carbonation, lacking a bit in crispness, but nonetheless, a great sour beer overall. I guess the ABV at 8-10%, and apparently I was wrong."
""
""
""
""
"Very interesting and delicious. It really grew on me the more time I spent with it. Kinda reminded me of a raspberry kolacki, only sour."
""
""
"This was a disaster. Not sure if it's the age or if this is just a bad beer, but as someone who usually loves extreme sour and puts vinegar on pretty much everything, it's too much for me. A big disappointment considering how much I love Rapture as well."
""

"O: A great sour wild ale. If you can get this vintage, I recommend it. I've heard good things about the other vintages as well, but this wasn't too shabby."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I mean....Weyerbacher did throw a label on this saying it was more tart than ever. The acidity is off the charts. It's not an overly pleasurable experience though, because the beer comes off as very one-dimenstional. A disappointment."
"O: Riserva is a strange and interesting beer; while I prefer most of the other sours I've had to date, it was a good experience to try such a big one, in terms of ABV and body. It's considerably less sour than most other wild ales (or lambics, geuezes, etc.), and unfortunately the metallic flavor put a damper on my enjoyment of it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - A nice smooth, yet tart, burn throughout the entire body. The wild yeast is intense and gripping. The ABV is very well balanced, though. Gets a little metallic after a few drinks."
""
""
""
"Run away."
""
"Great sour overall, awesome."
""
"Unclear orange/pinkish with no head and no lacing. Aroma is mostly of fresh raspberries with acetic notes, oak, brettanomyces and light earthy notes. Taste is slightly sweet with fresh raspberries, moderate tartness, acetic notes, wood, earthy notes and light funk. Alcohol is exceptionally well hidden; it’s drinking like a 5-6% abv raspberry beer. Dry mouthfeel. Almost winey at times. Low to moderate carbonation. Medium body. A really good raspberry Sour Ale. Complex and really enjoyable."
"O: this is one of the sourest sour beers I've had to date, if your in the mood for some really mouth puckering raspberry sour deliciousness, give this bad boy a whirl, I'm still puckering."
"Pours blood orange with a lightly pink thick sheet. Smells of sour raspberries, some oak, graham and lacto. Flavor is sour with a slight sharp sweetness and a nice grain feeling. There are some vitamin flavors as well. I like the flavor of this one. Medium bodied with plenty of carb and an off dry finish. This beer is a surprise for me - I'm not a weyerbacher fan, but this vintage of this beer is good. I've got a ""flat"" 2010 in the cellar still, and hopefully it's nice, but this one was quite enjoyable. 3.5/4/4/3.5/4"
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being on the lower end. Overall it was a pretty solid American Wild. It was very tart and sour with some really nice fruit flavors. I do think it lacks some of the depth and complexity of the Belgian versions, but for an American version it was pretty good overall."
""
""
"OVERALL: I was not disappointed with the elusive Riserva. This is a big intense wild ale that has become highly sought after. The flavors make this offering worthy of such praise. Can stand up to any strong flavored cheese its paired with."
"O: A nice American Wild Ale, glad I was able to grab two bottles of this."
"O: I believe the 2009 might have scored the highest, but they all had their high points. They were such different beers, this had to be one of the most eye opening cellar tastings I've done. I absolutely recommend you buy this, drink it fresh, and age it. 4.5"
""
"originally reviewed: 12-29-2010"
"o - i would DEFINITELY have this beer again. the sourness is huge and it works. would love to try a different vintage, but wouldn't mind revisiting this one again. if you are a fan of sour beers, this is a MUST try. the low carbonation would normally hurt this beer, but the tartness is just that good."
""
"O: I love this beer. Really nice wild ale. Got the farmhouse funkiness, with plenty of fruit and ale. Nice oak background with a long jammy-raspberry finish. Really, REALLY, nice!!!"
""
"Drink- Tasty fruit sour. Just wondeful. The look and feel bring it down just a little bit, but this was delicious and a sleeper for us at our tasting."
""
"Drink-ability: for 11%, I get no booze at all. This bottle will be enjoyed, every drop. Possibly the most enjoyable fruit beer I've ever had, I would guess its peer group would include beers like Blushing Monk and Fort, this being easily better than both."
""
"O: Pleasantly surprised by this, definitely a solid stab at top notch sours. The nice twist of raspberry puree and oak give it some complexity that is welcomed into the style with open arms. As the beer sits and the carbonation settles down a bit, the oak comes out more and helps smooth things over a little. So does the alcohol, though, but that is expected with the abv and general lack of body that comes with the style. Certainly recommended if you enjoy sours, especially with the price point (I got mine for $6.99, which is a steal for a sour of this quality)"
""
""
"Pinkish red body, and a transient white head. Nothing is retained or laced. Nose is quite sour, acetone, funk, a whole bunch of raspberry but a strong accompanying acidity. Very mild oak and sweetness. Sweeter raspberry flavour on the palate, tart, acetone, oak sweetness. An interesting almost Cantillon-esque funk, but generally shittier and not as refined or exquisite. The funkiness or whatever it is just seems to pull this beer apart, really in disconnect with what else is going on here. Medium body with a sharp and abrasive sourness/acidity. Not impressed, this vintage ain't doing to well at this point."
""
""
""
""
"After having so many top notch sours lately, this previous favorite of mine simply cannot compare. Regardless, this is a solid American sour beer."
""
""
""
""
"CHEERS"
"Newest vintage...2011 I believe. Pours a very murky amber color with a slight hue of pinkish red. Medium white head that disappears very quickly. Not the prettiest beer, that's for sure. Scent is..Wow...strong raspberry puree/jam aroma. Lovely, tart berry aroma with some sweet cherry scents as well. Slightly medicinal. Taste is initially tart berries...raspberries and strawberries. Some definite alcohol presence. Some maltiness as well. Slight cherry cough-syrup flavor lingers on the back of the tongue. Not nearly as sour as I was expecting. Slightly warming alcohol burn in the throat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fizzy, and warming. Drinkability is fair. Overall, not the best wild ale...I would say this is more of a fruit beer with the lack of sourness and heavy fruit profile. By no means is this a bad beer, but it is very interesting. Would have loved to see more pucker to this and less booziness/medicinal flavors."
""
""
"O - This is a nice drinkable beer for the style and for the alcohol content. It’s got a nice balance of sweet and sour but still plenty mouth-puckering tartness for those sour-heads out there. A couple of downsides are the slight rubbing alcohol aroma and the very sharp finish. However, if you can get past those, this is a pretty good sour."
"Strawberry-brown with a creamy white head. Big aromas of raspberry, oak, and red wine vinegar. Taste is similarly tart, basically raspberry vinegar, sweet and sour at the same time. Medium-thin mouthfeel, fairly crisp and drying. Not my favorite brew of the day, just not much going on other then raspberry and vinegar."
""
"O: Fantastic beer. The best of the best in the class of sours. Really surprised at how good this one is. Bravo, Weyerbacher, bravo."
""
""
""
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head that fizzled away quickly. There's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like raspberries and raspberry jam, apple cider vinegar, sour fruit, oak, and some funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the sour and earthy flavors are stronger than the sweet ones, not that I'm complaining. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with good carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew and definitely worth trying. $18.99 a bottle."
"M: Very low carbonation, heavy body, and a super sour sour."
""
"Medium to full bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is remarkably smooth. The body is thick but silky, like melted chocolate. The carbonation is fizzy but only seems to be a help."
"Mouthfeel is just right. Very drinkable if you can keep up with the acid."
""
"Overall I was skeptical of this beer after last year's sub-par version but this is definitely the best version yet of this beer. So balanced now, slightly leaning toward the fruity end but with time this will develop into a super American Wild Ale. Granted it will never be up to the quality of lets say a Cantillon, but still super nice for a domestic example."
""
"I'm a huge supporter of Weyerbacher beers. This one tops my list for them. No easy task considering how much I adore Insanity. A must have, and well worth the $17.99 paid per bottle. Excellent wild ale."
""
""
"2010 version, reddish colour and a small head very gorgeous. Funky aroma. Bold tastes, lots of vinegar with the raspberry. Brett made for a balance. Would it mellow if older, or was it not as well put together, I shall find out from 2009 edition. Decent drinkability for sourheads."
""
"Whatever issues they had w/last year's batch seem to be gone (at least in my bottle). Might even try to track down a case this year."
"You will love this beer."
""
"I heard this beer was good, but jesus I didn't think it was THAT good. This beer is NEARLY perfect for what it is, this bottle is going to be gone in 10 minutes!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had high hopes for this wild ale, but it turned out to be a disaster. After having a pretty good experience with the 2011 version a couple months ago, I thought the 2010 version would at least be pretty good. I was wrong, it was a completely different beer. The 2010 version should never have been bottled and distributed, in my opinion. Based on this experience, I will be passing on future Riserva releases."
""
"O - Awesome beer. Alcohol is a bit strong but that is my only complaint. Tart fruits, sharp acidity and a nice sweetness make this an excellent wild ale in my book."

"O: One of the, if not the most sour beers I have had. Like i said earlier, unique. This is the 2010 and there is a gold sticker that reads ""Though its in the nature of a wild ale to be different each year, this year's vintage is exceptionally different, and may not occur again [I really hope it does]. Riserva 2010 is a very sour ale. Tarter than ever, the beer's acidity has inhibited carbonation which is very low. The taste is fantastic! Notes of cider vinegar mingle with an assertive berry palate. Cheers!"" About sums it up. If you love sours like i do, this will be the beer you hope the next sour you land will live up to."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this one has fallen off a bit. Perhaps it was a faulty seal on the bottle, but the lack of carbonation posed some problems for it. It is a sour monster though, so if that's what you seek, then look no further."
"No carbonation whatsoever. Makes this a slick mess. Funkiness is quite gross with the rasberries. Too big and really messy, drainpour."
"O: WOW! This beer has gotta be one of the most sour beers I have ever had the pleasure of having. The way it comes together is just amazing! Guess I'll be clearing the shelves."
"D- low drinkability for the average beer drinker. The sour lover will go crazy for this beer."

"O: Very good. Each flavor, sweet, sour, tart, and funk, stand out well and transitions into the next seamlessly. If Blushing Monk is any better than this I can't wait."
""
"O: I will never buy this again, nor would I consider sipping it again. This is not beer, this is a crummy attempt at a wine."

"Overall – A very acidic raspberry sour. While I enjoyed my first pour of this, there is no way I could have finishes even half of the bottle (when I can kill other sours no problem). The high acidity cuts into the drinkability. Glad I have another one to age and will be sure to have a few people around when I open it."

"O - Not worth the price tag, but this is a very solid raspberry beer. I know the 2009 vintage is tamer than the 2010, which is a good thing because this was a very pleasant and refreshing beer. Perfect for the summer months."
"The raspberries leave a great aftertaste and it makes me want to keep taking gulps to get to that reward at the end. But the pungent, vinegary taste is huge and you should be ready for it before indulging."
"P.S. Wait a second, this was 11.4%??? Holy crap it hides that well."
"Carbonation is almost non existent. Dry and puckering finish."
"Review of 2010 bottle. Pours a curious ruddy brown. Very thin head. The aroma consists of strong cider, vinegar, very tart raspberry, funky yeast, oak-y earthiness. Of course the taste is incredibly sour, but I bet this year of aging has made it much smoother than if I opened this at time of purchase. High acidity is evident. It has an alcoholic apple cider/wine like quality to the mouth feel. What's remarkable is that I was pondering what the ABV might be as its not revealed on the bottle. Now that I know it is 11.4, I am astounded because it is masked extremely well. My first American Wild Ale - I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"O: I'm a fan of sour stuff and I'm not sure it gets more sour than this. But it was a very good kind of sour. I really enjoyed this Weyerbacher offering."
"Overall: Basically a big boy lambic if you will. Enjoyable, but not nearly as drinkable."
"O-I liked this beer but at the same time I think the after taste is a little off. It is sour but lacks definition."
"Honestly one of the best sours I've ever had. Totally blown away and shocked by the low scores. Will have to seek out another bottle. Fantastic."
"O- This is a good sour and I would pick it up again. Alcohol is very well hidden, I would have never guessed this was 11.4% ABV. This beer takes you for a ride with how sour it is!"
"O: A world class sour that I am very pleased to have another of in my stash!"
"Overall, it is a very different type of sour. It's not about flavor, it is about making you pucker. I like this style of beer but I can see it being a major turnoff to those who don't. I have another bottle at home, interested to see how it will age."
"O - Great drinker. Very pleased with this one."
"O: This is one of if not the most sour beer/liquid I've ever put in my mouth. I loved every minute of the masochistic torture. To everyone that cries this is too sour. Please send me every bottle in your possession. I will happily dispose of it for you."
"O- I have to admit that this style isn't really my favorite. I've tried to rate to style though, and not be too harsh on the overall score. Weyerbacher is a great brewery, and this is another example of that."
"Overall: Some sweetness, some tartness, some berries. It's not quite as complex as others on the market, but it's still reasonably tasty."
"Pours a light brownish red. The aroma is all sour raspberry. The taste is extremely sour. Its actually a bit too sour. When all the sour and tart starts to fade the sweet raspberry comes through. This is not an easy drinking beer, but still enjoyable."
"Riserva is a pretty good release from Weyerbacher, but is definitely not a release for everyone. If you’re not into fruity, funky beer, then it’s probably not for you. I’m into funky beer, but not so much fruity. I guess the raspberry presence is what holds it back a little for me. It’s not bad stuff at all though. I wouldn’t be opposed to checking out a newer release. Thanks, Chris."
"Truly puckering sourness. Pure juicy raspberry, dry woody spice, finishes dry after the initial pucker kicks the salivary glands into overdrive. Tannic with bitter raspberry seeds (long since dissolved in the barrel), it finishes nicely, aridly dry and oaky with lingering traces of fruit skins. Rustic and sharply sour, purposefully acetic and potentially an esophagus ripper. Double digit abv is masterfully hidden. Not for guzzling... or for the faint of heart. It comes with a warning sticker FFS..."
"Overall, it's kind of interesting, but really this cost twice what it ought to and was no more interesting than other sour/wild fermented beers. More intense, perhaps, and maybe tarter. I'm probably bitter about the price point."
"O- This beer has qualities of a bright young lambic with not a lot of depth but I could see the funk starting and with age is should grow. Although 11%ABV might slow down those critters."
"This is a medium bodied brew that is lightly carbonated. It could use a bit more fizz but that isn't going to fix all the offputting character this brew has. It boasts some serious sourness and acidity in a heartburn inducing sort of way. The taste is off, quite clashing and at times not enjoyable. However, if you are looking to have your sense of taste wrecked and face puckered in acidity, than you might want to give this brew a try. Or rub your tongue all over some leaking batteries. I don't even know if it is worthwhile keeping one of these around to see how it ages but I'm a glutton for punishment and plan on giving it a try again sometime down the road. I honestly approached this beer on more than one occasion with different batches and an open mind and I have not enjoyed this offering despite really wanting to. While this brew might not be an enjoyable example of an American wild ale for everyone, it certainly will get you buzzed. That abv level is excessive but equally matches the other bold aspects of this brew. The folks at Weyerbacher should keep their head high, they make some remarkable, excellent brews. This one though is troubling."
"O: Definitely unpolished around the edges, and the mouthfeel could definitely use some work, but the flavor is good and the acetone isn't too distracting. Thanks again Josh."
"Pours a reddish gold. Smells of over ripe fruit. Very tart and sour on the nose. Wow. This made my mouth pucker and my eyes water literally. So incredibly sour and tart. Didn't taste like raspberries to me, it tasted like crap. Gave my pour away."
"O: A pretty solid brew. Definitely not on the same level as Russian River, but it's tasty."
"Overall a very interesting beer, very sour but I like very sour beers. I would drink this again."
"O: Very good in each way. I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Overall I just love it. Wild ales kick ass!"
"O - I'm glad I witnessed the first beer so sour it made the almighty Beerwolf cry. This is so acidic it'll strip week old blood from a highway of even the messiest roadkill. And move over Coke, this'll dissolve a nail in seconds. Ok, seriously though, the old moldy-like raspberry doesn't do it for me but the sourness does, and damn is this sour as hell. It's so sour it's almost straight from a nightmare. The best nightmare ever!"
"overall easily the single best offering from weyerbacher i had ever had."
"Original Review: This beer is wild for sure. The color of the beer is a like a pinkish hue thats a bit cloudy sort of like a wine that had something else spilled into it. The sediment was unmistakable and the head disappeared within a few minutes after the pour. The aroma of this beer was of sweet and tart fermented raspberries and a bit of the wild yeast in there too. The taste is sour, makes me almost pucker. I sipped this one for quite some time. The mouthfeel is pretty light and a little on the flatter side. Glad I tried it, but it's a little too pricey to have again."
"2010 batch, sticker on the bottle notes extra sourness of this batch. It pours a bloody diarrhea color with a huge deposit in the bottom of the bottle. Pour all at once or chew funky yeast in the last glass. Very little carbonation is present, a vigorous pour yields a few slick bubbles. Color is decent once the sediment subsides, a reddish tan color with good clarity. Aromas are fun-ky. Sour cherries and sweetarts. Flavor is confusing. Initial impact of fruit is great but the onset of sour is intense. I'm not one to complain about a little sour, but the chalky aftertaste of dissolved sweetarts and acid with an earthy, underripe sour cherry bite is a bit much for me. This would probably benefit from about 20 years in the basement to mellow the f*ck out. I struggled through my half of the bottle. Whew."
"D: not something I would have every day, but it's easy to put down. the smooth mouthfeel and sweet taste make swigs easy, though the ABV comes knocking if you take too deep of a pull."
"Clear red pour with practically no head. Little to no lacing as i swirl it around the glass. Very sour, fruity aroma. Acidic, burning, bandaid in the nose as well. Flavor is also very sour. Mouth puckeringly sour, raspberry, barnyard funk. Alcohol well perceived, but not offensive. Prickly carbonation. Well out together sour ale."
"O: Future potential"
"O: I am really glad I picked this up. It is an extreme beer to be sure, but very interesting if you like sours."
"I feel like this is my first ""real"" sour and that this is just an amped up version of the other sour beers I have had. It is my first American Wild Ale. I don't understand the relatively low scores. Aren't sours supposed to be sour? This is very acidic and mostly in a good way. The barreling/oaking is great."
"Decent body, somewhat higher carbonation, fairly dry on the palate. This drinks pretty well, but it was a bit challenging to finish the bottle between two people, especially due to the acidic sourness which seemed to mount over time. Definitely tasty, but not something I'd want to take on by myself."
"D - Wish they had this in 12oz bottles. Its a bit too much but not bad to share with a friend. I was glad to try this and it does have some good aspects, but there was something a bit off, like it was just too boozy."
"D-very big flavors, lots of alcohol, sweetness, and yeast. I'd thick this is better with some age to mellow the carbonation and alcohol."
"d - A nice wild ale that is VERY tart. The smell is insanely sour and it's a lip puckering beer. Would like to have again."
"Drinkability: The use of raspberries here is nearly perfect. In terms of getting the potential out of the fruit, Riserva or New Glarus Raspberry Tart are tops for me right now. Obviously different types of beers, but no other beer even gets close to producing an adequate raspberry taste for me. This is something I would keep in my fridge all the time."
"This was a fun beer to drink, haha. Bucket loads of acidity. However, the raspberry flavor is well done. A new batch of this beer with better bugs could have a lot of potential. I may look for this in the future if they tweak it a bit."
"Drinkability: Not sure what to make about this one. It tastes great, but the nose is a bit underwhelming and the lack of carbonation really takes away from the beer. I've had the 2009 and really enjoyed that one, so I'll measure the drinkability as an average of the two."
"SkÅL!"
" The taste is odd, one minute it has a sweet raspberry which seems to turn funky and sour and in the same taste is alcoholic and has a bitter edge with more funk and light sugary tang too, I can't say it is terrible, but just doesn't seem to mesh and the wierd vinous elements clash with the strong alcohol taste. I was glad I got to try this, but wish I had tasted it earlier, I probably shouldn't have saved it and I am willing to guess some of the fruit may have covered the strong booziness - It just tastes like it is past its prime."
"D - This is a really interesting beer. Thanks to drfabulous fro sharing."
"Drinkability: Super sour and dry. The acidity is almost overwhelming, but this beer is still good."
"D - Small pour is good for this. Splitting with two other people is idle, sharing this with 4 or 5 is probably better. It's an intense treat. Great palate cleanser. I wouldn't go out of my way to find it, but will happily drink again if someone was sharing."
"Overall, a nice take on the style with some nice fruit notes. The flavors do lack a little balance and it does feel a bit like a sour bomb, but I enjoyed it. I'm really surprised how well the ABV was hidden."
"Mouthfeel suffers due to over-present alcohol and under-present carbonation. As for drinkability, it wasn't bad, I easily sipped my way through the first half of the bottle, but the second half will be a chore."
"Drinkability: A little bit better than I expected. I remember Batch #1 of Weyerbacher Riserva being blasted - I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, and didn't particularly care, given that I wasn't trading yet and knew this beer wasn't being distributed in Virginia. Was it west coast wild ale hubris? Was it not sour enough for the sour heads? Who knows. This one's sour enough for me, and - thought it doesn't ascend quite to the funky levels of those Russian River classics which I taste hints and flourishes of here (Consecration and Supplication being the closest, perhaps, more the latter than the former) - I'd put it right up there with Cuvee de Castleton in my book as the best non-Russian River U.S. wild ale I've had the opportunity to try (though I have a Rosso in my cellar at the moment I'm hoping - for my sake - will bust that standard). As it stands, I'm glad I picked this one up - the 11.4% is an afterthought, completely unnoticeable, and only faintly expressive in my mannerisms after nursing this for an evening watching the Golden Globes. Tentatively recommended, if only because of the price point, though I guess that's also nothing new for those who fancy the style."
"I have to take points off for mouthfeel, because I expect carbonation even though the bottle warned there wouldn't be. This is a relatively heavy beer as well. The mouthfeel lowers the drinkability, but this is still an enjoyable beer."
"Thanks for cracking this one Andy. Looks like cranberry juice, seriously, still and no head. Looks alright, but boring and it doesn't really resemble beer to me. Holy tart. The aroma is really tart. It's a tart cider vinegar aroma with a slightly sweet and very tart raspberry finish. Well, the pallet is a lot more mellow than the aroma. The flavor is a bit sweeter than the aroma lets on and it finishes just slightly tart. The mouthfeel is kind of light and damn near still. It's not bad by any means, but it's hard for me to get it into the mindset that I'm drinking beer on this guy. Overall, it's good, flavor and an enjoyable sipper."
"Drinkability- Quite the beer here. Very sour and very fruity and hard to believe this beer is over 11% ABV. I'd honestly compare this beer more to a raspberry vinaigrette than to any other beer that I can think of. Once your palette gets used the sour though it's very enjoyable. Thanks much Jeff you generous son-a-gun!"
"D - It is so easy to drink this... I really love this beer. the mixture of sweet and sour notes along with the beautiful raspberry flavor is amazing. A must try in my opinion for any fan of sour beers."
"Massive thanks goes out to t0rin0 for sharing this one on my recent trip to Cali. Served from bottle into a challice. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, and tart notes. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, sour, tart, and raspberries. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. It was definitely a very nice palate cleanser style brew for the evening. Not a whole lot missing in this one that could be improved upon for what they were going for in it. Really glad this is readily available in my area currently!"
"D: This batch didn't seem to be quite as good as the previous ones, though that could be due to my increased experience with wild beers. Still enjoyable enough, though."
"Poured a pinkish brown in color with yellow highlights that had a thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. Lots of raspberries in the aroma alongside some citrus, acidic , and oaky notes but had a little bretty funk and faint vinegar notes in the background. The taste was moslty composed of tart raspberries slight vinegar character but had oaky, citrusy, funky accents and a touch of acidity. The brew was medium in body with a nice amount of carbonation which had a fruity, oaky, mild funky, and tart finish. Actually enjoyed this brew a lot and thought it was a solid wild ale. It definitely was tasty and was drinking good."
"Nice beer, good change of pace."
"2010 Batch. I went to Abe's Cold Beer looking for a sour and this seemed like a good option. However upon opening, it was clear this beer wasn't going to stand up to previous reviews. There was a strongly acidic earthy garden tang. Not quite of rotting produce or horseblanket, but very unpleasant. The raspberry element was quite good and nicely balanced against the level of the funk. The sour character needs work. I did not bother to finish the bottle. It's not the pleasant, zesty flavors and aromas you'd expect in a ftamboise type ale."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer and picked up a couple of extra bottles to enjoy and see how they develop."
"This year's bottling. Ruby pour with no real head to speak of. Slight pink ring of foam around the glass and no lacing. These are still waters. Aroma is abundantly sweet raspberry, veering into Lindmann's territory. That sweetness is in the taste up front, but the vinegary pucker evens things up. Alcohol makes its presence known. Mouthfeel is fine for the the beer, but could be better. Drinkability for a bottle of this size is a chore. Best to share amongst friends. This is a worthy experiment from Weyerbacher, and fans of wild and sour beers won't find much off putting here. I am appreciative of a sour with this high an abv, which is not the norm for the style. Recommended with that warning."
"Bottle. 2010 bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a cloudy reddish color with a slight white collared head. Wow, just wow, the bottle even comes with a ""warming"" that this beer is exceptionally sour and they aren't kidding. The nose is strong acetic with an underlying raspberry fruitiness. Sweet and sour, mouthpuckering and dry. Light mouthfeel. The fruit does come through nicely though. Very good. Surprised at how cloudy this beer still is."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with very low carbonation, makes it tough(er) to drink. disappointing. i really wanted to like this beer, especially paying almost $19 for the bottle. alas, it's simply not for me."
"D- This beer was gone it seemed like once it hit my glass. I actually liked the lack of carbonation in this beer. Was it the most sour beer I have had? No not really. Was it fantastic never the less? Why yes..yes it was. I am glad Weyerbacher did good by bottling this and just putting the warning label on it. The alcohol was very well hidden in the sourness. A job well done!!"
"Poured somewhere between a light brown and a red with no head. The aroma was dominated by a cidery vinegary smell. It smelled very sour. The taste had notes of black cherry and currants but they were faint. This beer was totally dominated by its extreme sourness. It was very tart, reminded me of those crybaby candies. The sourness just coats your toungue and lingers, I now understand what people mean when they use the term ""horse blanket"" to describe these kinds of beers. I love sours but this was way too sour for me, I couldn't imagine drinking more than one."
"Relatively recently at the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington, NJ, a fellow patron walked in with this bottle. Into a 4oz sampling glass, it poured a cloudy pink (like grapefruit juice, mixed with cranberry juice), with less than a finger of head; poor retention and lacing, and little visible carbonation. The nose was amazingly floral and berry'ish...strawberry, blackberry, cranberry, etc. The taste confirmed this; a nicely balanced sour berry nuance throughout, and finishing on a sour note. Thin, smooth, and very little carbonation. This was a nice surprise; definitely not something I'd session, but maybe something I'd consider serving at a holiday party in flutes. A very nice elegant yet fruity offering."
"D: I hope that it didn't damage the plumbing connected to the drain!"
"The taste is a different story. This is over-the-top source and the slight fruit presence from the nose is completely gone. Instead, there is an incredible amount of pucker factor and a hefty dose of vinegar. After Alex shared that Santa Fe wild a few weeks back, I thought that I had reached a sour peak. Not necessarily so. I'll bump the mouthfeel for the fact that I somewhat enjoyed trying to choke this down before it melted my nearly-frozen insides on this frigid, frigid morning. Oh yeah, it's flat. Drinkability was not good. If not for the pure novelty of trying to drink something this sour, there's not really much to enjoy here."
"O: I raised my review slightly since my review from several years ago. Really, really nice, and the best Weyerbacher beer in their arsenal."
"Drinkability: I've been missing out all of these years with Wild American Ales, but now that I've seen the light, I've been saved! Thank you Weyerbacher and your ilk for showing me the right path that I've overlooked! Excellent! If your a fan of the sours...get this in your glass right now!"
"This is not for the uninitiated into the world of sour beer. Unless you've had a lambic or a gueze you're not going to be ready for this. For those of us who love these beers, this one is a lot of fun. I can't help but think that many other breweries would have poured this beer due to the mustiness taken from the vinegar taste, but Weyerbacher released it with the ""warning"" on the bottle. Kudos to them for doing so, knowing that there would be some of us out there that would enjoy this beer."
"Drinkability: The acidic harshness could be a bit much over time. However, a 750ml goes down fine by yourself. Not a bad value either for a beer of this quality."
"Drinkability: Drinks easy enough, but so many people are nailing the american wild ale style it takes a bit more to earn high marks these days; a few years ago this would have been notable."
"2010 bottle. Whoa. Pours a hazy iron red color with some wispy head to it (apparently there was more carbonation than the bottle led me to believe there would be). Nose is slightly medicinal, but that's kind of the nature of raspberry beers in my experience, but tart and acidic notes are definitely there too. Raspberries make a play. The first sip is just bracing. Very very very sour and tart, leans on the tart side of things, but acetic notes make a play too. Raspberries come through mid-palate, giving a bit of relief. Almost burns my lips. Reminds me of Rose de Gambrinus, but a little more robust and a little less elegant/refined. This is a hell of an experience. Alcohol is not noticeable at all over the sour onslaught. Tough drink, but one I certainly didn't want to end. Gonna grab another for sure, even at the $18 price tag."
"The overly sour notes make this one a sipper, as does the high ABV. You can't do this for long but you can enjoy it while it lasts. Outstanding beer. I went out and bought a bottle a week later. Interested to see how time plays on this one."
"Because their is no carbonation it makes drinking this a real chore. Damn shame too. This could be a real contender with any Wild Ale out there but the flat look and taste really knocks its creditability down. Kind of dissapointing."
"""Acidic fuel nose, burning. Ridiculous acidic mouth, some decent raspberry underneath, oak, but completely destroyed by the ridiculous acidic bullshit. I do not have time for this."""
"D - I've got to say I'm really dissapointed with this sour. I know they are supposed to be high on funk but really this just made me regret the 18.00 pricetag. I'm also glad I split the bottle with my girl and she kind of liked it. I've got one more bottle and I'm hoping that a few... or 10 years does something good to this beer."
"D - Sips like a rosé, with alcohol punch like a sherry. Again, one glass is very enjoyable with fruit and cheese."
"Disclaimer: please don't drink dilute fingernail polish. EtOAc is bad enough by itself, but there are much more nasty compounds than just the acetate in these products."
"D: Wow, this is great to drink; if I had the opportunity, I'd finish a whole bottle in one sitting without noticing the alcohol until later. I really like how the sourness gives way to some sweetness."
"Beer is thin and super bright on the palate, its about as complex as you can get. It's pretty hard to drink due to the high acidity. Not much in the way of lactic acid, its all acetic all the way. The brett character grew on me the more I drank it, turned out to be a decent beer, just a rough start."
"2010 batch. Awesome this year. I'll go ahead and say it... it's like gambrinus extra. Love it. Murky raspberry red with a white-pink head that pops and fades just like I like for the style. Nose is fermented tart raspberry, wood, funk, faint cobwebby cellar, vanilla and on. A tad sweet, and I would love to see where this batch is going to go after a few years in the bottle. Taste is tart, oaky raspberry, with a hair of cider just like nose suggested, and in very appealing harmoÑy. If this batch is 11%, then it should get a 5.0 for drinkability because there is just a hint of heat wrapped up in it that elevates the other flavors amazingly well. Blown away by how good this year's batch is. Awesome. Not for everyone though, and i wonder if there is variation from barrel to barrel, because from reading other reviews, it doesn't sound like this is the same beer at all. Anyways, I loved it, and am happy to see Weyerbacher trying their hand in the wonderful world of wild."
"This beer tastes like a true flanders red ale, a lot like rodenbach grand cru. If you can imagine carbonated Hunt's ketchup with malt vinegar, you got the idea. Deep smoky amber color with very little head. Refreshing and smooth, the 11%+ abv really sneaks up on you. Another great beer by Weyerbacher, one of the best PA breweries."
"Was fortunate enough to try this last weekend at Weyerbacher. Transparent reddish-brown body with little carbonation and slight head. Splended nose, with hints of rasberry and suttle oak. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but if you like traditional Flemish Sours you will love this. This is one of the top ten beers I have ever tasted. Weyerbacher has done it again! BRAVO"
"Bottled 2010, I was very impressed with this year's batch compared to previous years. The appearance was as expected, faint cherry red as in previous years. The smell is what draws the curiosity as it exudes raspberry (as expected) and deep pungent vinegar tones (as described on the label of the bottle). The taste was the sell, very low carbonation and extreme sourness that is backed up brilliantly with natural sugars. This wild ale is outstanding and personally I do not prefer wild ales in general. As a hophead, I surprisingly enjoyed it to the point that I went out and bought a bottle for the upcoming holidays. This is definitely a sipping ale and the ABV is clearly understated in this 2010 batch. Absolutely a must if you are into sour ales."
"D- Sip to enjoy. This is deffinitely an acquired taste. I thought it was pretty good. Can see how certain people go nuts over this stuff. Would buy a 750ml bottle, they were only sellin cases at the brewery though for 145 a case, little pricey. Glad they got it out to try though."
"D: Extremely drinkable and enjoyable, especially for having an ABV of 11.4%. I would love to come across another bottle some day."
"Overall: This competes with Russian River as far as wild ales go. It may be a three trick pony(raspberry,oak and funk. But the way they all blend together with the wonderful sourness is a work of art. I've heard the 2010 batch is even more sour. Can't wait for the release party next week."
"D - Good, not great. I enjoyed the Upland Raspberry more then this one, but that's not to say I wouldn't take the chance to enjoy again."
"D - This is a pretty solid brew, although it seems to differ from year-to-year as I remember trying this before and not enjoying it nearly as much."
"750 mL bottle courtesy of Diomede. Pours a milky brownish-pink color with a fine ecru head. Smells like soured Raspberry Tart, which is not a bad thing. Vivid wild berry notes. Flavor is sharp and tart with minor solvent character. Perhaps Weyerbacher was a bit too ambitious with the alcohol percentage but it isn't killing me. The acidity helps to hide it to a degree. Maybe it's just a small sample size but I dug this stuff."
"Fresh but not green at all, perfect to drink now, and we're sure several months, if not a year or so, would make things interesting. Weyerbacher is right on target with Riserva. Please, keep on experimenting, guys!"
"Surprisingly drinkable for what it is. Not quite as complex or bretty-wild as I prefer in the style but there's more than enough to keep me engaged (second glass was enjoyed more than the first which is always a good sign). Altogether very well done and fun as a change of pace even if it's not exactly my thing."
"Cheers!"
"Drinks: warm, the obnoxious funk flavor, paired with the unsettling mouthfeel, makes this beer nigh undrinkable. However, I tried it colder and enjoyed it much more."
"Kudos to Weyerbacher for bringing something new to the American wild ale table. Riserva is a hybrid fruit lambic and wild ale will probably give purists a stroke, but I'm fully onboard with their vision. If this isn't an annual release, it should be. Thanks onix1agr."
"D/O- A decent attempt at a Wild from the guys at Weyerbacher. With the alcohol and the tart bitterness in this beer, it was becoming a chore for me to finish towards the end. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I'll search this one out again. Cheers."
"D - Tartness and funk makes it a little bit less than sessionalbe, although it's not bad. Good stuff, I've had better wilds, but wouldn't mind having this again."
"Overall, this is ok, nothing special to seek out. A little sweet, but not a good wild."
"Drinkability:Overall this is an impressively done sour, and I'm curious about how it will change over time. This beer reminds me of a wine a little bit, probably because of the oak and raspberries."
"I think this beer would be epic without the raspberry and with MUCH less oak...perhaps a few more years aging would help this one out."
"The body is light, surprisingly light for such a strong beer, so this goes down dangerously quick. I liked it more than most beers from Weyerbacher but once is probably enough."
"2009 vintage. The beer pours a hazy red-brown color with a white head. It looks about like iced tea. The aroma is extremely tart raspberries. The flavor is more complex with raspberries and medium tartness. You also get some oak and vanilla. The beer has a decent amount of sourness, but it is not near as sour as the aroma leads you to believe it will be. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Wow...this is awesome. For a little brewery, what a great wild ale. The reviews on this beer are definitely mixed...but I have to say, this is indeed awesome! Tons of tartness up front, acidic/vinegar like. Oak abounds through-out....booziness is mild for the ABV. Best part, amoungst all this confusion of flavors...TONS of cherries/fruit. Light and crisp mouthfeel, high carbonation...easy drinker. Way to go Weyerbacher!"
"I can't wait to get a few more bottles of this to toss in the cellar."
"D- i probably will seek this one out again because i really like weyerbacher, and my experience seems different from most other reviews of this ive seen. if i have another bottle like this one, ill never consider trying it again. fort gone wild."
"pours a amber-ruby hazy color with very spare head and lacing. bit of a champaign like smell and taste but obviously way more fantastic. extreme fizzy lively carbonation. rasberry hints in the smell but more noticable in the taste. slightly bitter finish with a raspberry soda like feel. hard to tell this thing even had alcohol in it till after my second glass was finished. wasn't all that i had hoped for, but i also make extremely unreasonable expections that usually never get met. would definitely buy again, wish it was a bit easier to get my hands on."
"Drinks very well- not sign of 11.4 sweet/wine may catch some people raw."
"Really glad that I got the opprotunity to taste this. Pours pinkish with very little head. The aroma is vinegar-like funk that is very acrid and almost burns my nose. The taste is much more funky than I thought. Based on the description on the bottle I would have thought that there would be more fruit flavor present. The funk and the carbonation make it an extraordinary drinker. Ridiculously easy to drink for such a strong drinker. It's not fair that I can't find this locally."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is biting and sharp, but certainly excites the tongue. This is extremely drinkable, can't taste the alcohol at all and something I will certainly seek out in the future."
"D - Enjoyed by all. And despite this review's repeated reference to alcohol, it did not drink too hot, and certainly did not seem anywhere near 11+%."
"D- I really enjoyed this sour. I had no problem finishing this bottle. I wish I had more."
"D - At over 10% one was enough. Although I don't know if my tastebuds could handle much more."
"Over a year in the making, this beer is fermented with Brettanomyces yeast and aged with red-raspberry puree in Oak barrels for over 1 year, then bottle conditioned in champagne bottles. Sounds promising, yes? It poured a murky deep red color. It smelled like tart raspberries and Brett- so good so far. It tasted sour! Raspberries, oak, a bit vinegary. But overall a good pucker in your mouth raspberry sour."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty and cloudy reddish color ale with a small bubbly head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma of gross funky notes and lightly sweet and somewhat tart raspberry is pleasant but gets gross with the weird funky notes. Taste is also a strange mix between some nice tart raspberry notes with just enough sweetness too offset the acidity but the weird barnyard notes are not that pleasant. Body is quite full with limited filtration and medium carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I very much anticipated tasting this one but must admit being disappointed after all."
"The beer pours a hazy red color with a 1/4"" white head with pink hues. The aroma is good. It has a very sour Brett nose with a nice raspberry aroma. The Brett dominates with little oak character coming through. The taste is decent. It's equal parts raspberry, alcohol, and Brett flavors. It's tart with a good amount of sourness. The alcohol character is a little much. It takes away from what would probably be a really nice raspberry flavor. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good brew. I like the sounds of it, but they need to back the sugars down a bit."
"Overall I wasn't expecting the world from this beer due to lackluster reviews but I was wrong. A very well done beer had at the right time when all components played off of each other almost perfectly. Well worth a shot and I recommend digging in after about six months."
"Notes: This would be a good bottle to share at a tasting, as only a few ounces are needed to get an idea of what this brew is all about."
"Drinkability: I keep wanting to tell myself, ""You know, this might be a 4 overall," but I just can't bring it down that low, considering all the attributes and the experience I've had with this. Yes, my stomach feels like a big ball of acid right now. Yes, it's a little pricey. And if I were to have this a few months after getting into the craft beer scene, who knows what I would've thought? But I like sour ales a lot, and I like raspberries a lot. And I love Weyerbacher. I was pretty sure that combination wouldn't disappoint. And it doesn't. If you're not a fan of sour ales, this won't convert you, but if you are, you should certainly give it a shot."
"D: Actually, pretty friggin' awesome. Best thing we've ever had from Weyerbacher, hands down!"
"D: This was fantastic, I'm real glad I got to check this one out. Honestly I had no idea this was 11.4% when I tasted it, it hides it beautifully."
"Drinkability? The raspberry puree and the base beer are doing wonders despite the huge alcohol content. I'm sure some will find this difficult to drink but it is right up my alley....read very drinkable. Thanks again, Alan!"
"Overall, this beer definitely has some character flaws. Way too sweet and acetic in the finish to be enjoyable. The consistency of the beer didn't help as it caused the brain to associate it with cough syrup. Will probably pass on this one next time around."
"Regardless, very complex and bretty, but I'll pass on future vintages due to the high price tag."
"D - This is quite the potent offering from Weyerbacher... Definitely needs to be allowed to warm as it opens up greatlly... Layers of complexity in all facets.... Not for the weak of heart (or palette)..."
"Wow, much more sour/tart than I thought it would be, after a few sips it becomes more palatable, the raspberries really shine through with a bit of a vinegar aftertaste, the alcohol is well hidden behind the tartness, strong vibrant carbonation dances on the tongue, not picking up too much oak or woodiness."
"EDIT: After almost two hours of drinking this and slowing down on it, I realize the drinkability is not a 3.5, but a mere 2.5 average. It is fun to sip on, but once the bottom of the bottle is visible, it is just too much. I should of shared this with someone."
"Had absolutely no problem finishing this one off between the two of us. Had great joy dipping a finger in it and letting our 7 month old pucker up before asking for some more. We did enjoy this one; thanks again Smason!"
"Bottle. Once the cork came out on this one it shot foam everywhere, had to have a glass handy to start pouring. Seemed like there would be a lot of carbonation. Poured a cloudy pinkish, reddish, brown color with a foamy white head. Smelled very fruite, a lot of raspberry and a little bit of sourness. Taste was not as sour as I expected, actually tasted like Chloraseptic throat spray on the back end. This was really hard to finish even with sharing it with a friend. For the explosion of foam upon opening there was no carbonation. Just a thick and syrupy raspberry blend."
"Overall I am a little disappointed with this beer, seems the wildness took over and hurt the drinkability of the beer. Not sure I could even recommend this to others to try, but I guess that could be part of the chance of using wild yeast."
"I really did enjoy this, and I finished the entire bottle to myself. I just wish it had more raspberry characteristics and maybe a more refined wild yeast presense and not so much acidic vinegar. At times it was painful, even. Still, a unique and very enjoyable brew."
"This poured a nearly opaque reddish mahogany with a bit of tan head. It smelled like sour cherry and sweet raspberry and oak, with some sour yeast and very tart apples, and a bit of copper and alcohol. It tasted like sour apple and cherry and grape and raspberry, with oak and some copper and a bit of bready yeast and alcohol. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a very tart lasting aftertaste. Overall this was a very complex and powerful beer with a great sour taste, like Consecration but more raspberry than cherry. However, I was surprised at the mix of sour flavors in this beer, rather than straight dominant raspberry. It had good body too, but the alcohol was pretty hot, so drinkability was a bit hindered. Not sure if that would improve with age, as the alcohol heat might fade, but the sourness might increase. Either way, this was a great sipping beer that is highly recommended if you can find it."
"Kevin - Thanks for the great trade!"
"Overall a great brew highly recommend !!!"
"mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little under-carbonated (cant believe i just said that). drinkability is great. at 11.4%, I'll be drinking all 750mls no problem."
"Drinkability is OK, decent taste but it's a very strong, fruity beer that beckons sharing. Luckily, my folks were visiting, and both enjoyed it as well, in small doses. This has aged well for a fruit beer with minimal funk, but the fusels could probably use some more time to round out."
"I poured from a bomber (2009 vintage) into a snifter. The beer looks like a fizzy guava juice, mauve with a fizzy little head. The aroma is fruity with an alcohol and tannicy backbone. The flavor is very fruity with a streak of hot alcohol. The oak makes it a very dry finish. The flavor profile is almost wine like. The beer is highly carbonated and medium bodied. The beer is a definite sipper, but a sipper that can be enjoyed all night. I really liked this one."
"D: It is not dry or funky enough to be super drinkable. It makes a nice dessert beer, but I was expecting more. This was still a nice first attempt by Weyerbacher and I hope the futer batches will be even better."
"I have no benchmark for scoring, so keep that in mind."
"Significantly more acidic than last year's vintage. Nose and taste give aggressive acetic acid, strong raspberry flavor, but relatively little tannic astringency. Carbonation is a bit low, but well within an acceptable range."
"Apple cider meets vinegar with a ton of rasp berries. Very acidic and sour. Pungent. Mouth puckering. Warheads!!! Sour patch kids!!!! Color is a bright raspberry ruby."
"Overall, I love this beer. The sour/funk spectrum comes immediately in the nose and just becomes intensified as soon as one begins to drink."
"Overall, not the best wild I've ever had by any means but still fairly tasty and easy to drink. Probably won't wow you but it isn't terrible at all."
"As stated above, this one could use a little more age. The alcohol was somewhat of a distraction."
"Beautiful ruby red pour with white head which settles quickly.. Aroma is very tart, very sour with strong raspberry. Quite strong and robust. Taste is very, very tart. Sour with grapefruit and raspberry. Some yeast, bready flavor and esters as well as a savory, cheese-like flavor in the aftertaste. Strong with alcohol. Mouth is medium-bodied and medium-carbonated. The tartness and sour are quite present in the mouth, very strong and taking away a bit, but not to an extent that it is bad. Its a powerful drink and could be a bit much, but still quite good and enjoyable. Definitely for the right time and palce."
"A rather enjoyable, and even sweet, wild ale. Best sipped considering its strength."
"M = Medium body, lots of carbonation for as little head as it produces, very good mouthcoating."
"My overall review one line review would be...""There's more b vitamins than a flinstone chewable."""
"Mouthfeel/drinkability; Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and could use a little more carbonation IMO. The drinkability is pretty decent as long as you can take the tartness/acidity from the raspberries."
"(Note: The 2010 is much more sour than the 2008. I never tasted the 2009, but Weyerbacher is clearly perfecting its technique.)"
"A great beer and one I'm glad to have several bottles of. I think it will be extremely interesting to see if any age develops the flavors in this and gives it an added complexity."
"75cl bottle from 2009. Thanks Frank, I was looking forward to trying this one! Pours dirty pink with a bubbly, wispy off-white head. Smells vinous, with raspberries, oak, alcohol, and some general tart funkiness. There's a real ethanol edge there, for some reason. Tastes of sour raspberry and strong wood. Sugary syrup. More alcohol. Full, sticky feel. The harshness and the sweetness make this one kind of unpleasant at times. Never smelled/tasted rubbing alcohol in a beer before..."
"Overall impressions: very nicely done, a little twangy and sour for me but the Brett was nice. Not as funky as I expected it to be, I am very much interested in these Brett beers now!"
"Overall, an interesting brew and very enjoyable. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Thanks again, Eric... for throwing down the heavy hitters."
"Extremely easy to drink but is best to be shared with friends."
"I think this is a great turn around from last years original batch. Fine tuned and delicious."
"Appearance is a murky pinkish brown, a vigorous pour creates an off white, slightly pink bubbly head that very quickly dissipates to splotches of thin film, with few specks of lacing. A steady stream of tiny bubbles from the carbonation slowly rises to the surface. Very strong, potent aroma, fairly complex. Most immediate aroma is the funky sourness and occasionally a fruity, tart raspberry aroma will linger. The aroma finishes sweeter than it starts, assuming its the oak and fruit. First taste is immediately sour and funky, much more pronounced than last year. Very nice balance of a strong tart raspberry presence, however not much fruit sweetness. Near the finish there is a slight sweetness from the oak and mild alcohol burn. Finish lingers forever with a dry, sour and tart flavor that is delicious to me. Very full, smooth body, with mild carbonation that nicely complements the sour and tart flavors. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable to me, I love this. Was very excited for this year's release and Weyerbacher delivers with a great improvement on what was already a nice beer last year."
"I had a bunch of samples, and probably could have had it all night. But I am a sour fan. If you do not like sour beers, skip it. If you are looking for something that is wonderful now, and probably will be stellar in a year,, seek it."
"This has been in my refrigerator for the past 4-5 months. It seems very different from the reviews by those done 4-5 months ago. (murky vs. clear, brownish red vs. crimson. boozy vs hidden etc.) Looks like age, even at 35 degrees doesn't do this any good. I wanted/expected to like it more. Maybe the new version is something I'll drink right away."
"Good beer, but given the choice, I'd take almost any of Weyerbacher's excellent brews."
"Drinkability: If you like the taste of raspberries stuck in a oak barrel, then you'll absolutely love this beer. If you're looking for more a variety of flavors, then you should probably look somewhere else. It's an interesting beer, but due to the availability and price, it's one of those once in a while beers."
"D: Not so much, I couldn't finish my glass"
"One of my first beers from Weyerbacher and excited to try it since it is my favorite style of beer, might need some more time in the bottle to let the brett develop, would drink again, worth trying"
"Weyerbacher's first attempt with brett was a success in my opinion. I cant wait to see what future versions will have in store for me. When pouring this be careful as it is very easy to dirty up the liquid with a lot of gunk."
"Drinkability: This is an awesome beer. I always rate sours highly, and I didn't expect this kind of beer from Weyerbacher. Probably their best beer yet. Worth seeking out."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Dry, slightly tannic and woody. Raspberry flavor is up front but neither sweet nor tart; it tastes oddly flat and lifeless. The lack of carbonation is puzzling as other reviews mention it being carbonated. $20 beers should not have quality control issues like this, as far as I'm concerned. The finish is solventy and somewhat harsh, though the alcohol is masked slightly by the fruit. Oddly one-dimensional; this beer needed a lot more time in the barrel, I think, as it has very little yeast character and any perceptible tartness seems to come more from the fruit. Not a terribly impressive beer on the whole, though I didn't mind drinking half a bottle."
"Pours a hazy brownish red with 1 finger of tannish pink head. Good retention and some good lacing. Smells of sour raspberries, Brett yeast, brown sugar, and oak. Tastes of tart raspberries, yeasty funk, brown sugar, sour Brett, and oak with some alcohol burn. Medium in body with good carbonation. Sweet and tart with some alcohol presence in the finish. An enjoyable Wild Ale, but not something I would elect to drink too frequently."
"A great brew I really appreciate this one Dim. Good drinkability and a fine wild ale from the east coat at that. I think one of Weyerbacher best."
"8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"D: This is a really nice sipper and one that ventures in what I have come to expect from Weyerbacher. Still have one more and am very interested to see what even more time will do to its development. This beer ain't cheap, but worth it."
"M: big, creamy, rich, slight alcohol bite, not clean but not cloying or unpleasant."
"Addendum: there is some improvement as this warms up; I would suggest drinking it room temperature."
"Dark red, not cloudy, faint lacing. Fruity and funky aroma, not over-powering, very inviting. Hint of raspberry or cherry along with oak. Dry, sour, fruity, oaky, faint alchohol, good carbonation level. Enough funk to let you know there's Brettanomyces, but extremely well balanced. Really quite an amazing beer."
"D: Not too bad. I couldn't drink a lot, but it's good."
"Poured into my Keizer Karel glass a very nice clean/clear golden ruby red color, very nice carbonation, little fizzy white head, with minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some slight yeast, dark cherries, raspberries, and a nice oak note. The taste is awesome, malty, slight yeast, dark cherries/raspberries, nice sour note, and some oak notes. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, very tasty, highly recommended. Thanks Mike."
"D: A very nice drinking raspberry style. Very smooth, clean, though felt limited complexity wise at times and not justified of the high price of admission. Good overall flavor though not worthy of its price tag."
"I think this has really good potential and I think this is probably an excellent candidate for the cellar. It's rough around the edges and a bit harsh right now. I'm guessing some age would help this meld together better. Overall, I am impressed by the effort by Weyerbacher. Right now it's a good beer, but doesn't get very close to greatness. With some age, who knows?"
"d: This is a tough one to summarize. I split this bottle with one other person and we both agreed that 6 oz would have been plenty. There is plenty to like about this, but ultimatley, it lacks complexity. The raspberries all but overwhelm everything else. I'm very glad to have tried this one."
"Pours a light ruby with brown highlights. Not a whole lot of head at all on the pour, but very good amount of carbonation. Smell is dark fruits, mainly raspberry and some funk. Taste is more of the raspberry, but a good amount of brett and some tart funkyness. This was a bit of a shocker. I enjoyed this much more than I had aniticipated. Would like to get another bottle of this to try in the near future."
"D: No hint of the ABV at all. This beer was a monster. Super drinkable and a totally extreme beer. Glad to see weyerbacher making some wacky stuff. Definately worth trying."
"Speaking of special releases, why is it that Captain Lawrence and Weyerbacher can release quality rare beers for $13/750 ml bottle and we're paying in $30 for Isabelle or $15 for a 375 ml of Beatification out here in Ca? I think I'm getting my beers from the east coast from now on."
"D-Not the biggest fan of rasberries but this was good and changed as it warmed. Very nice."
"Body is medium, slick, creamy, and coating. A light airy mouthfeel glides the layers of flavor across your palate. Would be an excellent candidate for the cellar."
"Big thanks goes to the beer guy at Marty's in Newton for fishing this last bottle they had out of the basement for me. Poured in to a DFH snifter a murky strawberry color. This one looks more like one of my sister's cosmos than a beer. Almost the way a cocktail looks after some ice has melted in to it...very interesting. Nose is dominated by raspberries, but some musty cellar smells and green leaf also come through. Taste is also dominated by raspberry, bit of hard booze (reminiscent of Stoli Raspberry Vodka), earthy tones, great mix of sweet and sour. Mouthfeel is cool in that the carbonation adds a bit of burn to the boozy aspect of it. Still strikes me as being medium in body. A good sipper for sure, I would drink this with one or two friends. Boy, lately Weyerbacher have been batting a thousand with their beers. This one is another home run for me."
"Wow. How interesting. This is as much wine like as it is beer. So unusual and unique. It's definitely the next generation and I'm glad I have another bottle!"
"This is an extremely drinkable beer, the high ABV is well concealed. Wish I had purchased more than two when I had the chance."
"Deep strawberry hue with amber shadings, and very slight haze. Bubbly, almost soda-like head that reduces to a thin, creamy ring. Raspberry jam, preserved lemons, and oak in the nose. Bright acidity coming to a carbonic & lactic crescendo followed by short burst of fruit quickly giving way to a lingering, smooth, oaky finish. Raspberry underpinning all the way. Aftertaste is rich, almost like mascarpone. Carbonation is pretty low, and body is fairly hefty compared to expectations. Alcohol presence is minimal though I know there's a lot in there. Sticky lips after a few sips leads me to believe that the relatively high alcohol (according to the brewery, from an independent test) works with the acid to keep this slightly sweet beer from becoming too sweet. I early await this beer with some age on it. If the acidity wins then good things will come, though my gut says the ravages of oxidation will accentuate the wood. A year and a half in the bottle should be good enough to signal its future."
"Pours a pinkish and cherry red with a small, bubbly, lingering head. Smell is immediately of sour cherries and sweet raspberries. A mild smell of vinegar, oak, and sherry transcends the fruit aroma. Initial flavor is of oxidized raspberries and a well hidden layer of alcohol. The beer is mildly spicy and tart, while a very small amount of brett character is present. There is no bitterness to this beer, only a slight sour character. The abv makes this a very strong wild ale, but the taste of alcohol is barely present. The beer is well carbonated. I just started this, but I think towards the end it will be a chore to drink."
"Pours a raspberry-like red with a decent off-white head. Little staying power. Smells of tart raspberries, barnyard, and oak. The brett is pretty sour in the nose and in the taste. Borderline puckering. Raspberries lend a sweet/tart body a much needed balance to the sour brett. The oak is subtle, adding a soft vanilla undertone. Mouthfeel is deep and complex, moderate carbonation. Alcohol is well-hidden and as long as you like a sour ale, this would should not disappoint."
"easy to drink but 750 ml is a bit much at once. Share this one with a friend or two, will be much more enjoyable."
"Definitely a sipper but clean and hearty all at once."
"Pours a clear blood red with a two finger light tan colored head that quickly disappears to a paper thin whispy layer of bubbles. Minimal lacing sticks to the side s of the glass. Smell begins pretty funky with tart red berries, some vinegar, and hard candy sugar. A touch of oak and honey linger in the nose as well. I have no idea where the 11.4% abv is in the scent, unreal. The flavor begins with a balanced blend of tart and sweet raspberries as well as some lingering warm booze and red wine. Honey, vanilla, and cane sugar emerge midway on the tongue with some sour notes. The aftertaste consists of pepper, raspberry syrup, and oak with more alcohol warming flavors. A lot going on with this beer in the taste department. Light to medium body with a prickly feel and a powerful carbonation, fits the style quite well. A sipper for sure, but there's nothing wrong with that. I had no problem taking my time with this bottle and enjoying everything it has to offer. Not exactly sure how many bottles are out there, but I'd love to get my hands on another one and see what some age does to this. Thanks again Josh."
"The alcohol is completely masked and the balance between the sweet and sour makes this one of most drinkable beers I have encounter. I wish I had more."
"Pours a ruddy reddish orange with a short-lived pinkish head that leaves very little lacing on the way down. The smell is mostly raspberries, both sweet and sour, and a hint of funk lingering in the background. There is also a strong candied sugar aroma as well. The taste is much like the aroma but with two distinct stage. The first wave of flavor is sweetness, both raspberries and sugar. The second wave happens as the raspberry turns tart and the funk comes in subtly in the end but not overpoweringly so. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and I was surprised by the big alcohol content as it's not that noticeable. This is a very refreshing wild ale that is not overly sour and makes for a perfect summer brew."
"Nice drinkability, extremely well balanced. THis beer has a high price tag, but I plan to grab a few more bottles while I still can."
"Drinkability - A very good beer that should get even better with age"
"D: The 11.4% alcohol is well-hidden, buried beneath on of the most complex tastes that I've come across. This beer could age for a few years but it is pretty damn good right now."
"Interestingly enough for a beer this strong, the raspberry character makes this quite a simplistic brew. Hints of a funky beer complexity lurk underneath the surface but don't quite make it out enough to make this really interesting much less balanced. Enjoyable if you like raspberries as the malt and most of the funky notes that I was hoping to find are just overwhelmed. Not bad tasting, just a bit of a let down."
"I cant wait to see how this ages!"
"I had this with some Habanero Havarti, my stomach will thank me tomorrow.."
"This is an absolute tour de force by Weyerbacher. I am not a huge fan of the Red Flander style, but this beer was so incredible, so interesting and so much fun to drink, I could absolutely see ordering it again. Of course one would be all I could drink, and I'm guessing it would take me the better part of the day to finish it off. Just an exceptional beer..."
"This beer pours a beautiful mild reddish hue with a hearty head that leaves thick lace on the glass. The aroma is filled most by the raspberry fruit, with hints of malt and oak in the back. Upon first strike on the palate the fruit is immediately apparent, but settles out with a wonderful oak flavor coming to the front. Carbonation is heavy, and fits the style extremely well. Much love went into this beer, and it shows."
