It has the awesome, tangy aroma you'd expect from the style, with sour apple notes and other subtle fruity notes, including cherry and plum.  Tartness and the fruit alike continue over into the taste, but there's more sweetness and blended smoothness than many other sours.  There's some carbonation and syrup in the mouthfeel, but it comes off lighter than many of its peers.  It's a great beer.","thebeers","Sunday at 12:57 PM"

Lactic sourness rises from the fruitiness, giving the cherries a powerful, pleasant character, hovering above musty malts and oak. Acidity then blends outstandingly well into the cherry flavor, adding a vinous note to it without becoming too sour, accentuating the rich fruitiness, balanced by the earth and leather. The beer finishes pleasantly dry nontheless, supported by a vivid carbonation, with cherryskin, toasty stone fruit pits, a vinous tang and tooth quenching sourness, still leaving enough space for rejuvenating cherry qualities.","aleigator","Feb 12, 2015"

Big tart cherry flavor supported by wine like qualities cloaked in oaky notes in the background. Tartness is cut toward the end by the malt backbone, making it sour and funky but reeling it in before it gets too far out of line. Puckering and tart with vibrant carbonation and a bone dry finish. A sipper for sure and a fantastically different beer.","HopBomb515","Jul 08, 2014"

Smell is tart cherry, and some woodiness. Taste is sour cherry, cranberry, some grassy funk, definite barrel notes. As it warms some bready malts appear. Pretty full bodied in my opinion, tons of carbonation, maybe too much for me, sourness really sticks around for a while on the palate. Overall one of my favorite sours, glad I got my hands on some recently so I could put up a review on this great beer from RR.","slackattack","Jun 26, 2014"

The flavor is slightly fruity, puckery, and has these amazing layers that just keep coming. It's one of the best beers that I ever had.

4.84,6.1,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"Poured a rich, semi-cloudy orange-brown, with two and a half fingers of fluffy white head that receded very slowly. No lacing. A very nice looking sour. Scents of sour brett yeast, oak, sour cherries, tart wild yeast funk, hints of lemon juice and a bit of overripe stone fruit in the background. A very nice aroma, rich, funky, wild and complex with a nice fruity character present as well. Flavor begins very sour, with notes of sour cherry and hints of cranberry and red wine. This moves into further sour flavors of cranberry, raspberry and cherry with notes of oak and red wine-like tannins. Finish continues to be quite tart and dry, with more abundant oak flavors, sour cranberry, raspberry and cherry and some sour, tannin-like astringency. Aftertaste is sour and dry with notes of cranberry, sour cherry and raspberry, alongside some oak. A very well done flavor profile. Dry and puckering, quite sour, but after the manner of sour red fruit and not vinegar or citrus. It has a depth and complexity to it, with fruitiness and oak helping to keep things balanced beneath the sourness. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium-high carbonation and a puckering, drying feel. Extremely nice, refreshing, yet also encouraging you to sip. The mouthfeel compliments the flavor profile nicely. Overall this is an excellent sour. It has a wonderful wild, sour, slightly fruity aroma, an excellent sour, fruity and complex flavor profile and mouthfeel that aids both the flavor of the beer and the drinking experience. Very well executed and quite a treat. Bottled on April 11th, 2013 and consumed on May 31, 2014.","Auraan","May 31, 2014"

While many sours may pound you with severe dryness, achieving great flavor but with severe detriment to your palate over the course of consumption, this ale strikes a perfect balance, never going to far either way. It utilizes a myriad of flavors from many parts of the process and creates one hell of a flavorful beer. This beer absolutely lives up to the hype.","Siriusfisherman","Apr 09, 2014"

4.76,4.4,4.5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"Bottle from the brewpub itself, dated 1/7/14. Pours a dark red color, somewhat opaque, with a one finger off white head on top. Aroma of sour cherries, vinegar, vinous grape notes. Very nice. Flavor is a medley of sour cherries and vinegar first, but with some beautiful oak and vinous notes that give this a huge punch of flavor and depth. Lots of bretty funk and big lacto bite. The wine notes continue to emerge as it warms. Some nice sweetness that balances out the sour beautifully. Full bodied for a sour brew, with lots of carbonation. A top rated beer for good reason. This is honestly one of the best beers I've ever had.","BMMillsy","Mar 04, 2014"

The beer had lots of carbonation but not as much as champagne. The beer was dry with some sweetness and lots of fruit flavor with cherry being the dominant fruit flavor. The beer was sour but it was not overwhelming. The beer finishes tart with a slight bitterness. The beer had a ruby red/ caramel color to it.

Smell is fairly one dimensional and potent it's advertising the presence of sour cherries. Taste is all about cherries and currants it's sour but not puckeringly aggressive. There is a bit of sweetness and acid reminiscent of raspberries. A light dose of funk but thankfully not over the top and it works well here. Medium light body and brightly carbonated. Finish is cherry, tart, and dry. Definitely shows off the Pinot barrel aging. Very good.","JackieTH","Dec 28, 2013"

I'm not sure. Strongest/sourest cherry flavor in a beer I've ever had. A little over the top for me, but obviously well crafted. Big and bright flavors for sure. Barrel aging isn't over the top and adds quite a bit of complexity. I'm not a big fan of wine or wine barrel beers so my subjectivity is showing with my scores. It's a good beer but just not up my alley, I think.","Dope","Dec 02, 2013"

It’s extraordinarily drinkable for a sour beer at nearly 8% ABV, I think due to the sweeter elements that balance out the sour ones. It’s very complex but very approachable at the same time. By that I mean that there are aromas and flavors that scream out at you but there are also layers upon layers of other aromas and flavors if you keep digging. Really my only complaint as others have said is that I wish it was in a bigger bottle so I could have more. The price is a little tough, too, especially for a bottle this size, but it really is a fantastic beer. Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this one, Jared!","BlackBelt5112203","Aug 14, 2013"

Taste shines right with the smell with a glorious burst of dark cherry, morphing into tart cherry, then transforming into a beautiful barnyard funk, with some horseblanket and hay, followed by wet dirt (think moist turned up soil), and light lactic sourness. Mouthfeel is spot on, bracing carbonation that carries the flavors around without being too abrasive. Must buy, must try for the sour fan.","taylor714914","Jun 18, 2013"

4.66,2.2,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the beer was a deep magenta color with a slight bubbly white head. The aroma, best described as a flowery cherry aroma, was enchanting. In the initial taste, one detects notes of tart and sour cherry, grape skin, sour grapes, sour fruit, and a hint of vanilla from the barrel aging. The vanilla notes come to the front more as the beer progresses toward the aftertaste. The pleasantly acidic mouthfeel is allowed to linger momentarily as the ale's thickness lingers on the back of the tongue. I could easily drink this sour before any other. I like it a lot.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 07, 2013"
4.84,6.1,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.75,"Though listed as a wild ale, I'll go out on a limb and say that this is what every sour should aim for in terms of profile. It pours a burned red-orange to pink with some lacing. The aroma is out of this world. There are definite hints of cherry and pinot noir as advertised, but I also pick up a hint of eggnog, oddly enough. The taste follows the aroma. There's a definite mouth-puckering cherry tartness that quickly fades to a dry, clean finish. The sourness is very pronounced, and I think it may mask other flavors that are present. Nevertheless, this is one of the best sours I've ever had.","tbdkev","Jun 07, 2013"

4.44,-2.6,4,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. Before you even have this guy it does a really, really good job of raising your expectations. Now, often this can lead to one being let down or disappointed, but here you are left feeling neither. Each flavor that you expect is swaddled beautifully in a blanket of soured yeastiness, bacterial infection, and solid base sweetness. The fruity bite adds to both the sweet and sour side of things, while the pinot noir woodiness adds not only flavoring, but helps to fix the mouth in a persistent, but happy, pucker. The ultimate blend is truly wonderful in its simplistic complexity.","TheBrewo","May 26, 2013"

4.61,1.1,3.75,4.5,4.5,5,5,"D/O: One of Russian River's signature wine barrel-aged wild ales, Supplication excels at finding the happy medium between the golden Temptation and the high gravity Consecration. While the former is overtly wine-affected and the latter is challenging for almost any palate, this is just right. It successfully captures the mood of an authentic Belgian Kriek, at times comparable to lambics and Flanders-style ales. It deserves to be held up as one of the superlative examples of why Russian River beer is so good.","beagle75","May 24, 2013"

I prefer this to Consecration and Sanctification, it's a bit more complex and has a better balance of tart and funk.

Dark red in appearance with incredible champagne-like bubbling that didn't stop. The bubbles felt great without being overpowering. The various yeasts combined to create a not-overpowering sour flavor mostly of cherries and wine grapes with some slight wood flavors from the Pinot barrels. Such an awesome beer. Having now tried a bunch of Russian River sours, this is still my favorite, although Consecration tastes very similar and is somewhat stronger.","falc0n2600","Feb 25, 2013"

Tons of sediment, but that is expected with the amount of yeast added. Smells of funky, sour cherries, oak, vinegar, grapes, lots of funkiness. Lots of dryness that really does give it a wine-like smell. Smells almost like a cherry warhead. Taste starts with a very astringent, dry, sour cherry flavor, as well as some oak and funkiness. Then get some of the brown ale qualities: slight breadiness, maybe some cocoa (but i could just be imagining that), some carmel malt. Then the astringent sour notes from the brett and bacteria come back even stronger, along with lots more cherry, grape, funkiness, vinegar, oak, some carmel. Extremely dry finish that blends the wine and the beer qualities nicely. So sour, yet extremely balanced. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very lively carbonation from the refermentation that does give it a very champagne-like crisp finish. Very complex and so delicious. Just getting into this style, but I have a feeling I won’t come across many sours better than this one. Hope to try this again someday.","brewskis","Feb 17, 2013"

I've now had almost all the RR sours/wilds now and while they differ in certain aspects they have all been nothing short of fantastic. It's like they have different sours to fit your different moods, much like there are types of wines (and the barrels they age these in). Is there a better brewery for this many quality American Wild Ales in the country? I think not.","matttttYCE","Dec 29, 2012"

This poured with a very thin head with little carbonated look. The color was cloudy, grainy, red and brown. I love the scent, it's tart and sour with a wine like aroma but a sweet cherry scent. After the initial shock of the tartness I became very comfortable and savor end the flavor. It was like an ale mixed with a red wine, which is very close to what it is.

4.97,9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"First of all, yes, I paid $18 for this beer, which I think is outrageous, but I always have to grab up Russian River beers when I see them. This beer poured a cloudy reddish-brown color with lots of active carbonation. The head was one finger and pure white and lingered around for awhile, although it didn’t leave much lacing on the glass. On the nose, there was a definite presence of cherries and funk. Minor notes on the nose included oak and a bit of red wine. Complexity much? On the first sip, the first thing I think is that this beer is crazy tart. It took me a few sips to get used to that. It also didn’t have as much funk as I thought it would. After I got used to that, there was definitely oak and cherries in the taste. The carbonation is definitely active and goes well with the brew, which is much lighter than I thought it would be. This brew almost reminds me of a red wine, which also could be because it was aged in Pinot Noir barrels. The finish lingers with tart cherries. Although this would not be a beer I could have every night, the complexity really makes it an amazing beer. I would have this again in a second.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"
4.55,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours copper hued than brown with a very good head and lace. The aroma has big funk and cherry notes with some earthy and dusty character, light notes of caramel and bready malts as well. The taste starts with tart cherries, soft oak undertone, and biting brett nature. The Pinot Noir does show, but only at the finish, along with some subdued spice. Bright and dry mouthfeel, very lambic in nature. Did not expect the sparkling texture from how she looked in the glass. Gorgeous.","stoutluvr420","Sep 16, 2012"

And there is a massive oak dryness, tannin, leather quality that distracts from the cherry and sour elements.

Smell is top-notch: red wine, cherries, oak and lactic sourness all are in there and combine together quite nicely and make my mouth water. Flavor follows the nose almost exactly, red wine and oak stand out at first, then we get a little bit of the sweet cherries in the middle before a blast of sourness hits on the back end. It's really quite complex and excellent. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with really nice carbonation with a great mouth-coating bite. Overall, this really proves that Russian River's year-round wilds are better than most of the other limited wilds out there. It's a great beer with a lot going on.","starrdogg","Jul 27, 2012"

The flavor was also excellent- with a nice amount of sourness and fruit flavors that were very well balanced. A little bit more age probably would have helped this a little bit- the 2009 Lou Pepe Kriek I had a couple weeks ago definitely had more flavor. Definitely not bad though. For a sour of this caliber that has been barrel aged for over a year, you can't beat the price on this one. A must try for sour fans.","jaasen64","Jun 29, 2012"

Poured to Duvel tulip the beer is a beautiful ruby amber with a thin white head, some retention, some lacing. Looks great for a beer aged 15 months in pinot barrels. The nose is even better, nice cherry, apple, pear fruit character mixes with with a mild brett funk, sour tartness. I don't know how this could be more inviting. The flavor is complex and perfect, really. Tart sourness at first that blends to a mild sour cherry to lightly bitter caramel with a light biscuity background. So much flavor, so much going on, it's amazing this comes together so well. Phenomenal. Good carbonation and medium to full bodied. Overall, this beer is classic. I think I am in love.

Aromas of huge tart cherries, green apple, grapes, pear, light vinegar, oak, red wine, hay, light spices, and a lot of funk. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity, Taste of big tart cherries, apple, grape, pear, red wine, citrus, oak, vinegar, spiciness, earthiness, hay, and funk. Lingering notes of tart fruit, oak, wine, and spices on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance of sourness and sweetness makes this very smooth on the palate. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and acidic mouthfeel. Slightly prickly carbonation, but still very smooth drinking.

Lacing is lovely. Nose is complex to say the least. Lots of fruity red wine funkiness backed by the bright clove/sweet bread of a good Belgian golden. On the tongue there’s a surprisingly pungent earthy sour wallop that gives way to a beautiful floral array of sweet complexities. There’s a lingering tart presence on the back of the palate. Sour cherries, of course. The feel is smooth and a bit dry I think. Wonderful. Overall, this is a sour that might even appeal to the non-sour beer drinker. Yum.","yamar68","Feb 21, 2012"

Nice small head that settles at the top of the glass and dissipates as you continue to drink. The taste is fruity and bold with hints of cherry, oak and red wine. The cherry taste is there and stays with the beer with every drink. It has become the sour on which I will judge every other sour on.","ProfessorX","Feb 15, 2012"

The beer itself is topped off with a thin off white head that quickly fades to a ring around the center. The aroma is subtle but complex, tobacco, plums, raisins, figs, tart cherries, and currants. The lactic aroma is more subtle then other RR beers. Peaking through the other aromas is a bit of funk, but not a pronounced amount of funk. The flavor is just as complex as the aroma, figs, plums, raisins and cherries with sour tones. The carbonation is at a minimum and the body is medium-light with a lingering sour finish. Excellent beer and something I would definitely seek out again.","jamescain","Jan 25, 2012"

4.47,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"pours out a murky reddish brown with a half finger of light brown head that fizzled out as quick as it formed. smell and taste are both very tart and sour. sour cherries lead the charge and are quickly followed up with flavors of wine and yeast, nice tart earthy taste. mouthfeel is very lively with excellent carbonation tickling the tongue. a medium weight body compliments this beer perfectly. a nice dry tart finish doesnt linger long. this is an excellent beer that everyone should have the opportunity to try.","match1112","Dec 31, 2011"
4.47,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - Just a fantastic beer and drinking experience. It's got the flavours found in a average sour but there is also a level of complexity that keeps it interesting throughout.

It pours a beautiful pinkish orange with a fizzy white head that disappears rather quickly. Very Tony bubbles of carbonation. It smells of sour cherry and musty yeast. Mild scent of oak is there as well. Wow... Very tart. I'm not really a big sour fan but I've had a few and have begun to appreciate the style. Lots of sour cherry and wine flavors. Mild oak flavors hang on the tongue. This is a palate scrubber. It will obliterate any beer you've had throughout the night. One of the better ones I've had. Very acidic and dry.

4.39,-3.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours out a semi murky brown tinged amber, no head, yet paradoxically has a semi spritzey carbonation as also typical in a great sour. The wine aroma really does come through on the nose, full of bold fruity sour cherry character on a base of tannic wood aroma, just about everything I want out of a sour nose all at once somehow delivered without being cloying or overwhelming at all. I think I may be seeing why this beer has developed such a cult following. Tastes of sour candied cherries and than everything I experienced within the nose coming at me just like clockwork in exactly the same order, only difference being that the pucker of the acidity fades out only to be replaced by the wood tones accentuated in the finish. Very much on the gentler (yet paradoxically also the drier) side of most wild ales that I have sampled as of this date. The body is medium thick and not as astringent as it could have been, job well done!","WastingFreetime","Nov 26, 2011"

It's amazing how the cherries persist throughout without being over the top like a lindeman's. The effervescence sends the beer across my tongue but dries out quickly to leave just a hint of cherries. This is an amazing beer: nuanced and tasty.","helmstreet","Nov 22, 2011"

Instead it is softer and presents its flavor profile a gentle touch. The flavors are defined and layered, and overall this is just a great beer.","allforbetterbeer","Nov 19, 2011"

I feel that this beer has a more sour aspect to it in the bottle and is more carbonated than when served on tap. One of my favorites so it's nice to always have this around in bottle and also to get it on tap for only 6.75 at the brewery. If you haven't had this beer make sure you try some.","bkrueger","Nov 16, 2011"

Supplication has a taste of of more cherries, sour apple, funk and some oak. The mouthfeel of it has some life to it, a very nice crispness. It really has a certain wine/champagne quality to it. This was another very good wild from RR. When I find myself in Philly, its` always a treat to try something from this brewery.","mltobin","Nov 16, 2011"

Nose is tart cherries, apple, and some sweet sugary notes. Taste is mix of tart cherry and sour apple with a little brown sugar in the mix. Never thought I would become a fan of sours, but the Allagash releases got me hooked, and this one takes the cake as my favorite thus far. Mouthfeel was smooth and not overly sour. Looking forward to trying some more sours from Russian River. Top notch.","ElGallo","Nov 01, 2011"
4.8,5.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Poured a crimson cherrywood color, with a creamy cap of off-white head that left a bit of streaky lacing on the tulip glass. The head dissipated mostly, but left a ubiquitous ringlet of delicate bubbles behind. Tart aroma, rich with various indistinct fruits, and classic Brett-ness; woody, with some nice funk. Incredibly complex taste: starts out tart and sour, with notes of cherries, cranberries, lemons!!! and white wine; mellows out mid-palate with a distinct mustiness that allows the woody characters to come out, then a fruity reprise in the end with dried cherries and dried pineapple, for a solid crisp finish. Not heavy in the mouthfeel, but definitely full on the palate. Beautifully crafted, and highly drinkable.","Rifugium","Oct 31, 2011"

Notes of red wine are present in the aroma, too and compliment the tartness nicely Big, but tame tartness with a decent acidic flavor. After letting this sit and stir for a while the sweeter notes come to the front. Dark cherries, diacetyl, hints of dry red wine. The carbonation definite helps the tartness of the brew, it makes it sharper. Noticeable notes of brett and diacetyl for a buttery, yet funky finish. The beer's medium body definitely helps your palate deal with the tartness and the acidity nicely so that you can enjoy the complexity rather than focus on how funky it is. Top notch.

Awesome looking Wild Ale. Wow. The nose is fantastic. Cherry, funk, some brown sugar, caramel, sourness, a hint of candy sweetness. Really complex and nice. Opens up really nicely with warming/airing out. Now... on to the taste. Pretty much the same as the nose, minus the candy sweetness. It's really not too sour, just about right. It seems like the taste just keeps evolving the more you get into it. Definitely some wine/oak/vinegar in the taste as well. None of the 7% ABV is evident at all.

Nose expresses tart cherries, a buttery quality and a trace of American Oak. Cherry is much more muted in the flavor profile. There is also a vinegary and citrus character dispersed throughout. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a bright, lively carbonation, some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands and a semi-dry finish.

4.27,-6.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy brown with some slight burgandy tints and nice foamy throughout the session. A lot of floaties but good. Nice funk in the aroma with some cherries, raspberries and wine-like whiffs. Nice. Tough on the esophogus after each sip for me....right to the finish. Tart but not overly distracting. Some cherries and more tart fruit in the taste. Nice. Dry and clean finish. Salivation on the buds after each sip. Overall I thought this was a great wild ale and a great starter if someone is looking to try the style. Not overly sour and pleasant to sip.","kaseydad","Jul 12, 2011"
3.93,-13.8,5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: With the mythical proportions that Russian River has ascended to, I guess I set the bar too high and ended up disappointed. All of this gibberish about this brew proving beer had no limits and is an American national treasure overhyped this to an absurd level. Sure it was a good beer, but it is not the second coming of Christ in beer form like a lot of people on BA seem to believe. It also doesn't help that this beer cost $12 (american). I will say try it if you're feeling indulgent, but don't invest in the hype.","Kubus","Jul 10, 2011"
4.18,-8.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O- Russian River has cemented it's reputation as one of the best (if not the best) producer of American wild ales, period. I tried not to judge this brew against my preferred vehicle of sour beers (Flanders Reds) and consider it within the parameters of its style. Personal preference aside, this was a masterfully brewed beer that is positively bursting with originality and flavor.","gigaknight","Jul 10, 2011"
4.8,5.3,5,5,4.5,5,5,"Overall - Oh where have you been all my life. Now, I have a ways to go in terms of Wilds, Lambics, and Guezes. I have had several in my time. I still need to try all sorts of beers yet to qualify as some sort of sour expert. However, with that written, I must state this plainly as I can. This is the best Wild Ale I have ever had and one of the top 5 beers I have ever had.","TheMurse","Jul 09, 2011"

4.25,-6.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I felt this beer was going to be a challenge for me to get down. Since I'm not a big fan of sour ales if this wasn't a Russian River brew I probably would have just overlooked it. The beer poured out as a sparkling red color with some in there too. The head was fizzy and white and then vanished pretty quickly. The smell of this beer was big, it's stung the nostrils like sex panther a little bit. The smell of tart cherries and oak wood mixed with a big amount of wild yeast explode on nose. The taste of the beer is interesting too, The sour cherries almost make your lips pucker, the sour subsides and leaves you with a nice oak and vanilla smoothness. The mouthfeel is little thin, but has enough flavor to balance out the whole thing. Overall it's a good sour beer, I'm trying to give it praise despite the fact I don't care for the style. I feel that people who enjoy these will definitely enjoy this one too.","Knapp85","Jul 05, 2011"

4.47,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - a superb sour. I can pick out the cherries and the pinot noir barrel aging fairly easily. It's not as funky as some others, which is fine because the flavors are very well balanced. Definitely seek out RR beers if you can.","HotHands","Jul 01, 2011"
4.5,-1.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O- This is an amazing sour, absolutely surpassed my expectations, out of all the “tions” from Russian River that I’ve tried this takes the cake, now to hunt down some more bottles.","Chriscrundwell12","Jul 01, 2011"
4.65,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours bright brown with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the surface. Visible carbonation. Smell is yeasty. Big cherries. Taste has a big hit of tartness up front. Balanced with just a touch of background sweetness. Sour cherries are very noticeable but don't totally dominate the flavor. Puckering tartness ends with a dry hit of bitterness. Tons of flavors all over the place. Oak. A bit of herbal hops. Lots of barnyard yeastiness. The wild strains are obvious, although it's hard for me to describe the flavors they contribute (except for some sourness) since I've had very few wild beers. Great well carbonated mouthfeel. Full to medium bodied. Crisp with a lip smacking tart and dryish finish. Great tart and slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this is pretty great stuff. I paid a lot for it but I'm definitely glad I tried it and will check out the rest of their wild ales if I can find them.","burnstar","Jun 28, 2011"
4.77,4.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall: This is a very well-made beer that I'd like to have more of if the price was right. Most of the elements in this beer tend to balance themselves out so that nothing is particularly overwhelming except that the sourness is always there. It does deserve to be priced higher than many other beers - considering the effort put into it. Any sour lover could hardly do better than this one. It's worth the effort to obtain one and I look forward to it's next arrival in Philly.","meatyard","Jun 25, 2011"

5,9.6,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer continues to impress me and it is my favorite. Some time in the bottle really does magic to this. Another pop from the cork, suppy is a brownish red with some orange up towards the light. A cream colored shell of foam stays on top throughout with nice sheets that stick. Smell is straight out lacto with sour cherry at this point. Pungent with leather and I guess you can say malt from the base. A bretty sting with some warming. The cherry has not left, it only got more aggressive. Taste is just oh my god, I love this beer. Cherry flavor with sourness that knocks socks off. I gotta say, Sup does wonders in the bottle if you have a good batch of it and give it some time in a OK enviornment. Sometimes, warm is your friend. Lacto soaked cherry with pedio/sach/brett in that order, no fooling. Supp Vs Sanct, you can tell the difference, especially in the newer Sanct versions with all brett, lacto shines here. Im babbling. All I can say is lay these suckers down if you got em, they will sour till your hearts delight, much more than the batch 4 Temptation which I think is dwindling. I love it.","BARFLYB","Jun 23, 2011"
4.22,-7.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Hazy soft rose color with a whitish head. This beer gave much sour cherry and an oaky woodiness in the nose with lesser amounts of green apple and horse blanket. Quite intriguing and inviting. Less cherry in the flavor, but this gave way to other fruits... maybe a touch of apricot, more apple, and a light berry tartness. Bubbly carbonation lifted the light body. A fine beer indeed. Paired nicely with blue types of cheese.","DmanGTR","Jun 22, 2011"
4.65,2,4,4,5,4.5,5,"Hazy deep orange color. Wonderfully tart aroma of sour cherry and funk. Sour cherry flavors and slight oakiness come out as it warms. Sour finish that lingers on the tongue.

The wood does this brew a real honor by taking would could be seen as too bretty/tart/sweet, and making it a refined offering. All the flavors are in check, but they aren't exactly conservative either. I'd love to hear what a master's palate would say of this one, because I think there's far more in there than a laymen can give credit for. I'd come back to this one after more "education".","Cavery","Jun 21, 2011"

4.28,-6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Supplication pours a rose color with a bit of head retention and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is slightly sour with a nice fruity cherry note, as it warms, a very distinct wine and funky side emerges. The taste has the cherries and a mild mild oak wine presence which is a nice counterpoint to the cherries and tartness, with the same character emerging as the beer warms. This beer is extremely light and refreshing and complex. Very enjoyable beer, especially for the summer. Very light and very well carbonated with a nice bite. Have not quite gotten into sours, but this is a very good beer to get going with.","Agold","Jun 16, 2011"

4.22,-7.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slight hazy reddish brown into the glass with bright Red highlights. Aromas of tart cherry and dark fruit and oak. Flavor is a burst of intense but smooth sourness delivered nicely with the carbonation with a bit of fruitiness and faint oak. Very soft malt flavors stay on the tongue as it dries out on the finish. Not my "Style" of beer, but starting to intrigue me more and more. Just like 2IPA's did a couple of yrs. ago, now they are 1 of my favorite styles.

4.57,0.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"While I don't like having to struggle with the cork, it is a minor inconvenience when it comes to drinking this nectar. Pour resulted in a two finger head of foam with just a little sediment. I guess I should have poured it a bit slower. Nice lace that clings well from beginning to end. Color is a slightly hazy 9 on the SRM beer color chart. I think I am the fault of most of the haze. Smell is a rich complex palate of wonderful aromas. Sweet tree fruit smells, pear, apple, and cherry. Tart smells of mint leaf, and anise. Taste is a grand mixture of pleasing flavors of cherry, caramel, grapefruit, sour red grapes, anise, malt, and a hint of wood. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, much like butter melting in your mouth with zing added for effect. I would like another, but my wallet would scream and so would my head from the rush of alcohol.","beerprovedwright","Jun 07, 2011"
4.25,-6.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - An excellent beer that really show off the potential for non traditional sour beer matured in barrels. Nothing is wasted or excessive here; the cherry contributes a great deal of complexity while the wine barrel aging is a background note that briefly pops out as a distinctive, vinous character in the finish. The sourness and bone dry finish both work to enhance the drinkability of an already very quaffable beer.","nickfl","Jun 06, 2011"

But it's not over the top sour. It's basically the most balanced sour I've ever tasted. This is only one of a few sours that I would completely feel comfortable (and excited) about drinking pint after pint. Seriously, I would drink multiple pints of this in a row! I love this beer!","sdderek","May 31, 2011"
4.3,-5.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a rich, brownish amber in color, very reminiscent of cherry wood. It featured a nice cream colored head which laces the glass and sticks to the sides. The aromas consist of primarily sour cherry with a light grape like sweetness. It has a good amount of funk but it's hard to tell which is winning, the cherry or the funk. I'm glad the sweetness is allowed to show past the cherry. The flavors are very sour and dry. You definitely get a boatload of cherry, oak, and nice funk. The tartness is in your face initially before letting the other flavors take place. The most impressive aspect is how the flavor resonates even five minutes later. It leaves behind a really, really nice aftertaste of all of the flavors meshed together in perfect harmony. Overall this is a very, very good wild and I definitely prefer it over Consecration.","aasher","May 31, 2011"

Carbonation was great for this beer. I wish there was a bit more bite in the flavor. Don't know why i'm hatin', it was delicious, just could have used a little more bite or intensity to set it over the top. Overall, this was one of the best brews of the day. Thanks again chuck!

The aromas are very cool, lots of funk and sour fruit. The taste is decadent, very mellow with active bubbles that fizz on first contact with the tongue. Quickly the onset of sour cherry and orange peel take over with a very complex finish that leaves a lasting and changing funk in your mouth. Nice acidity, not overpowering, very well crafted sour.","Tripphop","May 05, 2011"

Some errant sour juice dribbles from the guard's mouth, but Kiwis weren't fit to guard a hostile embassy. He was hired as a young tart currant, trained in the most hostile vineyards, and was raised a pedigree in solitude for 15 months. Only this sour aging could create an agent of such brackish authority, such swiftly petulany candor, bitterly imparting a smooth sourness to the political fruit world. He rounds the foyer of the Tropicanaria, resolute to steal the famed cherry pit of Largesse. A hardened fruit son of a bitch, but with a slippery smoothe discountenance, lovable, yet stern in his demeanor.

Describing the sour flavor is more difficult. I'm not getting much of an acetic vibe here, the pungence is more easily ascribed to whitish grapefruit rind without the bitters.

Nose is big and soft, lots of vinous type notes. Cherries are still vibrant in this one. Funky, oaty, lactic acid, oak, vinegar, tart cherries, wild yeast, and sour nose. On taste, this is how to do a cherry sour. Softened acidity. The oak comes across to prop up the cherry notes. Medium body with some graininess and some sharp, but soft carbonation.

I was put of at first and thought I was getting set up for a big disapointment. Once I got into it a little bit sweet cherries reveal themselves as an overtone to the aroma with a nice balance of oak and bret funk. It finishes with a slightly tart vinegar aroma to it. World class flavor on this. Cherries right up front; being slightly tart and a bit of sweetness to finish it out. Woody oak notes surround the pallet here.

This beer pours a nice copper amber color with a frothy white foam that degrades to a thin layer but stays that thin layer throughout the consuming of this beer. This beer has the funk that is so sought after in many of the sours that I know. There is a citrus sour that comes from all sorts of bacteria. There is some cherry notes on the nose as well with some pretty decent oak notes. The taste is sour, oh so sour. The tartness of the intentional infection is not something that I know if I'm ever gonna get used to, I've really probably got to work my way up to appreciating these beers. The tart mouthfeel goes down pretty easy, it's got good carbonation for the style, and it's pretty easy to drink if I do say so. Again, it's not my style, but then again I never respected hop bombs, so maybe the time will come for me to revisit this beer.","Vdubb86","Jan 26, 2011"

While this one did carry a slightly different flavor and aroma there really wasn't a huge difference between the two batches I've reviewed.

The mild pie-like cherry flavor is sweet and acidic at the same time giving a mildly astringent effect on the palate w/ a bit of bitterness from the hops but only slight and the oak gives a mild olive like bitter oily element to the fruity sour in the flavor. There is mild hop spice to accent all the oak and berry complexity. This is a fantastic wild ale, so surpremely drinkable which as Chris Lively said, Vinnie attempted a flavor akin to aged Orval, and he definitely achieved that.

I was expecting a really bracingly tart beer having had my fair share of berlinner-weissbiers but this was surprisingly toned and balanced. The heaviness of the alcohol goes well to balance out the tartness of the souring bacteria. cherry and yeast are noticeable but are all welcome and quite gorgeously done. For a brett beer I detected no barnyard funk or anything like that, it was just beautifully pleasant and earthy. The aging in pinot barrels brings out some trace wine-like flavors. This really is a beautiful beer, it's not bracingly sour as I was expecting but it's so balanced between sour, and the alcohol and just everything it truly is a wonderful beer.","digkv","Oct 15, 2010"

The flavor profile replicates the nose for the most part, except I'm getting a bit more wine vinegar and sour funk. The sour component definitely dominates the flavor profile, though it's not so over the top as to be unenjoyable. This beer is hugely flavorful with no more than a medium bodied mouthfeel, and the finish is long, winey and sour. This beer has almost an electric component to the flavor profile, at least that's how the sour hits me on the finish. Drinkability is pretty good, with the alcohol nearly unnoticeable. Am not a huge fan of sours beers, but this is pretty fun to drink (though I can't imagine drinking a whole lot of it).

The aroma had a far subtler sour presence compared to the Consecration. The same could be said for the taste also. While the Consecration felt like an attack on your tastebuds, the Supplication was less intense while still having a very pleasant sour, fruity flavor. I don't know enough about the process to tell whether the main difference is the Cab vs. Pino barrel, but when having both at the same time it's very obvious which is which. I could see myself drinking quite a few of these (that is if I could afford it) since it is more mellow and doesn't leave your tastebuds totally exhausted by the end.

Sour cherries was the most upfront aroma, some grapes and yeast were also present. I love smelling a beer and already knowing that it's going to be something special. Tasted very similar, lots of sour cherry wang. It's rather sweet at first, every now and then some bitterness came through on the back of the tongue. All sorts of funk going on here, a joy to sit and sip. The carbonation kept things exciting but I didn't find it to be as bubbly as I had expected, still very crisp and light on the tongue.

The nose is good, but missing some of the elements I would expect from a beer like this. I get tons of funk and tartness from the bacteria, but nothing to speak of really in the way of cherries or oak. Not to worry though as those flavors make themselves known as soon as I sip Supplication. A hint of malty sweetness from the brown ale base, along with the cherries leads off. Oak then makes a brief, but nice appearance, before the beer finishes with the handiwork of the brett and bugs. The body of the beer is nice and light, but I feel like the carbonation could be just a little bit higher. So delicious that it's one of the most drinkable wilds I've ever had, but the tartness lingers just long enough to keep me from scoring a 5.

It is nice that the sourness stays with you all the way through the bottle rather than the palate adjusting after a few sips like some other sours I have had. Brett presence is deep and rich and actually fights the lacto to a draw, both are heavy hitters. Tart cherries play an integral role as well. Yeast addition softens the flavors some at the end of the bottle and it is a sad moment indeed when the last few drops of a Supplication drain from the lip of the bottle. Fantastic brew!

Smells of wood, red grapes, some spice, cherries, and definitely a funky brett smell. Taste is much like the nose but now I can pick up on raspberries and the vinegar cuts through, in a very pleasant way. The sourness is mouthwatering and refreshing, not burning or overly drying. Nice and sweet but nicely sour too, ends pretty cleanly but still has a faint lingering grain taste, but more noticeable in the slight aftertaste are the sour cherries. Wonderful carbonation and coating round out the dry and tart body. Incredibly delicious and enjoyable, though I could see how having much more would be troublesome for a person's stomach or tongue.

The nose is up front about its bretty sourness, feeling it better to be open with us than try to hide its true feelings. I can respect that. Some tart berries, oak, light vanilla bean, and caramel corn occasionally bubble to the surface as well, but it's always the bretty-ness that looms over them all, all cocky and whatnot. The taste follows this template, with the sourness rocking my tongue fore to aft without much mercy. The brute. The berries return, along with some decidedly sour cherries, some oak, and a touch of butter somewhere behind the wall of bretty fog. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and an almost sticky feel.

As my review above states, this is a fine tasting beer and I'd gladly have it again but bluntly if this is the flavor I am craving, I'd rather have a nice glass of Rioja or Cotes du Rhone than this (which, by the way, is equally if not more costly).","appenzeller","Jul 25, 2010"

It has beautiful bouquet with fresh cherry and grape notes with toasted oak, barnyard and sharp acid. The taste was very much wine like with an interesting combination of both fresh and aged character, there was low apparent bitterness that seemed to get lost in the tartness, but that was enough to just provide balance.. The grape and cherry fruit flavors dominate this beer, with the bret and wild character providing a background of interest.

The cherries are really sublime, though the oak offers an earthiness that does well to balance it out enough that I don't want to call this a lambic. As I sip, I notice the froth is retaining and lacing the glass ... which is always something I like to take note of.

Aroma is of musty basement and damp earthy oak first and then more of a barrel oak aroma followed by the presence of cherries. This beer has a great malty profile which is accented by masterful barrel aging. The flavor from the oak aging frames the cherry flavor very well, not in the way a kriek tastes but in the unique american style. As this beer breaths it becomes a bit more sour and leaves your palate cleanly and dryly. Supplication has great mouthfeel, perfect bottle conditioning. This beer is all about balance.

The liquid is noticeably clear, an orange tinged brown, some loss of hue around the rims, plenty of active bubbles visible within. The sour cherry scents explode in your nostrils, evoke cranberry and pomegranate as well, sour lemons but golden honey too, horsehide, lees, drying chunks of rye bread and oats, rosemary and other garden herbs, with all of the barnyard floor and animality, the pureness of the cherry outlasts all the rest. Medium-bodied with a very strong foaminess, this almost necessary to help you palate acclimate to the unrelenting sourness of the cherry fruit. Yeast, lees, tar and a Sherry-like nuttiness fill in many of the open spaces. Very dry, one of the drier beers consumed in memory. As mouth yields to it, more raspberry, nectarine and lemon zest flavors appear. Hard to track any change as it warms, so pervasive is the sourness.

Nose is a fruity sourness that is somewhat reminescent of oranges. Taste is tart, funky, sour and includes a bit of the previously hinted fruitiness. Light bodied and highly carbonated it has quite a dry finish. As it warms my palate becomes increasingly perplexed as I pick up on tastes of funky must coupled with dry fruits nearly apple-like but sour like a green apple candy. Brett is apparent in both smell and taste without being dominating. Each sip is so drying and puckering that it is hard to stop, put down the glass and stop salivating. This is a very interesting beverage that I found enjoyable and another example of a style I'm not quite familiar with but really enjoy and look forward to trying more.","stakem","Apr 20, 2010"

This beer pours a lovely dark mahogany with a slightly tan head that sticks around in clumps and leaves wonderful lace. Surprising that it is not more carbonated given the fact that it was a gusher. The aroma is quite nice and full of sour cherries, vinegar, Funk and earthiness. Taste is very sour and very delicious. Puckering and complex. Pinot noir, tart cherry, woodiness, some wine like tannins, lemon like citrus... there is just so much going on. More vinegar than lactic acid, but both come into play. There is some alcoholic warmth in there as well, and it plays off the other flavors. The finish is long, super tart and slightly sticky. Mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty refreshing and drinkable, but this is one to savor. A fine sour from an amazing brewery.","zoso1967","Apr 14, 2010"

The cherries taste just as natural as if I had picked them from the tree myself, and the wood from the oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity to the flavor that's just right.

I have had a decent amount of sours but nothing that remotely compared to this one. I think I may become addicted to sours in the next months just because I have always enjoyed very sour foods. Anyways... Served in a large flute like glass. Pours like wine with not much head or lace but a pretty awesome looking orange-copper color. The smell is nice. The lambic-like sour/funk notes are there with oak and cherries. Wine notes come through and also grapes. This balance became more evident as the beer warmed up and I fell in love with it. The taste of this beer was the real life changer for me. Very smooth. Starts out with an absolutely fantastic amount of sour fruits. The wine notes hit me soon after. The aftertaste is what really killed me, out of this world. From the time I swallowed the beer to a few minutes after the taste of cherries just grew on my tongue. Eventually it just tasted like a mouthful of fresh cherries (mind you there hasn't been beer in my mouth for a minute now). The oak and grape notes only add to a flavor that really needs no assistance. God.. the cherries are so good. Mouthfeel is suitable and enhances the beer for me. The body is moderate and nice and creamy. The sour makes my cheeks pinch but I like it. A coat of fruit sour, grapes and cherries stays on the tongue for a long, long time. Do I have to explain the Drinkability? The taste was perfect for the whole glass, the price was great. I will never view sour beers the same after this and will have a new standard to judge them to. I can only hope to have this beer again sometime in my life.","cbutova","Mar 21, 2010"

Very, very delicious beer. I felt like I was flying through this beer so I had to slow myself down to really enjoy it. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. The carbonation is spot on and it has a sort of champagne quality that coast your tongue. Drinkability is off the charts in my opinion. Feel like I could sip on this all day long.

The aroma also has a sweetness that i want to associate with malt but with a creamy vanilla note that i sense may be from the barrel aging. Full flavored, the tart cherry character is intense without being offensive and in fact is exceptional. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel finishes clean and dry.

The aromas were noticed immediately after popping the top. Lots of cherries make up the sweetness that dominated the nose. Some grapes are also noticed most likely from the wine barrels that are used during the aging. After allowing the brew to warm up from the 45 degree fridge shelf the first quaff was taken. The mouth is not nearly as sweet as the nose with a very balanced sour tartness. Not a lip smacker like some sour ales can be. Again, lots of cherries are tasted up front. Other fruits that make up the quaff are pinot noir grapes and plums. The brett also come through with the quaff which is expected. Mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated, much like a champagne.

Smell and taste were almost identical for me... tart cherries, with just a hint of sweetness. I felt this beer was perfectly carbonated, dry like a champagne and incredibly easy to drink. The bar listed it at 9% abv, though it's listed differently here, either way, it was a beer where the alcohol creeps up on you so beware! I had read that the beer is barrel aged, but I didn't really get "barrel" flavors as you might with some other B.A. beers. Another home run from Russian River.","thedindaniel","Jan 31, 2010"

Lots of spur dark cherrry, vinous grape, raisin and plum. The tart curries really come through and make this beer amazing well balanced and quaffable. The ABV is nearly undetectable and there is a slightly vinegary Pickering aftertaste that leaves me salivating for another gulp. I love this damn beer and am so excited to try it on tap.

Effervescent mouthfeel gives it a light feel. Mouth-puckering tartness right away. Lemony citric bite along with the bretty funk. A vinuous tanginess follows as does the oak and cherry flavors. Definitely a success in terms of aging in that it tones down the sometimes harsh vinegar and cheese flavors. They are present, but in far less degree so the quality of the beer itself comes through.

Nose is invigoratingly tart with notes of sour cherries, electric funk, and grape skin. With another sniff you get some woodsy alcohol. Immediately attacks the tongue with yeasty barnyard sour funk. The cherries bring about a nice tongue glazing tartness. Yeasty and almost creamy on the back of the tongue. Oak really comes through as you continue to drink.

Taste- sublime lacto sourness, citric zing, and green apples. Very dry, earthy and woody finish. This brew has dried out quite a bit since the last time I've had one.

Makes my checks tingle. Tastes like it smells: apples and white wine. I can defiantly taste the malts too. The oak barrels definitely help bring all the flavors together. Plenty of balancing hops that increases the viscosity of my saliva. Mouth feel is light with lots of carbonation. If you let it wonder, you can feel the bubbles form all over your tongue and mouth. Drinkability is better than most wine/beers. I think the aging in oak barrels have contributed to the drinkablilty.","BeerStine","Feb 16, 2009"

Poured in to a wide mouthed wine glass a strawberry color, with a very nice, sizable white head show. Aroma is wonderfully funky, with those micro bacteria showing themselves early on. Lemon juice, sour cherry, vinegar, and a slight dry champaign character are in there too. Taste hits the palate with a wave of sour funk, tart fruit, and a lovely, almost spicy feel. Carbonation is just right, giving it even more of a champaign feel. This is one to let warm up a bit as well, as many more complexities push themselves forward. Drinkability is quite good for this style, as the carbonation helps things out. For me, this resembles a Cantillon beer, which is very impressive, because their beers are so complex. I would say that if anyone wants to get an idea of what this beer tastes like, to grab some Cantillon, assuming that it is available in your area. This is an exceptional wild ale.

Cherry flavors are lean and subtle, but add some red fruit acidity. Mouthfeel is medium/light and a bit creamy. Complexities evolve as it warms, leaning toward juicier red fruit towards the end, with some semi dry sherry flavors. Finish is creamy and dry. Very very nice.

The finish has notes of a tannic woodiness, plus a long sour note that lingers along with the woodiness. This beer certainly reminds me of cherries, with a nice fruitiness to it. The more I drink it the more I become enamored of this beer, an authentic Flemish style sour beer that has not been pasteurized.

4.7,3.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle purchased at Union Jack's in Glenside, PA. Poured ruby read with a touch of brown. Small, quickly disappating head. Thin lacing. Slightly cloudy. Smells of cherries, pungently. Some alcohol on the nose too. Taste is of tart cherries with an earthy sweetness below. Sour, puckeringly delicious malt. As it warms, the cherries soften, or at least become less tart, and some oak and more sour malt come through wonderfully. The finish has some hints of vanilla, which add more depth to the overall flavor. Medium bodied and somewhat sticky. A nice-drinking wild ale that demands to be savored. So many subtle flavors and odors make every sip a treat. A wonderous beer creation.","aforbes10","Nov 28, 2007"

Taste starts out mild then BAM, huge rush of tarty goodness. You want to pucker its so sour. Finally mellows out with the oak and cherry peaking through. Medium in the mouth and a tickle of either carbonation or the tartness giving its finishing move. You want to sip this because larger samplings at a time would be a waste.

Poured a beautiful reddish orange with brownish highlights, that was quite hazy. About a finger of loose, bubbly tan head sat atop the brew. Had faded pretty quickly and left little lace. Smell is of sour cherries, red wine, and some pretty wild yeast/bacteria aromas. Had a nice yeasty, sour cherry, red wine flavor that was quite tart. Also wood and bacteria like flavors.

Stickiness isn't there at all. Smell is sour cherries, nuts, red wine, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is sour/acidic (but enjoyable) cherries, sounds pathetic but reminds me of a sour patch kid. Sweet and sour go back and forth fight each other on the tongue and in the end the sour seems to win the battle. Do I need to mention the Brett's? Well, I did...even though with any RR Wild Ale it's already a given. Beginning; sour. Middle; red wine. End; green apple. Such a complex brew, I'm sure I missed a crapload of flavors but these are the ones that stuck out to me. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a whole lotta carbonation. Crisp and bitter. Drinkability is pretty damn good. I took my time with it not because it was difficult to put down, but just because I wanted to get every flavor out of it I could. I look forward to the bottle of Sanctification I brought back from the brewery this summer. Russian River raises the bar with Supplication.

Certainly there are many characteristics related to a Saison, more so than Temptation even I think, but it's truly an experience, and I really hope more folks start to experiment with the style in the future.

4.72,3.5,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Batch 002. Poured well-chilled into a Russian River Barrel Aged Ales stemmed glass, Supplication is a striking ruby and amber color -- like the blood orange Italian soda my partner brought home the other day -- hazy with a thin but persistent pinkish-grey head. Sour citric aromas (lime, kumquat, orange zest) mingle with a sharp bretty funk, some rubbery phenolic business, and a dusty attic floor scent. Mind-bogglingly complex, to say the least, and incredibly mouth-watering as well. Make that mouth-puckering. This is unbelievably sour, with an acidity that rivals the strength of Cantillon gueuze but retains a fruity zing that is entirely its own. There are slight cherry notes, along with an unripened raspberry twinge. The cherry flavor rapidly emerges to the fore with every degree warmer this beer gets. Mellow wood grain inflections. Tannic grapeskin in the aftertaste. Juicy mouthfeel up front due to the fruit flavors, but extremely dessicating from mid-sip onward to the cottonmouth-inducing finish. An amazing creation overall, and an exceptional beer with which to celebrate the arrival of warmer weather.","orfeu","Apr 19, 2007"

It smelled somewhat like a lambic, and it had a similar sourness to it, though I could certainly taste the aging in the Pinot Noir wine barrels...though the alcohol was only slightly present in the taste, it more so affected the mouthfeel adding a little warmth to it. Overall, it was a very distinct experience from tasting a lambic and I highly recommend it to anyone.

Initial glass-covering large bubbled carbonation gives way to a narrow pillar of fine bubbles. Vibrant aromas of brett, cherry pits and tart skin, some damp wood. Simultaneously sweet and just a touch sour and funky. The taste starts with a nice tart sharpness that is filled with a dry cherry-laced sweetness. The underlying brown ale is readily discernable and serves as a solid base. Some damp wood becomes evident during consumption. The brett character is long in the finish and is complimented by a bit of sourness in the tail end. As it warms, the sweetness comes up a touch. Medium body with barely detectable carbonation, the light sharpness reduces the body a bit. There is a light slickness that glazes the tongue.

Sour, musty funky cherry aroma, but there's also a very earthy rotted pumpkin thing going on here. Innnteresting. Flavors meld beautifully; upfront tartness yields to woody birch bark flavors, followed swiftly (as this is all too quaffable) by the lingering mildly sour cherry vanilla notes. Carbonation is noticeable on the palate, yet somehow has a creamy, lactic milk-like feel that I've never tasted. Usually it's one or the other; this is well carbonated and strangely creamy. What the? Can there be a creativity rating? This gets 5's there. Extremely unique, tasty, complex and worth seeking out.","IrishRedRock","Jun 02, 2006"

Good looker. Nose is excellent, with moderate sourness, with a very solid backing of cherry. Its not biting, but very inviting. Almost a touch of acetone-like aromas that I associate with sour browns. Flavor is very nice, mildly sour, moving towards a very smooth cherry fruityness, finishing with a light tartness. Aftertaste is very solid sour cherry that lingers well in to the finish, enticing me to drink more and more of this beer. Very nice balance between fruit flavor and sour tinge. A mild sourness hangs on the sides of my tongue into the finish as well. Very excellent. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It doesn't interfere with the flavor while having enough carbonation to make it lively. Drinkability is awesome. No hint of the alcohol at all in this one. Its smooth and enjoyable while having a prominent sour character. The fruityness is excellent, and compliments the base beer excellently. Well worth the wait.","kmpitz2","Apr 19, 2006"

4.7,3.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Bought this bottle (375 mL, olive green, batch 001) a month or two ago and finally mustered up the will to open it - which I had a hard time doing as the cork was a bit stubborn. I served it just below cellar temperature in a flute/goblet type glass I've got. It pours a beautiful hazed golden/orange/peach color with lots of carbonation and 2 fingers of tan head which consists of small bubbles and reduces to a half-inch, sticking to the glass throughout. It smells sharply tart with sweet and sour cherries, not-quite-fresh milk, oak, a good funkiness, and grapes, currants and blackberries which show up later. It's really making my mouth water wondering how it's gonna taste. It is sour/tart, but not as powerful as I thought it was going to be. There's also some malts, sour cherries, oak, the fruits I mentioned above, and some medicinal and vinous qualities. The pinot noir barrels in which it was aged contribute mainly to the aftertaste, which has grapes, blackberries, and currants, and a dry, woody coating effect similar to the few pinots I've tried. Initially the body is sharp and dry with a carbonation that is high but not prickly and it evolves from being light and airy to medium and smoother. Quite an interesting beer, and one that tastes like a gueuze mixed with a pinot noir. Hats off to Russian River for attempting such a mysterious creation. My only complaint, as others have noted, is that the bottle is too damn small, but other than that, keep up the good work.","mmmbeer","Mar 08, 2006"

Flavors of dark cherry and light spice and oak. The flavoring does not linger too long though. The finish is extremely dry and feels like it is sucking the moisture from your tongue as you drink it.

Taste has a clear sour cherries feel to it with some distinctive note of acidity and oak. Tartness was delectable but could have been more present. Even though this is an excellent Flemish sour, I though it could have had more tart and more complexity in general (i.e. De Dolle Oerbier Reserva). Id definitely take more RR Temptation over this any day.","Phyl21ca","Jan 16, 2006"

The smell was that of a tart lambic with note of toasted oak. The yeast in the aroma was somewhat remeniscent of Orval. The flavor was full of tart cherries, oak, and chardonnay. The malt fills out the flavor and provides a medium mouthfeel. Considering this beer is 7% ABV, it's amazingly smooth - very drinkable. The carbonation is tight and compliments this beer's punch. Highly recommended if you can score a bottle. I recently went to Russian River Brewing and sampled 6 different Belgian beers on tap. All were excellent, but Supplication was notably different and much more complex than those on tap.","SacoDeToro","Jan 06, 2006"

A tiny bit of spicy alcohol shows through but other than that it is well hidden. The sourness is mild in this brew compared to most of the Belgian lambics I've had, but the cherry taste seems to come out more, along with a vinous character.

Spiciness abounds-somewhat peppery though NOWHERE near as "hot" spice-wise as Catillion's Rose d Gambrinus, which I liken this to. The tart/sweet combo is amazing. Great body. Quite amazing.

Lighter notes of cherries and other lighter fruits appear at times as well. Flavor is equally complex with a big tartness and a smaller balancing sweetness coming on strongest. Plenty of interesting yeast things going on including the brett funkiness. Oak notes and sour cherries play into it as well. Some vinous notes at times. Dry sourness on the aftertaste.

It had tremendous layers of flavors with an easy to approach funkiness and tartness allowing the cherries to balance this complexity and hold it together. As it warms and your palate starts to love the tartness, the buttery oakiness adds yet another layer of flavor and the cherry flavors come forward beautifully.

4.4,-3.5,4,4,4.5,4,5,"for a beer, this is something else. leaps and bounds beyond the flemish wild ales, but just a tad bit less crazy than the hype will lead you to believe.","goodbyeohio","Jul 04, 2005"

4.85,6.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Dark orangeish/red with a nice head of light beige/tan foam that dies kind of quickly, but is easily revitalized by swirling my oversized wine glass. Some lace is present as well and it is quite sticky and leaves some interesting patterns. The aromas are all brett, lacto, and sour cherry/oaky funk. Beautiful. The taste is a beautiful blend of funk, oak, cherries, acidic notes, and more. The mouthfeel is super creamy, smooth, and this beautiful brew just slides down ones throat. Drinkability is perfect as well. This is similar yet different than Alexander Rodenbach, but man this stuff is probably better! Just a brilliant Flemish red sort of hybrid oaky cherry brew.","francisweizen","Jun 01, 2005"
4.82,5.7,4,4.5,5,5,5,"One more note. Im hesitant to send in a change of style request since I am certainly no expert on Belgian sour ales, but the big malt here makes me think that this is more of a brown (Oud Bruin) than a red. However, this is aged in oak (old pinot noir barrels), so who knows.","RoyalT","Mar 07, 2005"
