"D: aged well. Wish there was more Brett and farm funk. If you still have any drink up, I don't see this getting any better."

"When I found this beer in my cellar last week I was surprised and concerned, wondering how I'd manage to lose track of it and hoping it had held up well. As I continue to pour more into my glass, I'm delighted at how delicious this is. Wish I had another!"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in March 2008. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 3 finger foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lightly tart apple, pear, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, earth, hay, bread, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, pepper, clove, earth, funk, bread, herbal, hay, grass, leather, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, earth, bread, funk, hay, grass, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of flavors; with a nice malt and peppery flavor balance with good brett character; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, prickly, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent brett saison! Nice amount of flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on for an 8% brew. Really enjoyed this one."

"Overall. We started out so good!!! Oh well, I'll still drink the whole bottle."

"Unfortunately, i cant help but compare it to orval, and in that light, it falls short. Good beer."
""
"The beer pours a hazy orange-brown color with a white head. The aroma is full of toffee and orange citrus, with some brett thrown in for good measure. The flavor is similar, with a few additions. I get some nice toffee and brett notes, with some cherry and dark fruit also in there. There is not really any funk from the brett, which is what I expected. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Interesting overall. A funky, bretty, complex, apocalyptic brew."
""
""
""
""
"O- A decent attempt at a wild and I hope Ommegang does another one, just looking more for that lactic mouth-puckerer I guess, or even in this brett-forward beer some more depth. Instead it isn't remotely sour and it is pretty one-note on the brett."
""
"O - A good but somewhat uninspired beer."

"Golden yellow hue. Finger of white head. Nose is full on brett city. Like band aids soaked in band aid water wrapped in more band aids. Flavor is pretty much the same as the nose. If I dove face first into a pool filled with band aids it wouldnt taste this bretty. Medium body. If there were a city named brett this beer would be the drink of choice."

"Overall: Pretty good beer but Ommegang has wowed me with other gems. Ommegeddon is very easy to drink might come off sweet but not your lady beer you know? Beer is good but hard to have a consistent crowd with it, you be the judge. Love it for what it is or hate it for what it's not."

"The purpose of aging Batch #1 was the hope that some Brett would finally come to life. Unfortunately, that never materialized and now I've grudgingly worked my way through not one, but two, disappointing bottles of this beer. Luckily, Brewery Ommegang has years of banked goodwill and I don't hold this against them. In fact, I'll make a point of buying a more recent batch to see if they've since worked things out."
" The taste while good was a lot more malt driven when I had it fresh. I kind of like what the brett has done here giving a dimension of slight fruit and spice while accenting the biscuit and toasted malt flavors, the hops have an herbal, spiced accent and are mild in relationship to the yeast which gives the horseblanket character that this particular strain is known for. Overall a good wild ale, I am glad I held on to this for a while to let it evolve, but either way I enjoyed it for being not a carbon copy of every other belgian, a nice experiment that I would be interested in seeing Ommegang try again."
"Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Chunky rings of foam line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wine, funk, sour fruits, and some grassy aromas. Taste is very much like a dry white wine, some grape-like fruit flavors, funk, and a bitter hop finish. The bitterness from the dry hopping is pretty mild but sticks around after each sip. This beer has a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel and a dry finish. Overall, this is a good wild ale with some nice funky and hoppy flavors. I was expecting this one to be more sour though."
"750 mL Belgian, cork-n-cage, batch #3 from April 2008; sampled May 2011. Pours a mildly chill-hazed deep gold, with strong enough carbonation to slowly push the frothy white head out of the glass. Clingy lace finally grabs the glass after the second pour. Smells malty and toasty, with citric hops, a few phenols, and perhaps some melon. The palate is similar, but more phenolic and citric (orange zest and pulp, grapefruit, lemon), maybe a bit lactic, and surprisingly hoppy, with leafy/green and spicy/perfumy notes but only a moderate, yet rather sharp bitterness. It is light and smooth, almost silky, with a pronounced, almost tannic dryness. An interesting beer that is kind of in the same vein as Orval, with noticeable, but rather light brett - almost more of a spiciness than funk. Definitely worth a try. It's refreshing, easy to drink, has no trace of alcohol, and it apparently ages very gracefully - if I didn't know for sure I never would have guessed that this was three years old. It would be interesting to do a vertical tasting of this one."
"This beer poured out as a hazy golden color. The head was big and white. The smell of the beer was hoppy and had a big aroma of Brett coming off of it. There was also just a touch of yeast and tart fruits. The taste ofthe beer gives off a sour taste upfront, not really my favorite thing. The there are elements of the yeast and hops in the aftertaste but the sourness holds tight. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Overall it's got a sourness to it that I wasn't too thrilled about. Other than that it's not too bad."
"Pours a hazy gold with a dissolving white head. Definitely has farmhouse, horse hoof aroma, coupled with Saison spiciness.Flavor is balanced and spicey. I little tart fruitiness, possibly from the ginger. Medium bodied and very drinkable. A funky Saison."
"D - Very drinkable. The balance of tart and sour as well as other flavors is really nice. There are also some nice funky elements mixed in as well."
"The CPJ"
"D: With the sweetness and mouthfull pulling this overhyped sled, i dont feel that it is exceptionally drinkable. I dont finish a 22oz and wish for another. Certainly not an Aladdin's lamp, just some murky candy factory that has been overrun by barnyard animals. If you are a soggy sweet lover or enjoy glazed hay, here is your jam."
"Pretty happy with this beer. I was worried that the taste wouldn't match the smell, like mikkeller it's alive."
"This bottle brought to the tasting courtesy of zep9865. This one is Batch #1, June of 2007. This beer poured a very cloudy dull gold in color on the verge of a dull orange with a light white head that laced the glass. A decent amount of dusty looking sediment sprawled out upon the bottom of my snifter. The cork literally shot out of the bottle and hit the ceiling. It smells very tart and has a lot of peach skin to it. You definitely get a healthy dose of brett. The flavors are a little subdued once again. You get good tartness and the brett brings the dry sourness. As the bottle says, this is a funkhouse ale. The funk is out of this world, nuclear holocaust apocalypically so. Wowzers it is tart and bitter. It drinks fine and dry. It is almost cider like but not quite there. Did I mention it was dry? This is a solid wild and not as fruity as most. Being a batch #1, I might have to pick another one of these up. It's a solid wild."
"D - admit i was a bit worried about this one, but was in the mood for something funky and it was cold, so i dove in. going down easy enough, and complex to a point that its keeping my interest. solid beer here, though maybe drink it fresh if its released again."
"Drink- Good, A little weird but good. I like the dicotomy of flavors from damp/citrus/funk. Had a different feel for me which I liked."
"O - It's a solid beer. I wouldn't call it great but its another quality beer from Ommegang."
"D - If you dig the funk this would e a 3, for my palate though it's on the lower end."
"D- this is excellent. If only it were possible to package this in smaller formats...calling it a sour, it's alright. Calling it a witbier, it's amazing. And dammit, I'm going to classify this as a witbier in my mind"
"This is a medium bodied offering with a light level of carbonation. The alcohol is warming in it's effect but is seemingly nonexistent in it's flavor. Quite drinkable and well balanced. Could use some more funk to make it really standout but as-is it's a quality product that I would enjoy again."
"Drinkability - This is the first Ommegang that I haven't liked. It was way off style even for a style that is ill-defined, was flat in both body and flavor, and really lacked the kind of depth that you expect from this otherwise wonderful brewery."
"D: It's fairly drinkable but I can't imagine anyone ever wanting more than a whole bottle in one sitting, I was set with half"
"Drinkability: Its a good beer, but not overly exciting really. It needs to be either funkier or they need to sour it to make it really great."
"I've had this ""fresher"" & it had a distinctive sour character to it. This was the same batch from almost a year later, & there's practically no sourness. I'm not complaining, really, because we still have a good beer here, but does this make sense? Could finish the bottle with no problem, & I think I'd go for it again."
"Drinks pretty well for the style. I'd certainly love to have this one again."
"Cloudy apricot pour with huge lingering head. Kind of nondescript aroma of dry, sour brett and yeast. Flavor is a an explosion of sour fruits -- orange, grapefruit, lemon, with strong leather and barnyard tones and a really dry finish. There is a kind of harsh lingering flavor too. Looking back on this it was probably a lingering brett on the finish that I didn't find was integrated like I wanted."
"D-wow, this is just such a smooth beer. as the drink goes on, the tastes do sort of blend together. i might have rather had this in a regular 12oz. bottle but i still did enjoy every sip of this beer. I definitely hope to have more of this some day, and I definitely will be telling my friends about this one!"
"22 ounce bomber. Aroma is quite funky, with a big barnyard smell going on. Peppery brett hits the nose first, followed by straw and grass. Taste is caramel sweet, but very dry in the finish. Some alcohol burn as you drink it. Easily quaffable and quite good."
"A really nice drinkable beer, and a great showcase for how to use brett. I find Ommegang don't really set a foot wrong and I enjoyed this immensely."
"drinkability is not to high, would much rather move onto another beer."
"D: Overall, I found this to be rather bland and unexciting."
"Bottled May 2009...so about a year and a half old. Pours an almost clear, light orange color with big, white head. Lookin nice! Aroma is quite funky, grassy, and sweet. I pick up light notes of cheese and a bit of sour apple aroma. Taste is very unique. Initially, I get green apple flavor, followed by EXTREMELY MILD sourness and lemon zest. A lot of Belgian yeast and funky flavors with grass and hay. End fairly sweet with a bit of alcohol on the back of the tongue. I find this beer to be very delicious. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp...very dry. This beer reminds me of a good saison. Drinkability is fairly high."
"Embrace the Funk!"
"Batch #4; May 2009. Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a dark yellow-orange with a two finger slightly off-white head that subside to half a finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, and slight golden apple. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, dark fruit, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this one wasn't that bad, but it also wasn't that great either. The followthrough was kind of pungent with alcohol while cold, but mellowed out just a hint upon warming up. Decent aroma and flavor here, but nothing too memorable though."
"D - not bad once the carbonation is quenched. nice one to sit around and enjoy alone. if you don't consider that a leading characteristic of alcoholism."
"compare the hops to an older batch like this. This is extremely drinkable."
"D: I wish this wasn't so boozy, because I did like the rather funky qualities this beer has."
"drinkability: damn good beer. i think the aging took some of the sourness. i have had it fresh and it was much better. good beer however"
"Drinkability: A very nice beer. However, i feel there are way better examples of the style at a similar price."
"Overall- This is awesome! The label deffinitly caught my eye and this does not disapoint. Has held up nicely after 2.5 years"
"D: i got down to about 3/4 and couldnt finish it. wouldnt ever get it again, rather pay a little extra and get jolly pumpkin or russian river."
"Very easy to drink. refreshing. Nice funkiness. Complex and tasty. Still good with close to 3 years on it."
"I don't know what to say for drinkability. It is not a hard slog, and it is good, but I feel that one big glass would probably be enough. Try this one, not really for the brett(as it isn't very sour) but for the all out complexity."
"Light and spritzy, this beer is not at all what I was expecting, but I don't really know why given Ommegang's excellence when it comes to brewing top-notch Belgian style ales. I could enjoy a whole 750 of this on my own and not bat an eyelash."
"D---Probably the fourth or fifth time I have had this brew. I keep wanting more from it, certainly not bad at all, in fact, its quite decent. Just does not make me wanting more."
"This is bottling #4, May 2009. Maybe that explains a little bit, some time to age. Once it warmed up, this was a damn fine beer. Too cold, and it sucked donkey ass. Thanks, Nate."
"Definitely another solid offering from Ommegang, a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but do not let that stop you from trying it."
"The taste is slightly more subdued than the smell. Sweet pale malts take over the top, earthy and floral hops follow. A nice sour (only slightly) pear and dusty hay taste for the finish. Very smooth. Carbonation is a little high but just barely. Amazing wild ale. Bless the brett. I rally enjoyed this brew. Well worth $12.98 and I'll be getting a few to cellar with my Russian River's."
"D- Pretty average tasting Belgian ale with some tangy notes at the end to me. The funky vinegar taste helps to elevate it a little bit, but otherwise I am not really wowed. I drank it by itself, but I can imagine this would pair really well with food and that would probably help the drinkability as well. It will be awhile before I pick this up again if at all, but I might just to try a fresher bottle."
"Cheers!"
"Pour very slowly into a tulip. A clear golden color with two fingers of soft, fluffy, white head. Smell was decent. Picked up a fair bit of malt with a hint of hops and funk on the back end. Taste wasn't what I expected...very plain and slightly lacking. I don't know I guess I was just hoping to be punched in the face by funk but instead only got a malt with a little lemon zest and cracked pepper. The funk from the Brett didn't pick up till after swallowed and then was very faint. Felt light bodied with a good bit of carbonation in my mouth. All in all this wasn't a bad beer just not what I expected at all. I would drink it again but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice by anymeans."
"Served in a flight with Oro de Calabaza and Allagash Confluence along with a dish of grilled white prawns and tomatillo-peach salsa. This one matched the food best and, for the record, I tasted the peach flavors before the dish hit the table. It was unmistakable."
"Mouthfeel is lively, and the drinkability is inviting. However, the sourness may become unwelcome after 2 of these back-to-back."
"I think this beer is a very drinkable. It is basically a Belgian golden ale with some ""wild"" spice. Nothing too shocking, just a little wild twist."
"jd"
"I'll still buy other Ommegang beers, just probably not this one again."
"This is not a big beer with big flavors; this is an almost elegant beer with a nice funk in the finish. I like it; lighter style all around but with a lot of appeal and very universally food friendly."
"This beer is an orange hued medium amber with a white head that is not billowing by any means, but has pretty good staying power. The aroma is very tart, with plenty of fruity esters and some crystal malt sweetness. The main aromas that I am getting are that of tart cherry, which is odd. The flavor has me a bit disappointed. It is quite lactic and has a lot of white grape flavor to it. Slightly peppery and spicy yeast shows through, some dried sherry like flavors, caramel malt, slight booziness and some herbal hop flavor. It is not a bad tasting beer, but for a beer with a mushroom cloud on the front of the bottle, I guess I was expecting more fireworks, if not a small thermonuclear explosion in my mouth. The body is medium and fairly chewing with effervescent carbonation. The drinkability is above average but not great, make sure to let this one warm a little, it definitely improves the flavor."
"D- What can I say, I enjoy a good funky beer. This one offers a good subdued funk with a dry finish. I would like to try this one fresh."
"Overall, this is one of the worst beers I have had the this year, hands down!"
"It wasn't hard to drink, ot bad by any means... but was not impressed by any means."
"D - I am perplexed by this brew. It is not that its bad, but it is definitely massively underwhelming. Perhaps my expectations are to blame. But it smelled so damn funky and fruity! Why didn't it taste like that? Damn!"
"The body was nicely tongue coating without being overly sticky. Drinkability was great, I wish I hadn't held on to this bottle so long, I'll be drinking other bottle soon. Overall, a top shelf beer. Worth seeking out."
"D - This is defiantly a slow goer. Split a bomber with wife but could have probably handled one myself."
"D: great on a hot summer morning as my clock just turned to 5:01am...where did the time go? Anyway, good beer and a great drinker. This always finds its way to the fridge from every one and a while"
"D - decent flavor but nothing overpowering, I have another bottle that I will age for a while to see how it changes."
"DB- Not worth the price. Jolly Pumpkin is around the same price and better IMO. I really liked the label and other Ommegang ales I have had, a bit disappointing but also a decent experience. Maybe I will try it fresh some time as the bottle I have was about a year old."
"Tasted from bottle, Batch #4 May, 2009. Pouts light amber orange with a thick, fluffy white head. Nose of sweet orange oil, pastry breadiness and tropical fruits. Surprisingly there is only a hint of brett funk. Flavors of lemon pith, orange oil with slight hop bitterness and a semi-sweet roundness. On the palate, the beer is very round with a great mouthfeel. The honeyed finish displays some brett. Overall, this is a solid and unique beer that may benefit from some more time in bottle."
"Pours a cloudy golden with some orange in it, white head didn't leave much lace but stuck around a long time. Carbonation sent yeast all over the place inside the bottle, resulting in a somewhat chunky brew. Aroma is herbal with honey-like malts, dusty funk, and mild lactic tartness. Tastes of herbal hops, chalky dry funk, honeyish maltiness, finish is very dry with a cookie finish and dusty funk. Light bodied, carbonation seems to match nicely yet the funk is somewhat astringent in the way it puckers. Decently drinking to split with friends, but not something I will revisit."
"D- I think this one sat a little too long and should have been drank at least 6 months earlier. Would like to try this fresh so I can map out all the differences. Soild try still from Ommegang."
"D-overall a pretty good beer but a rather weak interpretation of the style"
"Fairly smooth on the drinkability meter."
"pours a hazy copper color with an inch and a half of white fizzy head. lots of fizzy carbonation and fair lacing. light alcohol taste, very sweet and lively with a citrus like smell and taste followed by a bit of a ginger ale taste like finish. over all it was a very good beer but not nearly as good as i was hoping."
"D-its a great looking beer, especially in the glass I used, but it didn't really blow me away by the taste. I want to try a fresher bottle to compare someday. Its very well balanced for an 8% beer."
"Drinkability - couldnt do more than three or four"
"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Dogfish Head snifter. I removed the cage and could see the pressure already starting to force up the cork. I decided to see how long it would take for it to push it out so I let it sit. Not 2 minutes later I hear a pop, thump and see my corkless Ommegeddon. No foam over but man, that brett must have chewed up something. Poured into my Dogfish Head snifter and all I got was 6 inches of frothy, icing-like head with 1/4-inch of actual beer. After about 3 minutes the head settled and I was able to pour in 6 more inches of foam. Eventually I was able to get a full snifter out of it. One big sniff told me my inclinations were right. The brett chewed up something and became huge. Massive notes of barnyard must, damp earth, and just a little bit of urine. Under all that brett comes lemon zest and just a hint of orange. The flavor is just as dominated as the nose is by the Brett. This beer tastes musty. Musty, with grass, lemon zest, over saturated earth, and your great grandmothers moth filled closet. This is hands down the brettiest beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel, while leaving your tongue sandpaper dry, still has a hint of residual sugar. Makes me wonder what this beer would be like in another year. Overall, this wasn't a great experience. The brett dominated every single aspect of this beer, and while I enjoy brett as a complimentary flavor, it produces to many barnyard flavors to be front and center. I think that maybe after 6-8 months in the bottle would be a prime time for the brett to mature but still retain what the beer is about."
"Great beer. Was surprised by this one, loved it."
"Drinkability: This was much more of a saison than a wild ale in my opinion. With that said, it was still a pretty good beer. Really misses the mark on style though."
"Overall Impression: I had this right after Ommegang Hennepin, and I very much prefer this over that. It is more complex, more interesting and more flavorful. It is also a lot more expensive, and there are other American Wild Ales / Brett Saison's out there that I like better. If you have the coin, go for it!"
"Notes: The first of three consecutive Brewery Ommegang beers that I will taste and rate this week."
"Not my favorite Ommegang, that honor belongs to Hennepin, but a pretty nice beer overall."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light and was pretty drinkable as well. The funk is a stake in the aftertaste where is stayed for a few moments."
"D- This one is very easy to drink and has held up to aging quite well. For 8% alc I really can't taste it and will finish bottle by myself...!"
"Clean and enjoyable and a well-hidden 8%. A highly hopped Belgian pale with a dose of Brett for good measure. This is a winner."
"D:  highly drinkable says all but I'm highly dissapointed.  I've had fresher Orval that is funkier."
"Overall, not a good first try, maybe I'll get one to age and try again in the future."
"I think another appropriate name for this beer would have been ""tongue twister"". Once again, awesome stuff."
"one more good one from ommegang, this one is a touch different but in a good way, i like it."
"Note: Drinking cellered Ommegeddon even after a couple of months funk moves in on flavor... nice."
"Poured from 750ml into a red wine glass. Batch #4, May 2009 on the top of the bottle. Pours a hazy yellow-orange color, like cider in appearance. The pour gave way to a large white foamy head, that quickly fades into thin sea foam that floats on the surface. A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass. Smells funky. Real funky actually. Brett and citrus dominate. The taste is citrusy - lemon and less funky than the smell. Spicy on the forefront and has a very smooth finish. Not as complex and tasty as some of my favorite Russian River wilds, but still very good."
"Tart but not too puckering or funky. Surprisingly hoppy and it remains bitter throughout while only being slightly sour. Very dry finish. Some crisp fruit notes, mostly apple and pear."
"4/4/4/4/3.5"
"D - An interesting beer. Seems like a hybrid of styles...still lots of Belgian tripel left behind in this beer, but transformed by the bretanomyces. Brett adds an interesting layer of flavors on top. Different take on a wild ale than I've had before. Very Belgian, not sour, complex, noticeable alcohol presence. Overall enjoyable, and recommended to give it a try."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer and worth a try for any fan of the Brett. You really can't taste the ABV like you can in other Ommegang brews."
"Drinkability: If it were cheaper, I'd drink it occassionally, but I don't think I'd sit down and have a glass every time. It's a flavor adventure, and I do advise everyone to try a glass, but it's somewhat costly. I paid $13+deposit for a 750ml bottle."
"Pours golden sun rise with some cloudiness and white head over top. Smells of apple skins, light fruit juice, cider, alcohol. Spritzy mouthfeel with flavors of apples, pears, cider, alcohol toward the finish but disappears behind light fruity sour notes that dance on the tongue. The Brett is there but not in the forefront of the taste. If this is Ommegeddon then I'm a sinner, baby."
"An exceptional offering by Ommegang. Spritzy Spritey, with bubbles exploding from the bottom. Horse urine color, horse trough scent. Stank blanket and all. Malt shows up on an American Imperial Pilsner bod and looks like wild Motts. Alcohol is bit chardonnay-ish, with sour, twangy tongue twisting notes. Plenty of green apples and high pitch twitter tap dancing. Interesting but lost allure halfway through; I'm also drinking this with two feet of fucking snow on the ground. Every ale has its place."
"Drinkability: This strikes me as a super sour Hennepin. I like it, but will probably not get it again for the price. Above average for the style. Great beer if you like brett."
"Pours a hazy gold with a two finger white head with great retention and lots of little bubbles rising throughout leaving thick patchy lacing. This beer brings the funk with brett aromas like candy- sweet tarts and lemonheads with tons of citrus- exceptional. Funky sweet, sour, tart flavors of lemon, orange, passionfruit, banana with a spicy corriander kick mixed in. Highly carbonated, light bodied this beer finishes very dry with a tart & bitter pucker feel. Good solid drinkability, the variety of aromas and flavors make you go back for more but the taste doesn't live up to the initial impression by the look and smell."
"(D)- An interesting beer that smells amazing. A good body & feel to it, but rather potent in its sour & bitter flavors. But otherwise is a solid beer."
"D - I'm really happy I'm sharing this cause a 750 ml to myself would be devastating for two reasons; a) to my sobriety, and b) to my taste-buds. A great beer with wonderful nuances to explore while sipping, but a sessioner? Nah."
"flavor, mouthfeel, ABV all well-balanced for an 8% farmhouse. no problem finishing the 750ML alone."
" Bueno!"
"D: This struck me as somewhere between De Ranke XX Bitter and a Cantillon lambic. I'm not a huge fan of wild ales, but this was a serviceable example."
"Hazy light amber, golden color with a massive bone white that is dense and airy with tiny bubbles and has nice retention and lacing. Aroma is earthy and spicy, reminding me of a saison, mild brett presence in the background, also some lemon-y citrus. Medium body, with fine, sharp carbonation that finishes smoothly with some lingering citrus sweetness and mild brett funkiness. Flavor is dominated more by a saison-like flavors, spices, pepper, lemon, light hops, earthiness in general. Sweeter than expected and while the brett funk is presence throughout, never quite as strong as you would expect from the label. Not complaining, very nice, easy drinking with little alcohol presence. Very nice beer, great if I'm in the mood for something saison-y but if I want something more brett-y there are better options."
"D - ABV isn't too present and the flavors aren't too wild; if you like brett, you'll like this"
"A good beer, worth trying for sure, but not my favorite."
"The taste does not live up to the nose, but still a pretty tasty beer. It's light and airy, slightly tart with a fair amount of rubbery brett flavor. Much of the citrus noted in the smell makes its way to the party and contributes some hoppy flavor and bitterness. I think the best way to sum this beer up is that it is a crisp, easy drinking brett beer...kinda like a belgian golden ale with some funk."
"35/50"
"On the nose, it's completely different from my previous exposure to this beer. The Brett is pretty prominent, with a complex aroma of hay, wet leather and a mild bandaid character. Mild citrus and pineapple is present behind it, but it's driven primarily by the Brett funk. On the palate, likewise, the flavors are pure Brett. Funk, leather open things up, and the citrus character follows, with a great orange/tangerine character. Dries up pretty incredibly on the finish, leaving mild funk and band-aid character. The high carbonation keeps this lively on the palate as well. Despite being rather simple in flavors, this was a pleasure to drink a whole bottle of."
"I would definitely purchase this one again."
"Great drinkability, I could sit on this all day"
"Overall, a great almost"
"next time opened both bottles and compared. The 2007 had a much more complex flavor, fuller hop character and less head. Even though the 2008 has had 18 months to age in the brewery, it still needs a little more time in my opinion. Still a great beer, but back to the cellar for the 2008, maybe next year buddy!"
"The carbonation is high, but pleasant. This is my first in your face brett brew, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not sure if it's my thing. I'll finish the bottle, but it'll take a couple sittings."
"This one is a slightly golden hazy, almost yellowy-beige with surprisingly little foam. The aroma is big on funky citrus, some esters, and a little bit of barnyard. Taste is a big blast of citrus funkiness with a sort of tart astringency. It finishes pretty dry, but is not terribly bitter. The best part is that the complex flavor is complemented by quite a light body. Furthermore, the cleansing effervescence awakens the senses with each taste. There seems to be a new level of flavor with each sip. This is really an intriguing and delicious beer. I'll definitely have more!"
"D: I imagine this is a good intro to wild ales. It's mellow on the sour but still funky. Pair it with some slightly melted feta on a slice of bread."
"Drinkability is pretty high if you're a fan of brett and malty farmhouse ales, definitely more biere de garde then saison to me, but pretty good. The ABV is well hidden for sure."
"I did like this beer, just not where I want my Brett wild ales to be at this age."
"Overall, I like this beer, but I will stick to one glass of it. I would classify this as a saison and not a wild ale. Either way, I was glad to get to try it."
"D - A nice drinking beer, but I doubt I would choose to make a night out of this beer. Good, but not great."
"D: I had rather high expectations on this one, and unfortunately they weren't completely met. Still a good beer, though. But it's slightly too one-sided with too much emphasis on funkiness and sweet and spicy alcohol. The tartness that I associate with this kind of brews is to a large extent missing. Also, the funk could have been even more skewed and rough around the edges, as it is now it's to clean and well-behaving."
"A refreshing and easy drinker that is perfect for summer. This one ages very well as I have had several bottles of this in the past two years. Hold for at least 14 months or so imo. Nice brew Ommegang."
"D - There were no punches pulled in making this brew. It is aggressively farmy and funky. One has to imagine, though, how difficult it must be to temper the brettanomyces that bring out the flavors here: this brew is steps away from being too funky, but several steps ahead of other wild ales in the liberty given to the wild yeasts to do their thing. Certainly not the best introduction to wild ales, but if you're already a fan of the style, grab one of these, for sure."
"A 750ml bottle from the first batch. Shared with psycohops and poured into a pair of shaker glasses. The ale appears a mildly cloudy straw yellow color with about two fingers of lingering bone white head. Nose and flavor are of fruits such as pear, apricot, very little wild yeast characteristics left after almost two years in the bottle. To me, the flavors and aromas have knitted together quite nicely. Very refreshing at this point. If you are lucky enough to have a bottle or two of batch 1 laying around, by all means open and enjoy it now. It's drinking really nice."
"Batch #1, June 2007 Picked this up in Cooperstown on a recent trip. Heard about it but this one doesn't make it down to Texas. Pours with a large, foamy head that stays about a 1/4 inch the whole way down. Strong aroma of bubblegum, citrus and some spice. Looks a lot like the Witte to me. This is amazingly smooth. It starts off with some sourness that never really goes away. It's not overpowering, just right. There are some earthy flavors that supply that drying finish. Some fruit flavors show up every other sip. I wish I picked up more than one while I was there. Nice people at the brewery and they brew some great stuff."
"D: Flavorful, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a nice sour-style but not overly sour beer to drink for a long time."
"It was a good tasting beer and i'm glad ive tasted it, but it was not what i hoped"
"If you like this, seek out the De Proef Flemish Primitive series..."
"75cl bottle from Batch #3. Pours a slightly hazy gold with a fizzy white head. Disappears rather quickly without much lacing. Strong brett presence; some leather notes with a lot of perfume character. Cherry and citrus esters. Somewhat sweet and floral, though the brett is overwhelming. Tastes strongly of leather and mineral; the brett is overpowering here as well. Some citric notes. Quite dry overall. Slightly oxidized. Light-medium body with high carbonation. Tastes like straight brett without any other character really. Like a bad bottle of oude Orval."
"This one seems to get a little more flavor as it warms, but it never gets as good as it should be. It's not a bad beer, but it was a huge disappointment for me since I love this brewery so much."
"Notes: Sour, but not overtly funky. Has achieved excellent balance on the mouthfeel with the sourness and the explosive, dry carbonation working together in harmony, pulling the ends towards the middle. Has vastly improved since its release. Would love to see this one another year from now!"
"Overall this wasn't as funky as the label and description led me to believe, but it's still a tasty beer. Not as complex as other BSPA's with brett influences (De Proef with Rob Todd for example), but still worth a try."
"d- decent, especially for a brett beer. but, it's all relative, as duvel's drinkability is dangerous in comparison. :) i shared this one - i think i'd have a hard time getting through a whole bottle on my own."
"overall - If this and La Fin Du Monde are really indicative of the end of the world, I won't mind the rapture. Hell, I'd welcome it if I got to drink this at the end. A perfectly enjoyable Wild ale; will definitely buy again, especially since I can't get Russian River stuff where I am."
"Conclusion: This is interesting to say the least; it's definitely an acquired taste as well; the aftertaste and overall impression of the beer are quite nice, but upon first sip, it's a little bit crazy...I'd personally have liked a little less bitterness here"
"750 ml -about 1/2 is poured into my Chimay chalice and it generates a finger head that holds well. Golden straw colored beer has some nice lacing. Smell is substantial brett, grains, and mustiness; true to the style. Taste is sour with grapefruit being the predominant flavor. Would be tough to drink a lot of this if you aren't used to they style as the tartness and brett are quite overwhelming. However, I thought it was a refreshing beer."
"Golden hazy color with medium to thin white head. Aroma is decidedly Belgian (yeast) in style - lightly spicy, grassy, fruity and a touch of malty sweetness. No real tart nose here. Flavor is lightly fruity, but very very dry - as if from spices. I assume it is from the brettanomyces. Hmmm - not a winner for me, but it is quite interesting."
"D: I expected more ""wild"" flavors than this one delivered. It's not particularly sour, not much funk to this... I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish. Plenty of better examples in the style."
"D: As I said, the more I drank it the more it grew on me. However, I don't think this is a beer I'll ever crave again or get excited to drink."
"D: Very drinkable, good complexity, and a must for brett-lovers (seems like everyone is experimenting with brett these days). However, I had this about 6 months ago and it seems to have lost some of the zing. Looks like it's past its peak...drink up now!"
"Palate: More citrus not as defined on the palate as it is on the nose. A hint of white grapes and tart kiwi seed quality on the finish. Very crisp and drinkable this is one refreshing beer."
"D= Pretty good. I enjoy this one. I dont understand the wild taste yet but I'm sure it will grow on me."
"The beer tastes tart, fruity and floral, with grapefruit and citrus rind, citrus blossom, and plenty of that classic brett funkiness. This is outstanding! Refreshing, palate-awakening, and definitely more-ish! Lingering sour-funky finish. Incredible."
"I was under the impression this was more of a sour than a funky Belgian. Still, very tasty. Glad I managed to find this at Lone Hill."
"D - An interesting and enjoyable experience... Complexity in both taste and mouthfeel make this a memorable brew... I have no complaints on the appearance, but wish the aroma was slightly more assertive..."
"a glass of pure white head on top of maybe a half inch of straw yellow beer - forget the vigor in the pour -thankfully it settled down fairly quick - subsequent pours yield a meringue-like head which dissipated quickly - aroma is faint but smells like i'm in a field next to a citrus grove - nice lacing on the glass as it goes down - tastes like it smells, maybe a bit sour(good), and goes down easy -not too filling which is nice -this bomber went down slow and easy."
"Overall: Extremely complex and tasty. Normally I don't like sour beers but this one's great stuff. Highly recommended."
"Crisp and sharp up front, like a saison without the in your face barnyard flavor. Almost like a light cider, with a good deal more acidity behind it. Quick burst of sweetness in the middle before it evolves into a mild tartness that lingers on the tongue and palate the rest of the way through. Fairly light body, and not as dry as some beers I have come across so far, it's more of an off dry that accentuates the other flavors going on. Lots of citrus, almost grapefruity. The tartness opens up more and more as the beer warms, not a mouthpuckering sourness by any stretch, but quite pleasant. Not the most complex beer out there (and I would imagine sour as well, from my limited experience), but high carbonation leads to a smooth and slightly creamy mouth experience. It keeps fresh on the palate far greater than I expected. Amazingly drinkable, I've drained my tulip by this time and am now getting more. If this is the introductory beer to sours, I can't wait to get more into this wonderful world."
"Sour funk (the brett I guess) immediately apparent on the nose, and it is very nice. Recalls Belgian geuezes nicely...appley fruitiness underneath, some lemon and coriander. This beer shows best after warming closer to room temp. The carbonation settles down to a mild fizziness, this is dry, somewhat sharp beer. This is a good thing, the bitter hoppiness combined with a pleasing sourness convey the tart fruit )apricot and apple) very nicely. Really comes across as an excellent saison--and actually, despite the dry sourness, is creamier than a Cantillon-style lambic...I think the fact that I am thinking about some of the best Belgins on earth indicates that this is a very good brew. I am loving the interplay between the brett sourness and funk and the cris hoppy bitterness. The finish is extremely long. Certainly one of Ommegang's best brews...very glad I found some. When I visited the brewery last autumn this brew was not available, but some months in the bottle probably were good for it. A nice amalgamation of disparate beer styles that works very well."
"Cheers!"
"Would have no problem drinking this one all night long. Sourness is crisp but not overwhelming, more funky than sour."
"Taste is wonderfully fresh, a tiny bit of sour, a little more with the dregs from the bottle poured in with the rest. Very light mouthfeel, like a proper Belgian ale. Drinkable isn't the right word, its refreshing, and not filling... its great."
"just needs a little more acidity and funk. but very drinkable and a good, readily available introduction to this side of the beer spectrum."
"I don't think that the cellaring did much for it, as I think it lost some of the hop character that the brewers intended."
"Nice to try this, I don't venture into this range very often."
"--- Sampled the 2008 release after the 2007 and noticed a definite difference with the 2007 being more complex."
"750ml bottle from the Liquor Shop in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a murky yellow-amber with a good inch of off-white head that slowly dissipates to a thin film. Smells sweet and sour, with hints of citrus and apple. Tastes sweet with lemon, pith, acidity, some sour apple/cider character... Hard to describe... Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Awesome and funky, that's all I can say. I'd love to see how it ages."
"Drinkability is good. I'll probably buy it again to mix things up."
"Starts with a nice full taste that turns to the nice sour citrus explosion, with a lingering finish. Slight sweetness to the finish as well. Light hop notes, but pretty weak on that front. Not as interesting as some of the other bretts I've had, but it's pretty good nonetheless. A lot of carbonation here with a very creamy texture. Overall not too bad for a wild ale, but I'm gonna try to age one a bit and try this one again."
"Although unexpected, I enjoy the direction this beer took. The tartness is very tame by wild ale standards, but this beer steers in a different direction, showcasing other, more subtle aspects of the wild yeast."
"D: A 750mL bottle goes down smooth & easy."
"D- I think this one maybe like a beginner for the wild/sour taste. Easy to drink."
"Very unique style, artfully done with some wonderful American touches to a ""Belgian-style"" ale. Exemplary without a doubt. Delightfully ""funky"" but supremely balanced. Highly recommend."
"Peppery with strong lemon zest flavor. Lots of yeast bite to the drink, which lasts through the swallow and aftertaste. Not much hop; this is mostly dry malt. Thin body and highly carbonated."
"Considering how infrequently I've seen this and how expensive it is, this probably isn't anything I'll be picking up regularly drinking, but it is interesting and I'll be in the lookout for other wild ales."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D: Pretty good. Was a little anxious about the Brett, but it's subdued. This one drank nice with the combo of sweet, light malt flavors, spice, and a bit of drying bitterness and tartness."
"This is alright, but if you're coming here for underwear-staining funk, you're in the wrong spot."
"D: Much better than I thought it would be. While not the eppic poem to brett that the Russian River sours are this is a good beer. I still have a batch 1-3 vertical that I think I will give more time to develop."
"Date consumed: 21 September 2008"
"Drinks too easy, abv is really well hidden. I'm usually ambivalent about most wild ales, but this one a nice one that makes me think I will probably like these more & more with each one. Tartness slowed me down a little at the end, no big deal, well done Ommegang!"
"Overall, a great brew from a great brewery. It's just that I was expecting a little more ""funk"" and less of the earthy, grassy tones. It looks outstanding, and the aroma is extremely interesting and pleasant... everything else is just lacking slightly. Good beer though."
"This style is really not my cup of tea, but you can tell this is a well constructed beer. Having said that, it really is growing on me and I am enjoying it more than I initially thought."
"This beer poured a cloudy gold color and formed a huge foamy white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of citrus, hops and barnyard funkiness. The flavor was of malt, hops, citrus and pepper. The body is light and the finish rather sprite. I am not big on farmhouse ales, but this one is pretty good for the style. And it hides it's alcohol level well."
"It forces the mouth to pucker and the lips to perse. Enjoyable as something unique, but not as a permanent addition."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The first thing that is noticed is teh amount of carbonation, the cork almost flies across the room when the bottle was opened. The beer is a hazy gold in color with a massive, white, overcarbonated head. The aroma is citrusy with a hint of spice. The taste is much more muted than expected. A little funky, a little spicy, but the taste is nothing to get excited about. The beer is light in body and IMO overcarbonated. The beer is quite drinkable and I think would pair well with most foods. This beer is over priced and IMO does not give good value for its hefty price tag."
"(rated Dec 1, 2007)"
"As a beer itself, this is very enjoyable. Worth the price tag? Not in my eyes, but a good ""tweener"" for those getting into brett."
"Summary- this was 11$, and my first venture into sour beers. I figured that even if I hated it, it would be worth trying. I don't hate it, and in fact I see the draw in sour beers. Over the course of my glass, I have gone back and raised my rating for every single category. I have nothing helpful as to how this compares to other sour beers, but if you are like me, and curious about sour beers, this seems to be a fairly approachable first step."
"D: This is a solid entry from Ommegang, but not my favorite. Still, a well made brew."
"nothign about this one bowls you over, and it's certainly less funky than it was billed, but the sum seems to be greater than the parts in this beer making a very drinkable, fairly complex, and very enjoyable beer."
"In a snifter, this was a pretty beer, gold in color with a thick white head. The aroma knocked me out, really earthy and fruity. I don't think the taste lived up to the aroma, however. Sour fruit, spicy, a little tame. Nevertheless, it was still a most enjoyable beer."
"Pours clear yellow with a frothy white head. Dank, yeasty aroma with overripe oranges and earth. Taste was hoppy and sweet with the barnyard funk. Blood-orange sweetness in the hops worked well with the earthiness of the yeast. They used a very nice, subtle brett strain that does not take over the beer. Very nice, but it does pack a brutal hangover."
"This Wild Ale pours a light yellow with tons of cascading carbonation that feeds the snow white cap steadily,helping retention and giving the lace some time to stick. The nose is peppery and has some funky odors. This is my first Wild Ale and I must say I am impressed with the complexity. I get waves of pears, sourdough breads, pepper, dry mushrooms, powdery spores and moldy cheese. The mouthfeel is light and extremely dry,I love dry Chardonnay and this is bordering on that,I love it! I split a bottle with a friend and for me it was just the perfect amount of this funky goodness,a full bottle may be a little hard to finish on my own."
"D - This is one of the most unique and strange beers that I've had the pleasure of drinking, and its definitely one of the most complex too. The only thing keeping it from a near-perfect score is the fact that the odd flavors don't really lend themselves well to drinkability. Damn fine beer from one of the best brewers out there,"
"8/4/8/5/16 (4.1/5)"
"Smells like a lambic. Tart lemon all the way! Tall, fluffy white head sits above the hazy sunshine colored beer. Lots of Belgian yeast spiciness, some vanilla and candied sugar, and warming alcohol in the finish. It smells much more wild then it tastes. There's a hint of that citric twang in the finish, but not much. Mouthfeel is light, and almost spritzy. It's quite interesting, and pretty damned tasty. I nkow it takes a lot to make this kind of beer, but at $13 this is a one time thing."
"went really well with some double cream Brie"
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I don't get a whole lot of funkiness from it. I enjoyed it though and would recommend it to others."
"Very easy drinking, light and spritzy. I imagine this would be more funky had I enjoyed it from the bottle."
"I don't know why I always overlook these guys, because everytime I pick up an Ommegang I enjoy it. I especially love their design & bottling. This ""battle"" for ""dominion"" nearly caused a cat ruckus...I unwound the cage to the cork & the cork shot off straight away before I was done unwinding. I took it as excitement to come. As I poured into a Duvel glass, I noticed a nice aroma that had a bit of mild funkiness to it especially as the white but nice head formed. The taste was a bit metallic, but also a bit grassy and complex with a slight apple taste. I feel that if served too cold, (this was at room temperature, which in my house is a cellar equivalent!), then the metallic taste might overwhelm & ruin the taste. I felt pleasantly involved in this battle & would definitely pick it up again, as well as other offerings from these guys."
"Overall, this beer is on par. Easy to drink, nothing overwhelming, and a decent offering."
"D - This is a nice wild ale. Great funky/sour flavors."
"A: Semi-dark gold, thick frothy head, patches of foam on the side - 4.00, S: Some earthiness, almost an aroma of dirt, subtle tartness on the nose - 4.00, T: Extremely tart, lots of very green apple, quite bitter - 3.50, M: 3.5, D: Sometime it's difficult to separate the quality of a beer within the style relative to my own likes and dislikes, and as much as I'd like to appreciate farmhouse ales - it is a style that has yet to fall into favor with me. With regards to Ommegeddon, it is a good representation of the style just not a style that I enjoy - 3.50"
"Drinkability: I had high hopes that this beer was going to be sour and funky. it was sour at all and it wasn't all that funky. To me it was just a regular Saison with a little more yeast and that barnyard taste added to it. Compared to the other Ommegang bottled beers, it's really not worth the extra money. I would rather drink Hennepin than Ommegeddon."
"d: enjoyed this quite a bit with the grilled sea bass and will continue to buy for sure. a bit pricey but worth it"
"Pours a hazy yellow orange color, very similar to the Witte i had just before this one. Medium sized white head. Some funk to the nose but mostly just mild grassy hops. Very subdued flavor as well, this doesn't have nearly the funk that previous batches of bottles have. Still and all a nice flavor of citrus fruits, pale malts and grassy earthy qualities. Medium bodied, good carbonation and very drinkable."
"D- I paired this with Chicken Parmesan tonight, and it went very well. I loved the spice characteristics with the spices going on with the dish. I highly recommend that pairing."
"Kraig"
"Served in an Ommegang Rare Vos glass. Slightly cloudy yellow, with a frothy white head. Very funky odor; kind of like a better version of my hockey bag. Taste is quite interesting; dry, a little bitter from the hops, along with elements of pepper and spices. Relatively easy drinking for a stronger beer if you are a fan of the funk aspects; not my favorite Ommegang, but a quality offering."
"d - Let me make a distinction. This is a great, drinkable beer from Ommegang. But, at the price of $10.99 a 750ml I will probably keep reaching for Hennepin or Saison Dupont or Saint Landelin La Divine which I can enjoy at a much cheaper price"
"Drinkability: I like this one and have had it several times. This particular one was brewed in April of 08 so I think it could've used a bit more cellar time. All in all I have to say BUY it."
"Really not that great."
"My first wild ale, so here goes. Batch #3, April 2008 served in my DT tulip. Poured a translucent yellow-gold with a dense, two inch bright white head that eventually settles into a quarter inch solid cap. Some strands of lacing with fair retention. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced from the base of the glass to the bottom of the cap. Nose reminded me slightly of a saison - a little grassy, a little funky, a little musty, but much less spice. Also picked up some medicinal phenols towards the back of the bouquet. Taste consistent with nose; however, not as funky as anticipated. Perhaps a little peppery and some citrus astringency detected along the cheeks and towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light and very lively with a mild carbonation burn that lingers along the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Finish is fairly clean and dry. Great drinkability. All the qualities of a saison, but spice profile is much more subdued."
"Batch#1, June 2007. I cellared this for longer than the minimum of 6 months as stated on the bottle. This poured a hazy golden yellow color with a foamy white head that stuck around for awhile. Lots of carbonation rushing to the top. At first it smells like ginger ale, but really yeasty. Champagne like and slightly sour. The taste is sour and citric. There was a nice suggestion of pear and sour apple. This is funky. As i consumed the brew I came across some weird flavors; sweetarts, licorice, must, earth, medicine. Definite funk. The feel is smooth but lightly tingly from the carbonation. The alcohol flavor is barely there. The large bottle won't be hard to finish. Its very drinkable and exotic."
"I am a loyal Ommegang fan, I would put this one in the top 4 of their beers for sure. Hennepin as my top, it's a toss up on the next 3 (Rare Vos/Amber, Dubbel/Abbey, Ommgeddon)"
"Drinkability - Well, I tried it. Perhaps I'll buy another bottle and let it age for 6-12 months and try again."
"D- I couldn't drink more than the 740ml bottle but its not bad. However, I would not rush out and pick up another."
"This probably wasn't worth the fairly high price tag ($10+) because there's nothing extraordinary there."
"What a wild ride, if you'll pardon the pun. A crazy beer, full of phunk and character. Thankyou Brett (annomyces) for adding an entirely new dimension to the beer spectrum."
"Ommegang has done it again. Great brew."
"whats with the revelations you say? i dont know... whats with the hiroshima pic though? is that ever cool?"
"Wheat bland with mild sour and storng carbonation. dry woodiness or straw. Dried out leather stuck on a dry tongue. Light body and light zesty carbonation. Drinkability is not very."
"Edit: I added points to drinkability as this beer is quite good especially when it warms, but It really doesn't have as much of that wild ale characteristic that I love."
"Brewery Ommegang Ommegeddon pours a peachish orange with a two finger frothy white head. The smell has a medium strength of yeast with some citrus notes in the background. Initially the taste is dominant of bitter and yeast. Its definitely unique, but I'm not liking after the initial pour. The taste gets better after about five to ten minutes. It smooths out a bit and becomes quite a bit less bitter. Still its a bit overwhelming of a bitter yeast flavor to really be enjoyable unless thats your style. Mouthfeel is good. Its medium dense with a smooth and mildly carbonated feel. Overall drinkability is really pretty weird. Its definitely tastes like a funkhouse. Nice one timer but I think there are others from Ommegang I'd get before this one."
"Drinkability: Not as complex or robust as I had hoped, but good, and very good with Maytag Blue. Very bad with figs."
"From from wild ale expert I claim to be but this was a fun one to drink nonetheless. Glad I gave it a try."
"I am not that familiar with wild ales. I have had a few, but this seems more like a saison to me. Not that that is bad. Worth a try if you like the funky/sour farmhouse style beers."
"Very light and airy,tangy interesting taste goes down nice, refreshing. Crisp nice on a hot dat for a stronger beer"
"This one was quite good, although not crazy complex it may be a bit past it's prime. I've got the fresh 08 batch in my cellar and may crack it in six months to see how that one compares. Still a damn solid brew from the Gang."
"Overall, this is a model brew with hardly a flaw. Highly recommend !"
"D: Pretty highly carbonated and high abv. The taste is average to above average (can't really go much higher given I have no baseline for the style...so comparing mostly to Saison style)."
"pours a nice unfiltered gold color with a decent white head. the nose is musty, a dry aroma, subtle banana. the taste is banana, yeasty, musty, bitter yet sweet. medium body, spritzy carbo, dry finish. This beer pumps me up and makes me wanna go breaking heads! AAAARRRGGGG!!!"
"D- It's complexity makes me want to sip at it, but it's so refreshing and goes down so smooth."
"definitely an exciting offering form ommegang."
"Pours a semi cloudy pale golden with a thin white film head. Aroma is sweet fruit, slight horse blanket and citrus. Flavor is lightly spicy, light earthy and a bit citrus. Unfortunately the Brett does not shine through. Light bodied, chewy spicy texture. Abrupt spicy citrus finish."
"Like a Belgian blond, with wine-like notes, gets really creamy as it warms up. Slight sourness throughout, not much funk, expected a bit more out of the brets for better or worse, enjoyable if mildly disappointing. Worth drinking again though."
"Poured from a corked bomber I bought about 1 year ago and re-discovered 1 day ago. The first pour is much clearer than expected, there's a lot of sediment on the bottom of the bottle so later pours show some floaties. The beer is light golden colored and has a thin head. The smell is a little sour but not as much as I expected, oitherwise it smells of Belgian yeast products, a little estery. The taste is nice, I feel it's more a Belgian pale ale than a wild ale, although it seems to have some wild ale yeast put in. The main flavors are lightly tart sourness, some biscuit, a touch of light fruit, and some hoppy bitterness. Another good beer from Ommegang."
"D: Very drinkable. Everything meshes together nicely to leave a good experience behind."
"Thanks again Alan, for another great brew!!"
"Also, the hops and malt are much more vibrant than batch 1."
"A complex and interesting saison. I find new flavors in every sip. I would definitely pick this up again."
"Poured a three-finger head that took forever to die because of constnat carbonation; an amber hued gold with a mix of some mild hops with citric notes (lemon, pear) and some sweet malts such as caramel. A medium body with good hop presence that gives it a tart, somewhat sour taste (lemon, pear and apple). Also some nuttiness and a sweetness in there with some caramel malt and hints of molasses and cany apple. ABV is hidden and this is one I'll have to have again."
"D: An enjoyable experience with my pallet somewhat confused with the rushes of flavors back and forth. Will have to revisit after aging and hopefully on tap or a growler next time I go upstate."
"D- finishing the bottle was hard for me as this isnt my favorite style. pretty enjoyable for spending an evening outside on the porch with the wife. i might be interested in splitting a bottle of this again given its the right situation"
"Overall a very drinkable beer, I could definitely have one of these pretty regularly."
"I am trying hard to try all that Ommegang as to offer because I am such a big fan of Duvel. This is the first offereing that I would get again. I am not totally familiar with the style of American Wikd Ale but if this is a good representative then I will be giving others a shot. Good combination of string alcohol masked by the fruitiness aspect. Overall a good beer that I will look for again."
"D: Not too bad for every once and a while but a bottle every once and a while is great."
"First sip reveals an average body with smooth texture and very fine carbonation. Flavor is sweet for a short hit and then rolls to grassy and bitter hops that linger as well. Not too funky on the flavor or as complex. A decent enough beer but I was a little let down in the funk department."
"(Btw, Russian River can start shipping some bottles anytime!)"
"Very good for summer outside - light and enjoyable, but with full flavor that's accessible. Can we say, ""Gateway Funk?"""
"drink ability - A overall good beer not quite what I was hoping for from a wild ale but I can see myself drinking this again"
"'o the funk. On the palate, pleasantly sweet , light to moderate malt, hops are very present, sour apple and tart fruit, brett is starting to funk it up a bit. Character really begins to develop as the hop nuances, alcohol, and light funk begin to mesh well as this jeezebell heats up. Long dry bitter finish. To really appreciate the brett in this bad girl, you would probably have to throw her in a dark cool closet for a few months, I couldn't wait but thats why I bought 2. Highly recommended."
"Overall, this is a must try beer. It won't please everyone but it is definitely an experience every beer lover should try. Perhaps I will buy a bottle to age and see if the hops mellow out a bit."
"Pours a cloudy orange/yellow with a giant white foamy head and a ton of carbonation. The head is huge and lasts forever. The smell is pungent with banana,wheat,cloves,citrus hops,pepper,and bread yeast. The taste is crisp with a peppery spicy first sip then you can taste the cloves,banana,and citrus fruit. A nice tasting beer,but watch the pour,you don't want the yeast. The m/f is light and the flavors mix well. For a pretty high alcohol beer, you can't taste the alcohol burn. A good decent beer,but I have to say I did expect more."
"June 2007 batch. Nice golden orange color, huge white head that gripped the glass well. Light, fruity aroma. Drinks a lot easier than I was expecting. Pretty dry and crisp, can't taste the alcohol at all. Not quite as ""funky"" as I was hoping, but still enjoyable."
"Creamy and smooth on the mouthfeel. Non-cloying and refreshing with each sip. Very easy drinking."
"Beer poured golden into my Duvel tulip with a bubbly short lived white head. Nose is of light fruits. Taste is very good, a medley of sweet and sour fruits, apple primarily, finishing with a crisp dry hop to balance things out. Mouthfeel is very light yet lively but not overly smooth as you would expect from this style. Drinkability is good. This is a nice crisp lively beer that is somewhat complex yet refreshing. The abv is definitely under the radar. I was expecting a sour bomb which has turned out to be a pleasant mixture with a mild leaning towards the sourness. Style is more Belgian Strong Ale than anything."
"2) There is a sticky sour/funky finish which lingers in my mouth afterwards. I have to imagine my breath is kicking. Luckily the girlfriend is out for the evening. So I'm gonna sit back and polish this off with worrying about offending. Another nice beer Ommegang!"
"As drinkable as it is complex. Love the funk factor in this ale, the body is the only area that I would like to see slightly increased. Any fan of wild ales should have this one on their short list."
"D: This brew is pretty nice. I wish I had someone to share this with but it won't be hard to polish off the 750. Tasty and easy to drink. Very nice."
"Notes: Its palate makes it easy to sip and its complex aroma and interesting flavor enticed me to drink on. Very well done!"
"I'll hopefully get to try (and review) a fresh batch of this soon."
"I will say that the brett flavors and aromas seemed to pick up steam on the second and third pours, as the yeast-to-beer ratio in the bottle increased."
"batch #1, june 2007 the label states, pours a cloudy pale golden color w/ a huge fluffy white head which never really settles leaving a complete coating of lace in my ommegang chalice ; wow, interesting aroma, smells like moldy grains, sweatsocks and green fruits, some floral hops and alcohol present as well ; taste is similar to smell with more accent on brett here, a bit sweet and vinous on the palate, some cereal grain does come through midway, a bit of mineral salts and hot alcohol in the crisp finish ; very dry, surprisingly light bodied w/ moderate carbonation for the style ; an excellent brew (if you're into bretts anyway), very drinkable for a 8% ABV..."
"Worth a shot..."
"follows. The nose is malty, yeast, lots of spice's, with some caramel. The taste is mostly malty/yeasty, not too much spices. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"An easy-to-drink wild ale. Doesn't have the musty/funky punch that was expected, but could easily pass as a fine ""intro"" to style. Interesting and easy to drink. Certainly worth checking out, though nothing ""explosive""."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. It's a good beer if you like sour beers like gueuze and lambics. I could have aged my bottle longer but I think it's good the way it is, fresh."
"Overall this is a tasty, refreshing, complex brew. I like it quite a bit. The price is pretty steep at 12 bucks, certainly not gonna have a bunch lying around, but for a celebration, or something super tasty now and again? Yeah, pick this one up."
"1st Batch. Light yellow/gold color, with a full, lasting, frothy foam. Bottle conditioned. Bretta nose, with loads of lemon and funk. Flavor has mainly been taken over by the Brettanomyces and is quite sour. Notes of fruits (peaches, nectarines, mango) with a pleasant sourness and low acidity. Nicely balanced and really quite good."
"Light and fluffy on the tongue - mouthfeel is probably this beers best quality. Decent drinkability - so far the easiest and most drinkable wild ale/non-fruit lambic I've had. I am finding that these styles are not my cup of tea."
"Not a wild ale to me because the tart has still not developed, I do not know how much more time you can give this one for that to happen either, not my thing and pretty disappointed, will not drink again at this price, worth trying if you are curious but if you are expecting something with a lot of brett like a Jolly Pumpkin or Russian River, then you will most likely be let down"
"When I was drinking this beer I couldn't stop thinking that the flavor reminded me of the scent of a craft store. A well crafted beer to be sure; not my cup of tea, but I can certainly appreciate this beer for being different. I would recommend this beer to someone looking for something different."
"What I was hoping for was a super sour, gueuze-like brew, so I was a bit disappointed on that note. But still, this beer has some unique earthy funk that probably has its best years ahead. I will be glad to try one again with some further aging..."
"The taste is crisp, tart, dry, very refreshing. It continues fruity and brisk upfront then moves to a malty wheat, honey, feel. The finish is sour with a nice brett character. Although it takes 6 months to get that full Brett character, this is still a quality beer."
"This is a good wild ale and a fine into to the style. Recommended."
"D:Surprising easy to drink and it's a very good beer. Has some funk but nothing overpowering. As the beer warmed up it also seemed to mellow a little more."
"Ommegang Ommegeddon, one of the great beer names of all-time, is a pretty damn good American wild ale. It knows when to push hard and when to hold back (unlike most of the Jolly Pumpkin brews, which are Brett-blasted and overattenuated). If it wasn't for the outrageous price tag, I could drink this stuff on a semi-regular basis."
"Overall, I like the idea and this beer has some good qualities. I just had a hard time with that metal flavor that came through."
"D- I drank two of these with ease. This one could please many different types of beer lovers. Nice!"
"Glad I could try. Not really a great ""gateway"" to funky beers, although it'd be fun to introduce this first and then pull something really funky to see if the taster can then return and pull those notes out of this beer."
"This is not insane Brettanomyces Armageddon, as label and name seem to promise. For anyone already into Duvel and other great but easy-to-drink Belgians, this would be an excellent gateway to the wild world of yeast funk. I wanted a ton more stinky dirty-sock sweat craziness, and ended up just as pleased with the depth of flavor and amazing balance on display. Delicious. One of Ommegang's best."
"MF&D - Medium bodied with high carbonation. Finishes dry with a slight alcohol warmth. Enjoyable."
"D- Very nice and tasty. I am impressed."
"Overall, a pretty nice brew, one I'd get again. Ommegeddon doesn't have the massive Brett funk that other wild ales (Mo Betta Bretta comes to mind as does some Russian River brews) do but it's still a tasty offering worth picking up."
"Drinkability- I'll definately buy this one again. But buyer beware the ABV will sneak up on you! All and all, a good brew."
"Pours hazy golden with an airy one finger of snow white head. Terrific ripe fruit aromas of apple, pear, and lemon while yeast characters come through lightly, and then faint notes of straw, oak, and brandy. Spiciness jumps out right away, pepper, clove, coriander and becomes super dry and bitter. The brett offers a gritty, earthy, mossy like funk. Tart green apples, lemon pith, vinous character thats nearly vinegary, and a suggestion of juniper berry. Crisp champagne carbonation. Overall a very deep beer and distinguishably brett."
"Complex and satisfying."
"Pours a hazy lemon yellow color, with a foamy white head with tons of bubbles. Smells like bananas, circus peanuts, and a lingering herbal note that is subtle. The nose wasn't as nearly as intense as i thought it was going to be, and actually is fairly good. The palate shows more of a tart, herbal characteristic which follows what everyone should think before drinking this beer. The carbonation seems a little over-the-top, but masks a little bit of the funk. Cloves/spices and funk roll up at the finish and slap your buds so you're ready to battle preemptively. I wouldn't ask for another pour, but this beer matches up to what its supposed to be and I can respect that."
"Overall, this one doesn't quite bring the funk. I wouldn't say it's a bad beer, it's actually very good, but it isn't what it is advertised to be either. Complex yes, funky not so much. My scores will show that this is in fact a good beer, but if you are looking for some funk, I would recommend something else at this point. Maybe with some more age, it will truly be funky. Still, it is drinking very good right now."
"D: For a wild ale of this strength, it's incredibly drinkable!"
"D- definitely a keeper, too bad its not more available. maybe ill get some treats from him now that hes over at new glarus, the next unplugged is a berliner wiesse"
"My first sniff was full of a strange citrus like smell, I'm not sure what the underlying scents were that threw off the citrus, but it was certainly complex. Now that my beer has warmed, there's a decided funky yeast smell (the brett I assume?) that reminds me of ripe blue cheese. Yummy! It tastes great, with a sharp bitterness up front that fades into a citrus peel flavor. I can't quite peg what the aftertaste reminds me of at the moment.The mouthfeel is sparkling and bubbly, not heavy at all but still coating the mouth nicely. I think I could drink very many of these in one sitting, especially since it seems to be changing even more as it warms up. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to try something off the beaten path."
"Notes: Bottle says ""Batch # 1 July, 2008"" and I drank it earlier this evening 4/9/08. It went great with chicken and several cheeses ranging from sharp to subtle."
"Pours hazed yellowish orange with a small filmy white head. Smell is light and dusty, bretty, and some faintly sweet malt. Taste is mild and dusty with faintly tart malt, a bit of earthy hops and a mild bretty influence. Medium bodied and a bubbly mouthfeel. Pretty nice stuff!"
"This is a fine beer. I'm not sure it's for everyone; I know plenty of folks who just don't enjoy brett-beers. But I do, and I think this is a great hybrid beer, combining the funky flavors of the wild ales with a dry, hoppy belgian golden ale. Really nice. At 8% ABV it's not too big either. A quality sipping beer that could easily serve as a substitute for a white wine just as it could be an after-dinner nightcap."
"D - 8% abv? Drinks like a 4% until you stand up. Ridiculous. Drinkability is the strong point of this brew, but in all honesty, I was expecting bolder flavours."
"This poured a hazy light gold with fluffy white head. It smelled like a fairly typical Belgian with sour yeast and lemon scents. It tasted like lemon hops and grass (i.e. lawn clippings). It had decent bitterness, but not a very clean flavor. It was watery and very carbonated with a bitter aftertaste. Overall, this was not a great beer, but it was tolerable."
"D- A great beer that I look forward to trying as soon as possible. While tasting, I sampled some Italian sausage that paired perfect with this style."
"An almost glowing yellow holden body hosts an off white head that only reaches about one finger even with a strong pour. Fades to just a skim in a couple of minutes. Nose is a doughy mix of soft fresh fruit and raw wheat. There is a hint of sweetness also. Enters the mouth realatively smooth without the sharp sour that I would expect from the style. A bit of wheat mixes with a nice hop profile and glides thru the mouth with just a bit of sour feel wraped around an almost pilsner like bitter feel. I really dont think the Brett bacteria has really taken its true effect yet. Mouthfeel is very much of a German style and dry feel. Solid drinking brew. Maybe it should have had a little higher dose of the Brett or needs longer in the bottle. I'm not complaining though since I'm not a huge fan of the sour beers."
"Try it you'll like it!"
"Overall: Not my favorite wild in the world, but it's a great American offering of this Belgian classic. Ommegang knows what they are doing."
"label notes recommended for now or up to 2 years from the release. Given the mild acidity and funky flavors I'd be inclined to try this again at 2 years. Very mild intro to the wild category at this stage of bottle conditioning."
"A pretty solid brew with just the right amount of funk for me that made the bottle a full enjoyment through. Although, still much more of sipper then something I could swig alot of easily. And there's nothing wrong with that when it comes to this kind of Brett induced beer."
"d: I love Ommegang for trying, but to me this one comes up a bit short. Gotta love the name though."
"Looks like a belgian blond alle, translucen straw with chunks of yeast floating around. Moderate carbonation with a short head in a goblet. Nose is sort of sweet and funky from the yeast. Taste is sickly sweet, hard to decide what sort of sweet flavors are in there, but the hops and funkiness show, overpowering the sweetness. It has a bit of a bite, not sure if I like it or not. But, again, it is a ""wild ale"" so I guess it's fairly wild."
"D: Overall a very drinkable wild ale and good entry for those not familiar with the style. A outstanding beer and recommend."
"D: It required a great deal of patience, but sitting on the beer was worth it. The brett profile has really come through, adding a dry tartness to the ale that is quite funky."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates to a thin ring with some lacing. Smells a little musty with a hint of hops and some sour lemon. Taste is a little funky with some malt and yeast flavors. There is a sour citrus, mostly lemon. This is my first wild ale with brett so I don't know what to really expect. Hopefully this one will get better with age. The mouthfeel is a little thin with some oily residue. The drinkability is great with no alcohol really present. I'll have to let the other one go for awhile but it will be hard not to drink."
"I think the beer is okay, but I think nowadays when someone is marketing a sour beer it should be a little more bold, maybe more age would allow the brett more time to work on this; this was Batch 1 from June '07. This is a very pale beer that is relying totally on the brett to make it good, and I just don't think the character is there yet. Even though I say that, I guess it is fairly drinkable given its more subdued flavor and light body. To wrap it up, easy to drink, but not overly memorable."
"Nice, well done but not excellent. Worthwhile nonetheless."
"Still struggling with my palate's aversion to this and related styles - Flanders Oud Bruin (Goudenband, review forthcoming) may have been the breakthrough. This isn't my favorite thing in the world but I can respect it and i'm definitely buying a bottle to cellar for a greater length given how much this has evolved in 6 months."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a light golden yellow color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light Brett with some very minor notes of horse blanket. Taste is also dominated by some light sour notes with some Brett notes and light horse blanket notes. Body is quite full with some good carbonation. What a big disappointment from the rave reviews I was reading 2 or 3 years ago. Brett character is really too subtle and hops presence was not as I was expecting it."
"Not sure when this was bottled, but I've been holding onto it for four to five months, so it's got to have a bit more age on that by now. Pours a light, dirty gold color with a big, white head that fades to a tenacious collar. The aroma is fairly light, although it does display some nice barnyard elements and a touch of citrus. There's also a warm, vague spiciness that I expect is a yeast artifact. On the palate, wonderfully soft barnyard off the bat, with funky citrus wrapped in hops oils coming up at the mid-palate. Very dry, with no residual sweetness left, and a finish that is mouth-encompassing with intense tingles. Big carbonation throughout, along with potent, lemony acidity that never gets too harsh. Overall, this is almost fantastic. I must say that letting this sit for five months plus was a good idea -- it's dry but still soft, which, for a wild ale, is a precious combination. I wish I had more of this."
"It's an interesting beer but I was expecting more from thr Brett. As someone else said earlier, it does taste like a Duvel to me though not as good."
"I have had this on the tap a couple of different times and it was different each time both in colour and flavour. I'm hoping it gravitates more towards the first time I had it on tap in future brewings. Previously it was hazy orange with much orange rind and lots of brett. I suppose only time and the next batch from the Ommegang brewers will tell."
"really not all that wild. unless i've developed a tolerance to it i detect very little brett character. tasty but not quite as advertised"
"This would be a great beer for a warm afternoon, very refreshing and thirst quenching."
"Pretty interesting brew and relatively complex. Definitely worth a try once."
"D. Not a bad beer to drink at all, just not very impressed with it compared to other wild ales I have had."
"A favorite of 2007 for myself, at the Steel City Big Pour fest I had a fun time sampling this funkdified brew. I found it comparable to green apples and pussy, sorry to get graphic but it fits this brew perfectly. Appears a cloudy golden hue bright tight white fine bubbled head fine even Belgian style lacing. Aromatics massive deep tropical fruit notes like pineapple, star fruit, and mango with tart acidic yogurt like notes from the brettanomyces added. Spicy flowing yeast notes with dry musty grape seed earthy qualities and fresh cut green apple aka a touch of diacetyl. Flavor brings of the funky with some hard cider mild tart citrus and tropical fruit qualities, soft powdered vanilla added into plain creamy yogurt with a mild chalky over ripened fruit thing going on. finishes dry and spicy with the yeast kickin' you in the balls. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nothing overdone or rough on the palate. Dry puckering tartness in the finish with a lactic apples and cream tartness, carbonation flows so smooth. Drinkability so sessionable and complex, I need to track down some more bottles and sit on them to let the bret flourish."
"Looks promising enough with a slightly hazy gold body, which I figure is appropriate for the style. The aroma is surprisingly light with a balanced mix of pale grains and mellow funk. In the flavor there hardly seems to be any funk to be found. There's a small but crisp bite of hops which is nice, but this beer is way too mild. Sure it's pretty easy to drink, but it shouldn't be this easy. It's like a I'm drinking a bland Duvel."
"Funky aroma, although levels off as it warms to room temperature. Very light colour with white head. Very little spices other than pepper. Like a Cantillon unfermented ale. WIld ale, and not harsh on the palate. Slightly acidic requiring food, but no different taste by course."
"This beer was a hazy light caramel colour, maybe closer to straw yellow, with a thick, fluffy white cap. As the fine bubbles settled to a thin skim, it left thick, sticky lacing behind. The aroma was full of funk, wet straw, a bit of tartness, grassy and lemony hops. Same in the flavour, but with a light malt sweetness and a mild citrus/sourness. Medium/light bodied with moderate carbonation, this one was smooth and tasty. The funkiness (brett) hasn't taken the beer over yet, so the balance is still quite nice. It'll be interesting to see how this beer develops over time though."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with about a finger of bone white head. Aroma is pleasant but very subdued. I detect some light maltiness, honey, belgian yeast, some banana and clove esters, and a bit of brett funkyness. Taste is good, again it is a bit subdued. The brett funk is more pronounced here than in the aroma but still doesn't overwhelm. It is accompanied by some maltiness, peppery phenols and slight sourness. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is ok, the flavors are interesting for a glass or two but I wouldn't want more than that. Overall an interesting brew thats certainly worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy golden, big fluffy white head forms, tons of lacing, really pretty, solid layer. Smell is neat, vinegar, lots of sour berries, lemons, very tart and acidic, bit of oak, bread, spices, nice. Taste is wheat, bread, citrus acidity, nice lemony tartness, light fruit sourness, vinegar finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, nice tartness, good thing we have more bottles to open when the brett really takes a hold. Thanks Russ!"
"A highly drinkable beer. Reminds me of a Saison with a bit more wild character. I hope to run across this beer in the future."
"Slightly metallic, citrus introduction. Mix of fresh and old hay. Grassy. Light powdered sugar sweetness, tropical fruits, and melon show through some nicely funky, earthy, nearly sour flavors (Brett?). Acidic citrus adds to the mild sourness in the finish: flashes of melon amid herbal bitter hops. Very nice. Medium body with an almost creamy feel despite strong carbonation. Very drinkable for 8%."
"In the end, I really like this beer, despite the fact that I think it is a failure as a beer that is so prominently advertised as ""with Brettanomyces."" Hopefully that will come with time, but I strongly suggest that next time they age it in bulk with the Brett before bottling (like was done for the initial, draught release)."
"D: A nice, drinkable beer. The alcohol taste tapered off later on in the session. Easy, smooth mouthfeel and nice, balanced taste made it a very drinable beer."
"Drinkability: Not as wild as many of the great Belgian wild ales or those from Russian River; nevertheless, I am not the biggest fan of funk and to have a funky element to an otherwise tasty beer is just about right for me"
"Tastes of fruits (apples, berries), more spices and a bit of barn yard funk. This is not my favorite wild ale but it is definitely worth trying (a couple of times for that matter). I wish I had a bottle to age."
"Heavy and matted in texture but with moderate carbonation. The finish is very dry and has some good warmth in it. The lingering, sediment induced feel is a suitable end. Different and interesting for sure."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very easy beer to sip. Lacks the pop and big flavors that I have tasted in the Russian River Wild Ales, but this is still pretty good. With that said, I will pass on this the next time, I'll save my money for the next trip to Santa Rosa."
"A:4 S:3.5 T:3.5 M:4 D:4"
"No matter where I go, whenever I see Ommegeddon on tap it's a must order!"
"Good, full-bodied brew with under control carbonation. A nice enough drinking saisson although one that certainly needs a few additional months of aging (this is from the initial summer brewing)."
"Body is light, airey, and slick. A highly approachable Wild Ale that has just enough complexity to keep me interested"
"A break-through beer for Ommegang. All of their releases are good. This one puts them up with the best and most daring Belgian brewers."
"Drinkability - This isn't that bad for a Wild Ale. The flavor was okay, I just wish that the scent was bolder and had more of the Brettanomyces flavor. It tastes almost like a witbier on steroids. While it was good, I don't see myself buying this very often - not that I could anyway, since they don't sell this here in Texas. There are better, bigger, bolder Wild Ales to search out, such as La Roja, and more importantly - pretty much half of Russian River's offerings."
"I picked up a bottle of this this past summer while at the brewery and felt that the gathering of friends here would be the perfect time to break it out and give it a try. While I did have a few samples while at the brewery and felt that this was simply an excellent brew, I was having a hard time remembering it. The brew poured to a somewhat light yellow/golden color with a nice sized white head that had great retention, leaving some chunks along the side of the glass. The aromas gave a slight noticeable citric scent from the start. Also in there is a pepper spice, sweet honey and some fruit aromas that really make this brew inviting. The taste is sweet up front with some nice funkiness setting in that seems to give a slight souring taste along with a spiciness that seems to be a bit more than peppery. This is a nice brew, glad that I picked this up while visiting the brewery this past summer and the flavors brought it all back to me. Hope that they would continue to make this in the future?"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Finish is semi-dry on this one, at first the tongue has a slick finish while the soft palate has a dry finish, over time the tongue dries out giving this brew a much drier finish in the long run. The brew has a medium-light body with appropriate levels of carbonation. Not hard to drink, but this isn't something that I think I'll buy again, nothing all that special to it. Don't get me wrong its good, but I'll be trying others before coming back to this one. As this beer is my introduction to the style I think that it'll take a few more of this style until I can fully appreciate the style and understand what is going on inside the brew."
"Carbonation is fine and prickly, body is a shade thin of medium. A bit acrid in the finish. Not Ommegang's best."
"Drinkability is very good, enjoyable funky, fruity, earthy, hoppy, yeasty goodness. A little pricey but defiantly worth a try and a retry in my book."
"M&D - i will definitely have to try other wild ales to compare the style, but i like this, its easy to drink, especially for all the unique flavors, ommegang knows how to brew"
"Gold colored pour. Aroma of mud and wild yeast, Very nice. Taste is much the same with a very pleasant citrus taste throughout both upfront and on the finish. I like it a lot. There have been versions of this I have tried at fests that could have won best in show. There is definite room for improvement but I am quite pleased that they tried bottling this. This is the first time Ive seen this one bottled. Still--extremely drinkable considering the abv."
"Edit: 11/30/08 - Original bottling. 1 year after the initial tasting of this beer. I'm not going to change my ratings at all for this. The brett is only a tad more evident but not enough to warrant any major change from the characteristics originally detected. If anything, I would call this a pretty good saison but certainly not a ""wild ale""."
"Pale, pale almost peach color. Slight fluffy head. Basic earthy and sulfury smell. Some wet or stale cardboard but not the funk I was expecting. Good flavor. Sour and ""off"" flavor that is quite nice. I have had few wild beers before so I assume this is the brett. Mild citrusy notes. Decent mouthfeel-quite dry actually. I find this to be a very different and pleasant experience overall. Nice to try something different and find it this good. Going to cellar a bottle as recommended to bring out some more funk."
"D- I like the aroma but from the flavor it just seems like they couldn't decide were to go with it. Once again Ommegang lets me down and not a surprise just mad I spend $20 on this bottle."
"Mouthfeel is light with carbonation that is on the higher side."
"It is a pleasure to drink a beer that takes chances. This one is bitter and funky. It reminds me of changing, small Belgian brews that seem to be regularly different. I have no idea whether or not this beer will be different the next time I drink it (there will be a next time) but when I drink something that is circumstantially satisfying I am pleased . I've drank a lot of beer. I know safe when I taste it. This isn't safe. It's tasty."
"drinkability is great. i expected more funk and sourness, but found a nice, balanced, and very drinkable belgian pale. that said, i'm really looking forward to seeing this one develop and ""funkify"" with time."
"Drinkability- Wasn't what I was expecting and hoping for, but still turned out to be a quality beer that I would pick up again. $9.99 is about the right price."
"Mouthfeel is light and airy and does a great job when paired with some creamy herb chevre as a palate cleanser. Highly drinkable and drinks very much like a summer Saison. If the price wasn't so prohibitive this would be a great brew to have more often."
"D-You definitely need to like this type of beer, or it would probably fall low on your totem. Not a beer for everyone, but I really like it and am so happy that a bigger craft brewer like Ommegang is going wild."
"Hazy golden - maybe darker. Nose of slightly mineral/ minty/ sour brett. Flavor is almost like the rinse and spit cup at the dentist's office - in a very good and intriguing way. I have never tasted the brett character quite as refined and focused this way. Clean malt with a little straw character. This is very classy and sharp. Little actual sourness/ funk, but more minty/ earthy with the brett funk staying behind a bit, yet infusing throughout."
"Winemakers won't want to come within 20 yards of this, but for the rest of us, this would be very drinkable. Alcohol is not completely hidden by a long shot, similar to a triple, but a very drinkable triple. Another outstanding effort from Ommegang. I have another bottle...should probably let it sit for a while, but it will be tough to not open it."
"We shared a bottle during a BYOB sarod and tabla concert. I knew I'd rather have it with some food, but found it to be a nice pairing to the music. It is, as these things go, a bit of a peculiar brew. It's rather saison-y, with the added brett. Pleasantly complex but not overly tremendous or anything-- I won't trade in the Euro wild beers for this, but I'd have it again, sure. Cost is reasonable. Nice effort from Ommegang."
"I got a bottle in September, it poor 's nice, cloudy, smell refreshing, a tasted good, with a taste of ethyl , that was no surprise as it is supposed to, the taste was well balanced the taste the ethyl, the aroma, great beer. I split the bottle with a cousin."
"Reminds me a lot of a saison, but with a lot more character and varied taste. A great brew from Ommegang, almost on par with Hennepin."
"Don't drink and review."
"This beer pours a beautiful, somewhat clear golden amber. It did not have much head, but this could have been a result of the bartender letting it settle. Aroma is strong and malty with a citrus hint. Flavor is rich, mainly malty, with a good hoppy nip and something of an alcohol bite. Aftertaste is smooth but edgy."
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" white head over the cloudy golden brew. Head falls relatively quickly, and lace is delicate and falls rapidly. Aroma is light spicing and pale sweetness, with an undercurrent of funk. Taste follows the nose, except there is a tartness that rides under it all. Mouthfeel and drinkability are quite pleasing. This one comes off at this stage as reasonably approachable, perhaps a starter funk brew. Who knows what some age would do..."
"Overall a nice treat that I'll look out for."
"Drinkability: I'd say this brew is very middle of the road in its creation. Newbies to the style could easily approach this beer without much trepidation. I myself would prefer to age it for a few years to see where the brett takes it. Maybe the hops would drop out and the funk would dominate. This is a great beer from a great brewery."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/4"" white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale malt scent along with a hint of hops and mild sourness. The Belgian yeast and the hops blend nicely with one another. The taste is decent. It has a very plain taste to it. There are pale malts and Belgian yeast esters along with a nice warming in the finish. The Brett yeast is very faint as well as the hops. It's a good drinker with a dry earthy element, but it really doesn't knock me over like I was expecting. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker. It has some subtle complexities, but I was expecting more. However, this is a fine offering, but probably thier weakest beer."
"Pours a bright golden pale orange with a nice fluffy white head that dissipated into a nice cap leaving some nice chunky lacing. The smell is of lemon and apples, white pepper and very light coriander. A nice light Belgian funk smell. The taste starts off sweet, hints of lemon, honey and pear, light grainy malt and grassy hop. The feel is moderate and fizzy, well balanced, and finishes with a very subtle sourness. Alcohol is well hidden. Another great brew from a great brewery. A Belgian pale ale with a zing and some light characteristics of a saison."
"OK short review ""Not as Good As Hennepin."" Longer summary the Brett seems to kill the spirit of the beer here. It doesn't taste bad exactly it just isn't as good as its older brother Hennepin."
"Appearance is nice, a cloudy yellow with a moderate head. Floral aroma, funky in a grassy sense, not too horse blankety at all...At all. Taste is a bit of sharp funk and alcohol up front, but it eases back into that nice heennepin taste very quickly and remains that way for the rest of the bottle. Mouthfeel is nice, a good blend of carbonation and smoothness, that again, reminds me of their saison. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol comes through a bit. Acutally, this reminds me very much of how Avec Les Bon Voux (sp) compares to the regular Dupont. That being said, at 12 dollars a bottle, I'd rather buy 2 Hennepins. A nice beer, but nothing special I'm afraid."
" Overall I was more then impressed with this one. It really gave me a good feeling and was by far my favorite Ommegang brew to date. Now this was a different kind of Belgian for me, something that was light, fruitier, and hoppier then what I normally associate and I loved every minute of it. I really have to find me way to get more of this as soon as I can, this could easily become one of my more favorite brews, definitely need to get ahold of this one if you can, really well put together, and honestly almost a new style entirely. Highly recommended."
"D- This brew was good-but it still has a long way to go. I wish I would have taken the time to age it properly. I love what Ommegang comes up with and I can't wait to have Chocolate Indulgence what it becomes available."
"THanks to dispholidus1 for bringing this to MCD. Yellow and translucent with detritus. small white head. Soft, tart odor with wheaty, bernyard notes. Taste is very dry with fruity notes that develop as it warms. Lemony, citric acid taste with a not-quite fully developed brett character. Quite sour on the finish. medium bodied. Nice, moderately complex, enjoyable beer."
"D: I usually love wild ales, but not this one. The flavor is lacking any sort of complexity and just doesn't do it for me. I'll pass on this next time."
"D- tasty and intriguing, not quite as tart as expected, easy to drink, worth a try"
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a shallow bubbly white head that fades quickly with little lacing left behind. There is a significant amount of sediment on the bottom of the bottle that is not easily disturbed. The smell is a solid fresh bright Belgian yeast with lemony citrus character. Light-Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated and supplemented by a tingle of bitterness on the roof and tip of the tongue. The flavor begins brightly as a tart lemon. The mouth finishes dry and remnants of the sour taste linger appropriately. I don't favor beverages that have a dry finish, but i'd recommend trying this one out. While well hidden in the muoth, the 8% ABV is real."
"I really wanted to love this one, but I'm just not that impressed. I'd take Supplication or La Roja over this one any day of the week. In addition, this is considerably more expensive than other Ommegang beers (like almost 3 times the cost), which I find a little odd. That being said, it is a well made beer, and I'm happy to see Ommegang trying something new. I'd recommend others to try it, but I won't be rushing out to buy another bottle...."
"Pours a nice glowing peachy color with a thinner off white head. First aroma I noticed immediately was a flinty/gunpowder kind of earthy aroma with a background of skunk (I mean the animal, not light-strickenness). Not off-putting but a little unusual. The bottle we were splitting was pretty green, so I'd assume some aromas will mellow with age. Flavor was mostly hop bitterness upfront, a bit of orangy sweetness/citrusiness nearer the finish. Maybe some touches of spearmint leaves. Very earthy. As it warmed, the alcohol showed up a little more and the finish could be described a being a bit like ""hairspray"". A pretty nice beer that I'll be sure to try agian after it has some age behind it."
"I'll need to pick up another to cellar and compare."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish / pale yellow color with a white head. Aromas of a dry tartness and a Belgian yeastiness. In the taste, hops upfront and a tart yeastiness. A smooth small bitterness in the mouthfeel, with a hoppy tart aftertaste. A nice tartness with hops, although, I think it needs more age. It does get more balance when it warms up."
"I was excited to hear about this beer and I hope that the wide distribution of Ommegang will help increase the appreciation of the style. While this beer is not all that sour now, another year in the botttle should help the brett do its work. I'll try it again then as well. Pours a hazy yellow with a moderate initial head that fades to a thin cap. Lacing is slight. The smell is an interestinginterplay of brett sourness and barnyard, slightly sweet malt, and some floral notes. The taste is very interesting as well. The combination of brett and bitter hops makes an interesting pairing. Fruity and a little sour up front, then a long citrusy bitterness from the hops, followed by a faint floral and bready sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is effervescent, relatively crisp, and refreshing. Drinkability is great- each sip gives you something new and it goes down easy. 8% abv? Can't tell. My favorite offering from this brewery so far."
"Very well done. This was probably too young as the Brett has not fully emerged but quite tasty and enjoyable nonetheless."
"Not sure what all the talk is about on this one. Thin and lacking complexity. I could drink it long and often but just missing something for me. A slight sweet tart sugar thick white pepper with the same lemony rind. A good showing of alcohol in the chest with a puckery finish. A nice drinker but nothing I'd go search for."
"It seems that I could not wait until I got my hands on this beer. Finally available on the shelves of Central KY retailer shelves. Although the lable suggests to celler this beer for 6 months - 2 years... hell with it, I drink now! The beer opens with an airy and carbonated pour into the chalice. A brightly colored, canary yellow brew chased an airy rocky head quickly to the top of the glass. The head settles to a film and lasts the session. No hints of thickness, or gravity; but a thin look of champaign, with a solid beer look. Aromas of mild pilsner malts and aggresive dry-hopping set the tone for a very tart (slight of sour), vineous, berry, woodsy, sweaty, funky goodness character. Flavors skipped right by a mild sweetness and right to a very complex yeast, estery, peppery, musty, bitter, citrus concoction. all rolled into tastes of lemons, granny-smith apples, good pilsner malty flavors, earthy / grassy hops. A touch of dish soap flavors ride on the edge of complexity / deterant. Finishes very airy and soft, with a background astringency and increasing sourness. The Brett yeast certainly has a grip on this beer, but leaves a lot of hearty beer character to be enjoyed. This beer is certainly on par with the best of Jolly Pumpkin's. Can't wait til this bottle matures."
"This is a fine wild ale and one I would suggest newcomers try before moving on to weirder stuff."
"D-I really enjoyed this one and will be coming back for more."
"D: very smooth and easy, and disappeared easily even with 8% hiding in it."
"Drinkability: Crisp, tasty with a refreshing dryness in the finish."
"Excellent drinkability -- would be an excellent pairing with poultry or light fish."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a nice fluffy head that left almost no webbing. Strong citrus smell with hints of sour fruits maybe and some pepper? The taste is wheaty, dry, not too hoppy. Like the smell it has citrus and sour fruit. Overall pretty good, pretty refreshing and a very solid beer. Ommegang doesn't disappoint."
"A unique blend of an American Wild Ale and dry hopping that I think did not blend well together. Bland, very phenolic with intense spiciness at times. Interesting to try, but not one I would go back to."
"D - Highly drinkable. This beer could make a good introduction to the world of wild beers for an uninitiated craft beer drinker. It is easily drinkable and has a nice funky brettanomyces character without being too sour or earthy. The dry hopping made for an interesting beer, but I can't quite decide if it was successful in this case. On one hand the hop flavor seems to accentuate the earthiness of the wild yeast, but at the same time I can't help but think that the hop flavor may be so strong that it masks some of the complexity of the yeast and leaves the beer a bit unbalanced. In any case, I plan to pick up another bottle of this and let it age for six months or so to see how the character develops."
"My first foray into the American Wild Ale territory to be honest Iam not a big fan of the ""funk"" but I have wanted to try this style for some time.Poured into an oversized wine glass a slight hazed dull light golden with a hint of orange hue a lacey 1/2 finger white head atop,there is some definant funk in the nose with a bit of iron and lemon pith.Not as much funk as I envisioned on the palate yeah there is a bit of barnyard there but it is just part of the package I pick up a big dose of citrus and toasty malt a light iron note as well,with a lingering vinegar type flavor.I like it maybe a little more conservative than many of the style I dont know but this was interesting...in a good way."
"The bottle does say to cellar 6 months for maximum enjoyment and to cellar for up to two years. Okay okay... twist my arm... I'll get another bottle and try it again."
"That said, at $12 a bottle, it's not going to become a regular staple in my household anytime soon. I'm glad to have tried it this one time, but next time I'm reaching for a Hennepin or a Rare Vos -- they're far more economical, and just as good, if not better."
"Very good but I prefer Hennepin to this."
"D: This is definitely worth trying at least once. Not an everyday beer, but worth enjoying if you want something a little different."
"Batch #1, June 2007. 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice white head. The aroma is malty and slightly tart with some funk, citrus and leather. The taste feautres some malt with spices and a touch more of the funkiness. Overall, this brew is one of the best I have had all year and really stands out as one of the finest Belgian style beers this side of the pond. Highly recommended."
"Chalky dry mouthfeel. Plenty of carbonation. Very refreshing and tasty. Not armageddon on the palate as the label would imply."
"As wild ales go, this one isn't over the top at all, and honestly that's what I like about it. It actually uses all you typical Belgian Golden or Triple flavors and blends it well with the wild ale/natural lambic type tastes. It has huge peaks and subtle valleys and they all work well together. A welcome addition to the ommegang line."
"P.S. I wouldn't consider this a beer for people that don't like crafts or appreciate Belgian style. I'd call it an intermediate level of taste."
"D- This beer has some nice fruity flavors to the malt with a faint hint of Brett. I would like to try this beer after a few years to see if the Brett flavors come though stronger. This beer has nice qualities of tripel but I would like to taste this with more wild ale flavors."
"Very nice beer from Ommegang."
"this is one of a few wild american beers i have had and it is by far one of the best."
"Mouth: Very strong carbonation immediately upon entering the mouth. Dry and chalky, slightly tart, with a nickel like finish. Grape flavors come through but for the most part this beer is super dry, almost champagne like in taste and mf, except for the metallic finish. Quite hoppy. Interesting warmth that appears long after the swallow. The mouthfeel is tremendous but the flavors are lacking."
"D: A good beer from Ommegang, I was expecting more though, a good and tasty beer, just not at the excellence that I find in Ommegang's other beers, easy to drink though."
"D: A very tasty rendition of an exotic Belgian style. Nothing to be sought after, but a good beer to try when you want something new"
"Pours a peachy orange with a fluffy white head that reduces fairly quickly, leaving some lacing behind. The smell was a little bit funky/skunky as advertised with some spices too. Taste was peppery with a tart fruitiness with a funky almost bitterness that hits you on the far finish after it's already gone down. Was light and snappy in terms of mouthfeel. Very complex, interesting beer that I'm glad I tried. Not one that I'll seek out all the time for enjoyment, but certainly one you want to sample for the experience."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with a nice head that has great retention. The aroma is spicy, citrus, and some wheat-beer characters. The flavor starts out as a slightly spicy and smooth belgian with some citrus thrown in, but it finishes with a very smooth and mellow brett character. It seems that they threw the brett yeast into the secondary so the sourness only comes across on the finish. The body is medium and the drinkability is great. I'll have this one many times in the future."
"This beer is definitely not retired, the bottle says Batch 1, June 2007. My first ""wild ale"" was an interesting brew, not super funky or sour, actually quite accessible. I'm glad I tried it."
"Drinkability - this is good ale, but its taste is not really that of a session beer, it is more of a sipper, and one that might go well as an after-dinner beer. Also, this is listed here as having been retired, but it seems to have been re-released, at least temporarily, as there were many cases of it at the store where I bought it."
"The label had a an ominous red mushroom cloud on it, but thankfully uncorking this 750 ml bomber did not produce a bottle bomb gushing over my table. Instead the gentle smooth carbonation opened up to form a three finger tall head in the Duvel tulip I had selected for this review. The beer looked mostly clear, except for a slight yeast haze, and the smell was spicy and floral. The taste indicated that Ommengang had kept the Brettanomyces introduction in check, and the beer was tart without being funky. The tartness was accompanied by an old cheese like earthy flavor and both were balanced by the candi sugar, pale malt, and herbal and floral hops. Not quite as dry or spicy as the true handiworks of Belgian yeast, this was still quite a bit less sweet than most other American takes on the style. Very light and airy in the mouth, as intended I suppose. A great rare find from my local package store (Windward Beverage Mart). Way too easy to drink up despite the 8% ABV."
"Served a nice hazy yellow with a decent head that diminished rather quickly but left decent lacing on the glass. The aroma was of spice with a bit of sweet fruit as well. The taste was nowhere near as sour as Russian River Temptation. More along the lines of a yeasty Saison. The beer was very crisp and refreshing, however. This one is very enjoyable, but like anything of the style, it's a little pricey."
"D - I wish I would have consumed this closer to the 6 month recommendation for max brett funk. I thought it was good but a little light on the funk."
"Not a bad beer but not as distinctive as the label and pedigree would promise."
"I didn't know what I was getting into when I bought this for $12.99. I was expecting a few more flavors to creep out, and I was drinking most of it at room temperature. But it's smooth flavor and champagne-like texture were invigorating to me. I'm sure you can still find a few bottles of this sitting around somewhere, and if you do, get one."
"After having this beer on tap the other night at the Sunset Grill and Tap, I was compelled to seek out a bottle. Label says it is batch #1 from June of 07. Pours a golden, slightly murky color, with a small heading, The aroma has a very dry champaign sort of character, as well as a light sour smell reminiscent of a chardonnay. When first hitting the palate, it has a very carbonated champaign flavor, but after letting it explore the palate a bit, some of that initial sharpness fades away to tart fruit, and then ends on a dry bitter note. Pretty light to medium in body. I can't taste any of the 8% ABV, but I am starting to feel it. For me, this was a very drinkable ale as well. This is a cool beer in my book. It might not be as funky or out there as some of the Cantillon beers employing wild yeast strains, but still an interesting move for Ommegang."
"Saw this on tap and had to give it a shot. Looks cloudy golden orange with a nice offwhite head. Smells of pine, spice, some hops, citrus, cloves. Tastes tart, has earth tones, some hops, very floral. Delicous fruit, kind of reminds me of Fin Du Monde. Feels full and foamy, finishes a little dry. Tasty brew, especially on tap. I wont seek it out but I def wont turn away from it."
"My girlfriend brought me this beer back from her recent trip to New York. Ommegeddon pours a hazy light copper with a thin foamy head. From the aroma I would almost guess this was a wit, it has a slightly sour yeasty smell with a vague hint of corriander, although I might be imagining it. The flavor is delicious, dry and refreshing, lots of light malt flavor despite the dryness. Hop flavor is present but not overdone, nice and balanced. There is some funkiness from the Brett. The finish is exceptional, full bodied despite being dry and refreshing."
"Note: This was a freshly released bottle. Added review after 6-12 months."
"Drinkability was quite good."
"Batch #1, June 2007 bottle. Evidently not retired- just back in action. Hazy golden color with white effervescent head that quickly settles down to lacy. Smell is clean Belgian, fresh and quick with slight spice. Taste is quick and direct with citric, white pepper, banana, funk, alcohol. Flavor action very quick. Finish has mild hops and is quite dry. This is a quick-flavor beer and very drinkable. Hot days be damned."
"D - This tastes, in all honesty, like a Hefeweizen from a can. I know that sounds odd, but by the time I had grown accustomed to the other, ""off"" flavors, that's what I was picking up - and it's not cross-contamination on the palate or anything, this was the first I had had. Either way, it's very drinkable, but not for 11.99 a bottle. Definitely something everyone should try once, though."
"On tap at the Blue Nile. This brew arrived in a Westmalle chalice. The beer is a hazy pale orange/golden straw color. The head is half an inch in height, and receded rather slowly living nice lacing. The aroma is very yeasty with a lot of pepper and a fiant yet noticable acidic twang. The taste is more balance than the aroma. It seems just as peppery, but the acidic sourness comes through a little more giving the beer more strucure and character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, I was hoping this beer would me more sour than it is. However, I still enjoyed it, and will again if given the opertunity."
"Another Ommegang delight!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: a wonderfully tasty beer that is pretty is to quaff. Great beer I wish I could see around more often."
"D - Damn good. An awesome saison, I wouldn't mind having this one again . . . if I can find it!"
"Hard to characterize. Some aspects of a saison, some of a trippel, and maybe a wild wheat. Enjoyable, but not something I would rush back to try again."
"On tap last night at Ommegang night at the Belgian Room/Hop Devil grill, NYC, poured very cloudy apricot, with a finely knit tiny bubble head, and leaving stringy tight webs of lacing. Nose was strongly of bubble gum, cotton candy and a slight barnyard funkyness. This a freshly fruity brew, with notes of melon, funky yeasty goodness and moderate brett sourness in the mid section and finish. Biting, crisping and drying hops also in the finish, wrap this one up. My kind of brew, fruity, musty, funky, yeasty, fresh and clearly complex...BelgianSaison/wit/triple lovers go get some of this ASAP and tell Ommegang to bottle large amounts...."
"I'm a big fan of Ommegang, and this one isn't the most drinkable of their brews, but it's definitely a fun one to try if you have a chance. (N.B., though this beer is categorized as retired, I found it at an Ommegang event in New York on August 23, 2006.)"
"Can we say winner? Ommegangs new farmhouse, wild saison is a sight to behold, slightly cloudy pale golden with a thick cap of white froth topping it off like the top layer of a dairy queen blizzard. Head retention is nice as well. Aromas are all funky farmyard brett and some other wheaty yeasty notes as well. Hopping is light and just serves to give a bitter end and dryer spirtzy finish. Taste is funky as hell, sweet and sour almost, a good vs evil sort of story with the brett winning control, slowly but surely. A real brett bomb, this one is. Mouthfeel is sharp spritzy and dry at the end leading to a wonderful drinkability. Possibly the most ""summery"" tasting wild/farmhouse ale i've tasted as of yet. I can just imagine how much better this one will taste outdoors at their brewery! It's a real show stopper and I can't wait until it is brewed again and gets some wider distribution!"
"Recently tried this one at the extreme beer fest. Had no idea ommegang was even attempting a wild beer. Bright yellow color, like a supped-up wit. Brett in the nose. On first taste it definetly had a wheat component, directly followed up with the classic sweaty horse that brett imparts. Not much if any sour/lactic flavors, with the brett playing starring role in the wild yeast department. If you are into beer's feral side than this is one to try(if you can get your hands on it, if you do, let me know where you found it). I believe the guy who poured it for me said it was around 8% abv, but you would never guess when you were drinking it. If i had to put some label as to category, it would fall into the experimental saison. I wonder if this is anything like they used to brew for farm hands?"
