"Prairie coming in hard again with this delicious cherry sour. Loved it."
""

"O: A very polished drinking experience with an exceptional smoothness per style. Acidic, nice burst of sour cherries. There's much to be said about the smooth brewed nature of this beer, crisp, sharp in flavor, yet very graceful with a good level of sourness while maintaining optimal drinkability levels."

"Overall: I love this beer. It's sessionable with a good level of complexity. Reminds me of a good cider. I'm  very impressed by Prairie's offerings!"

""
"Overall: This is an excellent brew, and the flavors evolve and become better as it warms"

"Poured into a pilsner glass. Red tinted gold color that retains a good head.  The unfiltered sediment looked like dried out and chopped cherries. The cherries immediately hit the nose, but no funkiness smell. The cherries provide a stronger sweetness than tartness.  Immediate cherry taste on the tip of the tongue with a nice tartness at the back of the tongue.  There was no sourness or yeastiness expected from a funky standpoint.  Taste is close to balanced, with sweetness slightly stronger than the tartness.  Moderate carbonation and a medium-light body.  It didn't have much yeast or alcohol kick. Good cherry sour, could be have better funk. Solid beer."

"On tap at Crust Stone Oven Pizzeria in Davenport, IA. Beautiful ruby red color. Tart but not too sour. Cherry character is pleasantly apparent but not overpowering."
""
"Great sweet cherry nice bitter sour tart excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a light reddish color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of tart cherry notes with light oak notes is quite nice. Taste is also dominated by tart cherry notes with some light acidity noticeable. Body is average with good carbonation. Love the fact that this beer was very easy to drink while presenting a good level of complexity."

"Great beer, I'd recommend this to any beer drinker that wants to experiment with wild ales and funky beers."

"It's loaded with cherry and funk. It's solid."

"Bottle from Tipples. A slight gusher here but not too bad. Pours light pinkish orange with a big bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. Big vinegar aroma, definite tart cherries in there, sweet cherry juice, dry aroma, some vanilla or oak notes. Flavor is lightly tart cherries, a bit sweet, not much funk or lacto sourness here. Sort of like fizzy cherry juice. Light bodied at first but the cherry comes off a little syrupy, big carbonation, prickly on the tongue. This doesn't taste bad by any means, but not Prairie's best effort as it lacks the funk and other sour notes one would expect from a beer like this."
""
"Pours a deep reddish color with an off white head.  Aroma of sour cherries and red wine vinegar.  Acetic in taste with slight souring tartness and sour cherries.  Decent strength and good to style.  Just a touch of sugary malts and a lemon rind element with sour cherry following.  Full bodied yet crisp and bright.  Very nice, simple flavor and good at that."
""
"Falls a bit short in a few areas but overall a very solid and natural-tasting sour."
"Pours a clear pink, with a thin off-white head.  Aromas of sour cherry and a hint of grain.  Taste is an initial light cherry flavor, followed by some grain, then an acidic funk, finishing with a tart, sour dry earthy flavor.  Mouth feel is average. Overall a good sour ale."

"This beer is neither sour, cherry-like, or very funky. Pretty disappointing!"
""

""
""
"O â€“ An excellent wild/Brett beer, great base flavor profile and very (all too) easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Gorgeous clear pink beer with about 1/2"" of head on the pour. Not great head retention. Beer smells of must, hay , light funk, and a hint of tart lemons and cherries. On the palate it has light, tame funk notes, a bit of tartness and cherry notes, and surprisingly little else. Not much in the way of malt to back or any real sourness to take it over the top.  Feel is light and effervescent, pretty good. Overall, decent, but doesn't have that extra gear to make it truly memorable."
""
" The taste has a very nice cherry flavor that is slightly tart with mild yeast funkiness in the back with slightly low malt flavor with gently alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with a mostly dry quality with spicy finish. The taste of the cherry works well with the funk in the taste w/out any cherry cough syrup type flavor bu more lemony cherry type combo -in that it is tangy and finishes in a refreshing way. Overall -Excellent cherry beer with mild funk in the flavor it seems to me like a beer inspired by Belgian Lambic as the fruit flavor is prominent and this was a nice treat for me for a wednesday in the 'Burg before Christmas. I would definitely want to see if there is any diference in the bottle version -great cherry taste."

"Murky light brown with a fingernail of off white head covering the top.  Vibrant carbonation bubbles are present within.  Aroma is Brett and very tart cherries.  The flavor is Brett with tart cherries at the back of the palate.  This breaks heavily carbonated and crisp."
""
""
""
"Light cherry, wood, and I'm guessing only one batch so at this point would expect more funk. Lots of light malty wheat and pilsner like flavor. Light tartness. Good but lacking."
""
""
"A very slightly, funky version of Maraschino cherry juice. Finishes clean and dry. It's ok, but lacking in flavor(Funkiness or tart)."

"Nice and refreshing but not what expected from these guys.  Not the depth of yeast characters and even the cherry is a little background.  Nothing special about it.  That being said its still a nice sipper"

""

"Yeah. Not poison, but not the most pleasant. It's tolerable like Del Taco when hungover, but all things considered, Raul would not venture with the Funk again."
""
""
"O-This is a decent beer, but not one that I would go out of my way to hunt down. It is cherry and it is funky, so you get what you pay for, but there is nothing in this beer that blows me away or sets it apart from other fruited brett beers."
""
""
"Better than the reviews claimed. I enjoyed this one a lot."

"Not sure if this bottle was bad, but if it wasn't - it wasn't good.  Little metallic and very muted flavors of cherry or any funk.  Didn't finish it."

"O- Overall kind of pricy and the finish hurts this beer.  Worth trying once, but won't seek out again."

"O: A pretty solid, well made, and flavorful beer. Not as overpowering as some sour beers, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
"Similar to Petrus, lighter and not as sour."
""
""

"Solid, not overly sourly, sweet, wild cherry, candy sours, sweet tarts.  Some bite on the mouthfeel. Crisp finish."

"This is the one sour where it's vast simplicity is its glory and it's downfall. The flavor is Funky Cherry, easily drinkable and easily enjoyable. This simplicity helps it be accessible but I'd rather see a bit more pucker, a bit more sour and a bit more sweet. Don't get me wrong, this is very good but I feel like it could have been even more."

"so, reading all the other reviews.... this stuff is a giant bomb. and I fell for it, too. it was on my radar and when I saw it I purchased it....."

"It's an overall odd meld with a big fruit beer American character, stuck inside a wild that seems to be scrambling to get out and show it's character.  Nice combination, but the marriage needs to be better."

"Overall: a drinkable funky sour, but it lacks a certain je ne sais quoi for me.  Maybe a more prominent cherry character, or a cleaner funkiness?  It's hard to say.  Not at all bad, but not mind-blowing."

"O:  disappointing ... tastes like nothing more than starndard farmhouse ale/saison ... the cherries is false advertising.  the color is awesome (it really looks PINK as you pour it), and there's not a hint of alcohol taste, so it's not a total loss -- just no cherry presence at all."

"O: For being a wild ale, this is pretty tame."
"Overall pretty good with some nice layered fruit notes, but a few odd notes kind of keep it from being better. Worth trying."
"O: Meh, perhaps the least impressive Prairie offering to date (save the disappointing Prairie Hop). I would not have again or recommend."

"Somebody put the colors of tanned orange and pink flesh together in one liquid. Not much of a head or retention above. The aroma of lemon tartness arises with an addition of cherries. Cherry lemonade anyone? This is especially more true with a taste. Cherry Funk doesn't provide much cherry or funk when compared to the tidal wave of tart lemonade. And more tart lemonade. Dabs of cherry and a vague funkiness don't make much of a mark here; it's a singular tart beer without much variation, and for that reason I'm not floored by Cherry Funk."

"On tap at The Refuge in San Carlos. Light Amber color. Small head. Smell is lightly dilly, lightly fruity. Taste is not funky at all, contrary to the name. Fruity hard candy notes, but dry. Light body."

"i want to like this a lot more than i do, really nothing special here. only a half decent use of cherries, they taste old and bland rather than tart and fresh and enlivening. pale muted pink color, almost brown when away from the light, and the head dies quickly. this is maybe the least impressive prairie beer i have had, an equalizer if you will. nose and taste are less cherry and more wheat malt than expected, wine-like, which is better in smell than taste. cherries are a little medicinal in the finish, and the beer is a little too boring to support that. alcohol is also stronger than it needs to be. this one just seems sloppy, and for a brewery capable of pure magic, this lets me down hard. its a good beer, plenty of brett character and all, but its just not up to their enormously high standard. meh overall for me."

"Excellent tart cherry flavor, with light must. Good sour notes, fairly lactic and acetic. Not notably funky, which suits my palate. Light sweetness, but the balance is sour and tart."

"Maybe I got too excited when I saw 'Funk' in the title, but this wasn't funky enough. The cherry doesn't pop, the sour is mild, and the tart lingers in an odd fashion that becomes dry after a few sips. It just needed more of something to make it stand out."

"In closure, the acidity really latches on and creates a simple sour flavor to strip the palate of thirst and brings a highly refreshing finish. Though medium-light for a sour, Cherry Funk trails with cherry, cider, brine and lime but only for a fleeting glimpse."

"Decent, yet mild sour taste. No carbonation or bite that I'd like to see in most sours."

"Over priced for what it is, but I still really enjoyed this beer. I am starting down this sour road so this was a fun beer to try out and get a taste for. I likely wont be getting another unless it is for trading purposes."
"Follow-up: Sampled again 10-Sep-14 from a bottle, poured into a Riedel Vinum Zinfandel glass. More enjoyable than draft with more interesting yeast and barnyard character in the smell and taste, and less pronounced medicinal notes. Also a fuller, longer lasting head and lace."

"Poor showing from Prairie IMO. Weak cherry, weak sour funk. Overpriced for what it is. 1 and done on this offering."
""
"Ugh, I love me some sours, but this is over barring.  Biting acidity that cuts through any nuance that might be here.  I love Prairie, but this is a little to intense, even for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy cherry red pour with some orange and pink highlights and a small pink head. Light aroma of cherries and funk. Dry and tart taste upfront with white wine grapes and cherries the main flavors. Light body also has some yeast flavors present as well. Medium carbonation and light acidity. Finishes with a mildly tart, wet flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden/amberish body with a white head that quickly fades. The smell is of Lactobacillus tartness and a little bit of wheat. Smell really reminds me of a Berliner Weisse. There is a slight Lacto tartness, with a strong amount of cherries. The mouthfeel has a nice tingle in the jaw and on the back of the tongue."

"Great Sour Ale. Pours a pale pink with zero head. Goes down smooth silk and tastes like nothing else I've had. Excellent brew"
"Overall, not a bad beer. I think the price point at $10 a bottle is a bit much, something I have noticed with Prairie, the prices are going up! Not sure why? Anyways, A great beer for a warm day.  Like another review said, if your looking for a beer that will make you pucker, this is not it. Its a crisp, refreshing AWA with a perfect hint of cherries and tarty finish.  I enjoy it, still, the Funky Gold Mosaic is my preferred Wild Ale from Prairie."
"Drinks very easy, ABV seems much lower. If you like them really sour, this may disappoint, made me very happy"
