The flavor is crisp and lightly tart. It's just enough to make your mouth water a bit. I got light fruit notes at first, light apple, similar to a cider or white wine. This beer is so drinkable and shares similarities to a much lesser alcohol wild beer or geuze, it's surprising this is a nearly 7% beer.","Buttermilk","Feb 18, 2015"

I think that I would have this a little colder than I did on this one. It was only about 60F when I drank it, somewhere around 50F would be better for sure. For the price of this (this bottle was 12 oz and cost $18) isn't worth it unless you are really into sours. If you see it for a decent price it's not bad.","BeerEngineer","May 06, 2014"

Picking up some green apple and grapes. Getting a lot of these flavors in the taste. Not too sour, slightly tart with some apple, peach, grape flavors up front and some nice carbonation to make it tingle on the tongue. A little bit of Brett and funk but mostly dominated by fruit flavors. An amazing balance, really. Also some hay/grass flavor mixed in around all the other flavors. My second RR sour and, once again, I've very impressed.","Mikeypnh","Apr 24, 2014"

Sour apple aroma, vinegar, lots of Brett. Nice Brett on the flavor with sweet citrus fruits and lemon peel, some pears and green apples. Tart and lactic but not mouth puckering sour to deal with here. Very light and goes down easy with near spritzy carbonation. Really nice Brett beer that I would definitely have again.","BMMillsy","Feb 28, 2014"

4.62,6.7,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured a nice cloudy gold with a one finger white head that grew to a two finger white head and stayed around as a ring of white as the glass was emptied, leaving some thin lacing. Abundant bubbles flowed up the side of the glass. Quite beautiful. Scents of brett, barnyard funk, white grape skin, white wine, overripe fruit, green apple, slight pineapple, and the slightest hints of vanilla and candi sugar. A very good aroma, complex with the usually sour, fruity, white wine notes and some more common Belgian notes beneath. Flavor is sour upfront, with that musky brett funk, white grapes, tart green apple, lemon juice, sourdough bread undertones, some oak, some slight medicinal bitterness, finishes bitter with a bit of a citrus rind flavor and aftertaste as well as a dry finish. A very sour flavor, with all sorts of sour fruit and sour funk flavors. Very nice with some complexity brought in by the sourdough bread and oak. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a nice refreshing feel with a drying finish. Nice and drinkable, on point for a sour, very good. Overall this is a very good sour. The 100% brett gives it that incredibly sour flavor but it manages a bit of complexity in spite of it, that gives it a fine flavor profile. Very good, and I wish I could get it easier.","Auraan","Oct 12, 2013"

The smell of the beer gives off a sour note as well as a nice subtle malt essence in there also. The taste of the beer is really well balanced between the sour elements and the beer itself. It's got a very good 1 - 2 punch going from sour to malty. The mouthfeel is light bodied and very drinkable, this is also on the refreshing side. Overall this Russian River brew hits many of the high notes it should and it worth checking out. Glad I finally got to try it.","Knapp85","May 26, 2013"

Well, unless you find one of these you may never know, it is that unique. It is really sour, almost as if they dosed it with lemon zest, and the result is a treasure. It is not the most beautiful beer I've ever seen, the head is average, the ABV is average but when this brew hits your palate you'll know what a sour blond is, it only takes a moment. WOW! OK, I admit that a trip to the RR Brewery helped, so I waited to review a bottle. The small taster at the home pub at RR was not enough to judge, but now that I have opened a bottle I am convinced that this is a world class ""occasional"" beer. Unlike those great IPAs, drinkable by the gallon, this one requires a bit of time to enjoy and savor in it's uniqueness. Lest it be confused, this is not a hop beer, it is a blond that happens to pucker, have I mentioned unique, yes try and you'll be aware that a real style can deliver. I have no idea, but I guess the brewmaster had a demonic possession and he just broke out of hell with Santification. Try it but be prepared to pucker and enjoy.","JimTeal","Beers"

3.85,-11.1,4,2.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Very cool, unique beer here. This brew pours hazy, light amber with some sediment and a very thin head. Smell is mostly of yeast and bretts, with some grapefruit, pear and apple. You can smell just how tart this beer is, and the taste is there to match. Tons of citrus (predominantly lemon and lime), tart and crisp, very refreshing served very cold. Fairly dry, and not overly acidic. Very light with tons of carbonation. Stimulates every taste receptor in your mouth and makes you salivate. Super clean finish, just leaves you wanting more. A little pricey, but super drinkable... this is a new favorite.","Samuel906","Feb 24, 2013"

From the time you pop the bottle your nose fills with this juicy, insanely funky beast of an aroma, with crisp paler malts, and an accompaniment of yeast, fruits, and musky components. These translate well through the taste buds, with a massive bittering tartness from the first drop to the last. The nicely retained head affords soft creaminess to every sip, and helps Sanctification hold up proudly amongst its brothers and sisters in the series.","TheBrewo","Feb 19, 2013"

Wild Ale. Though I am sometimes in the mood for a mouthpuckeringly sour beer, this beer is nothing like that and I could probably have one of these just about any time. This could actually be a pretty good intro beer to those who haven't yet ventured into the world of sours/wild ales. Really good and quite drinkable.","matttttYCE","0"

Looking back, I know i had my expectations all wrong, but at the same time, you can make the base malt a little more interesting. There really wasn't much to this beer that I could isolate as interesting. I love the idea of just fermenting with a bacteria though. Gotta give it to them for doing something that no other brewery has tried (to my knowledge). I think a real problem with this was that I had it too cold and in the wrong glassware. The small serving glasses that Harry's serves is more like a tiny Pilsener glass, when something like this would be much better in a globe or tulip glass with something to keep head retention. In my opinion, most beer is served too cold, and I feel it really hurt this beer in particular. Would try it again if someone had it in a bottle or served it properly, but I'm not going out of my way to find it.","Philousa","Apr 08, 2012"

3.92,-9.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip (batch 006... I think, the label is rather worn, though I am fairly certain). The beer pours a hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger white bubbly head with some retention and some lacing. The nose is that of a faint biscuit malt base with lemony citrus, apple and fig fruit tones together with a hint of funk in the yeast. The flavor begins with an immediate acidic assault on the palette. The fruit found in the nose then rushes in and mellows the acid a bit. As the beer warms the sour character becomes more prevalent as does a green apple flavor. Mildly bitter with a faint hint of a biscuit base. The beer finishes with a linger sour apple character on the tongue. Lighter bodied and dry in nature and very carbonated. Overall, this is a good beer, not my favorite wild from RR but not bad. A little too acidic for my preference but I wouldn't refuse another.","hopfacebrew","Mar 19, 2012"

Aromas of huge lemon, grass, sour apple, pepper, hay, bread, yeast spices, and nice funkiness. Great aromas here with fantastic balance. Not overly funky or sour with a great mix of all aromas. Taste of big sour apple, tart lemon, grass, hay, pepper, spices, bread, yeast spices, and funkiness. Lingering notes of tart apple, lemon, pepper, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Light acidity present on the finish as well, but is nicely balanced and not overpowering. Medium carbonation and body. Incredibly drinkable and smooth; great balance with the acidity. Incredibly crisp and clean body with a perfect amount of carbonation for the style. Alcohol is not noticed at all for 6.75% as expected. Overall this is a smooth and incredible wild ale.

There's about a finger and a half of of white head that lingers around for a minute or two before fading way. Not much is left in the way of lacing. The nose has a bit of light spiciness to it, but is largely dominated by earthy, wet hay brett funk. There's just a touch of cracker maltiness at the front of the flavor profile. Some definite lemon zestiness places off the spice notes from the nose, and the second half of the beer is 100% wild. It's mostly funky like the nose, but there is a slight tart edge to it. The body is dry, but not as bone dry as I might have expected. The carbonation is brisk and bubbly, lending some more excitement to the beer. Another great brew from the best wild ale producer in the country, and I look forward to having this beer again, maybe with a little more age to see what the brett can really do.","axeman9182","Dec 27, 2011"

It was still wonderfully sour, with a fantastic Brett character, but it wasn't rough around the edges (for better and worse). There seems to bet a light toast in the background, from either the barrel or barley, that makes a tasty complement to the ripping citrus sour. Mmm. What a sour.","tempest","Oct 16, 2011"

Lemony esters, a bit of light barnyard funk, hay, in the nose, grassy and floral hops. Taste replicates nose, light sourness balanced by tartness. Mouthfeel is just on the light side of medium, good effervescence. IMHO this is a great entry sour/American Wild, quite tasty (the base blonde helps) not overbearing and very drinkable. Well made.","jdense","Sep 17, 2011"

4,-7.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pour out medium yellow/orange with a slight haze. Head is white and like a dense foam. Retention is substantial and lacing is abundant. In the nose you get peaches, sweet clove spice, floral undertones, and a lemon zest also picking up some vinegar in the background. Taste reminds me of straight up lemon juice with grass and tart peach. There something there that I can't describe that I think most people refer to as funk. Very unique. The mouth feel is so damn soft and smooth. Carbonation is great with lots of fine bubbles. This beer is just plain awesome. My first America wild ale and my first Russian River beer.

3.91,-9.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is similar to the smell, a mid-level sourness on the front end with some considerable funk in the body of the beer and a nice, clean, dry finish. It's definitely well made, but in relation to their other offerings, the price, and reputation of the brewery this seems tame. I'll admit though, if it were cheap and available I'd drink the hell out of it, but that goes for a lot of others too.","Nashvillain","Aug 24, 2011"

Faint 1/4 inch head, with very little lacing. The taste is of citrus sour, with a tiny bit of malt sweetness. The sourness makes you go back for more. The tartness resonates on the pallet once it is gone from the mouth. Very easy to drink. I like this beer a lot, will continue to seek this one out.","biglobo8971","Aug 24, 2011"

A nice, moderate level of acidity gives this a very good level of bite. Medium carbonation and body, no alcohol at all here. Overall, although I tend to enjoy the barrel aged sours from RR best because of the complexity, this is very tasty and refreshing. Great for warm weather days.

This beer poured a straw, pale color with a thin white head. The aroma was similar to a tart chardonnay with notes of white grapes, sour apples, with some brett. The taste consisted of notes of what was mentioned in the aroma above, with the funk more in the forefront. There was a nice level of carbonation which coated the toungue on every sip. This beer was very drinkable compared to some of the other RR sours that were so tart that it would be difficult to have more than one in one sitting. Another solid beer by Russian River.","jonvan04","Jul 17, 2011"

It smells of light citrus, light yeast, some hay, light grapefruit, is lighty acidic and has what I'd describe as tartness, not so much sour. The flavors consist of sour grapefruit, sour apples, brett, lemons, and it has a nice tart and dry finish. It drinks light and only moderately dry.

Smells funky/musty from the Brett with some sour fruit notes as well. Taste is somewhat fruity all around with green apples and sour citrus fruits in harmony with the funk from the Brett. A good level of carbonation but I was expecting much more after the 4 inch head on the initial pour. Beer is pretty crisp with each sip but leaves a stickiness in the mouth as well.

Starts off a little bit sweet and fruity, full of apple and lemon tartness. Finishes dry, mildly lactic, and just slightly puckering. Refreshing beer on a sunny evening, great stuff. Mouthfeel is lively, bubbly, and dry. Overall this is another fantastic offering from RR.

Scent is all about the sour and funk... while being 100% brett, I would expect the funk to dominate, but it is there in perfect amounts while letting other components come through, the tart and sourness is welcome considering the yeast used. Hints of musty grain complete the profile. First sip is whats expected from the scent, great blend of tart and sour flavors with barnyard funk, musty wet straw and a kiss of riper watery fruit. Medium bodied, bubbly carbonation, dry and slightly puckering. A nice simply constructed beer that shows the quality of ingredients and crafstmenship are what makes a great beer.","rfgetz","Apr 14, 2011"

Pours nice golden orange color with small chunks of sediment noticeable, and a nice, sustaining thin white head and minimal lacing throughout the session. Aroma is sour but not as much as some of the other RR sours, and is more nuanced. Nose is also picking up a delicate blend of raw, funky brett, burlap, and barnyard hay with sour, acidic fruit notes of lemon peel, apricot, and peach with subtle notes of vanilla, white pepper, nutmeg, and belgian yeast. Flavor is some sour citrusy fruit tones that evolve as the beer warms, plenty of funk, woody, grassy, and somewhat cheesy. Medium bodied with a very dry finish. Sour, but not mouth puckeringly so like Supplication or Consecration. Flavor essentially mimics aroma with alot of sour fruit tones, but with a somewhat floral aspect after, to the dry finish. I am still not a big fan of sours, but this is obviously well-made from RR.","CuriousMonk","Mar 20, 2011"

Fruity and acidic but nothing to write home about. Finshes very clean. Within 30 seconds you don't remember what it tastes like. Hints of white wine but not tart it sour enough for me.

When I opened and poured this beer, it was definitely very funky, with the signature brett aroma. The lightly colored beer was as pale and effervescent as champagne but decidedly cloudier. And the nose revealed little more than brett. The palette was similar, it was a little tart, lemony, some mildewy straw, but that was about it. Though it was good, it didn't have as much complexity as I was anticipating. Perhaps this beer just needs some more time. It was easy drinking, but not a wow beer.","Soonami","Mar 01, 2011"

A nice whisp of foamy white head on top, some patches of stick on the upper reaches of the glass. Smell is pretty tame considering it's RR were dealing with. Pretty much a base blond beer with some brett scent and light fruits. Simple yet so nice. A very light sour, tastes of some Begian yeast (I believe Westmalle), earth, light biscuit, banana, semi tropics, sour brett which is more funky than all out sour at this point. Some nice lemon taste on the backend. I remember this being a bit more complex out of a batch 2 bottle so maybe Vinnie tweaked this some. Feel is light bodied and very refreshing.

Even though I know this is 100% Brett I taste some coriander and citrus peel, but initially it is all sour lemon and light funky goodness. As I drink on I find tropical fruit notes, like pinapple hanging around. Back end is earthy and filled with grass clippings. Dry, dry, dry. Too much to polish off a 750, luckly this is a 375!

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour apple, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour apple, tart, subtle fruit, and a dry funkiness on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent. Everything in this one seemed to be spot-on for what they were aiming for here in all aspects. Had an awesomely balanced flavor and great aroma going on here. I have yet to try a bad Russian River brew as of now and this one is no exception...

The taste is all about balance - not nearly as sour as I was expecting, which for the style, is not exactly what I'm looking for. Theres some lemon, but also some banana and clove. As was said by another BA during the tasting, this one sort of tastes like a saison as well.

When I had read Vinnie changed the recipe a lot with Batch 004, I was extremely worried in what I would think about the changes. It is different than it was, it's less sour, no longer mouth puckering. I would argue that it's basically the same beer underneath the covers, but the complexity has gone off the charts. The downplayed sourness has allowed this beer to speak the rest of its mind. Vinnie was leaning more towards Orval with this batch, and he nailed it with the funk, but added the tartness and more tropical flavors underneath. An absolute masterpiece. I can't imagine ever coming across a beer that rivals this one.","Bubba83","Beers"

Finishes with some lemon zest, pineapple, and lots of cellar funk. A little bit of lingering pixie stick. Mouthfeel is light and airy with engaging pinpiont bursts of carbonation.

A mild Brett note- a touch of clove, a wisp of bandaid, are also present. Drying on the finish with a soft, buttermilk-like lactic tartness, along with a touch of honey, this is exquisite.

A subtle malty sweetness slowly reveals itself, mixing with the puckering sourness to create a surprisingly balanced flavor. Light bodied, perhaps a bit thin on the palate. The sweeter flavors come out more and more in the finish, ultimately leaving a faint honey-like flavor on the palate. Acidity and bitterness are fairly low.

Mouthfeel is nice, especially as the beer is allowed to warm. Carbonation is not too prickly, a problem my other favorite sour brewer JP often presents. Drinkability is super high for me.

It was so wonderful that I drank four or five glasses and bought half a case on the spot. Its simply that good. Appearance wise we are talking about a very pale, almost white golden ale body with a healthy white lacing. The aroma is powerful, previewing sourness, and boasting of perfectly created and utilized yeast strains and lots of funky, living organisms. Barnyard funk, rotten lemon peals, and apple vinegar are huge. The nose also plays at tobacco and citrus. The first taste is pure heaven. Its tart in a lemony way, sour in a bret/funky yeast sort of way, slightly bitter in a hoppy way, light and spritsy. Sweet, very ripened grapefruit that has been eaten away at just a touch by bacteria, hay, damp corn husks, rotten melons, wood roundedness, dashes of lemon and orange zest, etc Bone dry and fairly light body. Musty and astringent. Sourness is not over the top and although this doesnt enter the battery acid or sweaty donkey hair area, this is at times very geuze like. Sessionable indeed.

The taste is very sour as I was hoping for and has a nice touch of citrus that leads to a dry finish. The body is sort of light but has active carbonation in the body so it feels bigger.

While I really am enjoying this beer, I am starting to think that Brettanomyces is better employed as a supporting cast member in beer.
