"Tastes like wine flavored SweeTarts...very nice. Not overly sour, but walks the line between dry tartness and sweet grains. Bubbly carbonation almost gives it a champagne feel. It is very good. Not my favorite Cascade, but another winner for sure."

"O-really enjoyed this sour ale, good flavors and barrel notes"

"2012 Project; Hazy golden pour. Medicinal welch's grape, tart and earthy aroma. Nice oaky flavor and lactic acidity on the front end. The grape is present and overly sweet up front with a strong white wine like alcohol backbone. The flavor dies out with a mild earthiness. Carbonated with large bubbles which didn't help the mouthfeel. I ended up drinking a glass and switching to the white wine my wife had opened. Not a bad beer by any means just disappointing given the price and my expectations. I wasn't expecting Vigneronne but this beer really needs some funk to balance out the sweetness and add some complexity."

"Pours a dark golden color with not much of a head. didnt ""pop"" when i opened it either. Smell is very much like white grapes, much like welches white grape juice! Taste is very similar as well. It has only a tiny bit of tartness to it, definitely the least sour tasting cascade ive had. The white grape flavor is very prominent and pronounced and it lasts through the finish and lingers. Its definitely what it promises. No tartness almost at all is quite a shock..not sure as intended? body is medium and carbonation is quite low. I will have to try another bottle to see if the tartness is just off in this one. Overall though the flavor is on point... maybe better fresh"

"O - For some people this might be a good beer but I did not care for the cotton-candy/fake grape sweetness at all. Alcohol was very smooth however. A miss for me. I would not be very happy if I'd payed for a bottle rather than a taster."
"Cork and caged bottle from Tipples. 2013 Project. Pours clear golden colored with some spritzy white head that goes away quickly. Aroma of slight sour vinegar, oak, grapes, citrus peel, and maybe even some Brett. Flavor is lightly tart, dry with some oakiness, and an interesting bit of grape sort of like grape soda rather than grape juice. Hmmm. Some vinous notes as expected. Medium bodied from the sweetness, but rather spritzy with the carbonation. Cascade managed to make a $31 beer taste like Dave Chappelle's Grape Drink. Not drain pouring this since its not completely offensive and cost that much, but what the eff? Seriously what a ripoff."

"O: Just a fantastic beer. While the taste didn't completely live up to the nose, this was a fantastic example of what is possible when the lines between beer and wine are blurred. Nice work Cascade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a great beer. It's a little pricey and for the cost I would rather a different beer from Cascade. I'm happy to have tried it though."
""
""
""
"O: My absolute favorite Cascade brew. Its restrained tart character topped off with a nice yeast fruit character and dry almost spicy finish, similar to a saison, makes for an amazing experience. A must try and definitely a worthwhile reason to give Cascade brewing way too much money that your wiling to spend most of the time. IN this case, wort the $25ish bucks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So while this is a great beer I think it can get a bit one note. As is the case for me with Cascade in general. This may be the last Cascade I buy. The price point on their beers just doesn't seem to back up what they deliver. Either that or they need to do 375's at half the price. Cascade, learn to work the brettanomyces,,, please. Not wanting to be over critical as it's a pleasant beer, but not top tier or close for that matter."
""
"Overall it's a neat beer, but it's lacking a bit and may be past it's prime. It's fruit composition though is nice, but it also reminds me a bit too much like cider which I am not the biggest fan of. Still decent."

"Never fear, however, as this would still pair excellently well with all kinds of food, especially a variety of cheeses that immediately spring to mind - goat cheese, maybe smoked Gouda. This an excellent beginner's venture into grape must infused beers, but I've certainly had more that were far more complex, and more importantly, more that had a stronger, acidic grip that complimented the grapes and showcased the power of the yeast and barley backbone that makes the beer. Worth a try, but don't break your back to get one."

"Little disappointed by this one - 2012 vintage - feel like it needs some age. There is a decent grape nose but the taste was overwhelmingly like Dimetapp and fruit juice. Might have been a bad bottle. Nice pour and smell though, as expected from Cascade."

"O-One of the better grape based sours I've had. The grape flavor was large and in charge but in nice balance with the other flavors. A solid sour."

"O - An interesting venture toward the wine world which I might have liked more had I never had Cantillon Vigneronne."
""
""
"There's one reaction The Vine evokes sip after sip: a loud Lil Jon-like ""YEAH!"" Blending and souring three or four varieties of ale and then further barrel-fermenting with the juice from white wine grapes is what I'd call a pretty high-risk/high-reward experiment - Cascade hit the jackpot."

"not as intense as I wanted it to be, nor as sour. pale cloudy yellow color, smallish white head without much retention. smells like artificial purple grape candy when I really sniff hard, but smells just like a sweeter sour when I don't try so hard. wheat malt, grape must, and lactic acid are all evident. I taste a lot of oak in this, sweet and earthy, and it pairs well with the sweetness of the grapes. however, the fruitiness takes a lot away from the sour properties, which really only come in as acidity on the finish. not a lot of tartness or funk or pep to this, and it feels a little dull as a result. it could stand more carbonation too, to lighten up the fruit. I think the concept is good and the flavors are good, if a little muted, but the overall product is in need of a refinement. it is a full step or two below the elite sours on the market, but still a quality brew. this bottle had a little age on it, so maybe it hasn't held up super well. will need to try fresh to compare."
""
""
"Lighter side of medium body with soft but ample carbonation. There is a bit of alcohol warmth after a few sips, but fairly easy to sip on."
""
""
""
""
"I guess I should not be surprised by the flavor considering the addition of grapes into the barrel. Probably a beer that would improve with aging."
""
"nor is it as dark as the glass in the picture...."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this one. I'm actually not the biggest fan of artificial grape flavor, so it was good to have the raw authenticity of the grapes come through full force... it was a beautiful thing. This was an excellent beer, and definitely something I'd like to snag a few more bottles of, if given the opportunity. I think over time, it'll grow even more sour and even more badass. Chalk up another ""W" for the guys in Portland."
""
""
""
""
""
"Moderately tart, big concord grape flavor, vitamin C tablets, drying aftertaste. Trace acetic and lactic acidity. Medium bodied and spritzy carbonation. Fairly one-dimensional, continuing my overarching main gripe with Cascade's wild ales."

"While this is the first time I've reviewed this beer, I have had it once previously (2011 project) and remember liking it considerably more than this bottle. This could just be an off bottle, or perhaps this years batch didn't turn out how Cascade intended. If you can find a 2011 (or other vintage), I would recommend giving it a try, but this one I'd pass on."
"O - I imagine this is not easy to brew and they pulled off a genius sour beer. Kudos!"

"mouthfeel is thin but right where it should be. almost to much carbonation but it settles down allowing it to be pretty drinkable. I drank the 750ml by myself although I did have some heartburn. solid and would purchase again"

"O: This is a really nice sour. It’s not super intense (like Apricot or Kriek). It’s just right. It’s something that I’d love to try again in the future. Super drinkable."

"Another great beer from Cascade Brewing, I am lucky to live a few minutes from the Raccoon Lodge and get to try just about everything they release. This is one of their finest beers. It appears pretty dark, but it's so bright, sour, and refreshing. Love it."

"Served in a stubby chalice, the beer is a deep, golden color with a frothy white head. The nose is loaded with oaky white whine and white grape notes. Sweet malt. Following are earth, pear, and belgian yeast. The flavors follow suit, with an additional light tart. Light-medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Not my favorite Cascade, but unique and enjoyable."
""
"O - another excellent sour from cascade."
""
"D - Great sour beer. Great smoothness and overall balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - an interesting and unusual beer with funky grape aromatics and a pleasant white grape tart flavor. It's quite boozy, but very well hidden."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a light golden amber color with not much head at all. The smell is light with a tart sweetness to it. I am getting a wine note along with a light tartness. The taste is light and sour, but it's not a vinegar sourness. I am getting some wine along with a lemon juice like sourness. There is a slightly herbal funk in the finish. This is a nice sour and it hides the abv quite well."
""
""
""
"The beer is light golden with a small white head. The aroma brings funk, stone fruits, yeast. Sour funk and apricots with a bit of a kick in the finish. Great feel with alcohol content well hidden. Light acetic finish. Pronounced apricots throughout. Very good."
""
""
"O - Less acidic and more funky. Time has improved this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy shimmering gold topped with a fizzy bright white head that dissipates fairly quickly to form a foam ring that leaves hints of lacing here and there. Lactic sour, light oak, a touch of light citrus, a hint of spice, yeastiness, and white wine accents on the nose. Grapeskin, chardonnay, light clove, pleasant toasted oak, little to no funk-but big yeasty notes midpalate rounded out by some lightly sweet honey. Finishes dry and sour with more white wine and oak and some warming alcohol. Heavy medium body with gentle but effervescent carbonation, silky smooth. Another exceptionally complex sour from Cascade Brewing."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. It displays a mild tingle of alcohol character and warmth. Overall a unique wild that I thought was interesting and very easy drinking. I would get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good sour, smell is awesome."
""
"Not bad overall the taste is subtle , not as sour as I like. The alcohol is very well hidden and this beer is not sweet as I expected."
""
""
"The beer pours clear golden with a thin white head that fades quickly to nothing. The nose is moderately sour and vinous with a touch of sweetness. The taste is a bit off with a touch of sweet and sour grapes, peppery oak, and reserved bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel also seems a bit off and isn't as clean tasting as I'd previously experienced with Bruery/Cantillon grape-based sours. Regardless, this light bodied, effervescent, semi-dry sour is quite drinkable and will probably age relatively well. I'm glad to try this beer, but it's not my favorite of the style or from Cascade."
""
""
""
"Orange with light lacing and retention. Nose has some sweaty socks, white grape, white wine, oak, fruit and lighter fleshed fruits like peaches and apricots. Taste is lightly sour sweeter malt, white grape, apricot and nectarine. Medium full feel, and a gentle effervescence. Delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing brew. Cascade to me can do very little wrong. The blend of grape sweetness and tartness with the wild yeast notes (funk, spice, slight phenols) is amazing and perfectly complimentary to each other. (4.5)"
"Overall: this beer is tasty and super drinkable. This beer shares a lot in common with a sparkling white wine, and a good one at that. I am really enjoying this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - This never quite develops through the palate, yet the finish is plenty rich and inviting. Fair example overall."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - Overall this was a tasty beer. I think I like what sang noir brings to the table though. Still, as pricey as this is its a damn good beer."
"Not terrible at all! I am just not that impressed by this beer. Pretty drinkable, but I am going to call this a ""safe"" sour beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall, a very flavorful and complex Wild Ale. Carbonation really shines for a beer at this high an abv, tons of sugary caramel flavors that blend to make this a well balanced wild ale with a lot to offer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"We opened it up for dinner with company that don't normally favor sours but they loved it. It is very hard to find but I strongly recommend you purchasing a few bottles if you do find some. I paid ~$23 for the 750ml and it was well worth it."
""
""
""
"Clear medium gold body, not a lot of visible carbonation, 1/2 finger pure white head, quick dissipation with minimal lacing. Grape forward nose, wine-like aromas, acidic, no hops to speak of. Once fully warmed, this beer was a revelation as to how grapes can be used in beers, given Ron's background in the wine industry no surprise. The grapes infuse a sweetness balanced by the lacto's sourness, dry tart finish, a bit of light funk once fully warmed, dry hay. Good grief. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, not a lot of effervescence. A prime example of how barrel aging and patience can produce stunning results. Unbelievably tasty, a real treat."
"Incredibly light and easy drinking for 9.73%. Mildly sour. The grape and barrel aging flavors are outstanding! A winner for sure."
""
""
""
"I figured I sat on this one long enough. Last night of a 12-day vacation, I cooked up some chicken stir-fry and popped this sucker open. Decanted into a Cascade goblet, The Vine was a slightly hazy liquid, golden amber, lively bubbling carbonation, capped off with a small white head; minimal retention and no real lacing to speak of. Aroma is tart with grapes and stone fruit, lactic and woody. Very tasty, sour fruits--grape, apricot, lemon, orange--but not bracingly lip-puckering, which was nice, lactic and well-tamed acetic notes, Chardonnay, grass, subtle oak in just the right quantity, sweet biscuity malts in the background. Medium-bodied, a bit sticky, nearly no alcohol taste or burn. Yep, this was one drinkable wild ale, and it paired brilliantly with my dinner. I have another bottle that I'll let sit for a while longer. Cheers!"
"O- A fantastic beer. Up there with the best Belgian wild ales."
"O: Not my favorite offering from Cascade so far - a bit too tannic and estery. Still pretty tasty though."
""
"A good sour, though it's far from my favorites from Cascade."
""
"O: Another solid wild from Cascade. This along with Sang Noir were fantastic. Look forward to trying their other beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A super smooth, mellow sour. This beer wowed everyone, even my friend who wasn't really interested in trying a sour. Absolutely fabulous, pure, and clean. One of the stunning things is the complete lack of downsides. Just delicious. Right now I'm wishing I'd bought a case of it, instead of just a single bottle."
""
""
""
"Light yellow nearly still in appearance. Smells vinous, green apples, oak, some vinho verde, lime mist and a bit of leaves muddled into vodka soda. Flavor is too much like the grape - like a shitty wine intensly soured. Like a moscato that failed to make sure sanitation was meticulous when stunting a fermentation to retain residual sugars. A disappointment for me. Medium bodied with low carb and wet finish. I did not care for this one."
""
"Overall very good beer...not my favorite from cascade but quite solid."
"O: A-"
""
""
""
""
"The acidity is a little hard to take after a while, meaning it feels somewhat unbalanced. Despite this, it's a good wild ale, and one worth seeking out."
"Overall quite nice, but not as funky or sour as I expected. Nice musty white muscat grape flavors, some bitter skin like, lots of honey as well, good but not great."
""
"I had this beer some years ago and have always wanted to have it again. Looks like golden honey with a decent little head, kind of bubbly. Not much retention but that is expected. White grapes, and lemon and high lactic notes, a bit of grahm cracker crust and funk. All the flavors meld and blend so well. Sure there is oak, white grapes, some lemon but not much. It is really a subtle beer that blends wine and wild flavors very well. Not really too dry on the finish there is some body here. While the beer is a triumph it does lack some depth and complexity."
""
"Overall a very good American sour. Refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one is like a white wine with a hint of sour. Its appropriately named ""The Vine"" for this wine like beer."
""
"The flavor is great with mild sweet grape and light lemon tinges with gentle mix of both sour and sweet and mild tropical perhaps juicy pineapple and oak in the middle with some slight pepper and tea-like astringent flavor with a nice reminder of the wine barrel mixed with the sour elements and light malt flavor. I loved this, it is a very drinkable and unique beer. I would love to try it again. Thanks again Foofaa for this treat!"
"Overall I enjoyed it's beer but I have to say honestly it is my least favorite of any of the numerous beers I have had from Cascade. A bit too sweet, even for this slightly older edition; could use a year more or so to dry and sour more. From what I have heard and read the best edition is the original because it has aged and it properly balanced with sweet and sour."
""
""
"Another really solid sour from Cascade, though it's not nearly as in-your-face as some of the others I've had. That's not necessarily a bad thing and the grapes really make it unique."
"This was a real damn good wild ale. Didn't taste the alcohol at all and had the right amount of sourness to it. While not as complex as some other cascade brews, this showed more depth and did everything just right."
"Medium body, lively carbonation, good mouthfeel overall. This is good and for lovers of grape in their American Wilds..it's probably better than just good. Me? I'm not a huge fan of grapes but I'm not sorry I gave this a go. Being a Cascade beer.."
""
""
"Tastes a lot like a white wine although it's not terribly complex."
""

"2011 Vintage. Pours a very hazy golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite vinous...nice white wine aroma. Tons of grapes. Nice and funky with a lovely oak presence. Taste is initially Belgian tripel with a lot of white wine and oak. Some pears with a bit of melon. A nice sour apple presence as well. Probably the least sour beer I've had from Cascade...nice and tart. Mouthfeel is nice and dry. Drinkability is very high. Overall, a fantastic beer that I know lovers of white wine could easily get into."
"overall: solid as always from cascade - perhaps a little less spectacular than some of the other bottled offerings"
""
"O - A good beer, but could be better. If you are looking for a mix of wine and beer, this would be good for you. Still, I wouldn't turn down a bottle/glass."
""
""
"O- This is high rated and rightfully so, this really is a remarkable beer."
""
""
""
"D - Tasty. I like it."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this bottle. I thought this was slightly better than the Apricot version. I think this could have used a bit more sour and funk, and less sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: tactfully balances between Belgian yeast influence and barrel aged tartness. Nicely balanced and wonderful to drink. Falls a little short in t long run as it lacks some of the deeper lactic notes I would expect."
"When I first heard about this beer, I assumed that ""Cascade The Vine"" was going to be a DIPA or an IPA exclusively hopped with cascade hops. Apparently Cascade is a brewery. Good to know. In other news, this is a good sour."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, so drinkable that my fiancee that hates 98% of beers liked this one. I just wish it wasn't so expensive."
""
"O: Very good"
""
"O- This was better than I expected. Fantastic"
"O- I really like this. The beer is not over bearing and isn't trying to be too much. the grape meld great and fit in so well. And 9% it doesn't taste at all. I think more along the lines of a gueze with the body something 5-6%. I would drink this all day. Good job again Cascade. i Can't wait till we meet again"
"Pours a slightly murky orange with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, fruit, and some funky aromas. Taste is of grain, grapes, and funk with an acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good wild ale with a nice grape flavor to it."
"O: A bit disappointing, since I am a big Cascade fan, and I bet I enjoyed this beer on tap at the Barrel House. There's just nothing too interesting about this one, with the brett being the most noticeable element. Even the smell is mild and unrefined."
"O: I was looking forward to this, but was dissapointed. The Brett funk overpowered this beer to the extent that I couldn't taste the fruit. Still pretty drinkable, but needs more subtlety of flavor. I'm still a huge fan of Cascade, but this is worse than I'm used to from them. Seek out the Blueberry instead."
""
"O- very good sour. Just sour and funky enought with a slight sweet fruitiness. Would definitely like more when I can get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"reveal: Cascade the Vine. Wow thanks for the enjoyable bottle. The overall sourness hid a lot of the grape juice flavors, but the balance of funk smells makes it quite delicious."
"Overall: This is definitely a solid beer and I wish something like this were readily available in my part of the country (although my understanding is that this beer is about as expensive as they come)... doesn't quite compete with the likes of a Consecration or Supplication, but definitely comes in just behind them. A great beer to be sure."

"Bottle: Poured cloudy muddy light brown color ale with a small bubbly head with no retention. Aroma of funky barnyard notes with some tart notes with some vile unrefined grainy notes. Taste is also quite a mess with loads of harsh grainy notes with some vile barnyard notes. Body is full with no carbonation. Either this bottle was off or I clearly don’t get this beer."
"Overall this is just a wonderful beer. White wine barrels/grapes must be some of the most subtle out there when it comes to imparting flavor in a beer. The fact that this beer tastes so much like a fine white wine is testament to the skill and craftsmanship taking place in Oregon. I will always welcome this as an extra, gift, or sample at a tasting."
"A solid sour ale. The sourness works well with the blonde ale and I thoroughly enjoy the flavour here. Great."
"A tasty, simple, grape sour. I would love to try this one again."
"Its color is yellow with a tint of gold. The head is small, though the lacing it gives off is good. The nose is a pleasant note of soured white grapes. And it gets better in the taste. So smooth, so grapey. It tastes like someone fresh pressed some white grapes into a sour base beer and this is the final result. There is a touch of vinegar in this fairly sour grape beer. All in all, it's another great package delivered by the folks of Cascade. And to think that I've hesitated to pull the trigger on a bottle of any of their products...."
"D/0- a good one for beginner sour drinkers.unique taste. thanks kevin!"
"Drink- Pretty damn tasty. I like the Cascade beers that I have had. Ill continue to seek out more in the future."
"Unsure of the vintage of this straw colored gem light effervescent bubbles, without any discernable head. Faint, sweet, white grape juice aroma. Tastes like mildly tart sour grapes, a bit of grape skin, and some tropical fruit flavors. Not overly tart, nicely balances with the fruit flavors. Light and crisp, much like a dry sparkling white wine. Delicious beer I have wanted to drink for a while."
" Rich notes of tart grape skins, cherries and loads of funk, some light spiciness and a decent touch of oak. lots of dark fruit, tart funkiness and a nice earthy, woodsy like smell blending together very nicely on this one. Silk like smoothness, and the finest carbonation bubbles, really well done in that regard. ;ots of sour in here right up front with frapes and light lemon like citrus taking over. Rolling through some nice notes of cherry then came over me. Decent funkiness in through the middle and the finish, but it was actually almost blended out by a cherry like sweetness and more hints at a sugary touch. A nice sipper none the less and I tried to cherish every last drop of this one."
"EDIT: Just drank my first 2011, still very good, but not phenomenal like the last three years/batches. Hopefully just needs some age, but it didn't seem to have the vibrancy of other years. Prior rating was 4.5/4.5/5/5/4.5"
"(D)- This is a solid to great wild ale with an incredible drinkability and crispness to it. Not over the top in any way, but showcases everything very well in the style equally; harmonious."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is rather heavier in body compared to other Cascade sours I tried, with a moderate amount of spritzy carbonation. Extremely good. Overall, this was one of my top two favorites of the night. Really enjoyed the notes of pale fruits and vinous character."
"O - Not the best Cascade, but no slouch either."
"This is a crazy drinkable brew. Nice oak flavors but nothing too bold. Its sweet and tart and very clean. I could drink a bunch of this if not for the high ABV."
"Another damn fine sour by Cascade. Its nearly amazing that this beer is what could pretty much be considered their flagship, or standard offering."
"Overall, not too shabby. Though, I recently had the 2010 Vintage on tap at Barrel House & this '08 can't compete. Still very happy I tried it."
"O: Seems that this might not be standing up to age. I generally enjoy this beer much more when fresher, but this bottle seems a bit simple. Nothing particularly wrong with it, no off-notes, but no complexity or interesting notes either. I'll need to make a point to review the new vintage at some point in the near future."
"D-nice balance of sweetness and sourness. could use more sour but light and present acidity in back is nice. tons of white grapes, not mind blowing but tasty and very drinkable."
"beautiful, glowing golden color with a white head that held for a bit and left some lace. nose was tropical fruits, citrus, pear, fermenting white grapes, wheat (kind of like grainy bubblegum cotton candy), oak and lacto/pedo. very clean. minimal funk. beautiful smell. boo ya! taste is fantastic as well. flavors blend and harmonize, and what seems like it might be a sticky fruit bomb is a properly slick, medium bodied and pretty dry beer that showcases the similarities between wine and beer, giving the glory to fermentation. finishes with little to no aftertaste. tartness makes me salivate and crave more. alcohol barely detectable. winner."
"Starts out very prickly, again like soda, which is great... but it dissipates quickly and by the end of the glass, after about 15-20 minutes, it was dead flat. This allowed those undesirable, unpleasantly musty flavors to really come through. Basically, drink it quick and it's a refreshingly dry winner."
"A brilliantly clear amber copper with a dense, off-white head with spectacular retention and lacing, this is a beautiful beer. The nose, OTOH, leaves me wanting. Very spicy, this is like pumpkin pie spices with some sweet, grape juice added to it. Sourness is present, rather clean, and it leaves me wanting some funk. The palate is similar, almost like an over-spiced Belgian Christmas ale soured with lacto. Despite this, it is pretty vinous. Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this is spicy and unpleasant on the finish. I really did not care for this at all."
"D: Very nice sour."
"I've really wanted to try anything from Cascade for awhile. Luckily one of my old college roommates, who has since relocated to Portland, was nice enough to send me this bottle as well as a bottle of Vlad the ImpAler. This beer looks beautiful. It poured a cloudy and murky bright apricot orange. The head appeared ravenous and acidic as the poofy off white head appeared to consume itself and leave only a few traces left to lace the glass. It smells of Golden Delicious apples and freshly cut pears. It begins tart before finishing with the pear like sweetness. It's one of the most appealing Wilds that I've seen and smelled yet. The flavors are tart and musty. It has barnyard without having the funk, which is very interesting. It has some light white wine aspects. It's really quite diverse and it finishes rather dry. It drinks medium bodied with excellent crispness and kind of sucks the saliva from your mouth after awhile but it does leave behind some slight tartness and sweet pear. This is a very good wild. It's really tempting me to try the Vlad sooner rather than later."
"Overall: A wonderful sour ale, very nice balance between sour and wild. I honestly wish it was more sour like most Cascade sours. This is my fourth favorite from them behind Cuvee, Apricot, and the Kriek. Still wonderful!"
"D: This isn't hard to drink at all, in fact I wish I had another bottle to drink at a later date. A nice sour that is a bit more subtle than many of the other wild ales I've had. By not being as acidic, it helps with the overall ease of drinking. Glad to get the chance to try it."
"i wouldnt really go after another bottle of this again, but still highly recommended IMHO and definatly worth a try. if offered this however, i would absolutly never refuse, this is a very nice beer and it makes me even more intrigued to get a hold of some more offerings from cascade. i love what this brewery is doing and the time and skill that goes into this beer is astounding. drinkability wise, one bottle to the head is no problem, i could even go for second; a sessionable sour almost. gave a my GF a small pour and she enjoyed this as well. this was drank while watching DFH's brewmasters and i couldnt help but think ""DFH aint got nothin on cascade as far as EXTREME beers go!"" hahaha."
"Picked this one up at the local for a try. It pours clear and golden with a small foamy head that quickly vanishes leaving no lacing. The smell kicks off with some funky barnyard that gives way into grapes, fruit and oak. The taste is very tart up front (nice vinous/grape flavor) with the funk in the nose not as pronounced as I would have expected. It is really smooth. Great citrus fruit flavors surface mid palate and it finishes oaky and dirty. Definitely a dry finish. The mouthfeel is pleasant but I really thought this beer might have a bit more of a bubbly character. It comes off a little flat. Even with the lack of head and carbonation this beer is fantastic. The flavors are well crafted and I will easily finish off the rest of this bottle myself. Cheers!"
"poured a murky pale golden orange in color with pineapple yellow highlights that had almost no head and left almost no lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was very vinous consisting of a variety of grapes from what I can smell with acidic, citrus, fruity, oaky, and tart notes. The flavor was also filled with fruit like grapes, apricots, and apples but had oaky citrus accents alongside acidic funky notes to round out this delicious beer. The brew was light to medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet, acidic, fruity, funky, oaky, tart, and slight dry finish. It drank really good and was craving more after every sip. I will definitely seek out some more of this beer."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a hazy yellow orange with a minimal white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and a sour note only. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, and subtle apple. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent example of the style in my opinion. It had a very nice flavor and good aroma going on here. I really enjoyed the fact that there wasn't really a funk to this one and just sour notes. Hope to try more offerings from Cascade in the future as this one set the bar pretty high. This was the favorite of my buddy and I of the nine sours/wild ales we tasted and reviewed this weekend."
"D: Perhaps the easy going mouthfeel was the right decision by the brewers at Cascade since the drinkability is exceptional probably because of the restraint. There hasn't been a Cascade beer that I've had and not thoroughly enjoyed. Lots of successful brews coming out of one of my favorite breweries..."
"It seems more solid by the score. Skipping the in depth notes on this. It carries the awesome cascade sour character, but smell and taste are driven by distinct sweet smelling and tasting jolly rancher (aka confected) grape. Love the brewery. This one just didnt do it for me."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a thin white head. The nose brings forward some lactic and acetic sourness as well as a pretty fresh grape nose. A bit of funk. The taste loses the grapey character and has more of a mild fruit flavor to go along with a pinch of oak as well as both lactic and acetic characteristics. Mouthfeel is dry but not overly so with good sourness. All around, a pretty good sour but doesn't live up to their Apricot."
"I was less impressed with this offering on a second tasting and have lowered the scores slightly (was 4/4/4.5/4/5)"
"D: While I like the sweetness, it's hampering the long term drinkability. Could be a little more sour to balance this out. I will finish the bottle but this would be something nice to split."
"Nice beer"
"Drinkability: A fine tasting brew that I'm really enjoying. It's not the most sour, or the most funky, and it doesn't really pack a huge flavor wallop, but it is tasty nonetheless. If you are into the style, or would like to get into it like I am, it's one I would recommend."
"Bottle. Bottle was a bit hard to open and gushed mildly all over my back door which prompted mothman to run up frantically waving a glass in my face yelling ""I have a glass!"" No need though as the initial carbonation out of the bottle subsided. Poured a murky golden amber color with a tight white head. Very sharp tart aroma with vinegar and acetone notes along with some tart fruit aromas. Light mouthfeel and a bit more carbonated than I would have liked. Fairly nice sourness with a nice sweet fruit finish. Lots of white wine like characteristics. Oaky finish as well. Pretty good but would like to see this a little more sour."
"D - stupidly drinkable. This is the kind of beer that just beckons you to chug it, which would, of course, be a travesty, as it deserves far more reverance than that. A ""porch-sippin'"" beer, to say the least, but, ultimately, much more than that; a thoroughly-complex and delicious masterwork. Incredible."
"Overall, a pretty nice offering from cascade. Pretty nice all around, actually. A good drinkability as well."
"batch 2 I believe. Cork comes off with an explosion, really satisfying. Pours a very clear honey gold with a loud, fizzy head that fades to a collar. Nose is large wine barrel, white grapes, some other light fruits. Quite a lot of wet wood. Major white grape in the flavor. Some musty, sweaty brett and of course oak. The idea is similar to Cuvee de Castleton, but it's not as tight, and a bit muddled. Sour and puckering on the finish. As it breathes it really tightens up and expresses the grape and sour flavors in a much more cohesive way. Still pretty similar to Castleton, but not as sour and a little less spritzy."
"D: Great, love it. Thanks Zack, SeaBass, and everyone else who have shared this one with me over the past couple months."
"I really enjoy sours and I could drink them all day long just about everyday, this is no expectation."
"Drinkability is excellent. I love this beer, will buy again definitely."
"I've wanted to try some Cascade beers for awhile now. The Vine was a good one to start off with. Lots of sourness, fair amount of funk, with a great mouthfeel and no off flavors. I'm actually not a huge fan of white wine (a statement as absurdly general as ""I don't like fruit," I know) or grape, but the balance of flavor here worked very well for me."
"750ml capped bottle served in a tulip. Pours a hazy orange with a white band around the edges. Nose reveals tart citrus and cork, with some sweetness coming out towards the back. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of stone fruit (apricots?) and grapes. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an effervescent carbonation and a semi-dry, puckering finish. My first Cascade sour, and it was nothing short of incredible. Can't wait to try more from this brewer, even in spite of the hefty price tag."
"It is lacking carbonation, but the body is light enough that it is manageable. It would be nice to have some more carbonation. Overall, the flavor is great and the aftertaste is nice. The feel is solid enough that I enjoyed it."
"D: I feel like this is the perfect example of the Cascade wilds that I've had up to this point. Very one dimension but so tasty, with a perfect mouthfeel and incredible drinkability. The Vine almost seems like a better, sweeter champagne and I could go at this one all day. I can't wait to break out another bottle and pick up some more. Definitely worth the price of purchase!"
"Overall I was a very big fan of this beer - I love the flavors of American grapes (Concorde, muscadines, and scuppernongs) and I find that it's difficult to accurately get that flavor in a beer. This beer succeeds completely and has additional complexity from other dark fruits and the malt bill. Well worth a shot."
"Very tasty sour, its not super funky though thats probably because its so fresh, you could definitely taste the earthiness of the grapes. It pours a golden light brown color that is beautiful with a somewhat off white creamy head. Its not super complicated but in terms of being a very solid sour that has the potential to really grow into itself I certainly think that it can get there. Would love to try one with some age on it."
"Drinks: uncontrolled. The Vine has pleasing flavors, but the sourness gets just a bit out of hand."
"The beer pours a honey amber color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The nose is pretty wild, showcasing vinegar and sour funk, along with a very noticeable grape and berry aroma. Fortunately, the dead moose and headcheese aroma aren't too overpowering in this beer (though it's definitely there). On the palate, the beer is pretty impressive, with the sour funk acting as a backdrop for the grape and berry flavors. There's also some noticeable banana, vanilla and even a hint of bubblegum, all wrapped around a core of sour funk. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with the beer ending with a long, mouthpuckeringly sour zip on the finish. Drinkability is pretty good, though I found the sour funk to be a bit of a distraction after a while. Nevertheless, I thought this another solid beer from Cascade, with enough other stuff going on flavor and aroma-wise to keep the sour component from becoming overwhelming. Impressive."
"D: Not the best of Cascades beers, but quite good none-the-less. I still had no problem enjoying my sample."
"D: A sipper, the high acidity gives me no choice. I liked the beer, in the end though I think I wanted a little sugar/fruit to counterbalance the acid. I know there's grapes, but they're hard to find. A solid beer, interesting to try, but at $20 there are plenty of other AWA's and Cascades I'd rather get."
"Almost layered looking pour, darker on top, honey gold on the bottom. Quickly dissipating head leaves no lacing. Etching from the Duvel Tulip keeps the bubbles coming though. Despite the seeming stillness, this is a highly carbonated beer, prickly and high on the tongue. This mellows as the beer sits. First wafts had me fearful of an artificial grape sweetness - laffy taffy and sweet tarts. Thankfully, that fades. Nice lactic tartness, grape skins, very faint funk. Some hints of apple juice. A very mellow tart sipper, nothing in your face. Much better as the drink warms allowing more character of the oak, and at long last, the alcohol to shine through. For a nearly 9% beer, you would never know it. Class act all around."
"Pours a cloudy light-watermelon color with a thin lacing of white on the head. Nose is full of peach and passion fruits, like some dry champagnes. Taste is tart but not overly sour, peach, mango and tangerine/lime come through in the taste. Finishes with a nice bite of sourness, and the somewhat stronger alcohol content never really comes through. Excellently crafted brew, definitely worth a shot for any sour lovers."
"drinkability - a very tasty sour, complex, enlightening, i got distracted while drinking it and forgot to fill out the taste section for about 15 minutes...it's incredibly good"
"Wow! This beer is delicious! So tart! Most Cascade beers I've had so far have been closer to a flanders style, so I guess that's what I expected. On the contrary, it's a great sour...much like a gueuze. Flavor is very, very tart...with tons of oakiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with good carbonation, and very low booze is noticeable, surprising for the ABV listed! Again, WOW! This beer completely surprised me and is delicious!"
"4.5 D: Complementarily complex and tasty. Good beer. Not overly sour, but just well made with a good recipe."
"Picked a bottle of this up at the local bottle shop. This is a good beer and I look forward to trying other offerings from Cascade."
"Drinkability is very good especially for the ABV. Nice sourness (lactic) without going overboard. On the sweeter side, which may cut down on drinkability a little bit. Wishing there was a little more complexity to the beer, but its still quite tasty. Worth seeking out, especially if you like white grapes."
"D: medium to high"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are super at the 8.3% ABV. 4.5/5. This is a really fine beer that I am so glad is fairly easily accessible for me. Even at the fairly pricey point of $16 a 750 I will be buying a few of these for future consumption and ordering this on tap at future visits to Cascade."
"Mouthfeel was sparkly and just a bit light in the body. Strong beer gets a 4 for drinkability. But I loved this, a really unique and lovely beer. We all agreed it was a standout in a fine tasting, and I'd love to get a shot at this again, perhaps with a nice food pairing (seafood). Wonderful American Wild from Cascade, I'm bringing Sang Royal to the next tasting!"
"The beer pours a hazy medium-yellow with a white head. The aroma is white wine and ginger ale. The flavor is heavy on the white wine with some herbs including rosemary and ginger. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Very drinkable, alcohol extremely well hidden."
"Love the barrels sir, I love the barrels."
"Overall impression: This is my idea of a great wild ale- no nasty brett, but plenty of sour goodness and fruitiness with a touch of funk. I traded away my only surplus bottle, but I'll have to correct that mistake the first chance I get."
"Note: it really astounds me that I pick up brett in this beer, as Curtis seemed very insistent on not using that in his beers. Is this accidental?"
"Well crafted beer. A tough one for me to track down, but well worth the trouble."
"Drinkability: This is a weekend beer for sure. The feel, aroma, and palate are all fantastic. This is winner number two from Cascade. I'm surprised their beers have so few reviews."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4"
"Overall, a mellow yet complex arrangement that demands leisurely appreciation. Just be advised that the bottle will release plenty of suspended yeast as you draw low on it, and thick gobs of it may drop out at the bottom."
"Another great sour from Cascade. Superb balance, drinks well."
"Some nice stuff here, but could use some more complexity beyond the sweet grapes, clove, and sour factor."
"D - Above average. This beer is pretty good overall, but not the best from Cascade. A bit expensive at $20+."
"- Super drinkable, and not a mind blowing sour bomb. Lacked any vinegar flavor at all which I like in a sour.... seriously a must try for any person wanting to try sours.. or even a sour master!"
"Pours a murky, muddled medium orange with a big fluffy but broken white head that remains atop the glass as its drank. Aroma is tart with green apple and grapes with some slight funk and vanilla notes. The flavor is sweet upfront and then turns immediately tart with sour fruit and the sourness is fairly moderate and pleasant. Its light bodied and very crisp and effervescent. I really find this beer intriguing. Its very delicate and refined. Definitely one of the more moderate sours I've had from Cascade and is certainly another top notch beverage."
"The taste is pleasant but falls short. Very acetic and there is a nice cinnamon or some other spice that falls in the background. The floral scent appears in taste form and is well done. This beers is full in flavor but lacks complexity. The mouthfeel is a little bit too sharp and dry for liking which comes from the white grapes. I could, however, drink this one all night long."
"Overall an impressive beer from the Cascade series. Alot of people might slam this because it isn't the most sour palate thrashing beer around, but make no mistake, this is a very well crafted and delicate beer, and is certainly a tart brew. I would be willing to bet the brewer acheived almost exactly what they wanted to with this. There is great balance between tart dryness and white grape flavor. I would love to have another bottle of this to see how it does with a bit of age. An interesting beer, and one i would certainly drink again."
"what the hell ?!?"
"EDIT: if you let this beer warm up to room temperature, the medicinal flavors really die down, allowing more of white grape tartness to come through."
"D - I'm not as inclined to go back for another as compared to some of the Bullfrog and RR sours, but it's not like I'm going to turn down another glass."
"D: Very nice beer. Reminded me of a poor man's Cuvee de Castleton which is still impressive. No hint of the 9.2% ABV at all though all their beers hide the ABV quite well."
"This is a far departure from the Sang Royale I had the other day. It doesn't have nearly the finesse or balance that that one had, but it is still pretty tasty. An interesting beer, I can see this appealing quite a bit to some people, but I don't seem to be one of those people unfortunately."
"Sampled at the brewery with Ron and Curtis, thanks again for the awesome hospitality guys, reviewed from notes, color is a medium orange with some amber tones, one inch very bubbly white head that does not last long, not much lacing, aroma has white grapes, sour green apples, oak, grassy accents, white pepper, lactobacillus, herbal accents, apricots, and lemon juice, flavor starts off with a dry grape flavor, sour and sweet fruits in the middle, finishes wine-like with a big oak finish, a little minty as it warms actually, dry, slightly sweet, and tart mouthfeel, thin to medium bodied, heavily carbonated, taste lingers with dryness, could drink the bottle for sure, no booze in the flavor which seems hard to believe for a beer over nine percent, smooth and full of unique fruit flavor, look forward to having again, grab a bottle when you can"
"Nice mouthfeel."
"Overall highly recommended. This beer stands up to any of the big highly touted grape based sour beers. I will definitely try to score some more of this one."
"D- This is one of the best lambics I've ever had. Well-balanced and smooth."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice beer, but I'd like it a little lighter, drier and more sour. Which I think it will become in time, although this is probably their least sour beer young. Another winner from Cascade though, tasty and totally unique as usual."
"I was hoping this would be tarter and sourer. I have a few more bottles of this and I'm interested to see how it develops over time."
"This may not drink quickly but it drinks very nicely. The light muscat sweetness and Moscato D'Asti carbonation breaks up the funk enough to avoid that pucker that is satisfying yet on some level a little painful. I enjoy that this is not a traditional sour and the muscat is a great call. It gets better with warmth. Off the deep end and lovin' every minute of it."
"Slightly coppered golden hue with a big velvetty light-tan head. Aroma is lightly tart, touch of grapes, bit of light caramel and a hint of oak. The flavor is very similar to a big Flanders Red, with a wonderful balance of malts and tarts, but with a grape presence replacing the cherries. Layers of flavors bouncing around and playing off each other include light caramel, grapes, biscuit, oak, tangerines and lemons. These are definitely some 'sour grapes' I am enjoying!"
"spiced sour blonde ale blended and aged in oak with an ale containing white grapes. insane. very light in color, like a straight lambic. less sour and funky than dry and tart, white wine is a great comparison. the grape produces more tropical fruit notes.. starfruit and kiwi most noticeably. there is a hint some bitter citrus too, i believe some sort of citrus peel is among the 'spices', although there is no obvious dry spicing. the beer finishes smooth though with the eventual emergence of more traditional sour beer flavor over the winey dryness. the alcohol is unimaginable, strangely, or perhaps its lost to the complexity of flavors. i need another bottle of this all to myself in order to savor and wrap my mind around. one of the best beers ive had in some time, head and shoulders above cuvee de castleton."
