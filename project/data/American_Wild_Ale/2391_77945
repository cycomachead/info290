Large creamy white head that dies down quickly leaving a thin uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer and lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Great sweet and sour aroma; you can smell the sweet fruit followed by a noticeable musty, sour finish. Taste starts with a fruity blueberry flavor followed by a sour and slightly dry finish. Very thirst-quenching. Light to medium body, slightly fizzy from the large amount of light carbonation. Overall a very unique beer. The best blueberry beer that I have ever had. I would definitely purchase again.","sprat1960","Jun 07, 2014"

4.24,2.7,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"i havent had a ton of beer from cascade, but one takeaway from the ones i have had, is that these guys may well be the king of fruit. their apricot is just divine, and this blueberry is just as well done. deep dark purple in color, all from the fruit, i can see a probable blonde beer base underneath, but the stain from the berries is deep. a nose thats more sour than it is fruity, with lots of mellowing oak and then the fruit punch complex of the blueberries, which are as tart as they are sweet. the flavor follows a similar format, sourness first mostly on the front end, before the fruit ramps up. the berries do add some sugar that isnt all the way fermented out, which i like, because its a nice balance to the sourness. i think the true flavor of the blueberry here is as authentic and prominent as the apricot, although i think the apricot it a better beer, the use of fruit and brewing expertise on display is the same. jammy middle before the wood softens the finish. its earthy and summery and reminds me of a place i would like to be, out in a blueberry patch in august gorging myself until my face and hands are stained purple. a special beer, the best blueberry beer ive ever had by leaps and bounds.","StonedTrippin","Apr 10, 2014"

In my limited experience, they are really good at knocking out the "single fruit" sour beers like this one and the kriek (cherry) and apricot. Blueberry is especially great because of the unique look it imparts on the beer from the coloring as well as the natural tartness of blueberries. I'm only a tad curious to know how this one might've tasted closer to the bottling date, but based on how good it is a year old, I'd gladly take a bottle of any vintage that was offered.","LambicPentameter","Jan 27, 2014"

I was underwhelmed with their presence in the aroma and taste of the beer. I wish I could taste the blueberries more, but the acid kinda blows them out. In a blind taste test, I'd have a hard time believing anybody would identify this as a blueberry beer. One other minor complaint I have is the carbonation level. It was a bit too high on this beer for my taste, which is odd considering I didn't find that with the Apricot. Overall, a highly recommended sour but not the best Cascade does.","MighHighBrewer","Aug 22, 2013"

4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage. Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 1-2 finger foamy light pink head with decent retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with tons of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart blueberry, green apple, cherry, pear, raspberry, pepper, hay, funk, oak, clove, leather, red wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of blueberry notes with fruity/spicy yeast and barrel presence; and big strength. Taste of tart blueberry, blueberry skin, green apple, pear, raspberry, pepper, hay, grass, oak, clove, funk, leather, red wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blueberry, apple, pear, raspberry, pepper, oak, clove, hay, funk, red wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of blueberries with fruity/spicy yeast and barrel notes; with a fantastic balance of malt/acidity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, prickly, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Blueberry sour ale! All around great complexity and balance of blueberry with fruity/funky yeast and oak character; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 16, 2013"

Pours a violet/red hazy color, a thin line of head circles the rim of the glass. Aroma- vinegar funk mixed with rose petal and a blueberry wafty ending. Reminds me of smelling smashed fresh blueberry, no artificial flavors detected. Aroma is amazing. Taste- some tart flavors, but not puckeringly sour. The fruit is very present, I get more of that raw blueberry flavor without the sweetness. Very dry finish with some barnyard funky aftertaste. I was expecting this to be much more sour but this is really a celebration of the blueberry flavor that stays true to it without becoming cloying, sweet, or artificial. As it warms, more of the funk comes out. I get a little bit of band aid on the end- it's not distracting but you can tell that Brett worked a little in here. Nice mouthfeel- I swear I might have had some blueberry pulp in there, maybe some seeds. Good carbonation. I really like this beer- I think its an excellent example of a fruit beer but it has a ways to go before it obtains fruit lambic like sourness and acidity.","lnashsig","Mar 03, 2013"

It instantly hits you with fresh blueberry juice, a healthy dose of dry Brett, and a nice level of acidity. The slightly sweet blueberry character works well with opposing, bretty funk. It smells much more authentic than the 2011, which I found to be too sweet and artificial. The flavors are instantly dry and tart with a lot of Brett to pair with the blueberry, which has a great blueberry muffin aspect. The acidity is perfect and provides a nice level of sourness. It drinks light with a healthy amount of carbonation. It leaves both ends of the flavor spectrum in the after taste, which is unique and fun to experience. Overall this beer was very enjoyable and I really, really enjoyed it. I'm glad that this beer changed significantly from 2011.

The taste brings in more of the same, though now a strong current of tart blueberry flowing through the proceedings.

3.69,-10.7,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Nice pretty blueberry juice color with some pink tinted white rimming of foam. Nose is blueberry, sour vinous grains, surprisingly grassy and back country with hints of hay and soil. Flavor pulls out a good sharp, astringent sourness with strong blueberry flavors and a good full bodied feeling with low carb and an off dry finish. A good beer. I would buy a few bottles if available. I think I prefer the Apricot over this one.","harrymel","Jul 30, 2012"

4.2,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a ruby red pink with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, blueberry, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, blueberry, wood, tart, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It was stated at the tasting that since Steve Kim wasn’t here, which meant no one brought the Blåbær, that this one would have to do. While it was definitely not on the same level it was definitely a very nice brew that was on par with it and Upland’s version. This one was a lot easier to get as well which makes me wonder why I didn’t buy a case of these when I had a chance. An absolute must try if you have not done so already and if you have, you already understand.","thagr81us","Jul 09, 2012"

One thing that I loved about this beer is the tamed level of sourness. Other offerings that I have had from Cascade have an extremely aggressive sour bite that overwhelms other aspects of the beer.
