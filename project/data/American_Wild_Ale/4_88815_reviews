"This beer smells like...victory.  And it tastes great too, first taste to swallow and finish.  Great brew."
""
""
"Overall: There's not really enough going on with this brew to make it my favorite, yet the aroma makes this one to seek out. I will not buy this again for the flavor isn't really impacting me enough to seek it out. Not bad, not great yet it's dead in the flavor for me."

"Dark with minimal head that quickly fades.  Smells like earth, tart berries, and a tiny bit of funk. Tastes of subtle blackberries, peach, and bandaid funk; very drinkable. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall not the best small bottle from allagash, but quite enjoyable."
"Overall: This is a pretty nice beer by Allagash! Very different and interesting.  I cant say that I would call this a soured stout, but it is defiantely a dark beer with brett. Perhaps it could be considered a combination of a black saison, a wild ale, and a mellow porter. As always... Allagash delivers an awesome looking beer, with nice complexity from the flavor profile, and a great mouthfeel to boot.  Should I just move to Portland Maine to be closer to the source of so many great wild ales?"

"Bottled June 16, 2014. Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is an extremely dark, almost opaque, brown coloring that borders on date colored. The beer pours with a dense, foamy, bubbly head that quickly recedes into a surface coating of off-white. Aromas of farmhouse funk, date and red grape sweetness, solid roasted character, licorice, cotton candy, and some earthy notes. Flavors are roasted and sweet forward, with notes of date and fig, licorice, tobacco, brown sugar, red wine dry and sweet, and tart berry. There is a sharp and very tart/sour undertone, with hints of citrus, mint, and an herbal blend of spices. Cherry, subtle yeast funk, and earth round out the tail end of the palate, with the tart and sour notes carrying through into the aftertaste. The body is robust and dry, giving a solid and consistent feeling across the palate. Very subdued roasted sweet and tart aftertaste compared to the palate, but a perfect transition into the smooth, dry, and soft finish, with only subtle lingers of old world fruit and berries. Very solid, balanced, layered beer."

"Sweet yet not overly so, brett has added a lot of nuanced fruit flavors to this beer. The balance of dryness helps lend this beer it's high score."

"If you don't like brettanomyces, you won't like this one. It's on the nose and in the taste. The dark color gives the beer its name and is quite different than standard Belgian ales. Light on the tongue, the bite of the yeast is quite prevalent. There is an underlying malty richness to the beer. Overall, it is like nothing else I've had, and immensely enjoyable."
"This beer starts out far more dark than the smell indicates--a bit of molasses and toasted bread.  The flavors than shift to the smell with a definitive sourness, like blackberries.  Lots of carbonation, but relatively rich as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very different. Chalky grape candy aroma. Mellow for a sour, but has a cough syrup aftertaste. Still interesting"
"Overall:  This beer has got better with age.  Brett is more bearable and this beer was finished before I knew it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer itself is a bit of coffee, very light, and some roasted malts.  Nothing too overpowering.  This then fades a bit and there is a hint of sweetness (a touch of chocolate?) and also just a hint of some brett on the aftertaste.  The brett here seems to be really only in the nose, pretty much a somewhat bland, fairly light tasting, stout otherwise.  Probably the worst of the Allagash ""limited releases"" that I have tried so far."

"Medium bodied full carbonation. This is a keeper. Get it if you can!"
"The first dark sour I've really liked, maybe I'll actually like sour stouts someday."
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting wild ale. The smell geared me up for a nice, slightly sour, bready sour, but when I tasted it I was surprised with mild dark fruits, some cocoa and very little sour. Still a solid, drinkable, well balanced brew. (4.25)"

"The beer pours a dark maroon with brown sugar highlights, it forms a small head of fizzing lightly yellowed, tan bubbles with mild retention. In body, the beer is a dark, opaque murk. On the nose, the beer smells of bristling tannic oak with raisin and dark cherry accents and a hint of plums and chocolate. Subtle brown sugar softens the edges of the nose, as well. The beer unfurls more and more as it warms in the glass, and is full of quite a few layers of complexity. On the tongue, the beer begins as tart, nearly sour with fruity accents that unfurl and then are coated in thick roasted malt bitters. The finish is lightly dry and bitter. In flavor, the beer begins as tart dark cherry pie coated in dark sugar with hints of plum. These flavors unfurl into dark, caramelly bread with roasted coffee and burnt toast character. Slight bitter, herbal hops and oak tannin enter on the finish to give structure and further complexity to the sip. The aftertaste is of bitter roast and cherries. As the beer warms, the tart cherry flavors begin to blend in with the middle and finish of the sip, which is lovely. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body, with a strong carbonation that scrubs the tongue. Mouthfeel is luxurious and smooth, with a crisp bite from the carbonation. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly dry, but with plenty of saliva on the edges of the tongue, and a slightly bitter stick to the tongue. Overall, this is a lovely dark sour with phenomenal funk and roast. If I had to label it, I would say more sour brown porter than sour stout, but honestly this beer defies modern categories; it’s a new style that needs to be further explored. This is a lovely sipper that could pair superbly with darker meats or chocolate raspberry desserts. This is a beer to try."
"(O)- This is a bit of a weird one for me, was not expecting this dried meat aroma and smell to the beer overall. Might benefit from time, but its a strange beer considering Allagash made this."
""
""
""
"O - Interesting, a bit different, but just ok overall. Not one of my favorite Allagash offerings - I guess they all can't be winners, but they have a pretty good track record with me. This one is fine, but I won't run out to grab the stragglers left on the shelves either."
""

"Roasted and mildly bretty. Soft and mild for Allagash. The oak would have helped."
"This has some decent Brett funk with a nice base of chocolate and caramel. I don't think that the flavors really merge as well as they could, but this is definitely good. I have another bottle aging, and I'm curious what will happen in a few years."
"Drinkability: Really enjoyed the sour cherry and dark chocolate combination. Glad I was able to find this on draft. I would certainly pick this up again. One of my new favorite beers from a brewery that I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I think this thing would taste much better fresh. The funk from the bret made this beer taste dry to me for some reason; it seemed to have over powered the fruit presence . I probably shouldn't have let this age for so long. Also don't understand the high price for this beer. I give it a B+ overall."

"O: Reminds me a little bit of a Fantome saison in terms of the yeast profile and off flavors. I give it extra points for being interesting but in the end its not my favorite and not a great value."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good Brett character without being overly funky or unbalanced. The dark malts provide nice flavors but overall the beer is fairly relaxed and just smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a quite a funky beer. Really haven't tasted dark malts and brett in the same beer like this but it works pretty well but is sorta weird. The slight cherry taste is really nice and even better in the nose. Really glad a generous trader let me get a taste of this as it is really unique."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A nice brew and change of pace but Still not really thrilled by the dark Brett/sour beers. A bit contradictory compilation of flavors in the style. But this one has some interesting elements and is very drinkable."

"a beautifully packaged wild ale from allagash, dark and earthy like a good robust porter, smelling more like a sour, lemony and slightly lactic, but coming through in taste with the soiled malty roast first and an extremely dry bretty finish that really exemplifies the use of brett in a beer, its wonderful. the oak profile on this is solid too, a little sweet for a second, but really just mellowing the whole thing. the grain first yeast second trajectory is welcomed too, with a soft yet rich body like a porter or a dark ale, not bitter but lots of dark barley flavor. carbonation is comprised of so many tiny bubbles it almost seems creamy, like the frothed milk on the top of a proper cappuccino. while the nose shows a hint of souring bugs, the flavor doesnt at all, just the brett, which does an incredible job of drying things out and adding a cool flavor layer without detracting from the dusty chalky dry chocolate malt flavors. while i can easily see the flavors in this beer being polarizing, i mean, its rather unconventional, one must admit, admire, and appreciate the quality of this brew, it is simply wonderful. a real treat to get to try this stuff out here in denver."
"D- extremely interesting brew that is just not my cup of tea."
""
""
""
"O: taste and appereance were pleasent, with aroma coming in at second and the mouthfeel leaving some to desire. Not sure if to state that this was a great brew slowly working it's way to the top or simply a great brewery with a brew leaving something to desire."

"Pours brown within white head and nice lace left behind. The nose starts with strong Brett character which brings funk, lemon, and spice to the nose. This is followed up with some roasted notes and mild chocolate character. The Brett notes seem to work nicely with the roasted malts. The taste features notes of Brett, fruit, funk, and chocolate intertwined. There is a slight tartness at the beginning, but that is overshadowed by roasty malt notes. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, I like the combo of dark malt and Brett. I think the two strong flavors do a nice job of balancing each other."

"There's nothing ""big"" about this beer, but I think that's the point. It's an extremely drinkable, very mildly-sour, dark ale. The brett, while a characteristic of the beer, is not the highlight as the name suggests. I could drink several of these, but would've appreciated a bit more *something* in between the surprisingly subtle sourness that first hits your tongue and the roasty, fruity finish. The middle just seems to sit there coating my tongue."
""
""
"O: A nice example of a brett beer and perhaps one of the only examples of a dark brett beer. Its refreshing since its not a dense beer like a stout. The color is just that, color. It happens to be dark but roast is negligent minus a slight ashy character but is typical for non roasty dark beers. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is dark brown with an everlasting beige head that leaves copious lacing behind. The aroma brings smoke, malt, molasses, leather, dark fruit, funk, oak. Well balanced and flavorful. Dark saison character. Complex and intriguing. A fun beer. This was really solid. I'd definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Brett is a bit subdued but overall a nice beer. Probably not worth the price tag, but still enjoyable."
""
"Prost!"
"O: A tasty beer. Reserved on the brett, and well balanced with malts and hops. The brett comes through more as it warms, but it is never in your face."
""
""
"Feel medium and nice rolling carb but couldn't save it"
"O - lots of intangibles in this special beer. Very well down, great Brett beer. Glad I have 5 more!"
""
""
"O: terrible experience overall. I had to use a Sam Adams Rebel IPA as a chaser to finish this. To sum it up: this tastes like a Smarties factory caught on fire while the brewery next door was coolshipping a beer."
"O - Just a weird beer, not my style at all"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a grower not a first hit sip. Gets better as it warms to room temperature. I wouldn't recommend refridgerating this one. Very complex but very well balanced and not overbearing in any part of its flavor components. Very different wild than others I have tried. Kind of expensive but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting sour. Sour berries and some roasted malt. It's borderline like a light sour stout. But more grainy than you'd expect from a sour stout. Hard to define, doesn't really conform to any standard or have any comparisons that I can make easily."
""
"O - this beer has some good things going for it, but the one thing that really detracts from this beer I believe is how damn successful Allagash is at creating American Wild Ale. Stacked up against there other offerings this one falls a little short. HOWEVER, I still think this beer exhibits something that other breweries have yet to master...nuance and balance. Allagash have mastered nuance and balance in there wild ales and while this is not there best effort it is better than many wild ales I've had because of the balance and nuance. I think this beer is rated unfairly low because there is a preconceived notion of what an american wild ale should taste like...or maybe I'm just an allagash fan boy."
""
"M: Medium bodied. You would assume leading to full with color."
""
"O-nothing very compelling here, I enjoy dark sours but this really did bring much to the table and was far from beers like Tart of Darkness"

"Bottled 10-16-13"
"I'm not usually a big fan of dark sours but this is surprisingly enjoyable. The slight Brett presence works well with the sweet and roasty flavors present in the base. Worth a try!"
"Poured a dark brown body with decent head and lace and an aroma of chocolate, sour and tart fruit like berries although there is a mild fruit sweetness as well in the aroma. A medium bodied beer that at times got chewey and/or sticky. Has this sour, funky brett aspect (also a little spicy) that is combined, quite well I must say, with some chocolatey/vanilla overtones and this touch of sweet fruit that again I can only think of ""berries"" (more straw or blue than rasp or black) for a really good beer that is worth having again."
""
""
"Pours a dark cola brown topped by an extremely fluffy three finger cream colored head. Exceptional retention with tons of lacing. Whiffs of dark cherries, accents of dark chocolate, balsamic vinegar, and mixed berries on the nose. Opens with dark chocolate and caramel joined by dark cherries, blueberries, and other dark fruit notes. Finishes fairly dry with tart cherries, a bit of balsamic vinegar, light oak and mild rye spice. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation silky smooth and creamy. Really wonderful, unique brew. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's alternately sweet and sour. A beer to savor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Tasty, but doesn't blow me away. This tastes more like a black saison than a wild ale, not very sour. I think I will pick up another bottle to let it age and see if it gets more sour."
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer at all. Kinda expensive but I bet it will age well."
"Overall - Decent beer that has some very tasty moments. The flavors tend to clash a little bit, though."
""
"Bottle from Fishpaws while visiting family in MD. Corked and caged pours dark brown with a creamy khaki colored one finger plus head. Aroma is big funky vinegar and wet dog, black cherry, tart apricots. The flavor is tart up front with black cherry, but then fades into an interesting taste of roasted malt and dry rye--still lightly funky and sweet--then back into fruity black cherries that linger a bit. Relatively light bodied and perhaps a bit more watered down than one would like. Medium carbonation. A unique beer worth trying, but not sure it is worth stocking up on. Maybe the tartness will come out more with some age?"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an impressively complex and tasty wild ale. If anything, I expected more tartness, especially from the aroma. This is really a wonderful beer, and I wish there were more of it to go around."
""
"Verdict: An ambitious brew and one that started out great. The aroma is great and really emphasizes the fruit that brett can bring out, but the beer itself is just a little too heavy and malty on the tongue. I appreciate the gusto it takes to brew a beer like this and can't wait to try the next Allagash Coolship release."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a fairly creamy and vigorous light tan head that does not dissipate quickly and appears to last quite a while. The beer itself is a dark black with hints of dark, ruby red that adds a nice shade to the black. The smell is very good and certainly worth writing about. The beer has a strong funk (tart) smell from the Brett in addition to hops, a bit of the roast, all of which to form a cherry smell when it warms up. Some of the raw wheat gets through and combines well with the Brett but easily gets lost if you are not looking for the wheat. The roasted character also comes out a bit to make the combined smell similar to berry. The hops do not seem to be very present if at all. The taste is a bit different from the smell but still similar in some respects. The funk is still the strongest flavor but is less sharp than it is in the smell. Rather, the funk (tartness) seems to mix with the other flavors and comes out a similar flavor to cherries. The light roast also makes an appearance and the hops are make an appearance in the aftertaste. The beer feels bubbly and smooth but not crisp, which makes it an easy but unique drink. Overall, a very good beer and one that I will get again if I can swallow the price tag."
""
"Dark brown color with ruby highlights and a decent sized tan head that dissipates quickly. Moderate level of earthy brett aroma along with hints of caramel, cherry, chocolate and brown sugar. The flavor follows the aroma, a bit tame on the sour/wild front. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick bubbly mouthfeel. Decent brew, but feels like its not quite done yet. I know 100% brett beers don't get horribly tart and or funky, but for me this one was just meh."
""
"O-Disappointing."
""
""
"The sour tartness just isn't strong enough, then again not all American Wild Ales are necessarily sours but for those looking for a sour ale will sorely be disappointed, so check your expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has a mellow tartness to it, dark woody malt, dry lingering mst aftertaste of musty Brett yeast. Medium bodied, fairly drinkable. Overall it was nice to try, but not something I'd revisit personally."
""
""
"O: A very nice and interesting AWA. While the nose suggests a bit more funk and sour notes, the taste is very subdued in those areas. Nice to sip on and let the complexities of the Brett come out as it warms. The roast also makes it quite interesting. Certainly worth trying"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was a fantastic drink, full of flavors and feels that will satisfy most BAs - part wild ale, dark ale, and pale ale, with a great malt bill including rye, wheat, and barley, and an assembly of complementary hops. I don't know what wild ale fans expect, but I thought this a beer particularly worthy of even non-wild ale fans' attention, as it was (IMO) a style-transcendent beer. Probably be too limited to get out there to everyone, so don't pass up on a bottle if you see it."

""
""
""
""
"Man, I had this on draft at an Allagash event last year and remember liking it quite a bit. I decided to try a bottle since the price was dropped to $6.99, and it just wasn't the same. It had a roasty, bitter character that was sort up unpleasant. The tartness was minimal and the beer just didn't seem as lively as it was fresh. I just don't feel like the roasty bitterness from the malts and slight tang from the brett worked very well together. It isn't terrible, bu this is the only miss I've had from Allagash's corked and caged wild series."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very dark brown with a soft-looking, beige head. Smells different than I expected...Brett, tart, juicy berries, grapes, and leather. No roasted malt character to speak of. Flavors are similar with Brett, more dark fruits like blackberries, grapes, and plums, and some very light phenolics in the back. Fluffy, tart, medium body. Drinks lighter than its strength. Another tasty beverage from Allagash."

""

""

"overall this is some great stuff. 100% recommend."
""

"Thanks to joefuzz for the tip on this one. Decided to head over to the tap room for lunch to see what the hub bub was all about. Showed in a snifter. Maroon purple with minimal head. Smell is grape and dark fruit. Nice sweetness. Really smooth, easy drinker. Not really all that sour, but good tartness on the finish. Word is this might go to bottles, paint me excited. Great sour for those who don't love overly sour beer. Will be interesting to see what time does to it if it does get bottled."
"Pours just like the name...midnight black with a tiny ring of bubbles. Smells like tart grapes with a little bit of plums. Taste is not as sour as the nose let's on, more funky with a slight sour grape twing. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with soft carbonation. Overall this beer blew me away, I hope more of this makes it into my market."

"Real neat fun beer, like this sweet light fruit and brett mix."
""
""
""
"I typically don't like dark sour ales but this has really made me think otherwise. Quite a good beer. It's drinkable yet complex. It reminds me of Dannon Mixed Berry yogurt. That is how much of a fruit profile this beer has. This one surprised me. Good one."
""
"o - Overall I like this one quite a bit though not as much as Golden Brett. Light fruity pebbles in the nose especially, but a good mix of brett sour fruits and roasted notes. Well worth checking out."

"Had during Brewvival 2013! Served from tap into a Brewvival sampler shaker. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a minimal tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, big funk, dark fruit, wood, earth, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I will come out and say it right out of the gate. I’m not the biggest fan of soured/funked stouts, etc. However I do mind giving them a try. This one was one I’m glad that I gave a shot. The funk on this one was definitely the dominate factor going on here with some of the notes from the base brew taking a backseat. The brett didn’t really add any balance to the brew which is what hurt my flavor score on this one slightly, but it was still a brew that I’m glad I got the chance to try and wouldn’t mind doing so in the future again."
""
"O - Would buy the shit out of this if Allagash put this into bottle production. Such a great funky stout and the flavors here are interwoven so well. Enjoyed this immensely and highly recommend it."
