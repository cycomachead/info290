"Very light and crisp this drinks a lot like the juice that it resembles. It pours like grapefruit juice so it no wonder that the flavor is dominate. Light lemon and oranges filter through as a tropical coconut finishes. The flavor is delicious but perhaps not assertive enough."

"Pours a completely translucent pale straw color with some bubbles clinging to the glass. Looks like a champagne. Nose has a wonderful brett character with hay, lemon peel, underripe pear, slight breadiness. Flavor is delicate tartness with some citrus, touch of funk, white grapes. Body is a little light, but this is so quaffable. A beautifully done brett farmhouse. Among my favorites."
""
""
"Pours light golden in color with a white fizzy head. Smell has a tart lemon rind aroma along with tons of brett with notes of barnyard, and lots of saison yeast aromas. Taste follows nose with very light dry lemon rind tartness and farmhouse yeast"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light clear golden color, pretty nice looking beer.  Slightly sour aroma with a bit of hay.  In the taste, lemony tartness and a nice earthy flavor.  Lemongrass, apple cider vinegar, sharp little funky sour note.  Light bodied ale, lacks true crispness or dryness, mellow feel.  Overall, this is damn tasty and a worthy American Wild Ale ."

"While the nose promised an excessive funkiness, the taste is comparably tame. It begins with white lemon peel, among bready malts and a gentle, strawy, wheat foundation. The carbonation is very lively, pointing out the refreshing sour qualities, while the actual sourness remains quite moderate, hiding beneath the wheat. Got a green apple fruitiness, as well as a yoghurty of flavor to it, which shines during the semi-dry, but not particular sour finish. Drinks fairly easy, very smooth for a Sour, while trying a little too hard to stay in balance, by not providing a convincing acidic sourness."
""
""
""
"O- a nice showcase of brett, however the aroma was much more funky than the taste"
""
""
"One of the best examples of Brett beers on the market."
"O-This is a pretty tasty beer if you are into brett. The beer does a good job of showing off the tanginess that brett can impart and it is dry without getting chalky. The feel is a really good match for the flavors too. A nice effort by Wicked Weed."

"Pour is pale straw yellow, slightly hazed, with a good bit of tight white head and a fair bit of lace.  Nose is stale sweat, lemon, husky stinky brett, pineapple rind, notes of pepper, and some fresh leather.  Taste is strong brett pineapple, a hint of sweaty leather, musky rind, strong carb, light body, prickly on the throat."
"Bottle as an extra in trade. Thanks! Pours hazy bright yellow with a big fluffy white head. Lots of tart funky Brett on the aroma, hay, light fruits, more funk. Yup, it's a Brett beer. Extremely light bodied, very little oak or vinous notes from the wine barrels, but with a refreshing funky bretty influence that makes it very pleasant. Super light fruit sweetness. High carbonation. All in all this is nice, but maybe even too light on the flavor. Definitely worth a try for Brett fans."

"O - A bit more sour on the nose than the actual taste. But, that doesn't take away from anything as this was a joy to drink."

"Spent grains, wet hay, oddly heavy on the tongue. Little to no tartness or sourness and the heaviness and light carbonation just allow the odd flavors to sit on the tongue. I guess my palate is broken, but i just didn't understand or enjoy this very much."
""
"I really wanted to like this beer but I kept wishing it was Temptation. Just OK."
"O: Infinitely crushable. Tart and flavorful while maintaining a high level of drinkability. Love it. Could drink a ton of this. Nice job wicked weed."
""
""
""
""
"Update: I have had a few bottles since my initial review and upon reevaluation and now that I have learned to appreciate this style. I think this beer is very well made. It has a nice crisp lemon/citrus flavor, its a very well made beer. Its a great one to cleanse the palate after drinking some strong stouts that might linger."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, its ok.  Solid beer, but nothing really sands out.  I was a bit disappointed as I have high expectations for WW.  3.75"

"The flavor has melon, peach, and tropical fruit notes. Lots of fruity esters coming off from the yeast. There's a Brett funk drying. The beer is refreshing and falls off of the palate nicely."

"Bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a clear golden yellow color with a white cap. The smell is a little tropical with a dry and grainy feel before cheesy notes of funk evolve. The taste is dry with neutral grain flavoring, slightly husky, blending to notes that are mildly tropical and vinous. Some oakiness towards the back has almost a cinnamin spice note about it. This is light bodied, modestly carbonated and very easy drinking. The beauty in this beer is the subtle nuance but I dont think I liked it enough to want to seek out any more."

"Very bready and bretty, with horse blanket and feet. Flavor is fairly tart, with earthy, brett character"
""
""
"Pours a clear straw upon which a frothy, bubbly head forms but settles to a fine ring.  Smell is stinky, funky Brett...flowers, leather, lemon, and pear over a touch of biscuit.  The flavor dials up the floral notes a touch, reminiscent of Orval, but less intense and with an added apple and grape juicy tartness and some oatmeal-like grain.  Tart, but not excessively so, and not so funky as the aroma.  Dry and super refreshing.  Second pour with the yeast is less funky and more floral.  A very nice, refreshing, snappy Brett beer."
""
"I'm impressed with Wicked Weed. They have a very unique strain of brett that's pineapple heavy and it works well in most of the beers I've had. Serenity shows nice fruit qualities, a touch of funk, and sky high drinkability. I wouldn't pass this up if I came across a bottle."

"I picked up a case of this brew in Hickory, NC, the first round of bottles that came out of the brewery. It pours a golden straw color with minimal head. Lots of lemon zest in the nose and the taste follows suit. The funk is very mild, so I see why some folks aren't fully behind this brew; however, IMO, this is probably the best introduction to sours I've ever had. I've turned a couple people on to this brew... who have already embraced the style and tried much more tart offerings they wouldn't have touched otherwise. I could drink this all day... and maybe I will."

"This is an oddly unique beer. Lots of flavors combining in unusual ways, and a mouthfeel that adds character and brightness."
""
"Pours straw colored with a very fizzy white head. Not much aroma other than some sour yeast. Taste is very carbonated, crisp, funky sour, a little lemon, and finishes pretty slick. It is like a sour, light bodied champagne to me. I will throw out a disclaimer that I don't get into this style much. I do like some farmhouse ales, but this one isn't for me. I think it is pretty smooth and drinkable - for those who do, give it a try."
""
""
"O - Light and subtle, a touch of butter. Solid."

"O: Extremely enjoyable, easy to drink, and a wonderful showcase for the brett. I could easily drink this one over and over again and I understand why it is a medal winner from GABF. A very well constructed beer with good aromas, flavors, and mouthfeel."

"This is the type of beer that I wish was feasible to have all the time. I would have this beer every week if it had that sort of availability. The brett provides such a unique bite and estery flavor and the carb just really gives everything a jolt. There isn't much to the nose beyond a typical brett funk, but that's just fine by me. This beer doesn't need any adjuncts. It is a showcase of brett and absolutely delicious."

"Bottle poured into a WW snifter after spending about 45 minutes in the fridge. Straw-yellow color, mostly clear, with a small white head; minor retention and a few dabs of lacing on the glass. Barnyard funk and oak in the aroma, notes of lacto tartness and light sugary sweetness. Tasty, bretty yeast, barnyard funk, oak, white grapes, light tingly tartness, toasted grains. Light-medium body, moderate carbonation crisp, and highly drinkable. There wasn't anything overly amazing/crazy about this beer, but there didn't really have to be...it was a solid and unpretentious barrel-aged saison. I could and would easily drink this any time."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a pale, golden-rod coloring with a steady flow of carbonation. Thin, sparse, white, bubbly head. Nose of tart white grape, Chardonnay, and woody characteristics. Smells sour and smooth. Flavors are tangy sweet lemon and white grape, toasted grain backbone, and subtle sour funk. Very refreshing. Light and crisp bodied, with a tangy and sour aftertaste. The finish is light, crisp, and clean. Solid beer!"

"my second and another stellar beer from wicked weed. this is a little more basic than the sour ipa, just a funky bretty wheat based brew, done in white wine barrels. its a really pale brew, frosted blonde with a great big white head with nice thick foam lace left behind. it smells like something out of crooked stave of jolly pumpkin, a curious bacterial and brett culture than really makes the mouth water. there is a real light wheat malt here, and the yeast does the vast majority of the flavoring. plenty of oak and white grape character from the barrel, earthy and funky, which meshes with the yeast really well. its not super complex, but its interesting enough, not lacking anything, but a heavy dry hop with a cool varietal could make this even better i think. light on the hop character as it is. acidic more from the wine barrel than the yeast i think, but a pleasant dry tartness finishes it out. carbonation is interesting. its active but not poppy, feather light feeling, just gentle and comfortable. overall a beer i would love to age a little and let develop, but one thats drinking awfully well right now. a good first few offerings from these guys, really fun stuff they are doing."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, lemon, acidic, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt, grain, Brett, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but seems to have a more sour aspect in the aroma to me."
"I love this beer. One of the best by WW. Highly recommended and if you can do it side by side with a Russian River Temptation."

"I see this beer developing into a real treasure in another 6-12 months; maybe even longer. All the reviews I have seen show people complaining that it isn’t funky our sour enough for them. Honestly, this tastes just like it should. It is not a wild ale. It is a Saison aged in wine barrles with Brett, and it smells and tastes liek it should. People get so upset when a style isn’t what they think it should be. It is in the ballpark of the style and a wonderful introductory offering from Wicked Weed in terms of bottle options. Search it out with confidence"

"The beer is hazy and pale yellow with a thin head that fizzes, quickly receding to a thin, wispy layer. Aromas include grain, brettanomyces, lemon, oak. Similar flavor, finishing with a mild puckering sensation. Fairly light in body. A touch of earthiness with tart citrus. Overall, a tasty beer."

"O- Damn. Now I see why they selected this beer to be their first bottle release. A perfect example of how beautiful Brett can be."

"This pours a cloudy pale gold/hazy straw in color. There’s an aroma of wet hay and funky straw, with some lemongrass. 100% Brett fermented, and that characteristic shines through. The flavor is lightly tart, crisp, and Brett-tastic."
""
"D: This was a great brew that perfectly showcased what brett can be. The scent and taste were great, and the body was fitting. The finish was clean and not very harsh, so it was actually pretty easy to drink. Not extreme for the style, but very well crafted and very enjoyable."
""
""
""

""
"O: a good beer overall. I'd like a bit more depth and carbonation, but it's tasty and drinkable."
