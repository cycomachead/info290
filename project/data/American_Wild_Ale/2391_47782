The grape is present and overly sweet up front with a strong white wine like alcohol backbone. The flavor dies out with a mild earthiness. Carbonated with large bubbles which didn't help the mouthfeel. I ended up drinking a glass and switching to the white wine my wife had opened. Not a bad beer by any means just disappointing given the price and my expectations. I wasn't expecting Vigneronne but this beer really needs some funk to balance out the sweetness and add some complexity.","brianmandell","Jun 30, 2014"

Taste is very similar as well. It has only a tiny bit of tartness to it, definitely the least sour tasting cascade ive had. The white grape flavor is very prominent and pronounced and it lasts through the finish and lingers. Its definitely what it promises. No tartness almost at all is quite a shock..not sure as intended? body is medium and carbonation is quite low. I will have to try another bottle to see if the tartness is just off in this one.

Aroma of slight sour vinegar, oak, grapes, citrus peel, and maybe even some Brett. Flavor is lightly tart, dry with some oakiness, and an interesting bit of grape sort of like grape soda rather than grape juice. Hmmm. Some vinous notes as expected. Medium bodied from the sweetness, but rather spritzy with the carbonation. Cascade managed to make a $31 beer taste like Dave Chappelle's Grape Drink. Not drain pouring this since its not completely offensive and cost that much, but what the eff? Seriously what a ripoff.","BMMillsy","Apr 18, 2014"

Its restrained tart character topped off with a nice yeast fruit character and dry almost spicy finish, similar to a saison, makes for an amazing experience. A must try and definitely a worthwhile reason to give Cascade brewing way too much money that your wiling to spend most of the time. IN this case, wort the $25ish bucks.","MarioM","Mar 17, 2014"

The price point on their beers just doesn't seem to back up what they deliver. Either that or they need to do 375's at half the price. Cascade, learn to work the brettanomyces,,, please.

I taste a lot of oak in this, sweet and earthy, and it pairs well with the sweetness of the grapes. however, the fruitiness takes a lot away from the sour properties, which really only come in as acidity on the finish. not a lot of tartness or funk or pep to this, and it feels a little dull as a result. it could stand more carbonation too, to lighten up the fruit. I think the concept is good and the flavors are good, if a little muted, but the overall product is in need of a refinement. it is a full step or two below the elite sours on the market, but still a quality brew. this bottle had a little age on it, so maybe it hasn't held up super well. will need to try fresh to compare.","StonedTrippin","Oct 23, 2013"

Grape forward nose, wine-like aromas, acidic, no hops to speak of. Once fully warmed, this beer was a revelation as to how grapes can be used in beers, given Ron's background in the wine industry no surprise. The grapes infuse a sweetness balanced by the lacto's sourness, dry tart finish, a bit of light funk once fully warmed, dry hay. Good grief.

Aroma is tart with grapes and stone fruit, lactic and woody. Very tasty, sour fruits--grape, apricot, lemon, orange--but not bracingly lip-puckering, which was nice, lactic and well-tamed acetic notes, Chardonnay, grass, subtle oak in just the right quantity, sweet biscuity malts in the background. Medium-bodied, a bit sticky, nearly no alcohol taste or burn. Yep, this was one drinkable wild ale, and it paired brilliantly with my dinner.

There is a touch of vinegar in this fairly sour grape beer. All in all, it's another great package delivered by the folks of Cascade.

Silk like smoothness, and the finest carbonation bubbles, really well done in that regard. ;ots of sour in here right up front with frapes and light lemon like citrus taking over. Rolling through some nice notes of cherry then came over me. Decent funkiness in through the middle and the finish, but it was actually almost blended out by a cherry like sweetness and more hints at a sugary touch.

Luckily one of my old college roommates, who has since relocated to Portland, was nice enough to send me this bottle as well as a bottle of Vlad the ImpAler. This beer looks beautiful. It poured a cloudy and murky bright apricot orange. The head appeared ravenous and acidic as the poofy off white head appeared to consume itself and leave only a few traces left to lace the glass. It smells of Golden Delicious apples and freshly cut pears. It begins tart before finishing with the pear like sweetness. It's one of the most appealing Wilds that I've seen and smelled yet. The flavors are tart and musty. It has barnyard without having the funk, which is very interesting. It has some light white wine aspects. It's really quite diverse and it finishes rather dry. It drinks medium bodied with excellent crispness and kind of sucks the saliva from your mouth after awhile but it does leave behind some slight tartness and sweet pear. This is a very good wild. It's really tempting me to try the Vlad sooner rather than later.","aasher","Dec 18, 2010"

Great citrus fruit flavors surface mid palate and it finishes oaky and dirty. Definitely a dry finish. The mouthfeel is pleasant but I really thought this beer might have a bit more of a bubbly character. It comes off a little flat. Even with the lack of head and carbonation this beer is fantastic.

The brew was light to medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet, acidic, fruity, funky, oaky, tart, and slight dry finish.

Overall this was an excellent example of the style in my opinion. It had a very nice flavor and good aroma going on here. I really enjoyed the fact that there wasn't really a funk to this one and just sour notes. Hope to try more offerings from Cascade in the future as this one set the bar pretty high.

Nose is large wine barrel, white grapes, some other light fruits. Quite a lot of wet wood. Major white grape in the flavor. Some musty, sweaty brett and of course oak. The idea is similar to Cuvee de Castleton, but it's not as tight, and a bit muddled. Sour and puckering on the finish.

3.92,-7.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"It is lacking carbonation, but the body is light enough that it is manageable. It would be nice to have some more carbonation. Overall, the flavor is great and the aftertaste is nice. The feel is solid enough that I enjoyed it.","AleWatcher","Jul 27, 2010"
4.47,5.9,3.5,4,4.5,5,5,"D: I feel like this is the perfect example of the Cascade wilds that I've had up to this point. Very one dimension but so tasty, with a perfect mouthfeel and incredible drinkability. The Vine almost seems like a better, sweeter champagne and I could go at this one all day. I can't wait to break out another bottle and pick up some more. Definitely worth the price of purchase!","SpeedwayJim","Jul 25, 2010"
4.62,9.5,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Overall I was a very big fan of this beer - I love the flavors of American grapes (Concorde, muscadines, and scuppernongs) and I find that it's difficult to accurately get that flavor in a beer. This beer succeeds completely and has additional complexity from other dark fruits and the malt bill. Well worth a shot.","glid02","Jul 24, 2010"
4.55,7.8,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Very tasty sour, its not super funky though thats probably because its so fresh, you could definitely taste the earthiness of the grapes. It pours a golden light brown color that is beautiful with a somewhat off white creamy head. Its not super complicated but in terms of being a very solid sour that has the potential to really grow into itself I certainly think that it can get there. Would love to try one with some age on it.","psiweaver","Jul 22, 2010"

4.23,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a honey amber color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The nose is pretty wild, showcasing vinegar and sour funk, along with a very noticeable grape and berry aroma. Fortunately, the dead moose and headcheese aroma aren't too overpowering in this beer (though it's definitely there). On the palate, the beer is pretty impressive, with the sour funk acting as a backdrop for the grape and berry flavors. There's also some noticeable banana, vanilla and even a hint of bubblegum, all wrapped around a core of sour funk. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with the beer ending with a long, mouthpuckeringly sour zip on the finish. Drinkability is pretty good, though I found the sour funk to be a bit of a distraction after a while. Nevertheless, I thought this another solid beer from Cascade, with enough other stuff going on flavor and aroma-wise to keep the sour component from becoming overwhelming. Impressive.","John_M","Jul 17, 2010"

3.69,-12.6,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3,"D: A sipper, the high acidity gives me no choice. I liked the beer, in the end though I think I wanted a little sugar/fruit to counterbalance the acid. I know there's grapes, but they're hard to find. A solid beer, interesting to try, but at $20 there are plenty of other AWA's and Cascades I'd rather get.","Halcyondays","Jul 13, 2010"
4.27,1.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Almost layered looking pour, darker on top, honey gold on the bottom. Quickly dissipating head leaves no lacing. Etching from the Duvel Tulip keeps the bubbles coming though. Despite the seeming stillness, this is a highly carbonated beer, prickly and high on the tongue. This mellows as the beer sits. First wafts had me fearful of an artificial grape sweetness - laffy taffy and sweet tarts. Thankfully, that fades. Nice lactic tartness, grape skins, very faint funk. Some hints of apple juice. A very mellow tart sipper, nothing in your face. Much better as the drink warms allowing more character of the oak, and at long last, the alcohol to shine through. For a nearly 9% beer, you would never know it. Class act all around.","Onibubba","Jul 12, 2010"
4.32,2.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy light-watermelon color with a thin lacing of white on the head. Nose is full of peach and passion fruits, like some dry champagnes. Taste is tart but not overly sour, peach, mango and tangerine/lime come through in the taste. Finishes with a nice bite of sourness, and the somewhat stronger alcohol content never really comes through. Excellently crafted brew, definitely worth a shot for any sour lovers.","saintwarrick","Jul 12, 2010"

On the contrary, it's a great sour...much like a gueuze. Flavor is very, very tart...with tons of oakiness.

4,-5.2,4,4,3.5,4,5,"Pours a murky, muddled medium orange with a big fluffy but broken white head that remains atop the glass as its drank. Aroma is tart with green apple and grapes with some slight funk and vanilla notes. The flavor is sweet upfront and then turns immediately tart with sour fruit and the sourness is fairly moderate and pleasant. Its light bodied and very crisp and effervescent. I really find this beer intriguing. Its very delicate and refined. Definitely one of the more moderate sours I've had from Cascade and is certainly another top notch beverage.","DiabolikDUB","Aug 09, 2009"
3.98,-5.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The taste is pleasant but falls short. Very acetic and there is a nice cinnamon or some other spice that falls in the background. The floral scent appears in taste form and is well done. This beers is full in flavor but lacks complexity. The mouthfeel is a little bit too sharp and dry for liking which comes from the white grapes. I could, however, drink this one all night long.","CoolJosh","Aug 09, 2009"
4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall an impressive beer from the Cascade series. Alot of people might slam this because it isn't the most sour palate thrashing beer around, but make no mistake, this is a very well crafted and delicate beer, and is certainly a tart brew. I would be willing to bet the brewer acheived almost exactly what they wanted to with this. There is great balance between tart dryness and white grape flavor. I would love to have another bottle of this to see how it does with a bit of age. An interesting beer, and one i would certainly drink again.","AKBelgianBeast","Jul 28, 2009"

The light muscat sweetness and Moscato D'Asti carbonation breaks up the funk enough to avoid that pucker that is satisfying yet on some level a little painful.

The flavor is very similar to a big Flanders Red, with a wonderful balance of malts and tarts, but with a grape presence replacing the cherries. Layers of flavors bouncing around and playing off each other include light caramel, grapes, biscuit, oak, tangerines and lemons. These are definitely some 'sour grapes' I am enjoying!","1000Bottles","Beers"
4.72,11.8,4,4.5,5,4,5,"spiced sour blonde ale blended and aged in oak with an ale containing white grapes. insane. very light in color, like a straight lambic. less sour and funky than dry and tart, white wine is a great comparison. the grape produces more tropical fruit notes.. starfruit and kiwi most noticeably. there is a hint some bitter citrus too, i believe some sort of citrus peel is among the 'spices', although there is no obvious dry spicing. the beer finishes smooth though with the eventual emergence of more traditional sour beer flavor over the winey dryness. the alcohol is unimaginable, strangely, or perhaps its lost to the complexity of flavors. i need another bottle of this all to myself in order to savor and wrap my mind around. one of the best beers ive had in some time, head and shoulders above cuvee de castleton.","goodbyeohio","0"
