"a beer i have missed the opportunity to try on many occasions, so a real treat to finally encounter it again. i was taken aback by its dark color, so may framboise beers are just pale wheat bases with the fruit. this appears to be a rich brown ale, deep and rich looking, with a red accent from the fruit. not what i expected but very cool. the nose on this one is a great mix of chocolate malt from the base beer and tart freshness from the berries, i am surprised how tart they really are, rising above the sweet richness of the brown ale base, which is quite robust on the grain front, toasted and desserty. the bacterial aspect of this is cool too, it seems to exacerbate the intensity of the fruit, and brings a series pucker to the finish of this. the malt chocolate thing comes back a touch, and it feels like a nice valentines day dessert before the acidity washes it out. the lost abbey is famous for a reason, this is the only beer of its kind i have ever tasted, and think it is more than worthy of its high praise. as flavorful a beer as any."

"D: Still just starting to explore Wilds but this was a real nice find on tap. A little heavy on the vinegar but with some great sour cherry and raspberry notes and just the right amount of acidity. Probably won’t be my most favorite sour ale but has some great balance and depth of character. One of Lost Abby better concoctions I would say. Makes me a little less gun shy to go grab some bottles now."

"Terrific american sour. raspberries are huge and apparent. extremely unique and awesome. sourness is perfect. oak is there and balances it well. would drink this everyday."

"Pours an odd muddy river brownish red. Champagne head. Nose is raspberries, muscadine grapes, and a little funk. Taste is raspberry, sour cherry, and lots of delicious. Dry, carbonated body, again not unlike a champagne. This is one of my favorite sours that actually tastes like the fruit it claims. Wife picked this one out and she gets 2 thumbs up."

"O - this is just about the best fruit beer I've ever had, and certainly the best American-made fruited sour I've tried. Simply a masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another excellent one from Lost Abbey. I had this side by side with Duck Duck Gooze and Cuvée de Tomme and this may have been my favorite of the bunch. Definitely worth seeking out if you can get your hands on it."

"O: This was very good. I felt like it wasn't quite as complex as the best fruited sours, and the increased alcohol heat seemed a little out of place. But still quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a nice deep clear ruby red with purplish head. Nose is pungent with bright notes of raspberry. Heavy fruit paired with some balsamic vinegar notes present on nose with some mild earth at the end. The taste is a slightly tamed down version of the nose. Raspberries are all over the place balancing between fruity sweetness and acidic tartness. Moderate carbonation with a somewhat fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, this was one of the highlights for me at this years FoBAB. The balance is great and the raspberry character is strong."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a brownish red haze, off white head that dies down slow but not rapidly, has nice carbination and smells tart like raspberries and cherries. Taste is sour, not quite puckering with a mouthfeel a little thicker than other framboise, upfront sour to raspberries to an almost caramel malt, maybe a little barrel? This one goes down quick and I definitely appreciate the higher abv in regards to the style. A lot of raspberry, acid going on balanced with the barrel on the back end."

"O: Really enjoyed this one. Seemed to get more sour as the glass got lower. I was in the mood for a complex and very tart sour, and oh boy did I get one. Good job Tomme and friends, yet another keeper."

"O/D-One of my more sought after beers. What a beaut! I feel very happy 'unchecking' this from my Wants list. Jesus, I love raspberry sours."
""

""
"Intelligent balance of wild yeast and fruity excess with the tempering influence of the oak treatment. Loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"mf: high carbonation, could be a little smoother with the balance of tartness and fruit."

"A"
"I always think this style is good, but this went down easy. So smooth."
""
""
""
"O: OK wild ale. little too much of vinegar (acetic) for my taste."

"A bit one dimensional but pulls off that one dimension. Thanks for this one kojevergas!"

"i recommend picking this one up. i feel like if i tried this last year i would have hated it, but the more i drink sours/wild ales, the more i can appreciate a beer like this. almost wine-like at times, with a raspberry overall tone, lots of wooden barrel.. lots to enjoy, but again - this is on the vinegary flanders red type style, BUT does have that huge lemony-acidic flavor that overpowers most of everything else!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 - I'm very glad that I tried this beer picked up on our recent trip to the West Coast; it's a suped-up framboise that I certainly enjoyed; however, I prefer more muted and refreshing flavors from the style (thinking of Lindemann's), and this one was too intense for the style for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I actually felt embarrassed bringing this to the tasting. We did enjoy it for the fruity, tarty flavors, but the acid and extreme sourness provides intensity with no degree of satisfaction in return. I know this wasn't infected or anything, but I simply feel it was horribly unbalanced. If you want to try this, go ahead, but the Lost Abbey definitely has better sours for the same price and availability in their catalogue."
""
""
""
"Split a bottle with a couple friends. Poured into a wine glass, the appearance is dark red, a little brownish with a small head. The nose has raspberries, vinegar, oak and funk. It really comes with sourness before even drinking it. Upon tipping some back, I taste raspberries, cherries, caramel and some red wine. Mouthfeel has a lot of carbonation, that sourness lingers with you. A great wild/sour beer from a U.S. brewer. I would love if we could get this in Connecticut or even New York."
""
"O - Excellent sour here! About the only one that can hold a flame to Supplication."
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent sour. If your into the style I'd say you have to try this one."

"Drinkability – I think it is a bit too tart to be super drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tart rather than sweet to start, but hugely berry flavored. Some bitterness for the finish. A slight sweetness creeps in along with the vinegar edge. It does taste just like raspberries, which the brewer says were added again during the year-long wine barrel aging. This is actually quite sippable, though unmistakably a serious sour."
"I can see why Lost Abbey has the reputation for brewing great sours and I can't wait to try some more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dull, yeast speckled, hazy light brown with a thin tan head. The nose is sweet with potent oak and raspberries. The taste is slightly funky, followed by tart raspberries, a caramelized sugar sweetness, and a semi-dry, lingering raspberry cake finish. Great malt presence that serves to accentuate the dark fruitiness of the raspberries. The mouthfeel is solidly medium bodied, slightly bready, with great oaked fruit character, and a slightly salty, dry finish. Very enjoyable beer that's completely worth the effort to obtain."
""
""
""
"The palate opens bright, fruity and sharp. Jammy raspberries, minimally seedy, with a little bit of strawberry character as well, the fruity expression is excellent. This is followed by the sour base, where the lactic acidity pairs quite well with the fruit. There's also a hint of lemon as well as some acetic character. A little frothy/yogurty as well, the mid-palate is a little chunky/yeasty. Some oak tannins are present, rather well-integrated with the profile. The finish is strongly lactic, scrubbing the palate, almost a little too much, leaving a clean, yogurt sourness and flavor along a clean raspberry sourness. It does, however, feel a little watery. Medium-medium light in body with moderate carbonation, the softness/fullness that the yeast/proteins lend does clash with the brightness of the fruit, but ultimately, I'd say this is one of the better American brewed raspberry sours I've had. Well done, Tomme!"
""
""
""
""
"Very nice, raspberry a bit hidden, more of a Flanders style beer with abit of sweet malt in there."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid sour. Good funk and nice fruit. Works really well."
""
"O: this is a phenomenal sour... I'm not even usually a fan of framboise, bit the tartness and balance on this one are superb, one of my favorite sours hands down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this makes a great sour. The sourness and raspberry flavors are balanced very well. It's not overly sour or funky. Highly drinkable."
""
"This beer poured out as a murky looking red color with an off white pinkish foamy head on top. The retention here is a good and so is the lacing on the glass. Very pretty looking beer all around. The smell of the beer gives off plenty of raspberry aromas some nice fresh oak and some subtle funk in there too. The taste is excellent in my opinion. There is an explosion of raspberry with the tartness of the fruit itself mixing with the oak from the barrels and the wild yeast. The sourness of the beer is very tolerable in my opinion and still remains very easy to drink. The after taste brings out some of the malt in the base of the beer as the fruit subsides, there is also some hints of cocoa in there as well in the late finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is good, it's a little thin but had a moderate carbonation to it. Overall it was highly enjoyable, I would order this beer again in a heartbeat. Very glad i got to try this, If I ever have it again I want to have it with a rich chocolate dessert of some kind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rather murky chocolate cherry with a brown pink fuzz on top. Lots of tart raspberries, some must, barn, lemon and oak. Nice hint of vanilla as well. Flavor is oaky with plenty of fruit flavor and slight bitterness. Also has the aftertaste of a really rich raspberry truffle. Some bits of wood and vine. I like the flavor on this one quite a bit. Medium bodied with sharp, tight fleeting carb and a wet finish. Nice beer, probably one of the better I've had from the Abbey."
""
""
""
"O - Tart and sweet, nice balance, oaky tart lasts a long time."
""
""
""
""
"O- I haven't had too many framboises, but I definitely enjoyed drinking this one. Not my favorite sour I've had and definitely not the sourest, but definitely a nice enjoyable beer that I'm glad I had the opportunity to try. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again, but I would certainly drink it again. It was one of my favorites of the night. It had a nice raspberry flavor with a decent tartness that could have maybe been toned up a little bit. I would definitely recommend this beer if you like raspberries."
""
"Solid beer although falls a bit shy of hype for me. Still worth a shot if you can get it, but not worth trading any rarities for."
""
""
"A really nice wild that has a lot of sour & fruit going on, which is exactly what I was looking for. A good one from Tomme and company at Lost Abbey. Recommend."
""
"D - overall, very solid framboise. Ties in some nice citric tones and the mustiness adds a layer of complexity. Damn good framboise...wish I could try this next to FfaC."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice wild ale, very balanced in terms of flavor and sour/tartness."
""
"Pours a clear dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty sour and tart with lots of fresh raspberry and raspberry juice aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic quality with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is pretty refreshing and very easy to drink."
""
"O: Tasty and well constructed."
""
"O- An excellent beer, the raspberry flavor really shines and the tartness and malt flavor does a great job of highlighting it and balancing it out."
"Overall - Well-made sour, but lacking in complexity. The fruit doesn't do enough to overcome the simplicity of the yeast strain."
""
""
"O- really enjoyed this beer. Not real sour or tart but it definitely has the characteristics of a sour with a nice raspberry flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A nice sour with lots of barrel goodness."
"O: Smooth and bitter, leathery and almost buttery."
""
""
""
""
"Denise thinks the body is too thick, but I enjoy it. A decent sour overall, but not worth bending over backwards to find it."
""
"O - I was expecting a bit more fruity raspberry, considering the freshness of the bottle, but i am very happy with the funkiness and intensity of the tartness."
""
"Extremely nice raspberry Wild Ale. Aside from too much carbonation, the flavor profile was spot on. I really liked the acidic and lactic tartness in this beer, perhaps I'd prefer it a bit less dry. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm pleasantly surprised with this beer! Mouth puckering tartness, with the added bonus of raspberry funk! Great mouthfeel, and enough complexity for me to keep drinking it. This definitely holds up as one of the better American Wilds out there, and seems to age well (for the year I've had it sitting). I'll definitely be seeking this in the future!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I really like it. Extremely drinkable. I can drink this like the British can drink pints of Bitters. I love how the fruit flavors play with the caramel malt flavors. I can't say for sure whether it's better or worse than the Red Poppy, but it shares many of its characteristics. 4.5"
"O: A great American framboise."
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Would like less carbonation in this one (can't believe I am complaining about too much carbonation in a Lost Abbey beer)."
"O: understand the demand. Very nice and I'd love to try again. With some goggles on. Quite good."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid wild ale. It is very drinkable and I can't wait to see what some age does to this beer as I have some 09, 10, and 11 ageing. I think it is going to be amazing!"
""
"O- This is really what a fruit wild ale is all about. Over the top fruit and sour yet not overdone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I love this beer. So freaking good with delicious raspberries. So glad I got to try this on tap."
""
"Overall, this was a very nice tasting beer and quite packed with real raspberry flavor and a boat ton of tartness. I was not expecting it to be this sour but I am quite pleased with the outcome. You definitely need to be a fan of sour beers and raspberries to enjoy this; sour more so than raspberry. Definitely recommended but not totally sure it is worth the outlay to aquire given the rarity and/or price."
""
""
""
"O- Impressive, love the sour puckering notes, was not disappointed, love the fruitiness, raspberries, nice oak, nice complexity, really enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

"Bottle shared at one of the many Santa Cruz tastings; review from notes. Pours a dark orangey red with a small khaki head. Aroma is tart and fruity with a massive emphasis on fresh raspberries and lesser accents of green apple skin. Sour raspberry flavor washes over the palate before leaving some sweeter candied berry notes. Touches of wood and a helping of funk with lactic tartness. High carbonation, maybe a little coarse and fizzy. A very good sour."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Solid appearance with some nice continuing carbonation and a foamy head. Nose is full on fermented raspberry. Flavor is a vinegary, malty, acidic raspberry. Very full flavored, and nicely balanced. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Pours a very thin super carbonated light reddish brown that if not for the huge frothy head this brew would look more like wine cooler than a beer. Tart smells of raspberries dominate the nose with a hint of grapes and cherries adding to a unique aroma. First sip is almost puckering tart with plenty of sweetness left to make even the most controlled diabetics reaching for their insulin. The raspberries make up the majority of the flavor. Not much of anything else there. Body is super thin but the over carbonation compensates to the point that mouthfeel is quite pleasant. I do believe more time will help this puppy. Time will tell."
"O - Great beer. Maybe Lost Abbey should give up on everything else for now and just focus on their Wilds."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, FDA is comparable to drinking a super tasty Framboise tinged with the cheesy funk of a typical Jolly Pumpkin, though the oak characteristics complement the overall flavor perfectly. Also complements well with the brie I’m pairing it with. This is a repeat-funk cheddar-offender and I’ll be returning as much as humanly possible."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a light reddish color ale with a light link foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh raspberry with tart notes is quite sublime. Taste is a very interesting mix between some fresh raspberry juice with notes and no sweetener with some light oak notes. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with great level of complexity while retaining a good level of drinkability."

"Overall: This bottle tastes much more vinegary that previous bottles I've had. The raspberry has faded significantly over the past two years. I don't recommend holding onto this for more than one year."
"overall - certainly something to keep around the kitchen for pairing. also certainly something non beer lovers could enjoy, or even a beer lover. terrific beer."
"Nice strong carbonation. Overall an excellent beer, one I believe I had the opportunity to buy once or twice but simply assumed it wasn't going to be worthwhile. This one isn't talked about like many of the other LA beers, but this is a prime example of why the brewery is at least capable of producing world class beer."
"O-Damm good beer. Fresh this was sweet and delicious, aged it's tart and delicious. Nice job Lost Abbey."
"Light brown pour into a tulip with a quickly dissipating beige head. Lacing holds. Aroma is the most wonderful sweet tart raspberry smell I have encountered in a beer. Exceptional. Taste offers only a hint of sweetness on the aftertaste. Other than that, it is a sour bomb all the way. First sips are highly carbonated and overly prickly on the tongue, but this subsides. Much more character of the fruit than other wilds, making this more of a sour fruit beer in my opinion. It is really quite good. I wish I had another bottle."
"Overall: This is a good sour fruit beer. A lot smoother than Riserva. I would definitely have another."
"Overall: A mellow and delicately-crafted lambic. While it may lack complexity, it provides plenty of raspberry with just the right amount of sourness. Happy I got to try this one!"
"Overall- a very good sour. Not a big fan of sour but this one works"
"SkÅL!"
"FdA is a ruddy reddish, amber with just a collar of pinkish white foam. The beer smeels very fruity like raspberry preserves with just a little damp hay funk. The beer has crisp acidity, bright fruit, and a nice funky finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and luscious. An excellent beer, that I could absolutely pound."
"2010 Bottle - Lucky to score this from an awesome trader!! - Pours cloudy and murky ruddy red with a large beige head that appears pink in some light...aroma is gorgeous, massively lacticity that I now come to expect, tart wood, phenolic, fresh raspberry and acid...flavour does not disappoint, lemon acidity, raw oak, tons of sun ripened fruit...tannic and puckery on the finish, and yields to more fruitiness...this was so damn good..."
"An expensive gamble, but one that very fortunately paid off for me. A delicious AWA, one that I'm very pleased to have sampled - cheers Tomme."
"O - Very good beer, and it seems like its under control. Carbonation was fine (no gushing!), and there was no infection. Glad this beer is back to a drinkable form."
"overall: quite good"
"Overall – Extremely impressed with this beer. So much in fact I will be seeking another one out. One of my favorite fruits is raspberry and this beer delivers in that category. Just a damn good beer. Thanks again to Chris for the beer!"
"D- huge acidity makes the drinkability lower than average however the flavor and aroma more than make up for it. Overall an amazing wild ale that everyone should try if they can get their hands on it!"
"The mouthfeel was good and the carb was fine. Overall, this is a very nice beer. The best LA beer I've ever had and maybe the best Raspberry beer I've ever had. A winner."
"O: a decent brew but not my favorite frambois. Could have been a touch sweeter and would have been good to great."
"Wonderful raspberry sour."
"Bottle foams over upon opening. Pours chunky and thick. Highly carbonated. Foamy as all hell. The chunkiness is off-putting. Smells raspberry heavy. Tons of fruit on the nose. Tart on the nose and tongue. Acidic but not too strong. Vry sour and raspberry heavy. Geat tasty beer!"
"Thanks Russ for the trade!"
"Narrative: The train of her ostentatious gown dragged upon the split staircase with wanton disregard for anyone walking near her. After all, there were plenty of tailors within her Parlor and weekly soirees that would readily repair any damage. Somehow Countess Brioche sought more than just the exploitation of the endearing faces of the working classes. She sought their unending love. Notwithstanding, her acerbic parents brought her up to speak her mind truthfully and freely at all times, no matter how scathing. “Oh-oh-oh!” The Duchess of Piedmont fell down two stairs to her knees upon the rich velvet of Countess Briochess’s train. “Your steps lack precision due to the mass pressed upon them.” Mme. Brioche commented and felt a slight pang at her ejaculation. It wasn’t fair to cut others so deeply with such a bitter acerbic purity. Somehow, in this acidic repartee, others saw themselves, and their own shortcomings, despite the caustic burns they received. Countess Brioche looked upon a bustling courtyard of servants who despised her, but respected her stinging candor."
"It's no Raspberry Tart, but that shouldn't be the standard. Tasty stuff. How this costs twice as much in the bottle at a store versus on-tap at a bar will remain one of life's greatest mysteries."
"This is my first review BTW. Feedback is appreciated!"
"Shared this with Emmasdad on Thursday night. A bit worried about whether this would be carbonated or not; had a distinct pop when the cork was removed. Poured a dark red with a small white head the quickly dissipated. Aroma of raspberries and malt. Taste was wonderful: very tart raspberries, malt, and a slight vinegar taste with no hop bitterness at all. Excellent brew; wish I had more."
"Thanks to schmittymack for sharing a bottle of this one with me last night. Opened with an audible pop, which we took as a good sign. Poured a brilliant red color with a light white head. Very tart aromas of fresh raspberries and slight vinegar. On the palate, this one is light bodied, sour and extremely tart. Very fresh raspberry flavors and some red wine vinegar."
"FdA arrives with little to no head. A ring of fizz is present around the outside of the glass and a steady stream of bubbles rises in the center. The color is red hued mahogany, like a finished piece of fine hardwood. The aroma is of sour red fruit. Not surprisingly, raspberries predominate. The beer smells tart and fruity. Taste follows wih huge raspberry notes. The initial fruity sweetness is followed by a blast of acetic sourness. Vinegar and light funk present themselves as my mouth puckers wonderfully. The finish is dry with a lingering tartness. Raspberries abound in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to medium and very refreshingly carbonated. Overall this is a wonderful beer! The over the top raspberries coupled with mouth puckering sour qualities make this a joy to imbibe! I can never get enough of this one. Well done Lost Abbey!"
"This is a medium to full bodied brew, leaning more towards medium and quite creamy and smooth in texture. The light amount of carbonation exaggerates the thick fullness of this brew. Much more fruited and sour than I was expecting but that is welcomed. Very well hidden abv except for it's warming factor."
"Rating: 93 out of 100"
"One of the best raspberry sours I've had. Lots of fruit, funk and definitely last awhile being so darn funky and flavorful. Everyone into sours (especially fruity sours) should seek this one out. This was my only bottle (thanks hurfer) but I will more than likely be trading for more!"
"Medium bodied, a bit lighter on the carbonation (but better than Duck Duck Guava was), lingering and biting on the tongue. I really was into this one, more so than some other LA beers I've had, and this was the only beer that had me going back for more that day."
"Overall delicious as expected, nice tart raspberry flavors, great fruit, light funk, but just missing the carbonation."
"O- this was a treat for beer week and Im going to seek it out again before the week is over. Thank you Tom and tomme for making this happen. Very amazing beer here and I want the double version."
"O- this is a spectacular beer. Holds its own against some of the best from Belgium, and the best american copy I've ever had. Just blown away. Love it."
"O - This is a very good sour the taste is wonderful which makes this one easy to drink if you like sours this one to try and hunt down"
"O - A very very nice beer, one of the best I've had from Lost Abbey. I enoyed it about as much as DDG, head-to-head. When MasterSki shared a bottle of this with me in July of last year, it was not drinking quite as good, certainly."
"Framboise De Amorosa is a terrific beer. My only gripe was that carbonation issues really got in the way of its appearance (as well as how much of the beer I actually had a chance to enjoy). Tomme, when are these problems going to be solved?"
"O- Amazing beer, loved it last year and im loving it more this time around."
"Thanks to hurfer for the assist. "
"Poured on tap into smaller wine glass. Pours grapefruit red, no head. sour cherry, wheat, raspberry and maybe a little watermelon on the nose. very delectable. taste is quite tart, reminds me of the black raspberry sour warhead candy. mouth feel is awesome. the initial carb goes excellent with the tartness, it almost excels the experience. overall, i am comfortable saying this is a great beer. very refreshing and an awesome cap to the session."
"Very very tasty beer. Definitely recommended."
"O: a decent offering from Lost abbey, glad to have tried it"
"Drink- I would like to have this again with a nice cheesecake or paired with something to really highlight those flavors. Very tart, sour, sweet, lush. Loved it."
"Not recommended for novices. Highly recommended for those off the beaten path."
"Overall- I loved the aroma of Framboise, but it lacked in taste for me. I do think that it will benefit from aging in the bottle, and will mellow out to become a great beer. I love sours, they are my favorite style, but this one was too sour with not enough balance for me."
"The beer pours out a dark pink color with a tan head that has great retention, but isnt very fine...sparse bubbles. The color is very murky. The aroma is incredibly balanced between the high acidic sourness and the raspberry. Great sour smell! The raspberry is very noticeable an compliments the beer's flavors very well. There is no acetobacter and the sourness is absolutely spot-on. What a beer. One of my favorite styles when done the right way (this being a killer American fruited sour). I'd love to try the base beer also. In the mouth it has a medium body which is lightened by the high carbonation, which combined with refreshing sourness, acidity, and tartness from fruit makes this super drinkable. I wish it would last longer."
"Went to the release and had this on draft...also just popped one of my 4 bottles open the other night with my girlfriend and buddy. I will be reviewing the one I had on draft. Drove all the way from Fresno for this! Pours a very murky brownish-red color with very little head. Scent is STRONG raspberry with hints of funk, oak, and sour aromas. Taste is initially sweet, fresh raspberry goodness. Finishes very sour and acidic. There are some lovely wooden notes throughout. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and thick. It reminds me of some very acidic, unfiltered fruit juice. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer was just fantastic at the release. I'm interested to see how the remaining bottles hold up over time."
"This is the second truly spectacular beer I've had from Lost Abbey."
"O= I had a sample on tap at the release party that I remember being a little sweeter. I think I like this pour better, but probably because it is not 10:30 in the morning right now. $15 might be a little steep, but I guess it is worth it due to the quality and rareness."
"Framboise de Amorosa (Raspberry Lover) is a lovely little raspberry wild ale that does just about everything right. Even though it was overpriced at $15 for just 12.7 ounces, it was probably pretty expensive to produce. Thank you to whoever sent me the bottle."
"O: I'm not entirely sure that it was worth the trip down to San Diego, but it was definitely worth a taste. I'd drink/buy it again, but I'd probably split the bottle."
"It's a tasty sour tart beer. I had 3 pints of it on tap at the release and I could drink this all day. Well done."
"I really liked this one. The raspberry flavor is strong, and it's nice and sour in the finish. Right up my alley."
"Light and crisp body here. Good lively carbonation. I heard this was a gusher but not my bottle. So lucky me. Drinks like a champ. I love this beer and I'm kind of pissed that I shared with Andy."
"This is drinking very well right now. But the vinegar presence wories me a bit. May not be the best candidate for the cellar."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a murky dark brown with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, maple syrup, oak, and slight mothballs (oxidation?). The flavor was of sweet malt, maple syrup, raspberries, oak, and oxidation (sigh...). It had a medium feel on the palate with very low carbonation (almost flat). Overall I believe this brew was treated badly in its past. There was no visible leaking from the cork to hint that oxidation should be present. So I was quite surprised when I found it to be. So I will say, there wasn't anything awe-inspiring in this one to say the least. Hate that this one was oxidized. Still had a decent flavor I could tell from the background notes in this one, but the oxidation was just overpowering. Aroma was okay on this one. Would love to try one that had been treated nicely in its past."
"Shared by Chris and reviewed from notes. Poured into a lost abbey tumbler, murky red liquid with a dirty off white head, decent retention. Smell is strong sour raspberries, lemon and lime soda, sugary with a slight bit of maltiness. Taste is pretty intense - big sour raspberry flavor up front, sour lemons, a bit of that trademark Lost Abbey funk, some blueberries, slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium carbonation, very acidic, makes it feel like it is coating. Not a bad beer, but the over the top sourness without any kind of balancing could definitley be improved with a bit of oak or more wild yeast flavors and aromas."
"D: Goes down tart and easy. Really great drinking, not overpowering."
"D - This was nice, light and refreshing, I could have drank this in the warm San Diego/Carlsbad sun for a bit - it was a great break between tons of heavy barrel aged stouts and water. Very agreeable and would easily be something to have a sour hater try and be swayed."
"D:very very tasty brew that can hang with the best of them and was drinking so good. I'm definitely glad I have another bottle stashed away."
"I was honestly ready to be disappointed by this beer for some reason, but it came up big for me."
"D- Housed the whole bottle by myself, so its quite drinkable. Even after drinking the whole bottle, I still felt like I could drink more sour beer(which is rare for me)"
"Reviewed on 05/01/2010. 375 ml bottle (no gushing). Pours a cloudy reddish brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of raspberry, sour malt, light funk. Flavor of tart raspberries with a sour malt, bready finish. Sour and acidic mouthfeel. Pretty tasty overall."
"Very enjoyable if it hadn't been for the loss of so much of this beer on my porch. And, it would be even better if it wasn't so hard to get."
"Been saving this one for a little bit. Pours a deep, deep red that is just translucent. Lovely bottle conditioned dense one finger head. Not much lacing to speak of, but there are some sticky spots. Aroma is a blast of sharp, tart raspberry, damp hay and straw, light brett funk, and a slight bit of wood. The flavor is dominated by sour fruit, and oaky tannins. The sour is a deep sour, not so much tart. Earthy, musty, woody undertones; not too funky though seems the light brett aroma is left in the hose and doesn't carry to the flavor. Just a tad of pie-crust. Great cleansing dry finish that leaves a pucker of raspberry on the tongue. Feels a little fuller then a standard framboise. A great beer for sure."
"I enjoyed this. No shortage of raspberry flavor was present and I was pleased to find that this avoided coming off as overly souring or acidic although it did have quite a nice bite and some well down subdued funkiness to it. I had no problem getting through the glass. This is a good one from the Lost Abbey."
"d - I thought this was a pretty good wild ale, and that it smelled fantastic. Lots of sour raspberries and dark fruit, and pretty easy to drink. Would definitely try again."
"D: If you don't like raspberries, you're going to hate this brew. I had a 2-3oz. serving and that was plenty, but I savored every last drop!"
"A very dramatic beer, aromatically alluring with a forceful, luscious taste and enveloping mouthfeel. Sexy, but not beautiful."
"M/D very drinkable and smooth, light in the mouth"
"Overall, a very decent framboise. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, though it is quite heavy on the acidity."
"Drinkability: After having lived through a number of clunky (though tasty) beers from this brewery, it is nice to see Tomme get the carbonation level right on this one (at least on my bottle, as others have suffered through gushers); this is among the very best beers that Lost Abbey has produced"
"D: Awesome wild that is a treat to have, and I hope to find this again. Only reason it doesn't get a 5 for me for drinkability is that I'd be hard to put a whole lot of this down in a sitting, but really great in small doses. Highly recommended."
"Provided you open it VERY cold, open gently, and allow the sediment to settle, this is an incredibly rewarding beer."
"(D)- I am glad to have finally tried this one. Fitting the style well, yet more like a combo of a fruit lambic and a flanders in my opinion. Ridiculously sour and acidic, yet I like it. I enjoyed this one in a style quickly going up the ranks as my favorite style."
"This is likely the best framboise made outside of the Sienne Valley of Belgium. Where the beer remains largely normal throughout, the intangible almondy flavor and feel separates the men from the boys."
"D: I enjoyed this beer and wish I had a 750 instead. Would seek out but wouldn't trade my cellar for it."
"Bottle, enormous gusher. Lost about half the bottle. Nose is wrought with that really distinctive Lost Abbey wild yeast. Round, soft, mildly dry, and raspberry seeds. Dark crimson to maroon, thick and opaque. I thought it was initially almost pie-like on the first sip. Tons of raspberry flavors swirling about, ranging from a dry lambic to seeds in raspberry jam. Chewy. Not overly sour or dry as a whole, which is a nice change of pace from some of the harder framboise. A nice expression but rather singular and not particularly complex."
"Overall this was one of the most tart beers I've had in quite a while. Not quite smooth enough to be great but a solid beer for which you need to prepare your tastebuds. Well worth a shot."
"Bottle. Courtesy of a fellow BA that wanted to share the bottle with some friends. Pours a really nice reddish mahagony with a great fluffy head that dissapates rather quickly. Sour and tart! Sweet raspberry flavor. Slight funk. Bites the tongue with its tartness. A really special treat. A great beer and one that I would totally seek out!"
"M + D: Tartness, with a touch of sting/burn on the way down. A little tamer and it would (could) be perfect?"
"Taste is bracingly sour. Strong raspberry flavor with that seed taste, similar to cherry pit. Just sour, lactic, eggy, and a little too much vinegar. Acetobacter seems to be too strong in this beer. This would be awesome if it was somewhat under control and some brett funk was noticeable."
"D: Up there but to be fair I could have stayed all day."
"This is a good beer at best IMHO. I could sit and smell it for hours but I had a hard time getting thru the bottle in terms of the taste. I don't seem to have that problem with sours from that other California brewery..."
"J"
"Drinks: like domination. The flavors of Amorosa are utterly enjoyable, but the sourness is overbearing to the point that it's difficult to drink. I couldn't finish more than one glass."
"While this beer was enough to satisfy seasoned sour beer drinkers, I would definitely be comfortable using it as an introductory beer for initiates to the sour beer scene. Very well done."
"This beer is ruby-hued with a medium-sized head and a little lacing left stuck on the glass. Tart raspberries and wild yeast make up the aromas. The taste pretty much follows suit. This beer is delicious. It's nice and dry, with an excellent balance of fruit and tart. There is a slight alcoholic note in the finish. I would definitely drink this beer anytime. I really enjoyed it."
"This was a gusher. Upon open, much of the beer was lost over the side. This was sad. The beer that was left helped cheer me up though. Pours a deep red with pink head. Tons of raspberry in the smell. Had a sour raspberry flavour. Very tart and delicious. Tons of carbonation, as evidenced by the gushing."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is Low. Overall, this was a really bad beer experience. I hope to get to try another bottle sometime in the future to see if this one was an exception, but nonetheless, I have to reveiw this beer, and this beer was not good. Skal."
"Oh well. I didn't pay a dime for it, and despite my disappointment, I still am very grateful for having been able to give it a try and see what all the hype's about. Needless to say though, I wont be seeking out another."
"Watch out for the gusher. Make sure you have a big glass ready to go."
"Seek it out, if you have the means."
"Flavor is also excelent! After a night of Barrel Aged beers from Lost Abbey, this really hit the spot! Flavor is a lot more tart then expected...which is awesome! Fruits-raspberries are definitely forward, but mix wonderfully with the wild yeast. Seems like there's sugars added to provide a sweet backdrop to this beer...where as traditional Lambics may be even more tart and less sweet. Either way, its still delicious...and way drinkable! Light to medium mouthfeel with high carbonation. Booze isn't noticeable at all. Another great beer from a great brewery!"
"As of right now though, this beer is a huge let down."
"What a monumental disappointment; in the end the aroma, appearance, texture, and flavor were all majorly negatively impacted by the horrible bottle conditioning. I am definitely peeved that I lost 80% of this $15 dollar beer. I think I would have actually enjoyed this if it had been properly bottle-conditioned. How this ended up this way I don't even want to know, but I really, really hope I get to try a decent sample of this some day."
"Refreshing and delicious. A true winner."
"This is a fantastic beer from Lost Abbey though they seemingly still have some sort of carbonation issue as I've never lost this much beer in a gusher. However, unlike with the flatter beers from last year, the carbonation doesn't really take away from the quality of this beer."
"Another fantastic bottle shared by the generous jedwards. Pours a muted raspberry with a loose, quarter inch head that dissipates into a fairly consistent thin skim with one large dollop of foam that coalesced in the center. Clarity was a little hazy/murky. Nose is big, sweet raspberries and a suggestion of artificial sweetener. Taste is really salty at the start, followed by raspberries and some tartness; however, the tartness, is masked by the saltiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium and the saltiness really stimulates the salivary glands. Carbonation is very lively and falls just short of being prickly. This is a really interesting and multifaceted beer. I can't believe how salty it was. I'm curious to see how this one ages."
"D- I'm really glad I have another one to crack (I may have to hide it from the wifey though she said it was one of her favorites to date). I would suggest that you seek it out if u haven't tried it yet. I also have heard that they have a tendency to gush. I served mine extremely cold and didn't have an issue."
"Drinkability: I had this one at a 4.0 by virtue of its low abv%, but I think the high level of acidity hurts this one slightly. It's just a little intense, and though the nose starts off as inviting and interesting, it ultimately gets a little harsh, too acidic, and a little too one-dimensional in the flavor profile. Worth trying."
"This beer was sampled out of a reidel stemless red wine glass. overall very tasty and will look forward to this beer each year. Looking forward to getting a chance to try the double raspberry version."
"This was incredibly drinkable and undoubtedly the best raspberry beer I've ever had."
"Thanks JMBSH. Pours purple, after the great gush. Raspberry and sugar aroma. Lacey. Medium mouthfeel. Sour,balamatic vinegar,good raspberries, very good not unbelievable. appropriate though still above average carbonation that caused the gushing, and a very good drinker."
"Overall, another great sour from Tomme Arthur."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is high. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice sour beer. It was sourer then I expected, which I considered a good thing. The raspberries also added a nice flavor that aided in the drinkability factor. Enjoyed drinking this one a lot."
"Beer is thin and smooth. It finishes dry and has a strong tartness in the corners of my mouth. Strongly lactic in the mouth, some acetic character, a very drinkable and wonderful sour overall."
"D: Quite tasty, though not nearly as complex as some really outstanding wild ales. Way overpriced."
"Very happy with this beer from Lost Abbey, while overall not being a huge Lost Abbey fan. This one was spot on in all categories (good have looked a bit better though)..."
"D: A solid beer but probably not the same as when I experienced this one at EBF. Much better as it warms, this one takes on a whole new flavor profile and character, as well as body. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Tartness is superb but not palate destroying, the fruit character is very refreshing, and...damn, it's just an enjoyable beer."
"D: Good tasty beer I am glad I have more."
"this is amazing, i love it. the raspberry flavor is heavy but never too much."
"Great beer but I'm really pissed about the mess and loss of beer. It's bad enough I have to stay away from Lost Abbey big BA beers, now I have to fear the wild ales too for the opposite reason?"
"D- This is a really good raspberry wild overall. More sour in the back and more sweet upfront. Another great, well put together brew by the Lost Abbey"
"D - fairly good dont really pick up on any alcohol but its so tart i dont know if i could drink more than 1 or 2"
"D-this has a huge sourness and tons of raspberry flavors. the balance between the sweetness and the sourness is quite nice, both are huge."
"375 ml caged and corked bottle with a very suggestive label. The beer pours a hazy red-brown-orange color with a white head. The aroma is very strong raspberries. The flavor is strong raspberry with low to medium tartness. Very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Intensely tart, mouth-puckering mouthfeel with lots of earthy and acidic funk balanced out by a sweet dark raspberry fruit flavor. As in the aroma, there is a very strong funky sour tartness with a slight lactic presence and decent amount of earthy oak from the barrel aging. This beer is still young so the raspberries are prominent adding a sweet yet still tart balance and another level of complexity. Soft carbonation throughout as well as a slight syrupy texture adds some thickness/fullness to the body but the bone dry, intensely puckering finish leaves me salivating for another sip. Only slightly acidic and extremely quaffable. Again, this beer is young so the fruit is still prominent but with some age this is going to develop into a monster. Very similar to a Belgian lambic in aroma and flavor. Complex and delicious and one of Lost Abbey's best beers to date. Highly recommended!"
"Approach this with caution!"
"D: I never wanted it to end. Simple as that. Thank you, Lost Abbey."
"D - An excellent, easy-drinking wild ale. Highly enjoyable, and quite restrained in the ABV and palate-destruction departments. I easily enjoyed a 375ml bottle on my own and I could have had another. This one lives up to the hype."
"D - Great. Easy to drink and very crisp. I wish I had 2 bottles, because this brew would probably age well."
"Drinkability is a little down, its very sour."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for something that is this exceptionally sour. The sourness fades quickly enough that it does not keep you from drinking it all."
"D: This was great, I can only hope to get my hands on some more bottles someday. Possibly the best Lost Abbey beer I've ever had."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"Hell of a beer overall. Another good sour from a brewery that can at least be counted on to get those right."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid wild ale. LA really seems to nail this style. It is very drinkable and I can't wait to see what some age does to this beer. I think it is going to get very mouth puckering tart."
"Great drinkability as well, this beer goes down very delightfully."
"D - This is a very enjoyable wild ale. Lots of tart, sour and fruity flavors. I couldn't bring myself to do it, but this would make an awesome sorbet for those that have extra bottles to play around with. The 375ml bottle isn't enough...a full 750ml bottle would be just about right. The 7.0% alcohol is not at all noticeable. Excellent sour. Glad to have tried this one."
"Mouthfeel is a little more substantial that I may have expected. Low-medium level of carbonation is on point. Great beer, very pleasant and successful in what it was trying to be. There's not a whole lot else going on besides the punching raspberry flavor, and it is kind of one dimensional in that sense, but I enjoyed it for what it is. I'll be drinking the rest of my bottles within the next 6 months or sooner, I can't see this getting any better. Thanks for the chance!"
"D= This is the reason I joined the Sinners Club this year and It lived up to everything I wanted it to. The ASGC was amazing and this is just sort of the ""cherry"" to top it off. I'm happy I bought my max allotment and would buy even more given the oppertunity."
"Drinkability- Pretty damned tasty brew that I thoroughly enjoyed. It has a fairly nice balance between the sour, raspberries and wood but I really love the big vanilla aspect that mixes with the fruit. Now to just get them to put it in 750's. Thanks much Corey!"
"D- High. I love this beer. Kind of pissed at the start from the explosion, but by the end I have a smile on my face. This beer is fantastic."
"D- Easy to drink and enjoy, awesome nose and a good taste to this beer make it quite enjoyable."
"Eventually, I decided to agitate the beer aggressively to help dispel some of the carbonation. I noticed an improvement in the flavor profile, however I still felt that the mustiness overwhelmed the sourness and fruit a bit too much."
"This one needs some work - a bit too sweet, and the heavy carbonation is an obvious over-reaction to the many flat lost abbey bottles of 2009. That said, and although there is a long road ahead, this is a great step forward for American breweries in terms of lambic/framboise style beers. ""American Wild Ale"" may no longer be enough!"
"D- I'll have no problem finishing this bottle on my own tonight!"
"This may be the best I have had from Lost Abbey in terms of fruite beers ever. Maybe it was just me but I have never had something that worked for me so well with this rich flavor. Cannot say enough good things here."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with punchy carbonation. Good body and overall quite the tasty brew. Of all the new Lost Abbey beers I've had this ranks up there with the best of them. Worth seeking this one out, especially if you're a fan of framboise. No gusher on this bottle, although the cork was a bit of a pain to get out."
"D: After the first sip my initial thought was ""I wish this was a 750ml."" I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall a tasty beer. Glad I have some more"
"If you're a fan of wild ales, you will be very impressed with the Framboise. Reminds me of the Consecration but aged with raspberries added instead of currants. Pinkish brown pour, raspberries, yeast funk and brown malt in the nose and raspberries, brett, oak and sour cherry in the taste. Mouthfeel is really close to as good as it gets for the style, but having plenty of Tomme's other Sours I can say it could be a touch smoother. You will want another one, the lingering dryness combined with the tart, sour character of the beer will have you thirsting for seconds."
"The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, with a slightly syrupy heftiness to the finish. I'll say this is highly drinkable, because I wanted more at the end of the glass, and I would love to have this again really soon. I can't imagine this would age well- all of its flavor is from the fruit, which would likley fade with time and lead to the plain tasting base beer."
"Drinkability? This would be a very difficult brew for me to cellar as it is SO ready to drink right now and that being said, the liquid in my glass is flying the hell out. Outstanding. World class. 'nuff said."
"an absolutely amazing beer. I think I will have to a trip up to the brewery to get some more bottles!!!"
"A seven ounce pour of this is a 5 on drinkability, but the acidity makes a full bottle somewhat laborious. It's a chest burner. Still, the aroma and flavor are undeniably excellent. This is one hell of a framboise."
"D: I'm usually not the hugest fan of the framboise variety of lambic/sour beers, but this was a really pleasant and refreshing take on it."
"**had another bottle tonight. If anything, I underrated this on my first review ... maybe due to old ill feelings. Really a splendid beer."
"All in all a fine entry, and one I'm glad I was able to try both from the tap at the brewery and in the six bottles I was able to pick up at the release event."
"D: I would drink this anytime I see it"
"Draft, City Beer Store. This beer is a darkish pink with no head and looks thick, like a cross between Pepto and the dregs of a fruit beer. The aroma is pretty great. There's huge Raspberry note backed by a clean lactic sourness. It's fresh and natural smelling, no artificial fruit here. It reminds me of making raspberry jam. The flavor is almost harshly tart and lactic sour, which I enjoy but probably isn't for everyone. The mouthfeel seems thick but I could be imagining that. The beer is fairly palette wrecking, pleasingly so at first but it wore on me. The lactic tart raspberry was strong enough to make me almost lose the flavor by the end of my small glass. Very interesting and rather delicious beer, particularly in small doses."
"Murky reddish-purple in the glass with a small white head that settles to little more than a film. Huge tart raspberry aroma backed by very clean lactic sourness. I could accuse this of being one-dimensional, but the fruit character is amazing. Tart raspberries are equally dominant on the palate, with the perfect level of lactic sourness backing it. Finishes with a trace of woody astringency, but very clean on the whole. Simple, straight-forward and beautifully crafted, this is what Lindemans Framboise would taste like if it were dry and sour (and good)."
