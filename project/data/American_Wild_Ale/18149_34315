4.16,-1.4,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"EBF sample. Pours a turbid, light brown color. Aroma is both sweet and tart. Reminds me of a Flanders Oud Bruin. Cherries are tart and also sweet smelling. There is also a good dose of funk and other fruits. A bit oaky. The flavor is sweet with some dark fruits and caramel and cola. Also there is a good dose of tart cherry. Quite complex. Finishes with some oak. Has some heftiness to the body but I'm shocked that it's 11%. I've wanted to try this for a while and I found it to be a rather interesting 2 ounces.","VelvetExtract","Mar 22, 2015"

4.99,18.2,4.75,5,5,5,5,"An excellent Flanders brown. Poured a dark brown (SRM 37) out of the tap. Minimal head. Medium tart, but balanced with the sweetness of the roasted malt, it is not too acetic and puckery. ABV listed at 11 percent, but there is absolutely no alcohol burn. Huge beer that manages to hide its alcohol in tartness and malt and notes of sour cherry and vanilla. Great take on the Flanders brown.","Natureboy","Jan 02, 2015"

4.2,-0.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"On tap at the Aptos St. BBQ.  Been quite a while since I had the opportunity to try this well crafted beer.  The wine barrel aging really dominates the flavor profile (at least that's what I detect, though the recipe doesn't list any wine barrel aging), giving the beer a lightly sour, wine infused finish.  You still pick up some light chocolate and malty sweetness from the underlying base beer, and the overall combination of flavors is quite.  Aptos St. was doing small, 5 ounce pours of this beer, which I found was just right for me (would have had difficulty sipping a pint or even a 12 ounce tulip of this beer).  Overall, another solid effort from the folks at Lost Abbey.","John_M","Dec 23, 2014"

4.66,10.4,4,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5," The flavor is lovely with a mld vanilla mixed with sour cherry and bourbon juxtoposition just tantalizing along with gentle tangy yeast with the sour elements blending well with the mild alcohol and wood from the bourbon with cherry skin tannin in the finish and warmth of the bourbon continuing in the back with slight dark sugar accent. The tangy sour is in harmony with the carmelized malt flavor with light sour flavor of fruit and mellow fruity sweetness combining to finish tart with a drying alcohol taste and barrel tannin in the end. Overall this is a true joy to savor -for a strong 11% ale to have a quad base and the cherry and sour elements all working in unision is a testament with exceptional drinkability with the bourbon enhancing the overall enjoyment-great mix of fruit and barrel aging in this.","Slatetank","Aug 11, 2014"

Carbonation is medium, which I like to go with this dry beer..This is a great 11% barrel aged beer.

Maybe aging the bottle would help build some carbonation, but after reading reviews of aged bottles it appears this will not help carbonation build. I really think some carbonation would help this beer a lot. Again no noticeable bourbon barrel flavor is kind of a let down, not a bad beer but not something I would want to try again especially for the price. Can definitely find something comparable to this from a real Belgian brewery for 1/3rd the cost of this beer. Bottle says brewed with old world and new world processes which to me means they probably took shortcuts to make it using new technology which could be why this beer just is not that good. $18 for 12floz","buzzardman","Feb 28, 2014"

The beer is murky brown looking with plenty of sediment floating around. The smell of the beer is funky with a boozy sweetness mixed with the cherry aromas. The taste are a sour tart cherry flavor upfront with a very subtle vanilla oak flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel I the beer is smooth, kind of flat which is a shame.

Good funk in the aroma. Finishes dry and sour. It’s fairly complex, but the barrel notes kinda get lost. It’s a dark brownish red beer with no head, really. Very wine-ish.

It's definitely got a slightly medicinal aftertaste, but there's so much going on it's not distracting. It's a super drinkable sour with notes of deep pit fruits and screams cherries. Worth trying for sure.","ThePorterSorter","May 05, 2012"

It looks like another flat bottle from Lost Abbey. The nose falls a bit flat as well, but what is there has plenty of cherries and bourbon, along with some vinegar-like sourness an a hint of earthy brett funk. There's also just a little bit of soy sauce. The front half of each sip has some sour cherries and bourbon, but then the beer fades to a strong, unpleasant soy sauce flavor, along with a bit of oxidation. The body doesn't feel too full, especially considering this is an 11% brew. The complete lack of carbonation kills the beer though, as not only does it make the beer feel dull, but it allows the unpleasant close of the flavor profile to sit and linger on my palate. This bottle of Cuvee de Tomme is a major let down. I've had plenty of draft pours of it before at festivals and absolutely loved this beer, but tonight it's an absolute drain pour for me.

The aroma is vanilla, bourbon, hints of brown sugar, some light funkiness, a little leather, cherry, and hints of raisin. The initial taste is quite tart with some lactic acid and a bit sweet with some brown sugar. There is also bourbon and vanilla, and some cherries. The finish is tart with some acetic acid and some lingering bourbon. Full body. Medium-low carbonation. The alcohol isn't detectable, but you can tell it is a fairly big beer.

Nice. The flavor is full of character: slightly sour cherry, figs, raisins, cocoa. Dark roast. Complex and yet well-crafted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation.

The aromas consist of sour cherries, lactic sourness, light vanilla, and musty oak. It's interesting and heavy on the cherries. I don't get any of the bourbon barrel though. The flavors begin with the intial tart and sour cherry then go into an odd musty oakiness. It's different. It leaves an off raisin flavor in your mouth in the aftertaste. It reminds me of Veritas 009, which isn't good. The beer is lightly carbonated and drinks a little thin. It's just a strange sour. The alcohol isn't present until you're done sipping, then it warms your palate. Overall this is a miss for me. It sounds good on paper but then in a glass it is odd and disjointed.

Taste initially sweet chocolate flavors, immediately followed by tart cherries. Dark fruits and chocolate are much more distinct than I had imagined. Not mouth-puckering sour, but a little tart. Finishes with some lovely oak, bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate covered cherry flavors. Very complex. Nice alcohol burn at the end due to the high ABV. Mouthfeel is vinous and creamy...severely lacking in carbonation. This beer has potential to be all 5's if it were well carbonated.

Taste follow nose - much more cherry is expressed in the 2010 than the 2009. I'm also digging the bourbon character in this vintage. There's also a bit of citric acid in this one. The drinkability on the 2010 is a 4.5 in my opinion. I have to say that I enjoyed the 2010 vintage more than the 2009, but they really come off as two distinctly different beers in my opinion, so it's probably more of a preference thing.

I obviously know LA is known to have carbonation issues but you would think after all this time, and with there being carbonation in this year's Red Poppy, it would have been fixed. I refuse to rate this high because of the slight hype around this or to justify the price. To be honest, this was probably the worst $16 dollars I have spent on beer. The flavors didn't impress me, the beer was flat, and the alcohol was noticeable. Red Poppy was much more enjoyable. I really haven't given LA much business in the past due to known carbonation issues and this has affirmed I will pretty much stay away from them in the future. They do put out some good stuff but I refuse to drop that much money on a beer that does not perform. Additionally, don't try to claim ""it is supposed to be that way.""

Taste is interesting and complicated; chocolate cherries quickly upfront, followed by bourbon vanilla, some malt somewhere in there. Slight alcohol burn, not really too tart; sourness contribution could be confused between cherries or bacteria. Slightly medicinal but well balanced flavors. Slick mouthfeel, barely perceptible carbonation tickles the tongue, medium bodied. Pretty darn drinkable, if any one of the characteristics got too out of whack, drinkability would have suffered for me.

First impression upon sipping is of a strong malt base, with chocolate and some dark fruits, yielding to a lighter sourness, heavy with sour cherries and apple vinegar. Nicely integrated flavor. The malt is surprisingly strong here, the strong, heavy malt is a signature of most lost abbey brews I find, and it actually works kind of well with this one. Some alcohol heat around the edges, which makes sipping a bit of a chore at times. The finish is long and leans heavily on the light sour components.

The sourness stays through to the aftertaste, but moderate and mild. There is almost a chocolate note in the later flavors, but a bit too spicy to be sure.

No carbonation, a few random bubbles from the disturbance of the pour remain on the surface. No lacing. Quite boring in appearance. The smell is great however. Smells of sour cherries, caramelized sugars, and funk. The bourbon barrel comes through. The taste threw me for a loop. It was quite sour, more sour than the smell led on and oh so sweet on my tongue. Black cherries are very noticeable as well, staying with you from start to finish. The bourbon barrel aging gives this beer some nice complexities, especially in the taste. To me it gives it a vanilla flavor in the mix. Very good. It is very drinkable and the alcohol is very well hidden for eleven percent. My only complaint would be the lack of any carbonation which I hear is a problem with the Lost Abbey beers.

Good mouthfeel, not thick and syrupy, light in the mouth for having an ABV at this level. Low visible carbonation. Smell and taste are redolent of sour cherries, red wine, and caramel malts. Taste is more oud bruin or Flemish sour than American wild ale (as the style has been listed). Lamic-like tartness, though when I think wild ale I think brettanomyces yeast, barnyard, horse blanket and funk--none of that here. Great tasty and rich malt vinegar flavors but with balanced astringency that slopes in a nice dry finish. Cherries are the dominant flavor, though there's also plums, oak, zinfandel and tempranillo grapes, lemon juice acidity. A tasty beer, perhaps not worth the price (the price--$16 for 375 ml--is the only reason this isn't an A. For $16, you can get true Belgian in a big bottle), but it's nice to see an American brewer making this style.","TheNapkin","Jan 07, 2010"

Oh, and I'm still 100% on carbonated bottles from Port/Lost Abbey, with this being my 28th rating for them, so there. Brown-red color with a small tan head. Lots of sour cherry in the aroma, with some barrel, light bourbon, and clean sour that isn't coming from the cherries. The flavor has a rich malty base that is toppled by a dry cherry tartness. Alcohol is present but light for a beer this big. Then, sourness. Lots of it, and that is impressive considering the base beer was a pretty malty quad. Lots of cherry flavor, but there is so much going on that the balance seems about right. Full bodied with a medium carbonation level and smooth texture. A huge sour, but very well balanced.

Raisins, dark fruit - cherries, some tartness, and a touch of wood. The flavor is much more than the aroma led me to believe. Lots of dark fruit flavors meld together with a decent malt profile and cherries with a touch of wood. Extremely tasty. The mouthfeel is moderate as some of the sweetness sticks to the tongue.

Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, cherries, raisins, vinous notes, a slight nuttiness, oak, vinegar. The best thing is that not one of the flavors overpowers another. Some of the beers with bourbon components are so blatantly overpowering, but this was far from the case here. Lightly carbonated. Great mouthfeel, alcohol is barely noticeable for its ABV. Some tartness is present but there is just so much going on here that no one flavor dominates throughout. A vanilla-bourbon sweetness marries with the alcohol to help conceal it.

Tartness is very acidic and borders on vinegary with definite cherry tones. The fruits from the dark ale are truely there surrounded by all the tartness. Dark fruits play more of a role as the beer warms developing red wine like tannins. Serve this one on the warmer side. Mouthfeel is lovely with nice tannins and tart dark fruit.

Maybe a bit more sour, not as musty, less dry and astringent, not aged as long in oak barrels, smoother and more drinkable. I certainly am glad I tried it, but at $29.99, I paid a bit much and would not go seeking this out again at that price level. My review is not taking price into consideration.

The beer finishes with a tartness and slight tannic finish. The after taste is vanilla and sour cherries. I love this beer and this style. The mouthfeel is full yet not too big. This beer has many wine like properties in smell, taste and mouthfeel. This beer is extremely drinkable, but at 11% abv be careful. I could drink 10 of these no problem.

The sourness and the booziness make this a bit uneven, but a prime candidate for aging. Medium bodied with a semi-dry finish.","illidurit","Aug 05, 2008"

Swirling the glass leaves a tiny bit of lacing, but not much. Wow, smell is like no other. Tart cherries, honey, bourbon, dates, caramel, raisins, booze, and fig. The aroma with this is so complex and full, I know I'm missing something. Taste begins pretty funky and sour with young cherries and oak. The bourbon appears midway with some bready characteristics and a touch of sweet butterscotch. Aftertaste consists of sour grapes, green apples, and vanilla. Pretty sour all the way through, I could use more dark fruits on the tongue. Light to medium body with a very lively carbonation that stings the mouth. The fact that this beer is 12% is pretty scary. If I was to guess before knowing the abv, I would probably say 6-7%. Very crazy beer to say the least, one that I look forward to seeing what some age will do to it.","BeerTruth","Jul 15, 2008"

Easy to see the sour aspect and the barrel aged aspect side by side in the same beer. Really nice. Glad to have more to age this for several years before revisiting.","paytoplay","Jul 13, 2008"

I think this brewery can be among the best in the country when they get it right. The definitely got this one right. I'm drinking the most recent bottling of this for the review. Pours extremely dark brown with a light head and no real lacing. The aroma is incredible! Dark fruits, rich cherries, bitter cocoa, and some nice sourness seellessly blended. The taste is even better, with those same wonderful cherry and bitter cocoa flavoers melded together with a wonderful sourness that is somewhat restrained, but accented by the tartness of the cherries. Even though the beer is quite sour, the chocolate is so lush and pronounced that the flavors are balanced. It is like a cherry eggcream, with brandied cherries, the best quality dark chocolate, and a wonderfully minerally seltzer and some sour cherry juice added to funk it up. In addition, the oak comes through cleanly, but as a nice additional flavor and supporting actor rather than the star. Not overwhelming at all, it adds a firming woody note and some sweet vanilla. Wonderfully enjoyable! Extremely rich and lush in the mouth, but with the sour cherry that cuts right through that and makes the whole thing tremendously delicious.

Lovely sourness with suggestions of a day-old manhattan glass, some sour cherry and significant oakiness. Lightly sweet, yet lightly astringent; but finishes dry. Lowly, yet amply carbonated.

Light vanilla complements the cherries and a dry oak flavor begins mid taste and lasts in the aftertaste. The 11% is unnoticeable in the taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium, very little carbonation.

5,18.5,5,5,5,5,5,"2001 North Vineyard. Tomme produces an unlabeled bottle with cryptic Sharpie markings on the cap. According to him, an unreleased early vintage. Pouring into the glass a cherubic Indian ruby sapphire, glowing with clear glassy edges and a blood rim. Aroma carries one away into an overwhelming presence of intense red fruits from across the board, cherries and raisins percolate in the core of my brain. So bright, alive and refined. Absolutely stunning. Finally passing my lips, this lubricious liquid takes form as a mindnumbing shapeshifter. What first presents itself as a unmarked, world class malt and fruit chimeric belgian strong ale, quickly cloaks itself in a world of sourness. The best of both worlds! Trying to parse out the intricate corners of the beer, Im at a loss, its all too much. Rodenbach Alexander quickly comes to mind. The fruit character so deft, real and upfront. Palate couldnt be more satisfying, yet exacting. Ill review again with a bottle of the current batch, but I needed to expunge my thoughts with this rarest of gems.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 23, 2007"

4.85,14.9,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"As the beer descends into my vessel it appears a deep mahogany bordering on russet in color. Rich caramel and chocolate aromas waft upward while the other elements of plums, raisins, grapes and cherries seem delightfully restrained and well masked by the aromatic brettanomyces contribution, oak and leather aromas. The front palate is initially malt accented providing hints of chocolate and roast, which then leads into the mid-palate, where the brettanomyces begins to take over giving a subtle and funky tartness along with notes of cherries and green grapes. The finish is unusually lingering where the chocolate, fruit and oak flavors create a simplistic bliss. Extremely complex flavor. But the most amazing thing about this beer is its feel on the palate. Knowing that it is basically fermented with 100% brettanomyces, I expected it to be fairly light in body, yet it is by far the most coating and texturized brettanomyces infused beers that has ever touch my lips.

Low level sweetness gives way to tart cherries, grapefruit, peaches, and pears. A mild nutty, cocoa, dates sweetness rounds off the lactic sourness to a pleasant tartness. A thin, yet creamy, texture thins into the throat. Mildly puckering, but not astringent or grainy. Warming in the back of the throat accompanies some bittering. Finishes clean and tart.

The beer was tea-coloured, a slightly red-brown with a light tan fluffy head that, after the initial explosion, settled rather quickly to just a thin covering. The first thing that hit my nose was ALCOHOL. Very very alcoholic aroma, followed by cherries and a teeny bit of vanilla hiding in the background. Tasted not as alcoholic as it smelled, it was a bit oaky, very fruity with tart cherries in the forefront, very desirable in my opinion, along with other dried fruits like apricots, plums and grapes. I got a very roasted, almost too bitter aftertaste, but not really off-puttingly bitter. I really really liked this beer, it made me smile big, which was a difficult feat, considering I drank this after my first day back at work from a week-long gorgeous California vacation. But this did the trick, it made me smile. Mouthfeel was hot, and by hot I mean HOT. I felt this beer, Tomme if you will, going down the whole way, it was that warm. Cozy almost. Drinkability is very good because of the smiley cherry goodness, despite the slightly over-alcoholic feel to it. In the end it gave my tongue a tingly sensation, by the end of my glass- yes, I only had half a bottle of this, I felt quiet tingly, almost into my fingers even.

4.62,9.5,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Silver foil. Not much head, looks like quelque chose and the aroma has some common notes too. Muddy brown with bold reddish reflects. Although its totally unique, Id compare it to an oerbier reserva. It has an appealing earthy cherries aroma that lets you know from the smell its gonna be thick. Leafy, heavy vinous, airy, bitter, sweet licorice, leather and various brett tangles. Enjoyable aroma, at the limit of 8 and 9 for me, but the taste is even more so. Extremely vinous, working wonders with a sharp cheddar as I imagine it with plenty of cinammon, I could imagine mulling this. Sharp and strong herbal character, rhubard, star anise, cloves. Never feels like 11.5%.. Maple, flowers, chocolate, meat, caramel, mud, ashes etc... Liquorous texture, very syrupy, not quite still, but definitely lparticularly ightly carbonated. Surprisingly never too sweet, warming and drying out. A sensory overload. I plead guilty to still expecting it to be better though as Ive been hunting that one since it had almost no ratings. Thanks Eyechartbrew!","Rastacouere","Jan 24, 2005"
4.36,3.3,5,4,4.5,5,4,"Dark brown color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate, fruits and malts. A very complex beer. There are definite and separate flavors of; sour cherries, chocolate, raisins, rum and bananas. Nicely mixed and well balanced. Touch of alcohol bite at 12%. Very smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice, complex beer, hides the alcohol well.","beerguy101","Sep 14, 2003"
4.1,-2.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Originally sampled on 9 March 2003 at Pizza Port's Belgian Beer Fest in Carlsbad, CA. Dark brown pour, it looked like a porter. A nice aroma of sour cherry hits you. As it aired, lots of notes of brandy & complex flavors came out. A beautiful sipping beer.","jcalabre","Jun 14, 2003"
