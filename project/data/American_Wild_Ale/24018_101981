It definitely settles that sour craving but hidden behind that is a huge earthy oak that I love. I particularly loved how the blackberries don't just add a fruited note to this sour to make it accessible by sweetening it up but instead blend and add to that earthy oak that is so damn good","BergBeer","Oct 22, 2014"

Soft carbonation and a delicate finish. This and Atrial Rubicite seem inspired by Cantillon, which is certainly a good thing. A cherry showcase and a fine example of an American wild ale.","Huhzubendah","Aug 08, 2014"

Some funk and barrel in the nose, too. Starts out with a tart Burst of not quite ripe blackberries. Pick up some nice funk on the very end, with barrel notes appearing, as well. The fruit is nicely balanced here with everything else. Carbonation is around medium. Had this side by side with vsb, vsb was super carbonated compared to this. Nocturn has just a slight amount of fizz in the beginning to go along with that tartness. Not overly sour. Very nice. Pretty easy to drink and very tasty.","Mikeypnh","Jul 05, 2014"
4.58,6.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Blend 2 April 2014 bottle from trade poured on July 5, 2014. Pours a beautiful ruby red and purple color with a deep pink head that recedes somewhat quickly. Beautiful notes of vinegar and blackberries, big lacto funk sourness, wow really nice. Flavor is juicy black berries up front but dries out quickly with lots of dry oakiness, light vanilla, lacto, and big sour vinegar notes. Acidic on the tongue and that lingers with the dry oak. Lots of oak tannins and red wine notes both in aroma and flavor. Medium bodied, juicy at first with the dry finished, and high carbonation. This is crazy good and even improves as it warms and the berries really start coming through.","BMMillsy","Jul 05, 2014"

But then I'm a fan of restrained sours whereas others like them mouth puckering. I can think of 10 fruit sours that are "fruitier" than this but only in the fruit sweetness sense. This is raw fruit, vinous, dry, funky, oaky, and plain delicious. And the best thing of all, it seems like this will only age and transform graciously. I don't think I'm trading mine.

4.77,10.9,4.5,5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: A HUGE improvement over the last iteration of this beer. The last one was rather vinegary and somewhat light on actual blackberry flavor. This was more like blackberry cobbler. I think by this point it's pretty clear I'm a Jester King fan-boy.","WTKeene","May 25, 2014"
4.12,-4.2,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"O- This was a very nice fruited AWA however it's not quite as flavorful as I was hoping. It was definitely very enjoyable but has a hard time standing up against other JK sours such as Atrial and Aurelian. That being said this is a great beer that any fruited sour fan needs to try.","jaasen64","May 25, 2014"

3.8,-11.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This gorgeous looking brew is one of the better fruited dry sour ales by Jester King (among Nocturn, Atrial and Aurelian). My favorite is Atrial, followed by this, then Aurelian is a distant third. This brew has a much better feel than Aurelian. At the same time, the flavor lacks some complexity. I would like to taste more oak and berry notes. The tart flavor is outstanding on its own.","TotallyHosed","Beers"

4.1,-4.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Got in a trade with cyde. 500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 1, bottled in 9/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a small foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart blackberry, sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, vinegar, red wine, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, blackberries, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart blackberry, sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, vinegar, red wine, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart blackberry, sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, vinegar, red wine, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, blackberries, and oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of sweetness/tartness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited sour ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, blackberries, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 26, 2014"

3.84,-10.7,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Served in a tulip. Pours a garnet hue with a cloudy clarity and a loose, off-white head. Nose expresses sour milk (somewhat rank) and tart berries. Taste follows nose - berries are much more prevalent and thankfully, the sour milk character drops off appreciably. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an almost still carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a good sour but not mind-blowing.","Jwale73","Jan 19, 2014"
