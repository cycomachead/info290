4.18,-4.8,3.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Verdict: A very nice sour beer from Cascade, certainly one of their finer endeavors, plenty of red wine, smooth and mellow in flavor, not too cripplingly sour, but with nice a pucker, very easy to drink, not too heavy despite the darker base and higher ABV. Definitely worthy of the accolades.","kevanb","Mar 21, 2015"

4.55,3.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"i really dont miss the whiskey element from the sang noir, and think the port wine is way more complimentary to the cherries, which are puckery and juicy and enormous in aroma and taste. dark red brew, looks like cloudy red wine, but with a lively head that settles in time. sharply lactic nose, with hints of lemon and virgin oak, new and sweet, which merges with the cherry very well. the wine has a dessert like character for sure in the nose, like a red wine reduction in a pan. concentrated grape and tannic aromatics, very intense, very mouthwatering. the flavor is equally intense, with the oak and grape intensity marrying beautifully with the cherries. way more sour than other cascade beers that i can remember, maybe one of the most sour beers ive ever had. where this whiskey put vanilla and booze into the sang noir, this royal maintains its fruitiness all the way though, and the sourness is rightly more exposed. beautiful balance, wildly complex, titillatingly sour, luxurious in feel, and frankly one of the more unique beers in the world. every bit as good as consecration, although i have never had the two side by side. stupendously good, even a standout by the already lofty cascade standards. wow, just wow.","StonedTrippin","Oct 21, 2014"

4.35,-0.9,,,,,,"Pours a deep brown, ruby red color, hazy with a short-lived bubbly tan head with no lacing.  Big tart nose here, loaded with sour cherries, lemon rind, a bit of funk.  On the palate, the first sip assaults the sour taste buds on the back of ones tongue; it is an intense blast of vinegar!  The flavor does transition nicely though, especially as the beer and my palate opens up and the subtleties come through, again, sour cherries, grape skins, oak, wet wood, and vinous notes. The body is medium and the carbonation keeps it light.  This was a really interesting beer.","mtomlins","Sep 29, 2014"

Was definitely interesting, though I don’t know if I’d call it a winner. It could have been the supplication I had prior to this skewing my thoughts, so I’ll certainly have to revisit, but I just felt as though it was a little flat and not very complex. Don’t get me wrong, the flavor was decent, but it never evolved as it warmed and stayed somewhat muted.","taylor714914","Dec 03, 2013"

4,-8.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, subtle funk, dark fruit, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one was tasted in series with the other Cascade brews and it was another continuation of solid brews. I really like how this one took all the aspects people have grown to expect from the style and make it shine. I really wish there would have been a fruit aspect going on. It would have helped out with the tart and sour dominance of this one. Definitely worth seeking out if you have not had it.","thagr81us","Jul 10, 2012"

Carbonation appears to be moderate. This one starts off smelling FUNKY! Really earthy, barnyard smell, tobacco, oak, pepper, a hint of fruit. Initially offensive, but opens up into all kinds of interesting aromas. Starts off with a tart cherry flavor, mouth puckering, definite oak presence with some white pepper, blue cheese, red wine vinegar, followed by a medium dry finish. As it warms up dark fruit and chocolate start to emerge an increase in intensity. A lot of wine presence in this beer. There are so many layers to the flavor and mouthfeel it is hard to wrap your head around, but it is pretty fun to try to figure it out.

4.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2009 Vintage brewed with grapes. Pours a muddy brown color with a hint of red. Nice, frothy white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very funky with a TON of red grape aroma. Lots of oak and acidic characteristics as well. Lovely blend of funk, tart, and grape in the nose. Taste is amazing with complex barrel flavors . Tons of delicious oak flavors with cherry and red grape. Very acidic and sour with mouth-puckering finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with very tart finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, Cascade never has disappointed me, and this is definitely the most complex beer I've had from them. Top notch.","DovaliHops","Nov 14, 2011"

The Port and Cabernet Barrels have really influenced this beer well beyond my expectations. The dark caramel malts are such a great canvas for the Brett yeast and the dark vinous Port and Cabernet barrel-aging. I imagine I enjoyed this beer more than I would have the straight Port aging/Cherry version which either preceded or followed this version. Amazing, probably top 3 sours ales I have ever had to date.","claspada","Oct 18, 2011"

There's a nice, bright raspberry/fruit vinaigrette with a rich fruit, mild cocoa. Quite New Belgium-like in some ways. Leather and earth are present as well. The palate opens quite sour with vinegar, apple cider and raspberry , very bright and tasty. The mid-palate has oak, leather and tannins, with grapes and grape skin tannins. The tannins linger on the finish. Medium in body, medium-light in body, this is excellent.","DefenCorps","Sep 16, 2011"

4.13,-5.9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Bottle labeled 2009. Pour is what I would expect from an Oud Bruin. Auburn with faint reddish highlights. Pour into a tulip yields a significant and creamy looking beige head. Very nice delivery. Sweet tart aroma is subdued and somewhat woody. Not as complex as Marron Acidife, or the exemplary Haandbaak, but still very nice. Taste is also more subdued than I expected, but still very tart and puckering. Cherries do not make their presence known. Somewhat similar to Consecration. Mouthfeel is very smooth, very creamy. Bottle was gone in no time. Overall, a very nice beer, and a top eschelon competitor for beers in the Flanders style. Price point, like Marron Acidife, is a bit steep, but there is no denying the deliciousness and quality of this beer. A welcom luxury.","Onibubba","Sep 10, 2011"

4.09,-6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Very interesting beers from this brewery, sometimes very, very good. I applaud the eforts to make the sour beers, and I think they are mostly successful, and I'm mostly happy to support them. That being said, these beers are quite pricey- in the realm of the better Cantillon brews, and as much as I like the Cascade sours, I think they miss the mark set by leaders in the category like Cantillon, Russian River, and the best from Lost Abbey (although they are even more wildly expensive, albeit better). In short, although I enjoyed this beer but think its a bit overrated, especially for the price. I certainly wouldn't go out of your way to trade anything rare for this. On to the beer itself: Pours a somewhat muddy, reddish-brown with a nice head that sticks around. Smells creamy and tart, with big lactic notes followed by fresh, ripe cherries. Quite lovely in the nose. The taste falls just short of the nice aroma. Similar to start, with very tart lactic notes and vibrant cherries, but the finish is somewhat watery and woody. The mouthfeel is alternately tart and oaky and soft and smooth. Nice to try once.","Georgiabeer","Jun 20, 2010"

4.3,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I like that this has a nice oak backbone to it; that and the tartness really helps to bring a suave balance to the jam-like, rich fruit character. I paired this beer with some fish tacos for the last 25cl and this brings out a peppery spiciness from the oak as well as more of the wood-like flavors, but what it really does is accentuate the rich fruit character that is in this beer. This is a really nice, rich, complex, layered beer that retains its ample drinkability. A fantastic beer, that I am quite happy to have polished a bottle off of.","Gueuzedude","Jul 03, 2009"

Sourness in the taste is not too overpowering, in fact it is fairly gentle on the palate. As expected, body is light and crisp.
