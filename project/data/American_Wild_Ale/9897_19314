I'd happily drink this anytime I'm in the mood for a sour, but, given the choice, I'd probably pick up a Rodenbach Grand Cru before this since I could get twice as much for the same price.","beermeplz","Mar 28, 2015"

Light Brussels lacing.  The nose is packed with oak, hazlenut, and a trace of Brett.  I taste a very nice blend of tart Brett and earthy oak.  The mouth is fairly carbonated and dry.","Franziskaner","Mar 27, 2015"

4.1,2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"375 ml bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a dark amber color with about a half inch off-white head.  The head didn't stay around for too long, but there's a good amount of lacing.  I liked the aroma, the brew smells like tart cherries, caramel, green grapes, oak and vinegar.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some berries, plum and vanilla that I notice.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has a good amount of carbonation.  Surprisingly this is the first time I've tried this.  I've seen it around for a long time, but for whatever reason I never picked up a bottle until recently.  It's definitely worth trying, I thought it was good.  $7.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Sep 18, 2014"

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/8/2013. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cranberry, lemon zest, green apple, plum, raisin, red grape, caramel, leather, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon zest, plum, raisin, red grape, caramel, leather, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon zest, plum, raisin, red grape, caramel, leather, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of tart/fruity/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately slick/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome sour red ale. All around great complexity and balance of tart/fruity/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 25, 2014"

4.08,1.5,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a solid example of a American Wild Ale, it had just enough tartness to that is a little sour and it wasn't as acidic as some Wild Ales can beer so I thought the balance was pretty nice. This beer beer had very nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, not too acidic, a little refreshing, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, this is a nice beer to split, but I would have no problem drinking a whole bottle to myself and I think it would make for a good beer to enjoy when it's warmer outside. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, the balance, and the drinkability, those three things are what made this beer as good as it. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I could think that could improve this beer, but I wouldn't mind if it was a couple dollars cheaper. I would for sure buy this beer again and I would like to get a bottle to put in the cellar so I can see how it changes over time and I would recommend this to anyone who likes American Wild Ales and beers that are on the funky and tart side, it might even make for a good beer to introduce someone to the style. All in all I enjoyed this beer, that wasn't always the case, but now that I've got a taste for these types of beers I am really starting to appreciate how good and unique Jolly Pumpkin is. It's not my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer or American Wild Ale, but it's far away from being my least favorite. Good job guys, keep doing your thing Jolly Pumpkin.","StoutHunter","Mar 07, 2014"

The taste is really strong on the bourbon and oak flavors which are immediately followed by mildly sour cherries, some grape notes, some earthy notes, a bit of citrus and a nice, dry finish. It has a full body for the style (lended to it by the oak, I think) with a medium amount of carbonation and a clean, dry finish. Just the right balance of body and tartness. Pretty awesome.

3.56,-11.4,4.5,4,3,3.75,3.75,"As I crack the cork, this beer is a gusher. Like a geyser, this liquid is out of the bottle, and I see some of my well bought booze ooze onto the table. The geyser was quickly stopped after the first pour, but I would like to warn others to its gushing potential. The beer pours a deep, caramelized, burgundy color with very light orange hints. It pours with a fair head of medium sized, lightly yellowing bubbles that fizzle down to about a quarter of a finger’s width. In the light the beer is like a ruby red grapefruit color, with a dark, opaque body that seems a bit murky, but does show some nice, lazy bubbles running to the head. The head leaves a light lacing of spatter marks on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of a tart, earthy must. As the scent lingers in the nostrils I get more distinct notes of cherry and leather, much akin to a Flanders red, but subtler. A creamy, scentless sense seems to dominate the nose, which is a little bewildering to me. Even subtler than the funk is soft vanilla and oak. As the beer breathes, distinct lactic scents travel up from the glass to give the feel of a subtle Flanders red. This smells good but I want more of it! On the tongue, the beer tastes a bit like a muddled mess. Almost middling tart acidity moves bad funk notes with an odd, light bitterness that moves into smooth tannic bitterness, while a light, earthy salinity touches over the tongue. The sweet, caramelly malt in the background is nice but a bit watery, leaving the beer without the balance of the great Flanders reds. In flavor, the beer begins as tart, green apple with a bit of basement must. The must grows to an unpleasant funk with plastic and medicinal notes to it. Within the must there are intriguing hints of grass, hay, and loamy dirt, but these get caught up and jumbled into an odd sweetness, falling into a less desirable flavors. The finish is of a rotting forest floor with musty leaves intertwining with decay and soft caramel notes, and the aftertaste is nice tannic oak with vanilla and very faint, light roast coffee. This beer has a lot of potential, but just does not seem to pull its parts together. In the mouth the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a thin, lightly-watery mouthfeel that doesn’t fit the style well. Carbonation is soft and smooth, and actually quite nice, though surprising given my bottles gushing opening. The mouth is left fairly clean accept for light acid-canceling saliva. Overall, this beer is a bit of a letdown. It has subtlety and grace in the nose, but it muddles everything in the taste and never quite weaves them together. I wonder if a bit more time in the bottle might have aided the beer along. The beer does get better as you drink it, and does have some interesting points for a seasoned sour/wild/etc… drinker, but is definitely not a beginner’s beer. The more I drink of it the more I note a definite oaky tannin to the taste, which I actually deeply appreciate but it doesn’t seem to work with the rest of the beer. I’m happy I tried it, and I hope it gets better in future batches, or perhaps with age, but for the time being I would say it is not good enough for its price point.","Maxwell","Sep 10, 2013"

It's much too tart fruit forward without any real oak or lacto to balance it out. I've heard from my friends that previous batches of this beer were outstanding, but Batch 8 just reminds me of a tart, balsamic vinegar bomb. A decent wild ale - wish it were cheaper.","MighHighBrewer","Jun 30, 2013"

A Belgian import like Rodenbach Grand Cru is a better value. If you prefer your Flanders Red Ales very sour like I do, La Roja isn't exactly the ticket for a sourness-fix. It has complexity for sure, but if you expected a puckering palate walloping, this is not the beer that'll do it for you. La Roja is an easy-going Flanders Red.","hagbergl","Apr 23, 2013"

Maraschino cherries, green apple, rum, butterscotch, toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, spice, and something tart....Jolly Ranchers come to mind though its been along time since I've had any. Taste is crisp, clean, sour, tangy, fruity...fermented fruity...and enjoyably bitter. Definitely some nutty stuff going on here in an intriguing and mouthwatering way. There's something reminiscent of stinky armpits in this...not to be taken negatively. Earthy and rooty flavors perhaps... Rooibos? The sourness of this grows on you as you get further in. Texture is lightweight and delicate. Grape-like dry, finely gritty, slick throughout, and generally lip smacking. Medium body with soft carbonation. I am enjoying this.

Maraschino cherries, green apple, rum, butterscotch, toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, spice, and something tart....Jolly Ranchers come to mind though its been along time since I've had any. Taste is crisp, clean, sour, tangy, fruity...fermented fruity...and enjoyably bitter. Definitely some nutty stuff going on here in an intriguing and mouthwatering way. There's something reminiscent of stinky armpits in this...not to be taken negatively. Earthy and rooty flavors perhaps... Rooibos? The sourness of this grows on you as you get further in. Texture is lightweight and delicate. Grape-like dry, finely gritty, slick throughout, and generally lip smacking. Medium body with soft carbonation. I am enjoying this.

First sip: solid fruity tartness upfront...sour, spicy cherries and berries, and some phenols lingering in the back. Less acidic than the aroma. Dry and pretty crisp; sweet, but not too sweet. The spiced, wooden earthiness continues through to the flavor and works well with the fruit. This is tasty stuff. I dig the sourness, though the astringency is a bit much in the nose and detracts from the more pleasant aromas. All around though, a fairly smooth, lip-smacking, tart experience and one that I will likely have again at some point.","wedge","Apr 07, 2012"

At mid-palate, I get some of the contributions from the oak-aging, but it's kept in-check by the tart character of the beer. The beer claims to be ``brewed in the Flanders tradition'', but it lacks the accompanying, balancing sweetness of, say, a Rodenbach. Still, whether this beer is an American Wild Ale or a Flemish Red Ale, it is a nice example of one of the most refreshing styles of beer one can find.

The flavor is much the same with an initial taste of the sour tart cherry from which a grape fruit character builds, vinegar flavors, hints of oak, vanilla. Mild bitterness, no hint of alcohol.

A funky mixture of citrusy, vinegary, barnyard 'off flavors', oak, lactic acid, and flavors undistinguishable. Yeeeeah. Taste follows the nose, the malt and the hops are not the star of this show.

Still a great soured brown, and I'd like to see what this beast taste like with some age on it.

3.8,-5.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"*Blend 13, 2008. This one has been aging for awhile and it's noticable early. Pours a murky orange color with a quickly dissapating head. Smell is light but of vinegar, vanilla and oak from the barrels. Smells much different from a fresher blend of la roja. Taste is still very good but it has lost a lot of that vinegar punch you would expect. Seems its a lot more oak coming through now and the cherries have disappeared too. Still a very good American wild ale but I'd have to prefer a fresher blend.","JustinMatthew","Nov 05, 2011"

This american wild ale is the best I have had. The smell is so right on it makes me feel like I am sitting inside of the oak barrel with the beer inside of some darkly lit cool cellar. I've tasted many attempts at this style that go so awry. How did they get it so right. A clean sour and some peppery taste makes me wish I was really in the barrel with this beer so I could drink it all.

4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer appears dark ruby hued with a half inch of tan head that leaves some nice lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings funk, wild yeast, oak, cherries, assorted fruit. Really nice flavor. Complex, sour, delicious. I am a happy guy. I have had this a few times now. While this is not necessarily a great introduction to the style (though Jeff may disagree), due to the brash complexity and unorthodox nature of the beer, I highly recommend this. Sour cherries, with a healthy sour, lactic presence. The beer in some regards reminds me of Russian River Consecration, which is a very good thing. Ya man, this beer is good stuff.

Really opens up and smooths out over ten minutes. The taste followed the nose but was a little tart at first. Then something amazing happened. The more I let it air out and breathe, the more the beer smoothed out and came to life. By the end I was saying, ""Holy crap, I really like this beer"". Very complex in every category, and very enjoyable/drinkable. Highly recommended for the style.","jayhawk73","Aug 31, 2011"

The smell of the beer was fruity and funky. It looked red in color with a minimal head and lacing. The taste of the beer was tart and had plenty of sour qualities to it. The beer pairs really well with the oysters because they was a lots of black pepper in them. The sour and pepper balanced each other out really well.

4.32,7.5,4,4.5,4,5,4.5,"La Roja is most definitely a Flanders-style sour - oaky and fruity and funky. And it's tart, with slightly sour fruit popping up throughout. But it doesn't beat you over the tongue with puckering vinegar, and it doesn't try to emulate the horde of brews that have recently taken a shot at this style. It's complex and layered, tasty and drinkable. Looking out for the grand reserve :-J","rand","Jun 21, 2011"

4.45,10.7,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Tonight I need something to kind of wake me up, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of La Roja hiding out in my fridge. What’s more it’s the inaugural vintage from 3 years ago, as the label simply states “Blend 1, 2008.” Guess it’s been there for awhile. Pours a murky blood orange red with no head. Aroma is of oaked funk. Bring on the sour! I’m guessing this is a take on a Flanders Red, given the aroma and appearance. First taste is sour, but not overpowering. Tart cherry hits the sides of the tongue before being washed away by earthy funk in the finish. The taste is wild, but at the same time it’s very restrained. The oak helps keep things in line, and the lengthy aging process has added a nice sherry complexity to things. Mouthfeel is light to medium, with a nice level of carbonation that helps to brighten things up and scrub the palate as you continue to drink it. I’ve had a number of sour beers and this one is among the most well rounded. By that I mean it’s not unnervingly sour – it’s an evenly crafted beer from start to finish. Speaking of the finish, it’s dry, perhaps as to be expected, which means that you keep going back to it. Overall this beer is a refreshing diversion and a must try if you’re a fan of sour or wild ales. If you happen to run across it I’d recommend cellaring it for a couple of years and busting it out. You won’t regret it.","eclaycamp","May 16, 2011"

3.85,-4.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall: A very interesting and complex beer; Jolly Pumpkin excels at offering beers that go beyond beer. Like other Flanders' ales, it has more sour fruit, is dry, and tastes like cider or wine rather than beer. The earth notes are a pleasant addition that add some grit into the beer.

It could be tart cherries, that's probably the closest fruit I'd relate it to. I'm a fan. It made the others in the room pucker. The flavors are very funky and very tart. It has a lot of cherry and a lot of Granny Smith apple to it. It drinks very crisp with an excellent tart bite. This is a fine sour. This beer is drinkable all things considered.

The flavor reminded me more of a flanders red but funkier. the cherries were more potent on the palate with oaky, funky, and slight vinegar accents with acidic tart lemony notes. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, acidic, citrusy, oaky, funky, tart, and tingly finish. It drank great and reminded me how tarty this brew was.

As with the best Jolly Pumpkin bottles the nose is rich, integrated, with a wholesome wallop of oak and brett. Cherries and red wine barrel really come out here, wet wood, bugs. I have found that in the past 3-4 years Jolly Pumpkin stuff has tended to become on the bland side for some reason, whether it's less time in the oak, less attention from the brewer, or what have you. I think this would have been fairly nondescript fresh, but 2 years is a nice age here. Mouth is fairly expressive with sour cherries, green apple, oak of course, brett. Green apple is very welcome and is quite strong. A strange bit of mint on the finish that's kind of distracting. Medium carbonation, good amount, soft feel.

The opening earthy barnyard character is subtle and not so overpowering like an old, stinky gueuze. It's followed by tart lemon and sour cherries. It doesn't come off as the most complex sour, though maybe a year or two in a cellar would change that. but it's pleasantly sour while remaining relatively drinkable and I appreciate that.","tempest","Oct 29, 2010"

The aroma is funky and pretty tart with notes of tart cherries and sweet malt dominating. A little aroma of wet wood is also present. The taste is a bit more mild than the aroma would suggest, but still very nice. There is a light tartness and signature JP funk mixed with some lightly sweet and tart cherries and damp wood.

The taste is has some of the same attributes. Tart and sour, spices, bready, some kinds of fruits I'm not sure what kinds but they are there. Kind of zesty, lemon stands out but I know there is more to it. The mouthfeel is pretty good and the alcohol is not there at all. Pretty drinkable, kind of sour but it's not terribly bad.

Likely had a complex grain bill, but the hard-working yeast(s) have made this brew highly-attenuated and crisp with not much residual sweetness.

4.22,5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Batch 4. Bottled 4.23.10. Murky copper color (much like an apple cider) but really looked like an oude bruin. Musty aroma with sour green apple, lots of wild yeast, soured cherry, green raison, and a faint nose of old hops. Taste is semi-tart with more green apple and lots of earthy red malt. Great moderate acidity that makes this dangerously drinkable. A 750ml is perfect for me. A 12oz. just wouldn't be enough.

Some bourbon-like aromas too--vanilla, oak, and butter. Taste follows with some real complexity. I do, however, recommend drinking this at near-room temperature, as it really opens up. Big bold vinegar, apple, yeast, oak, butter, vinegar, must, yeast, and some others that I can't pick out. Robust, but balanced at the same time, I like it.

Big sour, fruity (red berries, cherries) nose intermixed with wood. A bit of mustiness follows towards the back. Taste follows nose, but fruit flavors are incredibly muted by the sour, with the wood character really coming out in the mix. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with a slightly prickly effervescence that finally culminates in a dry finish.

This is really lambic-y up front... tart lime and apple, lemon rind, funky wet wood and dust. However as you drink it and as it warms, the delicious hearty caramel notes of a well made Belgian ale come through from underneath. Once your tongue gets used to the sourness there's plenty more to this beer. Sweet, earthy, ripe, and fruity.

3.92,-2.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark reddish brown color, very very hazy. There's probably a 5cm head on top that's a yellow/tan color. It's tough to judge an american wild ale on appearance since they range so much in color (and are allowed to I suppose). The smell is like apple cider, a bit of vinegar, general sour smells, but there is a very clear scent of malty sweetness underneath. It actually smells good, but a bit different than usual, not all out sour. The taste is difficult to judge based on the classification too, from the different american wild ales I've had. This one has a very distinct bready taste. But the taste is still funky, not as sour as some, but pleasant. There's like a subtle vinegar flavor, and without carbonation, this would taste sort of like a sour red wine. Very full bodied, almost chewy. It kind of leaves a funny feeling on the tongue and roof of your mouth. Tasting it, you would have no idea that there's alcohol in it until you feel it. Overall a good beer, kind of expensive, but I'd recommend it to all.","taylorhamrick","Jan 10, 2009"

All and all it really falls short for me, flat in flavor, almost one dimensional, wood is just a tease once the body is felt.

To be honest though this beer becomes a bit blander once your tongue gets used to the sourness, but still tastes good.

The aroma is a strong red wine, tart and tangy, lemon concentrate. The taste has red wine characteristics, lemon, sour cherries, unripe tropical fruit. The feel is light with very active carbonation, perhaps a bit too strong; finishes sour and tart. Not big on sour/tart brews so it kills the drinkability. The carbonation is a bit aggressive as well.

3.3,-17.9,4,4,3,3,3,"This beer pours a deep, semi-opaque burnt orange color with reddish accents in the wide-mouth goblet I'm pouring into. The head is lively and rocky, mimicking pie merange of a pale sand color. Some yeast particles are found in suspension in the glass despite a careful pour. Impressive appearance all the way around. Spots of thick lacing line the glassware as the beer's head recedes a bit. The nose is quite complex and openly betrays the fact that this beer has been aged in oak. Predominant notes of sweet rum, caramel, vanilla and spice. Despite what I've read elsewhere, I don't detect a lot of alcohol in the nose here. Mild sweet malts meet wild yeast and collaborate to make for an interesting, but slightly disjointed, combination of aromas. The palate is an expansion of the nose, hitting you with multiple flavor elements in a random attack of funk and smooth, mellowed malts. Although this beer is called a Biere de Garde, I'm not tracking with that descriptor at all. If anything, this is an odd oak-aged Flanders Red. The spicy aspects are nice and you can really taste the oak, but the constituent elements just don't quite come together for me. Very phenolic, but oddly flat at times. This beer has a bit of an identity crisis. Sufficiently carbonated, but a little thin feeling in the mouth. This improves slightly as th beer warms to ambient temperature, but still leaves something lacking. A respectable 7.2 ABV is hidden well beneath the oak and bitterness - the latter of which really lingers long on the palate. As a Biere de Garde, this misses the point. As a Flanders Red, this beer has a ton of potential and might synthesize flavors a little better given some additional aging in the bottle. I'd we willing to try this again, but would like to see it sit for a couple years and round the ragged edges. I've heard great things about Jolly Pumpkin beers. La Roja was my first sample of the Dexter, MI brewer's offerings. They didn't scare me off completely with this one, but I'd like to sample some of their other brews and hope for a little more continuity of flavor. I wanted to LOVE this beer, based on my preconceived notions, but it really didn't quite live up to the expectations I (likely unfairly) had in my mind.

First, the beer is a nice dark ruby with plenty of bubbly head, retention, and lacing. The smell is outstanding, and I thought I was going to be experiencing a genuine Flemish Red ale. This has the smell of an oak aged Rodenbach or Duchesse De Bourgogne. You'll get the nice cherry, wood aged, spicy yeast, the orange rind, coupled with some tangy vinegar. If only the taste matched the aroma, but alas no. This is a slightly over carbonated medium bodied beer. The taste has the slightly sour, tannic acid, oaky flavor of a Flemish Red, but it is not nearly puckerish enough, nor sweet enough. There is some spice to this beer in the background, but it just does not have enough oak aged, leached tannins, not enough cherry flavors either.

The carbonation is nice and highlights the light body of the beer. I was able to finish my glass but i can't in good conscience recommend this beer. I might try this beer again if somebody offers me a glass but I wouldn't buy it.","wheelinshirt","Oct 05, 2007"

The aroma was made up of cinnamon, sour apples and cherries, and some faint caramel and yeast notes. The flavor was a bit mild compared to the initial impression given by the aroma. A bit tart, but not overly sweet or sour. The barrel aging seemed to really mellow and balance this beer out. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of fizzy carbonation.

Peaches, raspberries, cherries, bananas, oranges, cranberries, and pineapple all working together with an incredibly refreshing acidity. Lots of brett funk.

Some tartness, some caramel and crystal malt sweetness but neither overpowering each other, some champagne-like flavors near the finish. I was expecting some more sourness, but I'm not disappointed. Healthy carbonation, prickly on the tongue with the medium-to-lighter body; attenutaion seems almost complete. Dry finish with some seltzer water aftertastes.

Delicious and refreshing acidity stays while hints of toasted caramel and light cookie malt come through. Some wood, metal, smoke and indeterminable spice as well.

The beer pours a hazy chestnut hue and is a little foamy with 5cm of beige head even with a very gentle pour. The aroma is big with red grapes and tart cherries mixing with some general booziness. The first sip reveals an average body with silky texture and very fine yet tingly carbonation. Flavor is rich and fruity with red grapes and cherry tartness again. There is lots of wooden oak flavor and bready yeast too. I even get a bit of flemish red lactic action to add to the tart cherries. NO hint of the ABV. very drinkable and complex.

Now to what was truely nice about the beer. With the spontanious fermentation it gives it a lovely sour tanin note to it that reminds me of a nice red wine.

Aroma has tart cider oak barrel notes, it's almost perfumey in nature enticing to say the least...vinous as in from the vine notes run rampant as well. Amongst the poetry of aromatics this beer has to offer, comes an amazing spice mix and funky wild barnyard notes, in the words of Vince Vaughn's character in Swingers this beer is ""so money"". Taste definitely rings in with a rolling crescendo of different flavors, bready at times with hints of charred oak some bitterness from herbal hop bursts entwined with a caramel inspired malt profile. WIth thos spice additions delivered from the heavens above, also comes the backbone of the flavor profile that tart cider character. Delicious on multiple levels not much left to report here. Mouthfeel...this is beer that captivates your palate with it's medium body and fine carbonation it really goes down much too smooth. This is beer really captures the Belgian style ales mouthfeel that most American brewers have a hard time recreating and I'm guessing this is being pulled off with all of the traditional brewing methods. Drinkability is excellent on both in number and leaving me to desire more of the incredible flavors melded in this brew. This Haiwaiin/Spanish speaking individual up in Dexter, MI has not disappointed me yet and so far I've had the Bam biere, Blanca, Oro de Calablaza, and the Luciernaga all incredible I really admire these products.","WVbeergeek","0"

The smell was sour (both lemony and lactic) and earthy, with a hint of wood. The taste was dominated by Brettanomyces tartness, which proceeded into a lemony dryness with a minor floral hops flourish. As the beer continued to breathe, the funky effect started to wear off a bit, and more fruity sweet malt flavors like pear, and green apples started to emerge. Quite soft on the palette despite the high carbonation, the viscosity of the body was just right to allow the flavors to linger on the tongue.

Quick sense of yeasty funkiness and astringency, cherry flavors, but with an ever-present backing of unsweetened chocolate, enough to catch in the back of the throat. Some decided senses of toasted Wheat Chex. What strikes me most about this beer is an early complexity with aroma enhancement, but a relatively simple and diminished close to the profile. Certainly not a run-of-the-mill brew, I'll leave the sense of ""charm"" to the cheerleaders. Good drinkability, nothing is offensive, despite thinking more was coming.","ADR","Apr 18, 2006"

More like a Oud Bruin or this new category American Sour Ale. I think I would grade it better for those styles. The drinkability is ok.

3,-25.4,4,4,2.5,3,2.5,"The barrel-aging really just ruins this. It's too bright and forward, and lets precious little of the beer shine through. What they provide it not congruent to the beer itself, and the result is something that is muddled and atonal if not downright ugly. I suspect these are new, and just too intense, After a couple more run-throughs, these barrels might work perfectly. And maybe this would be a whole new animal then, but I suspect the malt-bill is needy as well. Simply put: on the whole, it needs help. It is interesting for a second or two....then it becomes work.","cokes","Oct 04, 2005"

The smell is dark fruits and cherries, almost almond. Lots of sweetness and malt. I'm interested. The flavor is a let down. I was expecting more sweetness and spice. I actually get a lot of aclohol there, which interferes with the flavor. The beer is slightly nutty and raisiney, but just overall lacking. The feel is light moderate with an active carbonation. I'd ike to see more thickenss in the brew. Overall, I'm not as impressed as I expected to be. The nose really did it for me, but the flavor and mouthfeel really fell short. I don't see myself going back to this one any time soon.","kmpitz2","Sep 17, 2005"

The aroma is fruity with some caramel and a lot of sweetness - there is also some spice that I don't know how to describe. Possibly a port or sherry aroma - this is the best I can come up with. The flavor isn't nearly as impressive as the aroma. It's nice with some nutty character and some biscuit, but it could use some other character. Finish is dry. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is pretty good.","clvand0","Sep 09, 2005"

Light yeast notes as well. Big sweet caramel covered fruit flavor starts it off. Some dark fruits with a bit of peppery spiciness underneath. A bit yeasty and some sugar notes. Ends with a spicy fruit finish. Lively creamy feel and a bit dry at time. Really easy drinking and enjoyable.

They've certainly done their homework on presentation: great brewery name, beer names, labels, bottles, etc. Ultimately, though, the contents of those bottles is the only thing that matters. I have little doubt that with a few years under its belt, this will be a better (if still not a great) beer. Right now, I can't recommend it.

After a little while, it was dominated by a familiar taste, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then, it hit me.... Jim Beam! After that, it was so dominant - I finally had to stop. Halfway through the 750, I had to pour it out. It was starting to make me sick. Amazing that this is a relatively low ABV beer, because the whiskey flavor is all I could taste. I like beer, not whiskey. Not for me.","JohnnyDuvel","0"
4.11,2.2,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours an amber-red hue with a luscious, thick white head. The aroma at first seems accented by caramel with a hint of oak, but later on I notice a hint of black licorice. Almost a quarter-inch layer of foam stay puts as I take in the aroma for several minutes. The mouthfeel of this first sip is very soft; the mouthfeel feels a bit thin at first, but gets thicker towards the finish. Some lacework is left as I take a few sips. The sublime caramel and toffee malt flavors in this beer are almost over-powered by a brazen rum-like middle, but the finish is coated with a hint of earthy spice (anise perhaps, or a hint of nutmeg?) coated in candy sugar. There's some bitterness from hops, too, which tends to express itself more as the beer warms up. I like this one quite a bit. I also have to admit I like the buccaneer kitty kat featured on the label.","marcobrau","Jul 17, 2005"

Mellow tart aspects, cloves and earthy dryness in abundance. Mellow barrel notes, possibly the most obvious of the 4 JP and definitely the driest. Cork flavors, bitter finish. Soft and elegant gentle bubbles accompany the lenghty finish. Very cohesive. Im with Mat.

Aroma is of slightly spicy yeasts, with barrel notes easily noted, although I almost wish they were a bit more in the background. Taste is initally a somewhat fruity spice bread, which traipses into oak-land, and then returns with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, very creamy, which keeps the aging notes from completely taking over, and the drinkability is great. Another good one from Jolly Pumpkin...","ppoitras","Jan 03, 2005"

Unlike the other JPs, that are just touched with the barrel aging, the barrel is a serious part of the flavor in this beer. This is enjoyable, and unlike a barrel-aged tripel, the double is a little more robust and sits a bit better with it. Once again, maybe I'll make my obligatory call for JP in Pennsylvania :).

3.75,-6.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Ultimately, I think that this beer is a little out of wack, it is sort of in the gray zone between conventionally fermented single yeast strain fermented beers, infected beers, and beers that are fermented purposefully with wild, yet house derived character. This beer needs to decide which way it wants to go, and I would certainly be in favor of it going fully funky, if it can be kept in balance. Right now it is certainly interesting, certainly drinkable, and even enjoyable, but it seems a bit muddled by various competing fermentation by products. I could see a bottle of this beer being laid down for a year or two and becoming quite stellar, if not intriguingly different. While I am being quite critical here, this is a beer that I am quite enjoying, and I will look forward to procuring some more bottles of this beer. Cheers to Jolly Pumpkin for pushing the boundaries in the middle of America, and cheers to my personal Santa who delivered this treat to my doorstep.","Gueuzedude","Nov 01, 2004"

The nose is a bit on the weak side with notes of toasted malts, spice, and cherry liquer. The taste begins with a fruity flavor which is mainly cherry but there's also some banana phenols and red grape tannins in here, like a hefeweizen meets merlot mixture. The toasted malts are here as well but get overwhelmed by the alcohol flavor. This is like spiced rum at times. The alcohol gets too strong and I feel it towards the finish. The yeasty aspect is not quite there in the finish but I do notice a slight earthy flavor in the middle that is probably from the yeast. Body is medium and not too lively. This beer has excellent potential but is simply too young right now. Try it in a year and it will be fabulous. But for now, stick with the Oro de Calabaza.","granger10","Sep 12, 2004"
