Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an almost still carbonation and a semi-dry finish.  Overall, a top notch beer.  I think I prefer it better fresh; however, this beer has held up quite well.","Jwale73","Feb 22, 2015"

Aroma is sour, tart, oaky, apple cider vinegar, unripe orchard fruit especially apple, and grape skin. Flavor starts with moderate woody tartness followed by apple cider sweetness, there’s some acid on the finish.

Right here is why Cascade might be my favorite purveyor of wild ales in the states, because they understand a sour is supposed to taste good, it’s not just an arms race to jack the pucker factor into the ionosphere. After having New Glarus’ Wild Peach a few nights ago, I might have had two of the better American wild ales: this is an elite beer, & no doubt about it. Fantastic.","maximum12","Feb 08, 2015"

Although this beer is called a "blonde quad" by the brewers and classified as an American wild ale on BA, it had many of the characteristics found in the finest Flemish oud bruins. This bottle had three years of age on it and drank like a dream. I am curious to see how it is fresh out of the gate.","Damian","Jan 01, 2015"

4.5,5.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"2011 Project. Cork was probably one of the most difficult ones to remove...EVER. Pours a murky, golden color with a hint of amber. Small-medium, white head that takes a little time to go down. Good-looking brew. Scent is very inviting... green apples, bourbon, citrus fruit, barnyard funk, pepper, grass...damn, this beer is all over the place. Smells complex. Taste is just as complex! Initial sip is lightly tart with sour apple flavor and lemon peel. Sour lemon flavors with a balance of sweet bourbon. Lovely spiciness that I can't put my finger on...other than being delicious. A bit boozy, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is a little cloying, but with a dry finish. Seems perfect with this offering. Drinkability is high...especially for such large ABV. Overall, like the other Cascade brews I've had, this one is very complex and delicious. The sweet booziness is definitely present, but the tart fruit, light acidity, and mellow funk make this to be a world-class beer. Have 1 more bottle, definitely going to buy more.","DovaliHops","Beers"

4.14,-2.8,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"this is one heck of a beer, and about the most complex one ive had in the blonde color. thanks to my brother for bringing this one to the table. its a sour blonde quad blended with a couple of other sour golden beers, barrel aged. hazy pale yellow in color with quite a bit of bubbles. the nose does not give its alcohol strength away at all, and it smells of sweet musty wood, souring bacteria, spiced rum, Belgian yeast, honey, and wheat malt. extremely complex layers of flavors, just like aromas, to this west coast gem. it starts quite sweet, with a honey and spice combination, and its immediately followed by a woodiness before sour kicks it into high gear. the combination of sour and sweet in the finish is a little odd, not dry at all, but its certainly enjoyable. the blonde quad is an interesting base beer for something like this, it holds up well to the other ingredients and blends, but also serves to let the barrel shine through in a unique way. some wine vibes on the finish as well. well enough carbonated and rather light in body for what it is. an extremely impressive beer from cascade, who seems to be doing so pretty special stuff. this one will be in my memory for awhile.","StonedTrippin","Dec 14, 2013"

Finish brings just a trace of bourbon with some red cherry skin tartness and a pleasant dryness from the alcohol. Not my favorite from Cascade, but it's pretty delicious.

Aroma was sour/tart, apple cider and stone fruits, hints of Belgian yeast and spice, funk. Sourness was quite tame on the palate, taste was otherwise quite complex: apple, cherry, apricot, lemon, grassy funk, peppery yeast, light acetic acid, white wine, wood, leather, and I almost detected a touch of cinnamon bark in there.

The retention and lacing were minimal. The smell of the beer is obviously sour but also has this subtle sweetness in there too. I kept picking up elements of either the bourbon or honey on the nose. The taste of the beer is tart but it doesn't melt your face off. There is a nice balance of tart and sweet mixing together on this beer. Really interesting stuff! The mouthfeel was well carbonated and light bodied. Overall it's a great beer, and thats coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of sours. Really quite enjoyable.","Knapp85","Jan 23, 2013"

Tart cherries, lemon, oak, vanilla, brown sugar, lots of wonderful aromas waft out of my glass. Taste is tart with a hint of sugary sweetness. Up front I get a hint of brown sugary type sweetness followed by a heaping helping of tartness. Lemons and tart cherries with a hint of acid followed by some vanilla and oak and maybe a hint of ash in the finish.

The taste is oak, cinnamon, some funk, light boubon, some vanilla, and a sharp lactic sourness. The finish has some light alcohol as well as a light astringency. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation.

3.98,-6.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Another beer graciously sent by my East Coast connection, Knifestyles. Thanks Chris! Enjoying this with a plate of Dutch Gouda and crackers. Pours a dull orange color with a large eggshell white head that fell slowly to a nice cap and left some surprisingly nice lacing considering the style. Aroma has a nice citric/acidic punch, followed by some musty basement, bandaid, a bit of hay/herbs, and as touch of sweetness. Taste starts off slightly acidic, tart, with flavors of cherry, grain, lots of apple cider vinegar, some of that bandaid/medicinal-like flavor that I got into the nose, light leather, maybe just a small hint of apricot/peach, mild sweetness, and totally dries out on the semi-sour finish. Not a lot of bourbon from the barrels, but it might be there in light amounts... I have had this one other time, and thought there was more of the lemon/leather/basement flavor associated with Brett, but this go 'round seems to be more on the balanced side with lemon only making a fleeting appearance, and the blonde quad characteristics are coming out much more, which probably gives it that underlying cherry and apple cider flavor. Body is nice, carbonation is good, not too spritzy. Overall, a nice brew. I could definitely go for more citrus/lemon characters from the sourness/Brett, but it's good overall, and and definitely pairs well the Gouda.","KeefD","Apr 28, 2011"

3.73,-12.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The palate opens with a rather pronounced sourness, definitely acetic and lactic in nature, and surprisingly huge in strength. It's immediately followed by a prominent, fruity sweetness with honey, citrus, stone fruit (particularly ripe yellow clingstone peaches), white grapes and a little sugar. All of this is probably from the base tripel. I can't really say I taste much of the quad in here, this mostly tastes like a blend of blondes and tripels. In some way, the sweetness does also have a mild Splenda-like component. Very vinous, this does really make me think of a sweeter white wine. The bourbon character isn't particularly noticeable here, all I do get is a little vanilla. Tart with a clean,lactic sourness and moderate tannins on the finish, there's also some sweetness, rather sugary, that lingers. Still, this is ultimately a very fruity and surprisingly sour beer. Medium-light in body with medium-high carbonation,this does feel quite good on the palate, apart from the sweet fruitiness that's present. Alcohol is reasonably well-hidden, though it does make its presence known by the effect it is having on my sobriety. A very good beer, though I have to say the asking price is a little bit too high.","DefenCorps","Beers"

It didi seem to have underlying apple and pear flavor as well. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet but fruity, oaky, bretty funky, acidic, sour and slight dry finish.

Good lace as the head subsides. The aroma to me first and foremost is tart sour cherries. Some minimal funky notes as well. Light mouthfeel. The warming alcohol in the back end is the first thing that I notice. My second sip yields a more fruitful tone up front with that of cherries but not too overly sweet. The carbonation really bites at the tongue ever so slightly more than I expected. Lemon acidic like as well in the back end mixed with the boozy. It's definitely an odd brew the likes I haven't had before. There's is an odd bitterness/funkiness right in the middle that throws me off a little. Some floral Brett notes in the end linger on.

Taste is tart and light, more tart than sour, some light grape, apricot notes, picked up a bit of vanilla. Dry attentuated mouthfeel, fairly thin. A far different flavor profile from Bourbonic Plaque, not quite as complex a nose and taste, but certainly well in balance and ultra tasty.

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Amber in color with a slight yeasty haze. No head forms from a gentle pour, just a thin white ring circling the rim of the glass, but there's plenty of visible carbonation. The aroma is bold and complex, ranging from musty wood and damp basement to cherries and plums to white pepper and sweet bourbon. Acetic and lactic acid are present in equal quantities, stinging the nostrils slightly. The taste is equally complex, opening with sour cherries, plums and stonefruit, with a touch of caramel-like bourbon flavor buried beneath the fruit. Lactic and acetic acid are at a moderate level, sharp and biting without overwhelming the subtle complexities of the beer. Carbonation is at a high level, helping to offset the full body. The finish is lightly bitter and dry, leaving flavors of pepper and orange peel lingering on the tongue. This is good stuff, but it becomes a bit overwhelming after a few ounces.","largadeer","Jan 10, 2010"
