"Overall: Not bad but not the best of the style that I have had. Its just not as complex as i was expecting, nevertheless, its a good beer and worth seeking out if you have the opportunity to do so."

"O - A wonderful, complex Brett beer that spectacularly balances sour, funk, fruit, wood, and malt flavors. If you go to the brewery, a glass of Pentagram and the smoked mushroom and goat cheese pizza are a diabolical combination."
""
"Flavor + overall: it hits your tongue and then develops for a while.  I don't know why people are putting this at 92 overall, while it's not quite supplication or consecration, it's an amazing beer.  The balance between the barnyard funk and wine barrel is nearly perfect and well-balanced with the alcohol.  I'd drink this every day if I wasn't dropping such a penny on it."
""
"O - This is a nice dark wild ale by Surly. It aged gracefully and I enjoyed drinking it in the middle of winter."

"Buddy brought a bottle to a bottle share. Deep ruby color with a very small  white head. Smokey lightly peppery huge sour aroma. Good amount cherry flavor. Red wine, slight pepper. Very sour. Interesting and good."
""
""
""
"Bottle sent to me as an extra from an overly generous trader. No date on bottle. Thanks!!! Pours dark brown cola color with a one finger, quickly receding khaki colored head. Tart funky Brett aroma, some sour acidity here, light roasted grain, and definite oaky vinous red wine notes. Flavor is oaky berries, cherry, leather, tobacco, very tart, some additional funky barnyard thing, acidic and sour, graham cracker, vinous warmth in the throat. Lighter bodied than I expected, with a super dry finish and low to medium carbonation. This is a pretty good sour brew with nice cherry and tobacco undertones"

"Tasted this not long after tasting a 2014 La Folie.  There was more subtle notes in this beer, but there were fairly similar overall.  The cherry notes are nice on this beer.  Others noted tobacco in the beer as well, but I had just finished a cigar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll admit, the bottle design is what got me to buy the bottle, but I'm glad I did. The sour cherry flavor felt odd at first, but I soon got use to it after the third sip. Overall a good beer, probably something I would pick up for date night."

"O: The super unique flavors make this a hard beer to review because of the brett strain. (this is my second brett beer I've had, so I'm still getting used to the style). It wants to be many things all at once but you can still pick out each individual component. It's a highly drinkable beer and is very satisfying. I highly recommend it if you can find it."
"Pentagram pours a purpleish amber color, with a small lacing head. There is a very sour aroma, lots of wild yeast notes. The taste has some big sour notes, nice dry fruit flavors. Big and huge flavors, good body, nicely carbonated. Overall its a big and powerful sour beer."

"Mouthfeel is very nicely balanced. Mild sweetness and tartness start before moderate carbonation and a sticky sour balance each other nicely. Slightly dry finish."
""
""
"O: Truthfully, one of the first wild ales that I've thoroughly enjoyed. My only discrepancy is the price, which is a bit more than I feel is fair for this beer, but overall, a very, very solid offering from Surly."
""
""
""
""
"Slightly cloudy medium brown color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of tart cherries and lemon with a bit of brown sugar and chocolate at the edges. The flavor is light lactic tart with a healthy dose of funk but still has a bit of residual malty sweetness left to it. The darker malts lend to a slightly chalky mouthfeel, medium body and a moderate level of carbonation. Decent wild ale but nothing horribly exciting."

"Final Thoughts: Was it worth the year long wait in the fridge? I guess it met my expectations. Sour lovers should check it out but don't splurge if its not one of your favorite styles. Would I drink it again? Maybe."

"A nice mellow ""sour"" stout. Nice balance of malt sweetness with brett and wine barrel. Mellow for Surly and it's ok by me."
"Sour stouts/sour ""dark beers"" are quite the challenge. I'm not particularly surprised that Surly was up to the challenge. This is very tasty. It balances the dark notes with the sour notes in a nice way. It's kind of like a dark Flanders Red. That's totally a style, right?"

"Dark, wine barrel, a bit flat, not extremely tart, some vinegar, trace cherry. This is extremely underwhelming and an average wild ale at best. I thought I recalled trying this at a festival and being less than enthused but the high ratings convinced me otherwise."
""
""
"What it is, is rather remarkable and definitely delicious. I have two more bottles that I intend to age even longer. What will it be like at one and a half years? Two? But right now I can't wish for anything better."

"Combine the one dimensional taste with a thin mouthfeel, and this beer becomes a pass. I had high hopes, but really thought this was mediocre at best. Especially at the higher price point."
""
""
"O - Good wild ale overall...nice integration of the wine barrel. The barrel ends up dominating the base beer giving lots of earthy and woody flavors and heavily influences the overall with a big red wine character. Sourness/tartness is held in check a bit - a nice mid-level intensity almost on par with a Flanders Red - which this beer resembles in flavor. Tannic, fruity, reasonably dry overall. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"O-Not my favorite style. Nothing over the top with this beer. A nice change of pace beer. Milder overall compared to Five."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not."
""
"Overall: Pentagram and Five are very similar beers. Pretty good but not one of my favorite styles or flavor profiles. Worth a try if you can find it."
""
"I'm usually not a huge fan of dark sours but this is really an excellent offering. I think the secret here is that the beer is very light bodied, playful and doesn't punch you in the face with alcohol. Its a light sour disguised as its darker cousin. Evil indeed!"
""
"this is a fantastic drinking experience. can't say i've ever had a stout like this, and can't say i'd call this a stout. it's a great wild/sour beer - more leaning towards wine barrel flavors and barnyard than it is sourness... has a nice amount of apple-tart qualities. i know this bottle's a bit expensive, but it's worth trying."
""
"High B"
""
""
"Overall - Too much wine and a little monotonous, but a decent sour."
"O- nice red wine sour; not complex but has more character than most American wild ales do."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really unique brew and is bound to make fans of sour lovers. There is a lot going on in terms of the palate. Super solid over all and definitely worth seeking out."
"D: A very well thought out and crafted brew. Packs a strong punch (taste-wise) for such a light-weight (ABV-wise). Extremely sessionable...dangerously so. Seek it out and enjoy!"

"O: A good sour that really surprised everyone at the tasting. Surly did a good job with this; definitely more sour than funky or barnyard-y. If I loved sours, I would have scored this one even higher...still, tons of respect here; this is a really good beer."

"Overall: Wow. This is excellent. I've not had too many sours (mostly gueuze), but I'm loving the combination of dark, sweet malty flavors with that intense brett funk and sourness. Really really enjoyed this beer. I'm glad I bought a second bottle, which I plan on cellaring for a year or two."

"Poured dark brown, hazy; little to no head. Strong aromas of cherry, funk, and chocolate. Tastes like sweet tabacco, tart cherries, slight roast, also possesses a surprisingly vinous character from the wine barrels - more so than I would have expected."
""
"This is a sour ale!!!! Perfect oaking goes almost unnoticed but its there. Bright citrus notes with sour lactic and acetic notes with brettanomyces funk kicking you in your face!!!Mouthfeel is superior along with mouthwatering happening there is some puckering along with crisp dry finish. Superb crazy price ranges for this shit ive gotten it from 16.99 to 30...sadly first one i got paid 25...great stuff!!!!"

"O - This is a super odd beer. Very similar to a Flanders bruin but with red grapes replacing the dominant cherry notes. I really enjoyed this one, total heartburn though."
""
"Overall I thought this was exceptional. I tasted with my father in law and a friend, neither of whom drink sours. They were really impressed by the complexity, and so was I. I would really like to get another bottle and let it sit in the cellar for a while. Great beer!"

"pours a dark hazy cherry-blackberry color with a small ring of head. smell is funky red wine, strong and heavy on the sour funk. taste is light sour cherries, effervescent white grape juice, red wine and slight vinaigrette. finish is sweet, waxy, and winey."
""
"Overall this is a nice AWA. It is clean and not too intense but has some nice darker fruit notes mixed in with the tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I liked this one a lot. I thought the nose was awesome, just full of sour red wine, cherries, and dark fruits, working in a little bit of brett and some roasty chatacteristics. Taste has more roast and malts, but still nice. Easy to drink, would love to get another bottle of this one."

"This beer pours a dark ruby color with brown tints. The head is half an inch of white foam that recedes quickly into nothing. The aroma is of sour cherries, green apples, and jolly rancher. The taste is has some nice sour and tart notes, but doesn't quite create the pucker factor I usually look for in a sour. It does, however, have a really nice complimentary funkiness that fills in admirably in place of the pucker. In fact, the sour-funky combo give this beer a dimension that I can't recall encounterint before. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry with spritzy carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is another winner from Surly. I only wish I'd have bought more than one bottle when I had the chance."

"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with fruit, acidic, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"my first bottled offering from surly. this had been described to be as just like consecration, so needless to say, I was stoked hard. it pours a similarly cloudy autumn red color with not nearly as much carbonation, and a minimal white head. there is a bunch of super fine suspended yeast in this too. the nose is cherry heavy, with the wine treatment also being quite obvious. it smells sour, but its front of the tongue stuff, not all encompassing as consecration is. the flavor has plenty of oak too it, lots of tart fruit, and a sour profile that's true to the nose. its piquant and acidic, maybe a little too much so really, at least if it wants to be more drinkable. all the components are present, but the unity is whats missing in my opinion. the acid detracts the mouthfeel after a glass or so, my teeth start to dry out and hurt, and my tongue feels like ive been hammering sour patch kids. its actually really good, and an impressive first (I think?) sour beer from surly. contrary to popular opinion though, this does not stand up ton consecration at all. better carbonation than it shows, and the body is only medium. very long finish despite its drying effects, a funny but enjoyable peculiarity. overall a worthy beer, and a treat to try, but I would not buy this with a consecration on the shelf."

"This poured out as a deep burgundy color with a tannish hire head on top. The head settled leaving a soap ring around the edge of the glass. Light lacing as well. The smell is big with sour notes and wine barrel aging. It's also got a nice sweet aroma, slight cherry-like aromas on the nose. The taste isn't as sour as I thought it might be. The beer has a subtle tart flavor with some cherry or grape flavors. There is some earthy tobacco and malt. The mouthfeel is smooth, moderate carbonation and medium bodied. Overall it's a very drinkable brew, glad I got to try it."

""
"O: This is a GREAT sour ale, wished I had another bottle so I'll put some time on it to see how it turns out. This is definitely going into my ISO list."
""
""

"O/D-A neat sour. Not a stunner but its quite interesting. One of those beers that seemingly brings a new flavor with every sip."
""
""
""
"I wish it had a bit more bubbles, but overall this was quite nice and very flavorful. I think this is easily my favorite sour beer yet from Surly!"

"O - Tart and funky, but not overpowering like some other sours."
""
""
""
""

"A good beer, I feel it will be best with about three-six years on it. It needs a while to develop. Heat is not apparent and is nicely blended. Recommended. I hope to re-review with better news. I loved FIVE."

"I tend to really love Surly's sours and this is no exception. This would be a regularly purchase if I could."
""
""
""
"A solid beer but for a $20 beer, I was a bit letdown. Better than Five but I know I am in the minority and thinks Surly should scrap their sour program. They have a long ways to go to rival the great American sour breweries. Awesome bottle art however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A very good take on a American Wild ale. Lively and well balanced wine barrel and malt flavors. It will be interesting to see how this evolves."

"O: This is an awesome sour! I can't get enough of it. Pentagram has everything I look for in this style of brew. Drinkability is superb, and I can't wait to see how it turns out with some age!"

"Pours from a wax-sealed 750mL bottle cola brown with a very transient dark foam head. Quite effervescent, after 15 seconds the head is completely gone but for a thin rim around the glass. So it's not much in appearance, although the bottle is hellishly cool looking. Pervasive smell is of a high quality red wine vinegar, perhaps a hint of Worcestershire sweetness, balsamic, oak and tart cherries. Certainly it smells good, like something I'd want to use for cooking a fine roast shoulder in a reduction with mushrooms and rosemary. Now the taste is immediately far less pungent than the nose suggests, which is a bit disappointing. It's pretty zippy, high carbonation and quite watery on the palate. Back to the taste..it's lightly tart cherries washed with a weak solution of Heinz white vinegar, there is some sense of balsamic sweetness as well. So sweet and sour, medium dry, again watery, and strong carbonation, all sitting on a sort of thinnish brown ale like underpinning. Well then. 6.66% ABV"
""
"I am not a big sour fan at all, but I really like this one. The funk and tartness are more approachable for the style, but the come itty of the flavor is what grabs my attention. If not for the price tag, I would buy up another couple of these. Well done overall for the style though."
""
""
""
"Very nice wild."
"edit: I've noticed some variation in sourness from bottle to bottle. The stuff I had on tap wasn't as tart as the first bottle I reviewed."
""
"Can't wait for the bottle release. This stuff is solid."
