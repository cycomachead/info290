4.26,-1.8,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Corked and caged 750 ml bottle from Tipples. Pours deep reddish orange color with a nice fluffy off white head. Aroma is muted with some metallic and cardboard notes, oak, some light sour funk, sweet fruit and a vinous presence. Flavor follows as a beautiful combination of sweet fruit, red wine, sour lacto, dry oak. Wow this is really nice. No sign of the whiskey here, but I am OK with that. The wine barrel and sour notes really take over. Medium heavy body, medium plus carbonation. Really nice beer overall.","BMMillsy","Thursday at 05:56 PM"

3.53,-18.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear amber brown with hints of pink.  Bubbly light tan head that faded fairly quickly into a medium collar.  Pretty good lacing and decent legs.  Aroma is tart dark cherry, cranberry and black raspberry; behind that there's some earthy woodiness.  When I swirl the glass, the vinous woodiness really comes alive.  Taste follows aroma with some wine barrel resin.  Little bit of funk but the brett is majorly covered up by the sour lacto at this point in the aging process. Taste is also extremely tart and reminds me of a very sour jolly rancher.  Very fruity, but quite sour.  Medium carbonation and body.","mverity","Mar 02, 2015"

4.28,-1.4,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"The pour itself gets aromas flowing quickly to my nose and getting my taste buds watering.  Pours to a murky honey brown tone of swamp water of a body.  Head is a biscuity golden brown that fades to a skim quickly.  No lace is left behind.  nose is fruit resin sweetness mixed with dusty tartness that dances well together.  Wow is all my brain can get out as I take first sip.  A wonderfully brutal attack of sour quickly takes over the tongue.  Astringent and full sour feel swarms the mouth with each sip.  You get lemon peel and high quality boutique vinegar in the flavor along with a dry dusting of sour candy coating.  This is a truely sour beer and not for the faint at heart.  Mouthfeel is a real pucker up.","SPLITGRIN","Mar 01, 2015"

Smell: flanders red + more... oaky with some soft melon and caramel in the back, overlaid with cherry, overripe stone fruit, grapeskin. Hints of acetic brett and cued whiskey. Taste: raspberry, lime, tart grapes, lactic!; then into peach skin, woody and herbal; apple cider vinegar and a tiny bit of goat cheese in the finish and a residual booze feeling left on the lips. This is very good, but I'd like to see the funk meter and sour meter swap values.","babaracas","Dec 22, 2014"

The flavor is simple as well but mixes the vanilla of the barrel and tart cherry to create a great tasting ale. There are tones of cocoa butter, with creaminess, and a move towards a Flemish Sour as you continue to drink. Not too tart or sour this is easy and flavorful.","KYGunner","Nov 14, 2014"

I love the blending of old and new beers, the complexities that Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus add to the flavor and of course the subtle smoothness that only barrel-aging can accomplish.

Given that, I was expecting more from Love Child No. 4.  Not as complex as many other sours, and I’m really predominately getting sour with some barrel quality.  It could have so much more depth and character.  However, it’s a great sour sipper.  Will give it 8.5 out of 10.

I'm definitely biased toward beer, but I would take a bottle of this Kansas City beer over Dom Perignon any day (bearing in mind I've only tried the '96). Expect cherries with hints of honey and oak delivered with the cleanest mouthfeel this style has to offer. An excellent beer to share with friends, but I'd rather keep every drop for myself.","Fuzzycuffs","Aug 12, 2014"

The beer itself is a clear grapefruit red with some light brown notes. The beer smell has strong sour acidic funk notes. The funk is pretty strong and dominates most of the notes but some other notes consist of oak and light fruit with cinnamon. The beer taste is similar to the smell. The taste is very interesting. The beer starts off with the strong acidic taste but transitions to a much sweeter and sugary taste. The taste has the same cinnamon notes and fruit notes that accompany that acidic taste. The oak is not as noticeable in the taste but does have a slight presence as well as a hint of whiskey. Additionally, the fruitiness from the red wine barrel also comes out well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side with a lot of carbonation and goes down smooth. Overall, one of the better and lighter wild ales that I've had.","HattedClassic","Jul 18, 2014"

If you like sours this is a must try I recommend one or two since there not cheap. I am grateful for nabbing one but I do believe I will try and get one to age some.","Nikkii","Jul 16, 2014"

Body is full and very tangy. Taste is very sour, funky, tart, fruity. Finish is long and sour. There should be a note on the label to put syrup in.","mikeg67","Jul 16, 2014"
