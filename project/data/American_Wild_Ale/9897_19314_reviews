"Bottled 1/16/15. Very much in the style of a Flanders Red. All around very tasty, with a good balance between sour and sweet, but a bit undercarbed for me. I'd happily drink this anytime I'm in the mood for a sour, but, given the choice, I'd probably pick up a Rodenbach Grand Cru before this since I could get twice as much for the same price."
"Deep brown in color with good clarity and a light amount of carbonation bubbles.  A fingernail of off white foam covers the rim and only a trace is otherwise present.  Light Brussels lacing.  The nose is packed with oak, hazlenut, and a trace of Brett.  I taste a very nice blend of tart Brett and earthy oak.  The mouth is fairly carbonated and dry."
""
"Smell: 1st  wiff sour like vinegar hints whiskey and oak. Taste: very tangy and sour pucker. Reminds me of a Belgium cherry ale. Very different and may require an acquired taste."
""
"It is very sharp & tart when it first hits your tongue, then gives way to a dry chardonnay flavor piqued with sour fruit.  It finishes with a pretty strong lactic acid hit, though, similar to Duchess, which is not my personal style.  I like my sours to be more tart & less vinegary."

"For a sour beer, this is just right in its sourness.  Suggested, even for those who don't drink beer much."

"Overall an ok wild, but feels more like a summer quencher quick thrower, than a malty classic oak wonder."
"O: I like it. The sourness is there, but not mouth puckering; it isn't like vinegar either. The oak flavor is apparent and adds a nice touch to this brew."

"375 ml bottle.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a dark amber color with about a half inch off-white head.  The head didn't stay around for too long, but there's a good amount of lacing.  I liked the aroma, the brew smells like tart cherries, caramel, green grapes, oak and vinegar.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some berries, plum and vanilla that I notice.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has a good amount of carbonation.  Surprisingly this is the first time I've tried this.  I've seen it around for a long time, but for whatever reason I never picked up a bottle until recently.  It's definitely worth trying, I thought it was good.  $7.99 a bottle."

"O: I was incredibly excited to try this beer based on the rating and my love of Wild Ales but this was a let down, especially after the smell. This was easy to drink in the sense that it literally goes down like water but I wouldn't recommend anyone rush out to get this beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/8/2013. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cranberry, lemon zest, green apple, plum, raisin, red grape, caramel, leather, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon zest, plum, raisin, red grape, caramel, leather, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, lemon zest, plum, raisin, red grape, caramel, leather, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of tart/fruity/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately slick/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome sour red ale. All around great complexity and balance of tart/fruity/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O. An outstanding example of a Flanders, or sour ales in general. Belgium needs to take note. this is my favorite Jolly Pumpkin, mostly because it is widely available, very consistent, and solidly delicious. This is defiantly a session able ale. I highly recommend this beer and this is where I point someone who is new to sours."

"Hazy amber color. Thin white head which disappears very quickly.  Smells of oak spice and sour fruit. Taste is nicely sour, oak, slight spice.  Almost watered down which was dissapointing.  Nice effervescence,  Bright mouthfeel.  Overall not my favorite jolly pumpkin offering, not bad but pretty one dimensional for me."
""
"Pours a nice reddish amber.  Nice aromas of tart sour cherries.  Not overly sour taste of cherries, lambic and red wine.  Mouthfeel tart but a bit watery.   I do wish it the beer was slightly more bold, but thats a minor complaint. Overall a very good flanders.  There are better out there but this one did not disappoint."

"Hazy brownish amber color with fine lacing. A good take on a Flanders red that is well executed but not quite as good as a Rodenbach Grand Cru. Aromas and flavors include apple cider, lemon rind, oak and vinegar. I like how it's fairly sour but not too vinegary. It's also fairly sweet. Slightly oxidized. The fine prickly carb maintains a crisp mouthfeel despite the slightly oily texture. Straightforward and enjoyable."

"O/D - This was good. A nice Flanders Red with good flavours and some complexity. Not boozy and fairly tasty. They flavour was subdued compared to other examples of the style, but for the most part this was enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Like many Jolly Pumpkin beers I've had - solid flavors while being somewhat lowkey, but kinda safe/unremarkable in the category of funky saisons/wild ales. That being said, it's still quite enjoyable, I especially liked the Flanders-esque elements in this one."
""
""
""
""
"One of the few sour red ales that don't get overly acetic; I am particularly a fan of the apricot heavy brett character this beer showcases. Jolly Pumpkin does a fabulous job of balancing the sourness with a smooth malt backbone, as a sour red should. Want a fantastic, year round sour red ale? Look no further."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a solid example of a American Wild Ale, it had just enough tartness to that is a little sour and it wasn't as acidic as some Wild Ales can beer so I thought the balance was pretty nice. This beer beer had very nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, not too acidic, a little refreshing, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, this is a nice beer to split, but I would have no problem drinking a whole bottle to myself and I think it would make for a good beer to enjoy when it's warmer outside. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, the balance, and the drinkability, those three things are what made this beer as good as it. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I could think that could improve this beer, but I wouldn't mind if it was a couple dollars cheaper. I would for sure buy this beer again and I would like to get a bottle to put in the cellar so I can see how it changes over time and I would recommend this to anyone who likes American Wild Ales and beers that are on the funky and tart side, it might even make for a good beer to introduce someone to the style. All in all I enjoyed this beer, that wasn't always the case, but now that I've got a taste for these types of beers I am really starting to appreciate how good and unique Jolly Pumpkin is. It's not my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer or American Wild Ale, but it's far away from being my least favorite. Good job guys, keep doing your thing Jolly Pumpkin."

"another great sour from jolly pumpkin!"
"O: Underwhelmed, neither fruity nor complex sour. The more I drink the more tannin I taste, as I finished the bottle I was left with the sense of a over-oaked flanders. It's not bad by any means, but I would recommend others in the same genre far earlier."

"Pours a hazy copper with amber edges, one finger thick cream colored head; rings of lace down the glass. Smell: tart stone fruit, raspberry, lots of oak character, big caramel hit buried beneath. Taste: tart stone fruit, tart berry, caramel apple, baking spices, oaky. Perfect blend of sugars, creamy carb, acid, barrel heavy finish. Impressive! 9/13 bottling."

"Overall an OK beer but nothing extraordinary. TIhis is classified as an American wild but I'm pretty sure they were going for a Flanders red here. Falls well short of the classics in the style."
""
"Atmosphere is really great. Brown ruby hue, slight head, remaining carbonation, and persistent distinct lacing. Nose is woody and floral with fruit notes, most notably raspberry. Bitter fruit, yeasty, and earthy. Sour with little sweet balance and a biting finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Ok, I'm not trying to say I'm an expert, but many of you need to reevaluate your scoring. All I read about this beer is that it's mediocre, underwhelming, so-so... But you all still manage to give it a 4. 3 is OKAY, so do the math... 4 means it's good. It is ok, not the best, but... Just judge accordingly."

"O/D-I wasn't very enamored with this one. I would revisit it again though and maybe rejudge."
"The nose has a ton of sour cherries, oak, caramel, earthy notes, vanilla, bourbon, tart grapes and just a bit of spice (cinnamon?). The taste is really strong on the bourbon and oak flavors which are immediately followed by mildly sour cherries, some grape notes, some earthy notes, a bit of citrus and a nice, dry finish. It has a full body for the style (lended to it by the oak, I think) with a medium amount of carbonation and a clean, dry finish. Just the right balance of body and tartness. Pretty awesome. My favorite Jolly Pumpkin so far."
""
"As I crack the cork, this beer is a gusher. Like a geyser, this liquid is out of the bottle, and I see some of my well bought booze ooze onto the table. The geyser was quickly stopped after the first pour, but I would like to warn others to its gushing potential. The beer pours a deep, caramelized, burgundy color with very light orange hints. It pours with a fair head of medium sized, lightly yellowing bubbles that fizzle down to about a quarter of a finger’s width. In the light the beer is like a ruby red grapefruit color, with a dark, opaque body that seems a bit murky, but does show some nice, lazy bubbles running to the head. The head leaves a light lacing of spatter marks on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of a tart, earthy must. As the scent lingers in the nostrils I get more distinct notes of cherry and leather, much akin to a Flanders red, but subtler. A creamy, scentless sense seems to dominate the nose, which is a little bewildering to me. Even subtler than the funk is soft vanilla and oak. As the beer breathes, distinct lactic scents travel up from the glass to give the feel of a subtle Flanders red. This smells good but I want more of it! On the tongue, the beer tastes a bit like a muddled mess. Almost middling tart acidity moves bad funk notes with an odd, light bitterness that moves into smooth tannic bitterness, while a light, earthy salinity touches over the tongue. The sweet, caramelly malt in the background is nice but a bit watery, leaving the beer without the balance of the great Flanders reds. In flavor, the beer begins as tart, green apple with a bit of basement must. The must grows to an unpleasant funk with plastic and medicinal notes to it. Within the must there are intriguing hints of grass, hay, and loamy dirt, but these get caught up and jumbled into an odd sweetness, falling into a less desirable flavors. The finish is of a rotting forest floor with musty leaves intertwining with decay and soft caramel notes, and the aftertaste is nice tannic oak with vanilla and very faint, light roast coffee. This beer has a lot of potential, but just does not seem to pull its parts together. In the mouth the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a thin, lightly-watery mouthfeel that doesn’t fit the style well. Carbonation is soft and smooth, and actually quite nice, though surprising given my bottles gushing opening. The mouth is left fairly clean accept for light acid-canceling saliva. Overall, this beer is a bit of a letdown. It has subtlety and grace in the nose, but it muddles everything in the taste and never quite weaves them together. I wonder if a bit more time in the bottle might have aided the beer along. The beer does get better as you drink it, and does have some interesting points for a seasoned sour/wild/etc… drinker, but is definitely not a beginner’s beer. The more I drink of it the more I note a definite oaky tannin to the taste, which I actually deeply appreciate but it doesn’t seem to work with the rest of the beer. I’m happy I tried it, and I hope it gets better in future batches, or perhaps with age, but for the time being I would say it is not good enough for its price point."

"O - Hard to really judge this brew as my only take is 2 years old and IMO slightly past it's prime. Then again I was lead to believe this was ""cellared"" at a distributors and/or importer's warehouse -- probably not under ideal conditions. Not a bad beer by Ny means but I won't be going back to the shop for seconds."
""
""
"Overall, great flavors make this a really enjoyable experience. Not the most sour of sours, and a bit of a let down on the barrel character, but over still a very nice beer that I'd be happy to enjoy again."

"O: I was disappointed in this beer. Compared to the wild ales produced by Crooked Stave, RR, Cascade, etc this one falls short. It's much too tart fruit forward without any real oak or lacto to balance it out. I've heard from my friends that previous batches of this beer were outstanding, but Batch 8 just reminds me of a tart, balsamic vinegar bomb. A decent wild ale - wish it were cheaper."

"Overall (4/5): Jolly Pumpkin's La Roja certainly is a good beer, but it's a tad expensive for what you're getting. A Belgian import like Rodenbach Grand Cru is a better value. If you prefer your Flanders Red Ales very sour like I do, La Roja isn't exactly the ticket for a sourness-fix. It has complexity for sure, but if you expected a puckering palate walloping, this is not the beer that'll do it for you. La Roja is an easy-going Flanders Red."

"O: a finely crafted beer with loads of flavor without being overly sour."

"nice and tart, medium body, mild carbonation. this is an awesome example of an american sour ale. wasn't sure if i'd be a fan of all the barrel aged flavors in this but they worked out perfectly. looking forward to throwing the yeast dregs into my homebrew and seeing what happens."

"Mouthfeel is good- medium body with moderate carbonation. Again, tart is the name of the game. If you're not disk with that, don't get this beer. If you are into the funk, buy it but not if you're in a region where it's 14 bucks a bottle. Unless you're bored and have money to burn."
"overall- a very good beer. i have been wanting to try it and i am glad i did. at the price (~$12)it is i think its worth a try and on some occasions but not all the time. my third try at jolly pumpkin and my favorite by far (bam biere and bam noire)"
"Overall, a disappointing, thin, astringent and bitter sour. At $12 for the bottle, one of the worst values in beer I have come across."
"Medium to slightly light bodied, medium carbonation. Some liveliness on the palate. In the end this was a perfectly acceptable riff on a Flanders brown/biere de garde crossover but its hard to say much more; not particularly exceptional, but priced as if it were, at least on the easy coast."

"O: Great take on a flanders red in my opinion. Not as fruity as other more well known but more on the dryer side. Still a great beer and will continue to buy when ever i see it at the store, got this one at whole foods two months ago. Very complex yet simple beer to drink and savor. Not as sour as expected but might improve with age, I just could not wait."

"a pretty decent wild, a bit one dimensional at times, but easily enjoyable. the sourness of this beer is about is about right in the middle when compared all the other wilds ive had in the past. leaves me even more interested to try the la roja- grand resevera."
"Attractive ruby-brown semi-hazy brew. Head is rosy tan and initially large. It fades to a ring leaving little bits of lace straggling behind. Aroma is fun to take in. Maraschino cherries, green apple, rum, butterscotch, toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, spice, and something tart....Jolly Ranchers come to mind though its been along time since I've had any. Taste is crisp, clean, sour, tangy, fruity...fermented fruity...and enjoyably bitter. Definitely some nutty stuff going on here in an intriguing and mouthwatering way. There's something reminiscent of stinky armpits in this...not to be taken negatively. Earthy and rooty flavors perhaps... Rooibos? The sourness of this grows on you as you get further in. Texture is lightweight and delicate. Grape-like dry, finely gritty, slick throughout, and generally lip smacking. Medium body with soft carbonation. I am enjoying this. A welcome change of pace."

"O: Simply stated... I really enjoyed this one. I loved GI 3 Sisters and I find this one similar as far as quality. La Roja lacks the really intense fruit characters like GI, but it makes up for it by adding in a nice caramel sweetness creating a uniqueness of its own. In addition, the barrel aging is evident further expanding its complexity. My first offering by Jolly Pumpkin and I must admit, a strong first impression"

"O: A decent Flemish red, kind of disappointed for the price. The body is lacking a bit. It almost seemed a bit watered down. Surprising especially because it clocks in at 7% abv. The sourness and malt are nicely balanced. It is an easy drinker and an accessible sour."

"Overall: my first Jolly Pumpkin beer, and I am not at all disappointed. I think it is balanced and quite delightful."

"There's just enough carbonation to keep this beer going, but a consistent crispness and a well-rounded smoothness help to make this beer pleasing all around."
"O: Overall a pretty good sour. Reminds me a lot of RR Supplication, albeit much more mild. Great tasting easy drinking sour."

""
""

"O:  Super fruity and dry with a great yeast funk.  Great fruit flavors and a subtle caramel sweetness that compliments the tart and provides a smooth drinker.  Another great offering from Jolly Pumpkin that I will surely purchase again. "

"O - Another solid offering from Jolly Pumpkin. Has a nice tartness that doesn't overpower. I liked how well the oak and mustiness were incorporated with it and balanced with the tart."

"Overall this is a very good American brewed Flander's style ale. Second only to La Folie. Nice depth in character, which I expect from the style. Approachable for those new to sours. I think about a year in the cellar will help this, and add even further depth and a bit more tartness for us sour fiends. Recommended to any fan of the style or one looking to get into sours. Cheers!"

"Overall: For the price, a beer of this quality done in the Flanders style (more oud bruin than Flanders red in my opinion) is a steal. And let's face it, there aren't that many out there. Absolutely worth trying."

"Rousing the yeast softens the acidity but paradoxically, increases the burn in the back of my throat. The yeast also enhances the structure of the nose, bringing the leather more to the forefront."

"Overall: I really enjoy this jolly pumpkin beer. I should really consider more of there beers on a regular basis. Little pricey, but worth it."
"O: I love this sour. Beautifully rounded and dangerously drinkable with sour notes of apple and cherry skins, over a lightly sweet backbone and a touch of red vinegar... So derrricious."
""

""

"o- this is my first american wild ale. and it's also my first jolly pumpkin beer. i enjoyed it very much. i don't think it's much of a sipper as some note, as it's super drinkable and delicious. i would buy again."
"O - a nice beer. Wish it was a bit more ""wild."" But it's still good. And it's young. Perhaps it'd get weirder as it got older."
"I've never been a huge fan of incredibly sour treats and beers, but this beer does a good job of being somewhere in between. The caramel and touch of hops meet the sour fruitiness and a solid beer is the result. Definitely give it a try if you are trying to get into sour beers/wild ales as this one will have a fighting chance of not turning you off of them."

"blend 6, bottled on 3/2/2012. really really good stuff here. pours the color of the label, pale brick red with a paly syrup color undertone, some suspended yeast sediment that eventually settles to the bottom of the glass. small off white head, minimal retention, but some runners like a good red wine as it sips. smells like a brett sour, lots of tiny piquant dancers in my nose. amber malts backing it up, but way back. flavor is similar, big oaky sour vibes assault you every sip, starting on the front of the tongue and eventually dominating the entire palate. some nice complex medium amber malts happening, dusty and bouncing off the sour notes really well. feel is solid, effervescent carbonation and a whole lot of spunk. medium mody makes it rather drinkable and the abv could be anything, not noticeable at all. overall a great beer, my favorite jolly pumpkin so far."
"O- all things expected, this was a letdown. This has been in my possession for awhile, and I cellared it fine....not sure what the conditions were like before me, but I assume sitting on a store shelf collecting dust. Not sure if this was an infected batch or what, but I am horribly let down"
""
""

"Overall: This is a very good sour beer that is not over the top, but still complex, tasty, and drinkable."

"Attractive ruby-brown semi-hazy brew. Head is rosy tan and initially large. It fades to a ring leaving little bits of lace straggling behind. Aroma is fun to take in. Maraschino cherries, green apple, rum, butterscotch, toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, spice, and something tart....Jolly Ranchers come to mind though its been along time since I've had any. Taste is crisp, clean, sour, tangy, fruity...fermented fruity...and enjoyably bitter. Definitely some nutty stuff going on here in an intriguing and mouthwatering way. There's something reminiscent of stinky armpits in this...not to be taken negatively. Earthy and rooty flavors perhaps... Rooibos? The sourness of this grows on you as you get further in. Texture is lightweight and delicate. Grape-like dry, finely gritty, slick throughout, and generally lip smacking. Medium body with soft carbonation. I am enjoying this. A welcome change of pace."
"Murky reddish-brown color under a bubbly beige collar of a head. Acidic, woody cherry aroma. Earthy spice, wild yeast, caramel apples, and vinegar. First sip: solid fruity tartness upfront...sour, spicy cherries and berries, and some phenols lingering in the back. Less acidic than the aroma. Dry and pretty crisp; sweet, but not too sweet. The spiced, wooden earthiness continues through to the flavor and works well with the fruit. This is tasty stuff. I dig the sourness, though the astringency is a bit much in the nose and detracts from the more pleasant aromas. All around though, a fairly smooth, lip-smacking, tart experience and one that I will likely have again at some point."
""
"Wood is upfront and works well with the cherry tartness. Nice balance of lactos. Great rustic aroma. The first beer I've had from Jolly Pumpkin and won't be my last."
"Impressive wild ale with charisma plus. Complex but well contained. Close to a kriek stylistically but with a little more yeast and malt action."
""
""
"a great beer. the perfect intermediate beer if you're trying to get someone who doesn't necessarily like sours into sours. theres two reasons i say this. first, the sour upfront punch is countered by JP's incredible balancing of this initial sour with a pleasant sweet ending. the mouthfeel is near perfect. i often feel that JP gets their mouthfeel off, it always feels a bit too thin but this one is rich and silky at the same time... a real treat. not much hops presence, a bit in the middle of the taste, it's a more citrusy taste than an oily resiny one, which fits well for the style. worth seeking out if you're into the sours."
""
"O - I can see this being one of those beers that you give to someone who’s not that into beer and they say, “This can’t be beer...I actually like this!” It definitely is a nice representation of the style with both sweet fruity notes and sour acidic notes. Not my favorite because it smells and tastes too much like wine for my taste, but still a nice offering from JP."
""
"O-very good sour. Not to intense but just enough sour flavor. Great brew."
""
"The caramel malt is more earthy than anything else. However, the complexity already inherent in this beer makes it a wonderful drink."
"O: I really enjoy this beer and it pairs so well with pork. I really like the tartness and the light sourness, making this beer very enjoyable to drink and certainly one that I could enjoy multiple glasses over a meal. I need to pick some more of this one up at some point soon."
""
"The flavor was acidic, tart, and very refreshing without being sour in an overpowering way. Medium body. At mid-palate, I get some of the contributions from the oak-aging, but it's kept in-check by the tart character of the beer. The beer claims to be ``brewed in the Flanders tradition'', but it lacks the accompanying, balancing sweetness of, say, a Rodenbach. Still, whether this beer is an American Wild Ale or a Flemish Red Ale, it is a nice example of one of the most refreshing styles of beer one can find. I am overjoyed that American brewers are not afraid to produce beers in the Belgian tradition. If you like sours, don't pass this one up."
""
"Bottle with dinner at Blue Tractor restaurant in Ann Arbor. This one starts off a little funky, but really just gets better as you go along. Pours a deep beautiful red color with creamy off white head. A great aroma of cherries, vinegar, sweet fruits. Flavor follows with mostly big cherry notes, heavy sweetness, and a funky tart unlike most other sour beers I have encountered. Another unique beer from Jolly Pumpkin. One of their more complex brews, true to the sour roots."
"D - This one is a mixed bag... Excellent aroma and appearance... The taste and the mouthfeel are a bit sub par... I have a love hate relationship with Jolly Pumpkin... I keep trying their offerings to find something that rivals the wonderfulness of Oro De Calabaza and most, like this one, leave me greatly disappointing..."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle with sticker ""Blend 2, Bottles 1/29/2012"" to a Duvel tulip the beer pours a deep rich amber color with a decent 1 finger white head, some retention but not much, not much lacing. Like so many of these wild ales, it almost appears flat. The aroma is a blend of a sour tart cherry with hints of oak, vanilla, and vinegar. Lightly fruity. The flavor is much the same with an initial taste of the sour tart cherry from which a grape fruit character builds, vinegar flavors, hints of oak, vanilla. Mild bitterness, no hint of alcohol. Very pleasing. Finishes a bit dry with a lingering sour cherry on the tongue. Overall, very enjoyable."
""
"This is a fantastic Belgian Red Ale. I wish I tried it sooner. Seek this out."
""
"D ~ A good Wild! Easy drinking. Heat would probably diminish with age. Check it out!"
"It's got interesting characteristics from the wood maturation."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid and easy to drink sour. Fruits flavors are definitely “red” and refreshing. I’ve never had this fresh but it certainly is drinking well with a little bit of time in the cellar."
""
""
""
"Almost shiny reddish-orange in color with an airy tan head that disappears quickly. Smells of light sour fruits among some plums and cherries. Caramel, beer bread and taffy are noticed along with a bit of musk. Taste is almost as complex as the aroma with more sour and tangy fruits, orange peel, a vinegar afterthought and a distant oakiness. Slightly puckering, but not overkill. Goes down dry with a medium body. Wild ales haven't always been my thing, but this one works well on many levels."
"Love the dark fruit and slight sour funk interplay. On par with the good fruity funky wild ales."
""
"For a beer this young, it is amazing how smooth it is. I'll definitely be stocking up on more of these next time I'm in Michigan."
""
""
"A well crafted beer but for me, not overly impressive. It was well rounded, tamed, and easy to drink which make it perfect for an intro to the style. I wanted a bit more ""umph"" in the flavour department but I still found it enjoyable nonetheless."
""
"O: A very nicely balanced American sour. Very drinkable without sacrificing that nice flash of puckering sour fruit. The malt profile could be better expressed, but otherwise delicious."
"Notes: It felt a bit too oaky. There is a tad more astringency than I'd normally like, but this is a minor quibble. The whole back end of this beer is dominated by oak and barrel though. I would have preferred to see a more subtle integration. A slightly more skillful blend would probably yield better results."
""
"This is a phenomenal Aged Amber Ale. Certainly in my top favorites."
""
""
""
"Beautiful amber color and clear, despite bottle conditioning. Very short lived head and no lace. Sour fruit and sweet caramel aroma with the sour fruit predominating. Medium to light body Carbonation is perfect, lively, but not overwhelming. Lots of sour fruit and a medium amount of oak, but with enough sweetness counterbalance all this. Bitter finish."
""
"A fine representation of the style with a few unique characteristics. This is the first, out of four or five, Jolly Pumpkin beer that I've had that I've been completely sold on."
""
""
"Overall, decent sour with some good flavors that could be slightly amplified just a bit. However, I like this representation and would recommend this to someone interested in getting into sours."
""
"The flavor, much like the aroma hints at, is very tart and refreshingly mouthwatering. Bright fizzy carbonation injects flavors of red wine vinegar, citric and lactic acids, Maraschino cherries, pomegranate, woody oak, and musty barnyard funk. The finish is just slightly bitter, with lingering tannins. This beer has a lot going on!"
"I poured from a bomber into my Cigar City tasting snifter. Upon opening it was a bit of a gusher, brownish purple in color with a medium white head, light lacing. The arom is tart, sour fruit, light oak. The flavor is moderate green apple, pears, definitely tart, lingering tart finish. The body is light, good carbonation. This is an nice, easier drinking sour."
""
""
""
"Smooth light body with soft carbonation. Nice lingering flavors. This one has a really nice balance. Good tart flavors with a nice sweet finish. Really enjoyable as most Jolly Pumpkin beers are."
""
""
""
"O – I am really glad I have another bottle of this…might give this next bottle some age and see how it tastes after 6 months or so."
""
"O-First wild ale I have had so I am still getting familiar with the style, but I think it has just about everything it should. Its unique and complex, I would be interested in seeing how it would age."
""
""
"Overall: A nice, sweet-sour wild ale from JP."
""
"o - Overall a nice beer. Not my favorite JP beer, but seems to have held up well. Some light sour fruits and that JP beer, would have it again."
""
""
"Blend 19, bottled 10-28-11. Poured from a 750 ml into a chalice. Once popped, my nose was greeted with a rush of foam... Rocket. Once that subsided I get to proceed. Rich amber in color with not much head. Taste is tart. Mild raspberry and white vinegar. Kinda like a watered down oude tart. Decent, but way overpriced."
"Pours an amber-brown with a thin off-white head that falls fairly quickly and leaves a thin collar. The nose brings a bit of light lactic acid and some cherry. A bit of cherry pit and mild oak. The flavor really pushes on from there with some nice lactic presence as well as cherry and cherry pit. Oak is good. Really nice. Mouthfeel is crisp and acidic with a dry finish. Impressive. Another winner from JP."
""
"One of my favorite brews. Described as an American Wild, but I would go as far as to call it a Flanders Red. Reddish copper in appearance, thin head that dissipates but leaves lacing. Smells like only Jolly Pumpkin beers can smell. A funky mixture of citrusy, vinegary, barnyard 'off flavors', oak, lactic acid, and flavors undistinguishable. Yeeeeah. Taste follows the nose, the malt and the hops are not the star of this show. Moderate carbonation, maybe a little bit more than moderate, gives a nice tingly feeling. Very vinegary. Fantastic beer."
""
"Cheers LampertLand"
"Taste is lightly tart citric juiciness, vinegar hint, sour fermented plums, wet wine-soaked wood with wood, toasted barley, and bitter leaves in the finish. It has funky winey, juicy, yeasty elements, bread crust, leaves, plus sweetness, tartness, and bitterness all well balanced. It has very good character, well rounded complexity and breadth and is very drinkable. However, it lacks depth and seems a bit thin and light as if all the character is on the edge of evaporating into nothingness."
"I would compare this beer to an ommegang zuur."
"Theres a good bit oak barrel to be found. Sour cherries, tart green apples, and sour grapes. Very light body, and very drinkable. The noticeable absent is the Brett funk that I seem to found a touch of in the nose, but I actually like its absence."

"Re-review notes 1/2/12 - la Roja was one of the first wild ales that tried and I loved it. I still think it is a quality brew, I just like different things in this style now. It's Tart, but does not have the lactic bite that I strive for. I readjusted my ratings based on what I felt after I recently tried nit. Still a great soured brown, and I'd like to see what this beast taste like with some age on it. I still think everybody should start with this beer if dabbling in the style, as it is a great example of what is to come when drinking further 'wild/sours'."
"O: a fantastic American wild ale. Can't believe I didn't try out JP's offerings before this. Will definitely check out more and will revisit this one again when I'm yearning for a sour ale that's both available and somewhat affordable."
""
"O/D- A good wild ale for someone who hasn't had a lot of exposure (ie me). Sourness is mild but present, not overwhelming. A good introduction to both Jolly Pumpkin and the style."
"D/O- Tartness could be upped a tad and would make for a better overall beer. As is, an enjoyable wild that fails to make it to the upper echelon."

"O: Easy drinking sour. Sour lactic/vinegar notes are excellent mingled with tropical and citrus fruits and a light graininess."

"O - While this isn't one of the more complex wild ales out there, I really enjoyed it and it is one of my favorites from Jolly Pumpkin."

""
""
"Pours amber-red with a one finger head that never goes away. Leaves great lacing. Aroma of funk, vinegar and sour cherries. Taste follows the nose with funk and oak barrels at the front. Tart and acidic but not over the top, easy to drink. Very tasty sour!"

Taste is very close to the nose, nice balance between tart funkiness and drinkability. Mouthfeel is light and tart with crisp carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a nice Wild Ale, shares a lot of characteristics of an Oud Bruin."

"Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY poured this beer into a brandy snifter glass and provides a thin ivory head. In the glass it is slightly cloudy with a orangy/reddish hue. This beer has aromas of oak, cellars, and fine wine. On the pallette this beer is funky, with hints of oak, sourness, and tartness. Did a good job holding up to a shepard's pie made with venison & sweet potatoes. A very nice beer."

"O: A fantastic example of a Flanders Ale. Very tart up front, but it isn't a one trick pony...there's a solid malt presence and plenty of fruit and citrus to help round it out...really starting to dig this brewery."

"*Blend 13, 2008. This one has been aging for awhile and it's noticable early. Pours a murky orange color with a quickly dissapating head. Smell is light but of vinegar, vanilla and oak from the barrels. Smells much different from a fresher blend of la roja. Taste is still very good but it has lost a lot of that vinegar punch you would expect. Seems its a lot more oak coming through now and the cherries have disappeared too. Still a very good American wild ale but I'd have to prefer a fresher blend."
"O: Decent beer, if I can even call it that. It reminds me more of a wine than anything. I don't think I would buy it again, but it was worth trying."
"O - My favorite Jolly Pumpkin so far. Like it better than the Bam. My wife may like the Bam Noire a little better than this. For quite a bit less money, the Rodenbach Grand Cru suits us both better but this is a very fine brew."
"I enjoyed this brew, but would prefer smaller doses. I don't want a bomber's worth of this in a sitting. As it is interesting to start, it quickly wears on the palate and the dry/tart character wears out its welcome. I would love to try it with a meal though!"
"O: the smell is absolutely exceptional, it smells more like a freshly cut passion fruit than a freshly cut passion fruit does. Not sure why this one doesn't have a higher rating. It might not be the rarest JP out there, but it's certainly top-notch."
"Loved this one. Drinkable and nice complexities. Very worthy."
"O- Good sour. One of the better american wild ale's I have had (I have only had a few though). For a straight sour beer I really enjoyed this beer."
"I'm going to break out of my normal beer review format for this one and enjoy. Man this is a good beer, Jolly Pumpkin nailed another one. This american wild ale is the best I have had. The smell is so right on it makes me feel like I am sitting inside of the oak barrel with the beer inside of some darkly lit cool cellar. I've tasted many attempts at this style that go so awry. How did they get it so right. A clean sour and some peppery taste makes me wish I was really in the barrel with this beer so I could drink it all. If you've trained your palette to enjoy the sours do not pass this one up."
"Overall, a fine example of a flanders red. Beautiful in the glass and that nice tart, musty funky taste. Good body, not just sour, it's more complex than that."
"O: reminds me of a kriek lambic. Light bodied, with some complexity. Really enjoyed this one."
"This is a very drinkable beer that grows on you as the bottle level gets lower...great example of a ""wild brown""..."
"Pours an amber color, off white head and some lace formations on the glass. Aroma is sweet, sour, and slightly fruity. In the taste, nice and bitterly sour with some berry fruity notes. Wine like, oaky, some woodsy tannins and tart the whole way through. Wine like in its alcohol strength too, a little tart with a burn. Semi dry, medium to light bodied brew. Overall, a really nice treat. Sour, fruity, light spice and very oaky. A fine candidate for cellaring."
"Like it a lot, really hits the spot if you are going for a dry Flemish red made in the states."
"D - Roja doesn't get nearly the credit it deserves as one of the better, year-round and very available sour beers in the U.S. It's the closest thing I have to a traditional Belgian unblended lambic I have had from the states."
"The beer appears dark ruby hued with a half inch of tan head that leaves some nice lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings funk, wild yeast, oak, cherries, assorted fruit. Really nice flavor. Complex, sour, delicious. I am a happy guy. I have had this a few times now. While this is not necessarily a great introduction to the style (though Jeff may disagree), due to the brash complexity and unorthodox nature of the beer, I highly recommend this. Sour cherries, with a healthy sour, lactic presence. The beer in some regards reminds me of Russian River Consecration, which is a very good thing. Ya man, this beer is good stuff. Recommended."
"O: Very good, one of my top 3 JP beer I revisit frequently. I keep meaning to set one away for a couple years to see how it develops."
"This beer might have turned my opinion of the style. Pours a dark red w/ minimal head, lacing, or carbonation. Smell is that of fruit, rum, yeast, and a little funk. Really opens up and smooths out over ten minutes. The taste followed the nose but was a little tart at first. Then something amazing happened. The more I let it air out and breathe, the more the beer smoothed out and came to life. By the end I was saying, ""Holy crap, I really like this beer"". Very complex in every category, and very enjoyable/drinkable. Highly recommended for the style."
"I must drink this rather slowly because it puckers the lips so. Nonetheless, extremely unique and quite nice. I like a real cherry flavor in beer."
"Overall a great sour beer and one that I'll have again and again."
"Overall: Bright, lively and fresh. A fine addition to the wild ale category. Pricey. A great dinner beer."
"This beer pours a deep reddish color with a good hazyness and a decent off white head. the smell is slightly acetic a little vinegary and pleasantly funky. the flavor follows suit with only a slight vinegar taste more tartness and that tooth stripping feel. definitely a funky beer. the mouthfeel is light to medium light with good carbonation. overall this is a great beer and definitely one of the most overlooked american wild producers."
"Overall this is a wonderfully crafted brew."
"O: had to get this while i was out of state, I am overall impressed by the brewery with the sour styling."
"Overall- That is a tasty beverage, Jolly Pumpkin continues to impress. This beer reminds me off the apple orchard as a kid, which reminds me, I should do that this fall, it has been too long."
"Overall: I found this to be very drinkable. Fun and complex without making me want to switch to another beer afterwards. I could drink a few of these in a row."
"Body is as good as any wild ale I've had. Right up there with RR for quality, only this one I can actually find locally, and at a decent price. Great job, this beer is the shit."
"O: Not a bad flanders red, just not the best"
"This beer was poured and paired with Raspberry point Oysters... First time having oysters because I typically don't care for seafood. The smell of the beer was fruity and funky. It looked red in color with a minimal head and lacing. The taste of the beer was tart and had plenty of sour qualities to it. The beer pairs really well with the oysters because they was a lots of black pepper in them. The sour and pepper balanced each other out really well. The mouthfeel is the beer had a good carbonation to it. It's light bodied and kind of refreshing. Overall it's a good wild ale in my opinion. Worth trying for sure."
"Would have liked to split the big bottle."
"O: A decent wild ale that I wish had a bit more depth of flavor and body. It' not bad by any means, but is far from great."
"O: What can I say, I love Jolly Pumpkin. They do these funky barrel aged wilds so well. This stuff is very easy to find and well priced for a wild ale. This is very approachable since it isn't really sour, but still has tons of complexity to keep everyone interested. Anyone who enjoys this style owes it to themselves to check this out."
"O- Very nice beer. Good level of sour/tartness without being overpouring. Good flavor, decent complexity, although not amazing. Carbonation faded too quickly for me. Didn't seem to be as carbonated as some of their other offerings, and definitely faded quicker. Over all a nice beer that I would drink again with out question. As with most wilds, nice refreshing summer beer"
"La Roja is most definitely a Flanders-style sour - oaky and fruity and funky. And it's tart, with slightly sour fruit popping up throughout. But it doesn't beat you over the tongue with puckering vinegar, and it doesn't try to emulate the horde of brews that have recently taken a shot at this style. It's complex and layered, tasty and drinkable. Looking out for the grand reserve :-J"
"D: Overall kinda a dissapointment. Not blown away like I have been by many sours in the past. This one could use some tweaks to further emphasize some flavors."
"O: Was very happy with this beer. Not overly sour/tart and had a really nice fruit flavor to it. Look forward to getting this one again for sure."
"Drinkability: Despite the alcohol showing up it's still very drinkable. Not too dry of a finish but it keeps you coming back for more. Overall a good beer but not amazing."
"O - I love the batch variation of this beer, even more so than with other JP beers. This is my absolute favorite version. The strong bourbon character adds so much to the beer. Just wonderful."
"O: Subtle but complex, and perfectly balanced, La Roja proves a great beer to contemplate on a beautiful evening in early summer."
"It was great to try an aged bottle of this beer. Very complex. After reviewing, the rest of the glass went quite well with some gamey duck pate."
"D - Nice carbonation, sticks to the mouth, but very easy to drink."
"O: Wow, I enjoyed this a lot. Great flavor profile that is an interesting combination that hangs together well. Have heard mixed reviews from friends, so wasn't sure what to expect. Heading to the store tonight to see whether any remains."
"O: Not recommended. I'm not buying this again. 2/5"
"Definitely good but not my favorite Flanders Red. The oak character comes on a bit strong for my tastes, but on the whole I enjoy it. Yum."
"Tonight I need something to kind of wake me up, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of La Roja hiding out in my fridge. What’s more it’s the inaugural vintage from 3 years ago, as the label simply states “Blend 1, 2008.” Guess it’s been there for awhile. Pours a murky blood orange red with no head. Aroma is of oaked funk. Bring on the sour! I’m guessing this is a take on a Flanders Red, given the aroma and appearance. First taste is sour, but not overpowering. Tart cherry hits the sides of the tongue before being washed away by earthy funk in the finish. The taste is wild, but at the same time it’s very restrained. The oak helps keep things in line, and the lengthy aging process has added a nice sherry complexity to things. Mouthfeel is light to medium, with a nice level of carbonation that helps to brighten things up and scrub the palate as you continue to drink it. I’ve had a number of sour beers and this one is among the most well rounded. By that I mean it’s not unnervingly sour – it’s an evenly crafted beer from start to finish. Speaking of the finish, it’s dry, perhaps as to be expected, which means that you keep going back to it. Overall this beer is a refreshing diversion and a must try if you’re a fan of sour or wild ales. If you happen to run across it I’d recommend cellaring it for a couple of years and busting it out. You won’t regret it."
"O: Very easy drinking and smooth. Make sure to open this one over the sink its a gusher. Another great selection from JP, and i would love to try the Grande reserve!"
"Overall, this is a solid Flanders style beer. Nice barrel aging with a decent level of sour acidity and fruitiness. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this beer, but if you're a fan of the style and see it, then it's worth checking out."
"Overall: Solid beer. I like it and for the $10 pricetag possibly my favorite in terms of value. Not comparible to the best I have had but certainly worthwhile!"
"Despite the carbonation flaw, this is a very food-friendly beer. It's not vinegary, but it's a nice amount of fruity sour."
"O: Really solid American Wild. I enjoy that every flavor has it's place and in the end, it's very smooth. The dry pucker at the end is very nice and the sourness never overtakes the subtle fruit flavors. Would drink again, no doubt."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a medium body feel. Finishes with a slight astringency. Overall, a very enjoyable Wild ale. Not quite as sour as a true Belgian Flanders, Gueuze, or Lambic but still pleasant nonetheless."
"Overall- I have had this beer so many times. One of my favs. But, I'm glad I didnt wait any longer on this bottle."
"O: I've tried this beer on a couple previous occasions and found a solid, if not overly remarkable, sour amber ('Oud Bruin'?). This time it's pretty close to 'wow' inducing... great depth of flavor and gorgeous mouthfeel. I'll have to pick up more (as La Roja is available currently in Oregon) and remember to sock it away a couple years minimum. Well done, Jolly Pumpkin."
" Taste is where this one shines, slightly astringent sourness, apple rind on top of an almost ripe mango, woody earth and a very slight wet hay, almost champaign like in the feel, but with a slight creaminess, a very complex and refreshing take on a ""style"" that knows wide variation, Bravo!"
"pours a nice burgandy color with white head. smells of fruit and brett, very pleasant and inviting. nice fruit flavor, not sure which berry, but slightly tart and refreshing, slight hint of sourness and funk. mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and light bodied, very champagne-like. This is a very good brew. It's simple and subtle, which is usually not common for the style, but is a nice change for when you want something that is just slightly wild and has a nice fruit backbone."
"O – A nice sipping beer with a refreshing tartness. Plays nice with a huge swath of food pairings, from red curry, to caprese salad, to earth cheeses."
"I liked it but have certainly had better Wild Ales."
"Tasty offering great for lovers of anything sour."
"Overall a nice effort. This being my first flanders-style ale, I wasn't sure what to expect. Personally I think it could benefit from a bit more body, but I'm not sure if that would be out of character for a flanders. I do know that it tasted great with my turkey meatloaf."
"One of the most under rated sours on the market. La Roja posses an excellent mouth feel and drinkability. The sour/tartness is well balanced with the woody flavors. Hints of raspberries and mellow cherry. Excellent brewing on this one. I bet with some age this beer will drink a lot better. La Roja is a beer I will always have in my cellar and fridge."
"Poured from 750 to a stemless wine class. Pours a hzy copper red, with a thin white head with great lacing. Sour cherry nose, slightly bready. Flavor is a blast of slighty watered down frut punch, some funk, and not much else. A little tart, a little residual bitterness, (a little), and not too complex. As it warms it gain some compexity in the flavor, but really just stronger flavors that are more of the same above. Overall very drinkable, but a little boring for a wild ale."
"O: Overall this is a good beer and am glad I was able to find it, however, and it could just be due to my recent sour phase, but this could be a little more sour for my liking. As most people have said it would be a great intro beer into the style. Would I drink it again? Definitely. Would I buy it again? Eh, probably go with a sure fire RR like consecration."
"O: This is a pretty complex brew. There is impressive balance considering everything going on here. Definitely enjoy this bold beer a lot. Would be a good intro sour that still packs a lot of shock-factor."
"D- a nice wild ale that is easily drinkable a great one to start with or to come back to"
"As one of my first ""sour"" beers, this is a great place to start. It's not nearly as acidic or lactic as other sours on the market, it's tame but approachable - justifiable so a wonderful introduction to the style."
"O - What a fun new category. Overall this is a good beer. I'd like to rank it higher, and would if this bottle resulted in some head/lacing. Others do, just unfortunately mine did not."
"This glass drinks well enough, and I'll be able to finish the entire 750ml bottle, but I don't think I'll buy this beer again. It's a little too strong to drink a lot of, and not quite as sour as I'd like it to be. There are better American wild ales out there, but this one shouldn't be passed up, especially by someone new to the style."
"D - My first Jolly Pumpkin brew and def a repeat drink. Overall very decent for not being a ""traditional"" Flanders red or sour. Very good intro to sours. The St Arnolds Lawnmower of sours in my opinion. Worth trying."
"This seems like it would be a nice opening beer for someone looking to get into sours. Very restrained yet still has a bit of a bite that might ease someone into the sour/wild world. Definitely a beer that is best enjoyed with multiple glasses over a longer period of time to get the full feel for it."
"D- this bottle was easy to finish. enjoyable as any jolly pumpkin that i have tried. this is a seriously underrated brewery pumping out almost exclusively american wild ales. check this out if youre a fan of the style."
"Drinkability- This was my first American Wild Ale style and I greatly enjoyed it! It also went down like nectar. Sweet but great attributes all along the way. Hope to have anything else from this Artisan Ale company again!"
"I'm not very well versed in sours and was excited to find this unexpectedly around here. At $13 a bottle, I won't have it often, but I do enjoy it. Not a difficult drinker."
"D-I was very surprised and excited about the aroma, probably the best I have had in the style. The flavor was ok, but it doesn't have any really strong back bone. All of the different elements are interesting, but nothing takes the lead to tie it all together so it seems like a bit of a mess. I have heard so much about this beer, and I was so happy with Bam Bier, but this was a little disappointing. I finished the bottle, but I don't see myself ever buying this again."
"D - Really easy to drink. Reminds me of just a slighter weaker Russian River sour/wild but I'm very impressed since this is the first Jolly Pumpkin brew I've had. Nice smell and taste that make me wish I had more. I'm suprised that no one had bought this before me and let it sit on the shelf that long, but I'm glad I got to try it and will seek more."
"Overall: A very interesting and complex beer; Jolly Pumpkin excels at offering beers that go beyond beer. Like other Flanders' ales, it has more sour fruit, is dry, and tastes like cider or wine rather than beer. The earth notes are a pleasant addition that add some grit into the beer. It becomes a little less sour as it warms, but it still keeps complex flavors."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer, wasn't sure if I would enjoy this being it was my first taste in the world of sours, but I enjoyed and cant wait until I can venture farther into the world of sour."
"Verdict - After being slightly let down by the La Parcela not tasting like pumpkin; I was happy that this brew tasted as it was advertised. An amber ale. A very good blend of dark fruits and spices. Not too complex and not too shallow. Quite unique and easily drinkable."
"Blend 14 from 2009. It poured a murky burgundy to plum in color a one finger creme colored head. It aromas consist of a dry, dark fruit/cider like sourness. It could be tart cherries, that's probably the closest fruit I'd relate it to. I'm a fan. It made the others in the room pucker. The flavors are very funky and very tart. It has a lot of cherry and a lot of Granny Smith apple to it. It drinks very crisp with an excellent tart bite. This is a fine sour. This beer is drinkable all things considered. It's more tart and more sour than most."
"Man, what a ride! Like I said, there's so much to be gotten from this. Such an interesting taste, it was really a pleasure just experiencing all the different movements. One's probably good for me at a time, don't know if this one's a repeat performer in a sitting. I'd definitely have it again sometime, though."
"(Blend 14,2009)"
"D- This is a very easy to drink sour. Nice balance between sour and funk. Doesn't feel like 7.2% ABV. Worth the money to try, definitely if you enjoy Flanders Red Ales."
"reviewed from notes. amber red in color. very pretty beer. minimal head/lacing. smells sour with vinegar and wood notes. tastes sour with caramel and wood notes. not a ton of differentiation between smell and taste. very very drinkable. moderate carbonation. i really enjoyed this one but it wasn't my favorite wild ale for the price."
"I believe this is the 2nd Jolly Pumpkin that I've had and I've enjoyed both as they tend to take me outside of my norm of stouts and IPAs. Good stuff."
"Good offering. I'm glad to finally tick this one off. I've been a fool to send this out so often, and never truly enjoy one myself. It is the beginner's sour beer in my opinion. I think I may finish this 750 all by myself. That seven percent alcohol never jumps in my way or comes forth."
"Pours a slightly cloudy reddish/light-brown color with a medium white head. Scent is definitely sour funk with some strong cherry aromas. Also get some oak notes along with a hint of brandy. Love the way this beer smells! Taste is initially grassy with oak flavors. Slight sweet vanilla with intense sour cherry flavors. Finishes with fairly strong Brett flavors, oak and brandy. Tasty beer! Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side with a creamy finish. Drinkability is fairly high."
"Mouthfeel is average. Maybe a bit to much carbonation. I nursed a glass for the better part of an afternoon and got a little bored with the flavor. I need a certain amount of fruit to come through for me to really enjoy a sour or Wild ale."
"D - I thought this one was a decent, middle of the road Flanders style. Good for sure, I'd have it again."
"D: This is along the lines of a Flemish Red, but much drier. I am definitely a big fan of this brew, and I'm sure any fan of sours will also appreciate it."
"D- Horrible for my tastes. I understand its supposed to be sour, but this is horribly off tasting."
"I really had no idea what I was getting into with his beer, just heard about them and someone at the local Whole Foods recomended this. I can honestly say this is probably one of the best beers I have had, will be getting it again and will be trying other beers by Jolly Pumpking despite the beers being on the outer ranges of what I am pushing as far as prices. If you see this buy it, truly exceptional."
"d- nice actually, after you get over the initial puckering sourness it goes down very easily, very flavorful, and did not disappoint. i'd pick this up again!"
"Fairly light bodied and well carbonated. Very drinkable. Each sip leaves a pleasant flavor on your palate that lingers for quite a well. The 7.2 ABV will help keep me warm but doesn't play a role in the taste or drinkability at all. A great intro to American Wild Ales."
"D - Not over the top in abv, but after a bomber, you might want more, though it possibly would not be wise."
"Overall a decent sour, worth a shot. Not a beginners sour however."
"I'm more than half way through the bomber, and don't feel like stopping yet."
"D - I could not finish the bottle. This beer was just overwhelmingly sour. But I will say it did pair up fairly well some tortellini and red sauce for dinner and it might be intended to be this sour so while it might not be for me its still a well made ale."
"maybe I had a bad bottle? Who knows. It was like a watered down Supplication with rotted wood and sweaty, musty sock juice poured in. no thanks"
"Poured a dark brown with reddish highlights that had a half finger of head which had great retention and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma made it seem like it would be tart in flavor that consisted of slight vinegar, cherries, funky, oaky, and mild acidic notes. It did have some lemon character as well. The flavor reminded me more of a flanders red but funkier. the cherries were more potent on the palate with oaky, funky, and slight vinegar accents with acidic tart lemony notes. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, acidic, citrusy, oaky, funky, tart, and tingly finish. It drank great and reminded me how tarty this brew was. I definitely need to pick up some bottles of this in the near future."
"TASTE: sour, but not puckering; tastes a lot like the Drie Fonteinen ""Doesjel"" bottling - which was an unblended aged lambic; very smooth; not sweet like other Flanders Reds; this is oddly dry - I like it; 7.2% alc. is not noticeable; this is an artisan amber ale aged in oak barrels; blended from barrels ranging to over a year in age. This is one of my favorite breweries in the country."
"My favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer so far!"
"O: Some of the flavors need more time to mellow out, including the bitterness. I appreciate the dryness (many in this style are undrinkably sweet). Overall, I enjoyed it, but would have liked it somewhat cleaner."
"D: Overall there's funk and then there's FUNK. This one is just a bit ot far off the funk rails for my tastes."
"Pours a hazed copper color, thin cap of head, minimal retention. Scent is mild and contains notes of sweet caramel, bready yeasts, citrusy hops, damp earth and wood. Taste brings the damp funkyness to the front, tastes of yeasty bread red wine, apple vinegar followed up by some caramel and citrus. Quite mixed and muddled flavor, but i think that was the goal with this one. Medium bodied, dry finish. An interesting beer with many things going on at once with neither standing out too much."
"D - Quite high with lower ABV and great not too intense sour flavors."
"Dark amber-brown with off-white head sitting on top. Aroma of citrus notes, sourness, and lemon zest. Sour flavors, lemons, spiked apple cider (thanks, Grandma), and some candy. The spritzy body bites the palate and accentuates the flavors. A very refreshing, lively, pleasant drink."
"Pours a fairly clear garnet with a heavy sud atop. Lacing is thick and plentiful. As with the best Jolly Pumpkin bottles the nose is rich, integrated, with a wholesome wallop of oak and brett. Cherries and red wine barrel really come out here, wet wood, bugs. I have found that in the past 3-4 years Jolly Pumpkin stuff has tended to become on the bland side for some reason, whether it's less time in the oak, less attention from the brewer, or what have you. I think this would have been fairly nondescript fresh, but 2 years is a nice age here. Mouth is fairly expressive with sour cherries, green apple, oak of course, brett. Green apple is very welcome and is quite strong. A strange bit of mint on the finish that's kind of distracting. Medium carbonation, good amount, soft feel. This isn't the best bottle of La Roja I've had but it's among the better ones."
"D - The sour is good but it's incredibly dry and becoming a chore to drink the more I have it. A moderate wild but a little moldy-like."
"As always, Jolly Pumpkin had made an insanely drinkable, balanced brew. Light cherry tartness, chewy wood characteristics, light malt sweetness, light apple-like acidity, horse blanket funk in the nose. Pretty chewy mouthfeel, low carbonation, no ABV to be found, really nice."
"D -- Very nice, worth a pickup. Maybe even two or three."
"Split a bottle with a friend. Some sours can pack so much tangy punch, it can be hard to split a 750ml bottle, but this had nice, slightly restrained character. The opening earthy barnyard character is subtle and not so overpowering like an old, stinky gueuze. It's followed by tart lemon and sour cherries. It doesn't come off as the most complex sour, though maybe a year or two in a cellar would change that. but it's pleasantly sour while remaining relatively drinkable and I appreciate that."
"Pours a hazy deep brown color with a ruddy hue. There is a think tan head that recedes quickly and leaves only light lacing. The aroma is funky and pretty tart with notes of tart cherries and sweet malt dominating. A little aroma of wet wood is also present. The taste is a bit more mild than the aroma would suggest, but still very nice. There is a light tartness and signature JP funk mixed with some lightly sweet and tart cherries and damp wood. The body is middle-of-the-road with carbonation on the light side. Pretty drinkable stuff, but not as funky as I would expect from a 4 year old JP beer."
"D - tasty and fairly easy to drink, though more boozy than a 7% that feels light should be"
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked."
"D: This drinks really well for a wild ale, perhaps due in part to its lack of a mouth puckering sourness. I had no problem polishing off the bottle on my own over the course of about 2 hours. $12/750 ml is a decent price for a wild ale these days too. Highly recommended."
"(D)- Just a great an intriguing beer. Fits the style well for sure. Simply a great beer to get your sour fix. Maybe it is just this particular batch, but was surprised at how low most of the ratings are based upon what is in my glass in front of me."
"Split from a bottle into a New Belgium wine glass. Poured a murky red red-orange with a minimal white head. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, sour, and fruit. The flavor was of sour malt, raspberries, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice Wild Ale. Had a mellow flavor that made it quite enjoyable. Also the aroma on this one was quite nice as well. This one is a must try for any Wild Ale fan if you get the chance."
"This beer pours with a deep reddish color. The ivory foam holds for just a minutes and then leaves some ok lacing. The aroma instantly reveals what Jolly Pumpkin does best: sour. Heavy scents of sour apple and wild yeasts, as well as hints of oak. The flavor is exactly what you expect from the smell. Heavy sour notes hit you right up front with a dry, oaky finish. This beer is a very good example of a sour ale, but know what you're getting into when pouring this beverage."
"This bottle was a gusher, but the three people who tried it still thought everything was pretty good. I'd like to try a fresher batch though."
"This is a very drinkable beer and I have to say I am enjoying it quite a bit. It goes down easy and is very refreshing. I dig sour beer, but the prospect of drinking a whole large format bottle of it can at times seem a bit of a quagmire. However, I will finish this one off by myself quite easily."
"O-What an awesome start to this BIF. A sour with plenty of room left for flavor. Lactic, but not vinegary."
"D - a bomber is easy to put away. This beer is light with excellent flavro and aroma, perfect for multiple drinks."
"Oh, Ill finish this big ass bottle by myself, but I must say this is one tart beer...its like touching your tongue to a 9v battery."
"D: I used to love this when I was new to sours, but after a couple of years of exploring the style, I can't honestly put this on the same pedestal as Russian River. It's not terrible, but it's closer to middle of the pack than upper-tier. Quite a good value, though."
"Cheers."
"M&D: this ale has shown a decent ageing potential, I'd say; the flavour profile is quite balanced, the body is medium-plus, and the carbonation is very healthy indeed (for this batch/blend); all in all, this is a very likeable oaky-funky ale."
"It has an OK drinkability, nothing special, but for a wild at 7% it's fairly drinkable. Some of the flemmy taste gives it a tougher swallow, and a very light warming booze with the sour and tart fruits. But for what it is, it's fairly drinkable."
"Worth a try."
"very approachable drinkable sour. could have many of these, but i wish some of the flavors weren't so faint."
"CHEERS!!"
"Yeah, a tasty, refreshing beer. If it had more character this would be sensational, but it's very drinkable."
"This beer is better cold than at room temperature. Its quite bretty in the mouth, mild tartness, sourness is moderate. There is some sweetness to it up front but mostly this is a brett bomb. Overall its pretty good for a wild, i wouldn't really describe this beer as overly fruity or sour. If I want a sour made with cherries I think I'll go for a supplication."
"Although this can be a bit too acidic, it's a very interesting take on the style and it's fun to seek out all of the unusual flavors. It would have received an even better review if it hadn't been enjoyed in such close proximity to several glasses of Consecration."
"d: boy I could drink a bunch of this. very tasty, nicely sour, nice oak. this is a really great beer!"
"It's a nice enough beer, but it's a little bit too acidic and intense, without the complexity to make it really exceptional. I've had better Wilds, and better beers from Jolly Pumpkin. Still, it's hard not to respect it."
"D = Meh. Some flavor but after having La Folie leaves me a bit wanting. It seems other pumpkin offerings have more going on."
"I enjoyed this brew today but I've had much better beer from Jolly Pumpkins before. They are in the top 20 of my favorite brewers in the USA."
"Great big head, pretty hazy body, and brown hue. Aroma was grain, flowers, herbal, light yeast, and granny smith apples. Long finish with a medium body, dry texture, and lively carbonation. Can really taste the oak, which gets more intense at the finish lingers."
"pours a semi-transparent ruby color with good off white head, good lacing, and lively carbonation. sour fruity smell, taste is much the same with a bit of dryness to it. moderately sweet. tart and sour but still on the moderate side. lite body, with a thin slick texture that's a bit chalky and sour in the finish. average flavor duration. very mellow and smooth but still delicious."
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied and carbonation is also above average. Drinkability is pretty good, it had a lot of great flavors to it. It was pretty well balanced between the tart and sour flavors and the sweet fruity flavors which definitely helped the drinkability. Very good beer overall."
"Overall, very impressed with this one. When colder, exhibits the refreshing goodness of a Rodenbach or an Oude Tart; as it warms, much more of the funky horse-blanket starts coming through and delivering an uncanny yet pleasant experience."
"i can see why wild ales are an acquired taste, i had a hard time finishing this bottle. the flavors were pretty off putting at first, but improved a bit as i worked my way through the bottle. even still, i won't be revisiting this beer or even this style anytime soon."
"Very solid beer. Not spectacular. Needs to be more sour for me. But I can't deny that it does a lot of things very well. I think it objectively a good beer, even if I don't see myself buying this again."
"man, there is a lot going on here... deep, dark amber with a tan head that holds well and leaves a good amount of lace. soft caramel and a savory maple syrup (like pancakes with bacon and syrup?) scent hit me first followed by funk and vinegar and wrapped up with wood and musty, earthy fruitiness. the wild and sour sides come out a lot as it warms. taste is all of the above, and it seems to have a peaty almost whiskeyish note in the finish. i know it's barrel aged, but is it bourbon barrel aged? just a little too hot for me, but interesting, complex and well made."
"The scent is sweet and sour, with grapes, apple, cider and balsamic vinegar and just a suggestion of acidity that clears the nose a bit. Initially the flavor is a tart fruitiness, berries and apple cider that transforms to a sour, lemon tart with a burst of citric acidity. There is a definite woody character from the barrels that settles in over the course of the experience as well. Not upfront, not intense, more of a rounded flavor. There is decent, but understated carbonation and a light-medium body that is maybe just a touch on the watery side."
"The carbonation is ample and these guys seem to have taken a note from the Belgians on how to utilize the proteins in the beer and make bacteria do its thing in adding flavor and mouthfeel. I only wish they knew how to mask the alcohol a little better, as it detracts from the other flavors."
"This is a very authentic-tasting Flanders Red. Well played, Jolly Pumpkin."
"All told I (and the wiv) have been really pleased with what we've had the opportunity to taste from Jolly Pumpkin. We ate it with rachel Ray's super sloppy joes, which was a bad pairing, but it seems like it would be good with a salmon or a spicy dish, which is to say not a sweet dish. Although it isn't a Lambic (the gold standard of sour ales) it is quite a pleasing offering from Jolly Pumpkin, as have been all of their beer I've tried thus far. We will definitely be picking up more from them."
"D - One of the best beers I've had lately. It solves the ""beers my girlfriend would like"" conundrum very easily. As an added bonus, the alcohol content is not outrageously high. Of course, it's not exactly cheap, but definitely worth the money spent."
"Pours a dirty amber brown with a explosive foam. Nose is oak, yeast, chalk, apples, and cherries. Taste is very pleasant. Part 1 is a solid tartness, 5/10 on the pucker-meter, next is apples, cherries, and other dark fruits, finishes with a nice smooth yeasty swirl. Mouthfeel is medium and it is quite drinkable for the style. I could imagine actually finishing a bomber by myself."
"This bottle is labeled on the back with ""blend 3 2008"". Poured into a snifter. Leaves pretty decnet lacing down the glass. The appearance is a dark orangish brown with a big very light brown head. The smell is yeasty/bread, sourness, zesty, spices, a bit of sweetness almost like vanilla probably from the oak, I can also pick up some oak once it starts to warm up, and an array of fruits. The taste is has some of the same attributes. Tart and sour, spices, bready, some kinds of fruits I'm not sure what kinds but they are there. Kind of zesty, lemon stands out but I know there is more to it. The mouthfeel is pretty good and the alcohol is not there at all. Pretty drinkable, kind of sour but it's not terribly bad. I've been curious about this one for a long time and am happy I finally opened it up. Pretty good overall, I'd pick it up again especially if it was fresh so I could taste it to compare."
"I'm still not good with the subtleties of sours, though this brew is light on the wood, which I prefer. It's a good evening drink after a day in the low 90's. But while the sour aspects of this type of wild is nice, I'm still looking for more funky, musty, barnyard American brews."
"Overall, a nicely balanced wild ale that showcases some really nice tart flavors but also has really nice balance. The hop notes did seem a bit much for this type of beer at points, but it mostly worked as a positive to let the sour notes shine. Definitely recommended."
"Flavor is not what I was hoping for. This is one beer I can tell will only get better with age. Brett will do this beer wonders. By the way, this perticular beer was bottled in April of this year(2 months ago). Tart and funk elements are very faint. Oak and earthy! There's an odd bland aspect about halfway through the flavor. Starts decent, blands out...and then finishes tart and dry. The late aftertaste is the best part! Slight lemon and cirtus. Carbonation is relatively weak, light and crisp mouthfeel. Once again, I feel this beer needs age...will definitely revisit!"
"D- Not mouth puckering sour but has a nice bite. Really good flavor and very crisp with some good pronounced flavors. I will be looking forward to other Jolly Pumpkin offerings."
"I poured from my 750ml bottle into my glass and got a thin off white head. It is dark amber to copper in color. The aroma is green apple and some tart cherry. The taste is sour/tart fruit focusing on cherries. It's sweet for a split second before the sourness kicks in. It finishes with a musty/moldy taste. The cherry taste really sticks to my lips. It has a growing welcoming affect on me. The more I drink, the more I want of it. The tartness seems to overtake the musty taste as I continue to drink. This is style that I have very limited experience with but I could see it growing on me."
"Conclusion - A drink that goes quite well by itself, but paired with my ""hog wild"" pizza and Belgian frites proves this is a great beer to accompany and stand up to some heavy dishes. Due to price, this is now my go-to sour beer at the beer bistro."
"Overall a very tasty beer. The beer's appearance is not too inviting, but I soon move past that once smelling and tasting. Likely had a complex grain bill, but the hard-working yeast(s) have made this brew highly-attenuated and crisp with not much residual sweetness. I could see myself drinking La Roja in the winter or summer months."
"Batch 4. Bottled 4.23.10. Murky copper color (much like an apple cider) but really looked like an oude bruin. Musty aroma with sour green apple, lots of wild yeast, soured cherry, green raison, and a faint nose of old hops. Taste is semi-tart with more green apple and lots of earthy red malt. Great moderate acidity that makes this dangerously drinkable. A 750ml is perfect for me. A 12oz. just wouldn't be enough. Congrats to Ron Jeffries and thanks for making this readily available at so many liquor stores."
"D: Well I could finish this one but I wouldn't buy another. In the words of Jim Carrey ""eh...I've had better"". I'll just stick with La Folie until I can find something better."
"J"
"Fairly refreshing drinkability overall, and not over the top in any category of flavor."
"Maybe with time it would get a little more sour but in my book this beer is just ok. Not sure if I would pay the $10 again or nto for a bottle. Rather just trade for a Supplication."
"This beer is difficult to review. It smells great, and the mouthfeel is fantastic. The flavor doesn't contain a single note that turns me off, and some sips even have bursts of really good things. Yet, in the end I find the flavor to be a little lacking. It's a quality beer, but I can't really see what recommends it over other readily available wilds. It does pique my interest in other Jolly Pumpkin offerings though."
"Had this about two years after the first review. I'm in love with sours now and was very glad to pick this up again. tastes slightly sour with some good tart in the finish. Good mouthfeel and dark fruits coming through as well. Really loved this beer the second time around. Fantastic."
"Bottle from Crown Liquors #6 - This beer pours dark amber with minimal white head. Aroma is green apple and vinegar with roasted malt undertones. Taste is salty and sour with white grapes, green apples, and some bready malt. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated."
"Overall, a very focused beer. Not a lot of complexity going on. Very precise. Another great selection from JP, and one I hope to pick up again soon."
"D: Awesome."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer and could have several glasses. Just amazing. This is nice and tart. The cherries and the sour really mesh well. Cannot wait to try another Jolly Pumpkin beer."
"D - Very, very good. I am very glad I picked this one up. However, at $11.99 a bottle I will save this one for a once in a while drink."
"The beer is very well carbonated for the style, and it is nice and light bodied. The flavors are mild, but well balanced. There is a nice dry finish and the alcohol is never present. Overall an average wild ale, but nice for something so accessible."
"D: Decently blended beer, goes down relatively well, as I am just getting in to the sours and wilds, this is an interesting beer, but I've had a few others that I may opt for first before this."
"The body is medium and carbonation is high but soft. Drinkability is average...this goes down easy but doesn't really interest me at all. Decent, but not worth the price tag."
"This one is a lot better than the first. Nice tart cherriness like before but this time the oak is really up front with some nice vanilla."
"D - Very solid brew, wish it had more carbonation to really bring out those aromas, but enjoyable none-the-less."
"I have just recently developed a taste for sour beers, and I must say that this beer has definately helped my new found affection for this style grow exponentialy. Drinkability you ask?? Off the charts, I loved every sip!"
"D: Good flavours and not overly super expensive in this style, what's not to like."
"D - a fair Wild Ale...just missing something in the transition from nose to mouth. still quite refreshing (due to lack of sourness and good mouthfeel)."
"I could certainly finish this bomber by myself. Very enjoyable little brew here- I found two more bottles of this on a day trip to Michigan today, so I can't wait to let them get some age on em!! If you like sours, give this one a shot!"
"D: Bizarre. This is certainly a unique beer. It's sort of like a complex knot. I enjoyed trying to untie it and figure out where each flavor was going and connected to. However, it never really forms a cohesive brew. It's a fun beer, for sure, but just needs something to tie it all together. A beer I thoroughly enjoyed, but will not go back to in particular in the future -- but, I will be exploring Jolly Pumpkin's arsenal."
"Mouthfeel was highly carbonated and medium bodied. One of the thicker mouthfeel sours that I have had. Probably with more age this one would have calmed down some of its oak flavors. I would recommend anyone with this batch to hang onto it for a little longer to get some more mellowing."
"A really nice sour that does not dissapoint it reminds me in a lot of ways of a concecration in fact a lot of ways. I would love to do a side to side comparision. Lots of red wine taste to this, some carbination, well done and recommended a must try."
"Drinkability... overall, this was a disappointment. Granted, the other beers of the style I had were Supplication and Sanctification... and that's a hard act to follow. But I thought that there were layers of complexity that just weren't there."
"This is a good beer. This makes a nice replacement Flemish Sour since Rodenbach Grand Cru changed from being an all older ale beer (which really made it lose a lot of the raw character it originally had)"
"Overall a quality beer and it's nice to see how it's aged, but I wouldn't let it sit in-bottle any longer."
"D - Overall a pretty nice beer. Fairly mild for a wild, but it improved a lot as it warmed, letting the oak and wild yeast shine a lot more. A tasty brew."
"Drinkability was great. Nover overly tart, sweet or bitter."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip. Slightly cloudy, dark red almost brown topped with a 1 finger brownish head. Lacing thru-out. Sour fruit aromas with earthy spice and yeast. I taste sour fruit (cherry, apple) with a little sweet caramel. Medium body with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. I am new to sour ales but this was good- one or two glasses would be enough."
"ottle- I thought I already rated this, because I had this so many times, and then I realized I did not enter my ratings, and my notes are not here, so now I open my only bottle. Obtained this 2 years ago in Michigan. Pours just a slight hazed amber with a thin beige cap. Nose of fruit (apple, plums, cherries) and lots of yeast with floral spices and some rye bread with a bit of booze. Flavour profile is full of cherries and yeast with good rose petal floral hopiness. Wood and bretty funk as well. I love the finish of these beers. Quite yeasty and funky, but refreshing and always leading me to want more."
"Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this was a little strange but enjoyable nonetheless. Not something I'd be stocking up on, but the one bottle was good, and not much of a chore to get through."
"D- Most sours I have a hard time drinking in large quantities, this one is a lot more drinkable. Its not overly sour, instead its crisp and refreshing."
"Don't drink and review."
"This is my first experience with the style, and though I don't love the flavor, I am thankful for the experience. The flavors are pretty out-there and the high ABV make for a good one-time experience. I might pick it up again if I were hosting a tasting, but definitely not to sit around and drink."
"Serving type: bottle"
"What a find here. Saw this one at my local liquor store and finally decided to bite--I'm glad I did. Pours a beautiful amber auburn red color with decent sandy head that laces nicely all the way down the glass. Smell is nice with some yeastiness, some vinegar, and some fruit. Some bourbon-like aromas too--vanilla, oak, and butter. Taste follows with some real complexity. I do, however, recommend drinking this at near-room temperature, as it really opens up. Big bold vinegar, apple, yeast, oak, butter, vinegar, must, yeast, and some others that I can't pick out. Robust, but balanced at the same time, I like it. MF is smooth and medium bodied, a bit of a dry finish. Drinkability is great, the bomber disappeared way too fast."
"D – This is a very nice brew now and again; not phenomenal overall, but still very good."
"Notes: My first Jolly Pumpkin beer and I liked it. I will need to pursue some more oak aged beers. I like the flavor that it imparts to the beer that is already there. That being said, this beer wasn't super impressive, but still a good beer."
"Drinkability: Solid and delicious through and through, and a style I'll sip on during the summer regularly if I can ever afford it. Worth the extra cash the bottle may be over others this size in the style."
"Originally reviewed on 02-08-2009."
"Not a bad beer by any means, but it doesn't even come close to the higher end beers of the style."
"D- Drinkablity is steller and i will be buying out the rest at my local store to celler and enjoy for the next couple of years...Or weeks Cheers!!!"
"D - I like this beer quite a bit and will definitely purchase another."
"Overall I found it messy and hard to grab a hold of. Like the cat though."
"Not bad, but the flavor left me wanting a little more. It was a little muddled and probably a little too heavy on the oak for my tastes."
"D/ not a beer for everyone people might be scared by the souwerness but the oak taste is real good its a beer for the summer refreshing lightly chilled and for cold days not chilled."
"O: While all JP brews are aged in oak (as far as I know), this is the only one that I've had that has really screamed oak to me. I still strive for more sour/funkiness in my beer."
"D- High. One of my favorite reasonably priced American Wild Ales. Worth seeking out. My favorite by far of the few jolly pumpkin beers I've had."
"Overall: Wow, what a special brew. Never have I tasted such a smooth yet aggressively flavored beer. I was hooked after one whiff but found myself taking sip after sip to try and put words to the complex assault of flavors that were being evoked."
"Overall, this beer is holding up great. Nice sour cherry flavors and a good amount of oak shows through. I enjoyed it a lot. Pretty drinkable."
"D-i was not impressed with this beer. it was extremely sour and didn't bring a whole lot else."
"While not as expected, this was a great beer. Even without the funk and with a downplayed sourness there's still enough underneath to carry it. If I could tweak it I'd let the wild yeast run a bit, but as a nice easy drinking beer I'd be happy to spend an evening with a couple bottles of this. Oh yeah... and I love the cat on the bottle art."
"i enjoyed this however it seems a lot has fallen out of it. i would assume there would be more cherry flavor when fresh."
"Drinkability: I thought the sour fruitiness would be present start to finish, but the hops at the end are a little overpowering to those flavors."
"D: this is a sipper and a tough one to figure out, love it it is so unique i have never had a wild ale and i am a fan, this was also the first offering i have had form jolly pumpkin my beer store has two more offerings I am going to swoop them up today."
"OVERALL as stated above, I can no longer say that I don't really like sours. Very pleasnt, enoyable and easy drinking."
"The taste is not good. Its supposed to be a wild ale but its more like a combination between a wild ale and an flanders ale but they don't know which they wanted to do it. Its light sour but not very good with a bad aftertaste. This is a very disappointing effort."
"D- At first the unbalanced funkiness is a bit too strong, but after several sips the beer becomes very drinkable. Would definitely drink again!"
"I would try it again, but I couldn't do too many of these at a time. I attempted to share this bottle with some family, but no one had more than a sip before making an interesting face and complaining."
"Drinkability: If the bottle was a tad cheaper I'd make this a routine beer. A very well crafted beer by Ron Jeffries. This has a great mouthfeel and a nice blend of aromas and flavors."
"There is a lot of carbonation, and this finishes dry. The drinkability of this beer is good, but such a large bottle is a lot to drink. This is a very good wild ale, and I would recommend giving it a try."
"Overall, this is a great beer and a must try. Definitely the best Jolly Pumpkin beer I have tried."
"D: this is very tart and a bit boozy for a sour ale. It is not highly drinkable, but it is an enjoyable brew."
"Overall, I would Recommend this beer to someone that likes Flemish reds, and I will be having it again."
"D: It is very enjoyable and much easier to approach than other sours. I think I could finish the bottle myself but am much happier splitting it. If you are looking for a sourfest this is not the way to go but otherwise worth the try."
"D- Jolly Pumpkin, I apologize for last review of the La Roja. I was young and naive to your sour ways. Please forgive me. I promise I will visit you more often. I'm not the same person I was then. Please allow me this second chance. So what do you say, can we have a fresh start?"
"D - Yet another very well crafted beer from Jolly Pumpkin its one of those stepping stone sours that people not used sours can get in to with its good taste worth getting to drink"
"drinkability: a decent brew and this was my first wild ale so it;s hard to compare."
"Drinkability is not really good, i couldn't really drink think of a regular basis, maybe once in a while, but not too often. The mouth feel has a sort of odd, dryness to it, that I don't really like."
"Drinkability is a little low, I don't think I'll order more than one glass of this."
"The smell was all Spices, nutmeg and coriander mainly with some citrus. The tast was also citrus spice malt & nutmeg with a very carbonated mouthfeel. At 750ml is just too much but what bliss, I also have to mention that I had list at a pub and paid over $25 USD."
"Drinkability - From what I have been experiencing, very so. I am already putting this on my list to pick up more tomorrow. At half the cost of Temptation and Consecration, it is a nice mix in and does a pretty damn good job."
"Long green pepper finish, spicy green herb finish."
"This was my first sour ale, and I quite enjoyed it. The pour was a coppery brown color with a one finger beige head that took a long time to go down. The smell was similar to red wine with a bit of cherries and some oak. At first, the taste was fairly astringent and quite sour, but as it warmed up the astringency dissapeared and a tart cherry flavor remained. The mouthfeel was medium and bubbly. This went down fairly easy, especially after it warmed up, but I'm not sure I'd run out and buy another bottle. Perhaps I'd try some Flander's ale."
"D: Not quite what I was hoping for, but still a good beer."
"Drinkability: I mean, I finished it no problem. It's a relatively easy-drinking beer, but it's more for me due to the lack of much flavor. It's worth a shot, but at what you pay for it, there are certainly other worth alternatives."
"If you are a fan of wild ales, this would probably be right up your alley."
"i thought this beer was great. in fact love concencration and when i took my first swig that is exactly what i thought of! mouth feel was full and sparkly. the taste was not quite as sour as the great concencaration but the aftertaste was, i thought, was much better and very desirable. overall a great beer at 11.99 a bottle i think it is a great substitute for the beer that i've been trading for."
"This is very nicely tart and malty, without the expected funk."
"Drinkablity: not the best Flanders brew I have had but definatly worth a try."
"drinkability is very good and i had no problems finishing off a 750ml bottle"
"Go get it! distributed by Stone Brewery San Diego Ca"
"Very lively carbonation, but spot on for the style. This was my first beer from Jolly Pumpkin and I'm enjoying it immensely."
"Drinkability- It wouldn't be had to finish a 750 ml bottle in a sitting."
"D: A beer I could sip on all night. Worth every penny I paid for it."
"Once again, I'm impressed by a Jolly Pumpkin brew. There brews are different enough that you can tell them apart and keep you wanting more, but all share the same common theme of excellent artisan ales brewed with wild yeast. Great stuff."
"750ml capped bottled served at 45 degrees in a tulip. Blend 23, 2008 indicated on the back label. Poured a murky brownish-plum color with a one inch off-white head that slowly receded into a pock-marked, frothy cap and then a congealed dollop of white. Big sour, fruity (red berries, cherries) nose intermixed with wood. A bit of mustiness follows towards the back. Taste follows nose, but fruit flavors are incredibly muted by the sour, with the wood character really coming out in the mix. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with a slightly prickly effervescence that finally culminates in a dry finish. Interesting brew - a fair amount of complexity, but something I would definitely need to be in the mood for to enjoy - I happen to be in the mood. Not my favorite JP, but this one really stands up."
"D - I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I didn't realize this was a wild ale. However, it was enjoyable and I look forward to sampling more Jolly Pumpkin offerings in the future."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable, not too intense (i.e. rich or hoppy), but still not a beer I'd particularly want to session (unfortunately I lost about 1/3 of my bomber to the gushing)."
"D - Wow. This beer is remarkable. Very complex and dynamic, but somehow the beer doesn't overwhelm the palate. This is the kind of beer that rewards the drinker who takes his/her time. A must-try!"
"Overall, an all around solid wild ale. the best part is the smell, but the taste is pretty good as well. Solid if not groundbreaking. I will buy again, after I try some other JP offerings."
"D= pretty good. Not as much flavor as I wanted but still nice. Ill be buying it again for sure but with lower expectations. Not bad at all."
"A: Finger of foam on a medium pour, thick head that lingered for 10 minutes, dull rust to ruby grapefruit color, mildly opaque - 4.50, S: Quite tart, some bitter cherry aromas, very subtle signs of oak - 4.00, T: The tartness on the nose comes through on the tongue, some unripe apple, what tastes like tannins presumably from the oak aging, some vanilla in the distant, the 7.2% on the label seems understated as alcohol is upfront - 3.50, M: 3.00, D: My first Jolly Pumpkin beer and I only realized after opening the beer that I didn't pick my favorite style, trying to look at the beer objectively this is a nicely crafted brew - 3.50"
"Taste was not far from the appearance, either. Tart, sour flavor upfront, becoming a little bitter with a hint of oak, finishing very dry. I found it to be very drinkable, with no hint that it was nearly twice as strong as other lambics I have had, and loved sipping it from a champagne flute as a nightcap after a very long day."
"The more I drink this, the more the sour is just an up front taste that gives way, but coats the mouth. Sours are a lot like Super Hoppy beers. A big wave at the beginning, they mellow, but coat your tongue with their flavor flav. Gotta branch out more now..."
"Worth trying if you like sours.. and especially if you like both sours and oak aged beers."
"Drinkability: As always, it's another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin. To say these beers aren't for everyone is a huge understatement. Paired well with the song ""Here I Dreamt I Was An Architect"" by The Decemberists."
"D: This is a very good and interesting beer, but not exceptional. The smell outweighs the taste, which is kind of a shame. And as notes, it got better after a while in the glass. Would definitely have it again if it was offered."
"This is a very tasty sour beer."
"D- I have enjoyed this beer a lot. Jolly Pumpkin is a nice brewery from the couple of beers that I have. Wouldn't drink this as a everyday staple but...it would be good to try with my friends that like wine."
"I love the look of this beer with it's deep reddish brown hues and nice creamy head which dissipates to a thin layer on top. It smells a bit sour and earthy. The taste matches the nose along with a bit of woodsy and caramel sweetness to balance the sourness of the brew. It's a smooth mouthfeel with a nice woodsy aftertaste. One of those beers that's great for one or two, but wouldn't want to drink more than that."
"Mouthfeel is dryly carbonated, crisp,light bodied. Very interesting beer."
"D- It could have been a little more sour while maintaining the same drinkability, but overall very good."
"D: No problem finishing the bottle on this."
"D - This is a pretty good wild ale. Very complex blend of flavors and tasty."
"Gotta love American brewers doing funky oak aged Belgian ales, and doing it right. Appears an inviting deep russet red-brown, a healthy and foamy head both in the glass and in the remainder of the bottle, lasts as long as the beer does. This is really lambic-y up front... tart lime and apple, lemon rind, funky wet wood and dust. However as you drink it and as it warms, the delicious hearty caramel notes of a well made Belgian ale come through from underneath. Once your tongue gets used to the sourness there's plenty more to this beer. Sweet, earthy, ripe, and fruity. This beer has an excellent prickly and lively texture, quite complex flavors, and keeps you interested through and through. A real piece of work in artisan brewing."
"D: A promising start...then this brew fell flat on its face. I like the experimentation, but the end product is just ok. I wouldn't go so far as to say stay away from this one, but certainly no need to seek it out."
"D- This one was looking like such a winner until I took a sip. I felt like I would either love to see it more sour or more caramel barleywinesque with just a touch of sourness but the balance that was struck didn't quite do it for me. I'd love to try a fresh bottle for comparison."
"Overall, this is probably the first JP beer ive had that really dissapointed me. Certainly not a bad beer in any way, but not up to their standards. I think they could put a little more effort into this one and make it a better beer. I won't pay the high price for this again when i can get nearly any belgian flemish for less. Still an ok beer though, in fact, enjoyable. don't regret the purchase."
"D - This was a good beer, my first Wild Ale, but I enjoyed something different, and this was certainly different, but very enjoyable"
"Pours a murky brown with a large tan head that hangs around for some time. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has a funky aroma of barnyard and sour fruit such as cherries and apples. The flavor is moderately sour and funky. The finish is slightly sour and dry. Has a light body that is well carbonated. Seems fitting for the flavors. Middle of the road when it comes to sour and funky but is pleasantly flavorful and easy to drink."
"(Blend 1, 2008)"
"D - One of the easiest to drink wild beers I have had. Plenty of sour funk but very easy to drink."
"My palette is DEAD after this beer."
"A nice blend between a Flanders red and an American wild."
"Give this a try if you see it around and are looking for something different. Good stuff out of dexter michigan."
"Drinkability: For what it is, I think it's quite drinkable. The one pint went down pretty quick for me. It's crisp, not too sour, but complex and interesting. I will definately buy again."
"The drink is both mellow and crisp, with creamy feel borne of a huge malty body and superb carbonation. The drink is quaffable and delicious, and has a Cat-Pirate on the label. What could be better?"
"i would be able to put back a few of these easy. very drinkable. definitely worth a try"
"D: I wouldn't consume a whole lot of it, but it is an interesting beer all around, and definitely a good gateway to a more sour beer. Not as intense as others that I've had, but a well constructed beer, I'd like to sample some more from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Drinkability: A very fine brew from JP, not too sour, not too sweet, just very balanced. None of the flavors really stand out too much, and that's just fine - just nice and pleasant. The 7.2% is nowhere to be found, the funk and sourness are well-integrated ... just another solid, pleasant, drinkable, good ""introductory"" wild ale from JP."
"M + D: A modest carbonation and semi-dry finish... one of my favourite aspects of these styles. Such a marvelous feel, and quite easy drinking between the tame sourness and reasonable ABV to sip with. Not too bad at all."
"Overall, a good but disappointing beer. I was really wanting to like this one. Their Calabaza Blanca is one of my absolute favorites but haven't found another from them to match it yet. Gonna keep trying though. Mild recommend. For me, probably one and done - maybe one more shot if I could easily get."
"Pretty drinkable for my first reviewed real sour. A very complicated beer that is worth seeking out."
"Notes - The initial funky sourness is akin to Bam Noire, but the subtleties of each beer are quite disparate. Enjoyable but not great."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is very noticeable and warming for 7.2%; seemed like 10%. Interesting brew, but one I would not try again. Seemed like it was missing something."
"Still a great brew though, mostly because of the funk, I'm going to chalk this one up to me being moderatly sick, and thus not getting the full experience."
"Ineresting to say the least but I'm not sure I'd want to drink more than one a sitting."
"Overall, Jolly Pumpkin is one of Americas better brewers and La Roja is definitely one of the great beers in their lineup. Highly Recommended!"
"A decent beer, my first ""American wild ale"". Tastes very similar to a flanders red to be honest, just more subdued. Definitely a sipper, i was hoping for more flavors but all i got was the cherry tartness. Overall, not a bad beer."
"drinkability is decent. this one is quite dry and lacks the sweet quality that usually comes with the fruit notes. however, the flavors are composed nicely and produce a solid profile. could be a bit lighter on the dryness, but still a good wild ale from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Two finger off white head on initial pour that fades semi slowly leaving a thick lace on the glass. Lacing is persistent. Smell is oaky sour goodness, dill, vinegar, yeast. Sour dominates the palette, really can't taste anything else, not that thats bad, what I taste is pleasing. I get some mild sweets in the back, some decent balanced carbonation. No bad."
"La Roja's above average. Definitely not a bad beer, but has a few kinks to work out. My biggest complaint is the overwhelming cherry cough syrup-type flavor. If the cherry flavor and the alcohol presence could be toned down a little, I think it'd be improved. As it is, it's just alright. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color, very very hazy. There's probably a 5cm head on top that's a yellow/tan color. It's tough to judge an american wild ale on appearance since they range so much in color (and are allowed to I suppose). The smell is like apple cider, a bit of vinegar, general sour smells, but there is a very clear scent of malty sweetness underneath. It actually smells good, but a bit different than usual, not all out sour. The taste is difficult to judge based on the classification too, from the different american wild ales I've had. This one has a very distinct bready taste. But the taste is still funky, not as sour as some, but pleasant. There's like a subtle vinegar flavor, and without carbonation, this would taste sort of like a sour red wine. Very full bodied, almost chewy. It kind of leaves a funny feeling on the tongue and roof of your mouth. Tasting it, you would have no idea that there's alcohol in it until you feel it. Overall a good beer, kind of expensive, but I'd recommend it to all."
"Jolly Pumpkin, where were you when I lived in Ann Arbor. I have yet to have a single beer that I haven't loved. This one is no exception."
"Honestly I don't try many of these, but this seems to be one of the more drinkable editions to the style."
"D: This beer bounces all over the place as you finish the bottle and I enjoy that. Reminds me at times of Flanders Red, Saisons, Biere de Garde, etc. Lacking the sweetness expected from a Flanders Red, I really enjoy this, especially at its price and availability."
"D-Not something you're likely to drink two bottles of this in a sitting. First, it's fairly expensive and second, it's more of a sipping-pay attention to it kind of beer. Still, it's very drinkable."
"This beer poured a reddish amber with a 2 fingered head and nice lacing. The smeel was of a sour ale. The taste was not nearly as sour as I was expecting from the nose, I beelve this is my first Wild Ale... it was interesting, some Kind of like a underhopped big pale ale with sour flavors. The mouthfeel seemed nice and the carbonation level might have been a little low. I drank half a bottle of this and it was my only sipper of the evening."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and clean."
"D_A sour beer that is approachable for newcomers while having enough character to excite the old hats."
"This beer is unlike any beer i've ever had. Smells like red wine, tastes like white. spices abound, makes me think of pumpkin pie with a cheap chardonnay chaser. Sour enough to make you call your mommy. Extremely complex. Whoa, dude, you just blew my mind."
"Drinkability: Not interesting enough to want to drink lots of it."
"Overall, I think some age did this beer a lot of good. Wonder what it will be like in another year."
"Reviewed on 4/22/08. Bottle, blend 12, 2007. Pours a cloudy brown with a small white head. Aroma of tart, sour fruits, some alcohol. Initial flavor of sour fruits, then in the aftertaste I got crackers, coffee, roasted meat. Certainly an interesting beer. It lacks the sweetness I've seen in other sours (not that this was a negative, just an observation). Tasty. 7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Not an everyday beer, but good for the style."
"Pours a dark amber color with foamy white head. Excellent aroma of oak, whiskey, vanilla, sour cherry, wood and dark fruit. Oak whiskey flavor along with sour cherries and dark fruit are an amazing compliment to its spicy amber flavor. Amazing!"
"Cloudy orange pour, large lasting whitish head. Astringent fruit ester, yeasty aromas. Heavy sour fruit flavors. Almost overly carbonated in the mouth. Yeasty, improves slightly as it warms with some citrus and red fruits coming through, but it is overwhelmed by the sour to me. A wild ale, but just another typical belgian triple or double. Not my cup of tea."
"tasty beer but not cheap"
"D: yes, please."
"WOW! Man do I love this beer! Not only is it my favorite from Jolly Pumpkin but one of my favorite American-man beers period."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, not bad for my first experience with an American Wild Ale. I think this style of beer is something that my palate will have to adjust to."
"D: Fantastic! This was a great beer to sit around and share. I think this would also make a great one to sit outside on a fall day. Reminds me of drinking fresh cider... but better."
"Dynamite, will definitely try this again and try other Jolly Pumpkin brews I haven't had."
"This is a good beer, with a beautiful presentation, from the label to the nose. I did finish the bottle, and will look for a younger offering, but the astringency was simply out of balance with the aroma and flavors. This certainly is a fine example of a wild ale, and worthy for all who appreciate this style."
"This is my first beer from Jolly Pumpkin and think it is great!! I look forward to trying their other offerings. Keep up the great work Jolly Pumpkin."
"Mouthfeel is over carbonated and detracts from the rest of the beer. Phenols limit the drinkability, but it does smell wonderfully. Too bad things didn't come together better."
"Very easy to drink, but flavor is complex enough to make this a sipper. Very enjoyable."
"This beer pours a dark cherry color. The head is large, billowy, and lasts until all the beer is gone. The aroma is beautiful. Bretta, dates and other dark fruits. The taste is acidic and dry, with a little oak, a good amount of barnyard, and a large amount of bretta. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with refreshingly high carbonation. Overall, this is another great beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"D- Nice funkiness. I don't know if I could drink a whole bottle, but it was nice to split it with a few BA friends."
"The scores on the individual elements don't do this one justics. This doesn't wallow in Beautiful Chemistry but I actually like its mild disjointedness. This is a very cool, complex offering."
"Is this stuff supposed to be exceptionally drinkable? I mean, it's a good sipper, and I think that's what it is trying to be. I'm going to kill a 750 before bed, but it will not be gone in 15 minutes or anything."
"(Bottle) The liquid is deep amber to glowing reddish brown with a stable, creamy off-white head. A buttery oak blanket of vanilla, coconut and mild fresh wood covers the complex aroma of moldy and dusty basement, apple, rhubarb and raspberry fruitiness, orange and mild lemony acidic citrus, red berries, mild pepper-like spicy yeast, earthy and light sweet caramelly malt, light herbal hops, mild white grape tartness and just a whisper of clove. The flavour is graceful but the oak has a minor problem - it feels a bit separated from the rest of the beer. Tones of coconut, wood, light caramel, raspberries, unripe orange and lemony citric tartness, milk, mold, white grapes, light caramel and some earth. The mouthfeel is light round and soft with a light to medium carbonation. Dry, lingering finish. Medium bodied."
"This one poured a deep, dark copper--darker than most pumpkin ales that I've had. It had a decent spicy pumpkin scent and just got better once consumed. It was sweet with lots of pumpkin with a medium to heavy body. It also left a solid pumpkin aftertaste. I enjoyed the pumpkin-red conbination very much."
"La Roja pours an amber brown color, murky, with a tall tan head, lots of sticking and noisy foam. Tart and instantly acidic barrel notes in the nose lead to a sweet malty profile with a large citrusy hop bite mid/late palate. More funky than 'sour' as its often described, and i like funky, this just seems to be a forced funk. Lots earthy notes of over ripe fruits and hay. All and all it really falls short for me, flat in flavor, almost one dimensional, wood is just a tease once the body is felt. Medium body, gueze like in nature, very bright carbonation and a seltzery feel to it. Possibly its just young? It just drops off the face of the earth mid palate."
"D - It's odd. At times with some sips, this tastes to me like a stinky cheese, but it's dry and very drinkable. One of those beers where no two sips are quite the same."
"Highly drinkable. Alcohol content is well-hidden. Call me a Philistine, but I actually enjoy this more than the more vinegary La Roja Grand Reserve."
"I could easily drink this over and over again."
"Cannot go wrong with a Jolly Pumpkin beer, have not tried this one before and wanted to before cracking open of my grand reserves, turns an amber style that I am not too fond of into a really good beer, will be drinking this one again, recommended"
"Really quite a drinkable beer; the sour flavors aren't terribly bold, making it easy to down. Good stuff."
"Funk fanatics, this is a must try. Very enjoyable. Would most assuredly buy again."
"Certainly enjoyed this one. Not too sour, not too sweet. I'm still new with these wild ales and am looking forward to trying some more from this unique brewery."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp and smooth. Light carbonation. One bottle is plenty but it is a great sipper."
"JP has some really good stuff that I had recently, this is more pedestrian."
"D: Reminds me a little of a Rodenbach but not as sour. Very well crafted and palate is extremely smooth and pleasant to drink.wow."
"with a friend if you like..."
"Not a bad beer. Well worth pairing with a piece of pepper jack cheese. Not an everyday beer, but a good bridge to more sour ales. Try some if you see it."
"I love this Flanders/American Wild Ale hybrid. The tart fruits, light sweetness, and musky funk simply makes this shine. Another great offering from Jolly Pumpkin."
"the drinkability is good is crisp and refreshing and has some interesting flemish red type flavor going on in it. a very nice american wild ale thats well worth a try."
"My first Jolly Pumpkin beer, but definitely not my last."
"Nice on its own - unique - but really shines with cream cheese covered with cherries."
"easy to drink and refreshing, and reasonably affordable."
"not too thin, with some smoothness before perceiving more acidic texture. tight, moderate carbonation."
"An excellent beer, which could easily be compared to the best of the Belgians. And a great label too!"
"d: my first jolly pumpkin, won't be my last. love the style, love the beer. not too sweet, good complexity."
"Smoothes out notably upon warming and transforms from bracing to engaging. Very nice, but I might still give Blend #10 another year to taper off."
"Lower abv and a light body make this easy to drink in hotter weather. Sour enough to make you like it, but not complex enough to make you love it."
"Nicely drinkable, I had no problem drinking the 750ML bottle."
"This was a nice beer, but a step down from what I was expecting considering how much I like Jolly Pumpkin's other offerings."
"Beer poured red with a long lasting impressive tan head. Nose is quite sour, of cherries and cranberries. Taste is complex, of sour cherries, musty oak, and the belgian yeast strain is almost champagne like leading to a very dry finish that is leaving a sour trail on the palate. Mouthfeel is champagne like, bubbly yet smooth, easy going across the palate. Drinkability is pretty good as the alcohol is well hidden. The beer is light and leaves the palate coated with the sour funk as advertised. It was fun branching out to this style and look forward to trying others!"
"D - there really isn't anything displeasing about this beer and it goes down easily. overall I'd say its a nice twist on a style that I really enjoy. It just never lived up to the initial aroma, which was amazing.."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are alright and alcohol is relatively low making for an easily consumed brew."
"Still, I did enjoy it, as I liked the sour bite. I just can't quite love it as much as I should."
"Mouthfeel is very dry with a crisp carbonation. Very tasty, though not one I would want very often."
"D: Overall I really I enjoyed this beer, if there was a catergory for drinking experience I would give this beer a five because I never wanted the moment I was drinking this beer in to end. I can say easily though that this beer is perfect for a warm, not hot, summer night with no misquitos and a small breeze. When this happens the beer is absolutly perfect. To be honest though this beer becomes a bit blander once your tongue gets used to the sourness, but still tastes good. It is a very complex beer that demands your attention and that should be paid attention to past the sourness. This one got me amped for the wild ale style. I guess this one aged pretty well."
"D: Not bad. Again the lack of a totally dominant sour taste really helped the drinkability out for me."
"Out of a 750 ml capped bottle. Pours a reddish brown color with an egg shell colored head that was thick and fluffy in the tulip glass; some nice spotty lacing. The aroma is a strong red wine, tart and tangy, lemon concentrate. The taste has red wine characteristics, lemon, sour cherries, unripe tropical fruit. The feel is light with very active carbonation, perhaps a bit too strong; finishes sour and tart. Not big on sour/tart brews so it kills the drinkability. The carbonation is a bit aggressive as well. However, this is a well built beer and anybody that likes the tart & sour should like this beer."
"a very nice beer that has a lot of subtle flavors with apples upfront and smooth caramel very reminiscent of candied apples makes it a fun, smooth, and memorable beer."
"Crisp and refreshing, but unfortunately the flavors don't get time to really marinate on the tongue the way that the best Belgian reds do. The carbonation seems to lift the flavors away at the very moment they would do well to engage the flavor receptors."
"A hazy dark oak with a silky sand colored head. The nose has a plether of tart and citrusy tropical fruits, molded yeasts and earthy manure. Very nice indeed. The taste begins mith some sweet caramel malts and delicate ripe fruit. Then an intensifying wave of tart cherries and sour apples with some oaky spices. Delicious. The body is thick and silky yet has a refreshing crispyness to it. A good example of the style. Just lacks the complexities that some of my favorite versions have. For sure one of JP's better balanced brews."
"my first am. wild ale ; pours a deep, cloudy copper-brown w/ a 1"" creamy tan (with the faintest hint of pink, i think) head that sticks around a long time, then completely coats a pair of ommegang goblets w/ lace ; an interesting (for lack of a better word), belgian-like smell, sour and vinous w/ hints of banana, cherry, apple, and oak, some perfumy spice-type notes and an alcoholic liquorish (not licorice, but also licorice) poss. cognac noted as well, very complex ; where to start, hits w/ an incredibly dry and sour pucker from the onset, thought it spoiled at first, but it quickly grew on me, has a taste very similar to smell, but with a def. sweet caramel note throughout and more accented with oak and ""stuff indescribable at this time", prob. yeast oriented ; extremely dry and light-medium bodied with a great co2 (i think) ; i'm still confused (prob. why they come in 750 ml.'s), think i love/hate this beer, but it'll be fun experimenting to find out with an ABV of 7.2..."
"D: This is an interesting sipper at 7.2% alcohol. I guess I'm not a huge fan of wild ales cause I have a feeling I'm going to have a problem finishing this glass in my currant state =P Glad I'd tried it tho, and am still looking forward to tasting their dark beers (particularly the stout)."
"Im a very big fan of wild / funky and sour ales, so i wasn't surprised i really liked this one. Another good beer from Jolly Pumpkin, to bad its so hard to locate here in NY."
"This beer pours a deep, semi-opaque burnt orange color with reddish accents in the wide-mouth goblet I'm pouring into. The head is lively and rocky, mimicking pie merange of a pale sand color. Some yeast particles are found in suspension in the glass despite a careful pour. Impressive appearance all the way around. Spots of thick lacing line the glassware as the beer's head recedes a bit. The nose is quite complex and openly betrays the fact that this beer has been aged in oak. Predominant notes of sweet rum, caramel, vanilla and spice. Despite what I've read elsewhere, I don't detect a lot of alcohol in the nose here. Mild sweet malts meet wild yeast and collaborate to make for an interesting, but slightly disjointed, combination of aromas. The palate is an expansion of the nose, hitting you with multiple flavor elements in a random attack of funk and smooth, mellowed malts. Although this beer is called a Biere de Garde, I'm not tracking with that descriptor at all. If anything, this is an odd oak-aged Flanders Red. The spicy aspects are nice and you can really taste the oak, but the constituent elements just don't quite come together for me. Very phenolic, but oddly flat at times. This beer has a bit of an identity crisis. Sufficiently carbonated, but a little thin feeling in the mouth. This improves slightly as th beer warms to ambient temperature, but still leaves something lacking. A respectable 7.2 ABV is hidden well beneath the oak and bitterness - the latter of which really lingers long on the palate. As a Biere de Garde, this misses the point. As a Flanders Red, this beer has a ton of potential and might synthesize flavors a little better given some additional aging in the bottle. I'd we willing to try this again, but would like to see it sit for a couple years and round the ragged edges. I've heard great things about Jolly Pumpkin beers. La Roja was my first sample of the Dexter, MI brewer's offerings. They didn't scare me off completely with this one, but I'd like to sample some of their other brews and hope for a little more continuity of flavor. I wanted to LOVE this beer, based on my preconceived notions, but it really didn't quite live up to the expectations I (likely unfairly) had in my mind. This was not the ""oh my God!"" beer I hoped it might be."
"Decent enough beer, but not worth the price."
"Overall, I thought this was really quite nice. The first thing I had from them was the Bam and I loved that but was not so crazy about that winter release. This on the other hand I thought was excellent and would happily purchase again any day."
"I look forward to trying the Oro de Calabaza after my next shift. I think Jolly Pumpkin is doing some really great stuff. If only we could get barrels!"
"Seriously infected bottle. Pours reddish brown with little or no head. 10% fizzed out upon opening. Smells like a sour with minimal funkiness. Smells a little ""off"" Tastes a lot ""off.' Very metallic taste, which, when combined with the sourness, comes close to putrid. Really watery with no carbonation. Drain pour. This bottle should never have been sold. I'll rerate when I get another bottle, but since this is the bottle I got, this is what I'll rate. Worst beer experience I've had in a long, long time."
"Overall: Another wonderful beer in the Jolly Pumpkin lineup. Tons of fruit flavor with just enough sour. Nothing is over the top."
"The dangerous level of acidicity in this brew makes this hard on your chest and mediocre tasting. But at least it's amazing to look at!"
"Pours a cloudy brownish red color with foamy off white head. Smell is funky, tart cherry and some musty vinegar. Taste is funky, dry, fruity, with some cherry and very faint sweetness, but predominantly dry. Decent, but certainly didn't blow me away."
"D: extremely drinkable. If you enjoy sours, then you would love La Roja. I could pretty much drink anything from Jolly Pumpkin for the rest of my life."
"Drinkability: Killer."
"Good stuff! Jolly Pumpkin is quickly becoming one of my favorite brewing companies."
"I look forward to trying more of these brews."
"Bought from South Bay Liquor. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet. Amber color with zero head. Aroma hits you with sourness at first, which fades into boozy vanilla and wood. Tastes of sourness, vanilla, and booze. Maybe a little apple tartness as well. Malts shine through on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin for some reason, and I wish there was more carbonation. An interesting beer, but I'm not sure what to think about it."
"D: ABV isn't terribly high and the carbonation makes the glass go down easily."
"Medium light body with high carbonation and a dry finish keeps the funk from overwhelming, but the oak is a little excessive and probably contributes to some astringency that keeps this bottle of La Roja from being as refreshing as it seems it should. I get the impression that a couple years of cellaring would bring the oak down, dry it out more, and marry the flavors better."
"Taste/mouthfeel - Leather, sour cherries, tobacco and moderate funky brett. Tannic, oaky and fairly sour, but not overly acidic. A hint of maple syrup appears as the beer warms, but it's otherwise very dry. Light-to-medium in body, highly carbonated and crisp. Impressive complexity without compromising drinkability. An excellent and unique beer."
"If you appreciate a very sour beer, than this one is for you..."
"Mouthfeel is very clean and this is a beer that one could drink with meals. Great with cheese and summer sausages."
"Great beer, but not one I could see myself drinking regularly."
"Overall, I think this is another very good beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"This is a very complex beer that could be outstanding but it misses the mark in several areas. First, the beer is a nice dark ruby with plenty of bubbly head, retention, and lacing. The smell is outstanding, and I thought I was going to be experiencing a genuine Flemish Red ale. This has the smell of an oak aged Rodenbach or Duchesse De Bourgogne. You'll get the nice cherry, wood aged, spicy yeast, the orange rind, coupled with some tangy vinegar. If only the taste matched the aroma, but alas no. This is a slightly over carbonated medium bodied beer. The taste has the slightly sour, tannic acid, oaky flavor of a Flemish Red, but it is not nearly puckerish enough, nor sweet enough. There is some spice to this beer in the background, but it just does not have enough oak aged, leached tannins, not enough cherry flavors either. This beer is a bit of a tease, but it is still very nice and I'm glad I ventured. I was expecting more, but what is here is still worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Pretty drinkable while still being interesting."
"D: Nope, sorry. I don't think I should try any more Jolly Pumpkin for awhile. I will eventually, though."
"Pours a muddy amber with a thin peanut butter head that quickly dissipates. Nose is oaky, merlot. Definitely oaky with some alcohol, red wines run deep, some raspberry. Some definite tannin, like chewing on a grape stem. Taste is spicy and bitter pheonols, peppery, red apple and sour raspberries. This is complex and oaky, quite astringent, dark currants and a hint of brown sugar. The finish is a bit salty and sour. Sort of similar to licking a salted lemon peel. Mouthfeel is smooth, watery and ends dry leaving the mouth with a beautiful tart after taste. First offering f/ Jolly Pumpkin and I am in love."
"This was my first experience with Jolly Pumpkin and I can't wait to try another one of their beers."
"D: Not an easy beer, but not an acquired taste... A few of these would mark a good night. This was a great night at Jose's."
"Blend 11, mixed 2007. Poured an orangey amber with red tones when held to the light. Poured a slight head, that dissipated into nothingness. Aroma is of sour pie cherries. Taste is very similar. Not as sour as I expected but more tart. Sour cherries and oak. There is definitely a bit of wood it the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescing carbonation. In the right mood, this could be a highly drinkable beer but on the same hand you have to be in the mood for it."
"The aroma continues to please, to the last drop."
"Nice sour taste but by no means over the top. Sorta reminds me of eating sour cherries in northern MI Great earthy flavors. All and all a great beer."
"First foray to this style and brewery. definitely will be back again."
"Poured a hazy amber/brown with a low head. Really nice fruity aroma with some sour cherries and anise. Starts out tart and fruity, but not nearly as sour as the aroma would suggest. Effervescent mouthfeel. There is some woody flavors and vanilla in the finish. Hint of spice. Interesting take on the style."
"Tastes of fruits (slightly tart), wood, earth, spices and lots of alcohol. Good mouthfeel and lots of carbonation."
"Nice head, nice lace, aroma of sour, citrusy aroma. Couldnt really smell any hops distinctly. Takes sort of like a Flemish sour, but not as musty and with more carbonation in the nose on bigger sips.Mouthfeel just slightly thin, but the distinctive taste that defies easy classification more than makes up for it.Different and enjoyable.Ill be getting more."
"25.4 oz. glass bottle- color of dark honey, with a thick cream colored head - nose of sour dried apricots, berries, biscuit and floral  taste of sour fruit, earthy, apricots, chalky, sand cobwebs - body is medium, and dry, and with high carbonation  aftertaste of spices, earthy, dry, and short"
"Drinkability is good. Especially scores points for being interesting. But the balance of flavors is still lacking, and this doesn't quite stack up to others in the style... namely the wild ales coming out of Russian River. Still certainly worth a try though, and I'll enjoy drinking this one."
"D- One uniquely sour and fruity red/wild ale, taste profile is on the lights side, easy to drink but likely wouldn't have too much in one sitting due to the fruity sourness"
"In the taste, I immediately notice a blast of bourbon that is much more pronounced than the last batch I tried. Very pleasant. The sourness is faint and plays well with the other mystery flavors that I cannot identify. There are obviously many components to this beer, but I just can't pick it apart. All I know is that I really like it."
"Pours a foggy orange hued brown with a creme head. Nose is all wood with some vanilla and wild yeast tones. Flavor is bitter with an earthy citrus thing going on. Very acidic wood profile overall. Feel has a bit of a biting carbonation to it and a liquid feel that is a bit thick and slick. Nice tiny drink. A bit rough on the edges, but you've gotta love a readily available wild ale."
"Pours a brownish red, big off white head on it. Smell is real tart, but the taste is mildly tart with kind of a woody caramel malt to it. Highly carbonated giving it a real spritzy mouthfeel. It's not too bad overall but I would have liked it just a bit more tart in taste to match the smell, that would have made it more interesting."
"Both flavors were difficult to describe...such is the nature of a Wild Ale, I suppose. Some sour cherries, tart citrus, and oak were present in both, but the overriding presence was the fizzy carbonation level in both ales. Besides that, the mouthfeel was dry, crisp, and bubbly. I can't say this was the easiest beer to consume, but it was well worth the purchase and well worth a try. As far as aging is concerned, it definately helps this Wild Ale become more fragrant, and a bit more flavorful. Definately give this beer 2+ years in the cellar."
"d: I'd drink these every now and then if they were available in my area. Thanks to SPLITGRIN for this one."
"Pours a clear reddish/amber with 2 fingers of off-white pillowy sticky head and great retention. Sour fruits, plum, cherry, cranberry, and some alcohol esters. Tartness, greater dryness, and the woodsy barrel notes are more apparent in the flavor. Some medicinals and a rough bitterness, not from hops, at first but grow more enjoyable as it went down. Sour cherries, vinous, burgundy wine, hints of cocoa powder, and caramelized sugar. Medium to high body, mouthfeel starts thin but ends up on the heavier yet smooth side and a carbonation thats slightly crisp and froths up pretty nicely. This won started slowly but was a winner by the end."
"I wish I had another bottle. Absolutely delicious."
"I mean, I'd be happy to have this again, I just can't imagine feeling in the mood for a beer with these flavor characteristics and wanting THIS particular beer."
"D- Absolutely wonderful. The alcohol is well hidden. Everything about this screams quality- like every beer from JP."
"This one is pretty darn good...not great but solid for those who like the style..."
"During a second tasting of this, I paired it with a dessert of poached pears with an apple cider reduction. It was delicious with it! I served the beer in a wine glass that time also."
"D: Complexity is the name of the game with this beer. By scaling back the tart side and keeping the oak at a minimum, it allowed this beer's other features to shine through. With a lot going on, it was also helped along by the mouthfeel and gentle aftertaste. For those looking to try a Wild Ale, I'd recommend this one, especially for a first go-round."
"This is probably the best beer I have ever had (at the time of writing) and I am very impressed with what Jolly Pumpkin has made here."
"This is a fantastic beer. Would be amazing with food, I could see it going well with pork....as a matter of fact I may just try that this weekend"
"Split a 750 mL bottle from Abe's in Bethlehem (for $7.50 I think) with a friend. Nice amber/brown color with some head that disappears pretty quickly, though this is quite understandable considering the funk. Everything seems good until I took my first whiff--all I got was sour milk. Taste is sour milk, alcohol and some nice malt but is very unpleasant overall. The carbonation is nice and highlights the light body of the beer. I was able to finish my glass but i can't in good conscience recommend this beer. I might try this beer again if somebody offers me a glass but I wouldn't buy it."
"P.S. The tupperware social is at 8."
"Lots of soft carbonation. A bit acidic. Somewhat dry in the finish. Pretty interesting."
"A nice drinakble beer. A pleasant sourness, but not over the top or too acidic. An oddball beer for sure, but drinkable."
"Drinkability: Where others have marked this one down for being neither fish nor fowl, I find an incredibly well-done balancing act; very nice and approachable"
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy brown/amber color, nice carbonation, one-finger foamy tannish head, some oil slicks and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, spicy, hints of cheeries, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet at first then the tangyness (cheeries) jump in. It's got the nice yeasty reminiance of Bret and some spices. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice AWA, another very tasty brew from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Drinkability: Makes me think of a light Flanders Red. Fairly nice, if a bit uncomplicated."
"I'm very glad to try another ""wild ale"" such as this. Perhaps it doesn't stack up with many of Russian River's delightful examples but you have to give them credit for trying. Definitely worth a shot..."
"D: The sourness is almost too much, and not pleasing enough to be very drinkable."
"Not everyone is a fan of wild ales, and I can understand and appreciate that. It's an acquired taste, for sure. But this is an excellent introduction to the style, as it's nicely balanced by the malt character, which mellows out the sourness. Not that it's a beginner's beer, by any means, mind you. It's just an excellent foray into a fantastic style of beers that many beer drinkers aren't fully accustomed to. In a word: phenomenal."
"Another interesting solidly crafted beer from Jolly pumpkin. I love picking up a bottle of Jolly pumpkin. You never know what you'll end up with but it will always be good."
"An interesting and very delicious ale  cheers to Jolly Pumpkin and their availability in Washington state! I look forward to trying the entire line,"
"Drinks great for a sour beer& the ABV; this is my 1st American Wild Ale. I'd just about given up on this brewery, this one takes me back to cautiously happy about their offerings, easily the best Jolly Pumpkin product I've had"
"D - An interesting change of pace. At times it feels like its a replacement for a bottle of wine on the table. Don't think I would drink more of one of these in a sitting."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip. This bottle took quite a while to pour due to intense foaming and gushing. Once I managed to get it into the glass, the ale poured a reddish brown color with a thick, fizzy, dark tan head that would not fade. The aroma was made up of cinnamon, sour apples and cherries, and some faint caramel and yeast notes. The flavor was a bit mild compared to the initial impression given by the aroma. A bit tart, but not overly sweet or sour. The barrel aging seemed to really mellow and balance this beer out. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of fizzy carbonation. This was a really nice and refreshing drink. If you are a fan of the style, it is definately worth a try."
"Large brown bottle, capped, w/o freshness info, pours medium brown, semi clear, with bubbles rising, under a looong lasting tan head, that falls to a 1/16 of an inch film (thick) and leaves heaps of thick lacing...malty, musty, earthy dense and complex nose...notes here of sour (some brett?), more earthyness, dark fruits, funk, smoke/wood, mustyness...complex, tasty brew. The yeasty, murky final bottle drain pour add plenty of sediment and more funk....bring on some stinky cheese, crusty bread, BBQ...yum, nicely crafted brew, well worth seeking out a fresh and tasty sample of this nectar"
"Pours a deep hazy copper with some definite sediment in the bottle. Good head and some lacing. The smell is of sour cherries and oak. The taste is complex with oak tannins and a funky sourness and bitterness from combined wood and hop flavors. A quite bitter finish that gives this an extra oomph. The mouthfeel benefits from the tart and bitter nature of the brew. A fairly light body, but very bif flavors. Quite refreshing whilst retaining excellent depth of flavor. Very nice beer. I think this brewery consistently challenges even Russian River for the best wild beers in America."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with an off white head. In the nose, grapes and well, sweettarts. A friuty sweet/ sourness. In the taste, earthy/ oaky and hints of dark fruits. It has a sour dry aftertaste. Nice lacing on the glass, and enjoy the sour dryness, and smooth. Like nothing else, but very good!"
"Light-medium body with high levels of carbonation. This is a beautiful beer and would make a perfect introduction to sour beers. Highly recommended."
"D: Sour beers aren't generally my thing but his one is well made and tasty and refreshing and drinkable."
"Drink ability- Interesting beer will tried this one again."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this beer. It was a bit tart which made it interesting. I will recommend this beer to friends."
"Drinkability: This doesn't do too much for me. It seems like Jolly Pumpkin made a sour amber ale just because they make all of their beers sour."
"I'm totally OK with this beer as a lambic or flemish type beer, but calling it an amber ale is blatant false advertising. It's properly labeled as a ""wild ale"" on BA, so as a flemish sour or natural lambic this beer is excellent, but as the label on the beer calls it an amber ale it tastes like shit. Despite all my negativity I actually like this beer. It might be my favorite from JP. Cum granis salis."
"As with all JP beers, you never know what you're going to get until you pop that cap, but this is a pleasant beer overall. Nicely developed and not so wild as to be distracting."
"Mouthfeel was mouthfilling. The body was medium to full but it thins out toward the end."
"750ml bottle from Florian's. Hazy brick red body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells malty, fruity, and spicy, with kind of a pithy quality to it. Tastes fruity, sour, and spicy. Very complex, can't quite put my finger on some of the qualities in the flavor. One thing I didn't notice in the flavor or the aroma is alcohol. The mouthfeel is definitely on the lower side of medium-bodied with a fair bit of carbonation, which suits this ale quite well. Very drinkable for the ABV and complexity. Reminds me of a lambic in a lot of ways. Very very good."
"Overall a very interesting beer, not one you'd be likely to have from any other brewer. Flavor, like I said, is just okay to me. Worth a try at the least."
"Mouthfeel is good. Tartness up front is complimented with a dry finish. Sits a little funny in the stomach and would rather split the 750 with someone, but this is a solid beer. Let it warm up to really enjoy it."
"750ml bomber: I opened this one up and sat it on the counter to get a glass. Big mistake. A good ooze of foam was coming out of the top. Needless to say, it pours with a decent sized tan head, that leaves a bit of lacing. The color is a darker, hazy amber. Caramel, sour apples, spices are the main scents present. The flavor is a bit sour, with some of the apple taste up front. Some caramel malts in the background. Some spiciness and a touch of dryness to the finish. A VERY nice beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The prickly carbonation pushes the limits of pleasing, as I can almost pinpoint every miniscule bubble... however this does not kill the experience. As the tasting proceeds and the beer comes to temperature, it becomes smoother and richer. I've just brought a wedge of Chimay Met Biere Trappist cheese to the table and now we're partying. This beer really has it all... the fruit, the funk, the Belgian style artisanal elements that excite the palate. Deliciously rewarding."
"This is a very drinkable sour, although the acidity might be to sharp for some, I think the clean finish tempers that nicely. Very refreshing and enjoyable."
"This one was my fourth Jolly Pumpkin beer and I was looking forward to it. The beer was a dark red-amber in color with a small white head. The smell was a little funky. The taste was very sour and tart. This one seemed almost the same as the Biere De Mars but without the nice fruity flavors. The mouthfeel was nice on this beer just like all the JP beers I've had. They definitely have the carbonation down. If I make a repeat purchase of a JP it is going to be the Oro or the Biere De Mars. This one fell a little short."
"Overall impression: Close to being very good - but whatever this metallic flavor is takes quite a bit away from this beer."
"The color is a beautiful cloudy burgundy-caramel. The head is almost sculptable. At first the flavor almost seemed like a cross between a Belgian golden ale and a Flemish sour ale, but after the first few sips the sour was really coming through, in a very satisfying way. The spiciness, with subtle oak notes, almost dances on the tongue. Nicely tart, clean aftertaste. Distinctive and recommended."
"D - Has a good bit of flavor while remaining light, but the acidity is a little too acrid for my taste and I think a little more residual sweetness would balance it out better."
"Overall, a very nice, easy-drinking, semi-sour ale. It's more reserved in the sourness with some nice complex mixes of Belgian yeast, light hops and sweet and sour notes. The more I drank of this, the more I appreciated it."
"Overall, this is a great American sour ale. I love the clean crisp oak taste at the end."
"Pours a hazed, rusted amber with a tanned head that maintains a strong presence and leaves strings of lace. Toasted sweetish malts only last so long in the nose before the brett hits. Highly acidic aromas of cranberry, cherry, and bitter oranges. Flavor reminds me of a mix of biere de garde and a flemish red, to dumb it down. Nice caramel and toffee from the malts, but the yeast has it all on lock-down. Peaches, raspberries, cherries, bananas, oranges, cranberries, and pineapple all working together with an incredibly refreshing acidity. Lots of brett funk. Mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side, but I really wouldn't go so far as to say that. Excellent carbonation that is active, but not piercing. I could drink this all night."
"It's very nice to see some great sour beers. The are satisfying and quenching and deliver eveything I look for especially in the summer. This one is a solidly balanced example. It does not over power in any one aspect and its finish balances its body perfectly. Very well done with La Roja."
"Pours a hazy copper/amber color with a fizzy light tan colored head. Head holds for a while in the tulip at its narrowist point leaving some nice lacing. Aromas of rotting crabapple, hints of vanilla and oak, malt and a healthy brett character. First thing noticable upon first sip is that it is pretty mellow. Some tartness, some caramel and crystal malt sweetness but neither overpowering each other, some champagne-like flavors near the finish. I was expecting some more sourness, but I'm not disappointed. Healthy carbonation, prickly on the tongue with the medium-to-lighter body; attenutaion seems almost complete. Dry finish with some seltzer water aftertastes. A very nice beer that I'd order again."
"The mouthfeel is a mixture of sourness and lively carbonation. It's refreshing as hell, and exactly what I expected. I was floored when I read this was 7.2%ABV, I would've guess it was six or less. This is a super-drinkable infected beer, and I'll definitely be trying more Jolly Pumpkin brews."
"Taste is tart, yeasty, bittersweet, overly harsh herbal flavor, powerful floral flavors, big peach and plum flesh flavors, peppery spice comes out with warmth. This beer starts out quite funky but things start to come together as you quaff. Overall kinda like drinking potpouri. Interesting, but not quite my style and questionable for beer de guarde if for no other reason than things are a little dark and heavy for the style."
"The beer pours a cloudy amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It smells of pale and crystal malts along with lambic bacteria. It's sour with a slight oak barrel aroma; very nice. The taste is great as well. It has a smooth bisquity amber flavor that goes down easy and finishes sour and earthy with some oakey notes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer; probably the best that I've had from these guys. I have to say that this is a Flanders red ale (says so on the bottle). I don't know who declared the style for this one."
"A 750ml bottle, capped, not corked. Poured into a tulip glass, this is a very pretty beer. Dark amber in color with a thick, persistant white head. Some lacing. Nicely carbonated. The aroma was a little difficult to get a handle on. Fruity, but also an outdoorsy, musty aroma. Fairly sour fruit taste, a little caramel in there too. I thought the beer was a trifle thin. All in all, however, a wonderful beer. Definitely will buy this again."
"Drinkabiltiy- Combo of a Goudenband and Duchesse. More malty than either though. Best american flanders I have had to date. Worth the $11.50 I dropped on it."
"Taste is spiced cherries with plenty of belgian yeast. Their is some definite sourness coming through. Kind of tart, but wonderful. I think that is the best thing about this beer. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with plenty of carbonation."
"Opinion: Well, I had high hopes for this beer, and was somewhat disappointed. I am really glad to see American craft brewers making such a difficult style, but this one seriously falls short in the mouthfeel. There is very little there to back up the dry sourness and this beer could definitely use some more support in that area. Otherwise, it is a pretty decent beer and I wouldn't mind trying it on occasion if it were available in Texas. Oh well, c'est la vie."
" Wavz"
"drinkability is good. smooth and drinkable, and a little warm on the way down."
"As an aside - being a blended beer from multiple barrels I would imagine that this beer would have quite a range of tastes. Consider yourself lucky if you are in their market!"
"You have to love the pirate kitty on the label! I admit I bought this beer because of that, but I am glad I did because the contents were a pleasant surprise."
"Attractive caramel colour with no head. Mildly sour orange or tangerine aroma. Flavour is wild yeast, brett, and mild apple/pear flavours. Fairly restrained compared to other Jolly Pumpkin beers I've tried. Good mouthfeel, rather dry. Spicy aftertaste, although I can't identify the specific flavour. Good stuff!"
"Pours a cherry-red in colour but dark with brownish hues. Some thin sheets of head that stay mostly to the outskirts. A great aroma with notes of many exotic fruits and wild yeast. The barrel aspect isn't too obvious from the smell, the oak not all that pronouced, hardly present. Flavour upfront with a very cherry tartness. Not much lingering. I'm beginning to find the wild yeast is starting to overpower the flavours in the newer Jolly Pumpkin batches. This was still plenty interesting, plenty tasty, and plenty enjoyable like all the Jolly Pumpkins I've tried."
"Thanks for the trade Frozensoul327!"
"this is adventurous, challenging, rewarding, superbly-crafted beer."
"Big beautiful bottle gives birth to a big, beautiful, creamy, dense, rocky, light dirty tan head over a slightly murky, dark copper apple cider body. Nose is rife with tingling, sourish, tart cherries, lemons, and cider apples. Noticeable brett. Light powdered sugar and toffee/caramel along with some spice in the background. Taste starts out unsurprisingly tart and acidic with notes of lemon, vinegar, tart cherries and unripened raspberries. Delicious and refreshing acidity stays while hints of toasted caramel and light cookie malt come through. Some wood, metal, smoke and indeterminable spice as well. Very dry finish shows more malt than I expected backed by lemony brett funk tartness. Medium-bodied with a dazzlingly effervescent feel that really lifts the sourness off the palate well. Very well done. An amazing beer!"
"Pours a musty brownish orange with a frothy white head. Smells fruity and sour with some earthy tones. Kinda like a fermented orange juice. Taste is harsh up front with the sour throughout, with some sweet tones and fruity notes. This is a hard beer to read. The mouthfeel is lighter with a good amount of carbonation. This one is hard to drink if you are not used to the style, but a good beer for the style. A beer worth checking out especially if you are looking for something different. Enjoy!"
"This started with a frothy, deep-tan head that quickly dissipated. The color was a lightly-cloudy deep red. The nose had notes of coconut, must, and white wine. The mouthfeel was rather thin, but really effervescent and palate cleansing. The taste was vinous, dry, and slightly brett-driven. The finish was likewise dry. This was a pretty good offering from one of my favorite brewers, but not destined to be a top favorite of mine."
"D- This is the most wild beer from JP and my favorite so far. The flavors are mellow but you can taste and smell the wild yeast qualities. It goes down very smooth and as lots of nice depth and character even if they are hard to describe."
"Pours out a nectarine amber. Lots and lots of head- in fact was a bit of a gusher. I had to jam a wine stopper in the top of the bottle to keep it under control. Smell is sour and funky. Taste follows suit. Quite interested. Dry woody finish and high carbonation. The carbonation matched the style. After a couple of glasses into this bomber I really noticed that it was a dry white wine finish- very unique and an enjoyable brew."
"Interesting, I'd like to try other Wild Ales, but they seem so hard to get."
"It pours a hazy red-brown with abundant finely beaded head. It smells sour with some sweetness. It is decidedly sour-smelling, unadulterated by maltiness, and a bit harsh. Mouthfeel is a bit puckery, tinged with alcohol, and a bit like a big red wine. A good beer for bigger, more sour beers."
"Tingly mouthfeel upfront, dry and clean, finishing a little tannic and powdery. Tiny bubbles tickle the insides of the cheeks."
"This is a delicious beer. I love the sourness. The downfall is that mouthfeel. I've never gotten such gas. I feel like I just drank some of Mr. Wonka's Fizzy Lifiting Soda - Or whatever that was called. I'd certainly drink this again and look forward to my next bottle, but the mouthfeel really took away from this."
"Damn how cool is it to see Jolly Pumpkin showing up here in the Buffalo area!This is one of the few offerings suprisingly that I havent tried from JH till today,this poured a light hazed amber/brown with a tight well formed light brown head in my oversized wine glass.The barrel aging shows with hints of vanilla and wood with some lactic sour notes.Very food friendly but flavorful starting out with notes of grape and brown sugar with quite a hefty sour acidic finish but not not to much,yeasty esters thruout.A very nice beer from the home state I like a good Biere de Garde if it can be found and this is quite nice,oh and did I say food friendly?"
"Finishes tart and dry, with lingering barnyard character and watering jowels."
"D - Good. This is an easy drink to down and to savor. I would have to say this is a beer to enjoy by itself. One should also be made to understand exactly what it is before consumption. I will have to have this beer again. Not to mention more Jolly Pumpkins. I love their brewing philosophy."
"Sour tangerines, grapes, musty oak, spicy clove, and coriander make up the complex aroma of La Roja. Orangeish brown in color, with a persistent white ring and very fine bubbles across the top of the beer. Mellow flavors of sour grape skins, some spice, vanilla and as it warms sour cherries make up the flavor. Dry, thin, high carbonation, and somewhat astringent. An excellent brew from my new favorite American brewery."
"Notes: Well, that was an interesting experience. It will keep me captivated for other beers from Jolly Pumpkin and another biere de garde, but I don't think this will become one of my long time favorites."
"I bought a 750ml bottle of this to share with some friends and fellow BA members but was busy the day of the event so a couple of weeks later I have decided to share it with myself. The appearance of this beer was very nice a dark red and orange color with lots of little tiny bubbles and a nice two fingers of head sitting on top that slowly dissipated. I breathed in the aroma and thought what a strange smell it was hard to notice anything but some sour fruit and alcohol. So I gave it a taste and thought is this stuff bad because I was told it was sour but this tasted like rotten apple cider. I wanted to be sure so as I continued drinking cautiously and noticed the lack of after taste and it wasn't making me sick. I kept thinking to myself I should have shared this with somebody more experienced with this style because I believed it to be an acquired taste."
"The body is light with the dry flavor and carbonation rather high as well. Really this feels like a Flanders Red with the fruit and tart textures. Whatever you want to call, the cats got style."
"Quite a nice beer, and well enjoyed. While it is listed as a biere de garde, it is also much like a Fladers red. I'd consider this to be a good introduction to sour beers. It's not sour enough to turn most people off, but just sour enough to peak some interest. Be warned, this is no duchess, but a solidly crafted brew here in America. I look forward to trying some of the other beers from Jolly Pumpkin, as this gets my thumbs up!"
"This is a high-quality offering, i've tried it many times and never experienced an ""off bottle"". It's at the top of my JP list, a 4-way tie with Oro, Bam, & Firefly for the top spot. Unique and recommended..."
"Overall, pretty good. I'll drink it again."
" orB: have it with a meal."
"Not too carbonated considering the style. Nice light-medium body. Perfectly balanced with the beer. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a medium-ranged ABV but drinks like Kool-Aid. Very refreshing and incredible, I love everything I've had by JP."
"Biere de Garde? Some things about it say yes... some things about it say no."
"Picked up this bottle on atrip to RI. Im splitting it chilled and pouring into a snifter. The beer pours a hazy chestnut hue and is a little foamy with 5cm of beige head even with a very gentle pour. The aroma is big with red grapes and tart cherries mixing with some general booziness. The first sip reveals an average body with silky texture and very fine yet tingly carbonation. Flavor is rich and fruity with red grapes and cherry tartness again. There is lots of wooden oak flavor and bready yeast too. I even get a bit of flemish red lactic action to add to the tart cherries. NO hint of the ABV. very drinkable and complex. QUite a nice beer!"
"La Roja means ""the red"" for a reason. Lots of dep leathery red hues. Nice and gunky looking with some mil yeasty haze. You can still see the carbonation and the head retention is pretty good throghout the entire beer. Plenty of barnyard smells intermingled with lightly toasted malts in the nose. The tase is a mix of light riding blankest, hay, sangria, and Domaine DuPage. But much more close to the real framhouse style. The middle is a but sry while the fginish is a bit bread. Like sourdough."
"M & Dr - very effervescent with a somewhat dry medium body that is very quenching. Not overpowering but just right. This stuff is a treat and i hope it keeps making its way to So Cal."
"Strange brew - and one worth exploring further."
"Huge dark red body with a loosely knit light brown head that left nice lacing. The aroma and taste of the beer was very malty with a dusty wooden aroma and taste that was reminded me of a carpenter's work shop. It also had a slight hops profile. Now to what was truely nice about the beer. With the spontanious fermentation it gives it a lovely sour tanin note to it that reminds me of a nice red wine. It was had the taste of a sour lemon hard candy. The tartness of the beer made the cheeks pucker every so slightly. It was a refreshing summer beer for that was absolutely wonderful."
"Definitely a different beer, but down right tasty."
"Appears a clouded ruby amber brown...I guess at this point it's safe to call it mahogany. Forms an effervescent light tan head that leaves at least two fingers worth of foam. Very nice presentation as it the head dwindles a collar of lace is left with each sip, leaving all senses appeased includinig the visuals. Aroma has tart cider oak barrel notes, it's almost perfumey in nature enticing to say the least...vinous as in from the vine notes run rampant as well. Amongst the poetry of aromatics this beer has to offer, comes an amazing spice mix and funky wild barnyard notes, in the words of Vince Vaughn's character in Swingers this beer is ""so money"". Taste definitely rings in with a rolling crescendo of different flavors, bready at times with hints of charred oak some bitterness from herbal hop bursts entwined with a caramel inspired malt profile. WIth thos spice additions delivered from the heavens above, also comes the backbone of the flavor profile that tart cider character. Delicious on multiple levels not much left to report here. Mouthfeel...this is beer that captivates your palate with it's medium body and fine carbonation it really goes down much too smooth. This is beer really captures the Belgian style ales mouthfeel that most American brewers have a hard time recreating and I'm guessing this is being pulled off with all of the traditional brewing methods. Drinkability is excellent on both in number and leaving me to desire more of the incredible flavors melded in this brew. This Haiwaiin/Spanish speaking individual up in Dexter, MI has not disappointed me yet and so far I've had the Bam biere, Blanca, Oro de Calablaza, and the Luciernaga all incredible I really admire these products."
"It poured a nice amber color with a nice head. Nice carbonation as well. The aromas that I picked up wre ones of apples and pears. Sour. The mouthfeel was really nice. Reminded me of a French cider with its fizzy notes of tart apples. Funny thing though, after the first taste, your mouth keeps asking for more. Overall, a nice beer. Quite unique in its taste. I do recommend to try a second gulp if the first one was not successful."
"750 ml capped bottle."
"This is an explosive cherry-berry dyed henna with sour bursts. The alkie content is elevated and a cranberry cocktail bomb explodes from the foamscud and makes ruin of the common lot beer and lambics as well. Fresh fresh fresh in your mouth like a miniature Hiroshima making fruit-spice armageddon. Ron Jeffries will make a drunk of me yet."
"Pinkish amber body was clear to begin with, and the carbonation was very high, which caused a large three finger head to rise up above it. The smell was sour (both lemony and lactic) and earthy, with a hint of wood. The taste was dominated by Brettanomyces tartness, which proceeded into a lemony dryness with a minor floral hops flourish. As the beer continued to breathe, the funky effect started to wear off a bit, and more fruity sweet malt flavors like pear, and green apples started to emerge. Quite soft on the palette despite the high carbonation, the viscosity of the body was just right to allow the flavors to linger on the tongue. Well balanced and easy to drink, I had no problem getting though this 750 ml. bomber, despite the 7.2% ABV strength."
"more acidic tarntess come through in the flavors, with some spices. expanding my horizons a little, here. thank you jolly pumpkin"
"Overall a really tasty and interesting beer that I enjoy alot but is not neccssarily a great session beer, my only other qualm with it is that the carbonation could be a little smoother and creamier."
"I doubt this beer would make a great session beer. It is a little high in alcohol, and it has an aggressive flavor. Thank you MABZ for giving me the chance to try this one."
"After its release from the 750ml brown bottle, the beer sets a nice clear mahogany color, the head is portly in size and a nice light tan color, the texture creamy, also has some little chunks of yeast in suspension, the lace formed after the erosion of the head is a concealing curtain to drape the glass. Nose has a nice hint of cherry, sweet with malt, crisp and clean, a treat for the senses, start is lightly sweet, the grain profile perfect, the top middling in its feel. Finish is sternly acidic, the hops pronounced in their spiciness, somewhat sour aftertaste lingers long on the taste buds, a very nice beer, and one certainly worth a sample."
"Drinkability: This is a beer to explore and enjoy; extremely complex and very drinkable."
" Palate is again heavy on the sour tendencies, but at the same time fairly well-balanced. The sweet malt has an almost caramel character, offset slightly by a mild hop presence. The sourness comes through along with some tart fruit and a little bit of citric astringency. Body is well-carbonated and richly creamy. The alcohol is well-hidden and only noticeable as I near the bottom of the bottle. A tasty offering from an innovative brewer."
"Bottle: Poured a medium brown color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of brett is quite powerful a not the best of mix with the spices that are included in here. Taste is really weird it start with some great sourness and oak which is all ok at this point but when the spice kicks in it really doesnt provide an enjoyable overall mix. Body is also a bit thin but carbonation is quite lively. I really enjoyed the JP beers that I had but I just dont think this one is a good mix."
"Kind of a mess and difficult to finish the bottle. Was hoping for more given their other offerings."
"A style I've grown to enjoy and this is a nice example although I may be spoiled by the incredibly complex Russian River products. This is enjoyable and to me its in the same zip code but not the same ballpark. If you can find it....buy it."
"drinkability: 750ml will not be a problem"
"From a gushing, exploding bottle, pours a cloudy amber color. Fluffly white head sticks around forever. Aromas are super estery and fruity. Also the funk of yogurt is picked up. Sweet maltiness appears with some hops to support. Brett makes a strong appearance giving a good lambic quality. This is a really amazing beer overall with a very distinct flavor."
"Poured a tall, foamy, dirty wheat colored head. Smells like tart cherries and coconut. Thats what it tastes like too. I think the coconut might be burboun. The cherry is quite tart, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is light, but quickly overrun by the sour cherry. Interesting, but not very enjoyable. I dont think Ill be drinking another of these."
"While many have seemed disapointed with this offering, I am impressed with the wonderful complexity and grace shown by this bottle. I'd love to pair this with a friend and about 8 ounces of aged Maytag Bleu."
"Drinkability: Like I said before this beer had a very unique and acquired taste. If you don't like sour tart beers then you probably wouldn't like this beer. I like sour tart beer and that's why I really enjoyed this beer and polished off the entire 750 by myself. A nice way to celebrate the birthday of a cat with a beer that shares a variation of his name! Happy birthday Pepeton's cat Erik!!! If your bored, drop a beermail to Pepeton and congratulate the birthday of his cat!!! He'll appreciate that. :-)"
"In that respect, mission accomplished."
"A nice brew. Exquisitely complex with lots of body. A slow sipper thats sure to raise some eyebrows for those who like beers that tend to be like wine. Which I tend to think this is. Cuz I swear I had a glass of white wine(Chardonnay) that taste just like this the other night. Weirdly interesting stuff."
"Cheers!"
"All said, an enjoyable brew that I seemed to like more than most, oh well, Ive never been mainstream or popular, so what the heck?! Despite its shortcomings, I like it. Cheers Joe!!!"
"D: More good work by JP. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Redish brown color with a tan head. Heavy streams of carbonation. Smell is initially sour cherries which is followed by oak aged whisky flavor. Also get a hint of yeastyness. Taste also starts our sour but then the caramel malt flavors take over. Also a hint of peppery spicyness comes out. Somewhat fizzy mouthfeel due to the high carbonation level. This is my first Jolly Pumpkin and while it didnt' blow me away it left me wanting to try others. It borders on being something special but falls just short. I anticipate that one of their brews is going to hit the mark with me."
"A good, solid brew. It pours a dark ruby with a great head and very bice carbonation. Smell is very interesting...malty, sour cherries, oak, whiskey? Tasete follows the same line as the smell, with a very nice tart quality. Mouthfeel is nice, with a very nice dry finish. Not too bad on the drinkability scale, either..great dry finsih makes me want for more."
"Drinkability: Well, this beer is just eccentric enough to not be A) Good or B) worth the money for the bottle."
"750 ml bottle. Pours an earthy red tone with a thick, pillowly light tan crown. A tad bit hazy with good head retention. The aroma has hints of plum, citrus, and spice. I find the flavor quite difficult to discribe. It is tart, sour, and citrusy, with maybe a hint of caramel and malt. Very unique, unexpected taste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good."
"Served from a 750 ml bottle at a cousins wedding over the weekend. The beer poured a redish/orange color, a bit hazy, with a bubbly body and a bit of a white head. The aroma is a bit tart and citrusy. The taste is bready and zesty with citrus notes but not as much as the aroma. The body is medium and quite drinkable."
"Dim scarlet red. Small beaded streams of carbonation rise very rapidly. The light tan head is fluffy and airy. Good retention is noted. Lacing is quite nice. Aroma is funky, sour, vinegar like and a little vegetal. Flavor is sour, vegetal, funky, tart, acidic, tannic and really not that appealing to me overall. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated. Fizzy feel to it. Airy and a bit gaseous. Light body. I'll pass."
"Slightly hazed, deep orange/red colour with clumpy, off-white head. Good retention. Light caramel and toffee aromas play well against some wood and vanilla, giving it a definite whiskey character. Flavour is on the sweet side with plenty going on - caramel, vanilla, oak, apples, sour cherries, tobacco. A light, balanced tartness is evident throughout and pulls all these flavours together. Medium body and carbonation, sligthly creamy. Quite interesting - this one really worked for me."
"Pours a slightly hazy red/orange, medium white head, goes pretty fast, but leaves lots of spider web lacing, settles to a ring. Smell is bourbon, vanilla and oak, caramel, some sour acidity and citrus in the finish. Taste is tart and acidic, caramel, oak and vanilla, bourbon, some more citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Really different and really nice, not what I was expecting from it, but Jolly Pumpkin can do no wrong in my mind. Thanks DrJay!"
"Murky ginger brown appearance, nice thick head with lots of substance to it. laces thickly, like steamed milk. Tart aroma, fruits but with some warmth alongside, somewhat like lots of perspiration in woolen socks. Light body, carbonation is plenty active. Quick sense of yeasty funkiness and astringency, cherry flavors, but with an ever-present backing of unsweetened chocolate, enough to catch in the back of the throat. Some decided senses of toasted Wheat Chex. What strikes me most about this beer is an early complexity with aroma enhancement, but a relatively simple and diminished close to the profile. Certainly not a run-of-the-mill brew, I'll leave the sense of ""charm"" to the cheerleaders. Good drinkability, nothing is offensive, despite thinking more was coming."
"Well, this is my least favorite of the Jolly Pumpkin offerings that I have tried. It's not a bad beer, but just a bit off for the style. The sourness is more what I would expect from a lambic."
"La Roja pours semi-murky brown with a good dose of head. On the nose is raisin, complex malt aromas, and big-time alcohol. These elements find their way onto the palate as well, with raisin and alcohol -- you know, the usual. A generous dallop of malt is chased by more of that boozy goodness. La Roja drinks quite smoothly. No reason to turn this one down."
"I'm definitely also enjoying the mouthfeel. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable, even though it is a bit on the funky side. Definitely worth a look."
"Drinkability: The ale is drinkable, although the sour notes can be a bit much after a while."
"This poured into a oint glass with a deep orange/copper hue. Unfiltered with a slight chill haze. The aroma is that of a wet blanket, musky. The taste is unmistakenly tart, just like any other spontaenously fermented brew that I've had! It's a little bolder with it's malt content, but the tart dominiants. The mouthfeel is slick like yogurt coating your entire mouth. All that being said I think one shared (750 ML) is enough for a sitting. An interesting brew to try."
"Dark Red. Aroma is very medicinal, and shows caramel, pit fruit, malt and subtle hopping. This has a distinctive house character that I also noticed with Oro De Calabaza. Its unique, or weird, either one. Notes of wine stained oak, caramel, medicines, cherries, toasted malts and noble hop (algae, herbs). Just like others, I see a lot of potential with Jolly Pumpkin but nothing I have had so far has been exceptional."
"Edit 03 Sep 06. I have to say that every time I revisit this beer there's always somethig different about the flavor than the previous bottle. The oe I'm drinking now is more sour/tart than any of the previous bottles that I've had, and I like just as much as I have in the past, even with the differences. Ron's beers always seem to be an adventure."
"I will be going out tommorow in the AM to pick up more of this fine brew. What she lacks in looks she delivers where it counts. outstanding."
"Just got done rating this and duhhhh bourbon really comes out as this warms. Dont know how I missed that."
"I recommend this, but only if you like sour beers."
"This is yet another phenomenal American brewed belgian from Jolly Pumpkin. Brewers like Jolly Pumpkin really make me question whether lambics like Cantillon can only be made in the Seinne valley. This is as authentic as it gets for American belgians."
"At first I thought this beer was an amber ale with te flavor. Malty sweet with some peppery and spicy tones around the edges of the tongue. Very thin in flavor. Also has a wooden flavor that reminds me of my 7th grade woodworking class. Slightly dry and very watery mouthfeel. Oddly enough for such a huge head on the beer there was very little carbonation in the mouthfeel. Just kind of a strange beer."
"Overall: Warning: not for the novice. Very oaky with a lot of scotch like flavors. A solid offering, but not to my liking. Perhaps I am not experienced enough to fully enjoy this brew myself. I enjoy Jolly Pumpkin and will revisit this after a few more years of beer education."
"Drinkability is great this is wonderful wish I had some more stashed away. Thanks to Brian700 for this treat hope they expand Dist soon."
"Overall a nice beer and interesting, but I did not prefer it. Too fizzy and juicy. Tasted like carbonated cherry juice. Oak aging was evident and made the beer complex and interesting. Try another Jolly Pumpkin beer to support local and avant-garde brewing!"
"Gorgeous in the glass, dark garnet with a stubborn beige head with some lacing. Smell is tart cherries (but not so dark) and alcohol. Wood enhanced cherries, tart, hot alcohol and a light mouthfeel prevent this from being satisfying. Maybe I'm confused by the style: this doesn't seem like a strong dark Belgian. More like a Oud Bruin or this new category American Sour Ale. I think I would grade it better for those styles. The drinkability is ok. My disappointment was high as I expected a spicy malty Belgian style. As the beer warms some of the spice makes itself known, but the sweetness just isn't there for me."
"An interestingly funky beer. Cidery sweet/tart character is dominant, with some oak tannic notes in the background. Seems rustic, but not to say that it is crude or unrefined - to the contrary, it seems very authentic and directed toward a sort of farmhouse simplicity/complexity with funky flavors drifting about. The abv is well-integrated. This is one would like best paired with appropriate food, as I think this would play better with others than alone."
"The alcohol is a bit too assertive and drowns out some of the complexity, but good depth and use of malt. I prefer the Biere de Mars over this, but it is still another tasty offering from Jolly Pumpkin."
"750 ml capped bottle pours a cloudy reddish brown color with a creamy light brown head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Spicy, fruity aromas with the faint smell of bourbon, chocolate, caramel, plum and clove flavors. Medium bodied with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel, finishes on the dry side."
"Quite a cloudy and dark reddish color, near brown. Smells strongly of brown sugar, with some fruity undertones. I like the phrase Dirtyrhamb used, ""rum-soaked fruits," for the taste. Vinuous, fruity with apples and cherries, with strong flavors of oak and vanilla. Don't really get much hoppiness. Lots of barrel aging flavors in the finish. You know what? I like this beer a lot, great to hang out with and sip. The flavor doesn't really jump out at you, but it's complex and enjoyable."
"An interesting sidenote: the Jolly Pumpkin website lists this as a biere de garde rather than a belgian dark ale."
"This just isn't doing it for me. Very rough around the edges and not very attractive in most respects. Not trashing it, it just could be so much better if the oakiness was toned down... a lot."
"Overall, the bomber was a bit too much in and of itself. Would have been better in a snifter with a tart. Didn't pair up overly well to a spicy Italian hoagie (should've went for something hoppy). Wouldn't mind trying this after it sits in the cellar for a year or two to mellow."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a rush of carbonation that attacks the palate with each sip. Pretty easy to drink overall..however the flavors seem to be fighting against each other. Not one I'd seek out again and honestly my least favorite in the JP line so far."
"I'm fascinated by the Jolly Pumpkin ales that I've sampled. Exceptionally crafted, highly complex, and dangerously drinkable. Very different, and worth seeking out."
"An intesely flavored beer. Pours a solid rust-amber color with a haze. Head fell to a trace but laced well. Smells seriously fruity and tart with a woodsy musky aroma. Flavors of raspberries and cherries shine in the foreground, the rounding out with a Flanders Red smoothness and lightness. Remains Granny Smith apple tart into the finish. Picks up a little of a Framboise flavor, aroma, and tartness, just not as sweet. Remains a bit musky and oak-ey in flavor. Finishes a bit astringent and a tart dryness. Still, a complex and flavorful beer."
"The barrel-aging really just ruins this. It's too bright and forward, and lets precious little of the beer shine through. What they provide it not congruent to the beer itself, and the result is something that is muddled and atonal if not downright ugly. I suspect these are new, and just too intense, After a couple more run-throughs, these barrels might work perfectly. And maybe this would be a whole new animal then, but I suspect the malt-bill is needy as well. Simply put: on the whole, it needs help. It is interesting for a second or two....then it becomes work."
"Overall, this is a fine beer. Took a bit of adjustment to get used to, but once that happened drinking the bottle was not a problem. Of course this is a sipper, to be enjoyed every once in a while, and not a normal session beer."
" The mouthfeel is thick with flavor and body. The drinkability is limited only by availability."
"Beer is good. Happy artisianal beering."
"Pours an orange/red color with a thick and foamy light beige head. Lacing is pretty minimal. Loads of spices in the aroma, as well as caramel and vanilla. Medium-bodied and sour at first but nicely rounded out with sweet fruit and malt. There is a light alcohol singe too. The finish is lively with spice and toasted malt. Pretty enjoyable."
"In this beer's defense, it does get a bit sweeter and less yeasty at it warms. I would not recommend serving this one too cold."
"Pours a nice clear deep amber color witha 3 finger head that falls slowly leaving tons of sticky lace on the glass. Nice looking brew. The smell is dark fruits and cherries, almost almond. Lots of sweetness and malt. I'm interested. The flavor is a let down. I was expecting more sweetness and spice. I actually get a lot of aclohol there, which interferes with the flavor. The beer is slightly nutty and raisiney, but just overall lacking. The feel is light moderate with an active carbonation. I'd ike to see more thickenss in the brew. Overall, I'm not as impressed as I expected to be. The nose really did it for me, but the flavor and mouthfeel really fell short. I don't see myself going back to this one any time soon."
"Pours a red color with a huge head that has great retention and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is fruity with some caramel and a lot of sweetness - there is also some spice that I don't know how to describe. Possibly a port or sherry aroma - this is the best I can come up with. The flavor isn't nearly as impressive as the aroma. It's nice with some nutty character and some biscuit, but it could use some other character. Finish is dry. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is pretty good."
"The mouth is a bit rough from the tart citric flavors and some of the carbonation. Good beer, but my least favorite from JP."
"Clear dark red color body with a tan fluffy head that left a good bit of streaky lacing. Sweet ripe fruit notes, a bit of spiciness and some caramel make up most of the aroma. Light yeast notes as well. Big sweet caramel covered fruit flavor starts it off. Some dark fruits with a bit of peppery spiciness underneath. A bit yeasty and some sugar notes. Ends with a spicy fruit finish. Lively creamy feel and a bit dry at time. Really easy drinking and enjoyable. Plenty going on here but its not going to overpower you with big flavors which is nice sometimes."
"I want to love the Jolly Pumpkin beers, I really do. They've certainly done their homework on presentation: great brewery name, beer names, labels, bottles, etc. Ultimately, though, the contents of those bottles is the only thing that matters. I have little doubt that with a few years under its belt, this will be a better (if still not a great) beer. Right now, I can't recommend it. Thanks to deejaydan for the bottle."
"Light body with carbonation that absolutely explodes on the tongue. Great beer with dinner. Not super quaffable, but nice."
"I noted active carbonation and a nice texture to the mouthfeel. There was a bit of a sting in the end, and a very yeast aftertaste, but overall, a very nice beer."
"Overall, i thought this was an enjoyable translation of the style and will stock it in our store and take it home on occasion."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Can't wait to have this one again."
"My initial reaction was that this beer tatsed more like wine than any beer I've ever had. After a little while, it was dominated by a familiar taste, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then, it hit me.... Jim Beam! After that, it was so dominant - I finally had to stop. Halfway through the 750, I had to pour it out. It was starting to make me sick. Amazing that this is a relatively low ABV beer, because the whiskey flavor is all I could taste. I like beer, not whiskey. Not for me."
"Pours an amber-red hue with a luscious, thick white head. The aroma at first seems accented by caramel with a hint of oak, but later on I notice a hint of black licorice. Almost a quarter-inch layer of foam stay puts as I take in the aroma for several minutes. The mouthfeel of this first sip is very soft; the mouthfeel feels a bit thin at first, but gets thicker towards the finish. Some lacework is left as I take a few sips. The sublime caramel and toffee malt flavors in this beer are almost over-powered by a brazen rum-like middle, but the finish is coated with a hint of earthy spice (anise perhaps, or a hint of nutmeg?) coated in candy sugar. There's some bitterness from hops, too, which tends to express itself more as the beer warms up. I like this one quite a bit. I also have to admit I like the buccaneer kitty kat featured on the label."
"This is a very interesting brew. It's not an everyday beer, but one for a special occasion. This would probably be a good beer to give a person who's fond of red wines."
"Drinkability is good in terms of finishing the bottle. I likely wouldn't crack another one with any haste. Nice. Remarkable."
"Taste: Just a round, enveloping rush of booze, not much hops or yeast that I was expecting. Mouthfeel was quick and acrid like a shot of vodka."
"Active carbonation gives a pleasant mouthfeel, and it's sufficiently drinkable considering the alcohol. There's a lot going on, but overall, it's kind of underwhelming."
"Cheers!"
"Finger licking good!"
"Overall, a very good beer. The flavors meld well, and this is a fine example of the style."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy reddish brown, with a light tan head. aroma, plums, carmel, fruity, yeast hints of grapes and alcohol, and a sourness finishes it off, a very enjoyable aroma. flavor, fruity with a nice blend of caramel, yeast , plums and sour grapes."
"Slàinte!"
"Very drinkable, this brewery is already producing phenomenal beers, I can't wait for the future!"
"Very satisfying, thanks Wohlfs. Refreshing spices. Rum whiff. Well carbonated. All taste. Lots of different malts. Licorice, corriander, rum, bourbon, fennel, fruit. Another bottle two years later and in particular sour, more than I would expect from a biere de garde and great looks from lace and head."
"Ruby reflects on a brown background. Nicely cloudy. Off-white cover. Earthy, musty cellar flavors comprises a generous fruitiness underneath (grapes, apples, pears). Mellow tart aspects, cloves and earthy dryness in abundance. Mellow barrel notes, possibly the most obvious of the 4 JP and definitely the driest. Cork flavors, bitter finish. Soft and elegant gentle bubbles accompany the lenghty finish. Very cohesive. Im with Mat. That brewery has seized the meaning of crafting like no other and in the car state of all places!"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a frothy 1 1/4"" of creamy beige head over the murky deeply reddish amber brew. Head lasts, and laces well with foamy remnants. Aroma is of slightly spicy yeasts, with barrel notes easily noted, although I almost wish they were a bit more in the background. Taste is initally a somewhat fruity spice bread, which traipses into oak-land, and then returns with a dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, very creamy, which keeps the aging notes from completely taking over, and the drinkability is great. Another good one from Jolly Pumpkin..."
"If you've wondered what a barrel-aged double would be, well this is it. Unlike the other JPs, that are just touched with the barrel aging, the barrel is a serious part of the flavor in this beer. This is enjoyable, and unlike a barrel-aged tripel, the double is a little more robust and sits a bit better with it. Once again, maybe I'll make my obligatory call for JP in Pennsylvania :). Fairly enjoyable, and this is one I'd gladly have again!"
"A picture of wild swings is not what I'm drawing - most of the time this beer falls somewhere between the poles. But, these extremes do exist and can be appreciated if you are lucky enough to regularly enjoy the fruits of the Pumpkin. Giving this beer a numbers to describe is rough - its the definiton, at least in my head, of artisanal and I'd like to leave it as such. Screw the ratings and read the reviews."
"Ultimately, I think that this beer is a little out of wack, it is sort of in the gray zone between conventionally fermented single yeast strain fermented beers, infected beers, and beers that are fermented purposefully with wild, yet house derived character. This beer needs to decide which way it wants to go, and I would certainly be in favor of it going fully funky, if it can be kept in balance. Right now it is certainly interesting, certainly drinkable, and even enjoyable, but it seems a bit muddled by various competing fermentation by products. I could see a bottle of this beer being laid down for a year or two and becoming quite stellar, if not intriguingly different. While I am being quite critical here, this is a beer that I am quite enjoying, and I will look forward to procuring some more bottles of this beer. Cheers to Jolly Pumpkin for pushing the boundaries in the middle of America, and cheers to my personal Santa who delivered this treat to my doorstep."
"There are just too many off-flavors here...the alcohol is too strong, the window cleaner fusels, the cardboard finish....tastes like a 70/30 mix between the god-awful Ommegang and the great Maudite. I was excited to try a new Belgian-Style brew from a Michigan brewery, but go ahead and pass this one up...it sucks ass."
"The beer opens a little watery without much flavor to begin. Then the taste is very rich with sweet apple rind dominating. There are also notes of lime, orange, corriander, and plum. There is pretty much no hop bitterness to this beer. The beer is smooth on the palate with a light to medium body. It is an excellent beer that I would gladly enjoy again and again."
"This is a great beer, and the first from this brewery that I have tried. I will be trying more from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Drinkability is very good. The sweet sherry notes make it very unique. If your tastes lie on the sweeter side you will love this beer."
"At first taste, I didn't think I'd like this beer as much as the Oro de Calabaza. Near the end, I knew I'd like it at least as much. Now, I can't wait for the next one. As far as I'm concerned, this is a truly great beer."
"This beer pours a brillian auburn color with yellow highlights and a small foamy tan head. The nose is a bit on the weak side with notes of toasted malts, spice, and cherry liquer. The taste begins with a fruity flavor which is mainly cherry but there's also some banana phenols and red grape tannins in here, like a hefeweizen meets merlot mixture. The toasted malts are here as well but get overwhelmed by the alcohol flavor. This is like spiced rum at times. The alcohol gets too strong and I feel it towards the finish. The yeasty aspect is not quite there in the finish but I do notice a slight earthy flavor in the middle that is probably from the yeast. Body is medium and not too lively. This beer has excellent potential but is simply too young right now. Try it in a year and it will be fabulous. But for now, stick with the Oro de Calabaza."
"Boozier than the squash beer previous. Tempting aromas of caramel coated grape bubblegum on a bed of greens. Hard edged unpeeled fruit stand out against a backdrop of gingerbread house with the iced roof and gum drop gate. More mature ""The Red"" might flow easier. I hope that Jolly Pumpkin is around in five years for a new/old taste comparison."
"Good heavens, what a beer. This one demands your attention as soon as you sip it. This would be hazardous as a session beer, since it is not hard to drink but fairly strong."
"Jolly Pumpkin...Nicely done."
"I was really hoping for more than this. I want the idea of Jolly Pumpkin to succeed. There are many more beers to come out. I will be waiting eagerly."
"I was at the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Festival and saw the listing for Jolly Pumpkin. I had visions of pumkin ales and other kitche brews. I passed it by... big mistake. The labeling and beer names may be jolly and jovial, but this is serious beer. Its been a long time since I've had a beer that blew me away. La Roja did. All Hail Jolly Pumpkin!"
"Astonishingly nuanced. But I don't think this is for everyone, and after thinking about the suggestion posed to me, I agree; this could use some more vigorous carbonation. Nonetheless, while the bourbon intensity isn't for me, this is an extraordinarily cool beer."
"On the finish volatile, sinus-clearing fumes of cracked anise, pepper, cumin and rye explode from the back to add an odd, tragicomic twist to this beer loaded with dualities."
