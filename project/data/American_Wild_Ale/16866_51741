3.93,-8.6,3.25,4,4,3.25,4.25,"On tap at The Bruery poured into taster. Appearance is cloudy golden-orange with a thin white head that leaves spots on the drink down. Aroma is sour grapes, white wine vinegar, cherries, funky, tart, oaky and spicy as well thanks to the barrels and rye. Lots going on. Taste delivers on the sourness from the nose, with a forceful blast of initial tartness - citrus, cherry, grape - followed by a mellow vanilla sweetness, rye spice on the swallow, and a touch of oak bitterness in the finish. Medium body, a little creamy, moderate carbonation, long puckering dry finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

4.5,4.7,,,,,,"Poured a gorgeous translucent reddish orange body with a finger and a half of foamy pinkish head. Very nice looking. Scents of sour cherry, wild, barnyard funk, stone fruit, and sweet, tart red berries along with slight oak. Overall impression is of a nice sour aroma that is fruity and nicely funky. Very nice. Flavor begins moderately sour with notes of sour cherry, Brett funk and a bit of spicy rye, along with hints of oak. This moves into a still sour middle, with further notes of cherry, and a bit of spicy rye, with oak still present. Finish is dry and moderately high in sourness with notes of sour cherry and berries and oak. Aftertaste is sour, with notes of sour cherry, berries, especially raspberries, a bit of oak and a hint of spicy rye and grainy malt. Overall impression is of a nicely sour, dry and fruity beer with a nice oak presence and funk. Very nice and quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation, and a drying, puckering feel. Quite nice and very drinkable. Overall this is a good sour ale. It has a wonderful aroma and flavor profile that is fruity, funky, oaky and slightly spicy with a nice mouthfeel that aids the drinkability. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Sep 13, 2014"

After the first sip I couldn't say anything for about a minute because of how much saliva the acidity drew out. The taste started with super high acidity but gradually gave way to nice integrated malt with an amazing long finish.","yesforbeer","May 27, 2014"

Then the taste, wow, excellent. Made me pucker which was awesome and enjoyable. One of the top Sours I have had and one I would love to have again.

Good long finish with just a touch of sweet citrus at the end. The most intriguing part of the beer, though, is the touch of spicy rye that intermingles with the sourness- it's definitely there as an undercurrent to the more pronounced sour flavors. The rye really adds something here and rounds the whole thing out. Very enjoyable beer from a great brewery.","Georgiabeer","May 05, 2014"

4.35,1.2,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Very frothy head, crests around one finger, almost entirely extra large bubbles so it’s gone like that, no meaningful lacing to speak of. Strong glow to the liquid, really captures light inside the glass, gauzy rust orange to yellow in color, filled with very fine, microscopic bubbles. The nose is laser like in its precision, tart lemon to orange citrus, moss, forest floor matter, white pepper, caraway seeds, mostly green apple and pear fruit, a little peach pit, needs to warm to get the most out of the rye but even then not getting much oak element, glimmer of caramel, its muscular nature keeps it loitering for some time. Medium-bodied, the sourness and overall bite activates the palate right off while here the oak brings some textural creaminess in addition to vanilla and butter notes. Even dill weed, as created by some American oak barrels. There is a certain volatility to it, like an anxious finger tapping. Again, loads of sour grapefruit, lemon, orange citrus. Rye bite, sourdough bread, dried yeast, nothing “doughy” or uncooked. Close to peaty at times, definitely earthy and evokes the “sous bois” character. Carbonation is delicate, does not distract from intentional sourness. Green apple, pear, cherry, apricot fruit, more snap and crackle than juiciness. Linear and angular finish, no soaking into the palate, zips across the tongue. Refreshingly easy to drink.","farrago","Apr 24, 2014"

Sour lacto dominates the nose with some apricot, peach, and a little white vinegar. Not the peach version but still has some of those notes. Really nice. Flavor is a nice crisp sour green apple, with plenty of lacto and big acidity. Some light fruits and a hint of spice in there dancing around, and a clean dry finish.

A touch of sweetness on the end with maybe some sour cherry. Mouthfeel is on the lighter sid of medium with lively carbonation that seems to increase the impact of the sourness.

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2013. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big sour cherry, green apple, pear, clove, pepper, oak, vinegar, hay, straw, funk, red wine, leather, bread, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of tart fruity/spicy/funky lacto with wine barrel notes; and great strength. Taste of big sour cherry, green apple, pear, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, vinegar, red wine, leather, bread, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, pear, clove, pepper, oak, vinegar, hay, straw, red wine, leather, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of sour fruity/funky lacto, wine barrel, and malt flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp, smooth, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane wild ale! All around fantastic complexity and balance of sour fruity/funky lacto with balanced malt and wine barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. An amazing offering.","superspak","Nov 01, 2013"

Medium bodied, not chewey but a little filling, the rye helps smooth out as well, this beer has a crisp feel and dry finish that perfectly complements and balance the sourness of the beer, and the spiciness and very mild sweetness of the beer helps round it out. A complex brew that I can't really get a handle on but know I like and a great beer for all to try.","clayrock81","Sep 12, 2013"

Once acclimated, a caveat hardly used this side of the pond, this is generally palatable, but methinks for the wrong reasons, at least a tad, I suppose.","biboergosum","Jul 04, 2013"

The beer’s body is clear and practically crystal clean with just a slight haze from the malt and yeast. The beer’s head leaves a lacing sticky dots and strings. On the nose the beer smells like a light gueuze, with beautiful funk and cherry leather notes and a faint tinge of spice. The smell is not as strong as a gueuze, but it is still beautiful and funky. Leather is definitely the dominant smell in the nose, but it is paired with a sweeter funk and some light spicy rye. On the tongue, the beer tastes funky sweet with a light underlying rye spice and some nice acidity. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, fruity funk that moves into distinguished leather notes that stick to the tongue and only give light hints of cherry. There is an underlying spice from the rye which is light and bready, but I honestly can’t say if I would have noticed it unless the beer specifically had “Rye” in the name. The funk does hit almost cloying notes as it builds, touching citric lemon and some slight pineapple notes in the start of the taste. The finish is sweet lemon citrus with a touch of leather and then a final burp of spicy rye with a faint touch of bread and chocolate. In the mouth, the beer is medium plus in body with a creamy carbonation and a great citric pucker at the end without the citric bite. This beer feels really nice in the mouth. Overall this beer is a terrific sour with a great mouthfeel that doesn’t bite the hell out of your mouth with acid. This is a very balanced and tasty sour. Try this beer, but share it. It is worth the money.","Maxwell","May 17, 2013"

The nose is complex and oaky with heavy tart fruit, notes of peach and cherries along with a touch of rye malt on the finish. The taste is super tart from start to finish with nice underlying fruit and oak character. The rye is subtle but adds a nice complexity to the sour profile. Mouthfeel is effervescent with medium body. This is a deliciously sour ale and definitely worth trying.","homebrew311","May 10, 2013"

The nose comprises soft cheese, tart berries, light wine grapes, and a bit of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a strong semi-lactic sourness pervading quite nicely. It's strong, but you get to keep some of your enamel if you do things right. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish.

There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, the brew smells like lemon, peaches, oak, some funk and an overall tart fruity aroma. The brew tastes like lemon, sour cherries, peaches, apricots, and some vinegar, vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has a good amount of carbonation. I don't pick up any rye in this beer, but maybe it's overpowered by the tart/sourness that's in it. I think it's a good sour brew, I'd like to try this again.

The rye lends a very subtle touch of spice and stays in the background, but is a welcome addition. Mouthfeel is a bit full for a sour but certainly doesn't detract. Carbonation is spot on. Overall, this is a home run for me. Very nicely done.","jbuddle","May 13, 2012"

The bone colored foam pillows up to three fingers in height, before displaying a surprising amount of head retention and lacing for a Wild Ale. The nose is reminiscent of a flanders red. There's plenty of cherry led dark fruits, oak, and acidic tartness. No real contribution from the rye here. The flavor profile does make room for some spicy earthy rye notes to emerge in the background, complementing the woodiness from the barrels. The sour aspect of the beer is a little more overpowering here, not leaving as much room for some of the fruit flavors to shine through. The body is a little creamier than normal for the style, while still being fairly dry. The carbonation is nice and bubbly, creating an interesting contrast with the body. While I wish the rye used for Sour in the Rye stood out some more at times, it still helps the Bruery make a very good wild ale with a bit of a unique twist.","axeman9182","Mar 11, 2012"

Scent is quite lovely...smells like some fresh rye bread with some sour yeastiness. Spiciness perfectly blended with sour, wild yeast notes and barnyard funk. Some nice hoppiness in the nose as well. Taste is just as good as it smells. I was kinda nervous going into this one, due to the mixed reviews, but damn this is good. Perfect mix of rye bread and lacto flavors. Some white vinegar with fresh baked bread and bitter hops. The rye makes this beer have some spiciness after you get the tartness up front, but then it finishes sour. Very complex. Mouthfeel is very well-carbonated and medium bodied. Puckering. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a fantastic sour that I wish I was allowed to purchase more of.

This beer would probably be terrible if it wasn't for the rye but it counters the funk and acetone with a nice sweet and spicy character. This is complimented by some dark fruit and sweet malt. Finishes dry and tart with a touch more acetone. Overall, well balanced and flavorful but the acetone turns a beer that could be amazing into slightly above average.","corby112","Jan 29, 2012"

I am definitely enjoying this beer, if for nothing else than its unique texture then so be it. There isn’t really a whole lot of complexity here; I would have expected that the rye would have added more wild graininess and spiciness to this brew and even the funkiness is focused on the lactic acidity rather than more wild notes from Brettanomyces or other wild-bugs that can produce a lot of “off” flavors. If there were a lot of sour, heavily laden rye beers out there this wouldn’t be much of a standout, but as it is there is not, so this is enjoyable for its relative uniqueness if nothing else; it is indeed an experience.","Gueuzedude","Aug 03, 2011"

3.97,-7.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A slow but easy drinker: maybe not an introductory sour, but certainly not advanced. Another reviewer compared it to an oud bruin, and I concur -- that's probably its proper category.","gory4d","Mar 07, 2011"
4.15,-3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,3.5,"This is pretty damn solid. Really nice flavor profiles, however can't tell there is rye at all. The tart vinegar is a little coy on the taste, other than that almost perfect.","jrallen34","Feb 14, 2011"
4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - OK. After these three beers (the other two being Chocolate Rain and BBA Two turtle Doves), I am officially a fan of The Bruery. I had been on the fence before, but no longer. Amazing stuff! This is such an awesome, tasty sour beer... definitely one of the best American sours I've had to date!","ffejherb","Feb 09, 2011"
4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability is good. This is a nice American Wild and a 750 goes down pretty easy with 1-2 other people. Finishing an entire bottle by yourself might be a bit rough though. This beer is already quite acidic, but I would be interested in seeing how it ages and if the brett comes out more. Definitely worth checking out if you can find a bottle. The rye spice / blue cheese combo is pretty cool.","sisuspeed","Feb 01, 2011"
4.17,-3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, a really nice sour. The rye adds an awesome layer to the sour. Pretty drinkable.","mothman","Jan 19, 2011"
3.9,-9.3,4,4,4,3,4,"Murky orange-amber, nearly opaque. The head fizzles away quickly. Interesting, complex nose. Rye is evident, lending a dry earthy note, but there's a more dominant fruity, vinous sourness that's both acetic and lactic. The palate shows a nice blend of cheesy lactic acidity, fruity acetic acid, earthy rye and oak. Balanced, but somewhat thin for nearly 9% ABV. Quite good overall, the rye contrasts nicely with the bugs and funk.","largadeer","Jan 10, 2011"
4.32,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a caramel in color with light brown highlights that had a thin bubbly head and left some lacing sticking to the glass. I did detect a little rye but was faint chillin in the background with citrusy vinegar notes vinous character and faint vanilla as well. The citrusy vinous and mild vinegar flavors dominate the palate with rye spice, oaky, and grape accents with a touch of acidic sour notes. The brew was medium in body with a pleasent amount of carbonation which had a mild acidic but vinous, rye spice, oaky,and citrusy sour finish. I got to try it about a year ago but was happy to have another stab at it since I thought it was tasty the first time around. It was pretty sour and drank really good.","Gobzilla","Jan 09, 2011"
4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Alcohol is very well hidden the juxtaposition between sour and sweet bourbon like flavors is amazing.","billshmeinke","Jan 09, 2011"
4.3,0,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drink-This is a great sour overall for me because its not too over the top.","FosterJM","Jan 09, 2011"
4.2,-2.3,4,4,4.5,5,3.5,"Unfortunately, the complex taste does wear a bit compared to other "sours". I did not come back for a second, but probably could have and not been disappointed. Again, some age would probably cut down on this a lot with a sacrifice to the intense mouthfeel which I love.","ebin6","Dec 18, 2010"
4.27,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Moderate body with a really nice amount of sourness. Overall, this drinks quite well and I was really thrilled to be able to try this. This trip was some of my first exposure to The Bruery's beers and I'm glad that they have nice experimental brews like this on.","Thorpe429","Oct 22, 2010"
3.53,-17.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - A little too tart for my taste.","srandycarter","Jan 23, 2010"
4.32,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Well this certainly brought the goods, with a hearty even mix of tart/sour/spice/bread notes and a well done barrel character that pulled it all together. Great stuff as usual from The Bruery.","Kegatron","Dec 08, 2009"
4.32,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The flavor opens up piquant with a distinct lemon rind and cherry tartness, as well as a clean lactic sourness and a touch of sweetness. Spicy rye is well integrated and I detect an earthy component. Acetic character is at a moderate level and I experience that same sharp Blue Cheese character I detected in the nose. The drying finish is lactic with a moderate acetic character accompanied by light wood and tannins. Another delicious and unique beer from The Bruery and I'm surprised it wasn't better received on the forums. Recommended.","HopHead84","Nov 12, 2009"
4.32,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I found this beer to be great. Drinkable is a term that you can use easily with this. I went back not only for seconds...but fourths. this should be bottled and distributed directly to my beer room. Whadda you think Patrick? no? ok I will just wait for it to be put on tap again.","Mauerhan","Nov 03, 2009"
4.35,1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - High for the style, benefiting from the sourness not being over-the-top. This is a great sour overall.","nickd717","Oct 12, 2009"
4.62,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Insanely drinkable, absolutely perfectly balanced. Nice well carbonated mouthfeel. They refused to give me a growler of it.","Overlord","Oct 09, 2009"
4.43,3,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"An example of why The Bruery has such a good reputation, there are probably less than half a dozen breweries in the country that can do sours this well. This is just good beer, which is underrated at the moment.","vacax","Sep 19, 2009"
3.65,-15.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Low to moderate carbonation, just a tad syrupy for my liking. Quite an interesting sour that's worth a try.","seaoflament","Sep 15, 2009"
4.13,-4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: This is a great sour beer, the 2nd time I've had this one, always enjoyable and an experience.","Halcyondays","Sep 05, 2009"
4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"An interesting sour. Its tartness/soruness would be in the middle ground for the style. Hints of grapes and pinneapple show up. Quite cheesy....like swiss cheese. Surprisngly full in the body, while not having the high acidic qualities of a sour. Cheesy aftertaste. Another worthy wild ale produced by The Bruery.","DoubleJ","Aug 15, 2009"
3.57,-17,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall: A try it beer. Cheers!","OlieIPA","Aug 09, 2009"
