Opens up with a wonderfully bright fresh raspberry aroma and flavor fading into a lemon juice and lemon peel overshadowed by both astringent oak tannins and alcohol that is a bit unpleasant. The raspberry is a bit sweet but is not immediately apparent given the acidity. This is one of the most acidic beers I have ever tasted. As a sour beer lover, even my system is shocked. The carbonation is active and prickly. The mouthfeel would be rated higher had the tannins and alcohol not been so harsh. Riserva has some marks of greatness but ultimately it is not very drinkable.","brianmandell","Jun 06, 2014"

Flavors were exactly as others described them: Upfront puckering, slightly sour, fruity, then the oak barrel flavors come in, then INTENSE SOURNESS, then it fades into a yogurt after-taste. Separately, I like everything about this beer, but I couldn't handle the oak and sour mixture. Didn't blend well at all for me. Worse still, the sourness was way beyond my threshold. It tasted like I was directly biting into a lemon during the peak. The flavors definitely improved and blended better upon warming, but not enough for me to enjoy it.","YeastEnthusiast","May 03, 2014"

Poured a light and cloudy red body (it's not pink but it's not basic red or purple, either) with one-finger offwhite head and left lace along the glass. Aroma is comprised of extremely tart, with a little sweetness, raspberries and there are touches of sour funkiness. Smooth, balanced, and that is key as this could have been a mess, the extremely tart and sour raspberries also have a touch of sweetness, especially in the finish, so you get the best of both worlds and not just a flat, sour mess..","clayrock81","Apr 30, 2014"

Initially the sweet ripe raspberries grace the tongue, followed by a tart zing, and then if held, the barnyard funk comes into play. The finish is raspberry for minutes. The ample carbonation helps carry the tart flavors over the tongue, but isn’t overdone as to cause excessive carbonation. A fantastic beer.","taylor714914","Oct 30, 2013"

Little get together with a certain san diego bottle share group. originally had this at a 4.25 but after contemplation and realizing it was 11.4% abv I had to chiggity check myself. The alcohol was hidden too well. I would have guessed 7.75 at the most, maybe 8 if we were getting crazy, but it was a monday night...I digress. It poured a pinkish red the 1st round but got murkier towards the end eventually down until the dregs, which were straight brown and opaque; reaching an extreme funk. The smell was lambic and footy (wild ale for those being PC). The taste matched the smell plus a viscous coating of raspberry puree.. Not super tart but not New Glarus either; A funky raspberry effervescent wild ale/sour This would be very nice as a vertical.","Piddmeista","Jul 01, 2013"

Wonderful sour raspberry flavor and a strong alcohol presence. Overall, a great wild ale, but that smell is something to reckon with.

A few stray bubbles formed on the pour, but there was no real head to speak of. Aroma loaded with raspberry and funky grass. Blast of raspberry up front in the taste, very sour, with a saliva-inducing acetic acid sensation, though lacking any pulverizing vinegar flavor, underlying berry and malt sweetness, oak and earth mid- to end-palate, with a slight, subtle grassiness in there that is mostly overwhelmed by the tartness of the raspberries. Kind of hard to believe that this had been mellowing out for two years, because it still packed a mean punch. Contrary to some other reviews of this, I can't really say anything bad about the beer...I thought it was great. Medium body, low carbonation, lacking a bit in crispness, but nonetheless, a great sour beer overall. I guess the ABV at 8-10%, and apparently I was wrong.","Rifugium","Dec 25, 2012"

The nice twist of raspberry puree and oak give it some complexity that is welcomed into the style with open arms. As the beer sits and the carbonation settles down a bit, the oak comes out more and helps smooth things over a little. So does the alcohol, though, but that is expected with the abv and general lack of body that comes with the style. Certainly recommended if you enjoy sours, especially with the price point (I got mine for $6.99, which is a steal for a sour of this quality)","BEERMILER12","May 03, 2012"

Not the prettiest beer, that's for sure. Scent is..Wow...strong raspberry puree/jam aroma. Lovely, tart berry aroma with some sweet cherry scents as well. Slightly medicinal. Taste is initially tart berries...raspberries and strawberries. Some definite alcohol presence. Some maltiness as well. Slight cherry cough-syrup flavor lingers on the back of the tongue. Not nearly as sour as I was expecting. Slightly warming alcohol burn in the throat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fizzy, and warming. Drinkability is fair. Overall, not the best wild ale...I would say this is more of a fruit beer with the lack of sourness and heavy fruit profile. By no means is this a bad beer, but it is very interesting. Would have loved to see more pucker to this and less booziness/medicinal flavors.","DovaliHops","Apr 11, 2012"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but the sour and earthy flavors are stronger than the sweet ones, not that I'm complaining.

Of course the taste is incredibly sour, but I bet this year of aging has made it much smoother than if I opened this at time of purchase. High acidity is evident. It has an alcoholic apple cider/wine like quality to the mouth feel. What's remarkable is that I was pondering what the ABV might be as its not revealed on the bottle.

2.63,-35.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,2,"This is a medium bodied brew that is lightly carbonated. It could use a bit more fizz but that isn't going to fix all the offputting character this brew has. It boasts some serious sourness and acidity in a heartburn inducing sort of way. The taste is off, quite clashing and at times not enjoyable. However, if you are looking to have your sense of taste wrecked and face puckered in acidity, than you might want to give this brew a try. Or rub your tongue all over some leaking batteries. I don't even know if it is worthwhile keeping one of these around to see how it ages but I'm a glutton for punishment and plan on giving it a try again sometime down the road. I honestly approached this beer on more than one occasion with different batches and an open mind and I have not enjoyed this offering despite really wanting to. While this brew might not be an enjoyable example of an American wild ale for everyone, it certainly will get you buzzed.

Color is decent once the sediment subsides, a reddish tan color with good clarity. Aromas are fun-ky. Sour cherries and sweetarts. Flavor is confusing. Initial impact of fruit is great but the onset of sour is intense. I'm not one to complain about a little sour, but the chalky aftertaste of dissolved sweetarts and acid with an earthy, underripe sour cherry bite is a bit much for me. This would probably benefit from about 20 years in the basement to mellow the f*ck out. I struggled through my half of the bottle. Whew.","Tripphop","Apr 18, 2011"

Was it west coast wild ale hubris? Was it not sour enough for the sour heads? Who knows. This one's sour enough for me, and - thought it doesn't ascend quite to the funky levels of those Russian River classics which I taste hints and flourishes of here (Consecration and Supplication being the closest, perhaps, more the latter than the former) - I'd put it right up there with Cuvee de Castleton in my book as the best non-Russian River U.S. wild ale I've had the opportunity to try (though I have a Rosso in my cellar at the moment I'm hoping - for my sake - will bust that standard). As it stands, I'm glad I picked this one up - the 11.4% is an afterthought, completely unnoticeable, and only faintly expressive in my mannerisms after nursing this for an evening watching the Golden Globes.

The nose was amazingly floral and berry'ish...strawberry, blackberry, cranberry, etc. The taste confirmed this; a nicely balanced sour berry nuance throughout, and finishing on a sour note.

Not necessarily so. I'll bump the mouthfeel for the fact that I somewhat enjoyed trying to choke this down before it melted my nearly-frozen insides on this frigid, frigid morning.

Nose is slightly medicinal, but that's kind of the nature of raspberry beers in my experience, but tart and acidic notes are definitely there too. Raspberries make a play. The first sip is just bracing. Very very very sour and tart, leans on the tart side of things, but acetic notes make a play too. Raspberries come through mid-palate, giving a bit of relief. Almost burns my lips. Reminds me of Rose de Gambrinus, but a little more robust and a little less elegant/refined. This is a hell of an experience.

A tad sweet, and I would love to see where this batch is going to go after a few years in the bottle. Taste is tart, oaky raspberry, with a hair of cider just like nose suggested, and in very appealing harmoÑy. If this batch is 11%, then it should get a 5.0 for drinkability because there is just a hint of heat wrapped up in it that elevates the other flavors amazingly well. Blown away by how good this year's batch is. Awesome.

The smell is what draws the curiosity as it exudes raspberry (as expected) and deep pungent vinegar tones (as described on the label of the bottle). The taste was the sell, very low carbonation and extreme sourness that is backed up brilliantly with natural sugars. This wild ale is outstanding and personally I do not prefer wild ales in general.

The Brett dominates with little oak character coming through. The taste is decent. It's equal parts raspberry, alcohol, and Brett flavors. It's tart with a good amount of sourness. The alcohol character is a little much. It takes away from what would probably be a really nice raspberry flavor. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation.

Taste was not as sour as I expected, actually tasted like Chloraseptic throat spray on the back end. This was really hard to finish even with sharing it with a friend.

It tasted like sour apple and cherry and grape and raspberry, with oak and some copper and a bit of bready yeast and alcohol. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a very tart lasting aftertaste. Overall this was a very complex and powerful beer with a great sour taste, like Consecration but more raspberry than cherry. However, I was surprised at the mix of sour flavors in this beer, rather than straight dominant raspberry. It had good body too, but the alcohol was pretty hot, so drinkability was a bit hindered. Not sure if that would improve with age, as the alcohol heat might fade, but the sourness might increase.

A steady stream of tiny bubbles from the carbonation slowly rises to the surface. Very strong, potent aroma, fairly complex. Most immediate aroma is the funky sourness and occasionally a fruity, tart raspberry aroma will linger. The aroma finishes sweeter than it starts, assuming its the oak and fruit. First taste is immediately sour and funky, much more pronounced than last year. Very nice balance of a strong tart raspberry presence, however not much fruit sweetness. Near the finish there is a slight sweetness from the oak and mild alcohol burn. Finish lingers forever with a dry, sour and tart flavor that is delicious to me. Very full, smooth body, with mild carbonation that nicely complements the sour and tart flavors. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable to me, I love this.

The finish is solventy and somewhat harsh, though the alcohol is masked slightly by the fruit. Oddly one-dimensional; this beer needed a lot more time in the barrel, I think, as it has very little yeast character and any perceptible tartness seems to come more from the fruit.

3.73,-8.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D: A very nice drinking raspberry style. Very smooth, clean, though felt limited complexity wise at times and not justified of the high price of admission. Good overall flavor though not worthy of its price tag.","beerthulhu","Oct 18, 2008"
3.74,-8.3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think this has really good potential and I think this is probably an excellent candidate for the cellar. It's rough around the edges and a bit harsh right now. I'm guessing some age would help this meld together better. Overall, I am impressed by the effort by Weyerbacher. Right now it's a good beer, but doesn't get very close to greatness. With some age, who knows?","number1bum","Sep 23, 2008"
3.37,-17.4,4.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"d: This is a tough one to summarize. I split this bottle with one other person and we both agreed that 6 oz would have been plenty. There is plenty to like about this, but ultimatley, it lacks complexity. The raspberries all but overwhelm everything else. I'm very glad to have tried this one.","DIM","Sep 21, 2008"
4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a light ruby with brown highlights. Not a whole lot of head at all on the pour, but very good amount of carbonation. Smell is dark fruits, mainly raspberry and some funk. Taste is more of the raspberry, but a good amount of brett and some tart funkyness. This was a bit of a shocker. I enjoyed this much more than I had aniticipated. Would like to get another bottle of this to try in the near future.","FtownThrowDown","Sep 19, 2008"
4.46,9.3,5,4,4.5,4,5,"D: No hint of the ABV at all. This beer was a monster. Super drinkable and a totally extreme beer. Glad to see weyerbacher making some wacky stuff. Definately worth trying.","aerozeppl","Sep 09, 2008"
4.17,2.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Speaking of special releases, why is it that Captain Lawrence and Weyerbacher can release quality rare beers for $13/750 ml bottle and we're paying in $30 for Isabelle or $15 for a 375 ml of Beatification out here in Ca? I think I'm getting my beers from the east coast from now on.","t0rin0","Sep 04, 2008"

4.42,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Body is medium, slick, creamy, and coating. A light airy mouthfeel glides the layers of flavor across your palate. Would be an excellent candidate for the cellar.","AlexJ","Aug 21, 2008"
3.97,-2.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes to the beer guy at Marty's in Newton for fishing this last bottle they had out of the basement for me. Poured in to a DFH snifter a murky strawberry color. This one looks more like one of my sister's cosmos than a beer. Almost the way a cocktail looks after some ice has melted in to it...very interesting. Nose is dominated by raspberries, but some musty cellar smells and green leaf also come through. Taste is also dominated by raspberry, bit of hard booze (reminiscent of Stoli Raspberry Vodka), earthy tones, great mix of sweet and sour. Mouthfeel is cool in that the carbonation adds a bit of burn to the boozy aspect of it. Still strikes me as being medium in body. A good sipper for sure, I would drink this with one or two friends. Boy, lately Weyerbacher have been batting a thousand with their beers. This one is another home run for me.","jamie2dope","Aug 20, 2008"
4.27,4.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Wow. How interesting. This is as much wine like as it is beer. So unusual and unique. It's definitely the next generation and I'm glad I have another bottle!","RblWthACoz","Aug 18, 2008"
4.92,20.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"This is an extremely drinkable beer, the high ABV is well concealed. Wish I had purchased more than two when I had the chance.","jkane101","Aug 15, 2008"
4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Deep strawberry hue with amber shadings, and very slight haze. Bubbly, almost soda-like head that reduces to a thin, creamy ring. Raspberry jam, preserved lemons, and oak in the nose. Bright acidity coming to a carbonic & lactic crescendo followed by short burst of fruit quickly giving way to a lingering, smooth, oaky finish. Raspberry underpinning all the way. Aftertaste is rich, almost like mascarpone. Carbonation is pretty low, and body is fairly hefty compared to expectations. Alcohol presence is minimal though I know there's a lot in there. Sticky lips after a few sips leads me to believe that the relatively high alcohol (according to the brewery, from an independent test) works with the acid to keep this slightly sweet beer from becoming too sweet. I early await this beer with some age on it. If the acidity wins then good things will come, though my gut says the ravages of oxidation will accentuate the wood. A year and a half in the bottle should be good enough to signal its future.","yen157","Aug 11, 2008"
3.9,-4.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a pinkish and cherry red with a small, bubbly, lingering head. Smell is immediately of sour cherries and sweet raspberries. A mild smell of vinegar, oak, and sherry transcends the fruit aroma. Initial flavor is of oxidized raspberries and a well hidden layer of alcohol. The beer is mildly spicy and tart, while a very small amount of brett character is present. There is no bitterness to this beer, only a slight sour character. The abv makes this a very strong wild ale, but the taste of alcohol is barely present. The beer is well carbonated. I just started this, but I think towards the end it will be a chore to drink.","HopHead84","Aug 08, 2008"
4.17,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a raspberry-like red with a decent off-white head. Little staying power. Smells of tart raspberries, barnyard, and oak. The brett is pretty sour in the nose and in the taste. Borderline puckering. Raspberries lend a sweet/tart body a much needed balance to the sour brett. The oak is subtle, adding a soft vanilla undertone. Mouthfeel is deep and complex, moderate carbonation. Alcohol is well-hidden and as long as you like a sour ale, this would should not disappoint.","ColForbinBC","Aug 08, 2008"
3.77,-7.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"easy to drink but 750 ml is a bit much at once. Share this one with a friend or two, will be much more enjoyable.","tayner","Aug 07, 2008"

4.29,5.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear blood red with a two finger light tan colored head that quickly disappears to a paper thin whispy layer of bubbles. Minimal lacing sticks to the side s of the glass. Smell begins pretty funky with tart red berries, some vinegar, and hard candy sugar. A touch of oak and honey linger in the nose as well. I have no idea where the 11.4% abv is in the scent, unreal. The flavor begins with a balanced blend of tart and sweet raspberries as well as some lingering warm booze and red wine. Honey, vanilla, and cane sugar emerge midway on the tongue with some sour notes. The aftertaste consists of pepper, raspberry syrup, and oak with more alcohol warming flavors. A lot going on with this beer in the taste department. Light to medium body with a prickly feel and a powerful carbonation, fits the style quite well. A sipper for sure, but there's nothing wrong with that. I had no problem taking my time with this bottle and enjoying everything it has to offer. Not exactly sure how many bottles are out there, but I'd love to get my hands on another one and see what some age does to this. Thanks again Josh.","BeerTruth","Aug 03, 2008"
4.74,16.2,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The alcohol is completely masked and the balance between the sweet and sour makes this one of most drinkable beers I have encounter. I wish I had more.","brantadid","Aug 02, 2008"
4.18,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a ruddy reddish orange with a short-lived pinkish head that leaves very little lacing on the way down. The smell is mostly raspberries, both sweet and sour, and a hint of funk lingering in the background. There is also a strong candied sugar aroma as well. The taste is much like the aroma but with two distinct stage. The first wave of flavor is sweetness, both raspberries and sugar. The second wave happens as the raspberry turns tart and the funk comes in subtly in the end but not overpoweringly so. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and I was surprised by the big alcohol content as it's not that noticeable. This is a very refreshing wild ale that is not overly sour and makes for a perfect summer brew.","gford217","Aug 02, 2008"

4.49,10,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"D: The 11.4% alcohol is well-hidden, buried beneath on of the most complex tastes that I've come across. This beer could age for a few years but it is pretty damn good right now.","akorsak","Jul 27, 2008"
3.26,-20.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Interestingly enough for a beer this strong, the raspberry character makes this quite a simplistic brew. Hints of a funky beer complexity lurk underneath the surface but don't quite make it out enough to make this really interesting much less balanced. Enjoyable if you like raspberries as the malt and most of the funky notes that I was hoping to find are just overwhelmed. Not bad tasting, just a bit of a let down.","Gueuzedude","Jul 22, 2008"

I am not a huge fan of the Red Flander style, but this beer was so incredible, so interesting and so much fun to drink, I could absolutely see ordering it again. Of course one would be all I could drink, and I'm guessing it would take me the better part of the day to finish it off. Just an exceptional beer...","John_M","Jun 20, 2008"
4.83,18.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This beer pours a beautiful mild reddish hue with a hearty head that leaves thick lace on the glass. The aroma is filled most by the raspberry fruit, with hints of malt and oak in the back. Upon first strike on the palate the fruit is immediately apparent, but settles out with a wonderful oak flavor coming to the front. Carbonation is heavy, and fits the style extremely well. Much love went into this beer, and it shows.","ekfinn","Jun 13, 2008"
