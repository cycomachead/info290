4.25,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Very sour upfront. Not just the initial shock, but a second tartness in the aftertaste that is very much apricots. Constantly reminded of lambic/gueuze, maybe being an older vintage attributed to this but I am loving it. As my glass warms and my mouth gets accustomed to the sourness, more oak and apricots show up along with a vinious flavor. Not overly dry and well carbonated, makes me thirsty for more without raking my tongue. I'd be interested to taste a fresher bottle but this 2011 is right up my alley - everything I want in a fruited sour is here. Fantastic beer and a wonderful introduction to Cascade.","supernatural_skeptic","Jul 20, 2014"

I was expecting a little bit more out of this one. Cascade Blueberry is one of my most favorite brews and I think I had such high expectations for Apricot that it almost isn't fair to review it on my first time having it. During the early parts of this review I was sort of bashing it a bit because it didn't live up to the expectations but now that I've been drinking through more of it it is really growing on me. I'd definitely drink it again and will probably buy another one to try to have it in a less biased situation but I wouldn't see myself shelling out $30/bottle for it on a regular basis. In the end it misses the sourness I was expecting while wowing me with lots of fruit that isn't too sweet or dry. Great balance. Great beer. Kudos.","ThreeLions","Jun 19, 2014"

There's something really appropriate about using apricots for sour beers - its naturally acidic, dry, and tart character melds so naturally at hand. I'm happy to have another bottle on hand that I've held onto since July. I should consider cracking it open soon before the highlighted fruit character fades away!","magictacosinus","Feb 09, 2014"

4.32,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2011 vintage. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of huge tart green apple, apricot, lemon, raspberry, white wine, oak, clove, white vinegar, leather, hay, straw, musty funk, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of tart fruitiness, oak, and funky/acidic yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart green apple, apricot, lemon, raspberry, white wine, white vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, pepper, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Big fruity acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour green apple, apricot, lemon, raspberry, white wine, white vinegar, oak, clove, musty funk, hay, straw, leather, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of tart/sour yeast ester, fruit, and oak barrel flavors; with a good fruit/sourness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very acidic, crisp, and fairly smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fruited sour ale! Amazing complexity and balance of apricot fruit with fruity/sour yeast ester and oak barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on even with the big acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

I would get to the bottom of the glass and still have some of that sticky bubbles at the bottom, each new pour brought more beer, and lots more bubbles. A great peachy-orangy-ambery-yellowy color that I found extremely inviting. Aroma was a bit lack-luster: citrusy acidic tartness with some faint apricot. Taste was a punch in the mouth sour. I found my mouth watering from the aftertaste. Really dry, super tart, and great balanced fruitiness (apricot/kumquat) with some mild woody-spiciness. This beer literally danced around my tongue and had a nice light body without being watery.","mverity","Dec 18, 2013"
4.57,5.1,4,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"an absolutely gorgeous beer, totally brings cascade into my most desired breweries list. thanks to my twin brother for making this happen somehow. understated pale yellow color to this, with an active rising white bubbly head, but its the nose that hooks me hard. it smells like fresh apricot, really and truly, the most authentic fruit nose ever, its perfect. i smell the little fuzzies, the juicy flesh, the pollen, the woody pit, all of it, its genius. it has got some lactic funk too and its dry and just making my mouth water like nothing else. superb smell, best i can recall. the flavor is a little less fluently apricot, still head and shoulders more genuine than any other apricot beer ive had, but its not quite as in my face as the aroma. tart as anything too from the yeast and bugs, its funky, summery, desserty. like smuckers apricot jam its got all that sugar, but doesnt really taste sweet, thats the brilliance of this brew. great carbonation and a really intense sour prickle, more than i can almost take. dries me right out too, i cant get enough. in a night packed with world class sours, this was perhaps my favorite. its authentic fruit and tart acidity make a great combination, i would love to drink this again. incredible beer.","StonedTrippin","Dec 17, 2013"

There's a hit of dryness on the finish that seems to suck the moisture right out of your mouth. Once the dryness fades, I get a lingering jammy apricot note with some underripe cherry and oak.

This obviously followed through into the taste, with the tart apricot pretty much dominating all, with a biscuity malt base detectable. Pretty sour, I must say. This followed an Upland Blackberry, and pretty much nuked my palate even after that one. A woody, barrel profile emerged later, getting more pronounced near the middle/end of the bottle. Medium body, spritzy carbonation. Quite good overall, but not something I'd drink regularly. I definitely needed an antacid after this and the Upland.","Rifugium","Mar 31, 2013"

Flavors of apricot, tangerine, and green apple with a big crabapple sour that sticks to the roof of your mouth. Aged hops. Dry oaky, vinegar-sour finish.

Smell is sour vinegar with a hint of citrus and apricot (as expected). Major sour flavor from beginning to end. Very slight fruit flavor that seems mostly overpowered by the sour vinegar. Perhaps this mellows and highlights the fruit as it ages? Light bodied with high effervescent carbonation. Just was hoping for more fruit. Way overpriced at $20 a bottle for what it is, but a solid beer overall. I think I just wanted more apricot, because the dry sourness is pretty awesome. Good beer.","BMMillsy","Jan 19, 2013"

4.17,-4.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Cascade Apricot is a nice orange hued beer with some spots of faded gold within the liquid. The cap was about an inch in height and off white in height. It dwindles eventually into nothing, leaving no stick on the glass. After a while the liquid looks kind of dead. Smell is of fresh apricot pith, this is an extremely fresh bottle that just touched down in Philly, not sure how long it was in the bottle before I opened it immediately. Warmed up, apricot, pale malt, some lactic quailty and no alcohol. It's a pleasant smell, just not all together bold. Taste is pretty balanced, expecting a sour bomb I am greeted by fresh apricot, orange, pale malt, french oak and some lactic funk. The wood shows up more towards warming with orange popping out as well melding in with the apricot. Feel is a step below medium, the funk and apricot hit the tounge and leave off with light malt and lactic twinges. Carb is surprisingly low, but I guess that works with the acidic nature of cascade, which is heavy on the lacto/acidic nature of their sours. While not all that extremely sour, this is a pleasant beer that I think others could open up to, especially girls.","BARFLYB","Dec 30, 2012"

The nose comprises apricot jam, tangerine zest, mandarin orange, lemon zest, and a vague sense of sweetening spices way in the background. The taste holds notes of lactic peach, funky wheat, and lemon flesh. It's a bit simpler than the nose, but tasty and effective nonetheless. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a highly enjoyable fruity sour, one I really wish I could try over and over again.

Sweet/sour finish, medium carbonation and acetic pucker, which gives impression of a carbonation that's higher than it is.

There is a residual acetic dryness, but it doesn't feel as if microbial cultures are growing on my palate. The beer tastes/feels a tad watered down. It's refreshingly fruity, drinkable, and sour as expected without any noticeable alcohol (considering this beer's abv is nearly 2x a fou'foune).

It kind of smells like those candy Peach rings. It is very fruity and somewhat sweet. For the style it isn't on par but otherwise it does smell appealing. It tastes of tart dried apricots and peaches, almost like a poor man's geueze. There is a slight dryness but you do get a good amount of sweet and candied fruit. It drinks semi dry and light to medium in body. Overall this beer is just ok in my opinion. I appreciate that they made a beer with this fruit but it is just so fresh and fruity, even being the 2009 vintage. I would like a more tartness or a legitimate sourness and not so much gummy candies. If this beer was drier, and had some funk, it could be spectacular.

It is full of bold flavors, as suggested by its 9% abv, though pure alcohol qualities are minimized. Look for the apricot qualities to emerge as it warms, but classic aspects of the tripel style are never fully realized. The bottled beers of Cascade are always a tough buy, due to their high price tag, but time spent in the barrel is worth the extra cost due to the powerful and appealing oak qualities that are derived from it.","beagle75","Oct 23, 2011"

Apricots all around, but it's not over the top, sour all around, but not over the top, acidic but not over the top, and even some complimentary lemon flavor. And then I learned it was 8.5% ABV, which is amazing considering that there is no harshness to be found.

I really didn't pick up much of a sour component in the aroma profile, which made my first taste all that much more of a surprise. While not over the top, the sour aspect of this beer really dominates the flavor profile, though I pick up considerable apricot as well. There is also some light vanilla and lemom/lime as well that is intriguing and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, sour apricot finish. The sour component really seems to counter and lighten the alcohol impact on the finish, and once again I was surprised to learn that the abv. was 8.5%.

I expected this to have a more fruit forward aroma vs. the florals. Light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. The flavor is brett-like floral with touches of sweetness.

3.26,-25.1,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a nice amber color, surprisingly clear, with a huge sticky head. The bubbles are massive and loose and leave cobwebbed lacing a the start, then the head fades just a bit to a ring, and leaves tighter clumps of bubbles. Looks good, darker than I expected, I guess. The smell is slightly tart, pretty fruity, like peaches and some tart berries. It smells pretty sweet. Also, you can sense the funkiness of this one there too. I'd say it's not the best smelling lambic, but all of the elements are there. The flavor comes out with fruit, like fleshy, soft, juicy fruit. The beer is fairly sweetn, not too tart at all, and the apricots kind of win in the fruitiness, but I can also detect berries. I can kind of taste the malt, but mixed with the yeast character, it just comes across as straw and grass. I also get a little peach alcohol taste. After the fruit, and as it warms, you start to get the wildness of this one, and I don't think it is the most successfully developed wild ale. There's just this B.O. and foot funkiness, that didn't seem to get to the point of the acidic bacteria coming in, so there's very little acid or dryness to balance out this thick sweetness in this one. These are definitely characteristics of wild ales, kind of normal ones, but it's too one dimensional, and a little like fruity sweat, if that at all makes sense. The body is nice and full, with a moderate carbonation, but it's not as dry, and maybe a little too full for a good lambic. And I got a little bored of it while I was drinking. I think it could use a little more tartness and acidity, maybe a little longer conditioning to really let those flavors develop more (or maybe it went too long and the bacteria started eating the wrong stuff, sometimes I can't tell the difference - or maybe I don't know it well enough). The fruit would be nice in a more "sour" tasting beer, it has a very nice effect.","taylorhamrick","Jun 04, 2010"

I'd be interested to try their other bers but at $22 this would never get a repeat purchase from me. At $15 I could see myself buying this with some regularity.

4.12,-5.3,4.5,5,3.5,4.5,4,"D- A bit of a sipper, considering how sour it is, but overall very good. I think it may have been "sour for the sake of being sour", but I still really enjoyed it.","JoeMayo","May 30, 2009"
4.4,1.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Wowza, this ones tasting super fresh and very tart. Incredibly quenching and sharp with loads of apricot. Maybe a bit more funk and sourness would be nice but a great beer nonetheless.","brewandbbq","May 28, 2009"
4,-8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a clear honey colored with a one finger off-white head. Nice head retention - certainly more than I had anticipated in a lambic. Nose is drenched in apricot with a bit of a boozy smell, and the sourness definitely comes through. Taste is apricot mixed with a sourness that balances well. Nose would lead you to believe that the taste would be much more sweet. There is a pretty sweet finish to this, but doesn't leve much of an aftertaste. Mouthfeel is reminiscent of wine, but the carbonation in here definitely gives you the beer feel. VERY dry finish, and I liked it for this beer. This is an outstanding fruit beer. Not my style to sit with for an evening - but definitely one that could be enjoyed with friends.","Jayli","May 02, 2009"
4.27,-1.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Thanks for sharing this one, Arne. 750ml bottle into a couple of pint glasses. Straw-colored with good clarity, for the first pour at least, with a small 1 finger head that dissipated pretty quickly. Big fruity aroma with a touch of musty barrel beneath. There isn't much tripel character left in the aroma beyond the faintest hint of pale malt. Nicely balanced on the palate; not bracingly sour by any means. Light lemony tartness, just a hint of funk. Dry and grainy, big apricot flavor minus the sweetness. Little bit of cardboard-like oxidation in the finish. Great stuff; it lands somewhere between a standard fruit beer and a wild ale.","largadeer","Mar 30, 2009"
4.19,-3.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Hugely interesting.. and the backbone beer actually shows through with the triple maltiness.. and helps everything tie together quite well.","JohnGalt1","Feb 14, 2009"
3.83,-12,4.5,4,4,4,3,"soured belgian tripel aged with fresh apricots. golden, crystalline, a joy to the eye. the nose on this beer is pure fruit.. and the way the wild yeast grips the flavors of the tripel.. this is really puckering. less lactic, more fou-foune-y. the beer was rather high gravity to start, and that adds a real pleasant sipping aspect to the experience. most big sours ive had carry some excess sweetness, not this one. balanced for a fruit beer, consumer must love apricots.","goodbyeohio","Feb 10, 2009"
4.67,7.4,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"D- Rivals and dominates any fruit beer I have ever enjoyed. This beer demands respect and it is well deserved. Opening a bottle of this on a summers evening is nirvana.","skourtis","Feb 08, 2009"
4.42,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: The flavor profile is compelling; with bit more carbonation, this would be extraordinary","brentk56","Aug 07, 2008"
3.35,-23,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cascade Apricot is a simple and momentarily elegant ale though it is somehow incomplete without a more fully expressed measure of fruit flavor. Give it some warming and a wishful hint of apricot does emerge.","RedDiamond","Jul 08, 2008"
4.54,4.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"A highly drinkable beer, bought a bottle after drinking this at the lodge and I am looking very forward to drinking this later (hopefully it will last a while in the 'cellar'<-fridge)!!","beermebeerman","May 23, 2008"
4.22,-3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability is pretty high for me, this is a suitable champange substitute that even my non-beer drinking wife has indulged me with a glass or two. The booze is a bit heavy in the belly though, with a bit of a solevent feel cutting through the sourness, which, coupled with the high price, limits me to one bottle at a time. Still, as they suggest on the bottle, I've had a lot of trouble holding onto these to age. I think this is probably my fourth bottle, great to share with my wino friends to show them how diverse the beer world can be! I thought this was my favorite of the 3 they've recently released, although the Kriek I had yesterday slightly edged it out score wise, mainly due to the lower ABV/sugar/body. I still really love this one!","ccrida","Apr 17, 2008"
