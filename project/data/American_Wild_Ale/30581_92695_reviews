"Overall: Pretty well done and probably my second favorite of the WW offerings thus far. Says a lot coming from someone who is not necessarily a cherry fan."

"Dark brown body with a thin beige cap. Aromas of dark fruit, lactic funk, cherries, oak, plums, leather. Currants and raisins with brettanomyces and lacto. Tart, fruity finish. Dried fruit leather with cherry notes. Mild sweetness. Complex and tasty."
""
"Of the five Wicked Weed ""sours"" I've encountered, this is the standout. A deft balance of barrel and bug/yeast. Tart and sweet and warms like a champ. If you're going to make the jump to Wicked Weed, this is the beer to do it."

"O - Really the fruit/tart of the beer dominate with the bourbon barrels being secondary. But, that's a great change of pace from so many beers that tend to be dominated by bourbon characteristics."
"Bourbon barrel aroma, but American wild taste. Black and cloudy with a short lived head. Aroma is big on oak and vanilla, but the taste says otherwise. A oak up front, but there is plenty of sour fruit middle to finish. Light body and medium high carbonation. Tart with a nice bitter finish."
"Very good, but I wish the bourbon came through at all. The cherries and roast play well."

"Quickly. Smell has a deep acidic sour aroma and a large oak wood presence right up front. Some light sour dark cherry aroma follows with some hints of vanilla tannin and a slight toffee malt that is somewhat hard to detect through all the acidity. Taste follows nose with a nice acidic sour flavor forward followed by notes of tart dark cherries, oak, vanilla, vanilla toffee caramel and a slight bourbon presence in the finish. Lift crisp refreshing, medium to high carbonation."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, by no means a perfect beer, but certainly a very enjoyable wild ale.  Lots of little nuances which makes the drinking experience fun as you search for flavors and the proper description of them.  Haven't had much of Wicked Weed yet, but have really liked the initial offerings - glad I have several other examples waiting to be tasted."

"Pour is virtually black with a fizzy tan head that dissipates immediately.  Strong porter nose, chocolate, vanilla, roasted, almost burnt malt, and very light cherry notes.  Flavor is similar, gets fairly sweet, malts are rich and lightly roasted, cherry flavors come in and lots of sugar sweetness.  Fuller body, very creamy but a bit slick, high carb."
""
"Overall I liked this...it reminded me of like a alcoholic black cherry cola. Vinegary and tart cherries in the taste, good and worth checking out for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slight traces of vinegar on the nose and tongue aside, this beer has a lot going for it. Excellent blend of a wild ale and a stout. I'd drink it plenty of times again."

"This beer is sour enough for the cherries to come through. Not quite Tart of Darkness sour, but makes for an enjoyable unique beer."

"Pours a dark red/blackish color that looks like Shiraz wine in my snifter glass. Smell/taste is tart fruits and the Kentucky Four Roses barrel adds a little oak flavor, but no bourbon."

"O - Pretty spectacular.  Right up there with Russian River sours.  Impressive."

"Overall, this is an interesting beer, but the body just isn't quite there and it kind of hurts this one. As is, the taste comes off a touch watery and the bourbon barrel does nothing but kind of muddle things up in the middle. It's a pretty solid sour stout, but I've heard this compared to Tart of Darkness and it's just not quite at that level right now."
""

"Bottle poured into a snifter. Its dark brown to black in color with a mocha head that holds well. The aroma has hints of chocolate before giving in to a fruity essence of cherry and bacterial funk. Some mineral character is present in the flavor along with tart cherries and a backing of the previously mentioned chocolate malt. Its medium bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall it was decent with a fair balance of malt verse tartness. However, it was not as glorious as some have made this out to be. Despite the description sounding wonderful, I really dont think its worth the price."
""
""
"Pretty much jet black. Some brown showing through on the outer edges. Very small head from the pour, diminishing quickly into what looks like a cup of black coffee. No head at all after three minutes in the snifter. Small carb bubbles still rising to the top. More bourbon than tart on the nose. No chocolate or coffee in this style so the bourbon has a little more room to stand out. Bourbon to start with a faint boozienss. A very crisp tart finish. Not completely sour, just some cherry tart. Really nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is pretty standard for a sour. Thin an heavily carbonated. For me, this doesn't do well with the bourbon. Missing some of that savory bourbon velvet that I have come to enjoy in  many BBL beers. Overall, this is very good but I'm partial to the bourbon influence in many beers. I'm glad I got to have it but it's not something I would go out of my way to get again. Just nothing really awesome about it."

"Black Angel is loaded with tart cherries, dark fruit, sweet cherries and an easily approachable wild sourness. I've had other brews from Wicked Weed that I prefer but this is quite enjoyable in it's own way."

"""Cherry sour"" is such a base term, this beer is far more than that, it's well blended and has complexity and nuance in spades. Overall, high marks for this one. 4.5"

"Overall: a good tasting moderately sour beer. I think the bourbon takes away from the rest of the character and a strengthening of other characters and a straight oak barrel would have improved it just a bit."

"This was a huge surprise for me. Folks were traveling through Asheville (asked for requests), and I mentioned WW. Jackpot. I am just starting to venture into the Belgians/sours/etc so this looked a little intimidating when it arrived. I am NOT a fan of red wine. Anyways, poured from 500ml bottle into my snifter. 1/4 finger of off white head over a dark (nearly black) body with a slight reddish hue. Not huge on the nose (though more came out as warmed to room temp.) mainly a slight sour note, cherry, and a bit of oak. The taste was excellent... a hint of cheery up front, followed by a stronger cherry and oak hit, wrapped up in a slight red wine haze. Just a bit, just enough red wine flavor. The mouthfeel was a bit of beer, and a bit of wine... a little on the drier side. Overall this was a winner. Wicked Weed rocks. Don't let your fear of sours or red wine keep you away from this gem. As it warmed up, that cherry and barrel flavor exploded. If presented with another WW opportunity, I would likely try another variety... but if I saw this in local distro I have to say that I would go for it."
""
"Poured into a teku, dark reddish brown, no light can get through with a wispy off white head. Smells like a sour, that phenolic alcohol smell underlined with cherries and plum. Huge pop of taste up front, sour cherries and then it just fades away. Don't get much or any of the bourbon flavor. Maybe it did it's work to mellow out the flavors. Doesn't linger at all. Maybe a bit of oak that dries out your mouth. This really wants you to keep drinking it."

"I've had two of the barrel project beers from Wicked Weed and while both styles have been done numerous times in the past by numerous brewers, Wicked Weeds versions were both very unique and very delicious. Black Angel is spritzy, tart, complex, and flat out good! Thanks again Wil! Good shit, mang!"
""
""
"Lightly of peppercorn, the sour ale nose dives into a dry, cider, vinous and tannin-rich taste and texture that's obviously sucking the wood spice, vanillin and toffee-like caramel impressions from those oaken soaked bourbon barrels. Boozy with that Kentucky elixir, the beer leaves final impressions of bourbon-dipped cherry covered chocolates, but replacing that sticky sweetess with vinous sourness."
""

""

"O: The most different beer I've had in a long time. I really like it and want to try it again. Drank in the tasting room of Wicked Weed, downstairs from the main lounge."

"O - Another stop on the sour exploration. Gave a local a shot. Pricey for 500 ml, but interesting. Give it some time to warm and open up. Probably something that is better paired with food for full effect."
"I find myself lucky to have a steady, consistent supply of this beer."

"Served from bottle in to a Dogfish Head stemmed snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cherry, wood, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, sour, tart, cherries, wood, caramel, bread, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. All of the aspects one would expect from a sour stout make their way through in both the nose and the flavor. As I've said, I'm not a huge fan of the soured stout movement, but this one manages to throw a nice cherry aspect to soften the blow for. Fairly easy to drink and rather enjoyable overall."

"Overall had higher hopes for this one as some of their other sours on wood have been excellent, this one just a little too one sided to be great. Would of been much better if the taste was as balanced as the nose."

"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with dark roasted malt, cocoa, cherry, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour cocoa, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting combination of cocoa and fruit all around."
""

"Dark brown pour with some maroon around the edges, like a cherry cola. Topped off with a small, off-white, fizzy head that held at a thin ringlet, leaving a few dots of lacing on the glass. In the nose, dark chocolate malts, red wine and cherries, prunes, some oaky hints in there. In the taste, dark chocolate, dark fruit with a slight acetic tartness, more like you'd get from a Flemish red than anything else, I thought, sort of a blend of cherries and prunes and/or figs, with a little pulpy sweetness in there as well. Some oak from the barrel came out, but I didn't really pick up on any bourbon/vanilla notes. This seemed like a good idea that just could have been executed better. But that said, this was still a good brew. Medium body, good drinkability. I'd like to try this again and see if it improves, assuming they're going to keep brewing it."
"O - A great beer that holds its own with the likes of Bruery and Jester King, the roast over powered any ""cherry pie"" notes for me though."

"Bottle share at Proof. Very very deep brown with light chocolate colored head. Thick collar, some legs, fair lacing. Taste and aroma are of tart cherry, dark roasted malt, and some tart dry yeasty funk. High carbonation and medium body. This reminded me of Tart of Darkness from The Bruery. Very good beer overall."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, opaque, brown coloring with a thin halo of white head. Aromas of spicy and charred wood, tart cherries, earthy notes, and a candy sweetness. Flavors are tart and crisp forward, with a solid grape and cherry blend of fruit sweetness, and a charred and slightly bitter backbone. Earthy and woody notes help round out the palate nicely. Smooth, light bodied, with a crispness throughout. Fruity notes linger, with a sharp spice and bitterness in the aftertaste. Crisp, tart, slightly puckering finish. Good beer!"
"Slightly purple colored but mostly just blackish brown, and very dark. Head is nice and fluffy before it fades to a simple ring. Aroma is sweet, juicy, robust, woody, light vanilla, raspberry, cherry, plum, graham cracker pie crust right on as described, and bright mouthwatering tartness. Taste is brighter and more tart. Very clean.... Not overwhelmingly pie-like by any means but certainly very cherry. Alike to biting into fresh cherries, with purple grape skins, wine, oak, and maybe funky brett. Very nice. Texture is smooth, juicy, and dry. A bit of finely gritty dryness through the sour finish. Great beer!"
""
"I don't really think this beer is as sour as some people are stating. Its nice and tart but not too bad at all. Very drinkable imho. I had it from the bottle paired with seared tuna and lobster tail. This is a great beer with the cherries up front, a little vanilla, slight wood. All around a very well done drinkable dark cherry sour. Not much bourbon though. All around a really good beer that I'd like to drink regularly"

"O: If you enjoy cherries and tart/sour beers, then you should definitely grab this one when you go to Wicked Weed. I really enjoyed the strong tartness and puckering mouthfeel. Yum."

"O- the oaky barrel flavor play well on the tart cherry flavors, this one will have you puckering"

"Dark, pretty much black in the dim lighting, just a small ring of a head around the edge. The nose is sour cherry with dark roast grain and a creamy element. Cherry sourness and wood balanced beautifully with some mellow chocolate and dark malts. Not especially funky or sweet, but bone dry and smooth making for a very drinkable treat. Nice!"
