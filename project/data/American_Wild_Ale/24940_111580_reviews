"Really good sour. Nice and tart, but not a lot of apricot."
"Overall a very good beer, super sour, especially in the taste. Lots of fruit and vinegar; kind of reminded me of some Bruery sours. A 4 oz. pour was perfect for me."

"EBF sample. Pours a hazy yellow/orange color. Smell is a pretty intense sourness. This beer is brewed with apricots and after finding this out, I can totally get it. Flavor is very bright and tart. A mixture of various unripe fruits. White wine, lemons, acidity, apricots. Finishes with some oak. The flavor lingers and lingers, leaving tart, bright fruits. A nicely concocted sour brew with a fresh, pale fruity flavor. Memorable."

"Pours a very opaque golden yellow with a finger to finger and a half of nice, white head. Smells like lemon, I had a real hard time picking up the apricot. Taste followed and agreed with my nose, this one is at my upper limits of sourness.....which is a good thing. Will definitely seek out and drink again, and again, and again."

"Nice apricot presence, and sour base does not overwhelm. Very good, but not worth the $/oz."

"O-This may be my favorite Almanac beer. It is easily one of the best sour beers I have had in a while. It doesn't have the complexity of other sours and that may be OK because the fruit flavor here is very clean and pure. No bourbon or tequila or whatever barrel intrudes. It is just fruit and it is delicious."
""
"Very sour, good fruit flavor. Its a very nice sour beer, however aurelian lure is my favorite beer, and this is MUCH less balanced that AL. The sour overwhelms the pallet leaving the apricots in its wake. Smell is good"
""
""
""
"Surprisingly underwhelming, lacking in depth, fruit character, and far too light bodied for barrel aging.  A decent wild brew, sure but doesn't come off as anything special let alone memorable."
"Good not great compared to others in series.  Apricot flavor is pretty overshadowed by sour ale base, it'd be hard to guess that its apricot if I didn't know beforehand."

"This is one of if not my favorite sour, and in my opinion far better than any almanac beer. The body has some very enjoyable floral notes with a lot of apricots and cherries. There is quite a bit of carbonation and acidity, but it is not overbearing. What I enjoy most about this beer is its earthiness and the fact that everything tastes so fresh particularly the apricots and cherries. I would say that the bottle version can be hazier than on tap and although it probably looks better on tap, it ages very well with more noticeable barrel qualities over time."
""
""
"Aged bottle (Feb. 2013).. Oh so good. This one had Apricots, Loquats, and Cherries. The new batch (2015) has solely Apricots. Can't wait to taste the new batch after cellaring a year or two."
""
""
"Overall - I think I've decided that stonefruit are my favorite fruits to be added to sour beers, and I had high expectations for this one.  Those expectations feel just a bit short because the extreme tartness drowned out a lot of the apricot flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great beer, but is similar to most Almanac sours I've had in that it is very good, but not remarkable.  4 paws."
""
"Hazy burnt amber color. Mildly fruity nose. Smells of pears and apricots. Tastes like a good sour ale should. Light bodied tartness like dried fruit from a bulk bin."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful semi-opaque golden yellow. Smells fruity (peachy?), but not tart. But it tastes VERY tart. Delicious. Puckery. Very much to my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Either we got a pretty bad bottle or I really don’t get why this isso highly rated. Completely one-dimensional so not really complex and not easily drinkable either."
""
""
"Woooo. Super up front sourness. Almost like sucking on a lemon. Faint hints of the apricot and whatever the hell a loquat is. Not getting much in the way of wine barrel. It's delicious."
""
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. One of the best American Wild Ales I've tried. I would highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very nice AWA, I certainly liked this one even at its high price point at $17 for a 375ml. It lacks any kind of funk, but the acidity and fruit flavours is up to par with some of the other highly-regarded American Wild Ales out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Apricot and loquat all the way. A unique and delicious flavor profile with a solid tartness. There’s no avoiding the chunks with this one though."

"Overall: I was really hoping this one would be more sour and fruity. the fruit is very subtle. the wine smells and flavors are a bit more than I look for in this type of beer. too strong on the vinegar, but that may not have been the case fresh. but overall a decent drinking beer."
""
""

"Not bad at all here, tastes great, but could be a little more, I think."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a mouth puckering ale that focus more on pure fruity sour notes, with not a lot of funk.  The notes from the wine barrels are subtle, but compliment it nicely"

"Overall, a very solid beer. I would have rated this a 4+, but the particles really become a problem towards the end of the beer, and the small, occasional hints of plastic were off-putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This is a pretty good AWA. The amount of sediment is a bit of a turn off as probably 1/3rd of the bottle is like drinking high pulp orange juice. Another solid offering from almanac"

"The palate opens sharply sour with a blend of lactic acid, raw apricot, peach skins and cherry sourness. This is followed by a lemony mid palate that enhances the acidity. Drying and sour on the finish with fleshy fruit and a sourness not unlike aged foufoune( read: heading in an unpleasant direction ). Minimal wine barrel character here, although a moderate grape character is present. Light in body and moderately carbonated, this is solid stuff."
"O: Not as aggressively sour as most AWAs in this class, but a great exercise in balance between acidity and fruit character. Love it and wish I had another bottle!"
""
""
"O- The full dept of tartness blends with some more acidic fruit character that is bright and is nicely melded together. Very tasty."
""
"Overall: Another great Almanac sour. They really know how to make great sour beers consistently! This is at the top tier of the Almanac sours that I have tried so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is probably my favorite of the Almanac sours I have been able to try. It is fruity and tart, yet not so tart as to make you pucker. Just a very good beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a hazy light golden yellow with noticeable carbonation, but minimal head retention. There are flocks of settling yeast and strands of pulp visible as well. The nose is tart and fruity with notes of dog's breath, honey, apricot pit, and hinting cherries and acetone. The taste is fruity and funky with lemony acidity, a grainy backbone, and lingering apricots in the finish. It's light bodied with approachable sourness, a recognizable fruit presence, ample carbonation, and a dry fruity finish. This beer, although pricey, is incredibly well-honed and drinks with minimal complaints - perfect for summer."

""

"Overall a really nice, clean, refreshing sour. A step below some of the best gueuzes I've tried, but still enjoyable."
"Glorious apricots that must have been picked by Aphrodite because Raul just cannot, he cannot..."

"O - If you prefer sourness over fruit presence, you'll love this. Not my thing, although I can appreciate its qualities."
""
""
""
"Pours hazy copper with a quickly dissipating, white head. Aroma of sour and tart notes, some apricots and cherry notes, pale malts, light wine notes and oak notes, and hints of spices. Flavor the same with a great blend. Average texture. A really cool beer."
"This is a light bodied brew with modest carbonation. Plenty of tartness that gets minorly acidic when it warms up with a bounty of fruit and barrel character to balance it all out. I like this beer quite a lot, thanks again Anotherjoe!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Overly sour for me. Detracts from the fruit flavor, but amplifies the grain."

"O: A really nice, well-done sour. Quite light, enjoyable and drinkable. This is one of my favorites of Almanac's small-bottle sour series. Excellent beer."

"Pours an orangey yellow color. It's quite cloudy. Some sediment chunks floating around. The head is white with fine bubbles. Lots of lacing, residue left behind on the sides of the glass. Very good retention, kinda odd for a sour. Lots of fruit in the aroma. Particularly big on apricot. From what I remember from trying loquats, that's also fairly strong. Cherries are a bit in the background, though definitely noticeable. Mild wine. Some oak. A bit of cheesiness. Could use some cleaning up but it's a step in the right direction for Almanac. Mild lactic note. Taste is medium sour. Lots of underripe apricot. Some oak dryness. Still fairly messy with a moderate amount of bile flavor - I really don't know exactly what the flavor is, but it bothers me in a number of American sours. Some pale malt character lingers in the background. Medium-light feel. Somewhat effervescent. Good sour. Near the top of Almanac's releases for me. If they could just clean up whatever causes that bile-ish taste, I'd be a much bigger fan."

"a really awesome fruit beer here, not totally sure what a loquat is, maybe another asian citrus type? hard to pick it out, not knowing what it is. the beer is hazy pale orange colored without much head or visible carbonation, but its far from flat in the feel, just looks it. the nose is apricot heavy, thats the only fruit i really smell, maybe a little lemon, and also some hectic sourness, more than brett this is lacto heavy, clean though, and mouth watering. the flavor starts wight he fuzzy and ripe apricots, and then the sourness that starts with a lemony tartness and progresses to full blow caustic acidity. the finish finally shows the cherries in this, tart and red and juicy, which is an unexpected flavor for the color, and an even more interesting twist for the sourness to cling on to. a crockery malt base is basically irrelevant here, as the fruit and bacteria do all of the flavoring. this series of little bottle special farm stuff from almanac has been a pleasure to drink through so far, they seem to have a real grasp for getting authentic fruit flavors is dry sour beer, its real tasty, and aside from the sourdough, this may be my personal favorite. big thanks as always to drlovemd87 for sharing."

"hazy orangeish yellow color with a slight head. smell has a lot going on and i get a good amount of peaches. you can tell this one is going to be sour. taste is massively lip puckering and by far their sourest beer to date. great fruit notes throughout and the finish is on point with a lasting fruit flavor. love this stuff. lip puckering sourness thoroughout.. great job"

"Valley of the Heart's delight is one of the better, more complex American wilds I've had in recent memory. It's brightly acidic, fruity, lactic, and has that great sweet and sour give and take going. A really great beer I highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. An excellent wild ale and another awesome entry into Almanac's Farm to Barrel series. The complexity of flavors on display is quite impressive...absolutely loving the apricots in this. Not as sour as some, but presents a depth and well-roundedness that should be applauded. I really dig this beer and am glad to have tried it."

" Hmmm...as this warms it begins to smell like latex. That can't be good. Had to drain pour the last 5 ounces because of the massive chunks floating around."

"O - A deft balance of fruit and sour; fairly restrained for an American Wild ale."
"O- Very good peach sour. Thanks Jeff!"
""
""
""
""
"Hazy peach body - lots of ripe fruit - apricot, peach, cherry, grapes. Vinous and oak notes from the wine barrels compliment everything nicely. Nice tartness, a bit of lemon citrus, dry finish. Good stuff - the best of the latest batch of almanac beers"
""
""
""
"Lovely golden yellow that just looks like summer. Ripe fruit nose that is solid, but not huge. This one is quite a bit more sour than most Almanacs, but quite amazing. The interplay between the fruit is superb. You get hints of tart cherries, citrusy apricots and perhaps loquats as the beer rolls over your tongue. The pucker keeps things taut and crisp. This is super refreshing. One of the best from Almanac."
""
"A very well done fruit sour. The fruits add to the experience and are very well integrated. The only real knock is some aftertaste of bready malt but it doesn't take away from the overall experience. The amount of sediment is also a little strange. The bottom half of the bottle was a beer smoothie. Was my bottle filled from the bottom of the barrel? Bottom line - easy drinking and tasty."
""
"O: Incredible, it's kinda like a fruity berliner weisse but they didn't mention the use of any wheat..."
""
""
""

"O-An amazing citrus driven sour. There are beers that are more sour but the fruit flavor in this beer is amazing."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy, golden wheat color with a medium white head that goes down quickly. Scent is very fruity up front. Not sweet fruit, but the kinda fruit aroma you get when you walk through a field of trees or plants that grow fruit. Tart aromas with a hint of chardonnay. More chardonnay as the beer warms a bit. Taste is very tart up front. Loquats, lemons, and apricots provide a lovely fruity balance. The cherries are very difficult to find in the flavor. This one is pretty sour. A good amount of wine barrel...I'm assuming chardonnay barrels were uses. The fruit and sourness mesh so well with this one. Has a slight wheat flavor to it. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Somewhat puckering. Drinkability is extremely high. Overall, this beer is outstanding. To me, it drinks like a berliner. Perfect for a hot, summer day. You could tell me the ABV was 4.0%, and I would believe it. A lovely, dry, sour ale with a lot of stone fruit flavor."

"Farm to barrel concept with local cherries and apricots"
""
""
"Really enjoyed this sour, one that is easy to find and worth the try. High recommendation"
"Pour is deep golden amber in color with a fairly tight white head. Nose is fruity with a balance of dry wood. Peaches seem most prevalent of the fruits involved but there is a tartness in back. Taste actually has a lot more cherry. The wood is still present, light touch of alcohol in the finish with strong carbonation and a very dry finish. Cherries run through the back, fairly tart and sour. Light notes of brett underneath, nicely done. Really like this brewery."

"O: I like this barrel forward vanilla bourbon brew. Its dry, tart and refreshing while still being mind boggling yet strangely familiar. Worth a try especially for ya'll Yay Area Brew fan boys like my self."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty sour with big lactic presence. Fruity but not very definitive. If the sourness was toned down a bit you would get more of the fruits. I like this plenty but I enjoyed Brandy Peche more. Farmers Reserve 3 would come next followed by this here. Nicely crafted sours coming out of Almanac!"
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, cherry, apricot, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour apricot and white wine flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite tasty with its sour fruit and wine combination."

"This is a WOW beer, the dynamic of the fruit, sourness and wine barrels is captivating and lively. Very clean, features the fruit without the funk. Almanac sours do have a brand of tartness about them likely due to use of the same bacteria and yeast strains but this one is especially flavorful in comparison."
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing and well done."
""
""
"Light body and mildly carbonated. The diacetyl knocks the flavor down a few notches unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fruit forward sour that pairs well with food."
"This may be the best sour I have had to date. I definitely pickup the cherry. The wine barrel aging gives it a wine like character. Carbonation is very fine like a bubbly white wine. The sour is not over powering, but definitely there. This is perfect for a lazy afternoon drink. Need to rush out and pickup a couple more bottles!"

"It's a little too lemony for my taste, but this is a nice sour. True sour heads should enjoy this one. Actually.. I think I might prefer this over RR Beat cause it's got a bit more layers of complexity."
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely loved this beer and am looking forward to getting a couple more. Definitely sour. Had it back to back with the sourdough ale and this one prevailed victorious by a long shot in my opinion. Thanks Almanac for this awesome beer. It was similar to Anderson Valley's Rosy Barl to me. Next up, the bourbon sour porter. Should be great!"
