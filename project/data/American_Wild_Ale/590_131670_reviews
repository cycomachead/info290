"Very impressive! Sort of reminded me of supplication but the Michigan peaches made me like this that much more. Despite being close to 2 years old, the peaches could not have tasted any more fresh and everything about this beer just seemed so fresh. Very nice blend of fresh peaches, oak, bourbon, leather, and supposedly horse (not a flavor familiar to me, just reading from the label). Would like to obtain another bottle in the future or if I'm lucky enough to try the elusive vsb."

"One of the best out there without a doubt"

"I'm not a huge sour fan, but this was as good a sour as I've tried."
"Steasy66, unnatural feelings for you bro."
""
""
"O-The best sour I have ever had."
""
"This tasted like a slightly less sugary peach ring gummy. So peachy, slight sourness. Very tasty if you love peaches."
""
""
""
""
"It taste like you are biting into a peach, literally. Not sour at all like I expected. Great beer."
"Hazy burnt orange pour, with a small wispy layer of off-white bubbles that held pretty good. In the nose, funk and peach, not overly sour. Lots of fresh peach flesh in the taste, again, not overly tart and sour, somewhat earthy and mulchy, leather and a little farmhouse. Also some almond in there; wonder if they left the pits in the peaches. Body was medium, mouthfeel wasn't really crisp like I prefer in beers like this, more chewy, with a toned-down acidity. Not bad."

"Overall:  New Glarus is gifted when it comes to fruit beers and while this one is more of a fruit beer than a wild ale it is still incredible"

"Was this an actual beer or was I drinking a peach?  This was sooooo good.  Fantastic.  Top 5 wilds I've had"
""

""
""

"O: Delicious Peach Bomb.  The dry tart finish brings balance that I imagine might only improve with a little more time in the bottle."

""
""
"Tastes and smells like biting into a fresh peach. Nothing short of astonishing."
""
""
""
"The flavor follows with that same peach ring flavor, both being candy sweet and creamy. There's then some apple cider vinegar as the Oud Bruin base gently comes through. Medium plus tart and a fun fun beer with that candy quality."
""
"This. Is. Amazing. I had a taste of Very Sour Blackberry a while back & it was excellent & this continues the trend. New Glarus might be the new masters in this country of the wild ale. Excellent beer that’s only a spare whiskers away from the elite."
""
"This is literally the most insane beer."
""
""
""
""
"It was a nice peach beer with a bit of sour character, but I expected more from New glarus. Waiting in line for 20 minutes was not worth it."
"Not worth the price of admission. Delicious but I can also buy a Lipton's peach iced tea for $1.50."
"At best this is a slightly soured fruit beer. Calling this a wild ale is a shame. If you like fruit beers you will enjoy this. If your actually looking for a wild ale with any sort of complexity steer clear. This is definitely the last beer I'll be having from ng"
""
"The overwhelming aroma and taste element is peach ring candy. Tasty but that slight artificiality was a detriment for me."
""
""
""

"Bottle in trade from @jbwimer. Thanks man! Excited for this one. Poured to my Firestone Walker Barrelworks Teku. Pours dark hazy orange with a big fluffy off white head that sticks around a bit with some big bubbles. Aroma is insane fresh peaches, even feels like I can smell the peach fuzz, a bit of dry oak, then more juicy peaches. Flavor follows with a lightly sour fresh peach flavor, hints of oak throughout, just a tad bit of bourbon, a light sweetness. The tart-sweet-dry balance here is rather incredible. Medium bodied, some prickly plus carbonation, sweet and smooth. Yep. This is good. Nobody integrates fruit like New Glarus."
""
"Had at ABR. Remember how peachy it was. This bottle is still the same. This beer does such a great job of bringing the peach flavor into the mix. This is the best fruit sour I've had."
"Pours amber-orange with a thin white head.  Smell is peach schnapps, gummy peach candy.  The smell is good in a way, but not what I expected to find in a beer.  Very artificial.  Taste follows the nose a bit along with a very slight tartness.  I would not call this beer sour at all.  Big peach punch at the beginning and then the taste disappears, nothing on the finish.  Mouthfeel is light as a cloud, very interesting.  Overall I thought this beer tasted very good but was let down by high expectations."
""
""
""
""
"O- best peach nose on a beer that I've ever smelled.  Drinks like a fine sour brown with fresh peaches"
""
"The tastes, as expected, is super juicy and full of extremely sweet peach candy. This definitely does not have a fresh fruit peach taste. Perfumey would probably be another appropriate adjective. Peach candy all the way with hints of a mild earthy grainy dryness in the finish. Drying finish, with a lingering sweetness in the aftertaste.Very frothy but fairly soft carbonation with a little bit of a tingle."

""
""
""
"Pours cloudy bronze with a nice full creamy head. Lots of fresh peach in both smell and taste. Moderately sour with a nice funkiness. Lightly sweet and not acidic at all. Body has a light, slick, and clean feel. Not life changing, but very easy to drink and just an all around good beer."

"O: this beer is definitely not ""Very Sour Peach"" or even really a peach ""sour.""  Probably splitting hairs but i would describe this as a slightly tart peach brown ale with brett for what that is worth.  Peach oud bruin maybe.  Different than i expected but the rich peach taste and balanced complexity more than make up for this.  Maybe the peachiest beer I have ever had which makes it a winner in my book."

"O: Very glad I traded for it. ""It's no VSB"" I keep hearing this. Well, let's see about that when I pop the VSB"

"Just might be the best smelling beer I've ever had. Smells like old lady peach pie. Graham crackers, peach jam, ripe peaches, brown sugar. Mercy me... Based on reviews I was expecting less sourness, but I thought the tartness was just right. Peach flavor wasn't as pronounced as the aroma, but still more than satisfactory. What a drinking experience. I didn't want it to end."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, after finally tasting this beast I have to say I'm a bit underwhelmed.  I'd have to say the best thing about this beer is the mouthfeel.   I do get obvious peach,  but not smack you in the face peach.  I get a bitterness in the finish that kinda comes out of nowhere which is interesting.  Overall, I'm happy to say I tried it, but generally I'm whatever about it."

"D/O: A remarkable beer, eminently drinkable. The balance of malt- and yeast-driven flavors is superb, with both contributing necessary complexity while allowing the fresh peach flavors to play the starring role. Truly great stuff."
""
"Third and best bottle of this one.  Tastes like candied peach rings."
""
""
""
"Overall - Well, it's nothing like VSB.  I know that's not the fairest comparison, but aside from a great peach flavor, it isn't the most outstanding beer."
""

"O - A real delight. If NG keeps putting out offerings like this from the beer cave, I expect this brewery will be even more famous than it already is. This is the real deal."

"Pours a dark orange brown color with some chunks of yeast in the body. Lots of carbonation and head. Smells like those peach ring candies. Buttery highly bubbly mouthfeel. Not as tart as I thought it’d be. Actually kind of sweet. Some peach taste. It’s pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy orange / copper body with an inch of soapy tan head. Malty peach aroma, akin to a fuzzy navel, minus the alcohol sweetness. Sweet peach juice. Hints of white wine, bready yeast, perhaps a touch of lacto. Sweetness prevails mid palate leading to a tart, puckering finish. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is hazed brown with red hues and a lot of tight off white head.  Nose is very bright perfume like peach and tangerine with a touch of dusty brett.  Taste has that same perfume like peach and tangerine, more brett, a tiny bit empty in the finish with a moderate bitterness.  Body is very juicy, a touch oily, well carbonated."
""
"Perhaps in the top three best aromas I have ever smelled in beer. So many peach beers lack actual peach flavor and aroma but this is the exact opposite. Peaches in a bottle paired with a great sour Brown base makes for a world-class brew. New Glarus does Fruit Beers how they should be. There are very few beers this well made."
"Overall: this is a winner. I loved it and am sad to have finished the bottle."

"Amazing peach in both the smell and flavor, but the malty base beer throws this off a little bit and doesn't work as well with the peach as I'd hoped. Still, one of the best peach flavors I've ever experienced in a beer."

"She's a winner.  Well done New Glarus.  I didn't and likely will not have VSB, but this is delicious.  Someone mentioned that this isn't a sour bomb (though I think it's more sour than others, can't wait to see what this does over time) and they are mostly correct and resembles more of a sour brown with peach and wild fruit notes.  It also says that on the bottle!  R&D Wild Peach is honestly a pretty simple brew, but in a very tactical, brilliant way.  Drink up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: glad I got to try this one. I've been curious since the whole new glarus sour explosion, and i was not let down at all. great fruit taste, a nice refreshing tartness and good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well the R&D department hit it out of the ballpark on this one as far as the wild peach goes. Just a fantastic peach bomb here. Would like some more sourness, but it's pretty clear the complexities of this beer are going to develop nicely over time. Drinking this one next to Fuzzy made it practically not sour at all in comparison. Can't wait for this beer in another 6 months to a year time!"
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic beer, reminds me a lot of what sour in the rye with peaches was like when it was first releast. Peach up front and center. NG tearing up the fruit beer department once again!"
"This reeked of peaches and was extremely fruity, par for the course for new glarus. Taste was bright and champagne-like at first, but never kicked in with a substantial tartness or acidity. Peach flavor prominent throughout, but the lack of acid made it unbalanced and a little watery. This drinks great now, but should improve in the upcoming months."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is really good, but I see the potential for a lot more dryness and sourness as this ages.  I can see this beer becoming a pretty big deal in 6 months for those hardcore sour lovers out there.  Dan has done it again! Another awesome fruited wild ale by Dan Carey!"

"The nose on this beer is unreal.  It smells like canned peaches, a fresh bag of peach rings, and the freshest peach flesh you've ever picked from an orchard.  Really hard to not just keep smelling this beer.  The color of the beer looks like caramelized peaches in a cobbler.  Light brown essentially.  Nice wispy carb throughout.  You get that distinct natural fermentation smell and taste that really set these open fermentation beers apart.  Really light lemony tartness and a rich peach flavor.  Not as much peach as the nose, but as much as I've ever had from a beer.  The carb carries the flavor perfectly and this beer does nothing but get better as it warms.  This isn't big on sour.  It's a naturally fermented beer with some light funk and some tartness.  Seek this beer out if you love peaches, not if you desire tongue-buckling sourness."

"4.0 for now. I'll re-review in a year."

"Pours a deep orange with some haziness and generous bone white head.  Nose is chock full of candied peach.  Bright and sweet peach flesh notes with a touch of sugar and a hint of lactobacillus in the background.  The aroma is fantastic!  The taste starts with notes of wild yeast, then comes the sour brown base.  Light malty notes are followed by moderate tartness and then the finish is all peach.  Again, fresh and bright peach notes with a clean and slightly sweet finish. The acidity on this is mild for a sour beer, but I get the sense that age will bring on a more forward tartness.  Mouthfeel is medium with a moderate to high level of carbonation (no gushing as the special warning stated was possible).  Overall, a very successful peach brew.  Probably falls a bit short of Fuzzy, but either way, one of the best peach beers around."

"Overall, damn, this beer is legit. Almost 2-Legit. 2-Legit 2-Quit! AND IT WAS $8!!! haha! oh Wisconsin, you are so generous with your Midwestern Whalez. So happy I was able to FIB my way up there and get some. Thank you Cheeseheads for producing such an amazing beer! cheers!!!"

"O - Rumors circulated around the long lines leading up to procuring this rare beer on a hot Saturday at New Glarus that it was ""OK""; that it wasn't bold with peach presence or as sour as their previous R&D release, Very Sour Blackberry. Simply put, those rumors are false - ok, maybe it's not quite as sour as VSB, but they're different beers. New Glarus' Wild Peach, a sour fruit beer from THE fruit beer master, Dan Carey, is rich with fresh peach aroma and flavor so pungent, it's like biting into a real peach. Underlying maltiness provides a complex and delicious base for the wild yeast's playground; funky, sour, and refreshing, this unique and flavorful beer is where it's at."
""
""
"O: Light, flavorful, and highly drinkable. Tartness is so light that you could down a lot of this. Not much complexity but certainly refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Re-review 2/13/2015. About 8 months post-release. I just have to add that this is nothing short of astounding. This has really evolved over the past year to develop more of an acidity and funk without any fading of the peach flavours. Incredibly, the aroma smells very Fou' Foune-like, and if you know how I like my beers, that's high praise. It doesn't follow as well on the palate, but it's still very peach forward and funky. I highly recommend this beer without reservation. It will likely continue to drink very well from here on."
"I guess the biggest thing of note here is that this is named appropriately, and those expecting the Very Sour Peach, or an identical beer to VSB with peach as a substitute, are bound to be confused or disappointed. Those looking for a peach forward sour brown with a hint of wild character and the potential for increased sourness over time will likely be quite pleased."
""
""
""
"Yum a dumm dumm"
"Overall, another fantastic R&D from New Glarus. Not only is the beer great (and so reasonable at $8!), but Dan and Deb really ran a classy release. Looking forward to having another of these in six months to a year to see how a little more time affects it."
