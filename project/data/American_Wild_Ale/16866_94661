4.05,-5.8,4,4,4,4,4.25,"i have not had a ton of blueberry sours, i can recall evil twin, cascade, and a handful of others, and this is definitely up there with the best of them. a great use of blueberries and a rather sour lambic type brew. the pour is gorgeous, deep dark pink, sort of purple, but way darker than raspberry or cherry beers obviously from the skins of the berries. good inch of white foam too. it smells like lacto first, extremely acidic and oaky, a good indication that the base beer is outstanding, which it is. similar to rueuze really, maybe less complex, but the same sourness is present. the berries dont add a ton to the smell, maybe some generic fruitiness, but its hard to identify them specifically. the taste is a whole different story, the blueberries are right up front and center, ripe and tart, just a little sweet, blueberry preserves and lemon juice carry through the whole flavor. the finish is all acid, i can taste the blonde sour through the fruit. its a similar base for the bruery i think, it seems familiar to me, but the blueberries transform it. they say to drink it fresh, and this bottle is over a year old, but certainly i dont think the fruit has fallen off much, its really buzzing. nice carbonation, no leftover sugar, and just a really well made fruit brew from the bruery, who seems to have these styles on lock.","StonedTrippin","May 24, 2014"

The nose features a great balance between lactobacillus tartness and blueberry flesh. Notes of oak are present as well. The taste is super tart up front and followed by nice bright blueberry notes. This reminds me a bit of sucking on a Warhead candy. The outside is tart and puckering and the inside is like candied fruit. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation.

The nose is a distinct blueberry with a touch of vinegar and malt. The taste is an intense washing of blueberries on the palate, some sweetness following, and a lingering tartness. It's mouthfeel is definitely medium bodied, slightly under-carbonated, bone dry, and fruity. This is definitely a delicious sour, comparable to many blueberry sours, bright and fruity, but also slap in the face sour.","ThePorterSorter","Feb 28, 2014"

No big deal, regardless, but particularly not for a sour. The aroma shows off the sourness right away. Lots of acetic and lactic sourness. Lemons and oak. The blueberries come through but get a bit muddled and could definitely be brighter and fruitier. This is a beer to drink sooner rather than later - probably a bit late with this bottle, already. Some vanilla. It's pleasant enough but fairly simple and a touch harsh. The fruit doesn't show up as juicy as I'd like, and there's a sort of bile-ish note to it. More than anything, it doesn't have the funk delicacy of better sours. Taste is similarly a bit too harsh and simple. The acidity is strong and needs to be dialed back so other flavors can shine. Sour blueberries and oak. Finish is a bit gummy as the acidity passes. The vanilla shows up again. Lots of pucker. A bit tough to drink after the first six-ish ounces. Happy to have tried it but it didn't live up to expectations. The base sour just isn't quite my cup of tea.","popery","Jan 08, 2014"

The brightness and sweetness of the berries is wonderful with the moderately lactic and rather yogurty sourness (closer to buttermilk, actually). The lemony sour notes also appear early up. The mid-palate has a moderate sweetness, surprising given the sourness, that has flavors of jammy berries, a little honey and simple syrup. A touch of spice - cinnamon? - is also present. The finish is a classic American sour beer finish, with a dextrinous sweetness, pronounced lactic sourness, a moderately jammy fruity character and a little vanilla. This is a combination that is especially hard to do well, and is done wonderfully here. There is a touch of dry white wine vinegar, especially in the backend. Tannin character is moderate, with a blend of skin and oak tannins complementing the lactic sourness. Wonderful stuff. Do not age this anymore, it's wonderful as is.","DefenCorps","Oct 17, 2013"

Taste is sweet blueberries up front, followed by sour raspberries and tart blueberry skin. Super ripe blueberries with other tart berries. Very berry-forward with a nice lactic sourness. Some nice funk in the flavor, just as the nose hinted. Puckering finish. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, crisp and lip-smacking tart. Drinkability is very high.

Not a lot of sweetness in here, but towards the finish, I get some tart blueberry and cream notes. Touch of lemon and lactic sourness on a dry finish. Carbonation in here is perfect and really works with the sourness.","notchucknorris","Beers"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of sour, tart, and funky with fruity and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with lots of berry flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is super tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","0"
