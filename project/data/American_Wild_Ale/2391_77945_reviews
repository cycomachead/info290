"Somewhat unpleasant phenolic band-aid aftertaste dominates the finish turning a very delightful and delicate beer the wrong direction."
"Very sour. Reminds me of a blueberry mead I made once. Very low carbonation but the body is neutral. Long sour aftertaste."

"I'm typically a big fan of Cascade's sours but this one had a very strong phenolic flavor (band-aids) which almost ruined it for me."

"Deep purple in color, translucent with a slightly hazy appearance due to the carbonation. Large creamy white head that dies down quickly leaving a thin uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer and lots of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Great sweet and sour aroma; you can smell the sweet fruit followed by a noticeable musty, sour finish. Taste starts with a fruity blueberry flavor followed by a sour and slightly dry finish. Very thirst-quenching. Light to medium body, slightly fizzy from the large amount of light carbonation. Overall a very unique beer. The best blueberry beer that I have ever had. I would definitely purchase again."

"i havent had a ton of beer from cascade, but one takeaway from the ones i have had, is that these guys may well be the king of fruit. their apricot is just divine, and this blueberry is just as well done. deep dark purple in color, all from the fruit, i can see a probable blonde beer base underneath, but the stain from the berries is deep. a nose thats more sour than it is fruity, with lots of mellowing oak and then the fruit punch complex of the blueberries, which are as tart as they are sweet. the flavor follows a similar format, sourness first mostly on the front end, before the fruit ramps up. the berries do add some sugar that isnt all the way fermented out, which i like, because its a nice balance to the sourness. i think the true flavor of the blueberry here is as authentic and prominent as the apricot, although i think the apricot it a better beer, the use of fruit and brewing expertise on display is the same. jammy middle before the wood softens the finish. its earthy and summery and reminds me of a place i would like to be, out in a blueberry patch in august gorging myself until my face and hands are stained purple. a special beer, the best blueberry beer ive ever had by leaps and bounds."

"pours a dark purple with a nice finger inch white fizzy head that dissipates quickly. smell is a tad sour with some fruit...blueberries for sure. taste starts out fairly tart but does dissipate quick. the fruit takes over and there is a good blueberry flavor to this one though it doesnt linger on the palate. slight sourness at the back end. pretty good! medium carbonation, medium bodied. pretty tasty...recommended."

"Overall- Certainly not the best that Cascade has made. I do not recommend this one."
""
"Overall, another fantastic one from Cascade. In my limited experience, they are really good at knocking out the ""single fruit"" sour beers like this one and the kriek (cherry) and apricot. Blueberry is especially great because of the unique look it imparts on the beer from the coloring as well as the natural tartness of blueberries. I'm only a tad curious to know how this one might've tasted closer to the bottling date, but based on how good it is a year old, I'd gladly take a bottle of any vintage that was offered."
"Overall: Cascade has a way with sour fruit beers; always enjoyable to try them"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a slightly hazy reddish purple color with a small off white head. The aroma has a nice blueberry fruit character, mildly tart, woody, mild acidity, some earthy notes and light funk. The flavor is moderate blueberry fruit, wood, lightly acidic, mildly tart with some earthy qualities. This is not overly sour and doesnâ€™t have the massive fruit punch of a Belgian Red, but this is still tasty and definitely worth trying."

"O: Probably the best blueberry I've had with the best example of blueberry flavor imparted in a beer. More flavor came through than expected, well done."

"I had to come back and add this to the review. As it warms up, and the more i drink it the more the blueberry comes out. Still not as sour as i would of hoped for, but it still is young. I like it more the more i drink it."
""
""
""

"O: This is a great sour, but not my favorite from Cascade (Apricot). The blueberries add an incredible visual flair to this beer, but not much else. I was underwhelmed with their presence in the aroma and taste of the beer. I wish I could taste the blueberries more, but the acid kinda blows them out. In a blind taste test, I'd have a hard time believing anybody would identify this as a blueberry beer. One other minor complaint I have is the carbonation level. It was a bit too high on this beer for my taste, which is odd considering I didn't find that with the Apricot. Overall, a highly recommended sour but not the best Cascade does."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage. Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 1-2 finger foamy light pink head with decent retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with tons of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tart blueberry, green apple, cherry, pear, raspberry, pepper, hay, funk, oak, clove, leather, red wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of blueberry notes with fruity/spicy yeast and barrel presence; and big strength. Taste of tart blueberry, blueberry skin, green apple, pear, raspberry, pepper, hay, grass, oak, clove, funk, leather, red wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blueberry, apple, pear, raspberry, pepper, oak, clove, hay, funk, red wine, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of blueberries with fruity/spicy yeast and barrel notes; with a fantastic balance of malt/acidity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, prickly, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Blueberry sour ale! All around great complexity and balance of blueberry with fruity/funky yeast and oak character; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Yet another damn good sour from Cascade. I'm somewhat partially to blueberry stuff, as blueberries are higher up on the list of fruits and fruit flavors I really enjoy. Blueberries tend to get lost in some sour ales, but not here. Wonderfully fruity, heavily tart, and painfully acidic, this beer will make any sour fan go nuts."

"O - Very good sour beer. I was especially interested in trying this being a blueberry lover and already a fan of Cascade sours. Would have liked a bit more flavor character from the fruit...the sour overpowered the fruit and lost some of the dimension the fruit could have yielded. Definitely wouldn't mind having this one again."

"Super acidic and sour, puckering with light acetic sharpness, and a very dry finish. Salivary glands work into overdrive. Medium bodied with light carbonation, almost like sparkling juice. It's drinkable and satisfies the sour fix, though it's a little one-dimensional overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I continue to be a fan of American sours with their cleaner, sharper sour notes than their Belgian counterparts (at least in my experience). Not as heavy on the blueberry as I would have preferred, but I would certainly be happy to drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic fruit sour. Well-balanced, and showcasing both the blueberries and sour in complementary ways. Something about Cascade's sours really resonates with me, and this is another big hit."
""
""
""
"This is my first experience with Cascade and I'm certainly excited to try more. I've had a lot of sours that really make you pucker lately, and I love them, but this is nice and balanced. More in the realm of Raspberry Tart than My Blueberry Nightmare."
"Overall- A nice sour from Cascade. Would be great for beginners and veteran sour fans alike."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I really liked it but not quite as much as I was hoping I would. I love blueberry and wanted a touch more fruit flavor but overall it was a very solid brew. Love that a couple more are a click away if I want them."
""
"Love this beer. It's one of the best from Cascade and it's usually pretty easy to find. I really like that I can actually taste the blueberry and know that it's not some fake flavoring, that they're real blueberries in there, and a ton of them! Great beer."
""
""
""
"Smelled very good but it did not carry over to where it really counts. Also surprised by the lack of actual blueberry flavor."
"very nice sour, funky and earthy but I think it could use just a little more fruit but its a very minor complaint. This one's working well with this warm June afternoon, maybe a little to easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite nice, great fresh and tart blueberries, great sour flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first Cascade, and I think I picked a good one to start with. Great overall beer, and looking forward to grabbing another."
""
"Overall- Cascade comes through again. Really good stuff, even though it doesn't come cheap, it's definitely worth picking up or ordering from their site."
""
""
""
""
"Massive fresh blueberry flavor in this beer with a great sour and wild ale feel. Better than some of the lambics that come from Brussels and you could trick me if you blind poured it for me. Great tart fruit flavor lingers."
""
""
""
"Like every other Cascade beer I've had, this beer is not on the cheap side. A beer of this quality can't be cheap to make and it shows it. Other than that, if you like blueberries and sour beers, you might want to open your wallet to this beer. It is certainly a unique beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright blue-purple - looks rad, with a light head. Dense blueberry aromas with a concentration of deeply flavored skins. Lots of acid on the nose, tart and puckering on the palate. Not pulling a ton of oak at first, but more as it warms. Deeply fruited with the familiar Cascade acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Great beer. I've loved everything from Cascade so far and this is one of my favorites. I will seek this out again for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"T: Opens with a nice tart hit of blueberries. Some lemon zest, apple cider vinegar, raspberry puree, some green apple and some unripe blueberries on the finish. Not as sweet as I was expecting, which was actually a good thing. A light, prickly carbonation and a bit of dryness on the finish."
""
"O - I really liked this beer. It's about 2 years old at this point, which I think did it well. The blueberry definitely isn't prominent, which may have to do with the age, but the balance of berry flavors as well as the funkiness are very well blended. Very enjoyable, elegant almost. I would definitely pick this up again, limited only by the price, which is too high."
"O - Solid sour with a good fruit presence to it and tartness that almost makes you pucker. The one sad part was that I didn't get as much blueberry as I did raspberry."
"Overall a run of the mill cascade brew, nothing stands out against their other sours, however stands out against most other breweries. It's a bit over priced for how much a bottle goes for, but would be ideal to bring to a tasting or bottle share"
""
"O - it was a pleasure to drink, but not quite as enjoyable as Cascade Kriek and Apricot."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall pretty nice but mostly the appearance and the nose is the mose impressive part."

"My new love affair with Cascade begins. This is the third of theirs I have tried, including Noyeaux, and Apricot. Poured from bottle into Jester King farmhouse glass. Pours a violet/red hazy color, a thin line of head circles the rim of the glass. Aroma- vinegar funk mixed with rose petal and a blueberry wafty ending. Reminds me of smelling smashed fresh blueberry, no artificial flavors detected. Aroma is amazing. Taste- some tart flavors, but not puckeringly sour. The fruit is very present, I get more of that raw blueberry flavor without the sweetness. Very dry finish with some barnyard funky aftertaste. I was expecting this to be much more sour but this is really a celebration of the blueberry flavor that stays true to it without becoming cloying, sweet, or artificial. As it warms, more of the funk comes out. I get a little bit of band aid on the end- it's not distracting but you can tell that Brett worked a little in here. Nice mouthfeel- I swear I might have had some blueberry pulp in there, maybe some seeds. Good carbonation. I really like this beer- I think its an excellent example of a fruit beer but it has a ways to go before it obtains fruit lambic like sourness and acidity."
""
""
"O: Another wonderful Wild from America's best Wild Ale brewery. Simply amazing!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is my first cascade and I have to say wow this is one of the best beers I've ever had. I love the sweet tart flavor without being over the top and it is crazy drinkable very impressed highly recommend"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a light bodied, very bright red grape reddish purple with a highly active, one finger slightly pink head. The nose is bright and tart. It instantly hits you with fresh blueberry juice, a healthy dose of dry Brett, and a nice level of acidity. The slightly sweet blueberry character works well with opposing, bretty funk. It smells much more authentic than the 2011, which I found to be too sweet and artificial. The flavors are instantly dry and tart with a lot of Brett to pair with the blueberry, which has a great blueberry muffin aspect. The acidity is perfect and provides a nice level of sourness. It drinks light with a healthy amount of carbonation. It leaves both ends of the flavor spectrum in the after taste, which is unique and fun to experience. Overall this beer was very enjoyable and I really, really enjoyed it. I'm glad that this beer changed significantly from 2011. I would definitely snag this one again if possible."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a pleasant amount of tartness and natural flavoring that is mildly tannic. The blueberry inclusion was felt more in the nose than anything which is understandable. Id have this again if the opportunity presented itself."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fine sour but I wouldn't call it amazing. Something I could certainly drink alot of though, if it weren't for cost and availability. Recommended."
""
"O: Didn't blow me away. Really wanted more blueberry and more puckering sourness. Even the lacto character wasn't as strong as I had figured it would be. Still good, just not great."
""
""
"Overall another interesting, well-executed fruit sour from Cascade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Better than the strawberry. A good sour, they seem to be making good ones."
"I think I am beginning to understand to understand a pattern with Cascade sours. They are damp. Like a dirty, wet, water-damaged basement. This is good, but the level of musty is a bit too much. Regardless, this a lovely beer."
"Macerated blueberry magic. Tart and light and fruity. Could use a bit more tart funkiness, but it's solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Trying to look for something wrong with this beer and just can't find it...absolute perfection"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like. I did expect to like it more than I did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty. The lactic character threatens to make the beer one-noted, but assertive flavors from the wood and fruit balance things out."
"(O)- Just further proof to me that Cascade has easily one of the top 3 or 4 sour programs in the states. This was the more recent batch of this and I see no reason why I would sit on it further since the fresh fruit is what makes this so good right now."
""
"So many bottles being poured from a basket... Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly cloudy magenta topped by a finger of lightly off-pink foam. The nose comprises light funk mixed with sweet Concorde grapes. That might sound odd, but it is rather pleasant. The taste brings in more of the same, though now a strong current of tart blueberry flowing through the proceedings. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very enjoyable beer, one that doesn't bludgeon with the sour, but also doesn't leave you wanting more. Good times."
""
""
""
"O- Nicely done! The beer is funky and soured but never goes into a stomach churning experience. This beer was very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Haven't been disappointed yet by Cascades sour brews. This is no exception. I just wish I could find some to cellar too. That's half the fun of rare beer tasting."
""
""
""
""
"Great brew from Cascade. A yummy take on the fruit sours. Nice chalky and earthy with some good fruit sweetness and tartness and some slight balsamic notes. (4.0)"
""
"Lighter medium body, dry and bubbly on the tongue. Decent enough feature of the blueberry, but doesnt quite stack up to their other fruited wild ales (Apricot, Kriek, etc)."
"D - Not bad, but I think Cascade makes a number of stronger offerings. I probably should have drank this immediately, as the blueberries seem to have lost some potency over the last 9 months. Reminds me a little of Upland's Blueberry lambic. Easy to drink in any case; we had no problem polishing off the 750ml bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"If this were cheaper and easier to obtain I'd probably keep a bottle of this around at all times."
""
"Overall: very tasty and drinkable, with a complex wild character and refreshing fruit flavor. I'd definitely have this again."
""
"O - Overall, this is a very, very delicious beer. Incredibly pleased I was able to get a bottle as this was just top notch. Wish more breweries would make blueberry based wilds. Well done Cascade."
""
"O: a great sour, really like the way they made this one work overall, great balance between the sour and the blueberry. Really enjoyed this."
""
"O- A really nice fruited sour, as usual a delicious offering from Cascade, I'll be looking forward to getting this again next year."
"Overall: Another winner from cascade! They really do brew fantastic sours!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very easy drinking sour, nice blueberry flavor. Another great offering from Cascade."
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy yet vibrant rose color with a thin white head that fades quickly. The nose is a also a quite vibrant and tart blueberry, which I feel is distinct and true to the fruit. However, the taste isn't nearly as distinctly blueberry. It's an initial rush of sourness that fades quickly into something sweet fruity. It has an amazing mouthfeel that has just the right amount of sourness, lingering fruit, and residual dryness. This is an enjoyable beer that I'd definitely try again."
""
"M: It's a light medium bodied brew. High carbonation makes it easy to drink. Prickly on the tongue."
"Really enjoyed this one. I split the 750, but could have easily downed the whole thing myself. Very puckering without ever getting too sour and some good bright berry/fruit flavors. Ordered a few more of these after how much the girlfriend and I enjoyed this one."
""
"D - Another favorite of the day. Could probably drink this non-stop, seeing as blueberries are just about my favorite fruit (should have put a disclaimer at the front of the review)"
""
""
""
"A very nice sour. It lacks a bit of the funk I'm used to in a cascade sour, but non the less very enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: This is a very nice easy drinking sour. Would drink again."
""
""
""
"Blueberry isn't a fruit that imparts a great deal of flavor into sour beers. Nevertheless, its presence is felt in this one and gives the tartness some nice character. A solid beer overall and one I'd rank on par with some of the other American Blueberry sours out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall nice good blueberry notes with just a bit of funkiness."
""
""
"This was a disappointment. I didn't expect as much brett funk, but did expect more blueberry. The proportions of these two seemed reverse of what they should have been. OK, but certainly far behind other Cascade sours I've tasted."
"Nice pretty blueberry juice color with some pink tinted white rimming of foam. Nose is blueberry, sour vinous grains, surprisingly grassy and back country with hints of hay and soil. Flavor pulls out a good sharp, astringent sourness with strong blueberry flavors and a good full bodied feeling with low carb and an off dry finish. A good beer. I would buy a few bottles if available. I think I prefer the Apricot over this one."
""
""
"Overall, though, it's a drinkable and pleasant brew. The crisp acidity is not overwhelming, and it's smooth enough and bright enough to keep it interesting. I think it was one of the low-lights of the visit, however."
""
"This one was a part of cmrilloâ€™s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a ruby red pink with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, blueberry, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, blueberry, wood, tart, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It was stated at the tasting that since Steve Kim wasnâ€™t here, which meant no one brought the BlÃ¥bÃ¦r, that this one would have to do. While it was definitely not on the same level it was definitely a very nice brew that was on par with it and Uplandâ€™s version. This one was a lot easier to get as well which makes me wonder why I didnâ€™t buy a case of these when I had a chance. An absolute must try if you have not done so already and if you have, you already understand."
""
"Was fortunate enough to try the experimental precursor to this beer (the van der jon berry), but IMHO, this is clearly superior to that beer."
""
"D - Not as cool as it's scarcity, but still a pretty good beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost a kriek and very tasty. Yet another great offering from cascade."
"Had it again in late 2012, that batch, might be even better than the one I wrote the review for."
"(182nd)"
"O: it was pretty solid all around but was not as sour as some of their other offerings."
""

""

""
"Amazing."

"Thanks ArchEnemyBrew"
""

"Overall- Very good beer. I can tell that I am getting use to sour beers and enjoying them. Cascade is going to become part of my regular stops if they keep this up. 4.5/5"
"this just never really won me over. i love cascade and everything has been rock solid but this just was lacking for me."
"O - This is the poor man's BlÃ¥bÃ¦r, and that is meant as a big compliment. Really enjoyed this one and glad I have a couple more bottle to enjoy throughout the rest of the year. Drink now, drink later, drink often."
""
"Drink- Better as this one warms up. Great layered flavors on this with a lot of fruit and a small sour. I like the smoothness and crispness."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty, tasty sour. The fruit will probably fade over time, so I would recommend drinking this one fresh. Nice job Cascade."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good brew that is perfectly fine/drinkable now but I can imagine will only improve over time as the sourness will increase and balance the fresh fruit forward flavors."
"O: It was what I expected and more. I will have to seek Cascade's other sours soon!"
""
"O- Near perfection. So effervescent, fruity, but dry, stunning."
"Clear reddish-purple topped by a lasting white head. Great looking beer. Tart blueberry skin aroma, mildly sour with a little sweet blueberry flesh. Palate is balanced, mildly sour with a pleasant lacto character backing up tart and sweet blueberry notes. It's more skin than flesh. Very clean, light finish. Refreshing and enjoyable, but not overly complex. Thankfully doesn't have the stomach churning lacto character of many Cascade sours."
"Pours a slightly murky red with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour and tart blueberries and some funky aromas. Taste is the same with a very sour finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good sour beer with a nice blueberry presence."
""
"Overall â€“ Not as good as I was hoping to put it plainly. Less actual flavor than other Cascade sours. I hope some age will help this beer out."
"O - How do they keep cranking out these amazing beers? Cascade I am glad I still get to visit you."
""
"O: I am very impressed with this beer and this bottle alone justified the purchase of the other three bottles that are sitting in my cellar. I enjoyed this beer so much that I put in an additional order for six more. If you're on the fence about this one, I suggest that you hop on it before its gone. One thing that I loved about this beer is the tamed level of sourness. Other offerings that I have had from Cascade have an extremely aggressive sour bite that overwhelms other aspects of the beer. That is not the case at all with this one. Extremely well balanced. Extremely enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall, this beer stays true to blueberries. I only wish it was even more dense (in berry flavor, not body). Still bound to delight any berry-lover."
"O: It's sour, it's made with blueberries... It's delicious."
""
"Overall: excellent brew. This thing stared me down until I opened one and I am very glad I broke down. Definitely going to order a few more."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty and highly drinkable. Acidity levels aren't over the top, just enough to make it clean and refreshing. Fruit comes through nicely as well. This ranks up among my favorites from Cascade."
"Overall, I am quite pleased to hear this will be released in bottles. I look forward to having this again."
"O: Good"
"Light body with nice carbonation. Beer is very refreshing and easy to drink, but more like a juice drink than a wild ale."
"o - Overall I thought this was an awesome beer. Not quite as sour as some of Cascade's other offerings, but if you like their stuff and blueberry based beers this is a must try. Smells exactly like blueberry pie, with light sourness to it. Looking forward to getting a bottle of this in the future."
"On tap at City Beer Store. Pours a reddish amber with small white head that settles to ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is big lactic with some blueberry sweetness, some light funkiness as well as a light buttery note. The initial taste is big blueberry with some sweetness as well as a sharp lactic tartness. The finish has a touch of butterscotch. Medium body. Medium carbonation. A bit on the sweeter side and very tart."
"Beer tastes nice, like blueberries with a mildly lactic creaminess and tart finish. The fruit is great in this beer, a really nice beer overall and sweet balanced well with the sour. I'd have this again."
"Overall: good beer, looking forward to them perfecting it."

"The body is crisp with clean acidity and a dry, sour finish. Good carbonation. This is an impressive beer and one that I hope becomes a regular offering in Cascade's fruited sour rotation."

"On tap at Chuckâ€™s 85th market. Pours a medium blue/purple color with little head. Smell is funky and sour, plenty of blueberries. Taste is very tart and dry. Plenty of juicy blueberry packed in. Great sour, but can be overwhelming if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re getting in to."
