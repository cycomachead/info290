"Bottles, batch 1 & 4. Batch 1 was the better of the two IMHO. Clear garnet pour with an off white head. Huge raspberry nose. Like eating a raspberry. Average body and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was really, really good. It is lightly tart but not a vinegar bomb, and very fruity. Has some Belgian-style funk to it too which is really cool in an American beer. Very great, would love to have it again."
""
"Nice red color, hazy, with a fizzy white head that held good and dotted the glass with lace. Musty aroma, lots of raspberry, sweet and sour. Great raspberry profile in the taste, tart and crisp, slight jammy sweetness, and a good dose of wet oak. Crisp mouthfeel, medium body, very nice overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"for the style, I don't think it can get any better. crisp and tart upfront, yet somehow finishes creamy. I don't think you can ask anymore out of a wild within these parameters."

"Simply enough, an incredible beer."
""
""
""
"In a weird way reminds me of a Shirley temple"
""
""
""
"The deep, ruby color looks epic in the glass, and you could sniff this in a glass for 10 minutes before even tasting it, it's that good. When in its prime, this is so awesome it's hard not to guzzle it. Each individual sip has so much flavor that lasts in your mouth, though, that you can really stretch out a glass over a long time."

"Huge thanks to @IWannaEatFood for this one. Pretty fucking flawless."

""
""
"O: Good, but not as good as many other similar tasting raspberry sours. To be honest I was a bit disappointed. The taste just wasn't as juicy or full as the nose suggested. I'm splitting hairs though, this was still a very enjoyable beer that I'd gladly drink again."
""
""
""
"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I'd like more sweet fruit and sour yang here and I preferred the nose to the taste. A fun beer, an appreciative opportunity...thanks Bill!..but not a great beer."
""
"Atrial Rubicite did a great job at melding a tart, musty and funky wild ale base with bright raspberry notes. I can understand why this beer receives such amazing scores. Personally, however, I found the raspberry to be understated in the flavor profile. Also, I think that this beer could have benefitted from a bit more residual sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"it's got all the things that are good. Raspberry, Jester King funk, and balance. It's just spot on and hits on ""sour"" more than pie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Outstandingly refreshing and great complexity of fruit flavor mingled with subtle tartness. This is an easily crushable raspberry bomb without the cloying sweetness."
""
""
""
"Great representation of the style, looks good, taste great.."

"As close as wilds get to perfection. More jam than your Grandma's kitchen. Funk and straight raspberry juice. I swear it's like taking a bite. Prickly like black cherry Hansens. This is the truth and I want more."

"O: The raspberry flavors are so real, I caught myself having the check-for-raspberry-seeds-in-the-teeth sensation. But all of the rich flavors present here just disappear right at or just after the swallow - very odd, and not sure why. But this is good…very good. Perhaps not the complexity to the funk profile that Cantillon, etc. has. But more than enjoyable. Very glad I had the chance to try it."

"#500! Love this sour! Big big raspberry taste upfront with the right amount of sour to go with it. Beautiful purplish color with a great nose. Well worth waiting for to have it at 500!"

"The stickler in me wishes there was a bit more in the way of musty earthy funk complexities as this does come off as little one-dimensional, another part of me doesn't care because it's probably the best raspberry profile I've had in a sour. Really great all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A raspberry bomb that reminds me of any great Belgian Framboise and specifically of Rose de Gambrinus in the aroma. Biting assault of fresh raspberries on the taste buds with a complex, rounded out lambic bug mix."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Received a 2014 (April batch date) bottle via trade. Well worth the effort to attain. Atrial is hands down the best tasting sour beer I've had so far. The raspberries were used to perfection."
""
""
""
"So. Much. Raspberry. This is one of the best uses of raspberry ever, up there with New Glarus Raspberry Tart."
""

""
""

"This beer is gorgeous.  A dark ruby body with a nice pink head.  I certainly don't select beers based on their looks... but you gotta give credit where credit is due... and this beer looks like Christina Ricci in black snake moan.  Raspberries dominate the aroma.  A slight sour kick up front in the taste but then the tartness from the raspberries takes over.  A little bit oakey, acidic, with a touch of fruity sweetness.  It's def a sipper but I think that's the point of most wild ales.  You could tell it was unfiltered and unpasturized as there was lots of remnants left at the bottom of the bottle.  I loved every sip of this beer and am very thankful I got to try it."
""
"Incredible sour. Incredible color. Very clean and consistent. My favorite JK sour offering so far."
""
""
""
"One of the most beautiful beers I've seen in the glass -- a luminous ruby/raspberry. Crisp, tart and dry. The raspberry fruit is absolutely huge and bright. Yet, it is not cloying in any way. World class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A barrel aged beauty of mature sour beer that had several hundred pounds of raspberries added it. It pours a dark ruby color with a little head that disappears quickly. The aroma of raspberry hits you immediately. The taste is initially sour but the tartness of the raspberry quickly overtakes that. It finishes slightly oaky and lightly acidic. It’s almost like a Berliner Weisse w/ raspberry syrup dropped in already. I'm generally not a sour beer fan at all but this brew is good. The vibrant and fruity flavor offsets the sourness very nicely."

"Amazing color, had a nice dirt and grassy flavor, plenty of funk, pleasantly dry without being overly sour. An experience"
""
""
"Unbelievable color of pinkish reddish beauty.  Thin pink head.  The smell is amazing.  Just amazing raspberry, oak, and funk.  Taste is perfect, with acidy raspberry jammy goodness.  Funk comes in waves between the sweetness of the raspberries.  A phenomenal beer."

"Pours out a vibrant red like agua de Jamaica.  Thin pink head.  Smells strongly of raspberries, funk, stomach acid, pale wheat.  Flavor is tart raspberry, pale and toasty malts, light wood.  Aftertaste is raspberry jam.  Finishes extremely dry and sour.  Mouthfeel is light and effervescent.  Acid strips the tongue.  This is excellent."

""
"O:  a top notch raspberry sour."

"O-Not super sour, but super balanced. One of the better raspberry sours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is ruby hued with a thin collar. Huge raspberry aroma. Funky character with a jammy raspberry quality. A simple and straightforward beer. Makes me want to revisit Lou Pepe Framboise - it's been too long. Delicious and teeming with flavor. So much fruit. Fabulous. My favorite Jester King thus far."

"O- Liked this beer so much that I picked up a bottle to bring back to Florida and even bought an Atrial Rubicite T-Shirt."
"If you're finding this too sour and not jammy enough, makes sure to pour in the dregs and let it warm above fridge temp. Things really improve at that point."

"If you like raspberries, and sour ales, look no further. The Atrial Rubicite is the most flavorful and delightfully sour farmhouse ale I've ever had, with a dominant raspberry profile. A truly unique creation that is a pleasure with every sip, with food or without."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice reddish beer, very dark. Almost no carbonation form, but this is a carbonated beer. Aroma is of funky yeasts, berries. Taste is really good, very sour but not overly sour. Very drinkable. Tastes like berries. The body is light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Extremely impressed with this beer. One of the best American fruited sours out there. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"Overall this is a little behind my sample of Framboos but truly well done. I can't see myself drinking this very often but it is a very nice occasional treat."

"Overall my favorites were B1 and B4."
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I would like to see a touch of sweetness in this beer to give it a better balance. I considered running out and grabbing a bottle of NG Rasberry Tart to mix a bit, but was too lazy. Would love to try that combo in the future."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost ruby red color with a 2 finger reddish head the disappears very quickly. On the nose you get slight oak with really strong acidic raspberries. The taste is awesome. Great pucker from the raspberries. Great oak notes. Just what I expected. It is definitely sour. Mouthfeel is refreshing and then a little dry. Overall a fantastic beer!! Love the tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent and better than blend 4, but not by much. Just a more complex sour beer, even though it has less of a raspberry jammy flavor."

"O- Jester King is really doing great things, and I can see why they are highly regarded. Probably put this around #6 or so roughly in the belgian & domestic raspberry sour/lambic categories."
""
""
"O- Jester King really knows what they are doing with fruited sours and Atrial did not disappoint. I love how they capture the fresh fruit presence and a beautiful color without making it taste artificial or too syrupy. Definitely recommend checking this out as it's one of the better American fruited sours out there right now."

"Excellently crafted.. seek this one out. Not a berry-bomb, but a pretty sour masterpiece with raspberries to compliment."
"This beer pours like raspberry juice. It is deep magenta, not light pink like some other fruited sours. The pillowy pink head is really neat when you pour it vigorously. The nose is so deeply jammy. I detect very little tartness on the nose and a hint of oak. It smells like straight jam. The taste didn't quite deliver on the nose. The sour level was perfect for me. It's nicely tart like an unripe raspberry. I just don't get the distinct jamminess that was on the nose. The mouthfeel is a little thin and I could use a tad more carbonation. This beer is so light and flavorful that it is an ease to drink alone with only a slight bit of sour stomach after a whole bottle. The raspberry delivers on the finish as this beer warms."

"Batch 3 shared by Ineedabeerhere (thanks Joe!). Pours a raspberry hue with a frothy pink head that dissipates into a cluster of bubbles around one side of the glass. Nose reveals tart raspberries and a faint medicinal quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose, but flavors are a bit more muted and there is also a salty character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with some astringency. A very good beer, but the fruit is too subdued and the salty quality is a bit too assertive."
""
""
""
"O: Batch 1 is rather unremarkable. Batch 2, on the other hand, is a significant improvement - although it lacks depth."

"O- The best American raspberry sour I've had for sure. Not overly sour, but it makes up for it in every other way. Gorgeous, I want some more of Atrial."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really awesome JK wild ale. It reminds me a bit of raspberry berlinner weisse beer like August Schells Fram Du Nord. This beer is definately a coolship beer and it was noticed in the feel of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good American raspberry sour. This is what I wish New Glarus Raspberry Tart was. I'd venture that Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus is very similar, and Lou Pepe Framboise kills this 10 times out of 10. But still, this is the best American attempt at a raspberry sour, certainly in the neighborhood of Framboise for a Cure."

"Verdict: A tremendous effort from Jester King and easily one of the most impressive American Wild Ales I've tried to date. It's fresh, vibrant, delicate and bright and very quaffable. The balance is great, not overly sour, not overly sweet, not overly fruit centric, everything is in it's proper place. This can easily rival any of the Belgian lambics that employ raspberry, a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the better Raspberry sours I've had. Not overly sweet but still with an apparent raspberry presence."
"Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty tasty. Definitely fruit-forward and sweetish, but with enough funk and sour (though not *quite* enough oak) to offset those qualities and provide some balance."
""
"Lives up to the hype as one of the best fruit wild ales I've had."
""
""
""
"Pour is clear deep blood red with a white head. Nose is big time fleshy cherry and cherry pit. Almost a cherry pie filling aroma. Cherry flesh up front, the bret and acidity take over and make a presence not seen in the nose. Good carb and a very dry finish on a meaty body. Drink now, acidity will probably take over in time."
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely my new favorite raspberry sour. Bow down Raspberry Tart and Rose de Gambrinus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - AR is a fun beer, a truly excellent take on a style that's difficult for American breweries to capture. It's sweet, tangy, yeasty, and sour. I cower at how much this beer costs, but I would never turn it down in the future."

"Dark pink/red in color with a smallish pink head after a pretty vigorous pour. The smell had be a bit worried at first because it is dominated by sweet, jammy raspberries, much like Rubaeus and Raspberry Tart. However, the taste is very sour, and the sourness combines really well with the fruit to create a fantastic beer. Not the most complex sour, but very enjoyable."

""
""
""
"A bit one dimensional. It's a raspberry tart beverage; it's hard to tell this is a beer. Glad I had a chance to try it but considering the price for the amount you get I won't be getting this one again."
""
"Pours an awesome bright red, with a beautiful one finger pink head. Smells like raspberry with a little funk and oak in there. Taste is raspberry forward, with some funk at the end. Nice carbonation and slightly thin mouthfeel. Really sour as well, easy to drink though. Very fruity with some other nice barrel flavors, as well."

"1900th review! Got in a trade with cyde. 500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 2, bottled in August 2013. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense pink head with poor retention, that reduces to a small ring of lacing. Minimal glass lacing and a fair amount streaming carbonation. Great color and clarity. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry skin, sour cherry, red grape, green apple, oak, clove, pepper, leather, red wine, vinegar, hay, straw, herbal, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big raspberry presence and great yeast/oak balance; with great strength. Taste of big tart raspberry, raspberry skin, green apple, sour cherry, pear, red grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, red wine, musty funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, green apple, red grape, pear, sour cherry, oak, clove, red wine, hay, straw, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of raspberry, oak, and yeast ester flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane raspberry sour ale! All around fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of raspberry, oak, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. An extremely delicious and well balanced offering."

"O: It's so hard being objective on some of these really hyped beers. I'm glad I tried this 9 months after bottling as I am sure some of the flavors simmered down just a bit. Did it live up to the hype? No. But that's not why I tried it. As a huge fan of raspberry beers I was very, very happy to try this one. It met my expectations as far as what I had hoped for: a really enjoyable raspberry wild ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really well put together beer, and by far the best thing I've had from Jester King to date. If you like raspberries, this is a must get. Looking forward to future batches as well as future JK coolship projects."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well I must say that the appearance of this beer is impeccable. It pours a bright cherry red which just glows in the glass. Nose is an absolute raspberry bomb. The fruit is fresh and there are even earthy notes of soil in the back. Some perceived tartness towards the finish of the smell. Taste is quite acidic up front creating a nice pucker. Some raspberry sweetness follows and balances well with the sourness. This beer is chick full of bold and big flavors. Mouthfeel is moderate with effervescent carbonation. This is a winner from Jester King!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"update - Blend four a very different beer - much more fruit forward by comparison"
""
""
""
""
"Bright tartness, clean and puckering lactic acidity, light raspberry taste. Palate scrubbing carbonation. Not a lot of depth or complexity unfortunately, but tart and fruity. Seems like any other raspberry wild ale out there. Not sure where all the hype stems from. Raspberry Ananke is far better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Very good raspberry wild ale worthy of the attention and hype it is receiving. I could easily drink a lot more of this. Will have to keep this one on my list in hopes of coming across another bottle or two."

"what more can you ask of a beer. this is quite possibly the best beer ive ever had, certainly the best in recent memory (since my mid august fou foune). drlovemd87 deserves a shout out for bringing this rarity over. lets start with the color, holy goodness, I have never seen a beer so radiantly ruby red in my life, the color of raspberries mashed in a mortar and pestle right after being picked, hints of pink highlight the reds, looks like fresh jam. bright and gorgeous. show me a prettier fruit beer, ive never seen one. small but sturdy white head, not stained pink in the least, impressive and sexy like whipped topping. now the smell. oh oh oh the smell. tart and mouthwatering like raspberry jam, acidic lacto bacterial fermentation notes too, but not overpowering, and no vinegar at all. its funky, but its summery too, and seemingly perfect for fall. the fruit is so fresh I can taste it, the quality shines through here. the taste is even better than the nose, everything I want and nothing I don't. perfect. I never give perfect scores, and I have to here, no place to improve in taste. the berries are forward but not at al sweet, the sour elements are all lined up, pucker and dry, but not burning or angry, just balanced, still supremely drinkable, not too much alcohol, just right. no gimmicks. carbonated like a champagne, it really pops off in my mouth. cant believe how alive and active this is, and how there is not a lick of residual sugar here, its dry and fruity as it finishes. the robustness of the berries and the balanced yet complex sour flavors are the takeaways for me, and that color of course. its like absolutely nothing else out there, and I would kill to have a steady stream of it. never thought I liked fruited beer, so if you are in that boat, this is a life changer. worth every bit of hype, trade value, and praise it has received and then some. it takes a lot to blow me away these days, and jester king has done just that. it is the standard by which all fruit beer, and maybe even all sour beer will no be measured. as close to perfect as they get. wow, just wow. stop at nothing to acquire this, contact me if you've got extras. my appetite is now insatiable"

"O: This is the best fruit sour beers that I have ever had. At the Funk and sour Fest, I probably got 8 samples of this amazing beer."
"O- This beer is incredible, absolutely mind blowing. Tons of fruit character- I am glad I drank my one bottle fresh as I can imagine it will fade over time. Drink it now. This is delicious."

"Pours dark red with a pink layer of bubbles on top. Looks cloudy. Good retention for a sour. Easy to swirl up more foam. Smells great. Very jammy. Lots of fruit. The berries come through strong and tasty. Not a lot of funk. Mild oak but it might just be overshadowed by the fruit. Taste is a step back from the aroma. The fruit is still the dominant note, but it's not as jammy as I expected from the aroma. Funk is mild again. More oak shows up. Quite dry. It's tasty but there's not much depth. Mouthfeel is light and drying. Good sour but the yeast/bacteria blend just isn't quite there yet for me."

"The random shit you learn thanks to beer: apparently rubicite is a material found in many MMOs that is bright red in appearance and is normally associated with HP regeneration. The more you know... Anyway, this stuff pours a somewhat hazy magenta topped by a finger or so of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises dank raspberries, mild barnyard funk, sour blue raspberry, and a twinge of green apple. The taste brings in more of the same, with the apple now more apple vinegar-like and the overall level of tartness greatly increased. It's bright, it's fruity, it's tart, it's kinda funky, and it works. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine sour raz drink, one whose greatness was only impugned by the fact that it followed other stellar sours in the same night. Still, it was thoroughly enjoyable."

"Appearance is one of deep dark maroon blood red body with amazing pink lace that leaves it's foamy bubbly fingers along the sides of my glass! Beautiful to say the least.The smell is like a raspberry tart with that funk I recognize from many other JK offerings. The taste is instant with raspberry and quickly tart on the tongue with lactic tinge. This beer is such a fine example of what I like in a fruited sour to this point in my life. I really look forward to more special releases from Jester King!"

"Overall: This is a great beer, especially for a first foray into the world of fruit. It is clearly dominated by way more raspberries than were needed but nothing exceeds like excess I like to say. Way to go Jeff and Michael. You hit the cover off the ball on your first attempt at a fruited sour. I really like the softer acidity as it wasn't sharp and therefore this is a beer you could drink many of. Unfortunately, there aren't many of these to be had. If you were lucky enough to get a few bottles, then guard these with your life as people who are in the know will steal them without reservation."

"I am an admitted Jester King fanboy and had been really looking forward to this beer. While i was hoping/expecting (perhaps misguidedly) for more of a sour beer, this is a beautifully executed beer, drinks like a legit fruited lambic. And it'll probably be good with some age on it."
""
"In all I do really enjoy this beer. I'm glad to see JK finally achieve the level of ""farmhouse"" that they are going for. It takes a while to hone this technique down. Looking for the other installments from them. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer will become famous, that I'm sure of. Certainly my favorite of Jester King's very interesting selection. I'm going to be drinking those bottles very slowly, it will be interesting first to see how the bottle differs from the Draught version, and second to see how the beer ages over time. I'm excited, will drink this only on special occasions, for sure."
""
"Been waiting for this one for a long time and have to say it was worth the wait. As with most Jester King beers at this point, you have to be onboard with their approach to like their beers, but if you've signed on to their old world farmhouse approach to brewing then this is likely to be a new favorite and is a standout in their lineup."
""
""
"I drink this beer, and I wonder, ""Was this really made in Texas?"". Texans are lucky to have Jester King around. Their hard work is reflected 100% by Atrial Rubicite."
"O- We've been waiting so long for JK to do a fruited sour and they delivered in spectacular fashion. Price point was a bit high, but it obviously didn't stop me from buying it. Definitely in my top 3 American Wild Ales."
"Overall one of my favorite raspberry sours. Has all the fresh fruit flavor you could want along with a big jam like essence. It's super dry and acidity is right smack where I like it. The house culture helps put this on a level few exist."
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is Jester King's maestro performance to date. Call me a homer, but I've traveled and consumed Rose de Gam at its source in Brussels and I think this beer is on par. In terms of TX beer, papa's got a brand new bag."
""
"O - Not bad, and a good entry into sours for JK. Definitely not the best Raspberry sour out there."
""
"This beautiful raspberry sour was a delight for my wife and I. We visited JK this past Sunday for the AR release and allocation pick up. Glad to try batch 2 on draft. The smell does not even come close to the taste of pure raspberries, fresh. The deep red raspberry color is just one more reason to love this beer. #Loveitman"
"Overall I think this is the best beer made in Texas yet. I'd strongly argue for it being included in any discussion about best beers in America. Jester King not only has created a great beer, they've created a masterpiece. I can't wait to drink more of this."
""
"Beautiful pink hue, slightly hazed, with a thin sheet of head. Sour raspberry jam, oak, and some JK barnyard yeast. Bright raspberry flavor, but solid balance between malts and funk as well. Slightly tannic with a solid finish, keeps me going back for more. Overl a fantastic fruited wild ale, and the best beer I've ever had from JK. The only thing I would prefer more would be a LP Framboise, but that's a different style of beer and not exactly a fair comparison. People might think this is a homer review, but I've never had a raspberry American wild as good as this one..."
"O. Without being blasphemous I would say very close with a lot of Belgian frambroises, the best American raspberry beer I have tried."
"Had Batch 2 on tap at Jester King for the bottle release. The color is near amazing, up there with a number of high caliber fruited sours that I have had along the way. Smell promises the fruitiness and tartness to come. Light, pink head, dissipates quickly. Jammy raspberry taste with tart dryness in the finish. It will be interesting to see how the flavor has developed in the bottles, which are 6 months older than this tap batch."
"The flavor is tart and dry, with vinous raspberry juices puckering the sides of the tongue. A hint of leather and wood from the barrels blends perfectly with the delicate raspberry note. Acidity is light, but enough to balance the funky yeast. Good carbonation, refreshingly tart and slick on the tongue with a medium body. Atrial Rubicite is very complex, and very well crafted. Probably Jester King's, nay, the entire state of Texas's finest beer to date."

"O: This is by far the best thing to come out of Jester King. They've taken their game to the next level with this offering. Don't miss it if you have the chance."

"PS: I'll be at Zwanze Day at Jester King this Saturday with one bottle from my allocation. If you have not tried this yet I'll share it with you. BM me. First come first served. Out of staters get first priority."
"Had this on tap at the Jester King release . It looks like blood. Amazing color. The nose is tart and acidic with a raspberry note. You know you are about to dive in to something fantastic. I have been hearing friend talk of this beer for the last couple months. I have always seem to miss out on it (pre release) Also with Jester King sours they can be hit or miss. This one is a GOD DAMN homerun! The sourness is there, the tartness is there and has that reeal raspberry taste. not artificial like some raspberry sours can be. The carbonation level was spot on and I wish I could have gotten more than 3 bottles for drinking them."
""
"This beer just wins over in sheer deliciousness."

"Overall I am very pleased, this is a non-blended, barrel aged, wild ale (did I mention raspberries?) that isn't over sour and is refreshing and simply delightful. I was very surprised by this one, I knew the style and the hype but having had several misses and not always being one to go by popular opinion, my expectations were not high, but this beer very much surpassed all I had hoped for."

"Pours a hazy dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, raspberry, and oak aromas. Taste is much the same with sour raspberry and oak flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice fresh sour raspberry presence."
""

"Price point was a bit high but I would spend the $16 on a bottle time and time again for the quality one gets from this. Can't wait to drink this again! My only regret is that I only have a couple of bottles of this fantastic brew left to last me a year."
"Overall amazing, one of the best raspberry beers I've ever had, very well done, I wish I had more of it."

"O: Jester King nailed this style. This is by far one of if not their best offering. I had this after Cantillon St. Lamnivus and Cantillon Oude Geuze and this blew those out of the water. The execution on this beer is just flawless, I haven't had a beer that incorporated raspberries this well. Cheers to Jester King and thanks to Jeff for sharing 2 bottles of this!"
