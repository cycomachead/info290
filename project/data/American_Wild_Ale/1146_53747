You can detect a hint of tartness from the wild yeast strains.  Has a sweet raspberry taste that is tart at the end.  You can taste the wine quality to it.  Can really discern any hoppiness to it.

The smell has a strong raspberry note and a bit of vanilla notes from the barrels. There also appears to be a very weak oak note as well. The smell also has bits of fruity sweetness to it. The beer taste is radically different from the smell. The taste has a very strong raspberry note with a hint of vanilla but barely. The taste also has a red grape flavor similar to a cabernet. The funk is in the form of a strong tart and sour flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but a bit light and watery with biting carbonation. Overall, a decent beer and a decent sour worth getting at least once.","HattedClassic","Jun 09, 2014"

4.23,2.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"O - Three years in, the sweetness appears to have been pretty thoroughly gobbled by the yeast. The result is a pungent, sour beer, but one with several layers working simultaneously. The wine elements are interesting, and the hints of fruit give a counterpoint to the acidic bight that makes the beer's core. A fine offering.","Tsar_Riga","May 19, 2014"

This has just the right amount of sourness and eloquent feel that it can easily substitute as a wine at a fine dinner party.

No glass lacing, and a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart raspberry, strawberry, sour cherry, red wine, oak, clove, hay, straw, grass, vinegar, musty funk, leather, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart raspberry, sour cherry, strawberry, red wine, vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, sour cherry, strawberry, red wine, oak, clove, vinegar, musty funk, leather, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and wine barrel flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a great fruited wild ale. All around good balance and complexity of raspberry, fruity/funky yeast, and wine barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

4.22,2.4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and a pretty good example of a American Wild Ale, it had a nice sour base to it that wasn't overly sour or acidic and the raspberry worked well with this beer and the all the flavors seem to come together nicely. This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth a little acidic, dry, not too filling and the taste did a very nice job at holding my attention, the acidic aspect would keep me from drinking the whole bottle, but I think half the bottle is pretty close to the prefect amount for me and I think this would make for a nice beer to enjoy in the summertime. What I like the most about this beer was how well the raspberry worked with the sour base, they complemented each other nicely. What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there is anything that I would change, it's great just the way it is. I would buy this beer again if I saw it, it's pretty pricey at $20, but I think it's worth it and it's a nice special occasion beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes American Wild Ales or sour beers in general. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I'm glad I decided to go half on a bottle with my friend, I wouldn't want to miss out on this one, and the more beers I have from this series the more I like it. Juliet is still my favorite but this one comes in a solid second. Great job guys, this was a really nice beer and I hope I can try the rest of the sisters, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Feb 02, 2014"

Clear enough to see a stream of carbonation bubbles rising at the center of the glass. Aroma is clean with a dusting of wackiness. Juicy tart raspberries, wild yeast, white doughy crackers, warm summer floral, and some soft musky wood. Taste is similar but includes increased tart funkiness. Really nice actually. Very fun to drink. Flavors are sweet and sour berries, tangy and tart, woody and earthy, floral, herbal, fermented fruit, white wine, and grape skins. Smooth, soft, fluid texture, with puckering/smacky tart dryness.","tastybeer","Jan 29, 2014"

Sweetish, tart raspberry slickness in the mouth. Dry wine-like fruit, dust, lemon, earth, and sharp woody notes. A bit phenolic in the finish which meshes with the spicy wood. The extremely dry, acidic smell is a little harsh, but the berries really come out in the flavor. Super dry and puckering mouthfeel, lightly carbonated. Very refreshing and surprisingly refreshing for its strength.","wedge","Jan 29, 2014"

It bears a beautiful dark rose color with thin lacing as well. WIthout a doubt my favorite of this series from Goose Island.","thezach","Nov 27, 2013"

Aroma packs a razzy punch, but a good amount of tart, sour funkiness is tucked in there and there also some woody and boozy notes as well. Taste is more of the same as a highly caarbonated, sharp beer that is light to medium bodied passes over my tongue with raspberry flavor as well as possible other ""wine"" fruits like grape and there's a boozy, oakiness to the beer as well. The barrel/woodiness helps keeps things balanced and smooth and I swear as the beer warms (or the ABV hits you, depending on how you look at it) there are some minor sweetnotes on the backend. A good sour ale that is worth trying and enjoyable the whole night.","clayrock81","Nov 21, 2013"

Quite drinkable for a sour, but it's nice to sit back and relax and just sip it. Priced right around the average for other sours as far as 750 mL bottles go at $18, so it's really not too bad of a deal either. Great if you like raspberries, too","BEERMILER12","Oct 29, 2013"

Aroma of tart notes of raspberries with light Brett notes with some vinous notes also perceptible. Taste is a good mix between tart raspberries notes with well balanced vinous notes with some subtle notes of Brett at the end. Body is about average with great carbonation which feels right for the style and no apparent alcohol. Very good level of drinkability with well balanced complexity. I would love to have a lower ABV version of this that could be drank in the summertime.","Phyl21ca","Mar 02, 2013"

Moreover, I believe the acidity that's present is more than enough to support just a tad more sweetness. At any rate, am hoping I can soon try other sour offerings from Goose Island like Juliet and Madame Rose.","deadonhisfeet","Sep 02, 2012"

Right off the tap, there was nothing in terms of head of even a flimsy foam, nothing, it's all good though. Smell is pretty integrated with raspberry scent over faint wine coming through when the warming takes place. It's pretty tame to tell you the truth. I don't get any funky scents coming up, just mainly fruit. Taste is pretty one sided towards the raspberry flavor which is nice and not artificial. The fruit just does not pop out for me as much as I would like. The wine is light to and the barrel flavor non existent. Some malt presence in the end with a slight tart hit that is not sour, don't go looking for a pucker bomb, Lolita is not the one for that. Body is less than medium with a trace of carb.

3.92,-4.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"650 ml bottle, 2011 vintage bottled on 11/12/11. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy reddish/amber color with about an inch light tan cola-like head that fizzled away pretty quickly. Not much lacing, either. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like sweet and tart raspberries, oak, lemon peel, and some red wine/grapes. It tastes like tart and sweet raspberries, oak, red wine, earth, and a bit of lemon. It's more tart tasting than sweet, but the tartness isn't close to being overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit thin and is well carbonated. It's also easy to drink. All in all, I think it's a good brew. But for $15.99 a bottle, I'm not sure if I'll end up buying another bottle to age or not.","bluejacket74","Apr 04, 2012"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberries, tart, cherry, tart cherries, wood, and acetic acid. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, fruit, vinegar, wood, earth, sour, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The fruit profile going on here was really nice with a nice sour and tart aspect carrying through. This made for a really nice brew that was quite easy to drink and very enjoyable.

Scent is immediately musty with a bit of gym socks, followed by tart raspberries. Lots of raspberries with a bit of red wine vinegar. Taste is immediately sweet raspberries. Takes a bit for the tartness to kick in. Some oak flavors with tart raspberries and red wine. A little bit of brett flavor with grapefruit. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and VERY fizzy. Tart, but not puckering. Drinkability is high, as it is a refreshing and tasty beer.

The flavors too begin with soft fresh raspberry sweetness before becoming very dry and tart. I get a good amount of Brett. It has nice flavor and no aspect is over the top. It drinks very light in body with a good amount of carbonation. Overall this is a nice, drinkable sour with intriguing flavors.

A nice sour flavor lingers on the tongue and in the back of the throat after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel, There is also a slightly acidic quality to this one.

Deep orangish red, and oddly enough some purple hughes as well. The nose is where this beer does its thing. Sharp, sour raspberry all the way, very lactic. Faint, faint white oak aroma. Sadly the flavor doesn't depart much from the nose. Not much complexity. Fruity, but lactickly sour raspberry, sharp and lemony. The sour really gets right into your nose. Some oak and vanilla hits the tongue. Thats it. Fair mouthfeel for a wild, not thin, I think the raspberry rounds that out. This beer is ok, I have one in the cellar for later and it is good enough for me to think about grabbing another to age a bit longer. All in all, more wood and more funk please.","pmlondrigan","Jul 05, 2011"

I noted a rating for ASTMO but only a few notes about the beer itself so I'll keep this short. Taste was tart, very raspberry/cherry, with a great, very carbonated mouthfeel that spread through the mouth excitedly. Taste wasn't extremely complex or dynamic, mostly just straight up raspberries/cherries with varying sensations of tartness or sweetness. It was reminiscent of Lost Abbey's Red Poppy to me in this sense though this was a little less layered I'd say. Good, glad I tried it, not sure it's worth seeking out though or worth the price.","Klym","Jul 04, 2011"

3.62,-12.1,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The first pour of Lolita yields a radiant, clear, cherry red beer. There's a little bit of pink tinged foam crowning the beer, but it fades quickly and without leaving a trace. The second pour would introduce some sediment and cloud the beer up. The nose is very raspberry centric, with a bit of acidity to it. It comes across as a less bold Weyerbacher Riserva. The flavor has a bit more nuance to it, as pure raspberry is smoothed out by some dark fruitiness from the wine barrels. In addition, there's a little bit of funk to take the vinegar edge off the noticeable tartness. I have to say, for a beer that specifically mentions brett but no other critters, it sure is still overpoweringly sour rather than funky. This one finished out just a little too dry for me, either that or it was too highly carbonated. Whatever the cause, that balance was thrown off and resulted in an overly spritzy mouthfeel, especially towards the end of the beer once it had warmed some. Were it not for a pretty great flavor Goose Island gets from the raspberries Lolita aged on, it'd be an entirely average attempt at a wild ale.","axeman9182","Apr 13, 2011"

It pours a clear garnet-amber topped by a minor bit of dirty white foam. The nose comprises light raspberry, cranberry, cobwebs, Brett, peaches, red apple, and sour cherry. The taste holds notes of tart orange, cobwebs, Brett, light caramel, light cream cheese, lime, and grapefruit zest. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish.
