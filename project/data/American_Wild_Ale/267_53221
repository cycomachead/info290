4.25,3.9,,,,,,"friek is a clever beer, a mix of cherries and raspberries added at differetn stages of the brewing and barrel aging process, it is complex and unique, delicious and drinkable, and a great expression of both fruits. thin reddish in color, purple and mahogany undertones, and just a mild off white patchy layer of bubbles on top. the nose is more cherry than raspberry, a touch medicinal perhaps, but the sourness in it brings it right back. the raspberry adds some tartness, while an unexplained lemon citrus component is also there. the flavor i think balanced both fruits well, but the raspberry seems like fresh berries while the cherries seems more of a candy thing, maybe to do with when they were added and how long residual yeasts have been working on them. not overly sour in taste, but there is definitely a lambic-esque mix of yeast and bacterial character, between lacto acidity and bretty funk, it fits the bill pretty well, although brett is not readily apparent here, some other yeasts may be acting similarly upon it. fruit is forward but its beer first, which i appreciate, but to me the body is too thin for all the flavor. carbonation could be ramped up a bit, and the watered down fruit syrup texture needs a lift. either more grain body or less leftover sugar, its a tricky balance in a beer like this, and its not quite reached. overall though this is amazing beer, maybe the best balance of the two fruits ive encountered.","StonedTrippin","Aug 20, 2014"

Compared to other sours that I've tried, this is much less ""funky"" and would be a good choice for someone interested in trying wild ales.

Minimal off white head that recedes to the sides and leaves no lacing on the sides. Aroma offers a little funkiness, the raspberries are stronger while its colder and cherries become a little stronger as it warms, the fruits give offsome sweetness and tartness, there's some vinegar hanging out, as well some funk and oak. Flavor pretty much follows suit. Pleasantly moderately sour. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall. great beer.

Perfect cherry flavors throughout. Didn't find raspberries much in here but when the sourness and cherry characteristics come together, almost everything else fades.

4.12,0.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"In this case you get Odell's GABF Gold Medal winning Friek. A tart and sour combination that plays on lambic styles mixed with wild yeast strains, aged in oak barrels, and completed with locally picked raspberries. Friek pours a ruby-red with flashes of orange, a thin ring of a white head comes and goes, leaving no lacing. The aroma of cherries leads to a tart nose, underlined by the raspberries. The mouthfeel of this brew seems a bit light, but is brightened by tongue prickling carbonation. A slight puckishness first greets the pallet from the tartness of cherries, but develops a wider range of flavors (including tartness, fruitiness, and sourness) that mingle well on the tongue with the sourness preceding the dry finish. An interesting interpretation on a classic style, and Odell's has a winner here.","phishsihq","Jan 01, 2012"

Big thanks to G311 for the share. The brew pours a rustic ruby hue and is capped with a filmy pink head; good looking stuff. The aroma is excellent; rasperry leads the way in the aromatic department with cherry hiding behind oak and vanilla notes, and also revealing itself through the fruity tartness, which hides the acidity well. The flavor is just as good as the nose, but is apportioned quite differently. In this case sour cherry is readily evident, paired with a musty oak funk - the raspberry shows up on the finish with a sort of clean sweetness. The feel is petillant, and just under medium-bodied. Overall, this is an extremely enjoyable beer, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.","ktrillionaire","Oct 06, 2011"

It is carbonated fine though so maybe my glass was dirty. Smells very woody like barrels and a hint of cherries and Brett. Taste is cherries, tart raspberry, very strong wood barrel flavor, not bad at all. This really doesn't taste like lambic to me but as an American Wild Ale it works. Only problem is the price tag, the quality if this beer does not justify $16 and I would never buy it again.","ArrogantB","Oct 04, 2011"

I definitely feel like I should be able to say more about this beer than I am able; it is certainly a bit more simplistic than it should be.

Really nicely done.","Thorpe429","Jun 09, 2011"
4.2,2.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Dry, acidic, light to medium bodied, with average carbonation. Not as tart or acidic as most sours, but still very nice. A very nice effort by Odell, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.","hardy008","Jun 08, 2011"

4.35,6.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy ruby color with a trace of white bubbly head. The aroma has notes of raspberry, cherry and vinegar. The flavor is like a Warhead candy... if you don't know what that means... is has a very sour taste to start with a fruity flavor afterward... In this case, raspberry and cherry. The mouthfeel is nice and clean... maybe could use a little more carb. This beer is definitely worth a try.","csiewert","Jun 02, 2011"
4.07,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - This is pretty good. Not sure where the various Ds are coming from, as even without carbonation I can imagine this would still be pretty enjoyable. Extremely easy to drink - I could have tackled the 750ml on my own quite easily.","MasterSki","May 30, 2011"

4.01,-2,3.5,5,3.5,4,4,"Appearance is a mury and cloudy reddish brown, almost copper colored (think like an old penny, not like a new penny). Head dissipates pretty quickly, leaving a small amount of bubbles that circle the glass. Tart cherry aroma explodes throughout the aroma, with familiar and yet complex hints of oak and sour funk. Aroma is definitly a highlight of the beer. First taste is sour fruit, as the sour raspberries and cherries really stand out. As your palate adjusts you can start to pick out the fruit notes, which really work well. Oak finishes. This beer could use a little bit more complexity in the finish, as it goes straight from sour fruit to the light oak finish. Sourness is abrupt at the beginning but fades as you continue to drink it. Mouthfeel is very full bodied and the carbonation is relatively light. This means the beer kind of melts off your tongue as you drink it. Not sure if there's such a thing as an easy drinking sour, but if there is, this beer would likely be it.","eclaycamp","May 15, 2011"

4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"And now the true Dark Lord Day festivities can begin in earnest: the random group tastings. This product thereof pours a murky amber grapefruit juice (red, o' course) topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises cobwebs, oak, caramel, and black cherry. The taste holds notes of sour cherry, ruby red grapefruit, light cobweb, oak, and dank raspberries. The body is a stoic medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and an oily feel. Overall, a solid bit o' lambic, something very akin to New Glarus Enigma in taste, though the occasional pricks of tartness and cobwebs, without some sort of consistency (if that makes any sense to anyone but me, I'll be surprised), keep this from making it up to that lofty point (I really enjoyed the Enigma). Still, a tasty specimen indeed.","TMoney2591","May 01, 2011"

4.27,4.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a blackberry purple with a decent 2-inch bubbly head that quickly dissipates into nothing. No ring, no lacing but not abnormal for sours. The aroma has a lactic twang up front melting into tart berries. Both the cherry and the raspberry come through in the nose, along with a bit of oak, vinegar and just a hint of must. The flavor falls off a bit. While the fruits are still there, the tartness isn’t as sharp as it is in the aroma. The vinegar is a bit more vocal with the must and oak almost non-existent. As it warms up the raspberry comes through a bit more and lends just a touch of sweetness at the tail end of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is great. Crisply carbonated, leaving a prickly sensation on the palate. Finishes extremely dry making the tongue almost feel stuck to the roof of my mouth. Overall I thing there is some room for improvement but it gives me hope that Odell’s could become of the better and more consistent sour producers in the US.","hwwty4","Apr 17, 2011"
4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel glass a murky, deep ruby color with a white head that quickly settles to form a tiny collar. Tart cherry in the nose right off the bat followed by a slight funkiness. Light/medium mouthfeel with carbonation. Very sweet upfront with both cherry and the raspberry fruit flavors but then transtions to a sour/tart funkiness, not overly funky but there. I find myself rather surprised how well I like this beer. I would for sure drink this again and am glad I have a second bottle to cellar.","kbutler1","Apr 15, 2011"
