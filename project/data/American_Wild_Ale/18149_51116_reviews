"Hey everyone... Here's a beer at the top of the list on BeerAdvocate.  Let's travel to the ends of the earth to get a taste, then race to the site to pine over how amazing this is.  Is this a bad beer?  Of course not.  Is this god's gift to beer?  Get real.  Do yourself a favor, head to your local distributor, and get your favorite middle range beer.  You'll be exactly the same off."

"Funky goodness, and the bottle version is certainly funkier than on tap. Eh, maybe too funky for me but this is a very unique and complex beer."
""
""
""
"This is a great beer!"
""
"Wild is an understatement...this is a safari in a bottle...HYPE Doesn't do it justice..."
""
"Overall - The strength of this beer is in its balance and its ability to change from tart lambic to estery Belgian to dry saison with a simple swirl of the glass.  Not showy or flashy, just simply well made."

""
""
"One dimensional, and just a little boring.  After several try's over the years, I was hoping this would click, but it never has.  I have never gotten much yeast or substantial tartness out of this.  Don't know why my experience is that much different than most others. Though I think  there are much better Wild Ale available, and ones that are so much easier to get as well."

"this was absolutely unreal.  Best balance and mouthfeel i've ever had."

"T: A juicy push of tart Granny Smith apple, lemon and underripe pear upfront followed by a smooth middle of oak and lemon meringue. Finish leaves a lingering lemon flesh sourness. Has just a touch of white wine barrel to it, cherry skin and just a breath of funk on the finish. Doesn't carry the funk of something like 3F Oude Gueuze and doesn't have the sourness of a beer like Cable Car, but it's fantastically rounded and just keeps pummeling you with a variety of flavors, none of them bad. An absolutely phenomenal beer. So glad I finally got to try this."

"O- a very delicious brew. Perfectly balanced between sour and sweet. So glad i got to try this."

"Absolutely perfect gueze. Had next to V010 and V013 and it was memorable. No fruit but just amazing, intense sour, moderate funk, not over carbed. A pleasure to savor slowly."
""
""
"I am not a big fan of this type of brew having said that this is a true gem and my 5.0 rating say's it all!!!"
"Reviewed from notes.  Pour is a yellowish orange with white head that retains nicely.  Nose starts with acid and funk.  Heavy notes of lemon zest, green apple, and funky notes of hay and farm.  The taste is moderately tart with a nice layer of funky complexity. Notes of oak come in and play  nicely with the funk qualities.  Reminds me of an authentic Belgian gueuze.  Mouthfeel is effervescent and light.  Overall, a very tasty American take on a gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This must be a beer that gets better as it develops in the bottle. As of how 2013 DDG is drinking, I just don't understand all the fanfare surrounding this Lost Abbey sour.  Not much complexity and it doesn't really impress me all that much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Really well balanced, absolutely delicious gueuze-style beer here. The wine barrels come out nice and strong but do not dominate. Well integrated flavors with a nice slightly dry mouthfeel. A wonderful beer here. (4.9)"
""
""
""
"Overall -  Fantastic beer from Lost Abbey and I am so glad I was able to track this one down. Well worth the wait and definitely one of my long time wants."

"On the whole, what truly impressed me about DDG was its ability to present a bevy of delicious flavor profiles that managed to be at once distinct unto themselves as well as graceful partners to the other notes present in the beer. A fantastic beer, and one that I'm incredibly grateful to have gotten to try."

"2013 bottle"
""
"2013 bottle. Pours a hazy orange, smallish head that goes away fast. Smell is sour, wine barrels apparent. Taste is pretty sour, very reasonable, though. Lemon tartness, wine. Gently carbonation is easy to drink, just great. Really has a great burst of lemon. I like this a lot. Easy to drink and great level of sour."

"O- My absolute favorite wild to date. Very sour, but it balances out perfectly with the other flavors. There is a lot of depth in this ale and is if fun to sip and play with the flavors. Glad I got the chance to try this one and it definitely lives up to the hype. Awesome job by Tomme and the crew at Lost Abbey."
""
""
"you want a good, no great, beer? go get yourself a Weyerbacher Riserva, now that's a great, sour, barrel aged beer. bottom line, this was fucking terrible.'good thing I only wasted $7 on it. never understand how these kinds of beers get ratings around here."
""
""
"Overall: An excellent American wild ale. You'll never mistake this for a gueuze, as the name might lead you to believe, but this is still a excellent beer worth seeking out."

"This beer has an orange/yellow pour with a medium white head. It is a fruity beer with a slight acidity to it. Aromas of this beer include lemon and citrus. Flavors of lemons and citrus come through when tasting. Sour aftertaste with a light body. Not my favorite!"
""
""
""
""
"Hazy lemon yellow in color with a frothy white head and spotty lacing. The nose features light lactic funk, hay, tart lemon, barnyard, and a light grassy note. Graceful, layered flavor of sour citrus, lemon meringue, slight orange and melon, with a tart finish that doesn’t overpower the well-balanced taste. Effervescent and slightly prickly palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is probably one of the most complex American wild ales that I'll ever have the chance to try. It does seem to fade in the nose and flavour as it warms up, but I still enjoyed this a lot. I believe people when they say this and Beatification are better than Cable Car, and I'm very happy to have the opportunity to try a good one-third of a 750ml bottle of this to dissect and enjoy. Its certainly not an Armand'4 geuze, but as far as American wilds go, this is excellent."

"Have had this several times now, and I'm able to appreciate it more than I first did when I sampled it with some friends in DC years ago, but this still is just too much sour for my palate to handle. That being said, this is always a fun and interesting beer to sample, and it's amazing the amount of flavor it delivers."

"Given the hype surrounding this beer, I was expecting it to be a bit more unique and complex. Nevertheless, this is a very tasty and well crafted American wild ale that I am grateful to have had the opportunity to sample. Big thanks again to my friend Sean for sharing this."

"OVERALL: This was a lot of fun. Putting the '13 and the '09 beside each other really showed the superiority of the older vintage. The newer '13 is still too young, as it's a bit harsh with too much acidity in the way of the flavors. The '09, however, has matured nicely and reminds me of some aged gueuze here in Belgium. A soft, integrated and refined sour that was very much enjoyed all around. Not to offend the newer bottling, but most people at the tasting agreed the older vintage was superior; I certainly would have scored it a 4+. Thanks again for bringing this pair along. Lots of fun man!"

"2013 vintage. a beer thats been high on my list (and everyone elses) for what seems like forever. hazy pale yellow in color it definitely looks the part under a fizzy pure white head that dies down right away. the nose on this is just incredible. its so so sour. citric lemon acidity at first, followed by a relaxed bacterial farmhouse saison mustiness and a mellowing oak aspect. white wheat malt is not sufficient to balance the sour, and its not really supposed to be. tartness all the way in the smell and my eyes almost water from the intensity of it all. the taste starts out just like the nose with more of a lemon than a bacterial vibe, but the drying sourness comes in hot, and aided by the carbonation, almost hurts the palate, certainly the jawline. the oak is big here, and it needs to be. it gives more depth and body than the malt does seemingly. my one critique of this is in the feel. while it has awesome carbonation, it does have some residual sugar that keeps this drinking a little heavier, and far less dry and clean than the classic gueuzes of belgium. maybe this is to do with the blending, maybe it needs more time, im not sure, but the finish in terms of feel is off. more vinegary sourness than lactic, i like it a lot, and i am stoked to have finally tried it, but im not sure i would put it in the top 25 beers in the world as others have."

"Flavor is where this brew takes the cake, especially as it warms. Starts off with amazing green apple tartness and sweetness (but mostly welcoming tartness). Huge yet not overwhelming puckering tartness starts things off along with dryness and woody funk notes. The brew is pretty musty and dry with a perfect balance between the tartness and the funk. Amazing tasting sourness that isn’t overwhelming with a great crisp, clean and fluffy body. Overall, this is one of the better sours I’ve had out there. It is clean and not too overwhelming but has some amazing fruit tartness balanced by some nice fruit sweetness."

"A near perfect beer, but splitting hairs (i.e. how's hotter, Megan Fox or Kate Upton). Had it via taster and bottle, although I feel the bottle was better than what was poured from the tap. This is probably the best Wild Ale (or technically 'a geueze but really not a geuze' bc not in Belgium). Yes, there's a lot of hype with DDG, but well deserved. Would I pimp slap an angry football player for seconds? Yes, I would. Now the review: carbonation is perfect and a very clean mouthfeel. Tasty as hell with a long and the right amount of sour finish. Very well composed and should improve with age, which is scary to think of its potential."

"Slightly hazy, golden yellow color, with a bubbly white head that sank to a ringlet, leaving some spots of lacing on the glass; Champagne-like carbonation bubbling from the glass bottom. A lot going on in the nose, mainly funkadelics, earthy, bretty, aromas of horseblanket, lemon zest and apple peel, leaving no doubt that this will have some sourness to it. Very acidic on the palate, almost too much actually, nearly wrecking. After adjusting for a moment or two, out come flavors of acidic citrus and sour stone fruits, lemon drops, lesser notes of earthy funk, horseblanket, distant crackery malts. Dry and crisp mouthfeel, medium body, and--if you conquer that initial blast of palate-wrecking acidity--a pretty easy drinker for the style. Pretty good overall, but not worth trading an arm and a leg for."
""
""
""
""
""
"A refreshing, compelling ale, but not as well-rounded as the first release, and not as good as the hype or the price would lead you to think. There are plenty of other sour brews with more depth and complexity. This probably could use a year or two in the cellar as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Worth the hype and definitely one of my favorite of the night. Whenever a personal whale is slain AND you get to keep your money is a wonderful day."

"Overall. This is world class. Period. The balance present in this is what makes it so phenomenal. Im a fan of bold flavors, balance, and drinkability in any beer style. This is the epitome of those three descriptors summed up in the American Wild Ale style. This is ready to drink now. NOW! More sourness may appeal to some, but not me. The bottle is almost done. All by myself in less than an hr and a half. I'm in love..."

"O: Admittedly I am lost abbey fanboy, However, I don't hesitate to criticize them when they fuck up. They do fuck up a lot, but when Tomme gets his shit together, they are 100% fucking all time...this beer would be an example of being 100% fucking all time. Like an otter pop blended with lemon juice filtered through sweaty gym socks. And yeah, that was intended to be a compliment."

"O/D-A huge treat to be able to try this beer. I was not blown away but it is clearly a great Wild Ale. This one is a bit over hyped. Still, not much else to complain about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was skeptical on how great this Wild Ale offering could be, even with all the hype, but I am pleasantly surprised. While I was intent on writing off this acquisition as foolish (internet purchasing debacle, road trip to San Diego, etc), I am content in saying it was worth it. It's definitely one of the more stronger wild ales I've enjoyed yet. I can't wait to age this a bit and hopefully mute out some of the acidity that is present. Go little bottle yeast ducklings, go!"

"O: I love this beer, but I'm hesitant on opening a bottle now. When I do I'll be revisiting this review."
""
""
"D: this is exceptionally drinkable despite the incredible acidity and if you can't handle it, work your jaws up with some Petrus and take your complaints elsewhere. The price and availability of this is a complete testicle and wallet defacement that makes me longing for more. Some will take calm refuge and say that 3F Oude Gueuze is better, denial is a hella of a panacea. This is an almost perfect AWA in every way, it is not a gueuze, but it goes beyond even traditional Goozies in sheer excess and panache like an acidic ZR1 that pushes you down in your seat with sheet acidic stiff arming. Fucking phenomenal, every bit as good as B1 that will continue to improve despite the 1.0001 FG. Mark my words."

"O: This beer is an exercise in balance and a great example of the style. The mouthfeel plays well with the flavor that plays well with the crisp finish. It was a great beer to have when standing around with a few hundred other whale hunters in a 90 degree plus warehouse sweating. As far as other sour beers out there this one is mild. Is this beer worth the Whale status? No. But is a really good beer none the less. Recommended."

"O - This is a solid American wild ale that goes up there with some of the Belgians I've had. It definitely was one of the most sour beers I've had as it was rather tart with just enough funk and complexity to keep it grounded and interesting"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was warned this beer had fallen off a bit. I can assure you it was the shocker of the night. For the people that have had it already, it was unanimous that this was the best bottle of DDG they have ever had. For me the amazing balance of sour/funk/lemon zest was amazing. Ain't over the hill yet son."

This bottle tasted like it was about 2 years old. If you have stored your correctly I think you have another 2-3 years before it goes bad. I wish I would have had this news prior to me opening my only bottle; but I am very glad to have had this delicious brew."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste follows suit on the tartness. hint of lemon rhind mixed with sour berries. This was surprisingly dry on the palate. Smooth from sip to finish. Overall this is an amazing geuze"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle shared by hoppypocket. Glowing orange-yellow with a small ring of foam. Aroma is oaky, tropical fruits such as oranges and pinneaples. Honey and cheese adds a welcomed layered of complexty. Taste has lots of acetic acid, citrus and musty bread. Medium carbonation and deliciously dry. A very good hybrid between a gueuze and a saison."
"ight, murky amber pour with a small white head. Aroma is heavily oaked with lemons and funk. Flavor is lemons, oak, orange citrus, a touch of nail polish remover. Finishes very clean for the style, minimal funk. Minimal carbonation kind of brings this one down a tad."
""
"O: Lives up to its reputation. Great fruit flavor with the level of sourness/acidity that I love in this style. Thanks again Jay!"
"O: Amazing beer, worthy of its praise. Reminded me a lot of Beatification."
"Cheers!"
""
"Medium to light in body with a semi drying tart finish. The finish leaves you begging for more! Overall, this beer was everybit worth the hype. So pumped I got to have it!"
"750mL b1. Pours a cloudy bright yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is sweat, balsamic vinegar, horse blanket. Taste is white sushi vinegar, salt water, funk, some light citrus. Fairly disappointed with this- and compared to Temptation or Beatification....it’s very average. 2/6/2010 8/4/7/4/15=3.8"
""
""
"Reminds me of Cable Car, though I prefer the blend of flavors here. An excellent American sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall fan-freakin-tastic! Amazing gueuze, with great blend of sour fruit juice, tart almost fresh fruit flavors, some funk, and plenty of acidity and a light typical bready malt finish. Nice and dry, and all in all fairly drinkable surprisingly. Really wish I could have gotten more of this to at least have another one in the cellar. The only real issue is lack of carbonation, and a few year old beer, and being a Lost Abbey beer in the time of Tomme Arthur carbonation issues (if you want to call it that), still pretty good."
""
"Overall: I thought this was a very good American Wild, but I was expecting a gueuze (I know it's listed as a wild, but the name made me thin gueuze). I still liked it and would have more."
"O - Just a fantastic beer. Glad we got to readd this one. Clean despite being funky. Boom."
""
"Golden honey blonde with swirls of haze from the yeast. Nice bubbly top. Beautiful blend of lemon zest, herbs, tannic wood, and must, with lots of citric and lactic sourness radiating all over the place. Very light sweetness throughout. Light in body with an effervescent carbonation that is neither too strong nor too weak. Quite a delicious beer indeed."
""
"Verdict: This is definitely one of the best beers on the planet and deservedly has a reputation as being one. I really can't think of anything to change about this beer and my wishing for more head might be out of line. My hats off to Tomme for this, a true gem."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was an amazing wild ale; one of the best at the tasing for me, and one of the best I've ever had. The nose is perfect and just a ton of sourness and funk. Well worth the hype and really hoping the rumors are true that they are making this one again. I preferred it to both Synergy and Yellow Bus, though Izzy slightly edged this one out for me."

""

""

""
"O - I really enjoyed this one. It had a ton of flavor but it was much easier to drink than some of the other wild's I have had. I would have loved to have tried this one fresh when it came out."
"O - As far as most American Wilds go this is far and away something well made. However, when pitted against the cream of the crop it (at least at this stage in its aging) falls very short of pure greatness. I really dug the clean sourness - unlike the harsh over-bacterialized sours so many breweries are rushing through production anymore."
""
"Overall, really great beer, probably the most sour beer I've had besides Hanssens . Not much funk, but it's great with the fresh peach flavor and honey. The taste is really delicious, the sour is balanced with sweetness, and complex with wood and depth of flavor."

"Drink- Well the journey is complete. I have my white wale and I finally got to give my little girl the bottle. For those of you who know the story, you know how much this means to me. The moment, the beer, the people it was perfect. Thank you again Chris. I owe you big time."

"Pours a clear golden yellow with an off-white head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is extremely sour and funky with lemon-like fruits and some earthy aromas. Taste is of extremely sour lemons and funky earthy flavors. A very acidic quality in the mouth with each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation level with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is an extremely awesome wild ale with some amazing smells and flavors. I feel very lucky to have tried this one."
"O: I'll be honest, I had really high hopes for this and it was a bit of a letdown. Definitely worth seeking out, but I'm not too crazy about it. I would like to give it another try, but there are plenty of other gueuzes out there that are readily more available and taste better. I think the big thing for me is that this is more mellow that a lot of other ones in this style. Maybe it needs a bit more age, but only time will tell."

"O- Very impressed with this beer, this has been on my top wants for some time, love the acidity, and the fruity notes that come out, would love to have another opportunity to drink this beer."

"I have had this 5 or so times now, and have loved it every time. Not the most complex stuff, no real depth of funk, but, again, the fresh fruit character they manage to evoke in beers like this, Isabelle, and Cable Car is always impressive."

"Overall an amazing beer, definitely the best American Wild ale I've ever had. Still has plenty of body and I honestly don't even think it's peeked yet."

"Pours a hazy gold with a thin white head that settles to a slight ring and swirls of haze. Phenomenal aromas of funk, lemon juice, oak, green Granny Smith apples, and wet hay. Very acidic and sharp, but in the best possible way. Reminds me quite a bit of Cable Car. Taste follow the nose nicely, very acidic flavors of lemon juice, green apple, and tropical fruit with a bit of oak and a whole lot of funk. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with a fairly light body and good, sharp carbonation. Just the right amount of dry sourness here, it doesn't strip the enamel off your teeth. Overall an amazing, unforgettable beer, so stoked to have gotten to try this. Cheers, Shane!"

"Pours a transparent golden color, bubbles floating to the top, thin limited white head. The nose has a fair bit of sourness and acidity, light leathery brett, an earthy funk, touch of tangerine and tangy peach. The earthy funk is there with some barrel presence, hints of vanilla, the peach is sour, extremely high acidity and burns the throat. The feel is full bodied and heavy, grainy on the throat, dry, under carbonated."

"Overall: I am extremely glad that I finally got to try this whale of a beer. Thank you again Jacob for the bottle share"
"O-wow. Redonkulous!"
"Overall: I really enjoy sours that really burn my nose and rip my taste buds out. This satisfies that criteria."
"Overall, finally a beer I don't feel stupid for taking time to track down. This beer is amazing and I would drink it frequently if it wasn't so damn rare."
"O: Delicious. I'm surprised at how funky this has become. I didn't really expect that. Great flavor profiles. I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to try this again, but I can cross my fingers and hope."
"O: A very good wild ale with a good degree of tartness, but not enough that it becomes undrinkable. Best way I can describe it is as a very ""clean-tasting"" sour."
"Thanks again Bryan!"
"Overall: Balanced across the board, complex, and just fucking good. I can understand why this is such a highly sought after sour. Thanks again Brent!"
"Overall: Simply amazing. Definitely in my top 3 favorite beers."
"750ml. Shared this with some FLA buds. Poured a nicely carbed, sunshine gold color with a thick creamy head. Straw and citrus nose with grapefruit, lemon zest and a touch of woodiness. Great sour taste with hints of apple and barnyard funk. Finished dry and lightly acidic. Another nice beer from Dr Tomme."
"The nose some citrusy notes-- mainly lemon. A slight oak character comes through. The flavor is tasty-- clean, sour, and overall a fantastic beer."
"This beer is a very pale, hazy straw yellow with a very slight ring of egg shell foam. The beer smells wild and bretty with a little fresh lemon. The beer starts out pleasantly sour and tart with good lemon and green apple flavors, but the finish is pure viengar. The viscous, mouth-coating, saliva-stripping, mouth pucker acidity. It is a combination of astrigent (like biting into underripe apples) and vinegar was very unappealing. This beer is wildly drying for a liquid. This is an okay beer, not the worst sour I've ever had, but it does not live up to the hype at all. I'm glad to have gotten to try it, but it's nothing I would actively seek out again."
"O- A wonderful beer, which I've been ISO for what seems like forever. Perfect tart, lemon characteristics with a level of funkiness that leaves me craving another glass."
"Pours similar to carbonated apple juice, with not quite the clarity and a nice cap of white head. The nose is lightly sour with lemon rind and cider vinegar. The taste is sweeter than expected - a lemon apple acidity presents in a somewhat reserved way. This beer is shockingly drinkable and not particularly sour (more funky than sour). One of my preferred wilds. The mouthfeel is nice with good, strong carbonation and a heavier than expected body. Overall, this is one of my favorite wilds that I have had from the nebulous AWA style."
"D. Very drinkable. The front is more tart while the tail is funkier."
"Pours a beautiful hazy yellowed orange with a nice touch of white head. Got the dregs sort of of the bottle. Smells tart and sour. Very nicely funky. It's very sour but also very funky. Not like any beer ive ever had. The mouthfeel is nice and well carbonated. The sourness is pretty harsh but enjoyable. Definitely a very solid beer somewhere between a gueuze and a wild"
"HUGE Thanks to Chad for sharing this beer with me! This has been on my WANTS for a long time. Pours a murky, golden-orange color with a small, white head that disappears quickly. Scent is oh so funky with some sweet fruit notes...peaches. Sour vinegar and lemon come at me as well. Taste is just as I was hoping. Tart fruit (peaches, green apple, lemon) with some vinous characteristics. Tons of sour and funky flavors with a nice oak backbone. Absolutely delicious! Mouthfeel is a puckering, well-carbonated, crisp masterpiece. Drinkability is very high, especially for this Fresno summer heat. Amazing beer... I would definitely need to do a side by side with Cable Car to see which one I enjoy more."
"-GFunk"
"Overall – A wonderful beer. Very glad I was able to try this now and have one to open later. Rip on LA or TA as much as you want, but he can make some damn good sours. Simply put, one of the best beers I’ve had. The first beer of the night and the best in my opinion. Fantastic."
"Foggy straw-colored pour with minimal white head. Nose is vinegary and acetic, but with a very noticeable maltiness, backed up by some wonderful cheesy funk. Flavor is quite nicely consistent with the nose. Like the nose, there is a light bready sweetness that I was not expecting. Adequate carbonation pulls everything off the palate for a great finish. Wonderful brew, but not quite ’top 5’ sour material. Certainly try it if you can."
"Bottle cracked open at Hunahpu’s. A hazy shade of orange with a small white head. Sour fruits and woody nose. All kinds of things going on in here funk, lemon zest, tart citrus, and horse blanket flavors. It’s fantastic, I just can’t decide if I like it better than CC or not."
"Poured a hazy yellow color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy sour, yeast and wood aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy sour flavor with a medium to heavy sweet & sour finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer for style."
"Duck duck gooze – holy shit, DDG…here we are. Beatufiul murky pale color, yellow…it is a thick yellow, beautiful, leaves sparse lacing. Aw, sweet tart all day on the odor, beautiful. OH WOW…SUPER tart sour, but sweet enough that it is tolerable and delicious…I understand the repuatation. Smooth as the day is long. Really really impressive, overall it is mouth puckerijngly sour while still being delicious and phenomenal. This is a great sour, sweet tarts with sourness with goodness, it is good. DDG, very unexpected to run into this at the release, but glad I did as it exceeded my expectations."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! A LONG time want of mine and was really glad to see it come out during this tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, BIG sour, BIG funk, tart, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, BIG sour, BIG tart, funk, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall, HOLY DUCK-FACE BATMAN!!! This thing was drop-kick your momma sour! Just the way I like it.... The fruit character in this one tries despirately to subdue the sour/tart aspect going on here, but it never stood a chance. Funk too? Hell yeah... This brew really lived up to my expectations and might have actually exceeded them slightly. Definitely a well done brew that I would love to have more of. Well done Lost Abbey."
"Serving type: bottle"
"750ml bottle thanks to one of you. I came into this expecting a gueuze and I will review it as such. Bright orange color with almost no head at all but it is carbonated. Smells sour and a bit cheesy but i would not say funky at all. In fact this does not smell like a true gueuze at all. The taste was way too sweet and then followed by a sourness. The sweetness was almost like a pixie stick or sweet tart and I didn't like that aspect at all.There was some citrus and fruit but to call this a gueuze is just not being honest. As a wild ale this was ok but the price was completely out of line for the beer that is in the bottle. Save your money and get a Cantillon for half the price."
"Really amazing beer...without doubt, one of the best, most drinkable and complex sours I’ve tried (and I’ve had my share). Cloudy honey pour with an amazing amount of carbonation for the style producing a 1/4 inch ivory head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma of peaches, balsamic, citrus rind, and grapes. Flavor doesn’t show the typical ""barnyard"" qualities...instead combining tart, sweet, and fruitiness. Green apple Jolly Ranchers, lemongrass, apricot, and grapefruit...balanced and incredible."
"(D)- Just an absolute beer. I would have a hard time placing it in a category though. Not a true AWA. Just a wonderfully easy drinking; balanced and dynamic beer. Lost Abbey has been hit or miss for me, but I really think this is hands down their best offering. I'm going to have to get more - one of my favorite beers. Bravo Tomme.. Bravo"
"O - A very nice brew, I am glad I had it. I would not consider it as good as IP, Deviation, FF or Bottleworks X, to name-drop a few I've had recently, but it is quite nice."
"A must try for anyone who likes their sours though. But Cantillon Classic Gueze is like $16? And this is $50? Can't say it comes anywhere near being worth it based on that comparison, but should have it at least once in a blue moon (i.e. when you see it)."
"O - Really tart. Pretty much perfect in the taste and smell sector. We had a lot great sours at this tasting and this was my top pick for winner. I really, really need to get a bottle for myself."
"Well that was nice."
"D - A really enjoyable and well-crafted wild ale, but not quite as strong as Isabelle or Cable Car '09. Still - highly recommended and well worth seeking out. I understand that Isabelle would be logistically impossible to recreate, and that Cable Car is solely for Toronado, but there's no good reason why Tomme shouldn't be blending up more of this every year."
"Well, it was wonderful to finally be able to sample this iconic beer from The Lost Abbey. I tried going into this blinded but after reading some of the other reviews, my experience seemed to differ - smarties candy? No way. Not enough sweetness or fruitiness, which I expected a lot of. This beer is definitely one to try, worth a World Class rating? Ehhh..."
"O - One of my favorite American Wilds. Really can't get enough of this, and it is quite easy to drink. Alcohol is not detectable, even at a robust 7% for the style. Highly recommended, and I want more."
"D- I will without a doubt, be seeking out another bottle."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate to high level of carbonation. Very easy drinking and enjoyable with it's tangy acidity and drying quality on the tongue. The alcohol is well integrated into this brew, it just works. Each sip has a big salivation factor to it which urged me to drink more almost carelessly without thinking about the characteristics it was offering. The only thing I can fault this beer for is it's lack of availability. I wish I could drink this on a regular basis."
"D - The hanging citrus & vinegar is going to fade my palate quickly as my throat is already filled with super tart lemony vinegar."
"Really enjoyed this one. Pours a nice golden color, quite clear and bubbly. Quality head. Super citrusy sour with a nice funk and malt presence. Strong work Arthur, right up there with 3F and Cantillon.... Could enjoy this beer anytime. Near perfect."
" The flavors are citrusy with orange and lemonade puckering taste yet there is a light dry taste w/ mild wood and gentle lactic accents. The taste of the wood gives a dry flavor with light lemony acidity following and subtle oak w/ hints of white grape combine to give a mild astringent edge to the smooth malt and fruit from the yeast- the green grape and hints of bitter citrus blend with the tannic flavor from the wood as it finishes. There is an almost peachy floral and tropical sweetness in the background which is very pleasant and adds to the complexity of the barrel to offset some of the dry elements in the taste. Duck Duck Gooze is as good as I remember from having it at Extreme Beer Fest 2 years ago -it may even be better - the beer has a lot of complexity and wonderful flavors for a 5% wild ale- this was very memorable and well worth the effort to acquire - I wood seek this out again."
"(D)- Just an absolute wonderful wild ale. It really is even better than what I remember from my first time trying it! With a much larger amount to critique and a more quiet setting to enjoy it in, I felt that this deserves an even better rating than I originally gave it. Just a wonderfully easy drinking; balanced and dynamic beer. Lost Abbey has been hit or miss for me, but I really think this is hands down their best offering. I really do not see how it can get any better than this for the style"
"D: Overall a true master piece of a wild ale. Thanks again sweem for the chance to sample a healthy serving of this epic brew."
"This beer pours a beautiful yellow color and is surprisingly clear, only a very slight haze to it. the head is white and laces the glass. the smell is sour, with hints of fruit like green apple, also detect some oak. the taste is pretty close to the smell, it has that lactic sour, with hints of fruit, a little funk to it. the mouthfeel is on the light to medium side with good carbonation. this beer is sour and very drinkable."
"D - This is hard to not demolish before finishing the review, it's very very easy drinking for as sour as it is. It goes down so well, I'd be willing to wager Sweem regretted sharing it."
"O - another great beer I just had tonight. Well worth it."
"Drinkability -- Quite good, though more in line with a younger, unblended lambic with the malt sweetness and gentler brett character. This has to be the most labic-like of any American wild I've had to date. That said I wouldn't say that this is any better than Cantillon or Girardin gueuzes, both of which being far more accessible."
"DB- A very smooth and balanced flavor compared to most sours I have had before. The microbes in the beer lend so many nice flavors and the brewing skill put into this helps balance it into a great beer."
"One of the best and most drinkable sours I've had so far. A great balance of fruit and funk tastes. Let's hope it gets released again!"
"D: My second favorite LA beer I've had to date (behind Cable Car). A very very good beer, and one I've been wanting to try for a long time. Thanks again Jeff!"
"D - Oh yeah, definitely drinkable. I was at the release, and should have bought it instead of the flat Santa's Little Helper and Older Viscosity. But I wasn't into sours then...so what did I know!?"
"D- Very high. This is a fantastic beer. Easy to drink, great flavors, hope to see this one again."
"Overall this is a phenomenal beer that could be confused with the real thing from Belgium. Well worth a shot if you can get your hands on it."
"D-Damn nice stuff. Not overly tart, as the initial sweetness balances this, but enough to make itself known. Overall this is very approachable, inviting and solid sour. One I am certainly glad to have had an opportunity to try,"
"this is great, very well blended and very refreshing. not overly sour but quite sour in general."
"D: Excellent drinker for a sour. Very nice."
"EDIT - This beer is a mess as of April, 2011. I think I was overrating it to begin with. Compared to some better peaches it's completely one-dimensional and has a really flat flavor profile. Acidity has taken over, as it does with most Lost Abbey light sours."
"Drinkability:Amazingly drinkable sour beer. Not as sour as some beers, it's really drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable wild. The sourness is starting to become more intense, which makes this more of a sipper, but a sipper that is full of complexity and great flavor. This is most definitely one of the best sour beers I have ever had, especially from an American brewery. Really a must for all sour heads. I can't wait for the next release. Great job Lost Abbey."
"Bottle. Pours an opaque amber orange color with a nice white head. Strong sour notes and tart fruit in the nose. Some acetone notes as well but very minimal. LIght mouthfeel with a really nice blend of flavors. Fairly sour but not so much that it leaves you puckering. Lemon and straw notes. The acetone notes in the aroma are there in the taste as well but again, very minimal. Finishes dry and clean. Good lace left behind of the glass. A very solid beer that lives up to the hype. Some wine like characteristics. Not sure how this beer really gets any better."
"Great beer. Sadly, I'll probably never taste it again..."
"D: This is the most drinkable wild ale I have ever had. I split my bomber with a friend and I am kind of sad that I didn't just drink the whole bottle."
"Pretty insanely drinkable. Great to try this one. Would be awesome on a hot summer day."
"Clear golden, off white head, minimal lacing. Acetic, brett, lemon, apple, and oak. Up front acetic bite with a sharp lemon peel, very bright taste. Light body, medium carbonation, slightly tannic, and dry finish. I never had it fresh, but from other reviews it seems the acetic character is starting to take over. IP still wins in complexity, this lacks depth."
"The flavor reveals dry grass and white grape rinds. The Gooze is sour, but not crushingly so. Tart acidity on the finish does well to numb the sides of the tongue. Body is on the lighter side of medium, with a crisp carbonation level and drying finish. Drinkable, complex, and very tasty. All in all, a great American-made geuze. Thanks again for the share Mike!"
"This is one great brew !!"
"Had this about a year ago and it has changed a lot. Hazy urine color with lively carbonation. Turbid for the style it's trying to mimic. Aroma is acetone, highly lactic, eggy, sweaty goat fur. I didn't get much brett funk this one just smells sour. Taste has degraded. Eggy, lactic acidity, acetobacter (has a bigger presence). I'm getting a noticeable amount of vinegar that is hurting it's flavor and drinkability. Lemon tartness and high level of sourness is still there. The vanilla sweetness has disappeared or being overpowered by acidity. I felt this used to be a really good beer but seems like it has peaked. I'd love it if an American Wild would have a brett character you didn't have to search through tons of acidity to find."
"Overall, Duck Duck Gooze has some wonderful balance, and is not as intense as I am sure it was coming out of the gates a year ago. I could drink this for days, pairing it occasionally with some triple cream and perhaps apples and/or apricots."
"Drinks: thanks to an epic beer tasting lineup, I was able to enjoy Duck Duck Gooze directly after Isabelle Proximus. In comparing the two, I'd call this the more ""incomplete"" beer. It had a more unique flavor bill, but seemed slightly less well-mingled. Another year or two in the cellar may have improved it a bit."
"D: It's solid, but not worth giving up the farm for it."
"D- I could have killed the bottle with great ease. I was sad to see the bottom of my glass. I will without a doubt, be seeking out another bottle. It was my 2nd favorite sour of the night, only Beatification out shined this and that is really splitting hairs."
"Overall, a real treat and fantastic beer!"
"An awesome beer and well worth tracking down."
"The lead off flavor is a strong lactic and acidic sourness. No sweetness at all. I was expecting some funk to come along but instead there is almost a collapse of the palate close to the back. No tartness in the corners of the mouth you might expect with other, usually fruit, flavored lambics. The body of the beer is pretty thin, minimal carbonation in the mouth but its there. If you hold the beer there for a moment it begins to burn around the gums and behind the lips. The beer is very sour and minimally bitter. Finishes cleanly, probably due to the lack of back palate tart and funk. A great beer overall and a great sour. Thanks again Matt."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability with many sours is a little lower for me, but with this one, I would not have a problem finishing the bottle. Overall, this was my favorite of a night in which 8 of the top 10 sours were consumed. I only wish I had another bottle. Fantastic! Skal."
"Overall, another fantastic and drinkable sour from Tomme.."
"O: less funky but more fruity than deviation (part one of the sours), an excellent beer, good balance, fruit heavy but great mild funk, very easy to drink"
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with active white prickly and sprity head, minimal lacing. Scent is musty and sour, finally mellowing into a slight citrus and biscut note, mild vanilla and oak. First sip is tart, funky and acidic but soon rushed into a very fruity blend... mango, apprico, lemon, pineapple... lots of stuff going on there. Slight biscuty sweetness and hints of the vanilla and oak also present. Medium bodied, active carbonation, dry. A pleasure to sip and could see this improving over a long length of time."
"Coming at me with a hazy yellowish blond look with hints of orange poking around in there. Looks a bit lighter than medium in build and there is no head at all from the tap, no lacing. Smells include big musk of barn with horse and hay. A big basket of lemons and assorted fruits. Oak, wood and some musty aroma with a dousing of brett, maybe lacto? Smells like it's going to be sour. And it is, a nice sour gueuze. I had this out of the bottle young and can tell it's only growing in funk. Taste is tart lemon drops with apricot and small pineapple blast. Warming brings a bit of apple to the stage. In the middle a earthy taste with oak tannins but not any vanilla which is ok by me. The sourness is pleasant and a bit acidic, but not quite there yet. There is actually a nice faint sweetness going along with the sour in that order. Puckering, yes, overly puckering, no. Quite balanced. Medium bodied and nicely carbed. Crisp and semi dry I 'll take another please. Id like to see where this goes in a year or two but the chances of getting another bottle are slim. Another winner."
"This is probably one of my favorite sours ever. Incredibly easy to drink and yet still incredibly sour and complex. An absolute pleasure to drink and makes me want to find a way to get a case of DDG."
"D: I love sour beers and this one is definitely one of my favorites that has a great sour punch and great flavor to back it up. I really hope I can get more of this sour elixer."
"A really delicious beer. I'm as harsh as anyone on LA, but this beer is fantastic. Wish I had more of it."
"D - Like most sours, this one is a very difficult beer to consider ""sessionable."" I love sours, but my palate always feels destroyed after finishing a bottle. Still, I cannot put this one down."
"D= This beer is amazing. I'm glad I had the chance to try it and I hope I will be able to get my hands on it again in the future. A superb drink that I was able to share with my girlfriend after we have both worked looong hour for many days making the setting perfect for a nice sipper to be savored. This beer is something that keeps you coming back for more and more sips. Great job Lost Abbey I look forward to more releases."
"Overall an amazing beer. Can't wait till it comes out again."
"Overall an amazing beer. Can't wait till it comes out again."
"This is another excellent sour from LA and one that surely stacks up against some of the best out there, American or Belgian. Super drinkable, plenty of fruit but with a tag-team combo of funk and lactic/acetic sourness that really comes together well."
"So glad I got to try this. Absolutely wonderful."
"D-Definitely my favorite style of gueuze, what I think of as a ""clean sour"" (other beers on this level that fit in this made up character of mine: Isabelle Proximus, Flaming Fury, etc.)"
"Drinkability- I knew this was going to be good. It's been a fairly obvious consensus on BA for quite some time and I wasn't let down in the least. Supremely drinkable and mega enjoyable, wish I had another bottle to lay down for awhile. Thanks much Matt!"
"Very acidic and mouth puckering, the sourness makes my tongue recoil initially. Very light and enjoyable with that nice spritzy feel that wilds provide so readily. I will need to cleanse my palate with some Pecorino Toscano before moving on."
"3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Duck Duck Gooze by Lost Abbey is an American Wild Ale, 7% and hard to get a hold of since they brew it in very small quantities. It's a blend of their young and old barrel aged beers. It poured a hazy straw yellow with a hint of white head and lacing. It smelled of tart citrus, sour green apples, oak, and some leather notes. It tasted sharp and tart at first with some lemon peel and wood. Then it finished a bit sour and dry but very well balanced."
"D - As I said, split the bottle with one other person and it was not too heavy (nice 7%) nor did it's taste wane"
"The beer is light bodied, well carbonated, very tart and crisp and has a great dry finish. The alcohol is never present, the sour notes take it to the limit on this one and come to a point where they are almost too harsh, but they never get there. This is a very good wild ale, something I can't wait to revisit."
"Tastes just like it smells! Tart up front, oak and lemon...like lemon juice. The second wave is slightly sweet, but finishes quickly with a nice dry sourness that leaves a great tart long lasting aftertaste. Wow what a great beer! Light body, mid to high carbonation...but perfect!"
"D - I could, and would, drink this all day everyday."
"Bottle shared by Eric. Thanks E! Pours light amber color with white head. Aroma is tart, lemon, grass, hay, barnyard, funky, and just smells real acidic. Lively mouthfeel. Flavor follows the nose and has hints of lemon, grass, funk, and is real nice. Finishes real tart and acidic. Great beer."
"D: This is a great sour that i would love to drink on a regular basis. It is loaded with complexities and quenches my thirst at the same time"
"D: Definitely a sipping beer due to the sour. While it does leave the palate feeling ""stripped"" I could literally drink this all day. This one gets an overall ""major noms"" from me."
"D: I <3 this beer. It is that good. I was not sure if I would get to try it and I'm certainly glad I did. This will hopefully not be my last time with this beer. Will seek out a trade for more."
"Opaque straw colored pour with a small, loose, white head. Lactic aroma with a sweet, wheaty malt and a shot of fresh squeezed lemon. The flavor is grainy and grassy with some light sweetness, straw and tart lactic finish with lots of lemon zest. Very dry medium body with soft carbonation. I loved the delicate balance of sweet and sour in this."
"The body is medium and there is a bit of carbonation sting, but overall it is pretty much what I expect out of the style. Overall, this is a great representative of the style and one that is easy to enjoy and also provides enough complexity for deeper examination."
"Incredibly impressive for any American brewery to construct a gueuze like this. Never bet against Lost Abbey sours."
"D: More, please. A serious wild ale that really nails it."
"D: Darn tasty."
"Edit, after having a bottle thanks to kbutler1, I just can't set this beer down. Amazing drinkability *bumped score to a 5.0."
"A very nice level of carbonation makes this brew even more pleasing to the palate and begs for another sip. I would drink a bottle of this every week or so if I had a couple people around to share a bottle. DDG is by no means an introductory sour, but the flavor really isn't too intense. I was digging the aroma much more. Having said that, this beer is pretty...pretty....pretty good. I look forward to seeing how it develops with a little time."
"D: I think this has gotta be the poster child of sours... It doesn't do anything outrageous but it doesn't fail at doing anything either. Very balanced, appropriate smell, taste, and feel. I'd no doubt have this one again but it didn't blow me away like some other sours I've come across."
"D: highly drinkable. Mmmm. I have a feeling that if I weren't trying to get a review out of the tasting amount, this one would be gone pretty quickly (though the sour does naturally slow you down slightly)."
"Drinkability: Fantastic. I kept cleaning my palette and going back for it fresh 'cause that first kick is just amazing. But the followup - that is, once your palette acclimates - reveals whole new flourishes and subtleties and is worth the price of admission alone. And though that price is steep - $30, contributed by the ever-generous Bankhead - this one is a true treat, and I'd be happy to pay that amount for this one again if that were an option. Envy for the west coast BAs abounds!!"
"750ml bottle generously opened by Thirstybird. Served in my 25cl Allagash chalice. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a loose, quarter inch white head that quickly dissipated. Lots of effervescing activity on this one as evidenced by clusters of tiny bubbles adhering to the sides of the glass below the cap; no lacing. Nose is slightly tart and sour with tropical fruits coming out (pineapple, star fruit, etc.)? Taste follows nose - slightly acidic and dry, tart light fruit and a hint of cork. Mouthfeel was very lively and consistent throughout. Finishes dry with some astringency around the salivary glands. This was extremely delicious and even quite refreshing and palette cleansing, even with the incredible fruit profile. This is sour, but not puckeringly so - one of the most memorable beers I've yet to experience. I know it's classified as an American Wild, but definitely some gueze like qualities (I guess hence the name)."
"M + D: This was one of two sours had in the evening, and it brought out the dryness that the other did not. It almost lifts off the tongue... love it! This one steps it up a notch as far as geuze goes, with a little higher alcohol than many. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous sipping sour."
"Drinkability: Very sour but a nice flavor profile and good mouthfeel. I got through the 750ml myself and wanted more."
"D- Very nice drinkability to this one. I was very impressed with this beer. Strike another one up for Lost Abbey. If you get a chance to try this I would not pass it up!"
"NB: I enjoyed this one, highly drinkable and tasty. But it simply is not as good as cable car, isabelle proximus, or any of the Veritas line."
"What can be said really. A really complex gueze-style beer. I don't know how they pulled it off but I'd have been shocked if you told me this wasn't a Cantillon or similar beverage, if I didn't know better."
"Reviewed on 11/29/2009. Bottle thanks to Smokepot (thanks Joe!). Rating #1500!! Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a small white head. Aroma is quite sour-- some barnyard, some sour candies. Flavor of much of the same -- lots of tart candies and mild barnyard. Sour but not acidic. Very pleasant and easy to drink for a sour ale. Excellent!"
"Overall this is an excellent ale and great beer overall. If you love sours this is one you have to search out."
"Highly recommended."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied and relatively dry. An initial blast of sourness makes way for steady, tart acidity. Not quite as sour as I would like but close. Lactic qualities meld with oak tannins and lemon. A touch of green apple enters into play as does a hint of citrus. By and large this isn't an explosion of flavor but that isn't what I was looking for. This is a well crafted, sour beer that makes for pleasant, easy drinking. Very comparable to several of the more mellow and subdued Belgian originals. Well done. Drinkability is through the roof."
"This was, all in all, pretty intense at times for me but in the end, I couldn't ignore the beautiful balance between the tartness, sourness, funk, sweetness, and barrel flavors. Just a fantastic Wild Ale blend here. A beer to be proud of for sure."
"J"
"Overall: I have been waiting to open up this beer for a few months now, and I couldnt think of any better time than Thanksgiving. I now have one more thing to be thankful for."
"D - Exceptional. I could really sit and session with this sour. The sourness is not too much (cuvee rene) as the white wine barrel aging adds residual sweetness. Definitely a top 100 beer."
"Light body, carbonation level is right on the money. Make your own Lost Abbey jokes here. Ridiculously easy drinker for a sour."
"Overall, not what I was expecting. The initial sip was pretty tart and I was expecting for that to continue, maybe even intensify. However, that didn't happen and the finish to the beer was a little too weird for me with the subtle sweetness I was picking up. It's a well made beer, but as a person that craves sours every now and then, this definitely doesn't satisfy my fix. For a $30 price tag, I'd much rather stick to Cantillons, which are cheaper and better IMO."
"DDG leans more toward the vinegar compenent of an AWA."
"Sampled at the FoBAB 2009. The pour is a bright and clean golden color with a big billowing white head. Both the nose an flavor feature lots of cheesy and tart character and light oak character all throughout this . Yummy stuff that is certainly worth being sought after."
"The taste is acidic tart lemon and orange with a moderate lactic sourness. Brett provides mustiness, moderate funk, and a decided cheese quality to the beer. The tart citrus is delicious. Oak is evident. I enjoyed this bottle immensely more than I enjoyed my tap sample. The finish is acidic citrus with a lingering tartness and lactic sourness. This stuff is killer, and so damn drinkable. I'd venture to say this is one of my favorite American Wild Ales and a marvel of blending. Highly recommended. This beer deserves the Gold Medal it won at GABF 2009."
"This is about as drinkable as any wild ale can be, the complexity of the flavor keeps me returning to the glass. At only 7% ABV I'd pop another bottle if I had it. Absolutely recommended, I'm completely thankful for the chance to try it."
"D - My kid would love it, but he loves sour green apple bubble gum. Ok, so do I...."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very drinkable, great acidic backbone, and I thought very drinkable."
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced. a touch more acidity than i prefer, but a nice depth to the funk."
"Puckering tartness, funky barnyard, acidic apple, drying tannin, buttery oak, all the flavors you would hope for and then some. I preferred Cuvee de Tomme, but this was still one of the 10 best beers I had that weekend and there was plenty of greatness to choose from. One of the best sours I have tasted and an excellent name/label too."
"Well done."
"D: Drink pretty damn easy."
"I've had this a couple of times now, last time a bottle I split with my wife. Just a fantastic brew, and everything I was looking for in the style. Sure, its still on the young side and exhibits more of the acetic and lactic notes than it does the barnyard at this juncture, but I like that too. Really its a matter of taste. The analogy that comes to mind is that of a soft, washed rind cheese- do you like it ripe, runny, and rank, or do you like it a little firmer, slightly sour, and just a bit piquant? Same with wild ales for me. I like them both ways, and I think one can have a classic in either maturity level. This particular beer is a classic for me in the younger, tarter vein. This pours a hazy yellow with a thin wispy head that sticks around. Smells beautifully balanced with sour acetic, lactic, and bright fruit- the fruit components showcase orange, tangerine, and muscat. Just beautiful. The taste has a long lactic finish, bright citrus, and some light funk coupled with nice firm tannins from the oak. The mouthfeel is lactic and punchy with enough tannins to give some structure to the sour fruit. Great beer, and a testament to what Lost Abbey can do when eveerything goes well."
"Overall, an exceptional wild ale that is worthy of the hype and praise. A world class beer. Very reminiscent of Isabelle Proximus which is one of my all-time favorites. Most highly recommend. Rotation: not available here and extremely hard to get so while I'd like some more this probably it for now. If here, I would get several bottles a year."
"D - Pretty drinkable sour. Very intense flavoring but it all blends together very well. Wish this was more readily available. Glad I got a chance to try it."
"D: Easy drinking considering the amount of sourness and funk here. Definitely a winner from Lost Abbey. Glad I hunted this down."
"Duck Duck Gooze is just for you"
"Huge thanks to Weibull for his overflowing generosity, never thought i'd get to try this! Thanks also to Masterski for the preview sample!"
"Tart and very puckering with some strong acidity. Lots of barnyard horseblanket funk with some nice golden fruit notes. Apple, pear, white grape and some strawberry and cream. Extremely dry and sour and very refreshing. Nice earthy oak presence with subtle vanilla characteristic. Pretty well balanced with pleasant light fruit nuances that counter the extremely sour funky notes. Bone dry sour puckering finish. Actually pretty drinkable after the initial palate shock. Probably not worth the $30 price tag but still very good. Recommended."
"Bottle at the RBSG grand tasting, thanks to Tomme via alohaC who just walked up and poured it into my glass. What service! Hazy blond color with a white head. Funky, horsey and sour aroma with a tart orange juice element. A nice level of sour in the flavor. Not as sour as the better Belgian Gueuzes, but with a similar character of funk and lemon. Pretty good stab at a gueuze, but I couldn't help thinking that I would rather go out and buy the real thing for less money."
"D: Drinkability is quite high; as I took my second sip, I was saddened by the fact that I had only another 700 mL or so of this tart, puckering nectar. While this may not have been the kindest year to Lost Abbey, Duck Duck Gooze is certainly making the brightest impression upon me."
"D- I don't even know what to write for drinkablility. Although, I do wish I had more of it to drink."
"D - High. This is actually pretty refreshing for a wild ale and goes down easy despite the tartness."
"On the spectrum of Lost Abbey adventures, where most have been either great, or more frequently, a disaster, this manages to be somewhere in the middle."
"Golden with a slight haze. Two fingers of head rises from vigorous pouring and retains fairly well, ultimately settling to a thick disc around the rim of the glass. The nose is complex but balanced, barnyard funk backed by lemon and orange-like acidity, lactic sourness, acetic acid, and a unique tropical fruit sweetness that really makes the beer. Opens on the palate with sharp lactic acidity and well-expressed tannins. Fruit flavors of pineapple, orange and lemon add interesting complexity. Moderate acetic presence mid-palate, woody and lightly astringent, with the malt coming out a bit more, lending a light sweetness that leads into a dry, sharp and tannic finish. The noticeable acetic quality is a slight detraction, but I love the strong tropical fruit character. Another winner for Lost Abbey; they should really concentrate on these barrel-aged sour beers, they're often excellent."
"Overall, lives up to the hype machine. A great beer and though labeled an American wild ale, the closest American approximation to a Belgian gueuze that I've ever tasted I'd say. I have a second bottle that I'm going to age and give another try. We'll see how this one grows. Get a bottle if you can."

"D: Well worth the wait, this is fantastic gueuze/wild ale, I wish I could drink more of it."
"I could drink a lot of this beer. The aroma is nicely complex and though the flavor could be a little bit more so, it is still a fine tipple overall. This substitutes very nicely for a traditional Belgian-sourced Lambic and I so wish I had a bunch of bottles of this. For those who like a more integrated faux Lambic, this beer will be enjoyed a bit more than the fresh Isabelle Proximus. Comparing these fresh though, I liked the additional complexity of the Isabelle Proximus (funkiness and oak were more prominent in the first beer released). This is still quite a fine beer though and it serves as proof that the funky beers at Lost Abbey are still strong and full of life."
"I. Want. MORE!"
"Drinkability? No sign of the abv and quite frankly, I didn't ""expect"" any as most of the style are in the reasonable alcohol content department. That being said, this is so easy to drink for me, it makes me shudder. I'm so glad I opted to buy this, being a Sinners Club member. So many positives and so few negatives. Are there any? Fantastic brew!!"
"Poured on tap into plastic sampling cup, so unable to appreciated true head/lacing. Appearance-hazy, pale yellow, almost little milky. Lightly/perfect carbonation. Smell-tart, sweet, citrusy, little funk on the side w/sourness but not super funky or 'horse blankety' in any way. Very dry finish and easy drinking. Could drink several of these unlike many wild ales that are more sippers. Very well balanced IMO."
"Wow, this stuff is great. One of the best new beers I've had in 2009. Split a bottle with abfraser last night. Beautiful straw/lemon/golden color with an inch of white head. Very tart, green apple, citrus, slight funk, acidic. Medium dryness and astringency. Slight sweetness, but this really strikes the right balance of dryness. Love this stuff. Wish I had half a case of it to age."
"Overall - Wow, just wow. I had been worried with all the heat that Lost Abbey has taken recently as to whether or not this one would stand up. And boy did it ever. One of the best sours I have ever had, hands down. Up there with Isabelle and Beatification, this thing is a beast. This must be sought out, it lives up to the hype and actually surpassed it for me."
"D - Such an easy wild ale to drink...I probably could have drink the entire bottle myself if not for the tasting I brought this bottle to. Can't wait to crack another open and review again."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased for thirty dollars last weekend, also had two pints of it there along with a few samples at the Stone Sour Fest the week before that, opened last night with Dane since he had not had it yet, poured into my Duvel tulip glass, color is a golden orange with some lighter shades, one inch aggressively bubbly white head, not much retention, pretty weak lacing but typical of the style, aroma consists of oak tannins, lemons, oranges, tangerines, horse blanket, funkiness, wild yeast, white wine, and vinegar, flavor starts off with a salty tart bite full of citrus, some malts in the middle that are bit crackery and offset the tartiness well, finish is pretty dry but has a good amount of funk too, warms up with green apples and sour citrusy fruits, slightly dry, citrusy, and funky mouthfeel, medium bodied, highly carbonated, taste lingers well for a gueuze, easy to drink and refreshing, crisp and light feeling, no alcohol in the taste, have been waiting for this one for years since I first laid my eyes on these barrels and it did not disappoint, it should develop quite a bit with age too, not quite a gueuze you would expect from Belgium but a quality American interpretation, will be drinking again, recommended"
"Overall: The quality and complexity of this sour was extremely similar to those brewed by Russian River...who probably do the best job with this style. A must have. Cheers!"
"D: A delicious beer, and one of the first geuzes I've had the pleasure of tasting. I know that I could definitely do worse on ""breaking in"" to the style."
"d - all day every day. one of the best beers i've had in a while."
"Drinkability: As drinkable as they come. I could've gone through pint after pint of this, and would've had it not started to run out / me go broke. But as great as I'd hoped, and here's to hoping it's all that and more out of the bottle!"
"I think this one will age very well and get drier and funkier as the years go by. Looking forward to having a pint and buying some bottles of this at the upcoming release."
"It's an excellent sour. Light yellow and murky liquid with good lacing. The smell is mostly sweet and sour lemons with a refined funk. The flavor is pleasantly sour, and the beer is quite drinkable. The malt gives the beer a refined sweetness. It's a refreshing gueuze with an easily likable flavor. While I like strong funk and sour flavors, this is still an excellent gueuze."
"**UPDATE: somewhat uniquely amongst Lost Abbey beers (recently), this was BETTER in the bottle than it was on tap. Shocking, I know. The citrus and vinous vinegary-ness was more lipsmackingly addictive, and with a big amount to linger over the nuances became much more noticeable. The oak finish and unripe apple sensation, for example, was more prominent as one worked their way through a larger serving size. One of the most drinkable sours I've come across."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting courtesy alohaC. Pale milky straw color with a thin white head. Aromas of lemon meringue, chlorine, honey. Tart and acidic flavor but not that sour. Lemons and oranges, almost pine-sol-esque at times, sweeter grains and honey/caramel. Pretty dang good but not top tier."
