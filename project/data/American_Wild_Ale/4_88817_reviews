"The beer pours a slightly opaque dark amber (more viscous than cloudy), with no head or sediment. The nose has an off-putting amount of fruity acetone upfront with candi sugar and oak doing little to entice. The taste has a similar nail polish quality, but more tartness and is made drinkable only by a modest brown sugar sweetness that comes in on the back end. It's medium bodied and mildly carbonated with fruity sweetness the lingering element in its semi-dry finish. There is minimal bitterness, but alcohol slowly creeps in for a warming effect. Honestly, this has been a let down for me considering the difficulty it was to track down and seemingly promising ratings."

"Orangey amber. Good head. Definite wet dog, funky farmhouse freshness, sour lemon. Approachable flavor, balanced bitter/sour"
"Almost cidery, different in a good way"
""
"Overall. Good stuff if you like a flanders style."
""
""
""
"Lot of cherry notes. The nose was a lot like chardonnay and the taste was a little sweet and dry, almost wine-like."
"O: Sweet and sour, just like I like it, this brew was aged for about a year so the flavors settled a little but the booze was very present. A good beer, fruitful."

"Pours a clear brown-amber with small head. Aroma is very oaky, cherries and caramel malts. Alcohol is not very perceptible for such a high abv sour, but the strong malt base is certainly distinctive. I’m not surprised about the long oak-aging period as the taste is incredibly woody. Other flavors are coherent with aroma (cherries, caramel) with a decent tart finish."

""

"D: really good stuff. wouldn't expect anything less from these guys when it comes to funk. worth it if you can find any at this point. to all my cellar-heads out there, drinks great now and im sure it will hold up great for a few more years."

"Bottled 12/2012. Poured into a teku. Delicious, sour, smooth. It might have been a tad more sour if I drank a few months ago, but I found this delicious anyway. Allagash continues to impress with their higher-end beers, with bold and complex flavors. It smells great and it drink just as satisfyingly. I didn't get the funk that others did--something I noticed with most old ales. Instead, I got an appealing sour and tart taste that is balanced by the right amount of heat. Can't wait to get my hands on this again next year."
""
""
""
"Overall- Interesting oak-aged sour, but certainly nothing near the best beers that Allagash makes. I'm looking at you, Resurgam. I won't be looking for this one again, but I'm glad to have tried the first beer they made in their foeders. Allagash is the closest you can get to Belgium without going there."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - the oak and balanced funk/acidity are the highlights on this beer. Absolutely delicious."
""
""
""
"I have been a big fan of Allagash's sour program since its inception a few years back, but this beer really takes the prize as being the best of the bunch thus far. Kudos to Rob and company for creating a Flemish sour ale that competes with some of the best examples that Belgium has to offer."
""
"O: Holy Christ this is excellent. Lots of big and round malt character with all the requisite tartness and funk. It offers another dimension not found in most sours. A real eye-opener for those who think only of Belgium when discussing world-class sours."
""
""
""
"It’s too bad this is such a limited offering, as I would really like to enjoy much more of this beer. It’s just delicious."
""
"M - Medium body. Dry. Light carbonation."
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium body with a slightly creamy texture and a nice balance of dry oak, sweet vinous fruit and funky bugs.  Dry oak, musty brett and funky yeast up front followed by caramel malt sweetness, vinous fruit and lingering acetic vinegar.  The acetic presnce is there but isn't harsh or overpowering.  Not too solvent-like with a nice vinegary presnce complimenting the sweet cherries and other dark fruit notes.   Well balanced and decently sour with a nice earthy oak flavor and substantial funk countering the acetic character.  "

" M - medium bodied it less, mildly sticky on the tongue"
""
""
""
"A pleasantly approachable barrel-aged wild ale, the wood apparently taking the edge off of the sour, tart, and funky essences (I say that without having tried any other offering from this brewery). Rather, the sweetness complements the sourness, et al, to the point of a semblance of balance. Tasty, complex stuff, this is."
"O - Funk and tart lemon and lots of oakiness."

"O- Really enjoyed this one. Had it at the brewery on tap and loved it, and I'm happy to say its just as good from the bottle. Glad i have 3 more, look forward to aging this one and trying it again further down the road."
""
"O: excellent sour from a great brewer. Not easy to find, so consider trading for it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a bit disappointed with this beer, it has some pleasant aroma as it warms however some unfavorable yeasty bready characteristics that impair the flavor."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice Wild Ale from Allagash. Yet another success in their line of sour and wild ales, and one of the more peculiar wild ales I've tried to date with the malt character. Definitely worth trying."

"Hazy orange amber in color with a medium sized off-white colored head. This has a sweet and super funky smell to it. Oak, banana, overripe berries, musty damp forest. The taste is nicely tart with a light fruitiness – strawberry and raspberry, followed by funkiness and more sour notes. There’s a slight buttery flavor as well, but very faint. Finishing with a pleasant oaky dryness, this beer hits all the right spots. There’s a lot of alcohol at nearly 9% but it’s very well hidden and it drinks wonderfully. The carbonation level is quite good. There’s not much lacing on the glass but the head is retained very well as I drink. This is the first sour I’ve had from Allagash and it does not disappoint."

"Overall: I really like this Allagash beer; its really solid. It does remind me of a Flander Red, but not as sweet as most from that beer style. I like the Coolship beers much more than this Allagash beer, but its definately not a slacker. It seems like Allagash's calling card is balance when it comes to sour beers. Allagash is a fantastic domestic sour brewer."
""
"O - Overall an interesting wild ale. A bit different than most wilds out there. Extremely light in funk, sourness/tartness is quite low for style too. Almost a Flanders brown in character. More malt character than most. Interesting interpretation...very nice."
""
""
"O: Really nice balance of tart and sweet flavors. Honestly might be the best wild ale I've ever had. Nice bright but well-integrated flavors. Sweet and sour. Delicious and well crafted."
""
""
""
""
"O/DA neat beer with a ton of action to really avert your attention towards. It was fun but I don't think I really enjoyed it as much as many on BA. Very interesting all in all."
""
"Awesome complexity with a great balance of sweet and sour fruit, bugs and barrel. Everything feels smooth and in-check."
""
"Not the most complex or intense wild on the market, but damn if it's not fantastic. Heavy on the acetic and wood, but it works with the sweetness. Aging will just make this better."

"Firmly rooted in the traditions of the East Flanders region, based in Oudenaarde, Zottegem, and Bellegem-Kortrijk, it gets top marks as an Oud Bruin."
""
""
" Thanks Brez, this is the shit."
"Very nice. Lots of acidity, but enough malt character to balance."
""
""
""
"Pour has hues of orange through a ruby color and a bubbly off white head. The nose is pretty nice, oak and vanilla play off of a strong cherry and fairly powerful dusty presence. Taste is a touch less bright and bit too sweet. The oak is played down, cherry pie is the center piece. Faintly dusty and moderately sour. Acidity is low in back, average carbonation an slightly dry. Body is a touch syrupy and rather full. It's solid, nothing great but decent American sour."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good tasting but overly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"This is not the best sour I've ever had, but it's very, very good. It's very complex, with a wide array of sour, tart, fruity, oaky, and funky notes. I've certainly enjoyed sours from Allagash at fests, and I'm very thankful that I've now had time to sit down with a bottle. I hope they continue to develop their sour program."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good take on the style, but it's not nearly assertive enough to get to the high mark of the style that resides in Rodenbach Grand Cru. However, it might be the best Flanders Red style ale I've had outside of Belgium."

"This is a very well put together beer from Allagash. It looks good, the nose is complex and nicely aromatic, the flavors work well together, and the feel is spot on for the style. A real under-the-radar beer that's well worth stocking up on."
""
""
""
"I have another bottle but after that think I will have to pass just because so pricey in comparison to other great sours"
"O: Overall, its a well done beer, but I prefer my Wilds Ales more lacto and pedio and less brett. I was hoping for much more sour presence. Im glad I was able to try this one, but for the price I dont think its something I would get again, even if it were available to me on the shelves. 4"

"O: I wish this beer was cheaper. At almost 9% ABV, this is so drinkable. So refreshing. I could sip on it for a while, or drink it quick on a hot summer day. A really nice beer that wine folks could get into. Love it, glad I have another bottle. Cheers!"
"Bottled 12-21-2012. Picked up a bottle at the brewery tasting room. Served in a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white surface coat of head. Some very small bubbled carbonation activity throughout the body. Aromas of tart berry and cherry sweetness, with a touch of booze, some woody characteristics, and a sour highlight. Very balanced and robust nose. Flavors are rich and tart cherry on the forward tongue, with a sour tang throughout. Wood character balances more as the beer travels the palate, ending with an almost wine-like feel at the end of each drink. The carbonation and thin body lead to an effervescent feel in mouth, with a crisp, almost bubbly finish. The tartness builds slowly in mouth, with an underlying cherry sweetness. Very fruity and very crisp, with bold notes of sour and tart. Tremendous representation of the style."

"375ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash chalice at 55 degrees. Pours a dull copper with just the slightest haze. Head is 3/4's of an inch, bright white and rocky. As it dissipates into a soapy slick, delicate, textured, concentric bands of lacing are revealed. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution and also adhering to the walls of the glass. What a great nose on this beer - tannic, tart, some vinegary notes, all reminiscent of a flanders red or oud bruin. I also get a suggestion of cherry Sucrets. Taste follows nose; however, there's a slightly medicinal quality to the flavor profile and some vanilla notes come out as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light-medium. Carbonation is minimal, but the acidity gives quite a bit of character. There's also a trace of creaminess to the texture and the finish is quite dry. Overall, more of a Flanders Red/Oud Bruin in style than what I have come to associate with an American Wild. Enjoyable, but for the price point, I'd go with a Rodenbach Grand Cru."
""
"O: a good sour overall. A little undercarbonated, but smells and tastes great."
"O: I found this to be a very pleasant drinking wild ale as it wasn't too sour. I would have no problem drinking more than one of these in a sitting."

"Overall it was an enjoyable beer but at over $1 per oz, I think I'll skip going for it again."

"The beer pours a ruddy orange/red with a big tight creamy yellow/white head of tiny, small packed bubbles. In body the beer appears clean but hazy with lots of bubbles racing to replenish the head. On the nose, the beer smells of funky cherry fruit leather with a smell resting below these scents and adding a malty backbone to the yeast funk. There is a touch of deep funk in this beer as well that I can’t decide if I like it or not… It is prickly on the nose with hints of pineapple, then pine, and then compost, but it is not particularly displeasing, just a little odd. On the tongue, the beer tastes funky acidic and then very oddly bitter. At first I thought I might have an infected bottle, but as I let the beer sit and I sipped it more, some of the off flavors, oddly, mellowed out and the beer became not bad. I have had this beer before on tap, however, and it was far fruitier and more interesting then. In flavor the beer begins with tart green apple but then opens into weird grassy bitter and pear and apricot notes, with funky cherry fruit leather thrown in. The beer then mellows out into smooth malty brown sugar notes with light caramel and funky notes thrown in. Throughout the taste, the bitter occasionally become unappetizingly medicinal with a touch of compost added in, which takes away from the taste. The tart green apple flavors seem to linger in the mouth throughout the taste and then return in the aftertaste to leave a nice pucker along with a lingering bitter medicinal flavoring. In the mouth the beer feels on the heavier side of light with prickly carbonation that is soft and fluffy except for its bite. The mouth is left puckering and oddly bitter with a weird saltiness as well. There is a decent amount of saliva filling the mouth to neutralize the acid. Overall, this is a weird beer. I don’t think this one held up as well in the bottle, and I probably wouldn’t spend the money on it. This is an alright beer but it has off tastes and a weird, chemically bitterness that gets better but is never that great on the tongue. That being said, I only realized now that this beer is 8.9% alcohol, which is impressive. This is an interesting beer. If Allagash can perfect bottling what they served on tap for this beer, then it will be amazing, but as it is, it falls short. An okay beer that I would like to see improve."
""
"O - I can't say I have had a bad beer from Allagash and this is no exception. Powerful fruity sour notes make for a deliciously complex brew. I would rate it higher if not for the slightly astringent aftertaste (I am particularly sensitive to this in some Brett beers). I would recommend this to a friend, but at $1/oz. I probably won't rush back to the store to grab more."
"Overall: As my first full bottle of the American Wild Ale style, I can truly say that I'm extremely impressed. I'm a supporter of Allagash and everything they do, so it was only natural that my first experience with my style would be brewed by them. Their coolship program is definitely paying dividends and I really can't wait to crack open the Cerise I have."
""

""
"B+"
"This is a really nice beer. It's richly malty, estery, and tart. It's almost exactly what I want in a Wild Ale. This is definitely worth a try."

""
""
""
""
"O - very enjoyable glad I picked up a bottle, good amount of sour in my opinion, not overwhelming."
""
""
"Pours a dark orange brown with a finger of head, pretty much the same color as the label. Smells extremely winey (in an amazing way). Sour, orange, oak, tannins, grapes, sour cherries. Tons of delicious dry fruity notes coming through on the nose. Taste is perfectly tart with lots of fruitiness and a slightly dry tannic finish that compliments the tiny bit of sweetness coming through. This is one fantastic beer, amazing balance and very complex. The yeast did an incredible job, but doesn't overpower the other flavors at all."
""
""
""
""
"O - Another letdown from Allagash. They don't do anything special in my opinion. When I smelled this I was very impressed and hoping they finally pulled one off, but I was wrong. I'd drink it, but I probably wouldn't buy it."
""

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with fruit, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall: Interesting wild ale from Allagash. A stronger tatness/sourness could have really sent this one over the top for me, but its still an excellent beer thats worth seeking out."
"O - I definitely enjoyed this, but I wouldn't call it complex. Each flavor is very pronounced but blends together well in a harmonious fashion. I would have no problem polishing off a 750ml of this (if they ever made one) by myself. This is a sour that both serves as a great anytime sour and also one which would serve as a great introduction to people new to sours. Well done Allagash."
""

""
""
""

"This is an interesting, complex sour in the Flanders red ale style. The alcohol is noticeable at around 9%."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O – I really enjoyed this complex brew. This is the first beer of this type that I have tried from Allagash, but it certainly has me interested in trying as many as I can. Highly recommended."
""
"O: Great American wild from Allagash. Not overwhelmingly sour or funky, but the brett and lacto work extremely well together to create a great balance of funk/sour and barnyard. Not overwhelmingly pricey for an American wild either, especially by Allagash standards. Get some if you still can!"
""
"Strange that the reviews are so high for this one... Unsure if I am unfair and my palate just doesn't like these types of wilds but I found the smell to be a turnoff, the taste to be horrible with super sour fruitiness and after taste awful. I wanted to really like it being originally from Maine and normally loving Allagash but I couldn't. Couldn't even drink it but luckily was with a buddy who enjoyed in. Would not buy again"
""
"O: Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I would recommend it and would buy it again. I think that everything I have to say was said before. I really don't have any negatives for the beer. It is a very impressive beer."

"The beer pours a cloudy dark reddish amber color with a finger of fluffy off white head. The head sticks around quite nicely. The smell is quite sour and funky with a nice fruity sweet note to it. The taste isn't as intensely sour as I expected from the smell. I'm getting an herbal funk along with a mild oaky note. The taste has a touch of herbal sweetness to it along with a very tart finish. The carbonation is very smooth with small bubbles. The finish isn't as dry as I thought it would be."
""
""
"Additionally, this go-round I really thought the rich sherry came through a lot more and really toned down the acidity. I think between the two versions (if they are in fact different) was the second one. That said, this was also the first sour I had ever had, so my initial perceptions about its ""sourness"" may have just been skewed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic beer. More funky than tart, but a good amount of both."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice beer, not great though compared to many others."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied. Some creaminess mid palate."
"As a new, somewhat American way to achieve the taste, texture, and aroma of Flanders's Red Ale, much of the same characteristics can be found in this distinctive and exuberant ale."
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good aceto/brett-centered beer. The acidity is balanced by a decent amount of malt/tannic sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"As I'm new to sours, I keep discovering new and subtle little differences in them. Poured this one into a tulip, and was instantly greeted by that newly-familiar tart odor. It has a touch of sour cherries, but was muted by a bit of an oaken, burnt smell as well. I started drinking it slightly chilled in the fridge, where the sour notes were prevalent, allowing the slight effervescence to play on the tongue. As it warmed, though, the wood started to become a lot more dominant compared to the base tartness. It took on a bit of an edge to it, with the oak getting aggressive. Really a terrific, complex sour!"
""
""
"Very tasty with a perfect and challenging sourness level."
""
""
"Overall: A decent enough sour from Allagash, although I didn't enjoy it as much as some of the others in their lineup; still, that makes it a mighty fine beer by a much broader standard"
"Overall though this is just a fantastic beer to be drinking, it's like a bretty Rodenbach filled with wonderful bittern lemon and grapefruit. Fantastic stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Sours for me are like playing Russian Roulette (though I guess that's also how the brewer who's making it feels). I tend to like the sweeter ones more although, if it's too sour, I still won't like it. This one is pretty much right on the money: lots of fruit characteristics to balance out the medium-high level of sour and a feel that's not too harsh. Though my 500th review isn't a scorcher, it's a damn fine beer and that's good enough for me. Forever in debt to BlackBelt5112203 for this one."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very tasty beer and another very solid sour from Allagash, I'm glad I've got another bottle of this to hang onto."
""
""
"O- This is a great sour from Allagash and I am very happy that I was able to get a bottle. This is sour and all the flavors work together and are balanced. Easy to drink and quick to drink."
""
"o - Overall I loved this one; one of the better sours at the fest. Not the most complex sour and not as funky as some of their other beers, but it's a great fruit forward sour. I love cherries and loved this one; would love to get a bottle of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very impressive beer. Very much so brewed to the Flemish bruin/red style but with a nice little American twist. Pretty unreal levels of fruit flavors considering there was no fruit additions. I wish the beer wasn't so damned limited or expensive because this is just excellent."
"O: One of the better special releases I have ever had. Well worth the fifteen bucks. Thank you Allagash for a balls to the walls American sour alike none other before it. Bien sur le foudre!!!"
""
"Overall, a really good beer."
""
""
"Taste starts out with a vinegar sourness with a well rounded oak character, cherry presents a touch of fruity tartness, acidic content is on the high side but I like that, carbonation is close to perfect with a decent body, alcohol is very well hidden making me believe this closer to 4.5% than 8.9% so very impressive."
""
""
"Hazy reddish-brown with a small amount of creamy head on top. Aromas of tart cherries, spicy wood, earthy fruit and a touch of caramel. Quite acidic flavor-wise...tart fruit, oak, spicy sharpness, some tannins, and a pleasant sweetness. Dry, yet slick, medium body and no trace of alcohol. A little rough around the edges, but still very tasty and well-crafted in the Flanders style. I have to wonder if they were to blend this with a younger beer, if everything would smooth out and take this to the next level."
""
""
"O-An very enjoyable sour from Allagash. Would try again without hesitation."
"D - The heavy oak character gives this a more American spin, and it's not quite as sweet as something like Rodenbach. I enjoyed this, and it's nice to see that the quality has been maintained, or even increased, as Allagash expands their wild program. Would happily drink this again."
""
"Overall, a solid well-crafted brew that I would drink again w/o hesitation, but slightly misclassified. This is a Flanders Red w/ subtle to moderate Oude Bruin characteristics not an American Wild, and this is not a negative."
""
""
""
""
""

"Reminds me a lot of Consecration without the red wine presence. It's almost got a touch of it though somehow."

"O: Really liked what I got out of this, nice Flanders type flavors with a mellow funkyness layered in there. The cherry / wine nose and flavors were great for not having added anything like that. I hope eventually the price comes down, I would definitely we willing to pay $12-14 for a 750ml, but for a 375ml it feels kinda steep."

"Had during Brewvival 2013! Served from tap into a Brewvival sampler shaker. Poured a golden pale yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, funk, subtle tartness, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, funk, earth, fruit, and subtle tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I was really glad to see this one show up at the festival as the reviews I’ve read on this one as it all sounded really good. While this one was solid for the style, it didn’t quite deliver like I would have hoped. Still very nicely done and glad I got the chance to try this one on tap."

"Pours a rich burgundy going into mahogany, with a small white head. Smells of sour cherries, green apple, oak. First flavors that hit your tongue are unripe apple, cooking spices, with a sherry finish. There is a little funk here, light barnyard, hay, biscuit and bread flavor. The finish is harsh. Cloying acetic quality burns the back of your throat. This is not a jaw cramping sour but more of a slow heartburn quality. Vomit flavor? Mouthfeel is fine, its certainly not viscous or vinuous. Carbonation is ok. The tour guide said it best when he described when he would have this beer: ""I could drink one glass, with a friend, in front of a fire, while discussing Chomsky."""

"Overall pretty nice sour, good sour funk, light fruit flavors from the wild yeast, just a bit of malt, etc. However, this isn't quite as good as the Coolship beers, and it's almost the same price, so hard to go for more of this despite being a good sour."
"This is light bodied with nice sharp carbonation; another tasty brew from Allagash."
"Medium body and fairly-light carbonation. Expertly done. One of the best Flanders-style beers that I've ever had, especially considering that it's from the U.S."
