"Malty aroma has a tart fruity overtone and a hint of horehound. Pours a clear, dark mahogany with a thick wheat head. Malty flavor has woody and tart fruity notes, giving it an almost wine-like nature. Smooth texture has good fizz and rather wine-like body, leaving a tart and woody finish. Distinctive, enjoyable, tasty."

"Extremely acid beer. Oak taste. Little bitter at the end."

"This is a great way to get into sour beers, but once you've had some great ones. This leaves you missing big flavors. I wanted more cherry, or fruit forward sourness coming through. It lacked a big vinegar backbone. It had very little ""funk""."

"Perfect for those interested in dipping their toes into the world of sour beers rather than diving in headfirst.  There's a bit of sour cherry tartness, but it's restrained.  Not a whole lot of depth to it, but what it does, it does fairly well.  Malt isn't very pronounced, hops aren't a factor.  No hot alcohol taste, which is good for a 9% ABV brew.  A well done effort by Sam Adams."

"Okay at best. Worth 8 dollars."
"Add another star for the fancy bottle. Once again, feel let down by Samuel Adams. I could have spent my money on something better."
"Very tart. Sour taste. One glass is plenty."
"Pours a cloudy dark Amber. thick cream colored head.  Good carbonation.  Smells a bit sour almost like a white wine.  Great tart/sweet taste that balance each other well.   Finishes with slight alcohol warmth. Very refreshing.  This is a great beer!"

"Deep amber color with a touch of red. Tan foam and a sour but not unpleasant aroma. I really noticed red wine flavors, fruity and dry. Not overpowering to people who may think an american wild ale sounds intimidating. Overall pretty good."

"so good and so different, its nice to know the big guys can still pull off beer like this. its cool stuff, somewhere in the flanders red neighborhood, but it feels sour from a blend, not sour from a raw ferment, which is fine, but that's the point of departure for me. deep brick red color with some haze to it and a tall tan head with 100% retention, as long as I drink this the head holds up. the nose here is tangy with some fruity notes, dried cherries or even cranberries seem obvious, but red wine tannins, plums, lacto, and wet oak are all there too. the taste is similar with the sourness coming fist, even before the malt, which is big and round and caramel based but only moderately sugary. pucker but not caustic on the acidity, and its short lived and quickly balanced out by the fruit and the density of the grain. a really unique beer, especially at this abv, which I think is an odd feature for it. heavy oak too, really pleasant this time of year. super impressed with the clever uniqueness of this beer and its overall quality. im so used to seeing the seasonals and boston lager from these guys, its nice to know they are capable of beers this special. worth way more than what they ask for it, I like that too!"
"Great balanced sour beer with enough sweet to balance the tart and a little bit of funk and barrel character to boot."

"Pours a deep ruby with a short-lasting light tan head. A little soapy lacing is left behind. The aroma is dark fruit, slightly tart like fresh sour cherries. The taste, though, is underwhelming. A little bit of the tartness remains, but disconnected from any other flavor. There isn't much of the bourbon barrel aging process noticeable either, beyond a hint of wood towards the back of the tongue. It also has a little bit of fizzy quality to the body, despite not much carbonation. It could be, and should be, much better."

"Incredible drinkability. I have a hard time not purchasing a Stony Brook Red every time I come across one. This has long ago become one of my favorite beers."
""
"It is super-smooth. A very drinkable brew - Not as sour as some others, but the cherry-like character and firm malt backing give it a pleasant balance and smoothness while allowing the sour character to come through."

"I know I may be in the minority in this one, but this beer tastes like straight teriyaki sauce. It may just be the bottle I drank (I hope so) but the taste was just horrible. The coloring and mouthfeel is alright, but otherwise, avoid this at all costs."

"Pours a pretty deep mahogany in color with a good 2+-finger off-white head that settles down a to a thin layer on top and sides of the glass. Spotty lacing is seen when sipped. Lots of sediment left in the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is of dark fruit, toasted malts from a oak barrel. The taste is really complex with a tart cherry at first which is quickly overtaken by the oak that finishes with a slightly vinegar finish. More probably going on for sure but is hard to pin-point. Overall a different brew but tasty."
"O - This is a nice refreshing beer! I was surprised that it held up for so long and I'm strongly considering picking up another just to see what it would be like fresh. If I do so I'll certainly update the review."
""
""
""
"Pours reddish tinged brown, lighter on bottom. Some white foam sits atop. Caramel notes, light malty sweetness. Little oak in there. Light sour taste that builds to a pucker. Woodsy sour. Cherry fruit mixed. Full bold mouthfeel. Really good."
""
"O - Samuel Adams greatest achievement with Stony Brook Red is making a near double-digit alcohol beer drink like half its content. This Flanders Red, if you will, has a nice touch of oak aging and funky sourness to it that creates a different experience but it's greatest achievement is also it's undoing I feel. The strength in numbers doesn't shine through, but the slightly heavier body and fuller maltiness leads this beer down a path of less drinkability; a detour from the course the style originally intended. It's nice to see big brewers like this playing around with sour beers though."
"Overall: this beer has some good qualities to it (brightness and good brett balance) but overall its a little too vinegary and acidic for me. the flavors aren't quite developed for me."

"The beer pours some light head that dissipates very quickly. The head is an off-white color and has a foamy texture. The beer itself is a clear ruby red. The beer has a strong tarty smell with a slight oak and vanilla note. The tart is a dark cherry tart with dark fruit notes. The other notes enhance the tart and compliment it well. There are also some dark fruit notes but they get lost in the tart smell. The taste notes are similar to the smell. The taste has the same funk taste but the dark fruit notes are much stronger. The oak and vanilla notes are still there but they come at the end of road. The lighted toasted malts make an appearance in the taste. The beer has thick and sticky feeling. The beer is medium bodied with biting carbonation. Overall, a decent beer."
""
"Notes: It's krieky and jammy with plenty of character."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, plum, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, oak, clove, pepper, leather, caramel, toast, light chocolate, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, plum, red wine, oak, clove, leather, funk, light vinegar, hay, straw, herbal, caramel, toast, light chocolate, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, cranberry, green apple, plum, raisin, red wine, oak, clove, leather, funk, light vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, oak barrel, and dark malt flavors; with balanced sweetness/tartness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/acidic mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice wild ale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak barrel, and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, a decent brew, not something I'd go out of my way to try again, but on sale at the grocery, it was worth it.  Doesn't quite hold up to the Belgian brews."

"Taste throws down a Flanders style flavor profile...rich malts, nutty yeast with a light brett and sourness. Fruits are still big and its more tart than sour unfortunately. Still though, not a bad effort for Sam Adams. The barrel character is very light and it needs more sourness, but the ABV is well integrated and there are some nice flavors to be found here. Id probably grab a Rodenbach Grand Cru over this at the similar price point, but I enjoyed the bottle well enough."

"O: I'm pretty sure this has a 'mere' 85 simply because it isn't that tart. To me, this is closer to a 90. It's far from the most tart, but it's balanced and delicate, a trait that's lacking in many 'Murican sours (of course, I love a big, brute-force sour monster too, don't get me wrong!) Given my experiences with 13th Hour Stout and New World Tripel last year, I think it's safe to say I generally enjoy SA's barrel-aged, funk-laden brews a whole lot."
""
""
"This deserves some credit for being decidedly funky. But the vinegar is a bit much, as is the sweetness. Regardless, it's interesting; apparently worth both trying and aging."
"I loved this fresh. Aged it's still delicious, but it loses something in the long run. The yeast dominates and hurts it a touch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Can this Stuff in a bomber for about 10 bucks and it is a descent sour ale. for that price you cant beat it compared to some of the other sour ales that can go for as much as 26 30 dollars a bomber. you wont regret this one! Need more characters so Im making filler words!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste of roasted malts, cherry, and other sour characters. The sourness of the taste is not explosive like some sours can be. That's what I liked this one better than other sour I have tried."

"Overall pretty smooth american Belgium ale with some tart characters. Kind of grows on you but I have had better representations of the style."
""
""
""
"The body is medium, and I'm surprised that the mouthfeel doesn't dry as quickly as I might expect. It's semi-dry most of the way before some wood and acidity throw that dryness into the finish. It has a bit of sharpness to it, but keeps in check."
"O: good variation of a belgian beer and a nice change of pace, but not really my cup of tea"
""
""
""
"O: For a series touting that it is aged in oak barrels, this beer doesn't taste ""oaky."" Also, it may not be what you expect when you buy a red beer, it is much sweeter than what I expected. That being said, it is a nice change to drink something like this. As I mentioned earlier, it almost drinks like a wine, which isn't a bad thing at all. It is fruity, and you don't really notice the 9% ABV. Definitely worth a shot and I would overall recommend it."
""
""
"O - not what I was expecting at all! When I saw this labeled as a ""red"" beer i was expcting a heavily malted ale. Was pleasantly surprised by the fruit favors as I tend to shy away from those types of beers. Not sure why but they just never sounded like they would be this darn good. Grateful for the experience, but not sure I could drink this in quantity. Definitely worth a try."
""

"Very dry and easy to take another sip. A good beer overall, just wish the flavor was as complex and fun as the aroma."
"Overall this beer exceeded my expectations. Pleasantly tart and dry."
""
"O: A superb beer and a great example of this brewery's genius. Reminiscent of an Oud Bruin, but with great oak flair. Everything was of the highest quality, and even the burps it produced were smooth and delicious. I bought mine at a bar, and even marked up at $15 for a 25.4 oz bottle it was a great deal. If you don't mind a beer with moderate sweetness and are ready to change your mind about Sam Adams as a brewery after trying their supermarket-available beers, then try this one out."

"Pours a clear, dark copper/brown color. 3/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, oak, sweet malt, hint of hops, yeast, slight citrus, and sourness. Fits the style of an American Wild Ale. Mouth feel is sour, sharp, and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, hint of hops, oak, slight citrus, sweet malt, hint of liquor, hint of alcohol, and sourness. Overall, great appearance, aroma, body, and blend. The complexity it vast, but the carbonation level is too high."

"O - my favorite Samuel Adams brew and its not like I haven't given them shots. I've had nearly 20 different styles but only found 2-3 really worth reviewing. This is a Samuel Adams ill buy every time I see it and that's a shock for me. But in regards to this good beer it's very tasty and not something that should be overlooked. Plus it's not like we have a lot of wild ales floating about here at home. This is one ill go out of my way to grab again. It's a favorite of mine."
"Overall: I do not think this is a beer I would ever seek out for personal enjoyment or for any reason other than snobbing over. That being said, I feel this is a very important ""notch in the belt"" for any aspiring beer snob. If it is available in your area and you have not had it I highly recommend it simply for the experience."

"Kind of tast like a wine'ish kinda beer , deffinatley can taste the alcohol but not over powering, light carbonation , easy to drink only thing I didn't like about it was the fact it didn't have as much of that beer taste than it did some sort of wine"
""
"D - An interesting brew... A bit of a mixed bag... The aroma is world class... The rest of the beer is intriguing, but no better than slightly above average... Another interesting offering from the Samuel Adams Barrel Room collection... Curious BAs will find this interesting enough, but I'm not sure it's something I would invest in again in the future..."
"Pours a deep clear reddish color with a thin head which quickly recedes to nothing. No lacing or no lines are left. The aroma is of dark tart cherries, that is a hint of oak and a little pepper. The taste follows suit, there is a dark tart cherry flavor up front to start, the middle gets a little watery and the end finishes with an oak taste. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly stingy. Overall it is a decent beer, the tart flavors are not as rounded out as i hoped."
""
""
""
"O - It is a good beer. Not exactly what I think of when described as ""Belgian", ""tart"" or ""toasted oak", but it IS good, and that's all that really matters, right? Strangely enough, going by the name, I find myself thinking ""Yeah, this is a decent red ale"". A good offering from Sam, I'd just advise changing the description on the bottle a little haha."

"Overall, its dryness and balsamic notes aren't as pronounced as the classic versions of Rodenbach- it does side with some of the more ""careful"" versions like Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge, Steenberg's Monks Cafe, and Bacchus. But without the authentic Belgian rusticity, we'll call Sam Adams' version a ""Flanders Red on training wheels""."
""
""
"Overall: Another great brew from Sam Adams! I would buy this one again."
"Nice bubbly mouth, though subtle. It's crispness brings the flavors to the forefront. Slightly tart at the onset, but with a sweet kick on the finish. Lightly drying from the oak. Vinous grapes, cherry, brown sugar. A little acidic on the back end, but this is a really mild sour. I liked it though. A decent one to covert the curious."

"O - Flavorful and dangerously drinkable beer. My wife and I both enjoyed this."

"Overall: coming into this, to be quite honest, I had no clue what to really expect. Upon first taste, it was actually an enjoyable experience. The wild fruits definitely balanced out the sour tart. Interesting, great sipping beer. Alcohol is barely noticeable. I may try again, but would be pretty stern with a friend when it came to recommending it. My girlfriend did not enjoy it so beware for those looking for a hoppy, bitter beer. Cheers!"

"(O)- This is ok, but a bit disappointing due to kind of a bland body overall. The fruit and oak is there, but just kind of muddled together."
""
"this is the last of the three barrel aged sam adams beers i bought the other day. this ""stony brook red"" has a really nice red color. the smell is sweet and dry. the flavor is also sweet and sourish. all three of these beer have had dry sweet wine characteristics but this one, to me, was the most close to a sherry. its really dry and sweet. this beer is a very interesting drink. i love the experimentation that has been going on in the beer world. and this barrel aged stony brook is right up there with some of the other good results the experiments have yielded."
"Sweet and wine-like...this is a fun and enjoyable beer. Clear and red in color, with no notable foam. The cork literally exploded out of the bottle. The aroma is of fruit, wood, and funk. Tart candies and Cabernet. Must and some subtle malt. Firm mouthfeel, lasting finish. This is a very enjoyable beer. Nice."
""
""
""
"Overall: tasty, easy to sip on, but I can see how someone would argue its a bit lacking. However, its still damn good and I enjoy it very much."

"O - This was good. I wonder how more age would affect it."

"I don't care much for Sam Adams, but this was actually pretty good. It's a hybrid of several types, but regardless, it's a good sipper. Nice ABV and it's pretty easy to drink. Sweet and sour/tart, but never over the top."
"Pours a faintly hazy orange brown with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of dark fruits, cherries, brown sugar, a bit of funk, some lactic, and a hint of balsamic. The flavor is sweeter than I anticipated but serviceable. Lots of dark pitted fruits with brown sugar and a fair amount of funk. Light citric tartness with a bit vinegar rounds out the flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet lightly acidic mouthfeel. This is a nice east drinking beer, but a bit on the sweet side for a wild ale. Tasty, but maybe we should label this as a gateway wild brew."

"More challenging than their New World Tripel and other big SA specialty brews, but for the funky, sour beer seeker, really lovely. For others, challenging at a minimum. Buyer beware!!"
""
""
"I am impressed with this series... Sam Adams is such a pioneer in this industry. To bring variety and affordability in a time when so many micro breweries are making super expensive and rare, hard to get beers... they are a refreshing go to brewery. I only paid $4.49 for this!!! Easy to get and affordable... we need more like this!"
""
"I really thought I'd like this more than I actually did. Glad I don't feel like I need to buy more bottles. An okay intro-to-Belgian red ale for those who have never had any Flemish ales yet. Better put, maybe a good intro-to-Belgians for those who have never had a Belgian beer yet."
""
""
"D: This was a nice Flanders red, but not in the top tier. The scent and taste were good but not terribly bold, complex, or delicate. The body was only ok also, but the finish was very smooth, so it was surprisingly easy to drink. Maybe age will help improve. Only average for the style fresh."
""
""
"Well done, engaging, and fairly complex. Not the best Flemish red I've had but unique and tasty. A surprisingly good sour from Sam, and a good value."
"Excellent nose and while the flavor was good is didn't live up to the aroma This isn't a sour beer. It's tart and has it's own complexities. A good price for the style of beer will make me buy alot more."
""
""
""

"Overall - Served at 50 F and was a little bozy and tart for me. However, a very good beer. A great American Belgian. Congratulations Sam!!"

"Along with their Tripel, Stony Brook Red is another Sam Adams Barrel Room Collection offering that holds its own against well-entrenched Belgian offerings. While not among their equals, it's quite tasty and worthy of praise."

"overall - fairly close to the Belgian standards."
""

"This pours a medium brown color with a decent, beige head. There is a decent scent of yeast and fruits. The taste is very Belgian with a complex mixture of citrus, other fruits, and yeast. The texture is quite nice and very this beer makes for very easy drinking. Very smooth and well made!"

"Strong B....85-86"
"Nice color and appearance. It tasted more like a barley wine but I could attribute that the the barrel aging. It wasnt what I expected it to be but it was a good beer. I was thining it would have more of a abbey style taste with a big sour punch but the punch was more of a oak aged flavor. The first sip brough to mind a real oaky wine flavor. i might try this again with some friends. I dont think it was meant to be served in a 14 oz. glass. A solid effort by sam, But be prepared it is real real boozy."
"Pours a deep, saturated mahogany hue. Mild carbonation yields a thin khaki head. Light, balanced tartness with a sneaky musky funkiness poking through. The base beer is a big, smooth amber ale - warm, toasted, and caramelly. Big, coarse, woody oak note on the finish that is a bit jarring at the beginning but is really quite pleasant when it's all said and done. Really smooth at 9% ABV. Don't expect a traditional Flanders Red. The sourness is pretty subdued, but there is plenty of complexity and the big maltiness and 9% ABV make it a nice sipper. A great value at $4.99/750mL. Enjoyable enough to convince me to try the other 2 beers in the barrel room series."
""
"Tart and sour flavors are on the lighter side. The taste, especially the aftertaste, has a medicinal, sweet-y, yes, throat lozenge quality. An interesting brew, and great to see another American brewer giving a swing at this style, but not something I'll be picking up again."
""
"Pretty impressed by this one. Not great, but tartness and funkiness are balanced with a lot of oak. I wish it were a tad less sweet, but otherwise solid effort."
""
"I liked this beer... Very drinkable as the tartness isn't overwhelming and the sweetness of the malt helps to cut the carbonation and make this a nice drink..."
"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light tart notes with hint of cherries and light oak notes. Taste is a low acidity mix between tart cherries with light oak notes and subtle vinous notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Easy drinking sour with some complexity."
"Beer is medium bodied, through and through, with modest carbonation, creating a smooth, slightly foamy mouthfeel. Finishes dry, with very little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
""
"I keep finding this beer on the shelf at a price way too cheap to pass on, so I keep buying it and drinking it. It has grown on me considerably. It reminds me of before-the-best-after-date Dissident. I am nudging the taste and overall scores up a little."
""
""
"Overall this was a pretty nice beer, good flavor and the alcohol was well disguised."
"Overall, this beer would make a great introduction to Belgian sours as all characteristics are subdued and smooth. This kind of reminded me of a Flanders red. A nice job by Sam Adams and a good value."
"O- Overall I think this beer is, well, average. It might be because I'm new to the whole ""sour"" beer, or it may just not just float my boat. Will I buy this beer again? Probably not, for the $10 it cost me, I could pick up a stout or something more enjoyable to me."
""
""
""
""

"Overall the Stony Brook Red was an excellent interpretation of a Flemish red ale. Great balance between the tart cherry flavor and the oak, vanilla, and funky Brett characteristics. I'm not the biggest fan of Sam Adam's regular lineup, but I've always (mostly) loved their Barrel Room Collection. This one is no exception, and in fact might be setting the new standard for the BRC. At $12 a bomber, you better believe I'll be picking up a few more of these guys!"
"The beer is copper hued with crimson highlights and a soft off-white head. The aroma offers oak, sour cherries, vinegar, red wine, yeast. Smells nice. The flavor is decent. A bit heavy and sweet for my liking, though the finish delivers sufficient tartness. Lots oak and a touch of vinegar. A heavy Flanders style brew. Better than I expected. I'd like to see more offerings like this from Samuel Adams."
""
"Solid. Great blend of the barrels in here. Could be just a touch more sour, but good flavor."
""
"Tart right up front, and a bit funky. I taste no hints of a barrel, but I get that it was wildly fermented. It transforms into something slightly sweet, with a nice malty finish. Moderate body, lip puckering, and a medium-low dose of carbonation. I probably wouldn't buy it again. Sad face."
""
""
"The beer pours a deep, rich looking muddy copper with a fluffy tan head that dissipates down to a thin blanketing quickly. The nose is fruity, with specific notes of bing cherries and prunes, and also slightly tart. There is a distinct acetone that lingers on my olfactory as well. The taste is surprising, as it hits with the initial sweet-tartness of an oud bruin, but finishes bitter, like a hoppy red ale. There is a great yeast presence and the beer is relatively balanced/drinkable with my simple dinner. The mouthfeel is a little off, but I can't place my finger on what I don't like. I would recommend letting it warm a touch to let the full flavor profile shine through. Overall, this is actually pretty tasty and an uncharacteristic beer to come from the standard Sam Adam's line-up. I enjoyed the big barrel saison as well. I'd like to see how this beer does after a year in time-out..."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish-brown color. Very bubbly - nice big head even with a light pour. Smell of sour cherries. I really wish the taste was more sour than it ended up being. It was only slightly tart, with a certain Belgian character coming through. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice after-dinner beer"
""
"Deep red-brown ale with a sudsy head. Aromas of cranberry, bread and spices. I can smell the oak barrel's influence as well. Tart berry and spices hit the palate first, followed by nutty whiskey and subtle vegetable flavors. The flavor is complex but a little underwhelming, this one's not as enjoyable as the barrel room stout."
""
"O - Very unique and super complex. Every sip left me guessing what was next. Sometimes I forget that Sam Adams is a real brewery because of their commercial appeal, but this beer is pretty amazing."
"O: not too shabby. it tries to be a Flanders Red but as a Wild Ale it gets good marks. nice tartness that doesn't overpower and good depth of flavor. It was nice to try this beer from Sam Adams but for the price I'd rather snag a Rodenbach."
""
"This one presents just like a typical Flanders with the woody backing to the sour cherries and mild funk with gentle acidity and vinegar tartness, a tiny wisp of lactic sour, but very little funk or swamp gas to it. (Which could potentially change with cellaring adjustment.) It also suffers from being about 15% too sweet IMHO. It's identifiable as an introductory-level (newbie accessible) American-made Flanders, but still a lot less raunchy and wild than the real McCoy from Belgium. If I see it again in the stores I know I'm going to be picking up another bottle or two to see what a year or so of basement aging does to improve yeast funk and tanginess levels. It's got the right amount of oak wood, acidity, and sourness, but needs some more dryness, funk, and wild yeast character. Give it a shot fresh if you prefer your sours woody yet still semi-sweet. If not, either give it a pass, or try to see what happens with cellaring it."
""
""
"OVERALL: Without question an exceptional ale; one which I'm glad Boston Beer Co. decided to make. Really tasty and a great achievement for the brewers. This is the type of ale that I hope they continue to brew for the Sam Adams line, maybe more wild ales or even a gueuze in the works? Why not, they've done just about everything else."
"The AWA is a tough, competitive category with plenty of amazing beers, so I have to rate accordingly. However, don't hesitate picking this one up."

"Not overly complex but an awesome attempt at a Flanders Red from Sam Adams. The sour factor is very light. The 9.0% abv is well masked. Would have loved for this to have more sour power with some heavier oak flavors. Excellent for the $11 price tag!"
"O - Wow, this beer has me delightfully surprised. Everything was great, maybe one of the most complex beers I've had. I will be purchasing more to cellar and I recommend you also follow suit."
""
"Pours reddish-brown with a thin white head that fades to a slight ring. Aromas of tart berries, oak, cinnamon, red wine vinegar, and a touch of funk. A little muddy. Taste consists of cranberry, raspberry, and cherry, oak, vinegar, and light funky yeast. Much like the nose, the flavors are muddy, not clean. Wish this was either more sour, or more funky, but this in-between mode isn't great. Decent mouthfeel, medium bodied with good carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Decent beer, I suppose, and I applaud SA for taking a risk, but I won't be re-visiting it."
"O - reminscent of a kriek lambic or Flanders red, the oak barrel adds a bit of additional complexity that makes for a pleasant pint."

"O: I'd call this ""Flanders LIght"" if i had to describe to to someone. Maybe an okay introduction to the style, but clearly not a standout."
""
""
"Overall: Not up there with the top beers of the style - too sweet and lacks funky complexity"
""
""
"The beer is clear Mohogany color. It has a light tan head with minimal retention. No lacing. The color looks almost completely red when held to natural sunlight. The nose is very wine like. Lots of sour grapes and cherries up front. Its also got a nice funkiness to it. Again very winy. Really big on the sour/tart cherries. This beer really reminds me of Kombucha. A little mono tone but delicious. Feels good on the palate. Its medium bodied and well carbonated. Sorta bubbly. A nice pick. A good pick to change things up a bit."
""
"The cork came out with a loud pop and plenty of smoke emerged from the bottle. Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours deep reddish brown with a small, somewhat quickly dissipating light tan head. There's a little bit of lacing left behind and some visible alcohol legs. I can see through the beer if I look through it from the top as opposed to the side of the glass. The beer smells like a good Flemish red. It has that tart cherry scent. I get some of that bready and sweet malt along with the oak. I can pick up some of that alcohol as well, but it's very faint. The taste follows the nose. The cherry tartness is up front, but it's balanced by the bready and mildly sweet malt with some of that oak flavor. There's some spice in there as well. The alcohol isn't that detectable in the taste. It's incredibly well-balanced. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is a little dry. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer that I would recommend to fans of this style."
"Every time Sam Adams comes up with a new line of beers, I've come to expect no more one well-done in the bunch. This one certainly hits that! Looking forward to the others, though."
""
""
"O -surprised and impressed with this one it was quite tart and sour with nice wood notes a nice Belgian Red imo"
""
""
"What an exceptional beer. Without a doubt, the best I've had this year. I honestly could do without the Special B and aromatic malt, and this would have been even better with some more residual sweetness. A well-balanced sweet/sour beer, re: Duchesse, is to die for, but as is, this is heavenly stuff. As it warms up and the carbonation simmers, it takes on a more enveloping mouthfeel and the malts come out a bit more. A beautiful, beautiful beer. Will definitely have to buy another couple bottles of this."
""
"Anyway, I will probably not buy this again because of the very high cost. It was good, a very interesting foray into barrel aging. The closest barrel-aged beer I've had to this was Petrus and that was quite different. However, it's not quite up my alley enough to warrant the very high cost of this beer."
"Pours deep brown with a tinge of red and a foamy off-white head that settles to about a half finger. Nose is tart cherries, some brandy like qualities, white grapes (surprisingly), slight vanilla and oak, plums, green apples and just a bit of caramel. The taste is less tart than the smell. Grapes, cherries, oak, brandy, pears and it finishes on notes of red wine. Sam Adams attempt at a sour is a definite win. I haven't had many really good sours in AZ but this is finally one and at $9 its not a bad deal. I just hope Plaza Liquors gets some more."
""
"Overall this was good. Not as tart as I would like to see."
""
""
"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pleasantly surprised by this one. BBC doesn't wow most of the time, but this is a very pleasant, very well made, enjoyable wild ale and well worth the $7.99 price tag."
"Overall – A fairly nice sour. Not mouth puckering like some, but it had a nice balance between sour and sweet/malty. While the Belgian sour is not really my style, I believe Sam does a nice job with this one. Give it a go."
"Overall - Between the three, I can't decide what one I enjoy most. This definitely will be bought over a more expensive lambric when it's not payday"
""
""
"Overall: Is this a wild ale or a Flemish red? Anyways, it tasted very good. Reasonably priced too @ $10 a bottle. Delicious and enjoyable."
"Pours brownish-red. A tad of cherry medicine aroma. Medium bodied. Decent drinkability. It seems to be an understated balanced out Flander's Red. Very woody in the finish. Not complex and not exceptionally interesting. Bottle found in a Maine bottle shop."
""
"This was awesome. It had a fantastic nose and flavor. It was fruit-forward and tart. It's simple but it has depth. I thoroughly enjoyed this. If I can find it again, I'll pick it up."
"O- Great beer and an easily accessible take on the style. If you have never tried a sour this would be a good one to start with. The 9.0% ABV is a little on the high side so keep that in mind if you decide you like it and want to finish the whole bottle by yourself."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Dark brown with a ruby hue, but not much of a head, and no real lacing. Nose is sweet. Flavor is bitter with a lightly sweet balance. Bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"A good beer to take to convert red wine drinkers. I'd like to give this a go with a good steak or traditional country French food."
"This is my second foray into the, as I'm now finding, criminally underrated Sam Adams Barrel Room Collection. Is the Samuel Adams name on the bottle making people underrate these? Anyway, Stony Brook Red pours out a deep red color with a small head. The aroma reveals layers of tart cherry, oak, vanilla, and a bit of vinegary funk. The flavor profile is similar to a Flanders Oud Bruin, with the tart cherry, grape, and funk taking center stage here. The toasted oak comes through on the late finish, bringing along it's buddy vanilla for a great aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's highly carbonated and very dry. The drinkability is also great. Another winner from the Barrel Room Collection. The oak on the finish really pulls everything together for me, it's integrated so well. At nine bucks for a 750ml, this is a steal."
""
""
"O= This is a solid sour. Actually a great beer concidering it's a Sam Adams. This in perticular isn't my favorite sour though. The cherries make it a little too sweet for me but I can see the potential in it. A flanders style red isn't my favorite sour style but this isn't half bad. I only paid 8.99 for the bottle and I am seriously concidering buying the rest of them. Sours are hard to find and usually way way way more expensive."
"Overall a decent attempt by Sam Adams that I must give them credit for. It's great to see such a large brewery taking the time to make a wild."
"I really enjoyed this , a very respectable wild ale, would buy this again if this became a year round / seasonal release. Drinks very easy,"
""
""
""
"This may not be the best or most complex sour I've ever tasted. But as far as the price, I don't think a better bargain on a barrel aged sour exists anywhere else in the world. I will definitely be buying this stuff again in the future."
""
"At $6.99 for a large bottle, this beer is a bargain. It is an excellent example of a Flemish Red Ale from a brewer many are quick to dismiss. Do not be afraid of this one. It's probably not sour enough to please die-hard fans of sour beers, but it's plenty sour to enjoy drinking and might be a nice way to gently introduce someone to the wonderful (and expensive) world of sours."
""
""
""
"O: I like acid so I like this, though others may not. It isn't terribly malty/hoppy, but fits the wild ale style well."

""
"O. I tried this on a whim, pretty tastey whim. And this is my first Sam Adams anything. Great job. If anything, would like a higher ABV."
"An excellent American 'Flemish' Red. Delicious. Kind of Liefmans-esque."
""
"O: Glad I tried it. Different, but tasty. A great ale to sit on the back porch listening to the rain with. Relaxing. If you're a lambic fan,this is a pleasing beginning to a fine sipper."
""
""
""
"Notes: A rather complex beer but very tasty lots of yummy sourness. Cheers."
"O- All in all, a complex and interesting beer. Tastes could mesh a little better, and may over some time in the cellar. I would definitely give this one another shot."
"O-it's a very drinkable beer. It's subtle. The flavors aren't strong but there's nothing wrong with it, no off flavors. A whole bottle is easily finished by one person. To be honest, much better than what I'd expect for a wild ale from Sam Adams."
"Overall: I really want to like this beer a lot but I can't. I mean don't hate it but I was expecting a lot more. I will tell everyone have a glass, but factoring in price your better off trying something more suit to your style than experimenting on this. If you don't give a Fcuk like me drink up...Salud!"

"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is of bready malt, barnyard yeast, cherry, woody and sour. Body is full, crisp and creamy. Taste is very sour, sweet malt, caramel, candy sugar, cherry, funky yeast, wood, lemon zest, herbal hops. Finish is long, tart and pleasant. Very complex, delicious brew."

"O: I was a little hesitant about this beer because I do not like sour beers in general. I was pleasantly surprised, as there was enough sweetness to balance out the sourness. I wouldn't seek out this beer, but I really enjoyed it. 4.0"

""
"Overall this was a surprisingly nice brew that I had no expectations for so I was pleased with the result. Who knew Sam Adams could make a decent sour. The nose was nicer than the overall flavor profile but still nice nonetheless. A very nice and affordable sour in the realm of increasingly expensive and hard to find beers of this style. Def recommended if you stumble across it (I think it's only available in Mass) ."

"750ml corked and caged bottle courtesy of Brett. Served in a tulip . Pours a burnt red hue that is closer to brown than red with a hazy clarity. The one and a half inch, cream-colored head gradually dissipates into a sudsy slick. Nose expresses tannins, vanilla notes and oak - there's also a vinegary tartness that intermingles with the other aromas. Taste follows nose - the flavors meld together nicely - tannic with some medicinal notes at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with lively carbonation and a slight astringency. I have to say that I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer although I would say that it is more reminiscent of a Flanders Oud Bruin than an American Wild if I had to guess. I'm sorry to hear that this beer is being discontinued."

"Overall a very tasty treat of a wild ale, if not a particularly wild one."
"O: Not a bad take on a Flemish Red from a big American Brewery."
"They were out of stock and are not planning to make it anytime soon. I was so diasppointed. I was able to grab a couple bottles at the beer store on my way home but what am I going to do after? If you know where to find some in the Boston area, please let me know."
"Mouthfeel is live and bubble with crisp medium body feel and just a bit drying in the finish. Overall, SA Stony Brook Red is a nice change of pace from the usual lineup of Sam Adams. Nothing crazy here but a solid wild ale with a nice subtle brett character. All for under $10... not a bad deal at all."
"o: I want to use the word approachable, but I don't mean it in a patronizing or dismissive sense. This balanced and deliciously quaffable. I'd love to have this again."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. I thought this beer was pretty good for what it was. It's definitely not trying to compete with the sourest of sour Krieks, but what tartness it does provide is welcomed. This beer reallyshows a greater complexity and 'skill' that the normal lineup of Sam Adams may not convey, and it balances the barrel nicely with the cherry tartness."
"poured into a tulip, amber color, small of white head, light carbonation. sweet and sticky well balanced by the sourness and oak. the oak is suble and enjoyable. the alchohol is atrong but not over bearing. me and hammer made easy work of this treat direct from the brewery tour."
"O - A good offering from the folks at Sam Adams."
"I'd hit a steak with this bad boy, like a cab sav of the beer world. Hats of to SA I'm impressed"
"Notes: Great to see Sam Adams releasing some of these experimental beers. I'm pretty indifferent toward this one though."
"O: The sourness balances the fruitiness very nicely. I would drink this again. It would go great with grilled fish."
"D- overall a nice wild ale. A bit overpriced and sour for my tastes but quite good for the style."
"Dr: High price, relatively high ABV, and good quality make this beer one to try but not to savor. I'd have it again, but I do wish the price was better."
"Overall, this is a cool beer. Received as a gift from my sister, well appreciated and I'd like to have this beer again!"
"Pours a hazy cranberry juice color with a small 1/2 inch white-red head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small spots of lacing slowly drip back down into the remaining beer. Smell is of sour berries, vinegar, and funk/must. A very mouthwatering smell. Taste is of sour berries, red wine/balsalmic vinegar, and the funk/must flavor that wild ales have. Very tasty and refreshing. This beer has good carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good wild ale and I like this much better than the American Kriek beer from the Barrel Room Collection I tried a few days ago."
"D/O: Very rich and thick. Drinkable but best when sipped slowly. Strong and balanced."
"i poured this beer into a snifter glass. it has a dark red body with not a lot of head to it, no lace either. The smell is funky of tart cherries and of toasted malt. The first sip is like wow, tart cherries threw the sip, then it a little bitterness on the back of the tongue. the mouth feel is very nice, has some carbonation. Overall i really like this beer and can't wait to try the other barrel room collection(they are sitting in my beer cupboard)."
"Pretty good for a wild ale. Not exactly what you would expect to get from Belgium, but this is good in its own right."
"The Stoney Brook Red was part of a three pack I bought up at the brewery last summer when I was there. The beer pours out as a really nice red color with a good amount of pinkish tan head. The smell of the beer isn't as funky as I was expecting it to be. There is some of the wild yeast aromas that come though but there are some fermented fruits and a malt aroma as well. The mouthfeel is bubbly and fairly active, It's lighter bodied than the color would make you think. The beer finishes a little dry but not really sour or overly tart like I was thinking it would. It was a pretty good beer."
"Love the idea of this. Feels like a funky and bitter flanders red, missing much of the fruit. A fun one to try, and priced right."
"I like! I like!"
"I'm pretty impressed with this one here. Here's to hoping the other two barrel room beers are just as good. Cheers."
"Drinkability is good. This is one of the best Sam Adams beers I've had to date. The 9% ABV is well masked and the overall beer is well done. I'd like to see them continue with similar projects. Worth picking up a bottle."
"Clear red with a dense beige head that recedes to a ring. The nose is surprisingly good! It's like an oxidized version of New Glarus fruit beer, with cherries, vanilla, vinegar and a surprisingly oxidized wine character. The palate has similar flavors, with the oxidized vinegar and wine being quite noticeable. However, it is still very good, with the cherries lending an appropriate brightness, and the vanilla is nice as well. Reasonably well-put together, this is a nice beer. Tannins are low, and the tartness is nice."
"Maybe I am missing something but with some great sour beers out there this is not my first choice."
"Mouthfeel is fine, some gentle carbonation reminding your palette of the slightly wine-like body and character of the beer. Dry and some slick sweetness leftover. Drinkability, with some caveats, is pretty good. First, the beer needs some time to loose some of it's edge after opening. It's too intense initially to really be all that enjoyable. Second, I don't find wild ales in general to be particularly high in terms of drinkability when I try to rate it objectively. This example became quite mellow and easy drinking after some time, but the sole glass I poured was more than enough for the night. Seal the bomber and save it for another deserving night."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, deep amber pour, red highlights, fizzy white head. The aroma is a mix or sweet and tart cherries with a dash of vinegar. The cherries are the main taste, mid-palate some vinegar, it finishes dry and tart. The beer is light and effervescent. For a sour it drinks pretty easy, IMO more of a flanders red. A little more sweetness than some other sours, but it works for me."
"I enjoyed the beer but it isn't exactly my cup of tea."
"Serving type: 22 oz. bottle"
"D: The sourness of this beer is a little too much for me, as I tend to prefer dry stouts or bitter DIPAs. Other than that though, it's a drinkable beer for 9%"
"Poured into a SA Perfect Pint, figured it was appropriate for this. Poured a pinkish amber body with frothy white head that builds quickly and fades almost immediately. Smells like cherries and apples with a tart vinegar twang, very earthy and yeasty, too. Taste is granny smith apple skin with dark fruits, horse blanket, and bready grains. Oak pulls through nicely, sweet and acidic but gets kind of overly funky in the aftertaste and an oddly bitter finish. Feels light in body and crisp due to high carbonation. Drinks easy, especially for a 9% beer. Flavorful and a good interpretation by Sam Adams, but not anywhere near as good as RR or other popular sours. Best out of the Barrel Room Collection, without a doubt, but I don't think I'll really seek this one out again. I might reconsider that if only to see what some age in the bottle does to it, however."
"D: Decent brew, but definitely not the style Sam Adams is known for, but its alright. Good fruit notes but not overly exciting."
"The body is medium with a lower level of carbonation and a fairly mild amount of sourness. The oak is there, but it's not particularly tannic. This is a good brew and a step in the right direction. Personally, I would love for Sam Adams to nail this style and get a bit more exposure for this type of brew. This is much better than I expected, to say the least."
"D: interesting, but not my favorite."
"750ml bottle purchased at McKinnon's, bottle number 850. Pours a translucent copper color with little to no head to speak of. Smells like sour fruit. Tastes brilliantly sour with lemon, grapefruit, and pithy notes. Medium bodied and effervescent. Dangerously drinkable for its size. Awesome."
"Stony Brook Red is a good attempt by Sam Adams but leaves me wanting more from it. The nose is very good but the taste overall is weak on most accounts. The drinkability is fairly high on this one, if you would want to drink a lot of it that is. This one isn't bad by any means; it just doesn't do it for me. Not for $10."
"Pours a thick, cream, three fingered head, slowly fades to a thin layer (should be poured slowly) and leaves a good lace. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Color is hazy amber. Tart fruit nose. Flavor is tart fruit and oak, the higher ABV is hidden. Clean, dry finish. Pricey at $11.95 for a caged and corked, black, 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"D - The sweetness and tartness really give this beer a decent range of flavors that you taste in the beer. The beer is overall really smooth and crisp, and fairly refreshing."
" i like the crazy, wild and sharp flavor's from the wild yeast addition but there's little else going on here which keeps the complexity down. a winner in the wild ale category."
"Bottle #3499. Thanks to Speakorspasm for sharing this. The aroma is a touch musty, like an old towel at first, but then it cleared up and let the cherries, vanilla and oak toast through. It's a bit muted for the strength of the beer though. It's definitely a sour beer, but the tang isn't that ripping. It reminds me a touch of the Odell Woodcut beers, and that's a good thing. There's a dry, tart fruity undertone to the beer I really like with a very light earthy farm character. Check this out if you can."
"A solid wild ale, a little one noted and unrefined. But a good effort from a great brewery."
"3.5 D: Not bad, but nothing special either. I'd prefer this to either be sweeter and more fruity or more sour. It's in the middle and seems a bit muddled. A lot of my scores were borderline, so this is a bit better than my rating suggests."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Boston Beer's attempt at wild ales. It was pleasant, slightly tart, with nice oak notes. Nothing too special but solid and I might have it again sometime."
"D- this is a poor man's Supplication, but its still pretty damn good. I'd love to see Sam Adams release more sours...they did a good job here"
"My favorite of the Barrel Room Collection."
"I'm pretty happy with this one, I'd say it's my favorite by far from the three BRC brews. Very much along the lines of an above average flanders red."
"The 9.00%abv is not really detected. The taste is good, but thin. Oddly, of the Barrel Room Collection, this is probably the flavor that I would like best (except for the mustiness). The thin-ness of it though, just kils it for me."
"taste is actually a bit disappointing. I have been wanting to try this one for a while. a little tart, but not too much, nice smooth oak, hint of cherries and hat is all. Seems like Boston just tried to dip a foot in the sour category and see what it was all about. This has a lot of potential, and so does the brewery in this style... that is obvious in the taste, but the stopped short to try harder to appease the masses so they could say, Hey this sour isnt bad... taste is meh."
"D- If I wanted sangria... seriously though, not bad, it just didn't impress me much. The 9.0 abv was well hidden."
"I enjoy this beer a little now, but I'm not a huge fan. I am glad that I had the opportunity to try a bottle of it."
"A beer that is not over the top sour, but really balanced between the sour, oak, and fruits. This is just excellent. Well done Sam Adams, something I highly recommend."
"Overall, it's pretty good and would work well as a digestif in the evening before getting it on. I wouldn't seek it out, but a nice move for Sam."
"Tartness is more reserved in the taste than the aroma. Lazy, dull toffee, plum and nutmeg settle on the palatte before being cast aside by a sharp tart companion. Becomes fairly monotone as it warms and not unlike Sangria and nutmeg."
"M/D- Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation on this is moderate. nice mouthfeel and the drinkability is nice. would have liked a little more funk and sourness to this though."
"Part I of the SA Barrel Room Odyssey. Get some. It pours a straight clear garnet topped by over a finger of ecru foam. An agglutination of foam in the center lets me know the laser etch is workin' just fine. The nose comprises dark, tart berries, sour cherries, a touch of vinegar, dark wheat, oak, and a scraping of brett. The taste follows, upping the oak ante, as well as that of the brett and sour notes, and tossing in a pinch of salt for good measure. The body is a sturdy medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a rather dry finish. Not bad, overall, though not something to drink regularly."
"D - I like this one a lot. My favorite of the 3 Barrel Room Collection beers. Nice fruity and sour flavors with just a bit of funk. The oakiness is a bit on the high side for my tastes - just too strong in the flavor and seems to diminish some of the other flavors in the process. Overall quite enjoyable. I think I will definitely have this one again before they are gone."
"Drinkability is good. This is a solid Flemish red overall. Don't listen to the haters."
"Poured a beautiful dark reddish maple, almost like an oude bruin. Nice cream colored head that left no lace. Vanilla, aged wood, touch of tannins, leather, and sour cherries are present in the aroma and taste. Very nicely balanced with an emphasis on the lactic tartness. Prunes, hint of figs, and cherries, a different but great combination. I think this is the best beer Sam Adams has ever put out. Bravo, I shall find this again."
"D: A decent enough sour with a really nice nose, but the flavor is sort of bland. Still, a good one to give a try and something unexpected from Sam Adams."
"Taste starts with the same full tartness, slightly sweet in the middle, then goes back to the tart for the close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, with drinkability being okay. Tart and cherry make the experience kind of one-sided, would want more malt character for balance."
"Drinkability is pretty good, especially considering according to the bottle this is 9%. Would make a good introduction to sour beers/ales, though for $9 a bottle there are probably better examples available."
"D: I will say it did hide the ABV well. The bottle itself was probably the best part of this beer. Really nice looking. It was easy to drink but I don't think I would get another bottle."
"Clear coppery amber, reddish hue, with a quickly dissipating beige head that left a thin collar and smattering of bubbles coating the surface of the beer. A bit of spotty lace. Tart, fruity aroma, toffee, tobacco, leafy, earthy. Mild alcohol, cherry, and acetic acid. The flavour was similar to the aroma, but with a bit more acidic character and citrus bitterness as well. Berry tartness, caramel, alcohol in the finish. Fruity and earthy. Medium bodied, average carbonation, nice texture. Pretty enjoyable and easy drinking."
"This was a really drinkable brew to me I easily could have a second glass. A quality beer well worth the try"
"Overall a pretty tasty strong red turned wild. I had it fresh and it was just a big red ale, so I gave it some time to wild up before reviewing and it seems to have gotten a lot better. The wild tastes are starting to come through now. This is probably the only one worth it from the SA Barrel Room collection."
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"A really great beer. I was very surprised by it really. All the flavors work very well together."
"Stony Brook was a pleasant surprise. It comes off as more of an introduction to Flanders Red Ales than an American Wild Ale. Just enough tartness and funk to keep things interesting, but not too much to scare away newbies. If you tried La Folie and thought it was too sour for your taste, give this one a go."
"The body was a little lacking. But not bad. It's a pretty drinkable beer. Again, not a huge fan of sour type beers but this one was definitely worth the price."
"I've been quite happy with the whole Barrel Room Series, making a good name again for local Brew superhouse, Sam Adams. I snagged this one at the local Foodmaster (yep, a supermarket with liquor license...decent beer & wine and only getting better...and carpeted!). I wondered, what kind of red ale it might be, like a bland Irish red...wondered what the waters of Hyde Park might have spawned beneath the cork & cage...A hearty pop of the cork later released an aroma that I initially took for spoilt, as the sour funk escaped. The pour was a wet dark red with a fluffy off-white head of 2 fingers that soon sunk down to little, though some lace stuck around throughout. The aroma definitely pushes the funky farmhouse thing, evoking cherry & ripened green apples. This holds true with the flavor: sweet & tart, cherry-rose hip-apple with some hefe-like yeast & rich malts all work together so that not one thing overpowers. A bit lacking in body and mouthfeel for something akin to a Belgian farm ale, but still mighty fine."
"Huge thanks goes out to Knifestyles for this one! I had been interested in some of SA's barrel aged brews since I heard about them, and was very happy to see this one in the box as an extra. Pours a dark amber color with a very large tan head which was long-lasting and left some sparse lacing on the glass. First aromas I get are tart apple skins, a bit of lemon, some cherry, and a musty, basement-like quality as it warms. Taste is somewhat tart, barrel flavors are there, wet oak, etc. The base beer is solidly noticeable, much like a strong brown ale, with some caramel and breadiness and a touch of tart cherries added to it, yet the cherries aren't overly predominate. A little bit of cheesy funkiness is in the depths of this, but would really like to have more acidity and more cherry flavor. Becomes a bit too sweet and boozy as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium-full, average carbonation. A decent barrel aged wild ale, but nothing to write home about. That description is pretty much standard for all BBC brews. Not bad, and glad I could try it!"
"I like sour ales so I really like this. Try it if you can."
"The Barrel Room Collection from Sam Adams continues to be a pleasant surprise."
"Pours a clear amber red color with a fizzy yellowish tan head more than a finger strong that receeds back almost immediately to just a thin lace on top of the beer. Nose initially seems to be typical belgian phenols but gives way to more. Aromas of belgian style yeast meets spices akin to clove, minor amount of banana and then increasingly more tartness, funk, fruit and then an ever so slight bit of oaky subtleness as it warms. Taste is tart but includes some musty notes, fruity apple and pear, clove, slight bit of banana and finishes slightly bitter and quite drying. With the drying finish comes some of the oak and woodsy characteristics in the taste. Feel of this beer is light with moderately high carbonation. Very drinkable and the alcohol is hidden quite well for 9%."
"The taste has that nice combination of sweetness, tartness, ABV, and cherry flavors. There is a touch more vinegar to this beer than I would have liked, and for that I'm keeping the beer out of the A range, but it really is refreshing, sweetish, cherry tartness, sweet malts, floral, with a slight mouth puckering acerbic punch. The wild yeastiness brings the vinegary flavors to the fore. I think the yeast needs to be tamed a bit. Flemish reds are my favorite style, and this beer certainly doesn't detract from my preferences. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability: A very interesting and complex wild ale. I could have several glasses. One of the most interesting Sam Adams out there. It is worth the price. The sweetness offsets the tartness perfectly. I think I may get another bottle just to age."
"sam adams continues to impress me. the fact they could put out such a solid brew at such large quantities is astounding. recommended, but i think this should be qualified as a flemish red ale, but wild ale works too considering the brett character."
"An interesting beer. Not completely classic, it still has that classic Sam Adams ""we're pushing the envelope but don't want to go to far as to offend"" taste. I hate saying that, but with the exception of Utopias or one off draft beers it's true. Anyway... still a very good beer. Kudos to them for pushing into this 750ml barrel room collection. Cool idea. Let's see what you guys can do next."
"overall, im impressed. and the price tag is well justified in this brew. hope its not too limited of a release and I can get it regularly."
"Very good beer. Nice level of tartness while still being ""soft"" enough to really enjoy. Probably my favorite Sam Adams beer."
"Strong sourness to the initial taste, similar to Belgian gueuze. This has many of the elements a strong cider, including a green apple element. No notable hop. Low carbonation with a full body. Too rich to drink regularly."
"D: A nice, solid wild ale, perfectly enjoyable right now, but not something I'll go out of my way to seek out again. Not as complex as some of the European counterparts, but a nice take by Boston Beer Company."
"D: can't get enough."
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer, but one I'll only reach for on occasion. I love funky flavors, and I wish that came through a little bit stronger."
"D-Not at all what I expected. The notion that its a red throws me off. I expected something more malty. Its interesting. Worth a try, but I don't think I will have it again."
"Drinkability: I can foresee comparing this to an IPA as being similar to comparing a dessert wine to a zinfandel. I definitely had no problem finishing the 750 mL bottle, but it's not something that I would want to drink on a regular basis... well, maybe not quite that, cuz I would never drink a 750 of a dessert wine, but you get the point."
"This is certainly funky, but after having some of Russian Rivers sours (Temptation, Consecration, etc) this seems a bit tame/mellow. Still good and a nice intro to the style, this certainly makes it more drinkable. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, good for the style."
"This is really not what I was expecting, but I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely the winner for me out of the 3 recently released barrel room beers."
"750ml bottle $8.99, it looks kind of like a flanders red, reddsih color, translucent, short ring of bubbles around the glass. The smell is quite interesting off the bat, a bit of funk, sour fruit, reminds me of the dissident. The flavor doesn't seem to match up with the smell for me, its a little tart but mostly mild with a bit of woodiness, needs more sourness, more funk and less alcohol."
"Overall,"
"D: This is my first real experience with this style and am pleasantly surprised! Not filling, nicely blended the balance between tart/sour and malt is excellent. Alcohol is undetectable. I'm looking forward to exploring more of this style."
"Pours a deep ruby with a slight swirl of head, hint of lacing. A good balanced carbonation follows. Nose has an immediate strong fruit (cherry, raisin) aroma that isn't overpowering. Taste definitely hides the ABV, tart but not fake-sweet llike some other cherry beers. Very tasty, refreshing, not heavy, I wish this was available everywhere!"
"Two Barrels down, one to go, impressed with this series from Sam Adams."
"The new Sam Adams Barrel Room Select series beers just hit the shelves in Boston today, and I have to say that they come in some very handsome bottles. I ended up getting this and the American Kriek, probably will go back for the Tripel on another day. Poured in to my new Lindeman's Lambic flute, the color is of rust, which is interesting. I worked up about two fingers of heading, which fizzed away, and faded quickly. It definitely smells like a wild beer. I get plenty of fruit, some degree of funk, smells sort of like sparkling wine. Taste has some tart cherry, apple skin, barnyard funk, and little touches of the oak here and there. It feels pretty light on the palate, with a good dose of carbonation, furthering it's similarity to a sparkling wine. Alcohol is evident in the taste, but it does nothing to impair the drinkability. Not a bad beer at all here from Sam Adams. The price tag isn't too bad, the bottle is nice, and the liquid within it is as well. I think I might blend myself a glass of this and the Kriek at some point tonight. Cheers to Sam Adams for experimenting."
"Definitely looking forward to picking up some more of this."
"Amazing how well the 9% alcohol is hidden. Sam Adams has uncorked a surprising and delicious beer. I hope the rest of the barrel collection is this good. I will definitely be back to the brewery before this one sells out. Reminds me of Consecration a bit and honestly, if I had to pick between the two, I'd take this (never thought I'd say that!)"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. This ol' girl handles her alcohol content so well, you could put an entire bottle down the hatch and not even know it was alcoholic. Be careful."
"D - Very flavorful and easy to drink. This would make a nice dessert beer."
