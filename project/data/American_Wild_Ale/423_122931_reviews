"Served in an Oversized Wine glass"
"Corked and caged 750 ml bottle from Tipples. Pours deep reddish orange color with a nice fluffy off white head. Aroma is muted with some metallic and cardboard notes, oak, some light sour funk, sweet fruit and a vinous presence. Flavor follows as a beautiful combination of sweet fruit, red wine, sour lacto, dry oak. Wow this is really nice. No sign of the whiskey here, but I am OK with that. The wine barrel and sour notes really take over. Medium heavy body, medium plus carbonation. Really nice beer overall."
"I thought Love Child No. 3 was a fantasticly interesting and complex wild ale, but Love Child No. 4 seemed lacked some of flavor and seemed rather one-dimensional."

"first sour beer Ive had that kicked me in tha back of the throat with sour that was an interesting experience and it made me crave more!"

"Pours a clear amber brown with hints of pink.  Bubbly light tan head that faded fairly quickly into a medium collar.  Pretty good lacing and decent legs.  Aroma is tart dark cherry, cranberry and black raspberry; behind that there's some earthy woodiness.  When I swirl the glass, the vinous woodiness really comes alive.  Taste follows aroma with some wine barrel resin.  Little bit of funk but the brett is majorly covered up by the sour lacto at this point in the aging process. Taste is also extremely tart and reminds me of a very sour jolly rancher.  Very fruity, but quite sour.  Medium carbonation and body."

"Absolutely  delish. The Brett character is awesome"
""
"Great beer."
"The pour itself gets aromas flowing quickly to my nose and getting my taste buds watering.  Pours to a murky honey brown tone of swamp water of a body.  Head is a biscuity golden brown that fades to a skim quickly.  No lace is left behind.  nose is fruit resin sweetness mixed with dusty tartness that dances well together.  Wow is all my brain can get out as I take first sip.  A wonderfully brutal attack of sour quickly takes over the tongue.  Astringent and full sour feel swarms the mouth with each sip.  You get lemon peel and high quality boutique vinegar in the flavor along with a dry dusting of sour candy coating.  This is a truely sour beer and not for the faint at heart.  Mouthfeel is a real pucker up."

"Overall: Really good, complex wild ale. Well worth picking up, but wouldn't recommend to someone new to sours as this one is pretty intense."

"Verdict: A very nice American Wild Ale from Boulevard, and a nice interplay between the wine and bourbon barrels, both getting their turn to shine. Nicely sour but not cripplingly so and the cherry and fruit profile fits in well with the barrel treatments."

"This beer is awesome and anyone who tells you otherwise just doesn't like wild beers."

"It was more carbonated than I was expecting but, it settled down as it sat in the glass.  Great color - orange/brown.  It was tarter than I was expecting.  To me, it tasted better the colder it got."

"O:  Very good wild ale.  The wine-barrel aging adds a subtle bit of complexity; I can't really detect much that the whiskey-barrel aging  adds, but again, i personally won't complain about that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy pink-orange with thin fizzy offwhite colored head, thin ring left behind with a few dots trailing down the glass. Smell: flanders red + more... oaky with some soft melon and caramel in the back, overlaid with cherry, overripe stone fruit, grapeskin. Hints of acetic brett and cued whiskey. Taste: raspberry, lime, tart grapes, lactic!; then into peach skin, woody and herbal; apple cider vinegar and a tiny bit of goat cheese in the finish and a residual booze feeling left on the lips. This is very good, but I'd like to see the funk meter and sour meter swap values."

""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied with low carbonation and a tart fruit aftertaste. This is a very good Sour / Wild Ale, and is drinking great right now."
""
""
""
"The natural procession of the ale lands it at a severely dry finish, decorated with fruit skins, salt brine, peppery warmth and oak-aged vinegar to close. Its overall sourness is irresistible as it provokes the sweat glands and tightens the cheeks with each and every sip."
""
"Note: Batch #L14077-2"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Boulevard hits a home run with this vastly simple yet delicious barrel aged sour ale. The nose is sour and somewhat acidic with a vinegar like aroma but it keeps a natural cherry tone. The flavor is simple as well but mixes the vanilla of the barrel and tart cherry to create a great tasting ale. There are tones of cocoa butter, with creaminess, and a move towards a Flemish Sour as you continue to drink. Not too tart or sour this is easy and flavorful."

"number 4 is by far the best one of these that i have had. i didnt even love the other ones all that much, but this is elite level beer, with the whiskey being way more prominent than i recall in the others, and the red malt sweetness toned down along with the almost flemish red vinegar side of the sourness. love the lighter body and the big bubbles, its different being so whiskey forward but so light feeling, nothing else compared. it also has a real strong abv, but drinks like its 5%, so unique in that regard too. i pick up cherry and raspberry fruitiness in nose and taste, but also a real heavy lacto thing that only comes from wine barrels and time going by. mature as they get, although i would still like to cellar a bottle or two. we all admired its depth, its grain neutral perspective, and its apparent noncommittal nature as far as direction is concerned. to the beat of its own drum this one walks, and i dig that about it. leagues better than its predecessors, i want more."

"A solid and complex sour. Mostly cherry and apricot wine flavor. Minimal bourbon barrel presence."
""
""
""
""
"When I think of a great sour, this is exactly what comes to mind.  Not only is it a great sour beer but it is probably the best tasting beer I had tried up to this point.  I love the blending of old and new beers, the complexities that Brettanomyces and Lactobacillus add to the flavor and of course the subtle smoothness that only barrel-aging can accomplish.  I just don't see how it could get any better."

"O- Love this beer. Haven't had much from Boulevard, but this is impressive. Could definitely go for more love children."
""
""
"A very solid sour- nice tart flavors with some real depth to them, some nice citrusy and floral aromas, and a nice clean pour with a pure white head. No real funk to this beer, just clean, tart flavors with some nice dimensionality added by the wood. Very nice."
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
"D:  Highly drinkable at 9%. Aggressively sour and subtly sweet. After tasting this I went to the store to purchase another bottle for a year or so down the road. Absolutely delicious."

"I am giving this beer a higher rating than I would based off of my friend's rating who loves Sours.  I, personnally don't like them but bought this based off of the label not knowing it was a sour.  Anyways, as far as sours go it is well done.  It is def sour and has some fruity wine notes to it with nice head retention and mouth feel."
""
""
"Overall - This is a good beer. These crazy wild ales aren't necessarily my style, but they are good to drink from time to time to break completely out of the mold. It is certainly unlike anything most have ever drank before in their lives. Condor recommended and approved."
""
""
""
"Overall - Complex at first, but becomes very strong on the sour apple flavor as I keep drinking it."

"This is my first sour I've ever tried. I can't really describe it. Its like a palate overload. I think that its awesome though...maybe..  The wine barrel aging definitely shines through more than the whiskey barrel aging. Reminds me of champagne"
""

"Drink- I enjoyed this one a lot. Can see why this cracked the Top 250. I will admit I am a bit of a Blvd. Fan boy though."

"O-Overall an incredible beer. I'm really starting to enjoy this beer style especially since I got this one for $10."
""
""
"Overall (4.5), this is probably my favorite of the series thus far. The wine foeder aging imparted a wonderful dry fruity characteristic that really separated it from the previous iterations, as delicious as they were. If this is how Boulevard is going to put their new foeders to use, I'm downright giddy to see what else they come out with in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Huge price tag on this one, and I've heard lots of accolades about it.  I do love sours, and it is one of my favourite styles.  Given that, I was expecting more from Love Child No. 4.  Not as complex as many other sours, and I’m really predominately getting sour with some barrel quality.  It could have so much more depth and character.  However, it’s a great sour sipper.  Will give it 8.5 out of 10.  Got it in Asheville and drank it in Ontario, August 20th, 2014."

"The carbonation and sourness keep the alcohol and sweet malt in check, though they do creep up a bit. Not as drinkable as the Flanders Reds of Belgium, but still pretty nice."

"O – Without a doubt, the champagne of beers. The artful and meticulous construction is readily apparent, and the flavors are delicious. In spite of a 9% ABV, I've never finished 750 mL of craft beer so quickly by myself. I'm definitely biased toward beer, but I would take a bottle of this Kansas City beer over Dom Perignon any day (bearing in mind I've only tried the '96). Expect cherries with hints of honey and oak delivered with the cleanest mouthfeel this style has to offer. An excellent beer to share with friends, but I'd rather keep every drop for myself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is definitely a Boulevard Belgian-style beer, the great color, perfect level of carbonation, and unique “Boulevard-ness.” I’m not amazed with the flavors but respect the beer on its merits. It’s very well-constructed, and I believe they accomplished what they are trying to achieve."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding. Complex and well integrated. Fantastic sour character."
""
""
"An interesting beer. Tough to drink a lot of it, tried to share with my wife and in-laws, who all hated it as expected. They said it would make a great salad dressing. I am intrigued by this."
"D: This was a fantastic sour, with great complexity to the scent and taste. Wine and bourbon barrels mixed perfectly. The body was fitting, and the alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink for a wild. But it should be sipped and savored. Could age well I'm sure, but doesn't need it. Top quality brew."
""
""
""
"A real mother pucker here."

"O: A wow factor from the first sip but a little too sour after half way through the glass. Would like a little bit more sweetness to balance out the sour. Overall very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's nice and complex, but I didn't get much of the bourbon. Still great though"
""
""
""
""
"If you love sours, this is perfectly refreshing, great and light. Was recommended locally here but heard its hard to find. Highly recommend if you are a sour lover. I am not a wine fan and tend to stay away from brews aged in wine barrels but it was not ""winey"" at all."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I think this is very enjoyable for the style. It doesn't try to squash the sour, which is nice, but it doesn't let it go wild either. Maybe I am trying to say it's a well-balanced wild ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy red amber pour with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Very sour and tart aroma. Intensely sour and tart taste upfront of dark fruits/cherries. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Can taste the oak as the beer warms. Finishes very tart and juicy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The depth of flavor was unbelievable. A lot of things were happening and all of them were good."
""
""
""
""
"I want to keep two or three of these in the closet for a few years to see what happens. I'd imagine this will age very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber to slightly reddish hued with a fair amount of cloudiness. Just a trace of beige foam covers about a third of the top. Aroma of very tart cherries and horse blanket. The taste is extremely mouth puckering tartness. Initially it's highly acidic and tart cherries. The mouth is highly carbonated and highly acidic. Highly refreshing and yet a beer that you have to be ready for an overpowering burst of tartness."
""
""
""
""
"The intense sour and acidic bite crosses that line and makes it a bit harsh for me. The Smokestack Series is always one of my favorites around, and I always try to pick up the new Love Child when it comes out. Though they are never among my favorites of the style or series."
"The beer pours a very bubbly off white head that dissipates very quickly and leaves a little bit of lacing. The beer itself is a clear grapefruit red with some light brown notes. The beer smell has strong sour acidic funk notes. The funk is pretty strong and dominates most of the notes but some other notes consist of oak and light fruit with cinnamon. The beer taste is similar to the smell. The taste is very interesting. The beer starts off with the strong acidic taste but transitions to a much sweeter and sugary taste. The taste has the same cinnamon notes and fruit notes that accompany that acidic taste. The oak is not as noticeable in the taste but does have a slight presence as well as a hint of whiskey. Additionally, the fruitiness from the red wine barrel also comes out well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side with a lot of carbonation and goes down smooth. Overall, one of the better and lighter wild ales that I've had."
"This is delicious. Harmony throughout the bottle and the glass, with all the elements playing off each other. Also, this beer is 9% ABV? It's dangerously well hidden."
""

"the overall since love child 2 I was hooked, my mouth would love me and my wallet would cry for I now was a sours kind of person. A friend had a beer tasting most of them were turned of but i could get enough. I had strong hype on love child no. 4 and it did not disappoint. If you like sours this is a must try I recommend one or two since there not cheap. I am grateful for nabbing one but I do believe I will try and get one to age some."
"750 ml bottle. Pours orange with tall, long-lasting, foamy white head and nice lacing. Nose is of caramel malt, funky yeast, ripe fruit and spices. Body is full and very tangy. Taste is very sour, funky, tart, fruity. Finish is long and sour. There should be a note on the label to put syrup in."

"Only a parent can love The Love Child #4...you must like sour beers to enjoy this one. For me....not so much....probably my least favorite from Boulevard. The beer pour a cloudy amber with not head and no lace. The scent had bourbon and sour mash. The taste was very potent and tart similar to lemonhead candy. There were hints of bourbon and white wine. The mouthfeel was medium in body with little carbonation. Overall not a beer for me....glad to have tried it....but that's about it."

"O: While not much to look at, the great taste more than makes up for it. Basically a sweet and sour AWA with better than most barrel notes. That's what really sets it apart for me, the barrel treatment. Imagine La Folie or Supplication but with a bolder wine barrel profile (wine, oak, vanilla) and some toasted bourbon barrels blended in."

"Overall it's not bad but the beer lack a lot of malt depth, but perhaps that's it's angle? Does come off like a good solid wild beer though."
"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted June 2014. Purchased from Whole Foods in North Austin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was hoping for a different complexity with this one. I was hopeful with the different barrels and all it would maybe stray away from just straight sour but I was wrong. lots of good character but nothing that makes it stand out from the hundreds of other wine barrel sours. I thought about going back to cellar another bottle but at the price I will pass."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best sours/ American Wild Ales I have had.  The smell, taste, and mouthfeel are perfect.  Very smooth sour.  You don't even notice the 9 abv.  The price for the 750 ml bottle os quite high between 16.99 to 19.99 is quite high.  That being said if you like sour beers you should try this at least once.  Best Boulevard beer I've had"

"Just getting into sours, so I don't have much to go by, but I thought this was pretty impressive. The alcohol was very hidden, maybe just a small burn as you swallow. Very lemony with some berry notes as well. I couldn't taste the bourbon too much, but I could definitely get some of the wine barrel it was aged in. Overall, I think this was very tasty and I'm glad I picked up 3 bottles since it is very reasonably priced."
""
"Overall: This is a very nice, complex Wild Ale. Too bad I never was able to try the earlier iterations of Love Child, but I will certainly keep an eye out for future ones."
