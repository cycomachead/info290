"O: This met my expectations. I have to put ddg ahead of this just on complexity but this is a solid beer worth seeking out. I'd like to try this fresh but a little age has been solid. Russian River delivers again."

"Bottle, batch 002. Clear piss yellow pour with a hint of white head. Enticing lemon zest and funk aromas. Tart, crisp, and clean with all kinds of lemon zest, sour vinous & grapefruit, barnyard, and funk notes. Absolutely freakin’ delicious..."

"One of the last bottles shared at Hunahpu’s Day 2014, poured into souvenir taster. Hazy yellow with a white head that quickly disappears. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is basement must, citrus, especially lemon, tart sour grapes, vinegar, wood, and leather. Taste is a puckering sourness with citrus and vinegar notes, followed by some mellowing wood bitterness and earthy elements. A touch of citrus sweetness. Light-plus body, surprisingly creamy/thick but not overly so, just enough to coat the tongue, lively carbonation, long sour finish."

"Overall: One of the best American spontaneously fermented beers I've had and probably the closest tasting to an actual lambic (though still not quite the same). Well worth seeking out."

"One of the best beers I've had, without a doubt. Amazing how many different fruit and other aromas/flavors come out of this beer from the combination of bacteria and yeasts, without actually having any fruit. Pretty much every aspect of it was fantastic, down to the perfect mouth feel. It's not often outside of a big stout/barleywine that I say to myself ""wow this beer has a great mouth feel!"" but it was there, all right."
""
""
"Sours are not my favorite. I almost feel unqualified to rate them, but to me this one fits right into the RR lineup. People hold it in higher regard for some reason that is beyond my palate, but it's absolutely worth drinking if you are into the style."

"Bottle batch 5.  Pours a hazy orange yellow with fizzy white head.  Aroma is funky barn and grassy hops.  Flavor is light tart and funky hay, dry finish, well done."
""
""
"Initially an incredible oak smell, very noticeable after previous sour ale consumed. Just amazing tart and sour funky goodness."

"Pours with very little head. Hazy, light yellow in color. Smells fresh and tart. Fruity, flowery, and hints of vanilla. Wow, this is sour. What I get after that initial pucker is fresh citrus, earthiness, and a smooth vanilla oak aftertaste. This is one of the most flavorful beers I've ever had. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly. The natural fermentation yields a perfect feel. Overall I'm really impressed with this beer and I'm not a huge fan of sours. This is one of the best I've ever had."

"A clear pale yellow, pouring into the glass you can tell this thing is nose and tongue stingly tart. Tastes bright citrus- grapefruit and lemon with crisp clean acidity. Tastes like the sour candies of your childhood. So complex and tart and the body on it is great. Just enough to hold up the acidity. Right up there with the most sour beers I’ve ever had and definitely one of the best I’ve had."

"O- a very good sour. I find picking out flavors in sours are difficult but the taste and smell and everything about it are outstanding."
""
""
"Single finger fizzy white head on a slightly hazy pale golden body. Aroma of Chardonnay, white grapes, lemon zest, funk, tropical fruit and nicely forbodes the level of tartness the taste has in store. The first sip has the salivary glands contracting and it's so tart initially it is almost bad but it's just enough to be perfect. As you get used to it the flavors pop with lemon, white wine, fruits, Chardonnay and Granny Smith sour apples. Oak is light. It's only knock for me is it lacks a little complexity likely because it is so tart the other flavors are lost. Crisp, light body with the sourness drying you out quite a bit. Another great sour from RR. Lives up to the hype and beyond."

"A very big thanks to Mulder1010 for this and it pours a beautiful golden hazy hue with a one finger wispy head and a touch of lacing,the smell is so inviting its oak,green apples,musty funk and white grapes,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with spritzy carbonation and on taste it's just like a fine lambic you would find in Belgium with sour Granny Smith apples,oak,white grapes and finished with a nice sour tartness and overall it's a nice wild ale but Temptation is still my favourite cheers."

"O- This is one of the most sour beers I've had and if you're looking for something that delivers in the pucker department seek this one out. It is also somewhat too sour for me in my tastes. It's missing a bit of the subtlety that I got from Supplication. Still an amazing beer and if you want to test the limits of sour seek it out."

"I've been waiting to try this beer for almost 2 years now. What differentiates it from other Wild Ales I've tried is the mouth puckering sourness that it delivers. As with other RR sours, it was very well balanced and complex. This one's a winner."

"M: Light bodied. Not as prickly on the tongue as I was expecting."
""
""
"Batch #6 (I think) bottle from trade, dated 9/11/13. Pours to my tulip a light yellow golden color with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Aroma is nice tart lemon, yeast funk, some pleasant citrus-like sweetness, light vinegar (very light on that note), apricots, lots of lacto acidity. Flavor is a nicely balanced sweet and sour lemon, lots of lactic tartness, dry oak, dry dusty Geuze-like qualities yet a nice sweet citrus character to balance. Some wine like qualities with Sauvignon blanc type of acidity. Light bodied with high carbonation and a crisp finish. This is really nice, but I can’t ever see paying $18 for a small bottle myself. Differentiating sour beers is tough I guess. With that said no doubt I would drink this again. Yum."

"I knew other sours made by RR were already world-class, but this really took it home for me. This is not an easy beer to make, and to produce something that is so complex and yet so brightly textured and balanced when working with wild bacterial strains is nothing short of magic. For those who have had any doubt on the direction that wild beers are taking in America, try this one and be astonished. This is by far the leader of many beautiful things to come. I hope to get a bottle soon and compare some notes, and see how this changes over time."

"This is one of the loveliest beers I have seen in the glass. It looks like champagne. The nose is subtle and slightly funky -- not the strongest part of the beer. Beatification has a deep lemon juiciness that is incredible. It is followed by a well-balanced pucker that doesn't have you reaching for the Tums. The finish is nice and astringent, which is the perfect lead in to the the next sip. Up there with Supplication as the best from Russian River."

"Re-review: 375ml bottle of b6, bottled in 9/13/2013, opened today, 2/13/2014 at Voodoo Brewery. Poured into a Voodoo snifter. 5 months old. In contrast to the 19 month old Beat b5, this one is a lot more complex and slightly less sour. More lemon, citrus, oak, white pepper in the nose as well as on the palate. Acidity is still there, at 7/10 while b5 was more of a 9/10. Just enough to make this incredibly mouthpuckering but without overcoming all the different complexities in the flavour. Highly recommend drinking fresh within a year for the full bouquet of flavours to enjoy."

"O: I was not the least bit disapointed by this beer with the high hopes that I had for it. The sour aspect of this beer is very unique for an American beer."

"finally! this is one beer i have wanted to try more than any other, it was my number one whale, and now it has been enjoyed. at long last, and it did not disappoint. hazy blonde in color without a ton of head, but some clearish white fizz holds on for a few minutes and the beer is visibly bubbly, even though not much head ever accumulates. looks like a gueuze. the nose is awesome, just awesome, not overly sour as say consecration, but it definitely brings a pucker for me. lots of musty wood too, wine citrus overtones and a vinegar hit on the back end. i taste grain first, which really surprises me, and its more musty than sour. sanctification has a certain acidity not found here, but the sour element is very similar. the finish is long, even though its really dry, i taste it for miles. furthermore, i get this harvest time straw or hay element, grassy, but not from hops, its wheated all the way through, and while being sour, is also so much more in terms of yeast. its beautiful beer really. bright carbonation and a body short of medium, it drinks really easy because its not so acidic. not as interesting or layered as some of the other sours, but a great example of a wild ale, one of the best i can remember. comes up just short of the hype, but thats still a remarkable achievement with this one."

"A well made beer but the tartness for me was a bit too aggressive. However, recently have Batch 5, I much preferred the restrained manner and less tart qualities in the beer."

"Pours a very light straw color. It is lighter than blonde and just barely lemon-tinted in the glass with a nice bright white head. Plenty of carbonation. The smell is complex. There is some tartness/acid scent but very funky to my nose. I get more funk than anything. Like preserved lemons maybe. The taste is sour on the front end but bright in the tartness. This tastes like a lemon sour patch kid to me. The sour is balanced so well and doesn't finish acetic. You get a bit of the wood and the sourness really smoothes out as this warms. I really enjoy lemons, so this beer really hits the spot. It's just this side of sour to not be completely thirst quenching, which is good because it's not like anybody has a big enough stash to throw back a few of these. Probably as balanced and as well made as any sour I've had. Slightly ahead of Cantillon Gueuze for me in terms of bright lemony lambic."

""
""
""
""
"had a batch 3 just last week and it turned much sourer than this fresh batch. both versions extremely good. love it"
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Hits with a big tart, slightly acetic lemony twang that carries through all the way to mid-palate. Some underripe red cherry and lemon candy hit in the middle. Barnyard, wet hay, a touch of leather, vanilla and some oak. Sticks the finish. Intensely tart and lemony with a great lingering dryness. Like every RR sour I've had, the mouthfeel is impeccable. This is world class."

"Poured a bright golden yellow, nice two finger head with a somewhat aggressive pour. Smell is very sour, citrusy, lemon, oak. The taste is very sour, with a lot of lemon. Perhaps some oak, grass and pepper? on the backend, very dry, as well. Creamy mouthfeel with bubbles that coat the tongue and keep the tartness around for a while. If you like really sour beers, this is a great one."

"Beatification is Russian River's 100% spontaneously fermented sour that is made in homage to some of the great Lambic producer's of Belgium; Cantillion, Drie Fontenien, etc. The finished product is extremely complex and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is unmistakably tart, with a lemony-orange hop character. Dry and peppery, with a tart sourness that pops on the palate. Incredible."
""

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a tart green apple aftertaste, and is extremely drinkable. Finishes dry. I went through a lot of trouble to get this beer, and may need to go through the trouble again, as this beer is definitely worth it."

"I have been getting really into sours the past few years. It's an exciting time to be doing so since there are more and more options popping up and many of them are truly delicious. Beatification is among the very best I have had. It definitely is one of the most intense sours out there. Although the flavor is extreme, this is incredibly well balanced and pleasurable to drink. A true delight."

"Maybe the closest to a really good Gueuze I can think of coming out of America. I love Supplication and Consecration and this is a refreshing change to straight spontaneous ferment flavors. Sourness dominates but lots of other great flavors beyond that."
""
""
""
"O: A serious contender for the most sour beer I've ever had. Not far from drinking lemon juice. Honestly, surprisingly pleasant. Not a lot of funk to this one, just straight-up bracing sourness. I expected more funkiness due to the brett and the almost 2-year old bottle. I think the sourness just obliterates anything else. I actually prefer this sort of sour. It's quite tasty and refreshing but drinkability does suffer due to the extreme sourness. Not exactly a sesssionable brew - but that's not the point of course."

"Overall this is a prime example of the mastery Vinnie possesses. A work of balance, very puckering but not overly so. Less funky than most traditional gueuzes but where it lacks funk it makes up in other nuances that make the beer just as divine if not more unique. Which I believe is the intention."

"My friend in San Francisco broke one of these out as my introduction to sours. I was blown away. This is a sour that is truly sour without any overtones of fruitiness. It finishes leaving you wanting more and more and more. Impossible to drink quickly because after the first sip you know you have come across something special. This is my current favorite beer, if you have a chance to taste any of the Russian River sours try this one first, it will blow your mind."

"This poure out as a hazy golden color with a pretty decent white hea on top. The lacing was thin but the retention held up pretty well. The smell is strong as hell, lots of powerful sour notes on top of some subtle vinegar. Very acidic aromas. The taste follows the nose. I nearly had tears in my eyes from how sour this was. The flavors of violent oak aging with Brett and vinegar all come together in this beer. The mouthfeel is light bodied, nicely carbonated and leaves me with a salavating pucker after each sip. Overall this is probably one of the most sour things I've ever had. It's brutal and not something I would ever drink a lot of. Still it fits the style and is sure to please anyone who seeks these type of beers."

"O - Great beer. One of the best I've had and every bit as good as Supplication."
"Overall- Incredible! I liked Supplication more, but never the less, this is awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Beatification is a fantastic geuze (yes, I consider this a geuze, not an American wild ale) and is one of the few American sours that I think will stand up well to its Belgian counterparts. I would love to see how this one develops over time."

"Bottle. Deep hazy golden like the tipical Cantillon. Minimal head though. Aroma is barnyard, brett and leather but also very fruity (mango, oranges and apricot). Very wild and expressive. Taste is citrusy tart, but not very dry. It reminds me of a lemon pie with candied zests. Lemon is puckering but sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Slight musty feel. It sure ain't a perfect beer but it taste goddamn good. It feels almost like a pure lambic and is definitly one step ahead from the regular american wild. I slightly prefer Temptation to this one, but it deifnitly hit the spot in its category."
""
"O: Beautiful aroma, tasty, and good drinkability which is limited mostly by the level of sourness."
""
"Overall. An awesome brew. Very sour and really delicious. Enjoying it immensely!"
""

"I wish this was easier to acquire, but well worth trading for. Certainly at the top of my list of favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome stuff."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very bright, lemony blend. I would have liked more funk but this is still good. I like Consecration better, though."
""
""
""
"overall this is an excellent beer, I love the sour, but wish i could taste past it. i would definitely trade for it again."
""
""
"Cost: $15 for a 375ml bottle."
""
"Amazing. ""Tangy"" has never seemed a more apt adjective. Had high expectations and was not at all disappointed. The sort of beer that renders conventional aroma and flavour nouns largely obsolete as meaningful descriptors of character."
""
"Overall: This is a really sour, really good beer. It may be slightly one dimensional, but it's really good at what it aims to do. I really enjoyed this and will search out more in the future."

"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head, but doesn't last long. Aroma is full of tart citrus like lemon zest and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of green apple and oak. Flavor is so full and complex and overwhelmingly sour, somewhat to it's detriment. I think I enjoy a well blended sour like Temptation to unblended. I enjoy the wild fermentation process to get these amazingly complex beers but the sourness somewhat detracts from what it is your drinking. Flavor is like strong lemon mixed with touches of green apple like the nose suggests but extremely sour, not much funk, it's a nice and fresh sour. Mouthfeel is great, low carbonation probably helps with the high acidity in this beer. Overall great beer for being unblended, glad I got to try it, definitely had to rest the tastebuds after this one."
"O: Wow, what can I say?  Looks like pee, smell is good but Ive had better, but then you take the first sip and bam!  Just pure, unadulterated, sour bliss.  My favorite of the RR sours, and the most sour beer I have had to date.  I'd write more but I have to get over to the trade forum to post as ISO: Beat ; FT: first born son."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer however I think I enjoy the balance of the other RR sours to this one. I still have one for the cellar so I am hoping that the funk comes up a bit and gives it more balance."
""
"Overall, this beer was worth the hype. Big thanks to my buddy Josh for getting this for me as a wedding gift. Major beer karma comin your way! This beer did it all without trying to do too much. Just amazing"
"O - Having had all the other RR offerings, I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I got a beer that had enough complexity to keep a smile on my face, and enough lactic sourness to burn a hole through ones stomach. Not particularly balanced, but intense and a fantastic example of what American wilds can be! Would love to try this with a bit more age on it."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy golden color. Smells like a grapefruit tart. When I tasted this it reminded me when I was kid and I like to buy these atomic sour candies. When you bite into it it bites back with a scourge of sourness throughout. That is the best description for this brew and I like it! Really sour, tart, lemon, and just awesome."
"5.0 D: A couple categories were borderline with a higher score, so hence a 5.0 here. This is the first RR sour that has truly impressed me since I first had Tempation. Solid all around."
"375mL b2 courtesy of MrChopin. I’ve been debating about upping the score from 4.3 to 4.4 seeing that I dream of this beer on an almost constant basis. This, my third time trying the beer, has confirmed that it is time. Beatification b2 is so drying and so wildy complex with spicy cedar, drying oak, lemon/lime/orange, leather, peaches, apricots...it is an all encompassing sour experience that is never acedic, never citric. Just spot on perfection. My notes for this say, ""It’s like the world ended and I was resurrected in paradise."" Later on into the night my notes will say ""HOLY SHIT."" 10/26/2010 9/4/9/5/18=4.5"
"O- I can see why people rave about this beer, but for the effort involved I’d rather just drink Boon Mariage Parfait. Although Beat is a better brew, it’s just barely so. 4"
""
""
""
"O- this is one of the absolute best beers I've ever had, and completely worth the price tag and cost from shipping from Cali. If you're a fan of sours and you've never had this...well, what the hell are you waiting for?!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably one of the most pungent and interesting sours that I've had to date."
""
""
"O: For what this took to get I'm a bit disappointed. It just tasted a bit average for me. The aggressive sour is impressive, but the rest of the beer doesn't entirely back it up."
""
""
""
""
"Nice and light on the body with good carbonation. Overall this one is great. Wonderfully drinkable."
"This is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall, this is a real treat; one I'd love to have more of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - All three of these were really good. My Batch #2 was definitely the most sour, Batch #3 was probably my favorite since it was the most balanced and Batch #5 just tasted a little raw compared to the other two. This was a seriously delicious test."
""
"Overall: My favorite Russian River sour. Its just a seriously delicious sour beer that packs a hardcore sour punch. Its also one of the top American Wild Ales that I have been privilaged to try."
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Russian River really knocked it out of the park with this one. I can't imagine a sour beer getting much better than this. I can't recommend it enough."
"Beatification pours a crystal clear golden yellow. There's maybe a finger's worth of white foam crowning the beer, and it disappears quickly and quietly. The nose has a good bit of acidity to it. It's very citric, with some bright lemon poking through. There's also a good bit of funk, some earthiness and also pineapple/tropical fruits. The flavor follows suit, displaying the full potential of wild yeast/bacteria. The tartness is perfect, bold and attention grabbing without turning the beer into vinegar. A brief flash of lemon opens the beer nicely, before a tiny bit of oak and some earthy and fruity funk come in and fill the mid palate. The acidity comes back in for a lingering finish. The body is just a little bit full, and the carbonation a little bit lifeless, and combined they're enough to make mouthfeel just feel... off. Despite one or two minor quibbles, Beatification is a fantastic sour beer. It's managed to not only live up to all the community generated hype, but all the anticipation I had for it personally after getting to try only an ounce or two at a tasting a few years ago. I'm glad I have a couple more bottles tucked away in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is perfect. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, a damn nice wild that I was excited to try, and would definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is quite sour, but that's pretty much it. Nothing too complex and am confused why this is considered a top wild from RR. Have had a few others from them and this just seems to lack any depth their other offerings had. Glad I got to finally try it, but wouldn't really seek it out."
""
"O. Their wild ales are just ridiculous. Amazing spring beer."
""
"Taste, wow, immediately reminds me why this is my favorite of the Russian -tion beers. And then it makes me pontificate whether I like this more than framboise for a cure or pty. Yup, that good. Body is light, taste, sour power is heavy. Keeps the brett aspect down, lets the other germs dominate. Never approaches anything that could be considered vinegar-esque. Oak notes are mild. Its all about orange type citrus notes, dry and earthy hyper drive sour."
""
"So glad I finally got a chance to try Beatification. This beer blew me away as much as any Cantillon I've ever had."
"Overall: For the style this is a good beer but for me I find it hard to drink and could not see myself finishing a whole bottle. Not a fan of the style in general"
""
"O - Another great sour from Russian River. I prefer Supplication and Consecration over this one."
""
""
""
"O- This was an awesome beer, probably one of the best I've had. The taste and aroma are right up there with some of the best sours including the Cantillons. I definitely enjoyed this a lot more then the Supplication I had earlier, a lot more funk, more citrusy, and more overall flavor etc.. Definitely a must try if you are into sours. Wish the brewery was on the East Coast."
"this beer (as well as any other RR beer ive had) definatly lives up to all the hype. some very nice funk and intense sour citrus makes this a winner, right up there with cantillion IMO."
"O: Fantastic beer. It's mega sour and super delicious. This is a true standout for wild ale fans. It deserves every bit of praise that it gets. Fantastic."
"Overall, very glad to have had the opportunity to try this one. Sour beers are quite foreign to me and gems like these make me excited to try more."
"O: Simply put, amazing. One of the best beers I have ever had hands down. Great flavor and extremely tart."
""
"This is like sour concentrate. It's like alchemy, but with sour flavor. In a word, this is masterful. One of the best beers I've had from Russian River, and that is really saying something."
"I'm glad I got to try this. It's worth all the hype and it would likely age incredibly well. Definitely a top showing from an already top level brewery. Incredible stuff to be had. Too bad I don't have more."
""
""
"O : Such a great sour, really hard to complain about any aspect but still isn't quite on par with some of the big boys...darn close though. Only knock is as it warms it becomes a tad too acidic for my tastes. Love this sour though and cannot wait for the next bottle!"
""
""
""
"O- if you like sour and funk this beer is for you. Possibly the second most sour beer I have had next to Riserva 2010."
"O: This is really brilliant stuff, particularly if you're in the mood for a palate scraping sour. Highly recommended, and I think RR has finally caught up to Belgium. Depends on if you're in the mood for a 'rounded sour' or a bracing one."
"D - Hits the nail on the head while staying refined. Love it."
""
""
""
"Pours with a great funky, earthy, hay & lemon smell. Rich golden color, somewhat hazy. Very tart on the tongue with earthy, leathery undertones. Not at all astringent, but rather finished crisp and cleanly acidic. Excellent beer."
""
"Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, dry, bubbly and extremely lingering on the tongue. If you're looking for an intensely sour beer that packs a punch you won't soon forget, this is the one. I've been waiting to try this for a couple years and it's lived up to the expectations."
"O: very delicious beer. Wish it were easier and cheaper for RR to make."
"This is a pretty special one for #BOTG 62. Pretty hard to find, thanks to Kevin Harvest for his generosity here. RR corked and caged bottle, popped bottle, and poured slowly into my JK Farmhouse glass. Pours a really cloudy golden color, some white, tight bubbles in the head. It looks like a sour! It actually resembles a Gueuze in a lot of ways. Smell- sour green apples, citrus, earthy funk! I get some eastern asia tropical fruits (like a star fruit)- very tart aroma. Also, some vinegar aroma. So many things in common with a good gueuze. Taste- oh my god, puckering sour. Its the sour you get from biting right into a green apple (unripened) and gnawing on the skin. There is a sugary tartness on my teeth. Also, I get some sour patch kids sourness too. Definite vinegar present on the end, it works well with the sourness, not a detractor at all. This is an A+ sour. One of the best I've ever had for sure."
""
"O: Acidic, interesting, sour, and perhaps a touch overrated. Still, a well-made beer that deserves your attention. I would have another."
"D - Very drinkable. The sourness and funky flavors are so strong, but at the same time the beer feels very balanced. I really like the wild yeast flavors."
""
"D - I see where it gets its high marks."
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is not very complex but still a excellent beer from Vinny and RR"
""
"Pours a slightly murky yellow with a beige head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, funky, earthy, and woody. Taste is the same with an awesome mouth puckering sourness. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an amazing beer with fantastic aromas and flavors."
"Overall not a Lot of complexity IMO. Very one note sour. Sour lemony citrus. "
"Great job Vin. Hell, I even drank the sediment."
"The drinkability on this is nuts. I could down these all the time. Perfect summer beer: complex, light, and refreshing. Each sip finishes with this pleasant tartness that just makes me want to keep drinking. More, please!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is like nothing else, the difference between the smell and the taste is something else. Would be interesting to drink a sanctification right next to it. Awesome beer but for $15 bucks a pop I'll be trading it more than drinking it."
"This is the best American Wild Ale I've had (sans fruit). Just. Fucking. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really sour and good, maybe worth the effort to get it though."
""
""
"O - This is a remarkably good AWA. It makes me think of a young gueuze blend more than any non-fruited AWA I've had. For a style that strives to be as good as something out of Belgium, RR has done it here. I find it to be slightly less layered and complex than the best gueuze I've had, but not by much."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome. Given the PITA that this ended up being for me to acquire, my hopes had really been built up. But unlike so many previous experiences with a similar backstory, it lived up to my expectations easily. Bottles of Beat would absolutely be a permanent fixture in my fridge if that was possible!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It's good, but didnt blow me away. I can see what the fuss was about though and very glad I have another bottle at home."
"Really good -- reminded me a bit of Temptation but much more sour and intense. Had a hard time picking up on any barrel characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is a light yellow with tremendous carbonation. It smells like sweet acetone sourness. The taste doesn't disappoint at all with intense sourness. The beer is incredibly drying and has a dank aftertaste that lingers. It definitely lives up to the hype with it's sourness... whoa. Tasty beer and I would compare it to a bottle of cantillon any day."
"O: I love this one. The closest thing I can compare this to is Temptation, but this one packs more punch and sourness and a bit more complex as well. My favorite sour to date."
""
"O - A fantastic sour! But then again, I wouldn't expect anything else from Russian River."
""
"O: definitely one of the most sour beers I've had in a while and was glad to revisit this monster again. Another RR success."
"Overall - Really pleasant sour. Easily the best from RR and definitely one of the best American Wilds out there. Compared to a true Belgian lambic, though, it's not up with the best. Lacks a bit of complexity and definitely missing the funk that I crave. I'm being picky, though. This is delicious and a worthy celebration beer."
"Awesome beer, this has actually turned me on to sours."
"O: Delicious beer that borders on a gueuze IMO. If the funk wasn't so restrained in the backbround I'd say this wasn't a wild ale, but very good none the less."
""
"Enjoyed a bottle at the brewery. Pours a golden, clear yellow. tastes very sour with notes of apples and other fruits. A little lemony as well. This makes your mouth pucker. really good stuff. this brewery's wild ales are rocking my world. I might have to see if try have another bottle before leaving town."
"O- The hype is well deserved. Grab as many as you can, while you can!"
"Easily my favorite of all the Russian River sours I've sampled to date. This one has a very bright citrusy profile I love. Hands down one sour I'd drink on a regular basis if I could."
""
""
"Beautiful. Complex. This has some flavors I've never had in a sour beer (cherry, strawberry) that I've enjoyed. I want to try it again and again to pick out the other flavors hidden inside."
"This is a light bodied brew with a lively amount of carbonation that is not over done. It is light and lively in the feel with a brutal dryness and acidity to it. This is really a fantastic brew that nearly borders on being too much. I have waiting a very long time to try this and it has met my expectations quite well. The nose on this is unreal and while the flavor is deep and complex, it is a harsh bugger that is not for the faint of heart. I guess this goes without saying, wild ale fans, this is a must-try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first experience of the ""Sonambic"". Awesome."
""
"Interesting beer, not complex but an impressive showcase of the flavors it does have. I imagine it being served ice cold accompanying some delicious fresh seafood. Out of that context maybe it's more of a curiosity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a hazy straw color with a moderate white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is fantastic, sour, oak, funk and citrus all blend fantastically, the oak really stands out and it has the funk smell of a Belgian lambic much more than your average American wild. Flavor is very sour and acidic initially, but is very complex. There's a great amount of oak and funkiness to this as well and it has some qualities that remind me of Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze. It comes off somewhere between a wild and a gueuze. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coats your mouth very nicely. Overall, this is really a fantastic American wild that may come closest to the Belgian style it's modeled after of any American beer I've had. I'm a big fan and glad to have finally gotten a chance to try this after all this time."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was an amazing sour; probably my favorite RR beer to date. All batches of this were very good, btu Batch 3 is unreal right now. Highly recommended, definitely looking for more bottles of this one."
""
""
"Overall this a phenomenal wild. I would describe the experience as an erection for the taste buds."
""
"O - Another amazing Russian River Wild Ale, as if there was any doubt. While Supplication remains my favorite, this was the one I was most excited to try, and it certainly met my expectations!"
""
""
"Bottle of b5 poured into -tion glass. The pour is hazy yellow with fizzy appearance. Minimal head present, no lacing. The aroma is heavenly. Notes of lactic acid pair with candied tangerine, tart cherries, waves of oak, and a touch of lemon zest. The taste is quite a journey starting with candied fruits, mainly citrus. A bit of oak and funk comes through next as things quickly head towards the intensely sour side of the spectrum. The finish leaves a lingering tartness on the tongue which leaves you hanging for the next sip. The mouthfeel is effevescent and the body is light. Overall, this is not only a very approachable sour with great balance, but it is damn tastey and well rounded. The hype train surrounds this one for a reason. This is a must try for anyone who enjoys sour beers."
""
""
"O - What a true delight. This beer has made me so happy, I just can't explain it. I will savor it every chance I get."
""
"O-A wonderful beer, spot on with the sour and it meshes excellently with the lemon and grassy notes."
"O: Very good, way different than the Wild Ales I've had before"
"Overall this was pure awesomeness. My favorite sour from RR and one of my favorite beers overall. I can't to see what some more age does to these beasts."
""
"This truly has sour power, perhaps one of the most sour beers I've had. But wait it has balance too! Right off the bat lactic sourness hits you, then a very grungy earthy quality to the taste, with grass and hay. Citrus and lemon lift, more sour. The finish is puckering. Lots of that russian river pedigree from there great oak barrels. I suppose we could call that terrior. Scrubbing bubbles sourness, DRY, lingering lactic finish, just amazing. One of the few beers I've had that is worth the hype, 'nough said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure it's the best sour I've ever had, but it's definitely a great one and something unlike most American Wild Ales. Perfect sourness level. The underlying components still shine through and create a great experience. Very excited to have a few more to age."
"Verdict: My words don't do this beer justice, it's truly unbelievable and the hype and hysteria is most certainly deserved. This is quite possibly Russian River's best sour offering and with an already impressive lineup of sour beer, it really is saying something. Whether you call it a Gueuze or an American Wild Ale, this is a must try at all costs for any sour lover."
""
""
"Beatification is a gueuze treading the same path as Cantillon & Drie Fonteinen, yet Vinnie and the Russian River crew demonstrate their own (masterful) Americanized interpretation of the style with this brew. A landmark American sour, showcasing what's possible in the style when you combine creativity with world-class brewing & blending talent. Ball's in your court, Belgium!"
"After the yeast. More musty notes emerge. More basement and less farm. Pungent and potent as all hell. White pepper notes emerge. Grapefruit skin. White grape skin and tannin. Assloads of tannic wood. Still acidic but a tad more lush and creamy. Dusty and gravely. Out-freaking-standing! Thanks Mark!"
""
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable. I compared this side-by-side with Sanctification and found it much more complex, sour, and balanced. Slightly disappointing, since I can find Sanctification much more easily. I guess you really need to let nature do its work without intervening to create a thing of beauty. Get it if and while you can."
""
""
""
"Phenomenal. Easily the best American wild ale I've had, topping even Cable Car."
"O: An excellent beer. Almost as good as American sour beers get. However, at the price point (even directly from RR, which only offers 375 mL bottles), it's not worth quite the hype that it gets. Just keep in mind that - if you can find them - Cantillon and 3F gueuzes are actually cheaper per volume. Heck, a Cuvee Renee is 1/3 the price and is comparable quality (though some may disagree)! If you get the chance, try this beer. Just don't lose an arm and a leg for it. It is not a spiritual experience."
""
""
"O - Usually, I don't find myself wanting much more than 10-12oz of most sours but I could have sapped back on 3 of these easily. SO refreshing, SO crisp, SO clean, and such a nice bone drying finish that kept me wanting more. I'm told and assuming age will make this beer better as it usually does this style, but I really couldn't imagine where it could have improved or how it could have been better. Admittedly, I'm not new to the style but new to appreciating it and finally feeling confident in my ability to critique or review sours properly. Great freaking stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I drank my second of my six bottles I acquired yesterday at RR. All I have to say is that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and plan on getting it as often as I can."
""
"Poured with a finger of foamy white head. Cloudy straw-colored body, and the head dissipated quickly with no lacing on the glass. Smelled SOUR! Vinegery brett all throughout the intense aroma. Some citus as well. Tasted as I expected from the smell- citrusy sour and tangy. Excellent flavor that lingers for a while. Lots of zip in the mouthfeel, fairly lightweight, and very fitting for the taste. Overall, an excellent wild ale, but extremely sour, so definitely not for everyone. Gotta grab a few bottles to take home..."

"appearance was just like the other batches i've tried, a murky orange. smell was super sour and tart in the nose with some floral kicks to it. taste was also extremely sour and sweet tart with some floral notes. the beer has a really nice feel to it. not prickly but close to it. this is a really solid beer, very balanced and extremely drinkable for such a sour beer. i found that i liked this batch better than batch 4, but not as much as batch 5."

"O- Amazing beer, very impressed, love the acidity, vinegar, sour apple, easy drinkability, puckering, one of if not the best sour I have ever had."

"Batch 4. So glad I'm finally getting to try this. Pours a slightly hazy, bright gold color with a medium white head that goes down quickly. Scent is funky with nice lemon aromas. There is also a bit of sweat aroma in the nose as well. Lovely wild yeast scents and citrus with just the right amount of funk. Taste is very oaky at first with intense lemon and sharp, bitter funk from the wild yeast. A bit of cheese as well. Nice blend of lemon, funk, and sour. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Puckering. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is the first time I've had this beer, and RR has yet to disappoint. I'm not regretting waiting in line for 3 hours for a few bottles of this."

"Overall: A tasty sour. Well done. Very drinkable."

"O: One of the toughest RR sours to track down, but definitely worth it. This is the gold standard for tart and sourness, though I would not go as far as saying this is drinkable. It is definitely enjoyable, but should be savored."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff. Less complex and funky than it's predecessors, but I look forward to seeing what it does with age. 4.5"
""
"Ph1: this is a completely different beer. The nose is sweet and floral, with lots of honey, caramel, pear, lilac and cinnamon. On the palate, it’s a bit overcarbonated, exploding into bubbles that make the brew hard to taste. Same in the flavor, though: lilac, honey, caramel, pear. Compared to later Beatifications, this is lighter, more delicate, sweeter and more floral, with none of the aggressive tartness of the others. I like how different it is. Redemption is the base beer here, which makes sense."
""

"Like batch 2, this is pretty hugely sour, but not as intensely so. Prominently lactic with some lime rind and citrusy acidity as well. Mild tannins and the lactic acid really brings to mind unripened stone fruit (yellow freestone peaches, nectarines). The funk level is tempered by the sourness, but grass, and straw are quite prominent. Mildly cheesy as well. Drying on the finish with lingering lactic acid, some oak tannins (that lend a chewiness), this beer is crisply carbonated. Highly sour, this is pretty excellent 4.5/4.5/4/4.5/4.5"

"Overall: This is one of the most puckering and blistering sour wilds I have had - I absolutely love it. It reminds me of an incredibly tart gueuze."
"O: Just crazy good. This could be the best american wild. Gueuze-like. So pleased to have tried."
"Overall – The highlight of this crazy day for me. After having so many good beers (read BA Cuir, Zwanze 2011, Lou Pepe Kriek, 007, PvW Eclipse, BA Decedance, and Blåbær) this was the stand out. While 007 was somewhat “similar”, it was more balanced. This was just a in your face mouth puckering sour. I was hoping I would hate this so I didn’t have to try and find more, but alas, that was not the case. One of my favorite beers. I can’t wait to get more of this. Thanks again so much to Alex for sharing this."
"One of the most complex American beers I have ever tasted. Pineapple, lemon juice, brett, lactic acid, no real oak flavor. Deep fruit notes combine with a complex sourness. Up there with the best Belgian Lambics as far as I'm concerned. Can't put it into words, just fantastic."
"Color is golden and murky with no head. smell is surprisingly clean with vague fruit notes and some minor funk. Taste is intensely sour and puckering with some citrus notes. The taste is one-dimensional in that the sourness is the overwhelming characteristic, though still very pleasant. Body is light. I enjoyed this, though there isn't that much to say. Perhaps the most sour beer I've had."
"Leathery brett tinged witha sharp lemon acidity. Not an overly powering acidity. I think it's fairly well balanced between the sourness and funk for an American wild. Clean flavor profile. Bitter, drying brett aftertaste. Not a lasting sourness. Cleans off the palate fairly quickly."
"This one pours a light to medium bodied melted butter in appearance with a light white lacing. It smells of light Granny Smith apples with some apricot and peaches. This is officially the first beer to make me pucker. Wow! This is mind blowingly sour. It is just so tart and you don't get killed with brett its really astonishing. What a sour! As far as sours go, this is a sipper, an utter palate destroyer. Phenomenal, phenomenal beer."
"Will add in my thoughts on Batch 002 when I get around to opening my last bottle. Highly recommended stuff - I'm anxiously looking forward to Batch 004. Wish this still came in 750mls."
"Batch 2. The brew pours a hazy yellow hue and is topped with some wispy bubbles; just enough head to demonstrate liveliness. The nose is, whew, musky and hugely atomized. It is getting into my sinuses like Vernors ginger ale does (strange observation, I know...) Anyhow, the aroma is musky and lemon-zesty and just very pert all-around. The taste is just absolutely fantastic; it is the sourest a thing can be without crossing the line into a flagrant level. Notes of lemon, green apple, wet wood, overripe peaches (or maybe underripe?), wet dog, Warhead candy and a small amount of tart white grape reveal tremendous complexity within the sourness. The feel is pert for the most part, but it has an amazingly clean finish. Having had Batch 2 and 3, I must say I prefer 2. It is far more sour, disparately flavored and heavily nuanced; whereas I recollect 3 to be far more harmonious, juicy and less tart. Overall, one of the better American Wilds I've ever had."
"This beer pours out a beautiful hazy blonde with hints of amber. The head is almost nonexistent with a thin ring around the edges. The smell puts off a big oaky character, with hints of funky fruit...hinting toward apricot. The main thing I get out of this is a big dry oaky tingle. The citrus acidity on the backside to this beer is incredible, the back of my tongue and cheeks are pulled so tight. This is what I'll expect from a ""sour"" from now on. The finish on this beer lasts forever, I can't believe how incredible this beer is. A life goal has been fulfilled...thank you again jeff and Chad for sharing this moment with me!"
"O - Holy cow this was delicious. I LOVE sour, and this was hands down the most sour beer I've ever had. Stuff was great. So many great aspects to this beer. Wish I had more."
"An acidic and ultra aggressive yet tasteful citrus flavor with a mild cheesy funk. However, the aroma of citrus and barnyard is definitely understated compared to the flavor of this beer. An absolutely mind numbing sour ale from Russian River. Probably the most sour beer I've ever had. Can't wait to try other batches of this one."
"EDIT: lots can change in 9 months. Had b005 several times recently and it is crazy good. Edited well up to reflect this."
"O - Really great beer, not sure how much this varies batch to batch but this was a big time winner and awesome example of an American Wild. Really no complaints with this one, would love to drink it regularly."
"O-More friendly and approachable than fresh bottles. A few years does this beer a world of good, though I am a big fan of it fresh as well."
"Smells funky with tons of lemon. Tastes very very tart/sour. The oak is great on the tongue. The sourness burns the throat. Wow this is potent. Overall the aroma is phenomenal but the sourness hurts me ;)"
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Batch 003! I have been lucky as of late to knock out quite a few of my brews needed for my Russian River -tion Quest and this one is NO exception! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, sour, tart, funk, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent in all aspects! This one was a standout from the tasting that night for just about all of the participants. The flavor on this one was otherworldly sour and definitely brought the duck-face HARD! Even from the aroma you would get a partial duck-face going. Definitely well rounded in flavor though as the fruit and woodiness added a nice touch to keep your palate guessing rather than just drop-kicking it with sour and tart notes. Really really well done... Hope to try some older batches in the future for comparison (hint hint traders...)"
"O- Glad I had some people to share this with. I like it, but it's intense."
"Slightly hazy golden color with minimal head that disappears quickly. Funky, sour, bretty aroma. Lemon acidity with a little sour apple.Very pleasant sour taste despite the high acidity. Mild carbonation. In my opinion one of the best american geuze-styles. This one and Duck Duck geuze are in a class of their own."
"Overall very sour and acidic, hard to drink but great flavors and light funk."
"O - Batch 3 was my favorite beer of all time, and now this one has taken that over. This is a beer that could age forever, and just get better. Can't wait to open another."
"this beer is the most sour beer that I have ever had. This is the only thing I will talk about because of how sour it was. It was like I took everything I knew about sour beers, and blew my entire mind. Beatification made me literally lose all thought as I took a drink, it shocked me that much. At the same time, this might be its downfall. There would be no way that I could get this beer down on my own or even between two people, it is so sour. Excellent taste, great beer."
"Batch 3: 4 - 4.5 – 5 – 4 - 4.5"
"One of the best wild ales out there, at least in my experience. The gueuze comparisons are inevitable, though this is less balanced and more overtly tart and less funky than befits that style. So clean and sharp, though not without its rawness. A treat, and one of the bars for the style."
"I think the beauty of this beer is really in the details. Tasting a Lambic style beer known to be fermented and conditioned with yeast and bacteria native to a region other than the Senne valley that is so complex and delicious is inspiring. The impact of this beer is an illustration that although a true Lambic cannot be produced elsewhere, a complex, balanced, and truly interesting top shelf product can be made in other regions, and shows the true potential of the American Wild movement. I believe that an increased interest in this beer could be a key contributor to the increased legitimacy of beer as a gourmet product. Nice work Russian River, keep doing more of the same."
"I have wanted to try this one for a long time and Chris busted it out to help ease the pain of the Hawks loss. Thanks! Batch 3 poured into Lost Abbey Tumbler. Slightly hazy straw yellow with a tiny white head fades to a collar. Smells musty and lemony sour. Not sweet at all, some white grapes, very funky. Taste is incredibly sour and lactic. Slightly metallic, citric, very acidic, funky barnyard, how many ways can I say sour. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Overall, this is a great American Wild. Intensely sour, this reminds me more of some of the great Belgians then any American sour I have had."
"On tap at the Public House in San Francisco. Pours a clear amber with with a small white head that has decent retention and leaves a bunch of small spots of lacing on glass. Aroma is very funky with big grapefruit and a mineral presence. Also a big of oak and some champagne yeast. Initial taste is huge tart grapefruit which goes into some lemon and mineral. Some light oak as well. Very dry and very sour. One of the most sour beer I have had. Mild astringency. Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Right up there with the best beers that Russian River (or anyone else) has to offer."
"-this beer is crazy sour, but not in a way that is over the top. it is really hard to explain. all i can say is that for how sour it is...it is extremely drinkable"
"Drinkability is good. This beer has turned into a beast with some age on it. Nice complexity in the nose and flavor, plus lots sourness. A sourhead's dream for sure. That being said, the level of sourness does cut down on the drinkability somewhat, but at the same time makes the beer fun to drink. I'll definitely have to seek out batch 003 now that I've had this. Highly recommended."
"I am very fond of this beer. Probably the best American Wild I've had to date."
"Batch 3-this is also very solid, would get a slightly lower rating. it has the same complex funk to it that Batch 2 had. It has slightly more acidity but still has the same assertive sourness. It also doesn't have the bright golden fruit presence that batch 2 has, it is there but not quite as vibrant. Integrated well but slightly less complex."
"D - The drinkability isn't that huge, because of the unrelenting citrus, vinegar and funk notes, but I just cannot stop drinking this. This beer was an experience for me and I cannot wait to try it again."
"The CPJ"
"D - Man on man, why didn't I buy more of this? Easily one of the best wild ales I've ever had. Just fantastic. I can't wait for another batch!"
"Light and crisp with good small bubble carbonation that gently tickles your tongue. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"this is hands down the best american wild ale that resembles the belgian gueuze. amazing flavor and complexity. other sour brewers, take note."
"D - Such great drinkability! This one goes down so well it's hard to keep any in the glass while reviewing! Also difficult in terms of it's rarity! Thanks for the top 100 tick Sweem!"
"The appearance is a thick, murky, orange with no head. It doesn't look pretty, but in all honesty it reminds me of Raspberry Eisbock - flat, thick, and old looking. The smell is about as interesting as it gets for any beer - the most complex and outright strange beer I've ever smelled - I get musty basement, barn, horse, smelly feet, aged white cheddar, energy drink (such as Monster or Red Bull), with a touch of lemon and white grapes in the finish. Wow. The taste is SOUR. The most sour beer I've ever had - the sourness hurts my epiglottis, puckers my posterior pharynx, makes my face warm, and causes me to tear up. The drinkability on this beer is almost zero, but the taste and smell of it is so unique that this beer truly does live up to the hype. This is the best beer I've had tonight thus far. As someone who loves midwestern stouts and IPAs, I've always been a big basher of west coat sours. However, Beatification is as good as it gets. Touche."
"D: Well, I only had about 6 ounces of this, and wish I could have had more. With that being said, the extreme sourness of this beer would probably limit my ability to have a lot of this in one sitting. With that being said, I'd be happy to have this at any opportunity, and will definitely look to get more"
"Wonderful experience."
"D: I find batch 3 much more drinkable (and I should probably review it formally). Batch 2 is ok in small doses, but it strikes me as straight lemon juice."
"This is my top sour. Either batch. I would drink these constantly. This is easily one of the top sours in the world."
"D: This is pretty much as good as it gets, and I'm floored by how close to perfection is seems to be to my tastes. Suddenly, Pennsylvania doesn't seem too far to travel to try to secure more. I'm fortunate it's on the East at all!"
"Medium bodied with a slightly puckering tart mouthfeel. Soft carbonation with some earthy oak notes as well as some puckering sour funk. The great thing about this beer is although it is sour and funky with dry bretty efervescence, it isn't acetic at all and is actually very well balanced by the citrus and light fruit notes. Hints of lemon peel as well as apple and pear. Complex and extremely complex with a nice tart finish. Each sip leaves me salivating for more. Get this beer!!"
"D: It was wonderfully drinkable, but one I really wanted to savor. I got about a 6oz pour of it which was perfect. It's one I would definitely drink again and again."
"***Since the original rate I've recently had the batch 2 and batch 3 side by side. It's a wonderful beer, especially batch 2. I don't know whether the beer has matured in the last year or I've just grown to like it more. It's clearly in another league from Lost Abbey light sours, even the big name ones, and is better than most available geuze around here."
"overall - phenomenal beer."
"I'll be honest, I am a big fan of Russian River (kind of makes it hard living in New York), and this bottle does not disappoint. I am enjoying it very much. And my bottle was signed by Vinnie at a fest some time ago (irrelevant for the taste, but still fun to mention)."
"D: I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to try this beer. I will certainly be looking to get more when the next batch is released. But this is some pretty strong stuff, flavor wise. One glass in a sitting was more than enough for me."
"All in all, I'm amazed - what a beer! I love RR's regular sour offerings, but this takes the cake - only Sanctification comes close to the levels of funkiness in this. I hope to try every batch of this, but I'll always remember #2 fondly..."
"D: Overall a nice wild. Glad I got the chance to tick this bad boy."
"D - a hardcore sipper: partially to blame is its incredible sourness, deliciousness, and complexity. one of those beers that just amazes me that naturally occurring things can cause flavors like this all on their own. sours/wilds really propelled me to the next level in beer advocacy and this point is one of its peaks. im running out of creative and artistic ways to describe this. simply amazing."
"D: A new experience with beer for me. Definitely opened up my eyes even further. Just when I think beer can't impress me any further, it continues to do so."
"This having been my second time trying it, I really do think it deserves the updated score I am giving it. Rareness and demand aside, this is really world class in every way. Makes me want to try some of the older batches to compare with this, but I doubt that will ever happen. Russian River needs to release a new batch of this asap!"
"Bottle. Pours a slightly haze straw color with a slight collared white head. Lemon zesty nose coupled with some barnyard. Very citrus type tart notes. Light mouhfeel with good carbonation. Slightly mouth puckering. The taste is really good with notes of oak, barnyard, lemon, grapefruit, and white grapes. Some good Brett notes without being overly floral or medicinal. Tasty, very tasty overall. Ends pretty dryly."
"Excellent representation of the style. This may be my absolute favorite American Wild ale."
"D: The best barrel-aged Russian River beer I've ever had. One of the best wild ales I've ever had. One of the best beers I've ever had! Oh man was this tasty. I wish I had more."
"O: Really glad I got to try this beer, age has certainly been kind to it. Would love to try it again in the future."
"Flavor is just like the aroma...perfect. This turned out to be my favorite/biggest surprise beer of the night(which had beers like Black Tuesday and Duck Duck Gooze to compete with). I expected this beer to be delightful, but didn't expect it to rock my world! The sourness/tartness is incredible. Loads of the sharp tart, oak, funkiness. Finishes only slightly dry. Light and crisp mouthfeel. High carbonation. What a fantastic sour!!"
"Aroma is just a great combination of funk and the characteristic grapefruit flavor that this beer is often known for. I like that the funk character is complex and satisfying without going into the cheesy direction. Don't get my wrong, there's a time and a place for some stinky cheese aroma - it's just nice to find a great complex nose that satisfies without it. I'm mostly getting some musty straw-like components, wet wood and bretty earthiness in the funk department, which is just awesome contrasting with the brighter grapefruit and meyer lemon acidic qualities. The taste is just as delicious as the aroma prefaced, boasting sharp lactic sourness, all of the great lemony and grapefruit brightening up the palate with low-medium bodied with lively, yet subtle carbonation aiding in the long dry, earthy, mineral finish. Not as tongue-numbingly sour as batch 2, but still packs a punch. One of the best American sour beers. Always a pleasure to drink."
"One of the closer American examples to traditional Lambic. There were some similarities here and there to Cantillon Classic Gueuze, another all time favorite of mine."
"The only thing I can say about this beer is you have to try it. You'll either love it, or hate it. But I think it is beatifying indeed."
"Mouthfeel is nice, not too carbonated like some American wilds. Sticky and dry finish because of the oak and sourness. Really nice but nothing world class like the taste. This beer is super sour, not Cantillon Kriek razors down the throat sour, but really puckering. This beer rocks, plain and simple. I have a batch 3 750ml bottle to open sometime down the line and I can't wait. Highly, highly recommended for the sour connoisseur or any beer lover. This stuff is amazing and may be a permanent ISO for me."
"D: I would drink this every day if it were feasible. Wow."
"D- PERFECT! My favorite out of all the sours we consumed. One of my favorite beers to date!"
"Overall, nice brew that is a pleasure to drink anytime."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just a touch lower due to the extreme sourness of the brew. Overall, I really liked what RR did here. Out of all the sours we tasted, this one came in at #2. Skal."
"Thanks to jedwards for sharing. 375ml corked and caged bottle, batch #2. Poured a hazy, golden-orange, with no head. Nose reveals some citrus (perhaps tangerines), cork and a hint of funk. Taste reveals muted grapefruit seeds and a salty quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light), with an easy carbonation and some light astringency that stimulates the salivary glands. What an incredible sour - light, flavorful and extremely drinkable. Wish I could get more of this."
"Drinkability:"
"I first had 001 - PH1 on 7/25/09 in a full Beatification vertical (001, 001 - PH1, 002, 003), and I couldn't decide if 002 or PH1 was the best batch. I had PH1 again at Woodshop 5.0 on 2/20/2010 and it was a disgusting mess, so I was worried the whole batch had gone downhill. This most recent bottle was sublime, so I really have no idea what the deal was with the bottle at Woodshop. There were no detectable off flavors here; it was a display of all around excellence."
"Pours a golden color with a decent white head. Smell is very funky like cheese, sour lemons, apples, and oak. Taste is sour lemons, pears, apples, funk and oak. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, with a dry finish. Overall it is another great sour."
"Batch 003. The beer pours a hazy gold color with a white head. The aroma is much more funky than the other Russian River sours I have rated. I get some cheesy funk, a little tartness and some oak and vanilla. The flavor is more of the cheesy funk with some tart lemons and oak character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This might be the most genuine American sour ale I've come across. Very lambic-like in terms of sourness and overall character."
"D: A very solid beer and in my opinion, the best of the ""-tion"" series next to supplication. Clean and crisp with a taste that isn't overly complex but still very well executed. Thanks again to Jeff for the opportunity and I can't wait to try this again with perhaps even a little more time on it."
"Overall, yet another fantastic sour from Russian River. As I said, probably my current favorite from their lineup."
"D - it's good, but one glass is enough for me."
"Typical funk smell. Taste is some citrus with lambic taste. Like actual lambic/guezue taste. I believe I can taste oak as well."
"Consumed - 4/16/2010"
"Thanks to jgaston for sending this bottle back in mid-2008...glad I cellared it for a couple years."
"D - What do you think?! This is phenomenal. Truly an enlightening experience in my beer ventures. 5.0"
"Batch 002. Hazy, yellow gold pour with a small short lived, fizzy, white head. Oaky funk aroma with notes of butterscotch, grass, herbs, bread and yeast. Immensly sour flavor upfront with some white grape hints, butterscotch, slight oak on the finish, lemon, grass, sipcy hops, apple and yeast. Medium body. Very dry finish and livlely carbonation."
"The mouthfeel is also great. Very light, but always (with RR) well carbonated. Drinkability too, is as always, through the roof."
" Had this in a snifter. A golden straw like color with a nice amount of carbonation that kept a very small ring around the top. A creamy vanilla and banana (major banana)aroma with the obvious brett character as well. Loved this aroma! Major tartness in taste. After a few sips I could taste the oak and wine in it with some lemon/lime hints. An excellent big sour taste. This is a real sour, unlike wanna be sours such as Moaten. A ""light"" body with much weaker carbonation then expected, but very well balanced especially considering all that is in it. I expected some vinegar but seemed like none considering how big of a sour it is. Anyone who wants to see what a sour beer is, you must try this one! I love this beer as one of my top three sours ever!! A must try."
"Beatification by RR is a wild ale that is 100% spontaneously fermented beer using the oldest barrels that no longer have any wine flavor or oak flavor left in them. 5.5% abv. It poured a cloudy sun yellow. It smelled of sour, oak and Brett. It tasted sour! Lemon, lemon, lemon sour, Brett and super dry. It is one tart beer! Reminiscent of Isabelle Proximus, a one note incredibly sour beer."
"Overall an amazing beer that everyone should seek out. It's gotten pretty tart over the course of a year or so so if you want to age some, be known that this is what it does."
"D:This batch is ridiculously good. So clean and tart. I have had both batch 2 and 3 a few times, and I have to say batch 2 maybe a little more tart than batch 3. Although any version of this beer is simply outstanding."
"Drinkability: By far the best light-colored sour I've had. Complex, intense, and tangy. The high sourness hurts the drinkability a bit. But damn... I still can't get over that smell! Highly, highly recommended!"
"Overall this beer was a true experience and a great leap for me into sours. Well-crafted from a unique brewery and certainly one I would like to revisit in the future."
"It poured a nice lite yellow, an off gold heather straw color. With a mighty funk odor presiding from the glass. This beer was super tart and super dry, with a strong citric taste. There was also a very bretty taste. The taste was very malleable, varying from sip to sip, jumping from the barnyard brett to a bone dry lemon making it a pleasure to drink. That combined with the low ABV, lack of sweetness and the pleasant fuzziness, I could have drunken this all day. Yet this review still comes out a bit drunk. Go figure!"
"Beer is a sour bomb. Totally citric and acetic but does not devolve into vinegar as some of these lighter bodied ones do. Its medium to low in body, the carbonation is important in the mouth. Drinkability is the really high and its the best tasting sour I've had. Tartness really hits me in the corners of my mouth but overall a great and solid sour. I'm shocked its not rated higher. I'll be seeking this out again."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding. It has a light, pale and wheat malt scent with a mild sourness; very well done. The taste is awesome as hell. Wow, what a great sour flavor. It's light and easy drinking with a mouth-puckering sourness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a damn fine wild ale. It's no secret why this one is in the top 100."
"D a great second beer, needs a show stater. Too much and too intense to start with. I have little experience with this style of beer, but it was an enjoyable and wild time. I dont think i would buy this in 750 format, i think a little goes a long way."
"Batch 002. Brilliant gold in color with a light amount of cloudiness. Some head present, but on the less lustrous side of things. Aromas is citric, lemony, acidic, floral, and vinous. The spontaneous in-barrel fermentation lends a more powerful sour and funk than Russian River's other brews. The taste is tongue pleasingly sour, with citrus, lemon, pedio funk, and slightly earthy on the finish. Moderately bodied with a matching amount of carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, my favorite sour from Russian River."
"J"
"D: I've always been a huge fan of the intense sourness that Beatification has, and this is no exception. I always enjoy the opportunity to open up a bottle."
"This has to be the most balanced sour I've had. The beer is not overly sharp in the finish and doesn't have a huge bite. It's just a solid, balanced beer. Very nice."
"O: Very good sour."
"This beer was a hit for the night with wide range of beers. id love to get my hands on a few bottles to monitor how this beer develops with age."
"Overall: Had anticipated more out of this beer, but a decent beer for the style. Not sure I'll be seeking this one out again, but worth a try. Cheers!"
"One of my favorite sours from Russian River and probably one of their least accessible for those new to the style. A little goes a long way. Always worth seeking out."
"Drinks very easy, always happy to try anything from these guys, I think I prefer these heavier & darker for optimal effect, none of the RR sours are slouches though. If you like big-time funk & sourness, this is your huckleberry..."
"Russian River has my undying respect. I cannot get over how unfreakingbelievable their sours are. Also have a signature to them, which I enjoy - I feel like a new RR sour could come out tomorrow and you could blindfold me, stick it under my nose, and I would recognize it immediately."
"D: A very easy drinking sour that is very enjoyable and mellow in terms of flavor"
"Drinkability is amazing. I can't imagine a 750 ml going faster than this one would if I didn't pace myself. This is liquid gold in a bottle. I was thinking about trading my second bottle but I'm now having serious doubts and second thoughts."
"Overall I am very impressed, I would consider this one of my first real sour beers and definitely my first American sour. I can definitely see why these RR sours are so sought after now. Excellent beer that I would definitely buy again."
"This beer is amazing. And I think it is my gateway. Thanks again Jeff...you picked a fantastic beer to send me!"
"The mild mouthfeel and general feeling of elation makes this a highly drinkable beer. The aftertaste might be off putting for some, but in my opinion it's fantastic, making for my favorite Russian River sour offering thus far"
"D - This beer is drinkable for how sour it is. It is not an unpleasing sour, and allows for the drinker to desire more. I would not have more than 1 glass of this though, but I still love the one I am having!"
"75cl bottle shared by photomike. Just another animal entirely from the rest of the Russian River family. The sourest beer that I have ever had, but somehow remained smooth and drinkable. I'm not even sure that I understand. Ever since hearing Vinnie describe how they were brewing this beer while we were at the brewery for RBSG this past summer, I've been dying to try it. This truly is a Sonambic. The funk, the acidity, the wood. So intense from start to finish. The pour is a relatively unassuming hazy yellow with a small fine head that leaves patchy lace behind. The aroma is where things get interesting. It's just the funkiest, sourest, most oaky thing to ever hit my nostrils. Straight oaked lemon juice with brett. The flavor is super dry, super sour, with yoghurt and lemons coming through, and quite oaky, though relatively clean tasting as well, without the the sharper cheesy funk flavors found in some Belgian lambics. Light bodied with acid coasting the tongue. I had burned my tongue the day before on some tea, and Beatification started to bring back the hurt with all that acid. Pain for pleasure. Honestly, this borders on too acidic, and I have a very high threshold for sour. Though it is very well blended and smooth overall for how acidic it is. This might not have been the most pleasurable beer of the tasting, but it was the most heavy of an impact. Lacks the depth of Supplication, but the awesome sourness is unrivaled. Killer shit."
"Overall: Maybe the most sour beer I've ever had. Though not super complex, the sour dryness keeps you coming back for more over and over, despite the need for TUMS."
"Overall this wild ale is a good beer, partly just because I love sours. however, compared to other sours it is severly lacking in complexity and originality. Would I drink this beer again? Certainly. Would I go out of my to find it, trade something special to get it, or pay a lot at an auction site no."
"Overall- lots of brett and sour character. fairly one dimensional but better than some geueze with more barnyard/wild character."
"O: great, refreshing, a lot of nice brett character, complex but simple."
"M/D - Crisp, light feel. Very easy drinking. Mine was rather well carboanted which seems to be abnormal after reading other reviews."
"I can smell the funk as soon as I pop the cork. Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a good sized white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of barnyard funk, lemon, tart fruits, and leather. Smells very tart, I think I'm in for a treat. The taste is mouth puckering sour and dry with lots of tart fruits especially lemon and sour orange. Hints of horse blanket and tobacco round it out. Leaves a bone dry finish in which you can feel the lactic acid burn down your throat until it splashes into your stomach. Every sip leaves your mouth watering for more. Medium low carbonation, Medium light body. Wow that's a great sour beer! Lots of acid, some funk, very little vinegar. Vinnie you've done it again."
"Good beer. Unfairly, I was expecting some kind of heavenly notes to sound when I opened the bottle, but this wasn't as good as some other sours I've had. Good, but simple."
"drinkability is great. balanced acidity, great depth. interesting and very enjoyable. it'll be neat to see how this one changes with some age."
"Overall, it's an interesting beer, but not terribly balanced, and missing the complexity imparted by the barrels of various other Russian River ""sours"". Worth trying if you have the chance, but it's not something I would go out of my way to try again."
"Medium boby is delicately carbonated. Nice dry finish. Another very impressive sour from Russian River."
"Drinkability is pretty good but a little over the top with tartness so not something you could sip on for too long. Nice flavors and interesting qualities."
"Good sour beer, would like to see more flavor. Just kinda bland, imho."
"D-Mmmm, mmm damn good stuff. I love green apples and this is that in fermented form. The ""wildness"" is fairly subtle and does it's best to accompany the flavours and not overwhelm them."
"Drinkabiliy is superb, I'm now a big fan! I love sours / wilds and this one is great!!"
"The carbonation and dry finish combined with the excellent carbonation make this beer very drinkable. The alcohol is barely present and the sour notes are very well highlighted."
"D - Possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had. The light body, coupled with the 5.5 % ABV and alluring flavor make this an easy one to enjoy in large quantities...if only I had enough to session with."
"Batch 03 - Thanks Thorpe429 for bringing this to our tasting. Pours a cloudy golden color with a quickly dissipating head. Aromas of citrus, peach, sour apples, and a nice funk with light vinegar. Taste is quite tart with more lemon flavors and horse blanket funkiness. Mouthfeel is good for the style - a bit thin though. This is a very complex sour and one of my favorites. Also, surprisingly it went very well with our supreme pizza."
"D: Exceedingly drinkable. This one was fantastic and hopefuly I'll get another try some day."
"D - Not a starter sour, but really good. Lots of funk and fruity sourness. Pretty intense, but excellent sour."
"Drinkability: The tartness of this beer is over the edge for me, although I understand that we are in Geuze territory; I would have liked to see a bit more carbonation as well"
"D - Not my favorite wild from RR, but damn good anyway."
"*NB: Probably the bottom of the Russian River wild ale's, but still better than most."
"Overall a great great beer. A sour like you wouldn't think possible in a beer if you've never had a sour ale before (like myself). Impressive"
"Oak and some wonderful layers of barnyard and slight bandaid rubber. It's acidic and tart, with the malt barely to be seen. The carbonation is not quite champagne quality, but it's tingly and satisfying. Crisp tart apples in here too. Slight sulphurous match, but other than that quite clean and flawless. Yum! The little snifter half-pint was gone before I knew it."
"Batch 3. Rather clear, golden colored beer with minimal head and retention. Carbonation is abundant. Bouquet has a mild funk and is dominated by hay and lemons. Can't wait to taste this one. Quite sour taste here induces some puckering, lemons and grapefruit hit you mid way and the sourness returns and lingers through the finish for quite some time. I prefer Consecreation and Temptation a bit more but this is still another great beer from RR which I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."
"D: Gotta be in the right mood for this one as the sourness is among the highest I've encountered."
"EDIT 2/2010: Had this a couple more times from the bottle and it grows on you a bit. Still a bit one-dimensional and overdone, but it is reasonably drinkable and can be tasty if you get the right batch. Raising it from a B- to a high B+. I like this beer now."
"D: Had a couple glasses, but not masking too high of an abv."
"The initial sip is a bit of a shocker but after the taste buds orient to the new adventure I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It wrests every taste bud and demands you hunker down and contemplate its depths. Love the pucker and the funk, time to see what else the world of American sours has in store!"
"I don't think sours are really my thing, whihc will save me a bundle in the long run. However, I'm quite impressed with this and I can see why some people have fallen in love with the style. A very well-constructed beer, but not one I'd look for any time soon."
"Thanks Grub!"
"D- A low ABV like this would grant a whole bottle to the head, but all the bugs in my system afterwards is not a good look and would eat my skinny ass up. When I gain 100 pounds or so I will attempt to drink a 750 of this, for now sharing is fine with me. The drinkability on this is insane, I drank my glass in no time, and now im looking for more."
"Overall, this is a sweet beer. I like the sourness, but it still has a sweet funky farmhouse taste. I can easily drink more of this."
"Drinkability is very good."
"Drinkabilty is a tough one to nail on this beer. I could drink one of these every year and be good so I can't say it's really all that drinkable. I don't want to break out the 750 in the cellar by any means. I do think the tastes, smells, and other components are great just not something I'd go back to repeatedly. I will try this again."
"D- Easy to drink just not one that I could drink on a regular basis. A very solid change of pace."
"This is a very different beer from what I'm used to. I've had a few sours and this one was the most pronounced in every way. Poured a hazy yellow with about an inch of white head leaving little lacing. Big lemon and citrus smell, some earthy tones and some funk. You can tell this one is going to be sour. First taste was WOW that sour almost in a bad way, but after i keep sipping my taste buds start to get used to what they are sensing. Very tart (obviously), acidic and citrus. This is a very powerful tasting brew, I was thinking about reviewing another beer tonight but I don't know if my taste buds can adjust. Mouth feel is good, not too much carbonation at all. I have an 003 in the cellar I might have to bust it out soon and compare notes."
"A great beer. Very sour. I will have this again at some point in the future."
"The bottle was quite enough for me but I will say I enjoyed every drop. I think the fact this is so hard to find will probably hinder me from looking forwad to driking this again . I was glad it reminded me of a gueuze so I can easly grab one to help remind me of the experiance"
"Great beer, especially for fans of wild ales. Highly recommended."
"I have been wanting to try this wild ale for some time. Nice fine bubbled head, nice gold color. Smells of citrus and the best thing I can describe it as is TANG, before you add water and dilute it. Sour funk on the nose but moreso on the palate. There's a sweet/sour component where the brett/saccaros mingle that is very unique. Feels light on the mouth, but very complex. Excellent sour."
"D: For the ABV this is highly drinkable. I love the tartness balanced by the lemon zest. Definitely worth the drink."
"Quite delicious and refreshing, making for a very drinkable beer. Big brownie points for designing a hard-to-make beer, especially consistently. Cheers!"
"This whole experience reminded me of the first time that I was in Toronado SF and someone handed the bartender a tulip of sour beer. It may have been Beatification, and, upon drinking it, he made the face that people in middle school used to make when eating sour ""Warheads."" Afterwards, he put the glass down and said, ""That's my favorite beer."" I think I understand that experience a little better now."
"Fascinating a beer though Beatification may be, it is (admittedly) largely thanks to those few Belgian brewers who continue the tradition of spontaneously fermented ales that such knowledge and technique were handed down (and then west about 5500 miles) to one of North America's most innovative and talented brewmaster. No wonder it's called ""Beatification", this beer sure makes me happy!"
"An inch and a half of ghostly white head sits on top of a golden yellow wheat colored body that is refreshing in itself. The nose is really exciting with such balance between the acidic sour and funky wheat tones. Sour cherries and sugary candied feel are really there. Shazam! Sharply tart as you take first sip, vinegary and acidic with lemony zest up front on the tongue, the sour feel really hangs on to both sides of the tongue. Now this really mellows out and turns sustainably powdery. Mouthfeel is early apple crisp and really enjoyable. initially the sour seems a bit strong but it quickly becomes lovely. Very nice."
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color ale with some white hue and a generous pure white bubbly head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of oak with some lactic sourness and some funky barnyard notes. Taste is quite complex with mix of sour lactic notes, some oak notes and some funky barnyard notes as well. I must admit that this is pretty close to some Lambic brewed in Belgium while lacking some complexity. Full body with great carbonation. I would love to have access to this on a regular basis."
"D- I could do this all night. Super sour though so if you're not into that then you might have a problem. ISO:"
"All in all, a delicious beer, but not as good as the Temptation I had previously. The Current 93, Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain, is a Sunn O like rocker by the way, as unique as their previous offering. Much like this beer. God bless Russian River and Current 93."
"All in all, a pretty fantastic beer. Definitely a balls-to-the-wall sour - this is not one I'd use to introduce someone to the style, even if I could get it off my local store's shelf. But yowza, what an experience."
"Batch 002. Thanks (again) to sonicdescent for a great trade. Pours a beautiful vibrant yellow color, orange highlights, slightly hazed. Real bright. Unripe lemons, barnyard and hay, funky bugs and yeast, grassy very dry aroma. Thinking I'm in for quite the ride here. Ok this beer is a little crazy if you ask me. It is just over the top sour. Pungent brutal sourness. Usually your tastebuds get used to the sour after the first initial sips, but this beer just keeps shocking me everytime I take a sip. With out a doubt the most brazenly sour beer I have ever had. Ballsy. I dig it. Lemon rind, green apple, wheat grass, hay, dust. Remember sour candy like warheads or cry babies? This beer is like an adult version of that. Excellent acidity. It reminds me of the most sour thing I've ever had, which were these little weird fruits called calamondins that grew on a tree in my grandma's backyard in Florida. I used to eat them all the time as a little fellow. They are like tart, acrid little oranges and they taste like this beer. Really an amazing feat in brewing to get so much flavor into one beer. I have to knock the drinkability only a tad because it's so outrageously sour, but it works here. I'm shocked."
"D 4"
"This is another great sour from Russian River and while I probably don't like it quite as much as some of their others, it's still a solid beer."
"What is fantastic about this beer is the very clean sourness that avoids the cheesy, grassy, earthy flavors without loosing the complex Brett notes. Certainly not one-dimentional. But like most great sours, the astringency and sourness hurts a bit in texture and drinkability. Still I'll be hard pressed to ever have a better sour. If you had told me that this was a Berlinerweiss, I would have beleived you."
"Medium carbonation and highly enjoyable - recommened."
"drinkability: pretty strong"
"Overall - An outstanding wild ale - one of the best i've tried and as good as any Belgian example..."
"Pours a whitish orange. Almost looks like a wheat beer with a thin bright white head. Smells of citrus and earth. Definitely can smell the malts in this one. The smell is somewhat mild. Taste starts sweet and is followed up by an intense sour. There is a lot of citrus flavor in this beer (apples and grape flavors all add to the citrus flavor). Hops kick in after you swallow and leave a bittering aftertaste. Barrel aging comes through nicely too via the earthy taste. Mothfeel is light with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkablilty is great. Obviously this wouldn't be a session beer. But I think I could have one of two of these after a meal."
"Overall, I am glad I had a chance to try this brew. Obviously a fine brew, just not my preferred style."
"Overall am east drinker and a great sour overall but my least favorite of Russian Rivers sour offerings."
"Batch #002 courtesy of, and a huge thanks to drseamus, unbelievable extra to help me enter the world of Wild Ales. Pours a flat looking head, crazy really, as moments later the carbonization builds up and a thin, striking white head appears. This head then slowly dissipates into a white ring, but the end result as you drink is some thin, but dense lacing. It almost looks like an arnold palmer (half lemonade and half iced tea), by that I mean a yellowish tan, but rather light/clear. A potent sour smell up front, mellows a bit to an earthy undertone. This is the sour I have been waiting to try, it is a super crisp lemony sour, with a sweet ting at the end. I must admit, I am a novice when it comes to Wild Ales, with some having that barn/leathery taste that I do not care for. This is thing is a pure crisp sourness, really none of the earthy smell comes through in the taste. Obviously, very tart in your mouth, and as you drink it will hit the back of tongue hard too. In the end, an amazing beer from a pure, crisp sour standpoint. I'll need to try more to compare my tastes now..."
"This buggier version of Beatification Batch 001 won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's pretty uncompromising in its tart acidity, which will tend to put some people off. I appreciate and respect the skill that went into its creation, but there are quite a few Russian River brews that I find to be superior."
"Light in body, and incredibly easy to drink for a spontaneously fermented beer. The lambics I've had previously are usually so puckering they take some work. This is clean, delicious sour beer. Did I just say clean? I mean filthy."
"Very tasty. No one does sours like Russian River."
"The beer is golden orange colored and a little hazy with a very thin head. You know it's gonna be sour from the first sniff, acidic and ""lambicy"". The taste is intense lemon juice and funk, so acidic and tasty it's hard to differentiate from the wicked lambics I've had in Brussels and Brugge. Very dry aftertaste, and alum pucker that lasts and is reborn with each lick of the lips. This is the most sour wild ale I could imagine, very similar to my memory of Apfelwein in Frankfurt but with carbonation. Apfelwein is German apple cider and can be very sour (especially the Saurer Most version)."
"I was sad that the sourness had mellowed out in the aging, but it was still a good brew."
"This beer was blindingly sour. In fact, I cannot think of another that is more tart. Even though I love most sour beers, I found this one to be rather overwhelming and somewhat lacking in a number of areas."
"Drinkability: Went down surprisingly well. This was most comparable to Temptation for me, which I think I still prefer slightly, but still, very drinkable. More so than Supplicaton."
"Poured a bright yellow, golden color with some strong white, billowing head at the top of the wine glass. Aroma was tart with citrus, and apple like aromas. Some spice, but mostly a lemon zest type aroma in a very smooth way. Taste was all tart, and sour that made me pucker. A slight smoothness lingers on the tongue after the initial assault. Mouth feel was crisp and carbonated like a beer champagne."
"Overall: Amazingly huge flavor, very intense. Once you get a little use to the sourness many other more subtle flavors begin to pop out and the beer becomes more drinkable."
"Overall- This is a very sour and complex bee, I want more like it!"
"D: Very interesting and enjoyable but not splitting a bomber would be one hell of a challenge. Try this one for sure!"
"Poured hazy yellow-gold with a ring of white bubbles and an oily film. Decent lacing. Bitter, bitter nose. Apricots, apples, sour peaches, white vinegar, and yeast. Taste is very bretty, sour to a cheesy/buttery flavor. A fair amount of citrus; lemon zest, pineapple, mango. Slight oakiness, similar to what one would find in a white wine. Lighter mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Delicious."
"Poured into a tulip a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, yeasty, citrus, slight spice. The taste is soury, malty/yeasty, with good citrus/spice notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"D- This was an excellent brew and one I would definitely trade for again. It ended a gathering with a few other BAs that turned out to be a Russian River night. These 3 beers (this deviation, and the younger) were definitely my favorite by this brewing co. so far and I look forward to trying other brews they have to offer."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and slick, goes down easy and leaves the mouth sticky."
"Thanks to midaszero for the bottle. Much appreciated sir."
"Pours a beautifully crystal clear pale amber, a couple shades darker than later batches of Beatification. The head crackles away almost instantly in a champagne-like fashion. The nose is rather acetic with a surprising amount of sour fruit character (strawberries came to mind). Very Rodenbach-like, minus any sweetness. It's similar on the tongue, with much more acetic acid than the other batches, very Flemish, very sour and puckering. Big tropical fruit flavors. Crisp dry mouthfeel, light-bodied, highly carbonated. Nearly a perfect sour in my opinion. The acetic character isn't something I'm always fond of, but it works beautifully here."
"Overall, this was just fantastic. Of the wilds I have had, I would put Isabelle above this, but Beatification is way better than Temptation IMO."
"D - Enjoyable, though I probably wouldnt have another right away. Though it's a nice wild brew"
"Overall, quite a very unique and well-made beer. While the sourness was dominant, it was not overpowering and was wonderfully counterbalanced with oak flavors. A must try."
"This is a fine beer. I probably wouldn't reach for it as much as some beers which are clearly lower rated and less fine examples of craftsmanship. But a lot of that is due to the price and the fact so few people I drink with enjoy sours."
"This beer pours a very clear amber with tiny bubbles, a 1 fingered head and minimal lacing. The smell is of sour cherries. For being barrel aged so long you can barely taste that flavor because the sour flavor is so powerful, yet good, I really enjoy this bottle. A very slick mouthfeel and for a sour certainly one of the more drinkable beers I have had."
"Sour Bomb! Add sour to sour and you get this beer. Newest batch, on tap at O'Briens SD for the 15th annv party. Not much of a nose, funk and brett a bit. Would go killer with food. Also very interested to see how this will age. Should the texture soften and the brett and other funk develope this could turn out to be something very special."
"D - Drinkability is great. This brew really hits all the characteristics I would look for in a wild ale. The oak adds a nice touch that comes through just stong enough to compliment the other flavors. You would think the low alcohol would make this one really easy to put away but this is one that should be savored and enjoyed slowly. Another home run for Russian River."
"D: This is really good. Had to almost chug my first one since I had to order 3 beers at a time and couldn't carry them all. The second time around I got to really get into the beer. This is my first time having this one, and it shows Vinnie really knows what he's doing. This with Supplication are my favourite RR sours. Edit 2/2010 - I just had some batch 2 of this that may be the best beer I've ever had, the complexity and flavour is incredible and delicious."
"I can see why some people might like this, and I respect that it's a difficult style to make, but holy cow..."
"The closest thing to a Belgian Gueze I've had from an American brewer. One of those beers that keeps you guessing, and sipping. Impressive complexity for the ABV. Although this may be one of the most impressive beers I've had in terms of brewing perfection, the price is tough to overlook. I'd sooner spend $24 on a good pinot or zin."
"D - RRBC makes great sours and this is no exception. Wish this were available all the time. Will I ever have a bad beer from them?"
"Flyer bought this in CA, and brought it over for a tasting at my house with SurlySober which also included Allagash Black, Gouden Carolous, and Westvleteren 12 (quite respectable, eh?)."
"Funky, complex, nicely done!"
"**RE-SAMPLE** Had my aged one on 9/14/09. Poured into a Duvel tulip so even more carbonation this time. Head was larger and stuck around a bit longer. Aroma was still funky but was more classic brett with the lemon and barnyard toned down a little but still great. Taste was also still amazing. Would leave scores the same if re-reviewing."
"375ml bottle from Capone's. My 100th rating of a beer brewed in California. Pours hazy straw yellow with no head. The aroma is an aggressive blend of citrus rind, hay or straw, funky cheese. The flavor is very tart and yogurt-ish. Just a little bit if malty sweetness left. Medium body with tons of carbonation and a bone dry finish."
"O - Amazing. Perfect. Wish I had someone to share this with."
"D- ok, it is very sour and i can see why some of the reviews say it is too sour but i feel this is exactly what it is suposed to be, a sour wild ale, this ids the style, great brew"
"Batch 003 in a 750mL bottle. Poured a hazy yellow with a fizzy head. Smell was vinegar & citrus with slight barnyard funk. The taste was menacing: Wonderful bitterness the entire duration of the sip. Tastes of funk & sour lemon. Drinkability was very good. I love sours because you get vast amounts of flavor for low levels of alcohol."
"Great beer. This was worth the wait to try. Hopefully I can manage to stay away from my other bottle for a few years and let it age."
"Drinkability is pretty high if your a fan of gueze, in that I wouldn't mind have this on a regular basis. Still, the extreme acidity makes it a very slow sipper and not something I want more then one bottle of in an sitting. Ever since I heard about their plans to make a 'sonambic', I knew I had to get my hands on some. While it's undoubtedly awesome, it's prohibitively expensive, which is really a shame, as it mean I'll have to really hoard my reaming bottles for special occasions, like another Christmas! This should age very well, if I can manage to hold onto it that is!!!"
"Pours a hazy light amber with a good head. Not much retention or lacing, but enough to get by. The smell is of tart fruit and just a general funky scent. Kind of like apple cider or some other cider. I actually do not have much experience with wild ales, but I really dig this. Some that I've smelled are a bit off-putting, but this one really smells good. The taste is really great. You could sort of describe it as sweet-tarts or pixie sticks. Also, there's a bit of a white wine kind of taste, white grapes and barrels. But there's a rush of sourness that is well-balanced with sweetness. There is a bit of a tart finish, but some brett beers are too tart. This one is just perfect. You get a good rush of carbonation along with the taste. I could really sip on this beer for hours and hours. The flavor is great, and the sourness will force you not to drink at a rate that will let the alcohol catch up to you."
"8/4/8/4/17 (4.1/5)"
"D - Pretty easy to drink and damn enjoyable. Some more age on it and it'll probably get much much better."
"D - Very tasty. Much more complex than just barnyard Brett."
"d) the finish is very smooth, so despite being heavy on the brett sourness, you are ready for more immediately"
"Tastes even stronger than it smells. Jesus! The sourness is amazing, so strong it should be synthetic but also smooth enough to drink. Likening it to other flavors is sort of pointless, since it doesn't quite taste like anything I've ever come across before, not even very sour candies. It's just a hugely intense, unique sourness backed up by smooth, lightly spicy yeast."
"I'm glad I tried it. I have one aging (we'll revisit in a year) but I doubt I'll be laying down $23 for another bottle."
"Not particularly good looking, but everything else about this beer is spectacular. Complex, yet crisp and refreshing; Highly recommended."
"This defines extreme beer, another good brew from Russian River."
"D: This is a really enjoyable wild ale, the mouthfeel is a bid lacking in my opinion but I'd often seek this beer out if I had ready access to it. Honestly though, if you're looking for sour, Cantillon's got this beat."
"D- In spite of how sour it was, this was extremely enjoyable. I can't wait to try it again!"
"[Batch 2] Poured a hazy golden color with a small, white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of brett, and that special Russian River funky blend, citrus fruits, wood, light vanilla, grapes, toffee, and lemongrass. Taste was sour, some citrus, green grapes, some apple, but damn that yeast Russian River uses really eats all the sugars, quite sour, like a fresh Cantillon or 3 Fonteinen."
"Pours golden with no head at all. A little cloudy. Smell is earthy and finishes sour. Tastes like tart cherries and maybe even some lemon in the finish. Does not taste as earthy as it smells. Drinkablity is only hurt by the acidic feel as it enters the stomach."
"Notes: This doesn't even compare to JP's Biere De Mars Grand Reserve in terms of tartness. That shit was ridiculous."
"Not as good as Supplication, perhaps a bit too sour almost, but it's still very tasty. I hope I get the chance to try some more RR sours sometime soon."
"Of the RRBC sours, I put this one last. It's a little too tart for my tastes. But that doesn't mean it's not an interesting one."
"Overall: Great beer by a great brewer. I have been wanting it for quite some time, and now I am satisfied. I WILL have this one again. If they ever make a Batch 3."
"D: I love most Russian River brews, and want to like this one, but I don't. Not very drinkable."
"Great beer."
"Very carbonated mouth. Light body. Definitely a sipper. Not sure of the occasion I would want to bust this one out for."
"Very nice overall."
"The taste was strange. Sour, funky, but delicious. Every sip got better. I passed the glass around and the general consensus was highly recommended."
"MK"
"Pours a murky golden amber in color. Decent head on the pour. Smell is very tart and funky. I had this right after drinking the Supplication and this is vastly more sour than the it. Perfect amount of carbonation. Very good citrusy, sour fruit flavors. Perfect amount of carbonation to go with the sourness. I very much prefer this to the Supplication. Highly recommend."
"MORE MORE MORE MORE!! Who is going to start putting out large volumes of American Sour so I can buy cases?!"
"Drinkability is good, not something you can down though."
"D : I'm ready to pucker up and have another. This is a great example of how you can take the tartness and funkyness to the extreme."
"not bad, but pricey for what you get. i expected a little more for a top 100 beer..."
"D: I really didn't write much for this review but ""wonderful pain"" was the only note I took. This was batch 002 which was spontaneously fermented. Really just an awesome beer. Would love to always have a bottle or two on hand."
"Pours an almost clear light amber, almost golden, thin bone white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around my new Bruery glass, drops some nice lace spots on the glass. Smell is badass, tons of oak and vinegar, lots of funky goodness, wine, vanilla, some honey and biscuity malty sweetness underneath the acidic lemons, almost a fresh floral character, kind of like a riesling, pretty awesome. Taste is intense, sweet and sour beginning when it kicks you in the tonge, more of a sweet wine, I get a lot of dry riesling character, fresh floral and honey notes, then the funky acidic character hits, like toasted lemons, vinegar, wood, very nice herbal sour finish, perfectly balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied, silky smooth, low carbonation, goes down insane easy for a sour. Not as much of a palate bruiser as I expected, just perfectly balanced sourness, tons of character, I could drink this stuff all day."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with orange-ish hues, with a small white head. In the aroma, tart like a sweettart, and a small vinegar note. In the taste, small fruitiness and tart, again kind of like a sweettart. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry tartness in the aftertaste. Fantastic, big sourness, small fruitiness, primarily lemon like citrus, and just a hint of oak."
"D: While this beer had some amazing qualities in both the aroma and taste departments it is just too sour to be supremely drinkable. After every sip if was burping and could feel the sourness collecting at the base of my throat, I drank this beer for over and hour and can easily say that one is enough even though it tastes quite good."
"Lacking complexity and balance to some extent, but still a very pleasant beer."
"A sipper, but not the slowest beer to drink. I must say I wasn't disappointed by the wild ales I've had from Russian River."
"D: A very interesting beer that would pair very well with food. I think all of Russian River's wild ales do a lot better when paired with some food that the acid will balance out with. Not something I enjoy sitting around and sipping on it's own."
"Cheers to abankovich for this brew in the TIF!"
"001, PH1. Light orange color with ample foam. Smells of bugs and critters, cobweb, damp barn, horse blanket, lemon and soaked wood. Flavor is strongly sour, super intense and woody, funky, wild and loaded with lemon and other fruits notes. Obviously a terrific and expertly crafted beer, but not one I'd like to collect. Supplication will always be my favorite Russian River brew."
"Shared this bottle with 4 other people thank God, including a guy at the table next to me (Belmont Station cafe) drinking some gueuze. He was quite grateful, noting the Beatification was much better then his gueuze. Perhaps. I just wish I had the capacity to appreciate it as much as he did."
"Nice hazy golden color. Not much head, I get about one finger in my snifter but it fades quickly. Scent is sour with lemon and vinegar, and plenty of funk. Flavor is fantastic. Awesome sourness, again lemon and vinegar, but hints of other fruit jumped out as well. I noted peach and pear, if you can imagine what those would taste like long before they're ripe. Funk is prominent as well. Feel is medium bodied a somewhat syrupy. Carbonation is good, and a nice dry finish. A sipper but surprisingly easy to drink, really. Alcohol is subdued and doesn't carry much of a punch. Overall drinkability is quite high. I was worried that this would just be a sour bomb, but the flavor was really nice and complex. Maybe I'm just getting used to these sour beers...I dunno. I still liked Temptation more, but this is another fantastic effort from Vinny and the crew."
"Pours a very slightly fogged gold with basically no head. Nose is citrus and sweet. The funk is there too. Flavor is, well... Flavor is holy ----! Sour to the core with evident citrus. Pretty amazing stuff. Feel has a light and smooth carbonation to it. Liquid is good. Lovers of sours unite! The American lambic lives!"
"D: Delightful. I would love to compare to a draft version and later an aged/cellar version. Very clean and sharp flavors and aroma. Refined recipe and unlike any other."
" The feel is light and crisp at first, then becomes much less lively pretty fast. Perhaps some oxidation has taken effect with this one?"
"Drinkability: Quite good, though I'd appreciate just a teensy bit of carbonation. I'd go so far as to say I'd cheerfully drink this each and every damn day. But sadly I don't have easy access to Russian River beers."
"d: Huge thanks to barleywinebrewer for the chance to try this one! I look forward to the chance to try more RR sours."
"Tastes soured brett. Puckering. Potent in the respect. Lactic and lemony. Like sucking on a fresh lemon wedge. Grapefruit and pineapple. Light crisp dry and clean. Great drinkability. Nice light summer quencher."
"6% abv batch 002. Thanks Todd1. This little masterpiece reminds me of a wild and also a geuze. Musty aroma, that at the end smells like a basement not aired. The taste, cradles the tongue, there is a fizz, and it becomes more and more..lemon. Amazing sediment in the last once of the bottle. Custard appearance."
"D: At 5.5%, the ale is low key and light but the blast of flavor could impair your tastebuds. The ale is wonderful, great innovation from Russian River."
"D: This is a wonderful beer. I could drink this beer at almost any time of the year. It's a very lively beer that goes down smooth and tastes delicious."
"A tasty wild ale, but not one of RR's best."
"D: While this is an interesting beer, I'm not totally in tune with the style yet....but I'm trying (I kept style in mind while rating)."
"Decided to crack open a bottle of Beatification, batch 002 for my 900th review. Pours straw colored, slightly hazy, and with no head. The smell is quite funky with lots of lemon sourness and great barnyard aromas. The taste is super tart up front, followed by a splendid funkiness with loads of horseblanket character as well as a dose of minerality. Ripe soft cheese and lemon on the finish. Smooth, tart, refreshing in the mouth. Delicious and the real deal. I shared a bottle of this with brickstoredave, and his comment was ""Wow, an American brewer made this beer?"". My thoughts exactly. What an accomplishment and one more reason Russian River is my favorite American brewery."
"Starts off refreshingly tart. Grapefruit and lemon citrus flavors flesh out the palate. Very acidic and dry. Earthy, musty edge to all the fruity sourness. Hints of hay and oak. Finish is incredibly dry with lingering grapefruit sourness. Moderate body with an almost sticky feel. Deliciously tart and earthy and refreshing!"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4"" bright white head over the totally cloudy golden brew. Head recedes to an uneven layer of bubbles, with ample small-bubbled lace. Aroma is tart bubblegum. Taste starts with a moderate tartness throughout the mouth, coupled with a light sweetness. Then the real character appears, piercing citric character, which rounds out at the close. Mouthfeel is silky soft and dry, and drinkability is impressive. A refreshing on a warm evening, for sure."
"Alas, if this is one of the best of the bunch for sours, I'm probably never going to be a big fan. Enjoyed Temptation and Supplication much more. I must say that it nails the description on the bottle and for the style."
"Pours a hazy gold with 1 finger of bubbly white head into a tulip glass. Head doesn't last very long, and leaves little lacing behind. Smells of Brett, green apples, lemon zest, cantaloupe, and vinegar. Taste starts out good and tart with plenty of green apples, lemon, and vinegar. Brett funk makes itself known as does notes of vanilla, but it never gets the sourness of some of the other RR Wild Ales, remaining tart and funky. Light in body with good fizzy champagne-like carbonation and lots of tartness and funk. Another extraordinary -ication from Russian River that is light, lower in alcohol, and packed with unique flavors."
"Definitely more earthy now."
"I've been waiting to try Beatification for a while and it truly delivers. I don't really know how to characterize this beer. It's art in a bottle. Everything about it is just so artfully crafted. I can't constructively criticize any aspect of this beer. I'm not convinced it can be any more well done than this. Coming from one who's not the biggest of sour fans, that's a huge compliment. Highly recommended."
"Upon the first sip, I realized that the aroma was misleading. It is very sour. The brett did it's job giving it that distinct sourness it loves to provide us with. Once the sourness subdues, there are definitely those fruity notes, giving it very much a wine-like quality. The green apple really shines along with some melon. The finish is sweeter than I expected it to be and lingers on nicely. As it warms the sourness subsides and the fruitiness comes out more, along with hints of bready malts and oak. it's very nice how this one transforms. The mouthfeel is light and with just a little carbonation. Overall, this is one excellent wild ale. Probably the best I've had."
"."
"D - Excellent, if you know what you are about to get yourself into. An extremely intense beer but an awesome wild ale."
"Russian River knows how to sour a beer just right! A+"
"Drinkability is moderate. The beer is sessionable, and flavor is great, but the sourness may overwhelm with time. A 375ml bottle is perfect."
"Hazy straw gold colour with a thin, whitish cap of fine bubbles that quickly settled to a thin collar. Short-lived, spotty stickage. Super funky aroma, salty and tart with lots of brett and barnyard character. Some vinegar and a bit of fruitiness added a lot of depth too. Leather and oak/wood appeared as it warmed. Fruity, sour and tart up front, sort of a berry quality, with a vinegar and salt flavour following close behind. Plenty of earthy funk, but not overpowering, plus a nice dose of oak. Puckering by the finish with lingering fruity tartness. Light bodied with lively carbonation, bordering on sharp. Oaky dryness too. Delicious! These wild ales are truly a work of art and this one didn't disappoint. I'm glad I have a couple more of these so I can see how they develop over time."
"Smells quite gueuzy with just a whiff of funk at first that seems to grow as it really warms. Not nearly as sour as batch 002 but still juicy and has a bit of sourness to it and the promised hint of grapefruit. Really easy to drink, smooth and delicious but a little subdued compared to the previous batch. I hope to buy more ""sonambics"" from this brewery."
"Taste is just as complex. At first I get a champagne like- tart, crisp flavor. Then the flavor sits on your toungue for a bit. I get the sour after that. sour fruits- especially apples. Amazing aftertaste lingers. Crisp, tart mouthfeel. I find it pretty drinkable for a sour, as I am pretty upset when I finish this beer- I can not wait to try the others from the RR wilds release!"
"Drinkability- Considering the sourness of this beer it's still amazing to me that something could be so tasty and drinkable. Although this one is (IMHO) ""the least best"" of the ""new 3"" batches of the aged Russian River brews, it's still really good. It's not as drinkable and nice as Temptation and not as unique and complex as Supplication but I suppose that's not the point. Big thanks to Matt for the help on these!"
"This Wild Ale really is out-freaking-standing and remains a spontaneously fermented work of art. Jammed packed with all the tartness and funk that you would expect from a beer like this but it is never overbearing and retains a fantastic drinkibility. God bless Vinnie and Russian River for beers like this!"
"I did not know what to expect with this one. For a beer aged 9-19 months in oak, very surprised that oak didn't dominate the flavor."
"i've left the yeast/critters in the bottle, but plan on drinking that soon. excuse me if i cut out now - i'd like to savor the last few sips of my original pour before i dump in the haziness."
"Round 2 is great. never had a chance to try round 1 but this is worth the effort to get! Huge thanks to a friend for the assist on this one!"
"Thanks to Intiqken for letting me get this shipped to him."
"Pours a bright yellow, quite hazy. Slow pour resulted in a white head that quickly disappeard to nothing. No lacing. Champagne like carbination. Very funky vinegar-like aroma. Taste is nicely sour - almost like an unsweetened sour apple lemonaide..if you could imagine such a thing.Very light in the mouth; easy to drink. This was my first sampling from RR and I'm thrilled to have had a chance to try it."
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange with a stark white head. Nose is tart brett funk and some light fruitiness. Taste follows with awesome brett funkiness and super tart green apple flavors. underlying wood flavor is good and lingers quite a bit along with the green appley tartness. Nice Geuezy flavor also. very complex. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, good carbonation, and a nice viscosity for the style. Drinkability is unbeatable for the style. This is one of few sour beers I could see myself drinking more than one of. Excited to see how this one cellars. Fantastic concoction by Vinnie and the crew. Great beer."
"If only I had the same kind of access to the Russian River beers as I do to the Lost Abbey. If even they were even a little further away. A four hour drive. A five hour drive. Each and every one of the Russian River beers had something to fucking say. The Beatification of all had the most intense things to say, just extremely funky and flowery on the nose. When I popped it open it smelled like diapers or something, heavily stank cheese, I screamed, I passed it around, I got stoked. This was the overall champion of the night for me by a long shot, part of a very small (4 people) Russian River tasting. Beatification is a barrel aged and ""spontaneously fermented"" beer, brewed with wild yeast and then aged in barrels which have been used for both its original purpose and for making other beers that Russian River offers, meaning that it has a whole lot of life in the wood that contributes an insane amount of complex flavor to the beer. This beer has a list of the known yeast and bacteria strains present in the beer, which beyond being geeky is so insane that you can't just love it if you're interested in the science and alchemy of brewing. Poured beautifully from the mini-Champagne like bottle with a cork and cage and it really is like an intense spoiled semi-brute Champagne that could only come from Belgium, except that it's from California. Infected, golden, attractive. Russian River makes the beers that are closest to those from the motherland, with the perfect amount of American screw-all attitude to boot. This is so much like a Gueuze that it's hard to believe it's not, and it's in the same family as the Leelanau and Jolly Pumpkin beers which are so overtly ""out there"" that you can't help but listen up. Highest, highest respect for this brew, heavy dog compliments."
"Overall, an excellent sour ale, a must-try for those who really like this style. Not something I'd want to drink everyday but it offers a textbook example of the unique complexity to be had form these barrel-aged sour beers."
"It's awesome that we've got an American brewer making strides like this with sour, barrel-aged brews. But you knew that."
"I've wanted to try this beer for well over a year-and-a-half, and I have to say, it was well worth the wait. One of the best beers I've ever had. I couldn't think of a better special occasion beer. I need to get some more bottles of this asap!"
"Pours a foggy toasted gold with a thin half finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. No lacing at all with this one. Swirling the glass leaves some webs, but they quickly fall back down seconds after. Smell is heavy on the funk, go figure! Sour cherries, white grapes, brett, lemongrass, and oak. After a big whiff, the vinegar becomes present, but doesn't overpower any of the other wonderful complex aromas. Taste begins very tart and sour followed by the smooth oak, sweet tangerine and green apples. Aftertaste is a bit dry with sour grapefruit, some honey, and wood characteristics. So much flavor for such a low abv beer. Light to medium body with a stinging carbonation. Beatification is by far the most sour of the RR brews that I've had, maybe too sour? I'd take Supplication and Sanctification over this, but Beatification is still an amazing beer. Hopefully I can get my hands on another bottle so I can throw it in the cellar. Thanks again Josh for hooking me up!!"
"Overall I was simply blown away by this one. It was easily the best sour ale I have ever had, and easily one of the best beers I have ever had hands down. I can now see why people rave about this one as much as they do, it really is that good. It has a light texture to it that is unmatched, and the Brett, is just perfect. Go out and get this if you are a fan of the style, if its not your thing, and you do not like the style, you are not going to like this, it's the epitome of the style. Simply astounding."
"S: Pretty damn amazing. I'm constantly amazed at my palates' ability to evolve. A year and a half ago I would've sworn this was spoiled. Now, I'm loving the sour beers!"
"D - a very nice beer to enjoy, one bottle at a time. i really like this stuff."
"Drinkability is good. This is a beer I have wanted to try for quite some time now. Incredibly interesting and unique tasting. But one bottle is easily more than enough. I probably should have waited to share this bottle with someone. I really like this, but I prefer Sanctification, Compunction, and Temptation to this one. I just found those to be easier to drink. That's not to slight this one at all... Beatification is another Russian River home run."
"Mouthfeel is so darn clean. Nothing is left in the palate. We had cheese and mushrooms, this cleaned the mouth right up. I wish it would be more redily available. Petrus rates way below this one."
"D- My least favorite of the RR sours but still a good beer thats worth trying."
"D: Very drinkable for the style I suppose. I'm not sure I'd have two, but it is refreshing. It's not as clean as many lambics, but it tastes good."
"Same perfect mouthfeel I've come to expect from RR. Carbonation is exceptional, finish is long yet dry, and drinkability is through the roof for a sour beer lover, like me."
"Definitely demands a lot of your palate. Delicious."
"I'm happy to have had this experience and will enjoy watching others try it. I will probably wait for the next 'ation' though."
"A beer that is beer well done."
"Pours a faintly hazed yellowish color with light whitish head. Smell is bright, lightly funky and sour, yet soft overall. Taste is much of the same mild tartness, oaky dryness and very pleasant funkiness. Very easy to drink, now that I'm more accustomed to sours. This is really nice stuff, and very mild compared to some."
"And now I'm sad cause it's gone. Looking forward to the next batch coming in soon!"
"One of the best beers I have ever had, just slightly under Toronado 20th Anniversary Ale from this same brewer, which probably contained a good amount of this stuff in its blend, pretty much flawless in my opinion, will try to get a case of the next batch in a few months but this beer is in very high demand so I might be driving up north on its release date, I cannot recommend this beer enough, true masterpiece"
"Edit: When you drink this beer, pour the yeast into the last sip. It is excellent."
"PH1 acquired directly at the brewery about a year and a half ago. Aged at 45F ever since. Pours clean and simple with a nice thick head that dissipates quickly. Nice tight carbonation. Sour and brett up in the front of the tongue, super clean finish at the end. Very wonderfully complex, low alcohol and drinkable. 10/10 on the belgian ""digestability scale"". Outstanding."
"I've had this beer quite a few times now in various different stages of it's development. At first from a wooden cask via a wine thief at the brewery. Than a test batch flowing at some god-forsaken beer festival. And finally in it's bottled form, in both the PH1, and 'regular' 001 editions. This beer pours a slightly hazy light golden colour with a large, tight, and compact head of foam that slowly loosend up, expands, and releases the aromas of this magnificent 'neo lambic' creation. This beer has the classic sharp, acidic, traditional lambic aromas that I adore. Balsamic vinegar, cheese, fresh white winter truffles, morbier dipped in lemon juice, etc. A very vinous and lactic sourness is also detectable, moreso in the darker tinged PH1 batch, than the straight 001, I should add. The taste is pungent and acidic with a wonderful fruity wine-like middle that smooths out the 'in-your-face-nature' of this brew and leaves you with a lovely aftertaste on the front and back of your tongue. The mouthfeel is creamy, super smooth, and reminiscent of the Cantillon St. Lamvinus. The drinkability is perfect and this super sour funky american neo lambic is definately one of the most coercive and notion challening brews to ever have passed this BAS' lips. Bravo to Vinnie and Co. For making something truly magical on all levels."
"Bottom line: This may be my favourite offering from RR to date and I've had a fair sampling...all were, imho, outstanding. I still say RR may be the best brewery in America. Beatification is another brew that does them proud! Highly highly recommended!!"
"This beer was superb, sorry I don't have more notes on the flavor characteristics, but I have to write what I have down so I don't forget that I must buy this by the case in california when I visit."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly light and has a nice tingly carbonation to it."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. Pour from a 375mL. Fresh Meyer lemon spritz sour tang, with salty honey-ginger crispness. Sweet and bright aroma. Lightly hazed thin, with soapy off-white rim. Flavor a perky, brightly sweetened brettesque. Passionfruit and almond skins, yielding to grapefruit juice tartness. Nice percolation and stunning lightly hoppy finish. A different batch carried a whole world of earthy spice and robustness that took it to another level of excellence. Outstanding."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a lively, light carbonation that rushes across the palate with each sip. Really makes drinking this brew enjoyable. I wish this came in a 750ml bottle as I could easily and throughly enjoy the whole bottle myself. Beatification ranks with the best Russian River brews I've had and to be honest the best brews I've had overall. Cheers to Vinnie, Peter at NB and everyone else at RR that made this brew possible. Quite an achievement!"
"Batch 001. Pours a hazy peach color, nice and cloudy, with a small white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is strongest of tart apples that is balanced by a soft sweetness and at times smells of homeade applesauce. Aroma also shows some bready spices that blends with a grapey sweetness, also some black pepper and grassiness as well. A hint of the sweetness and spiced breadiness flashes at the front of the tongue before a good sized appley tartness enters and a lemony sourness follows. The taste finishes with a nice drying of the palette. Mouthfeel is fairly light in body, the tartness keeps it very refreshing, a nice dance of peppery carbonation on the tongue does so as well. The aroma was definitely complex and where its at for me with this beer. The taste because of the tartness was not as complex but was still very thirst quenching and very refreshing and easy to sip on. Thanks Mark for the opportunity."
"Poured out a yellow orange color with a white head that quickly dissipated, but left bits of lacing. Smell was sour and vinegar-like; it had barnyard funk as well, but not as powerful, full of pleasant sour aromas. The taste seems to have a bit of lemon and oak beneath the strong sour flavors. I'm not real experienced with Wild Ales, but this one just tasted awesome. It also had tastes of vinegar and ends up with a dry, sour finish. Lighter side of medium body with a dry finish; carbonation is rather high. This is definately one of the better beers I've had and has changed my mind on what sour beers can be. I would definitely drink this again, unfortunately I'll have to wait until the next batch comes out."
"The beer pours out beautiful head that has a good lacing. The color is very nice light yellow. The smell is powerful and full of great smells, the best smell I have had in a long time. The taste is great, smooth, with lots of full flavor. The smell of horse blanket and different sour flavors are very non-offensive and just wonderful. They come together to make a really great flavor. The mouthfeel was sooo smooth and impressive, it was very nice and smooth. Overall I will drink this again sometime, very very good."
"Overall impression: Very nice sour beer - nice to see Russian River and New Belgium teaming up - this is a great example of an American brewer producing belgian styles."
"I've had many a sour beer and for me, this is easily one of the most pleasing. Right up there with it's cousin, La Folie. Considering Vinnie Cilurzo's been brewing for such a short period of time compared to the Belgian's that have supposedly mastered this style, he gives them a real run for their money. The quality of American brewed Belgians is becoming akin to when Napa started turning out better wines than the French."
"Drinkability & Notes - It's been awhile since I wrote a review, but figured this one was worth it. It isn't as good as the first batch, it lacks the same drinkability and complexity, but it is still one of the most distinct and interesting American sour ales out there. Thanks to Dyan for the bottle."
"Many thanks to Vinnie for such a great brew as well as New Belgium for donating the barrel for this gem."
"I've said this before about a another American wild ale from the east coast funkmasters at The Alchemist, those Geuzestekerijses (don't even know if you can put that in plural) better get off their laurels because in a decade or so their American cousins just might muscle in on their racket..."
"Hazy gold, a fizzy, active white head forms on the pour, fizzing down to nothing like cola. Kinda like champagne. The aroma hides in the glass, probably due to the lack of head. Sour and tropical, reminiscent as Jim said of those canned Goya juices. Mango, in particular. Milder lactic funk, like swiss cheese. The flavor follows suit, with boisterous carbonation holding things together and keeping it exciting. The fuller body keeps it feeling somewhat mellow. For a sour ale, this is very drinkable. Fuller bodied than I expected, starting off with a juicy sweetness reminiscent of peach of mango juice, the pulpy kind, moving into a modestly sour and lactic finish. Slight cheese presence, big on the fruit juice. Nice and funky in a mellow way. I think it's good. I'd love to see this again with a couple more years on it."
"Batch 001. Light sunny orange color, with minor haziness. Frothy light head is about half-inch and is well sustained. Nice streaming carbonation visible. Spotty lace remained. Sour apple and pear in the nose, just a really funky tart aroma all around, acidic, vinegar-like. The taste is intensely sour and it immediately begins to dry out through the finish leaving only a touch of bitterness. Light hints of apple, lemon and orange fruit present, with a mild woody taste. Part way through the glass the flavor softens a bit and is very easily drinkable. Sharp carbonation and a light body, there is a superb fluffy/creamy mouthfeel. This and the PH1 are both great offerings. Highly recommended..."
"Pours out a murky orange with a fizzy tall white head of foam. The head stayed together awhile leaving rings of lace around the glass. Funky brett yeast notes come on pretty strong with a nice mix of fruit sweetness and a balancing light tartness. Some woody notes are in the mix as well. The flavor kicks off with some tart fruit and a light sweetness. Funky yeast and notes of wood add a nice depth of complexity. Lingering tart fruitness lingers at the finish. Well carbonated body and quite refreshing. Really drinkable stuff as well, almost too much so. I wish it was a 750ml bottle or bigger. A very unique and delicious beer that I would love to have available all the time."
"Thanks again to Darren for the sample. MUCH appreciated."
"Drinkability- Well, I timed this one about perfect. Sat here on an early evening night in Broadview, Montana...nothing but vast farmland as far as the eyes can see. A few antelope over here, a few partridges over there and a cow or two mooing in the background...not to mention the bats starting to fly into the barn and the two hoot-owls going at it. Ahhh, all this in the middle of a thunderstorm. Review #999 and taking a 8 month or so beer respite as of bedtime this Sunday....only have a Dreadnaught in waiting for my last beer in my self imposed beer break due to my wife's pregnancy. This was about the perfect beer today. Great taste, incredibly refreshing due to the higher humidity today. Russian River scores again. Vinnie...thanks for making one of my last brews for a while a memorable one. Extreme highest of recommendation!!"
"This is fantastic. It's nice to find such a high quality sour beer being produced in the States. Too bad it doesn't find it's way out of CA, unless if I have agents working for me while on vacation. Just spectacular."
"It would be interesting to taste this along side Redemption which is where this started and also with the PH1 to test the subtle differences in each. Vinnie and Natalie hit this one out of the park as they do with so many of their beers. A real winner, too bad there is not much of this out there."
"A homerun by Vinnie and Natalie and the rest of the RR crew."
"edit:This was batch 001 (can't wait for more!!)"
"Mouthfeel is fizzy, a bit overly carbonated, with a dry, tart, champagne like medium body."
"I think they are the best brewers in the world, but thats just me. Simply staggering."
"While it is not as challenging or complex, I really like it for its aggressive straight forward tartness. The dominant tartness is joined by a touch of malt character, some austere fruit notes and perhaps a wisp of funk. Another characterful brew from what is fast becoming one of my absolute favorite breweries."
"Quite good!"
"A great beer nonetheless, but Batch 001 takes it over the slightly more expensive ($1 more per 375cl bottle) Batch 001-PH1 for my money."
"D - Not a problem. I love it."
"I may be in the minority on this, but I preferred the 001 over the PH1. They are both absolutely amazing beers, and I do enjoy sour beers. I just preferred the fact that sourness dissipated on the tongue quicker on the 001 than the PH1, allowing you to pull the other amazing flavors from the beer. I've had a pretty wide selection of Russian River beers, and besides the Pliny's, this has been by far my favorite to come from them. You'd do well to try and get some of these."
"Not many notes on this, but it was freakin good."
