Finish leaves a lingering lemon flesh sourness. Has just a touch of white wine barrel to it, cherry skin and just a breath of funk on the finish. Doesn't carry the funk of something like 3F Oude Gueuze and doesn't have the sourness of a beer like Cable Car, but it's fantastically rounded and just keeps pummeling you with a variety of flavors, none of them bad. An absolutely phenomenal beer. So glad I finally got to try this.","notchucknorris","Oct 13, 2014"

Heavy notes of lemon zest, green apple, and funky notes of hay and farm.  The taste is moderately tart with a nice layer of funky complexity. Notes of oak come in and play  nicely with the funk qualities.  Reminds me of an authentic Belgian gueuze.  Mouthfeel is effervescent and light.  Overall, a very tasty American take on a gueuze.","homebrew311","Sep 29, 2014"

I believe people when they say this and Beatification are better than Cable Car, and I'm very happy to have the opportunity to try a good one-third of a 750ml bottle of this to dissect and enjoy.

The newer '13 is still too young, as it's a bit harsh with too much acidity in the way of the flavors. The '09, however, has matured nicely and reminds me of some aged gueuze here in Belgium. A soft, integrated and refined sour that was very much enjoyed all around. Not to offend the newer bottling, but most people at the tasting agreed the older vintage was superior; I certainly would have scored it a 4+. Thanks again for bringing this pair along. Lots of fun man!","Jeffo","Jan 21, 2014"

4.41,-4.5,4,4.75,4.5,3.75,4.25,"2013 vintage. a beer thats been high on my list (and everyone elses) for what seems like forever. hazy pale yellow in color it definitely looks the part under a fizzy pure white head that dies down right away. the nose on this is just incredible. its so so sour. citric lemon acidity at first, followed by a relaxed bacterial farmhouse saison mustiness and a mellowing oak aspect. white wheat malt is not sufficient to balance the sour, and its not really supposed to be. tartness all the way in the smell and my eyes almost water from the intensity of it all. the taste starts out just like the nose with more of a lemon than a bacterial vibe, but the drying sourness comes in hot, and aided by the carbonation, almost hurts the palate, certainly the jawline. the oak is big here, and it needs to be. it gives more depth and body than the malt does seemingly. my one critique of this is in the feel. while it has awesome carbonation, it does have some residual sugar that keeps this drinking a little heavier, and far less dry and clean than the classic gueuzes of belgium. maybe this is to do with the blending, maybe it needs more time, im not sure, but the finish in terms of feel is off. more vinegary sourness than lactic, i like it a lot, and i am stoked to have finally tried it, but im not sure i would put it in the top 25 beers in the world as others have.","StonedTrippin","Jan 15, 2014"

Huge yet not overwhelming puckering tartness starts things off along with dryness and woody funk notes. The brew is pretty musty and dry with a perfect balance between the tartness and the funk. Amazing tasting sourness that isn’t overwhelming with a great crisp, clean and fluffy body. Overall, this is one of the better sours I’ve had out there. It is clean and not too overwhelming but has some amazing fruit tartness balanced by some nice fruit sweetness.","JoEBoBpr","Jan 05, 2014"

Had it via taster and bottle, although I feel the bottle was better than what was poured from the tap. This is probably the best Wild Ale (or technically 'a geueze but really not a geuze' bc not in Belgium). Yes, there's a lot of hype with DDG, but well deserved. Would I pimp slap an angry football player for seconds? Yes, I would. Now the review: carbonation is perfect and a very clean mouthfeel. Tasty as hell with a long and the right amount of sour finish. Very well composed and should improve with age, which is scary to think of its potential.","SaltySizzle","Nov 21, 2013"

A lot going on in the nose, mainly funkadelics, earthy, bretty, aromas of horseblanket, lemon zest and apple peel, leaving no doubt that this will have some sourness to it. Very acidic on the palate, almost too much actually, nearly wrecking. After adjusting for a moment or two, out come flavors of acidic citrus and sour stone fruits, lemon drops, lesser notes of earthy funk, horseblanket, distant crackery malts. Dry and crisp mouthfeel, medium body, and--if you conquer that initial blast of palate-wrecking acidity--a pretty easy drinker for the style. Pretty good overall, but not worth trading an arm and a leg for.","Rifugium","Nov 16, 2013"

It was a great beer to have when standing around with a few hundred other whale hunters in a 90 degree plus warehouse sweating. As far as other sour beers out there this one is mild. Is this beer worth the Whale status? No. But is a really good beer none the less. Recommended.","Psyko","Sep 01, 2013"

Phenomenal aromas of funk, lemon juice, oak, green Granny Smith apples, and wet hay. Very acidic and sharp, but in the best possible way. Reminds me quite a bit of Cable Car. Taste follow the nose nicely, very acidic flavors of lemon juice, green apple, and tropical fruit with a bit of oak and a whole lot of funk. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with a fairly light body and good, sharp carbonation. Just the right amount of dry sourness here, it doesn't strip the enamel off your teeth.

3.05,-34,4,4,2.5,2.5,3,"This beer is a very pale, hazy straw yellow with a very slight ring of egg shell foam. The beer smells wild and bretty with a little fresh lemon. The beer starts out pleasantly sour and tart with good lemon and green apple flavors, but the finish is pure viengar. The viscous, mouth-coating, saliva-stripping, mouth pucker acidity. It is a combination of astrigent (like biting into underripe apples) and vinegar was very unappealing. This beer is wildly drying for a liquid. This is an okay beer, not the worst sour I've ever had, but it does not live up to the hype at all. I'm glad to have gotten to try it, but it's nothing I would actively seek out again.","Soonami","Aug 27, 2011"

Overall, HOLY DUCK-FACE BATMAN!!! This thing was drop-kick your momma sour! Just the way I like it.... The fruit character in this one tries despirately to subdue the sour/tart aspect going on here, but it never stood a chance. Funk too? Hell yeah...

Smells sour and a bit cheesy but i would not say funky at all. In fact this does not smell like a true gueuze at all. The taste was way too sweet and then followed by a sourness. The sweetness was almost like a pixie stick or sweet tart and I didn't like that aspect at all.There was some citrus and fruit but to call this a gueuze is just not being honest. As a wild ale this was ok but the price was completely out of line for the beer that is in the bottle. Save your money and get a Cantillon for half the price.","ArrogantB","Jun 05, 2011"

Cloudy honey pour with an amazing amount of carbonation for the style producing a 1/4 inch ivory head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma of peaches, balsamic, citrus rind, and grapes.

4.88,5.6,5,4.5,5,5,5," The flavors are citrusy with orange and lemonade puckering taste yet there is a light dry taste w/ mild wood and gentle lactic accents. The taste of the wood gives a dry flavor with light lemony acidity following and subtle oak w/ hints of white grape combine to give a mild astringent edge to the smooth malt and fruit from the yeast- the green grape and hints of bitter citrus blend with the tannic flavor from the wood as it finishes. There is an almost peachy floral and tropical sweetness in the background which is very pleasant and adds to the complexity of the barrel to offset some of the dry elements in the taste. Duck Duck Gooze is as good as I remember from having it at Extreme Beer Fest 2 years ago -it may even be better - the beer has a lot of complexity and wonderful flavors for a 5% wild ale- this was very memorable and well worth the effort to acquire - I wood seek this out again.","Slatetank","Feb 15, 2011"

Aroma is acetone, highly lactic, eggy, sweaty goat fur. I didn't get much brett funk this one just smells sour. Taste has degraded. Eggy, lactic acidity, acetobacter (has a bigger presence). I'm getting a noticeable amount of vinegar that is hurting it's flavor and drinkability. Lemon tartness and high level of sourness is still there. The vanilla sweetness has disappeared or being overpowered by acidity. I felt this used to be a really good beer but seems like it has peaked.

I was expecting some funk to come along but instead there is almost a collapse of the palate close to the back. No tartness in the corners of the mouth you might expect with other, usually fruit, flavored lambics. The body of the beer is pretty thin, minimal carbonation in the mouth but its there. If you hold the beer there for a moment it begins to burn around the gums and behind the lips. The beer is very sour and minimally bitter. Finishes cleanly, probably due to the lack of back palate tart and funk. A great beer overall and a great sour. Thanks again Matt.","drabmuh","Jul 26, 2010"

First sip is tart, funky and acidic but soon rushed into a very fruity blend... mango, apprico, lemon, pineapple... lots of stuff going on there. Slight biscuty sweetness and hints of the vanilla and oak also present. Medium bodied, active carbonation, dry.

Looks a bit lighter than medium in build and there is no head at all from the tap, no lacing. Smells include big musk of barn with horse and hay. A big basket of lemons and assorted fruits. Oak, wood and some musty aroma with a dousing of brett, maybe lacto? Smells like it's going to be sour. And it is, a nice sour gueuze. I had this out of the bottle young and can tell it's only growing in funk. Taste is tart lemon drops with apricot and small pineapple blast. Warming brings a bit of apple to the stage. In the middle a earthy taste with oak tannins but not any vanilla which is ok by me. The sourness is pleasant and a bit acidic, but not quite there yet. There is actually a nice faint sweetness going along with the sour in that order. Puckering, yes, overly puckering, no. Quite balanced. Medium bodied and nicely carbed. Crisp and semi dry I 'll take another please. Id like to see where this goes in a year or two but the chances of getting another bottle are slim. Another winner.","BARFLYB","Jun 10, 2010"

Lots of effervescing activity on this one as evidenced by clusters of tiny bubbles adhering to the sides of the glass below the cap; no lacing. Nose is slightly tart and sour with tropical fruits coming out (pineapple, star fruit, etc.)? Taste follows nose - slightly acidic and dry, tart light fruit and a hint of cork. Mouthfeel was very lively and consistent throughout. Finishes dry with some astringency around the salivary glands. This was extremely delicious and even quite refreshing and palette cleansing, even with the incredible fruit profile. This is sour, but not puckeringly so - one of the most memorable beers I've yet to experience.

By and large this isn't an explosion of flavor but that isn't what I was looking for. This is a well crafted, sour beer that makes for pleasant, easy drinking.

However, that didn't happen and the finish to the beer was a little too weird for me with the subtle sweetness I was picking up. It's a well made beer, but as a person that craves sours every now and then, this definitely doesn't satisfy my fix. For a $30 price tag, I'd much rather stick to Cantillons, which are cheaper and better IMO.","rhinos00","Nov 14, 2009"

The tart citrus is delicious. Oak is evident. I enjoyed this bottle immensely more than I enjoyed my tap sample. The finish is acidic citrus with a lingering tartness and lactic sourness. This stuff is killer, and so damn drinkable. I'd venture to say this is one of my favorite American Wild Ales and a marvel of blending. Highly recommended.

4.6,-0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I've had this a couple of times now, last time a bottle I split with my wife. Just a fantastic brew, and everything I was looking for in the style. Sure, its still on the young side and exhibits more of the acetic and lactic notes than it does the barnyard at this juncture, but I like that too. Really its a matter of taste. The analogy that comes to mind is that of a soft, washed rind cheese- do you like it ripe, runny, and rank, or do you like it a little firmer, slightly sour, and just a bit piquant? Same with wild ales for me. I like them both ways, and I think one can have a classic in either maturity level. This particular beer is a classic for me in the younger, tarter vein. This pours a hazy yellow with a thin wispy head that sticks around. Smells beautifully balanced with sour acetic, lactic, and bright fruit- the fruit components showcase orange, tangerine, and muscat. Just beautiful. The taste has a long lactic finish, bright citrus, and some light funk coupled with nice firm tannins from the oak. The mouthfeel is lactic and punchy with enough tannins to give some structure to the sour fruit. Great beer, and a testament to what Lost Abbey can do when eveerything goes well.","Georgiabeer","Sep 30, 2009"

Extremely dry and sour and very refreshing. Nice earthy oak presence with subtle vanilla characteristic. Pretty well balanced with pleasant light fruit nuances that counter the extremely sour funky notes. Bone dry sour puckering finish. Actually pretty drinkable after the initial palate shock. Probably not worth the $30 price tag but still very good. Recommended.","corby112","Sep 18, 2009"

Funky, horsey and sour aroma with a tart orange juice element. A nice level of sour in the flavor. Not as sour as the better Belgian Gueuzes, but with a similar character of funk and lemon. Pretty good stab at a gueuze, but I couldn't help thinking that I would rather go out and buy the real thing for less money.","bulletrain76","Sep 15, 2009"

4.35,-5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Golden with a slight haze. Two fingers of head rises from vigorous pouring and retains fairly well, ultimately settling to a thick disc around the rim of the glass. The nose is complex but balanced, barnyard funk backed by lemon and orange-like acidity, lactic sourness, acetic acid, and a unique tropical fruit sweetness that really makes the beer. Opens on the palate with sharp lactic acidity and well-expressed tannins. Fruit flavors of pineapple, orange and lemon add interesting complexity. Moderate acetic presence mid-palate, woody and lightly astringent, with the malt coming out a bit more, lending a light sweetness that leads into a dry, sharp and tannic finish. The noticeable acetic quality is a slight detraction, but I love the strong tropical fruit character. Another winner for Lost Abbey; they should really concentrate on these barrel-aged sour beers, they're often excellent.","largadeer","Sep 04, 2009"

This substitutes very nicely for a traditional Belgian-sourced Lambic and I so wish I had a bunch of bottles of this. For those who like a more integrated faux Lambic, this beer will be enjoyed a bit more than the fresh Isabelle Proximus. Comparing these fresh though, I liked the additional complexity of the Isabelle Proximus (funkiness and oak were more prominent in the first beer released). This is still quite a fine beer though and it serves as proof that the funky beers at Lost Abbey are still strong and full of life.","Gueuzedude","Aug 24, 2009"
