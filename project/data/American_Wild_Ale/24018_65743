4,-3.8,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a hazy blonde color ale with a medium size foamy head with limited retention and not much lacing. Aroma of tart and oak notes with some light funky ester is quite nice. Taste is also dominated by tart and oak notes with some funky ester with low level of acidity. Hops presence had pretty much disappeared which is no surprised considering the age of the bottle. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Quite complex beer that retained some good drinkability.","Phyl21ca","Sep 08, 2014"

This is a refreshing and surprisingly drinkable brew for a 10.2% abv tag. Does not seem like it at all.

The nose on this brew is strong and has a lot of sourness right out of the gate with a some funk; some oak and maybe some tart citrus rind, grass/hay, earthy. The flavor kicks like a mule though and is face-melting sour...but in a good way! This is a massively sour ale with plenty of funk and on the finish some more subtle notes of the farm, earth, grass and hay.

There's decent lacing and some flecks of sediment on the bottom. Buttery whiskey and vinous oak presence upfront, funky citrus, and some booze dominate the nose. However, the beer's citrusy tartness is amplified in the taste, leaving a strange orange juicy concentrate mix of spirit barrel caramel/vanilla and tannin bitterness. This beer is thick, medium bodied with modest bitterness, citrusy sweetness, a distinct alcohol presence towards the finish, and residual bitter/semi-sweet finish. The beer definitely reminds me of bottleworks 14 from cascade, and I'd say this is safely in second by comparison.","ThePorterSorter","Dec 28, 2013"

You can definitely pick up the whiskey and wine oak aging on top of the funky sourness and earthy barnyard qualities. Wrapping all these flavors is a hop blanket that weaves in and out of all the flavors and lingers on your palate. This is just an all around fantastic beer. None of the flavors overpower you, the sour fruits and barnyard funk hit the right notes with the hoppy bitterness and oak keeping everything in tune.

Damn nice balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and barrel flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with an acidic, moderately crisp, slick, and earthy mouthfeel that is nice.

4.27,2.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"the rare find as most american sours seem to be. whiskey and wine barrel aged. sour with a wonderful nose and a sour mash whiskey quality to it. nose is sauvignon blanc, funk, and hint of melon and horseblanket undertones. palate is actually much more sour than expected. quite bright. but balanced. very dry with that sour whiskey mash note and hints of whiskey noted coconut. nice buttering that comes forth grassy... wonderful. one to share.","rtepiak","Apr 20, 2012"

3.77,-9.4,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured from bottle into JK farmhouse glass. When opened, barely even a hiss. Notably lacking carbonation. With a little bit of a rough pour, some head rises off the top of the beer, but it goes away quickly. This beer is indeed flat-ish. Other than that, a nice orange/yellow color, with some cloudiness. Smell- tart and sweet, nice vinous aroma from the barrel. Some funky bouquet as well. Taste- puckering sour with a salty dry finish. Tastes like sea salt meets sour patch candy. No ABV is present at all, for 9% it is well hidden. With carbonation, this would have been way better, but still a nice effort from JK, albeit not my fav sour from them (Das Wunderkind).","lnashsig","Apr 13, 2012"

4.15,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"d - good, but it is a bit winey sweet, like a very fruity white wine. It has an overall refined profile, the flavor are interesting and unusual but seems carefully balanced. The wild yeast is kept in check, not too much earthy medicinal funk.","jefe2","Feb 22, 2011"
4.27,2.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I really love this. Again, well done Jester King. Just an excellent Saison. I am not sure if I like this as much as Boulevard's Saisons at the moment, but I would hate to live on the difference. Highly recommended.","champ103","Feb 05, 2011"
