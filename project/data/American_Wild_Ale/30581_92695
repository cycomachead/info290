Some light sour dark cherry aroma follows with some hints of vanilla tannin and a slight toffee malt that is somewhat hard to detect through all the acidity. Taste follows nose with a nice acidic sour flavor forward followed by notes of tart dark cherries, oak, vanilla, vanilla toffee caramel and a slight bourbon presence in the finish.

The aroma has hints of chocolate before giving in to a fruity essence of cherry and bacterial funk. Some mineral character is present in the flavor along with tart cherries and a backing of the previously mentioned chocolate malt. Its medium bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall it was decent with a fair balance of malt verse tartness. However, it was not as glorious as some have made this out to be. Despite the description sounding wonderful, I really dont think its worth the price.","stakem","Oct 01, 2014"

No head at all after three minutes in the snifter. Small carb bubbles still rising to the top. More bourbon than tart on the nose. No chocolate or coffee in this style so the bourbon has a little more room to stand out. Bourbon to start with a faint boozienss. A very crisp tart finish. Not completely sour, just some cherry tart. Really nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is pretty standard for a sour. Thin an heavily carbonated. For me, this doesn't do well with the bourbon. Missing some of that savory bourbon velvet that I have come to enjoy in  many BBL beers. Overall, this is very good but I'm partial to the bourbon influence in many beers. I'm glad I got to have it but it's not something I would go out of my way to get again. Just nothing really awesome about it.","ILMbrew","Sep 28, 2014"

I am just starting to venture into the Belgians/sours/etc so this looked a little intimidating when it arrived. I am NOT a fan of red wine. Anyways, poured from 500ml bottle into my snifter. 1/4 finger of off white head over a dark (nearly black) body with a slight reddish hue. Not huge on the nose (though more came out as warmed to room temp.) mainly a slight sour note, cherry, and a bit of oak. The taste was excellent... a hint of cheery up front, followed by a stronger cherry and oak hit, wrapped up in a slight red wine haze. Just a bit, just enough red wine flavor. The mouthfeel was a bit of beer, and a bit of wine... a little on the drier side. Overall this was a winner. Wicked Weed rocks. Don't let your fear of sours or red wine keep you away from this gem. As it warmed up, that cherry and barrel flavor exploded. If presented with another WW opportunity, I would likely try another variety... but if I saw this in local distro I have to say that I would go for it.","Mikus","Jul 24, 2014"

3.84,-8.6,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Served from bottle in to a Dogfish Head stemmed snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cherry, wood, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, sour, tart, cherries, wood, caramel, bread, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. All of the aspects one would expect from a sour stout make their way through in both the nose and the flavor. As I've said, I'm not a huge fan of the soured stout movement, but this one manages to throw a nice cherry aspect to soften the blow for. Fairly easy to drink and rather enjoyable overall.","thagr81us","Jun 22, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with dark roasted malt, cocoa, cherry, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour cocoa, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting combination of cocoa and fruit all around.","UCLABrewN84","May 19, 2014"

Topped off with a small, off-white, fizzy head that held at a thin ringlet, leaving a few dots of lacing on the glass. In the nose, dark chocolate malts, red wine and cherries, prunes, some oaky hints in there. In the taste, dark chocolate, dark fruit with a slight acetic tartness, more like you'd get from a Flemish red than anything else, I thought, sort of a blend of cherries and prunes and/or figs, with a little pulpy sweetness in there as well. Some oak from the barrel came out, but I didn't really pick up on any bourbon/vanilla notes. This seemed like a good idea that just could have been executed better. But that said, this was still a good brew. Medium body, good drinkability. I'd like to try this again and see if it improves, assuming they're going to keep brewing it.","Rifugium","May 18, 2014"

Aromas of spicy and charred wood, tart cherries, earthy notes, and a candy sweetness. Flavors are tart and crisp forward, with a solid grape and cherry blend of fruit sweetness, and a charred and slightly bitter backbone. Earthy and woody notes help round out the palate nicely. Smooth, light bodied, with a crispness throughout. Fruity notes linger, with a sharp spice and bitterness in the aftertaste. Crisp, tart, slightly puckering finish. Good beer!","GarthDanielson","Apr 06, 2014"
4.37,4,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Slightly purple colored but mostly just blackish brown, and very dark. Head is nice and fluffy before it fades to a simple ring. Aroma is sweet, juicy, robust, woody, light vanilla, raspberry, cherry, plum, graham cracker pie crust right on as described, and bright mouthwatering tartness. Taste is brighter and more tart. Very clean.... Not overwhelmingly pie-like by any means but certainly very cherry. Alike to biting into fresh cherries, with purple grape skins, wine, oak, and maybe funky brett. Very nice. Texture is smooth, juicy, and dry. A bit of finely gritty dryness through the sour finish. Great beer!","tastybeer","Apr 05, 2014"

All around a very well done drinkable dark cherry sour. Not much bourbon though. All around a really good beer that I'd like to drink regularly","bcp5296d","Apr 03, 2014"

Cherry sourness and wood balanced beautifully with some mellow chocolate and dark malts. Not especially funky or sweet, but bone dry and smooth making for a very drinkable treat. Nice!","wedge","Apr 22, 2013"
