"This is the yellow fizzy beer Stone Brewery warns you about. Save yourself some cash and buy Coors for more of the same, or step your game up."
"One of the strangest tastes, like rubber basted with butter. Not a good strange."
"$6.99 for a six pack at Trader Joe's.  7.1% ABV is the only redeeming trait."
""
""
"Tastes like a cheap domestic brew....the malt liquor comparisons are right on, yuk. Really no redeeming quality other than the high alcohol content. I drank half of one and dumped the rest down the sink."

"This beer pours a dark golden color that you can see through almost like a pilsner but darker. Not much of head to it but lacing is solid. Smells good like you would expect for an American ale bready doughy malt sweetness with a nice solid alcohol wiff. Taste is over powered by the alcohol but there is a nice mouth feel that is accompanied with the bready ale taste with some hops behind it to help balance things but the hops are gone as soon as they appear. Overall, mediocre and yes I would drink it again!"
"Pours smooth with a frothy, yet thin, head that dissipates quickly. A bit of lacing. Cloudy, golden amber. Refreshing and light. Has a nice wheatiness balanced with the lingering bitterness of the hops. Almost has a tea-like aftertaste. Unremarkable but easy to drink."

"Pours with a soapy, sudsy head and a slightly hazy light copper color, same color as a pale ale. Nose has a sharp bitterness to it; boozy, some bready malts, has the familiar smell of malt liquor, that sugar adjunct smell. Taste is a bit better than the nose but definitely reminds me of a malt liquor. Does not have the toasted, malty or caramelly goodness that comes with an all-grain brew, so adjuncts are definitely a big factor in this brew. Tastes like table sugar and not rice or maize. I'm very disappointed by this because I bought it on a whim from Trader Joe's and was excited to try it. Should have gone with the Session Lager for the same price, instead of this inferior brew."
""

"Overall- I wouldn't believe this beer cost $1.30/bottle! Not Arrogant Bastard (the pinnacle of American Strong Ales) but for the price, it's worth having a 6 pack of these around."

"Taste is also very malty, with toasted grain and a touch of fruitiness. I also get some honey and caramel. Seems overall to be too sweet and a tad of balance-wise. Not one I'd return to."
"Fat Weasel Ale is a lively golden ale topped with a soft, creamy, white head. It leaves thick sheets of foam on the glass. It has a light aroma of citrus and wood. It has a smooth, medium body with a chalky finish. It has a sweet and sour malt flavor. It's tangy and the bitterness is ample and wooden. I guess this is a Scotch ale."
"for a malt liquor, this is pretty good stuff. as a 'strong ale' it fails."
""
"Adjusted rating to 3.00 all the way. Okay."

"The Verdict: Pretty good brew. Another one of Trader Joe’s line of affordable beers, this one is my favorite so far. Easily worth the $5.99 price, you get a strong 7.1% pale ale. It is labeled River Trent Brewing, but is probably from Mendocino."

"Not good. Just slightly more flavor than BMC products. No adjunct flavors but I would prefer a beer with adjuncts that was balance. Overall, a mess."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine, thin, off-white head with good retention and light lacing. Mild aroma of sweet malt and a hint of hops, kind of pleasant, but very attenuated. Flavor is sweet malt that seems artificially over sweetened. Develops a hop bitterness with no herbal hop flavors, finishing with a slightly harsh hop bitterness. The flavor wasn't bad, but seemed unbalanced. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess, approaches a quite nice mouth feel. An unusual ale that I had no problem finishing, but will probably not visit again. This bottle brewed by ""River Trent Brewery"" for Trader Joe's, so it is likely made by a diffferent brewery than the ""Steinhaus"" beers. Not remarkable enough to open a new listing for this."
""

"The body was nicely medium-light. Drinkability was OK, it was quickly, and forgotten almost as quickly. Overall, nothing special, but an OK bargain buy."
"Overall Drinkability: Not an amazing beer, but it hits some nice flavor notes that provides a good balance."
""
""
"Overall, a very sweet beer lacking the malt complexity of most strong ales, and lacking the hop flavor and bitterness to prevent it from being cloying."
"(originally reviewed: 07-20-2011)"
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and sugar. Taste is of toasted malt, burnt sugar, and some medicinal and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a weird and somewhat harsh bitterness on the palate that lingers after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a weird finish but I am glad I finally tried this one."
""
"O: I had high expectations from the appearance, but I was let down in pretty much every other aspect. Way too candy-like in the sweetness. Possibly a good gateway beer for people who dislike hops."
""
"Overall: Lots of ""almosts"" for this one. The flavor up front is good but forgoten by the sour finish. The fuller body is erased by the off-putting aftertaste."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is tolerable- medium light body with moderate carbonation. Cannot cover up the taste. What is in this brew? Perhaps its namesake... Do not buy."

"I had this beer as part of a Trader Joe's grab bag. Served cool in a pint glass from the bottle. Nothing on the label tells me what to expect here. Pours gold body, with a white head. Smelly like fruit stone, some grain. Tastes like a sticke alt bier here. malty with that fruit stone taste to subdue the sweetness. Very unidimensional. Not alot here. Not a bad beer, but just nothing to write home about."
""
""
"Wow what a boring and tasteless beer, its hard to get a"
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer poured a cloudy beer with a very nice white poofy head. I had great expectations. However the beer had a yeasty smell that was okay with me but that sour taste that came with it was terrible. Not for me and I will not buy again."
"I suggest avoiding this one. It is drinkable but no need to waste your money, Trader Joes has other much better options for the same price. It is also weird how much alcohol is detectible for only being 7%."
"o: Six bucks for a sixer sounds great, but a couple of more dollars would make a world of difference. Not worth it imo."
"Golden color with a huge head that leaves very nice sticky lacing. Smells like yeast and alcohol. Thats really about it. Taste is similar, but fortunately tastes better than the smell. Maybe a slight fruitiness and some hops. ABV is very noticeable. Light mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated. Overall, this tastes like a stronger version of something from AB. No depth, really no flavors except the 2 previously mentioned. But...It'll getcha drunk!"
"Poured a light amber with a head that built, then lasted, leaving a pretty good amount of lacing. The smell is bready, with a bit of fruit, and even in the smell the abv becomes apparent. In the taste, the only thing seeming to stand out was the alcohol, which is undeniable going down. The sweetness is pretty upfront with the alcohol, with bitterness making its way near the end. Slick mouthfeel. Not entirely sure what to make of the abv. . . but with the price tag, a few of these would make an elite replacement for the ubiquitous 40 oz. . ."
"This beer poured out as a typical amber color with a light tan colored head on top. the head doesn't leave much in way of lacing. The smell of the beer is a malty and a bit hoppy. The taste of the beer is a little all over the place. I have a hard time figureing this one out. I think it's hoppy and it's got malts in there too but there is other stuff that I can't grasp. The mouthfeel wasn't as thick as I was hoping for and overall I feel it's just an average brew to say the least. Wouldn't seek this one out again."
"I thought the color would be a lot darker than it was, but it was intriguing enough. It almost tasted like it was trying to be a Guiness knock-off, but wasn't nearly as good. That's not to say it wasn't a good beer. I sensed a little toffee sweetness, with malt boldness."
"I don't know why so many souls hate this stuff-- it would be the greatest malt liquor on the planet if you bought it in a flashy tall can. I'd blind taste this with the Dogfish or the Rogue malts and see who comes out best."
"O - OK as an economical strong ale"
"I do enjoy the random finds at the local TJ's. This one pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly-off white foam. The nose comprises flowers, mild orange rind, lemon peel, and a very faint hint of caramel. Once things hit the tongue, pain begins. Something akin to a mixture of balsa, vinyl, mandarin orange syrup, and cotton candy is the only way I can describe the taste. What's worse, though, is that this melange instantly made me grimace in mild pain. Seriously. Boo this immediately. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta smooth feel. Point are deducted for the pain, though. Overall, I could not stand this beer. I'm not sure what it is, exactly, but it hurt me deeply. I feel traumatized by this bottle..."
"overall, not too impressed. it's drinkable enough - nothing you'll run to the bathroom expelling - just average. not a bad value at Trader Joe's."
"Color is lighter than I expected. Its a clear light gold color with a basically white thin, tiny bubbled head. Aroma is, well this doesn't really smell like anything. Maybe some light graininess mixed with corniness. Tastes about the same. A bit disappointing. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy. Overall, not so great."
"Just kind of a yeasty, low hop, average bitterness beer, malt profile is unremarkable, doesn't contribute anything, doesn't offer anything specifically to the taste. Really kind of a weird conglomeration of nothing that stands out. Not thick, not hoppy, not really all that bitter, no roast, just kind of a hodgepodge batch."
"T: This tastes way more like a malt liquor to me. Sweet and not clean at all. As it warms, it develops a very coppery taste and the yeast begins to come out a little too much. I would definitely avoid this."
"Taste is appley-toasty grain, bread, some vague spicy peppery-grassy hop bitterness which soon tends to dominate and be a bit sharp while becoming steadily more bland and simple. It’s pretty good but not very, and is not particularly drinkable. It seems rather like a low-grade maibock or hoppy/bitter malt liquor."
"Mouthfeel is dry and a little gritty, not very lively. Overall, it's an OK beer."
"Overall an ok beer. Probably wouldnt buy it myself but my buddy said I had to try it."
"Poured this American Strong Ale out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a hazy pale color. It produced a nice head but head retention was poor. Lacing was average. The Aroma dominated by dough and not much else. The body of this Strong Ale was light. The beer was sweet, a little bit of malt and not much hop bitterness to speak of. The beer finish's dry- product of the high % of Alcohol. Very average beer- I won't seek this out in the future."
"Poured a pretty standard straw color with a little orange to it. Quite a bit of big fluffy white head on it. Strong doughiness on the nose with some malt coming through. A bit of hops as well. Taste is not real great. Tastes sweet up front with a funky bitter finish. Light mouthfeel. This beer is pretty drinkable. It's not a bad beer for the price."
"D - Drinkable, but not really memorable. This beer is worth giving a try but you probably won't find anymore in my beer fridge any time soon."
"i like the small bottle. reminds me of the henry weinhard's bottles."
"Not a great beer. The bottle came from a friend who said it had been unintentionally aged in her fridge; but other reviews suggest that's not the issue here."
"Purchased 6-pack from Trader Joe's to try, not expecting much. Poured bright golden with a foamy head. Aroma is light, dominated by malt and yeast. Very smooth. Sweet malty flavor upfront with some light but pleasant hops at the finish. Quite drinkable for the price."
"Overall: Decent. It was fairly mild and refreshing, despite the the higher ABV. For the price though, it's a respectable choice if a really good brew is outside the budget."
"The fat weasel beer is nothing special but for the price it's totally solid. Trader Joes carries it for $6. It has a good golden color. It pours with very little head. The drinkability of this inexpensive strong ale wins it for me. The taste is a little sweet but solid."
"Note: Not bad and better then I expected but nothing really exceptional."
"D- Nice drinkable beer. Kind of surprised by the high ABV, creeps up on me, would be better and more well balanced at about 5.5- 6, just my opinion."
"Drinkability: They definitely went a bit over the top with the alcohol content here. Maybe shooting for 5 percent would have kept this one more drinkable and not ruined the flavor."
"D: I am debating whether or not I want to finish it...."
"Overall: Overall the beer was decent. Slight citrus and hops reminds me more of an IPA than an American Strong Ale. For $1 at Trader Joes, it's a good deal for drinking in quantity. But there are definitely better Strong Ales out there."
"This would be a great ""bridge"" ale for the many drinkers of the ""Big 3"" (AB, Coors, Miller) in getting them a better quality beverage."
"Finishes slightly bitter, and fairly dry. While the flavors don't all come together quite perfectly, there's a fair amount of heft here and perhaps a bit more than I was expected. With the huge herbal component, think of this as the Rolling Rock of sizable pale ales."
" ~ I like this beer. I think its a real easy to drink, light colored brew that I would probably drink more often if I could locate some closer to Central Wisconsin. My lovely wife was kind enough to bring back a six pack for me on a recent trip she took to Northern Illinois. Thanks Hun. (4.0)"
"Aroma is fairly strong and malty, not complex but still inviting. It pours a nice clear golden amber with a fairly thick though not persistent white head. Flavor is malty, a little crisp, slightly fruity and slightly bitter. Texture is smooth, somewhat thick and just a little tingly. Not too shabby."
"This was contract brewed by Augusta Schell in New Ulm,MN."
"I found this to be a nice drinkable brew for the summer patio."
"D- this strikes me as the craft beer drinkers alternative to malt liquor. cheap, doesnt taste very good, and packs an alcoholic punch. if thats what youre into, check it out. not really for me."
"Not much here, but it's certainly not objectionable. The ABV might knock you over if not taken seriously."
"Want to hear something totally out of line? I think my favorite way to drink this one is on a hot muggy DC summer evening in a glass with plenty of ice cubes. Crazy, I know."
"D - This is an interesting beer. Classified as an American Strong Ale, it seems to fit. It's fairly strong and boozy but not very hoppy so it fits as a strong ale."
"Drinkability: it was ok. i'll drink it again, but mostly because of the price i paid, not because of the quality."
"D - It tastes like a really high quality malt liquor, and I mean that as a compliment. This tastes like what strong brew should taste like, but I can't help thinking that maybe this should be in the BSPA category... thats just the flavor profile that I'm getting. Not bad stuff, honestly. I'd buy it again at this price, but put it on the same $$ shelf as Duvel and there is no contest."
"It has a very metallic aroma which pretty much overrides all other odors. There is a mild hint of malt. I cannot say there were anything really as far as head just a few bubbles. There was no lace to speak of either just a ring. The body is a golden orange color with some bubbles. The taste is metallic at first but it is candy and cereal like as well. It has a warming feeling to it. It has a dog food like aftertaste. Overall it is a thin beer."
"Do give this beer a ""Good"" for Drinkability because its sure to give you a nice buzz if that's what you're after for $1/bottle (if you frequent your nearest Trader Joe's)..."
"Not bad, but it falls short of what I expect from a strong ale. Still, overall it was enjoyable."
"Pours a straw/golden color with just a tad of haze. A thick frothy 2 finger white head tops the beer. Smells of corn, malt, and cereal grains. First sip is more reminiscent of an American Light lager than an ale. Mouthfeel is quite good - creamy and well carbonated. The 7% ABV is well hidden. Not too bad...just not very good."
"I will definatly buy this again. A great beer when I don't want a rich hefe or Belgian ale which are my preference."
"D: Drinkability is down due to the high-alcohol attributes. Maybe you should just drink the first half and drink it very cold."
"Not impressed, but then I didn't really expect to be. Bit lager like on the nose towards the end of the beer."
"Pours a clear, golden yellow. 1/4 inch head with slight retention and no lacing. Smells of a lager with some sweet malt and possibly some adjunct. Fits the style. Has a sweet malty flavor with a lager background. There is a nasty kick to this beer (similar to vodka), a strong puckering. Overall, this beer started out with some potential and then quickly went down hill until it ended up with that nasty sour kick."
"Poured a deep gold, nice head, fair lace and carbonation. Mild malt on the nose, hints of hops but nothing overbearing. Taste is smooth, a mild hint of malt giving it a sweet feel and a bitter hop finish. Well this brew didn't do much for me, kind of one dimensional at best. Looks good but looks can be deceiving..."
"This poured a bright, clear gold with white head. It smelled like sweet and creamy yeast with a bit of honey malt and lemon hops. It tasted like creamy yeast and sweet lemon hops, with a bit of copper hops and fresh wheat malt. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was very clean and easy to drink. It had nice body, and had a simple and enjoyable flavor. This just seemed like it was missing something, which makes it very forgettable. The weasel needs more kick!"
"D - Somewhat drinkable for the abv. Malty and alcohol isn't well hidden. Solid beer, but not fantastic."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a fluffy head that falls quickly to decent lacing. Slightly sour aroma, like a mix of wheat and pilsener malt. The flavor is decent, a little sour, some slight hop bitterness on the end. The mouthfeel is thin, slightly clingy, emphasizing the very slight bitterness down the throat on teh finish. Overall, however, this is a drinkable but entirely unmemorable beer."
"This beer almost brings to mind a very, very light stout. The brew holds a bit sweet with a very light coffee tone in the back, although its so light I admit this could be my imagination. In the end, its a passable, but not altogether glorious ale. You get your moneys worth, I suppose, but you can certainly find others to enjoy. The finest qualities this brew possess are a moderately hilarious title and picture, combined with a hearty 7.1 alcohol by volume content."
"Another Trader Joes beer that is far better than I was expecting. The aroma is a bit bland, but this is packed with a surprising amount of flavor; the strength of this beer obviously helps as I was expecting this to be around 4% and not the 7.2% that it is at. Not quite something that I can see myself buying again, but if handed this at a BBQ I would be quite content."
"Overall a decent brew, that is quite drinkable. And a frickin' steal for only a $1 in Boston. I guess pretty much anywhere for that matter."
"So I had a guy tell me the other day that this was his favorite IPA. He mentioned Smutty IPA, Two Hearted and Loose Cannon in the same conversation, so I kind of figured he knew a bit more than your average beer imbiber.Hmmm. Not so much. I wouldn't even think of classifying this beer as an IPA, and have doubts that is even an ale to begin with, other than the packaging claim, that is. Honestly to me it comes across as a hoppy bock, which isn't a bad thing, just completely unexpected. Certainly there are no hops in the nose; it is dominated by a sweet, almost sticky aroma. It is all malt in the mouth as well, with an delayed bit of generic bittering mid-palate that is then subsumed by a maple-caramel finish down the back of the tongue. To be honest, I don't terribly dislike this beer, and for 5.99 a 6er will probably pick up another when I am next in Trader Joes (it is one of their many, many store brands), but I have not idea why this guy thought it could ever, ever begin to stand in the same race as Two Hearted or Smutty. In the end it is a decent brew, not obnoxiously made, with a kick bracing enough to quell those 'friends' of yours who insist on only MBC. But dude, it ain't an IPA. Seriously..."
"Well done beer, way too easy to drink."
"Decent body and good carbonation, together with a good flavor pan out to a brew thats easy to drink, but nothing special. That's all folk's."
"Body is full. A bit heavy and sticky too. Alcohol and fruity maltness overwhelm. The hops are muted and not balanced. Dry finish, or so it seems, and then a sticky coating takes over and wont go away. A good beer, but I'm glad my little lady likes them more, she can finish off the sixpack..."
" Really,pretty good for the money, I would probably drink it again,but not my favorite."
"Drinkability: Not only was this my first down-the-drain beer, this was my first practice the just-won-the championship-spray with about three bottles beer. This one makes me stick to the excellent cheap wines that Trader Joe's has and leave the beer for another time."
"Not a bad beer, especially for $5.99/6 pack. Mildly recommended."
"This one poured okay, a copper color with a touch of white head on top. Nose is weird, but I could tell right off the bat it wasn't for me. A lot of alcohol presence, as well as diacetyl. Malt liquory, as another reviewer observed. Taste is likewise. It's just not pleasant to drink. Kind of biting hoppiness, then that acidic punch. Really not good. Body is alright, although a little thin. Overall, I won't be getting this one again."
"Gold, slightly cloudy pour. Bright white medium lasting head. Smell is a very slight touch of lager yeastiness, but mostly of fruity hops. Taste is very bland, watery, and a lightly flavored hop finish. Nothing tasted bad, but it was easily one of the blandest beers I've ever had. If you're at Trader Joes and want to pick up a beer their, I'd recommend the Fat Weasel Pale ale over this one."
"Would I get this again? No. Will I even finish this bottle?"
"Since I drank it out of the bottle, I didn't get to see the beer----but taste is far more important to me. (but I rated the appearance at ""average", because my review would not load without something in that field)"
"This is wierd. NO way it resembles an amber, its golden,clear with a tiny white bubbly head ,looks more like a malt liquor! Nasty over sweet aroma, again malt liquor like. All I get as far as flavour is very sweet malts, bordering on sickening and cheap corniness. Bad mouthfeel, to cloying. Over all nasty stuff. this is weird this is a totally different beer than many have described. To me this is a cheap ole malt liquor. Has the recipe changed?"
"Drinkability- This was a bear to get through."
"It's a pretty easy beer to drink but its not complex; the key phrase in this offering is ""straight forward."" If you want a decent beer at a good price and want to kick start a buzz - this is your pick. I may pick it up again but certainly not for a while...would be a good winter beer with it's warmth factor."
"Poured a light amber with a thin head. The aroma is of some sweet malts and earthy hops. The beer has a somewhat decent balance, but it is overpowered by alcohol. The alcohol is overly present in the mouthfeel and does not balance with the malts or the hops. This is a decent beer that might be enjoyed if your scrapped for cash and want something cheap, as long as you live near a Trader Joe's"
"I was expecting not to like this beer due to its lackluster reviews and dirt-cheap price, but it really wasn't all that bad. Hell, I might even get it again. Certainly nothing spectacular, but hey, for less than 5 bucks a six-pack, It's pretty good. Recommended."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden honey , with stark white head - nose of hops , malty , hints of chocolate , sweet citrus , and chalky  taste of light tropical fruit , egg white , light maltyness , and - body is light , dry and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of salty , floral , slight hops , and semi dry"
"The best description I can give for the taste is that it's like a Miller Lite with more alcohol. There are some sour metal notes and a hint of citrus and apple to the taste as well. The mouthfeel is dry and pungent with a metallic aftertaste. Overall it's not a great beer, but if you can stomach it, the 7.1% ABV will surely get you a nice buzz."
"Taste is fairly balanced with malt in the driver's seat but hops nagging continuously by his side. Notes of spice are present but mostly ineffectual at really improving the flavor. Alcohol note is pronounced in the aftertaste which isn't aided by a watery, weak texture and mouthfeel. Fairly harsh sip after sip and not real drinkable. I guess this is Trader Joe's malt liquor substitute. This could be worse, but even for ninety two cents isn't very good."
"The drinkability is moderate. This taste is not great, nor terrible. It went down easy enough, and has some heft that would catch up to you more quickly then you realized. It's price is probably it's greatest attribute, and it consequently tastes like a cheap belgian style tripel, which is the style comparison I'm basing my rating on."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden/orange color with about an inch white head. Not much in the way of smell, it just smells like grain and some sweet malt. It tastes like sweet malt, alcohol and some grassy hops. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick. Drinkability isn't too good, the alcohol is too noticable for me since there isn't much other taste to this beer. I don't think I'll try this one again anytime soon, I'm just glad I bought a single bottle of it instead of a six pack."
"	That said, I'd take it over a macro-brewed light beer. (Not really saying a lot.)"
"D: really doesn't stand out. I wouldn't mind having it again, but I definitely wouldn't purchase it."
"Overall, the Fat Weasel is good for a fairly cheap buzz, but only if you like your beer grainy and bitter."
"An already heavy style is rendered one & out as the aftertaste is just too troublesome for me to want more than one."
"Poured far lighter than I would've expected with a decent head. No lacing. Body is the color of pale straw. Nose smells like hard candy mixed with hops and a kiss of caramel. I was surprised at the amount of hops I smelled. Taste doesn't do much for me .... either hops or the malt need to commit more ... and neither does. The taste is good, but it's begging for an aspect to dominate and neither does. It reminds me of a dumbed down (extremely dumb) Dreadnaught. I think some other reviewer said this was $4.99 a sixer. This is good enough to be a bargain for that price.If that is the case (I only bought a single so I'm not sure) I would certainly buy this again. Tastes good enough to drink again."
"Not a bad offering, just nothing exceptional. Thanks IntriqKen for the sample."
"So be warned...this is an American Strong Ale that is very well disguised as a mild APA"
"Comments: For 83 cents a bottle, how much can you expect? It's not an awful beer, but it's probably not something I'd buy again unless I wanted to get hammered in a hurry. Neither would I drink more than one or two at a time since the prevalent alcohol makes it somewhat tedious."
"All in all average to disappoionting. Not really bad in any particular way but there's nothing to recommend this beer if there are any other choices available..."
"Drinkability: Not very good, but $.84 means that not a lot was put into it."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty crisp, but not as refreshing as the color might suggest. A mix of medium hop bitterness and alcohol. Not that the alcohol is overpowering, but its presence is undeniable."
"There is a thin white head that even with a generous pour only brought up a 1/2 a finger head and no lacing. The aroma is grainy with sweet undertones of honey, apricots, orange and banana? The taste is medium carbonated and seems much like a macro, grainy and flat tasting. It is slightly metallic in the aftertaste. Overall, not much there."
"Poured a deep gold, nice head, fair lace and carbonation. Mild malt on the nose, hints of hops but nothing overbearing. Taste is smooth, a mild hint of malt giving it a sweet feel and a bitter hop finish. 7.0 eh? Well if that dont beat all, well hidden. Well this brew didnt do much for me, kind of one dimensional at best. Looks good but looks can be deceiving.."
"Drinkability: I think this is fairly drinkable at the ABV it is. However not six, maybe two."
"A different kind of ASA. Poured out to a clear golden yellow color, leading me to initially think this was a crappy macro in a dressed up label. Luckily I was wrong. Small white head over the beer, iwth small notions of lace around the interior of the glass. Not bad. Aromas of yeast and malt, with a sweet overtone to the overall smell. Nice. Taste was along the same lines; flavors of malts, sweet bread, yeast, sour apple and grain met in relative harmony. Good complexity. Mouthfeel was fair, but the carbonation could've been upped just a touch to bring out the nuances of the brew. Only average drinkability; this is a pretty good beer, but I don't think it would find it's way to my cellar or fridge all that often. It's not bad, but not an everyday brew. Worth a try."
"from the bottle. poured more a dark golden than amber wiyh a small white head. aroma a little on the mild side nothing big here, got malt, caramel hint of hops.flavor the caramel came out a little stronger, malts had a hard time finding the hops. as it warmed lost most of the flavor. but as a cold beer not to bad."
"Smell is alcohol blended with a soft malt presence and a touch of lemon in the background. This beer came through OK in the taste. Its best category and obviously the best one to do well in. Sweetness was over the top in the middle then steps aside for a strong alcohol finish that sizzles. I had to hand off a couple of these to some fellow beer sampling friends. Hey I'm a nice guy what can I say...Take my Weasel Please!!"
"Drinkability: I could down a couple of these on a hot summer evening as the sun sets. There are definitely better beers in this category, but the price of this one - although I didn't buy it, I was told it was quite economical - could make this beer something to purchase when price could be an issue."
"Here's another unusual brew that defies description from the style. Interesting enough to try, but non-descript enough to pass on the second offering."
"Again, alcohol upfront. Not too much for the tastebuds, but the sweet caramel flavors don't help at all. Finishes with a suggestion of generic hop. Some better hops and more of them would really help this brew....but overall, its not bad. The mouthfeel is a little slick, but its drinkable and the price helps out."
"Really not that bad considering how cheap it was, but nothing to write home about either."
"Amber pour with small white head. Malty scents. Very sweet and malty taste with a bit of nutmeg or something. Goes down fairly easy, but not one that I would need to try again. There are better ones at Joe's."
"This beer was given to me by my cousin's girlfriend who knows the owner of the brewery. I must say that I appreciate the free beer but I would not purchase any of this ever again. The pour was nothing special, a light gold color with no head to speak of at all. The smell was allmost non existant but for a slightly fruity scent and a touch of malt. The taste is just way too sweet, with no balance at all and a bit of a solvent like alchohol flavor that a couple of other reviewers notes as well. This beer would not be bad if they just added some good hoppy kick to it, but as it stands it is just way too sweet and cloying."
"Maybe a good gateway beer."
"It's not terrible, but I doubt I'll pick this up if i see it. A little more than a little too sweet for me. Almost belgian-ish, with the sugary esters and phenols, but without the spicy, yeasty kick in the end to keep it all in check. Certainly not the cleanest beer, it reminds me of something a halfway decent homebrewer would make when attempting strong ale of the british persuasion. I think my bottle may have been a bit old, with traces of honey and cardboard on the last couple sips. I'm guessing it only added to the flavor, rather than the other way around. Not much aside from sweet, sweet, sweet."
"PS: The label on this particular bottle says that the beer was brewed and bottled by River Trent Brewing Co., not Steinhaus as indicated above. Maybe it's a different beer from the one listed here, but there's no other Fat Weasel Ale listed."
"Orange-amber color with a very thin off-white head and very little lacing. Light caramel malt aroma. Thin-bodied with astringent hops and alcohol at the forefront with not enough malt to balance it out. The finish does contain some sweetness but the underlying bitterness throws the whole thing off. Overall this is pretty much the same quality as the other Trader Joes beers I have tried."
"Tasted: 09/06/04"
"Looks like we've got a truckload of beer snobs here with previous reviews. I take the Wine Spectator approach to this beer -- rank in accordance with taste and *value.* If Wine Spectator can award a 93 + to a wine under $50 in competition with a $800 bottle, then ostensibly the same good sense would apply with Beer capital B, $5/sixer. This wine pours a thick, champagne bubbly head. It has no smell, other than a slight alcoholly one. The taste up front is sweet, mid-way malt and butter (?), and finish a combo of metallic hops (unpleasant) and vegetal flavor. Great carbonation and comfy in the mouth. Definitely a good drinking beer, better than average, and better than many an expensive boutique microbrew."
"Overall, this was a lackluster beer that didn't seem to have all that much going for it. Nothing in Fat Weasel Ale made me want to go get another one any time soon."
"Drinkability is OK. A 3 X 3 Brew. Not bad, not great."
"Pours an unattractive pale orange with an unretentive head. Smells, though faint, are actually nicely balanced between hops and malt, with some fruity esters. I'm pleasantly surprised. Flavor is balanced in its own way, if you dont count the out of place alcohol, with a nice hop frontage, leading into a kinof mediocre malt. Not a great beer, but bold. It at least makes a statement, I just have no idea what that statement is."
"Notes: Forgettable."
"On the pour a cloudless amber color and the head portly in size, somewhat creamy in texture, the color an off white as it dissolves, the lace formed is a fine sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is citrus crisp and malt sweet, pleasant to the senses with the start malt sweet, top is a bit thin. Finish has a crisp acidity, the hops noticeable but not overpowering, very dry and a drinkable beer."
"Medium gold color, large head. Medium bodied ale. A malty and hoppy ale, malts slightly sweet. Fairly aggressively hopped. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is a little bitter. Taste is a trifle thin, but still a decent beer. Tastes more like a Pale Ale or an Amber."
"Boy, I am *really* glad I was not tempted to pick up a Six-Pack of this!!!!"
"Pale golden brew, very clear (perhaps a bit too pale and clear) with only a few lazily rising trails of CO2. Beautiful, creamy, white head. Good retention, leaves behind a fair amount of lace. A bit of sweet cloying malt in the aroma, but otherwise mostly herbal hops and slight hints of apple. Taste just seems off. Very cloying sweetness, with a slightly soapy, hoppy flavor (herbal, almost but not quite piney). Has an unpleasant grain flavor - not like it's made with corn or any poor adjunct, but still not quite right. Fairly good mouthfeel, moderate bodied, smooth with plenty of oily slickness. Overall, not something I'd like to have again. Unfortunately, I bought a sixer last week and I have four left."
"Overall this might be a pretty good beer if they correct the solvent like taste. Could use a bigger hop presence IMO."
"Fat Weasel Ale: 12 oz bottle from trader Joe’s, 83 cents a bottle. Slightly hazy beer, with a Golden hue, and a frothy thick white head, that is very long lasting. Really bad aroma, like rotten honey. The taste follows the nose, pretty bad. Its got a cloying, and unpleasant sweetness, and long lasting/bad malt taste. Not good."
"The higher  alcohols are a bit too much to handle and throw the brew off balance, add the sweetness to this and it drops a drinkability even lower. Not a horrible beer at all but just not something I’d go back to anytime soon."
"It was okay, but I wouldn't drink another."
