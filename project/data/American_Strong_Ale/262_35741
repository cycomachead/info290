There is a pronounced flavor of alcohol on the finish. It has a mildly carbonated mouthfeel with some slight stickiness.

Aroma of sweet and biscuit malt, and fresh pomegranite juice; very appealing. Flavor is malt, biscuits and pomegranite juice, finishing with well melded dry grassy hop bitterness, malt and residual sweet juice. The flavors are well integrated. Medium bodied with a nice mouth feel from carbonation. A uniquely flavored ale that was fun to drink and well made. I will revisit this one again.

It's got the same type of intense sweetness without quite being cloying. I mean, it's a bit cloying, but I like that doppelbock-style sweetness. So, I'm very much enjoying it. It is DEFINITELY desert beer, though. Didn't go very well with my dinner. I don't think it would go well with much of anything, really. It's a dessert in itself. It's got fruitiness to it, but I'm not tasting much pomegranate. I was thinking it would have a pomegranate-like bitterness and am pleasantly surprised that it does not. It's also a lot maltier than I was expecting from a fruit-flavoured beer. This is a must-try for fans of sweet beers.","ElCommodoro","Oct 23, 2012"

After the smell and appearance of this beer, the rest went down hill. I was expecting a beer that was full of flavor and strong on the palate, however what I got was flat sparkling water with a little bit of a pomegranate flavor which caused my rating to go way down.

3.82,8.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer has been on my hit-list for a while, it's only recently that I finally found a bottle. It's not too much to look at, it pours a deep amber with a small head. The aroma is sweet and tangy, with malts dominating, and a little bit of the pomegranate hiding in the back. The taste is good, it's got a nice strong malt thing going on, with a bit of a hoppy presence, and the pomegranates doing their thing throughout the whole thing, adding a slightly sour fruity edge to the whole deal. It's not exceptional, but it's still very good. The mouthfeel is good, it feels just about right for the strength of the beer, and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is was a good beer that presents something different in the fruit beer field. I'd give it a try, but don't get your hopes up for something fantastic.","shand","Mar 23, 2012"

Pours a clear, slightly ruddy copper with a fairly thick and fluffy light beige head. Malty, woody aroma has a firm pomegranate note and hints of caramel and horehound. Smooth texture has about average body and fizziness, and leaves a fruity, slightly hop-bitter finish.","Cyberkedi","Mar 15, 2012"

It drinks pretty light in body and doesn't have appealing flavor at all. It's odd and disjointed. The pomegranate doesn't show itself, and if you strained to believe that it was, then it's forced.

Sadly, this beer did not have total success. It felt like the brewers decided to take the beer to somewhere unexpected; they wanted to keep the beer from being to sweet because of fruit or they wanted to keep it from being to fruity. Either way, the direction they went in was still sweet. Though pomegranate is present in the aroma, it never is fully integrated into the beer. To make matters worse, malty (and sticky) sweetness takes over, and the alcohol interferes with the taste. Thus the beer does not seem balanced.","ianjsullivan","Feb 22, 2011"

This is a pretty full bodied beer with a sticky syrupy consistency with a spicey and acerbic mouthfeel. There is a throaty burn to this beer in the finish beyond the warming alcohol notes. The taste may be pomegranate but you wouldn't know it. There are bold sweet malts, there are some acerbic fruity tastes that are too vague to pin down to anyone one fruit, some stronger liquor flavors, some deep caramel too. Pomegranate was just not in the equation as far as I can detect, except in the coloring of the beer that did have a nice reddish/pomegranate tint to it.

A very malty malt base provides round and balanced aromas of toasted malts, attenuated caramels and toffees, and providing a Bock-like melanoiden, mouthwatering effect. Fruity esters give a lot of decoration to the malts and round out the light citrus hop character. An underlying tart, berry sweetness also give a lot of variety to the beer (may be the pommegranite flavors). A heaviness to the malts remind me of Avery Kaiser, but with a stronger toasted malt presences, assertive fruitiness and American hops, albeit moderate. Finishes well attenuated despite the sweetness. A light berry tartness lingers beyond the crispness. Again a nice beer by a novelty brewery.","BEERchitect","Feb 16, 2008"

The taste is a bit shocking but very welcome. I was expecting sour and I got bold well balanced rich and bitter mix. There is a noticeable hint of the ponegranate juice on the back end of the palate. A slight soured feel does exist but is only a balancer on the front of the mouthfeel. This beer is actually very interesting and well balanced with lots of dark wheat and mineral qualities.

The aroma has some tea-like sweetness to it, along with a plummy fruitiness. On the palate, some metallic twang first off before things sweeten a bit with caramel malts and fruit juice, then dry out with a couple different hop sensations -- some English earthyness and a bit of American pine-infused hops, both of which form some substantial bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, with plenty of hop resins and some sharp hop after-flavors.

I get a smooth malty beer ... but as it warms there is this unidentifiable earthy warmth. Id initially identify it as a big dark honey, but this must be the pomegranate at work. I can honestly say I have no idea what a pomegranate tastes like, let alone pre-judge whether it belongs in beer.

Understated aroma of sweet caramel malt, some dark fruit, and a touch of lightly spicy pomegranate juice. Palate is a blend of caramel malt and some light, fruity hops. The pomegranate flavor emerges mid-palate and imparts a significant dry bitterness towards the finish. The malt profile becomes a bit more agreeable as the beer warms, taking on a mildly sweet, biscuity character. Body is substantial, but the low level of carbonation makes it seem a little thin for such a strong beer. A decent offering.","ElGordo","Mar 06, 2007"
