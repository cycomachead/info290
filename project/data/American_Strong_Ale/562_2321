Nose has a sharp bitterness to it; boozy, some bready malts, has the familiar smell of malt liquor, that sugar adjunct smell. Taste is a bit better than the nose but definitely reminds me of a malt liquor. Does not have the toasted, malty or caramelly goodness that comes with an all-grain brew, so adjuncts are definitely a big factor in this brew. Tastes like table sugar and not rice or maize. I'm very disappointed by this because I bought it on a whim from Trader Joe's and was excited to try it.

Mild aroma of sweet malt and a hint of hops, kind of pleasant, but very attenuated. Flavor is sweet malt that seems artificially over sweetened. Develops a hop bitterness with no herbal hop flavors, finishing with a slightly harsh hop bitterness. The flavor wasn't bad, but seemed unbalanced. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess, approaches a quite nice mouth feel. An unusual ale that I had no problem finishing, but will probably not visit again. This bottle brewed by ""River Trent Brewery"" for Trader Joe's, so it is likely made by a diffferent brewery than the ""Steinhaus"" beers. Not remarkable enough to open a new listing for this.","LiquidAmber","Nov 11, 2012"

I wouldn't even think of classifying this beer as an IPA, and have doubts that is even an ale to begin with, other than the packaging claim, that is. Honestly to me it comes across as a hoppy bock, which isn't a bad thing, just completely unexpected. Certainly there are no hops in the nose; it is dominated by a sweet, almost sticky aroma. It is all malt in the mouth as well, with an delayed bit of generic bittering mid-palate that is then subsumed by a maple-caramel finish down the back of the tongue. To be honest, I don't terribly dislike this beer, and for 5.99 a 6er will probably pick up another when I am next in Trader Joes (it is one of their many, many store brands), but I have not idea why this guy thought it could ever, ever begin to stand in the same race as Two Hearted or Smutty.

I must say that I appreciate the free beer but I would not purchase any of this ever again. The pour was nothing special, a light gold color with no head to speak of at all. The smell was allmost non existant but for a slightly fruity scent and a touch of malt. The taste is just way too sweet, with no balance at all and a bit of a solvent like alchohol flavor that a couple of other reviewers notes as well. This beer would not be bad if they just added some good hoppy kick to it, but as it stands it is just way too sweet and cloying.","Dmann","Jan 07, 2005"

3.05,1.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"It's not terrible, but I doubt I'll pick this up if i see it. A little more than a little too sweet for me. Almost belgian-ish, with the sugary esters and phenols, but without the spicy, yeasty kick in the end to keep it all in check. Certainly not the cleanest beer, it reminds me of something a halfway decent homebrewer would make when attempting strong ale of the british persuasion. I think my bottle may have been a bit old, with traces of honey and cardboard on the last couple sips. I'm guessing it only added to the flavor, rather than the other way around. Not much aside from sweet, sweet, sweet.","UnionMade","Dec 14, 2004"

2.95,-2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Orange-amber color with a very thin off-white head and very little lacing. Light caramel malt aroma. Thin-bodied with astringent hops and alcohol at the forefront with not enough malt to balance it out. The finish does contain some sweetness but the underlying bitterness throws the whole thing off. Overall this is pretty much the same quality as the other Trader Joes beers I have tried.","Dogbrick","Oct 18, 2004"

3.13,4,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,"Looks like we've got a truckload of beer snobs here with previous reviews. I take the Wine Spectator approach to this beer -- rank in accordance with taste and *value.* If Wine Spectator can award a 93 + to a wine under $50 in competition with a $800 bottle, then ostensibly the same good sense would apply with Beer capital B, $5/sixer. This wine pours a thick, champagne bubbly head. It has no smell, other than a slight alcoholly one. The taste up front is sweet, mid-way malt and butter (?), and finish a combo of metallic hops (unpleasant) and vegetal flavor. Great carbonation and comfy in the mouth. Definitely a good drinking beer, better than average, and better than many an expensive boutique microbrew.","marcellaproust","Apr 14, 2004"

3.12,3.7,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Pours an unattractive pale orange with an unretentive head. Smells, though faint, are actually nicely balanced between hops and malt, with some fruity esters. I'm pleasantly surprised. Flavor is balanced in its own way, if you dont count the out of place alcohol, with a nice hop frontage, leading into a kinof mediocre malt. Not a great beer, but bold. It at least makes a statement, I just have no idea what that statement is.","gnaussea","Oct 26, 2003"

3.5,16.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On the pour a cloudless amber color and the head portly in size, somewhat creamy in texture, the color an off white as it dissolves, the lace formed is a fine sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is citrus crisp and malt sweet, pleasant to the senses with the start malt sweet, top is a bit thin. Finish has a crisp acidity, the hops noticeable but not overpowering, very dry and a drinkable beer.","Gusler","Oct 05, 2003"
3.26,8.3,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Medium gold color, large head. Medium bodied ale. A malty and hoppy ale, malts slightly sweet. Fairly aggressively hopped. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is a little bitter. Taste is a trifle thin, but still a decent beer. Tastes more like a Pale Ale or an Amber.","beerguy101","Aug 12, 2003"

2.63,-12.6,4,3.5,2,3.5,2,"Pale golden brew, very clear (perhaps a bit too pale and clear) with only a few lazily rising trails of CO2. Beautiful, creamy, white head. Good retention, leaves behind a fair amount of lace. A bit of sweet cloying malt in the aroma, but otherwise mostly herbal hops and slight hints of apple. Taste just seems off. Very cloying sweetness, with a slightly soapy, hoppy flavor (herbal, almost but not quite piney). Has an unpleasant grain flavor - not like it's made with corn or any poor adjunct, but still not quite right. Fairly good mouthfeel, moderate bodied, smooth with plenty of oily slickness. Overall, not something I'd like to have again. Unfortunately, I bought a sixer last week and I have four left.","Viking","Mar 24, 2003"

3.08,2.3,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"The higher  alcohols are a bit too much to handle and throw the brew off balance, add the sweetness to this and it drops a drinkability even lower. Not a horrible beer at all but just not something I’d go back to anytime soon.","Jason","Sep 29, 2002"
