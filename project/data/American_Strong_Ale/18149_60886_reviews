"First sip at Lost Abbey Brewery 2011 with Guillermo, Love."
""
""
"Strong alcohol and cloyingly sweet dark cocoa flavor. Definitely a ""beer"" to drink by the fire.  Think brandy snifter with a carbonated, raspberry tinged after dinner liqueur. Rich, rich body but with a decent level of carbonation. Long raisiny aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is the best beer that I have ever had. Drank it at room temp in snifters, and was blown away. Way better than any other Barrel Aged beer that I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is immense and phenomenally rich.  It's definitely a sipper.  You couldn't drink it faster if you wanted to.  The flavor and aroma are almost overwhelming.  Quite an experience."
""
""
"Dark sludgy brown color, no carbonation what so ever. Molasses, cacao, bourbon nose. Fairly full bodied and viscous. Very sweet and super boozy on the tongue dark and sweet. Lindt chocolate. Carmel with the tiniest hint of black licorice. Actually as off put I was with the Zero carbonation, this is actually very good. Very solid sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little too boozy compared to better booze barreled brews."
""
""
"A bit too strong alcoholic flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 This is a very interesting beer and a nice job of blending here. Some aspects are top notch, but the flavors could be a bit more integrated. Sometimes sips are quite brandy forward while others are more chocolate and bourbon forward. I prefer the latter, so hopefully a bit of time in the cellar will result in a more balanced flavor."
""
""
""
"Truly spectacular beer. Poured a deep black with a touch khaki head: exactly what you would expect from a heavy stout. Aroma is sweet and heavy: Brown sugar, molasses, cocoa, fig, vanilla, bourbon. Doesn't really have some of the roastier notes or coffee that some serious stouts do but I'm ok with it. Taste is full bore sweet and rich. Tons of vanilla and fig, chocolate and cherry. Very very sweet, a bit too much if I'm honest. Feel is rich and smooth. Light carbonation. Overall a treat, definitely a slow drinker."

"O- The taste doesn't deliver what the nose promises. The nose on this is fantastic...creating a desire that is not fulfilled in the taste. It's underwhelming...don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, it just doesn't live up to the nose....oh and the alcohol is nowhere to be found....be careful with this one."
""
"O:  Wasn't initially impressed, but as time went on, the beer got better and better.  By the end it was one of the better beers that I have had.  It was on pare with a bourbon county stout that had been aged for five years.  The difference is that the goose island beer is less than half the price -- if you can find it."
""
""
"This so far is my most favorite beer to date (even liked more than Bells Black Note and Founders KBS)... I've been told that just about any beer from Lost Abbey is amazing and this one definitely didn't disappoint.  I was at the San Diego, CA Stone Liberty station bistro/beer garden and they had this by the bottle, maybe 2-3 left I was told and glad to have opportunity to try it."

"What a great beer- very rich and full with amazing length of finish, and an almost syrupy texture, yet it's not too heavy, just deeply flavored. The brandy and bourbon barrels are both in evidence, with chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of scorched wood from the bourbon, and a round, fruity sweetness from the brandy as well as a bit of an edge. Seamlessly integrated, with an overall impression of smores made with some bitter chocolate and a drizzle of booze. Delicious!"

"Pours no head. Very dark. A bright flashlight cannot be seen through the beer without looking through the top showing a dark hued deep amber red. Appears very low carbonation. Smell is cocoa, chocolate and oak; very nice. Taste is mouth meltingly delicious. Chocolate, malty goodness with hints of dry oak and nut with slight hints of brandy and fruit. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied goodness and it hangs around. I really like this beer and it is a must have."
""
""
""
""
"Jet black and impenetrable to light. Just a trace of dark brown head is present. Strong yet sweet aroma of bourbon and brandy is present and loads of deep,dark relentless malt are detectable. The flavor is filled with fig,prunes,black licorice and dark malt. The mouth is gives a cooling sensation and is velvety smooth and very easy to drink considering the strength."

"My first experience with being ""Delivered"" and as the label indicates Sin IS Good! This is how I envision a strong ale should be. Pours dark as night and carbonation higher than anticipated (pleasant surprise there), head dissipating fairly quickly but appropriate to time nonetheless. Set up extremely well in my BCBS snifter. Admired the unique, intense smell from the combination of bourbon and brandy barrel aging. 'tis a sipper to take your time with and enjoy the SIN (Pleasure?) of Deliverance!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark color with a thin, almost non-existent head, probably due to the barrel aging. Aroma is strong, molasses, bourbon. Taste has a bit of smoke to it, sweet brandy with next to no carbonation. Quite the beast and a sipper for sure."
""
""
""
"This one was a surprise, it's interested me for a while, but I never thought I'd be able to try it. Thanks Umberto!"
""
""
"O: Very nice flavors, but it lacked carbonation. Maybe a bad cork seal?"

"I am speechless, and just flat out confused, this is overall the most enjoyable strong ale I have easily ever had, and I am not even sure it is one, as it walks the tightrope of bodied lightness strong ale estered fruit, with dark roasting imperial stout power. Regardless it's just an amazing creation. Flat out stunned and speechless. Near perfection, of something that is so imperfect to begin with, so beautiful."

"Lots of cocoa with an inspiring contribution from the Bourbon and Bandy barrels. The flavors seem to just meld into something reminiscent of a great cake or dessert. If I have learned one thing, Tomme knows how to blend and use barrels. I feel obligated to revisit the Lost Abbey staples that were flat for me 4 years ago. Brilliant."

"It was awkward seeing my friend have a moment with this ale that was somewhere in between an orgasm and a cry. . . But that sums up what this knock-out artist presents to the table. It shows up in a pitch black perfect form behind a beautifully typical piece of religious art work we expect from ""The Lost Abbey"" brewing company. The lowest score it gets from me is smell, for while absolutely aromatic, it isn't a blissful overwhelming sensation you feel that sometimes comes with the stronger stuff like this that ranks up to a damn near 15 ABV. Still, 4.5 is an amazing grade from me and it is shadowed by a phenomenal taste + finish that is sweet, smoky, chocolaty, and as my friend stated in song ""A few of my favorite things"". . . Just beautiful. . ."

"O: Excellent beer, one of the best barrel blends I have ever had, I almost regretted buying this beer because of the price tag, but now I am wishing I picked up a couple more, and will be buying this any time I see it at a bottle shop, must try!"

"O-Overall a great American strong ale so glad to finally get one."
""

"Overall - a little pricey for a 12.7 ounce bottle but very good overall. Worth the splurge."
""
""
"O - Good but not great offering. Not enough going on with the smell and the taste to give it high marks overall. The barrels kind of overwhelm the base beer."

"O - I'm not a big fan of this beer. It's too expensive, and the barrels play too big a roll. The alcohol dominates and depletes any of the substance of the base beers. That being said, however, I'm super glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
""
"O - A very well integrated strong ale. The 12.5% abv is only apparent on the finish. Everything is very well balanced. Highly recommended."

""

"O-A great beer from Lost Abbey, the balance between the brandy and the bourbon barrels was a real delight."
""
"Overall: A lot like BCBS but more going on. Really enjoy this beer, if it wasn't so expensive i would buy all i could find. Very nice balance between the malts and the blend of the barrels. Definitely buy again. $14.99 for 12floz."
""
"O - Taste is superb. Is it worth the price of the bottle? I'm not sure about that, and I'm glad I had the op to have it on tap first."
""
""
"O: I would definitely buy again, I'm intrigued by it's complexity and unique brewing style. More importantly I enjoyed the taste and would say it was worth the hefty single 12 oz bottle price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The smell is absolutely amazing. But the taste, while nice, falls a little shy of all that the aroma promised."

"Part of a special ""barrel"" week at The Beer Junction. $4.00 for a 4oz pour, listed as 12.5% ABV. Deep, rich brown color. Sweet aroma, like maple syrup. Flavor was potent! Alcohol in your face. It was a total palate wrecker. Viscosity was thin-syrupy, low carbonation. Sweet aftertaste. There were particles of something left in the glass. Not sure if it was from the beer or the draft line. No lace left. This was part of a 4 beer sampler (all barrel aged) and I would say it came in 4th but that is because they were all pretty dang good. Definitely not bad and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although it is very expensive I would purchase it again it is a good once and a while type beer. It is very pleasant and has many of the qualities that I enjoy in beers. I know the expense of this beer is a big deterrent to many people but in my opinion because it exemplifies the qualities that i look for in big beers, good palatability, good taste, not a bad mouthfeel, and wonderful complexity that isn't overwhelming I will certainly be recommending this beer to others and purchasing it again."

"Found last one on a shelf at Bin Ends in Braintree MA. I have been looking for this one for awhile and it didn't disappoint. The aroma is of brandy, bourbon and vanilla and taste mirrors that. It is black with no head and very little carbonation.This beer in my opinion was absolutely perfect in every way, I seriously loved this one and so glad I finally found it."

"Overall this is a wonderfully crafted brew with tons of flavor and layers of complexity. It would be great if there was a way to have a little carbonation in some of the barrel aged brews that have no carbonation but i guess you can't have it all. Glad i tried it and you should to if you have a little extra coin."

"Aged bottle (2 years old?) Black with minimal head. Boozy and warming alcohol presence. Tasted next to a GI BCBS 2013 and found many similarities. This had the brandy notes which were excellent and put this over the top for me. Very strong showing here from LA but what else is new?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very tasty. Overpowered by the barrel, but nice."
""
""
"O- decent for a two yr vintage bottle. Wish I had this fresh to compare. Price is pretty steep but well worth it."
"As this warms there is a nice nuttiness coming out, I assume from the brandy (I get a similar flavor from JW Lees Calvados). The flavors later nicely, with more toffee and caramel coming out as well. Just awesome."

"12.5% percent with barrel-age aromas and flavors.... almost black. no carbonation. a bit of alcohol in the taste, but what would you expect with 12.5% ? both brews that are being blended are very nice. not as rich as the 'Belgian' dark ales they produce, which is really nice. I guess blending is the big thing lately with all the breweries and this one doesn't disappoint. time for a return trip to the brewery. but this time sober to start out...."
""
""
"Deliverance does a great job of tampering the sharp roast of hops and without making the beer overly boozy or winy. It delivers the perfect balance while allowing the stout to lead the charge. Supple, refined and astoundingly complex- this ale is best reserved for the most discerning of palates."

"O-This is a tasty, almost-stout like ale. I really enjoyed the bourbon/brandy character here, as it was assertive and complex, without being overwhelming. You can really taste the booze, but you know you are drinking a beer. The feel was a little strange, but not entirely awful. With a sweet and boozy flavor, this is a solid dessert option."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall: One tasty barrel aged brew. All the notes shine individually and really dig the chocolate covers dark fruit and brandy notes. But the oak and vanilla make this brew shine stand out and I really enjoy it! Some people have complained about carb issues on this but I've had none."
""
""
""

"Wow! Just phenomenal. So glad I tried it and can’t wait until I do it again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O - Very dark and boozy and as someone who likes bourbon, enjoyed it. Delicious and easy to drink despite the alcohol content. Overpriced in my opinion at $17 but a very good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Remains me a little of Firestone Walker Anniversary XVI but I think this is more balanced. A very complex and interesting beer, but with a steep pricetag ($15 for 375ml)."
"Overall- Good stuff, but the lack of carbonation in my bottle really held things back."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deliverance pours a almost blackish color with a small head. There is a brandy like, barrel like, spicy malty aroma. The taste has nice strong wood and smokey notes, malty, with hints of a dark wine like flavors. Very nice complete body. Overall an awesome beer."
"Bottle: Poured a dark cloudy brown color ale with a large foamy head with good carbonation and some lacing. Aroma consists of bourbon with residual sugar notes and caramelized sugars. Taste is also dominated by bourbon notes with some caramelized malt and quite a lot of residual sugars. Some dried fruits and light chocolate notes are also perceptible. Body is full with great carbonation and surprisingly no apparent alcohol. Nice nightcap style beer."

""
""
"Pours a black color, almost like a stout. No head to speak of, and really no carbonation either. Bourbon is very strong from the get-go, smell and taste. Almost drinks like a glass of liquor, not beer. I wasn't terribly impressed with this beer mainly because the bourbon taste overwhelms any other beer taste on this one."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've always wanted to try some of the harder to obtain Lost Abbey products and I'm glad paid the high price tag for this one. A unique strong ale that has some very good barrel accents. The body is a little thin and some of the flavor get a little lost."
""
""

"375ml bottle that I only bought because I found it for $11, I feel bad for anyone who paid $17 because this beer is way overpriced. Black color, a decent head, it was not completely flat! Aroma was a bit of booze and malt, meh. Flavor was barrel and grapes, I mostly tasted the angel's share because I kept thinking of cognac. Decent beer but ridiculously overpriced even at $11. Booo."
""

"O-delicious, really enjoyed sipping this one, the blend seems to work well"
""
""
""
"I'm glad I finally got to try and review this beer. I felt a little disappointed just because I din't think it was ""spectacular", but no doubt it was a very good beer. Honestly though, for the price I doubt I'll ever pick up another."
""
""

"Pours without a head so no lace. Pitch black color, no highlights. Very light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Molasses and bourbon nose, flavor is almost burnt, sweet molasses and alcohol. Some alcohol burn. Seriously expensive at $17.99 for a caged & corked 375ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
""
""
"Overall: This one has picked some some interesting flavors from its time in the barrels. Earthy tones accompany the delicious bourbon, chocolate, dark fruit flavors along with a hint of cherry which is nice. Overall, I was satisfied with this brew which mixed some familiar flavors with some different things to make for an interesting beer and its smoothness is exceptional."
""
"D - Great balance barrel aged strong ale. Nice blend of beers."
""
"I'm too drunk to continue but this beer is grand."
"Really sweet and boozy, but kept in check by the hoppiness. Not too bitter, not too woody. Tastes exactly like a whiskey barrel. Huge dark roasted malt flavor with the alcohol scratching at your throat. Sweet and glowering flavor, rich and buttery, endlessly rewarding sipping. The tap version was listed as 10.9% but who knows."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours an extremely dark brown color with no head. none whatsoever...0 carbonation. not unusual considering this is from the lost abbey. smell is bourbon, though no overwhelmingly so. the taste is where this hits the mark. somewhat sweet, with a dominating bourbon flavor. very thick. alcohol is very present but not overbearing. if you are a fan of whiskey then this beer will be a favorite of yours... if that's not your thing, then stay away as you'll hate this one. as for me, bourbon is my favorite...so i really like this beer."

"O- good beer, glad i got to have it"

"How does one review a beer this insane? I'm very glad I divided this with three other people. There's no way I could get through a bottle of this on my own. I would honestly suggest sitting on this for some time to let the heat drop a bit. The stout bourbon and brandy notes are really one of a kind here, but I must warn everyone of their overwhelming characteristics before drinking. This is definitely an ideal digestif, but is better consumed in small portions. Can't say I'd have it again any time soon, but I'm glad I got to try it. There's something to be said about recipes this ambitious in craft beer."
"O: Great beer. Glad I tried one of these. Need to add this to the cellar."
""
""
""
"Overall - Given the ABV and given the shitty carbonation, this beer is begging to be aged. Part of me wishes I did not open this, given the fact I have no access to it until I revisit the US. Assuming the yeast is not dormant, this could age up to 10 years at 12.5 % abv and perhaps become amazing with age. This could also potentially fix the extremely poor carbonation issue. Overall, this is incredibly boozy and not for the faint of heart. If you are not a scotch or bourbon drinker, you may want to stay far, far away from this, as it is an aggressive punch to the head. Delicious and complex. I would buy this again, but at $17/ bottle, hopefully the carbonation isn't an issue when aging or drinking every bottle."
""
""
""
"This is seriously one of the best beers I've ever had. If you have to push elderly people down concrete steps to get to it, well, you might be a terrible person, but so long as you end up with this beer you shall find deliverance. Seriously. Drink it"
""
""
""
""
"Finally took the splash and ponied up the bucks for one of these, and used my own advice of not cellaring something the first time I've had it. Had a rich, deep-deep amber/caramel coloring, and a potent smell. Split it wife my wife while sharing some brownies, and it was a perfect pairing. I got a strong sense of the brandy sweetness, more than I thought with the strong bourbon smell coming out of the snifter. It had a delicious alcohol flavor without too much burn, which was excellent. The only thing that I left out on my scoring was the room for improvement that would very likely occur if left to mellow and blend with time, allowing more of the actual stout and old ale flavors to come out and play."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent blend worth checking out once."
""
""
""
"While expensive at $15 for a 375ml bottle, Deliverance lives up to its promise and then some. Without a doubt, this is one of the best barrel-aged beers I've had the pleasure of tasting."

"Poured into a Lost Abbey Rastal San Marco Glass. Pours a very dark, nearly opaque broown with a fine, half finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark and roasted malt, vanilla, wood and bourbon, nice. Flavor is really, really nice; dark and mildly roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, oak, dark dried fruit, finishes with a hint of brandy and sherry. Medium, creamy bodied. Tastes like a perfect blend of its two components with excellent balance between the Angel's Share and stout. Both are excellent ales and this is also superb. Definitely a very warming alcohol presence, but this too is melded into the flavor well. Heavenly."
""
""
""
"Overall: Gives a feeling of foreboding as you progress through the bottle. The heat from the alcohol is massive and almost overbearing. I couldn't honestly say that the alcohol is well-masked or balanced nicely with the other flavors, but it still works. As I take a sip, I feel criticism for the beer because of this heat, but keep going back for more. It is complex, enjoyable, and definitely sharable. A real ""on the fence"" beer for me. Definitely worth a try and positively worth cellaring."
""

"O: This stout, strong ale blend boasts big flavors and big alcohol with subtleties and nuances that make for a complex and worthy brew. Hope to try the component beers soon."

""
"This poured out as a deep black color with a thin tan head on top. The retention is minimal with a touch of scattered lacing. The smell of the beer is boozy, fruity, wooden, vanilla and bourbon. The taste reflects the nose, rich flavors of roasted malts and caramel in there as well. Subtle vanilla in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth and oily, moderate carbonation. Overall it's very good, really eligant flavors and te mouthfeel is impressive. Well worth the price of admission."
""
"Distinct dried prune, aged look and flavor, surprisingly well balanced barrel-aged stout and bourbon barrel-aged strong ale. Complex aged flavor unlike any other beer I've tried."
""
"Deliver me from evil. Wow, this beer rocks. Strong taste with bourbon and vanilla, fruit like undertones. Great bouquet and nice dark color. I've been waiting for a while to try this beer and was only holding back because of cost. At $16 for a 12 oz bottle, I'm not going to drink too many of these, but I will drink them on days that end in a y. Great overall beer. Nice dark color, sweet vanilla fruity taste and good strong alcohol taste. Love it!"

"All the Angel's Share variants seemed to be quite boozy, but this beer takes the cake. I can only imagine how intolerably hot this must be fresh."

""
"O - Very nice. But this beer had me confused. Maybe for the good, maybe for the bad depending how you look at it. This brew is very hard to classify. Has the look, smell and taste of an Imperial Stout. But the not yet the feel of one but more of an dark ale. Only beer I've had of its kind is Bell's BA Batch 9000. Both blur the lines between beer classification. Did wish there was more of the aged fruit flavor. Didn't taste much, or any at all."

"O - A very pleasant, malty boozy, barrel aged sipping beer with a premium price tag of $16 / 12oz. and it's *almost* worth the price of admission. Much better than Angel's Share and similarly priced. If I drank two of these, I'd increase my rating."

"O: I love both beers individually, but this is a bourbon bomb. A little less alcohol and barrel character would bring this one in my own personal tolerance. Glad to try it, but once is prob. Good."
""
"Opens with a weak cork pop. Pours with no head and an oily sheen. Lots of roast in the aroma and light bourbon. Brandy takes over in the taste with grape notes combined with chocolate. Very boozy and moderately harsh alcohol. Balanced body with minimal carbonation. It's nice to have finally ticked this, but there's no way I'd pay $18 for it again."

For an over 12% barrel aged beer it is exceptionally smooth and there is no fussel to speak of, just a pleasant hint of booze. It is expensive but i am glad I bought more of this. On a side note i do enjoy the bottle format for a beer of this style, I'd like to see more big beers in smaller bottles."

"awesome stuff. 2011 vintage on tap at falling rock taphouse in lodo. the pour on this is jet black, no light passing through at all. two fingers of coffee colored head rest on top and dont go anywhere. alcohol is a dominant smell, tons and tons of bourbon, the charcoal, vanilla, and booze are really intense. big roasty malt body like the serpent, and a certain barleywine style sweetness. this is sure to be a mammoth beer. first taste is not surprisingly, bourbon. cant believe how strong it is. nice dark roast to nearly burnt barley going on, with some coffee and cocoa notes, as well as an almost fruity sort of instance that just arises for a second before being overcome by more high alcohol flavors. this is highly refined, but its also highly punishing. certainly all of 12.5%! massively rich body, thick and sludgey but it a good way, feels like a stout to me, albeit a gigantic one. still there is enough carbonation to keep the flavors moving slowly by. this is delicious stuff, a real treat. its not the bourbon barrel angels share, but its close. simply fantastic, but one or two is about all any reasonable human being can probably handle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall probably the better beers I've had so far from Lost Abbey. Glad to see them getting some carbonation in this one."
"Bottle shared by bvery at Darkness Day 2012, thanks dude! Dark with some head. Aroma and taste as expected, just a delicious mix of an imperial stout and barleywine (my two favorite styles) with the yummy bourbon. Need to try this again and rate under more ideal conditions."
"O: A very good beer. I'm more for IPA's and wheats but certain strong ales (belgian, american, etc.) just simply fit the mood. I'm not sure if it is worth the cost but it is one that I will routinely try to get my hands on - impossible to do in Indiana but anytime I'm in Philly Monk's is on my list and at least once a year I will fork over the money for this one."
""
""
"O: Based on the nose, I thought this was going to nail down a top ten score. Thus, it's a massive letdown, and probably not really recommendable given the high price. I remember liking the first vintage a lot more. I'll have to do a side by side, eventually."

"Overall an outstanding marriage of barrels and beer. Probably my favorite Lost Abbey beer ever."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a nice offering from Lost Abbey but it just isn't my cup of tea. The two beers I feel are better by themselves and really don't mesh in a harmonious fashion for me. While it is definitely not a bad beer, I just don't think I have the need to venture out and purchase it with the inflated price tag, but finding it on draft is more than reasonable and worth a go for sure."
""
"Pours jet black with a small light tan head. In the aroma, huge bourbon presence. In the taste, mellow bourbon notes, with a small malty roast in the there. A small alcohol bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry vanilla and bourbon like aftertaste. Big bourbon all day, notes of vanilla, alcohol, and a small roasty malt."
""
""
"O - I'm pretty glad that I have a couple more bottles laid down. This is a beer to age and to savor. It's also a beer to be shared. The huge ABV and complexity of the beer lends itself to being split 2 or 3 ways and enjoyed as a group. Fantastic beer."
"O: It's not bad, the stout character is mostly swallowed up by all the brandy and bourbon. Surprising, especially given the decent age on this one. Might have to age one for maybe 5 years and see how it turns out. Too hot, too much spirits, not enough stout at this stage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very tasty brew, but one of the biggest sippers out there as they don't hide the booze one bit!"
""
"O: I'm not sure what the brandy barrels brought into this but the bourbon was most evident to me. this beer is very good though, it has a huge nose but the flavor is there in abundance without punching you in the face. I should have drank this one sooner. I have another bottle and I'm looking forward to revisiting this beer next year."
""
"Overall: A wonderfully delicious and complex beer. Pricey, but definitely worth it to try this jewel. Only a slightly thicker mouthfeel is keeping this beer from being essentially perfect."
""
""
"Drinkability – This is a great bourbon beer, which usually isn’t one of my favorite flavors. Either bourbon beers are growing on me, or I’m a sucker for the ones with a hint of sweetness, which is the case here. Or maybe the brandy was a nice touch."
""
""

"I'm a moderate fan of Serpent Stout, and only a marginal fan of The Angel's Share, but this blend is absolutely fantastic!"
""
"Overall: this one is very drinkable and very mild. the drinkability is excellent. very smooth."
"D - Really thick and sweet with a complex, dense sugar and slice character. The barrel character is readily apparent with a coffee flavor that is dark and enhoyable but balanced by the intense malt and surgary sweetness."
""
"A good effort but not a great one... too boozy and sweet for its own good..."
"M - Medium body with a good chew. The carbonation is low but still present. Would like a little more carbonation, but still drinking well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not something I would crave every day -- it's pretty sweet and big and boozy, so it's definitely a limited consumption kind of beer, but when it's time to drink it, it will not let you down. I don't know if I needed an entire 64 oz. growler either, but I'm going to do my damnedest to kill it off."
""
"2012 Vintage: All of the above but even more balanced, much more drinkable. One of the better vintages."
""
""
"Backlog purge. Bottle poured into a snifter. Dark dark brown with a lasting tan head. Luscious aroma with sweet chocolate and vanilla and an undercurrent of spicy bourbon. Flavor is fudge and toasted oak, dark chocolate, roasted malt, vague raisiny fruitiness, sweet alcohol. Fluffy moussey body, devilish and great."
""
"I haven't had Angel's Share (I missed my chance last time it was available) but I hear its awesome and Serpent's Stout is literally one of the best stouts I have ever had so I go into this excited. Nose is surprisingly sweet. Vanilla, sherry, caramel, oak, cherries, chocolate, chocolate covered cherries, plums, figs, dark fruits and grape. Taste is strong, oak flavors up front with vanilla and chocolate. Cherries and grapes follow with some assistance from dark fruits. Definite booziness; warming but not overwhelming. The barrels really come through in an awesome way and they don't fight each other. There are very distinct bourbon notes up front followed right on the heels by the fruitier brandy flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, silky, slightly hot and awesome. This is one the greatest barrel aged ales I have ever tasted, hands down."
""
""
""
""
"O - Well put together. Just class through & through."
""
"O - I'll be honest: while I am a sucker for double IPA and aggressive beers on the opposite end of the spectrum, I also like aggressively boozey beers. This is one of the latter. If you don't dig imperial stout and Belgian quads/DSAs, don't bother with this beer. but if you do dig boozey beers that aren't necessarily balanced by hop bitterness, jump all over this stuff. Definitely a candidate for aging. I bet after 2 or 3 years it would be magical."
""
"O- Another solid barrel-aged beer from the Lost Abbey."
""
""
"Overall: An amazing beer, and one I like better than Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share. My only complaint, if at all, is that it is severely sweet. But I'm just nitpicking with that one. Definitely get this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can definitely taste both the Angel's Share and Serpent's Stout, so the blend is pretty competent. The barrel character is quite good but the heavy wood has thinned the beer out a bit. Overall a very good blend, but not the tastiest BA strong ale out there."
"I'm a bit torn here. The smell and flavor of the beer are top notch, but the look and mouthfeel are far from superior. I wish the beer was just slightly cabonated - previous bottles I've had were."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a dense, mocha-colored head that settles to a nice cap. Insane aromas of chocolate-covered raisin, brandy, bourbon, caramel, and brown sugar. Phenomenal nose. Big, boozy, and bold, with tons of chocolate, raisin, brandy, and caramel. Sweet and boozy, with a slightly ""hot"" finish. The definition of decadence. Velvet-smooth mouthfeel, with a medium-full body and just-right carbonation. Such a great beer, easily one of the best I've had from Lost Abbey."
""
"Poured from 375ml bottle into snifter. Poured a beautiful oil black with dark tan full head. The aging comes through in the aromas coming from this beer, oaky, brandy/bourbon with some dark fruit or sugar. The mouthfeel was think and viscus almost warm from the booze over powering the malt characteristics. Agree with many of the other reviewers that the alcohol shows through perhaps a bit too much on this one. The barrel aging brings out some interesting after notes on the finish but I think this would improve if I had let is sit for awhile."
"D: They did everything right here. I wasn't crazy about angel's share, but the balance here is exactly what it was missing."
""
""
"Dark brown body, with a ring of brown head. Big legs, no retention however. Nose of sweet alcohol, dark chocolate, caramel candies, dark fruit and candi sugar. Oak and fudge as well. Alcohol is again prominent on the palate, fudge, oak and dark fruits. Brandy is a little more prominent that the bourbon, although both stand out in a boozy fashion. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous and boozy. Low carbonation, but not flat. A really good BA'd beer/blend - really brings forward some characteristics that I felt were reminiscent of BB4D in a really good way."
""
""
""
"O: disappointing for the price that is it sold at, but glad I tried it. There are many other brews that are much less expensive and more well balanced than this one. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good brew, but this was a one timer for me. I highly recommend laying this one down for an extended period of time to mellow out the bold alcohol because it is just too dominating at this moment."

"Great mix of two great outputs from Lost Abby. Another home run!"

""
"This beer is in my top 5%. I actually thought Lost Abbey's Angel Share was even better (the Bourbon barrel version) so it isn't a surprise I loved this. Deliverance is part Angel's Share and part Serpent's Stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: Rarely do I feel like a beer needs to be aged, but this beer is very boozy and I believe it could develop some with age. Still decent, but I think I'll lay a couple of these down for a while."
""
""
""
"Served in a snifter, a thick black pour with a thin cap of chocolate head that dwindled to a ringlet. Creamy chocolate and vanilla on the aroma, smooth bourbon, caramel, minor vinous notes. Taste thick with dark malts, chocolate, a moderate roastiness, bourbon-soaked wood, vanilla, lesser notes of fruitcake brandy, brown sugar, tobacco. Smooth and dangerously mellow, and a bit too drinkable for a higher octane brew. Yummy."
""
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger fizzy dark tan head, with a big oil slick in the middle of the glass. The nose is malty, sweet, with some cherries, bourbon, brandy, figs, raisins, plums. The taste is very nice, malty, with lots of dark fruits, and a nice touch of bourbon/brandy, slight chocolate note. Full/Medium body, ABV hidden very well. It's been awhile since I've had a LA brew, but this one is a very very tasty brew, highly recommended. Thanks David!"

"O: Good, not great. A nice sipping beer, but really lacks in the mouthfeel dept. Try if you have not had it before, but not drinkable quantities above one bottle..."
"Overall: I got this in a trade as an extra and love it. For a BA beer, this is world class. The complexity is great, the sweetness is very much there (almost a bit too much even) but the distinct brandy and bourbon notes are awesome."
"Overall, I desperately wish we could get Lost Abbey here in the north woods. If their other beers are even half as good as this, I would be their biggest customer. WANT."
""
""
"Hard, vigorous pour produces a thin, fleeting light tan head that faded to a thin collar with no lace on top of an opaque, still and viscous milk chocolate. Strong, barrel heavy and boozy nose, dominated by brandy and vanilla, raisin, plum and brown sugar. Medium full body with trace, light carbonation. For this type of beer the lack of carbonation isn't a problem but for this particular beer wears out my tolerance for the flavor quickly. Still extremely hit and boozy, with a very sweet profile, Belgian yeast, raisin, molasses, vanilla, brandy and chocolate malt. Carbonation would help, but this would still be a chore to drink."

"As a whole, this is certainly very good beer, and for the most part the barrel aging does wonders for what was almost certainly a very good brew to begin with. The only negatives come late in the mouthful, when the heady alcoholic vapors somewhat overtake the brew, and in the slightly strange lighter-than-expected mouthfeel. Very much worth trying, especially for fans of barrel-aged Imperial Stouts."

"This brew is truly spectacular. I have yet to try the two brews that make up this masterpiece, but I will seek them out (and perhaps mix them together). This beer is an expensive yet special treat that is worth the price of admission."
"Pours a deep sable a scratch above black with a thick, if not persistent, tan head. Malty aroma has a strong overtone of bourbon-soaked wood and hints of toffee and chocolate. Distinctive flavor has malty, bourbon, woody, molasses, coffee, fruity - how many notes are there? I seem to get different ones with each sip! And whoa, what an alcohol bite, like a liquid pit bull that has decided your tongue is a juicy steak! Texture has firm body and plenty of fizz and sass, and the tingle it leaves behind decided to sit for a spell. This beer is worth going through hell, high water, airport security and over-affectionate great aunts to get."
"O: This beer was very good, but it didn't live up to the hype. I'm glad I tried it and I think it's a pretty nice offering, but it wasn't worth the price tag."

"Poured from a bottle into a 5.5 oz. Firestone Walker snifter. Pours jet black with a thin mocha cap. Head recedes quickly. The nose is boozy with hints of vanilla and coffee. You can smell both brandy and bourbon, although the brandy is more prevalent. This is a fabulous tasting beer. It's like a coffee stout with some of the best barrel notes ever. Vanilla is present but subtle. This is all about the barrels. You can detect both the bourbon and brandy in harmony. The mouth si sooo smooth. Straight silk. Yet, it has a touch of effervescence to it. Great finish. Thank you, Lost Abbey. This is how it's fuckin' done."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, vintage 2011. This is my two year anniversary review, very excited. Poured aggressively and got a huge 3 inch mocha head with plenty of lacing. It pours a slick black and the head settles into patchy foam, but the lace hangs around awhile. Smell is bourbon, vanilla, prunes, leather, and roasted coffee. Taste is even better than the smell for me. Lots of vanilla and bourbon up front, with roasted coffee and bourbon lingering in the finish. Body is medium large, nice amount of carbonation, especially for its ABV, a little dry, but that is expected, and very drinkable for what it is. The taste assaults you in a great way every sip and makes you crave another sip. This is wonderful, but I would still take Serpent Stout alone over this. That isn't a shot at this, but explains my deep affection for Serpent Stout."
""
"O - Very good barrel aged beer from The Lost Abbey. Alcohol is a bit hot right now. I might suggest putting a couple years on this one to round out things even smoother. At $16 for a 375ml bottle this one is a bit on the expensive side. Well done though."
""
"Thanks, mrmiles, for the opportunity"
""
"Having only sampled the Serpent's Stout prior to drinking this, I wasn't really sure what to expect except a ton of booze and that's pretty much what I got. With this much oomph behind it, you definitely have to pace yourself when drinking it. Blended beers are easy to mess up, but The Lost Abbey has something pretty good with Deliverance. Would definitely like to try this a bit more age on it, as the complexity of the taste would very likely improve."

"Overall this is an amazing beer. Tough to justify the price tag when there are so many good ba stouts out there, but it gets pretty damn close. The Angel's Share blend really gives it a unique twist."

"O: Overall this was a solid, complex brew. The mix of the two styles and two barrels mixed well. Would like to try the two separate now. Also would have like to age it for awhile to see if some of the alcohol would have settled but it wasn't my brew to crack. So thanks Wyatt and Ocean!"

"Deliverance is ripe with divine, rich flavors. Sure it's really hot, but that doesn't affect how damn delicious it is. It's a beast of a beer. One that requires all your time and attention. Drink one now and lay one down for a few years down the road. This is outstanding stuff."

"The exceptional Deliverance pours an opaque black, with a thin tan head that dissipates rather quickly, yet manages to leave a decent lace throughout. A dark bouquet of deep roasted nuts, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol intermingle with hints of bourbon and brandy, a truly interesting playground for the senses. The flavors of this beer are as numerous and complex. Many of the same aromas are found in tasting, as well as hints of fig, plums and dates. The alcohol is big at 12.5%, and a slight burn is noticeable in the finish. The strong and complex brew features a creamy, big body that is dominant over a low level of carbonation. WOW!"

"Full bodied, lower carbonation (no, it's not flat), very creamy and slick on the tongue. I've had both of the base beers more than once and this is a nice marriage between the two. I still think my favorite of these LA offerings is the bourbon angel's share, but then again it always depends on what vintage you get."
"Drink- Overall, a good blended stout/strong ale beer. Had high notes of the ABV and some low notes with the prickly feel. I will come back to this one."
"T: Opens on the sweet side with some raisin bread, vanilla, fudge and dark fruit and then dries out and finishes with some burnt raisin, roasted malt and glorious bourbon. A great warming sensation with every sip without feeling too hot. This is without a doubt my favorite Lost Abbey beer to date."

"375 ml bottle poured to Duvel tulip the beer pours a deep dark viscous black with dark brown edges in the light. Small 1/4 finger brown head with some retention and nice lacing. Little carbonation. The nose is a pleasant mix of bourbon and brandy with hints of oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and roasted malt. Smells great. The flavor is even more complex with an initial rush of fig and raisins and prunes before the bourbon and vanilla oak flavors come in. Roasted malt. Mildly bitter. Not hint of the higher abv, very impressive. Rich and full bodied with light carbonation. Finishes very smooth. Overall, this is fantastic! I'd love to pick more up and age. It's already mellow and tasty though. Highly recommended!"
""
""
"Pours an opaque dark brown/black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of vanilla, wood, bourbon, and brandy. Taste is very much the same with some dark roasted malt and cocoa flavors. There is an alcohol kick that warms the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is very tasty and left me wanting more."
""
""
""
"O: Delicious. Decadent, rich and very complex. I really enjoyed the different layers of flavors. I haven't had this fresh, but at two years it's drinking remarkably right now."
""
"O: Just too strong of an alcohol presence in this beer for it to be easily drinkable - this beer is one to sip over a fairly extended period of time. Too much heat for me but the flavors that do come through are quite pleasant."
"O: This is definitely a sipping beer due to its strength and the strong presence of alcohol in the smell and taste. This could make for a good after dinner drink."

"O: Really nice complexity and integration, with layers of interesting flavors which change as the beer warms. Although I didn't really detect bourbon. As enjoyable as this was, I think I'd prefer Angel's Share straight up."
"This is an interesting, very enjoyable beer. Aggressively strong, uncountable flavors, and lots of alcohol, it's an experience. The beer itself is black...what little head there is shows as a faint chocolate milk ring. The aroma is boozy (like a strong port), with chocolate, plum, molasses, and sugar. Loads of malt...not much of a hop aroma. It's a bomb of fruity esters, alcohols, melanoidins, and sugars. Wow. The taste is not as sweet as expected....a solid keel of bitterness keeps the beer on balance. Alcohol helps too. Very warming...whew. Full in body, but a bit more carbonated that necessary. It's a little disjointed...a hodgepodge of flavors (all intense) that come together in different ways."
""
"I want more!"
"Somehow this blend of stout, strong ale, bourbon barrel and brandy barrel turns into an excellent concoction, the flavors from each entity are there and huge. The booze makes this a slow sipper for sure, I'm sure it would benefit from some aging."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this ale. At $16 something I can't afford to make this a everyday drinker, but for an occasion or just to treat for myself, this is a must have in the cellar. I got three and now that I tried one fresh, I am curious to see what some time does and I will surly pick up some more before I can't find it anymore."
"Overall: very boozy dark beer. great sipping beer filled with bourbony goodness."
"O- This is one amazing beer. Bourbony and boozy, sweet, with a strong alcohol presence. How this beer achieves so much balance is a true achievement. I want more! A true beergasm!"
"M - Full, rich and smooth, good carbonation, creamy finish. Even after almost two years, this one is still quite boozy. That said, it's really smoothed out since I had it fresh, and it's definitely more enjoyable now then ever. I think another year will do this some more good...might be perfect by then!"
""
"Full body with minimal carbonation, maybe a bubble of carbonation pricking the tongue here and there. Not too syrupy though, mainly creamy and slightly chewy. A bit of alcohol warmth on the back of the throat, but still very drinkable for big beer. I'm not a big fan of the brandy Angel's Share, but this blend with a bourbon barrel aged Serpent's Stout was enjoyable."
""
""
"The serpent stout does a good job of taking the edge off of the Angel's Share, but in my opinion, that is what is so good about the Angel's Share. This is a nice blend, but I would much rather have each of these beers by themselves, or less Serpent Stout in the mix."

"D: overall, quite the sipper. big range of aroma and flavor. not sure if i can totally justify the price tag on this sucker ($15 for a 12.7 oz. bottle) but i was very excited to see lost abbey bottles in NJ."

"Overall: Good beer but for me the bourbon and brandy dominate. Very pricey."

"This one is as dark night, love the art work on the bottle... yeah yeah I know... any way. The smell of this thing is incredible. Dark fruit with caramel a hint of brandy. The taste is just shy of over whelming, very powerful and full. Sweet with a light bit of tartness. It is how ever just a bit sticky in the mouth kind of like a light molasses would be. This is a very thick beer for sure. Very well done and with all they put in to it, it is no wonder at all why it is so thick but over all very well done. Love this one."
"O: A definite sipper. This would be a great desert beer. It's delicious and complex but it's pretty hot as far as alcohol goes. My only qualm is it's quite expensive at $15 for a 12.7 oz."

"You know what you're getting into with this one, and it doesn't disappoint."
"Overall: This beer definitely improved with age. It is very smooth and perfectly balanced."
"what a solid beer, id definatly seek this out if youve never had it. very similar to HotD's matt. the bourbon and apple brandy barrels really make up this beer."
"My fourth Lost Abbey and the first truly great one. Worth the price? Almost. I'll buy it again if I see it."
"Tastes similar but not that great. I'm enjoying it but it's not a combinatio of flavours that thrills me. Carbonation level is good. Overall interspersing and enjoyable but not thrilling"
"In sum, if it weren't for the carbonation issue, this would be an extraordinary beer. As is, it is still solidly above average and worth a try."
"What a treat. Wish I had more. Like… a lot more! I’m gonna go ahead and say this is in my top 5 all-time. Worth every high-priced penny."
"Cheers"
"The palate opens with some heat with a blend of brandy and bourbon, fruity, vinous and with some coconut from the barrels. Along with that, there's a blend of complex malt flavors - a little bit of chocolate, some roasted malt bitterness (which does help temper the barrel sweetness). The malt from the Angel's Share is hidden behind the prominent barrel character, but is still noticeable. Moderately drying on the finish, this beer finishes long with vanilla and flavors of brandy barrel tartness (NOT sourness) that's more akin to a pomace tannins and a mild vinous character. Medium in body and *perfectly* carbonated, there's a soft, lush carbonation that helps the beer slide gracefully down my gullet. Recommended, despite the high price."
"Overall: Really good beer with great flavors. Highly recommended very enjoyable beer"
"Overall- possibly my favorite beer from lost abbey and the complexity to this one is phenomenal."
"overall: great"
"O- This beer is too delicious, I feel like I just did something illegal by drinking this."
"Overall I have to say that this is most certainly one of the best beers I've had. I limit most of my reviews to beers that are unique or unusually good or bad, but I have to say that this brew is phenomenal. This is easily in my top 5, I would definitely take one over KBS any day."
"2010 Vintage. Pours a dark brown that is on the verge of black with a tiny brown head that disappears very quickly. Scent is packed with inviting bourbon aromas, lovely malt aromas, and delicious dark fruits. Dark chocolate and toffee as well. Taste is absolutely amazing. Initially I get dark chocolate and dark fruit flavors immediately followed by bourbon and vanilla oak. Nice alcohol burn as well. Mouthfeel is EXTREMELY creamy with very light carbonation. Somewhat of a syrupy finish. Drinkability is fairly high...It is delicious, but definitely a sipper. Overall, this is an awesome beer from Lost Abbey that I would gladly purchase again."
"O- Lots of flavors, all of them good too! Very powerful, big beer. The alcohol heat is the only drawback. Have to sip through this beer, but very enjoyable. Would like to see what happens to the flavors as this ages for a while."
"O: Overall a phenomenal beer, very well balanced with little to nothing I would change."
"O: Bourbon and alcohol dominate Deliverance, which is somewhat expected, given the big abv. I'm docking the beer for that. In fact, I'm probably be generous as it has dodged infection, so far. "
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is medium bodied with very fine carbonation; overall experience seems kind of thin. Pretty slick and oily feel in the mouth. Overall, this beer was almost there for me. A little less confusion between the brandy and bourbon would have made for a phenomenal beer. As it is, I call it pretty good but not outstanding."
"Overall: I was really planning to cellar this for at least a year, possibly two, but considering tonight was my father-in-law's 50th birthday, a pretty big day, and since he was cool enough to buy this for us, I thought we'd toast him tonight! The scrore I'm giving this beer here would likely be higher w/a bit more time on it to mellow the booze a bit and let the individual flavors emerge. The aromas, on the other hand, are awesome already."
"All in all, kinda wish I let this one ride a little more. I think it will figure itself out with age and actually get a job."
"4.5 D: Best LA beer I've had. I didn't think I'd enjoy this nearly as much as I have, but I'm glad I did."
"Poured a black color with an average creamy brown head that lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy toasted chocolate malt, caramel, dark fruit and alcohol aroma. Heavy bittersweet toasted dark chocolte malt flavor with a heavy bittersweet and small alcohol bite finish of long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is a top 50 standout beer."
"Big thanks goes out to billab914 for sending me multiples of this one in past trades! Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger brown fizzy head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sweet alcohol, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and peat. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, raisins, peat, big sweet alcohol, dark chocolate, and very subtle wood. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one had a nice sweetness going on here with just a hint of bitterness to help bring it all together. Still pretty boozy though. I could see this one being great down the road with a little more time in the cellar to mature."
"These Lost Abbey Barrel Aged strong ales are so expensive, but damn are they good. I can't resist trying every one I come across, and when I lived in Boston I swear there was one on-tap at the Sunset all the time, which made it even easier. Regardless of price, Deliverance is a very good beer that manages to balance a big malty body with nice barrel characteristics. Pretty good at hiding the big ABV, although you do know going into this one that it's going to pack a punch."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the best Lost Abbey beers I have tried."
"A very interesting complex beer."
"Very nice beer overall. Definitely impressed and wish I had another one. "
"Just an amazing beer with very nice tounge tingling carbonation. Only thing keeping this from a 5 is the level of alcohol heat. Instant palate burn that follows through deep into the chest. But don't let this minute detail deter you from the level of delicious complexity this beauty throws out....christ. Thick, creamy, velvety luscious mouthfeel. A blend of brandy fruitiness and bourbon sweetness hit the entire palate and lingers and lingers. Full of toasty oak, coconut, vanilla bean,dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, tobacco, flint, oak, more woodsy boozy notes, prune, black fig, raisin, light anise, burnt sugar, molasses, reduction of dates and liquor. Some earthy notes and some wood tannin on the finish. So much going on and so damn complex. I've a couple more bottles in the cellar and this thing has years of cellarability."
"O - Another stellar offering from Lost Abbey. VERY strong beer with intense flavors and wonderful wood aging. The flavor complexions make it fun to drink but the intensity of it make it a wonderful sipper."
"O: Overall I am very pleased with this Lost Abbey offering, high price, but even higher enjoyment levels. A bourbon character that is hard to match, without being too highly boozy. The ABV is warming, without being too overpowering to distract the palate from the other complexities that are being interchanged. Very grateful to have tried this limited blend."
"O: I really enjoy this beer, too bad its hard to find and expensive. As I said before this is always a much welcomed treat! Thanks Dave."
"375 ml bottle. Pours a very dark brown with a small tan head that leaves a very small amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is pretty awesome. Big bourbon, light vanilla, caramel, brandy, light leather, a bit of oak, chocolate, and a decent amount of alcohol. All the flavors come together quite nicely. The initial taste is sweet with some plum and bourbon. You also get some caramel, oak, chocolate, and brandy. The finish is pretty boozy with significant alcohol heat. Medium body. Low carbonation. Enjoyable beer. I would have rated the taste higher if there wasn't so much alcohol too it. I'm curious if this will get much better with time."
"O: The best all around offering from LA that I've had, definitely worth the beers I traded for it. I am saddened that this is the second bottle of this that I've had. Such is life. Nicely done here. Very enjoyable."
"Overall: This beer was a joy to drink. I just love the taste. I would definitely like more if we aren't all raptured out of here."
"Overall this is a good brew but the alcohol can make it tough to enjoy not only because it smashes out some of the taste but also I can't have more then one 375mL before my senses are dulled by the high ABV. Good beer though."
"Very enjoyable altogether, enjoyed it much better than the other non-sour LA beers."
"This pours with a deep darkness that allows for a bit of light to show through at the top of the glass. This pours with little to no foam, but does have the small carbonation swirls. Its aroma of deep dark chocolate, roast, and slight fig/raisin. Its taste is of deep rich oaked bourbon, with notes of dark chocolate and a sweet vanilla with a slight caramel. When it comes to mouthfeel it coats the tongue with a velvety texture. Overall, I was pretty impressed with this blend. I have had both of the parents of the blend and by themselves are amazing. On a whole this goes in the category of one of Tomme's/Lost Abbey's best beers to date. For the price this was worth it."
"A very enjoyable brew as in with most lost Abbey one off's or limited production it was too pricey for such a small bottle."
"O - Not bad, but this beer was certainly nothing special in a sea of heavy, boozy, strong beers."
"Probably the best I've had from Lost Abbey. Looking forward to the next batch."
"This is more a special variation on Angel's Share more than anything else. the only addition from Bourbon Serpent's Stout is some roastiness and bubbles. Thank goodness for those bubbles."
"A very flavorful and interesting beer. Although initially quite rich and intense, there is also many subtle layers of flavor underneath to be discovered. A very nice dessert beer."
"Very nice in small quantities, an almost sensory overpowering treat like an ultra rich mouse."
"Wouldn't necessarily buy this beer in the bottle, but the price for it on tap made it enjoyable for sure. A nice 'special' occasion beer."
"O: The nose was a fireball but the flavor was much better. The beer as a whole though is simply nothing I would ever want again."
"I poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle into a snifter. The pour is jet black, thin tan head. The aroma is full of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. The first sip is hot. After the initial hot alcohol a ton a vanilla, chocolate and sweet bourbon is released. It has a lingering bourbon finish. The body is full, light carbonation. A great beer from LA. The bottle went down very smooth and easily, must try."
"Overall, starts off like a Double Stout with strong hints of bourbon and brandy and ends like an Angel’s Share with a copious quantity of dark chocolate malts. In short, yum, yum, yum. I could easily knock back three per sitting."
"On an ANGRIER note, it really pisses me off that Lost Abbey puts a pseudo-intellectual-theological bullshit spiel on the back of their labels. It's a fucking BEER. How about telling me what's in the damn bottle and when it was brewed instead of a lame fairytale? I shouldn't have to do a google search to find out what I'm drinking. Minus 162 cool points."
"I'm glad this beer exists and had an enjoyable session with it."
"Overall, this beer was a very pleasant surprise. A lot of Lost Abbey's big beers and non-sours have been very disappointing lately with all of the QC issues but this was a very good beer. Plenty of carbonation and not syrupy at all. I found it to be complex and very tasty. Recommended!"
"(D)- A good strong ale. Sweet and rich, but definitely not worth the high price tag."
"Overall, its damn good and damn surprising. Was not expecting this (had no idea what brandy was/is) but this is just awesome."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. I HIGHLY recommend pouring this beer and letting it aerate and warm a little, as my first sip was like trying to taste four different things at once. Let it mellow and give it a few sips, as it certainly gets better the longer its in the glass (which won't be for long!)"
"Overall: This is a fine, big, sipping beer that is very warming. This is too expensive to drink often though I wish I had a couple more to space out over time. One of the better LA beers that I've had."
"Finally getting around to reviewing this; my second bottle. Poured into the ol' trusy shaker glass a dark brown/black with very little head. Decent carbonation with aroma of booze/alcohol and malt. Taste was chocolate and bourbon with a little bit of sourness (maybe it's the booziness?). Definitely glad I have a couple more bottle of this one."
"Smell is quite complex with an excellent presence of both bourbon and brandy with some oak, chocolate, vanilla, roast malt, caramel, toffee and everything else that is wonderful about these two blended adult beverages. Translates perfectly into the taste and I am already regretting not buying more of this when it was available. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with low, but fairly reasonable for the style. I wish I had another to drink after this one."
"Overall - What a sipper. I would have liked a bit more of a sweetness in the middle, but otherwise a top-notch offering from a huge blend. Glad I have a few more. I'll be saving these to see how they last."
"Bottle. Corks pops off with a nice little pop, hoping this one is carbonated. Poured into a duvel tulip glass a dark brown almost black color wih a slight tan head. Nice aroma of bourbon in the nose, I really don't get the brandy at all but that's ok. Vanilla, dark roast, chocolate, and booze rounds out the rest of the nose. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very rich flavors! A mix of lots of flavors; dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, booze, and black licorice in the flavors. Really nice. A sipper for sure. Alcohol warms the body while drinking this one."
"SkÅL!"
"O - A solid, drinkable beer with nice complexity, despite the forwardness of the bourbon. I have another bottle that I think I'll sit on for another year, but I'm very happy to have opened this one. Cheers,"
"D - Fantastic after dinner drink; one of my favorites; loved it; this optimizes the after dinner sweet beer drink everyone should enjoy; have one and I'm positive you'll want a lot more after"
"I feel warmed as I continue to sip, but I'm also not hit over the head by the 12.5%. These things are way too expensive to drink on the regular and the 12.5% would catch up quickly to you. I still enjoyed my first offering from Lost Abbey and would be interested to pick more up if I can come across them."
"While I'm full of rich superlatives for this beer, (surprisingly?) it isn't all that drinkable (in large quantity!). My 10oz. pour is far too much for me; I'm actually sharing it with those around me willfully. That being said: This beer rocks!"
"d - I have to say I was a bit nervous as I popped the cork...didn't make the trademark POP that I love when opening a beer. it was more of a pfttt...none-the-less the beer was plenty carbonated. My overall impressions left me feeling that I drank sangria and not a beer...pretty amazing that it was a beer though. She's a big beer. A sipper. Very glad I was able to find this at Julio's when I was in Boston not too long ago, but not something I'd actively pursue again."
"D: This is a sipper, like a brandy but I enjoyed it."
"If a beer is this nice, I will drink it. It's a heavy drop and one for sharing, but it's amazing, so smooth, so tasty."
"M/D - Medium bodied, as the alcohol seems to thin this beer out a bit. Not much carbonation. Overall, an interesting attempt at blending and fairly enjoyable, but definitely not worth the price tag."
"Overall an awesome beer I want to sit on for a while to see how it changes. Glad I picked a few up."
"D - Highly drinkable for 12.5%, great stuff, would love to drink again."
"D- the beer is huge and makes itself known. im glad it comes in the little bottles, because i dont think i could tackle a full 750 by myself. its also a little pricey for any thoughts of another one, but its something ill look forward to opening again in the future."
"Super easy to drink, a very nice offering from the Lost Abbey, that is going great on a bitterly cold night awaiting another La Nina snow storm!"
"Another score from Lost Abbey. Quickly moving up the ladder as one of my all time favorites."
"Ooh, it's a lovely beer. Roasty, complex, boozy, chocolate, sweet and rich. Really fantastically good, and such an inspired blend of two other good beers. But where other blendings seem to just provide the average of their component parts, this one has synergy which propels it to true excellence."
"Reviewed about a year later, on September 16. Increased amounts of both of toffee and alcohol in the flavor. It’s still pretty damn hot and seems more solvent and barleywine-like. Chocolate lingers in the background. Not an improvement, and in fact is a bit worse than I remember it. The second glass showed more of its sweet goodness, but this is not the beer I remember."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and carbonation is low, but not non-existent. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed it. Definitely showed a lot of bourbon to it, but the beer flavors came out nicely as well. A little hot still but would probably age nicely. Very nice bourbon forward beer overall."
"A nice beer, I like the complexity that it has, even if some of it can seem a bit dubious at times (the tartness can seem a bit out of place at times, even though I don't think this is in any way infected). It does seem to prove out my growing feeling that beers over a certain alcohol percentage should not be Barrel aged as they get too hot and boozy (which this one does). This would be quite the enjoyable beer in small doses; the first 2-4 ounces of this beer were much better than what the beer ended up being. Still this is not bad, and even has its enjoyable moments."
"Poured into snifter. Pours a deep brown, almost black. Head quickly recedes, leaves lacing, and looks very inviting, with moderate carbonation. Smells very boozy, bourbony, chocolate/mocha notes, toffee, coffee, vanilla. Tastes like a chocolatey coffee, again picking up the vanilla, some brandy, very boozy; strong alcohol taste, dark fruits, maybe some figs. Thin to medium bodied, watery almost, very dry finish. Delicious beer, but with the price tag - the overly booziness, and the thin mouthfeel, would have if it was offered to me, but probably will not buy again."
"The heat makes this one drink rather poorly. I've had this problem with a lot of Lost Abbey beers before. The alcohol heat seems to be present from start to finish, and by the swallow it's not a warming sensation but an actual unpleasant flash of heat moving down my throat. Reminds me a lot of Santa's Little Helper, which also has this problem. With many more years on this, who knows, this could be sorted out, but this was the only negative aspect of an otherwise great beer."
"D - Definitely a sipper and one worth sharing with a friend. A bit of alcohol heat here but I really like it mixed with everything else going on. Nicely done, but I'm wondering what some age might do to this one."
"Overall, I really liked this beer and I'm glad I picked it up. The price tag is definitely steep, but I liked it enough that I'm glad I picked it up."
"Medium bodied and slick on the tongue with modest carbonation. Certainly a sipper and overall a nice beer, but there is something just on the periphery with these Lost Abbey beers that leaves me wanting just a bit more. Not sure if it's the beaten-to=death carbonation issues (though this beer is fine) or something a little less tangible."
"Deliverance had a slight pop with the cork out, the liquid was a dark brown bordering on black color. Some dark tan bubbles even came up about a few centimeters and stayed, Bravo! Small notches that eventually let go. Smell is a tamer version of the bourbon barrel AS IMO, I still get alot of bourbon notes, less brandy and some roast from the serpent's. Oak and molasses. Very smelly. Taste is nice and the carb really adds a punch to this as well, Im use to flat bottles that go nowhere. Bourbon blended with roast and a sweet Belgian yeast strain, some vanilla clashing with faint brandy and some oak to round it all out. A dark tasty beer that is big. Feel is above medium with some faint but needed carb, LA keep it up. While I could not drink a ton of this, I enjoyed the 6oz's or so."
" Drinkability is excellent. I had it room temp and highly recommend it served that way."
"D- Fairly high- a joy to drink. Warming, boozy, and absolutely fantastic flavors. High marks here."
"this is honestly one of the best beers i have enjoyed this year...its like chocolate milk for adults..creamy rich heady sweet alcoholic deliciousness...port brewing does some amazing things with their the lost abbey collection and i cant get enough..keep em coming"
"375ml bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours one shade shy of black and completely opaque. Head is a quarter inch and mocha-colored and disperses almost immediately, forming a soapy skim across the surface and a thin band around the edges of the bowl. An arc of lacing is formed on the tilt side of the glass, with tiny raindrops of lacing cascading below. A big malty nose immediately reveals barrel aging reminiscent of Bourbon Angel's Share. A trace of booze follows, as well as brown sugar and perhaps licorice and a hint of vanilla. Taste consistent with nose; however, a pleasant buttery quality reveals itself as well as maple syrup - there's definitely some vanilla going on in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Some alcohol heat hits up front and gradually dissipates towards the finish. Carbonation is mild and balanced and evenly distributed from start to finish. This is a wonderful beer. I think I prefer Bourbon Angel's Share to Deliverance, but not by much. Quite a treat despite the $16.99 price tag. I think I'll definitely need to pick up another bottle to put a couple years on. I recommend picking this one up before it's gone."
"D- I really like this. I cant wait to see what it becomes after a while. I can only hope some alcohol calms down. That would help bump a few categories up a notch."
"In a word, smooth. Pours black bodied with a small thick head. Pleasant and roasty aromas. Tasty stoutish and also strong dark stuff, with bourbon in distant secondary, which is a good thing.Caramel and chocolate, fruit and a tangy edge aids above average mouthfeel."
"Not bad but certainly not my favorite Lost Abbey beer."
"This is a medium bodied offering with a modest amount of carbonation. Quite a decent sipper that comes across with a creamy smooth feel. This needs some time to mellow out a bit. All the enjoyable flavors and aromas are there to make this super enjoyable right now, but a little bit of mellowing out and melding will do wonders for this brew."
"Got this beer as an AWESOME extra from johndoe8. Thanks Rich! This is my Christmas Day beer and man its tasty. Pretty black with deep mahagony highlights and a really thin tan ring. Even with a hard, hard pour not much head was apparent. Aroma is of vanilla, raisins, and assorted dried fruit. Brandy is more clear to me then bourbon, but I get both. It even smells a bit like booze. The flavor follows much from the nose. Lots of dried fruit flavors, vanilla, brandy and bourbon. Some less strong flavors of roasted malts and chocolate are clear but secondary. However they do add a nice complexity to the beer. Slick mouthfeel, low carb, expected and appropriate. Easy to drink, though clearly strong."
"Good beer, tastes like a much sweeter version of Bourbon County Stout."
"And the price..."
"Overall this is awesome, can't speak highly enough of this ."
"D - good? yes. great? eh, maybe. worth the price? depends where you get it. a local store has this exact bottle for $37. outrageous. that aside, it goes down fairly easy for its high ABV, and has enough solid flavors to keep it interesting."
"Overall, this is really good and I'm surprised. I think this needed some time because I ad this when it first came out and I wasn't as nearly as impressed."
" The flavor is a dark chocolate and caramel concentrated blend of malt and sweet woody notes. The vanilla of the bourbon and fruit of the brandy seem to add depth w/ a big shot of alcohol in the flavor too which honestly I am not that fond of. The malt is tenacious though with molasses toffee nuttiness and dark brown sugar sweetness and for that I give it kudos, the juxtopostion of barrel blending seems slightly disjointed, perhaps it is too young for my taste, I am not sure. The drinkability is good -all in all it balances out -very high quality brew that I don't think I could enjoy too many of."
"D: Hard to be excited about this one given the carbonation issues and the odd aromas. It is tasty but until they fix their carbonation issues I won't be recommending their beers."
"Overall, good beer, but not great. In comparison to the other beers we had that day, it seemed fairly middle of the road. I'd get this beer on tap, but not sure buying a bottle was a wise decision. Oh well"
"Poured into a tulip. Damn near black body on this thick oily looking brew with shimmers of brown barely penetrating through the light. A respectable dark mocha colored head sits atop this one. At about an inch thick I'm down right impressed with the high gravity of this beer. After about ten minutes of staring at it I'm still left with a nice layer of creamy foam on top of a big dark body. The aroma is nothing short of fantastic. Rich aromas of molasses, dark chocolate, raisins, and bourbon. The bourbon is integrated into this beer nicely, it gives nice rich caramel/bourbon kick to the nose with only leaving behind a little bit of heat. Damn near perfect aroma as far as I'm concerned. Richness through and through on this. Flavors of toffee and caramel. Chocolate, raisins and spot on bourbon coat the tongue being just slightly hot on the finish. The mouthfeel is full and silky with just a bit of heat. Simply a pleasure to put in my mouth. The biggest flaw on this one, and with big beers in general is they are hot a boozy. But that's not a concern with this one for me. I'm happy to nurse this one for another hour or so."
"D: More please. Surprisingly drinkable for a sipper."
"-Gfunk"
"I really like this and it's just outside of being a classic."
"D - Honestly pretty drinkable considering he ABV and what went into this beer. At this point I think the barrels provide nice flavors without giving a sickening alcohol taste. I'm a big fan of this and can't wait to see how this develops over time. While this one is a bit pricey I think it is worth trying for sure."
"Edit: Being in Idaho, I feel lucky to have a few bottles of this in the cellar, but I guarantee, I will not touch one until 2012."
"full-bodied mouthfeel with light carbonation. the quintessential sipper - one is most certainly enough per sitting (even if it wasn't so costly)."
"This beer reminds me of lot AS Brandy, with a bit of carbination. Not a bad thing."
"D: As my scores suggest, this is a good beer. Nothing too outrageous and honestly, a little too big for my liking but its very complex, with a nice mouthfeel and a decent nose. I'd definitely jump at the chance to have this again but would probably want to split a 375ml with another person. A sipper for sure, 6oz. is more than enough."
"Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, but finishes tingly, some alcohol warming, lingers powdery and slightly tannic. The considerable strength makes its presence known but does not overpower. Fairly drinkable for such a monster. Thanks to Barleywinefiend for sending this one coast to coast."
"D: Seems like there wasn't much of an attempt to hide the obvious alcohol content. Drinks pretty good, yet it was all we could do to share/finish this bottle."
"I REALLY want to like this more and it's especially tough when there was a LOT of things, flavor wise and especially in the nose, which I really appreciated about it. Unfortunately, that over the top alcohol presence of this bottle just killed things dead at certain points of me trying to enjoy it. I mean, I like to think that I can take some heat in a beer but I honestly had trouble finishing this whole bottle. I don't know. Other reviews didn't seem to mention the alcohol strength here having such an impact on the flavors. I've got another bottle. I'll lay it down for a while and revisit this later."
"J"
"This is an outstanding beer and if they would consistently nail this types of beers, I'd still be in the Sinner's Club. If they keep it up, maybe I'll jump back in..."
"Pretty drinkable in taste and feel, but I know it's stronger than it seems thanks to the warmth in my cheeks and chest."
"Overall- This is fantastic. It is expensive yes, but I do not regret the purchase at all, I got 3 more in the cellar. It is also properly carbonated and not ""hot", fresh. Looking forward to revisiting this again in a few months, if I can keep my hands off them!"
"D: ABV and very thick. Definitely a sipper."
"The beer is lightly carbonated, fitting for the strong flavors and thick mouthfeel of the beer. This one is definitely a sipper, as the alcohol is evident early and often, but it's expected and welcome. Glad I got to try this one, certainly wouldn't turn down another bottle if it came my way."
"In the end, setting all my gripes with Lost Abbey aside, I think this is a great beer when looked at on the larger scale, but when comparing it to other small, specialty crafted, barrel aged beers... it does not quite deliver on the same level as comparable ones."
"Deliverance is smooth yet sticky with a high carbonation for an ale this strong."
"The light carbonation does not hurt this beer whatsoever. It seems to fit this sipper perfectly. This one is super thick and viscous on the palate with a warming alcoholic aftereffect. The 12.5% is not as evident in the taste as it is in my flushed cheeks as I finish this glass. For as heavy as a beer this is the drinkability is superb. I enjoyed this one until the very last drop was gone."
"D: you certainly feel the alcohol but very tasty and a great blend."
"Drinkability is great. At 12.5% ABV this is a sipper, but a delicious one. Alcohol is warming, but does not get in the way of the flavor. An excellent after dinner drink to enjoy by the fire on a cold night. I think I enjoy this more than the regular Brandy Angel's Share, but I've never had the Bourbon Serpent's Stout, so I can't comment on that. The only downside to this beer is the price. At $17-$18 in MA I probably won't be buying too many of these. But I would still recommend trying a bottle, because it is a well crafted brew."
"Overall I could really appreciate this as an après-ski or after a long day of work by the fire in the wintertime. Very yummy."
"Overall a very nice barrel aged beer."
"Well, this is a very good beer, but there's an oomph missing that keeps it from reaching the panorama of really excellent brews. Light on the complexity, this one uses the barrels to carry it."
"Deep brown hue, bordering on black with a good sized beige head that leaves a healthy amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of brandy, alcohol, and roasted malt. The taste follows suit. The feel is medium to thick in body with a very strong alcohol presence, most notably brandy. This is a very tasty beer and definitely worthwhile. Great for sharing a few ways, as this is best in small doses."
"It pops, it pours..a loud brown, slight brown shade of head. This was poured to loud cheers, squawks, and scrambling. The decadence of the gods liquified upon descent to earth..Brandy and vanilla, oak, caramel, and toffee. Sweet burnt malts, candy for the fools among us. It demands your attention, draws you in with the lusty pleasures of the gods. But it is their whim, not yours. And so, your glass is now empty."
"Short poured from a 375 ml bottle into my Chimay goblet. a little bit of head (enough to know it's carbonated), and dark blackish brown body. The fruity Brandy barrel and Vanilla caramelish Bourbon barrel come through hugely on the nose, as do notes of chocolate and coffee. Some raisin/fig/prune stuff goin on as well. Bourbonbrandydeliciousness on the mouth. A lot of chocolate and Coffee Nip candy flavor. A rich espresso lingering finish. The flavor keeps changing in my mouth. I am in love. The mouth is nice and creamy and adequately carbonated. Drinks pretty well given it's 12 %. Only a few sips and I already feel warm."
"Medium to full body, well carbonated. Finish a bit thin. Another nice BA blend from Lost Abbey."
"Drinkability isn't the greatest, it's pretty boozy and thick and chewy, a bit of a sticky sweetness on the finish as well, but smooth and delicious. I think I'll get a couple bottles and leave them in the cellar for a while."
"Frankly, Deliverance is one of the best beers I've had from Lost Abbey in a few years, Isabelle not withstanding. This small bottle is perfect for splitting with a good buddy on a cold night, and I hope this gets made again."
"D: A well composed blend that will likely benefit from a cellared vacation."
"Really robust intense flavors here so if that is your thing go right ahead, but many might be turned off by the alcohol."
"Very tasty! Huge warmth from the mixture in the brandy and bourbon. Big chocolate/coffee notes. The full body comes in very, very sweet...with the booze warmth attacking the second it hits your lips. The beer finishes as delicious and sweet as it starts. This beer is excellent! Tomme continues to make some of the best barrel aged beers around. Just wish there was more of this produced...because I bet this beer will age with the best of them! Carbonation is low, but there...and doesn't hurt the beer one bit. Booze is high, and drinkability is surprisingly high for such a full body beer."
"Linger: 3"
"D - It's a small bottle as I said, but it is enough for me. I still wish it had been a .500 for the price and I could have shared it with a friend. Nice stuff."
"Not too drinkable, but a very enjoyable sipper. Love it."
"D - I should've let this one sit for a while, but it was my first and I always like trying one fresh before I age it. Angel's Share bourbon is one of my all time favorite brews and I guess I was kinda expecting Deliverance to be like it, but it's not quite on the same level. Definitely delicious, but the heat from this one is much more pronounced and a little unpleasant when compared to that of a fresh Angel's Share."
"D-There is a real arrogance in charging $20 for a 12oz bottle of this. Who do Lost Abbey think they're fooling? This beer is ridiculously overpriced, for how little complexity it has. Ultimately it's pretty good, but feels incomplete and underdone. This is why I rarely buy Tomme's limited releases."
"Delicious the whole way through, much more drinkable than my normal bourbon beers, really great beer for my first Lost Abbey tasting!"
"Drinkability:It's a good sipper, but it's got some harsh notes that will probably do well with some age on it."
"Search this one out if you like a rich and flavorful brew."
"Good carbonation, which is an unexpected treat in a Lost Abbey beer. Very well done all around. Now they just have to reduce their costs."
"Thanks to OtakuAle for the trade. Pours dark brown with plenty of carbonation. Smells a lot like Angels Share - loads of bourbon, vanilla, fruit, spice. Tastes quite good - bourbon, caramel, vanilla, fruit. A sweet malt bomb. Tons of alcohol is present in the flavor and it's really hot. About as conspicuous a burning hot alcohol beer as I can recall having had. That said, this is a nice sipper and is easily shared with a friend despite being only 375 ml. Body is on the thick side with medium carbonation appropriate for the style. Overall, I like this beer, but for the price and given the alcohol heat, one is enough for me."
"D: very, very good! Not sure I would pay the freight on this again but it was worth trying once for sure."
"Drinkability: I was glad I split this one with someone; glad it was only 375ml"
"The pours a deep blackness topped by a decent amount of tan foam. The nose comprises of most things heavy. There is some coffee, chocolate, whiskey, brandy, and oak along with various other sweet fruits that are hard to pick out amongst the myriad of aromas present. The flavor is wonderful. It tastes up front as if there is a very cherry-whiskey-syrupy flavor that is masked due to the smoothness of the beer. All of the sudden after you have finished with the mouthful, BAM! You are hit with the woody oak flavor that is quite unparalleled. It is a deep rich flavor, but a bit on the strong and boozy side. It's really a delicious beer and a heavy recommendation for anyone willing to shell out the cash required to purchase one of these bad boys."
"Grabbed this today at Berman's in Lexington. Very cool artwork of angels and demons fighting over somebody. The color is almost completely black, with just a small amount of lacing as far as the head goes. The nose is of molten chocolate cake, molasses, and naturally brandy and bourbon. Wow, the alcohol is very present in the taste, giving it the feel of a spirit. Very similar to the nose, but there are some underlying fruit notes that makes it all the more interesting. Despite the heat from the alcohol, the mouthfeel is not especially huge, more in the middle I would say. The carbonation is also kept in check well. Like enjoying a spirit neat or on the rocks, this is one to sip slowly, and let develop as it warms to room temperature. Although grossly overpriced, this is another quality brew from Lost Abbey. I would be interested in trying the Bourbon barrel aged Serpent Stout, which is one of the brews (along with Brandy Angel's Share) blended in here. Cheers"
"Glad to see this made a wider distribution than I originally had thought. It pours a deathly black topped by about three-quarters of a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises molasses, chocolate syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, oak, whiskey, vanilla, and maple syrup. The taste leads with all of those lovely dark notes, similarly to a rich imperial stout, but then a secondary wave of whiskey-infused oak criss-crosses the tongue, colliding with the original flavor inhabitants. It's quite an experience, and an altogether pleasant one, at that. The body is quite hefty, with a light carbonation and a syrupy, almost chewy feel. Honestly, if it were a bit thicker/heavier, this would have been perfect, I think. Overall, a very tasty cuvee, one that finally lives up to the usual Lost Abbey hype machine."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Not overly heavy and goes down smooth considering the high gravity here. Overall, this ranks up there as one of my favorite Lost Abbey releases...the melding of bourbon and brandy is quite nice."
"All in all, this is a good brew. Not great. I am kind of disappointed by LA by this one as I had higher hopes for it. Guess I set the bar a little too high. Great to try at least once if you like big beers, as I am a big beer lover, but don't expect to be floored by this one."
"Drinkability - A sipper for sure. I was at the bar for quite a while with just an 8oz pour, and it was somewhat of a chore to finish. I did go in at an odd time (2pm) to avoid the hustle and bustle so I could be sure I would be able to enjoy my beer without feeling pressured to finish it up quick and either order another or leave. It was a bit hot for me, and I could defiantly smell alcohol in the nose and taste it. I have two of these in my cellar right now and don't think I will revisit them for about a year, and have it as a night cap on a cold night. Overall, a very interesting beer and was glad I was able to try it now so I can see how it ages later."
"Chocolate caramel candy is again prevalent on the palate. Quite a bit of brash alcohol too, but I don't mind. Dark fruit appears mid-palate, and there's just enough tannic oak to balance the sweetness. The flavors lean toward Angel's Share, but there's a touch more chocolate, roast and dark fruit. It's great fresh, but it should be excellent in a few months when some of the harshness fades."
"What a treat! Too bad it's $14.99 for a 375 ml bottle. I guess I'll have to wait to find it on-tap to sample again."
"Beer is medium bodied and sweet with mild roast at the back. The liquor components in the mouth are there but it was much more obvious in the nose than the palate. Beer seems mildly hot. Drinkability is still quite good and I would recommend it and try it again, especially after a year."
"The beer pours stout black (given that Angel's Share was pretty dark in its own right and it was blended with a stout this isn't surprising), with about a finger of caramel colored head rising up. The foamy cap lingers for just a second before dissipating. Not bad for such a big beer, but nothing out of the ordinary either. The nose hints that this beer is going to be an absolute chocolate bomb (fine by me). Even more so than that though is the smell of bourbon, and just a hint of brandy. The nose is decent, but a little too alcohol dominant. I find more balance in Deliverance as I sip on it. The booze is definitely still there, but the rich, roasty chocolate really asserts itself here. Especially as the beer warms and mellows out a little bit the chocolate becomes the main attraction. It's also a pretty thick beer, and overall I'd say it reminds me of Goose Island BCS, just a rich, viscous, chocolate and bourbon milkshake (although with a splash of brandy this time around). I can't say Deliverance is flat, like my last Lost Abbey beer was, but it's only just barely carbonated. A beer this big and rich shouldn't have explosive carbonation, but it shouldn't be something I have to strain this hard to find either. Deliverance is surely a sipper, as while I emphasized the chocolate when discussing the flavor, alcohol is definitely present as well. It works out to the drinker's advantage though, as I find Deliverance to only improve as it warms up. Now, if Lost Abbey could just get these beers properly carbonated ;)"
"I've had nothing but bad luck with Lost Abbey's The Angel's Share (both bourbon and brandy aged) so this beer was both a relief and a revelation."
"d - Overall I thought this was a very good beer. I didn't like it quite as much as the AS Grand Cru, but it was much better than the AS Brandy and Bourbon barrel bottles I have had. I really thought the nose and taste were complex and balanced. I liked the nose a little more than the taste but both were great. Would love to try again."
"D: A must try for me, I liked it, but I'm glad I didn't pony up the $15 for the bottle, much cheaper on draft. It's good, but not that good."
"Poured into a new belgium snifter. Color is opaque black/very dark brown, with a thin mocha head that fades to the outer edge. Looks identical to Angel's Share, but with carbonation. Smell is bourbon off the bat followed by lots of brandy. No surprise there, but it is nice. Lots of alcohol heat and a tiny bit of chocolate. Taste is a great blend of the brandy and bourbon with a strong hot finish. Slightly bitter, lasting flavor is of milk chocolate. Mouthfeel is VERY light carbonation and a heavy, coating feel. For the style it is appropriate, but just barely fizzy. Drinkability is low for this one due to the abv - its very filling. The complex malt and barrel flavors keep me wanting more though."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a tan head. Small amounts of lacing, but certainly respectable for a beer of this heft. Smell brings a lot, with brandy, bourbon, roasted malt, alcohol, dark fruits, and candied sugars all playing a role. Taste is quite similar, although everything isn't quite as integrated in that respect, and the alcohol heat plays a bigger role, which degrades a bit from the mouthfeel. Drinkability is very nice, as this is quite complex. I think age will absolutely do wonders to this one."
"Overall this was one of the thinnest BA beers I've had in a while. The flavors were all there but just weren't substantial enough to stand up to the barrel influences. Still, it's worth a shot to see for yourself."
"In comparison makes Bourbon Angel's Share seem very one dimensional, Angel's Share is much sweeter"
"The beer is just. too. hot. If something is uber compex you can get away with this much heat ... sometimes, but this is a pretty one-note sweet/bourbon blast of a beer. I think a lot of the nuances are being blasted into Bolivia."
"Notes of vanilla, chocolate, smoke, caramel."
"one of the best beers i have had from lost abbey hands down. this is what i have been waiting for them to put out. amazing."
"Thanks to Ratman for sharing this one last night. It followed a few other barleywines, and blew them away. Poured a deep, rich mahogany color, shot through with red, with a good 1/2 inch of light brown foam. Huge aromas of brandy, red and black grapes, raisins and booze. On the palate, I get a little roastiness from the stout, oak, caramel, toffee and dark fruits. I didn't pick up any bourbon, but this one got hot as it warmed. An excellent beer; very grateful I got to try it."
"Drinkability? I'm glad this isn't in the 750ml format. The 375 will do the job nicely. ;^) Sip sippin away..."
"Overall this was a nice beer. The roastiness provided by the Serpent's Stout helped to balance the sweetness of the Angel's Share."
"An epic brew. I only get a touch of heat and alcohol, and mostly in the nose as the beer warms. It's 12.5% though, and I like to be reminded that what I'm drinking is strong. I'm sure a year or two of age will make this dangerously drinkable though."
"Finish is sweet, rich, thick carmel/toffee/plumed/cherry whiskey with espresso and black chocolate. Few ""end of dinner," ""dessert"" or ""sipping"" brews can match this one."
"I have a feeling this will be tremendous in 8-12 months. Right now, it's a little hot. Once this settles down and the boozy sweetness mellows, we could have a contender for best LA beer I've tried."
"Also, I see what ZX6Chris did there."
"D - This is balanced just right for being such a humongous beer. The full flavors and big bourbony booze flavors meld almost flawlessly into a superior blend. Yet it finishes clean(ish) and has me begging for more. This is a fantastic beer."
"Well done Lost Abbey."
"3.5 is my usual score for rich, thick beers that taste magnificent yet have dangerously high abv's. This, like Angel's Share bourbon and Speedway is the perfect dessert beer. Bravo."
"Overall, just the sort of beverage I enjoy. This is great right now, but I think the alcohol presence might be off-putting to some people, though I thoroughly enjoy its current strength. A great blended and -bal aged beer. I hope it becomes a yearly release."
"D: As I finish entering my notes I realize that I've probably already had about 12 ounces of this beer. Again, the pint was not entirely necessary for such a beer, but for less than the price of one of the 12 ounce bottles, I won't complain too much."
"Very, very good beer. Recommended."
"Deliverance has a full body and a complex, oxidized finish, placing it along the most refined dessert alcohols."
