4.32,1.9,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is an unfiltered, muddled, light brown coloring, with sparse trails of carbonation throughout the body, and no head to speak of. Aromas of super sweet toffee and caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, wood, roast, apple, date and fig, and a subtle spice blend of nutmeg and cinnamon. Wow...this is a layered trip for your nose. Flavors are rich and heavy forward, with a heavy dose of molasses, toffee, booze heat, woody character, candied apple, fig, and peat. Pretty decent blend of earth and rich sweetness. Smooth, creamy body that layers the flavors for you to uncover. Richly sweet, creamy, and heavily roasted aftertaste. Smooth, slightly cloying, lingering sweet finish.","GarthDanielson","Dec 20, 2014"

Aroma of honeycomb, molasses, maple syrup, some lemony soapy aroma. Flavor is big sweet toffee, figs, maple syrup, honey, bready, sweet brown sugar and molasses, oak, vanilla. Vanilla oak, tobacco, and maple on the finish, lingering dry on the palate. Light booze and warmth but the dryness of the oak keeps it in check. Heavy bodied but still with medium high carbonation that prickles the tongue. Huge complex flavors.

None-the-less I think I would prefer this fresh and in my taste Adam is definitely a better beer. This beer was interesting to try but I definitely wouldn't trade the cellar for it.","jaasen64","0"

There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

I enjoy Fred very much and it is a fantastic base beer to put into a barrel. Fred from the Wood is no doubt an improvement of regular Fred! It drinks fantastic fresh and will age gracefully. I highly recommend it! I think that this is almost as good as 2012 Bourbon Fred from the Wood(the properly carbonated batch). I think this beer would also fit into the style category of an oak aged old ale or a really, really big oak aged Wee heavy based on the look, smell, flavor profile, and mouthfeel of this beer.","4DAloveofSTOUT","May 31, 2013"

The oak aging has been done with tact and understanding of what flavors can be extracted and complimentary to the existing beer.

Taste is caramel and sugary sweet with an earthy herbal edge and a distinct bit of alcohol presence. I could sip on this thing all night long if only that damn bottle wasn't so small. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Wood aged, but I get very of that in the aroma or flavor. It's a damn fine barleywine just the same.

This offering pours a deep auburn color with a frothy bit of offwhite head. The aromatics are rather unique. I'm not sure what wood Fred is from, but it doesn't smell like oak, it smells more like pine to me. Some of the aromas and flavors, because at this point they were getting all muddled together was a more citrusy pineapple flavor with an accent of mint and finished off by some cinnamon and nutmeg. It was rather interesting. It went from a DIPA to a winter warmer just in letting it explore my palate. It was a rather pleasant beer to consume. The only problem being it was still, with 2 years on it, a little on the boozy side. I would almost be inclined to let it go for another year an see how it turns out.","Vdubb86","Apr 13, 2011"
4.05,-4.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"2008 vintage. I wanna see the version from the streets: Fred from the 'Hood. Flava Flav would play the lead. I'd see it. Anyway, this less ghetto-fabulous brew pours a lightly murky amber-russet topped by a half-finger of lightly dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises apricot, orange zest, caramel, and butterscotch. The taste does not choose to deviate from this path, though the orange peel flavor is stronger now, and a touch of the alcohol is now noticeable. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a syrupy, almost chewy feel. Overall, a very nice b-wine, one that the couple years seems to have helped (though, not having had it fresh, I don't have anything to compare it to) flourish. Good times.","TMoney2591","Apr 05, 2011"

4.1,-3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Review #100. 2008 12 oz bottle. Pours a glowing orange brown behind so light with basically no head. Left the last ounce or so in the bottle for the yeast to hang out in. A little thrashing of a straw gets a bit of head up and a big whiff reveals sugared raisins and candy almost. A bit of citrus as well. Smells like one of the sweetest beers I have smelled. Taste is very sweet and has a bit of that citrus element, along with a small amount of faded hops. Kind of tastes like someone dumped 1/2 oz of orange soda into a barleywine, not that I am complaining. There is just a twinge of that oak and tobacco flavor that the bottle eludes to - less so than I would expect, but it does add a nice contrast to the sweetness. It tastes good, but maybe not great. The mouthfeel is medium-heavy with little to no carbonation. A bit syrupy in the finish, the sweetness would completely envelop the tongue in the finish if there weren't that leathery-oaky-faded hops in the back. Very drinkable for everything I have described above. A few of the sips have been more like glugs, which is pretty surprising for a barleywine. It's that odd, interesting, awesome 1/2 oz. of orange soda that isn't really in the beer, but I swear I get. This is a good beer that wasn't quite as good as I was expecting. Could have been a touch less sweet with a bit more oak to tone it down a bit. That being said, it is very enjoyable casting aside expectations.","seeswo","Feb 22, 2011"

I'm wondering if we didn't just hit the HotD lottery. I have not had previous batches so I can't make comparisons but this batch seems perfect. Some reviews call this "to hot" and that it "needs more time in the bottle". I disagree and must say that for a young alcohol forward beer, on tap mind you, this was a real treat to enjoy. Part of being on BA for me is to find new interesting beers. To frequently I feel let down after anticipation of a transcendent beer experience falls through again. Homerism be damned! Today, I can honestly say I found my new favorite beer. I thoroughly look forward to something that will top this one day. Find this, obtain it, and drink it NOW!","hopsbreath","Aug 21, 2010"

Thick brown-orange creek mud inside the clear, strong effervescence visible, brighter zinc orange around the rims. Big, dewy nose bursting with caramel, molasses, honey, vanilla fudge and a big spoonful of orange marmalade, ginger and cinnamon spice, dates and maraschino cherries, there's something like a bitter rye edge more than grassiness, for all of its sweetness has excellent posture in your nostrils. Full-bodied, sappy clinginess adds to the weight. There's tang from the mandarin orange, pink grapefruit citrus but overmatched by the dark chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, molasses, honey and pine sap. A sip or two reminiscent of Cherry Coke. Well layered apricot, nectarine, guava, fig, date and golden raisin. Some orange pekoe tea leaf notes too. The carbonation isn't light per se but fluffy in texture and not changing the creaminess.

Bitter malt and biscuit flavors, malt is definitely contending with the hops on this one. I think there is a fair rye component to this beer.

The malt bill here is complex (it's been too long since I've had a Fred), with a blend of orange blossom honey, toffee, fruitcake, butterscotch, and a little maple. There isn't too much brown sugar here, and that keeps this beer well in enjoyable territory. The oak character has fallen off by quite a bit, if my memory serves me right. The tannins have been integrated into the flavor profile, tempering that big oak notes that this beer had, and this also enhances drinkability here. Sweet on the finish with a blend of honey, maple and butterscotch. The finish is also where the oak does linger, with a blend of tannins, vanilla, and very lightly (if that) toasted oak flavor. Initially highly carbonated (in quite an enjoyable way), once it falls off, this comes into its own, really awesome and enjoyable. Highly recommended. 4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5","DefenCorps","Nov 10, 2008"

First sip, darn this tastes good. It starts thick, malty and creamy caramel followed by a pile of dried out oak logs. Then the muted citrus hops show up and grow to an almost bitter note.

The flavor is very nice; initially I am struck by the agressive amount of bitter hops, the oak and wood flavors come in soon followed by a ton of sweet candied fruits. Some rich prune, plum and strawberry flavors. The flavor is well rounded by the barrel, almost a bit of bourbon in there. Some spices, especially orange peel also. Very good example of the style.

This is an oak bomb, but the hops are so prevalant that there is some sort of balance being struck here. This beer will probably improve a great deal after a year or two of aging, and I've got another laid down for that purpose. This one is probably six months old and I wanted to taste the hops while they were relatively fresh. After some time the flavors should mellow and integrate more. Still, as big as it is, I'm enjoying it now. Mouthfeel is rich and very tannic, and although I'm splitting this 12 oz bottle threee ways, that is enought for me for now.","Georgiabeer","May 06, 2008"

Woody and also slightly bitter hoppiness at the end. This does not taste like the Fred I had last year at all. This is very good but is a slow sipper due to the strength of the flavor.

The aroma was very interesting, it had a definite wine like character and the wood smell was defiantly a presence. Had a bit of a spiced note to it as well and also a bit of alcohol. The taste was very strong, with a lot of alcohol present in it. There was a very big presence of spice and oak barrel taste to it as well. A dry hop like finish tried to make itself known at the end, but never really got that far past the strong notes from the other flavors. Very nice medium to full body gave it a very sipper like quality. Overall this was pretty good, although I will admit not my favorite offering from them. This seemed like it needed to sit for a while and come back to it later. Just a little to young and the alcohol just a little too strong still.

The oak has really taken a turn for the better and is balancing nicely with the toffee malty buttered biscuit flavors. A thick earthy tobacco flavor shows through on the mid palate and finishes with a full palate of vanilla, hop bitterness, hints of maple, a floral grassy almost herbal note on the finish shows good RS for balance. Man the new American oak lends such a pleasing flavor to this beer and has a mellow silky thick mouthfeel with a bit of a spritzy burst on the finish. Finish is long and decadent. This is a beer I could easily drink all day regardless of alcohol which by the way is hidden completely.

Appearance is heartily viscous with some letting and with a thin foamstand that held firm. A rich chesnut color with a mild haze. Flavors pick up on a medium molassas sweetness with dates, figs, plumbs, raisins, prunes. A big hop balance brings citrus frutis (grapefruits and oranges), tropical fruits (pineapples and mangos), along with an earthy pine and lemon-grass flavor. The wood aging also brings out an earthy / peaty / musty flavor with some nuttiness and vineous-ness. The texture is full bodied, but smoothened out by the wood aging. Not quite chewey, but close.

It's truly amazing how well this beer ages. Carbonation is still pretty decent, at least for a beer more than 4 years old. On both the nose and palate, this beer has mellowed into a thing of beauty. There's chocolate, malt balls, caramel and butter scotch on the nose, with a hint of underlying skunkiness that only adds to the experience. The beer is fairly sweet on the palate, with butterscotch, vanilla, caramel, gingerbread, molasses and still some underlying hoppy bitterness. The sweetness comes on a bit strong, which is really the only problem I have with this beer now, but it's still absolutely delicious. Alcohol is a bit more noticeable in this beer then it was 3 or 4 years ago, but this still doesn't come across as a 10% abv. beer.

Nice sticky patches of lace were left when the head finally did decide to disappear. Big woody aroma, coconut, and alcohol. Maybe a bit of citrus as well, but mostly wood. Sweetness up front, a rich and robust caramel flavor. Very woody and warming. A hint of ripe fruit, and some citrusy hop flavor, with a fair amount of bitterness.

A very interesting and complex beer, I really enjoyed the characteristics that the raw, previously unused barrels provided.","hoppymeal","Aug 11, 2006"
3.92,-7.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"batch 64 - Pours a hazy amber color with a faint off white head. Light spotty lacing. Very light, fine carbonation bubbles. Aroma is sweet and very oaky. Strong oak and mild fruit flavor. Very nice. The oak dominates the aftertaste. Actually, it dominates the beer from start to finish. It (alcohol) warms the stomach a little. This beer should be awesome a year from now. Looking forward to a re-rate.","flyerduke","Jun 27, 2006"
3.65,-13.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Batch 64. This poured a hazy amber with a short cap of fine beige bubbles. Spotty lacing at the start and it showed decent retention. Oaky aroma with a nice combination of vanilla and citrus, sweet orange, and caramel. The flavour started off with sweet caramel, followed by strong woody vanilla and a solid bitter bite. Citrusy tangerine hops appear towards the end and it finishes with a slightly aggressive alcohol flavour and warmth. Bitterness lingers. Low carbonation, a bit heavy with a nearly syrupy texture. I found the flavours to be very distinct with a separation between where each element finished and the next began. I also found it just slightly harsh in the alcohol department, but it did mellow nicely as it warmed and more citrus was apparent. Overall, an interesting beer that I did end up enjoying. Thanks for sharing grub!","DrJay","Jun 20, 2006"

4.5,6.1,4,4,5,4,4.5,"The oak probably gets in the way of the drinkability of this beer, but it adds a whole other layer of complexity to this brew, that almost offsets the loss in drinkability. I really like that the hop notes are still quite pungent in this brew, while it does not compare to a fresh Fred, it again adds lots of much needed complexity to offset the, perhaps, dominant oak character. As the beer warms the flavor gains even more balance; that fresh Fred hop character steps up a bit and helps to balance out the oak notes even more. While this beer has always been quite good during this journey through my 12oz bottle, this beer is only getting better as it warms up and as it slowly disappears from my glass.","Gueuzedude","May 13, 2006"
4.55,7.3,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a murky light brown color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a bit of caramel malt with a sweetness and large essence of wood and alcohol. The flavor starts out with a caramel malt sweetness, but is quickly followed by intense barrel flavors - vanilla, and wood and an almost bourbon character. There are some hops that show themselves in the flavor, but the wood character is the main show. The body is thick enough and the drinkability is pretty good. One of the best I've had from HOTD.","clvand0","Oct 05, 2005"
