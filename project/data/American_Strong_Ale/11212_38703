4,4.2,,,,,,"Along with Mac and Jacks African Amber ale and Georgetown's Manny's Pale ale, this is probably one of Washingtons staples of craft-beer. You walk into a joint and ask for an Irish Death and everyone will know exactly what you are talking about. There's a reason for this; It is a fantastic ale. It is a beautiful beer. Inviting, dark appearance, but on the lighter end of medium body, goes in and down super smooth and has an excellent taste of nut, caramel, malts and balanced well with comforting hop flavor. Though maybe not an out-of-this-world, knock-you-off-your-feet beer in the vein of strong ales, nevertheless it is an always reliable, always enjoyable brew.","RenzoD","Nov 27, 2014"

3.94,2.6,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with very little light transmission and a half finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, hints of coffee and vanilla. Flavor starts similar to the aroma, with toasted malt, chocolate and nuts with a lighter fruit element quickly developing to finish with dark malt, light cherry and berry juice, chocolate and a light tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with bright carbonation. A beefed up brown ale with an interesting flavor progression from almost a nut brown into a lighter slightly tart brown. The ABV is well covered, probably explaining the demise of the quilter. Interesting and I'm long overdue reviewing this local classic.","LiquidAmber","May 20, 2014"

My first sip tasted distinctly like green olives, that put me off a bit. Fortunately the flavor changed and I was able to savor the sweetness of the bready malts balancing the high ABV. Still it's a thin ale with a watery back end. I guess you would classify this as a malty porter, where as porters are normally hopped, but definitely not a stout.","Kevin73","Dec 23, 2012"

It goes flat worse than a warm diet Coke - unless you get and drink this from the tap at BevMo and slam down two pints pronto, you're looking at a fizzless beer. The sweetness might be from the yeast getting tired of producing huge amounts of alcohol and dying off from their byproduct, yielding an approachable brew, but I like the bubbles coalescing from my tongue. What happened? Don't buy a 22 bottle and go on a road trip from Portland to Seattle, head and lacing will vanish in seconds.

The taste is pretty sweet, just as the nose suggests, with lots of vanilla and caramel paired with dark fruits. The sweetness is strong but never becomes cloying.

3.55,-7.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"billed as a ""stout"" incorrectly by the bar i was at, it was instead a strong dark ale. hides its ABV deceptively well, very drinkable, but very forgettable. VERY sweet through a cherry/plum/raisin-y note. where its ABV is hidden by the lack of heat, perhaps it comes out in this sweetness. the sweetness, however, was not accompanied by a thick or syrupy mouthfeel - it was rather thin.","Franch","May 09, 2011"
4.02,4.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"- This is a great brew. If you are looking for a perfectly drinkable creamy smooth dark ale.. this is it. This would be gold on nitro I am guessing.","Docer","Apr 01, 2011"

3.53,-8.1,3,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall I say this is a good beer that is quite unique and well worth trying, it is an enjoyable drink and at 7.8% it will put you in a good place. So if you are in Ellensburg it is worth getting a bottle.","beerandcycling88","Jan 30, 2011"
4.45,15.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This is the best brown ale I have ever drank. Superb flavor and drinkability. The beer has a wonderful almost chocalately sweet smoothness. I had it out the bottle for the first time last night and it was almost as good as it is on tap. Pricey, but well worth it.","Liberaldrinker","Jan 15, 2011"
3.53,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Full pour, minimal head and significant lacing. Medium brown almost opaque darkness, no visible carbonation. Tan head what there is, significant lacing. Nose is faint milk chocolate and even more faint floral hops. Taste is on the sweet side, chocolate is more prominent than nose, floral hops are well hidden on back end, a bit of roast not coffee, more carafan-ish than roast, hops subsumed by big malt mill. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, medium effervescence. Drinkability above average, served too damn cold despite room temperature glass. Overall not that great, lacking in hop and roast character.","jdense","Dec 24, 2010"
3.33,-13.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3,"A pretty messy beer. I would hardly call it a double stout, more like a big Irish stout. A lot of alcohol is present which really distracts some of the other aromas and flavors. Not a fan.","bum732","Dec 09, 2010"
3.41,-11.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Aroma had a little bit of peat to it, as if a red or brown. Taste, very smooth, hid the alcohol well, toffee malt feel for it. I liked it, drank this with over a year of age on it, nice and rich. Advertised as smooth, and I would agree. This one went great with enchiladas, covered up the spiciness well.","Beerandraiderfan","Nov 29, 2010"
3.65,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability is fine; I've enjoyed it. This doesn't at all seem like an imperial stout to me; maybe more of a Scottish ale or some such. Regardless, it's pretty solid. Rating doesn't reflect imperial stout as the style.","Ryan011235","Nov 08, 2010"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall a great beer though it is not an imperial stout. Worth seeking out.","chumba526","Sep 30, 2010"
4.53,18,4,3.5,5,4.5,5,"D - I would rate this sky high given how great it tastes, and the fact that I would have never guessed this to be nearly 8%. Drinks like 5% and I downed it pretty fast. A go-to stout.","blackc5","Sep 21, 2010"

3.92,2.1,3,3.5,4,5,4,"D: I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree with the style on this one...this is more like a double Irish red or something. This is a great beer...was a little bit hesitant to get it cause I don't really like imperial stouts..its very far from that, a very tasty brew.","loren01","Mar 01, 2010"
3.93,2.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This one is very intersting. It is described on the bottle as a dark ale and I would be inclined to agree. I'll not say I'm a big fan of the feel on this one but the taste and drinkability are high. It's so easy drinking it almost seems wrong to be associated with death. If only death would go down this easy!","Bfarr","Feb 06, 2010"
4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a deep red color with lots of brown gues and a small white head. Nose is dry with rich fruits, candy sugar and chocolate and perhaps some peat.

3.78,-1.6,4,3.5,4,3,4,"I have described this beer as an American Guinness before; it's similar in look and taste, but MORE, especially in the taste area. It's rich and malty, with an herbal tinge and a touch of bright hoppiness. The mouthfeel is pretty average for this style, kinda chewy and sticky. Drinkablility is like tap Guinness, in that you can't really chug it but it leaves you wanting your next sip. This beer works great with a burger at the Palace here in Ellensburg, and I'm sure others as well.","thinkfull","Oct 31, 2009"

3.48,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: Tempting to have more, once the palate gets used to the malty sweetness. The need to categorize this beer leads me to disagree with the 'Double/Imperial Stout' that the first reviewer settled upon...Strong Ale (a catch-all term if ever there was one...) could work...were there a little more peat/smoke I could be swayed toward 'Wee Heavy' (and what with a name like 'Irish Death' perhaps a sideward glance at the Scots?). Heck, my wife even thought it 'tasted' like a quad', but much thinner. Suffice to say, this beer won't appeal to the hop-lovers, but it's one of the more intriguing and -yes- style-defying beers I've had in a while. I liked it well enough and give it a nod for a try - not quite the ringing endorsement, but so be it.","msubulldog25","May 17, 2009"
4.18,8.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The flavor was rich, and had a nice taste. The texture was nice, not too thin, had a richness to it, like you would expect from a good stout. The taste rolled nicely on the tongue.","sensorglitch","Apr 24, 2009"
3.56,-7.3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours black with a large tan head and fair amount of sticky lacings. Aroma is fine just not very robust. Taste is sweet, dark, with a fair hop load. Never would have guessed this was an Impy Stout. Tastes more like a strong ale. Decent drink and the alcohol is well hidden.","Spikester","Apr 05, 2009"
1.69,-56,2,3,1,2.5,1,"Drinkability not good. Drain pour, for both myself & the wife. Too bad.","maximum12","Mar 29, 2009"
2.55,-33.6,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Taste is um... interesting. Very sharp, stabbing sweetness quickly followed by a medicinal tang. No deeper notes in the aftertaste. Mouth feel is quite thin. Not what I'd call a stout, exactly (I expect a heavier mouth feel and more body to the taste).","LieutenantWort","Feb 05, 2009"
3.01,-21.6,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Drinkable for a taste and mouthfeel perspective, but a little high on ABV to be sessionable. Still a couple are nice.","RJLarse","Jan 19, 2009"
2.06,-46.4,3,2,2,2,2,"Again, this is certainly not a stout by any measure, and I don't just mean in termsof quality. I'm not sure where the style label came from.","waldowin","Jan 09, 2009"
3.47,-9.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was certain this beer was not a Double Stout as soon as I sipped it, really seems more like a Scotch Ale, or Baltic Porter, no real characteristics that stick out to categorize it as any American Double Stout that I am familiar with. Very roasted, almost burn malt flavors mix with a complex interplay of mildly estery yeasts and alcohol. Finish leaves a slightly grainy taste i the mouth and is not smooth at all, softly carbonated in the start and dry and loose in the finish. Not as bad as I am sort of building this beer up to be, as I like that this beer is not an over-hopped monster and does not rely on gimmicks like coffee and chocolate to present itself. A pretty good malt centric beer that I feel suffers in being considered a Double Stout. Worth a shot for malt fans.","bluemoonswoon","Dec 21, 2008"
3.5,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a dark brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roastiness, earthy, chocolate, and some nuttiness. Tastes of roastiness, earthy, chocolate, caramel, and toasty. This one was roasty all the way around.","hopdog","Oct 11, 2008"

3.6,-6.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Anyway, the beer is very sweet, with some cherry flavor coming out. Not hoppy at all. Too sweet and sticky in the mouth for me.","snaotheus","Aug 21, 2008"

4.37,13.8,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Appearance is dark like coffee with light head and lace. Smell has the aroma of rich dark fruits and molasses.

4.25,10.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Enjoyable, I liked this because it was not on the sweet side. Seemed more like a porter than a dark ale.","tbeck","Jul 17, 2008"
3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste is big and rich. Hello? Hops? Where are you? Some rich overripe fruit, and bam, lots of chocolate and sugary goodness.
