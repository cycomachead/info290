"What an icredible brew! I need more!"
""
"Like every HotD beer, this is burly as hell. Sweet but complex and quite the sipper. Well played. For a catch-all style, this is hard to beat."

"Pour is a murky pale brown with no head. Nose is strong bourbon and wood with a good bit of caramel and some hints of dark fig and fruits. Nose is more sweet, less bourbon. Caramel and lots of toffee, a bit of slightly charred wood and notes of bourbon. Flavors are a bit more muted than the nose. Full bodied, sticky and chewy, with virtually no carbonation and a soft clean finish."

"O: Dont smell it. Taste it and you'll be happy."
"O: This is deep and interesting and complex, but is not very good. I would give it another try, but as is it's awfully disappointing."

""

"O- overall, a very nice beer. A boozy sipper by the fire"

"O - Overall, still quite good, but perhaps the weakest of the Fred variations. A case where barrel aging doesn't help the beer and perhaps takes away some of its finest nuances. The original Fred was the top of my list tasting these in succession. Tasting separately or between/behind/in front of other beers...who knows - may change the impression, but Fred - FftW, BFftW progression took a bit away each time (and I don't believe it to be from reduced coherency despite the 10%, 10%, 12% strengths of these beers. Regular Fred was supremely balanced and this almost by default had to diminish from there. All are great beers, but this BFftW is the least balanced and least flawless/most flawed of the bunch. Worthy of a sample for sure, but the original Fred, for me, is the way to go in the future...rarity doesn't pay off in this series."

"O- As always an amazing beer from HotD!! They are one of my favorites and although this beer is flat I feel that's the least of my concerns, when it taste this good!!!"
"Pretty one-dimensional and abrasive fresh, however delicious - interested to see how it ages. Also - the sweet maple syrup component is interested given no additive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an enjoyable sipper that was fine for a cold winters evening, but it was almost too sweet. The hint of whiskey kept it somewhat balanced from the sweetness. this would be good to split with someone. would like to revisit it again when it's properly carbonated."

"Overall this is just another example of an extremely complex beer from HotD. I can imagine there being a lot of differing opinions about this one."
"this is not up to the level that you would think"

"Overall. Very nice despite lack of carbonation. Thanks again Phil!"

"O: amazing that the flavors and their delivery did not suffer from the lack of carbonation. Does not taste like 12% at all. Excellent beer, but I'd love to try a carbonated version."
""
"Overall: Would have looked if it had conserved it's carbonation but overall the flavor makes up for it."

"O- If this beer were actually carbonated it would be fantastic, even without the carbonation it is still a great beer with nice complexity, a very good drink-ability, and fantastic nose. While this beer isn't over-poweringly sweet or cloying, it should be recommended as a dessert beer. Even being flat I would recommend anyone who loves sweet, complex beers to try this out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2011 darker blond/orange with almost no head, very undercarbonated. Smell is strong bourbon oak and vanilla, fruit and spice. Taste is vanilla, smooth and fruity, some booze, pretty mellow. Overall, ok."
""
""
""
"O-Some carbonation would do this beer wonders, still good, but a batch without carbonation issues would be amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Wow, what a treat! Enjoyed the hell out of this beer and looking to age at least 2 of these bottles for at least a year. Recommend this guy. Try if you can."

"O - This is one of the most bourbon barrel forward beers I've ever had. The base Fred is completely lost and was taken over by the barrel. Thankfully, I enjoy the strong barrel presence. This is a beer to pour when you only plan on having 1 and have time to enjoy it."

"Very good !!"
""
""
"D - A bit of spritz would help make this more drinkable. If you like drinking bourbon, then you'll dig this, but it's somewhat heavy-handed. Age will blunt the alcohol a bit, but I don't anticipate this carbonating any time soon. I like spirits, so this was nice in small doses."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Disappointing really. The regular Fred is such a fantastic beer, and the barrel aging here didn't really help it out. Besides the fact that this bottle was completely flat, the bourbon barrel aging is too dominant, basically whiping the base beer off the planet. More nuanced barrel aging would allow the beauty that is Fred play a roll in the flavor profile a little more, and some carbonation would help the whole experience further. Glad to have tried this, and I'll wait and hope future batches turn out better."

"M - Medium body with some chew. Light carbonation."
""
""
"Prying the cap off gave a tiny hiss, indicative of the practically non-existent carbonation I expected. Poured into a HotD stemmed taster, a murky burnt orange color, with no head, and extremely low carbonation, with the tiniest of collars around the rim of the glass, which left microscopic strands of lacing. An interesting aroma, raisins, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, dried orange peel. A lot going on in the taste as well, but largely reflected the aroma: chewy caramel and brown sugar, raisin, heavily oaked bourbon still apparent even after years of mellowing, vanilla and dried citrus zest, with a candy-like sweetness. I'd imagine this was much boozier fresh, but the bourbon and overall higher ABV was pretty well-integrated at this point. Body was closing in on full, mouthfeel was slick, but the practically lifeless carb sort of detracted from the mouthfeel. I always know HotD brews are going to be low carb, but I still always wish there was just a bit more in there to liven up the mouthfeel. Still a good brew overall, but with a complexity in the flavor that might come off as messy to some."
"O: Surprisingly sweet maltbomb with great bourbon taste and assuming the time it had to mellow contributed to the lack of alcohol heat."

"O - Solid beer with lots of flavor. It was definitely thick and flat. This is definitely a big, bready and malty beer that is loaded with bourbon sweetness. Worth tracking down"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unexpectedly undesireable. I can only sense what could have been."
""
""
""
""
"D - Even though it needs more bubbles, this is a decent offering. The flavor is balanced enough and feels smooth enough to work even without the carbonation. Would definitely revisit, which is good because I've got another bottle."
"O-a treat to drink, would love to try this again. Very different than most barrel agreed beers I have tried before but then again hair of the dog is just very different."
""
""
""
""
"well that caught me off guard. I guess in the bourbon fred i was kind of picking up the barrel but describing it as a sweetness and the cherry. I'm amazed at the difference in carbonation as well. Hell of a pairing and I'm thrilled at the opportunity to try a Bourbon Fred. Didn't plan on that one happening. Thanks quirkzoo for hitting another want of mine. Pretty damn awesome."
"I really liked this"
""
"Overall: I don't mind uncarbed beers at all, particularly when they are done this well. Better than the sum of its parts."
""
""
"M: Full bodied but the carbonation keeps this drinkable until the end. A stunning sipper."
"D - Very drinkable. The lack of carbonation hurts it a bit, but the barrel flavor blends so nicely with the base beer that it is still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I guess it helps that I like flat beers, but I thought that this was an absolutely fantastic American strong ale and I will most certainly be trying to get some more bottles of it in the future."
"Thanks Jeff for helping me to recover and giving me the chance to try this. EPIC."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with almost no head and no lacing – pretty much flat. Aroma of Kentucky bourbon with some vanilla is pretty powerful with distinct alcohol ester and loads of brown sugar notes. Taste is an unbalanced mix between strong notes of bourbon with some loads of brown sugar notes and some light vanilla. Body is full with almost no carbonation and loads of alcohol ester is discernable. Too boozy and too sweet for my taste – probably the type of beer that could be split four ways for a 12oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Could be so much more. I would love to try a 2012 bottle of this. Warming and delicious., but just a touch too sweet and too flat to be great."
""
""
""
"All in all a fine beer despite the obvious lack, I hope another year or two will allow some slow-mo carbonation to occur, but it seems unlikely. Still a beer I am quite happy to enjoy."
""
"O: I think I'm going to save the rest of mine for winter and make sure to open them when I have guests, as even a 12oz is too much sweetness for me for one sitting. Unlike many HotD beers, this one is so smooth that I see little reason to age it. In fact, with the hops being the only thing keeping the sweetness in check, I dare say this will be better fresh than with age."
""
""
""
"Awesome beer. Don't let the initial mediocre reviews throw you, the 2012 version is great."
""
""
"Still love the beer though and eagerly waiting for the 2014."
"I had a taste of last years version a couple times and thought it was decent despite the carb issues. With that problem solved, this is a wonderful beer - complex with the barrel integration done perfectly. Kudos Alan."
"The bottle opens with barely a pfft and pours a murky deep brown color, zero head and just a smattering of bubbles. For fucks sake brewers if you are going to release a premium product for a premium price QC the fucking beer before you release it. Smells heavy of sweet bourbon and oak with lots of sugary caramel and toffee malt sweetness. The flavor is sweet sugary malt with lots of caramel, brown sugar, dark sweet fruits, oak vanilla, and bourbon. Thick body with a sweet sickly syrupy mouthfeel, and a non existent level of carbonation. Smells great, tastes ok, the mouthfeel is shot from the lack of carbonation. I didn't give Flat Abbey any slack and I'm not giving this one any either. This could be a great beer, I guess I'll never know."
""
"Edit from 7/29/12. Had this beer again at the Wildwood HOTD dinner event, and the version there was much better. I suspect the wait staff opened the beer some time in advance, giving the beer a chance to open up. Also, the version at Wildwood wasn't nearly as cold as the bottle I enjoyed at the tasting room, and I think that helped as well. Just something to keep in mind..."
""
"O: Really good flavor but disappointing carbonation. HotD bottle variation strikes again."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden color with a small off-white head. Intense bourbon and booze aromas come through immediately. A hint of caramel and butterscotch with vanilla and oak being strong contributors as well. Intensely sweet on both the nose and palate. Lots of sweet caramel, vanilla, and whiskey notes on the tongue. Decently woody, but not quite as much as regular Fred from the Wood. Perhaps a hint of maple syrup on the finish. A hint of carbonation would have improved this already good beer."
""
"(Note: I gave the original 2011 vintage a mediocre score as a 'had'. This is an incredible improvement over its brother.)"
""
"O: Unlike a lot of reviewers I don't think the lack of carbonation totally ruins this beer. Obviously would be better with it, but it's certainly still enjoyable, especially considering the stellar barrel character."
"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit. While the bourbon is very up front in the nose, it isn't as much in the taste and isn't too hot, which is good. I'd put this on par with the normal Fred we had, though it was split who liked which one better. We all agreed FftW was the best of the three. Still, would like to have it again."
"Overall, yes, it's completely flat but still tastes and smells delicious. Super sweet like a dessert wine, rich and moderately complex."
"A very tasty beer, this Bourbon Fred. Good balance of the barrels and the barleywine. It’s a little sweet, but that’s just fine with me. A little more carbonation would make this one epic."
""
"Probably my least favorite Hair of the Dog offering yet, and price per ounce, this is one of the worst beers I've ever purchased."
"Big thanks goes out to dprouty for sending me this one along with a Hair of the Dog tulip in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Hair of the Dog tulip (proper!). Poured a murky red orange with an extremely minimal (almost none existent) off-white head. There was no lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, candi sugar, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, candi sugar, vanilla, sweet alcohol, wood, and sweet candy. It had a medium feel on the palate with very little carbonation (made it feel much thicker). Overall this was a fairly good brew. This one really didn’t show its true ABV due to all the sweetness going on, but you could definitely tell this one was a heavy-hitter. The lack of carbonation really hurt this one in my opinion as it made it VERY thick feeling and not a huge treat for the palate compared to the other components going on here. Glad I finally got to try this one, but doubt I will seek it out again."
""

"On tap at the Brew Pub. 2008 Vintage. Pous a dark mahogany color with virtually no head. Aroma is uber boozey. Bourbon dominates with maybe some malts and earth, but its hard to pick up on anything other than the booze. I do note some vanilla from the wood though. Taste is very boozey with some sweetness and vanilla at the end. A bit earthy. Bourbon finish. This is one hot beer but its not overly hot. Medium bodied. Overall, this is really boozey but it is called Bourbon Fred so its not much of a shock. Overall, glad i tried it and although I wouldnt have it all the time, its pretty solid."
"Received this beer as an extra along with the Adam from the Wood. Was really looking forward to trying this one out. Poured from 12oz bottle (2011 vintage) into snifter glass. Pours murky cooper with a small head. Aroma of light fruit, oak, bourbon, sugar and raisins. Flavor is sweet malt, boozy tanic oak and vanilla with a light hop bitterness. Medium to full body with mild carbonation and a thick, sugary mouthfeel. This beer was not pleasant at all for me as there was some overpowering unpleasant taste somewhere in the middle that almost made this beer a drain pour for me. I am actually surprised that the regular Fred easily blows this bigger brother version out of the water."
""
"This beer pours a light bodied caramel syrup, dirty dark amber with only an ever so slight, light watery head. The nose is superb. It's full of smooth bourbon, sweet toffee and caramel, with a lot of oak, a lot of wood! The flavors are nice as well. There is a lot of oak and spice. I'm surprised that those lead off. There is smooth bourbon, malty spice, toffee, caramel, silky fudge, a lot of oak and what I perceive as a touch of cherry. It's very interesting. The lack of carbonation actually doesn't body this beer much at all. The beer still coats your mouth with silky caramel. Overall this beer is really, really interesting. I like it a lot. It has a unique twang to it, making it almost unrecognizable of compared to the regular."
"Overall....it tasted ok, not trading for this one again."
"O - I'm not sure if I can truly say that the lack of carbonation hurts this beer. I don't think it does. The flavors are great, the mouthfeel is somehow appropriate. The aroma lacks a little bit, although potent. I'll happily take more of this."
"O: Maybe not as great as I was hoping, but pretty good and I am glad I got to try it. The flavors play quite well together. Half way through, I did throw in a splash of (well-carbonated) Fred for bubbles. I thought it was better. It really brought out the subtle fruits and played off the bourbon very well."
"O: A very enjoyable beer. I wish there was some more carbonation to help break up the body/sweetness of the beer. The lack of carbonation isn't such a glaring flaw as it can be in other beers, but it still detracts from the beer. Regardless, very enjoyable and glad to try it!"
""
""
"Overall, it was a good beer but wasn't a great beer in my opinion. The no carbonation aspect hurt it a lot and made it feel almost like a bourbon cocktail and not a beer. The bourbon flavors were very good, but that seemed like all it had going for it."
"In the way the barrel character is expressed, it reminds me of older batches of Angel's Share, despite the fact that they're very different beers. Truly fantastic stuff, I'd love to revisit this every few months. Refined and harmonious in a way that very few beers are these days. Very, very highly recommended, this is one of the few beers in recent memory that had me swearing in delight. For this reason and no other, this beer earns the 5/5 I gave it overall."
""
""
"This was a let down. I think this beer has a lot of potential but the lack of carbonation and the awful smell isn't helping. The flavor is complex and the sweet toffee makes for a nice night cap."
"overall: good stuff, went back the next day for another hit"
""
"O: Nothing left to say. Sucked."
"Difficult for me to judge this one, but it couldn't hold the jock strap of Adam from the Wood. Heavy, tastes off, I just can't imagine this one getting any better with an early dose of oxidation, either. Not a good beer, one of my biggest letdowns to date. I'm not going to be able to finish the bottle, this is truly deserving of a failing grade."
"Overall: Not nearly as complex or tasty as I had hoped or expected."
""
""
""
"O: Carbonation would work wonders for this. Otherwise, this is a so-so slow sipper."
""
""
"Poured the 12oz bottle into my DFH snifter and for a second I thought I had a glass of unfiltered apple cider. The aroma was mellow with bourbon upfront and hints of oak and raisin. The taste was good but it immediately felt off with the lack of carbonation. After taking a mental adjustment and taking it for what it is I enjoyed the beer. Bourbon and oak dominate with the flavor upfront with a nice mellow lingering flavor of dark dried fruits. Overall I am glad that I got to try it but be warned about the lack of carbonation."
"O: It's decent, but not amazing, and I can't see where it is going to get better."
""
"Bottle to snifter. Looks decent; typical of a strong ale, only a bit lighter. Smells good; woody, bourbony, and malty. Tastes very good; just different. Like a BB quad meets a BB strong. Mouthfeel is good too, just different. Overall, a good brew worth trading for if it's available."
""
""
""
"O - I had a Fred the night before to remind myself of it, but this felt like a different beer. I enjoy the barrel aging of HotD, and appreciate that they take their time with it. But this one could have used a little more carbonation. But that's really my big knock on this one. The bourbon was at a low level but well integrated into the flavor, and the oak was nice and full which gets lost with beers not aged in barrels as long. For what this is, a nice beer."
"O: A well made ale that I'm certainly glad to have tried. However, it's a bit sweet for me. I would recommend it but feel like the sweetness is overpowering and the balance isn't where it could be. It seems close to a barley wine to me. It's amazing that the alcohol is so well covered. This could be a dangerous beer because of that."
"Interesting, but I don't think I'll be trying to snag any next time around."
""
""
"Overall Score-3.48"
""
"As I said earlier, another great example of expert barrel aging while still being balanced, complex, and well integrated together."
"Overall:"
""
"Another HoTD failure. At least it was announced ahead of time. Equivalent of around 30 bucks for a four pack of this. BAs are suckers sometimes, aren't we?"
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle thanks to dsgolovin, appreciate it. Like most people have noted this is completely flat and the beer really suffered as a result. Dark murky orange color. Aroma of bourbon, oranges, strange yet interesting. Tasted like vanilla and oranges, booze, not bad but the lack of carbonation made it seem like juice with booze in it. Overall, disappointing."
""
""
"Overall, this is good but not great."
"Pours a completely flat reddish-brown. Smell is awesome - fantastic mix of oak and bourbon with hints of booze and raisins. Taste is a very nice sweet bourbon flavor with raisins factoring in as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied but completely flat. Overall, this is a great smelling, very nice tasting beer, but it suffers from its lack of carbonation. I liked it, but I'd take regular Fred over it any day."
""
""
""
"Taste is very alcoholic and Bourbon, boost and sharp with a super malty and bourbon finish. But its so flat its really hard to enjoy."
"excellent beer, in spite of the carb issue, glad i've got some to lay down and age."
"Picked up this bottle last week at Hi Times. Pours pond water flat. Like a juice. Very disappointing to see this is devoid of any carbonation. The label should have provided a warning. Smell is dominated by oxidation. Behind that are layers of bourbon, vanilla and brown sugar. But the nose is really dominated by the smell of a beer that has not aged well in spite of this being a new release. Taste is slightly more balanced but this beer still tastes like a horribly aged, improperly cellared brew. Again, notes of bourbon, brown sugar and vanilla are present as well. Body is fairly thick and entirely uncarbonated. Overall this is an extremely disappointing beer. Regular Fred and FFTW are so much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Again, I wish this beer had carbonation. I feel like it would then have been more enjoyable. Overall I thought it was okay, and it grew on me as I continued to drink it, however, the 4oz I had were enough."
"Beer is light to medium in body and really sweet, very bourbony, very strong, alcohol cuts through immediately, leaving a dryness on the palate, strong throughout. A decent beer but as stated before this is like Fred if you put a shot of bourbon in it, not as complex as advertised."
""
"Pours a moderately-dark caramel color with a short off whiter head and a thin collar. The nose has bourbon and some slight oak tannin. Heavy malt and light caramel. Flavor is a bit more integrated with a touch less tannin. Medium body with low carbonation. Pretty good, but the bourbon takes over the base beer and is a bit too one-dimensional."
"The beer is a murky copper/brown/orange hue with virtually no head. The aroma brings bourbon, oak, subtle fruit and spice. Good flavor, slightly tannic. Smooth bourbon taste with low carbonation. A tasty brew. A bit less sweet than regular Fred, which is nice. Like the other beers in this lineup, this is suitable for slow sipping and savoring. Overall, very good. Something I would definitely enjoy having again."
"Pours darker than regular Fred, a dark crimson golden with a thin white head, no carbonation, and settles in a still murky liquid. Booze and bourbon dominate the aroma with vanilla, honey, clove, brown sugar. Nearly still body, silky smooth and thick, with a sticky, dry finish. Flavor is syrupy and sweet, following the nose but more bourbon, oak, tobacco and vanilla. Enjoyed regular Fred much more."
"This beer has a lot of potential. Its complex with a well integrated flavor profile that's just downright tasty. However, the lack of carbonation really hurts this one. Still worth seeking out though."
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding nose and taste, but totally flat. It's a nice sipper and I would be head-over-heels in love if it had some bubbles, but hey, it's still not bad totally still. Would recommend, but if you are expecting bubbles, you'll be disappointed."
"BOOYAKASHA!"
"In the end, it's never about the carbonation, it's about the taste, and this beer taste good. Looking forward to coming back and as I listen to this beer develop, and more importantly hoping I have the resolve to hide this for several years to see how the flavors progress over time."
""
"A cognac of beers. Chocolate and vanilla, like that Sam Adams beer. A sipper, rich ingrediants and worthwhile seeking out. Complex bourbon aroma.Good looks as well.Buffalo tasting.Superior barleywine.Only the best from HOTD. Booze is well hidden, I did not realize it was a 10 plus."
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this one. I love regular Fred, so to have this one aged in Bourbon Barrels is a real treat. I'm not the type to rate on looks/carbonation/etc., which I guess this one sort of lacked, but the smell and taste were just what I expected. Really happy to have one of these in the cellar for another time."
"Perhaps the biggest let down in this brew is it's drop dead lack of carbonation. It is full bodied and smooth in the feel. It is thick enough but carries enough alcohol inclusion that it is slick and does not coat the inside of the mouth. While being still does not fully distract from the experience, just the slightest amount of carbonation would have taken this brew into a holy realm... really. It is certainly worth the effort if you get a chance, solid deep brew here."
"O: This beer is a colossal dissapointment. Buorbon Fred had the potential to be a world class brew, the aroma and flavor are there in a big way. But the lack of carbonation creates a huge detraction from the experience of drinking this beer. Damn! I wish this beer was carbonated. Would not have this vintage again, but will re-visit future years, and hope HotD get the carbonation problem fixed."
""
""
"I love both Adam and Fred, so I'm happy to drink barrel aged versions as often as possible. I will continue to savor this for the next half hour or so."
""
"Very happy I got the opportunity to try this and I am excited to throw my other bottle in the cellar for a while. I think this is a great beer but it could be better if the mouthfeel issues were addressed somehow. Beer needs bubbles..."
""
"Seriously, get it together HotD. I'm sick of flat beer, especially when there is some promise. I'm not going to end up finishing this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice stuff, slightly more enjoyable than Fred from the Wood to me."
"OVERALL: This is certainly a unique beer. It is exceptionally tasty and smells fantastic, but I am having a very hard time getting over the mouthfeel. I suppose that if this beer is approached more like a beer-flavored wine, it might work a little better. I have absolutely loved all the other HotD beers I have tried and taste-wise this is no exception. Call me small-minded, but I can't get over the lack of bubbles. That said, I'll look forward to popping open the two in my cellar over the next couple years."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice decadent sipper. Carbonation would be nice, but its absence is not detrimental to the beer."
""
"Overall, I would drink this on a regular basis if I could. A well done, if not slightly frustrating, effort from a brewery that perpetually lands amongst my favorites despite its flaws. I will revisit this to see if Father Time has done his business."
"Overall I'm glad I got to try it. If this was carbonated properly it'd be an absolutely amazing beer."
"Mouthfeel is flat but not incredibly sticky. This beer reminds me of a mead more than fermented grain."
""
""
""
"O: This is an amazing beer. Can only imagine what it would be like with some carbonation. Wow. Makes me really anticipate Adam From the Wood that much more."
""
"3.5/4.5/4.5/4/4"
"O: Good but sordove disappointing due to the carbonaton or lack thereof."
"Overall this beer lives up to the hype, very complex and delicious with a well balanced oak/bourbon element. The only thing I would change is slightly higher carbonation."

"Overall: I can't wait for the bottled version...had on tap with Alan at his old brewery two years ago. It was heavenly then, can't imagine how good it'll be soon in bottle. Buying a case for sure. Alan makes world class beers...always."
"O - Fred aged in Elaigh Craig bourbon barrels for 15 months = Yum!"
"I would love to see this in a bottle, but since this is not likely, I will be back soon to have more of this one."
"D - the abv, though not ridiculously high, is still prominent early on. Not boozy, per se, but I definitely felt it. Nevertheless, it's deceptively drinkable. Fantastic. One of the best bourbon-barrel-aged beers I've tried."
"D: Well, I drank round one in about 5 minutes. That says something."
"Imagine dropping a shot of bourbon into 12 ounces of Fred... Pure deliciousness."
"NOTE: The brewery lists this beer at 12% ABV, despite the current listing here on BA of 10%."
"Honestly I preferred regular FFTW to the Bourbon version. This comes in a little more one dimensional and not as complex. Than again, that's all the more reason to bottle this beer and give it time to develop more character. That being said, even at the $7.50 price per 12 ounce pour in the tasting room I would say that this is worth every penny. Nobody makes beer exactly like Alan Sprints. His beers are truly world class and deserve the respect they receive. Unique, original, and delicious, I will be buying bottles of this for further development if given the opportunity."
"Drink Ability: Alcohol bomb! It tastes like sweet bourbon but I kind of dig it. It's ABV of 11.5 but t's pretty drinkable."
"D - Perfect. If you can get your hands on this one in 9 months, please do so. The leather and dark roast flavors in the typical Fred have been replaced by sweet bourbony goodness."
