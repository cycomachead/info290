Taste is great but leans heavier on the oude tart than tuesday with crazy flavor mix of tart dark fruit, leather, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar leaning into a mild tart finish. Not puckering like Oude Tart. Feel is medium carb with a nice medium body.","alaimoa","Apr 21, 2014"

Big sour cherry and vinegar aroma, chocolate, brown sugar. Flavor is black cherry skins, a little booze, tart vinegar, some strange flavors in the background I can't put my finger on that I assume comes from the Black Tuesday. Much more body that Oude Tart and not quite as much lactic tartness. Still sour but with an expected big sweetness to go along from the blend. Plenty of carbonation. Really neat blend that works despite sounding totally weird.","BMMillsy","Feb 13, 2014"

4.36,5.3,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,"O - Mélagne No. 1 is a barrel-aged blend of Oude Tart and Black Tuesday that, through and through, feels more like Oude Tart with a splash of Black Tuesday than a blended beer. Sharp cherry skin tartness and acidic sourness are at the forefront of every aspect of this brew, chiseling away at the enamel on your teeth and subduing your tongue into #sourpower submission. Expanding on the subtle chocolate and brown sugar-like sweet hints of Black Tuesday by adding a considerable amount more would be a welcome shift in the beer's blend, really opening up it's own uniqueness rather than a feeling like a half-assed cuveé. But, BUT! You won't hear me complaining about drinking this sour-as-hell beer; it's exactly what I live for; it could just be better.","BeerFMAndy","Jan 03, 2014"

4.28,3.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"a blend of two of the most unique and delicious beers from the bruery, thanks to drlovemd87 for busting out some cellar treats for our new years eve party. this takes everything i didnt like about oude tart (its insane acidity, its front of tongue focus, and its intense carbonation) and smooths it out with black tuesday, one of the best big stouts going. the chocolate from the stout balances the acid quite a bit, and its relative heaviness settles the carbonation down enough to make a much more drinkable, let alone interesting, beverage. still rather red in color, i wonder what percentage the blend it, probably not fifty/fifty. i think its a little oude tart heavy, as the cherry notes and burgundy sour properties come through more i think in nose and taste than the bourbon and chocolate notes of the stout, although those are what tempers the intensity of oude tart and makes me like this blend better than it. a lot less body than black tuesday on its own, the balance between sour and sweet is right on the money, and the layers of flavor keep coming long after the swallow. maybe not quite as cohesive as it could be, i still taste both beers as individuals here, but this is downright awesome beer.","StonedTrippin","Dec 31, 2013"

Smell is tart, cherries, lacto, white grapes, some bourbon, vanilla, and sweet malts. Taste is oude-tart forward with apples, grapes, cherries, and other sour fruits. Behind these flavors are the big base of black tuesday which imparts some chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Honestly though the black tuesday is subdued. Mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation, fairly smooth. Overall I'd be curious to know the proportions of the blends, this tastes like 75/25 oude tart.

Light oak and vanilla mixed with spirits. The flavor feels more stout like than the aroma lead me to believe. A solid sweet coffee caramel and chocolate with a hint of molasses and smoke. Up front I get a pleasant dark dried fruity/cherry tartness that at first seems to belong in a stout but the tartness builds towards the end of every sip. Light lactic bite and little to no hops to be found. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet tart almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is an interesting beer, it is certainly unique and I enjoyed it. I really like both of the base beers in this blend, but I question whether the sum is greater than the parts here.","johnnnniee","Oct 30, 2012"

2.11,-49,3.5,2.5,2,2,1.5,"Dark brown with a brown head that hangs around a while, this beer looks decent. The nose is quite dominated by the Oude Tart. In fact, it's like Oude Tart Gone Wild. Seriously sour, acidic, acetic and vinegary, the bugs have gobbled up all the Black Tuesday character there is. The palate is sour, rather exceedingly so with a sharp vinegar sourness, chocolate, mild caramel and some oak. Very sharp, there's also some acetone. Medium-full in body with moderate carbonation, this is too sour for its own good. This is definitely atrocious, and split 7 ways, there was 12+ oz remaining, and at $25 a pop, an awful experience. Not recommended.","DefenCorps","Sep 11, 2011"

4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another big thanks to my buddy Chad for opening another great (and rare) bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a reddish hue. It has an off-white head that lingers for some time. Scent is tart cherries with a profound vanilla aroma. Also a nice amount of chocolate cocoa in the nose. Taste is initially sweet chocolate with a lot of oak...sweeter than I was expecting. In the middle of the taste it gets quite sour, but just for a split second before the sour fades to sweet cherries. It finishes with delightful flavors of vanilla and oak. Mouthfeel is full bodied and VERY creamy. Drinkability is very high, as there is no trace of alcohol flavors. Overall, this beer is very unique and extremely delicious. Now I just need to get my hands on some Black Tuesday and Oude Tart.","DovaliHops","Aug 03, 2011"

4.1,-1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is an interesting mix of dark chocolate, malted grain character, somehow piquant but subdued tartness, and ripe fruitiness. I wasn’t quite to sure what to think of a mix of Imperial Stout and Flander’s type sour and I still don’t; I am enjoying it though, even though the right side of my brain keeps on thinking that these flavors I am getting can’t quite possibly work together, but my left side says that they do. This beer is a fascinating experience; I almost want to describe it as sloppy genius, the individual components certainly don’t work together, but somehow as a whole they do. This could have been a complete train-wreck, but in the end it isn’t remotely.","Gueuzedude","Jul 12, 2011"

Sweet tarts but balanced so that your mouth waters for a taste. Taste is to die for. simple…very solid sour. Been drinking a lot of sours today, but this is a nice highlight. Mouth is smooth as day is long. there is no puckering on this sour which is really nice, but there is still a very strong sour flavor solid tasting brew, it is fantastic.","cosmicevan","Jun 28, 2011"

4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Massive thanks to beeruser for sharing this one at one of our weekly tastings! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a massively dark brown with a red hue while being almost black (if that makes any sense) with a two finger light tan head that subsided slowly to one finger. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and diacetyl. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, cherries, butterscotch, and brown sugar. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew without a doubt. Just imagine you get a Black Tuesday that is infected (in a good way), that is pretty much this beer. The flavors going on here REALLY compliment each other really well and makes this one very easy on the palate and keeps you coming back for me. It also helps that the aroma is quite excellent as well. Get this on your palate!!!","thagr81us","May 28, 2011"

3.95,-4.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark brown color with a small creamy tan head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a bit of chocolate and molasses. Behind that is brown sugar and a good amount of bourbon plus a strong oak and cherry cherry. Mild dark fruits a good dosing of acidity. The flavor carried a strong cherry presence that actually overwhelmed the Black Tuesday portion by just a bit. Nice thick roasty and chocolate stout paired with a cherry sourness. Description is dead on. Perhaps a bit too acidic in the finish, as it didn't quite gel with the full, creamy body. At least, that's where I stand. Glad I have a bottle of this and looking forward to seeing how it ages out.","Thorpe429","May 05, 2011"

Being a mix of Black Tuesday and Oude Tart, it pretty much does look like what I imagine it would if you mixed the two together. The smell if actually kind of funky with a very different blend between roasted malt, chocolate, and oak with a fruity sour quality. Interesting to say the least. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. The flavor is good given the odd blend of these 2 beers. Starts with some roasted notes with caramel and chocolate that quickly transition to some fruity tartness. Surprisingly balanced in my opinion.
