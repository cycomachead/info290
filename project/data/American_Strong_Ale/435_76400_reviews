"The feel is this beer's worst aspect.  It's not clean, though it starts fairly smooth.  It gains a roughness and astringency.  It ends with lots of graininess, and it can't quite seem to figure out whether it's sweet or dry."
"If I mixed real beer with half crappy beer this is what I would expect."

"Finally a winner from Minhas. Not earth-shaking, and not something I'm going to go around singing the praises of, but 2.29 gets you a damn fine ale here."
""
""
"Not bad for a $2.29 bomber..Tastes like a bock with some hops added."

"Not a fan of the style, drain pour worthy."

"Boatswain H.L.V. Ale has a thick, spongy, cream-colored head, a dark brown, bubbly, opaque appearance, and a little bit of lacing left behind. The aroma is of sweet, syrupy, dark-roasted barley malt or brown bread crust, and the flavor is of that element, with strong, straight-forward bitterness and sugar. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and Boatswain H.L.V. Ale finishes rich, sweet, and semi-wet. Overall, this one is surprisingly good. I recommend it! RJT"

"budget strong ale"
"At 2$ for a 650Ml bottle, you can’t find any beer on lees at this price, and this one holds its own."

"A third time -- I'm pretty confident this beer is well past its prime, though I'll never know. Based on this experience, I wouldn't want to try HLV again, but it's probably not normally this unpleasant."

"Trader Joe's offers this beer for $2 and some change that already makes it a great bargain. Nice head good retention good roasty malt taste with hints of chocolate and 7% ABV for $2 perfect for when Im broke and want a quality beer. If the price was ever raised to twice that amount, I would probably still buy it"

"O: Overall, it was only two bucks, which is well worth the price, its not outstanding or anything, but if the price is right, the price is right."
"This is my first go with a strong ale and this particular version was somewhat reminiscent of a weaker stout with a black ale body. The flavors were a bit one dimensional, but passible. However the body was too thin and the smell wasn't much better than a macro. I expected more from this beer (perhaps simply because it comes in a bomber). I think I may have picked this up a Trader Joe's, anyhow I don't foresee myself getting this again unless it is under $2 a bottle. Life is too short to repeatedly buy costly mediocre beers."

"Taste is metallic dried fruit and toasted barley up front, and sweet, with slightly drier spicy finish. Feel is solid and full, not watery, not oily. It is simple but very enjoyable."

"O: Decent brew – good flavors and aromas with enough alcohol to make it interesting."

"A 22 oz bomber. Clear garnet brown with a very nice head. Good lacing. It may be an American strong ale but it has a decidedly English aroma. Toffee, brown bread, and yeast fruitiness. A hint of alcohol and coffee. Taste follows the nose. Like an English strong ale but hoppier. Still earthy but bigger. Lots of toasty malt with caramel and light fruitiness. Dry finish with lingering notes of gain grains and earth. Feel is soft and supple with a surprising lightness.. A solid tasty beer. At just over two bucks for a bottle it is an outstanding value."
""
"O- Mehhh. Nothing stands out. Very plain brew."
""
""
""
"O- There are some nice soft malt flavors but the bitterness overpowers it and makes it a bit tough to finish."
""
""

"Very surprised that I enjoyed this as much as I did. Sorry Boatswain."
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer for the price. Just not my usual style."
"Overall, for the price ($2.50 a 1 pt 6 oz bottle at Trader Joe’s), this is not a bad beer, and the 7% ABV does add a nice layer of complexity and flavor. However, the beer is somewhat weak and watery, and largely overpowered by grapefruit rind, so that the entire experience is overly bitter, masking the nice sugars underneath."
"O - Starts off pretty good, but rapidly wears out its welcome. Perhaps a decent stepping stone to better beer, but difficult to recommend."
"First sip shows a big malt bill, with caramely notes and a little bit of roast. Unfortunately it goes on to reveal serious flaws. Slightly spicy (not necessarily bad), but also cloying sweetness (bad) on top of rotting fruit (worse). Unlike the other Boatswain beers I've tried recently, there's definitely some flavor in here, unfortunately it's not very good, even if it gives the impression the guys at Rhinelander tried...though not too hard. Well, maybe considering the price. Oh well, I've learned not to be disappointed."
"O - Overall, I wasn't expecting a game changer for $1.99, but for the money, it's not bad. If you're looking for a super malty beer, this one may be worth a shot."
""
""
"I've been trying all of the Boatswain beers that Trader Joes carries. So far so good. The HLV Ale was very nice, though a little syrupy. The flavor was good though and the bitterness was at a nice level. For $2, this beer is well worth the money and a nice find."
""
"Overall - about what I would expect for a $2 beer; a decent strong brown ale; nothing noteworthy but nothing horrible; after drinking a bottle of this, the lasting bitterness and alochol bite in absence of anything else means I wouldn't buy it again"
""
""
""
""
""

"Not bad. An American strong ale brewed by Rhinelander for Trader Joe’s, it’s a great value at only $1.99 for a 650 ml bottle. Dark malts, plenty of hops, and a 7% ABV, what more do you need? Don’t expect something that tastes like it came from Dogfish Head or Lagunitas and you won’t be disappointed."
""
"A few different tastes coming through with this beer, at the price per 22 ounce bottle of this stuff its a very worthy try, although I don't think I'll make this my regular drink."
"Overall a great value for the quality. Not the best beer of this type, but I'm happy and will come back to it at some point. Just poured the rest of the 22oz bottle into my glass, and looking forwards to it!"
""
"O: this is good for its style and good for me."
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light and a huge tan head that persists forever. Smells of toffee and brown sugar with an earthy mineral edge to provide some balance. Light caramel and a hint of chocolate round out the nose. The flavor is a bit sweet with a heavy toffee and caramel up front. There's a weird back and forth between malt and earthy mineral and metallic flavors that sustains for most of the flavor curve. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mineral water mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, and it grew on me a bit after it warmed up. I probably wouldn't try it again, but thanks for the opportunity Dave."

"UPDATE: Not sure if my tastes have changed or if I am tasting a sub-par batch, but I am not enjoying this as much as I did when I first reviewed it. Tastes like bitter burnt coffee, no where near the smoothness of a moose drool. Still worth every penny of 1.99, but you'd be better of saving that money and applying it towards something more satisfying."
""
""
"I almost want to do a YouTube review of this just to show people that it's not as bad as people make it out to be."
""
""
"I don't understand the hating on Boatswain, because though it's not the greatest beers it's also not the worst. Poured a 1.5"" beige velvet head of pretty long life. The body is a dark burnt umber brown even when held to the light. It smells mildly of sweet roasted malt. The taste is a little bready, malty, and has a cocoa after taste. Medium weight body does betray the Heavy Lift Vessel moniker. Look, this doesn't have the impact of a truly intense microbrew but it's still enjoyable and it's a good value at Trader Joe's."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark earthy brown amber with a half finger light tan head that dissipates to a patchy layer and slippery lacing. Aroma of very light toasted malt, nuts and a spicy component similar to cinnamon . Flavor subdued brown sugar, sweet bready malt finishing sweet with light hops and a hint of chocolate. Aroma and flavors are attenuated, but pleasant. Medium bodied. Somewhat like a very light, sweet porter. The elements are all here, but it needs a little more flavor and integration. No too bad for the price, has a distinct malt syrup flavor that is uncommon in most beers."
"I had high hopes upon looking at this beer. A bit of nice foam atop a dark, but not-too-thick body (once poured into a glass). It's hard to know what to expect from it, as it really gives no indication of what type of beer it is, other than being an ale. But I'd compare it most to a porter, a style that I'm not all that fond of in general. As for the flavor, I found it pretty undrinkable. Very malty and bittersweet. But if you like porters, don't hesitate to give it a try. It was at Trader Joe's at a reasonable price ($2.50 or so for a 650-ml bottle)."

"Overall: a respectable and interesting ASA with some nice resemblance to a Belgian Strong Ale. Excellent for price point. Improved a bit with warming."
"Clear dark chestnut under a slender off-white head. Smells kind of homebrew-ish...flowers, creaminess, dark fruit, raisin bread, and a little oxidation. Malty, semi-sweet, moderate chocolate and coffee roast, light black malt char, and molasses. Medium-thin-ish mouthfeel. Not awful, but I won't be getting this again."
""
"Trader Joe's. Comes across like a black ale, with some hops and much sugar. Just not that drinkable. Passable taste, syrupy. Big dark head. Slightly underaverage mouthfeel. A little apple and booze in the finish. Let's try it for cooking. Good price."
""
"Overall, this is ok and a decent enough value."
"The beer pours dark like motor oil and leaves a foamy head lingering on top. The smell is bready with some darker chocolaty notes. It is a smooth beer with a lot of malty sweetness. Unfortunately I don't think there are enough hops to balance it out. It is a decent beer, but not one I'll look for again."
""
""
"Overall - I really don't know what to say about this beer. It's drinkable, in the least. There's nothing much in terms of flavor to look forward to, so it's probably not going on my 'buy again' list."
"O: A decent strong ale, but nothing to write home about."
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a chestnut-brown coloring, both dark and vibrant, with a thin, filmy, tan head that clings all over the glass. Aromas are very subtle, with a toasted malt backbone and some old world fruit highlights. Flavors are a complete malt bomb, with fruit characteristics of date, raisin, plum, and fig all richly blended together. Earthy highlights add to the tangible fullness of the palate. The aftertaste is roasted and darkly sweet, with a sugary highlight. Rich, lingering, slightly cloyng finish. Strong in flavor and in feel."
""
"The sweet and bitter combination is not one of my favorites, though it pairs well with toasted cheese and jalapeno potato chips. How cheap this is makes you want to question the price structure of the entire craft beer industry. However, I would recommend one of these and two 40 oz of Crazy Stallion for a nice mixed drink."
"Trader Joe's beers get a bad rap for being cheap contract brews. While some definitely are, others like their Stockyard Oatmeal Stout are great beers for the price. I'd put this one in the latter category. Despite Boatswain being unable to correctly identify their products (see Boatswain IPA and DIPA) this is as good as some pricier brews of a similar dark & strong style---whatever it is. I plan to go back and get another one or two of these. I consider it a good beer for the price."
""
"Root beer, cola, and artificial sweeteners come to mind as the truer malt flavors and hop bitterness sway. The residual flavors quiver and refuse to go away or develop into firmer beer flavor. Despite the beer's fundamental problems, it remains fairly rewarding in its balance and boldness."
"The body was medium, not really ""Heavy", and had a bit of a sticky finish. While the drinkability was decent, I wouldn't have more than one 22 at a sitting. Overall, a decent beer for what it is, a cheap, strong bottle at Trader Joe's."
""
""
""
"Not nearly as bad as their dipa, this at least approaches the style. There's just an off flavor."
""
""
""
"The color when poured into a pint glass was of a medium dark brown with a reddish hue and very little tan foam, with no lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts and hops were evident in the aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, bitter hops and a hint of candied fruit. Overall, the bitterness killed any outstanding flavors and left me with a acidic feeling on the palate."
""
"Final thoughts - $2 a pop and a nice 7% with great flavor. Well worth it for sure"
""
"very dark brown, dark amber when held to light. smell a little sweet with a a liitle hops And a little chocolalte. tastes sweet with only a little hops. mouthfeel has low to mild carbonation. overall just a little too sweet. too chocolatey for my taste and for an ale. No off tastes, for 2 bucks at trader joes it was worth a shot. didnt expect too much, but wont buy again."
""
"Pours an attractive amber color with a small off white/beige head that recedes quickly leaving an average amount of lacing. Smells of booze, overly ripe dark fruits and yeast comprise the nose. First sip is a tad disappointing but not surprising based on the aroma. There’s a spice notes, those dark ripe fruits present but nothing too interesting here. Carbonation is fine making the mouthfeel stand out in a beer where not much else does. Not a bad beer but there is so much better out there to enjoy."
"Warming enhances the experience here to some degree but the finish remains too brief to keep things interesting. A bit of a harsh wanderer with no real direction or redeeming asset.."
"Overall for the $2 I paid it might be worth buying simply as a way of getting messed up if you're tired of cheap malt liquor. Otherwise, it's really not even worth $2 that could be put into some decent beer."
""

"Label did not allude to what was in the bottle, but for $1.99 at Trader Joe's, it was a safe gamble. In a pint glass, people around me probably assumed I was drinking a cola based on the appearance and very mild aroma. Compared to other brown ales (a style I'm usually a fan of), I'd rate this as one of favorites, which was a nice surprise. Rich, dark, toasty, hoppier than average, but very, very, very drinkable. Smooth like Legend's Brown but with more body and more hops. I need to go buy more."
"When I poured it, it was cola-black, and I would've bet my life that it was a porter. Of course you can't tell based on the label, and I hadn't consulted BA beforehand. Anyway, I was wrong! The hops comes through on this, and even though it's classified as a brown ale, I would've said that it reminds me more of a black IPA with a hint of smoked/cooked something on the end. The carbination was good and it had a nice head. I didn't have very high expectations with this beer, but it was on sale for $1.99, and I was pleasantly surprised. Would I buy it again? Maybe...."
""
"Overall - I wouldn't have guessed it from the beer's other characteristics, but this beer has one of the worst flavors of any beer I've tasted."
""
"Overall not a bad strong brown ale in my opinion. Worth the $3 I paid!"
"Overall: Not a bad beer, overall a decent almost “porter-like” brew."
""
"root beer, a bit chocolate, but one-dimensional. Lingers in the mouth with the sweet chocolate taste. Pleasant and soft, but nothing special. At Trader Joe's there are other, better beers to buy.. but you won't feel that you've over paid if you buy this one."
""
"22 ounce bottle from Trader Joe's. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with some red tints. There's also an inch tan head that sticks around for a while, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but light, the brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and some dark fruit. For the most part the taste is like the aroma, but there's a small amount of hop bitterness noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a decent brew, and for just $1.99 a bomber I certainly can't complain about it. Definitely worth a try at that price."
""
"O - an average beer worth a try for the price."
"O This beer isn't bad, but its nothing special. It tastes and smells a lot like root-beer. Still for two bucks a bomber, its not bad at all."
"a great everyday stocker at TJ's. and what a deal @ the price. if your TJ's carries this, i suggest you stock up if you like brown ales."
""
"i bought this beer for two dollars at trader joe's. a guy i talk to who works there pointed it out to me. at first glance i saw the price. 1.99. after looking at it, the deal was sealed. after opening it, i had no regrets. it looks like something i would drink at a bar all night on special. the crazy thing is that it smells and tastes pretty good. definitely something i could drink any time. the feel follows in those tracks. a little think, but still something 'on special' esque when all is said and done, it seems like they were trying to make a good beer that everyone could get. i'm sure it has to do with the cost of making it, but even at that, it's a million times better than getting a cobra 40oz. so take that at face value and enjoy this 1.99 something other than malt liquor for what is, because it's worth it."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, produced a tan head. Retention was average and it left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this American Brown ALe consisted of roasted malt, chocolate malt, and coffee. The taste of this American Brown, medium in body, the flavor of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a slight hint of bitter hop flavor. Dry finish. Overall, it is a very mediocre example of an American Brown- It will do i a pinch but I would not seek it out again."
""
"Overall, an excellent deal. Will buy again."
""
""
"O: I bought this beer for the price so I did not expect much and I found what I expected. Not terrible but not great. Great price but probably won't visit again."
"Picked up a bomber at the TJ in Brookline for under $3. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark brown color, with a nice sized bubbly head. Some lacing, but not much. Had a nice aroma of raisins and brown sugar, and reminded me a lot of smells familiar with a nice Belgian dubbel. Taste better than expected for the price. It was malty and surprisingly hoppy, as the bottle brags about the elevated IBUs (80) on the label. The mouthfeel was the only fault here. It was a bit on the boozy side, plus there was a bitterness that lingered in the middle of my tongue. But, the finished was light and smooth. You can really buy some crap beers out there for $3, but for this price, the HLV was a pretty decent beer."
"Overall: I've appreciated the Trader Joe brews (Mission Street series and the yearly Vintage Ale) for being fairly decent and always getting a decent bang for your buck, but this one wasn't particularly enjoyable at all. It didn't satisfying in the malt or hop department, delivering instead a cutting alcohol presence."
"D-Very nice beer with the exception of the alcohol heat which kind of ruins the beer for me; its a cheap vodka kind of note that really is unfortunate as this is an otherwise solid beer."
"Bottle from Trader Joe’s. Pours brown with a beige, thick head. Aroma is of toasted, bready malt, dark fruit and grassy hops. Full, oily, crisp body. Taste is of toasted malt, brown sugar, roasted grain, dark fruit and earthy hops. Finish is long and bitter. Nice brew."
"O - I like this beer. It is not a OMG! type brew but it is still good and I would buy it again. One would think that with the name Heavy Lift Vessel that it would be a thick beer but that really is not the case. If it were heavier tasting it would most likely be stronger in alcohol, but I think it is very nice as it is."
""
"An interesting beer worth trying for the price."
"Poors dark amber with a billowing beige head that sticks around. This is a very pretty ale.Malty front with a crisp hop finish. Well balanced throughout. Higher alcohol isn't overbearing. Purchased for $1.99 from the Trader Joe's I work at. Many more will follow this guy."
""
"Aromas are roasty and hoppy--very inviting. Flavor is likewise--like a porter with bitter dark chocolate and a long, hoppy finish. Nice feel in the mouth--low-key effervescence, full body, but not overly thick. Very happy beer for a relaxed Jew on Christmas Day."
"The flavor is bland up front, partly from the thin body, mostly from simple malt flavors. The swallow is altogether different: Lots of peppery hop, some strong vanilla notes and a definitive kick of alcohol. The aftertaste is long lasting. Overall, this is an interesting offering."
