"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is pretty drinkable but does not seem to be as balanced as intended. It goes down pretty well little effort. With a little age this beer would even out and could be really fantastic. The hops would mellow a little and the malts would be showcased better."

"O- Good not great but it may just be be. While well built and drinkable, to me the flavor seems a little off. This was my first taste of WTF and with no apparent date on the bottle, I don't know if its me or the brew. I'll have to give it another go."

"Over all this is a nice strong brown ale, a little more bitter than most brown ales that I have had. However, this beer has a nice balance and I would recommend it for a football game beverage."

"O - A damn good imperial brown. Well balanced, smooth, not too sweet. Another brew well done by Lagunitas"

"Overall, an excellent brown ale- different than the typical malty brew- grapefruit, sweetness, and vanilla combine together for an excellent beer."
"Overall, this is a nice sipper, balanced and pleasant. It'd be good with roast beef or pork tenderloin, ham, sausage, or maybe even some rich deserts like creme brulee with berries."

"From my tasting notes: Lagunitas says it’s a Brown Ale, but in pure Lagunitas style they ratchet up the hops to a level that thoroughly blurs that line. It poured a copper brown with a malty sweetness on the aroma with a hint of hops. The taste was like a mixture of a brown ale and an IPA. There was the sweet nuttiness of the malt balanced by the signature Lagunitas hop bitterness that created another great brew. The body was full and helped weigh down the hoppy profile while maintaining its high drinkability. The WTF was another fine beer from Lagunitas!"

"Pours mahogany in color with ruby hues where the light pushes through. An inch of fluffy white head develops, and lingers for a few minutes. Upon settling, a hearty ring of bubbles surrounds the surface while a solid dusting covers it. The aroma is of caramel malt, earthy hops, a bit of spice, and a solid dose of orange/lemon citrus. Some nuts (cashews, most predominantly), toast, and ubiquitous ""dark fruit"" is buried in there as well. It tastes of citrus, a suite of hops (bitter, earthen, and spicy all appear), and some grass up front. Quickly, the more robust malts push through, and caramel, toast, nuts, plum, and a bit of toffee come through. The mouthfeel is initially lightened by the carbonation, but becomes viscous, sticky, and resinous before too long. Finish is dry. Overall, this is a good strong ale that I'd happily drink again. Like many things (everything?) from Lagunitas, there are a ton of hops here, and they play nicely with the maltier base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't consider myself a hophead, as I sometimes think that hops are used to such an excessive degree as to mask the lovely malt flavors. However, I think the brewer has achieved an excellent balance with this beer, which is similar, but superior to, their ""brown shugga"" ale that I sampled last winter."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale tastes full with malt presence and yeast fruitiness with some dried fruit and light caramel elements with mild woody accent and gentle hops in the background. I like how the mild raisiny flavor from the dark caramel comes through with some rum like molasses character too.The taste has some citrus flavor from the hops too which are almost tropical like a ruby red grapefruit near the last taste. Overall this is a really flavorful beer which I was pleased to try ...I wish I had had one sooner since I passed by it before. This is a drinkable beer with great balance of hop and malt flavor."

"Overall, I would recommend this beer during the autumn season. You're not sitting by the pool wanting a nice crisp IPA but you're also not sitting at home in your Christmas sweater wanting a winter warmer or a stout. Excellent beer though. Pick it up if you see it."

"D - A rather interesting brew with lots of pluses and a couple of minuses... The mouthfeel proves challenging and some what unappealing... This one lingers in the no man's land between American Strong Ale and American Black Ale... The end result is nothing more than an interesting merely more the slightly interesting brew..."

"Overall (4/5): Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot is one of those weird beers that exceeds expectations and is more than just a novelty beer. The hoppy imperial brown ale idea really does work in practice, despite the doubts of narrow-minded purists. Excellent stuff by a brewery that's never afraid to step outside the box and get weird with it."

"I poured this outstanding beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was auburn colored and poured a really big head. The head was nice and creamy. The beer smelled a little hoppy but did not taste too hoppy. It was a really nice beer from them and received a GREAT rating in my book. I would certainly buy this again."
""
"Pours ruby brown with a decent head that fell off to some sticky lace. Crystal clear and very attractive. Nose is Lagunitas hop profile all the way. Spicy rye, ripe fruits behind that and pine. Big caramel malt, some bread and a nice touch of chocolate to tempt the palate. As it warms you can notice a little soy quality that ultimately detracts. Taste upfront is big sweet malt , the rye spiciness and some toasted bread. The chocolate is very nice on top of that. Delicate and fruity hops come in with some bitter and oily resin to coat the mouth and it goes down easy and a little nutty. Finishes a little sticky and slightly dry. It’s a plucky little ale that I would have rated higher had it not become salty after a while and had it not tasted so very similar to all the other lagunitas beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This actually one of my all time favorite beers. I think Lagunitas does a great job in general with all their beers and this one is right up there. I especially like how they got this to taste fresh and have the body of a aged beer. I'm going to just kick back now and enjoy this puppy. I suggest you do the same."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Pint glass showed a beautiful clear copper color and a nice 2 1/2 finger head that stayed a long time. The aroma was tell tale Lagunitas with spicy hops front and center, taste flashed the hops and took it to citrus/pit fruit tang that I love from the brand. This Strong Ale has all the good points of a IPA and the ABV of a Barley Wine, solid mouthfeel that lets you know you are drinking something. Overall I'm glad I tried this and always grab new stuff from this brand."

"O- an enjoyable 7.85 %abv brew. At the less than $5(pre tax) it's good value for the money."
""
""
""
"Well done all purpose beer I will enjoy to the end."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For about $8, this is a solid strong ale bomber purchase. It's not quite as flavorful as Double Bastard or Velvet Hammer, but it'll certainly do in a pinch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This takes their other strong ales and puts them right in the basket for me. At the price of $4, this is a ridiculously difficult offer to beat. It's all over the place in terms of flavors, and at times is a little intimidating to finish, but it has tremendous shelf life and definitely could reduce any heat over time, but it also would reduce the forward citrus/pine hop profile going on here as well. I enjoy it fresh, although some time sitting around as settled a lot of the intensity. Great stuff yet again from Lagunitas."
""
""
"A solid offering but far from outstanding. Neither hoppy nor malty enough to fully commit to being either. Still a tasty occassional buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This drinks more like an IPA with darker malts instead of a brown ale with a bit of hoppiness. The aroma threw me for a loop, but once I accepted it was the former instead of the latter, I really grew to like this one a lot. I have to wonder: does Lagunitas make anything that sucks? Don't answer that."
""
""
""
"O: A nice mellow brown ale. Age seems to have made this silky smooth. Goes down like water, very drinkable. Sweet and smooth, I enjoyed it a lot."
""
"O- One of my new favorites from Lagunitas. A nice ruby body with fresh ingredients that do not overwhelm each other. Its a definite must have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really a wonderful ale. I'd call it a cross between Hop Stoopid and Arrogant Bastard, and everone knows how great those two are. Highly recommended!"
"O-interesting beer with features of and IPA and strong dark ale"
""
""
"An aggressive pour yields 2 fingers of soft white head. Color is deep copper brown, smell is mild caramel malt, without much hop overtones. Lacing becomes apparent even before the first sip. The taste of the beer fills every corner of the mouth in a pleasant mix of carbonation, malt, and hops. No apparent bitterness for me, and it soothes the esophagus on the pleasing journey to the stomach. Very well balanced, with no overpowering elements, it can meld to fit almost any occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it's hard to classify this beer. Lagunitas calls it an Imperial Brown Aleand BA calls it a strong ale. It tastes likea cross between a brown ale and an IPA. It is a perfect kick back, feel good beer. Definitely worth trying and always having on hand in the cooler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was pretty impressed with this one. For the price it's a quality beer - it's superbly balanced and very flavorful. To me it almost tastes like a robust IPA that the hops have faded from."

"Overall: Overall, this was a good beer. It falls under the ‘American Strong Ale’ category, but can easily be categorized as a Brown Ale. In fact, I can go as far as to call it an ‘Imperial Brown Ale’. It has the taste and feel of a Brown Ale, but with a heavier Hop presence and a higher alcohol percentage. I also like the fact that it left a good aftertaste."
""
"Wilco Tango Foxtrot from the folks at Lagunitas pours a murky copper with flashes of amber around the edges. An inch of creamy, tan head sticks around as well as to the glass. Hoppy aromas of grapefruit and pine are very noticeable, and very Lagunitas like. Muted caramel and toasted malt aromas provide some contrast to the hoppiness. The caramel malt sweetness, with just a touch of rye, opens the palate up to receive a wallop of citrus and piney hop that pulls through the finish. Medium in both body and carbonation, this Recovery ale weighs in at a hefty 7.8% ABV. Another winner from the folks in Petaluma!"
""
"Growler from Whole Foods poured into a pint glass. Deep, dark amber color with minimal carbonation/lacing. Taste is quite something, woody bitter pine hops with hints of cinnamon, caramel and clove in the finish. Stays complex and is fairly drinkable considering the ABV. Body could use some more carbonation, not sure if that's due to the serving type. Worth seeking out."
"O=For the style, this was a bit more sour than the few others I've tried. It seemed like it would be great if you were expecting and wanted a sour beer, but this one was okay...probably would not buy again."

""
""
"Highly recommended being a beer that is hard to categorize."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"Overall this is not what I am used to from Lagunitas, where I really enjoy the IPAs. Could not drink this all the time, despite drinkability, but good."
""
""
"Overall: Another good strong beer from Lagunitas. This one is one of the better ones from me. The hoppiness isn't enough to steal the show but definitely present. The creamy and sweet malts are spot in for a big tasty beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: definitely one of the better representations of the style."
""
""
""
"O: A great hopped up brown ale with divinely balanced flavors. I love roasty bready malt with citrus hops. This is a beer that I would regularly drink. Doggone good!"

"Overall very nice, and very drinkable. I will definitely look into getting more of this one."
""
""
""
"Overall this is better than I expected. Lagunitas has pleasantly surprised me with their Pilsner and now with this. This is a complex brown/strong ale with a good mix of malts, hops and other flavors. I would recommend you try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Drinkability is high on this one. A well-executed strong ale for sure and it doesn't skimp on the bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this a lot, id call it a hoppy American brown ale before I call it a strong ale, but I suppose that's inconsequential here. this beer pours a nice clear lighter brown, indian red maybe, with a pillowy tan head with outstanding retention. the nose is way hoppy for a brown, it crowds out any malt sweetness and plays off the bitter cocoa powder element perfectly. the flavor is also quite hopped up, and for once in a lagunitas beer, that same old yeast strain actually works here! at least it doesn't detract from the feature elements I should say, its a non-issue, which is nice for a change. love the roasty malts with the hop bitter, its an underutilized combination of flavors. great carbonation and soft texture to a bigger beer. the finish is complex and chocolate forward, but there is also a little residual sugar that challenges the hops. this is a great beer, totally unique, and one I will absolutely be buying again. outstanding stuff."
""
""
"Can't really add much more to what's already been said. It's a delicious brown ale on steroids. You get the nice malt and brown sugar that you expect from a brown, with an extra hop punch. You also get a hint of booziness and a great full bodied mouthfeel. Love this beer and look forward to picking up some more."
""
""
"Overall – This is a rather interesting brew with a rather complex flavor profile, yet it still maintains a great ,somewhat nice complimentarily between the mix of flavors. An interesting and tasty brew."
""
"Chestnut brown with a reddish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a thick, dense foam that slowly dissipated and left random sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent, fresh, citrus hop aromas with pine hops, toffee and sweet caramel malt beneath. Thick, syrupy feel despite the agressive, slightly fizzy carbonation. Pungent grapefruit and citrus hops up front followed by a tangy and brown sugary sweetness through the middle - a signature taste for Lagunitas brews. Citrus hop bitterness trends to pine hop flavors to the end. A strong sweet caramel malt backbone flavor throughout. Finished with a malty and pine bitter aftertaste."
""
"O: A great hoppy brown ale, a style that continues to surprise me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle. Pours a crystal-clear dark copper with nearly no head. Citrus and wet grass in the nose initially but gives way to caramel, toffee, and dark chocolate. Malt dominates the flavor (as promised on the label, with dark chocolate and toffee, but a good note of grapefruit, wet grass, and mint to support it. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. Excellent. Especially for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Poured entire bomber into 34oz mug; dark brown, clear, showing ruby in the light with a thick rocky off-white head that leaves chunky lacing as it dissipates. Smell is hoppy and citrusey, sweet and thick-smelling. Taste is very smooth up front, very clean for the amount of maltiness, with just the right amount of hop bitterness finishing it out with an aftertaste that makes you want to take another sip. Mouthfeel is relatively full, but clean and smooth without being spiky. This is the most drinkable American Strong Ale I've had so far, delicious."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely get it again while available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a darker brown with some amber and light showing through the glass. Some head at pour lingers nicely and some lacing is present. Aroma is malty - caramel and/or brown sugar - with a hint of hops. Good quality flavor - nice brew for a snowy day. Bitter up front but then sweet to the finish."
""
""
"O: a very nice American strong brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It seems like the hops are a bit too aggressive because they compete with the malt bill in a way that is unbalanced. I know that's a stylistic choice for Lagunita's but it seems to have gone a bit too far in this case."
""
"poured out of a 22oz bottle. wtf....this is a good beer. but i have liked all the beers i have had from laguntias. the smell is very hoppy. the taste is bitter with a little citrus. the finish is not quite as bitter as the smell would lead you to believe. over all this is a pretty drinkable full flavored beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice hybrid beer with great balance and decent complexity. Easy to drink for a strong ale with a great price point. Definitely worth picking up, especially if you're a fan of the brewery"
""
"Pours a clear deep ruby amber with a creamy 1"" off white head. Just a bit of lacing on the glass. Nose is very hoppy; orange and lemon with a bit of bready malt. A little tart smell with just a slight suggestion of alcohol. Taste follows the nose: strong hop presence in the nose with a nice caramelly malt backbone. Really great balance between the hops and the malt on this one. Just enough carbonation to lighten up the beer and keep it super refreshing. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Very refreshing and not heavy at all for a beer that clocks in just under 8%. Would definitely buy this brew again and definitely won't split it next time."
"This was a good beer, and a treat to sip on while watching the first few games of the tourney and waiting for my food to arrive. Another win for Lagunitas."
""
"O: the hop smell of this strong brown ale is reminiscent of an IPA, the flavor profile is a little muddled, good but not great"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I found it rather underwhelming, considering the brewery it came from, I expected a lot better. I won't be trying this again but it won't stop me from enthusiastically consuming any other Lagunitas brews."
"Cheers!!"

"I shouldn't be surprised that Lagunitas did another great hoppy beer."
""

"Overall - Solid brew, nice change of pace from hoppier brews. Lagunitas knows what's up and continues to impress."

""
""
""

""

""

"O: Very good beer. This is a full-flavor beer that doesn't assault your tongue with hops. If you're someone that wants more flavor, but doesn't enjoy being mugged by hops, this is an excellent choice. Similar to Lagunitas Censored beer, only exaggerated a bit. Very good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Reminiscent of many of the Lagunitas releases, but less aggressively hopped. Fairly mellow all-around, though not for lack of flavor. Definitely opens up as the beer warms. A solid example of what I feel should be a recognized style, an Imperial Brown."
""
"Served on tap in a 16oz pint glass. Beautiful translucent brown color topped with a 3/4"" head. Good looking, persistent lacing. Aroma is crisp, with spicy undertones and a alcohol heat. The flavor is classic brown ale, and also classic Lagunitas - this is a beer that gives you exactly what you expect when you order it."

"Overall: Lagunitas does it again. Something off the beaten path here but has that feel of one of their beers for sure. At $3.99 a bomber, you cannot do much better dollar wise."
""
""
"O-Very drinkable beer. well blended flavors, great taste. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be, but nonetheless great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark pour with sticky thick head. Very deep red in color, like mahogany. Smell is odd in my opinion, lots of malt, but too bready and yeasty, slightly boozey, and slightly nutty. Flavor is mostly malts, like a heavy duty brown ale. To me it also had hints of soy and is mildly salty. Slightly sweet, like brown sugar. Overall, drinkable but a little odd for me to want to recommend."
"Would Drink Again. 'Nuff said."

"Overall, a pretty nice Strong Ale but i feel it could be better. A little more roast to add to the hops would be wonderful."

""
""

"Overall: A satisfying and tasty brew. If you think you'd like a brown or red ale/IPA crossover, you'll probably like this beer."

"Overall this is a very good beer from Lagunitas. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it after the first few sips, but it certainly grew on me. I enjoyed this slighly more than the Undercover Shutdown as that was a bit too bitter and biting because of the higher ABV."
""
""
"o/D - A good beer, worthy of the try. Nothing too exceptional about it, just well done. I would have liked to have tried this a little younger to see where these hops flavors were at first."

"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of pine and citrus hops notes with huge caramel malt notes. Taste is also a mix between some huge malt caramel notes with balanced sweetness which is mix with some citrus and resin hops. Body is quite full with good carbonation. This brewery keeps putting out great beers. I wish I would have more access to them."
""
"This one strikes me as a strong brown ale (and...apparently...that's what it is, now that I've read it here) with some thick malt tones with some spicy hop going on as well. It's an interesting ale. Not sure it really flows as an ""Imperial Brown Ale", but it's a good drinker."

"Brownish-amber colour, fingers worth of white head and some lace. Smell is quite big and malty with some sweetish sugary points followed closely by a boatload of hops, lots of pine and citrus fruit in the nose. Taste is sweet and malty before being overthrown by hops, citrus, pine, pineapple and grapefruit, nicely bitter throughout before settling into a nice dry finish. Medium carbonation, oily and a nice medium weight in the mouthfeel. Nice hoppy brown ale that brings a nice malt heft as well, the bomber went down no problem and quite quickly."
"I'm enjoying this beer. This brief review doesn't convey the complexities of the beer. I'd recommend you give it a try, if you get a chance."
"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium to dark reddish brown amber with a light tan head with good retention. Aroma of malt, light fruit and light hops. Interesting flavor progression. Intense hop aroma and start, then a nice malty, lightly nutty middle with light citrus and subtle, well melded malt and hop finish. Medium to thick body. Interesting and satisfying. Lagunitas seems to pull off interesting flavor combinations."

"medium body, slightly creamy, nicely carbonated. a very refreshing, flavorful, complex ale. sweet, yet roasty. hoppy, yet malty. a very excellent ale, and a very mysterious style.. all at a very affordable price. i'd recommend this to anyone, honestly."
""
""
"O) This is a really tasty ale. The aroma and flavor are quite unique, and highly enjoyable. I'm struggling to compare it to another beer I've had, but I think that's a good thing. Another solid offering from Lagunitas. Highly recommended...."

"Best imperial brown out there. Makes me realize why Tommyknocker imperial brown is so lackluster. Big boozy presence but drinks very easily - if you like a good brown ale but tire of the low ABV typical of the style, this is your go-to. That's pretty high praise considering my affinity for IPA's and hops..."
""
""
""
"I love this beer a lot for some reason. Usually I love beers that are very robust and hit me in the face with their qualities, but Lagunitas' WTF is a beer I'd say is perfectly balanced with flavors I enjoy. It helps when it looks so damn good too. I'll need to remember to pick this one up more often."

"Pours a clear dark brown with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is quite malty with some caramel and herbal hop aromas. Taste is of brown sugar, caramel, and herbal hop flavors up front with a very malty backbone. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that to me seems like a hybrid between a barleywine and an IPA. Good stuff."
"Notes: Drinks like an Imperial Brown. Good amount of nutty flavor along with caramel malt. The hops start showing up on the finish to ensure it's not too sweet. I liked it, but didn't love it."
""
"O- It's hard to pin point exactly what this beer is, but maybe that's the point. Whatever it is, it is interesting, unique and very tasty."
"Overall: This beer sits between a brown ale and something else, and it does it well. The hops are strong but the malt is wholly lacking either, and overall taste is strangely familiar in its bizzarity."
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Dark brown body, with a light foamy head and a bit of spotty lacing. Nose is a great combination of hefty malt with sweet tones and tea leaves. Flavor is full bodied, thick and hearty combination of woody malt and subtle sweetness. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
"Based on the comments of other reviewers, I'm going to pick up a couple of bottles to age to see how they compare."
""
""
""
"O -An interesting beer for sure, I simply cannot get behind this hybrid style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we found to be the most enjoyable thing about this brew was the sweet nose, and huge mix of malts throughout. The flavoring was simple, but expertly crafted, with honey and sweet hops adding to an already sweet beer, without causing it to become overpoweringly sugary. As for the style, it seemed to exhibit characteristics from both the scotch ale side of life, as well as the American barleywine world, making for a very interesting and robustly flavored brew throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: What would you get if you crossed a Brown ale and a West Coast IPA? This is your answer. A complex and lively West Coast hop profile meets a token Brown ale toasted malt base, with some sweeter and lighter (crystal?) malts thrown in as the wild card. It's a fine brew and a nice change of pace, but it's one of those beers I'd have to be in the mood to drink. Part of me wants to cellar one and see what happens."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice brown with a solid sheet of light tan foam. Smells robustly hoppy with some resin and tea. Nice malty background as well, burnt caramel and crystal malts. The flavor is malt first, slightly oxidized with a good helping of bitter and noble hops. Some grass and pekoe, nice flavor; just what I was looking for this morning honestly, glad I chose this one. Medium bodied with slightly hi carb and a wet finish. I like this beer, would actually like it more with a couple more months I'd guess. Good stuff."

"O- WTF is it? A dark IPA or a hoppy brown ale? Whatever it is, it's good. These guys like to play and seem to love what they do and it shows in the quality of the product."
"Notes - This brew tastes very similar to a brown ale"
""
""
"Body is medium to medium-heavy, seems just right for the intended style. Carbonation is mid-level, which allows for a gentle foaming on the palate and an easy sipping experience. Ethanol is a bit noticeable, in feel, which detracts somewhat from enjoying this as much as possible. Resultant mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat creamy, but with a bit of harshness and heat from ethanol."
"Overall - For my first Imperial brown ale, I was pleasantly surprised by the initial hop aromas - I knew I was in for a real treat with this style. Malts play a significant supporting role, helping in the brew's balance. Very enjoyable and worth a go."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin in texture. A very decent brew overall."

"O/D-I really liked this brew. I enjoyed the fact that its malt-stressed but there is still a good dosage of hops. Rich, sweet and perfumey. Always happy with my Lagunitas purchases."
"Good beer! The reason I gave a 3.5 as overall is that it just has the typical Lagunitas taste."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a duvel tulip. Pours a rich ruby brown with a two inch off white head that slowly recedes to cover the top. Lacing is decent. Aroma is pine resin, leather, wood, and sweet bread. Taste is sweet up front. Brown sugar, hazel nut, and toasted malts. Bitterness creeps in with a pine like profile that has sweet citrus qualities. Mouthfeel is thin and it lingers a bit. Interesting take on a brown and pretty good."

"Not being a big fan of malty beer, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Good stuff."

"Overall: Unique in so many ways. Definitely not what I was anticipating. Well worth the $3.99!"

""
"Good beer for sure. Tho not my style but still enjoyed it none the less."

"Poured into my san miguel snifter with etched bottom I scarfed from Wimbeldon while in London last year, this beer pours excellent with a finger and a half malty head, very dark but not opaque some orange hints. The smell is wonderfully pungent with the back of my jaw aching to taste what comes to be a rich somewhat heavily roll around my tongue. The taste is surprisingly hopped up with with a corriander burnt approach. The aftertaste is sweet and sticks around. Over all I give this CA bomber high marks and worthy of Lagunitas lofty reputation - Well Done!"

"O- The previous and mostly pedestrian reviews of this offering do not do WTF justice. Although the nose is not the 'hop bomb' that people expect from Lagunitas, one taste will remind you that this beer could have come from only one brewery...pronounced, Lah-Goo-Knee-Tuss."
"I'm sure the guys at Lagunita's just wanted to make a big malty beer for once with the same kind of kick, but not in you face hops. And since there is a range of ways to brew an American Strong Ale, I will not hold it against them. I am happy to have picked up a bomber of this ale."

"O - This one grew on me from the time I took my first sip. Good beer from Lagunitas that's fairly easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Feels pretty well carbonated, full in body, and warm in the end."
""
""
""
"O - Worth trying especially if you like the style. I had this a year ago and found it better this time around. Bottle was close to a year old; perhaps the age served this well."
""
"O- Good beer especially for the price, thought the taste was a bit lacking. Its fairly hoppy but not that well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good tasting brew but a little harsh on the bitter side."
""
""
""
""
"OK, I got this today on a whim. The major factor in my decision to purchase was it was fairly cheap, $4. Next, I really liked little sumpin Sumpin Ale. This beer pours a deep amber with a nice head on top. There is lacing but it fades fast. The smell is a bouquet of citrus. I don't really know what an imperial brown ale is supposed to smell like. The smell is decent, but its nothing amazing. Upon tasting this beer you can defiantly detect a hop not followed off by some kind of malt backbone. The beer feels fairly smooth in the mouth. This beer is decent, but its nothing to write home about. I give it a 7 out of 10"
""
""
""
"M: Creamy feel. Coating and mildly dry. No booze."
""
""
""
"I wouldn’t buy this one again."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer after all. Not big in malts or hops but everything comes together in a well defined and pleasing way. I'm used to more intense brews from Lagunitas, but this is a nice change of pace. Interesting too..."
"Clear, dark chestnut color with a slender head quickly fading to a patchy covering. Juicy, fruity hop bouquet...sweet, oily, and floral primarily with some citrus and a surprisingly mild caramel note. More juicy, dank hop oils hit the tongue in typical Lagunitas fashion. It's not a particularly intense beer in any aspect - well done in the hop department, though the flavor tends to vanish as quickly as it comes. If you chew on it a bit, the hop character is nice...dried fruity, resinous, citrusy. Increasingly malty as it warms, but it never comes all that close to what I would venture to call an ""Imperial Brown Ale"". Some caramel, brown sugar, and nuts. Medium bodied with a creamy slickness. The ambiguous hoppy strong ale style is something these guys do a lot of and they typically do a good job. While this doesn't stand out in any way, it is well crafted as usual."
"I really like this beer, enough to seek out other Imperial Browns, a new-to-me style. I'm a fan of Dogfish Head Indian Brown, and me thinks I like this one even more!"
""
"I would have liked to taste this beer in its heyday. My local shop only got it this week so I assumed it was relatively new, or else the reviews I read were of a different version of this beer. Either way, at $4 for a bomber I would get it again for a nice warming change up to spring/summer beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I was drinking it over a a long period while playing video games. As it warmed the hoppyness became less overpowering and the unique flavors of the brown malt come through. The claim on the bottle ""robust"" and ""malty"" are realized closer to room temp. Should be served warm, not sure what I was thinking drinking a double at fridge temp. Changed taste and mouthfeel from 3.0 to 3.5 because it thickened up a touch and got roastier."
""
"DOA"
"O: $4.99 for this amount of depth and hoppy goodness. Enough said."
""
""
""
""
"Well at 3.99 a bomber this is a steal like most Lagunitas beers. If you are not drinking beers from this brewery there is something wrong with you."
""
"Pours a translucent amber copper with a foamy light tan head. The head dissipates quickly, but laces the glass as the beer is consumed. The aromatics are pleasant and tantalizing with a sweet grapefruit and brewed tea bouquet that also yields mild notes of pine needles. The pine shows up more on the palate. The scrubbiness on the tongue could be less. A slicker, wetter mouthfeel could have improved the experience on the palate. Sweet grapefruit makes an appearance. Finishes quite bitter. A good beer, but not fantastic."
""
""
""
"O- solid beer. glad I tried it but probably won't seek it out again unless its on the out of date/clearance rack."
"O: An excellent purchase for $4.50 a bomber. Fruitier and lighter than anticipated, with good drinkability. A well balanced and sweetly fruity beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: very flavorful ale from a brewery that makes a lot of big bodied brews. american hops battle with what i would guess to be crystal and chocolate malts. the nose/flavors really showcase each. tasty and worth seeking out especially at such a moderate price."
""
"O- always a fan of lags brews! My fav brewery! This one was good but not one of my favs from them. Dont have anything bad to say about it at all but there is better from lagunitas. Cheers!"

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 2/23/2012. Pours fairly clear reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, orange, herbal, pine, and nuttiness. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of big pine, caramel, biscuit, toast, herbal, orange, grapefruit, nuttiness, and a bit of molasses. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, citrus, biscuit, nut, and toast on the finish for a good period. Some nice malt balance, but this is still a very hop forward beer as would be expected from these guys. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and oily mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Definitely a beer that should be sipped on. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable hoppy brown ale. Good amount of balance and complexity. I would like to see what age brings this one; this was a very fresh bottle."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium brown color with a slight off white head. Scent is rather malty with some hints of hops and overall rich in grains. Taste is heavy with the malts in the beginning and slowly ends with a growing bitter taste. Other tastes include cocoa and roasted malts. The volume if full of taste and flavors of malts and hops erupt with every sip. Another delicious hit from the folks at Lagunitas."
"O: tasty ale. If I were jobless, I'd want something with a heavier alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
"Not a surprise that I liked this beer. I haven’t met a Lagunitas that I haven’t disliked yet. Very similar to the IPA, just a tad bit darker."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. A bit more dark fruit flavor that most Strong Ales, however, it blends nicely with the other malt and hop flavors."
""

""
""
""

"O-once again, Lagunitas makes an affordable and great beer with a good hoppy twist to it. this is a great beer. i wish i didn't i have to share the bottle! definitely a unique brown ale, and not something i'd mind having again some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of kind of a black ipa but with less roast and more sweetness. It balances the hop profile more though instead of fighting the roastiness. It's not an official style but I really enjoy it. Laguinitas can easily charge $10 for this bomber. If you're a hop head you'll love it, albeit a different approach. Challenged to find more complexity in the flavor though."
""
"O: Overall the beer had a very unique presence, and I won't fault it for what it is. On a personal note, I wasn't too fond of it and wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable strong ale. The hops make the beer. Everything else adds to its depth. After seeing the style in the ""Notes"" section, ""Imperial Brown Ale," it makes complete sense and I wonder why this style isn't more common."
"M: Medium bodied with good mouth coating. Fairly powerful carbonation and warming effect."
""
""
"O - An enjoyable brew. Loved the use of lots of hops with this brown ale."
""
""
"Overall a solid brew that begs for more hops to put it over the edge."
"O- Not sure how i would classify this. I know Lagunitas offers an Imperial Red Ale, but this seems similar to me. Big hops, a touch of sweet malt, and a nice, balanced finish."
"O: Overall this beer drinking experience has been a success, I enjoy the beer, and it didn't cost a lot. This is a rather strange brew, It's supposedly an Imperial Brown Ale, but it reminds me more of a german doppelbock or something... I donno... But I recommend trying this one out."
"O-this is a pretty good beer. Much hoppier than expected, but can't complain about that. Nice malty flavor. Mixes well, I think this was a nice surprise and wouldn't mind having this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you like your brews strong, Lagunitas is on to something here. Strong yet refined in taste, a creamy texture; combined makes for an ale you won't forget. Even if its a little disjointed in what it wants to be, I actually kind of think its akin to a Red Ale, more than Brown anyway."
"O- This is another very drinkable beer from Lagunitas. I enjoy all their sessional beers. I also the like the political nature of this beer because it's a WTF? To Obama and all the promises he didn't keep."
""
""
"Poured a dark, opaque copper that appeared to be totally filtered. Produced a very small, tighly laced bone white head that was reduced to a mere inconsistent ring around the glass. There is a slight hoppiness smell with little else. The tastes are very blan with a slight bitter hop forward taste, an even slighter malt finish. The buds are left tasteless. Not really sure whats going on with this. I'm as confused as the bottle for the label reads ""We're not quite in the Red, or in the black... Does that mean we're in the Brown?"" This beer left a lot to be desired regardless of what style it was aiming for. The price was cheap and this is definitely a case of getting what you paid for."
""
""
"Overall - Its solid but slighty off in balance. Kind of feel like its two different styles trying fighting with eachother trying to be the featured beer. Decent, great price but forgetable with all the other great beers out there. Worth a drink one time or so."
""
""
""
""
""
"C"
""
"Overall WTF is very good beer. WTF is just a really good, stronger, deep flavored ale, that is damn cheap ($4.75 a bomber). More hops than I expected (I never argue with that) but still very well balanced in all areas. I wonder what a year or even two would do to this one...Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Didn't really have any expectations coming into this but it tastes like a strong ESB using Cascade hops. Some chocolate or crystal malt sweetness would really help this one be more balanced. I did like the hop flavors but this missed the mark."
""
""
"O: This is a very good quality beer. This beer is perfect on the wallet, which is also a plus too."
""
""
"O: Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: WTF is a complex brew, with impeccable flavor and medium body. Alcohol is hard to detect, even though it's there. Amazingly drinkable, and for that it could be dangerous. I love this beer, as it is great by itself, and would pair with just about any hearty meal. Venison roast, anyone?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - What an interesting mix of flavors! The balance and complexity here are really nice. Has flavors from multiple styles here, and it works so well. Unique, and very tasty. Go out of your way to give this one a try. It says 59 IBU's, but it truly tastes like more."

"Good beer, would buy this again."

"I really enjoyed the depth of flavor and aroma. I wasn't expecting such intense dark fruit flavor from this brown beer. The body finished a little bit thin and dry however, I think a richer mouthfeel and more significant body would really compliment this extremely tasty brew."
"O: Overall a really fantastic release from Lagunitas once again."
""
""

"O- A very drinkable and flavorful fruity strong ale. Great for when your sitting around having a lazy day or out enjoying a night on the town. I could see this going great with a cigar, sitting out on your back porch looking out into the horizon. A very delicious strong sophisticated beer."

"Lightly carbonated and bordering on a full-bodied beer, Wilco Tango Foxtrot goes down quite easily, in spite of its relative strength. It is juicy, soft on the palate, and slightly warming, with a pleasant maltiness that serves as a counterbalance to the hoppy character that lingers on the tongue. A bitter, long finishing drink that pairs well with food, this is an ale to be savored, only to be brought out when the need for a little good cheer is pressing."

"Poured a 1 1/2"" off-white head which lasted pretty long. Clear burnt umber brown body with a touch of red when backlit. Smells nice but it's mainly malt and a little hint of hops. Taste mirrors the smell with sweet malt and medium hops in the finish. Enjoyable but not a big standout, other than the fine economic well-wishes on the labelling."
"O: I like this. Overall, it reminds me of a super-mellow Bigfoot. Not available locally, but if it's still in stock the next time I'm in Illinois, I would probably buy another."
"o - an interesting brew and highly enjoyable. i guess this is their take on a black ipa? whatever style it is, it's worth seeking out, especially at $5.50 a bottle."
"Interesting and perfectly drinkable but doesn't particularly grab me. Flirts with a few different styles without landing anywhere definitive."
"Powerful smell starts off from the pour. Rye bread, raisin, caramel. All malt, like a good brown. Poured with little lace and small head that went away and is brown like a cola. Mouth is full with mostly the raisin/prune aftertaste. Just a touch of bite at the end and in a bit of foaming. Taste is all of the above. Mostly fruity on top of huge malt with a caramel sweetness at the bottom. Strong ale indeed. This one hits everything. Very complex and tasty. I'd get this again."
"Pretty good, well balanced brown ale. It took some skill and finesse to get these flavors to meld so well."
"Overall a good beer. I find Lagunitas' regular offerings to be a little tame and stale, but their limited releases are something to be sought after."
"All around this is a really solid brew. Was expecting more of a barley wine style beer, but this is not quite as extreme as that, in its favor. Really good beer, I will be buying again."
"A brown and ruby red blend with an inch of foamy, off white head. It leaves a thick ring around the edges. Malty sweet aroma. Brown sugar and caramel. Some cherry and faint amount of raisin. Fruity malt flavor upfront. Bready caramel backbone with cherries and raisins. The middle is slightly sweet with more of a grape twist than raisin. Finishes dry. I was expecting a tangy sweet end but this dryness was surprising. In a good way. As the beer warms the 8% shines through. The cherry flavor turns medicinal. I am a fan of the flavor combinations just not when it warms up a bit."
"Overall an excellent brew - one of the best Strong Ales I've had in quite a while. Definitely expected more bitterness, especially after running it under my nose. One of the best balanced beers I've ever had. Excellent work by Lagunitas!"
"""A Malty, Robust, Jobless Recovery Ale"". If this is supposed to be the antidote to those whom are suffering in this current climate, then they're going to be in recovery mode for a long time."
"I'm in a rush, so I didn't put much thought into this, but it's really good!"
"Very good beer. We can debate elsewhere to what degree a ""Jobless Recovery," to which this beer is dedicated on the label, has occurred. The former surely persists and, while the latter remains elusive, perhaps another way to consider this beer is as inducing benevolent haze for our current malaise. This fits the bill and is worth enjoying a few. Very good, yet again, from Lagunitas."
"I have come to expect great things from Lagunitas and this beer did not let me down, plus it is hard to beat the $5 price tag. I will definitely buy this beer again and search out some of their other strong ales such as Hairy Eyeball and Brown Shugga. I would recommend this to anyone who likes well balanced beers or just beer in general."
"Overall I enjoyed this. Reminds me of a simple barleywine with plenty of flavor. Though I do feel the alcohol doesn’t hide itself well."
"O: I love American Strong ales like this. I know its a catch all style, but brews like WTF and Arrogant Bastard are so good. I feel that more should be made like em'."
"Another quality offering from Lagunitas; one's enjoyment of this particular offering will depend on tolerance for candy-like malt sweetness."
"A very, very sweet strong ale. In a lot of ways, its reminded me of Lagunitas Maximus DIPA, which isn't at all one of my favorite beers. I'll pass on this next year."
"This is my 1st review here on BA after about 3 months of trying new styles of REAL BEER and after doing my 1st home brew this morning (Dunkel Weisen). Right or wrong this is my take on this brew. Poured this bad boy into my Chicago Cubs mug for ole #10 Ron Santo, rest in peace; you were a Cubbie till the very end ! This brew pours a dark Pepsi Cola brown with red tint and 1 finger off white head which dwindles down to a frothy layer atop the brew. There are 40 umpteen tiny bubbles surfacing from the bottom, it looks 	more like a soda than a beer. Smell is fairly astingent, alcohol, dark fruit, dark roast coffee, piney hops. Wow, I figured the hops would blow me away, but that's not the case at all. Alcohol and hops are well hidden with the roasted malts taking front and center. Semi dry on the tongue and mouth. Can taste the hops half way through the mug, but still not overly bitter. Dark roasted coffee becoming more prominent. As it warms more the piney hops continue to come forward, still not offputting. Becoming semi clowey in the throat. (2nd pour) Head hangs around somewhat longer than the 1st pour, dark malts dominate the smell now, followed by dark roast 	coffee. The lacing is a stringy patchy impression that weeps downward. Back to the dark roast coffee and dark malts on the tongue with bittering hops coming forward half way through the mug. I like this, how it moves from dark coffee/malts forward to bittering hops forward as you move from the top towards the bottom of the mug. Spider web layers of off white lacing as you move 3/4's of the way through the mug. I've never experienced a brew like this that is so multi faceted as you move from the top to the bottom of the mug. Starting to pick up some sweet crystal malts near 80% through the mug. This is an amazing brew, multifaceted to the Nth degree. Reminds me of the days of Or, when chemicals were used to expand the mind. I'm gonna have to 	say AfrigginMazing. Thanks Lagunitas for a step back into my sorid past, some 30+ years ago.The only thing that would have made this better would have been to be listening to Jimmy Hendrix blarring Purple Haze. DUH, just figured out the WTF, similar to playing Beatle recordings backwards. Cool beans"
"Overall the name WTF sums it up...and I like that."
"Poured into my 13 oz tulip. A nice ruby clear red, with a two inch off white sticky head. Smell some pine, citrus, carmel, and some breadyness. Taste same, very easy drinking. Nice body, with plenty of life. Very nice beer and as always a great price. Wish N.H. carried limited releases from them."
"O - This has good drinkability. It has good flavor, and it is definitely an interesting beer. There is a lot going on here in all departments. There is caramel sweetness, hoppy bitterness, fruit, wood, booze, and some dryness. It really makes for quite and interesting beer. It's a new adventure with each sip. i recommend trying it out."
"Pours a hazy deep copper hue which leaves a two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is sweet caramel and toffee malts,piney hops,fruit cake and raisins,the mouthfeel is silky smooth and medium bodied with tastes of sticky caramel candy,soft toffee,xmas cake,brandy soaked raisins and finished with a nice sweet hit of butterscotch and overall its nice,malty and sweet and would the perfect compliment to a sweet dessert such as butterscotch pudding or creme brulee cheers."
"O: A balanced yet still malt-forward beer; great beer from Lagunitas"
"This one poured out as a deep brown color with some light tan colored suds on top. The lacing was light and just barely clings to the glass. The smell of the beer was slightly sweet with some malts and just a bit of hops in there too. The taste of the beer is malty upfront and leaves you with a nice tingling hop sensation in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth and has a good amount of body to it. Overall this beer, despite the WTF name it's actually a pretty good brew. I would drink it again."
"Overall. I have to admit, sweet and malty isn't usually my thing. This though, I'm really liking it. Clean and rich malts with a great amount of nice hops. It all just works with this one."
"O-Very good beer. Not the best of the style but for 3.99 for a 22 oz bomber you cannot go wrong. Great solid beer from a great brewery."
"It could be a brown, it could be a black IPA. No matter what you call it, it's impressive and delicious."
"For a brew designed for these tough times, WTF is exactly what we need right now - a flavorful pale ale with extra booze that isn't a chore to work through."
"Appearance has a dark ruby red color with a healthy thick head leaving fair lace. Smell of prunes with the rich malt, nill alchohol and mild hops. Taste of rich dark prunes and very mild alchohol makes it go down easy with the mild hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. considering the alchohol content this beer goes down way easy, very tasty and enjoyable."
"This pours a nice reddish/brown color with a good mocha head which has great retention. For the smell I get caramel / brown sugar / malty and a little alcohol. The body is medium. The taste is of caramel and toast malts with a bitter aftertaste and a little alcohol burn on the way down, overall the alcohol is pretty well hidden though."
"O- Drinkable. Not bad. Not memorable either. Only slightly boozy."
"IBU: 64.20"
"D: I liked this much better than when I had tried it fresh.  The aroma is warm, complex, and inviting (though somewhat misleading).  The flavor is good, but less impressive than the aroma would lead you to believe.  What is there, though, is pretty enjoyable.  A bit of heat toward the end that goes fairly well with the warmth of the aroma and flavor, however, is just a bit to strong for me.  A pretty well done brown. "
"This is truly a one of the best breweries for flavor, interest, variety and value."
"O- char is slightly aggressive but finish is nice. Over all it is not bad, drinkability is not amazing but overall it is a nice beer."
"O: Reasonably good drinking beer; I've had better, but that doesn't diminish this offering from Lagunitas. Plus, it went well with the pork chop. Yum!"
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I'm not sure how I'd classify it. It's too hoppy and not malty enough to be a brown ale so I guess American Strong Ale is a decent fit. Another solid offering by Lagunitas. If you can still find it, give it a shot."
"Overall a very nice ale from Lagunitas, definitely a regular return to beer."
"Overall, solid beer & for $4.49 a bomber - its one of the best brews/$$$ you could imagine."
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this brew quite a bit. I recommend this brew for sure."
"Neighbor bought a bottle of WTF down state to share...and it was tasty!!! The appearance was a rich amber, almost brown ale, clear, with a nice white head that laced throught the drink. The smell included hops and malt. The hops gave a slight piny scent that was quite nice. The taste was very good. Had nice malt character that fought to balance against the hops which helped provide a clean pallet at teh end of each drink. Mouthfeel was quite good and could session this one. absolutely worth a try!!!!"
"Overall, Not bad just not good."
"Overall WTF? Smells hoppy, taste not so much, says its around 7.8% and the alcohol is no where to be found, certainly a weird beer, cant say as im a fan but it was great to try"
"O: A nice flavored ale with a bitter finish, Foxtrot is pleasant to drink and is pretty balanced. It is not amazingly complex, but it is not simple either. It has wonderful appearance. It is certainly worth a try, though it might not be an every year buy."
"Pours a reddish brown in color beer with a white head that dissipated fast. i smelled some prunes, burnt caramel, brown sugar, some citrus. It tasted definitely slightly sweet at first with a bit of caramel and finished with a lemon juice that was not overally acidic. They make some great beers can't wait to taste more, specially for the price."
"TASTE: Starts boozy strong, not as sweet as the aroma - but perhaps that's because it hadn't opened up enough yet. Flavor drops a little after the big entry, yet remains impeccably balanced and leaves a long, lingering bitter hoppy aftertaste. It's not too bitter, just a nice flavorful continuation."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer. It fell a little on the sweet side for me though personally. Not a bad beer at all but not one of my favorites from Lagunitas. Pretty decent though overall."
"Sort of a style-bender here, but quite nice. Deep chestnut, a touch turbid. Assertive hops at the front, with a sturdy caramel malt undercurrent, leaning toward sweet. Strong ale seems a reasonable category, unless we want to talk about imperial browns and other hybridization fads."
"WTF tastes amazing too. Full malty toffee up front, then fruity, then a slight citrus. This is probably the most well balanced ale I've tried."
"Overall, I liked this beer a fair bit. The smell is the standout- if it could be fully replicated in the nose, this would be a remarkable beer! As it is, still very enjoyable. Remarkably balanced. I initially felt that the taste was a '4', but as things went on, I just didn't think it was quite up to that level."
"This is more complex than it seems. The balance of flavor is nicely done and gives a full flavored brew."
"Other much better offerings to try from Lagunitas."
"Was a good overall beer, just nothing that really stood out. Malt dominates this beer for sure, with a mild hop presence. Would gladly have another, but would also gladly order a bunch of different beers over this one."
"O: Smooth...complex...I like this one just to sip on...A great beer...full bodied, but not bitter..."
"Not much of a head to report on this one, less than a finger, but lovely color. Matches a 23 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is full and lots of aromas, with that of caramel, molasses, malt, coco, and lime. The taste is plenty of hops and mild sweetness with flavors of molasses, caramel, black coffee, vanilla, raisins, and lots of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but has a good smoothness and some creaminess, nice tingle on the back of my tongue. Good enough taste, and body to have a couple over a span of time."
"An interesting take in the American Strong Ale that veers a little into Black IPA territory and then swerves back. Definitely worth a try!"
"O. Overall, I'll definitely pick this one up. The aroma really impressed me and I love bready beers. Another good value from Lagunitas."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easy, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a well-rounded and fairly complex beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Overall: Can’t go wrong with a Lagunitus."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly because the taste is well balanced between the hops and malts and does not have any traces of alcohol."
"Don't know what it is about Lagunitas Brewing Co. But all there beer just taste so damn similar, reflecting flavors from previous batchs even styles of other beers they make. Maybe its the yeast strains they use, or the malts who knows. Bought this beer and you know it taste like a lagunitas, a lighter version of brown shugga if you will. If you want to have a lagunitas try there IPA and Brown Shugga and maybe there barlywine. Other then that they all taste the same! and I've had near 80% of all there beers."
"Mouthfeel - not bad, smooth, a bit puckeringt"
"O - Too sweet, no thanks."
"EDIT 28Sept11 - after trying again, I upped the taste a half point. It's odd, but certainly worthy."
"O- Nice offering, definitely above average and worth trying. Relatively complex and the sourness adds just that little something extra to it."
"Overall, this reminds me of a slightly less hoppy Arrogant Bastard. Not quite the beer that Arrogant bastard is, but extremely tasty, and for the price, its a keeper."
"D: Very pleasing brew again. I like this a lot more than the shutdown ale, more bitter, less barleywine ish. Great job!"
"M- medium-body, a little syrupy. Moderate carbonation."
"O- This beer is pretty unique and I really enjoyed it. It combines a lot of different tastes and styles, and if you have a chance to drink it, definitely do. This beer is nearly 8%, but you wouldn't know it."
"The taste was the same. It tastes like an evergreen bush. It covers up all the other flavour. I want to at least be warned if the hops are going to take over the flavour of a beer. This beer was described as ""malty and robust."" It was neither. It just tasted like hops. That's it. I love maltiness and was excited about this beer, but I can't taste anything under this intense leafy flavour. I'm so against misleading descriptions on a beer bottle. And this was the worst. Bleh. I wouldn't have bothered buying it and writing a poor review if I knew it would be a beer that I wouldn't enjoy. But the description made it sound like it was right up my alley."
"O (D) - a fine beer for sure. Not exactly what I like in an ""American Strong Ale"" but it's tasty and complex."
"This wasn't quite what I was after, but it did meet my expectations in terms of quality; I would have another, and enjoy how it stomped all over established beer styles and still exceeded my expectations."
"overall, this is a very tasty beer. I dont know quite how to classify it, but its complexity is what i enjoy. I would love to try this again, especially at this price."
"Dark, dirty buby brown with thin layer of tan film that floats around for a while with spotty, soapy lace. The aroma is of faint citrus, soapy floral notes on top of a rich caramel and toffee backbone with hints of polished leather. The taste is hop forward with citrus, grapefruit rind and a touch of lemon up front with notes of cocoa, roasted nuts, caramel and tofee in the back. A slight herbal aftertaste on this malty, bull bodied creamy drink. Juicy, fruity, and sweet with a nice hop presense up front and especially in the aroma. Full, rich, creamy body. Interestingly balanced tipping towards malt but with a good hop kick in the front."
"this beer pours a nice brownish red color with an off white head that recedes to a layer of patchy lace with time. the aroma brings a strong sweet malt with a bit of hops at the back. the sweet caramel taste of the malts is backed nicely by the rather impressive hop bitterness at the end. the full mouthfeel and good co2 make this a easy drinker, which should be expected with the rather low etoh."
"Pours deep brown in color, perhaps with some ruby highlights, and a nice brown head that settles very slowly. Aroma strikes me as resinous and sticky with some malt sweetness behind it. It switches a bit in the taste. Smooth bready, malty sweetness is up-front with sticky hops taking backseat. Hops are mostly apparent in the aftertaste. The beer is medium body and quite smooth (with the exception of aftertaste which leaves bitterness in your mouth). I find this beer a bit disjointed. It doesn't quite come together for me. As a side note, the beer does not have a ""freshness"" date, but I do recall picking it up in CA, so it gotta be around 1 year old."
"Overall / Drinkability: ""A Robust Malty Ale"" must mean robust in the hops, but the malts here do an outstanding job balancing out the hop whollop that this brewer typically puts out. Definitely hoppy, but the hops do a good job balancing it out, making it a beer worth sipping as well as knocking back. The name of the beer drew me in originally but this is a good beer worth revisiting again and it stands all on its own as a good beer."
"If I happen to see some bombers of this I'll be picking it up for cellaring experiments."
"O: Overall this comes across like a mashup between a red ale and an IPA. Not a bad attempt."
"M: Medium bodies with decent carbonation. Extremely smooth and pleasing."
"D: Surprisingly high for a 7.83%ABV beer, though, the perfect serving is the 22oz bomber it comes in."
"All around this beer was very surprising and well done. Loved the consistency of this beer. Some chocolate caramel and fruit up front and then the chocolate and almost a roast taste linger. Love the after taste. Went down way too easy. Shared this with a buddy of mine and we were both very impressed."
"O: If you like London Pride, and you like big flavor, I don't see how you can go wrong with this beer. I found a bomber for under $5 a Shep's on 4th, so I gave it a try, but I wasn't especially hopeful. This is the best beer I've had from Lagunitas - a brewery I consider to be, for the most part, 2nd tier. That's not a knock. I just don't think most of their brews belong up there with Stone, Cigar City, etc. This brew, however, would be a proud addition to any line up."
"a definite style bender. and definitley recommended."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and goes down fairly easily, and the drinkability is fairly good, although I doubt I'd have more than one bomber in a sitting. Overall, an interesting beer worth drinking, especially at the cheap Lagunitas pricing."
"D: A decent drinker overall."
"Overall I was a bit surprised by it. On the label it say "" A malty, Robust, Jobless Recovery Ale."" I kind of thought it might be a little more Porter-like but it reminds me much more of Arrogant Bastard with the dark ale and hoppiness blend. Although it was what I was expecting it was still a pleasant surprise. Full flavored, good balance, good abv. I'd recommend a try."
"Dark ruddy brown, maybe a bit coppery, with a healthy beige head. Overt citrus hop aroma betrays the flavor, which is a melting pot of different malt characteristics. One sip there's chocolate, another there's caramel, another there's bread, another there's nuts. Just a big jumble of a beer, but it works pretty well. The hops come through firmly in the flavor but it's not a perfect marriage with the malt profile. Maybe I'm just tired of citrus hops with crystal malts."
"O-Strange brew, but I like it. One of the few bombers I've bought multiple times. Give it a try."
"I had this while on vacation and probably won't have it again."
"Had this on draft at a place called Dive Bar and Grille in Wexford PA. Great beer, goes with whatever you are eating. Liked it so much I stopped by Wexford Beer and put in an order for a case. Enjoy boys, there is life beyond Miller Lite!!! Orginally started with a Dale's Pale Ale, which is good in it's own right. But the Launitas WTF hit the spot and left me wanting more."
"Over all very good, 7.8% WTF! Sitting on the rocks down at the harbour this beer happens to pair well with the pulled pork we are having. This is like an easy drinking barley wine with a fair helping of hops. Interesting and very tasty."
"I'm a big Lagunitas fan, but I was disappointed in this one."
"Pours a deep ruby brown, remains clear, has a good inch of foamy off white head. Light lacing. Nose is surprisingly robust with grassy hops, caramel malts, sweet. Taste is interesting; not overly special or standout, though hard to pin down. Full bodied, characters of a Brown and a Strong Ale. Malt forward on the palate with some hop bitterness but not much. Mouth feel is medium to light bodied, dry finish. Overall a great choice at this moment, as I was completely undecided what to have and this beer isn't even sure what it is/offers. Good balanced abv. and tasty strong brown notes."
"O: Quite pleasant and would definitely recommend picking up a bottle."
"Overall, this cluster fuck mystery brew is a knockout. Awesome flavors work together to produce a great profile."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. The carbonation is neither excessive nor lacking, but allows the flavors just the right amount of time on the tongue without being sticky."
"Overall, very tasty and highly quaffable."
"O - A nice strong ale, reminds me of a double IPA with a dark twist."
"Pours a lighty hazed walnut brown color, some red highlights. Nice cap of light khaki head, decent retention. Nose has some nice malt notes - lightly sweet, nutty, bready with hints of chocolate and a solid hop presence. Quite muddy and earthy. Taste leads with the solid malt profile as described above, hops come through with notes of pine and citrus, some dark fruit notes creep through, beer finishes muddy and earthy. Medium bodied, slightly grainy and husky feel. After drinking, was lead to believe that it was a hopped up brown ale, (very Surly Bender like without the oats)."
"O- Might be my favorite Lagunitas seasonal along with GnarleyWine. Malt bill is clearly complex & well thought out, & sweetness from malt is well balanced by hop bitterness. Hard to think of another brewery that does sweet beers this well & reliably at such a good price. Imperial Brown Ale really is the better description of this style than American Strong Ale."
"Note: Bottle says 7.8% abv, slight variation from the listed abv."
"O: This was a pretty good easy drinking beer I enjoyed it but will not be rushing to the beer store to buy the rest of them on the shelf"
"This bomber yields a beer that is a brilliant ruby-brown, kind of like a cherry wood table with a moderate clingy off-white head. The aroma is moderately malty--biscuit, caramel, a bit of a raisins mixed with all the malt is a burst of citrus hops in the background. The flavor starts with a burst of citrus and piny hops mixed with a bittersweet, caramel malts. The beer finishes slightly dry with a long lasting bittersweet hop flavor. The beer boasts a smooth medium-full body with medium-high perceived hop bitterness. Overall a very tasty, good looking beer. The flavor profile definitely tilts hops, which was a bit of a surprise given the nose, but I like it, kind of fitting given the name...where the hell are we going, up or down, hops or malt?"
"I like this beer. It's a touch heavy on the hops for my tastes, but that's just my taste. There's nothing terribly remarkable about it, and I do wish the flavor had some more complexity. But the balance really brings it home for me."
"O. A pretty decent beer overall. Not sure I'd go as far as to call it an American Strong Ale though. It's got a lot of characteristics that you'd find in an English Best Bitter, but more so, and the ABV is obviously higher. Worth buying again."
"D - WTF is malty, yes, but it packs a pretty nice hop punch for a Strong Ale (although I was under the impression that this was a hoppy brown ale). Either way, WTF?"
""
"A bit better than last year. Still, one was enough."
"THE overall is the fact that this is only $4 for a deuce deuce, you should try it. I bought it after searching for another beer to add to the cart and was happy I did. Lagunitas always comes thru."
"A classic Lagunitas beer-- big hops, big malt, big alcohol."
"Tastes somewhat like a Belgian Ale. There are plenty of sweet overtones, a floral hop aroma, and a bit of a hop bite, but with each sniff and taste I feel like I'm drinking a Dubbel. Perhaps the hops are confusing my palate. It's a very drinkable beer. Certainly different from the rest and I'll give Lagunitas lots of credit for that!"
"Mouth feel: Creamy, full bodied and decadent!"
"I can't quite give this one my highest recommendation, but certainly an interesting, somewhat different effort from one of my favorite breweries."
"Kinda cool when you really have little idea how a beer is gonna taste by the label and then bam it delivers the goods in the first sip. Tastes like a cross between and Imperial Red Ale and an old ale with that malty brown ale look and finish. Tons of hops but the malt is still the dominant flavour. Very drinkable and very original in concept. Need to buy some more of this while it lasts"
"Poured a mostly clear dark chestnut brown with a small whitish head. Roasty malts in the nose. Malty flavor with lots of nuttiness, some fruit, and backed up by an almost IPA bitterness. Heavy-medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable if you're into beers on the slightly strong/bitter side. Resembled a strong ale much more than a brown ale, which is why I liked it, I suppose."
"I intend to buy it again. I wish they made it all the time and I would like to get it in regular bottles."
"The mouthfeel is definitely thinner than I thought it would be. Seems like it should be thicker, but guess not. Not a lot of carbonation either, definitely a smooth beer that goes down pretty easy. Overall, this is a decent beer. Nothing overly impressive thought."
"Drink- Pretty damn good. Call it a strong ale, imperial brown, doesn't really matter. Well done and very tasty."
"This beer isn't bad but it isn't good either. I felt that the hairy eyeball was far more robust and malty than this. But, like the hairy eyeball, the more I drink it the more I like it. As the beer warms up it does get a more complex taste to it, much like a porter or a stout. I would recommend letting it sit outside the fridge for a little bit before really judging it. I probably won't get this beer again but it is certainly worth a try. If you like malty beers with undertones of hops than this is a good beer for you."
"I thoroughly recommend this on tap, but my review is for the bottle. Pick up the bottle as a good ""value"" beer."
"Overall - moderate drinkability. this beer is released in March and the flavors are perfect for the month. this is a good beer for either warm or cold weather as it has a warming, roasted flavor and a refreshing hop flavor. the ABV makes it's presence but it's pleasant and not overbearing."
"Even though the bitterness is quite perceptible, it falls just short harsh. If I could compare this beer to something, I'd almost say that this is a toned-down and muted version of Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous."
"O - A great ale by a fantastic company. I was pleasantly surprised by the WTF. I like it better than the Maximus. Might be my favorite Lagunitas."
"An enjoyable beer for sure. Appropriate that is sits as an American strong ale but if they steer this beer towards ipa or black ale territory it would be equally or more enjoyable."
"Overall -I'm a fan of this beer and usually enjoy when available. It's nice for most occasions and doesn't disappoint."
"An American Strong Ale that borders on being a moderate barley wine."
"Pours a dark copper color with a good white head and some spotty lacing. The nose is mildly sweet and also has a bit of a hop presence. Lightly flora, perhaps. The taste is moderately sweet and has some nice pine and floral hop characteristics. The body is medium with a touch of bitterness, but also some sweetness to balance. Good body; my favorite part of the beer. Pretty good overall. Nothing complex, but well made and has a nice feel."
"O - This beer and i will part and most likely never meet again, it was a good meeting it was just a bit boring. The beer is not bad, the beer is not good its just there in the crowd with its stupid name. i would not recommend this to many if any. Ill see you again Lagunitas WGW!!!"
"All in all not too bad. Nothing really stood out to me, good or bad. Definitely has a malty imbalance which is not necessarily a bad thing. Not Lagunitas best offering, but it is palatable."
"o - very good beer for the price ($4.49 at BevMo); limited release so I'd be interested to see what the next batch taste like"
"Not a bad beer. I don't know about another one."
"D: Not bad... I would track down other Lagunitas brews before this one. Nice balance, but the bitterness hangs on a little too long for me."
"The beer is transparent and dark amber, with a half inch of off-white head that leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a bit weak, with faint scents of sweet malt. The flavor is brings some light notes of toffee and caramels, with alcohol and sweet malt. The body is on the thin side. Overall, an ok beer. Worth a try, especially if you prefer sweeter, malt forward brews."
"O: Very drinkable beer over all. Very well balanced, no strong alcohol. Has a great Mouthfeel, Body and Flavor."
"Overall a very well balanced brown ale, it's no Palo Santo but for the price it's very enjoyable."
"Side note: I love the name. Took me a while to get the joke, but I should have figured it out quicker considering that it is subtitled ""A jobless recovery ale."""
"Rich coppery colour, with a nice white head. Very wierd scent: bread, toffee, cut grass and zesty citrus. Faint metallic hint to it. Wierd, sour bread taste with a definite citrus hop flavour to it. Weird, off-balanced sourness, not quite what I expected. The maltiness is somewhat suppressed and muddled, lurking in the background. Thin, somewhat watery. Too much carbonation, but it dies off quickly. Not a bad beer, but it needs some fine tuning."
"This is pretty tasty stuff. Not off the charts but drinkable and nicely balanced. Lagunitas is consistently good in my book and this one is another solid beer in their lineup."
"From a bomber. Appearance is awesome, dark with a coppery red hue and thin, refined head. A bit yeasty on the nose, but I dig it. Mouthfeel is mid to heavy with a carmely coating effect. Hops come through mid palate and through the finish, but balanced nicely. Once again, a solid offering from Lagunitas."
"A medium/full body with a tangy, medium effervescence up front. Slightly warming middle through finish. Hop note fades quite a bit, thankfully, in the aftertaste. Some malt almost makes it to the fore well into the aftertaste. By all my experience, this is an IPA, though a fairly dark one, not a strong ale. Scores reflect that. They would be quite a bit higher if this was labeled the IPA it so obviously resembles."
"This beer is a winner. I'll definitely grab another bottle next time I'm at the liquors store if they haven't sold out yet, as the label says it's a limited release. Was a good value compared to chugs from most other breweries. I mean, I'm not sure how it costs Sierra Nevada (or 3F's for that matter) $9 bucks to get a chug into a fans hands but Lagunitas can do it for $3.89...hmmm.."
"Medium bodied with some slightly smokey, sweet malt flavor balanced out by earthy bitter hops. Hints of rye, toffee and hazelnut along with some earthy pine needle and subtle citrus."
"Feels good... pretty damn drinkable for a relatively high abv beer. It's not the best beer ever, but still a tasty beer."
"O- Overall, this is a good solid beer. I enjoyed trying and reviewing it, especially after it warmed a smidge. Definitely worth trying for anybody who likes this style. Cheers."
"O - Great limited edition beer, very tasty and very similar to arrogant bastard but a little different, probably the closest to it I have tasted. Great beer, Lagunitas is my favorite... too many great beers and complex tastes. THUMBS UP!"
"I'm not a huge fan, but Lagunitas is hoppier than I tend to prefer."
"The bitter hops took some getting used to but in the end I enjoyed the complexity of the beer"
"I'm glad I tried this one, but I won't necessarily seek it out again."
"O: Far from my favourite strong ale. 3.5"
"Lagunitas"
"M/O/D- overall pleasant... carbonation is overall moderate which helps the sweetness pull through what little it does though... i would say this is a medium bodied that is not oily or sticky as i was assuming it was going to be. Being an imperial ""brown"" ale i was thinking the ABv was going to render this one boozy. It drinks suprisingly well. if they could have mirrored the taste with the smell, this would be an top 20 beer IMO. That being said it was very much enjoyable"
"I had this on tap but didn't take notes. What I do remember is that it tasted better, but I had a few beers before that I may have been beer-goggling the taste. But most beers taste better off the tap and this one seemed to have better balance in the taste when I first had it. The tangerine flavor had not left in the harsh light of morning. I felt no need to chew my arm off. Still, the bottled version is pretty good and carries the aroma that I remembered and still pine for."
"Nicely drinkable in spite of it's strength, with an excellent balance of malt, bitter, fruit, and hops. I recommend this beer."
"Not a must have, but not terrible."
"D: Flavorful hop and malt characters. Dry."
"Medium-full body with a post modern west coast balanced finish (that means you can actually taste malt along side the hops)."
"O: keep these coming. Great beer"
"O-Not bad. Not very distinctive, though. Could've confused this with a dozen or so other beers."
"Pours a clear dark mahogany wood like color with browns and reds present very pretty with a off white one finger head which recedes to skim and leaves okay lacing on the glass. The aroma is of floral hops and a slight citrus smell, there is a nice sweet smell almost like bubblegum and dark fruits. The taste has a nice sweet backbone, caramel malts and dark fruits present with hints of citrus hops at the end for a slight bite. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. The abv is well hidden. Overall very solid the smell and appearance are top notch and make you want the beer from the start. The taste comes through with a nice big sweet taste that is balanced out at the end with a slight hop bite. Ver solid, easily a session beer dispite the high abv."
"Overall, this beer is nice. Not thrilling, but nice. If you're looking for something that's hoppy, but not too hoppy, or malty, but not too malty, this beer fits."
"O- its a tasty strong brown ale a tad sweet but the nice hop profile made that up for me..will have on tap again but not from the bomber"
"O: This is very drinkable - even quaffable - and I'll probably seek this out again in the future."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer that I enjoyed drinking and sharing with my brother. Both the malts and the hops had bold flavors but they were balanced nicely so neither of them was overpowering. I don't have much experience with American Strong Ales, but this didn't seem too strong and was quite drinkable. I would buy this beer again and I recommend it to anyone who likes Lagunitas other brews. Another good beer from Lagunitas, you guys have yet to let me down. My favorite brewery from CA."
"Overall, a very good beer. It's nothing terribly exciting, but still enjoyable and the price point is great."
"Overall, a nice ale that does as advertised ""...Malty, Robust..."""
"Final thought - Love how all Lagunitas, always charges $4.50 for all of there 22oz. Nice beer that is nice on the wallet"
"O: I like a lot of the beers Lagunitas offers, but this one doesn't measure up. I think I'd like it better if it had more crystal malts. All I'm getting is a thin beer that seems too bitter for whatever style it's trying to be. This is disappointment coming from the same brewery that produces Brown Shugga and the Sumthin' series."
"O: I liked this one. It's halfway to a big beer, making it not quite as strong as some others of it's ilk yet no wimp, either. It reminds me more of a strong pale ale that's been stained dark and confused with brown sugar into thinking it's a strong dark ale. Kinda like when a prize fighter moves up in weight class for a challenge it isn't currently getting. This is a dark beer for people that don't like darks and is completely drinkable in the warm spring and summer months."
"Well balanced taste that hinted at a brewery at the top of it's game. It was fresh and full of quality ingredients. Loads of caramel-sweet malts worked well along an undefined west coast hop. Clean and irresistible, I quickly polished off all 22 oz. myself."
"O: Nicely done, alcohol is well hidden and can sneak up on you."
"On tap. Pours a dark mahogany color with a thin head. Tons of lacing. Smells awesome. Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Citrusy. Taste is more of that classic Lagunitas hoppiness. Citrus flavor and nicely bitter. Sweet and bitter aftertaste. This is another great beer from Lagunitas. Has that signature citrus hop flavor that alot of their beers have. Overall this beer is really tasty, easy to drink and worth seeking out."
"This is a nice beer for a cool early spring evening. It has just enough heft for the night."
"This isn't bad beer, but I certainly won't be picking it up again, and would probably hold off on recommending it if there are other options."
"O/d- I could see polishing this bottle happening don't know if I would want 2 bombers in the same night though"
"O: Interesting brew. Mildly everything. Like a red, brown, pale ale. Pretty enjoyable but sharing the bomber was enough for me."
"Overall-Nice change of pace, a little nutty, a little hoppy. I can enjoy almost any Lagunitas product knowing i'm not going to break the bank."
"WTF's flavors are at odds with each other, never combining into cohesive whole. It's enjoyable, I guess, as a strong beer - good for getting you drunk. But deep contemplation of its flavors will just leave you confused."
"O - Not altogether too bad. At first it seemed rather well balanced but it fell apart a little towards the end. Never did get an overly ""alcoholy"" taste nor did it seem too warm. With all that said, I've YET to find anything by Lagunitas that isn't a good product. This one isn't one of my favorite offering from Lagunitas, but it still buries so many other beers out there."
"EDIT- I edited my review to show that I didn't edit anything."
"overall, lagunitas further cements their place in my book as one the five best bang-for-the-buck beers out there today."
"overall a great value from a really quality craft brewer at 7+abv. I'll be buying more."
"Overall: Tasty and reasonably quaffable throughout for all its sweetness and slightly bumped up alcohol presence."
"O--WTF? There is nothing more to say--a very good brew that defies style (something Lagunitas excels at)!"
"I was expecting a bigger profile of this beer for this category and it didn't quite deliver. Overall this is sort of an in between Amber and then Strong Ale with a kind of training wheels Strong Ale profile. I could see this an introductory style beer for this style, but I guess I like them bolder. Easy drinking got to admit though."
"Taste more like an American brown to me, but regardless, another solid contribution from this terrific brewer."
"O- Really a different tasting beer, never had anything quite like it. Overall all its good and nice to have something refreshing."
"LAGUNITAS: Keep It Comin."
"Lagunitas Brewing Company	WILCO TANGO FOXTROT--A Malty, Robust, Jobless Recovery Ale!--We're not quite in the Red, or in the Black--Does that mean we're in the Brown?!--2011 22 oz. Bottle. 7.80% ABV. 64.2 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Foamy dense lacy lasting 3/4 inch off white light tan head. Clear dark amber brown color. Soft chocolate nut Signature Lagunitas hop mild floral front. Mellow creamy smooth mild sweet soft toffee caramel malty rich Brown Ale mild nut fruit dark malt body. Tangy mildly hot balanced spicy bitter hop end. Rich robust fully fermented Imperial Brown Ale. Rich and malty hoppy but not too thick. Sampled 3/18/2011. Purchased fro $5.49 at The Ballard Market, Seattle on 3/18/2011."
"Overall: This is a very solid beer. A hoppy, strong brown ale, but well balanced."
"Moderate carbonation with medium to medium-low body. Not too thin, but quaffable. Very drinkable for the relatively high ABV. Nice job to Lagunitas for a nice job on a relatively affordable bomber!"
"Wasn't sure what to expect, was a nice clear red amber color with a small slightly off white head that dissipated quickly down to a light froth covering. A really hoppy smell with a twinge of citrus aroma. Tasted refreshing going in, some malts, biscuit, and suprisingly a very small amount of hops- despite the smell- must have been dry hopped. This was a pretty good beer."
"All in all, ok this is not a good first representation of this brewery. This should not be labeled in this style as this does not have any similarities to other strong ales. Ok, but much better brews are out there for your money."
"D - After a 22oz. I was not really yearning for more."
"Much of everyhting in this one, complex and demanding."
"O - Enjoyable beer with higher hop character then expected"
"A pleasantly drinkable beer. I honestly expected a bit more based on what people had told me, but it was still something worth having."
"Poured into a glass from a bomber. Nice copper tones with a mainly brown body. Smells of hops and a strong malt sweetness, smells kind of like a barleywine. Taste is sweet upfront with a balanced bitter hop element to round things out. A little too much carbonation for my taste. Overall another great beer from a great brewery."
"This pours dark copper with a khaki head, two fingers, with some lace. On the nose there are caramel and strangely enough, copper notes to go along with pine cones. I wasn't getting much citrus from this, and if there were any fruits, they were of the darker variety. In the mouth the caramel flavor predominates at first, but there is a pretty big hop presence that hangs out further back on the tongue. The body is medium full but the finish isn't especially long. This 22 oz went away awful quickly for me. I like this beer, sort of a misfit but a good misfit."
"Overall: Nice balance of hops and malts, and a very good example of a maltier American Strong Ale. Of course, being Lagunitas, they did not go light on the hops either. Tasty and well recommended."
"D - This is a drinkable, really good beer, especially for the money, just not super exciting. Worth a try for sure though."
"overall a good effort from lagunitas as usual. i enjoyed this one and will likely be going back for more."
"D - Easy enough to drink and decently tasty, just wasn't overly 'exciting'. Good balance."
"The taste isn't as sweet as I expected. The hoppy bitterness seems to overshadow the sweetness that was in the nose, but the sweetness hangs in the balance. The sweetness comes out with a certain fruitiness as the drinking continues. It's kind of medium in the mouth with good carbonation. I think this is a fairly drinkable beer."
"T: Roasted malts, caramel and a hard pine hop finish. Interesting beer. I don't know if I'd go for it again really soon, but I'm glad I tried it."
" My notes remind me that this beer was very well balanced. I would buy this again."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. I am happy with how it turned out for what it is and all that. If you are going to do a beer that was trying to represent what they were going for, doing an ""Imperial brown"" to ""strong ale""...whatever you want to call it...with the Americanized blend of hops makes it perfect and to the point. I am enjoying the beer and would recommend it."
"good mouthfeel, moderate carbonate and creamy head. easy to drink."
"WTF!? I don't give a Schlitz for this."
"D- Another nice drinking limited release from Lagunitas. I haven't had a bad beer from them yet, always reliable!"
"D: From what my notes say it looks like I really enjoyed this beer, and from what I can remember I believe this to be true. Tasted like a slightly malt forward DIPA. Maybe I'll pick one up this year."
"Served in: Tulip"
"Hooo boy this one's a beaut. Into a Dulip a dark murky amber with a big tan head that slowly recedes with great lacing. Leaves that nice mound at the end. Strong smell of caramel and dark dried fruits. Taste is the same with good balancing hops with a nice dry finish. Full-bodied with enough carbonation to keep it...not cloying. It's great. Good beer. Not bad for a five buck bomber."
"I wasn't sure what to think of this beer when I first started off. I ended up liking this beer but it wasn't anything amazing. I like Lagunitas but there are other beers I'd buy from them before I bought this one again."
"Bottle from the cellar, pours crystal clear ruby-amber color, off white head. Aromas of chocolate cherries, sweet maltiness, dates and prunes. Tastes of complexity, not as sweet as it smells, chocolate, cherry, floral and spicy hops, chewy bread with a lighter mouthfeel. The hops are still strong on the nose, slight hop bitterness on the palate. Carbonation is good, this beer is better than i thought it would be. Really complex and light, glad I have a few more aged to sample."
"22 oz bomber from Roths, Sunnyside Market, Salem Nice dark amber/reddish ale with a good tan head. Plenty lace to go around. Strong aromas, of caramel, ,toasted biscuit malts and a good spicy ,peppery hop. Taste is pretty much the same with a emphasis on the chewy,robust toffeeish malts, the hops balance it out so it isnt really a sweet beer and take over a bit at the end. Great mouthfeel on this, very luxuriant. Overall yet another solid offering from lagunitas..more malt driven than their usual."
"I wish I had gotten more that the last few ounces of this keg. Not quite what I expected for a Strong Ale, but very enjoyable."
"D - Holy crap, I practically chugged this brew... unintentionally. Seriously, a 22 oz bottle and then I suddenly realized with only a quarter of this review finished that only had a few ounces left. This is a fantastic quaffable beer. It's not too often that I feel as sad that as I am that this is a limited edition - potentially because it is local and I have found it on tap. I hope it will at least last through the recession."
"Served from a 22oz bomber. Beer pours very smoothly, with a dark-copper color, and an extremely dense yet light head. Head came to about 1/2"" in a beer mug. There is an aroma of oak and malt that is light, and the lightness is actually very pleasant. The initial tastes are malt and caramel, with a sour/bitter undertone. The bitterness is residual through the aftertaste, and also balances well with the rest of the beer. The beer is very smooth and light in mouth, and leaves a light film/residue. For a strong ale, it is extremely easy to drink, and I would absolutely purchase this beer again. I'd be very intrigued to taste it on draught..."
"D: Very good imperial brown ale that I wouldn't mind drinking on a regular basis with a steak dinner."
"This is an easy drinking well balanced beer. However, it's got a bit of a 'twang' to it that I seem to find in all Lagunitas beers."
"Taste: Even though it smelled like there would be a bitterness (similar to a coffee), there was surprisingly little. It has a slight bitterness in the beginning that fades quickly. There is not a lot of sweetness and the roasted taste remains but without that bite. Pretty good flavor but it lacks anything complex."
"Drinkability: flavor wise this one was quite nice, but the crispness brings this one down a notch."
"D: A solid beer if you ask me. I had it on draft a few months back and it seemed a little better. Worth a shot considering the price of Lagunitas bombers are lower comparatively"
"Notes: A well put together beer. Cheers."
"The interest gained from the dark malt character balances out the fact that the hops are being purely cleanly supported by the malt. This is a really easy drinking beer given the strength of this brew and a 22oz bottle is dangerously quaffable."
"Drink - A fantastic beer that I would be happy to drink again."
"3.5 D: The smell is great, but everything else is just alright. Lagunitas makes some great stuff and this is a decent addition to their lineup."
"D: This was quite an interesting brown ale - very malty, yet with a gracious note of hops throughout. I will try it again, fo' sho'!"
"Pours a thick three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a chunky lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Clear very dark amber color. Nose is strong hops and malt. Flavor has a lot of hops but there is a lot of malt - balanced. Decent imp brown. $4.49 for a 22oz bottle from Liquorama Upland, CA."
"D- About halfway through really started to grow on me. I really like stouts and strong beers so I felt right at home. Oddly I'm not a big fan of too much hops, and it had just a bit too much for me. Probably not something I would drink more than a pint or two of comfortably."
"Drinkability - This is a good beer, but it's very heavy and hoppy. Which can be a bad mixture for some. It takes a while to go down. By time you finish the bomber, it will more than likely be warm. Had this on tap as well once though, amazing if you can find a place that serves it."
"I'm not the biggest fan of brown ales, this one's a big brown ale with a little more hop character than most browns, but not really enough to make me say wow. Worth a try."
"Very nice drinking beer overall. Good flavours, good balance."
"M/D - Full, dry and sticky mouthfeel. A hybrid brown ale and IPA? Whatever it is, I approve."
"Very drinkable for a strong ale. I would have this again."
"O: Solid beer, but nothing special."
"It's really nice; if it were slightly hoppier I'd say it was a classic example of a really well-made black IPA, but as it is, it's just a strong, lightly roasted American ale: one that's hard to categorise beyond that."
"Easy drinking, pleasant beer. Worth trying."
"D- I like it a lot and I should have go more than one"
"Pours dark brown in body with off-white froth laying on top. Malty in the nose, spices, molasses, sugar, hops, and slight earth. Huge malt in taste: sugars, molasses, gingerbread, cinnamon, spices, slight pie crust, maple, and some earth and hop bitterness comes through towards the finish. Heavy in body with a slick mouthfeel. Imperial brown is a nice name for this one. A thick malt bomb of a brew that is worth trying and enjoying."
"Drinkability: Pretty decent and different offering from Lagunitas. I dig the subtle background flavors and the higher alcohol really doesn't detract from the drinkability, although don't confuse this with a more classic brown."
"D - WTF? I was expecting more hops coming from Lagunitas...This is an imperial brown ale...I like my strong ales with more hops throughout the palate...a decent, lower ABV beer that should be enjoyed just for the name"
"Another well balanced and highly drinkable beer from Lagunitas"
"Beer poured brown with a nice long lasting head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose resembles a barleywine, sweet malts abound with a nice citrus aroma lurking in the background. Taste is pretty similar, sweet malts combined with resiny citrus hops make for a tasty treat. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and pretty smooth. Drinkability is good. Another tasty brew from Lagunitas!"
"Taste: Pretty sweet up front with molasses, toffee and brown sugar flavors balanced by grapefruit bitterness. Maple candy and syrup, a hint of ripe fruits along with a pinch of spicy phenolics in the middle. Phenolics emerge with warming as well as some alcohol. Bitterness sharpens a bit and yeastiness comes through. Finish continues the sharpish grapefruit peel bitterness with a grassy, herbal edge. There are some ripe plums that are slightly sweet and some spicy, yeasty notes that are distinguishing."
"Conclusion: Nice to get to try it once, but generally I like my American Strong Ales more towards the malty than the hoppy, or at least balanced. I guess I was expecting more of an ""Imperial Nut Brown"" kinda vibe outa this one..."
"D: Overall I have not been a big fan of lagunitas line up, but this beer seems like it has a nice balance, and to totally drinkable. I would buy it again, and this it would be great super fresh."
"Double U Tee Eff Mang"
"It pours deep red, almost brown, with a vast white head. The aroma begins grapefruity, but then comes up malt, with a cherry-ish, roasted edge. The flavor is sweet and quite malty, with cherry, plum, and that ever present layer of citrusy hops. The bitterness is surprisingly muted, way back in the mouth and seemingly light, though if you dig for it, you will find a boozy burn back there. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and a bit sticky."
"Again not bad but not searching this out."
"Drinkability - very drinkable for an American Strong Ale with an ABV over 7%. But IMO had a less than desirable finish which would hold me back from having this again."
"Nice heavy head off the pour. Lacing is prevalent from start to finish. Good malt flavor with limited hops. Best features include mouthfeel, smoothness and delicate taste (alcohol is well-hidden). Drawbacks are lack of aroma and robust flavor for a strong ale."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale and crystal malt scent along with some dry, roasted malts and a bit of bitter hops. The taste is decent. It has a stiff bitterness up front with a solid malt base and a dry roasted finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an easy drinker, especially for a strong ale. It's seems more like an American brown to me."
"This one's very drinkable aside from a high ABV, though the alcohol is well masked in this brew."
"My first Lagunitas and I'm not too impressed. I wouldn't get this again but it was OK once. On the plus side the dog on the label was kinda cool."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly high for such a big beer. The whole bomber went down easier than other Laguinitas' offerings; this is a bold, yet approachable, beer."
"The drinkability is good, but you can feel the booze take affect rather quickly. I would rather have this beer in a cheese paring to stretch out the flavors and give it some longevity in a session. Touche Lagunitas!"
"What else could you expect from a Lag Brown Ale?"
"D: Quite drinkable, though the ABV's a bit high to have too much."
"A little syrupy as well as warm for texture, but still very good and worth trying and picking up again."
"D: Higher than average ABV, thus, not quite a session ale, but a pretty decent beer overall. Something I would try again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it since it didn't have that ""Ah ha!"" appeal or the light bulb appearing over my head."
"Wilco Tango Foxtrot is billed as 'A Malty, Robust, Jobless Recovery Ale'. The first two are true and the third is both moronic and oxymoronic. Since the brewery is being ironic and poking fun, I'll let it slide. Given what's going on in this country these days, I feel like drinking half a dozen bombers of Wilco Tango Foxtrot daily."
"Not sure I'd seek it out again, but it's worth a try."
"D- This was a clean and easy drinking beer. The malts toward the end of the beer were just getting a little annoying to me. I was glad to have this beer and share it with someone who is just getting in the world of craft. This was almost a one and done for me though."
"This beer is a pleasure to drink, very satisfying all around. I would seek this one out...very good!"
"Delicious. Well worth the $6 Canadian that I paid for it."
"A good American Strong!"
"Pours a dark, reddish-brown color with a pale, off-whit color head that looks very nice. I smell some unique malts along with some very different herbs and spices. I also get a very strange scent of meat. Initially, I get some very sweet malts with some molasses. Some smokiness and some woody flavors follow, ending with a smooth hop bitterness. The alcohol is also present as this beer warms up a bit. Very tasty as the flavors adapt to your palate and your mouth gets used to it. The mouthfeel is very nice. Very full-bodied and also very drinkable. I will have no problem whatsoever polishing off this bomber."
"D - this is just an amazing beverage. The rich malts balance perfectly with the sweet and spicy flavours. Rich, bubbly, and bitter feels all work. You would never guess it is a higher ABV at 7.83%. I could drink this all day!"
"The taste resembles the smell--starts with a mildly sweet malt flavor and then slips into a strong hop finish; leaves a long aftertaste. Rich body with a good level of carbonation. Some alcohol warmth in the swallow."
"A relatively drinkable beer, from a great brewery. This is my second time having this beer, and would defintiely go for a third!"
"Overall I think this is a really good beer. The label is funny as hell in a political way. Nice job, Lagunitas."
"unique beer with no doubt, nice flavors from the hops and lots of malt character. WTF came to mind once or twice while drinking it and I rather like being confused while sipping a brew"
"D: WTF in bottle is really not bad, but in this method of cask serving I would never order another. Lagunitas might want to check out the casks on warm days out there. This was the ONLY bad beer we had at the brewery, though!"
"Full disclosure: I have a pet peeve of citrus hops in dark beers. If that's your thing then perhaps this beer is better suited you."
"Sinkability - I think this is the first ASA that I've dumped, and this from a well-regarded brewery. Oh the shame of it."
"Drinkability: This falls outside the universe of either brown ales or strong ales. It is more of a sipper than a brown ale, but less boozy than most strong ales. A nice little offering from Lagunitas."
"I think the bottle will be enough for me though, this would be an easy food pairing beer rather than a heavy drinking beer."
"D: Lagunitas is one brewery that has never left me disappointed (at least not in the products I've been fortunate enough to try), and WTF is no exception."
"d-fairly drinkable, but the maltiness would probably get to me."
"Would be dangerous on tap in good company. You would probably drink more than is warranted."
"This one was a pleasant surprise with its high drinkability and pleasantly balanced taste. Lagunitas should be saluted for brewing such reasonably priced, high quality ales."
"D - This is one delicious beer, and the high ABV goes nearly unnoticed! Goes down dangerously smooth and the balance between the hops and malts is finely tuned to make for the perfect taste and finish."
"D: Not being a lover of brown ale, i think it's rather drinkable given the style and adv."
"Dark brown brew turns dark cherry red against a light. Frothy tan head settles from 1.5"" to a stable 1/4"" layer and leaves a bunch of sticky bubbly lace behind. Hugely aromatic, massive thick roasted malt body, candy sugar, there's a ton going on in here, just about everything... citrus, berries, dark fruits, banana, pine, grass, earthy tones, oak, spices, etc. Amazing. Taste starts with a good pine and lemon rind hop bite, then thick roasted malts and brown sugar, clove, licorice, some fruity esters, then finishes with grapefruit, pine, burnt sugar, and a healthy alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, thick and smooth, finishes with a dry hop bite. Quite filling and very enjoyable."
"Really great flavors."
"Poured this into a pint glass. Musky brown color with about a finger of off white head. Lots of carbonation bubble sticking to the side of the glass. I smell lots of grain in this. Reminds me of horse feed actually. After that I get a little bit of cocoa a bit of nuttiness. I get some nuttiness and bitter hops in the taste. Something in there is actually really bitter. Rich malts finish on the pallet. Mouth fell is good; I love all those crazy bubbles! And for the abv this drinks nicely."
"Overall this is a nicely well done beer, and while I very much enjoyed the flavors, I would like to have seen them be a bit more prominent. And I do wish the mouthfeel was a bit heavier and long-lasting."
"Flavor is pleasantly better than I expected. Robust, malty, sharp. Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is medium, a decent drinker. Flavors of malts, hops, burnt tobacco, vanilla. Interestingly, for a medium ABV, there's a decent heat/burn from this beer. Overall though, a nice beer!"
"D: A pretty good beer from Lagunitas. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it after the first few sips, but it certainly grew on me."
"D-pretty tasty and quite an interesting balance between big hop profile and a nice malt base. a little thin on body and the flavor falls off in the back slightly as well but still a good beer."
"D: All around, a pretty weird ale. Maybe my impression or the bottle or something, but I didn't find this brew to be balanced at all, or even in the realm of a brown ale, for that matter. The 7.83 % ABV isn't really masked, as the brew tastes a little hot. Could just be the aggressive hop profile also. Not a bad ale, just not what I was hoping for. I'd get another bottle just to see if my palate changed for it."
"This is a good beer, but it's a little deceptive regarding it's maltiness as labeled. I probably wouldn't buy this again. Lagunitas make better beers, but this is still better than a lot of others considering the nice price point."
"For a strong, smooth, and tasty brown ale, this hits the spot."
"A malty, nicely hopped american ale that satisfies. A nice job, I am liking it. At 7.8%, I want another bottle but that means I have to drag my butt to the store. It's a jobless recovery ale, and priced at $4.49 a bottle at Bevmo, I am buying a case."
"Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot is a clear brown ale with a bunch of sea monkeys in it. It's topped with a thick, fluffy, frothy, mocha colored head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a piny-- almost sprucy-- aroma with notes of roast and chocolate. It has a pretty full body that's very smooth with a slick finish. Pine, citrus, roast and chocolate combine to make a nice, full flavor. It has a long, bitter, resiny finish. This is a bold brown ale that is very distinctly from the Western US. Great stuff."
"Dark golden body with a lot of white foamy head that leaves sticky thick lace. Overshadowing appearance and experience were several black dots appearing from the bottle - dirt? I fished them out and continued into a good IPA experience. A nice balanced juicy hoppy beer."
"Pours a nice clean/clear brown color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some big islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, very slight hop bite, and a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, another very tasty brew from Lagunitas, well done."
"D - This is a great tasting beer. Lagunitas knocked another one out of the park."
"pretty drinkable, though you're probably not going to put back more than a couple bombers. a nice brown-type ale to finish up with after a couple summer seasonals."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer by Lagunitas, could definitely drink more of this (and it is a very affordable beer to boot!)."
"Poured a deep red/brown, nice and clear, with a decently formed light maplewood head. I get a large dose of citrusy and grassy hops in the nose, not what I expected from a ""robust, malty"" beer, but ok, it smells good. Sweet caramel, currants, and candy with a faint cocoa finish. Decently hoppy as well with a healthy dose of grapefruit and bitters. Could use a tiny bit more carbonation. Not bad though. WTF, mate!"
"D - Couldn't do more than one of these. Not my preferred style of beer but I did enjoy it. If I didn't know any better, I would classify this as a hopped up American style Brown Ale."
"D-I have never met a Lagunitas beer that I did not like, but I prefer the malt forward versions of their brews. That said, this is a very nice one off, definately worth a try, but probably not a ""must have"" buy it again keeper like Mondo 13."
"D- Definitely hop forward for a brown ale; I would have like to have a little bit more malt presence and a little more sweetness. Still a good beer overall though."
"Full mouthfeel, finishes a little puckery, but this is a tasty beer and I could wreck several bombers in a sitting."
"Some good flavors in spots; however, nothing too exciting. For the most part, a pretty bland offering; nothing all that memorable."
"D- If you like American strong beer, this is a pretty good example to have. It's just barely over the 7% mark, so with some practice you should be able to kill more than a pint in a night."
"D - I dunno. Good. But, big drinkability?"
"I'm enjoying the hops in this, however it doesn't really deliver on the malt promised on the label, or the robustness. Enjoyable, but I'd rather have a Lucky 13 for bang for the buck."
"overall another solid beer from these guys....hope to see many more"
"D: Like a hopped up brown ale. Pretty interesting beer I would buy this one again."
"Even though the only thing that I am recovering from is a mild, but annoyingly debilitating common cold, I appreciate the assault on the funny bone/current events/strong beer jonesin' fronts. A nicely balanced big boy beer from the usual Yankee suspects on this side of the northern border."
"D: A very flavorful beer offering an excellent balance of malt and hops. And quite the bargain at less than $5 a bomber."
"Notes: Another solid offering from Lagunitas. It is not my favorite from their seasonal brews to date, I believe they can and do much better than this. But this remains solid, tasty and rather pleasing with a distinct Lagunitas profile."
"D-At 7.83% ABV (the only brewer I have noticed showing two digits right of the decimal) is very well masked. I don't notice it in the taste. Very drinkable. A very good, but not great beer. Not quite on par with Hop Stoopid or Lucky 13 Mondo, but a good value at over a $1 less than most other bombers."
"drinkability is good it's big and robust, but keeps itself it in check at all the right times. very good."
"Very solid and drinkable, another winner from Lagunatis."
"[No points docked for this, of course, but what an incredibly silly name...acronym or no...]"
"Notes: I am a huge fan of Wilco and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (the album) but this beer leaves a lot for me to desire. Namely, a beer that meets the description on the front of the label would have been nice. I will stick to my Hairy Eyeball, Brown Shugga' and the great ""We're only in it for the money"" from Lagunitas."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice beer, that despite its heavy malt presence, still managed to confound and please. Drinks well for nearly 8%. I'll also applaud Lagunitas for again brewing another solid, affordable beer."
"D - Very enjoyable, not too overwhelming and can be enjoyed in greater quantities than most American Strongs."
"Pours a darkish hearty brown with lace patches on a fat head and has a sweet caramel malt aroma along with some roasted malt smells and tea-like hops. Chewy, malty, very bready, some sticky sweet caramel along with dark cocoa and coffee. Has a dry, crisp finish thanks to carbonation and hops as well as a hint of spice (nutmeg??). Another quality Lagunitas brew that is worth trying."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. I swear it's a brown ale even though it's labeled differently. Either way I will be picking up a few more bombers of this."
"Excellent aftertaste, great bear, great taste, great price. Lagunitas rocks!"
"Overall, not the best I've had, but worth trying."
"good drinkable but I had to order water to finish my second one because of the dryness limping my tongue. other that a fine beer"
"Drinks very easy, a bit of a restrained offering from these guys, but the lack of hops works for me, nice to see them expand their range a bit"
"For the price, this is one of the really good finds for me this year."
"Bought a bomber of this after a long day, Lagunitas has yet to let me down. Pours a nice dark brown, nice fluffy head to it.. nice looking beer. Nice floral hop aroma to it. Taste is medium bodied, huge malty backbone to it and pretty sweet. Hops come through mid swallow, add a very nice touch to the beer. Hint of alcohol as well, as this is a stronger beer but it adds a good touch. A nice version of a strong ale, sweet and good tasting, different.. way too drinkable and goes down smooth. For $3.99? you can't go wrong."
"Pours a clear, amber color on top and a clear, dark gold along the bottom of the glass. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong floral hops, slight roasted malt, dark citrus, slight orange, slight sweet malt, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, floral hops, slight citrus, slight sweet malt, and some herbal/spiciness. Overall, a great aroma, good blend, and good body."
"22oz bottle into a tulip glass pours a crisp dark copper with a nice lasting thin off white head. Aroma is burnt caramel in front of pine hops. The taste is an interesting blend of caramel and brown malts with a nice Earthy hop backbone that leaves a nice bitter finish. The beer is on the light side medium with well hidden alcohol and smooth carbonation. This is a very enjoyable and unique beer that I would certainly have again."
"D - I'm on the fence with this one I like it but I'm not loving it it has a good taste I guess I'm just not in the right mood for this right now but its a good beer thats worth picking up to try"
"Taste: The malt is dominant in this one. The roasted malt hits upfront and then gives way to some of the pineapple character and mellows with a pine finish."
"WTF, this IS a great beer! Poured with a lovely tan foamy frothy head that soon settles down a bit and some lace. Color is a nice clear red brown. Aroma is fresh beer hop roast malt. Flavor is like aroma with sweetness standing out. Very good body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and has sweetness changing to a tapering bitter and then malted grain of some length. Very well done. Session beer."
"D: Very good American Strong Ale. I will have to go back to Arrogant Bastard after trying this one and enjoying it so much. It won't be long until this bomber is gone."
"Not heavy at all, I've felt more weight on a Pale Ale than WTF. About as easy as you'll get for a 7% and while I shouldn't I feel like I could plow through a few of these."
"This had a lot of barley-wine like qualities (esp. hops, heavy sweet malts) without the alcohol bite. Overall, it was a pretty good brew and like most Lagunitas brews, good value for price. Went down very easily."
"Delicious beer that is enhanced with a generous amount of hops."
"Pours mahogany colored with a large head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is not overwhelming to say the least, but I detect some hoppy smells such as pine and citrus. Also a little metallic. Good flavored but I was expecting something bigger. Some sweet malt, piney hops, and a slight solvent taste in the finish. Good but not really that impressive. The body is not big but is saved by a wonderful carbonation. Soft and silky in texture. The label is a bit misleading, but still a nicely crafted beer that is worth a visit."
"A very tasty strong ale. Big, but surprisingly balanced. The hops come on strong, but the caramel malt is up to the challenge. An interesting and flavorful experience."
"Pretty good stuff overall. Tasty, if all over the place. Nice value at sub-$4."
"D - honestly, I picked this up for the bottle and name. has a bit going well for it, just cant seem to get over the top of being decent at best. alcohol is quite hidden and the flavors are light enough to keep is drinkable without being overwhelming."
"D - Pretty drinkable. The abv is well hidden and does not feel like it is almost 8% at all. I finished the bomber easily but would not dare taking on another. Good stuff from Lagunitas as always. Can't go wrong with this for the price, hell I would have been ok paying more for the quality of this brew."
"Lagunitas generally delivers the goods. Wilco Tango Foxtrot is a nice addition to their overall lineup. Frankly, it tastes like a nice, hoppy Brown Ale. Honestly, I'd probably like it just a little more if it were more bitter. It's good stuff though. There's not too much to complain about. Easily recommended."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Slightly thick, with a little bit of a chewy element. Only complaint is that there is somewhat of a flavor fight going on with this one, but overall a good beer, and one I would try again especially if a few of the kinks were ironed out."
"I appreciate the fact that Lagunitas has fun with their offerings, as evidenced by their eccentric names. Wilco Tango Foxtrot comes out a rose color, with plenty of head the boot. It foams up very quickly, and stays frothy throughout the drinking experience. From the nose is some cinnamon, malt, evergreen lead, and gum. From the taste one mostly gets the battle between malt and hops, with some juicy fruit thrown in there for good measure. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side, letting the malt get the better of the hops in the end. I have to admit that this was a little tough to get through. I almost felt like I was drinking a glass of beer in the vain of Wrigely's cinnamon gum, if that makes any sense. Good, but not great. Worth a try, but probably just one from me. Cheers"
"D - Surprisingly very drinkable. I finished the entire bomber at 7.83% and felt like I could have a few more beers."
"This is a really good beer in my opinion, flavors are balanced as are hops. Heat is not found in either taste nor aroma. A balanced and Delicious tasting beer."
"I'll give this a little bit better on the drinkability factor, because it is easy enough to drink. It's just not that enjoyable to me. Also, it has that whole weird/fake smell/taste thing going on with it."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer, and somewhat unique as well. Hats off to Lagunitas."
"Overall, a decent beer but nothing that blows me out of the water. Tastes like countless other ""strong ales"" or ""barlewines"" I've had before, but a good representation of the style nonetheless. Worth a try, but don't go out of your way. This one has been done before, and in better fashion."
"Drinkablity is average. It is harsh and not smooth at all. I will not be going out of my way for this one."
"F: Bitterness builds up and apexes at the beginning of the finish. More pine and resinous hops shine through at first. Then it turns to the malts, with lots of dark malts, roast and some coffee flavors come through, then more caramel, some toffee, a little sweet stickiness, and lots of brown sugar. A surprising blend of heavy malts and roast with nice spicy and piny hops. Normally I would think the amounts of each would not contrast well, but Lagunitas pulls it off again. I'm a big fan."
"Finger plus of tan foam, lacks the density for lengthy retention, the medium and large sized bubbles have it cratering soon after the pour, patches of lacing here or there, like splattered on the glass walls. Hazy brownish amber, not red enough for mahogany, translucent but not opaque, some dilution around the rims. Sweet, not sugary, nose of candied orange peel, rose hips, toffee, molasses, coconut, as it warms it sharpens and you get white grapefruit, nectarine, papaya, pineapple fruit, fairly ""tropical," hops dominate without bitterness, herbaceousness. Full-bodied, the carbonation comes close to causing discharge when you start sipping. Here more chocolate, vanilla, toffee and coffee ice cream upfront. As it hits your throat the hops switch things up, pine, flowers, mixed sour citrus and pumpernickel bread. Touch more restraint in the peach, apricot, pineapple, mango fruit, flavorful but not out to smack you down. The molasses and honey return to saturate the finish, coconut oil too. More of a rollercoaster ride than balanced, integrated sipper."
"D- Overall, if some of the flavors were stronger to better match up with the higher alcohol content, this would be much better. Not bad, but not a stand out either."
"Highly drinkable for any hophead and a beer which I thought was great and will seek out. This is labeled a strong ale, but I found it easy to drink."
"Lagunitas always puts out good value beers, not anything mind blowing but for the money its hard to beat. this is no exception. Its a mid-gravity alcohol brown ale that shows no hotness with a molasses sweet malt backbone with a hint of brown sugar and bit of roast and just a bit of hops to keep it from going over board. it's a simple plan for a simple beer that hits the mark for an easy drinking good tasting brown ale."
"Pours a translucent brown with very creamy head that retains well, laces nicely, and is by far the best feature of this ale. Nose is rather weak some light citrus. On the palate the citrusy hops come right out and remind me of all the ""black IPA"" rage lately, as the color in this beer does not deliver the expected roasty, malty whollop that the color would suggest. A bit leafy on the finish."
"D- a fantastic brew from lagunitas. They know how to take a brew and validate a flavor profile. And that keeps me coming back for more. There is a strong amount of alcohol in his brew. However, I think a bomber or two of these is not only feasible... but a great time as well. A good west coast, strong american ale"
"I bought this as a suggestion from a friend, and I am not disappointed. Since this is apparently a limited release, I'm thinking of grabbing a case to hold me through the summer."
"Mouthfeel is solid, with lots of carbonation belying the high abv and viscosity. A well-played take on the Arrogant Bastard prototype, I enjoyed this one on tap."
"D- Needless to say, I won't revisit this one."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this delicios offering from Lagunitas. It's a very tasty brew for a very reasonable price (purchased 22oz bottle for $3.75). Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Another winner from Lagunitas. Could easily session this one. I like a higher ABV beer, and this one fits that bill nicely."
"Overall, decent just don't get it expecting a brown."
"drinkability is great - maybe this should be the winter version of hop stoopid"
"Drinkability: well, I like it well enough, but I think I'll have to peg the drinkability to the flavor. As the hop flavor accumulates on my palate, it becomes rather spent and vegetabley; not a great complement to some of this beer's better aspects."
"Overall another really impressive beer. Lagunitas deserves all of the credit it gets and then some. They make some great beers and sell them at a reasonably good value. Just what we need in this WTF world we live in."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a red rocks brown with a massive 3 inch cap that leaves soapy lacing all the way down the glass. Once again, Lagunitas has made a really pretty beer. The aroma is odd. Big piney, resiny hops mixed with brown sugar and chocolate. Bit of raisin. The flavor is much the same. Up front, once again, you get this big piney hops, semi brutalizing the palate. Not what I expected, then it completely switches gears and hits you with brown sugar, a little bit of sweet chocolate, prunes and raisins, then bam, its back to the hops for the finish. The mouthfeel is light and perfectly carbonated. For me, this is a marriage that ends in divorce. The flavors just don't work together and instead butt heads."
"D - This is a beer that is very typical of what I have come to expect of Lagunitas. The combination of rich, caramel and toffee malt with aggressive hoppiness reminds me of several of their beers that I have had in the past. This is even more unusual than the rest of their catalogue with the dark malt having an intense bready caramel and molasses character, complimented by odd notes of smoke. Worth trying, though I don't know that I will have another one."
"D-This one is delicious and drinkable. For just shy of 8%, it has no trace of the ABV in the taste or mouthfeel."
"Pretty drinkable. Def a WTF of a beer. very interesting, unconventional, and tasty."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Spaten Mug. I had tried this offering at a local beer festival on tap and was quite impressed. Out of the bottle didn't disappoint either. Poured a light brown with a one finger off-white head. Lacing was slight throughout. The aroma had hints of nuts upon first inspection. This brew has a medium body on the palate with average carbonation. Overall this is an excellent brew from Lagunitas. I just hope that they come up with more offerings like this one."
"D: Very drinkable, good mix of flavors and feel for a really interesting beer."
"D - Well I missed out in getting another bottle of the Cappuccino stout before it so WTF? I better get me another one before it's gone! Since I never heard of an imperial brown this would have to be a good rep of one!"
"D - Great beer. Pretty impressive and much better than I had expected."
"Pours a clear dark brown-red color with a good off-white head which soon turns to a film. Mild aroma of malts and hop spicyness. Taste of toasted malts, hops, spices, and brown sugar. Medium-bodied with a slightly bitter aftertaste. An enjoyable beer... strong for a brown ale, but drinks nice. I'd certainly get this again."
"beautiful deep reddish brown, short creamy beige head that lingered and laced nicely. Nicely balanced aroma, complex bouquet of hops and sweet malt. Could definitely pick this out of a lineup as a lagunitas beer. It's by no means light, but it is lighter than I expected given the color and abv. WTF a limited release, and I plan do my part in consuming this batch's inventory."
"D - Overall a fairly light, easy drinking, flavorful beer. Too bad its a limited release; Lagunitas is trying to break our hearts."
"I could and will drink several of these in a setting, very good beer by Lagunitas, especially for the value!"
"D: This has some nice maltiness, but sort of a half-hearted overall flavor. I keep waiting for it to open up and start to wow me a little, but it isn't really happening. Not bad, but not really recommended."
"This finally showed up in Colorado and for my money I really feel like I get a good value out of Lagunitas beers. This was brown but almost chestnut, light brown. It smelled like a brown ale and nothing special at that but the taste was a real departure. The flavor was super hoppy to me, almost like an IPA or something, very cool."
"Unimpressed. Come on lagunitas I expect more."
"Drinkability was pretty good, no real alcohol flavor to it so it would be easy to drink quite a few glasses."
"The body was good, even, clean and balanced. Drinkability was good, I'd have a couple in a row, but maybe not more than that. Overall, a solidly decent beer that has taken a step in restoring my opinion of this brewery."
"Overall- this brew is one for an all around picky person. it's got such a light hop scent mixed with light malt presence. i was expecting alil more of a showcase of malt but still highly drinkable. this would be a good one to have on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: Lagunitas has hit it out of the ballpark with this one; tremendously complex malt profile matches up with the hoppiness you expect from this brewery"
"One of the better beers from Lagunitas, and as usual, it's well priced. Pours walnut brown with a garnet tinge. Decent head to start, but it fades a little too quickly. Smells malty, and a bit sweet, but there are some earthy hops and a vinous note that helps it from being cloying. Very nice flavors. This is a bold beer, but surprisingly malty for lagunitas. Nice breadiness with a touch of citrus and molasses as well as some spicy, earthy hops. Nice body without being overwhelming or too sweet. Creamy but firm. The alcohol is noticeable, but reasonably well hidden as well. Overall a very balanced delicious beer."
"Unleashing this translucent deep mahogany liquid from bottle unto glass, imbibers will be presented with an ample eruption of lightly tan head subsiding with some hustle yet retaining a nice cap for mild lacing. Strong aroma full of citrus foretells the hoppy flavor of this brew with malt flavors present though taking a backseat. Alcohol apparent, somewhat sweet and sticky with a tart finish and lingering bitterness. Astringent."
"Very drinkable beer and nice mouthfeel. Another very good beer from lagunitas."
"Under a finger of head dissipates quickly over a beautiful copper and red. Nice cap of retention and some lacing. Aromas are toasted biscuit and dark fruits with fig and prune. The initial taste reveals toasted biscuit malts, which are pretty huge. Is that the ""robust"" the label promises? There's a bit of bitter bite and some significant notes of alcohol. Mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation. All in all nice and warming."
"Very drinkable and well crafted. Hops flavor surprisingly has a larger role than expected and helps to amplify the taste by keeping the malt from becoming cloyingly sweet. Barely any alcohol heat on the swallow. Another nice offering ."
"A wonderfully crafted beer. I'd definitely recommend. This would easily become a go-to beer for me if it was available as such."
"This is one of the better drinking beers I have had in a while. The generous character leaves you craving more, yet nothing punishing to the palate, and easy to consume."
"A deep copper colored brew with a thick light oatmeal colored head and stifling amounts of lacing. The aroma offers sweet malt vinegar and some cat piss hops with earthy malt. Pretty intense with a slight bubblegum overtone, nice. The flavor comes on with a malty blend of grapefruit hop and fruit nougat. It's a medium-plus bodied brew with fairly low carbonation and a silky feel. Quite drinkable for the style but you can sense some alcohol. This comes close to some outstanding DIPA's, it's very good just a hair off the best I think. There's some nutty champagne qualities. A very nice beer."
"Cheers!"
"I think this is my favorite American Strong since Stone Arrogant Bastard. The color is a dark brown with a good head but not too big. Foam color is much lighter than the beer. Flavor is mellower than the Arrogant Bastard but very good and a great balance of malt, hops and alcohol. Would recommend."
"Another good offering from Lagunitas."
"I'm sitting up listening to Wilco while drinking Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot, a nice hybrid hoppy brown ale after putting the babies down for slumber. Pours a deep mahogany brown hue with a nice fulfilling two finger gap of light khaki head floating above the body of this brew. Minimal amounts of speckled lacing cling to my imperial pint glass I'm imbibing from. Aromatics bring out some nice hops with herbal tea leaf and citric qualities going down. A spearmint herbal tone really interweaves with the dark roasted malty layers as well brings out some cookie dough and creamy malt notes as well. Flavors include a nice biscuit dark roasty brown malt backbone kicking up the dust with a few scraps of herbal/citric/and minty hop bursts flying across the palate, quite the excellent experience. As it warms the hops brighten in the best possible way, I will call this an IBA, quite possibly the best example I have had of the India Brown Ale thus far competing closely between DFH and Terrapin versions that I've enjoyed. Like a nice hop tea joined with some Italian Biscotti, those brown malts make this a warm and inviting experience. Mouthfeel is soft carbonation is sturdy yet restrained enough to let the beer do the talking excellent finish on the palate with occasional citric hop burps arising in the back of the throat this is one kick ass drinking beer. No worries find this one and give it a shot what does the title refer to or mean? I have no clue but I know good beer when I see it. I'm glad it made me tune into Wilco's Yanke Hotel Foxtrot, fuckin' classic listening jewel to go along with this great drinking IBA."
"Getting something that's essentially called ""WTF"" on the shelf is a testament to some clever marketing by the folks at Lagunitas. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from past experiences with this company, but I was pleased with this beer. Though not quite in the realm of Arrogant Bastard with respect to American Strong Ales, WTF has a unique complexity of its own that is very enjoyable. This brew is a limited release, so I recommend trying it on account of its balance, flavor, and price (~$3.50 for a 22 oz. bomber)."
"this one drinks relativly easy, nothing to strong in here to slow you down. no alcohol really detectable. one is enough in my opinion however. i prolly wont seek this out again, i wouldnt really recommend it either unless you got a thing for lagunitas. but theyve never really wowed me with a beer yet."
"I don't think I've had this in the intervening three years. Still looks the same as I described, smell could be about the same. I get more dark fruity flavor now, and no soap. Mouthfeel is still soft, but I'd go with plush instead of gritty now."
"D: I enjoy it, but I don't know that I could drink two of them back to back (good this the bottle is about 1.5 then)"
"A very tasty and drinkable brew with some of Lagunitas' trademark whimsical branding."
" D- This beer has some nice malts of a red ale and some darker roasted malts that support them. The good balance between full hop flavor and rich malty flavor. The hops are mostly flavor without bitterness. It was refreshing to have a good quality beer over 7% ABV that is under five dollars."
"D: Dangerous."
"DK: This beer is flavorful and downable. Especially for a strong ale. This is good stuff. Alcohol flavor is neglible."
"odd taste combos abound, hard to place and hard to take, don't smear the brand though, they have lots of good beers (just not this one)"
"Very interesting and well done by a brewer that I consider significantly one sided in their brews(mostly unbalanced hop bombs or derivatives of). A good price as always as well."
"Strong flavor, big malts, but still crisp. Very enjoyable."
"Overall it was better then I expected. Nice and rich and very drinkable. I would have no trouble enjoying this one again any day."
"A new seasonal....WTF? Pours a rather clear, tea color with a very little head and many bubbles. Smells of big citrus and piney hoppiness with a little wheat bread. With each sip it clings to the side of the glass leaving a white curtain. Tastes mingle on my tongue. The hops are there with some spicyness then the malt perks up but gets slammed down again in the finish. Cofffe comes into play then quickly vanishes as well. Not much of a strong ale but more of a young barley wine/IPA combo."
"Poured in to a pint glass and manifests a translucent brown ale, minimal off white head. Some pine, grapefruit and medium roasted malts. Brown Pale Ale seems to be an appropriate descriptor. The malt character is pretty robust but there is a bizarre clash between the grapefruit and the malt that creates an off aroma and taste. This brew cannot really seem to reconcile the malt and hop element thought both would be superb on their own. The carbonation is medium and feels appropriate for this hybrid and there is a real sweet aftertaste that masks the 7.8%. Overall a very interesting beverage but I don't really think the citrus hops belong here."
"Taste starts off with some nutty, toasted malts. Woody, herbal hop bitterness comes on quick. Caramel-sweet malt base provides some balance. Bitter dark chocolate and city-roast Kenyan coffee takes over. A little fruitiness peeks in, but gets scared off by the bitterness. Finish is hoppy and dry with lingering notes of weed. Hoppier than it smells, with a medium body and a creamy feel. Good use a little more balance and a little less astringency. Still, not bad."
"I really enjoyed this beer, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. It definitely had a very Lagunitas character to it while still being a very different beer than others that I have had by this brewer. I would definitely recommend it to those who are not really ""into"" beer but like to try new things that they will like."
"backbone. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This is the first time we've ranked ANY beer this high. It pours a dark ruby clear color into the glass--well carbonated. Unexpected beautifully floral hops in the nose for what appears to be a brown ale. On the palate--brown sugar, maple syrup, a bit of smoke and raisins. Dark fruit, dates, fig."
"Taste adds just a splash of caramel malt and ... chocolate/molasses?.... to a resiny, sugary backbone that's offset by a surprising amount of fresh hops. What? What the hell type of beer is this? Oddly enough, I think it reminded me more of Arrogant Bastard than anything else."
"D: Good. Reminds me of Stone's Arrogant Bastard at times, which I like a lot, so that's a compliment."
"Very nice beer. Not sure I'll ever drink this in place of Hop Stoopid, but it ain't bad."
"*note - this has characteristics like an IPA than anything else"
"Pours a very nice syrup brown color with some dense eggshell head that laces nicely and sticks around for a while. Smell is good, though not what I was expecting, big citrusy and piney hops dominate. Little or no maltiness there, at least to me. I thought this was supposed to be ""robust"" and ""malty."" Hmm. Taste isn't bad, but it's pretty much just hops--citrus and pine. For some reason the malt isn't shining through this at all. Just a slightly darker IPA. Imperial Brown Ale? Seems to be more like a ""Brown IPA", if I may coin a new term. MF is a bit thin for my liking, but it's a nice drinker. I was happy to try this one, though I am not sure if this is a win from Lagunitas. This is definitely a beer that strikes me as confused about what it wants to be. Good to try, would rather have Hop Stoopid or Olde Gnarleywine any day."
"One finger light tan head, pretty quick dissipation with good trail of lacing over. Amber body a bit cloudy chill haze with a bit of visible carbonation over. Nose is very malty, caramel, some roast, hops are not very odor present over. Taste is malty with some floral hops for balance over. Full mouthfeel decent effervescence over. Alcohol is pretty noticeable cuts into drinkability though it is pretty good for style, but another nice offering from Lagunitas out."
"Mouthfeel is good, drinkability is good. Not a whole lot going on, lots of malts. It was good, just nothing to seek out."
"Overall - Enjoyed this one a lot and look forward to having it again."
"D - Not difficult to drink but not easy. This beer seems confused by what it wants to be and I don't think that is a good thing. I don't really plan on seeking this one out again."
"D: Good drinkability as well good enjoyment. Toasted dry caramel and grapefruit citrus of moderate proportions inline with typical Lagunitas character makes this another solid and steady production drink that will no doubt satisfy fans."
"Overall I had no idea what to expect from this beer as it falls under the less than specific style of ""American Strong Ale"". Having always enjoyed beers for Lagunitas, I decided to give this one a try and I am glad that I did. Recommended."
"Overall: This a well balanced very flavorful beer. I really like it. I should have pick up a couple more bottles."
"Sweet and nice. There is some great bitterness with this beer and its surprisingly drinkable. I'm really feeling this beer. Carbonation on the palate is great and there is nice connectivity throughout. I would recommend it and drink it again."
"Pours a clear reddish brown, with fluffy offwhite head, clumps of lace here and there. Smell: it's like a slightly toned down Hop Stoopid: pineapple, tangerine, and spicy. Backdrop of dark brown sugar. Taste: leafy, pineapple, prickly, a little citrus peel, lots of caramel. There's a very light roasty taste left at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, a little syrupy but with an uplifting fluffy feel (is wheat for body a new trend for Lagunitas?). Doesn't scream impy brown to me... but Brown IPA, for sure. Very nice."
"D - refreshing and damn drinkable...especially at $4.50/pint"
"One hell of a beer. I really can't complain about the alcohol percentage since this beer was $5, not bad for 7%+. Nice hop haracter and deceptively dry. I love this brewery. Also a good big beer if you want something to sip, but are all barley-wined out from drinking your sixer of Bigfoot over a day and a half or less."
"the 64.20 I.B.U. is enough to please most hop heads."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rich and filling, leaves a slight steely hop flavor on the back of the tongue. This is very drinkable, on my second bottle! What a great deal for $5!"
"Decent beer, but probably the worst I've had from Lagunitas."
"This poured a clear dark cherry with a little light tan head. It smelled like sweet cherries and light caramel, with a bit of apricot and mango and pepper. It tasted like roasted barley and sweet caramel, with cherry and apricot and copper hops, and a bit of chocolate. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was another nice brew from Lagunitas. The scent was great, and the taste was clean and enjoyable (although they were fairly different). Basically the same hop profile as all recent Lagunitas beers, but with a bolder, roastier malt to counter-balance the flavor. The body was good, and the alcohol was decently hidden, so it was easy to drink. I'd call this a really good amber ale, which makes me want to try it side by side with Nugget Nectar."
"D: tasty and damn drinkable."
"D: A solid, generally drinkable beer."
"D: very easy drinking but not a whole lot of flavor, considering this is an imperial brown...I've had brown ales with loads more of flavor (aka Bender), not bad but will not seek out again"
"I'd get this again, as it's relatively reasonable for a bomber."
"Another hoppy release from Lagunitas. Not sure if it is worth the WTF reference, but I like the ""we're not quite in the red or in the black... does that mean we're in the brown?!"" Cheers."
"Well done, my good folks, when I am done, I shall return to the work at hand, but, for now, I revel in this small pleasure."
"Sip with caution!"
"I'm not terribly impressed with this beer, but it certainly isn't bad. Its worth a try."
"drinkability - very smooth with moderate flavor, easy to drink for the abv it has"
"Had this one on-cask at the Pony Bar. Served in a standard pint. Poured the color of dark iced tea with a bubbly, frothy, off-white cap. Nose was malty and reveals brown sugar and perhaps a hint of cocoa. Taste consistent with nose - a whole lot of malty goodness with some hops bittering that comes out at the finish to keep it from being cloying. Mouthfeel is medium-light. Texture is not really creamy, but there is some viscosity or oiliness to the mouthfeel. Really tasty and easy drinking. I'd love to see how this compares in the bottle or on draught."
"Initially this beer didn't impress me, but as I worked my way through the bottle I found myself liking it more. Certainly for the price it's got a great bang for the buck ratio. Worth a try if you have a chance."
"Bomber from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. No freshness info available. Pours darker auburn/mahogony brown, typical darker tan head, tightly knit, leaves better then average sheeting and extensive stands of lace. Bolder nose of sweet, maple malts buffeted by floral hop notes. Enjoyable ale, seems more like a bold brown ale, then a strong, but whatever, style guidelines be damned. Balanced and bold, dark bready waves of flavor, solid, but not overpowering hops fulling in effect. Another real nicely crafted brew from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: easy to enjoy, though as the temp lowers this brew could become sweeter but nowhere near cloying"
"I don't give a shit what people say, i bought this beer for the name, This beer was named after Wilco the band. One of there albums is Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. If this is a coincidence than i'm stupid..Wilco is a favorite band of mine, and i've been to many of their concerts..I bought it for its name but it is a good beer."
" Some chocolate mouth feel. Hints of chocolate licorice grapefruit . nuts Nice warm feeling. Strong and drinkable. Great name, comments and label. Another fine addition as a limited release."
"D - Very drinkable. Sweetness would get cloying beyond a few servings so a bomber is perfect."
"It's not that this is a bad beer, it's just confusing. I think it's a decent beer, but my tongue and head are both confused. Their is a lack of cohesion in the taste. An interesting beer, but one I would pass on again."
"Overall a pretty decent brew that fits the title pretty well."
"D- easy enough to finish and at a fantastic price, this is something ill look for more of before its all gone. an especially great bargain when found on sale. its less than 4$!"
"I'm not the biggest fan of brown ales, but the massive hop addition to this one make it a great ""crossover"" beer for hopheads that want to give their palate a rest (too many DIPAs leads to that palate fatugue). This has enough hop kick to prevent the withdrawl symptoms, but only 65 ibus keep it in control and allow the beer to be nicely balanced."
"WTF. (not what the fuck,) is good beer. It is a beer that looks as good as it tastes. Not many do that."
"Drinkability: Rarely do I drink the same beer twice, but I will be buying more of this beer."
"Pretty solid brew."
"Clear mahogany with a large light tan head. Lacing is much better than average. Aroma is just O.K. due to somewhat stuffed nasal passages at this time. Taste is piney hops with a large malt and maybe brown sugar component. Very well balanced. Quite similar to some of the better ""winter warmers"". Very tasty though somewhat sweet finish. I would rate the drinkability higher if not for the 7.8% abv."
"D- An extremely drinkable brew, especially for the price. Lagunitas rarely disappoints and this is no exception."
"D- Goes down without any issues and leaves nothing but a smile on my face after every sip. Lagunitas delivers again. Cannot wait to see what they come out with next."
"WTF? This is a delicious and refreshing strong ale! Just the thing to prepare for yet another job interview."
"Sweet malty up front then a subtle dose of piney hops. Bitter and with a nice hint of chocolate. Finishes bitter and dry."
"The pour is gorgeous. Deep reddish brown with amber highlights, there's a thick cap of off-white head that lasts for as long as the beer is in the glass. Lacing is great too. The nose is solid. I get a very fresh pine hop aroma, quite juicy with some toasted bread, brown sugar and caramel. The palate opens with a moderate hop bite, quite pine like, along with a blend of caramel, brown sugar and toasted malt. Maybe a touch of chocolate? Sweetness is moderate, and it doesn't feel like all the flavors have come together very well. Mildly hoppy on the finish with lingering pine and some moderate sweetness, this beer has a moderate level of carbonation. Solid stuff, I drank my pour rather quick and quite enjoyed it. However, this is far from earth-shattering."
"Drinkability- It was really good. I loved it and would love more."
"it's got a robust body to carry the hop load and i suppose that is what differentiates the style from an DIPA, right? strong citrus and mint and currant hop character. the malt has its own fruity thing going on but i'm mostly getting brown sugar and molasses. good bready-type flavors, particularly a touch of breadcrust at the finish."
"D - I'm not sure what drinkability means. Bud Light lost big on an advertising campaign that trumpeted its ""drinkability."" Would you rank a food on ""eatability?"" Either you can get it down the hatch, or you can't. This one went down the hatch."
"Anyway, despite the sig-fig abuse, the beer's good."
"Picked this baby up on a trip to DC...pours a mahogany color with a nice tan head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is really nice on this one, with a big hoppy presence upfront with notes of grapefruit, pine and orange zest, as well as some caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread and some dark fruits (fig, plum, raisin). The taste starts off with a hoppy blast of orange peel, grapefruit and a little pine, followed by brown sugar and caramel, fig and plum, some toasted bread and a slight hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is pretty good. This is a really good beer, an india brown ale on steroids but well executed. Another winner from Lagunitas."
"Cute name, but this beer is mostly a miss."
"Drinkable - not really, would I spend any more money on it - no."
"D - Alcohol is fairly well hidden for the 8%. Very drinkable. Better than some of their other efforts, yet faintly similar,"
"For someone who loves their Lagunitas Red, this is a definite winner. For fans of Lagunitas Racer 5 but who becomes occasionally overwhelmed by the over-the-top tangerine citrus and sweeter aftertaste of Racer 5, this is your next choice."
"Smooth, full bodied, and properly carbonated. The feel and the appearance are both excellent. This should age nicely. I could see myself drinking this again."
"Overall, this is a fantastic offering. At $4 for a bomber, I think it's one not to be passed up."
"drinkability: Oh this is nice. WTF indeed."
"D - goes down very easy."
"The beer didn't taste ""off," at least in terms of being undrinkable and skunked out. It just seemed like a bland and unimpressive brew."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this brew, then again I have been a fan of all of Lagunitas seasonal releases."
"drinkability: nice beer, alot of their beers are starting to tase similar to me. but hey I like them"
"Not a favorrite style, but never the less a good effort."
"M/D: Medium bodied but slick, Prickly carbonation. Despite some apparent sweetness, drinkability is great - drank a 22oz myself before I knew it. Theres really no alcohol heat, especially for an 8% beer. Its also worth mentioning that I picked this up for like 4 bucks or something, nice! Thanks Lagunitas."
"D- Very smooth and easy to drink. No trace of the alcohol at all. I am quickly becoming a huge fan of Lagunitas Brewing. As I said, I liked the smooth creaminess of this beer as well as the sweet then hop flavor. Nice on a cooler day."
"Pours out a reddish brown with about a inch head on it, that doesn't seem to want to go away. The smell reminds me of what a forrest would smell like after heavy rain (think pine and wet bark). The flavor has plenty of sweet caramel and maltiness to balance out the hops. The pine smell comes though on the flavor as well, with a little grapefruit thrown in. Mouthfeel is nearly perfect with the alcohol very well balanced."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Pours a nice deep ruby red/brown color in the glass, with some nice ecru colored head. Aromas of nuts, brown sugar and earthy hops. On the palate, I get more nuttiness, braced with oranges and a bit of chocolate. Another great effort from Lagunitas--Alcohol is well hidden, leaving a nice, sneakily drinkable beer behind."
"D: Definitely."
"Got this as a total surprise from a friend during the final four. I was previously drinking a glass of coke zero when this was served to me in a clean pint glass. The only way I can tell the difference between it and the coke zero is the coke has ice in it. The smell is nondescript. Slightly malty, not much hop aroma at all. The taste is much hoppier than I expected. Earthy flavored hops and a malty taste give the beer a full almost biscuity taste that reminds me of a super strength irish red. A moderately easy drinker, I feel that it doesn't really do any one thing particularly well, a solid beer, but not really worth seeking out in my opinion."
"Nearly an Arrogant Bastard clone."
"Another tasty offering from Lah Goo Knee Tuss, though hardly the caliber of some of their others. Won't get again."
"Pours a solid brown color, hazy, wtih a wispy tan colored head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of citrus hops, light honey and lemon. Not very strong in aroma and what is there is pretty much all hops. The taste is of muted caramel malt, dried citrus hops, light pine, and some tea like bitterness. Tastes like a dull hoppy amber ale I guess I was figuring there might be more of a toasty ""brown ale"" malt presence to this thing. Moderate to fully bodied, with active carbonation, finishes with a tropical fruit hoppy bitterness. An average hoppy amber ale with a higher abv. Was hoping for more of a malty presence with this one. No off flavors but nothing spectacular."
"Update: Bumped up the flavor score and mouthfeel after giving this another try. More of the malt complexity was apparent and the Am Strong Ale hoppiness busted through more abundantly this time. I like others in their lineup, but this is solid stuff."
"This is a very drinkable strong ale. While it isn't overly complex, it is an easy drinker for nearly 8%."
"The taste is more bitter than I would have imagined. More grapefruit and dulled citrus flavors. Wow, that last sip tasted so much like pineapple that I though I was drinking pineapple juice, seriously. I WILL go buy another one of these. I really liked it."
"D- didn't think this one was as high abv as its was very well hidden to say the least. Not to big not to bold maybe a bit different then other strong ale I've had but it was real nice."
"Will have to look for this on draft, while the bottle was interesting, this just felt like another lagunitas seasonal. I love their beer, they just seem so similiar. Pretty drinkable, I finished my glass with ease but was not tempted for more. Maybe some tap action will liven things up a bit."
"Strong aroma is quite hoppy, almost like an IPA, with woody and malty tones and a hint of citrus. It pours a lovely, slightly hazy mahogany with a decent light tan head. Flavor is hoppy and woody with a malty undertone and a dash of sour citrus. There is also a subtle alcohol bite. Texture is fairly smooth, edgy and tingly. Chalk up another win to Lagunitas!"
"Thins a tad down bottle, in a nice way. This stuff just flows. Great pricing, 4.5 a 22."
"Serving type: bottle/stein"
"I was glad that Lagunitas came out with an ""India Brown Ale"" because I'd been quite curious about the style for some time and there were no examples I could get my hands on. At $3.69 a bomber, this brewery's beer is usually worth grabbing. I don't think this is an exception, though it isn't mindblowing or revolutionary. It's Brown Shugga with fewer hops in my opinion."
"Drinkability: When I first drank this I thought to myself, ""This is the perfect beer to pair with a meal. Very flavorful without dominating the tongue."" Of course you could sit around drinking these all day too."
"Another solid brew by Lagunitas, similar to a few others I've encountered by them and quite likeable by me even if they seem to keep within the same flavor profile. This is a solid Strong ale that has some nice malty complexity and Barleywine-like features that make for a bomber full of goodness and decent drinkablitiy."
"Sharp. Clashing. Not bad, but not good enough to have again, though at a reasonable price. Different. I'm usually impressed with this brewery - not so much here."
"Pretty darn drinkable, highly hopped, probably the last glass of this I'll have."
"I wish I had another 22 of this, its quite a good brew. I'm sure I will be purchasing it again, bonus on an awesome price point ($3.99)."
"Drinkability: This beer is FUN. Its well balance, fascinating and totally worth a try whether you're a hops or a malt lover."
"I would love to try this on tap, but for a beer available in the local grocery store, it was very enjoyable."
"This is pretty hoppy. Then again, this is Lagunitas. Still, I can't help but wish for a little more of a malt profile out of this one..."
"d - Pretty nice ale. Hops weren't as prominent as I was expecting, but was a nice combination. Would try again."
"This beer was pretty good and I'm glad I picked it up. Looking forward to trying the other Lagunitas in my haul now."
"Overall this is a much better strong ale than it is an American brown. If you like most other Lagunitas beers chances are you'll be a fan of this one - worth a shot."
"D: Easy drinking and well balanced, but doesn't excel at anything in particular. Good, but not something I'd really want more than one of."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into a pint glass. The label describes this brew as a ""Malty, Robust, Recovery Ale," however when I popped the cap on this bad it was almost entirely hops. No complaints though. The brew pours a copper/brown color with an off white head. The aroma is heavy on the hops with a touch of sweet malt. Taste is amazing, right up my alley. It's almost like a brown IPA, something you don't see very often, but beers like this make you wish you did. In the end, this is very drinkable and a definite win from the lads at Lagunitas."
"- Easy to drink, balanced... and tasty... a bit of a better offering from Lagunitas. Worth trying. And almost a step away from their dominant and unique hop additions."
"Listening to/watching a live version of Impossible Germany from the Sky Blue Sky DVD as I drink this. Pours a dark amber color, was hoping for a little more brown, but this'll do, no head or lacing. Aroma is mostly hops off the bat. Getting some brown malts as it warms, but still hoppy. Taste is the same. Too much hops for me. The label says ""malty (and) robust," but I'm not getting a whole lot of malts, and certainly not much robustness. This is hoppy, and one-dimensional in it's malt character. There is some nice balance in there as it warms up, some sweetness starts to show through, light caramel and breadiness with maybe (just maybe) a hint of chocolate. Overall, not digging it too much. This falls under the category of the so-called ""India Brown Ale"" but this misses the mark when comparing to what others have done. It tastes like a typical West Coast IPA with a little chocolate malt thrown in. I really felt this was one-dimensional and unimpressive. I thought jamming to some Wilco would save the experience, but even one of my favorite bands in the world could do this beer no justice."
"Cheers!"
"Overall I am really unsure this is an Imperial Brown, as the label states, but nonetheless I really liked it. If the majority of brown ales tasted like this, I would be a much bigger fan of the style. Whether Wilco was a play on the name or not, I hope they appreciate the effort that was put into the creation of this brew as it is worthy of their (and your) immediate attention. Excellent work again by one of my favorite breweries."
"Body is moderate with a full level of carbonation, but not overdone. Relatively tasty stuff though, different from expected, and not necessarily in a bad way. Lagunitas is quite experimental and I dig it, though this one is not quite as tasty of most of their nice brews."
"Lagunitas outdid themselves with this limited release. I purchased only one 22 oz bottle and wished I would have purchased more, considering the $6 price. The appearance was a clear mahoganey brown with about a 1 finger tan head. The foam slowly settled leaving a thin film of bubbles on the surface. There is a strong roasted malt aroma. The flavor is very balanced between the roasted malt and the hops. At 64.2 IBUs it satisfies the cravings for bitterness but provides the maltiness of a lager. The bitterness also lingers long on the palate. The mouthfeel is rather even, not very sharp on the tongue. Medium bodied, in that you get a full flavor profile throughout. As opposed to thinner beers that you don't know you're even drinking. As far as drinkability, I could go back to this beer again and again. I'll have to see where it may be on draft."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch off-white head. Had retention is OK, lacing is good. Nice aroma, the beer smells like chocolate, caramel, toffee, and pine and citrusy hops. The brew tastes like caramel malt, citrus (grapefruit) and pine hops, bready malt, and some chocolate and brown sugar. Great balance between the hops and malt in the flavor of this brew, although I think the hops flavors are stronger. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with light/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew. I'll definitely buy this again, especially considering the low price (I think it was just $4.99 a bomber). That's another reason I like Lagunitas a lot, they have great beer at affordable prices."
"Overall a superior ale."
"Bottle, home. Good strong ale. Lagunitas decided to go maltier than usual with this beer, and it works pretty well, though I prefer their hop-centric offerings. The beer pours a deep reddish brown, maybe ruby... is that a real color? There's not much head on my pour perhaps because I'm drinking it a bit warm. The aroma has a whole mess of well-developed malt notes with some nice piney, citrusy hops. There's a bit of chocolate, but I'm getting more caramel fruit flavors with touches of rye spice and nuts. The flavor is a rich and could have easily gone too sweet but hops and yeast keep the malt in check. Full, thick feel. This beer drinks bigger than its abv. Another nice one from Lagunitas."
"This beer poured a very dark clear amber color and formed a huge foamy light tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and chocolate. The flavor was of malt, coffee and hint of cocoa. The body was fairly light and the finish slightly dry yet sweet."
"D: The malt and hops interaction makes this a very interesting beer, something complex enough to sip slowly, yet bitter enough to drink in lieu of an IPA."
"I'd probably, just drink it for the name! The fact that it's delicious makes it even easier!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium heavy bodied with a hint of bubbly carbonation."
"Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden. This seems close to some others in the lineup. Very nice."
"Drinkability - Well-rounded. Plenty of citrus hop notes (which I love), nice balance of spicy/pine hop character with sweet, roasty malts, well-hidden abv. Liked it a lot. Might make another cameo in my fridge."
"D: This is one easy drinking beer. As usual Lagunitas does not disappoint."
"I like this beer, will definitely have it again."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Drinkability was dinged a bit since the alcohol did become a little aggressive as it warmed. Definately a good beer."
"Overall I'm pretty happy how this drink interplays with the album. This beer hits all the scales (high and low) to allow me to feel the album."
"D- I like this beer but its really not an eye popper."
"D: Hop character dominates (how surprising). Lighter on tongue than expected. Not full bodied, but dangerously drinkable."
"I am not that impressed with this. Kind of in the ""Black IPA"" vain if that makes any sense, and I really hate that term/style. More style than substance. Not something I am going to get again."
"Taste does tone it down a bit on the hops for a Lagunitas brew, although they are still there aplenty. Loads of citrus peel and pine resin. Lots of hop flavor without being overly bitter though, which is cool. Malts are like chocolate biscuits with a toasty, almost burnt aspect. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that said, it has a silky texture that glides down the throat with more ease than a 7.8% beer should. I really like it, I will definitely go out and buy a couple more bombers at least. Well done Petaluma crew!"
"D: A solid beer right now. I would like to see where this is in 6 months to a year where the hops die down a bit and the malt can come out. The malt I tasted I really liked, and I feel should have been more of focal point of this beer. With some aging it could be a 4-4.5 in taste IMO, so it's a beer to keep an eye on."
"Overall a very tasty brew. Couldn't see drinking much more than a bomber but get some for sure if you can."
"interesting and definately deserves a try."
"Tastes like a knock-off of Victory's Yakima Twilight...hoppy, but restrained with a burst of bitter pine sap on the finish. Malts are vinous and slightly beefy, interesting. Light carbonation struggles to wake up the tongue, but ultimately this feels too watery for the ABV. Slightly sticky on the finish with a lingering hoppiness and brown sugar. All in all, a decent, if predictable release from Lagunitas. One and done for me, but I'd still recommend giving it a try."
"D= This beers label is misleading but the taste is still great. Awesome appearance and unique taste. One of the most well balanced beers in a while when I think about it."
"Good drinkability on this one. Not the most exciting beer, but an easy one to drink, and enjoyable enough."
"On a side note: Their label cracks me up, again. I'm loving their ""current events"" theme they've had going with other seasonal releases."
"What a nice surprise. Found this on tap @ a local place here in Baltimore. Just bursting with flavor. I've only recently begun to appreciate hoppiness in beer. The hops come through but so did a nice underlying fruitiness. Crisp and very drinkable. Would definitely drink again."
"I picked up a bottle for $8 from Abe's Cold Beer. So this is basically an imperial brown of sorts, right? How about that's what the label is hinting at. I thought I'd like this beer, but it just couldn't catch on. I got very little malt character and while the cirtus fruit punch hops were delicious, the only other thing I tasted was a medicinal candy taste that was more odd than unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend this beer, while Lagunitas gets the hops right, there's little balance from barley."
"22 ounce bomber poured into a Unibroue tulip. Big fluffy, off-white head, bursting with juicy aromas. Grapefruit dominates the smell, some malt sweetness, stunning, just stunning. Taste follows suit with bitter hop goodness with a nice malt balance, leaning towards the bitter. Awesome. Delicious if your in the mood for hops, delicious if your in the mood for malt. Tastes great, looks great, feels great, smells great and if it could speak, I'm sure it would have the voice of an angel."
"D - Makes a good sipper. Worth checking out, and with Lagunitas pricing, it's a pretty good value. I'd be interested to see how this one ages."
"In conclusion I am pretty confused to what I would classify this beer. It is similar to a DIPA or barleywine( well not quite barley wine but a lighter version). I heard its a ""brown ale"" but I don't think I ever had a brown ale like this. Solid, and really recommended."
"Overall, an very nice beer for this style. I was originally drawn to this beer due to the name (I love Wilco!), but the beer is definitely very good! A nice innovative beer from a great brewery."
"Great beer will buy again!"
"D - For the price the Petaluma crew has done a great job with this beer."
"Toasty malty notes of a strong brown ale are intertwined with juicy tropical fruits, a unique combo for sure. Seriously malty flavors, toasty and somewhat rich, fading into some herbal bitterness and sweetish citrus fruits. Malt seems to dominate though the hop bitterness holds its ground. Low and even carbonation levels, full and round feel. Easy to drink a bomber, certainly worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, it's not a bad offering, but I can't say I'm a big fan. It's not aggressively hoppy enough to be a West Coast hop bomb, the malt isn't really sweet enough to make this a typical brown ale, and the combination of the two comes out more conflicted than balanced."
"The taste is big and malty with a fair amount of citrusy hops to balance it out. Nice caramel notes seem to pop out as the beer warms. Medium to Medium/Light bodied. Carbination seems to be about right. Easy to drink. A little warm alcohol in the taste is well done, not too much, but enough to let you know its there."
"(Side note: I've also had this on tap at the Lagunitas Brewery in Petaluma. They taste almost identical, though the hops were just slightly more obvious on tap.]"
"The smell was citrusy and lovely. Definitely a hop that I enjoy. The taste was malty and had delicious caramel backbone to it. I found it to be a money brew that went down smooth. I would definitely get it again."
"A: Solid mass of thick sticky head that clings to the side of the glass, medium brown in color - 4.50, S: The aroma has a very smooth and tropical fruit-like sweetness, some pineapple and possibly tangerine, just the faintest hint of something medicinal, heavy caramel and molasses, one of the most inviting aromas I've experienced in some time - 4.75, D: Nice effortless hop bite that avoids being harsh, well balanced though teetering on the side of hops, caramel sweetness, lots of grapefruit and a hint of pine, if I had to guess I would say Centennial hops were involved in this beer - 4.75, S: Very smooth - 5.00, D: A very nicely crafted ale, wonderfully balanced but with a strong hop presence, tropical sweetness is very enticing, I would buy this beer if it was seasonal - 4.50"
"glassware: tulip"
"22oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a light brown with two fingers of off white head. Citrusy hops and sweet malt in the aroma. Deeply malty, medium to full bodied. Solid amount of hop bitterness. Lingering chocolate malt in the finish. I got a bit of a raw green pepper flavor that dinged the rating for me."
"taste is of a little cherry, caramel, malt, some citrus, a touch of cocoa, nuts, and some hops, end is a little dry and a little bitter."
"This is quite mellow but I have to take away some points because of taste. All the flavor is up front. As you near the bottom of the glass the flavors just fade out on you. Best sampled as a single glass full."
"Another exceptional one-off from Lagunitas. Light brown and slightly hazy with powerful head retention. Smells of lots of fresh dry and aroma hops, Simcoe and the like. Much like and IPA. Has a pleasant bitterness which is never harsh. Deep malts finish relatively dry and compliment the impressive hops. A very drinkable imperial brown, not a malt bomb at all. Highly recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is warm and filling. Nice coating texture that warms and grows as you sip. WTF indeed."
"Crofton Md"
"This was a very nice experiment on the part of Lagunitas. Strong ale? Brown ale? Whatever it is, WTF is a good beer. Look for it if you can."
"4.5/4/4/4/4"
"I always jump at the next Lagunitas ""Limited"" beer I can get my hands on,aging this oen did not dissapoint.Poured into a imperial pint glass a mix of russett brown and amber,a 1 1/2 finger creamy mass atop that never fully settled.A lighter mix of piney hop and caramel malt,a bit of sweetish alcohol as well.Wow what great balance on the palate,starting out big and caramelly,with some juicy fruit malt notes,then comes a hefty mix of hop oils and pine resin,not to mention big citric qualities.A full creamy feel coats the mouth,making it lush.I may rate it higher than others because I love the big hopped up,uber malty American strong ales,I love it."
"This is a great beer and at $4.49 for a bomber it's a steal. Lagunitas has scored again."
"Great taste with a cold malty and smoked flavor which is well balanced by the carbonation hidden within. The taste lingers for a bit but is not astringency and leaves you wanting more. Over all, another great from la-goo-knee-tas."
"What I've always waited for...a brown ale with the robust, resiny hoppiness of an IPA, and a touch of peat like a Scottish ale. Body is near perfect for this hybrid, which is extremely drinkable, and the finish is of moderate duration. There's even some berry in the flavor profile. A really interesting experiment that Lagunitas pulled off quite well."
"It pours a clear deep brown with an almost imperceptable red hue topped with a thin umber foam. A sweet, meaty aroma is intoxicating by itself. Initial flavors are of caramel malt and sweet alcohol with a nutty infusion. It is very balanced with a nice underpinning of fruity hops. WTF has a very confusing and dark spectrum that makes you feel like something is wrong but it doesn't matter because it tastes so right. It's like they took the best of Brown Shugga and Hairy Eyeball to make WTF. A unique brew to challenge the taste buds and sip after a long day at work, or looking for work as the bottle goes."
"overall this is a successful beer -- doesn't blow my mind except for the fact that they balanced such an prominant hop line up with such a strong dark malt bill. mmm good job lagunitas."
"Drinkability is good, a robust hoppy brown that's smooth and satisfying. I bet this will age well, and at Lagunitas's usual great price, there's no reason not to try!"
"D: Very smooth and well balanced, for the abv this is very very drinkable. Just enough bitterness from the hops in the finish to make it crisp and linger...but not overpowering."
"I really like what Lagunitas did here, and I love this style. I would definitely recommend not cellaring this beer and drinking it fresh. If it were up to me, there would be many, many more hoppy, american brown ales - well done!"
"Drinkability is good. This is an interesting ""Brown/Strong"" ale. Some classic brown flavors, with a nice kick at the end. Very good beer, certainly worth a try."
