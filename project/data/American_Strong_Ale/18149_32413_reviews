"O: Rich, smooth, and indulgent, bordering on being too sweet, but still a hell of a beer."
"O- big and malty with plenty of bourbon flavor and aroma, it is drinking a hit hot at this point"
"Overwhelmingly warming from the alcohol. Save this as a dessert. Think dark treacle on the tongue. Very thick body with a low level of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really well done BA strong ale/barleywine, whatever. It jus tastes excellent, has a nice complexity, and is not too boozy. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV."

"Rich, deep and very satisfying. A lovely offering.Could be just a tad thicker on the mouthfeel."

"Overall, this is a nice offering.  I don't think it quite lives up to the hype, especially for the price tag, but this is definitely worth a try for barrel aged beer lovers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am not certain is I aged this one too long, but it is not as flavorful as I would hope. Still, it is very nice."
""
"For $21.99 well it was good... But not worthy of the price"
""
""
"Had on draft in a 10 oz snifter glass. One of best strong barrel aged beers I have ever tried. A must if you ever see it"
""

"2012 version - drinking really well with a couple years on it."
""

"O - I have wanted to try this for a while.  It has a very nice smell and flavor.  It is a little pricey given all the other high end BA ales out there.  It's worth trying once but I would stock up on Fremont or Firestone Walker for cellaring."
"Taste...lot's of licorice dark chocolate. Fizzy coke like mouth feel with a nice sweet""ish"" finish. Some heat for sure but not too boozy. Very, very nice ba. Still like Wulver better but could drink this any time."
""
"For a balanced barrel-aged sipping beer it seriously doesn't get better than this. The perfect beer for cold winter nights. One of my favs from Lost Abbey."

"Angels Share is a very sweet beer, with lots of bourbon aroma and flavor.   Very smooth.   Yes, you do notice the ABV.    Fine beer."
""
""
""
""
"So well balanced. So tasty. I had to double check the style after drinking it because it just was not what I expected and it surprised me with it's flavor. Not too much of anything, just smooth and tasty and strong."

"O: this is a great tasting beer, but I want to pause here and wonder this beer I can taste no base beer. I love the bourbon but what is the point except to round out the rough edges of bourbon with a sweeter taste. Anyway let me think on this I mag edit this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dense deep brown, not much head, lacy with some legs. The nose is sherry, leather, prune, tobacco, vanilla, hint of bourbon. Big bold palate with dark dried fruit, figs, prunes, sherry, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate and some malt. Very rich and bourbon."

"Overall - Simply fantastic. The aroma had me concerned that it was going to be harsh, but it's one of the smoothest bourbon barrel-aged brews I've had to date. It's a steep price to pay for less than a pint's worth, but if you've got a reason to treat yourself, you could do a lot worse."

"Earlier in this evening , I split a 22 oz 2013 Scucaba with wifey: and while it definitely was better than this 2014 Angel, the 2013 Angel was beter than the 2013 Scucaba (again imho )"

"Why not just drink bourbon?"
""
""
""
""

"Pours very dark, with a small tan head. Buttery, boozy, wood aromas up front, lead to a smooth caramel, sweet cocoa, toffee taste on medium to full bodied palate. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"'08 . well carb'd. all around really nice. I've had many of these flat. bubbles add alot!"
""
""
"Had it on tap at Surfside Tap Room in Oceanside California.  This year's brew according to Alex,  their sales rep, this beer clicked in  at 14.8%. Very aggressive and very boozy. Pours a cloudy dark brown with an almost non existent tan head. Beer is phenomenal just not for the faint of heart.  Must love bourbon since this one was aged for almost two years in barrels."

"Overall it's a nice barrel aged strong ale, but it's just a little too hot unfortunately.  Easily worth trying, with much to enjoy still though."
""
""
""
"(4.25) O: a world class offering, solid A rating. A bit pricey at $18 spent on a 12 oz but worth the unique experience. Sticky, syrupy, oaky goodness in a bottle with a lingering after-effect of alcohol deep in the belly long after the swallow. Definitely one of the better BA stouts, but its no BCBS by comparison."

"The flavors in this beer are fine, but the lack of carbonation is a critical flaw that causes the whole affair to come down like a house of cards. I won't be buying this one again."
"O- Overall this exceeded my expectations, and I wish I hadn't traded away both of my other bottles! An excellent representation of the style."

"Notes: The cork swelled in the bottle, needed a cork screw to get it out. Bottled Dec. 2012. Bottle conditioned for 1 year."
""
""
""
""
"Black as night with a murky look to it. Tiny wisp of off white head is scarce. A little bit of Brussels lacing is present. All I get in the aroma is sweet bourbon and a bit of dark malt. The mouth is silky smooth and viscous. The flavor is initially dark malt and roasted barley and quickly turns very sweet with the bourbon,black licorice,fig and plum notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great barleywine, fantastic oak and bourbon flavors. Phenomenal flavors and aroma. Docked points for the moderate warming. Alcohol was evident mainly in the aromas and finish, while the flavors up front were quite pleasant and balanced. Overall, one of the best barleywine's I've ever had. Highly recommended."

"Flat Abbey is officially dead, this cork shot out of the bottle with a huge burst of sound. What a great experience, dark almost black burgundy amber body with a light tan head filling my glass. Aroma is straight up bourbon vanilla/oak/charred wood you name it straight up bourbon barrel aging effects. Served at 50-55 degrees, this beer has sweet bourbon notes hidden fruit, plum/alcohol/raisin notes. But a dominant Kentucky bourbon barrel aged beer is perfect for Fat Tuesday, the alcohol isn't nearly as hot as the nose would entail. There's also hints of molasses and other burnt sugars along the way. The woody character on the palate carries each sip, to the bourbon drinker this beer would be a god send, and I do believe it deserves the hype I'm just not a huge bourbon drinker so this wouldn't be my desert Island beer. However, I appreciate the flavors so much that I'm impressed by the amount of bourbon I'm able to pick up, mouthfeel is oily intense and lingering between sips but complex enough and not just straight bourbon barrel aging. I had deliverance on tap and believe me I love it but they are apples and oranges both excellent in their own right I'm amazed at the mellow carbonation on the palate and the smoothness between sips, this definitely deserves the title Angel's Share."

"I will definitely pick up as many of these I can find IF i can ever find it again. Very hard to find."
"This beer is excellent in hiding the 12.5% abv and presenting the oak barrel flavors that li her nicely on the palette."
"This beer is easily worth large price tag."
"O: Pretty dynamic atrong ale/barleywine. Doesn't ""hid"" the booze, but doesn't wallop either. Really good and worth seeking out."
""
""
"Overall- This beer is pretty fantastic, rich in taste, almost like a wave of caramel/chocolate soaked in booze. Goes down a bit too easy for something so high in alcohol. completely still beer, no carbonation."
""
"I found it interesting how many BAs said this beer (when fresh) was too hot and boozy. Let it be known - this beast has been tamed! It is now a warm, cuddly lap dog in your glass. It licks your face, fetches your slippers, and cowers when you raise your voice. I rank this ahead of Insanity but noticeably behind Bourbon County Brand Barleywine."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours very little head to the point that is virtually non-existant. The beer itself is a deep and dark brown with occasional black areas. The beer is very obscure and dark that it gives off a slick shine in the light. The beer has a very strong smell and noticeable from the other side of the room. The beer has strong notes of vanilla and oak that are supported by fairly sweet malts. The taste is similar to the smell but with stronger notes of vanilla. The beer also a bit of alcohol to the taste and the sweet malts are particularly noticeable with bits of hop in the aftertaste. The beer feel is divine. Despite having been aged for so long, the beer feels extremely smooth and slick with no carbonation. Overall, a great and outstanding beer worthy of the ages."
"While this is not nearly as flat as other bottles of LA I have had, and really not bad. This just leaves me wanting more. Fairly standard. Too expensive, and plenty of other better examples of the style. For me, locally brewed at that."
""
"Overall: not the most aesthetically pleasing pour, but all other factors trump its underwhelming appearance. After letting this beer warm up a few minutes, I'm tempted to say this is the most delicious beer I've tasted in quite some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - again WOW. A rich complex beer that's definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Give it to Lost Abbey to make another wonder bourbon barrel aged beer. Definitely a quality beer."
""
"Overall: Smooth and sweet ride for a 12,5 % ABV bourbon and malt bomb. Aging did some splendid work on it. Was a feast, but holy shit - half gone and I was drunk. Not your typical Sunday stroll."

"Overall, this is an amazing beer. It's one of my favorites, if not my favorite. I picked up a couple of extras, so I look forward to trying this again in a year or so."
""
""
""
""
"Unique beer that has a unique taste. Was not my personal favorite. I get a weird prune taste during and after I take a sip. I experienced this same sensation with Thelonious Monk. Maybe I just have not developed my palate enough for this type of beer. First beer I have tried from The Lost Abbey. Will hopefully have more luck with another beer from this brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as thick but reminds me a lot of Weyerbacher's Insanity. Very similar in look and taste. It would be interesting to do a blindfold taste with the two. Nonetheless, this British barley wine is delicious albeit a bit pricey. Off to buy another one (hiccup)."
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic ale, and although it's quite a bit pricey, it's worth at least a try or two. Would love to buy more to put away for a couple years."
""
"the liquid is much thicker than Eclipse and the taste is also much thicker. sorry about the frequent references to the Eclipse; that is my new standard. this clocks in at 12.5% though and that explains a lot of the thickerness.... taste is also of the dark fruits with lots of bourbon barrel influence. one of the best tasting 12+% brews I've ever had. I wonder if it were a tad lower in abv if it be a little smoother? and, at that point, perfect. the sweet caramelness is almost a little beyond base. either way, this is still a great brew."
""

"TOTAL = 45/50"

"A well-wrought strong ale, with heady bourbon barrel notes, and a more or less tempered sweetness, overall, somehow. I'm sure there's more to say about the nature of this affair, including the idea espoused in the name and on the label, but I'm too tired, and this beer is too good, for me to get any more florid than I already am."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Because of Angel's Share on tap, I picked up 2 bottles (2011, 2013), and a bottle of 2011 Deliverance, which I am excited to try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer and certainly the carbonation does wonders to the experience. The flavors are very well integrated and drinks rather smooth for the abv. I still prefer Deliverance to this considering it has a bit fuller mouthfeel and more depth of flavor. My belief is this has become a bit under appreciated. Though not a shocker considering the price tag, but still not a beer that's talked about much like it used to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Altogether this is a very intense, yet balanced beer. A true sipper and well worth the long wait for the barrelled beer."
""
"Erick, thank you so much for making this beer a reality. This is SO good. I hope you, living in San Diego, get the chance to try this and many more rare bottles from The Lost Abbey. I am jealous that you are so close to a brewery that can produce beers this delicious. I don't want it to end!"

"Overall: Another winner from Lost Abbey. A little pricey, but worth it."

"M - Medium to full body. Creamy. Light."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! This is an absolutely incredible beer, really hits on all cylinders! Huge, bourbon character in both the nose and in the taste, the base beer is an incredible example of a barleywine and the mouthfeel is up there with some of the best beers I've ever had. Extremely little alcohol in the taste. I've heard that Lost Abbey has had some problems with carbonation in this beer before, but rest assured, there is NO issue with this year's vintage. It's 100% ready to drink now. Buy this asap."
"Overall, this is tasty and I am glad I finally got a chance to try this."

"O-Yay for not getting an infected bottle! A yummy beer but the risk of infection is there."
""
""
"Overall: This edition of angel's share was enjoyable. I prefer the brandy barrel version because although the bourbon accentuates the flavors of the base beer, the brandy really adds a new dimension."

"Overall: Angel's Share is a superb barrel aged beer and one I would love to have again. That said, I do think a year or two in the bottle would likely yield an improvement - seems I will have to get another bottle or two to test my theory!"
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. This guy will take you an hour to drink, even if you do the right thing and share with some friends. If you’re trying to take notes and rate it will be even longer. This is one of the deepest most complex beers we’ve had the pleasure of tackling. It’s actually funny because the aging has blended each component so well that it almost comes across as simple, as everything is so hard to dissect. The nose gives wonderfully authentic wood and bourbon warmth, cleanly complementing the darkness of the grain and fruit. The flavor delivers as you would expect, with just as much punch. The booze is certainly present, but nicely contributes to the final blend, with just the right amount of sting through the end. This is a fantastic beer, and a great introduction for us into the winding world of The Lost Abbey."

"Trade from jrgratz. Thanks!!! 2011 dated bottle, enjoyed April 24, 2012. Pours dark brown with ruby edges and no head whatsoever. Smell is strong vanilla, oak, molasses, and lots of bourbon. Thick and viscous mouthfeel with essentially no carbonation. Flavor is big vanilla notes with sweet molasses and brown sugar, finishing with big whiskey notes. Some mellow burnt charcoal taste too that is new to me and relaxing like sittin’ by the fire. Lots of alcohol warmth. Some real astringent alcohol. A sipper for sure, but an awesome sipper."
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. The quality of the beer shines through in every category. A complex beer that stays dangerously drinkable."

"Appearance -vintage 2011 poured into weyerbacher tulip! Pours dark brown with a very thin tan head. Smell-big bourbon in the nose loads of vanilla,dry oak wood, tobacco and whiskey bourbon! One of the best smelling beers!! Taste- holy shit wow is this beer smooth !! Vanilla upfront with some dark dried fruits such as raisins and dates finished with a nice finish if the alcohol burn and vanilla and toffee!! This beer is suppose to be sipped an well worth the price. Mouthfeel-very smooth for a 12.5% brew! It is seriously so smooth for how much bourbon is in this beer and the lower carbonation works well for the style if it was too carbonated this beer would be way too harsh and the vanilla notes would not be there at all!!"
""

""
""
""
""
"Note: 2012 vintage"
"O: Overall for a beer as big as this one, the alcohol is fairly well hidden. I'm a big bourbon fan so I was pretty excited to pick this one up and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. Huge bourbon presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Really pleased with this one, and I expected a beast! 2012's vintage shows that Lost Abbey has a good thing going with this brew, and also proves that they DO know how to carbonate their beers..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very nice beer, but somewhat better on the nose than on the tongue, where the bourbon notes prove simply too strong in the latter half of the mouthful, and the beer becomes more watery bourbon than anything else. The strangely light mouthfeel is also jarring, and when combined with the light carbonation gives the beer a watery mouthfeel, despite the intense flavors. Still, there’s much to enjoy in here—providing you like bourbon, raisins, bourbon, vanilla oak, and bourbon—and fans of extreme barrel aging should give this one a try."

"I bought it in Fort Collins. The bottle is stamped 2012."
"Drink- I was skeptical to grab a bottle but tickers gotta tick lists. This was better than I thought actually. Carbonated. Layered and very flavorful. I had the brandy on tap, but would like both on tap to do a side by side."

"From notes, 9/5/10. An interesting and complex beer but it doesn’t quite work for me. The base beer seems quite enjoyable. It’s like a big barleywine with some deeper roast and dark fruit notes. There’s more going on in there than I can quite describe, but the bourbon flavor seemed to overpower some of this complexity. It has raisins, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak and even mild coffee and chocolate. This version just didn’t come together for me as much as the Grand Cru. It’s not quite a mess, but the alcohol heat was a bit much and the bourbon flavor sort of threw things out of whack more than it blended the flavors into a harmony. For bourbon barrel barleywines, I’ll take FW Parabola, AS Grand Cru and even Marin’s -bal Old Dipsea. I would have preferred this beer aged in a neutral oak barrel or perhaps just less time in the bourbon. It’s still rather good - hard to dislike a beer with so many interesting layers to it. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky (and some bottles probably aren’t carbonated properly but my notes are from the keg version). Interesting beer and I may revisit this rating once I try a future version."

"Wonderful! My husband and I just opened this 2010 bottle after a tough day taking inventory of our beers. We decided on Angels Share because it was the right size for just the two of us. Pours dark reddish burgandy. Rim of very light lacing. Wonderful, heady intense aroma including bourbon, brandy, raisins, other fruits. Taste is magnificient with brandy, raisins, and chocolate. Intense sense of warmth. My husband says it tastes like an alcoholic chocolate bar. Very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the look and feel of this was not great, but the flavor and aroma made up for that...which is the most important part anyway. A really good brew but add some lasting carbonation and this would become great."

""
""

"O - Incredible beer, wish I had a few bottles of these in my cellar but can't complain because what are the odds of finding this gem tap like I did today."
"O: Huh, that was a close one. Fully expected this to be terrible like the brandy version but it's pretty good. Super boozy and heavy on the bourbon. Flatness (though not completely flat) hurts the mouthfeel but honestly not as bad as you'd expect since the bourbon cuts the beer nicely. It's basically a sweet chocolate bourbon bomb, that's the best way I can describe it."
""
""
""
"2010 Vintage: This beer poured out as a deep looking brown color. There is no head or lacing at all on this beer. Looks like a murky flat cola. The smell is loaded with bourbon notes... It's very boozy smelling but sweet at the same time. The taste is sweet, lots of vanilla and bourbon in this beer. The malts a hidden as well as the hops also. There is a hint of molasses in there also. The mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied but not much carbonation at all. Overall it's a big flavorful beer, could use some help but the carbonation was minimal. Perhaps newer vintages have a bit more to offer. Still very good but pricey, worth trying if you can afford it."
""
"O: I presume I would have given this beer at least 1/2 points higher on every metric, if it had even modest carbonation. As is was, I was really disappointed."
""
""
"O: Generally speaking, this was awesome. Despite a lazy appearance and lackluster mouthfeel, this strong ale came through big time on smell and flavor. It compares very similarly in taste to Firestone's Abacus (now §ucaba) barleywine, so if you haven't ever had a chance to try that, this can fill in as an imitator. Kudos to Lost Abbey for putting out a memorable strong ale."

"I know this beer would have been killer if there was carbonation, and maybe a little less age on it."
"Overall: I have a hard time with the buttery flavors overpowering my taste buds with some bourbon stouts. so for my tastes, this is a good rating considering the butter notes are off set well by the other flavors."
"D - well, it is a little low on carbonation, as feared, but it is in not excessively sweet and it is wonderfully complex. The dark chocolate is not excessively sweet but has an intensely dark character to it that works well with the whiskey notes. Dense and complex with a sweetness that lingers just a bit more than it should."
"O. 4."
""
""
"Perhaps other reviewers got versions with more carbonation, which would have helped a lot; as it was, I thought it was a terribly-executed beer. And I was going into it expecting it to be fantastic. Perhaps the biggest letdown of a beer I've ever had - the price is absurd for the quality."

"Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share pours a very deep mahogany, with a faint bit of caramel foam crowning the beer. The nose is absolutely heavenly. There's tons of caramelized brown sugar to form the base, and it's augmented by vanilla and oak. Bourbon is a subtle addition to the picture. The flavor profile is a little bit more rough. There's still some lightly burnt sugar, vanilla, and wood, but the bourbon presence is more brassy and harsh. Here it's the center of attention, with everything else playing more of a supporting role. The body is full and rich, but the carbonation is barely there. I like a more restrained carbonation for a malt forward beer, but this is a bit low even for me, and leaves the beer feeling flat. Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share is a decent to good beer right now, but I think it could use a little bit of time to really hit its stride."

"O: Very drinkable. Excellent beer"

"O- A delicious beer, the flavors are rich and decadent, it's a real treat to drink."
"O: buying this beer was a gamble due to lost abbey's purported carbonation issues, but this is fantastic with loads of complexity and great flavors. I'm gonna need to pick up another one."
"Overall: I didn't think this would beat Deliverance for me, but it definitely done. One of the most complex beers I've had, and I think that term gets thrown around too lightly. Again, I wish appearance could be neglected for this beer, because it doesn't do any justice to what the beer is really about. Seek out hands down."

"Overall - This was much better on tap. The carbonation probably has a lot to do with it. This is my first flat Lost Abbey bottle. I did pretty well, I think. Good beer. Terrible QC."
""

""
"O: a great brew, it's awesome getting to do this side by side and see how the brew changed, along with my palate, when this brew originaly came out, was when I first started drinking craft beer, and i thought it was disgusting, now I think it's phenomenal."
"Overall: What a special beer! Really excited to get to try this one. Wish I was able to get some more lost abbey offerings!"

"Bottle pours a deep reddish brown to black with a tan colored head that stats for about 2 minutes. Aroma of sweet bourbon and dark fruits like figs. A bunch of vanilla and some alcohol. The taste is sweet with some vanilla accents and a slight heat. There is a caramel taste at the end along with the heat. The carbonation is spot on and the feel is silky smooth."
"This comes across as an old ale to my untrained palate. The strong alcohol flavor is biting and abrasive, but in a beery way. It's just a notch below distilled, and there is complexity there. This is the best beer of that style I've had thus far. This is a treat. I'd only want this a couple times a year, if that."
"Overall: Good beer and with the 2012 being properly carbonated (Kudos to Lost Abbey's QC improvements), it is a real treat. Pricey, but for those who can swing it a worthwhile purchase."

"O: definitely a beer I wish I could obtain on a regular basis. I think this brew provides a nice gate-way to more complex brews. I find the drinkability rather high and the ABV is very well hidden"

"D: Overall I'm not sure about this one. It's very good, tastes like someone added a shot of bourbon to an old RIS. It's so different however that I find it hard to determine if I'd buy it again."

"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottled in 2011. Pours a really dark mahogany, with just a ring of lacing, with even the most aggressive pour. That ring has amazing retention. Smell is bourbon, burnt brown sugar, fig, molasses, prunes, and vanilla. Taste is so crazy complex. Everything I got from the nose, but so balanced, except a pungent bourbon and vanilla flavor that grabs you by the short hairs and makes you crave the next sip. Body is medium, not much carbonation, a dry finish, and a very drinkable sipper. This is so special now, I need to find out what a few more years will do."
""
"O: This is a disappointing beer. Between the one-dimensional taste and entire lack of carbonation, this beer is a letdown. Not one I'd seek out or recommend."

"O: One of the more bourbony beers I've experienced. It smells great, and it tastes good as well. It gains character as it warms; recommended."

"It has a thick full body with a slick mouthfeel. The carbonation is present and I don't feel I need it to be any greater than it is. The booze provides some bite to this as well."

"Pours a murky and dirty dark brown with a beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of roasted malt, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and wood. Taste is of roasted malt, vanilla, toasted coconut, and bourbon with a nice woody aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good bourbon barrel aged barleywine that I enjoyed very much."

"I've tried this beer three times because of its ""acclaim", but no matter how many times I try Angel's Share, it still tastes like Jack Daniels with cough syrup in it. Horribly unbalanced; just an overall substandard beer."
"Overall- Great complete beer with alot going on. I love bourbon as well as beer, and I think this is the better one out there doing the barrel aging. Aged for a year, and you can taste/smell the notes that the bourbon placed in here. Tasted better as I sipped and it warmed up. I enjoyed it, worth the try. Although, it's pricey."

"T: Lots of dark and booze soaked fruit flavors. A good bit of sweetness from the bourbon and some notes of wood. A bit boozy on the finish, but pretty tasty stuff."

"is there a better beer in the world than this? bring it to me. this pours into an 8oz chalice a lovely red/brown color with a minimal and fading off white head. smells like a billion delicious things, belgian yeast, caramel, milk chocolate, oak chips, sweet malt, booze. flavor at first is that of a liquid rollo candy, chocolate and gooey caramel combined, but soon after a barleywine sweetness and strength assert themselves and a wood aged sort of depth is in your face. this is so complex and evolving its insane. notes of dried fruit, toll house semisweet chips, and jim beam come through. there is no other beer like this. mouthfeel is near perfect too, plenty of bubbles, and a fuller medium body, strong alcohol burn as it warms. magnificent beer, with everything you could want and more. 12.5% is well hidden until it gets warm. i cant say enough good things about this one. damn damn damn. only thing i dont like is the price, $12 for an 8oz. pour."
"O- rich and decadent is how I would describe this, but it's just missing an extra dimension that would send this beer into the stratosphere. I had this on tap and it was amazing, this doesn't quite measure up."
""
"O - A really nice beer a bit pricey but worth trying at least once."
""
""
"I appreciate Ruby Johnson sending me this replacement beer for the bad one that I purchased. I definitely enjoyed it but can certainly see how it would be even more enjoyable when imbibed from an appropriately carbonated bottle or, better yet, tap/keg. I would love to try it in this format if I ever get the chance but I can't say that I would necessarily buy a bottle again until I hear that their carbonation issues have improved."
""
""
""
"Fantastic stuff. Huge and incredibly complex beer. You better love bourbon as it isn’t subtle at all. I think I like this a touch better than the Brandy Barrel version. While I can live with the near lack of carbonation, some bubbles certainly would ramp this up a bit in the appearance and mouthfeel categories. Letting this warm up to near room temperature really helped open this up a lot."
"Overall – A delicious and complex yet very drinkable beer. Of course I'd like some carbonation, but the fact that there isn't any leaves the beer feeling very velvety on the tongue. This is the perfect bottle for sharing on a special occasion and I'll buy it the next time I see it."
""

"There was also a heavy yeast flavor that wasn't over powering, but definitely noticeable."
"D: The difference between this and the brandy-barrel aged version was astounding; these two really illuminated what a difference aging can make. This is a very smooth, drinkable beer, but the bourbon characteristics make it a bit of a sipper."
"2011 Vintage. Pours an extremely murky, dark brown color with a tiny bit of bubbles...no head whatsoever...dammit. Scent makes me completely forget about the lack in carbonation, with it's heavenly aroma. I quickly get smooth bourbon and oak aromas with sweet vanilla and candied dark fruits. Wow, this scent is just bursting with complexity and deliciousness. Taste is just as the aroma begins, except with a little more dark fruit. Lovely dark fruits with oak and vanilla. Some caramel as well. A bit of molasses with some amazing bourbon notes. Slight alcohol burn, but just the right amount. Mouthfeel is vinous... not much carbonation at all. Kinda works for this full-bodied, big, delicious beer. Drinkability is fairly high...as long as I sip slowly to not get too drunk. Overall, I always enjoy a carbonated beer more than a non-carbonated beer. This just happens to work for this beer,...somewhat. I would still like it more if it were carbonated, but supposedly that's not what Tomme is going for with his Angel's Share."
"in the U.S. no one knock a good bourbon case beer. i could just see this becoming dated as a style eventually. but america likes there beer to be manly so it makes beer big. i just think that this is getting typographically standardize in the end and we're disregarding the cultivation of the yeast and ingredient relationship. but then again... we have standardized yeast haven't we."
""
"Overall, this beer is very, very good and should be hailed as a great blend. I want to give it a 5 in this category but find it hard based on the lower scores in appearance and mouthfeel which stem from the lack of carbonation."
""
"O. This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. It compares favorably with Dark Lord, Westveleteren, Utopias, and is actually obtainable and affordable for mere mortal beer drinkers. Make sure you share it with someone. At 12.5% it's a one and done."
""
"Overall this is very good. I hate to reiterate what everyone else has said about the carbonation but it definitely needs more. I will buy this again because the rest of it offsets the lack of carbonation for me. This is a sipper. I can't chug this too fast."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - This one no where near resembles the brandy aged version, which is a good thing. Extremely high quality and it hides its ABV well. I'll be having this again."
"Wow... What a disappointment. After having this on tap a few months ago and enjoying it, I decided to buy a bottle. I ignored beerandraiderfan's warning and bought my 14.99 - 12.7 oz. bottle. To his exact description... No carbonation. I mean none. I thought this was only similar in the aroma. Sweet, bourbon, caramel. The taste was off. Some kind of acrid, sour flavor. So disappointed in the bottle version. Just for the record... On tap is 10x the beer. Poor bottling."
""
""
"I had this on tap a couple of months ago and if my memory server me correctly, which is not a given by any stretch, the draft version was even more delicious than this. And it was better carbonated, and had a better mouthfeel. Still, whatever age or conditions may have done to this particular bottle sample, it is an awesome smelling, delicious brew with great complexity and good balance. I'm down to a couple or three ounces, and I wish there were more."
""
"Dr: Highly drinkable. I'd definitely have it again. Probably best bottle conditioned and aged."
"O: The barrel aging really lends some very rich vanilla flavors only bringing out a slight booziness and a lighter body which is expected after 9 months in a barrel. Very rich dark chocolate tones with sugary caramel and bourbon mingle together very nicely. It's easy to see why this Bourbon Barrel Strong Ale is so highly regarded. Angel's Share is truly a gift from the Heavens."

"Final thought - $15 a pop is really high, BUT like any great beer, wine or spirit well worth the money. It is more of an experience than a beer"

"I was admittedly apprehensive of this beer, but after having it, I went back and bought a couple more to hold on to and I plan on buying a Brandy version or two shortly. This is a good beer, not quite great. But certainly one I would recommend to anyone who enjoys bourbon barrel aged beers. Odd side note, with the last 1/8th of the bottle I had the crazy idea to eat a maple glazed doughnut with this and it was probably one of my favorite food and beer pairings that I've tried. Just had to throw that out there."
"O - This would have been an outstanding beer if there was more carbonation to it however as it is it was still a very good beer that I would get again if I had the chance worth grabbing a glass of if you see it around"
"Poured into a snifter a dark, opaque brown with no head to speak of other than a few stray bubbles. Aroma of caramel, vanilla, and oak-soaked bourbon. Taste was slick and sweet right off the bat, with an obvious alcohol kick, dark malts and bourbon are dominant, and balance each other pretty good. Some subtle fruit notes come through. Full-bodied, strong, but smooth and fairly drinkable...to be savored slowly, and definitely at a warmer temperature. Better if you are a fan of bourbon obviously. I did like the brandy version of this beer much better."

"D - this is a solid beer, love the bourbon and vanilla flavors in it. For some reason, it just seemed to fall a bit short as a complete beer, though. The price point has kept me away from it in the past and I think it will continue to do so in the future."

"Finally got to try this , I had been on the look out for it on draft, as I wasn't willing to chance a flat bottle. But for the high price, I probably won't seek it out again"

"Had on-tap pre-thanksgiving. Small 5oz pour. Fantastic strong bourbon filled aroma that really set the tone for the beer. Nice malty taste with a little bit of oaky-barrel flavor coming through and a nice strong bourbon finish. Kind of straddled the line between a thick and thin beer, with aspects of both that muddled it up a little. Great overall beer, but not the most exceptional barrel aged RIS."

"On tap at Beer Revolution. Pours a very dark amber with a small tan head that disappears quite quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is big bourbon, some leather, caramel, a bit of oak, vanilla, and a moderate amount of alcohol. The initial taste is sweet with caramel and vanilla. Then comes some bourbon and a light cherry flavor. The finish is warming and leaves a lingering oak presence. Surprisingly, the taste is not all that boozy. Medium-full body. Low carbonation. This is quite a tasty beer. It's sweet, but not cloying. I'm not going to regularly pay the huge price for bottles, but it is certainly worth the price when it is found on tap."

"Overall I really enjoyed this beer and was extremely pleased we got a bottle that had some carbonation. Flavors are big and bold so I appreciate the small bottle offering. It is obvious that this beer was crafted very delicately and aged to the exact right time the brewer wanted. Flavors are huge but balanced between the dark caramelized malts and big bourbon boldness. I enjoyed this very much and will hopefully have it again down the road. Recommended, but a a crap-shoot unfortunately as many bottles don't have the carbonation I was lucky enough to receive."

"Overall: This is a beer that borders on greatness. I had a less than stellar experience with a flat Brandy Angel's Share bottle, but the difference is like night and day. From the moment I had my first whiff of it, I knew this was going to be a special beer. The bourbon treatment is remarkably well done, neither destroying the flavor nor the mouthfeel of the base beer. A huge beer packed with taste and complexity. For me, this is worth seeking out when it is available."

"Pours a dark murky brown with a light tanish off white head that laces the glass nicely. The nose is big of bourbon, oack, raisins, dates, dark fruit and vanilla. The taste is a big hit of bourbon, raisins, toffee, dates, oak, canilla and a strong alcohol presence with a slight burntness. It's got a creamy feel withe a fairly thick body and good carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer for me, however if you don't like bourbon this definitly isn't the beer for you."

"O- I was a little let down by this. It was decent, but I was expecting more. This was the 2010 version and the bourbon was still pretty strong. I was tempted to splurge the cash on a bottle before, but glad I never did."
"It doesn't get much better than this for sheer intensity of a beery sort. On tap at Pizza Port OB."
"Overall, I'm a bit floored over the whole experience. A few years ago this was a bucket list beer for me and I'm thrilled to have stumbled on it. The downside for me is I feel like I've had this beer before. I'm just getting tired of Bourbon Barrel Beers, they are all starting to run together and it's not special anymore. Great beer, but I would have appreciated it more 3 years ago."
"NOTE: Live review."
"O: Well this gets major points because it's actually somewhat carbonated. The bourbon flavor is bold and lingers throughout the whole sip, but still is pretty tasty. This is definitely a sipper."
"D - I still use this category as drinkability. It's 12 percent and a killer. Not sessionable. Beautiful on tap but is usually flat in the bottle."
"Tried this on draft in a small snifter. Dark brown/black with minimal foam. The smell is great. Malt, chocolate, caramel and huge burbon. It almost jumps out of the glass at you. The taste is similarly great. The burbon is up front along with coffee, chocolate and caramel. The alcohol while not overpowering is present. Great beer with tons on flavor."
"When it comes to taste, the differences are very subtle. In the 10' the bourbon is immediate, but it does allow the vanilla and chocolate. Finishes strong. The 11' is pretty much all bourbon from start to finish."
"Overall: This beer has mellowed a bit over the past two years. There is no carbonation/head, but the flavors are very complex. The mouth is enjoyable, with only a hint of alcohol which is impressive for such a high ABV beer. Well done."
"D - Judging from the aroma alone, I'd have said this tanks in drinkability. The taste really makes up for the nose in complexity, character, and balance. Still, it's as much a sipper as there's ever been and my friend ended up finish my final 2-3 ounces for me."
"This is an extremely well done beer, if you have the means, get it and try it. As to my question of is it worth the price... not with my budget no, but it truly was worth the experience once."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Only strike against it in terms of drinkable nature was the bourbon taste. It was a little much at times (especially as the brew warmed). Still...very delicious. Overall, I would have this brew time and time again. I loved it. Complex, delicious and high quality!"
"I had dinner on Saturday night at the Sunset Cantina on Comm Ave, and I saw this little gem on the ""just tapped"" list. Served for $9 in a Chimay chalice. Very dull brown color. No head at all, just a pool of carbonation in the middle of the head. Kinda lifeless looking. Then I took a sniff. Whoah, there's some bourbon there. Very powerful and upfront. The flavor doesn't relent either. It might actually be too strong. I could taste some hints of cherry and figs, but the booze flavor really dominated. While I liked it a lot, I would have preferred if it was toned down a bit. The bourbon barrel aging seems to be a blessing and a curse for this one. Perhaps aging a bottle would really be beneficial here. But glad I got to try it on tap, as I had never seen this one in MA before."
"O: A very complex beer which would be awesome if there wouldn't be so much alcohol present. Might be awesome with some age if the alcohol mellows."
"Verdict: Pretty strong sipper here, but most importantly enjoyable. I did prefer the 2010 Brandy version but this vintage was done well. I'll be excited to see how my second bottle turns out in a year or so."
"Overall I much preferred the brandy version to this."
"For considerations of cash and carbonation, draft is the way to go. A huge, sweet beer and a pretty ideal nightcap (or mid-afternoon cheese accompaniment)."
"I thought this beer was mediocre for the style. It is somewhat one dimensional, with a very overpowering sweet taste."
"O: this is a great beer. a slow sipper."
"This one - strangely enough - would be phenomenal with some french toast and bacon. If I didn't have church tomorrow, that would be SO on the breakfast menu."
"Lightly carbonated. With a few swirls, a minimal head re-forms and subsides quickly. Definitely on the sweeter side of things. Nice complexity on the nose and palate, with the aromas blossoming and the flavors becoming more pronounced as the beer warms-up a bit."
"O - Pretty good beer. I didn't quite know what to expect with this one. Pretty good, bourbon is very dominating and will probably age well over the next year or two. Still a little hot at the moment."
"WOW, let me say i love Lost Abbey. This is a very sweet beer to smell and taste. Smells bourbon and sweet. Tastes very sweet (get the point-very sweet). Very caramel and fruit. Taste very much matches smell. A little stronger bourbon than expected. I love it. Warms you up a little in the end!"
"O - if it was carbonated it would be a nice beer, maybe a B+. Not so with this bottle."
"O: Very unique, complex and interesting. I'd be curious to try the brandy and bourbon-aged varieties in one sitting to compare"
"Well, this started off poorly. Uncaged the beer and slowly coerced the cork out of the neck of the bottle, without a single sound. No pop, no formation of carbonation at the top of the beer. Flat as a pancake. Poured without any head whatsoever. I hate to label, but ""Flat Abbey"" is appropriate. The nose is real boozy. Wreaks of bourbon. However, it has a ton of subtleties to it including chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The taste follows the nose nearly to a T, so I won't bother to repeat. The mouthfeel is void of any carbonation whatsoever. What's strange about this, is it has the mouthfeel of a stout...and exactly the way I like my stouts. If this WERE a stout, I'd likely grade this higher in the mouthfeel and appearance departments. I can see this needing age behind it...but why age a flat beer? This is so boozy, without everything playing out properly, I don't see myself battling the entire beer. Likely a drainpour."
"O: Good beer. Bunch of extreme flavors present. Buy bottles and wait a year after trying it fresh. It's good now but seems like a great candidate for aging."
"D - This is good stuff but maybe a little heavy on the bourbon, and that hampers the drinkability a bit ,"
"Full body, mild carbonation (lol), sticky and syrupy on the tongue. Absolutely wonderful flavor and scent, and the carbonation seemed to hold up on this one - If all Angel's Share bottles were like this I'd buy more."
"O: This is an interesting and well-made beer. Definitely worth a shot."
"O: Two wrongs kind of make a right here... it's flat and it's sour. Either one might have garnished a bad score alone but I don't mind flat sours. Chalk this up as my second experience of Flat Abbey."
"O: This is an interesting and well-made beer. Definitely worth a shot."
"O - Really impressed by this beer, despite all the negativity surrounding it (and LA). Enjoy it for what it is, and don't immediately proclaim it to be a ""drainpour""!"
"O - Great beer, but the sweetness is too much for me."
"If you like raisins than this one trick pony is for you. I ended up dumping it out. Ick."
"Overall: The beer could have been so nice, could, because the alcohol is so badly hidden that I can hardly distinguish this with a bottle of pure ethanol from my work…. After the sour 2009 version, I will not try this beer again."
"Very dark with a strong black Cherry aroma. I had this at Brouwers in Seattle during a lost abbey and port tasting. The initial drink is great, heavy strong licurice and sweetness. The finish was a little funky. This was my first lost abbey and a great way to start off."
"O- While delicious....sure wish there was more carbonation. I do not understand. Isn't this supposed to have some carbonation? If it was more carbonated, I would definitely score it higher. Already afraid that I am rating it higher than it deserves to be?? Certainly over priced! If I drank 3 of these...I would be face down in the gutter."
"Overall, better than the brandy, but over priced."
"O: Well, I have had Brandy and Bourbon version several times. I will no longer be purchasing Angel's Share. Tomme can't manage to do properly and appears to be too proud to make it right."
"Poured hazy reddish brown color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy dark fruity, toasted malt, alcohol and wood aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Moderate to heavy dark fruit bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy dark bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a complex standout beer."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy Lunch for sending me this one in a past trade! 2010 Vintage! Tasted back-to-back-to-back with Brandy and Grand Cru. Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a deep murky brown with a basically non-existant off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, sweet alcohol, and dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was pretty tasty. This is one of those instances that you can tell that the beer had sat in bourbon barrels rather than just knowing that it was in a barrel. Really good flavor and aroma going on in this one. I was honestly afraid when I cracked the top on this one and didn't hear a pop from the cork. Was also concerned when there was basically no head formation. However, this one turned out quite well and was really enjoyable."
"Thanks to Ken for sharing a bottle of this one at schmittymack's first tasting (one closer to Ratman with the double tick). Poured a rich dark brown color with a light brown head. Aromas of bourbon, raisins, figs, oak and vanilla. On the palate, this one was full bodied, with flavors of bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits and alcohol."
"Overall this is just average. The lack of carbonation just kills this."
"O: This one is a bit tastier than the other one, but they're almost identical in aroma and flavor. Still, a damn fine ale."
"Overall, a good beer with nice interplay of flavors and a well integrated bourbon barrel flavor that allows the beer to dominate."
"O- if you're a HUGE bourbon fan, this one is for you. I can't really touch hard liquor, so it's not for me. Definite sipper. Plus, I paid (I think) 16 bucks for a 375 mL bottle. That's insanity."
"I guess this batch was still due to bottling problems when they started using the 12.7oz rather than the 750ml, but I am still really glad I got to try it. I defiantly experienced some flavors and sensations that are normally a little harder to detect. I certainly would like to try the carbonated version, but Im not complaining about this accident!"
"Overall: I had this a couple of times on tap and wish this had the carbonation levels of that. Still, sitting at home and being able to concentrate on the beer, you really get a feel for all of the complexity in this. It really is a very good beer. I don't know if the price warrants buying it very often, more likely whenever I see it on tap I will go for it."
"Overall, I was not much impressed by this one - particularly considering the price tag. I don't think I've ever poured a beer so almost completely flat right out of the bottle. High ABV explains this to a degree, but some carbonation would have helped the mouthfeel and would have also concealed the booze a bit and provided more balance."
"This beer pours an almost black color, with very little head. The smell was malty, and a bit strong on the alchool. The taste was increabily complex. There was changes of coffee, choclate, toffee, oat flavors. The taste was very strong, and stayed on your paltetee for a while. Overall this was a good beer. It was very differnlty, and didnt have much a beer flvaor, much more like a sipping liquer, but still good."
"Overall: A good beer. I am so glad it was not completely flat or infected. I enjoy it though I do not know if the risk of the aforementioned problems is worth the dollar amount. A lot of alcohol warmth, I would love this on a cold winter night. Did a side by side with the Brandy, I liked the Brandy better but this was still a very solid offering."
"An astounding beer--a beer that makes you stop and think and appreciate the liquid inside your glass. Sublime nirvana."
"Burgundy in color, The Angel’s Share has appreciable notes of caramel and vanilla followed by a big bourbon kick from the barrel aging with a hint of dark fruit at the finish. The oaky bourbon character of this ale makes the alcohol content very noticeable, so The Angel’s Share won’t sneak up on you. This is the beer that you will savor at the end of the evening."
"O - I have had this on-tap and it was much better than this. The flavors are complex and very enjoyable but it is just WAY too hot. Once it tones down a bit this will be a great beer but at the moment it is still too raw."
"wow! what a beautiful, complex unique beer"
"Similar appearance and aroma. Thicker flavor profile with more caramel and molasses sweetness, which has the side effect of elevating the chocolate in the profile. I'd bump the taste and mouthfeel up half a point each on this vintage."
"Appearance is dark brown with just a couple specks of foam. The Lost Abbey has an aroma of vanilla, bourbon, some oak. Upon sipping, I taste raisins, alcohol, malt & some butterscotch. For the barrel aging and other characteristics of this beer, it is well balanced, the end has some warm booze. A very good beer to cap your evening."
"Sampled at Hellbilly’s Hellraiser tasting. Bottle courtesy of Sparky27 & Bockyhorsey. Let me start off by saying all three of you are gentlemen and scholars!!! This was the BIG WINNER of the night. It began with a pop and a thick caramel head slowly climbing out of the top of the bottle. Incredible rusty brew with yeasty bits floating throughout the glass. Oak, molasses, vanilla, and toffee all playfully fighting for attention. Flavor is extremely complex with various dark fruits, chocolate, and mild bourbon. Unlike other barrel-aged beers, this one isn’t overpowered by the whisky, but instead, accentuates the brews other qualities. Delicious, refined, and exceptional."
"jd"
"O: This particular vintage is less than average for style and abysmal for its price. The other two vintages I sampled last night are complete failures by any measure. Given the above, I will not purchase Angel's Share in the future and most likely avoid it entirely. Avoid. "
"Yeah, a big feisty bitch with a sweet, beguiling outer facade. Dangerous, bewitching demon-woman beer."
"Wow, wow, wow. From inauspicious beginnings (and much undercarbonation), this managed to blow me away. It's gorgeous, supple and incredibly complex. What a brew."
"not sure how often id actually buy it though because of the price."
"O: A little disappointed. Had the Brandy version a while back and I was very pleased. I hope this will mellow some with age. The flavors are there it is just not the right time yet to consume."
"D: This had the perfect combination and balance of flavors for a bourbon ale. Very delicious and complex. The body was decent (could have been fuller), and the alcohol wasn't very noticeable. So it was pretty easy to sip, but should never be drunk any faster. Lots of potential for aging this one. Excellent beer."
"Overall: This was a really great tasting beer. I think a year or two of aging would do wonders for this beer. A great sipping beer."
"Overall- Good beer, Glad I have had it at this age, but would rather have it young."
"Overall - delicious. slow sipper, good bottle to spend an hour or two with or to split two to three ways. Not sure if it is worth the price tag, but definitely a well crafted beer. A good beer for the cellar - should age gracefully."
"It's a big beer, and a sipper to be sure. Clearly displayed alcohol is not normally something I find pleasant (or acceptable), but it works here (and I've certainly tasted 'hotter' beers). It reminds me in many ways of Sam Adams Triple Bock, which as been shunned on BeerAdvocate, currently scoring a ""C" (mediocre) with 569 reviews - how that can be, I don't know. This is thinner, yes; more fruity and perhaps a bit less 'malty', OK; and it presents Bourbon instead of maple syrup but they're still in the same general ballpark. Thus my score is in the same general ball park... an A."
"Overall: This was a really great tasting beer. I would buy a bottle to store or another one if it was on draft at a bar I would be at. Great sipper and good to share with friends."
"Incredible beer but finishing is a struggle. Now I know why it says to share on the back label. Pity I'm not more of a spirits fan cause aside from that, the beer has a nice velvety, oatmeal body and smooth character. Now that I think of it, blend this with some mild oatmeal stout and it could be a winner. Give it five years and some carbonation and who knows."
"Pours an extremely deep brown, like a fresh layer of varnish on wood. Smells like I would imagine a port aged in bourbon barrels would smell- lots of grape (touriga nacional)/ raisin, vanilla, burnt caramel, and oak. The flavor is semi-sweet and very reminiscent of raisins (actually thought of the old California Raisins claymotion ads while drinking this), but then there's some chocolate on the finish. Really, really hated the mouthfeel- the level of carbonation made the sweetness sit on my tongue longer than I would've liked. Not worth the price to me personally, but to each their own."
"Overall I liked this beer even though it was a little flat. Drinkability is high on this brew. I would like to get another bottle to see if the carb changes. Good brew."
"After reading the other reviews, I have to agree that some carbonation might improve the beer. I maintain that it doesn't need it, in the same way at a fine sherry doesn't need carbonation. But the possibility of improvement forces me to reduce the 5 I gave to flavor down to 4.5, and to reduce the mouthfeel ranking similarly."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is medium bodied with extremely low carbonation, admittedly. There is some there, but the mouthfeel is very slick nonetheless. Could be better. Overall, the flavors in this beer are quite good, almost awesome, but the carbonation or lack thereof really hold it back. Still, a pretty damn good beer and one I would gladly have again. It's drinking very nicely right now."
"O: a fine beer for sure, just wish it had carbonation. I will seek out other vintages."
"375 mL, Pretty sure this is an 09. Pours black with a small amount of tan head that fades quick. Smell is vanilla, coconut, dark fruit, booze and a hint of maybe chocolate. Nice on the nose. Its got that boozy bourbon flavor that carries through the middle of the beer. Otherwise, the base beer itself isn't boozy and it is accompanied by dark fruit and a balanced, small amount of sweetness. Some sips it really comes together and some sips it comes off with too much bourbon. Even when it comes together, it is nothing stellar. Relatively thin (for what it is) in the body with low, but present carbonation. Overall, I like it but don't love it. Really don't understand the A grade above across this many reviews, even adjusting for the average review of an A- for a lot of reviewers. Ah well..."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Leagues ahead of the brandy version, but the complete lack of carbonation is a killer for me. I would never think carbonation would make that much of a difference for a beer of this size and style, but it absolutely does. Halfway through I was contemplating mixing it with a mild stout to force some into it, but didn't have anything cold..."
"O: I don't hate this one like I hated Brandy Angels Share, but it still isn't very good. Way overpriced for what you get."
"It seems similar to maple syrup. This bottle may have been aged too long, but the flavor is still intact. There was no carbonation at all. The smell was quite strong and seemed sour. But as I drink it, it grows on me and feels very earthy. It is also very strong. The taste is better than the aroma."
"Overall, this beer has some significant merits. I am fortunate that it was carbonated. Booziness and lack of solid carbonation hindered its drinkability but the flavor and nose make up for that."
"D: For a beer of this strength (12% ABV) it drinks fairly well. It is what it is - a sipper rather than a chugger - but with the nice nose, solid melding of flavors and subdued bourbon (relatively speaking), it's drinkable."
"Color is a dark chocolate brown with no apparent head. smell is of chocolate and roasted malt with light bourbon undertone. Taste is of malt, slightly chocolate with a molasses presence. medium bodied. decent drinkability for a -bal beer, but i'm not as keen on this as I am -bal stouts. still, a good beer."
"m/d - Extremely smooth...very boozy, liked spiked fruit punch. Leaves a really nice alcohol tingle and bourbon aftertaste. Very easy drinker. I'm a big bourbon fan and a fan of the stouts in bourbon, the strong ale is a nice mix. Very enjoyable and easy. solid beer."
"This is another very nice, although flawed beer from Lost Abbey. These guys clearly know how to brew, they just don't know how to finish their product to best present it to their consumers. Carbonating a beer should not be this hard. Still, I can't and won't take away much on that basis because it's a very tasty beer. I enjoyed it, and would like to try it on tap when the carbonation can be forced into it, despite LA's best efforts to keep it out."
"Pours no head so no lace. Deep brown almost black color, ton of yeast left in bottle. No carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Nose is bourbon, flavor is slightly sweet bourbon. High ABV is up front. Needs some carbonation, there are 11.5% beers out there that have carbonation like Harpoons Leviathan Triticus. Very warming. This is bottle #3000 for my collection!! Seriously expensive at $18.99 for a caged and corked 375ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"D: I will have no issues finishing this bottle off, and I'm quite happy this is in the 375ml format, as it is the perfect size. Very enjoyable after dinner type beer. It is getting a touch oxidized, so I'm not sure how much longer it really should be aged. Still a damn fine beer. Definitely lives up to the hype."
"At 9.00 a glass it was a little steep but I must admit I would pay it again if I saw it on tap. Very tasty and would recommend trying if you ever come across it."
"This is an after dinner sipper. With that in mind, it drinks just as you would expect."
"M - Very low carbonation, slightly thinner bodied."
"Pours a murky brown with almost no head. Looks like its carboanted just not very highly. Smells like sweet buttery bourbon. Nothing else detectable on the nose but vanilla and oak! Tastes sweet and bourbon heavy. Tons of vanilla and oak. A good sweet malty profile underneath that is just covered in bourbony goodness. Thick almost syrupy mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper but very drinkable. Now I just wish it was half the price!"
"The CPJ"
"Burgundy colored body was very still, and displayed no carbonation at all. The beer sat in the glass looking just like a red wine. Fearing a bad seal in the cork, I smelled the beer, but could not detect any heavy oxidation aromas, so the flatness seemed to be by design. The smell was very vinous, and reminded me of raisins soaked in whiskey. The taste was sweet and oaky, with lots of vanilla and raisins, and no hops. This was pretty much a red wine through and through, and was not at all like any other beer. The body was dense and still, and made for a nice sippping beverage."
"Drinkability -- Better than I had even anticipated. AND it was carbonated! Lots of depth, good barrel character, a perfect after dinner beer. I'll have my eye out for this on tap in the future. Must not be missed."
"Pours a soupy dark brown with no head. Smells of obvious bourbon, in a good way, with some malty undertones. The barrel aging really comes through. Aside from the bourbon, I'm picking up a hint of molasses and light bitterness. It doesn't have that hot alcohol feeling like I would expect from a barrel aged beer of this sort, but still gives of those bourbony vapors in the mouth, which is a pleasant surprise. Extremely light on the carbonation. It's drinkable in that it's very flavorful and enjoyable, but I wouldn't want more than one."
"This is a very bad-a$$ brew here."
"D: Insane drinkability, for the first glass at least. Very complex beer with so many flavors packed in. I went back for another glass the next day. Seems like a good one to stash away for a bit"
"Strong aroma is quite fruity, what I expect from a barleywine, with a syrupy feel and an overtone of caramel and brown sugar. It pours a dark opaque chocolate brown with a thin tan head that quickly hits the road. Flavor is fruity with hints of caramel, brandy and molasses and a strong but not too fierce alcohol bite. Texture is smooth as almond milk with a nice sharp and ragged edge. This one is spendy, but if you are a barleywine nut I'm sure it will be up your alley."
"D- This is an interesting beer overall. Kind of comes off as a BA scotch ale-which is a very cool concept-and I havent tried many. The bourbon is a little hot and heavy and I probably could have been a bit more patient with this one."
"m- This beer lacks the carbonation that I look for. It almost is too syrupy with the mouthfeel. I do like the warmth that the alcohol gives me but overall I really would like more from this"
"D: Hrm. Sooo sweet, sticky, flat, pruney, porty... I could have had half the amount and been OK with it. Does that say something about it?"
"D- A definite sipper. Creamy and sweet and boozy. Take it slow."
"Reviewed from my notes. My glass comes to me filled with an opaque black liquid and a tiny bit of foam on top. The aroma has some very appealing sweet vanilla and bourbon aspects. Vanilla is also the first thing I taste with this beer. Some syrupy sweetness is also present. A touch of coffee bitterness as I swallow. A touch of powdered chocolate in the aftertaste. Bourbon flavors are present throughout. As legend tells us, this is a full bodied beer that is nearly flat. It leaves a filmy coat in my mouth. It drinks well--none of the flavors are too overpowering. The high alcohol will do a number on me (on glass is enough), but it is enjoyable nevertheless."
"This was the first vintage of this beer that I've sampled and it exceeded all of my expectations. Incredibly complex, well balanced and damn quaffable. Subsequent batches have failed to live to the '08."
"Poured a dark brown/black. Almost no head. Big time lacing on the side of the glass. This beer smells of bourbon and dark fruit and raisans. I love it. Man is this beer heavy and it hits you hard quickly. This is definitely one to share. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth for 12% but man does this drink like a stout. Do yourself a favor and share this with a friend. Definitely high quality to be enjoyed slowly."
"Overall, a really sold beer that has a lot of bold complex flavors that I feel like many will enjoy. The only set back is Tomme needs to work out some of the fine details on his beers. If you like bourbon and strong Belgian styled ales this will be right up your alley. I really enjoyed drinking this beer even thought the minor mistakes were there but hey we all can't be perfect all the time right? If you come across this beer be sure to grab it and give it a shot becuase it is definitely worth the hype and fairly reasonably priced."
"D: Big beer here. It's a sipper to be sure."
"D - Well, at $22 fr a 375 ml. bottle, I was expecting a little more, but I have come to realize that LA beers are a little more buck for their bang. Although, I must admit, that aside from Older Viscosity, this was the best offering I have had from them. Big ABV makes this one a slow sipper, but much like good bourbon, it is very well worth every sip."
"D: Splitting this small bottle was just the perfect size. Our taste buds were wrecked by this and we wondered how this would've scored if it had some frigging bubbles in it. I love paying a premium for flat beer."
"Damn, 1 glass of this sets me straight. Great flavors but maybe a tad much booze and sweetness for me, definitely a nice sipper."
"DB- Price was good on tap. Very great cocoa flavor with traditional bourbon aged flavors. Bourbon is balanced into this beer amazingly, hard to say for many Bourbon aged ales."
"Full bodied, low carbonation, but not flat. Very sweet, almost syrupy. This is kind of hard to figure overall, due to the low carbonation, but this is still very good."
"Poured from a bottle we picked up at the Lost Abbey/Port brewery. We poured into a wide mouthed wine glass to allow the beer to breath a bit. The beer is an extremely caramel-brown color, with an appearance of thick, syrupy consistency. No head or other signs of carbonation. Definite aromas of oak/wood, as well as sweet malty/sugary smells. The beer has an initial sweet malt flavor, heavy in molasses and caramel notes, that remains robust but becomes crisp on the finish. The bourbon barrel aging definitely had a huge influence on this brew. Deep down, there are hints of some spice that dances in and out of your mouth. The overall sweet flavor makes this a very rich beer for me personally. I do enjoy the robust and strong flavors. The finish, as I said, is crisp, with slight sweet and sour highlights."
"Pours a murky mud color with no head whatsoever. No lacing present, the beer actually looks kind of dead with the exception of tiny bubbles around the edges of the glass indicating a trace of carbonation. The color is attractive despite the murky pond water appearance, there is a deep mahogony color with a tinge of tawny gold around the edges. Reminiscent of a nice tawny port. The aromas are enticing, lots of vanilla and bourbon, reminds me of an old ale. There are also chocolate undertones with splashes of dried fig and plum. The flavor accurately reflects the aroma with a burst of dark fruits and chocolate with lingering bourbon and white pepper on the finish. Well balanced and quite drinkable for a 12% beer, incredibly smooth and silky finish. If it was slightly more carbonated this would be a delight. Definitely glad to have the opportunity to try this one, the finish is one to remember."
"The mouthfeel is very soft, but not flat by any means. This is a very thick beer, appropriately so. I enjoy this beer from time to time, though it is a bit pricey."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - It's a tad bit strong and heavy, but it's rather tasty, and smooth."
"Overall a largely mediocre beer that grew on me somewhat from start to finish but still doesn't make the grade even at half the price. Apparently I got the wrong vintage of sorts though I won't be risking such things again as for carbonation issues. I generally find that Lost Abbey beers seek sweet complexity through large amounts of simple unfermentable ingredients and this is no exception. And many nuances are lost in this route. And given the so oft light carbonation, what is the need for the expensive bottle I've heard many discussions about? Just put it in a simple bottle. Cheers."
"Full in the feel and very lightly carbonated. While the low level of carbonation might be customary and understandable I would have enjoyed a bit more of it. This brew is clingy and coats the inside of the mouth yet it is high enough in abv to almost seem evaporative as well. Being someone who enjoys spirits, I really liked this brew as a slow sipper. I wouldn't mind having a couple more bottles of varying years but the price holds me back."
"Drinkability - Smoother than what I expected. A great winter beer in my opinion as I gulped this down after spending time outside in the cold."
"D: This is definitely a sipping beer. Very smooth, but the alcohol makes it hard to imagine drinking copious quantities"
"Another great example of the Master, The Tomme at his finest. Great beer!"
"(ps. the calories on this have got to be out of control!)"
"Outstanding."
"D-slightly bourbon heavy and somewhat hot but nice complexity of malt flavors balanced by a fair bit of sweetness."
"If you are not sure of barrel aged beers the thing is barrel aging requires in my opinion a very strong rich bodied well developed beer in order to shine and not be overrun by the whiskey/bourbon/other barrel characteristics. The bourbon and wood tones are strong in Angels Share to be sure, but the dried fruit and alcohol character from the base beer blend well with the former. While the carbonation is low the alcohol is allowing it to age much like Port Wine."
"Moderate mouthfeel despite nearly no carbonation, a bit of tingle in the finish. Some warming of the cheeks and numbing of the tongue. Tasty beer, but IMO perhaps a bit overhyped."
"375ml bottle: 2010 bottling. This one pours a murky, dark brown color. It appears to be ""thicker"" than a typical beer, looking more viscous when it pours. There is absolutely no head on it, and really no carbonation to speak of either. You could call it ""still"". Very nice aroma. Bourbon is up front. I also get notes of chocolate and raisins, as well as some other fruits. Vanilla and brown sugar also. What a succulent taste. A bit of bourbon and alcohol on the top. Lots of other flavors combining to form an exquisite combination. It is really rich and silky on the tongue. It may be a bit pricey, but it is definitely worth the money. I'll be buying this again (and again)."
"Bet this stuff is just outstanding on draft. Probably near outstanding when they bottle properly. This was very good."
"For this Thanksgiving I am giving thanks by having this beer. Really beutiful deep ruby brown hugh, but still. I mean flat. The aroma is saturated with vanilla, oak, bourbon, and notes of raisins and dry cherries. The flavor of this beer is unreal. Tons of sweet malts, the aformentioned vanilla, bourbon and oak. Some dry fruit flavors make apperances. I detect faint chocolate notes. A hint of heat and alcohol on the back end, but less than I would have though with how still it is. Smooth and slick mouthfeel. I'd say this is one hell of a sipper."
"Overall this a really great beer but the bourbon really detracts from its drinkability. This 12 oz. bottle could definitely satisfy 3 people. Recommended."
"I was really having a tough time coughin' up $16 for a 375ml, but really wanted to taste it bad enough, sure glad I did. This beer really highlights bourbon barrel aging in a way I have yet to experience. Allagash Curieux was smooth but I could barely tell, whereas this REALLY let's the whiskey notes sing. Love this ale alright,.. probably too much for how bad it stings the pocketbook!"
"D: I really enjoyed this brew and would definitely have it again, but it is a one-and-doner because of the heavy sweetness and ABV. Still, I am very glad I had a chance to try this one."
"The bottle was overpriced, it is a bit overhyped."
"D - Amazing. I was thinking that this wouldn't stand up to its reputation but it has easily met that. This beer really highlights what bourbon barrel aging can do. Love this one. I will have to pick up more of this the next chance I get."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4 or 4.5"
"D - I almost feel that this needs some age on it, as the alcohol is FAR too up front with this. Smooth, creamy, and potent with nice complex flavours but still far too agressive."
"2009 750ml bottle. After anxiously twisting off the cage, the cork pulled out with a muted, anticlimactic ""pup"" sound. Shit. Poured a still deep brown into a brandy snifter. Definitely some nice, big bourbon on the nose, with rich dark chocolate, tobacco, plums, and figs. Good nose. Flavor is big, rich, and decadent. Dark unsweetened chocolate, plums, a bit of a vinous grapey character. Tobacco and leather in there. A bit of hot bourbon around the edges. Good flavors, but this thing is basically near flat and the palate just does not properly carry the flavors. Shame, this would have benefited greatly by some carbonation."
"D: I would definitely have another one, on a cold night when I want to drive the cihll from my bones, but at 12.5% it would be just one more. Anything past that and I'm sleeping at the bar."
"Delicious! Totally worth the effort that it took me to finally land one of these."
"D- this is a slow sipper for sure. ideal for colder weather but i can see this being enjoyable anytime. more than one isnt an option because its too strong, and too expensive at $17 per bottle. ill pick up another one next year."
"Wow, powerful stuff. One bottle will do ya."
"D - A very well done ale. Very bold. For a 12 percent ABV this is very drinkable."
"Glad I got to try one. Still have one in the cellar to try again down the road."
"D=Not sure if I could do this again without a friend to share it with. Strike that...an angel to share it with."
"Overall I really did like this beer a lot. I think it probably would have been better if it had more carbonation but overall a very good brew. Especially happy I was able to try it on tap and avoid the $16-17 375 ml price of buying it elsewhere."
"Overall, I have no reason to believe this beer will get any better with further age. Its already mellowed and fused very well. Too much carbonation, lighter body, and its ""mellow"" character detract from this a bit for me, but it's still quite nice. Glad I opened this when I did. A nice vintage which I will likely never have again."
"D- I enjoyed the big bourbon taste but it was incredibly hard to drink, as it was pretty much flat. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or what. I'll come back to this one some time but until then not really impressed with this one."
"It was carbonated....Dark brown in color with a tan head. Aroma: Bourbon, molasses, dark fruits, and vanilla. Taste: alot of molasses, bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, oak and vanilla. Body is big but the beer is actually very smooth. Alcohol is moderate in the finish. I've been wanting to try this for a long time...with carbonation that is, and it did not disappoint..."
"D: Tastes really great, but would be tough to get by a bottle (even 375) without help! Awesome. I continually will be trying to get my hands on this and all the variations of it."
"(D)- Despite its richness, strength, and full-bodied profile; it is quite enjoyable and delicate. Has a nice sweet smoothness with a warmth great for those cold winter nights. I would get more of this for special nights if the price was not so ridiculously high; which happens to be my biggest complaint for this. $17 for this tiny bottle? Really?"
"D-Just amazing. I really enjoyed the glass but don't think i could of had too many. Enjoy this in moderation."
"definitely a sipper. at 12.5 you aren't going to have more than 1 in a night, yet, a could sip on this all night... on a fri/sat."
"Although it will probably occur at a slow pace, the drinkability of Angel's Share is very high. Often I find myself trying bourbon barrel beer and thinking that the bourbon has destroyed the flavors of the beer, but Angel's Share marries barrel flavors with beer flavors perfectly. I was able to have a snifter of this beer on-tap at a very fair price, but I would probably spring for a bottle also, despite the price."
"D: This beer is hard to finish--and this is one of the new, smaller (and cheaper) bottles. It changes from sip to sip, ranging from delicious to harsh and unpalatable. Strong dark ales can be a pleasure with every sip--this one, however, is not."
"Overall, thanks to portia99 for hooking me up with this brew. Lost Abby has done an excellent job crafting this ASA. My only major gripe....the price tag!"
"D: This is a booze bomb if there ever was one. However, taste is quite complex and enjoyable once you get past the alcohol. Would love to have the carbonated version of this."
"D: drank pretty good considering the ABV on this bourbon bomb and was better than last years version IMO. I definitely like the bourbon version over the brandy. Overall it was a good offering from lost abbey."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and carbonation is low but present. Drinkability is decent, it had some great flavors but the bourbon alcohol flavor hurts drinkability a bit. Overall a good beer but the bourbon is a bit overpowering. It would have been nice to see some more of the beer flavors come through and the finish to be not as hot. A complex and very good beer overall but you have to be in the mood so sip on something slowly. If the bourbon heat fades away with age I could easily see myself scoring this much higher in a few years."
"Drinks: like salvation by grace. These carbonation issues Lost Abbey seems to experience on a regular basis MUST be figured out, as with lesser beers (see: Older Viscosity) a lack of bubbles could completely ruin the experience. The Angel's Share, however, still manages to shine despite the lack of carbonation. It's complex, rich, and deliciously decadent. Figure out the bubble situation, and I could see it easily finding a place in my top 10."
"O: Alcohol is too strong, quite good but with the alc finished lighter, stays good with warmth, alc limits the occasions i would drink this."
"At $17, drinkability suffers, along w/ carbonation issues. $10 or under, and more carbonation = 5.0 on drinkability."
"D - Given the intensity and strength, the warmth/burn is pronounced, but not overwhelming. A great sipper that requires a pause between drinks, but always has you looking forward to the next. Being a huge scotch drinker and complete fan of bourbon barrel aged brews, I am always excited to try a fresh batch, and this is one of the best I've had. However, let this baby age for a while and you'll have a much mellower, flavor-filled masterpiece on your hands."
"Creamy on the palate with an appropriate level of carbonation. Somehow, despite the creaminess, the finish is sticky and resinous. This will only improve with age."
"Taste is sweet upfront, chocolatey into the middle, where the barrel and bourbon take over and dominate. Nothing sedate about the flavors here. Numbness in mouth lasts and lasts after swallowing. Mouthfeel is slickery, too flat for my taste, and drinkability is okay, buoyed by the depth of flavors to pique interest. Not much redemption here for Lost Abbey."
"D: I liked this one slightly more than the brady version. However, I'm not actively seeking it soon. I think it could age very well though."
"Overall, a really nice beer but the carbonation on mine really killed it. The aroma was amazing and the taste was really complex. The booze heat and flat mouthfeel took hold though and made it less enjoyable."
"D. This is an incredible sipper. It might be because I enjoy bourbon neat, but I appreciate the bourbon flavor and burn that you get. I liked this so much that I picked up a case while on vacation."
"Overall an excellent beer, that could use a little more carbonation. The flavor profiles on this beer are awsome. Looking forward to cracking a couple 2010's in the near future, as I hear the bubbles are back."
"Not sure where all the carbonation issues arise with these guys. Not sure if I would like this fizzy! That said I am happy to do the three hour round trip to Mass to get Lost Abbey/Port Brewing beers. Very good!"
"Drinkability is good, I'll have trouble drinking more than one but the taste doesn't get to desserty or filling after a while, which is great. Bravo."
"D- Very rich and smooth with a warming alcohol presence that warms all the way to my stomach. An excellent desert beer, and worth splitting- even if it is a small bottle."
"This was an amazing beer - but in NO WAY a session beer. Drink this and you're done - at least I was..."
"M + D: Very full bodied and almost even creamy. Carbonation is quite minimal, but for the size of this beer, I don't think I would have wanted much more, honestly. It seems to carry a nice balance between being a strong ale and bourbon itself... minus the heavy alcohol content of being 80 proof. This is quite an enjoyable brew. The price tag would leave me juggling whether or not I picked it up again, but I can say that I would at least consider it."
"D: Better shared if coming from a bottle, but on tap best beware it might take a little while to finish this one alone."
"VDubb seems pretty interested in this one, so here's some more vicariousness. It pours a bleakly murky brown with not much of a head to speak of. The nose is rather bourbon-centric, with some oak, milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, pretzels, and a smidge of roasted malts piled in there as well. The taste similarly whiskey-forward, with an added kick; the rest of the smell's constitutive elements, minus the chocolate, return for a second season, but the bourbon seems to have an ego issue that would preclude further contract extensions. The body is fairly hefty, with a very light carbonation (I thought the '10s fixed this...?) and an almost chewy feel. Overall, I feel this brew just missed the landing zone, fracturing a leg on landing. It'll heal, but the memory will malinger for a while. I'm thinking about aging the other bottle, if only to see how things go if the bourbon settles a tad. Beyond that, the other flavors seemed kinda weak, and the almost-flat, murky liquid was not very appealing. This one just wasn't fully for me."
"Glad this was split. Thanks for the generosity though Ryan."
"Bottle compliments of mothman. Pours a pitch black brown with minimal head or carbonation. The aroma is of bourbon, dark malt, and vanilla, with some boozy notes. The first sip and it is evident this was aged in bourbon barrels as that is the first thing that comes to mind. After that the taste is sweet with notes of licorice, dark fruit, and chocolate. Med/Heavy mouthfeel. Very tasty stuff."
"D: well drinkability is a an interesting term when it comes to a bourbon barrel aged barley wine that hits 12.5 in the ABV dept. But I must say, this is balanced nicely as it isn't overly hot and there are a lot of delicate bourbon features present. My only complaint is that the bourbon hides the base beer too much."
"Drinkability: The first half of the 375 ml was not a challenge to drink, but by the last quarter of the bottle I wished I had split the beer with someone. It is rather powerful in flavor and just an intense beer that really is best in small quantities."
"The drinkability is good. The beer is fairly smooth but a little sweet to drink entirely in one sitting without something to cleanse the palate."
"No pop whatsoever upon pulling the sad cork out. Pours dark brown with maybe a trace of foam around the edges. The aroma is the only saving grace with this beer. It's very bourbony with traces of molasses, maple, vanilla extract, and sharp alcohol. There is no way in hell I could drink a bottle of this flat, boozy, utter mess of a beer. The taste is packing some serious heat along with some of the aforementioned aromas coming through in the taste, but the mouthfeel flat out sucks and I can't believe The Lost Abbey is still letting stores sell this flat bourbon water. Sorry, no good."
"As a chicagoan, given the choice of this or readily available bcs, i would probably go with the latter."
"EDIT: 3/28/2012. Two year old bottle is still surprisingly hot and bourbon forward, and still very under-carbonated. I wasn't expecting it to get anymore bubbles, I'm just saying all the bottles I've tried are flat. Alcohol burn has gone down slightly, but not as much as I was expecting. Still a good beer, but if you hate bourbon stay away."
"D - incredible beer all around, was torn between which I liked more, the smell or taste - had to call it a draw. Great bourbon characteristics with a good amount of other things going on for balance. Was stoked to find this on tap, well worth it."
"Well there is some carbination here in this bottle, not alot but enough to make an enjoyable experience and leave a nice ring around the edges of the glass over the thin oil that is angle's share. man this is like oil butter in the glass and in the mouth. total sipping beer, drinks very much like a wine. Aroma is much better in this bourbon version compared to the Brandy, it is just a touch mellower but alot less bacterial smelling, and also tasting, overall. the aroma and flavors come out in a nice dark fruit and raison that in a more subtle way reminds me of a red wine, with a nice very pleasent bourbon alcohol presence with its vanilla componant. Great beer to sip on when you have some time to relax, don't rush this one, and don't distract yourself from it."
"Great aroma and flavors but not worth the $23.99 I paid for the 12.7oz bottle."
" D- This is a full bourbon beer with some good support from sweet dark malt. It is very drinkable once I could get passed sniffing it all day long."
"D: A thick, hot, flat bastard of a beer that is worth a try if you want to see what all the fuss is about... If I want to drink bourbon, I'll do that. Any clown can put beer in a bourbon barrel, few can justify the price tag..."
"very, very low carbonation, reminds me of SA utopias, both from the flavor profile and low carbonation. really enjoying this beer. drinkability is a tougher nut to crack. this has instantly jumped into my top 5 favorite beers, but i can't see drinking more than one. i've had some other lost abbey brews and always seemed to be underwhelmed, but not here. well done."
"d- the flatness is weird, the taste still makes it worth trying, but not sure i'd get a bottle again. is the cork too small to keep air out? tick it if that's your thing, but there are alternatives."
"MF/D: very flat with a dry finish similar to a merlot wine, but smooth the whole way down. certainly can feel the heat after a few sips leaving a solid, yet enjoyable, buzz."
"I have to be honest; this is not the most attractive beer I have ever laid eyes on. It is an opaque dark brown color with just a ring of tan bubbles around the edge. It pretty much looks like muddy pond water, BUT this look in a beer is actually sort of exciting, because it signals me that I am in for an interesting experience. The aroma is sweet and hot with plenty of bourbon up front, as well as caramelized sugar, dark fruits, toffee, some chocolate, oak and vanilla. The flavor really showcases the bourbon and oak aging, and is quite enjoyable. It has a sweet, caramelized sugar malt character that blends well with the bourbon and alcoholic heat. Other flavors include dark fruit, cocoa, leather, vanilla and oak. Surprisingly, it has a fairly decent bitterness that keeps the malt from getting out of hand. Well played Tomme, well played indeed. The mouthfeel on this is quite decadent and smooth with a wonderful lingering finish. This is very drinkable for style, and as I sit here enjoying it in a building that has been serving guests for over 200 years, it is hard not to get sucked in by the romance of it all."
"D - I'll be sipping this for the next two hours no doubt. It's warm and goes down well but would be best shared and is much more suited for anywhere between late fall and the dead of winter. While the hotness doesn't enter the taste so much, I still find this to be a beer that would only get better with another 5 years."
"Not much else to say. It's a shame it's one of the highest priced brews out there, but then again only now do I see why. If you're one who hasn't pulled the trigger because of the price you should definitely try it at least once, and make sure you have a big slice of tiramisu to go with it - I guarantee you'll be in your own little happy place."
"D: The carbonation was low on this beer, which made it a pretty big and syrupy malt bomb. Was worth a try once, price tag is a bit much on this beer."
"Drinkability: I could and would drink this all night if possible. It's not drinkable in the swillable sense, but it is certainly so in that I would gladly quaff another right after this one."
"Drinkability: Slow going, but complex and delicious. This is a beautifully crafted beer! I think this Angel's Share can easily hang with Firestone's anniversary beers, which I consider the best barrel-aged beers out there. A must try. Split a 375mL with a friend, and a 750mL with multiple friends."
"The 2009 batch of Bourbon Angel's Share isn't just disappointing, it's positively maddening. This beer could be GREAT. The lack of any carbonation is a fatal flaw that absolutely needs to be corrected, especially considering the high asking price on these small bottles. Until Lost Abbey makes a complete brew out of this tragic miss, it will remain just that. Crossing my fingers for the future vintages..."
"This is a very delicious beer. The bourbon is quite present at the beginning, but recedes into a very balanced beer once it is warmer. There is a lot going on here, but it is rich enough that I am content with only one. Another wonderful offering from The Lost Abbey."
"3.5 D: Tasty brew, but the bourbon gets to be a pain as the glass finishes. Due to the insane pricing, I see no reason to ever buy a bottle of this though."
"Given the price tag, this isn't a beer I will be drinking again in the near future; however, given the right occasion, I will definitely try some again. In fact, I'm anxious to get my hands on the brandy aged and grand cru as well."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thick, and decently carbonated. Very hot on the palate. Drinkability will of course be limited by the abv."
"Amazingly drinkable and I wish I could have this every day."
"Overall, dangerously drinkable at the high abv. I had no problem with this one. The alcohol shows, but in a good way. Very well done."
"I'm not huge fan of bourbon barrel aged beers, but I would drink this again anytime. Very tasty!"
"I have a feeling this would have been a good, maybe almost great, beer if it wasn't for the fact that the alcohol burn is so strong, that's what vodka shots are for. Maybe 3-5 years of age on this would have mellowed it out, emphasizing the maybe. Considering the cost though, I don't think I'll be picking any more up to try that experiment, plenty of better beers at cheaper prices."
"This tasted like a serious drink, definitely a sipper with all the large flavors. Dark fruits like plums and raisins along with a nicely sweet malty base beer, contrasted with the bourbon punch. The bourbon tended to be the dominant flavor but I did enjoy the underlying beer. Somewhat thick bodied, giving a mouthfeel that matches the flavors and leaves a long lasting impression after each sip."
"D- A very strong, both in flavors and abv, beer; most definitely a sipper, but a good one at that."
"Cheers!"
"D: Well, it was a nice beer to try, definitely an interesting brew, but it has a hefty price tag. Also, I thought some of the parts were not melded together and as balanced as they could have been."
"Not at all subtle, highly complex, and completely delicious. Like an after-dinner dessert, cigar, and whiskey all rolled into one."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable...for some beer drinkers. Not for the faint of heart...will probably do better with some more age in the bottle."
"J"
"D: This beer just isn't for me. It's over-barreled and isn't worth the cost. I gave it enough tries, you all can have my share."
"D: Rough. Couldn't finish it."
"Caramel flavors almost overwhelm the tongue initially. It's hot, boozy, rich, sweet, absolutely decadent and delicious. Full-bodied, nearly syrupy on the palate, somehow this is immensely drinkable. Strong tannins dry the palate, and so does the sharp alcohol, balancing the initial richness. It finishes almost dry, with lingering flavors of oak, leather, pipe tobacco and just a bit of lingering toffee. Such an outstanding beer, it's hard to put down despite the high alcohol and intense character."
"Very happy to try this beer. One of the better barrel aged beers I've had and did not disappoint after a couple years of waiting. Definately looking to score a few more of these."
"D - Little heavy, and the high alcohol and flatness makes this one slightly more average than drinkable. It's not super easy, but it's relatively easy considering the beer."
"overall a good american strong ale but a little too strong with the alcohol."
"A great beverage indeed I am so happy I picked this one up."
"The aroma hits you in the face the second you pop the cork. It is thick and viscous with an amazingly smooth mouth feel. The complexity of flavor is unlike any other beer I've had lately. So much depth and many layers. Lots of dried strawberry in the nose and an unusual likeness to tiramisu. An ever changing flavor explosion. Very unique and exciting beer. I found myself sipping on it just to relish the layers of flavor."
"On-tap at the Armsby Abbey on 5/23/10. Served in a snifter. Poured one shade shy of black with a frothy, tan-colored head that dissipates into a cluster of bubbles around the edges. Nose reveals bourbon, toffee and a hint of wood. Taste consistent with nose - rich, buttery and decadent with a complexity that improves as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a smooth, even carbonation that is lighter than anticipated. Bourbon Angel's Share is one of my favorite brews - a great sipper that improves as it warms. Definitely seek this one out if it is available on tap."
"Overall - This has vaulted to the top of my personal rankings right next to the Pliny's and Founder's Breakfast. I am not sure it gets much better than this."
"D= Great brew! The angles share beers are all very very good. The GC being the highlight of the ones I've had this is a close second fav. This beer is worth every penny I spent on it and I would but it again. Nice work LA"
"I'd been aware of this beer for a few years, and known it to be something of a ""holy grail"". Honestly, I am not all that impressed, but I can totally understand how others might love this. The dense, syrupy mouthfeel and the noticeable presence of alcohol are not what I'd call an acquired taste, but just something that I small percentage of people absolutely appreciate. This definitely has a unique and interesting flavor, and I think with the alcohol turned down I'd enjoy it more. As it is, this is for either the truly dedicated & interested, or those loving the strongest old ales & strong ales. I could certainly imagine consuming this with some very rich dark chocolate & raspberry dessert, but until I do that next, I think I'll pass on grabbing another bottle of this."
"D- for 12 abv its pretty damn drinkable if you like bourbon that is. I love it and out side of the sweetness I would drink all I could get my hands on."
"This was a nice treat that I wouldn't mind on occasion."
"Dark brown color with small head. The aroma is alcohol bourbon with carmel, toffee notes. Sweet bourbon malty taste with alcohol and vanilla. Alcohol warmth. Medium body. A very pleasant experience that tipped off my tasting at the 4th Anniversay party. The rest is a haze."
"Taste comes in smooth and syrupy. Tastes like bourbon. A lot of caramel and vanilla. With no carbonation this reminds me of Utopias. Like a not so great port, very muddy. As far as placing it in the beer catergory its not so bad. Could use a little more time."
"I feel like other beers have passed this one by. It's a little thin, it lacks depth, and too much raisin for my taste. It's a good beer, but it could have been a great beer."
"There was a slight ""pop"" to this cork, although it was less carbonated, which seems to be an on going issue with previous The Lost Abbey's I have had. Possibly an issue with shipping? That said this beer almost drank like Sam Adam's Utopia's which to me was the consistency of a Cognac. I guess you could say this is the ""poor-man's Utopias"" although it isn't as large ABV wise it taste similar. Like a sexy tall woman the legs take over the glass. The alcohol is very present in the nose, but not so much on the palette. Making this beer one that could creep up quick. Overall a very solid beer."
"I poured from a 375ml bottle into a snifter. Almost jet black with no light getting through and an almost nonexistant head. There is lots of bourbon on the nose, as well as vanilla and oak. The taste follows the nose, lots of hot bourbon. It does mellow towards the finish, leaving the slightest little alcohol burn. The brew is full bodied, and low in carbonation. The beer is a nice sipper. A very good brew that is very overpriced."
"D - Ok, I know I'm going off the script here, but how can any 12.5% beer be drinkable? I guess this one is as much as it can be. I was kind of hammered for a while after this one, so I took notes and settled down before typing this up. But there's just no way I could sit and drink more than one of these in a sitting. Just for the flavor I'll give it just above average for this class of ABV."
"Ok, here's the deal. The carbonation is definitely on the low side...but not horribly flat. The flavor in this beer is so good, the small amount of carbonation isn't killing the beer at all. Still can't help but wonder how this beer would taste and feel with more carbonation. Flavors are oak, bourbon, dark and over-ripe fruit...raisins being one, vanilla, and roasted malts. The bourbon aspect of this perticular BA beer is great! Strong booze warmth all over the mouth, down the throat, and into the stomach. A great beer!"
"Overall I was impressed with this bad boy, and was happy that the carbonation was at a good level. After having the Grand Cru and Bourbon I'm very interested to try the Brandy. I'd be willing to be that it's worth a shot, as is this one."
"Cork pulls with the tiniest of ""pft", poured into a tulip. Deep mahogany with edges of reddish chocolate brown that touches the glass. No head, but faint lacing swirls atop. Smells of bourbon and vanilla, with some fainter notes of chocolate. Bourbon up front, like taking a watered down shot, as the palate warms chocolate and figs come up. Slightly dry with alcohol burn, the modicum carbonation helps to take the edge off of the bourbon and distracts enough to taste the other elements of the beer. Mouthfeel isn't as thick, but we will see as it warms. Not something you would want to session all night, but is a good treat to sip on for a bit."
"D: My first experience with Angel Share -- this was a sheer delight to taste. Very much a sipping beer, I'd rank this up with any barley wine or after dinner cordial."
"D: An interesting sipper that I enjoyed trying. However, it's definitely not worth the $31.50 I paid for this 750 ml bottle. Now that it comes in smaller bottles I'd probably give a newer vintage another go."
"This beer, along with it's Brandy aged cousin have caught a lot of flack for carbonation issues on this site, so lets see how this year's version came out. The cork comes out with a light pop, better than none I suppose, and pours out a deep, dark brown, with just lacing as far as heading is concerned. My first thought is that while there may not be a whole lot of carbonation, at least there is some. Anyway, nose is amazing, with huge bourbon characters, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. Bourbon, caramel and molasses dominate the taste, with tiny hints of earth as well. Mouthfeel is thick and boozy, but curbed at the same time by the carbonation that is there. This is not really a bad thing in my opinion, as this beer acts more like a spirit than most others, and deserves to be sipped and savored. Drinking this beer is a wonderful experience, but I warn you to take it slow, as it has kicked my ass on more than one occasion when having it out at a bar. Final thoughts are that despite all the criticism of Lost Abbey for the carbonation thing on last years brandy and bourbon batches, this beer is literally unlike any other. Even with zero fizz, this beer is a wonder to drink. Would I like some more carbonation? Yes, for sure, but it is still one of the most interesting and complex beers on the general market right now IMO. Now all I need to do is try the Grand Cru version of this brew, and I am good to go. Cheers"
"I could definitely spend a few hours on these 12.7 ounces. Certainly an experience, though not one I could afford to have often."
"Angels Share is a fitting name for this heavenly ale. Tiny head but no head needed for this fine sipper. When then chalice was tilted only slightly, it took literally almost 30 seconds for the last bubbles to reach the surface. And I only tilted it enough to show a 1/4 inch of lace. A lexicon of flavors show in the nose and taste, one of the most complex and well crafted brews I've come across. Molasses, figs, caramelized candi sugar, plum, chocolate covered dark cherries and bourbon. Much more. Carbonation was low and the mouthfeel was pure velvet. Perfect. I'm on my way to grab more this weekend, don't be scared to drink it fresh, I know it can be cellar'd but it's hard to imagine an improvement over this."
"D: I have a hard time choosing which I like better, the brandy or the bourbon. But luckily both of them are generally available and neither is a bad choice."
"Full-bodied and smooth but it feels a bit dull in the mouth as it is as flat as [insert something that makes a dirty joke out of this]."
"It's good, just not shit my pants good. $30 for a 25.7 oz bottle in stores, but ""just"" $6 for a 10 ounce draft (about $15 for 25.7 oz on draft), what gives?"
"D: I've only had tasters in the past and have wanted to have a full pour of this. It's weird to have a beer on-tap that's much cheaper than in the bottle. This is good, but for Angel's Share it looks like brandy is the way to go, my palate is clearly gravitating towards the brandy barrel aged beers, but I certainly enjoyed this."
"This is an intense, full flavored beer that's easy to drink. It needs more carbonation, but otherwise what a great beer!"
"Overall, a little disappointed here. The bourbon is better than the brandy version, but the Grand Cru dominates, them both its not even funny. A couple minor changes and this could be really good."
"D - I shared this bottle on my birthday which was an awesome birthday present...but I was left a little disappointed...the beer starts off with nice flavors but the oak (bourbon) age just got to me"
"Beer poured a deep rich brown, no head, not even lacing. Aroma of dark fruits, caramel, molasses...a mild oakieness also. The taste was definitely of the dark fruits (from the aroma), and the alcohol comes in to play, not too sweet again, not too boozey. After this glass warmed to room temperature, the taste was more prevalent of the flavours. I recommend drinking this at room temp to appreciate all the flavours of the fruits, as well as the sweetness of the caramel and molasses. Port Brewing does it again!"
"Don't drink and review."
"Great stuff, another well done barrel aged beer from Lost Abbey."
"d - Overall I really like this one, but it was a little hot. I'm a big bourbon fan so loved the smell and taste and would definitely like to try this one again."
"Drinkability is average, not nearly as exciting as I hoped, this is way over priced, I'm glad I only spent $9 on a draft then $30 on a bottle! I will definitely never bother with this again unless the price comes way down, in line with the plethora of other bourbon barrel aged bombers, $8-10...3 times the cost and average for the style."
"D: I thought this was a damn good beer. However the heat is a little much and the ABV shows through more than many other beers I've had."
"375mL 2009 bottle. Dark nearly black pour with some mahogany highlights and no carbonation.. Very rich dark fruit with notes of vanilla bean, oak, and alcoholic bourbon. There's also some hints of tobacco and black tea. The flavor is almost too rich at first but as it rolls past your tongue it leaves wonderful notes of dates, oak, cognac, vanilla, bourbon and a nice alcohol kick on the end. The body is oily and full with no carbonation and strong alcohol warming."
"D: If not for the price and availability, I could sit down and drive a few bottles of this in an evening...and then sleep very, very soundly."
"375 ml sent by JMBH. Pours very dark brown, with no head. Thickish like a malted milkshake. Some bourbon and chocolate aroma, and voila! it taste like well integrated chocolate and bourbon, neither overpowering the other.Nicley drinkable, its like an aged old imperial stout, and without the booziness apparent. Dangerously drinkable."
"10 oz pour ofthis is more than enough, very enjoyable very boost."
"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Lots of head, beer smells slightly sweet but really strong liquor. Beer is brown, dark brown. There isn't much to say about it really. It was sweet, strong, mostly liquor tasting but surprisingly drinkable. Whatever the base of this bal aged beer is it was overwhelmed by the aging process. I'm curious if it was aged in ""wet"" barrels."
"375ml bottle, 2009. Dark brown with almost no head. Bourbon, dried fruit, soy sauce, wood and caramel in the aroma. The flavor is smoother and lacks the oxidized soy notes of the aroma. Lots of dried fruit, tobacco, toasty grain, some chocolate and oak. Rich and alcoholic but not harsh. Thick and flat on the tongue. Great flavor and immensely complex, but the weird oxidized soy notes in aroma and lack of bubbles hurt it overall."
"D: Very complex with powerful yet complementary flavors; a big hit, and I'd love to drink this one again."
"I'll try again next year perhaps. I think Lost Abbey does make some great beers, so I am not on a smear campaign (see my other reviews for many praises), but this beer is flat undrinkable."
"Sure, it's a sipper, but it's a well crafted beer. Looks and smells great."
"D - A very tasty beer that is busting with flavor. A real sipper."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV & style but to be be sipped for sure! Not the best barrel aged ale I've ever had, but in the top 20 percentile at the very least. Had higher expectations, but I am always thrilled to get to try any & all well made big beers. I kind of put this on a par with New Holland's Dragon's Milk, which is not even half the price. Would love to try this on tap..."
"A: Little to no pop on the cork which followed with very light to no carbonation, deep ruby to black in color, slight viscosity is detected from the movement of the beer in the glass - 4.25, S: Intense aromas, the oak is very evident and provides a nice vanilla to the nose as well as obvious whisky smells from the bourbon barrel aging, there is also a marked sweetness that borders on sherry to chocolate covered cherries, also signs of caramel and coconut - 5.00, T: Intense raisin and date, alcohol is upfront which isn't all that surprising considering that the beer is 12.5%, the vanilla, oak and whisky that were rampant on the nose come through on the palate, there is also a strong holiday fruit cake soaked in whisky taste, I taste a hint of hops but it is really lost in all the malts and bourbon barrel - 4.75, M: The low to no carbonation keep this beer a silky smooth, it is also slightly syrupy - 4.50, D: Insanely complex - oodles going on in this beer only a fraction of which I feel like I'm capturing, this is the beer I wanted to ring in 2010 and it does not disappoint, the high alcohol does keep it in the sipping range - 4.50"
"Pours dark brown with no head. This one is definitely flat. Aroma is a combination of roasted malts and bourbon, with maybe come chocolate and caramel mixed in. The flavor is lots of bourbon, oak and vanilla with some alcohol, roasted malt and chocolate/coffee. A very complex flavor. The mouthfeel is hurt by the fact the beer is flat as a pancake. Still, it is pretty drinkable and a good beer overall. I think it would be better with proper carbonation."
"All in all, the lack of carbonation didn't bother me really. There's plenty to like about Angel's Share in the non-carbonated bottle. I didn't finish it, but I enjoyed it. I recommend splitting it with a few buddies. Approach it like a nice scotch."
"This manages to avoid being a complete fail even with the glaring defects but I think it's fair to expect much more from a near $30 bottle of beer from such a respected brewer. I used to think people were whining unnecessarily about flat Lost Abbey beers but now I kind of get it. Still, this is only my second bottle with carbonation problems out of many dozen from Lost Abbey over the years (the only other problem beer being an 08 Ten Commandments) so I'm far from ready to boycott this brewer the way some seem to be. I'm hoping to try this beer on tap some day so I can truly experience it at it's full potential."
"Really big beer, but, I just need more than the vaguest hint of carbonation to make this work right. Poured with zero head. Color is opaque dark brown/black. Aroma is so decadently rich whiskey, malty, coffee, cocoa, sin, fecund earth, worked leather, turkish tobacco. and sinful love. Flav's about the same. heady. Roasty and chocolate too. Killer. Man, what an expression of beer."
"Overall: an amazing beer so complex you're sure to taste something new when you sale up in the morning"
"I have had some really good beers in my time here on ba, and this is a bold, bold statement, but this is BY FAR the best beer I have ever had. So glad that I received another in a trade recently."
"on tap at big wood @ brouwer's. have had previously as well. very dark, almost black, little bit of carbonation, definitely not flat, which i've been hearing is a serious problem with this in the bottles. the last bottle i had did have decent carbonation as well. maybe i got lucky. smells like brandy with a little caramel and chocolate hiding in there. the cold taste was not very revealing but when this baby warmed up, it came alive. the alcohol lingers all throughout each sip and plays well with others, the caramel, chocolate, a spot of vanilla, bourbon. fun stuff. warm, it is very enjoyable. always happy to have some lost abbey, always lucky to not be disappointed. i just wish we'd had a table at that time so i could've ordered something else while letting it warm."
"Overall this is pretty awful. I can't see what the hype is with this beer. Maybe this was flat, I don't know. If this is what it's supposed to taste like then God help anyone that tries to finish a bottle. If it's a bad bottle (one of many from Lost Abbey) then that would make my fourth bottle of different variety that I have had which was a waste of money. If I wanted to waste money on a tease I'd drop $35 at a titty bar. I'm done with Lost Abbey. Let's pull the pin on the hype train for this brewery. Flat or not Flat, this one simply sucked."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a medium foamy head with little to no retention and no lacing. Aroma of bourbon with light vanilla and balanced sweet rich malt. Taste is a well balanced mix between some deep rich English style malt with light dry fruits and with great notes of bourbon and light vanilla. Body is fuller then average with very low carbonation but still enough to be enjoyable with no apparent alcohol which is surprising considering the clear notes of bourbon. Not bad thought not sure it is worth the price tag or should be ion the top 50 but glad I tried it anyway."
"Wonderfully complex and I don't know what Bourbon is used (not listed on site), but it's a nice one, and with a great malty richness. A treat, and one to seek out if you are a lover of bourbon-barrel-aged beer!"
"D - 12% is on the high side...a touch boozy, but not overpowering. For what this is, it is rather drinkable. Split the 375ml bottle and it is just about right...probably could finish the 375 on my own, but not any more. For a high alcohol beer, this is pretty smooth, not hot, but noticable alcohol. Very good overall."
"In all, I'm very happy to have had the chance to try this one and I was impressed. Not the flat mess that was Older Viscosity. Thanks again, Paul!"
"The beer doesn't live up to the hype, but it's still pretty tasty. In short, it was a large snifter of bourbon candy. The character was rich and sweet, but the flavors were too smooth, making it hard to pick out many flavors. It came off a little dull for such a big beer. The bourbon character dominated and as it warmed the alcohol began to emerge. I'm glad I tried this beer, but wished it had approached everything I'd heard about it."
"D-Amazing. A must have, in a class of its own"
"Yes this was third course 09 BGBBD @ sierra, just sick to know that it was the bourbon instead of the brandy. So dark and happy, I've had the bourbon in bottle before and loved it and this was no exception. Poured dark with little head. Aromas were huge so much vanilla like I remembered it and thank god I got a snifter of this at the end. Went down too smooth and easy. I could care less about carb issues, this was almost complete and for me was up there with BBVD, BA Boris and Nor'easter Cl for best bourbon brews."
"The looks of this pour are fairly unremarkable, very dark brown, near black with a thin light brown head that has little retention and leaves no lacing. Aroma is exceptional, very strong and nuanced balance of bourbon, oak, molasses, vanilla, etc. Very sweet and boozy, almost overwhelming in strength. Flavor is very similar to the nose, primarily bourbon and oak flavors, with a caramel malt backbone trying to poke through. Alcohol is obviously present, though not uncomfortably so. Finish has strong lingering bourbon taste. Mild notes of dark fruits, raisins, slightly spicy. No problems with carbonation in this serving, full bodied, very smooth and pleasing on the palate. For the complexity and booziness of this beer compared to others of similar styles this is very drinkable, but (this goes without saying) this is obviously a sipper for sharing."
"On tap, the carbonation is spot on, and the mouthfeel is viscous, silky, and smooth. Unbelievable stuff, it's a real shame about the 2009 bottles."
"Like I said, I would love to try this on tap. I think it would rocket up the charts for me. The carbonation is just too low for me out of the bottle. I can't imagine what the infamous undercarbonated brandy version is like."
"D: So delicious, so complex, I'd suffer an untold number of hangovers to drink this every day. Beers like this make the U.S. the greatest country, brewing-wise, in the world. It also is a reminder that the Lost Abbey is world class."
"Bottle 2008 Pours an iced tea brown with no head at all. No lacing also, as figures. Has a sweet aroma of bourbon,wood, vanilla and caramel. Has a very light carbonation. The flavor is thick and alcoholic. Has sweet malts and a good burn to it. Has an oily texture. The body is full. Has a strong finish with a sour aftertaste. Shared this with friends and it has good points but seems to miss alittle."
"This is actually quite drinkable as well for a beer of it's magnitude. I probably won't buy another flat bottle, but I did happen to enjoy it quite a bit. I just want to wait until this beer is in it's true form before I give it another shot."
"D - Definitely not a beer I consider highly drinkable, but considering the style it is for me. I consider it great since it is so complex but really one is plenty as it comes off sweet from such low carbonation and the 12% is apparent w/ a tannic bourbon hint. I am glad I tried this and recommend it if you see it -don't hesitate!"
"D: In the end, there is just too much bourbon coming through in the flavor to make this more than a once in a blue moon beer. It took me quite a bit of time to finish my five ounce pour. Glad to get this on the cheap as opposed to shelling out for a big bottle that I'd struggle to finish."
"M&D- This one is thick and chewy. The feel is a kinda hot on the way down but that is expected just from the hugeness of this beer. It probably would of been much hotter if not for the huge body and malt build. The carbonation is low but not lifeless off of the tap, I can't comment on the bottle version as I don't have one. This is a huge beer that demands time be put into it. A slow sipper for sure. After I was done my glass, I really did not want to indulge with any more."
"An excellent beer (of course), though without doubt a little bit goes a long way."
"Pours a deep brown/black, nose is alcohol, dark fruits, and heavenly goodness. Taste is dark fruit, caramel, and something else I can't put my finger on. This is definitely a sipper, but one that is lovely to experience. Despite some alcohol in the nose, it is hidden well at serving temp, but emerges to create more hotness as it warms."
"This is a sipper but just a little thin in the mouthfeel for me. Also, you cannot do more than 2 helpings of this in a night. It'll floor you... as it did me. Just an awesome, all-around beer!"
"D= The no carbonation thing is a huge flaw in this beer, but it had its moments. The ABV makes this a sipper either way. I would love to try this again if it was properly carbonated."
"$30 is pretty steep, but if you like port wines or like other beers like Papier this is right up your alley."
"D - A very complex beer and good overall. With some carbonation and a heavier body, this beer would receive perfect scores."
"Thanks JNN4V!"
"The mouthfeel is fine for the style, I don't think big strong ales and stouts have to be carbed up to be pleasurable, but a little carbonation wouldn't hurt either... The alcohol is very present throughout, this might get better with age, but all that bourbon might take over as well, it's hard to say. The intense bourbon and alcohol flavors make this a sipper, and not a beer that I am anxious to revisit."
"Edit: I had this on tap in 2007 for the first time, and noted how flat it was (and liked it). I also like this year's flat Santa's and Older...it just somehow didn't work out for this beer like it should have. Recommended if you have $30 to blow, otherwise you'll find beers this good in the $10-15 range."
"Drinkability suffers because it has no carbonation. It's like drinking wine or some other beverage than beer that isn't carbonated. Like many others, I want my $30 back."
"The Angel's Share was definitely one of the most bourbon-rich brews I have ever tried. While I loved the flavor and aroma, I found the intensity of the alcohol to be distracting. A bit more time in the cellar perhaps might help it mellow out."
"Small pop of cork. Poured into RR BA glass...flat as a 10 year old girl. Dark brown like a cup of coffee. Good flavor, but very sad tasting. The beer is crying. C+"
"D - This is good stuff but maybe a little heavy on the bourbon, and that hampers the drinkability a bit."
"I got the beer at Water Street Wines in Peoria IL and I think they have more but I know that they did not make much of this great stuff."
"A very drinkable, but boozy Strong Ale."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is ok for a beer of this strength. But the lack of sufficient carbonation and and the High ABV will limit it a little. Overall, I think this is a good beer. Although, I think there are many other BA offerings out there that are supierior. Skal."
"Pours very dark brown to almost black. No head at all. Nice lacing on the glass. The aromas are intense as I whiff the vanilla upfront, also licorice, brown sugar and molasses. The taste is powerful! I can definitely taste the vanilla and oak upfront. Strong alcohol taste that lingers in the finish. Some residual sweetness. The body is a little thin and I think the finish is a little too alcoholic that lasts way too long. Overall good beer not necessarily a favorite though."
"Thanks to juicestam for sharing this treat out here in the middle of the Pacific."
"D = Not all that drinkable at the moment. A great experiment, but not something that really capture my tastebuds and keeps them longing for more."
"Bottle (2008 I think). Bottle a dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of cohcolate, roasted malt and bourbon. Flavor of sharp bourbon initially. Some buttery popcorn too. Hmm, I like the aroma but the flavor is too bourbony. Overall, ok but not great."
"Mike"
"Bottle pours very dark brown color with tan head that laces and lasts the entire glass. Aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, and earth tones. Has a heavy body. Flavor is oak, bourbon, alcohol, caramel malts add a nice sweetness. Overall, this is a brew that lives up to the hype. I had read reports that this was beginning to sour so I decided to open it. Not with this one. Not a single sour note. The flavors meld together nicely. This would have been even better given more time."
"D--Definitely for sipping."
"I saved this one for 4 months at 75° waiting for it to carbonate. the cork came out without a pop. It pours a dark cloudy brown, with the slightest of bubbles clawing their way to the surface. Tastes of malt, caramel, coffee, bourbon. A great and powerful combination of flavors. Too bad the carbonation is barely present. There is a hint of head around the edge and on the glass when I tilt it, so there is a little bit, but not much. A major flaw in a great beer. Took me 75 minutes to get through this one, just because it's such a heavy flavor and heavy alcohol and flat. I was pretty tipsy when I was done, and my wife was under the table. We had a good time drinking this, though, and that's what was important. Some bubbles and this would be a great one. Too bad the bubbly guys are missing."
"Smelling and savoring this beer is an absolute treat. Deep, luxurious, and delicious all come to mind when I think of describing this beer. One of my favorites of 2009, I can't imagine this beer gets any better with age, luckily I have a few more bottles to find out."
"Good flavor too, it's a damn shame this beer isn't carbonated. Liquefied caramel and malted tootsie rolls dazzle the tongue while fig & raisin adding some fructose sweetness. A drying, chocolate liquor note finishes with a hint of nail polish and breathy, raw ethanol. Body is chewy, viscous, and flat, with some spicy tang to the finish due to the alcohol heat. Warms the stomach after only a few ounces. Overall, this was a good beer, it's just too bad that it wasn't properly carbonated, or else it would have been truly great."
"this was very good although it needs more time to mellow and allow the flavors to blend together. there was far too much bourbon in this that it took away from everything else. i can imagine another year+, this would be amazing."
"Pours a very dark ruby, near black with a medium sized off white head. Aroma was strong bourbon and vanilla. flavor was vanilla, oak, bourbon, candi sugar, and caramel. A bit over carbonated, slight hint of the abv but not bad. This would have been much better without the explosive carbonation, but still a pretty solid beer."
"Almost flat. I will remember to make sure to split this bottle at least 4 ways. More than a small glass is overwhelming."
"2009 bottle. Pours dark brown to black with a head that dissipates quickly. Bourbon and sweet burnt caramel aromas linger in the room. Some fig, maple, and oak in there as well. Mouthfeel is silky/syrupy very, very light carbonation but not entirely flat like the brandy. The alcohol is a little more noticable than I like, but still enjoyable. Flavors are like the aroma with a pronounced bourbon whisky flavor. Why can't they just get some more carbonation in here and it would be a phenominal brew."
"Drinkability: Low overall, but for a 12, what do you expect? It's all of that and more. If you can, agitate and roll the 2008s for a few days to try and get some carbonation in there, it probably would help the overall appearance and maybe even the taste. All I know is that this beer is a monster, and a hell of an animal to conquer."
"D: I like the beer itself but am a bit let down overall. I enjoy a big bourbon filled beer, which this certainly delivers on but I thought the carbonation issue was fixed with this release. Maybe I got a bum bottle, which I hope it was but I expected a bit more out of this beer and it didn't deliver like I thought it would."
"D - Very smooth for the style and barrel aging. Easy to drink, alcohol is smooth and subtle, very smooth. Lost Abby hits a HR on this one. Very good."
"Drinkability: Too high for something that clocks in at 12% ABV. The taste is amazing, the body is warm and smooth, the smell is super enticing and matches the flavors perfectly... Quite possibly one of the best beers... EVER."
"Drinkability: Way higher than it should be. Drinks so surprisingly smoothly with great balance of flavors. Definitely worth it and lives up to the hype."
"Drinkability? It's still a strong brew at 12%abv and there is nothing one can do about that but like the 2009, it is just as good a sipper. No change."
"Again, well concealed, so incredibly drinkable for the style, but to drink too quickly would probably rob you of enjoying all that is going on in this beer. I see now, why this beer is worthy of such lofty praise."
"This is on the short list of the best beers I've had."
"Pours a very dark brown with a medium frothy lasting beige head and lacing. Aroma is fruity sweet with heavy amounts of caramel malt, rasin, plum, licorice, bourbon, oak and light chocolate. Flavor is sweet with a nice medley of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and infused wood. Full bodied, somewhat oily texture. Very little carbonation, finishes mildly alcoholic."
"I curve this one high and will seek out some more."
"The Angel's Share (Bourbon Barrel) is yet one more amazing ale in a long line of amazing ales from The Lost Abbey. Here's hoping that Tomme gets the kinks worked out and is able to ensure that all future releases are properly bubbled, like this one. Even though my glass is now sadly empty, this was a hell of a ride that I can't wait to take again."
"Popped it open, little carbonation and hardly any bubbles or head on the pur. Looked sad! Poured a deep amber color with reddish and brown hues to it. Nose was flatter than I expected due to carbonation I am sure. But the bourbon was there for sure as was brown sugar, candied fruits, caramel, vanilla, oak. Taste was strong on bourbon and despite crappy carbonation it still tasted good. Mouthfeel was not has creamy and good but nevertheless it was still tasty."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers, but again, you can't drink too much in a single sitting. This probably will age very well also."
"Cheers."
"A very big, and complex brew. Flavor is pleasantly unified and interesting enough to find something new with each sip. Bourbon comes on strong, but doesn't overpower the massive caramel and dark fruit sweetness. Certainly a must try."
"A very nice sipper of a strong ale, something I would drink plenty of if the price wasn't quite so high and availability was a little greater, still it will be a very nice treat from time to time."
"D- This beer is dangerous. I mean dangerous. It is so drinkable and I could get enough of it. The ABV is very hidden and I was sad once I took my last sip. I wish I could get my hands on more of this."
"This one is the 750ml corked and caged. Pours a deep mahogany color with a full finger wispy light tan head that fades quickly to surface. Thin but significant patterns of Belgian lacing as you go. The smell is amazing!! Right out of the bottle, the first pour reveals big bourbon notes. As it warms the aroma becomes fruitier and sweeter, brown sugar from a far with a berry tartness further in. The mouth feel is bright and tangy, medium-light bodied, tart with a balanced creamy texture. The flavor is crazy unique; tart apple and berries, bourbon and vanilla with fig and notes of molasses. The experience lingers nicely! One of the best drinkers around!! It goes in a flash while you attempt to consider all of its complexities."
"Underneath is a somewhat musty flavor, like its been aged, but this is a 2008 bottle. Very intriguing and complex notes, although a little bit ""off"". Not overly inviting or easy to drink, but a lot of fun and definitely off the beaten path. I expect nothing less from the Lost Abbey."
"Blipped ""Angel"" by Massive Attack"
"Overall: Really, I'm not as pissed off at this beer as previous reports might indicate. They released it very green, to be sure, but it's kinda interesting to taste such a great beer in such an infantile stage. The predominant thought I had while drinking this is ""Wow, once this grows up a little bit it will literally be one of the best beers I've ever had"". I think that says something."
"Overall I think this comes really close to living up to the hype. It's one of those strange, over-complex brews that I'm really enjoying, & think is really good, but I'm not sure I ever need another one. But a very good beer."
"So much going on her...Big bourbon smell, brown sugar, vanilla, figs, smokey rasins and a small amount of funk. The taste is increadable...so complex, everything from rasins soaked in bourbon, oak, vanilla beans, maple syrup, dark fruit and wet hay, the alcohol is very well balanced with the rest of the components of this beer. Slick mouthfeel, super smooth. Very drinkable but it sneaks up on you."
"finally made the leap on this open window windy evening during the seasonal transition, good cheese pairing with Meadow Creek Appalachian Tomme (that my cheese shares its name with the brewer was not planned, swear), Sexual Chocolate in exchange for a 375 ml some time ago, via MiScusi playing middleman for a BA outsider"
"Drinkability: I really wanted to like this beer and I'm quiet surprised I didn't. The sweetness was just too overpowering. Maybe I can get another bottle and age it for a while and see how that goes."
"Overall, this is a spectacular beer. It is complex and has all the necessary flavors. Definitely lived up to the hype."
"Taste is right up there, similar to all hints in the nose, add a twist of rum, some dark fruits. A medium full body, starting tickling with carbonation, drying into the finish, and a bit slick. An exceptional beer, maybe a bit too carbonated for my taste, but a joy to drink."
"2007 375 mL bottle. Poured into a snifter. After chilling for a couple weeks in the fridge, I decided to finally warm this puppy up and drink it! Carefully I pried open the cork and made sure it did not completely fizz over. An extermely careful pour produced a murky dark brown/ black beer with a 1"" cola like tan head that would not quit. Waited on it for about 5 minutes and no let up! Huge aroma- tons of sweet bourbon, some chocolate, oak. Very inviting smell. Taste was not far off from the smell, but I was surprised how well balanced it was. The first sip was a bit hot with the bourbon, but it mellows quickly and nicely. Molasses, oak, some vanilla, and a bit of booze all work well together. This is a true sipper, though. It warms the whole way down and the aftertaste works overtime. good carbonation in the mouthfeel department, but this one stays heavy, full bodied. Great night cap!"
"Drinkability: Well this one's really good. Damn good. I had the Great Lakes Barrel Aged Blackout Stout the other night, and though similar, the contrast mainly lies in the fruits. The base beer here - the Angel's Share, I s'pose - is far fruitier across the board, both in the light and dark fruit department, different in neither a good way nor a bad way. This beer is, naturally, world class, absolutely delicious, aromatic, creamy and light, and only lacking in those areas where a beer of this abv% is almost certain to lack (lacing, head retention, pure drinkablity). I'd love to have one of these to cellar, though I do fear Lost Abbey's quality control issues! Highly recommended."
"There's been some serious chatter about this brewery, and some of the rumors are disturbing. But I can only review what comes from the bottles I've had, and I've never had a bad bottle. Actually I've never had anything less than an exceptional bottle..."
"Note: This review is not based on one single ""bad"" bottle, and is not a slam against said brewery. More a mounting disappointment with both this over-priced (in my opinion) beer and talented brewery that is losing a loyal fan base because of price gouging."
"The cork came out easy and was followed by a bit of foaming, nothing too extreme but opening it near my sink was a good idea. The beer is dark and opaque, sort of a toffee brown, a little murky, and it has a rocky brownish beige head. Not much head retention with a little chunky lace, not bad for a big beer. Nice aroma! Rich toffee and dried fruits, dates and prunes, bready and sweet with a combination of caramel and bourbon. Mild oak and vanilla with a bit of molasses. Crap, there's a lot of carbonation, too much. It gets in the way of tasting the beer. Alcohol warmth and flavour throughout, lingering into the finish. Bitterness was moderate to low, noticeable without being up front. Malts were quite nice though, very bready with a lot of caramelized sugar character, toffee and a hint of chocolate. Pleasant woody and vanilla, bourbon notes, and plenty of dried fruits, raisins. Slight astringency from the wood, medium to full bodied. Pretty good, very tasty. The only real problem is the overcarbonation, which really detracted from the experience."
"D: Just a really great beer. Very complex. A nice mix of the barrel and a great base beer. Recommended."
"D: Why did Lost Abbey go from 750's to 375's? Those cheap bastards."
"On tap at the Arizona Strong Beer Festival. Color was a rudy dark brown color. Lots of head and the keg poured very foamy when it was first tapped but settled down later on. Had a big white head. Aroma of oak barrels and toffee with a slightly high alcohol awareness evident. Taste was of a woody, oak barrel sweet malt beer. Very excellent beer and one of my favorites at the festival. The rep said some bottles would be coming to Arizona soon."
"A great beer. One of the more exciting ones I've tried in a while."
"Drinkability - a superb sipper. Not sure I'd spring for these too often even if they were more easily attained, but I'm certainly thankful to South Bay for this one."
"Great thanks to Jwale73 for sharing is absurdly great beer! Pours black with a minimal head. Nose is absurd, maybe the best I've ever O smelled it for about 10 minutes. Vanilla, caramel, toffee, oak, bourbon, and dark fruits. Taste is excellent as well, incredibly rich and complex, with maple, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, and raisins dancing in a thick, rich goodness. Finish has some alcohol, but nicley balanced by a little sweet and a little bitter. Just a wonderful beer."
"This is a sipper to be sure, but is quite enjoyable, it will be a pleasure to enjoy the 375mls, even though it will take me a while to do so. Definitely worth trying for fans of well crafted barrel aged brews. Guess i will have to try to acquire the brandy barrel version in order to compare it with this rich and tasty treat. Highly recommended."
"D - SO drinkable. The beer is one of the best I have had and I am lucky to have had it. I'm glad I asked what the unmarked Lost Abbey tap was. Because the bar that shall go nameless, was not advertising they had it."
"This is a great beer. It's big, and opponents of oak-aged beers probably won't like it. But still, it's delicious. Smooth and easy to drink, the high ABV (12%) is there, and you know it's there, but it's not tyrannical. It settles back and lets the laid-back fruit flavors take over in a velvety tongue. A great brew at every step. Worth seeking out if you can't find it in your neck of the woods."
"Pours a deep black with a one finger fluffy light tan colored head that falls to a thin layer. Bits of stickiness grab a hold of the sides here and there, but not a whole lot. Aroma is thick with bourbon, vanilla, and rich caramel malts. A good dose of molasses with plums, dates, and raisins. A very complex nose which I'm sure will carry over to the flavor, or at least I hope. Initial flavor is sweet Vermont maple syrup with caramel and chocolate. Bourbon oak midway with brown sugar, almonds, and fig. Smokey and sweet aftertaste with toffee, butterscotch, and toasted malts. Very full flavored ale with a lot to take in. The feel is a medium warm body with a very aggressive carbonation that really distracts from the overall quality of this beer unfortunately. A great sipping beer, I just wish it was smoother in the mouth."
"Reminiscent in body to Magic Hat's Feast of Fools, Sixpoint's Bolshoi (Light to medium with a highly carbonated champagne yeast like quality)."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable despite the big flavors and the alcohol content of this brew. It's a sipper though. Angel's Share, in my opinion, lives up to the all the hype that I've heard. Another great beer from The Lost Abbey."
"Overall: 'twas my share"
"Very dark brown with a reddish head, great retention and lacing. Smell is very sweet with maple syrup, caramel, bourbon, and toffee all being noticed. Taste is sweet caramel, bourbon, some vanilla, dark fruits, and the a boozy finish. Slightly less than high carbonation with a full body. Good beer, probably will get better with age. Thanks to pepsican for the sample. Had this again and it has much improved already; a top notch beer."
"The 2009 version, the one out there now, unfortunately, is a total flat, uncarbonated mess. Drainpour. Absolutely horrible."
"Tastes very much as it smells. Starts hugely strong, big giant nodes of toffee, raisins, sweet brandywine, chocolate, vanilla, oak, sweet fruit lingers at the end with bitterness. Hops? No--I thought I smelled some but I think I was wrong."
"Another big thanks to Heath for this brew! I've been a little underwhelmed with Lost Abbey and especially their pricing, but this beer is a good one. Angel's Share is very interesting and the bourbon barrel aging adds another layer of depth. I'd like to try the brandy version to compare."
"Overall: A very, very, very good beer....but I'm not sure if it is a ""holy grail"" type of beer. Complex flavors and smell, accompanied by a nice amount of bourbon aging that wasn't too overwhelming. A try it beer for sure. Cheers!"
"Pours opaque ruby brown with a ring of bubbles. Nose is heavily bourbon. Some brief hints of raisins, vanilla and oak. Fortunately, the taste rounds out the bourbon with stronger vanilla, oak, chocolate, and cocoa powder. Pleasant alcoholic warmth. Sadly, and probably because of the build-up to finally having this beer, it left me wanting more. Not complaining, this was excellent, but I still wanted more."
"I am very impressed with this beer as a whole. Most of the regular Lost Abbey brews I've been unimpressed with, and with all the hyped up beers I've tasted recently, this is one of a few that I feel lives up to it's hype."
"Dark brown with a nice creamy head. As expected, the barrel is up front. Then you start to smell the other aspects. A surprise in the aroma is a hint of cherry. Strong bourbon flavor, toffee, and vanilla. Start drinking at cellar temp and allow the beer to warm. This is an amazing beer."
"Near perfection in a barrel aged beer. The first Lost Abbey brew I've had that's met the hype"
"Overall, well worth the hype! In fact, this beer exceeded my expectations. Thanks again drseamus and eclectic for this awesome brew."
"Cork popped with much force. Plenty of carbonation and the beer started storming up the neck of the bottle. Pours a very dark brown in color. Some nice bourbon, oak and toffee notes in the nose. Taste is more of the bourbon, but you get the other flavors from the barrel as well. Some nice oak and vanilla help out. Very carbonated and bubbly on the mouthfeel. Would have liked it to be a bit smoother. I preferred this one to the brandy version. This seems to be much more balanced and the flavors seem to compliment each other and work well."
"D- Goes down very easy in spite of the high ABV and bourbon barrel aging."
"Decadent yet under control, complex yet approachable. This beer is very deserving of its elite status. One of my all-time favorites..."
"Pours a deep amber to a black color with a big, yeasty tan head. In the aroma, oak, vanilla, roasty malt, bourbon and just a hint of chocolate. In the taste, bourbon, vanilla, oaky, with hints of chocolate and alcohol. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry bourbon and alcohol aftertaste. A great sipper, and perfect to share, great flavors, and all around, pretty freakin' great!"
"One of the best barrel-aged beers i've had in a loooong time. If you can get hold of this baby, try it!"
"Really amazing beer. Grows more and more complex as it warms up. Very easy drinking. Seek this one out!"
"Sweet, smooth, incredible."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light. Lots of carbonation produced a huge fluffy off white head that impaled itself to the sides of the glass. Smells of bourbon, licorice, toffee, some higher alcohols and maybe a faint brett type smell. Tastes of sweet malt, some plums, some alcohol, some bourbon. Carbonation is a bit high and affects the mouthfeel a bit feels prickly with carbonation as well as a bit syrupy. Heavy thick body. Good brew, I wish the carbonation was a bit lower, but overall solid brew. At 15 dollars plus shipping for a little more than 12 ounces I can safely say that I probably won't seek this one out again."
"Damn good stuff for sure, and glad I got to try it so I know for certain this is wildly overpriced and not something I would purchase on its own. Not nearly as complex as I would have expected, came across as less intersting than other barrel aged ales I've encountered, such as Firestone 11 and a handful of others sampled at the same event. Good stuff again, but the wife and I agreed that for something with such hype and inflated pricing, it's a bit mundane."
"Poured a hazy red brown color with a small, light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malts, light cocoa, vanilla, dried fruits, caramel, and a bit of bourbon as well. Taste of more cocoa, some roast, raisins, and other dark fruits, some vanilla, oak, and a bit of bourbony alcohol in the finish. I guess I'll be part of the camp who prefers the Brandy version to this one, but big thanks to EDA for sharing this!"
"A fantastic brew - can't wait to try the brandy version."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has somewhat of a creaminess to it as well. This is quite carbonated and personally I think the carbonation is a little overdone here. Overall though, it's intensely complex, warming and contemplative. Definitely a sipper, but one I could sip all night. An amazing beer that I would recommend any day of the week!"
"Notes from and tasted on 4/14/08"
"Note: The 2009 version has no carbonation and is very boozy - a real disappointment"
"Cask conditioned at the Great British Beer Festival 2008, gravity dispense. Nearly black colour (very dark reddish brown). Intense and lovely aroma of various subtropical woods, winey notes. The mouthfeel has lots of alcoholic warmth as expected. The flavour has notes of oak and fortified wine. Very good."
"The only drags to this beer was the near explosion at the end, and the black schmootz I found at the bottom of the glass. I don't know what the fuck that was, but i didn't drink it. Luckily I have one more bottle of this year's batch. Hopefully it'll mellow out and there will be no accidents."
"thanks lost abbey!"
"Crazy carbonation flows a four finger rich tan head over the top of the glass. Body is of the blackest brown in color. Nose is delecious with toffee, molases and lovely oak infused bourbon. Waves of lace are left as the head fades. A mix of creamy carbonation carries carmalized richness into the mouth with first sip. Tasty buttered rum and toffee tones meet with lots of sweet dark fruit on the palate. Alchol tones are very well hidden except for the ways the flavors properly bring them out. This beer drinks better and smooths as it warms. Mouthfeel is a bit thick and chorolately like a bourbon truffel. Superbly drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a great beer, I just think it could be even better with a softer and thicker mouthfeel."
"Poured into my Westy glass a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus foamy/fizzy tannish head, which left a big island in the middle of my glass, with some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, good touch of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. The taste is malty, a healthy note of bourbon, with some oak, and vanilla. Starts of sweet, then the big malts kick in. Full body. The alcohol is present, but not too much. Very drinkable, I've waited a long time to try this one out, finally, the wait is over. Thanks Mike."
"Tough to pick up on the 12% alc. 2008 Bottle at O'Brien's SD a while back. Interesting mix of sour and burbon. Dark rich ale flavor, malt, sweet oak / burbon flavor that provides a complex and long finish that I have not experienced before. Still young and I feel it can age for several years. Lots of yeast in this one, but don't pour it out. The last small glass, cloudy and chunky, was outstanding!"
"This is another perfectly crafted work of art from the Lost Abbey. It's just one of those beers that is so rich, complex, and well balanced that it's easy to get lost in its awesomeness, and then because of its' fantastic quaffability, not realize that it's all gone until your licking the last drop out of the glass. Extremely well done! I loved every drop!"
"Overall, Bourbon snobs (or geeks) will love this beer. It's balanced, flavorful, and possesses lots of great Bourbon notes. Such a great beer. One that every Bourbon snob/geek should seek out."
"There is lots of bourbon in the smell, along with other fruits and spice. Raisins are especially pronounced. These same traits are also present in the taste, along with vanilla, carmel, and tons of sweetness. Definitely my kind of beer. It's a shame this is one of those crazy rare beers that's so hard to come by. I'd drink this all the time if I could. One of my favorites."
"D- I wouldn't drink strong ales all the time, but this specific one I could drink any time. It's so flavorful and an amazing experience."
"Can't complain, I recommend this to anyone, its more of a sit at home and drink beer than a bar beer, if that makes sense. Grab a book, have some cheese or chocolate nearby, sit in a comfy chair, and relax type beer."
"Had this brew after dinner this evening and it is a treat for any beer lover..very glad to have the opportunity to try this one."
"Thanks to Aaron and Jason for the chance to try this!"
"D - Reminds me slightly of a highly carbonated Bourbon County Stout. Somewhat one dimensional on the bourbon side but that is not a bad thing coming from this bourbon fan."
"M&D: full-bodied, devilishly smooth with super-fine carbonation, and a tad oily on the palate, this oak-aged dark barley wine is great as a night-cap, satisfying in a spirit-lifting way. Better served in a sniffer, I say!"
"Poured into a Corsendonk tulip a nice dark brown with a huge frothy head. Aroma is a nice blend of Bourbon and brown malts. The taste is absolutely unworldly! Toasted brown malt, burnt caramel, Bourbon and dried fruits provide an indescribable complexity. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with moderately present alcohol and slight carbonation, certainly a sipper. This beer is simply wonderful, one of the best I've ever had!"
"Overall, very, very good."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
"D - Drinkability is very good. This is one amazing beer. The alcohol is hiddeen very well. The taste is very complex and smooth. At 12% it goes down very easy but you will want to savor and sip this beer. I just can't say enough about how good this beer is."
"Awesome achievement here. Wish it wasn't as carbonated as it was. Still quite enjoyable & something that should definately be seeked out."
"Pours a dark brown with a tan head. Bourbon barrel nose for sure. Easily noticed vanilla. I thought I got some apples at first too. Flavor brings a great thick tone. Sweet molasses. Rich caramel. Robust, but smooth. Good bourbon tones that don't overpower. A touch hot,but doesn't really matter. Feel has a higher carbonation to it. Liquid is smooth. Very easy to drink. A bit of a sipper, but I force myself to do that to savor the moment."
"Drinkability is somewhat average due to gusher and high alcohol but since it is so dang smooth I want another. My bottle went way to quick and will be seeking out more."
"D- amazingly complex but alcohol is too harsh for my liking. Thus i wont go out of my way to search for it but a do recommend trying it, again, the complexity is great"
"I remember the brandy version being a bit smoother and more easy to drink (so easy that the 12.5% sneaked up on me! And that one was 750ml too). This one is still pretty drinkable but it could be better."
"Bottle sampled at Lost Abbey for RBSG 08. Poured into a wine glass. Deep brown color with lots of cocoa foam and visible sediment. Aromas of bourbon and chewy sweet malts. Flavor is maple syrup/brown sugar with the obvious rich bourbon note. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Sticky mouthfeel makes the finish very long. Drinkability is ridiculous for 12.5%."
"Pours a cloudy mahogany, nice dark red highlights around the edges, thick tan head rises, tight bubbles, settles to a thin layer and medium ring around the glass, looks top notch. Smell is crazy, tons of caramel and wood, bourbon, very bready, yeast, bit of chocolate, more caramel, more oak, dark fruits, brown sugar and dates. Taste is rich buttery toffee, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, tons of wood, bready, yeast, alcohol comes through a bit, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, alcohol is well hidden, but the carbonation is way too high. I prefer the Brandy barrel version, but this is still some good stuff. Thanks Scott!"
"drinkability is pretty good, but could be better. the alcohol warmth and high carbonation really take away from it overall. it gets better once it's had some time for the carbonation to dissipate. to me this one just doesn't quite have the depth and fullness that the original brandy barrel aged version had."
"d: I got this jewel as an extra from rallison. Big thanks Ryan! I am thrilled to have had the chance to try this spectacular offering."
" Had a little burnt brown shards in the bottom of my glass. This was extemly drinkable and is worth all the hype surrounding it. I WANT MORE!"
"Pours a murky dark cola brown to black in color with a massive dark tan head that just keeps on hanging around. Aroma is a nice strong woodiness, alcohol definitely evident in the aroma, rich and sugary pruney malts mixed with vanilla. Taste follows with some sweet caramel malts up front, strong vanilla notes, raisins, oakiness, and a nice bourbon presence along with a good dose of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is a medium to heavy, sugary body that is cut well by a good sized woody bitterness and warmth of alcohol, as well as an active and somewhat peppery and crisp carbonation. Absolutely delicious, how will I keep my hands off of what's left in the cellar? The barrel ageing works very well with this beer, extremely well done."
" I'm a big fan of bourbon aged beers, oak aged beers, and those beers that just seem to bring a little something extra to the table. This beer totally runs the gauntlet. Popping the cork on this bad boy and pouring it I knew I was in for something special. Then you put it to your nose. All I could say was WOW! If this taste as good as it smells, sweet oak aged vanilla, bourbon, Belgian Candi sugar..Then.. the taste Smooth beyond all belief, alcohol was very well hidden basically because my palette was busy moshing over all the flavors of vanilla, oak, and bourbon and sugars that were to be what I expected from the nose. It did not let up! Holy Moses sweet fathers of the brewing Gods. I have seen the light and it beem through a bottle of Bourbon Barrel Aged Lost Abbey Angel's Share!"
"Drinkability: For me, it was more than a bit overcarbonated, but thankfully it delivered a satisfying tastiness to warrant fighting the fizzies."
"D - It's a great, well put together, complex beer, but it almost seems futile to rate the drinkability of such a rare beer."
"Tastes oaky emptiness over malt sweet and alcohol. Chocolate powder, like Nestle cocoa. Bourbon and mild fruitiness. Nice, but not overly complex. The alcohol and sweet conflict in comparable intensity. Md-light body and oaky dries out the finish. Decent drinkablility."
"Drinking my last bottle of this batch (2008), and I have to say that it hasn't changed too much. Still very bourbon-forward up front with some vanilla and coconut working brilliantly with the tobacco and dark fruit. The booze has died down a touch, but good god, this is a brilliant beer! Bravo, Tomme!"
"D: While it is certainly not a session ale, it's a fantastic brew overall. Wish it was brewed more frequently and easier to get, but I'm just happy I got to try it once."
"Big thanks to IntriqKen for the bottle"
"Unfortunately this is way to carbonated. Really hurting the mouthfeel as it causes the beer to seperate on the toungue on each sip almost discentigrating in nature. However I can live with that and could drink this all day."
"Overall: delicious, and fun, and interesting. But worthy of the astonishing hype? I'm extremely happy to have had it, and I'd even stand in line for it if I was local. But A+ average? I think it's somewhat overhyped. It's not a true 5 in any category. Again, don't get me wrong: it's delicious -- really, really tasty. But mindblowing, A+, it is not."
"An extremely drinkable and smooth big beer but ABV is still too high for a great score."
"06 Bourbon was on tap for the Toronado BW fest and blew most everything else away. The other 3 I've had side by side a couple of times, and the ranking seems to stay the same. So yeah, a 4.5 average for this I think is about fair - the 06 Bourbon would score near a 5, the 06 Brandy probably a 4.7 or so, and the 07 Brandy probably a 4.3-4.4 or so. All fine beers though, no question."
"Notes: I drank one of these a month ago but was too buzzed to even taste it. One of those nights, y'know? My friend and even my girlfriend said it was good tho, so I figured I'd rock one for my 100th."
"Decanted from the bottle into a snifter. Pours a dark color with a massive head. The head subsides quite a bit, leaving a thin layer of foam across the top. Aroma is intense. Big notes of vanilla, bourbon, plums, caramel, and alcohol. Taste starts with bourbon and vanilla, then transitions to caramel malts and plums, finally ending with a mild coffee-like bitterness. Damn there's a lot going on. Mouthfeel is right in the middle and quite creamy. This is a big beer and definitely a sipper. Overall I have zero criticism for this beer. It is excellent in general."
"A superb strong ale that exhibits a wonderful spirit barrel character. A great beer to enjoy over an hour's time. As it warms, more complexity shines through."
"Pours black with some faint brown showing up around the edges when held up to the light. Great tight head that sticks around as a somewhat thick cap. Especially impressive given the huge abv. The aromas are heavenly. Just the right amount of Bourbon right off the bat. Lovely aromas of caramel, gentle but pure Bourbon, sweet oak, vanilla, gentle malt, chestnut honey, and various dark fruit, all nicely integrated and not hot smelling. The taste is also amazing. Extremely well integrated flavors with great Bourbon and oak up front followed by cream, vanilla, and fruit flavors. Very nice level of carbonation, not too aggressive at all. The mouthfeel is ultra rich and creamy, but with the alcohol well hidden. An absolutely amazing sipper. I really like bourbon influenced oak aged beers if they are done well. I think this is probably my favorite to date. When this brewery is firing on all cylinders, they can really be fantastic. This beer sure is."
"Not nearly as good as the regular Angel's Share, in my opinion. Pours a dark cola color with light tan colored super fizzy head. Bottle gushed upon opening too. Smell is vanilla, raisin, bourbon and sweet malt. Taste is similar, but much more mild than the standard angel's share which was really rich and strongly flavored. The carbonation was way too high in this body and it just foamed in the mouth, which drives me nuts. Overcarbonated and underflavored."
"Brown color with a full head. Hard to get much out of the nose at all. Velvety mouth feel with a smooth texture. Not very complex overall, with out nuance or depth. It does have a nice hint of dried chocolate on the finish, but other than that, there isn't a lot of describable character. Good, solid ale. I have found these new versions of angels share beers to be just ok, both the latest batches are not as good as the original batch at GABF 2006."
"The tap version to me tasted a little more viscus and fruity wick I liked but both are amazing. Glad my dad recently have me a few more of his bottles so I can enjoy this a little more since I traded off half of mine. Can't wait untill the next release. Thanks Lost Abbey!"
"Edit: review comparison: Unlike the bourbon barrel the brandy heats up a lot stronger (even with more age on it). Not as smokey and woody character to it. Instead you have upfront brandy which hits your tongue very noticeable. Leaves a bigger bitterness as well IMO. Think I prefer the bourbon barrel just due to the more complex wood characters that come through along with the smokiness. I thought that balanced everything out and made it better ""rounded"" than the brandy does."
"Believe the hype."
"Unworthy of its place as one of the most perfect beers in the world... but conversely, very worthy of the hype as something interesting and spectacular in its own, roughly honed way."
"D: This is my first Angel's Share and I have to say it's one of my desert island beers - near perfect. The flavors are so big yet so well balanced, the hype is completely deserved. I need more of this now..."
"I had high expectations for this one and they've actually been exceeded. It's hard to find any fault in this beer. My one small criticism is that it needs to be a tad thicker and have the feel smoothed out a little. Nevertheless, Lost Abbey has crafted a world class beer with this one. You must find it...somehow, someway."
"This poured mahogany in color with a creamy head. The nose was nicely complex with scents of roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit and a slight herbalness. The palate is similarly complex and medium to full-bodied with great richness and balance. There is plenty of carbonation to keep this deep beer fresh. Aging should allow this to mellow out a bit and be potentially perfect for my palate."
"I had heard a lot of talk about this beer and was finally lucky enough to try it. Wasn't sure what to expect at first. The pour is dark brown with descent head. It has a lot of distinct flavors in the taste, however they are perfectly balanced so that no one is too strong. The taste is very rich. By far the best beer that I have ever had. Although not something that you could drink more than a couple of glasses of due to the rich flavor. If you can locate a bottle of this limited release, I would highly recommend it."
"D: Very slow sipper. It's in a 12.7oz bottle for a reason. Damn tasty and will cap my night, nicely."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, hot, oaky, with chewy, sugary caramel along the palate."
"D - Much too hot for my taste, but a very interesting beer. I can't quite believe that this beer is only 12.5% abv as it is very boozy. Thumbs up to Tomme for putting out another creative brew."
"Imagine how well this is going to age! I'm looking forward to trying this again soon."
"D - Overall this is a great beer that just bring so much to the table and yet it is complex and completely in balance. The nose is nice and dominated by the oaky and bourbon spiciness. The taste runs the gamut from sweet, spicy, fruity. I would love to try to get a hold of some more of this and even try to age some if I could wait long enough not to drink it. I think it would be interesting to see if the beer mellowed out in a Definitely a top tier beer and one of the best I've had. Also a sipper not because it is overly strong or out of balanced, but because each sip is so complex that it deserves your full attention and is a beer that requires your full attention."
"Did not enjoy this one as much as the brandy version but it was still awesome, would say this version is more similar to a barleywine, the smaller size bottle was a perfect serving too because of how strong it is, this one was a serious gusher this is one of the most unique beers out there and if you have not tried either of the Angel's Shares then you really need to, will definitely drink again in the upcoming years, congratulations to Tomme again for brewing yet another masterpiece"
"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty tasty brew that I really enjoyed. That being said, there's no way I could ever drink more than one. The oak and bourbon teeter on the border of being absolutely delicious and way over the top. Either way, its good to the last drop and ridiculously complex. Big thanks to Tim and Shane!!"
"Pours a beautiful deep brown color dark and beautiful. The small tan head quickly dissipates slowly. Average lacing and surprisingly above average carbonation. Usually, barrel aged beers become flat. Not this beer. I appears o be bottle condition. Smell of strong bourbon and sweet roasted dark malts. Tastes of strong bourbon/whiskey, coffee, sweet roasted malts, coffee, and toffee. Complex and very tasty - This WORLD CLASS. Drink and Enjoy!"
"Definitely a pleasure to drink this."
"Cheers, Prost, Slainte, Vashe zdorovie .... To Lost Abbey, To BA, and to this 400 and 400 more."
"The price of entry is sinful but the result is decadent! I'm glad I took a leap of faith and bought this one. Oh, one last sad note - at 375ml's this one is over all too fast."
"Pours a dark brown and ruby with a huge rocky light tan head. Appears to be quite overcarbonated. Nose REEKS of bourbon heat and dark fruits, wood. Taste = Bourbon! dark fruit, caramel, bourbon soaked raisins, vanilla, caramel apple, wood and bourbon and alcohol on the finish. Wonderful. Great sweetnes lingers in the mouth and on the lips. This one will be amazing after a few years in the cellar. Mouthfeel is suprisingly thin and waaayyy more carbonated than I expected. Drinkability is good for the style, but will greatly improve with some cellaring I think. Certainly an amazing concoction, bourbon is right up front. Defenitely a great cellar candidate. Pleased to have had the opportunity to have tried it. Thanks again, Dana!"
"The cork flew out of this 375ml and then the beer erupted. Dark brown, it looks just like the brandy version. Nice bourbon and wood smell. Tastes like cola and vanilla coupled with bourbon, some licorice. This is a very flavorful beer and the alcohol was well hidden. I preferred the profile on the brandy barrel version a little more but this was still very good."
"Joey - you are awesome! Thanks for supplying the lucky few of us that actually acquired a bottle. I am in your debt. I didn't do you the favor by buying it, you did me the favor by selling it."
"d - this is so good it pains me that i cannot get this as often as i would like. thank you sooo much chefscott79!!!!"
"This is an incredibly complex beer. Calling it a strong ale is almost insulting, but I don't know where else it should go either. I sipped this over the course of two hours and enjoyed every minute of it."
"Somehow not nearly as well integrated, nor nearly so tasty as the 2006 Brandy version (I have yet to try the 2007). I could see this getting close, but somehow the base beer has changed too much while residing in the barrel. I wonder if the changed flavor, lightened body, along with the gushing, is caused by a slight infection? If so it is not so much as to drastically effect things or even be overtly noticeable, but this beer is just enough off to keep it from being great."
"D- I really really wanted to not like this beer. I tried to find as much wrong with it as I could but I just couldn't. Not a huge fan of the brewery, didn't buy into the hype and I loved it. Try to get a bottle now why there is still some in circulation, you won't regret it."
"What an exceptional beer. I'm not convinced this is a barleywine strictly. It's a bit heavy on the dark, chocolate and crystal malts. It pours a dark brown, almost black. It also has a significant chocolate flavor on there. There's also tons of caramel and vanilla from the bourbon barrel. It's pretty thick, full bodied, but it goes down silky smooth. This was by far the best beer at the fest, even though I'm not sure it would classify as a barleywine by BJCP or by GABF standards. I guess that's why lost abbey classifies it as one of their ""non-denomination beers."" Still, this is a must have for any beer fan. What a treat. I could sit for hours and just sniff that vanilla, caramel, chocolate and oak."
"lovely stuff, satisfies my bourbon-loving sweet tooth (tongue?), though it feels like an imperial stout."
"Overall drinkability? How does one rate a beer like this for drinkability? I will certainly have it again. I hope."
"Props to Tomme on perfectly harnessing the power of the bourbon barrel. Although I don't like this one quite as much as the brandy barrel version, both are absolutely world class beers."
"Drinkability/Notes: Sure am glad I joined the LA Sinners Club. Where else could I get such fantastic beer. Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share hits a home run. I'm not a big fan of some bourbon barrel aged beers but this one is spot on. The bourbon accents the beer not dominating the flavor profile whatsoever. Plenty of big, rich, dark fruit with hints of vanilla and bourbon all finished with a nice bit of hop bitterness. Alcohol is so well hidden its dangerous. A true sipper that gets better as it warms. Seek and Enjoy !! Highly Recommended !"
"Every sip makes me a little more pissed that Tomme Arthur is on his rag because of his beers being sold on ebay and no longer releasing this beer in 750 ml size. Ya know, selling smaller bottles and charging more isn't going to stop people from ebaying these, its just going to upset the loyal fans and customers."
"This is my first review, so this is a great beer for the occasion!"
"Poured into a Double Bastard Glass. Beautiful appearance. Root beer brown, with a decadent head. Smell fluttered with alcohol, just for a second, then came the carmel sweetness, and malty tang. The taste. Come on!! Flirted with heavenly. Bourbon flavor, mixed expertly with rich, malt, sugar, carmel flavor. This beer felt wonderful on the mouth, dangerously almost too good. Drinkability off the charts. I could drink this beer regularly. If you have the means I highly suggest you getting this beer. Truly exceptional and one of the best beers I have ever had."
"It's difficult to write an appropriate description of a transcendental experience. This divine concoction changed my perspective on what beer could be. It offers every bit of complexity of a great wine melded with the deep satisfaction of a superb beer. Most barleywines seem to be overly sweet or harshly alcoholic but the balance in this beer is tremendous. Do whatever you can to secure some of this incredible beer."
"Flavors of malt, vanilla, chocolate, with hints of molasses, bourbon, and toffee. The tastes don't linger too long, so there is no overpowering buildup. Moderate carbonation helps to cleanse the palate. Somewhat hot, much smoother than the Brandy version. A fantastic, world class beer."
"I really want to try this head-to-head with the last release to see how they compare. I think the bourbon barrel version is less subtle and complex, but equally delicious."
"The nuances I remember savoring with each sip have been replaced and overwhelmed by an oak and bourbon background. Somewhat disappointing. A surprisingly high level of carbonation, which I liked, but might be offputting to some."
"D- Well, this is perhaps my most favorite beer, ever. I would drink this daily if I had the stores. Absolutely amazing stuff. Definitely a bit of heaven."
"Overall I really loved this one. Now I have not really had anything from Lost Abbey that I have not liked, but this and Devotion on back to back nights have really taken this thing to a while new level. The complexity displayed in the is uncanny and I really had a touch time with this review, as I am not usually at a loss for words with my reviews, but this one had me there, it was just that good. I really look forward to the Brandy and Bourbon barrel aged editions later this year; they will truly be breathtaking as I can only imagine the heights to which this one will get."
"Pours dark brown/mahogany with a brown head. Heavy dark friut aroma with lots of oak. Rich, and very malty with lots of fruity goodness up front. This was the last beer of a long night of sampling for me and Mike. Hopefully I will be lucky enough some day to have another bottle of this fine beer."
"Overall an amazing beer! This is one you would consider as a brewing achievement. Pushing the envelope of style while still incredibly tasty."
"Drinkability- Falling in lockstep with other reviews, I've found this to be an ale worthy of the prized top-tier, the overall taste sensation is that of a creamy and complex barleywine with excellent drinkability despite the 11%abv, the flavor profile jumps across a range of flavor sensations but somehow wraps it all up into a well-balanced package, given the scarcity of Angel's Share, this is a primo Strong Ale that should be reserved for special occasions assuming you can get your hands on one!"
"D: Glad I got one bottle, for sure. Thanks to rallison."
"And finally, YES, this is truly a remarkable brew...the best I've had from Lost Abbey ever and Lost Abbey makes incredible beers daily."
"drinkablility....someone want to share some more with me...my favorite beer I have ever tried...well of the barrel aged at least...I could drink this everyday...yummm"
"By the way only my brother-in law and my cousin who works for mtv brasil liked this beer the others thought it was to strong and went back to drinking their skol. To each his own."
"A muddy dark caramel brown. I've had the pleasure of sipping this one at least five times at various beer fests in the bay area. The most recent tasting having been at the 2007 barrel aged beer festival at the bistro in Hayward, California. This brew like mentioned above is a dark muddy colour with a small and thin off-white/brownish head of foam that dies quickly and is hard to revive. This brew in my chalice glass just reeks of bourbon and oak with a heart dose of candied bready malts as well. Hopheads may want to look the other way as this brew is all about the over the top sweet malts and their caramel sugary flavours which are enhanced by the notes of bourbon and oak that are left on this brew after Tommes aging process take hold. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, and reminiscent of a petite champagne cognac. Drinkability is good for one so heavy. Truly a legend in the oak/aged strong ale/barley wine category."
"Beautiful muddy, and thick, brown color with a light brown head that leaves very little lacing. Every swirl of this Angel produces a generous head back. Smell is of doughy, cookie and a rich toffee, buttery, and maple syrup boozy bourbon notes. Taste is sweet and awfully creamy. Mouthfeeling is great and allows you palate to soak in all the tasty bourbon and leaves a lingering warming. Great beer!"
"Overall: Thanks to oodeftone for hooking me up. Without you, I wouldnt have ever had the chance. This beer is great. I would drink it all the time if I could. Another great beer from Port."
"On cask at the brewery. Aroma perks forth with suave, sleek grandeur enticing in so many fruits, rich nuttiness and bold gout-inducing richness. Sprightly. Out of the hand engine, the beer comes as a ruddy hued mahogany, clouded with a fine, silky smooth cream head in tobacco tinted cloud. Flavor is redolent with extravagant creamed malts, mature sugar density and a whole pantheon of nuts, fruits, chocolate, nips of tobacco and fragrant plums. Texture completely sublime, the cask presentation heightening the sickening drinkability of a beer so hefty. The bourbon smoothes corners, draws deep breaths of moist woodiness and clean nut-dry parching quality. More rounded and deep than the Brandy-barrel version and it shows. I really didnt think this beer could get any better."
"Deep, deep brown color-poured from the bottle a beautiful burgundy. Small head gone all too quickly. Sweet smelling-very port and raisen like. Wonderfully deep and rich flavor. Great notes of vanilla and oak. Noticeable alcohol flavors. Whiskey like flavors as well. Very smooth and creamy considering the abv. Lingering whiskey bite on the tongue. Very impressive beer. Night cap describes it all. Many thanks to callenak for this treat from Secret Santa 2006. Best US strong I have had-period."
"Got a chance to try this at the Port brewery last time we were there during a tasting. Rich, complex strong ale with strong oak overtones. Almost as much of a 'port' as their Older Viscosity. As nutty as a good porter but without the heaviness. Definitely a sipping beer; sort of the opposite of a lawnmower beer."
"Yes, its worth the price."
"Note: this beer make-up will change with the different barrels that it's aged in and a few other variables."
