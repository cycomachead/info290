The nose is chocolate over light grains with some light sugars. It has a very intensely chocolate palate which is surprising for a beer this light colored.  It actually starts a little thin and grows in body and character as it moves over the tongue and finishes with lingering chocolate tastes. The chocolate is semi-sweet to a little more. Medium body and medium levels of fine soft carbonation.","pat61","Jan 18, 2015"

The smell really gave me the heebie-jeebies as it smelled nothing like I would expect for a chocolate ale and expected some kind of sour wine/vinegar flavored beer - surprise number two. Lo and behold! The flavor was exceptional smooth, soft, and subtly chocolate overall, nothing at all like what the aroma suggested - surprise number three!.  I can't get over the extremely weird smell, but with everything else considered, this is a very tasty, fine looking beverage.

Smells of peanut butter, sweet malt, hint of alcohol, hint of yeast, and a hint of roasted malt. Sadly, chocolate is lacking in the aroma, but strangely peanut butter present. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dark chocolate, sweet malt, hint of hop, hint of yeast, slight peanut butter, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, more peanut butter than chocolate, but otherwise weak appearance, and blend. This beer does not live up to the hype.","Tone","May 29, 2014"

Initially I thought the beer was a bit too thin and the flavor somewhat shallow. Even though I had let the beer warm up a little before drinking, I thought the flavor improved markedly as it warmed further. Honestly I loved the last few swigs and sips, and by then I wished I had purchased several bottles. I really think it might be best near room temperature, but I'll have to experiment more next year. This beer is incredibly smooth and deceptively strong. I like that combination since I'm not a quantity drinker.

Here, Boulevard seems to have had something special in master chocolatier Christopher Elbow, and that shows: the cacao you taste is gourmet. But the beer is hindered by a sad off-flavor, a plastic-y case of what I think is over-carbonation. When I twisted the cork off I was surprised by the pressure it had – that thing ripped out of there like a gunshot – and when I poured I could instantly smell the off-aroma. I’m pretty sure this is unfiltered, though, so I guess it could also be a yeast off-flavor. But, in all, there’s obvious quality beneath this beer’s missteps; I just wish the bottle wasn’t so damn expensive ($14 for 750mL) so I could give it a second chance without feeling insane…","BarryMFBurton","Beers"

2.63,-29.1,3,3,2.5,2.25,2.5,"I must agree with many of those who have tried this 2014 batch of Boulevard chocolate ale, the chocolate is faint and barely noticeable. Two years ago I kept going back to BCA because it was quite simply one of the best beers I've ever had. It was a surprisingly easy drinker back then as well, which was strange for a chocolate beer (of course it's not a stout or porter). The balance of chocolate was spot on, a perfect blend that was just sweet enough. It appears this beer has fallen victim to the cost-cutting methods or alternate recipes so many brewers implement to stretch out ingredients and increase production on high-demand limited release beers. I had been eagerly awaiting this beer perhaps more than any other in the last two years and am severely disappointed with the bottle I drank. I just paid 13.99 + tax for a beer that had absolutely no business being in a high priced bomber. Sure it's a solid ""3.0"" beer to be put in a 6 pack for 7.99 and sold as a typical craft amber ale or something, but with chocolate that isn't pronounced, and sold as ""chocolate ale"" for around 15$, ratings should be adjusted accordingly. The difference between the bottles I bought in 2012 and 2014 was night and day. I even think 2012 was clearer copper color, while 2014 looked cloudy when poured. I have one more bottle I'll put away and pray for some miraculous aging and I'll try to find it on tap to compare, but wow. MAJOR letdown. Looking at all the wildly variable reviews on this beer... maybe it's just one of those inconsistent beers where every now and then you get a special batch. *sigh*","snargles","Feb 14, 2014"

I can't help but wonder how ridiculous getting hands on a bottle would be if this was just Boulevard Chocolate Ale instead of Chocolate Ale by Boulevard in Collaboration With Christopher Elbow.","LambicPentameter","Feb 04, 2014"

Taste is also dominated by really nice floral black chocolate notes without much bitterness. Nutty caramel malt notes are also easily discernible and really enjoyable. Body is about average with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very enjoyable and nice integration of chocolates notes without going back to a stout.","Phyl21ca","Sep 19, 2013"

The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, very nice touch of dark chocolate, some slight notes of bananas, nice little hop note to boost, lightly spiced. The taste is very nice, malty, with that nice touch of yeast, throw in some dark chocolate, and bananas/spice note. Medium body, slightly dry finish, very drinkable. ABV is hidden very well.

I saw this on sale at Bridge Liquors recently, and I've never had this beer before so I figured why not buy it? Served in a tulip (as recommended on Boulevard's website), the brew pours a hazy dark amber with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like bittersweet and milk chocolate, tootsie rolls, nuts, and some booze and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, although I would like to try a fresher bottle sometime. Definitely worth a try.","bluejacket74","Jul 23, 2012"

Very bitter and complex without the usual sweetness I associate with chocolate, even dark chocolate is sweeter smelling than this. Very unique aroma. The taste is good but not quite as good as the aroma. Definitely still get a heavy chocolate taste with just enough malt backbone to remind you this is a beer. Hard to discern any hop presence behind the the bitterness of the cocoa. The mouthfeel was good, very easy to drink especially for 9%. Overall this is a very unique beer.

3.74,0.8,3,4,4,3,3.5,"8,3,8,4,16. 750 ml bottle. This is the first chocolate beer I've ever had that wasn't black or dark brown. It pours hazy orange with a huge beige head that collapses after a few minutes. Aroma is of course chocolatey. I also smell a hint of coffee. Taste is sweet with a hint of sour leading to a faintly dry bitter finish. Velvety mouthfeel and medium carbonation. It's a nice beer, but I prefer Southern Tier's Choklat and Sam Adams Chocolate Bock.","poisoneddwarf","Feb 16, 2012"

A hybrid of fine milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate flavors, yeast spice, and an almost tart like accent hangs around sip to sip.

It poured a golden brown type color with a certain degree of cloudiness. A sweet chocolate flavor was immediately noticeable on the first taste. The taste yields to a smooth and sweet chocolate aftertaste that lacks the ugly sour milk flavor of a chocolate stout. There is almost a certain brandy quality to the aftertaste as it is mildly warming. With a mild level of carbonation, this is a excellent after dinner drink.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 05, 2012"

Honestly, I expected something darker. Not that this looks bad, just unexpected. The nose is pretty much straight dark chocolate, with a hint of fudge in the background. This ain't no sweet chocolate, either: It's brash, slap-you-in-your-sad-little-sweet-expecting-face bitter cooking chocolate, baby. Dizzamn. The taste doesn't change things up very much, though the chocolate's bitterness seems cut a bit. It's still quite a bit of some black-hole-style dark chocolate, don't get me wrong. I think some dark greens and some rich toffee are mixed in there as well, but it's hard to tell with all of this chocolate hangin' 'round here. Not bad, really. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that yearns to be chewy. Overall, a tasty brew that definitely lives up to its name.

It smells of chocolate flakes, cocoa powder, and has a light citrusy hop aspect. It's very appealing on the nose. The flavors are in your face, melted and velvety soft milk chocolate. It really, really makes me think I'm drinking a glass of chocolate milk, ala Nesquick. The flavors are phenomenal and insanely delicious. The aftertaste may be the best part, being rich and bold. This beer is shockingly good. To be honest, I really didn't expect that much but wow. It is also impressively smooth. It's hard to classify this as a traditional American Strong Ale. I feel it should be in a different category. This beer is just too drinkable, and at 9%? I can't believe it. I only got a tad of alcohol at the very end of my glass.

I will have to investigate at a later date. Overall this is delicious. I can best describe it as a desert beer for the warmer seasons like Spring and Summer.

The aroma is of light cocoa with noticeable hops and maybe a hint of caramel thrown in. The aroma is a bit odd. The cocoa flavor comes on very faint at first, then is has a sudden crescendo for a few seconds, then becomes lighter than the initial taste. It ends up being very light cocoa with an odd tartness from the hops. The malts don't make much of an appearance. Overall it's a bit of a letdown.

I personally make Chocolate beers as well, and I have found a Bock to be a nice base for this style, but the Old Ale suits it well too. This beer is well blended and represents what it is supposed to be. I also think that it would age pretty well, so I may pick up a few more to cellar. This might be REALLY good (better than it already is) in a couple years...as long as the Chocolate holds up and doesn't go bitter. I will pick up a couple and see.

The smell is pleasant, with some hot chocolate qualities mixed in with dry pine hops. I also pick up a bit of vanilla, pepper and distinct almond. Unfortunately, the smell was deceiving. I am very confused by this beer. It is almost as if they took an amber or even a pale ale and tried to dissolve a bunch of powdered cocoa in it, and were unsuccessful. It doesn't taste terrible, just not very good. The chocolate tasted like a bittersweet powder and wasn't integrated with the rest of the beer. You tasted the cocoa on one hand then you get some nice vanilla, almond/hazelnut and pepper on the other. Mouthfeel was gritty and unbalanced. I didn't finish the whole 750, not that I couldn't, I'd just had enough. This won't deter me from Boulevard or the Smokestack series, as the rest of them are basically all home runs.","OakedCanuck","Mar 22, 2011"

The 750 mL was a little much for one drinker, but split between two or three it would be fantastic after dinner or even paired with roasted pork.","bump8628","Mar 01, 2011"
3.59,-3.2,3.5,4.5,3,4,3.5,"Thanks to Dan for sharing this one with us after dinner tonight. Poured a medium brown color (we were all surprised at how light it was) with a decent light brown head. Huge chocolate aromas practically leap from the glass, dominating all else. Light to medium bodied, with flavors of chocolate, cocoa and a little toffee.","emmasdad","Mar 01, 2011"
3.31,-10.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"I really love the idea, and Boulevard rarely misses with the Smokestack beers. Though this did not come together as well as I was hoping. It is very interesting, and worth a try. Just not the homerun many of the others in this series have been.","champ103","Mar 01, 2011"

3.9,5.1,4,4,4,3,4,"D= This is a unique beer for sure! I've never thought of how chocolate could work in a beer that didn't have roast malts in the bill. It turns out it works just fine. Instead of having a supporting role this beer lets Christopher's chocolate creation really shine. Worth seeking out.","jjanega08","Feb 27, 2011"
4.32,16.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- pretty easy, the chocolate flavor is a little dominating, so I see this one as an occasional drinker.","lnashsig","Feb 26, 2011"

3.73,0.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a rare occasion beer. Almost a winter warmer which is very appropriate for the craft. It is nearly a cocoa liquer. I find the malt:bitterness:alcohol balance is too far toward the alcohol. Perhaps it needs to age. Anyway, go try it!","MinnesotaRIS","Feb 26, 2011"
4.33,16.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Overall, this was better than I was expecting. The nose was just a little disappointing, but anything that it lacks there it makes up for in the taste and mouthfeel. The ginger cookies were a great suggestion and complement the chocolate, vanilla, and caramel very well. This is highly recommended!","Mississipping","Feb 25, 2011"
3.68,-0.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,2.5,"I'd really like to see this be more like 6% abv. It's not that the alcohol hurts the flavor or aroma, but that it doesn't at all add and is unnecessary. This is a well crafted beer, but I have a hard time believing that anybody is going to drink this more than once, twice at the most.","brewerburgundy","Feb 24, 2011"
4.32,16.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Smooth, easy to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden. The sweetness is balanced somewhat by hop bitterness. Another nice beer from the Boulevard Smokestack Series. I am glad I picked up additional bottles of this beer.","hardy008","Feb 23, 2011"

5,34.8,5,5,5,5,5,"It pours a nice amber color with a creamy white two finger head. Good retention with notes of lacing throughout my glass. Smell is like an expensive box of chocolates with milk and dark chocolate, toffe, vanilla, and dark fruits. Taste is just exactly like it smells with a slight bitter balance to it with hops. Medium body with nice carbonation. Very superb beer and excellent.","nuggetnectar01","Feb 20, 2011"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy reddish color with a big semi loose head and some lace. The aroma is roasty with some of those French chocolate truffles that are dusted in cocoa powder and some light fruitiness. The flavor is fairly bitter with roasted cocoa notes and a decent amount of fruitiness without really crossing that line into sweet. There is some alcohol hottness but not really in a distracting or annoying way. The beer tastes like chocolate but really not in a one dimensional way and gets nutty as it warms. Roasty cocoa is the star here for certain.","BieresDesMoines","Feb 14, 2011"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"750ml bottle $8.99. When i popped the cork I was amazed by the chocolate smell, so rich and yet not overly sweet. It smelled like expensive chocolates. The color was surprisingly amber and I was expecting black or brown. The flavor was more exquisite dark chocolate, very well done. Boulevard has really been impressing me with their smokestack beers and I look forward to the next one.","ArrogantB","Feb 13, 2011"
4.67,25.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5," All in all this is one damn unique and tasty beer. Perfect for a night, (there will only be one or two...or none..depending) where you can just sit down with a trashy novel and read you single sorrows away.","turamarth","Feb 13, 2011"

4.82,29.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is a lot lighter compared to the flavor and aroma. Usually something with intense flavor is a lot heavier. There is a light powdery grit that intensifies the chocolate flavor.","bort11","Feb 12, 2011"
4.12,11.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A good Valentine's Day ale. I wish they had made much more of it so others got a chance at it. I was one of the few who managed to get a bottle of this too. Looking forward to that night here in the next few days. Prosit!","HaysAmerica","Feb 11, 2011"
4.23,14,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall I highly enjoyed this offering. Everything seemed to work together almost perfectly and the chocolate while still being very rich was not over the top. Well done.","Zadok","Feb 10, 2011"
4.15,11.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3,"Really reminds me of a Belgian pale ale with chocolate instead of citrus playing the focus of the flavors. A good beer that really goes out on a limb and does a good job of displaying the chocolate flavors.","bfields4","Feb 10, 2011"

3.62,-2.4,5,3,4,4,3,"An enjoyable experiment to challenge to tongue? Absolutely, and I applaud Boulevard for pushing the norms to brew this beer. Something I'd enjoy again and again? Probably not - just not my glass of beer, no matter the quality.","mdcrouser","Feb 09, 2011"
3.99,7.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,3,3,"From opening, I knew this was going to be an original experience. Christopher Elbow has a great gelato place in KC and I tried his dark chocolate gelato, and I could swear it was an identical chocolate profile. This beer is an ale rather than a stout which I was rather surprised about, I assume they really wanted to put the chocolate at the front of the flavor profile rather than muddle it within a big stout, and do something new. With a great off white head, and a hazy amber color, this beer was quite an experience, and I know every chocolate lover would really love this big beer. Cheers!","Bbloom1989","Feb 09, 2011"
4.4,18.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"I was worried about this one from boulevard, but it doesn't disappoint. This is a very unique brew, and I can see how some folks will not enjoy it as much. I found it to be a very good brew with little touches of luxury. It should be great with a creme brûlée or fruit desserts.","gwguest","Feb 08, 2011"
3.81,2.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Overall, I'm afraid I fell prey to the hype of this beer. While I think it is very good it is a little underwhelming. The fact that it is a one-time brew and the city is scrambling to snatch it all up may have done this beer in expectations wise. I'm very happy to of had this bottle but if this were a seasonal I would not be anxiously awaiting its release every year like I do with so may other Boulevard beers.","gofreaksgo","Beers"
4.29,15.6,4,5,4,4.5,4,"M&D- A fairly light brew. Not at all what i expected to get when i bought the bottle and saw Chocolate ale. Tastes a bit more carbonated than it looks. Tickles the tongue and throat on the way down and sit really well. Great warming feeling that comes with the taste. A 9.1% ABV is great on a cold night. This is really a great brew from Boulevard. I am glad to see that they are reaching out in new directions and collaborating with new ideas and people.","HOPPYKC","0"
