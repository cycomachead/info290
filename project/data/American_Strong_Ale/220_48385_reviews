"First few sips were magic, but I noticed an off almost artificial taste as the beer warmed.  I love the style, but this one didn't do it for me."

"O - 4.25 - This is a very nice and well-balanced offering from Lagunita's that really blurs the lines between a DIPA and a barleywine."

"Look is a clear burnt orange. Darker than copper, I'd say. Tannish, thick, long-lasting head. Smell is of hops, quite perfumy. Makes it hard to wait for the tasting. Taste is balanced very much in favor of hops, so this ale as bitter as a standard IPA, but it's sweet and peppery, and therefore fairly well balanced (excepting malt qualities) probably owing as much to the high alcohol (says 9.3% on my bottle, not 9.7%) as it is to the variety of hops. A strong and more bitter aftertaste, but still sweet and peppery. Somewhat like a vegetable broth, but not overwhelming like you'd notice in Bridgeport's Hop Czar Imperial IPA, for example. It's warming as and after it goes down. There's a slight chewy/oily sensation on my teeth as it lingers and even after it's gone. Leaves the mouth fairly dry and constricted, especially if you wait a few minutes. The combination of the bitter, warming, and drying qualities cause my lips, tongue, teeth and hard palate to feel pleasantly numb. My brain is probably next. Thank you, alcohol! At least let me finish my review before you set in! I really took my time writing it and managed to drink the whole thing before it was completed. Oops!"

"Great tasting IPA that packs a wallop. If you're like me, and will only read this review when you are standing in the store trying to decide what to buy, get this if you plan to share with friends, are stocking a fridge for use over time, or have no plans for tomorrow."

"Pours a deep copper amber with a large lasting beige head, has good head retention and lacing. Aroma is of earthy hops, caramel malt, yeast with some dark fruit undertones. Taste the same as aroma with some good earthy hops bitterness, yeast and some notes of brown sugar. A medium to full body, smooth and a sticky mouth feel, good carbonation on the palate. Finishes with a good portion of sweet caramel malt, yeast a bit of dark fruit and brown sugar flavors and earthy hops on the ending. Has a nice caramel malt character and well behaved hops bitterness. Overall a well balanced and good drinking brew."

"O: This beer is pretty intense and I wasn't really expecting that when I poured it. Perhaps it's because my only other taste of Lagunitas is the very smooth Little Sumpin Ale. A decent beer but it wouldn't be my go-to for Lagunitas, even with my limited exposure."
"Great pouring beer with an even better taste. Well balanced and surprisingly smooth considering the high abv."

"Any review of this beer may be subject to intoxication.  One pint of this ale will twist reality.  Unlike many beers with the ABV of Undercover, you will want to pour another and enter the realm of 4.5 stars of pure enjoyment."

"A great beer. An American Strong Ale, certainly not a malty, high ABV barleywine, but similar taste characteristics. Fantastiic aroma. Love me some strong ales, this one is a keeper. A good beer to keep in the fridge to contrast with your super hoppy beers without having to stray too far from that DIPA style."

"UISDA is an interesting, but ultimately unconvincing experiment. There are a lot of styles being thrown around here, including DIPA, American Barleywine, and Weizenbock, which I assume is what led the brewers to label it as the nebulous ""Strong Ale."" Despite my negative comments, I'd like to revisit this beer afresh when it's less than a month old, as I think the desired flavors will be more present. Still, I expected better shelf-life from a 4-month-old, refrigerated, 9.5% ABV beer from an otherwise excellent brewery."

"O - Delicious beer here. Fantastically balanced hops, alcohol, and sweetness from the citrus fruits that are perfectly complimenting each other. Full bodied and strong. 66 IBUs is hidden well with the sweetness that I can taste. Excellent flavor, aroma, and beautiful orange hue,"

"Another solid Strong Ale from Lagunitas. I like this one better than Brown Shugga, but not as much as the Bastards (Stone). The flavors are well-balanced, but the bitterness on the finish is slightly unpleasant and it needs a little something to push it over the top. Perhaps some oak-aging to add some vanilla notes, complement the booziness, and smooth out the finish????"

"A good beer. I wish Lagunitas had a better method of indicating freshness, I can only hope that this bottle was from this year. Even so, I think this dropped in April so I'm not drinking it nearly as fresh as I should have. Still it's held up well. Good beer."

"Pours a dark amber in color with a good finger+ foamy off-white head. A good amount of lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of ripe oranges at first with brown sugar. The taste is the same and starts out that way with a slightly bitter malt finish. But doesn't linger. You can also taste the higher alcohol content in as well. Perfect carbonation. A different brew but tasty. You aren't going to drink a bunch of these in one sitting, that is for sure. :)"

"Overall: Not impressed and one of my least favorite ""hoppy"" beers from lagunitas. The sweetness almost seems generic with not enough malt flavor to match. It does open up a little bit as it warms, but also gets boozier. Finishes a bit bitter and astringent for my liking. Decent, but not something I will seek out in the future."

"Overall: Honestly the same brew as the ""other"" Undercover ale, just missing the sneak release label on the bottle. Whether it is considered a DIPA or American Strong Ale that is up to you. I had this earlier during the week and had it at the very least five times....addicting. Great brew and especially great price. Drink up and Happy Memorial Day. Salud!"

"A nice ale, but not anything to write home about. It is good, nice aroma and good tase but to me, seems to lack a little care, almost seems to be leaning to the mass produced, less quality style that too many of the big brewers produce. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer and by no way I am not comparing to the Bud Lites of the world. It is enjoyable but doesn't quite reach the standards that have been set by other craft brewers. Overall good job"

"O: I have to admit that I read the label ""We brewed this especially bitter ale...."" and I thought - no good. I do not like really bitter beers. This got shoved to the back of the fridge. I have to admit I really like it. It is not nearly as bitter as I feared. There are some bitter notes in the middle but really well balanced with pine and fruit flavors. There is a slight dry bite at the end but it is not unpleasant. Also the 9.7% ABV comes through a little bit with some heat. Overall this is well balanced and really drinkable."
"This is an amazing brew! Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a nice thick white head. Lots of lacing on the glass as you sip. As looks go you can't do better then this, once poured you won't be able to wait to sip this brew. The high abv isn't unbalanced in the taste of this brew. It has a nice hop flavor but not over board. Very smooth drinking with a slight dryness. Very clean on the palate, it's not heavy or in your face but full bodied and flavorful. The smell is pleasant. The hop comes thru on the smell big time. This is an awesome brew, I had it a while back but never rated it so was waiting to try again before rating. Lagunitas hit this one out of the park as far as this beer drinkers concerned. :)"

"Pours a clear medium amber with a slight dark ruby cast. An exceptional head that retains excellently with massive lacing. This is how a beer should look. The nose is a blend of sweet tropical hops over a slight grapefruit coupled with a sweet caramel background. Almost full bodied with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is quite nice, complex and fairly well balanced. It begins with the tropical and grapefruit hops of the nose which flows into a pleasant tasty bitterness. The bitterness fades into the background hop and caramel sweetness. The finish is smooth and a slight medicinal alcoholic bite lingers. The medicinal finish is the only flaw with this well crafted exceptional ale, but at 9.7% alcohol it is minimal. Excellent job Lagunitas!!"

""

"O - This in a lot of ways reminds me of a blend of Lake Erie Monster and Nugget Nectar. It has the booze and super ripe tropical notes of LEM with the bitter hop balance and malt profile of Nugget Nectar. Overall its a really good beer."
"Pours a deep clear amber with a big creamy ivory head. The head has impressive retention and lasts throughout leaving nice sticky lacing. The aroma is delicious, with nice balance between the floral and citrus hops and the robust malt backbone. The taste is even more complex, with a wide variety of malt and hops flavors balancing against each other and holding the whole beer up. I'd expect such a complicated beer to be a little heavier in body, but it in no way is a problem and there is a nice smooth finish. This is a great example of a strong ale."

"Moderate brown in color with a solid quarter inch thick light brown head. Decent clarity bit clearly there is some kind of minuscule sediment in there when held up to light. Brussels lacing. That telltale hop aroma is consistent with other Lagunitas beers. It's more of a pint like hop aroma but is clearly a blend with some tropical smelling hops. I also get some alcohol and a Belgian yeast aroma and light malt. The front of the palate is sweet grains and alcohol which quickly jumps into that piney/tropical hop flavor. Then there is moderate carbonation and the warmth of alcohol. The fade is dry and more along the lines of the warming alcohol."
"Poured dark amber/honey colored into a tulip glass with a thick foamy head and moderate lacing on the side of the glass. Strong citrus and slightly piney odor. Citrusy malty flavor at the beginning, followed by a slight piney hoppy finish. It leaves slight hoppy aftertaste but not much. It goes down very smooth and hides the alcohol content very well. Very well balanced beer. Very good. Be careful because it is definitely not a session beer."

"O - Lagunitas always finds ways to make amazing beers that are both aggressively hoppy, yet smooth and balanced, and this is no exception."
"Glad I had the chance to try this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Maybe its me and I don't like American Strong Ales, but this has an off flavor and I can't entirely pinpoint it. Either way I will finish it. (No indication of when this was brewed, but this bottle was obtain this year in March)."
""
"Poured this beer in a pint glass. Dark Copper color almost reddish. smells hoppish and the taste is irresistable as i i have known from the other two from this brewery. Goes down smooth for its abv and ibu and o.g. cant say enough about this beer worth trying. another 2 thumbs up"

"O - Not a fan of this style of beer. I like Lagunitas and its obvious they spent some time and energy creating this unique beer but it was not enjoyable for me. Almost a mix between a DIPA and Barlywine."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is closer to a dipa then a strong ale. the alcohol and malts are what keep this from a dipa. Really sweet and strong, and very tasty. A bit of a sipper but very tasty and glad I finally got to try."
""
"Sounds weird, and this brew is quite different. I like it fresh, and age takes away the sharp veggie vibe. Last years is quite good right now. Most strong ales I've had are darker and deeper. This expands its flavor profile away from DIPA towards sweetness and effervescence (Saison style)"
""
""
""
"O-Overall a great strong ale way to go Lagunitas you've never have disappoint me yet"
"overall; satisfying, pretty tasty, up to lagunitas standards but not something i would run to buy again."
""
""
"Found this recent & was drawn to ABV initially . However, this is an outstanding beer. As others have noted a bit similar to DFH90 but a bit on the mellower side. Definitely a rich beer with the alcohol hidden. Be careful with more than one as this beer will sneak up on you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up as part of a mixed 6, well, hate to admit it but it was because of the name. Very interesting. Good looking beer with an awesome smell that has a good bit going on. Very interesting beer, reminds me more of an IPA than anything, wasn't what I was expecting. Enjoyed it plus it gets a lot of bonus point due to the high ABV. Would get again depending upon cost."

"At I believe $2.50 cheaper this has now usurped and falls into lead position. It's been said before on many a thread but I'm now a true believer that Lagunitas provides top 3 bang for buck."

""
""
""
""

"The taste begins with a delightful toasted biscuit malt character but then the earthy hops really kick in and take everything over to result in a dry finish. Nice beer that is worth a try."

"O - I really enjoyed this one. Great for a nightcap or when you want something with a bit more kick. Enjoy. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"What a wonderful beer! I've been a fan of Lagunitas for a while but never saw this on the shelf till recently. It pours a beautiful brown into my IPA glass with a nice thick 1 inch head. It reminds me of a slightly hoppier DFH 90 minute. A very nice hoppes presence but with a malty end. All in all, a very good beer with a well hidden kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

" The taste is a complex blend of citrus ans spice flavors from NW hops and some yeast in the taste which brings a fruity dark berry quality with moderately sweet almost caramel flavor in the malt which supports the hop bitterness. The alcohol is relatively subdued and emphasizes a slight spice/pine-like element more toward the finish but there is still enough sweetness to blanket the palate as it finishes smooth. Overall I like the intensity it is a little sweeter than most in this style, could almost be blurring the lines of English barleywine but is very hoppy which is why I think it fits the style of American Strong well - pretty drinkable but I would share this if possible."

"The Verdict: Delicious. Complex and well balanced, this is another great example of Lagunitas’ stand out American Strong Ales. I’d love to down the six pack, but I don’t think I’d make it through two of them. Maybe I should have eaten something."

"O- For the style, this is an exceptional beer. However, this is too reminiscent of Lagunitas' Brown Shugga' to make it stand out in their profile. However, being an absolute fan of the latter, I am fortunate to have a similar (yet seasonal) offering without having to wait an entire year. If you assume that UCIS-DA is yet another Double IPA, then think again. If you are a fan of (fresh) Brown Shugga', then you can revel in a second round come this Spring Seasonal. (4.5)"

"Dark Amber in color with a fantastic head that left a pretty sticky web of lacing on the glass. Nose is sweet with tropical fruits and pine; resin, a sweet maple candy note, boozy and warm smelling at the end. The maple candy flavor is at the forefront along with tropical fruit and resin from the hops. Sweet and boozy with very little back end bitterness. Warms the chest once it's down. Full mouthfeel with ample carbonation to keep it from feeling like syrup. While there is definitely hop bitterness at the end, there is not quite enough to give this beer balance, and it comes across as rather too sweet and heavy. While it's not perfect, it is definitely unique and has it's own signature flavor. Lagunitas makes my favorite beers, hands down. Little sumpin, sumpin, Brown Sugga, Lagunitas Sucks are all amazing brews, and Undercover Investigation is set to join the line of winners from this brewery."
""
""
"This beer has it all. Much like brown sugga but I think this one has a bit more bitterness from whatever hop profile was used. The sweetness is also a bit more cane sugar and honey where brown sugga is what it says. Really been liking lagunitas lately and this one boosts my overall impression of them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the probably the first Lagunitas beer I actually don't like. Still, it's not exactly bad - there are whispers of a good strong ale to be found, what a shame the extensive caramel backbone runs roughshod over everything. That, and it becomes rather harsh when warmed up sufficiently. I won't be returning to this one when just about everything else from Lagunitas shows off their (awesome) house character better."

"Another offering from one of my favorite breweries. This one pours a beautiful reddish light mahogany color with an ample and lasting off white head that leaves very substantial lacing. The aroma is a perfect blend of west coast hops and rich malty sweetness. The nose is quite dank with citrus, pine, and grass hops as well as a very nice amount of malt to balance the beer. The mouthfeel is smooth but thick and coating in the best way. The flavor is everything the nose promises but not quite so balanced. It is a very well crafted beer but the hops slightly overtake the malt in the mouth. It is sweet but not the rich sweetness that you get from a well made barleywine, almost unnecessarily sweet. This is good but not my favorite from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
"O: Lagunitas did a great job with this beer, not overpowering for a strong ale and the abv content is not that noticeable."
"Pours a clear dark copper color with over a finger of off-white head that retains for some time. The nose is mildly hoppy. The hop bitterness is there in the flavor, but the driving force of this beer is certainly the malt. The body is light considering the ABV and malt forward nature of the offering. The finish is semi-dry and the alcohol warmth rears its head slightly."
""
""
""
"O- This might be one of those ""on the fence"" beers. While not perfect, it falls on the right side of the fence for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a rich, tasty brew with some nice vinuous grape notes. It's got a bright, bitter copper penny streak running through it. An enjoyable strong ale, but I think I prefer Brown Shugga."
"Others have compared it to an IPA x barleywine brew, or a DIPA; both comparisons I strongly agree with."

"O- Hands down, the most impressed I have ever been of any beer I've ever had!!!"
"Draft poured into a sample glass. Crystal clear deep amber color with a nice head, mild lacing down the glass. The aroma is unique--a mixture of grapefruit and mandarin oranges, very rich and rewarding. Flavor is unique, mild to moderately bitter, mild citrus, with a bit of vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium, almost chewy. Overall this is an outstanding ale and I can't wait to try it again."
""
"They keep doing it, I have reviewed a few now by this brewery. At first I had a few that I was not impressed at all about, but the more I keep trying them lately it was me or I was getting older batches, something. Maybe I should revisit them. Although, I have found that breweries that do great ales and IPA's don't make the best lagers or pilsner's. The one I hit hard was the Pils, anyway, to this one, it was amazing. The hops was there, for sure, but it was so well balanced. It was in the same line as the Sucks, of which I have one or two left, so I may do a comparison. Anyway, the color was nice reddish brown and the aroma was magnificent. So far this is my favorite Cali brewery for sure, I need to revisit Stone, as I have been hearing a lot about the Enjoy by series, anyway, this one is awesome, not much to complain about here. Just go find some!"

"pours dark red with finger or so of head . aromas of sweet sugary fruits and some hops. a bit west coasty. the flavor has the hops too, slightly bitter offset bit a big syrupy fruity maltiness. actually a lot of complexity to be taken. some darker fruits and lot of booze upon warming"

"O - 4.5 - Great strong ale. I like it better than the big name american barley wines like Sierra Nevada Bigfoot because it's a little bit easier drinking. At 9.7% it's not that much weaker either."

"This strong ale certainly lived up to its billing. There was very nice lacing left in the glass and the flavor was certainly complex. This was billed as a bitter ale but I feel that they did a great job of balancing the bitterness with other flavors that allowed for easier drinkability. I did notice that this left a pleasant sticky mouthfeel that made you feel like you were drinking something that was well made. I also enjoyed that this ale was high alcohol without hitting you over the head with it. Would definitely look for this ale again."

"Overall: I absolutely appreciate the effort to make a unique beer (that's why I seek out craft beers in the first place), but this really is tough to drink given the out of control sweetness. There are some good flavors here too, but the alcohol and candy flavors just squash everything for me."
"D: Max would be two. I would compare it to eating more than one bowl of ice cream; too much sweetness can cause damage..."

"Overall, this is the last beer from a case I got last spring. An excellent beer I should have drank up fresh. I don't think the age has done anything for this one and possibly has hurt the flavor. Still it's very good today, but my next case will be gone before the the 4th of July."

"Enjoyed a single bottle poured into an American-style pub glass. Looks like whiskey, a gentle reddish amber color with a fearsome beige head of around four inches height. Aroma is citrus-forward, tangy and fruity with a faint chocolate and rum note, raisins, grapefruit rind, pine oil. Smells very hoppy but tastes very malty. I get a massive dollop of orange cream, candied mandarins, raisins, sweet rum, brown sugar, apple peels, and a nondescript floral note that flits in and out of awareness. There is enough pine resin and other hop aromatics to numb the mouth just a little, but a barley sugar sweetness protrudes and gathers steam, settling on the palate to keeps things firmly anchored in malt territory. Amazing mouthfeel on this one. The body is sticky and oily, a buttery chew is discernible and the whole package is syrupy but not over the top in this regard. Less boozy than expected, particularly when you consider than some other Lagunitas brews do not shy away from alcohol aromatics (e.g., the Imperial Stout). Finish is wet and juicy, with some grass flavors apparent along with an earthy spice. Sweet but still capable of inducing some eye-watering hop heroics. Unique brew and very tasty. I love the Lagunitas website descriptor ""Imperial Mild"". Indeed."

"This is another strong beer from Lagunitas both in terms of alcohol and flavor. It pours a dark amber with good carbonation and a strong aroma of hops and toffee. The taste has the usual Lagunitas’ hops balanced with a good malt and caramel backbone. This is definitely a full-bodied beer with a strong complex flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed."

"Pours a deep, rich amber color, with a thick, foamy, rocky head that clings to the lip of the glass. The aroma is a bright, semi-sweet combination of citrus and pine that is bold but not overly assertive. The flavor is much more aggressive, though, with a potent, resinous pine forest hop character that is only mildly countered by a bready malt sweetness. The sticky, resinous, full mouthfeel becomes weighty after a while. Overall, this is a bold, hop-dominant IIPA/Strong Ale that is quite nice in a single glass but might be too much for me to enjoy multiple servings at once."

"Not enjoying this one nearly as much as before, so downgrading a few scores quite a bit: smell from 4.5 to 3.25, taste from 4.5 to 4, mouthfeel from 4.5 to 4 and overall from 4.5 to 4. In view of my previous very high rating, I'm going to get a sixpack and run through them to see how prevalent the vinegar aroma really is. It's not really offensive except in the aroma, just not as tasty as caramel malt!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy reddish amber with a small white head. Smells of syrupy alcohol with some piney and flowery hops, very nice. Tastes of earthy hops slight roasted malt body with slight booze taste. Beer is full bodied, boozy, and nicely carbonated. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very drinkable high ABV big beer. Quite sweet up front but a load of hops cuts the sweetness for an excellent finish. Highly recommended."

"Overall this is another winner from Lagunitas. A well balanced mix of malts and hops which masks its high alcohol content very well. A worthy representation of the style."
""
""
"Despite its chalky and minerally linger- this raw and rustic ale is much more refined than its inspiration would suggest. Sure- there's a chip on their shoulder and this ale squarely reflects that. But there's also an elegant masculinity that suggests that the brewery has gotten past that part of their history."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable. This is way more malty than you'd expect from a Lagunitas ~10% brew, but the hop kick keeps you smiling. I'm glad I picked up another 6-pack of it before it goes away."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall i was a bit disappointed with this brew. Seems when i had it back in 2007 it had more of a hop balance. Also, i am very sensitive to sourness in beer and I am definitely catching that flavor. Not sure if there was some unintentional cross pollination at the brewery..."
""
""
""
""
""
"A rather anonymous yet well crafted strong ale: I don’t really see the point."
""
"I've always avoided Lagunitas for no good reason. An extremely irrational avoidance! as Undercover shows."

"The combination of citrus and brown sugar reminds me of ham glaze. This is not the first time I have said this about a Lagunitas beer. And this also includes some bread. It's like a meal! This is an interesting beer, but Lagunitas' lighter offerings are a better representation of the brewery."

"well rounded, woody, earthy with a hop edge. very nice IPA variation."

"The alcohol is hidden well and the feel is smooth but slightly astringent. This is a great ale, not incredibly diverse, but very well constructed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong malt backing with plenty of sticky pine hops makes for a delicious, robust, and balanced DIPA. Alcohol is 100% unnoticeable. Just an all-around solid brew."
""
"A lot of beer. Big, intense and lasting. I would like a little less sweetness on the palate, but what a wonderful effort."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well some big wraps on this bad boy lets see and it pours a clear red copper hue with a billowing four finger head that's stays and leaves lacing everywhere,the smell is toffee,bready malts,pine,ripe fruits and booze,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of fairy floss,bready malts,toffee,honey and finished like a ripe fruit wine dry and boozy and overall it's definitely a unique drop and really different to the rest of their range and nice for a cold night a perfect sipper cheers."

"Appearance is a deep clear reddish color with generous white head and heavy lace. Nose is hoppy with note of pine and earth, paired with a strong malt backbone that brings a bit of molasses and honey to the smell. Taste starts sweet and malty and has strong pine hops paired with some citrus and honey. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy with appropriate carbonation. Overall, quite delicious and hoppy, borders on American barleywine territory."

"O-Great malty red especially considering the ABV it is dangerously sessionable. The texture was hearty and very little bitterness."
""
"Pours tall into my Sam Smith goblet. The lacing just won't quit, it keeps clinging to the sides. The body colors a perfect amber. The scent is what really distinguishes it from the finest euro ales. Piney hops blast through and then roll into molasses. The flavor rolls from pineapple to fig, picking up untouched sugar cane and evergreen forest. There's a little alcohol burn to warn you. Worth seeking out. About 4 months after bottling."
""
""
"O: A real winner in the Lagunitas line-up, although it has a touch too much molasses/sugar. Overdoing it on the sugar doesn't decrease the intensity of alcohol present (if that was the objective), it simply covers up the hops, at least for my palette. Besides that, a fantastic brew that is worth your time; hoppy, woody, and pretty well refined. The flavors in this brew go well together, just a pinch less sugar!"
""
""
""
""
"A sipper. A beer to savor. Tasty and full flavored, becoming elegant as it warms. A treat on a warm summer night, but this is also a beer that could hold it's own in the dead of winter."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a great beer. The blend of hops, barley and malt work beautifully to cover the alcohol and you could easily down more than a few without knowing that you are the suspect of the Undercover Shutdown:).

"Wonderful barley-wine style ale. Nice pale appearence and hoppy aroma. An excellent balance of malt and hops. Strong enough to give you a nice slap in the face. A solid strong ale. Excellent value at only $9.99 a SIX pack. Could sell at $10.99 a four pack in today's QE3 economy. Will try to emualte via homebrew."

"O: Huge hop nose and massive bittering hops on the palate with a sticky and sweet caramel malt backbone. For my personal preference, the hops overpower the beer; this was probably the intent and to that end it is successful; it is just a bit out of balance for me."

"Notes: Solid Strong Ale. More malty than hoppy, but there is a significant hop presence. Hints of alcohol but nothing too outrageous. Overall it is a fairly balanced Strong Ale with a bold, yet balanced flavor. Nice beer, particularly for the price, but nothing amazing."

"Pours a richer copper amber combo color, clear and inviting. Half-inch of fluffy off-white head. Mix of malts and hops in the initial smell. Malts are up front and hit the palate high, with hops providing reinforcement. Alcohol complements the other flavors nicely, but this belies the actual %. Distinct and pleasant mouthfeel, no overpowering, but hard to ignore."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent sipper. Just a great beer full of malty goodness (and that Lagunitas hop touch) that I have no problem taking some time with."
"Undercover Investigation offers all the typical Lagunitas flavors with a big booze punch. Far too easy to drink this huge beer."
""
""
"Dreamy copper-brown color, light-snowy head and bloomy lacing. Smells of brown sugar, sweet malt, and citrusy hops. Tastes stronger than you'd expect. More malt comes through than hops, but it finds a way to maintain an earthy presence while remaining balanced. This is a punchy ale, and there's no hiding that high ABV in its full-body. Finish is sweet and thin; Exactly what you'd want in a strong ale and a fine alternative for a frequent DIPA drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is very sweet, unlike what I expected from their ""Virtual Taste"" video that they published on YouTube. I was expecting it to be pretty bitter. However, I'm surprised this beer is 9.7% ABV because there is no alcohol presence in the taste. This is a really good sweet beer that will pair excellent with any spicy food."
""
"overall: a great hoppy sweet beer from Lagunitas, I would buy again. The sweetness and hoppiness is very well balanced and the alcohol is not too noticeable, one of my favorites from them."
""
"Really good strong hoppy ale. Most similar to an imperial/double IPA to me. Definitely worth trying and would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"really not that impressed by this one. i've had many better beers by them.. this is pretty much a less sweeter version and lower abv version of brown shugga. with that said, i don't understand why it's a springtime release. i'd probably appreciate this a lot more if it were cold out."
""
""
""
"Medium thickness with oily hop textures. Surprised at the lack of alcohol present for the high abv, but it is well hidden. Overall, I really like this brew. Will definitely seek out some more and recommend to friends."
""
"Overall this comes off as just a big solid and controlled hoppy amber to me more than a strong ale, and that appeals greatly to me. Real well put together brew, and love the mix of fruit and dank earth hop profile on this as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This beer is awesome. It comes very close to the DIPA side of the spectrum as it is very hop-forward, but the extra sweet malts and spices make it more than that. It is very tasty and definitely drinkable, especially given the ABV. It has a nice, smooth burn from the alcohol and tons of flavor. I highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
"O - I would highly recommend this beer to anyone even if they are apprehensive of hops overpowering their beer. And as I stress once again, 9.6% alcohol, it'll get the job done. Well done Lagunitas, you have yourselves another winner."

"Had this one on tap a couple times before. Finally getting around to review this. Served in a snifter with a finger of white sticky creamy head this beer is a bit murky and amber with plenty of orange highlights. Aromas of hops aplenty. Citrus and herbal. Malt is biscuity with caramel. A marmalade character to this beer. Taste is malty and sweet with a hoppy backdrop that is similar to the aroma with a fair amount of resin. Mouthfeel is a bit slick in the finish and a bit warming. A heavy malt bill that is a bit cloying. Alcohol in the finish but not vapory in the mouth. Overall this is a solid brew that doesn't offend or jump out at me. Nice beer given the high alcohol."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/14/2013. Pours moderately cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention; that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pine, orange zest, orange rind, pineapple, floral, grass, caramel, and floral earthiness. Excellent aromas with big hop presence and complexity with a fair amount of malt balance. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange rind, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, pine, floral, caramel, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice hop flavor complexity; with a moderate malt balance that does not overpower the hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent hoppy strong ale. Great hop flavor complexity and moderate malt balance; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Lagunitas, you guys always swing for the fences and you almost always connect! At 9+ ABV this is easy to drink, even though the alcohol presence is noticeable. This beer looks strong, smells of candy and alcohol, and the taste and mouthfeel leave you wanting more! Another great beer in the Lagunitas line-up, but definitely a notch or two below Sucks and A Little Sumpin."
""

""

"Big strong beer! Had out of the bottle into a pint glad. Lots of booze. Decent color with a soft, flat head. Good looking American Ale, copper color. Big aroma of hops and sugary fruit. You can, as other have noted, taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel has a good deal of carbonation and a bit of spice."

"O - This is an awesome beer, for a 9.6% it seems like a 7.5-8%. Its only 10$ for a 6 pack and extremely tasty. One of the top 5 beers I have had. I will be getting a case of this for sure to cellar some of it."
""
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this American Strong Ale. Not my favorite by Lagunitas, but that isn't saying much because they generally kick ass."
"O - I picked up this beer completely blind based on my love of all the Lagunitas products that I've had. This one was much maltier and much boozier than I expected. I would not buy it again, and will be more careful about selecting brews blindly based on previous experience. I still rate Lagunitas as my 3rd favorite brewery."

"O- This and Brown Shugga are two very perplexing beers. Both are so intense with the sweetness and alcohol while the hops just assault away at the same time. Complex, but not really. I'm probably gonna let my six-pack sit for a while so the hops and booze calm down a bit."
"O: Great looking beer that has a great aroma too. Taste was not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The style is ""American Strong Ale," a catch-all beer category which may be a sub-category of an American IPA. The beer tastes like an IPA to me- hop pungency and bitterness. Regardless of the style, it is worth trying. Highly recommended. It may be my new Lagunitas favorite."

"O: Rich and super malty with a grand entrance of resinous hops to clean the sweet away. Really good balance and basically a toned down barley wine. Super easy drinkability that makes this a dangerous brew."
""
""
""
""

""
"A good beer that quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: Typical ASA due to the loads of hops and a higher ABV. Wouldn't really fit into any other category. Like a lightweight Barleywine. Excellent beer for when Winter is leaving and Spring approaching (we're in May already!). Lots of hops and lots of malt. Go buy a six pack already."

"Poured into becker. Golden-orange, the color of honey, with a moderately thick white head made of dense foam with visible carbonation rising. Smells similar to Sucks, but with less of the spicy/pungent hops; this smells like mango and pineapple, with the herbal pungent hop scent only ghosting in at the end. Taste is smooth at first, but quite bitter in the mouth, but the bitterness is washed away by the sweet finish upon swallowing. Then, the bitter aftertaste lingers, begging you to take another sip. This is a complex and incredibly well-balanced beer. The interplay between the flavors is amazing. The mouthfeel is medium, but slick."
"O: I was really impressed by this one. Yet, it seemed to taste quite a bit like their own Lagunitas Sucks. Having both in my fridge at the same time, I had to make sure I had grabbed the right bottle. Also, this is supposed to be an American strong ale and it felt a lot more like an IIPA."

"O: decent but forgettable. wouldn't seek it out. i've got a bone to pick with lagunitas. it seems as if they are cranking out limited releases to use up ingredients or something. this beer reminds me of a lighter wilco tango foxtrot. the recipes don't vary enough. i usually love lagunitas, but i'm not crazy about this one."
""

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. There is a bit of a sticky mouthfeel, and there is a long bitter finish. The alcohol is not well disguised, which is disappointing. Not as good as other Lagunitas beers, but still pretty good."

""
""
"Lagunitas Sneak Release Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale pours a clear orange red with a nice creamy head that lingers for quite a while. From the moment I opened the bottle I was hit with big citrusy hop aroma, grapefruit, and pine backed up with a good amount of malt sweetness. The sweetness is predominate in the flavor, lots of caramel and toffee, but there is no lack of citrusy hop flavor. There is a nice bitterness that rounds out the beer, but not overpowering for the beers strength. A bit of alcohol comes through in the finish, but not too much for a beer of the strength."

"not to be a buzzkill, because I think lagunitas has been trending in the right direction lately, but this beer is a step backwards in my opinion. it looks like a standard copper ale, but with a jovial white head an inch or so high, with excellent retention and some spotty lacing. it smells like camp according to my girlfriend, not summer camp from your youth, but like our hunting lodge on lake champlain that was built in the 30s and smells like aged wood and relaxation. I wouldn't be that kind. to me it smells like booze, cantaloupe, and hop oil. there is plenty of caramel malt and a gentle sweetness to the flavor, the hops are generically sweet, and yes, again, its the lagunitas generic yeast (if you've read my reviews of lagunitas, you know how much I harp on their blanket use of a single strain). to me, this is a generic strong ale, arrogantly named, and lacking the complexity and balance of their better offerings. fuller bodied, but not super dense, and carbonated on the relaxed side. im really glad I didn't get more than a single. although I don't hate it, im sort of fed up with this type of beer from this brewery, its obvious they have the skill to take it further, this was a letdown."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, herbal hops, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with some herbal, dank hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but this one is super herbal and dank which makes sense with the story as to why this beer was created."
""
"Overall: This is a very drinkable beer. In fact I’m mildly drooling just writing this review and have already hoarded a couple six-packs in my basement. The amount of booze in this beer is sneaky - you can’t even tell that it it’s a high ABV until you’ve had enough sips that the telltale boozy warmth sets in. The flavor is well-balance between hops, bitterness and sweetness and my best guess is this will drink well on a warm or cold day; it strikes me as versatile. I’d also recommend this brew to any craft beer newbies out there because it’s full-flavored with a lot of balance - it’s a great example of a well-done brew."
""
""
""
"O: I know a lot of people like this, but I am not a fan. I got it for the limited release nature and because I have enjoyed their other stuff. I won't be finishing it, but will be making beer bread with it instead, where the malts will give it a nice sweetness. There will now be more for others to have."
""
"O- very hop forward and boozy, but nice floral hop notes, definitely a slow sipper"
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a translucent copper with a foamy, two inch cream-colored cap the reveals delicate, textured bands of lacing as the head slowly dissipates. Nose expresses citrus rind and tangerine esters. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a candied sugar presence intermixed with a pleasant herbal/earthy hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a tasty brew with a fair amount of complexity and a well-hidden abv. The more I have from Lagunitas, the more I ask myself why I haven't tried more of their offerings sooner."

"My second and third sips made me a bigger fan. I really did enjoy the complete balance this beer has."
""
"The beer pours a rusty brown-red with a small eggshell white head that fades quickly into a scrim with some big soapy bubbles floating around in it. In body, the beer appears clean of particles with a slight chill haze and a darkness from the thicker malts in the beer. It leaves a lacing network of thin, slippery, and wet dots and strands along the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells like a big old pine tree was shoved into a bowl of pithy grapefruits. A smooth caramel malt with touches of toffee and biscuit sits beneath the huge hops, but really this beer is all about the big old piney bouquet that nearly drips from the nose and does have a touch of dankness to it, as well as some muted tropical fruit smells that blend with the sweet malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely bitter from the hops with a good creamy sweet malt underneath, a light touch of acid, and a big, sweet, shivering punch from the alcohol in this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet grapefruit juice with touches of pineapple and orange, working into resinous pine with big bitter shivers that wriggle over the tongue. The flavor displays sweet toffee and caramel in light splashes throughout the taste as the bitter flavors move in waves across the tongue, but the bitters are the stars of the flavor. Alcohol also adds a slightly cloying sweetness to the tongue, though it is balanced out by the huge bitters of the beer. The finish runs hot with alcohol and piney hops, which is not the most pleasant thing, and does cut back on what had been a very pleasing explosion of flavors. The aftertaste is bitter and slightly medicinal with very faint touches of sweet biscuit and pithy grapefruit on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels just slightly on the heavier side of medium with a creamy and weak carbonation that only provides a slight scrub against the big sweet alcoholic flavors of the beer. The mouth is left with a lovely bitter burn and some acid-neutralizing saliva on the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a nice hoppy American strong ale. Its alcohol is a little out of check, but that is to be expected in the beer style. This beer displays beautiful amounts of hoppiness alongside nice mellowing malts, and that is quite nice. This beer is much more of a sipper than a chugger, but is lovely for the cool nights of early spring. I do wish there was a little more carbonation and a little less alcohol in the taste, but overall this is a good beer. Try it."

"O: Lagunitas excels at producing high ABV, good, yet unremarkable beers at decent prices. UISDA is no exception. Balanced? Check. Clean? Sure. Memorable? Doubt it. I have a hard time judging it to style, since ""American Strong Ale"" is so vague a descriptor. I need to do more research to help solidify what the epitome is of this style, but whatever the outcome, I doubt Lagunitas will make the finals."

"O - A very good brew that showcases what Lagunitas does well. For $10 a six pack at 9.6% abv, this beer is already a steal. It seems to be more of an english barleywine to me even with the slight presence of hops. If aged, i could see this thing being a VERY good english barleywine. Ive gotten so used to high alcohol beers being masked by flavors that now that I can feel the warming again, I kinda miss that aspect. Very good brew. Pick it up if you can find it. I am going to age a couple and drink them in 6 months and 1 year to see what happens."

"I believe this is the first ale I've had in this style from Lagunitas, and I'm glad it ends up being drinkable and flavorful, despite any shortcomings or exaggerated aspects it may have. The sweetness is actually pretty pleasant in midst of the ridiculous alcohol and hop profile this contains, and makes this a good enough candidate to revisit in the future. This should age pretty well, too. This thing will get you pretty wasted though, so drink respectfully!"

"Final Thoughts: I'm torn between a 4 and a 4.25 for the grade. In this type of situation I always opt for the lower number. Make no mistake, this is a good and enjoyable beer from one of my new favorite breweries, Lagunitus, that treads the style line between American Strong Ale and Double IPA. At $9.99 for a six-pack it is a fantastic deal that should not be passed up by any hop head. I was hoping to add three or four of these to my cellar but I expect they are best enjoyed fresh. Would I drink it again? Certainly."
"It's a Lagunitas beer. Decent, but not necessarily earth-shattering or stellar. Sweet and incredibly drinkable for the style. A bit thin and boozy in the long run, but it's worth checking out at least once."
""
""
""
"O: Another great offering from Lagunitas that is surprisingly drinkable at almost ten percent. Wish it had a little more body but honestly that's nit picking. For a $9 6 pack, you can't beat this."
""
"O - I was very excited to see a 6 pack of a Lagunitas brew I have never tried at my local store. $9.99 for a 6 pack of a 9.5% amazing beer? Lagunitas beers blow me away, and they are the most reasonable priced almost always. Quickly becoming my favorite brewery. Try this one if you see it!"

"Overall- Strong ale indeed, overall reminds me a lot of Arrogant Bastard, although it has been a awhile since I've had AB. Citrus hops are all around this beer and I could do with a little less of them. Price point is great just like all of Lagunitas's brews, still holds the title for the best value brewery around. 4.25"

"Was very disappointed with this. Big fan of sucks, sumpin sumpin, hop stoopid, and ipa. Initially I was very excited when I saw it was another iipa from lagunitas. Looked great, but smell was quite boozy to me and a little off-putting, taste at first was decent but left a boozy, malty and strange after taste. Really wanted to like this beer as I really am a fan of lagunitas, but I wish I went with my gut and just got a single bottle of this instead I'd the sixer I bought. Overall I didn't find this beer to be very hoppy at all and I personally would t really consider it to be a iipa, but what do I know?!"

"Another choice Lagunitas beer. As a great man once said, ""F the haters""."

"Tim"

"Saw this beer in the area of my package store where the Lagunitas sucks used to be, figured I had to give it a shot. The beer is definitely above average for a dipa but I found it oddly lacking in aroma. The color is a clean clear copper, leaves good lacing in the glass. The smell is a mild hops/boozy scent not much malt on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid, with a nice abrasiveness that only a good ipa can provide. Taste is obviously hop forward, resin, slightly boozy with a strong hop bitter finish. Balance is not on this beers agenda. Overall, this is worth a six pack, a nice sipping beer that is served better on the higher side of cellar temperatures. However be warned at close to 10% abv it's likely not a session beer."
"O: This is an almost perfect example of what an American Strong Ale can be. Super tasty, very smooth, and plenty of alcohol with almost none detectable. Well done Lagunitas!!"

"Pours a copper color with white head. A fragrant pine hop smell immediatly hits your nose. The taste is a little more sweet malt forward and not as hoppy as your typical Lagunitas beer, but a nice piney hop flavor and bitterness make this strong ale a perfectly balanced beer and a sure pleaser for any hop head. The 9.7% abv is almost non existent. Very dangerous! I don't think there is a brewer that puts out so many consistent winners like Lagunitas."
"O: Glad this was re-released. Enjoyed 2 in the initial sitting.... 4 more in the fridge!"
""
"Poured a clear copper, with a generous off-white foam crown. Smell of fresh hops, clean and sharp with a touch of herbal, and you can detect some biscuity notes just below. Taste is amazing, very strong, very hop-forward, but with a crisp malty backbone that keeps it balanced while allowing the hops to rage. Mouthfeel is thick enough for the style, but surprisingly smooth and refreshing. Decent carbonation, extreme drinkability. I love and respect Lagunitas ability to put out interesting and aggressive beers that are instant classics and showcase superb drinkability"

"This beer says, ""I will skullfuck you."" And it does."

"Barleywine-like strength with well-kilned grains and citrus hops. Lots of ruby red grapefruit, toffee, light vanilla extract fume, and red grapes. Fruity with a flair of Angostura Bitters flavor.

A little scrub at first and a little late."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Dark orange brown with a nice white head and lacing. Hoppy, caramel malt aroma, similar to a barley wine. Nice creamy, malty body with toasted and caramel malt and dark fruit. Fairly understated, but complex and well balanced. Hops are forward but not aggressive. The ABV is well covered. I like this one. Close to a DIPA."

"Pour is a dark amber color with minimal head and retention (could have resulted from tap). Smell was hard to pick out - faint at best - with a hint of candy. Taste is really well balanced stronger beer - definitely hops as expected from Lagunitas but on the mIlder side for those that have trouble with spicier and sweeter hops. For a stronger beer this has been enjoyable on a hot day."
""
"C-"
"O: Very enjoyable but not the easiest beer in the world to drink, The taste, smell, and mouthfeel of the alcohol are well hidden in this beer but you can kind of tell this is a big beer. Definitely one for sipping with the high ABV and the moderately strong bitterness."
"This is one of my top 5 special releases of the season. Beautiful golden-red color. Good nose-not overly fruity; just wonderful ( I wish they made hops air freshener!) Let it get nice and warm as the flavor comes out so much better. Just the right balance of hops and malt to make it a great sipper. Alcohol is well hidden if cold, but when you let it warm you will feel it bite your tongue a bit. Beware, have only one or you'll need a lawyer for your DUI. My favorite ale-bar none. Question for Lagunitas: Why am I just getting this in late July when it was released in April?"
""

"Pretty solid brew. Slightly syrupy but with good carbonation makes it feel like a heavy bodied brew. Faintly smoked malt underneath hearty biscuits with caramel, dark fruits and vanilla. Spicy and herbal hops cover the high abv slightly but not totally. A nice layered complex brew with flavors that like to be together. Right up there with Arrogant Bastard."
""
"This is one of my favorite seasonals from Lagunitas. Red amber color with copious amounts of chapagne bubbling. Small white froth that laces the glass quite well. Sweet, Tangy smell, with noticeable hops. A floral, sweet, and creamy front end with a bitter piney aftertaste and some alcohol warming. Very enjoyable, but might be tough to have more than a few due to the hoppiness- and at 9.7%ABV, probably not a wise move anyway. Usually I like to enjoy one beer- and this is a good one that even gets more complex as it warms."

"Had it since the first year it was released, saw a single bottle for sale and picked one up. Copper deep amber body with a light colored white head. Fine speckled lacing. Aroma has a toffee toasted malt character with an earthy/citric hop nose going on as well. Big alcohol layers hidden in the sweet and hoppy notes I'm getting. Flavor, has a toasted malt character with sweet sugary notes and alcohol burn going on with a big massive hoppy resinous quality about it, grapefruit and citrus malts burst to blend the flavors into what we are drinking here. Mouthfeel, is medium to full bodied with the high burn of alcohol coming through. Resinous oily hop oils coming on with each sip, still not a bad beer just a bit bigger in alcohol than I typically care for. It stays away from the barleywine zone, but damn fine overall."

"Overall - Another sweet, hoppy grapefruit release from Lagunitas. I love it, but I'd like to see something different from this brewery. Does well to hide the high 9.8% ABV."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall, I thought it was a very good beer. The hoppiness was really good, and the malts compliment very well. It really comes together well, very nice overall."
""
""
"O: it doesn't disappoint. Lagunitas makes good beer at a great price point and this beer is no exception. Might pick up another one to try down the line to see how the malts shine without the hops in your face"
""
""
"Overall: I don't generally care for DIPAs with a big malt bill and I was a little wary of this beer but really like both the malt and hop profiles - surprised I haven't had it before"
""
""
"A decent strong ale, though nothing stood out as very enjoyable."
""
"O: this is somewhere between a strong ale and a DIPA - has the heartiness and malt character of some strong ales, but undeniable citrus and pine hoppiness suggest the DIPA - i.e., what's not to like?"
"The aftertaste is a relatively balanced sweet-bitter, but the hops tip the scale in the end and make a near excellent strong ale have a gross, undesired aftertaste. I still do t like the style, but this isn't a bad representation."
""
""
"This was a really solid beer. It had huge flavor. I think it could stand to be more malty but huge floral, citrusy hops and a laid back malt character is how Lagunitas seems to role. That being said I'm along for each and every ride. This reminds me quite a bit of their Imperial Red Ale. It has much the same hop character. The body and ABV are a bit bolder. Nonetheless, it's got solid flavor and drinkability. It's definitely worth a try."
""
""
"o) overall I was pleasantly surprised with this beer from Lagunitas. I'm a fan of most of their beers but they all start to taste very similar. This one deviated enough. Easy to drink as if it was sessionable; can't believe it's 9.7."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent. I like it. Recommended. Bitter hops, sweet citrus, caramel malt."
"O: I've had this plenty of times before and just now got around to reviewing it. This certainly isn't my favorite offering from Lagunitas, but it isn't bad either."
""
""
""
"A strong ale that hints towards double IPA, the big amount of sweet malt mostly separate it from that categorization though.A bit of a sipper but very enjoyable. Definitely diggin Lagunitas."

"O - A very drinkable beer which is a problem considering just how strong this monster is. Lagunitas did a wonderful job hiding the alcohol though and the beer is a clear winner."
""
""

"What can I say? It smells real nice. I enjoyed smelling it. I did not enjoy drinking it. In fact, I drank very little of it. Not my cup of tea. Sharp alcohol and bitterness drown out any goodness."

"Overall Impression- A very interesting Strong Ale... Very hoppy, creamy, and citrus flavored for one but didn't mind at all! Lagunitas always has a different side of things with their styles and I dig it! A tougher beer to drink so I would recommend splitting a 6-pack with 3 or more friends!"

"O- hop heads should check this out as this could likely be called a dipa and not many would be the wiser"
"thanks my brother."
"O- I picked this beer because it was basically the only one on tap at Ortinos that wasn't a pumpkin beer or Oktoberfest(my two least favorite styles). I'll have to say it was a good brew. Not in the same context as arrogant bastard, but got the job done with dinner."
"Overall Drinkability - One of the most balanced and drinkable American Strong Ales I've had [ED: apparently wasn't an ASA]"
"This is a really good beer. Pretty sweet, but this is matched by strong hop flavor. It's also pretty easy drinking for a big beer. Ironically, a couple of typically IPA only friends, and ones who like drier ones with less malt character, got into this."
"I'd say this is probably my favorite offering from Lagunitas. Superb beer. Hop Stoopid is a close second. This is a more rounded beer, as opposed to a hop onslaught. Seek this one out."
"A nice example of an American Strong Ale."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark copper color. Nice head but retention is low because of the high ABV. Aroma is a bit hoppy, with sweet grapefruit aromas dominating. Boozy on the nose as well. Caramel honey sweetness in the aroma as well. First taste hits you with citrus grapefruit hops paired against the sweet caramel malt body. Alcohol taste on the finish. Overall good flavor with nice bold malt sweetness balancing delicate hop flavor. The alcohol isn't as hidden as I'd like. Nice full bodied sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a unique beer, an ""imperial ESB"". The taste is bold and unique. That said its just a little too much, if ABV was reduced to like 8% i could see them making a better version."
"Cheers!!"
"An ESB (according to their website) at 9.7% ABV.... this is why Lagunitas is one of my favorite breweries. Pours a light orange color, small head to it, small amount of lacing. First whiff.. all hops... ahh this is going to be a good one. Taste wise, nice mouthfeel to it... don't get hit by the hops too much which is a little surprising. Balanced very well, maybe more-so to the malt side. Hops are present, but are very much subdued, especially for the 9.7% ABV. Goes down very smooth and tastes like a 4% ABV type of beer... way too drinkable for 2X beer strength status. I would still prefer an Imperial Red or Brown Shugga but this is another home run for Lagunitas."
"Overall a very solid beer, feels lighter than the stated ABV of nearly 10%."
"O - Malt forward, big, and no pizzaz. Lagunitas is a respectable brewer and I enjoy their beers, however, this one isn't doing it for me."
"some alcohol creeps into the finish, but leaves you with some hop bitterness."
"This pours a nice dark amber color with a large foamy slightly off white head which leaves a nice lacing and has good retention. The smell is loaded with toffee, caramel, sugar and some hops. Feel is medium. The taste has more hops than the smell, so I get lots of toffee and caramel with a nice bitter after taste and a pretty decent alcohol burn (this is hotter than some of their other offerings, almost makes it not enjoyable). Overall nothing I'd get again."
"D: Delicious. Delectable. Lagunitas rarely disappoints. A great example of what a strong ale should be."
"EDITED 7/14/2012 for this year's release. So very close to last year's, it's impossible to distinguish between the two. One of my absolute favorite brews ever produced."
"Overall: good beer wish it was a year round staple, but that might just be reason it's so good and be one of my favorites from Lagunitas."
"Overall, a really good strong ale that I highly recommend. This isn't one of my normal go to styles but this one was very good. Avail here in TX. Rotation - very good but don't me see me buying many of these except the rare single. [O;O]"
"Overall: Lagunitas calls it an ""imperial mild"" and I'd say that about sums it up. It is bursting with flavours, but everything is kept in check. One of the best seasonal offerings from this great brewery."
"Poured into my 13 oz tulip. A very attractive bright amber, with a inch in and a half of white sticky head, that lingers the entire beer. Big burst of caramel up front, with some breadyness, and grapefruit. All that and more intense, on the tongue. Nice body and plenty of carbonation.Once again Lagunitas has created a wonderfully different and enjoyable brew. Not for everyone, but for fans of hearty, yet approachable beers."
"Aroma is that of mild citrus and hops. I'm thinking dry hopped with Cascade? Drinks smoothly with a good mouth feel to it. Tastes of grapefruit and hops on the backside. Higher alcohol content than most but not noticeable. A good brew that would be great on a hot Summer day."
"O. This is one of those beers that I load up on when it's available. I drink most of them over the next month or two and put a few away for ageing. Although it's filed here under the American Strong Ale category, with a tweak or two this could easily be an old/Burton ale."
"O: I aged this one for a while after picking up a 6 pack for around $10. Good price, if I recall, and the beer is solidly built. Just not spectacular. Their Lucky 13 is a better one in the category, but this one is going very well with my pizza."
"A very good beer with LOTS of hops and flavor, drinking it you know it's not a session beer but it's very drinkable. Lagunitas is a quality product and I only wish more people could try this one! Went very well with pizza."
"A sweet, darkish ale with a little bit more bitterness than expected. Not my favourite beer but not bad."
"Overall / Drinkability: Alcohol very well hidden so this beer is a bit dangerous but I definitely noticed the effects by the end of the glass. Complex flavored beer - definitely one for sipping and savoring. Definitely a strong ale with it's own unique character. Part DIPA and part spiced ale is how I would characterize this beer."
"Overall: While this one is a change of pace, some thing just is either missing or does not mesh correctly. Not sure that i can put my hand on it. It is solid but not great."
"O: Really enjoy this beer, but can see why others would not. Almost too syrupy, but I really like the aggressive flavors it has going on. I can't think of one thing that dominates, which is good for me because I like hops and malt and everything else, as long as I can really taste it. I'd buy again... which I already have multiple times."
"Cheers"
"I love Lagunitas. Poured from the stubby bottle into my Duvel tulip. Golden color and thick head dissipated rather quickly and became still. Kind of a nice looking brew though. Smell was strong. I don't even know what I was getting out of it. The alcohol wasn't very well hidden which was surprising for Lagunitas. The taste was a boozy mess for me as well. The mouthfeel was ok but once again, drinkability suffered due to the booziness. I'm sorry Lagunitas, I tried to love this but for me, just OK."
"O - Definitely the wrong choice for a summer day session beer, but very enjoyable when sipped around the campfire later on into the night. Not one I would choose to session but like the Brown Shugga, a really flavorful beer to sip on a holiday or special occasion. I'm glad I tried it but I prefer the Brown Shugga and even the Hairy Eyeball strong ales over this one."
"O: Not particularly well integrated or well balanced strong ale, likely because of the combination of hops and malt that are used."
"O - Solid brew with a wild swing from hops to malt sweet. Liked it but did not love it."
"Weird, weird, weird. Competing flavors are fighting it out in my mouth, and I don’t appreciate it."
"When it's the time for a big alcoholic beer, this is one of my favorites. Not as heavy as a barley wine, though it does have plenty of sugar. Reminds me of ginger snaps, with the molasses flavor. Clear amber with a nice head. Very rich, spicy flavor but not that thick in the mouthfeel. Lots of fruit, dried mango, bitter raisiny taste. Fair amount of hops eventually show up. Best suited for a nightcap."
"I'm glad I have five more of these beers to go through."
"D/O- I don't know if I'd go so far as to say I was blown away by this beer but whatever a notch down from that is...well, say that. Thanks for the try PTMcB!"
"Expected better, given the ratings. Served with a fine, creamy, off white head and good lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is bright citrus, hop, a little yeast. Flavor is very intense grapefruit. Too intense for me. Body is ok and carbonation is a shade light. Finish is like flavor. Not a session for me."
"O: really quite enjoyable, loved the taste and the depth, the alcohol content didnt hurt a bit either"
"Overall I freaking love this beer. I'm a fan of the citrus hops mixed with the malt but both are in balance and for a 10% ABV I could let this get away from me"
"O- Very enjoyable. I've gone through most of the sixer in the last few days and can see myself reaching for more next time I'm at the store. I really like this beer- Lagunitas makes great strong ales."
"Reddish brown pour with a nicely sized white head. The head both laces and is retained very well. The smell is hoppy, more of piney hops than grassy, with a caramel malt backbone. Those same piney hops start off the taste and is followed by the maltiness. Dry hops finish the taste off nicely. The beer is light with a good amount of carbonation and a very dry finish, devoid of any alcohol taste. Again a very drinkable choice!"
"What a complex brew that is so easy to drink, despite the high abv. Flavorful, feels nice and looks nice as well. I have a feeling I'm going to regret drinking this whole growler for two reasons: I'm not going to have anymore for tomorrow and this is going to give me one hell of a hangover. But, it's going to be worth it."
"Overall. Decent tasting and really easy to drink. Abv is well hidden and the strong point of this beer for me."
"Overall impression: pretty good, if perhaps a bit one dimensional. Tasty sipper, though."
"O- This is a good, albeit unspectacular strong ale. I'm happy to have brought one back from vacation, but don't really need another."
"O- A very delicious beer, that was much darker than I thought, but in a good way. Definitely worth a try."
"This brew pours a brilliant deep red color with a tiny head that fades quickly. The aroma is full of piney hops and sweet, nutty caramel malts. The taste is very nice, reminiscant of a very hop-forward barleywine. It's huge in all aspects, there's huge, slightly nutty caramel malts, and huge piney hops with just a bit of citrus aspect. The mouthfeel is full and coating, and the drinkability is fairly good. An enjoyable brew from Lagunitas, for sure, that straddles the line between DIPA and Barleywine."
"Rich dark brown in color and light ruby hints around the side and the bottom of the glass. Rich malty aroma, lots of caramel and hints of dee piney hops mixing in, really strong aroma here as it cuts through the air. For a beer over 9 percent it was remarkably smooth and subtle. I could have gone on drinking this one all day long, it was just that good. Huge notes of woody malts and mellow, sweet, syrup like flavor mixed with the lovely bitter piney hops"
"O: I like this. Usually I take time to contemplate the bigger beers, but this was so tasty it went down faster than it should have."
"Pours a translucent rust color with about a two-finger's breadth of foamy, bubbly, off-white head. Lots of lacing is left behind as it takes its time settling (and I drink it). Smells of citrusy hops, grapefruit, pine, caramel, and brown sugar. Tastes of alcohol, caramel malt, sugar, and citrus. The alcohol is rather overpowering in this one, and isnt masked nearly as well as I'd hoped. Mouth is warmly thinned from the alcohol and carbonation, and finishes relatively smooth. Overall, it lives up the strong ale name, but seemed a little out of balance. I'll probably reach for something else next time, but wouldn't necessarily be disappointed if I was stuck with this."
"O- Similar to a american barleywine but instead of caramel or toffee notes it has nutty notes more like a brown ale. It also has a pretty big hop presence. For almost 10% it drinks really easy and i enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Another selection that I bought one bottle of in my Make Your Own 6 Pack emporium. Will definitely pick up a few more next time"
"O - Tasty beer, however it reminds me a bit too much of some other lagunitas stuff."
"AAA+"
"O/D-I have been a bit nervous to throw out $11 to try most of Lagunitas' bigger beers. I love Little Sumpin' Sumpin', Hop Stoopid and Dogtown. I really like their IPA and Maximus. But Hairy Eyeball didn't really do it for me. I saw this as another big beer that was had to put into a specific style. But I really liked this beer. Its a beast, and one six pack will floor you with both its flavor and its ABV. Syrupy sweet but still a pretty aggressive hop attack. Lagunitas is simply one of the best breweries in the world, and they are far from overpriced. Try this."
"TGI Thursday!!!! Couple beers...why not. Trying the Lagunitas Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale...it's a mouthfull...and so is the beer! This beer can shut down evening operations quickly with its hig ABV. The appearance is good! A nice rich Amber with creamy off-white head that is lacing suburbly. The smell has a sweet malt character with hints of pine/earth. The first sip brings a wash of ABV, followed by sweet malt. The ABV numbs the tongue slightly and the sweetness holds on to the pallete. The mouthfeel was down graded just a bit due to the high ABV. Overall its a good beer...reminds me a little of the Brown Shugga that they produce(d), and the sweetness reminds me slightly of Two Brothers Cane & Ebel."
"Yes, I know that this is an American Strong Ale but I didn't think that it would be overpowering. I felt the alcohol kick in pretty quickly on this and it stuck with me for a while. Unless this style is what you prefer, a six-pack of this is probably too much. By itself, this is fine after a long night will have just enough of a kick to satisfy hopheads, and differentiate it from Barleywines and other strong styles."
"Another decent strong ale from Lagunitas, though I'm having a harder and harder time sorting out the various incarnations. This one, I thought I had it, with the Belgian-esque nose - it was not to be. Still tasty though."
"Drink- Well its okay but could better. Hype train is big on this one. Glad I got a 12 oz but would be very dissapointed in a 22 oz."
"O- very good effort from Lagunitas. I will drink and recommend this again. Easily my favorite of 5 new beers this evening."
"Despite the slight alcohol taste, this went down quite smooth. Half my glass was gone before I realized it. Very tasty."
"O - very nice brew. couldn't have too many but it was a pleasure drinking it."
"O: A well-crafted strong ale that relies a bit more on its hops and spicy alcohol qualities in the complex scheme of things. The near 10% ABV is detected, but doesn't step all over the fine, fruity nuances of the ale. Pretty well-balanced for a strong ale."
"Overall: A decent beer. The beer isn't that visually impressive but it certainly earns it label as a strong ale with an abv at around 10%."
"Overall I remember the Sneak Peek tasting a lot better – currently it seems as though the hops are too one-dimensional. Still, a tasty beer that’s worth a shot, especially for hopheads."
"O/D: It's a solid strong ale, Lagunitas always seems to do a good job...even if they kind of taste the same. Could have a couple of these tops, near 10% makes this a big beer."
"O- Pleasant beer, and easy to drink. Definitely pick it up if you haven't tried it yet."
"This is a very dangerously drinkable beer; only the heavy sweetness reminds me of its alcoholic strength. Overall, this beer reminds me of a hopped-up Brown Shugga'....very delicious and a great example of a balanced beer, expertly walking the line between sweet malt-forward ale & crisp hoppy beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a red-tinted copper coloring with a foamy, frothy, slim off-white head that settles quickly into a sparse coating of film atop the brew. The aromas are hoppy initially, with a sweet and peppery highlight to them. Further inspection gives off a slight citrus and sweet character, also. Flavors are round and forward, with a moderate wet, fresh hopping, and semisweet caramel tone, and a smokey, almost burnt/charred characteristic. The aftertaste has a grapefruit subtleness to it, with tangy caramel and bitter/drying hops throughout. The finish is a bit awkward, with the drying sensation being balanced off with a creamy and slick feel to it, all of which come crashing to a fairly quick stop at the end. Interesting brew, but a bit on the awkward side at the end, like a bad one-night stand. Sure, it was fun at first, but the ending is never pretty..."
"O: I was very impressed by this beer and really really hope that my beer turns out half as good as this one. Hats off to the people at Lagunitas Brewing Company this was one heck of a beer. I would highly recommend this beer!"
"O - If someone had described this beer to me, I'd have said it wasn't something I'd enjoy. Not so, loved this beer...they keep the sweet/hoppy balance going perfectly, and end with a very interesting beer that is easy to drink and delicious. Never too much sweetness, if you're looking for a ""different"" beer, this is one for you."
"This massive bear of a beer. Pours a brown body with some light head that exudes massive aromas of molasses, pine hops, and summer camp breakfast an open air tree grove. Flavors have more brown sugar and pancake syrup than the nose, but are sufficiently balanced balanced by the hops so that they aren't cloying. Extremely full bodied and as rich and mouth-filling as they come. If you like the flavor of such a heavy beer as much as I do, then this will be your nirvana. Otherwise it's not your cup of tea. I love brews that unabashedly choose to sink or swim. A nice brew to take your time with."
"Overall - This is middle of the road for Lagunitas (which is still a level above most attempts made by other breweries)."
"O - I would describe it as a IPA minus the hops. Very nice strong ale."
"Overall this is a great beer. One I would definitely buy again. It gives you a ton of hops without a sticky mouth or a lasting bitterness in the back of your mouth."
"O: a decent beer very close to their southern CA brothers Arrogant Bastard. My choice goes to Stone, but this is a decent runner up for a summer dark beer."
"5. It was ok I have had much better beers from Lagunitas, I probably wouldn't buy this again."
"O: Although the alcohol is well masked from the taste, this beer is definitely one that needs to be sipped given its strength and the high amount of bitterness."
"Overall: Very easy to drink strong ale has that combination of sweetnees and maltiness that I like. You need to watch how many of these you drink in a session."
"O: This is a good beer but not quite balanced enough. I mean this thing is really loaded with flavor but has a little less balance than I am used to."
"D: Decent. While I'm glad I tried it, it's not mind-blowing, and I don't think I'd go out of my way to stock up before the season is over. It's more like a dependable and solid brew from a dependable and solid company."
"Well done - again - Laghunitas. A smooth beer that begs you to sip and appreciate."
"If you like Lagunitas specialty brews you will like this. If you haven't had a strong ale this smooth you better try one."
"The mouthfeel is good with a strong bitterness that dukes it out with the sweetness of the grains. Smooth and lightly carbonated with a dry finish makes this beer a pleasurable drink with a not so noticeable ABV. A good strong beer that tastes and feels good but doesn't have huge character. It's ok but gets boring, so worth checking out but not one I'd come back to."
"D: I had this back in May and was a big fan of it being more fresh. It was close to fantastic in every aspect and I def would have scored it higher, had I taken notes. Even with as little as 2 mos on it, I am noticing signs of age. A very nice spring offering that I plan to celebrate annually."
"O- Really nice stuff. From my first scent I was expecting a hoppy sweet bomb, but it really mellowed out and presented some interesting flavors and complexity."
"Lagunitas is one of my favorite breweries, and judging this selection subjectively based on their catalog, I was a little disappointed. Very little distinguished this beer and it was definitely not worthy of its long name and ""special edition"" status. Reminded me of their ""Brown Shugga"" selection, which I'm actually very fond of, except this lacked character."
"Interesting little six pack called out to me the other day while perusing the isles of a store I don't normally shop at. Pours a deep copper color with a fluffy off white head that dissipates slowly but leaves lots of sticky lace on my glass. Lots of caramelly sweet malt aromas fly north of my glass barely tamed by the spicy pine of the hops. Taste is sweeter than I expected up front there is a ton of sweet malt mostly caramel and toffee. Taste turns earthy and pine bitter about midway through and that flavor lingers into the finish and long after each sip. Thick body, resinous and sticky sweet mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation. I enjoyed the hell out of this brew. Its a big sweet thick monster of a beer with barely enough hops to keep it from cloying, but for my taste buds it worked."
"A nice change of pace."
"Strong, muscular ale that reveals its near 10% alcohol content but stays drinkable. Primarily a strong malt profile and without the hoppy bitterness you get in some of the other strong ales (e.g Arrogant Bastard). Solid!"
"drinkability is very high, nice beer."
"A decent strong ale; it's sweet, boozy, and hoppy, but there's nothing particularly outstanding about it."
"O: This is one of my more favorable barley-wines, I like the combination of citrus, hops and malts."
"O - Another solid offering from Lagunitas. Cant beat this for $12 for a 6 pack"
"O: Glad I only got a single. My least favorite Lagunitas beer."
"A sweet, malty American strong ale with a little too much alcohol presence on the end. Not a particularly enjoyable beer, but nothing to complain about either."
"smells super hoppy. Pours darker amber light white head. This one has a huge hop flavor and some really sweet flavors too. A bit tart, but the tartness compliments it quite well. I have to say that I was drawn to this one by its name but I did really like it."
"I was really not sure what to expect with this beer and came away very impressed. This is a really well balanced strong ale with some great flavors. The fruity qualities make it very drinkable and the carbonation level makes it much more refreshing. This was recommended by a friend and I definitely second his recommendation."
"Pours the color of a tarnished penny, solid cap of off-white head, good sticky lacing. Scent is dominated by piney and grapefruity hops, not suprised since this is Lagunitas, sweet carmely malty backbone with a touch of apple. Taste follows scent, very hop forward, sweet carmely malt backbone has touches of nuts, note of apple and grape on the backent, slight nutty roast, slight booze burn to acompany bitterness. Medium bodied, palate coating and lingering bitterness. Another Lagunitas beer that showcases the hops. Cant argue too much if a majority are decent brews."
"As I figured when I picked up this single to throw in my box as I was leaving the beer store, this one's forgettable. It's neither a go-to strong nor a hopeful hop art. It is, though, yet another testament to the bad-assness that is Lagunitas Brewing Co. Never will I fear picking up some obscure beer from that place. It's still good work."
"O-pretty hoppy even for an Amercan Strong Ale. this drinks more like an IPA in my opinion. definitely a good beer though. too much citrus in my opinion though. i wouldn't mind having this again, but i won't search this out."
"O- Not too bad at all."
"Poured a clear, walnut brown, with reddish highlights, and a small white head that nonetheless laced rather well. Toasty malts and molasses on the nose. Taste was of nice toasted malts, nutty, woody, and a bitter pine sensation, with a subtle toffee flavor in there somewhere. I was kind of surprised when I looked up the ABV here, because I detected little to no alcohol bite at all. Not too out of the ordinary, but still a nice drink, and I suppose it'll get you hammered pretty fast if you're not careful, since the alcohol is masked so well. Light-medium mouthfeel, and easily drinkable, but not overly flavorful."
"Quite enjoyable. One could put this in the same family as Arrogant Bastard. A big, hoppy, red IPA. I'd take this over Arrogant Bastard any day."
"Another Lagunitas offering that I find to be a very worthy brew. Good hoppy brew with good malt balance and background of citrus and dark fruits...take your time to sip, the abv% is well hidden and will sneak up on you!"
"Overall - The alcohol was well hidden in my opinion and the taste was very well bodied. There are a lot of different flavours going on and I'm not sure I've ever had a beer that tasted quite like this one. I give it points for originality but this isn't something I'd want to drink very often."
"I had this tonight on tap at my local establishment. Appeared dark in color. The aroma was not over powering or memorable. Had a deep taste, one that I will not forget. It tasted to me like this was brewed with red apple peels. However, it did not taste like a cider beer. Overall, I was happy to try it. But there are a hundred other beers I would rather drink. Glad I tried it, but not for me necessarily."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good beer. I tried Hairy Eyeball yesterday and I felt like it needed some more hops to really be a great beer, well it seems like they answered my prayers and conjured this baby up. I find most American Strong Ales are either really malty or really hoppy, this beer fell right in the middle and I really liked that, it had great balance when it came to the flavor, neither hops or malts were overpowering and they were combined with great harmony. The alcohol was hidden really nicely and combined with great flavors made for some good drinkability, if I had another one I would drink it, it makes for a nice brew to crack open after a long hot day of yard work. I will be buying this again, in fact now that I just noticed it is a limited release I will be getting a six pack next time I go to the store. If your looking for an American Strong ale that has some great flavors and balance to it this is the beer for you. Great job with this brew Lagunitas, you guys really know what your doing, now I have to see what other beers I can track down from you guys."
"O – Balanced sweet and boozy. Almost barleywine-like."
"One fine ale. I paired this with a mildly spicey chicken enchilada and it was near perfect. This beer looks and tastes great, one I will certainly be looking out for next spring."
"O - This hop-forward beer is quite enjoyable. It hides its high ABV nicely. This is definitely a good value, and I will revisit it in the future."
"Overall a very nice double IPA to be enjoyed on a nice summer evening."
"O: This is an interesting one...a hop-forward strong ale. The balance of the hop profile with the sweetness is nice. It hides the high ABV well."
"D/O: One of Lagunitas's seasonal strong ales, this spring release puts an increased emphasis on hops but still cannot move beyond malt, booze, and simplicity. It is slightly punishing on the palate, leaving it scorched from the combined effects of carbonic acid and ethanol. Hay and husky malt will reward the drinker that favors such qualities, but otherwise this is just a lot of unnecessary abv."
"O- This beer had turned out to be one that seemed a lot different that what I thought it was going to be. I really liked the flavors overall even with the light off flavor in the ending. ABV was high though which limits this beer."
"O (D) - This is somewhat interesting, It's ok. Nothing spectacular, but it's hoppy, and thats worth something."
"O - Overall its a good strong ale, close to an arrogant bastard but not as hopped up/bitter, has a taste of its own... great brew!"
"Poured out a brownish amber, a little on the red side. Barely any head formed and just left a couple puddles sitting on top. The nose is a lot of sweet and tangy malts with some darker notes. A lot of brown sugar and that Lagunitas hop character. A lot of citrus and some earthy tones. That hop character is right up front in the taste. Resinous tones along with some darker fruits from the malt and hop combination. The malt body shows through with a bready and dark malt characters. Cherry and a metallic twang. Finishes with a resinous pine flavor that lacks a big bitter kick."
"Drinkability: Hell yeah! This is truly an All-American Strong Ale. Big hops and malts, big ABV, big hops aromas. Due to the high ABV and strong flavors, one or two of these go a long way...but could easily do a session as this one tastes better the more you drink. Just leave the driving to someone else."
"O - Nice strong ale, reminding me of a sweet double IPA."
"I like it"
"O - A good beer overall. I probably won't get this again because there are many other beers I'd like to try and better ones that I've had. Had one of these while playing Call of Duty: Black Ops...fitting, but really started to mess with my gameplay once I was through with it. Only recommend one of these in a sitting due to its sweetness, heavy character, and high abv."
"O: This is tasty and strong, yet pretty easy to drink."
"Definitely one of the better strong ales around. Worth a try."
"I've reviewed this beer in the bottle before, and didn't plan on reviewing it again. However, I'm so in love with it, and the hop balance (freshness dependent) is so helpful to the overall flavor, that I figured I'd throw up this tap review. This is a beer that I want to always have on hand."
"O: Overall, this is an unusual and super funky tasting Strong Ale. It sort of reminds me of their wet hop ale and Arrogant Bastard a bit as well ( not as good as Arrogant Bastard). I can't say I LOVE it (like most Lagunitas offerings), But I LIKE it and its well done and totally unusual and interesting tasting. Tastes a bit like a more funky Maximus. This won't be an everyday beer ( it's limited anyways) but I am glad to try it and look forward to finishing the 6er! This is an adventurous strong ale and you should check it out if you like pungent funky strong ales."
"D a good beer, but would be difficult to follow with another. 3.5 "
"D- i regret passing up this beer as many times as i have. lagunitas is once again able to pull off a well hopped beer. this beer gave me a buzz after just one, so i dont think that having a couple would be a good idea. it is something i will continue to buy until my store runs out. check this one out if you havnt already."
"Overall - This will definitely put you on your ass after a few of them and it is pretty easy to do so. The hops are nice and I like the fruitiness to the brew as well. Tread carefully, though!"
" Off-puttingly sweet and cloying."
"D - A sipper. You can't chug these by any means. Drink a 6 of these and you'll be as drunk as anyone at the party. Better as a slow sipper and could probably be sold in 4-packs with minimal complaint. This is a very solid beer, overall, better than Arrogant Bastard. It'd be a boon for Lagunitas to use west coast IPA hops, though. That'd make this beer an elite. Taste too much like an Atlantic coast DIPA."
"Overall a very solid brew, if a little one-note; very enjoyable but not super complex. Definitely a sipper, the alcohol is quite noticeable (and I rarely say that)."
"Cheers!"
"The color is a deep amber copper with thin white head that fades fast but leaves nice lace. The smell is like a new car. Polished leather, and mild soapy aromas mixed with floral and pine notes. Some citrus, orange and bitter grapefruit mixed in. The taste, unfortunately follows the taste with soapy leather and pine, but has strong caramel and butterscotch balancing it out. Perfume like essense with notes of brown sugar and citrus. Interesting balance with the hops leading the way. Overall, a little difficult to finish."
"O: It says Limited Release and that's to bad, I could make this an everyday addition to my fridge - Has a great hop profile that is well balanced with malts and yeast, Tasty beer that goes down easy and packs a little punch."
"Definitely go look for one of these, if you can find one."
"On tap at local Flying Saucer Emporium. Pours dark amber red. Little to no head with tan color. Lacing on glass very pronounced. Taste is malty and sweet with an alcohol warmth on the back end. Aroma is pine and grapefruit. Delicious DIPA will definitely try again."
"Overall, very solid brew and I'd be happy to have a bottle of this everyday"
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is very nice beer to drink for a long time."
"Overall - This beer goes down pretty easy for nearly 10% ABV. Very solid strong ale/DIPA"
"This is a nice sipping ale. Everything works together, but there's something I can't put my finger on that keeps it from being really drinkable, which is a good thing given it's 9.79% abv. Would be a good once-in-a-while beer, but not a usual suspect."
"Mouth was soft on the lip, smooth on the drink. Not a hoppy sting but very easy to handle. At 9%plus, can be abit too easy, oh ya!"
"Overall: Very good. Surprisingly mild for a double. Then again, the lack of a date means the hops might have aged out somewhat. I really wish Lagunitas dated their bottles."
"overall this beer comes as a very pleasant surprise. i was expecting a relatively enjoyable, B-range beer. what i got instead was A-worthy."
"This was a consolation prize to myself after a long voyage to an establishment where the thing i was looking for just kicked. Very pleasant surprise for something I'd never heard about."
"Ah, it feels good to get the first review under my belt :)"
"This is another winner. Love the combination of flavors, but it is still big hop beer. Very worthy."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O-Never would of guessed this was 9.7 abv. This was a really solid brew and I'll definitely buy another sixer before it's gone"
"Lagunitas seems to get it right all the time... kudos to the california brewery"
"I think this one could stand to age a bit to help wash out the hot alcohol and sharp bitterness. There is a nice underlying flavor, but it is hardly the dominant one. For as good as this beer smells, I was hoping for a little more balance. Still, that being said, this is a nice sipping beer, and I'm glad I have 5 more in my fridge."
"O - Meh. Had much better from Lagunitas. At least this doesn't come across too hot. Barely taste any big alcohol taste despite the high ABV. May try it again, but I'd much rather give it another try on tap."
"On tap. Pours a dark ruby color with a thin layer of head. Some lacing. Aroma is hoppy, and sweet. Some grains as well as some booze. Taste is of dark fruits, booze, sweetness, and a bit of hops. Certainly can taste the 9+ abv but its not too rough. Pretty easy to drink considering. It does have that typical Lagunitas hop profile but its not as hoppy. Overall, I like it and would have it again."
"Sampled from a bottle with a March 2011 ""bottled on"" date. Deep copper with excellent clarity. Poured with very little foam, no head retention, and leaves a white ring of foam around the glass. Sweet, sugary caramel combine with intense grapefruit and orange hop aromas. On the thinner side of medium bodied with light carbonationa and an oily hop feel. Flavors are a nice balance of sweet caramel malt and intense citrus and floral hops. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat and a lingering bitter, floral hop aftertaste. Definitely a sipper. Lots of intense aroma and flavor if that's what your looking for."
"Overall: This is a relatively bland outing by Lagunita's. I expected something much more exciting but this is a malt bomb that is too strong to appreciate much of. I'll pass on this one next time."
"Overall, awesome West Coast spin on a brown ale. Gotta thank good ol' reefer for making this one possible."
"O: Not a bad beer, but I feel like this beer is almost identical to several other Lagunitas beers. Nothing makes it really stand out from the crowd. It's a good bargain, at least."
"The ale pours brilliantly clear copper color with moderate, sticky white head. The aroma is highly hoppy--spicy, citrus and pine; beneath the hops is a bit of earthy, nutty malt. The flavor is moderate-highly hoppy--citrus and pine, with moderate-high hop bitterness. The hop load is balanced out--at least partially, by a smooth, biscuity sweet malt and a belly warming presence of alcohol. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and silky with medium-full body. Overall this is a well-made, flavorful brew that is a bit different--pleasantly so. Pick it up!"
"O- hard to pinpoint why, but this beer is really hearty & satisfying. Unbelievably drinkable for almost 10% abv"
"This is the perfect anti-session beer; a couple of these quick and you'll be off your feet."
"Overall, this beer is pretty good. A little too sweet for me."
"Pours out a reddish brown body with a thick white head that has really good retention, and great lacing on my beer mug. Carbonation seems to be moderate. The aroma of this beer when first cracking the bottle open and pouring it I could smell some fruits, brown sugar, molasses, and pine. The taste starts out with some brown sugar followed by a spicy peppery taste, than some pine and citrus hops kick in with some sweet fruits in the back. The aftertaste is the bitterness from the hops that stays until the next sip, but the sweetness of the fruit is also still there. Mouthfeel starts out with a smooth feel that ends up with some bite and a dry feel to it. Overall, a very good tasting beer that has a unique taste that is nice when feeling like something different than the norm, and the alcohol will make you feel warm while enjoying this brew. This is a must try beer."
"O/D - This one is really good. It's not much to look at but it makes up for it in the other categories. If they ever make beer air fresheners this would be one to emulate. The drinkability is high from a taste standpoint, but the abv keeps you in check. I will definitely be buying this again."
"Another very good brew from Lagunitas - a very drinkable brew in spite of the abv. Well worth a try."
"Lagunitas has come up with yet another unique, drinkable, affordable brew. I wish they would go public so i could buy their stock."
"O - A good cinco de mayo beer, because a couple of these would have you sideways. Smells like an IPA, tastes like a red. This, what ever it is, is a very different beer. Once again, Lagunitas never ceases to amaze me, with quiality, and price!"
"I think this is a pretty damn good beer, and dangerously drinkable. The malt and hop aromas and flavors are excellent, and the high alcohol content blends seamlessly into the background. Well done Lagunitas."
"O - what else can I say about this brewery, they never disappoint, another tasty treat that gives a quick kick of hops that gives way to a sweet malty base, the alcohol is well hidden on the taste but gives a warming kick on the feel, well done"
"O - There's no way I'd ever guess this was 9.7%, the flavours are superb, with the only minor drawback being the mouthfeel (which is more of a personal preference than anything). A solid brew and I could totally take down a 6-er of this..."
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, tingly and sticky on the tongue. Pretty decent flavor, although the alcohol feels a little over the top, as well as the syrupy sweetness."
"Pours a deep amber with an off-white one finger head. Dissipates pretty quickly. Light maltiness with some floral hops for the nose. The taste was surprising. I was immediately hit with a wave of sweetness that caught me off guard. This was mellowed by the malts and then destroyed by a pretty bitter hop finish. I really enjoyed this brew. It is remniscent of scotch ale, with a much larger hop character."
"Good beer, nothing too out of hand though. Reminds me of a scotch ale that had hops added in. Not bad."
"Ending notes: This limited release brew from Lagunitas was a gem. Definitely worth trying. Kicks like a bronco. Very interesting. It lived up to my expectations. Another splendid brew, Lagunitas!"
"T: This definitely doesn't taste like it's 10%. Pretty big floral hops with some citrus hops in there as well. There's some overripe mango sweetness on a finish that's otherwise hard and bitter. Not bad, but probably not one I'd seek out again in the near future."
"Overall, I'm impressed. I'd have it again. The $$ is right on for this as a sixer. Not that I'd really want to drink all 6 in the same night. Prosit!"
"This is a curious one, it's nearly 10% abv but has the flavour profile of a low intensity American Pale Ale which makes it incredibly drinkable, yet a bit of a let down at the same time."
"M- There is a tingling all around the mouth and tongue. Goes down smooth but seems to have some high carbonation levels when drinking. I didn't notice any in the appearance but the taste seems to bering that."
"O. Lagunitas usually delivers the goods in terms of drinkability and this beer doesn't fail. I find many Strong Ales to be slow sippers with intrusive alcohol but Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale really disappears quickly. Highly enjoyable."
"Overall: Great, nicely balanced Strong Ale. This has the typical Lagunitas hop taste, but it is well integrated into the rich malt profile and somehow the bitterness is restrained. Lagunitas calls this an Imperial Mild - not sure if that is a joke or not, but it makes a twisted sort of sense."
"Good carbonation with medium body, alcohol is hidden but not buried, and the finish is fairly crisp and dry. For its size and flavor profile, this is an easy-drinking brew. Give it a shot."
"Man, I had this last year around Mother's Day and my brother-in-law and I took down a six(among other beers) that weekend. We both dug the piss out of this one. I saw it on the shelf today and was psyched. So here goes: it looks coppery, with a decent, foamy head. The smell is of hops and malts (I guess, that's my go-to when I'm not sure what I smell). The taste is strong, hoppy, and has that bitter goodness that I can't quite describe but really dig. Is this a cross between a barleywine and a DIPA? Strong Ale is very vague... This is a strong beer and it's one of my favorites from Lagunitas. Good, good, good."
"M: Medium body and light carbonation."
"O: Delicious. I've been waiting all year for this seasonal. You can hardly taste the 10% ABV which makes this beer surprisingly drinkable. (EDIT: As the beer gets warmer, the taste of alcohol becomes much more noticeable) Strong on the hops yet relatively balanced."
"d - very sweet for a dipa. hops were lacking balls."
"Overall/Drinkability: A little too sweet for my liking, but goes nicely with the Belgian yeast note (whether or not Belgian yeast is actually used - I'm not certain)."
"This is a fine American Strong Ale with some extra hops courtesy of Lagunitas' tradition!"
"What else do you call something that blends more decadently sweet, nuanced maltiness than an old ale and as much brimming, zestful hoppiness as a double IPA? The result of which, I might add, has such a distinctive, often unparalleled character, the quantity and quality of which American brewers conceived, consummated and continue to cultivate virtually uncontested? Yea, beers like this require a title of their own. A.S.A. fits."
"Overall, this beer is great. Initially I didn't realize the style of beer that I was drinking and sort of picked this bottle off the shelf at random. This is a nice strong ale and definitely has the flavor complexity that you find in this style of beer. Although it isn't a Stone brew, it definitely holds its own in comparison. This is a great offering from Lagunitas."
"D: I could easily drink a few more."
"D - I think the drinkability of this beer is good. It goes down easy, and I could easily put down a few of these in a row. This is a good beer, and I'd drink it again."
"Pours an ugly dark red topped by a thin white head. Smells of sweet malts and dark fruits. Surprisingly pine/citrus hops present in the nose. Once I sip I notice the earthy hops, more sweet malt, more plum/fig. This beer has a medium body and low carbonation but is still a tasty strong ale. Maybe its just me but the alcohol was well hidden. Not bad at all."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent burnt toffee scent that boasts of caramelized pale malts and some caramel malts. The hop aroma is good as well. It has an intense piney bitterness that's works well with the malts. The taste is good also. It has a smooth burnt toffee flavor that goes down slow and bitter and finishes with a bit of alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good drinking strong ale. It has excellent hop character and a malt bill that rivals any old ale or barleywine."
"D - Man I can't wait till this hits my shelf's again! A very smooth strong ale that drinks great and succession's perfectly."
"Notes: Nice warming feeling from the alcohol."
"Pretty drinkable for 9.7%. Tasty, brutally bitter. Have one of these left aging."
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. The texture is smooth and fairly creamy. The finish is much dryer than what I expected. While the sweetness certainly lingers, it does not dig in too deep. Though the eventual buzz would stop me from drinking too many, this is certainly which could easily sneak up on you. Very good beer."
"High drinkability as this beer is very complex, tasty and easy to drink, but the danger is that 9.75% ABV so look out. Strong recommendation to try this beer."
"D- Inves-shut down is a big beer that delivers on some flavor. I like this brew, the tough part is the alcohol level is astronomical. Sip this bad boy"
"Hopheads will dig this brew, but I could use a bit more balance. It manages the 9.75 % alcohol well, making it one of the more drinkable strong ales out there."
"Mouthfeel could be a bit less sticky, but the carb is awesome. It just comes off a touch dirty and sticky. Finishes with sweetness and noticeable booze. Overall, this was good. I consider it more of an imperial red ale/amber or an old American Strong. I would drink it again, for a big beer it's above average in it's refreshing nature. A good beer from Lagunitas."
"Another one that I could have more of if the ABV wasn't so high."
"Bottle. Pours a deep copper color with a nice looking 1 finger white head. Nice hops aroma coming from this. The nose is a mix of sweet malt and citrus with some floral aromas. Medium smooth mouthfeel. Whoa, hotdog, this beer is sweet up front! The hops kick in big time in the end followed by the alcohol bite. A sipper but this is a pretty good beer. Not sure if I would be able to drink a whole lot of this due to the sweetness."
"D: awsome, six pack, 3 one night and 3 the next. for 12 bucks."
"D - Decent beer but I don't think I would pick this up again. I will be honest I am starting to see why some people think a lot of Lagunitas brews taste the same."
"D - Drinkable for a 9+% strong ale. I don't know that I'd pound down a sixer in a session, but it's a real nice sipper! It's a seasonal, so I'll probably get it again next year. Another solid Lagunitas brew!"
"Overall, a solid beer from a brewery that I don't often frequent on a highly competitive menu of beers in NYC."
"Overall - Again, worth the cost and would order it on draft to compare, but nothing too exciting."
"A highly drinkable and enjoyable lightly hoppy strong ale that goes great with food. When its in season I always get a six pack or 2 to try with different food pairings or to just have on a hot day."
"Drinkability was decent considering the abv. Slightly sticky with a mild sign of booze."
"D: OK"
"A beer with an actual story, now that's something I like. I liked the beer itself as well. While I do did my strong ale's with more malt, this was still pretty decent. Even though the hops seem to be in the forefront, I thought the lightly smoked malt taste was a nice addition, coupled with a slight taste of grapes. The smell is mostly with hops in the limelight, maybe a little citrus and grapes as well. All in a good brew by Lagunitas, which has never disappointed me before. Probably one of the more consistent breweries I've tasted from."
"overall it is a good beer and will definitively will look for this again."
"this a big bootiful beer. a deep reddish brown, super malty, caramel, alcohol, citrus hop bomb. maltier sweetness overshadows the hops, which themselves are pretty strong. full bodied, sticky and coating, very satisfying. it's a sipper for sure, one and im good and ready for something else."
"d - I thought this was a really nice beer that was more like a barlewine to me. It's held up really well and I would love to try again."
"Felt like I was really close to nailing this beer! Also really enjoyed drinking it."
"A nice bright light copper pour with a lasting frothy two finger head,leaving some lacing. Aroma of pine,hop resin,grapefruit,and lemon hints. Flavor is well balanced for the amount of hops,nice caramel and toasted grain sweetness but not overpowering spicy,and citrus hops ,alcohol is well hidden,medium to full body with a full,slightly sticky mouthfeel, a nice crisp hoppy aftertaste. I am going back to get more of this tomorrow. Nice !"
"On cask at Kickbacks Gastropub in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Poured vigorously with little head, very little lacing but resinous hop juiciness is clearly noted sliding all over the glass. Aroma is of some malt sweetness, some alcohol and a ton of goddamned hop goodness. Taste is a touch hot (this cask is quite young and fresh, where the increased heat is balanced out by increased hop freshness). Taste of sweet, caramel malts and all kinds of hop flavors stylin and profilin'. As good as the bottled/kegged version but as usual, just a little something extra on the cask pour. Over the top Lagunitas liquid awesomeness...."
"D: easy to drink flavors are balanced. somewhat reminds me of a sweeter east-coast IPA"
"Pours a dark brown, almost reddish clear color with a medium sized white head that goes away quickly. Smell is VERY hoppy with tons of sweetness. A lot of sweet malts and molasses coming through. Maybe even a bit of dark fruit. Smells a lot like a rich imperial IPA though...maybe even borderline American barleywine. The taste is initially sweet sugars (molasses w/dark fruits), followed by hoppy bitterness and some alcohol booziness (once it warms up a bit). The taste is almost exactly as it smells, which is impressive. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, but not a turn off at all. Very full-bodied and delicious. Drinkability is fairly high, and I cannot believe this beer comes in a six pack with such an amazing price (9.99). Lagunitas always has great prices. This is listed as an American Strong Ale, but I would say this could easily pass for an IIPA/Barleywine. Solid brew."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: The style of this beer is a combination of old ale and English barleywine. The flatness of the carbonation makes it a sweet and sticky beer, but with a noticeably bitter finish. So, your palate and stomach have to be in the mood for the simultaneous taste extremes, which do a very good job of masking the 9.75% alcohol content. Stylistically, this is the kind of beer that I can only handle for one or two rounds at the most, before the concentrated flavor profile gets to be too much."
"Overall, I was surprised that this brew was a well balanced as it is, due to all the big flavors and aromas. A very nice brew that I'll be going back for in the near future."
"Alcohol is present but not overpowering. The sweetness of this one can be a little much, but the lingering bitterness on the finish helps to balance this sipper."
"D: Hop forward, but single note. I don't think there is enough balance for me. I feel like there should be a second act, but this beer left at intermission."
"A very strong entry that drinks more like a delicious American barleywine or some sort of strong ale. It certainly doesn't have the in your face hopping you'd expect from an imperial IPA, but thankfully it replaces it with a luscious complexity. Nice stuff. Thanks Shawn!"
"Style above reads American Strong Ale, the good people at Lagunitas claim Imperial Mild (whatever that is); all I know is this is a very solid brew. A dense head floats on a deep amber body with great clarity. The nose loses some points for a having a bit too much booze coming through. Aside from the alcohol, hops leave a nice pine quality, which lingers beneath a nice dense malt character. As the beer reaches room temp, the booze is pretty prominent. Lots of doughy malt comes through on the back of the palate. The pine from the nose comes through on the back of the palate with some nice bitterness up front. Slight raisin and plum come through in the mid palate but very faintly. Mouthfeel on this beast really makes it for me: despite the big flavors, the body is relatively clean with a very dry finish (almost akin to what you'd expect from rye beer). The booze on the nose is the only detractor here for drinkability. Lots of great flavor components without the thick, dense body (perhaps a detractor if it were february, but in the summer this is a great big beer)."
"Dark brown color, good carbonation, very good aroma (malty and hoppy). ABV is high but the flavor is well balanced."
"It Is decent abv, so maybe just a one off for the evening...."
"later"
"D: This nearly 10% ABV beer hides its alcohol well. I am going to try and score more of this at World Market."
"Drinkability- dangerously drinkable considering just how strong this beer is, i have to say absolutely loved alot about this beer, its was able to walk that thin line where it was both neither to hoppy or to malty but having a very satisfactory level of both, a very very solid example of what a strong ale should be having firm hop but not killing all else in the flavor profile, a beer i certainly would recommend and get again, but shhhh... dont tell to many people keep it undercover"
"I'm visiting Boise, Idaho for six months. Before going home to Kansas I hope to find a supply of Undercover somewhere so that I can share it with my buddies in Kansas. Sorry for the absence of tech talk in this review; all I know is that this is a very fine beer that greatly appealed to me. At the restaurant where my son and I enjoyed this beer, as (bad) luck would have it we were served the last two glasses they had before the keg ran out. Broke our hearts. I hope the restaurant reloads soon."
"D - This is pretty decent, nothing spectacular or bad about it. It is definitely sweet and heavy."
"D-Another brew with silly drinkability considering it's ABV.I am a huge fan of this beer and could see myself pushing the boundaries with this one."
"There's an initial balance that fades away. Had it stuck around, this would be a solid entry in the margins between DIPA/Barleywine territory. As is, it waves the white flag too early, and flounders the rest of way without any hop or malt signposts for guidance."
"very drinkable for a 10% strong ale, so many are overly hopped or overly sticky sweet, this is perrty solid!"
"Future outlook: Very nice beer obtained at a very modest price. Might have to snag a few of these to stow away."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, alcohol well hidden. That said, not a standout."
"D: Absolutely charming, and with an abv to be proud of"
"Already looking forward to drinking more of this one..."
"Notes: Another nice one from Lagunitas, they also do other good stuff but they seem to be shine the strongest when working on hoppy brews and this one is actually there. Lacks a notch to make it to their best offerings but it is close."
"Poured into a Great Divide glass a transparent amber-brown with a thick froathy white head. Great head retention as it's not disappearing and great lacing. The scent is strong with carmel sweetness and some floral hops mixed in. The taste is much like a weak barley wine. There is strong carmel malts with brown sugar flavors and a nice amount of hoppy bitterness in the after taste."
"Notes: There is so much going on with this beer, it reminds me in that way to Arrogant Bastard. Upon further sips and contemplation, the closest beer that comes to mind is again Lagunitas' Hairy Eyeball. I think that it is a slightly hoppier version of H.E."
"D: Good now and really good next year after siome cellar time"
"D - Well this is about as drinkable as you can get for a beer thats almost 10% good enjoyable taste that comes at a great price worth getting to try sometime"
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear dark gold with a finger of off white head. Piney hop aroma with plenty of caramel malt. Medium to full bodied. Lots of malt upfront with a fair amount of sweetness. There are plenty of hops to balance out the malt. Nice drying finish from the hops. Lagunitas brews a lot of strong malty, hoppy beers, and this one is pretty tasty."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a deep ruby brown color. Aroma is primarily of malts with caramel and some roasted malts, bitterness of pine sneaks through at the end. Taste is very similar to the smell with more roasted malt flavor, and more piney hops. Feel is slightly on the crisp side with a good bite, and some slight warming from the alcohol. Overall a very drinkable strong ale, and definitely one I'll have again given the opportunity."
"MF is full, chewy, oily, and warming in the end. This is a highly complex beer and should be enjoyed by all BAs!"
"I bought this bottle on a whim. Beer pours a clean amber with some head that recedes into a ring of white bubbles. I smelled booze and malt from the glass. The boozy smell is strong yet not off putting. A smooth American strong ale yet still tastes best in small drinks or sips. Boozy front end on this beer followed by citrus like hop flavors some sweet malt notes with a boozy aftertaste. Undercover Shutdown is a powerful ale. I think the boozy notes are a good element of the beer that lets the drinker know that this beer is no joke yet still pleasing to the palette."
"refreshing and interesting."
"Medium-full body, coating, and having a slight chew. Carbonation seems high in this sample, and is a little biting. Balance seems ok, strong flavor elements from both sides but neither really takes over. Overall a decent strong ale, but could be better if the carbonation was leveled off some. Certainly would try again."
"Drinkability: this is a worryingly drinkable beer. It's going down *way* more easily than a beer of this strength has any right to do. I would absolutely drink this again (and again, and again)."
"d - nice sipper that really mellows towards the finish."
"Extremely drinkable for almost 10% ABV, but that also comes with a sweet/malty taste that gets old after about half a beer. I feel like it would be good with more hops, but the Lagunitas sweetness is there for sure. Not really my style but a decent way to get a buzz."
"D - rating this on my first and going to enjoy another; recommend trying this one for sure"
"D: A fairly easy drinker. I really like their stuff and the price simply cannot be beat. I need to cellar a few of their bigger beers again."
"Poured into two goblets so I could split it with my lovely wife...Appearance was caramelly copper; kind of like Dr.Pepper. Fairly effervescent with a thin foamy white head. Smell was of pine and brown sugar, with a slight yeastiness. Flavor was a bit sweet, malty and hoppy. Not as bitter as expected from the description on the label."
"D: Another winner from Lagunitas -- highly drinkable but with power in all the right places. Undercover Shutdown Ale (along with Hairy Eyeball, Brown Shugga, and Maximus (balanced DIPA)) shows that hops is not the only thing they can do well."
"D: Another strong beer that doesn't feel so strong. It does a good job lying to your body that there really isn't that much abv here."
"May be better in the long run with a bit of age on it. Otherwise, another good offering from Lagunitas."
"Pours a lovely, slightly hazy golden with a delicate head. The aroma is fruity and hoppy, quite strong, like an herby candy. Flavor is spicy and super hoppy, with citrus and pine and a musky rosemary-like herbyness. There is a sharp stinging bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is super prickly. This is like sticking your face in a sack of West Coast hops."
"I like what Lagunitas cooks up. This didn't disappoint. Brewed in memory of their shut down, and released in Spring, it is a pretty solid Bay Area beer. The cool nights we get make a ""winter warmer"" like this a welcome addition to the fridge, even in warm weather months like June."
"D-Goes down pretty smooth indeed. I highly recommend this one."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color, with a small off white head. In the aroma, a mellow grapefruity hop. In the taste, grapefruity hops and a smooth maltiness. A smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, grapefruity hop aftertaste. Nice big hops, and bit malty, and hides the ABV well. I can dig it!"
"O - A solid offering from Lagunitas. This would be good as a winter seasonal, not sure why it gets released in spring."
"pours a transparent copper color with good white head, good lacing, and average carbonation. floral piney hop smell, much the same in the taste with some fruity grapefruit hints. sweet bitter finish, and long flavor duration. medium bodied with a thin slick texture. absolutely fantastic beer."
"I'd recommend picking one of this up if possible, very good beer."
"D- well hidden abv and easy enough to drink. I like it."
"D: For the style and ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. I take them on bike rides to sip and enjoy during a ride. Easy going, does not leave you with a heavy and full feeling."
"On-tap at Raleigh Times served in a 10oz glass and reviewed from notes. Served a crisp dark amber with a thin off-white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma was a nice blend of citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a nice amount of citrus hops with a good amount of sweet malts backing them up nicely. The beer is slightly heavy, but has a nice bitter dryness that smooths things out nicely. This is another great Double IPA from Lagunitas, one I will always get my share of when it's available."
"drink: is good, but wouldnt slam to many at this abv."
"Overall, a decent but unspectacular beer. Worth trying."
"Pours a nice copper brown orange color with some decent off-white head that laces pretty well. Smell is deeply floral and citrusy, though there was a hint of soapiness in there too that wasn't so good--if not for that, it was a really great aroma. Taste is a bit bigger on the malts, though the hops stuck around for a nice barleywine-type flavor profile. Big caramel and syrupy malts with some big pine and citrus hops to go along. Medium mouthfeel, coats ok, not particularly dry. It could potentially use a bit more carbonation. Good drinkability, dangerously so at almost 10% ABV."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied. Ample carbonation without being too carbonated. As the beer rests a while the feel becomes more and more creamy. Very easy drinking beer given the high ABV. Possibly the first Lagunitas beer that I have felt was truly remarkable (I still cant make up my mind on Hop Stoopid)."
"Taste is bitter and hoppy at first - a very strong pale ale for certain. Evolves into citrus bte, and then a smooth caramel finish - giving it a bit of sweetness. A diverse range of flavors, but I cant get past the initial bit. Body in light, and lingers in the mouth. High abv is fairly noticeable."
"I really enjoyed drinking this beer and thought it was a fine DPA"
"Despite the high alcohol content, this beer is sort of on the light side, as far as flavor and mouthfeel are concerned. I'd also prefer if it were more balanced; i.e. a bit less sweetness. That said, it is still an enjoyable strong ale, but I think next time I'd get their Hairy Eyeball over this."
"D: The alcohol is hidden quite well. This is my second of the six and despite the chewiness of the beer, it is quite drinkable. I will have another and then call it quits."
"I think this could be one of my new seasonal favorites. Make more, please!"
"The hop, alcohol, and sweet malt lingering aftertaste on this really sticks in the mouth, pretty darn good but not great."
"Pours a brown tinted orange with amber edges and a two finger cream colored head that fades to a rim hugger with clumps of lace here and there. Smell: big resinous and pineapple hops with a little lemon zest thrown in. It's also bringing a big dose of brown sugar. Taste: pineapple and some pine/spruce, brown sugar, date bread, and a subdued citrus rind hit in the finish. This is pretty damn hoppy but incredibly well balanced. It's also obnoxiously sessionable for 9.75%, though that would be a bad idea. It's not as extreme as an AB (though in the same vein of ASAs), but that makes it more often enjoyable."
"This is one of the better beers I've tried from Lagunitas and worth having again. The alcohol warmth is there but not overly so, and it makes for a pretty easy drinking brew."
"REALLY drinkable beer here. Lagunitas isn't known for making bad beers and this one is no exception. This drinks like a mild pale ale, and kicks like a sledgehammer. There is absolutely no hint of haw strong this beer is from the taste."
"Extremely drinkable, I look forward to having this one again, and sharing it with like minded beer drinkers."
"This is one damn FINE beer!"
"D: This is just straight up good beer. Lagunitas' red ales are something else, I love 'em."
"Pours a dark copper hue with a rolling cream white head that starts out pretty hefty but then slowly mellows out. Nice alcohol and hop aromas cut through the head. Doesn't smell hot, but definitely a good combo. I'm drinking this one a little warm, I usually like stronger ales warm. The texture is medium bodied. The alcohol leaves a nice feeling on the edges of my tongue. Classic Lagunitas hop characteristics, very earthy and dry flavors seem to disagree just a little with the malt notes. I like this beer, I would drink it again. I think this beer would be awesome served from a cask. Aside from Hop Stoopid I've never been a huge fan of what Lagunitas does with their hops, it's never bad, just something about it. However, this beer does a good job of not making things too sweet or too hoppy."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful deep amber with off-white head that is enormous and pillowy soft. Nose has a big caramel & malt aroma with some cherry notes. Cherry is on the palate as well, with a big sweet syrupy malt character with hops near the finish to round it out somewhat. Comes across as barleywine-like to me, but just not quite as hoppy."
"D - And the beer is not so thick and rich as to keep this from being pretty drinkable. It has a definite warming effect like a trippel but with more hops. A very nice brew."
"Alcohol is very well hidden. It kinda reminds me of an imperial amber (Nugget Nectar comes to mind). Very nice."
"Another solid ale from Lagunitas."
"D - This is a pretty good ale. It brings a great maltiness and booziness with just enough hop bitterness. Almost like an English Barleywine."
"The beer pours and orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is caramel, pine and alcohol. The flavor is more of the same with the pine and caramel malts being fairly well balanced. The alcohol is very present. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Moderate aggression gets you a finger of eggshell white form, fairly dense and frothy, what's there possesses decent retention, multiple patches of lacing scattered across the glass insides. Clear bronzed orange color, red rust tinge, loose, widely spread bubble beads. The nose is locked and loaded to please, juicy pink grapefruit, tangerine and lime citrus, honey, fully ripened peach, apricot, nectarine, pineapple scents, mere brush of caramel, light sweet spiciness, under it all an herbaceous earthiness and mutter of charcoal ash. Full-bodied, that earthiness and tar adds some needed rigidity, the carbonation helps as well by tightening up its game and percolating without fluffiness. At the same time, doesn't lose any of that sweetly ripened pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus nor bountiful peach, apricot, nectarine, pineapple, mango flavors. Here more cocoa and mocha than caramel, drier and powdery. Not suave per se, but manages to work the room completely and then exeunt without anyone noticing but everyone wants to say goodnight before leaving themselves. Having a six-pack on hand is a dangerous thing."
"- Way too drinkable for being such a big beer. Two will put you right past buzzed easily. I look forward to next years release."
"Comes out of the tap a dark translucent golden amber with a thick, pale tan, fine-bubbled head that persists. Strong aroma is surprisingly hoppy with an evergreen undertone and just a hint of apple. Lively flavor is hoppy, slightly malty, slightly fruity and just a teeny bit bitter. Strongly fizzy texture leaves behind a pleasant tingle."
"Drinkability- I thought it was really good. I need more. I should try to find some more."
"Tried this at my new favorite dive, Racer's in Baltimore. I've come to realize that trying something from Lagunitas is pretty much a sure bet. This one was no exception. Nice amber color, hoppy pine in smell and taste. Some grapefruit comes through too. The malt/dark fruit is there too but more toward the end. I would not drink more than one in a setting, due to the alcohol content but I'll be looking forward to trying another one of these soon."
"//D: Very good drinkability. For the high ABV this was delicious."
"This is a big beer. Complexity & dryness are slowing me down a bit, but a super-solid offering to be sure. I am enjoying this in my cool air conditioned basement, bet it's better by a roaring fire in the dead of winter,,,"
"Would say, ""you should definitely try that"" if it were available, but probably wouldn't actively seek it out."
"One of my favorites from Lagunitas and I really could drink it all night long, it is robust but it's so balanced from malt and hops while still lending heavily to the main notes from the hops and malts!"
"Drinkabliity is good for such a big beer. Another tasty and unique offering from Lagunitas."
"D- This is a nice brew I just wish there was a little less residual sugar."
"Very rich, but tasty and overall quite drinkable despite high abv."
"I am becoming more and more familiar with Lagunitas but this beer is hands down the best beer that I have had from them. Without knowing what I was opening, I was astonished by all characters of this brew. Beginning with its initial nose right from the bottle, I knew it was going to be delectable. After an aggressive pour, the nose really opened up and the hops jumped right out. The reddish color and clear clarity made this brew refreshing just to look at. The balance of the structure and the length that was evident from start to finish also amazed me. It left my palate satisfied but I could not wait for the next sip. This beverage has definitely climbed into my top three favorites as of late."
"Taste is sweet and hoppy, with tropical fruit flavors from the hops and alcohol reigning supreme. There is some decent balancing from the caramel and sugary malts, but if someone put this in front of me blindfolded, I would have a myriad of Petaluma beers to rattle off. Alcohol is too much and becomes harsh fast. Sorry Lagunitas, if I would have had this before Lucky 13, Imperial Red, Correction Ale, WTF, etc... I would give it higher marks. But it feels like a been there, done that kind of brew."
"However, at 9.75% abv, this is not a session beer. But if you wish to make it one, have a designated driver or drink it either at or within walking (ha ha - pun intended!) distance of your home."
"drinkability: Pretty amazing for as Lagunitas calls it an ""oxymoronic Imperial Mild""."
"This beer poured a clear dark amber color and formed a nice huge off white foam head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and plums. The flavor was of malt, caramel, hops/citrus and a hint of pepper. The body was medium and a bit silky. The finish was bittersweet. Hides the alcohol well."
"Big hops on the palate, rather dry, minimally fruit (cherry pie) enters and subsides quickly. I have serious doubts this is almost 10% alcohol. Bigger malt backbone to it than a lot of the Lagunitas family. Hop quality is the usual citrus feel, closest to grapefruit. Caramel. A little thicker, but nothing that creates that sweet approaching light syrup feel. Lagunitas is always cheap, which makes it a lot more drinkable."
"This poured a clear dark copper, with some off-white head. It smelled like strong copper and resin and herbal hops, with some caramel malt. It tasted like copper and resin and floral hops, with sweet honey malt. It was thick with a little carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this wasn't terrible complex, but it had a great hoppy scent and taste with nice malt balance. Very crisp and clean, with great body too, and very well hidden alcohol. So this was dangerously easy to drink. Excellent beer that's totally under the radar. (I'd love to try it blind with PtE, HopSlam, etc. just to see how much hype affects reviews.) Definitely recommended."
"D: Nice, smooth and well balanced for a big beer. I was surprised to see its ABV is 9.7%, as this went down too easily. Definitely would look for it again."
"It's a good beer, not really my cup of tea, I think it's ok, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. A little above average for me."
"This is a full impact ale in many ways. Sharp-edged metallic, piney and citrusy hops come out with a bang. Sweet caramel malt lays low providing a thin layer of body for the over-whelming hop and alcoholic kick. Tastes of orange Tang and white rum are ever present. The hop punch almost borders on a salty taste, which is completely wrong, yet interesting."
"I'm sad to see this beer as a ""special release""."
"the more Lagunitas i drink, the more i love them. i was a bit skeptical of the style at first, but this proved to be an excellent strong ale. lots of rich malt flavors and a stinging hop bite."
"I poured into a pint glass to an overflowing off white head. It is amber colored. The aroma is fresh grapefruit, orange and maybe some pear. The taste is full of grapefruit but you can tell it has a nice malty backbone. This beer is big on citrus on the smell and taste. I really like Lagunitas as far as hoppy beers go. I am not a fan of big hops but I consistantly like their offerings."
"D- Very drinkable. Down two of these back to back, just be at home."
"D: Dangerously drinkable, I would say. I can definitely taste the 9.75 % alcohol, but it does not affect how easily this one goes down. I will have more of these over time. The only possible downfall of the drinkability would be the obvious sweetness in the taste."
"D-I just love virtually everything these guys do....like Stone, they have a signature profile that they tweak to conform to various styles, but their best efforts are when they just do what they want without regard to convention. Another well made, very drinkable effort."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. Got about 2 fingers of slow dying, white, nice lacing head. Smells a bit of sweet malt, stinky cheese, and typical Lagunitas hop. Tastes a bit sweet, some baking spices and a nice medium long bitter finish. Be careful, as the near 10 percent abv will sneak up on you. Definitely a once a year buy."
"a sipper, for sure. alcohol is present, but at a high ABV and in the style, it is expected and adds to the flavors. Overall a very good beer, but it falls a bit below the expectations set by the aroma."
"D- Very nice! I like this one a lot. The flavor is balanced so nicely between the citrusy hops at the start and the mellow sweetness of the finish. I could drink this all the time."
"D-Very easy to drink. In fact untill I pulled this one up to review I had no idea it was such a high ABV. This one could get me in trouble in a hurry"
"Overall this wasn't great. Too grassy and unbalanced and slightly harsh. A rare disappointment from Lagunitas for me."
"Pour is a medium mahogany/amber with a pretty thin off-white head. Lots of hops on the nose. It's a combo of floral and piney hops. Contrary to the taste, which is pine-centric, the floral note dominates the scent. As I said, pine dominates the taste with a sticky, prickly vibe. There's also a bit of chewy dough taste and caramel from the malts. There's also a citrus presence that intertwines with that piney opening. Nice viscosity and carbonation that pairs well with the biting pine notes. This is another winner from Lagunitas!"
"U.I.S-d.A. (catchy!) is my kind of beer, ""American Strong Ale"" or otherwise. Big, flavorful, balanced, complex. Oh yeah."
"Pours a reddish mahogany color with a thin tan head that retains as well as you could expect for a high ABV beer. The aroma has a huge piney and citrusy hops character upfront, followed by caramel and toffee, dark fruits, and some alcohol. The flavor also has a big hoppyness upfront with notes of pineapple, lime, and pine resin, as well as some juicy malts (caramel, toffee and red vines), dark fruits (fig, plums, raisins), and a decent alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is rich and luxurious without being heavy, and drinkability is decent. Pretty solid strong ale from Lagunitas, but the problem is that it doesn't do much to discriminate itself from their other hoppy strong ales."
"Overall a great sipping beer, one I'll try again."
"Wow this is very drinkable. I feel this could be dangerous considering the ABV as the drink borders session worthy for a beer geek. I would drink this again, and will."
"Drinkability is high simply because it tastes so good, but it is a bit high on the ABV."
"Overall it was a great beer, quite recommendable and one of my favorites from Lagunitas for sure"
"Mouthfeel of fairly lively carbonation balances nicely with the smooth sweetness and is rounded out with a drying alcohol, very good."
"I love it."
"Value: Amazing, as all Lagunitas beers have been so far, worth every penny of the $8.99 I spent on this sixer."
"This is a beer that I like a lot, but just don't have a lot to say about. A nice bitter California-style ale. Average for Lagunitas, very good by the standards of brewers in general."
"*this review was written to my morning jacket's wordless chorus"
"Edit 5-13-2011 - This is better than I remember. Still strong tasting, but better. Nice stuff. I have to tell myself - Bob, buy this every time you see it."
"Pours a medium-dirty penny color, with a pretty decent ecru colored head that lingers atop the beer for quite awhile. Big bubblegum-y hop nose, a little caramel/toffee as well. On the palate I get a lot of spicy/bubblegum hop flavor, along with caramel, a little sweetness and a nice bitter finish. Another great effort from Lagunitas."
"Not too discernable from most lagunitas."
"This can hang w/ the best that Lagunitas has to offer. Highly enjoyable beer right here.."
"D: Not so easy to consume when considering the hefty strength, a flavorful punch of citrus and zesty hops. Big flavor and that heavy 'booziness', just one bottle is more than enough. Good, but not so good that I'm dieing to return..."
"Reviewing yet another Lagunitas American strong ale.Pourd into a tulip glass a clear bronze color with a thinner but well sustained slight off white head,aromas were a bit lighter than expected,mainly some resinous hop and sweetish alcohol.Thinner feel for a ""bigger"" beer and a little prickly.Flavors dont seem to pack enough punch although that could come from the lighter feel,resinous hop intertwined with a hefty caramel malt base,the alcohol creeps as the beer warms.I love this brewery, but I dont love this beer sad to say."
"D: I'd say two or three max. This is a flavor that will wear out its welcome beyond that."
"D-If you like sweet brews, this should be right up your alley. Its too sweet for me to want more than one."
"D: I hope cases of this are expensive, or I might see myself buying too much of this beer. Very malty, but very fruity and hoppy as well. Very refreshing."
"D - Devilishly easy to drink. Perfect balance has no potential for ""overkill"" in any area. Lagunitas has crafted one of there most balanced and drinkable brews yet!"
"And there it is: my first BA review."
"BM if you live in one of the only 4 towns that DON'T get this-- and I'd be more than happy to set something up! ;-)"
"Speaking of wet, if I was a gal, thats what I would be right now"
"D - Nice stuff. Not a big caramel-toffee bomb like so many Lagunitas', and I am glad about that."
"Deep red-amber color with off-white head. sweet malty aroma. Whoa. The alcohol makes its presence known, though not unbearably. Bitter with a hint of a sweet finish to balance it out. Could use a bit more carbonation. Would make for a good sittin by the fireplace nightcapper."
"Overall, I really enjoy this one and would easily recommend it others."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber-mahogany with a thin, fine, tan head. Light hops aroma with some fruitiness and a bit of dry maltiness. Flavor is predominantly of alcohol followed by dark orange peel hops flavors and dry caramel malt notes--all soaked in intense bitterness. The balance is a bit off here. The heavy bitterness works for me but the overt alchohol flavor and hotness doesn't sit well. The hops and malt flavors are good but are shoved into the backseat here. This is a good beer that has some issues."
"A great bang for the buck. Another solid brew by Lagunitas. I'm a big fan of their Maximus IPA, and enjoyed the Lucky 13 as well. Kudos, Lagunitas, you've done it again."
"D: Hoppy but with the water. Sweet and not as bitter. I look for more of a punch in my IIPA but this one I could drink more of because of it's watery nature. Still I prefer a heavier IIPA."
"D: Tasty, though high alcohol prevents me from wanting a second. I'd recommend this and I'd buy a single again, but not a sixer."
"The beer was overall, not very enjoyable--too boozy and not much flavor other than malt sweetness."
"All in all, a good DIPA with a surprising bit of balance. Complex enough for contemplation. A sipper for sure, and strong as can be. Good though."
"thanks!"
"O: very sweet, assertive and interesting, too sweet, classic lagunitas character"
"Overall it's quite interesting, and surprisingly drinkable given its strength. It's not over-done, and the yeasty and hoppy fruitiness is compelling. Worth trying!"
"nice mouthfeel for such a strong beer. not too solid and it's a perfect vehicle for the nice flavors"
"Drinkability: Complex but relatively balanced, a bit sweet; very sippable"
"D - Excellent. This is a damn fine beer that I could drink several pints of in an evening."
"This is an extraordinary brew by a brewery that has recently claimed much of my attention. The aromas that come from this brew were floral hopped and a bit malty. Being imperial, I was a bit surprised with how watery the mouthfeel was, but don't let that deter you from enjoying this brew. The high alcohol content (9.5%) is hidden well and this beer is very smooth. I have had a few of the Lagunitas brews now and this has been my favorite."
"Overall, worth a look, but this isn't one of my favorites from Lagunitas."
"I don't know if having a crappy macro earlier softened me up, but this is delicious. I'd call it a hoppy Imperial Red Ale with good malty sweetness backing strong luscious hop flavors. I like Lagunitas pretty well, but this beer is a lot better than I was expecting. The feel is smooth and rich. The hop flavors don't strip away the palate, but they still provide a great lasting bitter pine/grapefruit flavor. The beer looks pretty great, medium red-amber liquid with an off-white head and plenty of lacing. I fear that I may be using appearance to counterbalance my enthusiasm for other categories, but there are some great looking strong ales, on the other hand. A pleasing touch of caramel malt comes through in the aroma, but it's mostly floral/pine hops. The hop flavors and aromas complement each other well. The hop additions were well-chosen. The malt flavor is stronger than I first thought and very good. I was unaware of the abv when I first tried the beer and would have pegged it two or so percent lower if pressed. It's a very easy drinking strong ale. All around, Lagunitas made a very strong effort with this one."
"I like this beer. It's a decent jab at an IIPA, but it needed to pick either a malty forefront or a more hop centered forefront (especially aroma wise) to be considered a great example of ths style."
"This brew is excellent - can be dangerous as well. The brew is smooth and creamy, has a sweet hoppy taste. Also has a very refreshing taste to it as well."
"Good drinkability, but it will sneak up on you."
"Pours a clear reddish brown colored body, foamy cream-colored head, very lasting. Sweet hoppy aroma, kind of a weird fruity aroma. Not very strong. Pale somewhat hoppy, sweet taste. A mild pale ale. Sweet fruity taste, almost like strawberry. Creamy mouthfeel."
"Growler from Big Z's. Pours a semi hazy amber/brown with a small off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, grassy and citrus hops. Flavor is sweet malt, grapefruit, and citrus (lemon) with a grassy hops finish. Lots and lots of sweet malt in this one. A bit heavy on the palate. Overall a good ASA, just hard to get through a whole pint."
"really can never go wrong with lagunitas, a nice smooth yummy ale"
"Big and ballsy beer here from Lagunitas that reminded me a good bit of Stone's Arrogant Bastard. Beefy and flavorful with a lot of presence on the palate but still really smooth for the size. I enjoyed this a lot."
"drinkability is dangerous at such a high abv - this is not a six pack i could put away on a heavy drinking night or maybe i could because i would not remember drinking the last couple"
"Poured a semi-dark brown body with sheath lacing running all down my glass and a two-finger head. A mix of earthy, piney hops and some sweet malts, like caramel, although mild. Medium to full body with a good balance between hops and malts although the malt sweetness is mild and the hops are the more powerful thing in it. Nice citric and herbal dryness, the taste is good and the mouthfeel has a nice dryness to it in the backend thanks to hop bitterness. Had a bit of creaminess/chewiness to it and I ended up chugging this; had no idea the ABV was that high until I came on this site. Nothing too outstanding but this is still another quality brew from Lagunitas and worth a try by anyone."
"Nicely drinkable beer for 9%. I approve."
"Goes down too easy for a 9% abv beer."
"These guys never fail to impress me. This beer pours a slightly hazy amber with a thin white head that is more of a film on the top. Carbonation is mellow. The initial aroma is a bit faint. Piney, citrusy hops are prominent, with sweet caramel-like undertones. The flavors this beer has are great. It begins with malt flavors of caramel and bread, finishing with crisp hop flavors of lemon peel, grass, and pine. This beer is medium to full-bodied, yet very clean. Although it's high in alc, it's almost non-existent on the palate. I definitely can see why the brewery calls this an ""Imperial Mild."" It's almost too easy to drink."
"Toasted malt mixed with piny, resinous hops. Fruit cocktail and pineapple add a little malty sweetness. A little bit of cookie dough rounds it out. Piny, herbal bitterness into the finish, with lingering fruity malt sweetness. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Another solid American Strong Ale. Keep 'em coming!"
"This beer pours a nice deep clear amber color with a one finger of off white head. Head dissapated relatively quickly leaving very little lacing to speak of. Nose is dominated by piney hops, a touch of caramel malts and a bit boozy. Taste is piney and spicey hops up front, heavier on the caramel malts in the middle, and some hops and dark fruits are detectable in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, feel rather slick going down. Overall a very decent beer."
"Lagunitas Undercover Investigation Shutdown Ale is a crystal clear, rich amber ale with a dense, frothy, off-white head that thins and leaves outstanding lacing. Sweet, resiny malt and bright, fresh, wooden hops are strong and well balanced in the nose. It's medium-full bodied and silky smooth with a quick and slightly sticky finish. It tastes sweet, bitter and bold. The flavors are well balanced and blend together to provide a big, fruity (pineapple), wooden, resiny flavor. It's incredibly drinkable, even at this strength. A very solid American Strong Ale here."
"From six-pack into the pint glass, cold, this brings a dark amber brown color with a goodly, very light oatmeal colored head and decent blotchy lace. The aroma is mostly light citrus hop and brown sugar, a bit sharp but subtle and pleasant. The taste is primarily tart rhubarb citrus with caramel brown sugar malt. It's middle bodied, smooth with fair carbonation, fairly drinkable although I find it a bit more on the ""rhubarb"" side to invite sessioning. I also think it's a bit heavy in the sweetness, almost suggesting cotton candy at times, but it's an enjoyable refreshment, I just don't think I would pound these based on the flavor profile, interesting but not a ""must have""."
"This beer poured a brownish copper with a single-finger head. The smell is lots of different hops with some pine and herbal scents. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that gives away very quickly to two or three different kinds of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. The alcohol content is dangerously hidden in this beer, but it may be a bit too hoppy for some people. Personally I'm glad I snagged a bottle of it,"
"Drinkable? Yes, but not something I can gulp down. Its a sipper."
"Drinkability: How Lagunita's comes up with all these excellent beers is beyond me, but there hasn't been one beer I've tried from these guys that has been dissapointing. This shouldn't be considered a strong ale, this is a perfectly balanced DIPA with an excellent dose of pine and grapefruit for the hop heads built on a beautiful foundation of malt for the true big beer drinkers. This is dangerous might I add, this one drinks like a standard IPA with the alcohol hidden well enough to fool you. I love these creeper beers, you sip and sip until before you know it, the third one catches up and your feeling like you lost track of how many brews you really had. Another excellent offering from a brewery that should be respected and bowed down upon. Highly recommended!"
"One of the better Lagunitas beers I have had. Its got a lot of character from both the hops and malt, but overall falls short of excellence. Worth checking out."
"Clear, dark gold/brown color. Thin frothy head that sticks to the side of the glass. Aroma is of pine hops and lemon peel. At first taste this is quite the bitter brew. Tart on the tip of the tongue with a grapefruit-esque finish and after taste. I think the high ABV is hidden pretty well in this one. This one seems to cross many different style genres."
" really well right now by other brewers."
"Pours a deep orange brown/amber color with very good clarity and a medium sized, puffy, white head that leaves some soapy stickage on the glass. The nose tells you this is a big beer, deep milky sweet malts hit me first with an encore of bitter herbal hops, west coasty but not overkill, im not pulling a ton of citrus out of this one (or alcohol notes for that matter) more pine resin than anything. Damn, this beer is spooky drinkable for being over 9%... This beer is big, but in the most restrained kind of way, the malts get larger and more coating to the tongue as the beer warms, the sweetness (which is rather quite mild) intensifies slightly also. Im impressed. I'm almost interested to see what some age will do to this motherfu...."
"What the hell is this thing anyway? Its categorized here as a strong ale, but it could be a barley wine or maybe a DIPA-- maybe not pale enough though. Whatever, its semantics. Give it a try."
"D: Another nice interpretation of a Strong Ale/Barleywine/DIPA from Lagunitas. Honestly, they have so many, it's a minor miracle they can manage to keep them from blending completely into one another. A strong, surprisingly drinkable big beer. Drinks more like 6.5-7% ABV, so be forewarned."
"Overall: Good drinkability, nice hop flavors and really sweet syrupy flavor/feel to balance it out. Not very complex, just hoppy and sweet, but still a pleasure to drink."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint glass. The ale appears a crystal clear rich crimson amber color with a finger of creamy off white foam. No lacing to speak of. Aromas and flavors consist of citrus notes like lemon, grapefruit pith, orange peel, quite bitter, sweet bready grain, and a light dose of caramel. A notch better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Worth a shot."
"From the name I'd guess Barleywine, because they didn't want to call it a Barleywine-style ale, but the flavor lands closer to Imperial IPA due to the soft malt and subsequent hoppy unbalance. Okay, fine, so it's an American Strong, that's cool. (I don't see any reference to them not wanting to call it a BW, I thought I had them on that one.)"
"Clear red with an inch of sticky tan foam. Nose is tangerines, grapefruit and a hint of pine. Huge hoppy flavour right off the bat - lots of resinous grapefruit with a healthy dose of orange. There's a lot of sweetness is this one, but balances well against the ridiculous hoppiness. Body is appropriate - not too heavy and not too light with a medium-hard carbonation. I'm really liking this one - I would describe it as very smooth and very, very hoppy."
"D- at 9% alcohol and with this much bitterness I would have trouble having more than one in a sitting. That said, the beer isn't hot or offensive or anything so I guess it is pretty drinkable for the type of beer it is."
"Nice balance and fruity/hop character. Fruity, stone fruit flavors with hints of malt and underlying stone fruit flavors; hints of Belgian malts but with a big grapefruit hop finish. Good with food."
"- Drinks well and warm... I got a 6 pack... and maybe on a good night I could finish it! Rather sweet though!"
"D - Definitely not a session beer for me. I imagine it pairing nicely with stew, steamed vegetables, mexican food."
"D-Interesting ale with a strong yet flavorful hop presence. I'd drink it again."
"pours deep amber with a two finger beige colored head that holds up well and a sticky web like lace. smells of sweet tea, sugar, hint of spice, and floral notes in the nose. sweet taste, bitter tea hides alcohol well, lingering bitter tea after taste finish. medium mouthfeel smooth with a slightly slick feel. all of lagunitas beer tend run to the sweet side which i do not care for."
"Overall at 9.02% this was pretty decent. Alcohol is hidden very well. Reminds me a lot like an IPA/DIPA. I could easily have more of this."
"A very drinkable DIPA. This has a nice balance to it and doesn't leave me reeling from hops or alcohol. I would have a few of these over the length of a night."
"D: This is one of those beers that probably won't please everybody, but is definitely drinkable."
"An interesting full-flavored ale. Good to switch things up a bit. Cheers!"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a lighter shade of copper with decent head and lacing. Fruity and grassy in the nose with a nice balance of hops and malt. Not a very overpowering hoppy aroma that you get with a lot of double IPA's. The taste is a bit more hoppier than the aroma would lead me to believe. Nice balance though, with plenty of hops up front and citrus and sweet malt mixed in. Good amount of bitterness comes through after the swallow. Medium body with a modest amount of stickiness. Goes down rather easily for a double IPA. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. It's worth noting that the label on mine indicates 9.03% ABV."
"The beer is medium bodied with high carbonation. This is a decent strong ale."
"Verdict: Since Laguintas has quite a full lineup of American Strong Ales, one would expect them to be pretty good at crafting them by now. So, it's no surprise that Shut-Down is a solid example of the style. It's may not be the most intense or interesting Strong Ale out there, but it's tasty, quite drinkable, and features an interesting focus on hops."
"All, in all, a decent beer, but not much to write home about."
"D= decent. Pretty average brew. Glad I got to try it but average prolly won't get it again."
"Overall impression: Interesting brew, but too sweet for my taste. 1 bottle was enough."
"more than a few."
"So far I have had 2 from a sixer, and the second was much different than the first. The first I did not like as much, the second was sweeter, more citrus and the alcohol was in the background. I love the story behind this beer and think it is a good one to have at a bar, not a session beer, but very solid."
"Drinkability: It's very strong and goes down fast, which is a bit dangerous, especially if you plan on taking down multiple ones. It was average, but I'd take a Censored Copper Ale or their IPA over this beer. It's still worth a shot, as you might be more impressed with the taste than I was and really love it."
"This beer pours a reddish bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm quarter inch of foam. The aroma is pine resin, grapefruit, and lots of caramel. The taste is like the aroma with the addition of an alcohol presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice beer. Although I cannot find anything wrong with it I have a hard time finding what distinguishes it from other American Strong Ales. I would certainly be willing to drink this beer again, but something tells me I will quickly forget it."
"d: actually a pretty smooth brew, just nothing too memorable"
"Wine Specialist/$10.99/Sixer"
"Bottom line I liked it, but I'll keep searching out others in the style before I buy this again."
"Good beer, I remember it being a little maltier back in the day, but still good enough to teach us, but it has to charge."
"D: another great drinker from Lagunitas...yum"
"Drinkability: Awww yes, drinkability. Wiseman Jorge and I slammed these down like water a couple weeks ago at the beach. Not as slammable as I remember, but still pretty tasty. As with most Lah-goo-knee-tuss brews, beware the ABV."
"I don't think I can take any more of this."
"D: Deceptive beer, all the way around, nothing quite adds up here, great taste, but not much in the nose, weird mouthfeel, alcohol burn, but still I want to drink more of it. This beer would definitely get me in trouble. Interesting beer. Highly recommended."
"D- Overall this is a really nice beer, the strength of the beer could hold down the drinkability to under a six pack."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops, sweet malt, hint of syrup, yeast, slight citrus, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Strong Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with an average carbonation level. Wow, the body if bold, but not too complex. Strong hops up front, slight alcohol is noticeable, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Overall, good appearance, great aroma, but the blend and complexity are lacking."
"D- Great nighttime drink. Probably good compliment with a dessert or ice cream. Easy to drink for 9%. Alcohol is hidden very well. Overall and very tasty brew. Mark one more for Lagunitas!!"
"D - Very drinkable. Had it on tap a few months ago and I am pleased to say it is just as good from the bottle."
"3.0 D: One's enough, but I'm not pissed I drank it."
"Drinkability: Definitely sessionable. Enjoy as a refresher after working in the yard most def."
"Good Lord, this is a good beer."
"The sixer is a bit pricey by me...$10.99, but if you like strong ales you should definitely try this one."
"D: This one could cause some trouble. If the label didn't say 9 I would've guessed 6. Thank god for disclosure!"
"For me, this one delivered on flavor. All the complexity I would expect from this style and I love the strong hop counterpoint. I will definitely buy this again. Good on all counts and excellent on flavor."
"D: Highly drinkable for the high ABV, Lagunitas continues to impress."
"D - Good. Could age longer though."
"Pours deep copper with a white modest head. Fair amount of lacings. Nice butterscotch and floral hop aroma. Taste is candy sweet with a big bitter hop partner. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick and has a good amount of pink grapefruit on the back of the tongue. Carbonation is minimal. A trace of alcohol in the taste but pretty well hidden for the 9%abv. Has some scottish ale qualities. All too drinkable. Not a style I would drink frequently but nice for a change."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Bright copper color with a hazy body. Ecru head leaves some decent lacing. Hoppy aroma with notes of lemon meringue, grapefruit, and brown sugar. Flavor is sweet with lots of maple syrup and pink grapefruit. Moderate bitterness and some astringency. Body is medium-full with a soft carbonation. Not as hoppy or bitter as advertised."
"I had never tried this beer from a local brewery but I am very happy I did. Another great beer from the Lagunitas crew."
"All in all, not a bad brew. fairly similar to a few of the other Lagunitas strong ales, which isn't necessarily bad. Really well balanced - almost too much so, as I'm left wanting something more. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden... I would have guessed 7% instead of 9+. Drinkability is high, although it's lacking just a bit of pop and uniqueness to make it incredibly desirable... all in all, can't really knock it."
"This is a really terrific beer with a really terrific name from a brewery I will most certainly be keeping an eye on. Have one and it will take care of the rest."
"D: An easy beer considering the ABV. I'll be reaching for this one again soon."
"I think that this may be my favorite beer to date. It was given to me by my daughters boyfriend. I was not expecting to even have a beer tonight. Lagunitus keeps one-uping themselves. This is a beer that other brewers mighjt have taken too far. Lagunitus has found the proper balance."
"D - Not incredibly drinkable but for an overly hoppy beer its certainly an easier drink than some with this amount of hops."
"All in all, a very good strong ale."
"This is pretty much one or two and done. It's kind of oily and coats the tongue."
"I picked up a 6 pack of this, since its available here in GA, figuring it would be easy to fit in a review at some point. Here I am at the end of the six pack needing to review. Pours a deep red amber color, very dark, but very red, a bit of a diversion from the typical DIPA (I am surprised that is the style, really). A light, white 1 finger head rests atop. Another DIPA diversion would be the sweet malty aroma first, then followed by the hops. This comes through in the taste too, as it is quite bitter, but with a strong sweet counter flavor. Bitterness holds over in the mouthfeel, as well, but still a rather thick brew, with a syrupy sweetness. In the end, a very good beer, but in my opinion, somewhat unclassifiable. Definitely a stronger character to it than many Lagunitas offerings I have had to date."
"Again... Great job Lagunitas!!!"
"D- Damn drinkable for a ""double"" brew."
"Notes: As stated before, this reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada Torpedo. A well-balanced brew with some tropical hop flavors that satisfy my unrelenting cravings, if only for a moment. Just a little too much malt in the way of the hops for my taste. But don't take a hop-heads' word for it, try it for yourself and support a good local brewery while you're at it. If you like aggressively-hopped Barleywines, you will love this!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-0904-Sean"
"D: A little bit on the bitter side--I would like something that's a little more balanced, but overall quite good."
"Overall, lots of booze, little else."
"Nice amber color, rather large off-white head, sticky lacing. Aroma of piney and citrus hops, alcohol, a bit of toasted, caramelized malty goodness. Flavor has a nice hop bite, there's plenty of IBUs to go around, sappy pine and grapefruit, great balance between the bitter and the sweet. Medium body. My only knock on this beer is it's pretty similar to every other hopped-up Lagunitas offerings. Not that it's bad thing, just nothing new. Good beer, though."
"If I did not know that BA classified this as an American Strong Ale, I would probably have thought DIPA. Lagunitas calls it an ""Imperial Mild""... whatever that is. At any rate, it tastes nothing like what I expected, but it's not bad."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, this beer has a nice dark amber color, though with but a modest head atop it. The nose makes up for it, with a deliciously hoppy aroma, tending grassy, citrusy. The flavor is one big continuous blast of hops, hugely citrusy and resinous... the sweet malt only comes through if you concentrate on it. Very bitter and dry in the finish. At less than 9 bucks a 6 pack, a downright bargain for uberhoppy beers."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thick head that has excellant retention. Plenty of sticky lacing. A continous release of tiny carbonation bubbles makes this an attractive beer. Has a heavily hop aroma of pine and grapefruit. I also detect something like sulfer. I don't know where that is coming from. The hops dominate the flavor as well. Mostly pine flavored. Very bitter overall. Not much comes from the malt which this needs to balance things out. Has a nice body with a soft texture dispite the extreme bitterness. Carbonation is just enough to lift the body. Another very one dimensional beer from the West Coast."
"Overall: Very interesting beer. I really liked it! I'm not sure I could have more than one or two but that's alright. I will be buying this again. Try it!"
"D - its a little boozy but i like it"
"The taste is similar, some candied fruit and rum, some caramel, and hop flavours, but with too much grapfefruit and too much rough alcohol. The elements do not marry well but conflict and ultimately it is too bitter, astringently hot, and harsh, with a very drying feel in the mouth."
"Drinkability: I would have this again, but will not search for it. To me this is very hoppy--like a cross between and old ale and an IPA..If you love hops, go for it. I want something a bit more balanced"
"D- Not sessionable, but i would not mind getting drunk off of a six pack. Hey, maybe i will try that on a lazy afternoon during the weekend. This stuff is good and cant be denied even with an apparent change in recipe additions. A lot of beers I get from lagunitas taste the same but this is a step in a different direction, one that I welcome with open arms."
"As easy to drink as it is enoyable. The level of balance is very pleasing, and often lacking in this style. Worth seeking."
"This is a great brew. I'd gladly buy it again, and recommend it to anyone who loves DIPAS."
"For a beer that most have filed under ""hoppy", I feel that the hops were manageable and well-balanced with a tasty maltiness. Generally, I don't care for extra hoppy beers and this was more than pleasantly great. Minimal head, piney -citrussy nose - soft amber in color, a beer that I wish I hadn't already finished!"
"This is just awesome. Really, really nice. The only drawback was finding the 9% alcohol level. It'd be far to easy to drink about 6 of these without blinking an eye. Hoppy but with just enough hops to keep it appropriately balanced. Really nice find."
"D - Good, would have been better if the alcohol wasn't so prominent."
"Overall- a but restrained for what I'm used to from Lagunitas, but other then that, a great beer. Flavorful enough to drink several. Underwhelming, compared to the rest of this brewery's line-up. Do I have a problem if I consider this session-able?"
"Morey's Bottom Line: If you're a fan of the style....this is a must try. A well made beer without a doubt. For me, it's a bit sweet though."
"Another solid beer from Lagunitas. A bit too sweet and boozy for my tastes, but otherwise not bad at all."
"M + D: Sparkling and rather assertive carbonation. Medium body, with a slight bit of chewiness and a lasting flavour. This is a pretty good beer, and I would be happy to have another."
"I could drink this beer a lot, but I shouldn't drink a lot of this beer, if that makes sense. It's boozey, but the flavor and smoothness make you want to pound quite a few back. Probably not a good idea."
"Overall- The alcohol is too present and too hot. Flavors take a back seat here. Won't have again."
"Love this one."
"Drinkability- Very strong, and confused."
"D - Good for year 'round, I think. Probably is food friendly, too. The ABV is pushing the envelope, however."
"Pours a reddish brown with a little white foam forming on the top. Spiderweb lacing. Smells of piney hops, some hint of citrus, sweet malt. Flavor is a strong sweet hoppy smackdown with pine, cane sugar and caramel. Sticky and syrupy but in a way that makes me think of hop resins, so i guess thats ok. A bit messy and a bit over the top with the hops, though it manages to approach some kind of balance because the malt and alcohol are why out there too. This is about what I expect from Lagunitas...good, not great, but worthwhile...usually."
"A fantastic American Strongle Ale/DIPA that deserves more recognition than it's getting."
"Another sugar bomb. A marshmellow merengue head floats atop a burnt amber body. The aroma is faint, but cookies and hop spice jump out the pint. The body is crisp for a heavy ale, bubbly thick syrup with plenty of residual sugar lacing. Light caramel, mineral, blood sap, and confectionary sugar. A balanced center that goes candided hop imbalance toward the end. The bubbles help to scrub out the booze. Interesting but I wont be stopping by for another."
"Clear amber with fizzy white head that leaves some lacing. A strong hop presence in scent: aggressive on pine notes, some alcoholic sting, slight fruit tang. Alcoholic booze bullies around the hops in taste from start to finish. Some notes of citrus poke their heads out from the chaos and then hide when big bad ABV comes back. Hop bitterness lasts in the aftertaste. Carbonation is on the attack as well stinging the tongue until it is swallowed down. Drinkable but a bit mouthfeel can be rather annoying."
"Recommended..."
"i was lucky enough to have experienced this ""sneak release"" it was great. a nice double hopped i.p.a. a little more carbonated than i would have liked but no biggie. the story behind it is cool and i feel honored to have gotten to try it. i bought three six packs of it so if anyone wants some within the next month or so then let me know."
"By far one of the best beer ""surprises"" I've had in awhile!!!"
"Overall: I'm really enjoying this one. This is something I'll definitely be picking up another six pack of."
"No alcahol warming at the knose or in the taste. Outstanding beer!"
"Overall impression: Dangerous - the alcohol definitely isn't hidden, but its smooth and flavorful - I could drink several of these, but it would probably be a bad idea."
"Very nice, well done, but don't think I could have more than one. Are mild supposed to be 9%?Not sure...not...sure..."
"Drinkability is hindered only by the strength. It's a great beer that I will probabaly be buying another sixpack of just to see how it ages."
"A good DIPA, but seems just a little thin for the style. However, it's highly drinkable which is a little dangerous for this one considering it's 9+%ABV. Proceed with caution. Recommended."
"A world class beer!"
"Overall, this was easy to put down and enjoyable. Some will argue this is a ""well balanced Double IPA"" and I hear ya, but I am one who wants a HOPS-forward IPA, not a MALT-forward one. But, to each their own..."
"Drinkability: An interesting and pleasant beer, heavy and dense with tons of residual sugar and tropical, citrusty, piney notes as many of the Lagunitas beers are ... it definitely doesn't feel like 9.28% abv, though, so I gotta give it that. Either way, I'd have liked to try this one in its fresh state - alas. Nonetheless, many, many thanks to numbeercruncher - this is a solid, tasty beer, delicious, malty, hoppy, everything a good beer should be."
"Interesting beer. Pours clear mahogany with a decent, but short-lived head. Floral, hoppy aroma with pine and nuts. Leads you to believe this will be more on the Imperial Red side. Its not. Lots of malt and caramel, with some woodiness. The hops are there, but very tempered, almost run over by the malt. In the end, this is still pretty good."
"Prosit, MK"
"D: The abv was fairly well hidden making this a moderate drinking dipa. Liked it, but to closely resembled their other beers to truly stand out by itself and be different."
"A delicious brew that is hoppy, yet well-balanced. A nicely done, drinkable DIPA."
"Non the less, a very special brew!"
"D - Pretty decent, not the best example of a double, but certainly worth a try. For the price (pretty sure this bomber was less than $5) it's a great deal. If you are a fan of really big brews, however, I would recommend this one."
"D- Honestly, I'm kind of feeling it after one. It's delicious and well balanced, so i highly recommend it, though moderately and carefully. I'll limit myself to one or two a month."
"Poured into a snifter. Very nice tan head, with good retention. Gorgeous reddish amber color with a nice halo effect after the head settles. Very nice lacing as well. Sweet rich malty aroma, with lead fruits such as apples, figs and raisins covered with a strong alcohol aroma. This beer has aged some. The extra time mellowed this one out perfectly. Flavors of figs and raisins with some spice. Very complex palate. A little fruity, but it is still a kick ass brew. The mouthfeel is unbelievably smooth, with a low to mild carbonation level. Beautiful palate. Overall, this beer was great the first day I had it, but the aging just makes this outstanding."
"Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale (that just rolls off the tongue!) is a great beer, and very drinkable for being 9%. One of the better brews to come out of Lagunitas, this hefty red should become a staple of their lineup. You heard it here first, folks!"
"Big body, very viscous, Great mouthfeel and highly drinkable. Wish I had the whole bomber to myself today."
"Toast comes to mind and breadyness, Caramel and biscuit. Malt is impresing me more than the hops, butthe bitterness is there."
"Wonderful ""change-of-pace"" brew if you are used to drinking the western American Pales and IPA's. Imagine the understated sweetness of a Dogfish Head 90 coupled with the punchy finish of a quality barleywine style. I have no experience with this brewery, but this offering will definitely get me to try a few others."
"Is there a more sessionable DIPA out there? Probably not. Should this beer even be classfied as a DIPA? Probably not. It characteristics are more akin to that of a barleywine or a strong ale. But no matter how one may choose to describe it, it's a damn fine brew."
"Overall a nice effort which might have veered a bit toward Old ale/Strong ale or barleywine during an eight month hiatus as it was lost in my cellar with a few friends."
"A very drinkable beer. I am really starting to love Lagunitas as more of it becomes available in my area."
"Thank you, Lagunitas. You never disappoint. A beer to definitely try."
"Drinkability is good. I drank this one way too fast because it was so tasty. Not a session beer by any means, but a very enjoyable experience."
"Pours a gorgeous rich mahagony color, with some nice lasting white head. Smell is pretty nice and hoppy with a slight touch of malt perhaps and a bit of noticeable alcohol present especially as it warms some. Moderately bittered for the style, and is nicely hopped, but the noticeable alcohol taste rather, is what caused me to not like it too much. Finish is mild lasting bitterness and chest warming alcohol. I don't like tasting the alcohol in my beer this much."
"M&D - now that i see this is a DIPA, it makes a bit more sense, rather nice and easy to drink, a bit harsh at first, but finishes nicely"
"Very clear orange-amber beer with a large off-white head. Head lingers and leaves lace to the last sip. Aroma is hoppy, but well balanced with malt and crystal notes, plus significant but soft alcohol notes. Flavor is very hoppy, but again with a good malt backbone to balance it out. Mouthfeel is on the high side of medium. Tail lingers well with a nice hoppy character, but with some faint apple notes."
"Drinkability- I had to ramp the drinkability and mouthfeel on this one. It went uphill by leaps and bounds giving more than I ever expected this beer to. On par with other hoppy offerings by Lagunitas, but this is one of the higher rating ones."
"From the moment you pour this beer, you know it's going to be a bit different. The amber color, the off-white creamy/thick head, the sweet yet hoppy nose... And then the taste! It's not at all like an IPA in my opinion, no way - IPAs smack your taste buds with piney resin flavors and bitterness and this is sweet. Malty, mellow sweetness with a touch of hops and alcohol to balance it out. To me, this beer is THE perfect balance of malt, hop and alcohol. I could drink a lot of these (if I could only get my hands on more of 'em)."
"Due to the lack of hoppiness and prevalence of layered maltiness I would venture to guess this sample might not have been so fresh."
"Lagunitas Sneak Release Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale pours a clear orange red with a nice creamy head that lingers for quite a while. From the moment I opened the bottle I was hit with big citrusy hop aroma, grapefruit, and pine backed up with a good amount of malt sweetness. The sweetness is predominate in the flavor, lots of caramel and toffee, but there is no lack of citrusy hop flavor. There is a nice bitterness that rounds out the beer, but not overpowering for the beers strength. A bit of alcohol comes through in the finish, but not too much for a beer of the strength."
"Sheesh, whata tasty beer  Im very pleased to see that this one is now a rotating release."
"One of, if not the best beer I have had in the past 6 months. I have nothing bad to say about it. Also great with food (I had it with some steak). The story behind it is what got my attention and I knew I had to try it. The taste is not too hoppy, but its presence is definitely there. Color is a rich amber red, with a good frothy head. Please try this beer, its worth it!"
"A nice beer, great woody hops, nice balance, a good offering from Lagunitas."
"Hazy scarlet red appearance. Thin dirty white head. Lace is weblike and quite intricate. Aroma is of juicy, plump hop nuances as well as thick caramel malt tones. First sip contains alcohol, biting hops and big caramel malt. The alcohol smooths out as it warms and the juicy hop flavor come out more. The bitterness is just right for a DIPA. This is very nicely balanced for a DIPA. But hops and bitterness still rule. Medium full body and moderately carbonated. This one's going down too damn fast. What a steal for 3.99 a bomber."
"Heads up to Lagunitas for delivering yet another unique brew. I may have to pick up a few bottles to stash in my cellar"
"A: Red/amber, lots of very puffy head. Very active carbonation, moderate lacing. S: Really enticing; sweet up front with a lot of earthy hops. T: Very robust, but really nicely balanced. Much like the smell, it's got a lot of malt up front, but it's followed closely by some really delicious hops. The finish is pretty incredible; sort of like an emmentaler or gruyere. M: Pretty coarse, thick and chewy. D: All in all a really wonderful IIPA. I almost question the style designation, it's definitely hoppy but it's by no means overly aggressive. But whatever it is, it's a wonderfully balanced, enjoyable, delicious beer."
"Pours an orange, redish color with a sparkling body, and foamy nice light brown colored head. Smell is grape, sweet malt, and borders on a little of a barleywine type of aroma. Taste is of honey, sweetness with a little bit of bitter after taste. Crisp carbonation followed by a warming alcohol presence. Nice beer, glad they were not shut down."
"The feel is thick, creamy and bubbly. Leaves a thick film. A really substantial brew. Really delicious, and though it's heavy, it's a fast, easy drinker."
"Recommended if you can still find this anywhere, one of the better brews I have had from Lagunitas and definitely gave Kill Ugly Radio a run for its money"
"I poured this big beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. This beer was an exciting brew. It was a bit red looking with a nice head and lacing. The smell was nice a little hoppy but very nice. The taste was a little bitt little hoppy but very tolerable. A bit strong this beer will put a hurtin on you for sure. But the high alcohol did not wast away the taste, so I will have to say I would buy again."
"This is all-around strong - strong hops, strong malts, strong alcohol. It's a nice taste, but one is more than enough at a time."
"The beer makes good its escape from the 22 ounce bottle a cloudless burnished copper, the head perfection, the color light tan and the texture creamy, upon its inevitable demise, the lace forms a thick glutinous sheet to obfuscate the glass. Nose is chockablock with the hop flowery aroma, sweet malt supports the hops, hints of caramel, appetizing, nay mouth watering I say. Start has a pleasant malt profile, sweet with a definite hop spicy bitterness at the back, top is middling to full in its feel to the palate. Finish continues the big hop spicy bite, the acidity customary, the aftertaste dry as a bleached desert bone, my oh my if this aint a great beer, then Im a teetotaler, and we know that aint so. lol"
"D- a solid IIPA, ill take some more"
"The taste is a very good blend of hops and malts, stronger on the hops side with some good strong bitterness. I detect a slight alcohol burn but not over the top. It increases as it warms. This beer is excellent and has a very nice medium body."
"The taste is smooth and sweet, with caramel and toffee malts paving the way. It's not nearly as hoppy as I would've liked (after all, it is a DIPA), but the finish produced a decent bitterness. Body is semi-viscous and perfectly carbonated with a decent bite that makes you perk up and take note. I can't say I'd seek out this one again, as there are many, better double IPA's out there, but it does go down smoothly and drinks amazingly well."
"Overall: Finally, a Lagunitas specialty/seasonal that I can love! Delicious, American barleywine/American strong ale. Solid in almost every way, this is perhaps the best Lagunitas I've ever had (and you can see from my reviews that I've had a lot.)"
"Double IPA huh? My first thoughts were that it was a lighter barley with a touch of cocoa. It actually appears a bit like a dark amber, and the malts are sweet and fruity, and like I said, there's a touch of chocolate flavor. The hops didn't seem that big, citrus and peppery, but not nearly as big as Great Divide's Hercules DIPA. For a DIPA, it leaves hops to be desired, for a strong ale, it's pretty cool."
"D - Excellently balanced beer, hops and malts at perfect harmony which is my favorite kind of beer. Highly recommended."
"Tastes of sweet malt then the hoppy piny bitterness hits you. Has a good clean bitter finish that holds on. A great beer to sip on as the alcohol is very warming but not that evident on my palate."
"Highly recommended. If you see it, pick it up and take it home."
"This is the ""SNEAK RELEASE"" not the ""12th Anniversary"" edition. Wouldn't put this in the IPA or IIPA genera; I'd like it in the Strong Ale category. Yes it is a hoppy beer, but the spice profile in the malts give this a big big boost. Not as good as Mendicino's Eye of the Hawk, but better than Stone's Arrogant Bastard. A bit chalky on the palate. Nice buzz though. Good, but I wouldn't rave about it..."
"Overall: Another great beer by Lagunitas. For $4 a bomber their beers can not be beat. I spent the day relaxing at the beach and upon coming back inside the beach house I popped this one open. It was so smooth and refreshing, I think I may now lay down and take a nap. I'm gonna throw a Maximus in the fridge, it would be perfect this evening while enjoying one of west coast Florida's most beautiful sunsets from a chaise lounger on Longboat Key. If I'm not unconscious by then I may just be inclined to drink their newest release Kill Ugly Radio, as I think about my wonderful day, and what else lies ahead during my holiday / birthday weekend at the beach."
"Overall, I really liked it; I am not sure that it fits in the genera in which it was placed here, but definitely worth a try."
"Lagunitas Sneak Release Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale pours a dark, reddish copper color with an of white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit milder than I would like, it is primarily hops. There is a strong hop flavor up front that fades to a strong malt flavor toward the end. Pretty decent, worth a try."
"Enjoyable brew for sure, but not my favorite DIPA (and I should point out that the label never refers to it as an IPA or Double IPA - only an ""especially bitter ale."" I'm really not even sure it's a DIPA. It shares some characteristics but it's got more malt flavor and less hop flavor than most DIPAs). Definitely worth a try though."
"Considering the price tag is a bit (in some cases quite) lower than other DIPA's definitely something I would get again."
" Perhaps not a classic but a solid, drinkable American Strong for sure."
"Overall, more hoppy than malty. That is a rare occasion for a DIPA nowadays it seems. Very good. Highly recommended!"
"d- Balanced and warm DIPA that is smooth drinking, the abv is very well-masked, not the hoppiest DIPA, but a solid entrant in this category"
"This is a good, solid beer, but it failed to wow me. There's not really anything terribly unique or distinctive about it. It's still very good and pretty cheap. I may get it again if the mood strikes me. Recommended."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head over the clear coppery amber brew. Head lasts well, with tons of sticky lace froth. Aroma is fresh citrusy hops with twinges of pine as well. Taste is ample maltiness to start, which is quickly balanced and overpowered a bit by the dominant hops flavor. Particularly the pine lingers, and there is warming after toughts as well. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly due to the strength of hops character, but this one remains plenty drinkable."
"This is a very accomplished and polished Double IPA and a nice spin on a style that many believe has just one note."
"Characteristically, it appears very much like a red: deep amber in color with a finger head that laces quite nicely. There's a lot more malt than your traditional DIPA. There's plenty of hops there too, seems like it should be a strong ale. Again fuck it, it's a good beer. Enjoy one."
"Drinkability: kind of a slow sipping beer here as the alcohol is high and the bitterness is bold. Definitely worth giving this a shot."
"For $3.99 per 22oz bottle, you can't go wrong with Lagunitas."
"Picked this up at Casanova's in Wisconsin-if it's a DIPA I must try it. This was a tasty beer, but reminds me more of a barleywine--more sweetness and maltiness than many DIPAs but quite good."
"I am personally a fan dark beers, the muddier the better. I do enjoy this beer a great deal, I recommend a try."
"Good stuff to start the weekend after a long work week. Hopefully it's all uphill from here!"
"22 oz bottle. Pours a clear dark copper with a beige head. The aroma contains a moderate amount of nice floral hops. The first sip is a little sweet, however it contains a solid caramel malt backbone that quickly turns to hops and finishes with a good strong hop flavor. Grapefruit, pine, and earthy hops carry through to the finish. The pine and grapefruit flavor lingers in the aftertaste for quite awhile. The 9.28% abv is well disguised beneath the hops. This beer exhibits a Medium body with moderate carbonation and could pack a wallop if too many are consumed."
"Raw and delicious. A best choice for the price ($3.99) and the complexity. Hope i can get my hands and the real deal soon."
"Cheers"
"I have recently enjoyed kicking off the night of sampling different beers with one or two of these bombers. Sure there is a decent amount of alcohol in it but the complex taste of this release allows the average Beer Advocate enthusiast to savor the beer and keep from downing it too quick. At only $3.99 a bomber - Lagunitas continually impresses me with their outstanding and consistent releases."
