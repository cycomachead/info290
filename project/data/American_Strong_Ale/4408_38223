4.04,9.2,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Somehow I managed to completely freeze a bottle of this for a night, so there's no telling if the thawed version will still deliver the typical knockout experience. Poured in to a New Belgium tulip, the exceptionally murky ruby red grapefruit colored beer produced little head, no lacing, and left only some shiny hop oils on the surface. Under the light, the drink slightly resembles a stiff bloody mary, minus the celery stalk. There's lots of aromatic biscuit malts in the nose, with some lemon citrus hop. Sweet flavors come to the fore, with a nice biscuit backbone. The counterpunch is a minty, orange zest hop bite that keeps it in balance. The bitterness linger a bit, melding with a caramel sugar sweetness. The finish is pretty juicy. The alcohol is certainly there, but it remains understated for such a strong ale. The mouthfeel is pretty robust, with a gentle, yet spry carbonation. Well, I'm glad to see that my freezer faux pas did not damage the beer. It delivered exactly what I have come to know from this brew.  A very tasty, well-balanced American ale that will knock you on your ass.","JohnnyI","Jan 11, 2015"

My goblet may have proven stronger than their Strong Ale, but I backed off and allowed it to settle some before proceeding. I have to admit, though, that the density of the head was phenomenal, creating a mound of dense, rocky, light-tan head with excellent retention. Nose was rich with caramel and toffee notes as well as a decent alcohol burn that tickled my nostrils. Color was a cloudy orangish-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13). Mouthfeel seemed to be on the thin side and man, it brought the heat right from the outset! This would have been illegal to make and sell in South Carolina up until recently and they seem to be making up for lost time. I hold with my initial assessment about it being rich and malty sweet, but I was not getting much in terms of hops. My goblet was ringed with dense lacing as I drank. Phew! Finish kept up the heat, then slowly reduced to near candy-like sweetness. One of these will be plenty, thanks.","woodychandler","Jun 28, 2014"

The taste is maybe not as complex or layered as better strong ales, but the beer is still very tasty. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the spice and alcohol heat combination makes for a great finish. This is definitely better than I expected it to be coming from Spartanburg (sorry, Sparkle City). Tasty and drinkable beer.","BlackBelt5112203","Sep 20, 2012"

Medium carbonation and a full body slightly creamy mouthfeel. This beer is very interesting and keeps me coming back for more and more sips. Easy drinking, and a very well done Strong "Imperial" Bitter.

3.95,6.8,4,4,4,4,3.75,"O: A bold and flavorful beer that is reminiscent of Bell's Hopslam, albeit much sweeter and less finely crafted. In fact, my main reservation about this beer is that it seemed a bit roughly put together, like a very good homebrew. Some of that impression comes from the high levels of both sweetness and bitterness, with the bitter losing out until the aftertaste. It also lacks the complexity of a world class brew. Still, as a local brew it is about about half the price of Hopslam. Worth a try, for sure.","chinchill","Sep 19, 2011"

It smells like a pine forest, needles, branches, and all, with a little boozy character throughout. In the flavor, all of that pine is contrasted by big burnt caramel character. The texture is fine but average. In one sense, this beer provides the bold yet reasonably balanced flavor profile of a decent barleywine with a slightly lower alcohol content. On the other hand, this beer tastes like a barleywine despite its (comparatively) lower ABV, and it is never a good thing for a beer to taste boozier than it is. In the end, though, the beer was enjoyed, which is good.","devilben02","Aug 30, 2011"

Aftertaste shows a little bit of hops (I'm pushing the envelope here to find something positive) and a tiny bit of pit fruits and almost nothing else. Overall, a pretty uninteresting beer - I was expecting much more from the taste, but this one is very weak in the flavour - the look and smell are okay, but there is nothing at all to this beer. I think I've grown tired of giving RJ Rockers my money to be uninspired by their work.

For me it was super malty. There were no hops to really speak of. While you could get that it was pretty high in the alcohol value - that's all there is to this beer. Malt and alcohol.

There are some lightly citric spicy hops that add some bitterness, and the alcohol is well hidden this time, but the hops are not the star they should be.

3.4,-8.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability: A fine, tasty brew, but those of you seeking a really punchy hop character or a coma-inducing level of hop bitterness will be left disappointed and full of rage. Instead of a double IPA it's more like a one-and-a-half IPA.","ChainGangGuy","Aug 09, 2008"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability is really pretty high. It has a lot of character of a lighter IPA, though with good depth and decent bitterness. I found this one to be fresh and easy drinking, despite its abv and overall strength.","lightindarkness","Jun 06, 2008"
3.15,-14.9,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"A little on the hazy side with an amber/orange hue. There was a smattering of off-white foam from the pour that quickly settled to a thin ring and skim of fine bubbles. Looked sort of viscous during the pour. Floral hop aroma with quite a bit of caramel. Note of citrus and pine were present, but weren't very strong. Solid bitterness, not overpowering, that became piney towards the end. Quite sweet, lots of caramel particularly just before the finish, which then stayed fairly balanced between malt and pine. Hint of lingering alcohol on the tongue. Full bodied with carbonation a little bit low, fairly smooth and viscous. Nicely balanced and easy to drink, but lacking the hoppy punch that I expect from a DIPA. It seemed like it was crossing into american barleywine territory, especially in the flavour.","DrJay","Jun 05, 2008"
3.06,-17.3,4,3,2.5,4,3.5,"The lingering bitterness reduces drinkability points. The 8.5% alcohol is well-concealed, though, and aids in the drinkability. I am however, glad to see more Southeastern breweries taking on these big styles we've been so deprived of.","bobbyc881","May 12, 2008"
4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Amber-brown color with good head of suds. Very smooth for such a potent brew. Great balance of bitter hops and sweet malt. Robust and potent but terrific drinkability. Next to the Patriot Ale, this is the best brew that Rockers does and certainly the most kick-ass.","dhd1491","Apr 24, 2008"
4.07,10,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Bell Ringer pours an orange-amber with a small half inch white head. The head dissipates to wisps of foam, leaving a small amount of lace down the side of the glass. The smell is full of sweet, toasty, and caramel malts rounded off by citrusy hops, perhaps cascade, which I believe I remember from a visit as the brewer's favorite. The taste is up front with a bready malt characteristic along with some caramel flavor. While the hops certainly make a presence, this is not a Double IPA. The malt and hops stay in balance with each other, which will separate this from your average Double IPA. Alcohol also makes a slight appearance. The mouthfeel is nice: medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Overall, this is very good beer and remarkably drinkable for the alcohol content. I probably prefer a Double IPA, but as far as the double pale style goes, this one is far more drinkable than most.","MSchae1017","Apr 20, 2008"
4.5,21.6,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Overall this was just great. I cannot say enough good things about this. It was well crafted, awesome to drink and just a fantastic beer, anyone who wants to try, a growler is on its way I would be happy to send it!!","mikesgroove","Aug 16, 2007"
