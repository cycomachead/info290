4.46,9.6,4,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,"Look is a clear burnt orange. Darker than copper, I'd say. Tannish, thick, long-lasting head. Smell is of hops, quite perfumy. Makes it hard to wait for the tasting. Taste is balanced very much in favor of hops, so this ale as bitter as a standard IPA, but it's sweet and peppery, and therefore fairly well balanced (excepting malt qualities) probably owing as much to the high alcohol (says 9.3% on my bottle, not 9.7%) as it is to the variety of hops. A strong and more bitter aftertaste, but still sweet and peppery. Somewhat like a vegetable broth, but not overwhelming like you'd notice in Bridgeport's Hop Czar Imperial IPA, for example. It's warming as and after it goes down. There's a slight chewy/oily sensation on my teeth as it lingers and even after it's gone. Leaves the mouth fairly dry and constricted, especially if you wait a few minutes. The combination of the bitter, warming, and drying qualities cause my lips, tongue, teeth and hard palate to feel pleasantly numb. My brain is probably next. Thank you, alcohol! At least let me finish my review before you set in! I really took my time writing it and managed to drink the whole thing before it was completed. Oops!","Libeertarian","Mar 19, 2015"

Taste the same as aroma with some good earthy hops bitterness, yeast and some notes of brown sugar. A medium to full body, smooth and a sticky mouth feel, good carbonation on the palate. Finishes with a good portion of sweet caramel malt, yeast a bit of dark fruit and brown sugar flavors and earthy hops on the ending. Has a nice caramel malt character and well behaved hops bitterness. Overall a well balanced and good drinking brew.","Samp01","Sep 26, 2014"

There are a lot of styles being thrown around here, including DIPA, American Barleywine, and Weizenbock, which I assume is what led the brewers to label it as the nebulous ""Strong Ale."" Despite my negative comments, I'd like to revisit this beer afresh when it's less than a month old, as I think the desired flavors will be more present. Still, I expected better shelf-life from a 4-month-old, refrigerated, 9.5% ABV beer from an otherwise excellent brewery.","JamesShoemaker","Jul 25, 2014"

The aroma is of ripe oranges at first with brown sugar. The taste is the same and starts out that way with a slightly bitter malt finish. But doesn't linger. You can also taste the higher alcohol content in as well. Perfect carbonation. A different brew but tasty.

This got shoved to the back of the fridge. I have to admit I really like it. It is not nearly as bitter as I feared. There are some bitter notes in the middle but really well balanced with pine and fruit flavors. There is a slight dry bite at the end but it is not unpleasant. Also the 9.7% ABV comes through a little bit with some heat. Overall this is well balanced and really drinkable.","fscottkey","May 14, 2014"

As looks go you can't do better then this, once poured you won't be able to wait to sip this brew. The high abv isn't unbalanced in the taste of this brew. It has a nice hop flavor but not over board. Very smooth drinking with a slight dryness. Very clean on the palate, it's not heavy or in your face but full bodied and flavorful. The smell is pleasant. The hop comes thru on the smell big time. This is an awesome brew, I had it a while back but never rated it so was waiting to try again before rating.

The nose is a blend of sweet tropical hops over a slight grapefruit coupled with a sweet caramel background. Almost full bodied with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is quite nice, complex and fairly well balanced. It begins with the tropical and grapefruit hops of the nose which flows into a pleasant tasty bitterness. The bitterness fades into the background hop and caramel sweetness. The finish is smooth and a slight medicinal alcoholic bite lingers. The medicinal finish is the only flaw with this well crafted exceptional ale, but at 9.7% alcohol it is minimal.

The taste is even more complex, with a wide variety of malt and hops flavors balancing against each other and holding the whole beer up. I'd expect such a complicated beer to be a little heavier in body, but it in no way is a problem and there is a nice smooth finish. This is a great example of a strong ale.","delta490","May 12, 2014"

Decent clarity bit clearly there is some kind of minuscule sediment in there when held up to light. Brussels lacing. That telltale hop aroma is consistent with other Lagunitas beers. It's more of a pint like hop aroma but is clearly a blend with some tropical smelling hops. I also get some alcohol and a Belgian yeast aroma and light malt. The front of the palate is sweet grains and alcohol which quickly jumps into that piney/tropical hop flavor. Then there is moderate carbonation and the warmth of alcohol. The fade is dry and more along the lines of the warming alcohol.","Franziskaner","May 03, 2014"

Citrusy malty flavor at the beginning, followed by a slight piney hoppy finish. It leaves slight hoppy aftertaste but not much. It goes down very smooth and hides the alcohol content very well. Very well balanced beer. Very good. Be careful because it is definitely not a session beer.","jngrizzaffi","May 03, 2014"

3.92,-3.7,4,3.75,4,3.75,4," The taste is a complex blend of citrus ans spice flavors from NW hops and some yeast in the taste which brings a fruity dark berry quality with moderately sweet almost caramel flavor in the malt which supports the hop bitterness. The alcohol is relatively subdued and emphasizes a slight spice/pine-like element more toward the finish but there is still enough sweetness to blanket the palate as it finishes smooth. Overall I like the intensity it is a little sweeter than most in this style, could almost be blurring the lines of English barleywine but is very hoppy which is why I think it fits the style of American Strong well - pretty drinkable but I would share this if possible.","Slatetank","Apr 16, 2014"

4.64,14,3.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,"O- For the style, this is an exceptional beer. However, this is too reminiscent of Lagunitas' Brown Shugga' to make it stand out in their profile. However, being an absolute fan of the latter, I am fortunate to have a similar (yet seasonal) offering without having to wait an entire year. If you assume that UCIS-DA is yet another Double IPA, then think again. If you are a fan of (fresh) Brown Shugga', then you can revel in a second round come this Spring Seasonal.

4.09,0.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Dark Amber in color with a fantastic head that left a pretty sticky web of lacing on the glass. Nose is sweet with tropical fruits and pine; resin, a sweet maple candy note, boozy and warm smelling at the end. The maple candy flavor is at the forefront along with tropical fruit and resin from the hops. Sweet and boozy with very little back end bitterness. Warms the chest once it's down. Full mouthfeel with ample carbonation to keep it from feeling like syrup. While there is definitely hop bitterness at the end, there is not quite enough to give this beer balance, and it comes across as rather too sweet and heavy. While it's not perfect, it is definitely unique and has it's own signature flavor. Lagunitas makes my favorite beers, hands down. Little sumpin, sumpin, Brown Sugga, Lagunitas Sucks are all amazing brews, and Undercover Investigation is set to join the line of winners from this brewery.","Aaron_Ramson","Apr 11, 2014"

That, and it becomes rather harsh when warmed up sufficiently. I won't be returning to this one when just about everything else from Lagunitas shows off their (awesome) house character better.","ThisWangsChung","Apr 10, 2014"

This one pours a beautiful reddish light mahogany color with an ample and lasting off white head that leaves very substantial lacing. The aroma is a perfect blend of west coast hops and rich malty sweetness. The nose is quite dank with citrus, pine, and grass hops as well as a very nice amount of malt to balance the beer. The mouthfeel is smooth but thick and coating in the best way. The flavor is everything the nose promises but not quite so balanced. It is a very well crafted beer but the hops slightly overtake the malt in the mouth. It is sweet but not the rich sweetness that you get from a well made barleywine, almost unnecessarily sweet. This is good but not my favorite from Lagunitas.","lochef81","Apr 07, 2014"

At first I had a few that I was not impressed at all about, but the more I keep trying them lately it was me or I was getting older batches, something. Maybe I should revisit them. Although, I have found that breweries that do great ales and IPA's don't make the best lagers or pilsner's. The one I hit hard was the Pils, anyway, to this one, it was amazing. The hops was there, for sure, but it was so well balanced. It was in the same line as the Sucks, of which I have one or two left, so I may do a comparison. Anyway, the color was nice reddish brown and the aroma was magnificent. So far this is my favorite Cali brewery for sure, I need to revisit Stone, as I have been hearing a lot about the Enjoy by series, anyway, this one is awesome, not much to complain about here.

4.01,-1.5,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"Enjoyed a single bottle poured into an American-style pub glass. Looks like whiskey, a gentle reddish amber color with a fearsome beige head of around four inches height. Aroma is citrus-forward, tangy and fruity with a faint chocolate and rum note, raisins, grapefruit rind, pine oil. Smells very hoppy but tastes very malty. I get a massive dollop of orange cream, candied mandarins, raisins, sweet rum, brown sugar, apple peels, and a nondescript floral note that flits in and out of awareness. There is enough pine resin and other hop aromatics to numb the mouth just a little, but a barley sugar sweetness protrudes and gathers steam, settling on the palate to keeps things firmly anchored in malt territory. Amazing mouthfeel on this one. The body is sticky and oily, a buttery chew is discernible and the whole package is syrupy but not over the top in this regard. Less boozy than expected, particularly when you consider than some other Lagunitas brews do not shy away from alcohol aromatics (e.g., the Imperial Stout). Finish is wet and juicy, with some grass flavors apparent along with an earthy spice. Sweet but still capable of inducing some eye-watering hop heroics. Unique brew and very tasty. I love the Lagunitas website descriptor ""Imperial Mild"". Indeed.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 08, 2014"

4.13,1.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a deep, rich amber color, with a thick, foamy, rocky head that clings to the lip of the glass. The aroma is a bright, semi-sweet combination of citrus and pine that is bold but not overly assertive. The flavor is much more aggressive, though, with a potent, resinous pine forest hop character that is only mildly countered by a bready malt sweetness. The sticky, resinous, full mouthfeel becomes weighty after a while. Overall, this is a bold, hop-dominant IIPA/Strong Ale that is quite nice in a single glass but might be too much for me to enjoy multiple servings at once.","devilben02","Oct 31, 2013"

A solid strong ale. Excellent value at only $9.99 a SIX pack. Could sell at $10.99 a four pack in today's QE3 economy. Will try to emualte via homebrew.","JasonTaverner","Jul 03, 2013"

4.29,5.4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"O – This beer is awesome. It comes very close to the DIPA side of the spectrum as it is very hop-forward, but the extra sweet malts and spices make it more than that. It is very tasty and definitely drinkable, especially given the ABV. It has a nice, smooth burn from the alcohol and tons of flavor. I highly recommend this one.","BlackBelt5112203","Jun 01, 2013"

Served in a snifter with a finger of white sticky creamy head this beer is a bit murky and amber with plenty of orange highlights. Aromas of hops aplenty. Citrus and herbal. Malt is biscuity with caramel. A marmalade character to this beer. Taste is malty and sweet with a hoppy backdrop that is similar to the aroma with a fair amount of resin. Mouthfeel is a bit slick in the finish and a bit warming. A heavy malt bill that is a bit cloying. Alcohol in the finish but not vapory in the mouth. Overall this is a solid brew that doesn't offend or jump out at me. Nice beer given the high alcohol.","deebo","May 31, 2013"

Pours moderately cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention; that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pine, orange zest, orange rind, pineapple, floral, grass, caramel, and floral earthiness. Excellent aromas with big hop presence and complexity with a fair amount of malt balance. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange rind, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, pine, floral, caramel, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice hop flavor complexity; with a moderate malt balance that does not overpower the hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent hoppy strong ale. Great hop flavor complexity and moderate malt balance; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 29, 2013"

Smells similar to Sucks, but with less of the spicy/pungent hops; this smells like mango and pineapple, with the herbal pungent hop scent only ghosting in at the end. Taste is smooth at first, but quite bitter in the mouth, but the bitterness is washed away by the sweet finish upon swallowing. Then, the bitter aftertaste lingers, begging you to take another sip. This is a complex and incredibly well-balanced beer. The interplay between the flavors is amazing. The mouthfeel is medium, but slick.","BurgeoningBrewhead","May 01, 2013"

I wouldn't be that kind. to me it smells like booze, cantaloupe, and hop oil. there is plenty of caramel malt and a gentle sweetness to the flavor, the hops are generically sweet, and yes, again, its the lagunitas generic yeast (if you've read my reviews of lagunitas, you know how much I harp on their blanket use of a single strain). to me, this is a generic strong ale, arrogantly named, and lacking the complexity and balance of their better offerings. fuller bodied, but not super dense, and carbonated on the relaxed side. im really glad I didn't get more than a single. although I don't hate it, im sort of fed up with this type of beer from this brewery, its obvious they have the skill to take it further, this was a letdown.","StonedTrippin","Apr 24, 2013"

There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

The amount of booze in this beer is sneaky - you can’t even tell that it it’s a high ABV until you’ve had enough sips that the telltale boozy warmth sets in. The flavor is well-balance between hops, bitterness and sweetness and my best guess is this will drink well on a warm or cold day; it strikes me as versatile. I’d also recommend this brew to any craft beer newbies out there because it’s full-flavored with a lot of balance - it’s a great example of a well-done brew.","tastymug","Apr 23, 2013"

Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a tasty brew with a fair amount of complexity and a well-hidden abv.

4.07,0,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"The beer pours a rusty brown-red with a small eggshell white head that fades quickly into a scrim with some big soapy bubbles floating around in it. In body, the beer appears clean of particles with a slight chill haze and a darkness from the thicker malts in the beer. It leaves a lacing network of thin, slippery, and wet dots and strands along the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells like a big old pine tree was shoved into a bowl of pithy grapefruits. A smooth caramel malt with touches of toffee and biscuit sits beneath the huge hops, but really this beer is all about the big old piney bouquet that nearly drips from the nose and does have a touch of dankness to it, as well as some muted tropical fruit smells that blend with the sweet malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely bitter from the hops with a good creamy sweet malt underneath, a light touch of acid, and a big, sweet, shivering punch from the alcohol in this beer. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet grapefruit juice with touches of pineapple and orange, working into resinous pine with big bitter shivers that wriggle over the tongue. The flavor displays sweet toffee and caramel in light splashes throughout the taste as the bitter flavors move in waves across the tongue, but the bitters are the stars of the flavor. Alcohol also adds a slightly cloying sweetness to the tongue, though it is balanced out by the huge bitters of the beer. The finish runs hot with alcohol and piney hops, which is not the most pleasant thing, and does cut back on what had been a very pleasing explosion of flavors. The aftertaste is bitter and slightly medicinal with very faint touches of sweet biscuit and pithy grapefruit on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels just slightly on the heavier side of medium with a creamy and weak carbonation that only provides a slight scrub against the big sweet alcoholic flavors of the beer. The mouth is left with a lovely bitter burn and some acid-neutralizing saliva on the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a nice hoppy American strong ale. Its alcohol is a little out of check, but that is to be expected in the beer style. This beer displays beautiful amounts of hoppiness alongside nice mellowing malts, and that is quite nice. This beer is much more of a sipper than a chugger, but is lovely for the cool nights of early spring. I do wish there was a little more carbonation and a little less alcohol in the taste, but overall this is a good beer. Try it.","Maxwell","Apr 21, 2013"

It seems to be more of an english barleywine to me even with the slight presence of hops. If aged, i could see this thing being a VERY good english barleywine. Ive gotten so used to high alcohol beers being masked by flavors that now that I can feel the warming again, I kinda miss that aspect. Very good brew. Pick it up if you can find it.

The beer is definitely above average for a dipa but I found it oddly lacking in aroma. The color is a clean clear copper, leaves good lacing in the glass. The smell is a mild hops/boozy scent not much malt on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid, with a nice abrasiveness that only a good ipa can provide. Taste is obviously hop forward, resin, slightly boozy with a strong hop bitter finish. Balance is not on this beers agenda. Overall, this is worth a six pack, a nice sipping beer that is served better on the higher side of cellar temperatures. However be warned at close to 10% abv it's likely not a session beer.","bornridiculous","Mar 31, 2013"

4.51,10.8,4.5,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a copper color with white head. A fragrant pine hop smell immediatly hits your nose. The taste is a little more sweet malt forward and not as hoppy as your typical Lagunitas beer, but a nice piney hop flavor and bitterness make this strong ale a perfectly balanced beer and a sure pleaser for any hop head. The 9.7% abv is almost non existent. Very dangerous! I don't think there is a brewer that puts out so many consistent winners like Lagunitas.","mweso2000","Mar 29, 2013"

Taste is amazing, very strong, very hop-forward, but with a crisp malty backbone that keeps it balanced while allowing the hops to rage. Mouthfeel is thick enough for the style, but surprisingly smooth and refreshing. Decent carbonation, extreme drinkability. I love and respect Lagunitas ability to put out interesting and aggressive beers that are instant classics and showcase superb drinkability","BigBarley","Mar 29, 2013"

Let it get nice and warm as the flavor comes out so much better. Just the right balance of hops and malt to make it a great sipper. Alcohol is well hidden if cold, but when you let it warm you will feel it bite your tongue a bit. Beware, have only one or you'll need a lawyer for your DUI. My favorite ale-bar none.

Sweet, Tangy smell, with noticeable hops. A floral, sweet, and creamy front end with a bitter piney aftertaste and some alcohol warming. Very enjoyable, but might be tough to have more than a few due to the hoppiness- and at 9.7%ABV, probably not a wise move anyway. Usually I like to enjoy one beer- and this is a good one that even gets more complex as it warms.","Glibber","Jul 16, 2012"

Fine speckled lacing. Aroma has a toffee toasted malt character with an earthy/citric hop nose going on as well. Big alcohol layers hidden in the sweet and hoppy notes I'm getting. Flavor, has a toasted malt character with sweet sugary notes and alcohol burn going on with a big massive hoppy resinous quality about it, grapefruit and citrus malts burst to blend the flavors into what we are drinking here. Mouthfeel, is medium to full bodied with the high burn of alcohol coming through. Resinous oily hop oils coming on with each sip, still not a bad beer just a bit bigger in alcohol than I typically care for. It stays away from the barleywine zone, but damn fine overall.","WVbeergeek","Jul 04, 2012"

Boozy on the nose as well. Caramel honey sweetness in the aroma as well. First taste hits you with citrus grapefruit hops paired against the sweet caramel malt body. Alcohol taste on the finish. Overall good flavor with nice bold malt sweetness balancing delicate hop flavor. The alcohol isn't as hidden as I'd like. Nice full bodied sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a unique beer, an ""imperial ESB"". The taste is bold and unique. That said its just a little too much, if ABV was reduced to like 8% i could see them making a better version.","ShemRahBoo","Oct 23, 2011"

First whiff.. all hops... ahh this is going to be a good one. Taste wise, nice mouthfeel to it... don't get hit by the hops too much which is a little surprising. Balanced very well, maybe more-so to the malt side. Hops are present, but are very much subdued, especially for the 9.7% ABV. Goes down very smooth and tastes like a 4% ABV type of beer... way too drinkable for 2X beer strength status. I would still prefer an Imperial Red or Brown Shugga but this is another home run for Lagunitas.","oriolesfan4","Oct 17, 2011"

The smell is loaded with toffee, caramel, sugar and some hops. Feel is medium. The taste has more hops than the smell, so I get lots of toffee and caramel with a nice bitter after taste and a pretty decent alcohol burn (this is hotter than some of their other offerings, almost makes it not enjoyable).

The taste is very nice, reminiscant of a very hop-forward barleywine. It's huge in all aspects, there's huge, slightly nutty caramel malts, and huge piney hops with just a bit of citrus aspect. The mouthfeel is full and coating, and the drinkability is fairly good. An enjoyable brew from Lagunitas, for sure, that straddles the line between DIPA and Barleywine.","shand","Jul 16, 2011"

Rich malty aroma, lots of caramel and hints of dee piney hops mixing in, really strong aroma here as it cuts through the air. For a beer over 9 percent it was remarkably smooth and subtle.

Lots of lacing is left behind as it takes its time settling (and I drink it). Smells of citrusy hops, grapefruit, pine, caramel, and brown sugar. Tastes of alcohol, caramel malt, sugar, and citrus. The alcohol is rather overpowering in this one, and isnt masked nearly as well as I'd hoped. Mouth is warmly thinned from the alcohol and carbonation, and finishes relatively smooth. Overall, it lives up the strong ale name, but seemed a little out of balance. I'll probably reach for something else next time, but wouldn't necessarily be disappointed if I was stuck with this.","eclipse54","Jul 13, 2011"
4.13,1.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O- Similar to a american barleywine but instead of caramel or toffee notes it has nutty notes more like a brown ale. It also has a pretty big hop presence. For almost 10% it drinks really easy and i enjoyed it quite a bit.","d4114","Jul 10, 2011"

I really like their IPA and Maximus. But Hairy Eyeball didn't really do it for me. I saw this as another big beer that was had to put into a specific style. But I really liked this beer. Its a beast, and one six pack will floor you with both its flavor and its ABV. Syrupy sweet but still a pretty aggressive hop attack. Lagunitas is simply one of the best breweries in the world, and they are far from overpriced. Try this.","VelvetExtract","Jul 07, 2011"

This beer can shut down evening operations quickly with its hig ABV. The appearance is good! A nice rich Amber with creamy off-white head that is lacing suburbly. The smell has a sweet malt character with hints of pine/earth. The first sip brings a wash of ABV, followed by sweet malt. The ABV numbs the tongue slightly and the sweetness holds on to the pallete. The mouthfeel was down graded just a bit due to the high ABV. Overall its a good beer...reminds me a little of the Brown Shugga that they produce(d), and the sweetness reminds me slightly of Two Brothers Cane & Ebel.","WoodBrew","Jul 07, 2011"

By itself, this is fine after a long night will have just enough of a kick to satisfy hopheads, and differentiate it from Barleywines and other strong styles.","JerzDevl2000","Jul 07, 2011"

3.65,-10.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a red-tinted copper coloring with a foamy, frothy, slim off-white head that settles quickly into a sparse coating of film atop the brew. The aromas are hoppy initially, with a sweet and peppery highlight to them. Further inspection gives off a slight citrus and sweet character, also. Flavors are round and forward, with a moderate wet, fresh hopping, and semisweet caramel tone, and a smokey, almost burnt/charred characteristic. The aftertaste has a grapefruit subtleness to it, with tangy caramel and bitter/drying hops throughout. The finish is a bit awkward, with the drying sensation being balanced off with a creamy and slick feel to it, all of which come crashing to a fairly quick stop at the end. Interesting brew, but a bit on the awkward side at the end, like a bad one-night stand. Sure, it was fun at first, but the ending is never pretty...","GarthDanielson","Jun 28, 2011"

4.18,2.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O - If someone had described this beer to me, I'd have said it wasn't something I'd enjoy.

4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This massive bear of a beer. Pours a brown body with some light head that exudes massive aromas of molasses, pine hops, and summer camp breakfast an open air tree grove. Flavors have more brown sugar and pancake syrup than the nose, but are sufficiently balanced balanced by the hops so that they aren't cloying. Extremely full bodied and as rich and mouth-filling as they come. If you like the flavor of such a heavy beer as much as I do, then this will be your nirvana. Otherwise it's not your cup of tea. I love brews that unabashedly choose to sink or swim. A nice brew to take your time with.","droomyster","Jun 24, 2011"

Pours a deep copper color with a fluffy off white head that dissipates slowly but leaves lots of sticky lace on my glass. Lots of caramelly sweet malt aromas fly north of my glass barely tamed by the spicy pine of the hops. Taste is sweeter than I expected up front there is a ton of sweet malt mostly caramel and toffee. Taste turns earthy and pine bitter about midway through and that flavor lingers into the finish and long after each sip. Thick body, resinous and sticky sweet mouthfeel, moderate level of carbonation. I enjoyed the hell out of this brew. Its a big sweet thick monster of a beer with barely enough hops to keep it from cloying, but for my taste buds it worked.","johnnnniee","Jun 11, 2011"

I was kind of surprised when I looked up the ABV here, because I detected little to no alcohol bite at all. Not too out of the ordinary, but still a nice drink, and I suppose it'll get you hammered pretty fast if you're not careful, since the alcohol is masked so well.

I tried Hairy Eyeball yesterday and I felt like it needed some more hops to really be a great beer, well it seems like they answered my prayers and conjured this baby up. I find most American Strong Ales are either really malty or really hoppy, this beer fell right in the middle and I really liked that, it had great balance when it came to the flavor, neither hops or malts were overpowering and they were combined with great harmony. The alcohol was hidden really nicely and combined with great flavors made for some good drinkability, if I had another one I would drink it, it makes for a nice brew to crack open after a long hot day of yard work. I will be buying this again, in fact now that I just noticed it is a limited release I will be getting a six pack next time I go to the store. If your looking for an American Strong ale that has some great flavors and balance to it this is the beer for you. Great job with this brew Lagunitas, you guys really know what your doing, now I have to see what other beers I can track down from you guys.","StoutHunter","Jun 02, 2011"

That hop character is right up front in the taste. Resinous tones along with some darker fruits from the malt and hop combination. The malt body shows through with a bready and dark malt characters.

I can't say I LOVE it (like most Lagunitas offerings), But I LIKE it and its well done and totally unusual and interesting tasting. Tastes a bit like a more funky Maximus. This won't be an everyday beer ( it's limited anyways) but I am glad to try it and look forward to finishing the 6er!

On the thinner side of medium bodied with light carbonationa and an oily hop feel. Flavors are a nice balance of sweet caramel malt and intense citrus and floral hops. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic heat and a lingering bitter, floral hop aftertaste. Definitely a sipper. Lots of intense aroma and flavor if that's what your looking for.","IronLover","May 12, 2011"

The hop load is balanced out--at least partially, by a smooth, biscuity sweet malt and a belly warming presence of alcohol. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and silky with medium-full body.

The aroma of this beer when first cracking the bottle open and pouring it I could smell some fruits, brown sugar, molasses, and pine. The taste starts out with some brown sugar followed by a spicy peppery taste, than some pine and citrus hops kick in with some sweet fruits in the back. The aftertaste is the bitterness from the hops that stays until the next sip, but the sweetness of the fruit is also still there. Mouthfeel starts out with a smooth feel that ends up with some bite and a dry feel to it. Overall, a very good tasting beer that has a unique taste that is nice when feeling like something different than the norm, and the alcohol will make you feel warm while enjoying this brew. This is a must try beer.","DannyDan","May 05, 2011"

I saw it on the shelf today and was psyched. So here goes: it looks coppery, with a decent, foamy head. The smell is of hops and malts (I guess, that's my go-to when I'm not sure what I smell). The taste is strong, hoppy, and has that bitter goodness that I can't quite describe but really dig. Is this a cross between a barleywine and a DIPA? Strong Ale is very vague...

Even though the hops seem to be in the forefront, I thought the lightly smoked malt taste was a nice addition, coupled with a slight taste of grapes. The smell is mostly with hops in the limelight, maybe a little citrus and grapes as well. All in a good brew by Lagunitas, which has never disappointed me before.

Poured vigorously with little head, very little lacing but resinous hop juiciness is clearly noted sliding all over the glass. Aroma is of some malt sweetness, some alcohol and a ton of goddamned hop goodness. Taste is a touch hot (this cask is quite young and fresh, where the increased heat is balanced out by increased hop freshness). Taste of sweet, caramel malts and all kinds of hop flavors stylin and profilin'. As good as the bottled/kegged version but as usual, just a little something extra on the cask pour. Over the top Lagunitas liquid awesomeness....","KickbacksSteve","Jul 30, 2010"

3.97,-2.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brown, almost reddish clear color with a medium sized white head that goes away quickly. Smell is VERY hoppy with tons of sweetness. A lot of sweet malts and molasses coming through. Maybe even a bit of dark fruit. Smells a lot like a rich imperial IPA though...maybe even borderline American barleywine. The taste is initially sweet sugars (molasses w/dark fruits), followed by hoppy bitterness and some alcohol booziness (once it warms up a bit). The taste is almost exactly as it smells, which is impressive. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, but not a turn off at all. Very full-bodied and delicious. Drinkability is fairly high, and I cannot believe this beer comes in a six pack with such an amazing price (9.99). Lagunitas always has great prices. This is listed as an American Strong Ale, but I would say this could easily pass for an IIPA/Barleywine. Solid brew.","DovaliHops","Jul 28, 2010"

So, your palate and stomach have to be in the mood for the simultaneous taste extremes, which do a very good job of masking the 9.75% alcohol content.

3.96,-2.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Style above reads American Strong Ale, the good people at Lagunitas claim Imperial Mild (whatever that is); all I know is this is a very solid brew. A dense head floats on a deep amber body with great clarity. The nose loses some points for a having a bit too much booze coming through. Aside from the alcohol, hops leave a nice pine quality, which lingers beneath a nice dense malt character. As the beer reaches room temp, the booze is pretty prominent. Lots of doughy malt comes through on the back of the palate. The pine from the nose comes through on the back of the palate with some nice bitterness up front. Slight raisin and plum come through in the mid palate but very faintly. Mouthfeel on this beast really makes it for me: despite the big flavors, the body is relatively clean with a very dry finish (almost akin to what you'd expect from rye beer). The booze on the nose is the only detractor here for drinkability. Lots of great flavor components without the thick, dense body (perhaps a detractor if it were february, but in the summer this is a great big beer).","WOTO97","Jul 22, 2010"

Clear bronzed orange color, red rust tinge, loose, widely spread bubble beads. The nose is locked and loaded to please, juicy pink grapefruit, tangerine and lime citrus, honey, fully ripened peach, apricot, nectarine, pineapple scents, mere brush of caramel, light sweet spiciness, under it all an herbaceous earthiness and mutter of charcoal ash. Full-bodied, that earthiness and tar adds some needed rigidity, the carbonation helps as well by tightening up its game and percolating without fluffiness. At the same time, doesn't lose any of that sweetly ripened pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus nor bountiful peach, apricot, nectarine, pineapple, mango flavors. Here more cocoa and mocha than caramel, drier and powdery. Not suave per se, but manages to work the room completely and then exeunt without anyone noticing but everyone wants to say goodnight before leaving themselves.

Without knowing what I was opening, I was astonished by all characters of this brew. Beginning with its initial nose right from the bottle, I knew it was going to be delectable. After an aggressive pour, the nose really opened up and the hops jumped right out. The reddish color and clear clarity made this brew refreshing just to look at. The balance of the structure and the length that was evident from start to finish also amazed me. It left my palate satisfied but I could not wait for the next sip.

Overall this wasn't terrible complex, but it had a great hoppy scent and taste with nice malt balance. Very crisp and clean, with great body too, and very well hidden alcohol.

The feel is smooth and rich. The hop flavors don't strip away the palate, but they still provide a great lasting bitter pine/grapefruit flavor. The beer looks pretty great, medium red-amber liquid with an off-white head and plenty of lacing. I fear that I may be using appearance to counterbalance my enthusiasm for other categories, but there are some great looking strong ales, on the other hand. A pleasing touch of caramel malt comes through in the aroma, but it's mostly floral/pine hops. The hop flavors and aromas complement each other well. The hop additions were well-chosen. The malt flavor is stronger than I first thought and very good. I was unaware of the abv when I first tried the beer and would have pegged it two or so percent lower if pressed.

Medium to full body with a good balance between hops and malts although the malt sweetness is mild and the hops are the more powerful thing in it. Nice citric and herbal dryness, the taste is good and the mouthfeel has a nice dryness to it in the backend thanks to hop bitterness. Had a bit of creaminess/chewiness to it and I ended up chugging this; had no idea the ABV was that high until I came on this site. Nothing too outstanding but this is still another quality brew from Lagunitas and worth a try by anyone.","clayrock81","Jun 26, 2009"

The initial aroma is a bit faint. Piney, citrusy hops are prominent, with sweet caramel-like undertones. The flavors this beer has are great. It begins with malt flavors of caramel and bread, finishing with crisp hop flavors of lemon peel, grass, and pine. This beer is medium to full-bodied, yet very clean.

It's middle bodied, smooth with fair carbonation, fairly drinkable although I find it a bit more on the ""rhubarb"" side to invite sessioning. I also think it's a bit heavy in the sweetness, almost suggesting cotton candy at times, but it's an enjoyable refreshment, I just don't think I would pound these based on the flavor profile, interesting but not a ""must have"".","Durge","Jun 12, 2009"

This shouldn't be considered a strong ale, this is a perfectly balanced DIPA with an excellent dose of pine and grapefruit for the hop heads built on a beautiful foundation of malt for the true big beer drinkers. This is dangerous might I add, this one drinks like a standard IPA with the alcohol hidden well enough to fool you. I love these creeper beers, you sip and sip until before you know it, the third one catches up and your feeling like you lost track of how many brews you really had.

Damn, this beer is spooky drinkable for being over 9%... This beer is big, but in the most restrained kind of way, the malts get larger and more coating to the tongue as the beer warms, the sweetness (which is rather quite mild) intensifies slightly also.

A light, white 1 finger head rests atop. Another DIPA diversion would be the sweet malty aroma first, then followed by the hops. This comes through in the taste too, as it is quite bitter, but with a strong sweet counter flavor. Bitterness holds over in the mouthfeel, as well, but still a rather thick brew, with a syrupy sweetness. In the end, a very good beer, but in my opinion, somewhat unclassifiable.

The flavor is one big continuous blast of hops, hugely citrusy and resinous... the sweet malt only comes through if you concentrate on it. Very bitter and dry in the finish. At less than 9 bucks a 6 pack, a downright bargain for uberhoppy beers.","allengarvin","Apr 05, 2009"

A continous release of tiny carbonation bubbles makes this an attractive beer. Has a heavily hop aroma of pine and grapefruit. I also detect something like sulfer. I don't know where that is coming from. The hops dominate the flavor as well. Mostly pine flavored. Very bitter overall. Not much comes from the malt which this needs to balance things out. Has a nice body with a soft texture dispite the extreme bitterness. Carbonation is just enough to lift the body. Another very one dimensional beer from the West Coast.","morimech","Apr 05, 2009"

I spent the day relaxing at the beach and upon coming back inside the beach house I popped this one open. It was so smooth and refreshing, I think I may now lay down and take a nap. I'm gonna throw a Maximus in the fridge, it would be perfect this evening while enjoying one of west coast Florida's most beautiful sunsets from a chaise lounger on Longboat Key. If I'm not unconscious by then I may just be inclined to drink their newest release Kill Ugly Radio, as I think about my wonderful day, and what else lies ahead during my holiday / birthday weekend at the beach.","tpd975","Aug 31, 2007"
4.04,-0.7,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, I really liked it; I am not sure that it fits in the genera in which it was placed here, but definitely worth a try.","hijjt","Aug 22, 2007"
3.68,-9.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Lagunitas Sneak Release Undercover Investigation Shut-Down Ale pours a dark, reddish copper color with an of white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit milder than I would like, it is primarily hops. There is a strong hop flavor up front that fades to a strong malt flavor toward the end. Pretty decent, worth a try.","Drew966","Aug 18, 2007"
3.81,-6.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Enjoyable brew for sure, but not my favorite DIPA (and I should point out that the label never refers to it as an IPA or Double IPA - only an ""especially bitter ale."" I'm really not even sure it's a DIPA. It shares some characteristics but it's got more malt flavor and less hop flavor than most DIPAs). Definitely worth a try though.","number1bum","Aug 14, 2007"
3.83,-5.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Considering the price tag is a bit (in some cases quite) lower than other DIPA's definitely something I would get again.","shaebs99","Aug 13, 2007"
3.97,-2.5,3.5,4,4,4,4," Perhaps not a classic but a solid, drinkable American Strong for sure.","macster","Aug 12, 2007"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, more hoppy than malty. That is a rare occasion for a DIPA nowadays it seems. Very good. Highly recommended!","bluegrassbrew","Aug 10, 2007"
3.65,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"d- Balanced and warm DIPA that is smooth drinking, the abv is very well-masked, not the hoppiest DIPA, but a solid entrant in this category","Stoneman78","Aug 10, 2007"
3.85,-5.4,4,4,4,4.5,3,"This is a good, solid beer, but it failed to wow me. There's not really anything terribly unique or distinctive about it. It's still very good and pretty cheap. I may get it again if the mood strikes me. Recommended.","vtfan77","Aug 09, 2007"
4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head over the clear coppery amber brew. Head lasts well, with tons of sticky lace froth. Aroma is fresh citrusy hops with twinges of pine as well. Taste is ample maltiness to start, which is quickly balanced and overpowered a bit by the dominant hops flavor. Particularly the pine lingers, and there is warming after toughts as well. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly due to the strength of hops character, but this one remains plenty drinkable.","ppoitras","Aug 05, 2007"
4.17,2.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This is a very accomplished and polished Double IPA and a nice spin on a style that many believe has just one note.","Shaw","Aug 04, 2007"
3.9,-4.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Characteristically, it appears very much like a red: deep amber in color with a finger head that laces quite nicely. There's a lot more malt than your traditional DIPA. There's plenty of hops there too, seems like it should be a strong ale. Again fuck it, it's a good beer. Enjoy one.","sloejams","Aug 03, 2007"
3.58,-12,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: kind of a slow sipping beer here as the alcohol is high and the bitterness is bold. Definitely worth giving this a shot.","Gavage","Aug 01, 2007"
3.97,-2.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"For $3.99 per 22oz bottle, you can't go wrong with Lagunitas.","TurdFurgison","Jul 29, 2007"
3.91,-3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Picked this up at Casanova's in Wisconsin-if it's a DIPA I must try it. This was a tasty beer, but reminds me more of a barleywine--more sweetness and maltiness than many DIPAs but quite good.","Mdog","Jul 29, 2007"
3.83,-5.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I am personally a fan dark beers, the muddier the better. I do enjoy this beer a great deal, I recommend a try.","andrewm190","Jul 27, 2007"

3.98,-2.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"22 oz bottle. Pours a clear dark copper with a beige head. The aroma contains a moderate amount of nice floral hops. The first sip is a little sweet, however it contains a solid caramel malt backbone that quickly turns to hops and finishes with a good strong hop flavor. Grapefruit, pine, and earthy hops carry through to the finish. The pine and grapefruit flavor lingers in the aftertaste for quite awhile. The 9.28% abv is well disguised beneath the hops. This beer exhibits a Medium body with moderate carbonation and could pack a wallop if too many are consumed.","jclzony","Jul 24, 2007"

4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I have recently enjoyed kicking off the night of sampling different beers with one or two of these bombers. Sure there is a decent amount of alcohol in it but the complex taste of this release allows the average Beer Advocate enthusiast to savor the beer and keep from downing it too quick. At only $3.99 a bomber - Lagunitas continually impresses me with their outstanding and consistent releases.","jdoncbus","Jul 20, 2007"
