It's okay, but there are many better options, especially at this price point...IMO.  Strong flavors aren't enough to be great.  Try one to see if you disagree...","Jmc181","Saturday at 05:21 PM"

4.78,12.2,4.75,4.25,5,4.75,5,"The ""Double Bastard"" name might have one expecting an even more challenging version of the classic Arrogant Bastard Ale, but this was quite the opposite for me... This has many of the same qualities that make AB so great, but presented in a more 'refined' way.  Mind you, this is still a HUGE ale, not for the faint of heart, but it's not as brashly aggressive as it's sibling.  A remarkable example of craft brewing, and something every ale connoisseur should try.","m_hall","Mar 22, 2015"

A tad sharp in the finish, but what do you expect for a beer that is 7 years old?  I would have this one with something that stands up to it well like aged cheddar.   Overall, a very enjoyable beer.

4.34,1.9,3.75,4,4.5,5,4.25,"Overall: A nice hearty ale. I had this about a year after the bottling date, but it was still delicious. Good balance between yeast, malt, and hops (mostly just providing bitterness at this point). I agree 100% with a lot of the reviews: this is incredibly smooth and easy to drink for an 11.2% ABV beer. If you liked Arrogant Bastard then there is no reason not to try this one; it really is appropriately named.","SensorySupernova","Mar 12, 2015"

Super flavorful, super complex, this Bastard is much more well-rounded than I thought it would be: the huge flavors really marry together well and the booze is ridiculously well integrated. The musty fruitiness of this beer almost reminds me of a Belgian quad. A bit sweeter than I'd prefer, this is still one hell of a brew by Stone, I'm impressed (and a little buzzed).","Redneckwine","Dec 23, 2014"

I haven't had it cellared but when fresh there is an overwhelming hop bitterness and flavor that is enjoyable.  The hoppiness helps to balance the high alcohol content.  I personally find this to have a real ""old-school"" hop flavor.  A lot of earth and pine notes as opposed to something like Enjoy by IPA.","Tuck_leepulin","Dec 22, 2014"

4.2,-1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; 2013 vintage, bottled on 9/16/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome strong ale style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 21, 2014"

Definitely a sipper.","amsguitarist","Nov 26, 2014"

I finished it, and certainly preferred the fresh version, but it was more a chore and duty than a real pleasure.

Not for the faint of heart, but a damn good place to look for those seeking out a swift kick to the palette.","dXyre","Aug 28, 2014"

The smell had a lot of malt with almost a roasted smell, but also some hops and grapefruit. The taste was incredibly smooth with hints of nuts and bananas in a nice thick malt overtone. A very thick beer with a lot of amazing flavors. I would wholeheartedly recommend picking this one up.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 03, 2014"

Beer is darker than the fresh stuff. Smells and tastes way boozier too. Apples and fruit. Hops are well hidden because of this which I don't necessarily like, but it's interesting. Like 120 min but not as pungent. Intriguing.","fgmiele","May 03, 2014"

It tastes very smooth with more of the caramely, bready malts, some alcohol heat, cherries, raisins, and figs, with burnt toast and roasted malt on the finish that imparts no astringency. Hop flavors or hop bitterness are mostly missing from this aged version: if anything I get a faint citrus taste, but it pales in comparison to the malt presence. The beer has a creamy, thick mouthfeel and despite the initial taste of alcohol, it's dangerously quaffable at 11.2 percent because you get none of that alcohol at the back end.","itsscience","Apr 27, 2014"

Like Stone’s Ruination IPA, I found this a bit too much, but at the same time I really enjoyed sipping this over a two hour period. Not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure.","brutusmuktuk","Feb 15, 2014"

Poured with a thick off-white foam that is fed by a lazy, but steady stream of bubbles from the depths of the glass. The thick, rich cap leaves sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Citrus pineapple aroma up front with undeniable booziness in tow. Intense sweet caramel malty aromas follow with pine hop aromas deep in the background. Full bodied and sticky sweet, with an incredible, delicate, creamy smooth feel. Caramel malt flavors barrel right down the middle with pineapple hop bitterness around the edges that transition to pine hop flavors from the middle to the end. The boozy heat hides beneath the hop bitterness up front but slowly intensifies through the middle to the end. Finishes with a soft, slightly dry feel with lingering pine hop bitterness and lots of boozy heat. This beer is a force that lives up to its name.","IronLover","Jan 09, 2014"

Not sure how you could make the beer look any better.  The smell, as good as it gets.  It is a wonderful mix of a lot of malt and the citrus of an IPA, balanced so great neither stands out but both are noticeable.  There is also some maybe dark cherry that is more background.  Again, not sure what else I could ask for.  The taste is also excellent, very smooth malt up front, super tasty.  But there is a late bitter that lingers in the back of the mouth.  It is the first thing that I did not care for in the beer.  You do not notice the alcohol, possibly that is because of the bitter.  Pretty creamy with a lingering sweetness on the lips that I really liked.  Overall, an outstanding beer with only the overwhelming late bitter holding it back.","JamieDuncan","Dec 16, 2013"

Aromas were heavy on malts, spices, grapes, and caramel. Great, powerful punch. The beer taste was rich in a sugary blast that was not too overpowering. The flavors were a mix of toffee, caramel, vanilla, and some citrus. Really good mouthfeel; a great balance of a creamy texture mixed with solid carbonation.

Aromas of pine resin and grapefruit pith atop brown sugary caramel and hints of cheery and toffee. The flavor is heavy on the pine, resin and brown sugar. Slight warming alcohol warns of the abv. Caramel, toffee, light plum and prune round out the flavor. Assertive hop bitterness but never harsh. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick almost syrupy mouthfeel.

There's too many alcohol notes for my taste. It's still fun to drink. I will say it starts off rough around the edges, but it comes together the more you drink it. It's well crafted though, just like all of Stone's beers. I absolutely understand the appeal. This beer is a good one to throw in the cellar. I might re-review this one with an aged bottle in the future.","BB1313","Nov 17, 2013"

It truly reminds me of a cross between a quadrupel and a bourbon ale. It drinks very slowly, this is the kind of beer you'd be best sipping, to take in all it has to offer without getting your teeth knocked out. Isn't overly powerful with alcohol, but you know its there. It's 11.2%, so it is definitely there. The bottle says, ""It is unequivocally certain that your feeble palate is grossly inadequate and thus undeserving of its liquid glory, and it may be right, for now. I am a fan of Arrogant Bastard, though the Double Bastard may be a little much for me this time around. Maybe I should warm up a little next time before getting my posterior handed to me....

4.81,12.9,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"From my tasting notes on a 2012 bottle: The Double Bastard poured a deep amber ruby color with a tan head that produce significant lacing. The aroma is a boozy malt with citrus and floral hops coming from everywhere. The taste was incredible. Thick and syrupy malt at the front with plenty of bitter hops to balance it out in the end. It is a unique brew with a heaviness and maltiness to be a barley wine but loads of hops to keep it directly on the Stone Brewing map. The Double Bastard was bracingly bitter but boozy and smooth all in one bastardly package. What a great beer.","brurevu","Sep 06, 2013"

3.91,-8.2,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"22oz bottle. 2012 Edition. Pour a deep coppery amber with a frothy off-white head. Retains with some fizzy ringing around the edges of the glass. The aroma smells of floral and citric hops, dark roast and a combination of malt and alcohol sweetness. It’s full in the nose, with the hops and malt making an equal push. The taste is similar but even more aggressive, with roast and hop bitterness really hitting the tongue hard. Toffee sweetness comes in strong off the sides, helping to balance things. The finish on this is tough though, with a burnt and bitter feel that lingers. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a good bit of alcohol sweetness mixed in. It’s not overly stinging but will definitely warm your face up a bit. Arrogant Bastard to the extreme indeed, this packs a wallop in the flavor and alcohol departments yet still remains surprisingly accessible. A winner every year.","Kegatron","Aug 05, 2013"

Poured like a strong ale with a solid whiff of resinous hops and that signature “Stone Smell”. Flavor is on point with a strong ale with the dominant flavors being sweet malts (bready and biscuit like), sugared plums, raisin, dates, and a finish of light pine cone. Age has mellowed this out nicely and it was a real treat to try it.","taylor714914","Jun 18, 2013"

4.39,3.1,4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: Drinking a beer such as Double Bastard encourages me to develop my palate even further; moreover, it would be doubly important just to comprehend what I just consumed. Those with the most sophisticated tastes for alcohol will ultimately enjoy Double Bastard the most. Yet, even after reading the vociferous screed against the mainstream beer shysters, I firmly believe that any beer connoisseur should invest in a bottle of Double Bastard to sip with like-minded friends over good food and great conversation. They say the devil is in the details: if the Devil is this complex, one may wonder if the red incubus is simply just misunderstood.","ShreddedThumb","Jun 16, 2013"

Clear dark orange with visible carbonation and a thick fluffy white head that sticks around for a long time, leaving lots of lacing. Smell is fruity and floral hops, with a strong malt/alcohol backbone underneath it. Taste is actually a bit smoother than I recall the regular Arrogant Bastard being; it's not as spiky from the hops as the regular. The high alcohol content must smooth it out; it's sweet and malty at the beginning, bittering only at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Bit of alcohol heat, but not as much as you'd expect for 11.2%. Dangerously drinkable.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Apr 28, 2013"
4.36,2.3,4.5,4,4.5,3.75,4.75,"overall: A monster of a beer, this one hits hard. Very strong for a beer, but smooth for an 11% abv. Very balanced, like you would expect from Stone, great full flavor, and you will get a buzz off this one. A lot stronger than the Arrogant Bastard.","Roman5150","Apr 28, 2013"
4.03,-5.4,4,3.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall – Been wanting to try this one for a while. It definitely packs a punch and has a lot of flavour. And even with all the flavour it seems to have a good balance. I imagine that this would be even more powerful fresh, I'd love to see what it's like on tap. I have a 2010 tucked away and it will be interesting to see how it's held up.

Sweet, fruity, and full of herbal, medicinal alcohol, this is definitely a big beer.

For such a strong and bitter beer, it keeps inviting you to drink more and it kept smacking me around with every sip. And yet I savored it despite that strong bitter finish and abuse of my palate. It reminds me a bit of the Stone Ruination ale for what it's doing to my tongue right now. Drinkability is good, and I have a feeling I'm going to regret it later. But....that strong bitterness I could see as a love it or hate it feeling early on in the beer. Either you embrace it and succumb to the domination of the bitterness with this beer, or you reject it early on and find something else to drink. I chose to take it all in, but I can see myself also on another occasion saying no and stopping early on. I think the only weak spot with this beer is that the aroma is weak. Otherwise its well crafted and worth a try. See if you can hold up to the onslaught and succumb to it - I'm glad I tried it and I suspect I would take up the challenge again.","damndirtyape","Mar 09, 2013"

Taste is surprisingly fruity and hoppy with good caramel character across the middle and citrusy throughout. Sticky but very drinkable mouthfeel. Booze is prominent while not overpowering, though it is very warm in the belly. Aftertaste is pleasantly bitter yet refreshing. A REAL pleasure to drink! Excellent pair with salty or spicy foods, not sweets. DELICIOUS and overall excellence. BRAVO!","jgurley","Feb 19, 2013"

Granted, it has a much higher ABV and a more aggressive hop profile, but I think that sacrifices the quality to a degree of the original Arrogant Bastard, which was incredible. This is a good beer and I would recommend it, but if it comes down to this or Arrogant, pass me the lower ABV version that is more balanced.","TheCondor","Jan 23, 2013"

Head retention is very good, and good sized chunks of lacing dot the glass. The nose features aromas of caramel, booze, pine, and a bit of grapefruit peel. The balance between all those moving parts is wonderful though. The flavor profile leads off with a healthy swirl of caramel, before an aggressive bitterness and a gentle warming alcohol presence set in. The potent hop finish has plenty of pine, and just a bit of grapefruit peel. The body is somewhat sturdy and the carbonation is lively enough to elevate the hops, very solid mouthfeel overall . There's not much more to say about Double Bastard, it's one of the OGs as far as American Strong Ales go, and a great one.","axeman9182","Dec 24, 2012"

There appear to be a moderate amount of tiny bubbles rising within the beer. The head retreats slowly. I pick up aromas of caramel malt and brown bread with citrus type hop aromas. It smells sweet and and a little piney. More of those resinous hop notes come through in the flavor than they did in the nose. The flavor is juicy and malty sweet up front. The piney hop flavors really hammer in the back end and linger in the mouth, giving some nice back end bitterness. I get those caramel notes with that brown bread. Stone tends to do these hoppy beers rather well and like the other Bastards, this beer does not disappoint. The beer is full bodied with a sticky mouthfeel. The beer finishes somewhat dry.

Some woody aroma notes; prodigious hopping imparting some pine; caramel sweetness and ripe fruit also, with a slight fuel note. Very complex, multidimensional aroma overall. Bitterness hits the tongue first, not surprising for a Stone brew. Malt sweetness follows, though much more subdued from my memory of last year's release; have to assume that one had aged more. Sweet raisin, fig notes more prominent as it warms. Hop bitterness picks up again toward the finish, lingers for a bit afterwards. This is an awesome brew when young, provided that you don't mind a blast of hops, and will only get better as it mellows out over time.","gr0g","Nov 23, 2012"

On the nose you pick up bready malts, some light faint citrus and grapefruit, caramel, and some spicy toast. Warm and bready with some hop presence, but a muted one. Somewhat sherry like. Rather long finish of pithyness. A strong beer with reasonably well concealed alcohol. A slightly syrupy brew but with decent carbonation to livin' it up. I have had this fresh and with a little age, a little age is the way to go. Fresh this beer is hot, hoppy and well....yucky. But add some time and it mellows and turns into this lovely beer.","pmlondrigan","Aug 29, 2012"

Looks sticky and big. The nose is malty sweet upfront with a definitive caramel malt character. Hints of earthy hops and heat and perhaps even a touch of raisin, though mostly malt. The flavor is rich and bold with the caramel malt sweetness found in the tongue being most prominent. The earthy hop characted provides enough bitterness and flavor to provide a very balanced beer. Very creamy and smooth throughout the beer finishes sticky with a lingering mild bitterness and pleasant sweetness. Very good. Though the alcohol was present in the nose, it's indiscernible in the flavor. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, very drinkable for such a big beer. This is fantastic, a treat, highly recommended.","hopfacebrew","Mar 23, 2012"

When I opened the bottle and poured the beer into a large snifter, the gorgeous and powerful aromas stroke me at once. The beer looked nice and the head was pretty big, it left some remains on the glass afterwards. The smell was big and bold, the smells of a regular am. IPA was there with its tropic fruits, but I also smelled sweeter notes, more of pineapple than grapefruit. When I tasted it, it felt crazy. So much to handle here! It was sweet at first, syrup and honeymelon I would call it. Pretty cool with the hints of melon, it was probably the contrast with the bitter, hoppy finish which created the sensation also. Not superhoppy, but hoppy. The feel was heavy too, you didnt feel much of the alcohol but you felt the heavyness of it all. Maybe a bit extreme and powerful to me, but I still liked it. It felt almost as perverted as California itself.","egohepar","Mar 14, 2012"

Looks nice. Delicious aroma of dark fruit, intense caramel malt and a hint of citrus. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Taste is well integrated citrus, dark fruit, citrus (especially orange) and malt, changing to an astringent and long lasting bitter finish. The start is absolutely well integrated and delicious, but the finish is just too bitter without an herbal balance. This is a 2009 cellared bottle and I note that the astringency of the finish was an issue for me with the fresh bottle. I hope this mellows out in a year or so. This is a delicious beer with a somewhat flawed finish.","LiquidAmber","Mar 03, 2012"

It remains true to its name, taking Arrogant Bastard and kicking it in the gut. Granted, this bottle has aged a bit (three, four months tops), but I was still expecting a much bigger hop presence.

After a few swirls, I'm picking up a strong aroma of juicy citrus, and fat caramel malt. The raisiny, dark fruity character of crystal malt harmonizes with the heavy dosage of American c-hops for an assertively rich, robust flavor. Huge bitterness on the finish. Medium - full bodied, has a perfect amount of carbonation to keep it from being too heavy. Such an enjoyable beer, so smooth for near 11% abv. The balance achieved between massive malt and massive hops is incredible, making this a world class beer in my book.","californiakebab","Jan 23, 2012"

This one is a sweeter, more caramel and toffee forward brew than the younger sibling, and as a result is a little more simple. Lots of sweetness and lots of bitter hops, but not as much nuanced complexity perhaps. Regardless, we really enjoyed this and I’d gladly pick up more if I saw it. Thanks again for sharing Doops.

4.22,-0.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good beer and one potent American Strong Ale. It had a big malty base with more then enough very bitter hops to balance out all those malts, the high amount of bitterness balances out the high amount of sweetness. This isn't the most drinkable beer because of how big and intense it is, but if I wasn't splitting this beer with my brother I think I could take out the whole bottle and it wasn't that boozy for being 10.50%. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was intense and aromatic while still being well balanced, the flavor was also pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the fizzy carbonation. it wasn't that bad, but it was the only flaw I found in this beer, I also wish it had a little better head and retention. I would buy this beer again when looking to mix things up with a big and intense beer, it was also pretty affordable. I would recommend giving this beer a try, if you love being hit over the head with tons of malts and hops then this is the beer for you. I was pretty impressed with this beer and like all the other beers I have tried from Stone this one was also pretty solid and not tame at all, I like Stone's intensity. Now I really need to try Arrogant Bastard, I am sure that a toned down version of this beer will still be pretty intense and good. This is one solid beer and a great choice when I feel like ripping my tastes buds a new one.","StoutHunter","Jan 14, 2012"

Strong yet surprisingly smooth, it keeps you entertained between its exquisite taste and all the time put into the bottle.

Smell is great, but this is too boozy for me. Lots of hops, which I love. The taste is just dominated by alcohol for me. I have had this year's batch on tap before and didn't get it nearly as much. I could barely finish it because the back was pure alcohol. The only reason I gave it the score I did was because I had previously enjoyed it when I was paying less attention (but wouldn't have missed this level of alcohol). I was extremely disappointed, and I'm curious as to why it was so much more boozy than the glass I had on tap. I have one more bomber that I'm going to age for a year or so to see what happens. Arrogant Bastard is a favorite of mine, but the Double just was too much for me this time.

Dark sweet sugared fruits, burnt strawberry jam, rum raisin, caramel and toffee all blend together in the monstrous malty body. American hops balance with a roaring bitterness on the back end of the tongue; grapefruit and lemon peel with a touch of alcohol heat. This beer attacks the tongue and creates a civil war amongst the taste buds. Sweetness tries to override the bitterness but fails. Double bastard pits the two ends of your tongue against eachother with clashing yet complimentary flavors leaving hop resin and malt residue between your gums and teeth. With each sip the beer becomes milder and milder until your tongue becomes accustomed to the fact that this beer is a bastard and bitterness has won.","jtierney89","Nov 29, 2011"

You can still see through to the other side of the glass, in spite of this being a big beer. The nose is nice- big time hops, malt, cherry, orange, with a hint of grass. I don't smell any of the 10.5% alcohol, in spite of this being a new bottle. The taste, thankfully, is a notch up from the nose. Hops, malt, caramel, fruit, grass, and alcohol explode in your mouth- in a good way. This is a big beer in every sense of the word. Feel is is silky and malty, with a definite hop presence as well. Very full bodied, with a hint of dryness on the aftertaste. It's not too dry though, which would take away from this brew. Overall, this is a really great beer- for the style, or for any style. It would be interesting to age a bottle of this.. Maybe if I can leave one in my fridge long enough, I'll find out what that's like. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Nov 26, 2011"

Looks alot like a nice Quad. Smells of strong cherry wood, sweet malts, bready and heavy. Piny, floral, and citrus, hop notes all swirling around, subtle hints of chocolate and lots of brown sugar. The taste has all of the aroma packed into one big punch. Notes of dark fruits and dark sugars also. Finishes with bitter sweet red wine note, that leaves the mouth dry and begging for more. The alcohol is hidden well in both aroma and taste but warms up the chest and belly nicely. Big and heavy on the mouthfeel and body, this beer is aggressive and smooth at the same time, its bold and mellow, its up its down its all around... pretty fucking good!

Color is red with orange notes, head is off white. Smell is pine, grapefruit, hard candy, oranges, and a little grassy. Taste wow I have come along way in a year. Last year this beast almost brought me to my knees and now it is just a great beer, doesn't rip my taste buds apart. Starts with a burst of pine, orange, and then a huge burst of grapefruit and very little booze for the high abv. Body is good size, but not crazy. Carbonation is o.k for the size, wish it had a little more life. This is a great beerand pretty damn drinkable for it's abv. 2010/11 side by side is coming in the next few weeks, can't wait to see the subtle differences.","SawDog505","Nov 12, 2011"

Yes, as a beer critic this beer has some very real flaws. It could be better, but damn it, I love the bastardly ways of Stone. This beer is for this beer lover a complete joy from start to finish. This isn't for the beer drinker who wants balance, subtly, drink ability, or anything like those. This was made for the guys who want a beer to beat them over the head, have more flavors than they can dream of, and that can do it for a VERY reasonable price!","bobhits","Nov 11, 2011"
4.94,16,4,5,5,5,5,"Hazy dark brown ale with copper highlights in the thinner parts of the glass. Thin tan head falls quickly to a thin fillm. Hot, whiskey like nose that clears the sinuses. Malt, dark fruit, burnt cherry pie, caramel blend for a complex and extremely assertive nose. Predominate hop bite in the taste--blistering bitterness with resin. Oily mouthfeel with strong malt, chocolate, raisins, and figs. Love this beer. I can see where some might not like the overly assertive qualities of the beer, but I cherish them. Move up on my all time favorite list and need to acquire some more. Thinking aging might have some very interesting effects as well.","FightingEntropy","Nov 11, 2011"

Anyway, this brew pours a dark amber-rust topped by a finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit zest, caramel, pine resin, toffee, black pepper, and a touch of booze. The taste brings in more of the same, with more pine (which is more toward sap than resin here) and the addition of some mandarin orange syrup for good measure. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a richly textured and generally enjoyable brew. Definitely not for the faintest of hearts.

This pours a brown color with an okay off white head which dissipates down to a thin layer which leaves a lacing. The smell is pretty malts, lots of caramel, toffee, a decent amount of pine hops but less than expected. The feel is thick and creamy. The taste is great, reminds me of an American barely wine.

May not have been a stone beer, but it was surely at Stone. A little over the top for me, but will/can drink it if it's available. Shared with family and friends. It was the last drink of the night and had it with dessert. It was a kick in the stomach for me. After a few sips it just went down too strong. Very bitter. One that will go good with spicy food.

3.94,-7.5,3,4,4,4,4,"D/O: While Arrogant Bastard may have started life as a happy accident on the part of Steve Wagner, this beer obviously tries hard to be as big and as bitter as possible. It packs barleywine-scale malt with a bittering hop profile of such immensity as seen in few other beers. Perhaps most impressively, it is even able to give a nod to balance amidst all of its extreme-ness. Acidity never becomes an issue, staying passive and allowing the layered malt qualities to develop. While the rare oaked version of this beer from 2006 is legendary in my personal estimation, the standard is pleasurable in its own right--and my personal favorite of Stone's big and well-distributed seasonal beers.","beagle75","Jun 17, 2011"

Mouthfeel is full till it's spillin, but damn, it is easy to drink! I like this better than regular bastard, easily. I could see this aging well, but I like it rough and leafy right now.

The mouthfeel is medium and seems just right for this brew. The first sip reveals bitter hops up front which give way to a complex variety of fruits,both citrus and dark fruits and this beer does a great job balancing all of the flavors. The taste does not have the sweetness that the smell implies,there is deep bitterness that runs through this beer but somehow a slight sweetness remains on the tongue.

I had it one to two months after purchase. Very hazy brown-red with what appears to be lots of particulates. Thin head with moderate retention and no lace. Big caramel aroma. Yes it is hoppy, but there's lots of sugar there, too. Caramel, molasses, raisins, and a good amount of alcohol. The alcohol is definitely there. Not nearly as hidden as the draft version. Medium to medium-heavy body with a moderately tingly mouthfeel.","LittleDon","May 28, 2011"

Taste is suprisingly mild. Very ""wet"" mouthfeel, medium bodied. the hops are strongly bitter in the finish, but up front, the beer is a bit weak for a double. Although, as it warmed, the beer became much more balanced and the hops began to be noticed more immediately, and semi-sweet malts started to come out of hiding.

I now see why the Basartd was so malty as I wasn't familiar with this one. I really think that this beer will age nicely, so I will probably pick up a few extra and put them back for at least 4-5 years before I give them a try again. The bittering hops are reserved enough that I think that they won't fight the aging and that this beer will turn ""Velvety"" like North Coast Old Stock does.

Huge robust burnt caramel and dark fruit with sweet sugars and nice balanced hoppy bitterness. Alcohol warms as it goes down but is incredibly smooth.

Great smooth start of sweet plum, raisin, orange, chocolate, and then the sour hits you with pine, lime, grapefruit, more grapefruit, and lemon peel. This is what beer should be. Mouthfeel is rich, smooth, and full, although the alcohol does have a bit of a drying effect on the back of my tongue.

I can taste the roasted malt, a wee bit of the dark fruit (fig/plum), and slight caramel hiding. The earthy hops appear but add only a small bit of bitterness... just enough to help balance. Booze is present but not overwhelming. This ale is full bodied with medium carbonation. The slightly dry finish surprised me but it could be the hops playing tricks with my palette.

Sweet caramel and delicious dark fruits in the 09 that are not as ""in your face"" as the 10. The tastes are similar, but have some distinctions. The 10 is definitely more boozy. The alcohol in the 09 has blended nicely with the malt and hops to make somewhat of a hoppy barleywine taste. Almost like a bolder Sierra Bigfoot. The 10 is quite hot with more hoppiness lingering than the 09. Mouthfeel is similar on the two, but drinkability seems to be easier on the aged one.

Nose is sweet and malty but not so rich as to be syrupy. A little nutty but mainly it just smells like a massive beer. Very nice mouthfeel for such a big beer. Full bodied but the carbonation doesn't let it sit too heavy on the palate. For a beer with no evidence of hops on the nose it is surprisingly bitter on the palate. A malty sweetness comes on smooth and is balanced out by a mouthful of resiny hops. The finish is hoppy but not overly so. The malt balances quite well here so the finish is light, long, and very enjoyable. Not as clean a finish as the Lucky Bastard but similar in character.

Double bastard leaves a significant amount of lacing on the glass. The beer has a great scent of hops with a slight grapefruit note and a nice underlying medium malt note that helps to counter the hop intensity a bit. Double Bastards taste nearly precisely matches the scent but there is a slight alcohol sting that kicks it way through just to remind you that it is a strong ale.

This beer is awesome, you can taste the grapefruit, lemon, orange of the huge hops but is off-set by a nice caramel toffee malt. This beer has a sticky mouthfeel with a resiney aftertaste.

Slight alcohol warm does a nice job lifting the hop flavors. Lots of pine and wood flavors going on. Slight notes of caramel maltiness. Very chewy hop aftertaste. It's like a pine tree was left behind and I'm chewing its bark. I'm glad there's not thick, sugary aftertaste, that was my fear of how this beer would finish. Score. This is more than less what I had expected from this beer. Certainly not for the faint of heart. A person can easily finish a bomber of this, but then I'd call it a night.

It had a light feel on the palate with mild carboation. Overall this brew really seemed to mellow out with the aging. Everything was nice and smooth.

It is too dark for me to see inside the glass, but I can see carbonation bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass. It has a robust malt aroma with hints of toffee and raisin. The flavor has a big malty punch up front and a hop bitterness in the finish that lingers on. There is plenty of sweetness and some alcohol to contend with. I think I can detect tastes of dark fruits, like plum, but it is the malts and alcohol that dominate. It has a medium body that feels thicker due to the thick mouth coat. There isn't much carbonation, as far as I can tell. I wouldn't classify this beer as a sipper, but it also isn't one you want to drink fast. A 22 oz bomber would do any BA nicely.

Full-bodied, the carbonation like a jelly roll, gets everything cascading left and right, for better or worse, it is certainly active in the mouth. Sweet and alcoholic, as if barrel aged. The caramel, molasses, butterscotch not to be denied, coats the palate like a blanket, were it not for the carbonation and the bitterness of the hops it would move into old ale or barleywine territory, even the grapefruit, orange citrus feels reduced.

Pretty drinkable for this high ABV, but one bomber is sufficient. I thought this was nicely balanced, certainly a step up complexity wise from 'regular' Bastard.

This was just too sweet for me. Perhaps I'm not worthy, but I'm going to have to stick with the plain jane Bastard model. Alcohol was pretty well hidden.

I have loved the Arrogant Bastard for many years now and the Double Bastard is just that much better. It pours are golden copper color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is kind of sweet with notes of caramael and cane sugar with a slight bit of citrus from the hops. At first taste the Double Bastard comes across well balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops, but as the beer lingers the hops really start to show through. I get flavors of caramel, dark chocolate, anise and citrus and since this beer is 10.5% ABV the flavors are intense and dominating.","WhatsNewinBooze","Nov 07, 2009"

DB has a very similar appearance, with maybe a little more honey in the body, and a slightly darker and fluffier head. The aroma is malty and pretty hoppy with lots of candied citrus; richer and more balanced than AB. The flavor is similarly balanced with massive malts, citrus hopps and a little alcohol. The way it all blends into one smooth experience really sets it above. All the flavors work well together, over a thick and slightly syrupy body. Lots of intense flavors, and you definitely can't drink a lot of it, but the balance and smoothness hold it all together beautifully.","bulletrain76","May 11, 2009"

Somehow all of these seem to balance out to a surprisingly taste and drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy with some very fine carbonation and warming from the alcohol.

Plenty of supporting maltiness and huge bitterness. Alcohol comes to the fore toward the finish before being subsumed with hop flavor and bitterness. Long after you've finished drinking you'll still taste the lingering hops. Body is quite full with smooth creamy mouthfeel. This one is over the top in all regards.

Lacing is quite impressive as it clings to my Delirium snifter. Slight sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The aroma candy-like with strong notes of caramelized sugars and hop spiciness. A little more subdued than I expected, but pleasant. The taste brings together a sense of IPA meets barleywine in a harmonious blend. The richness of the malts and the sharpness of the hops comes together wonderfully, but not at all unbalanced. Unlike others in this style that lean to heavy towards the hops, this one pulls in multitudes of depth while remaining tethered. The mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I would guess for a beer of this nature and statue. The hoppiness leaves a pleasant dryness to the, otherwise sweet, body. Drinkability is truly lethal on this. At 10.5%, it is tough to realize how strong it is until it is too late. Well done and superbly crafted.","ALESwhatCURESya","Mar 20, 2009"

4.32,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This bottle was transported by car about a week ago and, from the look of it, it hasn't quite settled down yet. There is a murky, reddish-brown hue to it with minute suspended particles that suggest plum puree to me. The head is fleeting but a thin veil remains atop the prune-like nectar. The smell is big hoppy, spirited, caramel, sweet toffee ... very reminiscent of a barleywine. The taste is similarly BIG with layers of caramel, heat in the mouth, sour dark fruit, very long drawn out aftertaste with flashes of bitter, malty liquer, more caramel, more malt. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but, for me, the alcohol remains front and center. The label says, in part, ""not to be wasted on the tentative or weak"" and it makes me wonder where I fit in ... it's almost too much for me. Barleywines have never been my favourite beerstyle although I respect them and, in this case, the 10 per cent ABV is reasonably well kept in check. But make no mistake, a strong ale like this is never to be taken lightly; I've been sipping my half of the big bottle for well over an hour and while I'm appreciating it more as I go along, I'd be loathe to recommend this to a novice. For the experienced beer lover, this pushes the envelope big time and it's a trip you owe yourself: complex, thrilling, entertaining and not soon to be forgotten.","ThatWineGuy","Mar 17, 2009"

It's hoppy but not extremely hoppy which I do like but in this case not extremely hoppy is really good. It has a bit of bitterness to it and overall the taste is great.

The smell is strong and simply put, it is a mix of sweet malts and floral hops that I will dwelve into in the taste. Smooth and creamy is my first impression of this almost full-bodied beer. There are malt notes in the taste like caramel, roasted and maybe even some toasted/burny malts (could be coffee) that mix with a strong dose of citric and floral hops (this is the Stone brewery afterall). It leads to a drying, somewhat tastebud killing, sweet and nutty taste mixed with fruits and the ABV makes itself appreciated on the backend as there is a minor warming, alkie burn as you finish this. Bottom line, this beer encompasses both extreme sweet and roasted malts and bitter hop sensations for a complex beer that at 10.5% ABV gave me a buzz after one bomber (and is dangerous b/c I killed the bomber quick it was so good).","clayrock81","Mar 15, 2009"

Their commitment to making quality beer and letting the customer know about it combined with the sexiest bottle out there makes this a good experience before you even open the bottle. Now, on to the beer. It pours a nice copper color with an off-white head that didn't hang around too long and didn't leave much lacing; coulda been the lighting, but I thought it was a bit hazy also. Smells of alcohol and citrus, kinda sweet in a liquor sort of way. Extremely full mouthfeel, each sip felt like more than it actually was.

The taste is an all out assault on all fronts. Hops pierce the tongue in a million tiny darts of piny floral wonderfulness. Malt rules with a deep caramel and molasses sweetness, backed by an overburnt coffee bitter tang. Some fruity tones balance all and leave you wanting more. After the swallow, the throbbing burn of the hops is matched by the warm glow of the malt sweetness. The alcohol glow is noticeable and welcome. A 10.5abv that drinks like a 6.

Head retention was a bit weak with only some spotty foam and little lacing. Just fantastic complex aromas of balanced malt and hop contributions with notes of dark roasted caramels, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, citrus rinds and spice. Palate was perfect; big, full, round and smooth. Very fine carbonation bubbles keep the beer velvety slick. Flavor is just immense and rich with a nice balance struck with the sweet malts and hoppy bitterness. Flavors start out with notes of sweet dark brown sugar, raisin, caramel and toffee. Gradually slides into a medium - bitter hop contribution with crisp, fresh notes of grapefruit, orange and pine. Alcohol is fairly muscular but not hot or intrusive. Just a FANTASTIC brew in all aspects.","macster","Jan 04, 2009"

Assertively hoppy and spicy characteristics like an imperial IPA, but there's also this dark-fruity, wine-like complexity that reminds me of a strong belgian ale. It's kind of like a hop-head's version of a quad. Very spicy. Pretty damn malty, sweet (brown sugar) and alcoholic, yet surprisingly easy to drink, probably because it's so delicious.

Sticking your nose into glass, and the aroma bursts forth with citrusy and piney hops and sweet caramel maltiness giving it a bit of a cherry smell. Once the beer hits the tongue and slides to the back of my throat, the smacks you with bitter yet nicely citrusy hops.

Oak, malt, and alcohol come next. Absolutely incredible. I feel this beer has a lot of characteristics of a big barleywine in the sense of the body and mouthfeel. To me this is the Barleywine/RIS of the American Strong Ale category.

The aroma is original and awesome, if I could create a flavor of incense or an air freshener I would want this. Very aromatic throwing malts, hops, dark fruits, citrus notes, with a powerful alcohol kick bringing up the rear. Nice pour looks like the local fermented apple cider with a pencil thin head and minimal lacing, but hey it's a strong one so you can't be too upset. Take a sip and it bites you strong and fast a very aggressive mouthfeel with a smoooth subtle burn. Flavor is right on and then some, hoppy enough to combat the huge malt content.

Smelled of big, bold malt overripe fruit, brandy. Flavors are huge and very muscular. Bitter as F and taut. Sharp hops, caramelized sugar, rich caramel, roasted malts, candied fruits, piney hops helps balance an otherwise chaotic beer. Underneath all the flavors is the alcohol esters, clearly they are not fibbing when they call this an American Strong Ale. But it feels like a Barley Wine.

Tasted sweet up front with a bitter malty alcohol taste, caramel as it warmed. Warm alcohol burn is there for sure. Unlike ""Arrogant Bastard Ale"" I feel the heavy ABV here. It did taste better as it warmed and it did warm because I had to drink it slow. I am likely to steer clear of this guy in the future and remain a ""Single Bastard"".

Bitter right up front with heavy malty alcohol flavors. The finish was even more intense with notes of caramel as it warms up. This beer coated the mouth well with a sticky sweet slightly syrupy mouthfeel and extreme alcohol warmth. As big as the alcohol flavors are in this one it is somehow not overpowering.

Taste begins with a little spurt of grapefruit and pineapple before a nice sweetness of caramel, molasses, and brown sugar come into play. Finishes with a nice bittering pine and alcohol warmth. Full in body and low in carbonation, strong and sweet with a good balance and bittering characteristics.

There is little head, but what is there settles to a ring. Big, spicy malty aromas up front followed by some nice orangey citrus and piney hops. This beer has a quite interesting malty flavor profile up front- almost as if there were toasted rice and barley in it. This is followed by a fruity sweetness that is furthr followed by a long bitter citrus flavor and a nice oily, piney hop finish. Mouthfeel is pure and clean but big and with a touch of sweetness. This isn't sticky or cloying at all and is quite balanced by the toasted flavors and the hops. Surprisingly drinkable. Not as harsh and more integrated than many Stone brews.

At first, you just smell hops, raisins, but then later on, the sweet pineapple and piney smells come through. It's awesome. The taste is exceptional: caramel, pineapple, hops. It's a ride.

Lots of citrus hops balance the sweetness well. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Delicious. Full bodied mouthfeel and not overly carbonated which I think suits this beer perfectly.

I am not a fan of sweet beers, and this is not a sweet beer, but its sweetness is a lovely peripheral aspect that doesn't fade into the rest of the beer, nor is it overwhelming.

One time the bag of Mountain Dew syrup had ruptured before we opened the box that contained it. Blackgreen goo dripped out its side and it smelled like the most refreshingly synthetic Mountain Dewiness you could ever imagine, so strong that we were tempting to lick it but we stopped ourselves, knowing that after tasting it regular Mountain Dew would no longer we worth our time.

As the beer warms it becomes more robust but remains smooth and easy to drink. My kind of beer as it's sweet, sticky and highly dry-hopped. The aroma plays a big role with each sip bringing with it the warming effect of the alcohol and all the herbal oils of the piney hops.

Unlike aromas from AB, this one gives off much more malty notes, fruity caramel, estery plums and raisins. Only in the back are resiny hops evident and even then, the candy maltiness reigns. On the palate, it becomes more evident that this should fall into the double IPA catagory as the hops, in their freshness balance quite well with the syrupy malts. Finishes pretty sweet with crystal malts mixing well with darker, perhaps chocolate malts. It really just is a supremely balanced beer for how big it is. I wouldn't put any age on this one, it's like a fresh Bigfoot. How enjoyable this beer is, I'm glad to finally try it.","dreadnatty08","Dec 09, 2007"

The scent of alcohol and pineapple is present as well about mid-chalice. Sugary malt, pine, dark fruit, and a touch of citrus run across my palate. There is a great deal going on with this beer. Rich malted tones and a smoky caramel are the most dominant flavors to me in this beer. I served this beer at cellar temp and still somehow this beer tends to gain more life the warmer it gets. The sweetness of the malt and bitterness of the hops is very well balanced and well made. The taste is in your face the whole time and in no way subtle, but the balance is really a nice surprise. This beer is a very nice sipper and coats the mouth and tongue very well with it's stickiness. After finishing the bomber I don't really want another one right now and I wouldn't drink this beer with a meal most likely. It is very heavy and quite filling. I know the American strong ale category is a bit of made up category to fill a large variety of beers that craft brewers are making, but the flavors on this beer actually reminded me of a good barleywine.All in all great offering.","TheodorHerzl","Nov 28, 2007"

Citrus, caramel, burnt sugar, with lots of hops. Both bitter and sweet at the same time. Absolutely amazing and even better when it warmed up a bit (which was easy to do because of the sheer volume and heavyness of the thing). A very heavy drink in alcohol content, mouthfeel, and flavor. I don't recommend having this with Thanksgiving dinner or any other heavy meal because it is so filling. However, on its own, it is an amazing drink that I will look forward to each year.

Could have been my fault. Smell is very citric, the one that stood out to me was pineapple like. A hint of caramel a small touch of alcohol as well. Taste is incredible, wonderfully complex. Touches of hops, malt, toasted grain, alcohol, and chocolate. A warm feeling is left behind and the first sip will warm your chest in an instance. Low carbonation and a slightly thick mouthfeel and a somewhat oily feeling in the mouth is left behind. Overall this is a great beer and worthy of all of its praises.

A little bit of sticky lace was left behind in the glass. The nose was loaded with strong aromas. Tons of alcohol up front, followed by the hops, sweet malt, rum soaked raisins and cherries, and just a bit of plum. The nose is definitely dominated by alcohol and dark fruits. The flavor is quite extreme as well. Dark fruits, caramel, hops, and maybe a touch of chocolate in there. A nice malt presence as well. Finishes a bit dry, with a smooth ten percent alcohol burn with little carbonation. The alcohol really stands out in this one. Seems pretty well balanced for the beast that it is.

The sweetness dissipates only a little bit at the end; the sweetness sticks around for the most part, along with the hops, which attain some fruity height here. Throughout, the mouthfeel is quite oily with hops in spite of the malty goodness on display. Carbonation is slight.

The brew has a roasted malt backbone, with a grapefruit hoppiness, some dark fruity esters, and an alcohol kick.

Some pine hops as well in the back, smell really starts to come out as it warms for a while/ The taste on this was HUGE. Again as it starts there is the alcohol, which at 10%ABV is unmistaken and pronounced. This must be let to set to truly appresicate the other flavors. Mellows out into a highly hopped strong ale, with a big ddry finish. Huge pine, and candied sweetness. This is a BIG beer with BIG teeth, be forwarned. I goes down nicely enough if you are prepared for it, very dry and beautiful texture, not oily and definatly not thin. Crisp, tough, this will kick your ass. It is highly drinkable, at lest for me.

It has light, slowly rising carbonation and a light tan head that reduces to a thin layer. The bouquet is rich and malty with lots of hops for balance. There are notes of bready/biscuity, caramelly, toasted, and nutty malts, chocolate?, pineapple, citrus, pine, strawberry?, cherry?, raspberry?, apricot, and some vinous and woody notes. The body is thick, with a deep malt body and a huge hop presence. There are piney/citric, grapefruit, pineapple, and green/leafy hops with biscuity/toasty, caramelly? malts and notes of apple or currant along with some spicy alcoholic heat. The body is full and drying, quite smooth, with light carbonation and a very long finish. Overall this is quite a heady brew - one of the maltiest beers there is - yet is quite drinkable. This is still a bit young though, and I've got both the '04 and '05 to see how the aging affects this brew. I'm guessing that the flavors would meld wonderfully and that the alcohol would cool down, making for an even better beer.

The sweet maltiness isn't totally covered up, and it shines through towards the end. Hints of alcohol pop up a bit as it warms, but its mostly hidden by the massive hop and malt flavor.

The tangy citrusy hops dominate after the sweetness fades- huge and oily slick while at the same time making this heavy brew light tasting and refreshing. Despite the solvent fumes, the alcohol presence seems like a muted finely aged liqueur. A slight burn but nothing to hint at the high ABV.

The head produced was a tan cream color, thick and creamy that had a good last time and slowly diminished in a chunky fashion to a fine skim on the edges, and while being consumed it formed slowly on the sides a dingy delicate/intricate lace. The aromas that formed from the glass were of molasses, deep spices, burnt sugars, sweet malts, piney hops, and a slight warmth of alcohol. All fairly consistent throughout the entire bottle, becoming more prominent as beer warmed. The tastes that danced across my tongue were consistent with the aromas. Flavors of pine tree and floral hops, several dark fruits (apples, berries, etc) all soaked in alcohol, warming alcohol notes, sweet malts, burnt sugars and molasses, wood tones all throughout and as the sip ended a combination of sweetness and hops trailed off and an aftertaste of hops only remained.

Heavier side of medium bodied and a medium amount of carbonation. Overall, good beer for sure, but I can't help but think a different hop choice could make this so much better.

Palate is a rich and complex blend of malty sweetness, dark fruit, and brown sugar up front. A subtle hoppy bitterness emerges before the swallow and lingers long into the aftertaste, balancing things out a bit. Notes of figs and prunes come through on the finish. Body is velvety smooth, a great complement to the rich intermingling of flavors in the palate.

It tastes very smooth and quite delectable. Sweet malt flavor with mild hints of roasted malt mixed with caramel malts. Great after taste mild dry hop finish with buttery tones. Butterscotch and a slight fruit flavoring . Figs and or plum come to mind. Great body, very smooth, and drinkable for being 10%ABV.

Rich sweet malts and caramel are up front and quickly intermingle with strong alcohol presence, a good size, slightly piney, dry bitterness in the finish and then an alcohol warmth in the throat. Great strong ale, the alcohol is definitely a presence but is not too strong to enjoy, but rather balanced by the large malt bill, and the hops are also large and create a nice finish.

The aroma was multilayered malts with vanilla, hazelnut, toffee, and chocolate. Not many hops were detectable using the nose. The taste was amazingly complex as well. Flavors of chocolate, oak, black pepper, raisins, and mandarin orange were found in each sip. The mouthfeel however was a little pricklier than I remembered. Radiating warmth was felt in the belly, letting the alcoholic strength numb away all angst about letting this sit in a warmer than recommended cellaring closet.

I get the flavors of caramel, grapefruit, molasses, alcohol, and even chocolate. It is just a wonderfully intense and delicous brew. The one criticism, and this is in the context of it being one of my favorite American beers, is that, while each sip indivually goes down very smoothly, it is difficult to keep drinking this for a while.

Wonderful aromas of fruity and piney hops and smooth roasted malts. The taste is. Oh wow, its big and delicious! Huge flavors of piney hops and caramel malts, but what sets apart from the other and makes it superior is the excellent balance. It has a full body, oily, slightly syrupy texture and soft carbonation. Perfect mouthfeel for the big-beer experience. This beer goes down wickedly easy for as strong as it is. Its liquid crack.

Pours a crystal clear, beautiful dark cherry color with full finger foamy off white head that slowly gave way to moderate lacing. Looks absolutely incredible, very impressive and pleasing to the eye. Aroma is rich with a mixture of a malty sweetness accompanied by a nose stinging burn of alcohol, which is nicely complemented by well balanced hops. Taste is complex, yet to the point with the everpresence of unhidden alcohol, I've had many beers in the 9-10% abv range and none have been this bold in that respect. Not to the point of being overpowering, simply a somewhat constant reminder of it's presence. Flavors of caramel malt and evergreen/pine hops take the lead, with undertones of dried fruit-like sweetness that blends well with the complexity of this brew. Mouthfeel is medium in body, passes quickly and leaves a slick coat in the mouth. Carbonation fairly minimal, matches well with the complex characteristics of this beer. Drinkability high for the smooth, easy yet aggressive stature of this ale, takes a slight hit for higher ABV, wouldn't want to drunken the palate and waste any of this incredible brew.

Fresh the hops are very strong and powerful, but this year old version has mellowed out to where the rich, thick creamy malts are the dominant character. I am not a drinker of whiskeys (or whiskys) but this reminded me of the smoky rich full malts of a late nightcap. The alcohol is definitely there, but not in a bad way.

Aroma & taste are huge caramel malt with an earthy malt sweetness & complexity that is second to none..the big hops are buried under layers upon layers of malt complexity. To be honest, I think this could use a lot more hop character to balance it out, as the malts may be as big as any beer I've sampled. The alcohol is fairly obvious, but it blends in fairly well with the multitude of flavors this bad ass brew throws at you. A very big, bold offering from Stone.","hero27","Jan 08, 2006"

It's very good but a rough, medicinal malt profile ruins it for anything that would make this exceptional. It looks good- deep, dark brick red, good size head for the high abv. Pine, floral and grapefruit hops in front of caramel and toffee malts make up the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, good carbonation and it's a lot easier to drink then it should be.

Some caramel malt sweet and way beneath is alcohol. Taste is potent hops that make the malt seem like soured caramel. Hops are co-humulone rough and bitterness is high. The hop flavor is woody and dry. Oranges. Pine and pith. Malt is way beneath and comes across as powery caramel with a hint of nutty that borders on chocolate. The aftertaste is cottony with an alcoholic umph that further denegrates the malt flavor. With searching, I find an ester array, but I can't identify specifics under the brutality of the hops. As I drink further, the alcohol stands out much stronger and is really wearing. The hops are wearing, this beer is not enjoyable. Yes, I can see this beer as properly being classified as an ASA. It definitely needs aging. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy thick. A nice feature that is hard to concentrate on under the hops and alcohol, which are now coming across as cheap vodka poured into my beer.

Taste to me is just about perfect, smooth for a 10 percenter but still with enough alcohol spiciness to remind you of what you are dealing with. Extremely complex in flavor, every sip you detect something else...citrusy and spicy in the beginning but as it warmed (and me) the malts really started to shine leaving a lip smacking sweetness for an aftertaste. mouthfeel is on the syruppy side and drinkability is somewhat low due to the high ABV and pricetag.

Maple syrup, some citrus fruit, and pine needles are all there in small quantities, but the alcohol makes a bit too much of an appearance in my opinion. It's also got an unpleasant oxidized smell. Taste is interesting, but not up to some of the better barleywines I've had. Everything in the smell makes an appearance, though I can't taste the wet paper oxidized smell at least. Here I can say that if the alcohol was not so apparent, this would be a great beer. Malt and hops are very well balanced. There is a nice piney aftertaste and a nice deep sweet fruity taste. But after that the alcohol overwhelms you, and the aftertaste leaves you thinking you just took a tiny shot of some cheap rum. The mouthfeel is nice, very smooth and medium bodied for a barleywine. Drinkability suffers due to the alcohol, but still isn't bad. Just doesn't have enough flavor to mask the alcohol in my opinion.

Taste is a well balanced blend of very sweet burnt malt, fruit esters, and molasses upfront, followed by an eruption of bitter hops and alcohol washing over. Aside from being strong, the mouthfeel is syrupy, with a residual bittersweet aftertaste; one would expect a dryer finish given all the hops, no? If you can finish the entire bomber, you will feel a slight alcohol warmth. Overall, a quality beer that delivers what the marketing promises.

Sweet caramel malts mingling with bittersweet chocolate; bready, somewhat biscuity malt profile; very sweet overall with a raisiny brandy like alcohol quality. No disappointment in the flavor whatsoever. Citric hops that aren't very evident in the nose hit you first, melding into soft sweet malts. Lots of sweetness: sugary and buttery caramel, raisiny and somewhat nutty. Finishes with a sweet, warming alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, slightly oily. An agressive beer in both flavor an ABV. Seems to be much along the lines of an old ale or stock ale. Very warming and pretty drinkable at a slow pace. What I call a good reading beer.","gimmehead","Jun 04, 2005"

It stays in a nice 1/2 cm frothy top. The beer itself doesn't have much of a smell. As with all of Stone's beers this one has that familiar hop characteristic that reminds me of their Barleywine. There is a syrupy sweet taste with hints of maple, burnt wood, sugar, fruit, apple . There is a distinct sweetness to this beer that makes it very attractive. It's light in your mouth, but still feels heavy to the tounge if that makes any sense. It's not hard to drink, especially if you've had a beer or two before it.

An alcohol presence is also there. This definitely tastes like the big brother of arrogant bastard. Taste is spicy alcohol and sweet, thick, heavy caramel. A piney hop bitterness shows itself toward the end. Very thick in the mouth, the alcohol presence prevents this one from being very drinkable. Not a bad barey wine, but not one of my favorites.

There is no doubt on the beauty of its dark color and nose of bubblegum, rum and malt. The taste remains a bit too hot with alcohol dominating the beautiful rich body and silky, resiny hops. Warming does not help which may mean a year or two may bring it all into balance. This is an intense experience of barley wine madness in the best and worst sense.

It poured out deep amber with a thick head. I noticed hints of all sorts of sweetness, from different kinda of fruit to chocolate. However, what I noticed most was the fact that this beer has muscle. The hops seemed slightly stronger than the malts, but both were overshadowed by the pure power of the alcohol.

Each offers their own particular take on the style, and all three succeed at the same level. But considering i loved the other two brews, i can't at all be dissapointed that i find this one to be at equal level. Maybe not the most hoppy (Bigfoot), or the most malty (Old Horizontal), but possibly the most complex and balanced. I can see why this one rates as highly as it does.

Also, there are sprinklings of spices with lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and something I can't name that has a bit of a kick to it. The alcohol is also very noticable. With the mouthfeel, there is a slight alcohol burn on the tongue.

Bitter hops start and finish the taste in a glorious fashion. In between the hops there is a big full bodied malt taste, lots of sweet caramel and creamy malt. Also a roasted character and a slight hint of nuttiness. Definitely a complex taste. Very full, satisfying mouthfeel. Big and creamy, but broken up by clean citrous hops and warming alcohol.

A good looking brew IMO. Smell is mainly plums or grapes w/ a very slight soy sauce twang to it. My girlfriend actually said she thought of rasberry chocolate a little, due to the malts, and I even got a little bit of hops sprinkled throughout. Taste up front gives a lot of alcohol. As this warmed, however, vanilla caramel tones came through to the forefront of the sip, along with a heavy dose of fruit (plums & grapes) and even a little almond flavor maybe. Bitter swallow and bitter aftertaste that gives the impression of a creamy bitter malt finish (very nice!). The overall feel of this one is a medium-to-full body (more full), w/ a lot of carbonation up front (due to the temperature maybe) w/ a nice smooth swallow and a lot of 10% alcohol burn on the finish!

Quite simply, it tastes damn good, even if it is strong. Furthermore, you can enjoy it over a long period of time, as it's flavor actually betters as the beer warms. It took me 30 minutes to savor 1 bomber of this stuff. I could qute easily do a few if I had purchased more than 1 case.

Ahh fruity and malty hell even smells like some vanilla thrown in the mix. Hops also but not as big as I imagined them being mostly grassey smelling but light pine also coming up. Taste lightly like regular bastard that has been hit with malt steroids. This beer is big on malt, fruity sweet chewy caramel malt at that. Hops are present but not as in your face as regular bastard due to addition of extra malt ofcourse. Taste is big and at 10% you would think some alcohol would be present but it is very well hidden underneath the malty flavor. This is not a beer that begs to be sipped, man this stuff is good enough to drink, as long as you do not have to stand up afterwards. Mouthfeel is big chewy find myself smacking my lips after downing a swallow for some reason. Drinkability is great I bought 6 bottles now I have only 5 :( in my opion it is better then Old Guardian this is one hell of a beer a great barley wine love it almost as much as my Bigfoot and looking back should have rated Bigfoot a 5 across the board.

The complexity comes at you in levels, and challenges the drinker as promised by the blurb on the back of the bottle. Out front sweetness is followed by a bitter hoppy kick contrasted with a sturdy malty backbone. Getting a lot of syrupy molases sort of tastes and the contrast of that to the bitterness is fricken great. A fun beer to drink for sure. Super slick smoothness in the mouth.

The head drops quickly to a bubbly ring leaving a nice lacing around the glass. Quite the strong aroma on this one, with plenty of sweet malts, earthy hops, fruits and a touch of alcohol. This one definitely brings a big taste to the plate with a sweet fruity malt upfront that settles into a bitter hop bite. This one has a similar taste to arrogant bastard but upped several notches and a few more complexities are thrown in. A very complex tasting beer indeed, maybe having a 3 liter at one sitting can help unravel some of these complexities. Mouthfeel is amazing, full and creamy with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is perfect, there is only slight alcohol tastes and scents so that never slows the consumption. This is a near perfect beer in my opinion and I look forward to this years release as this was my last bottle.

Although it has taken me some time to get used to Stone's Brews (at first they were all one-dimensional over-hopped monsters), I am now starting to get more comfortable with what they are, 'specially their pungent IPA (which is my favorite).

Head is resilient, long-lasting, and laces amazingly, with solid foam being left down the side as the head recedes. Aroma is the solid, sweet scent common to most strong ales, tending towards a bit of fruitiness if one can bypass the obvious alcohol presence. Taste is, as expected sweetly malty, but well contrasted by the strong hops presence, which almost seem to provide a grainy feel to the tongue, they are so strongly present. Mouthfeel is great for the style, and drinkability is good, although I fear eventually the malt sweetness might get a bit tiring. An excellent strong ale.","ppoitras","Jul 01, 2004"

The malt is so thick you can nearly chew it and is so well-balanced by the hops, which grab you hard, but don't over do it as you might think.

It poured a clear dark ruby color, with a thick foamy tan head. The smell was heavy on the sweety syrupy hops, with other sweet smells such as honey, pine, and maple sap in there as well. The taste is a huge sweet hoppiness just as the smell would indicate. There are some more subtle hints in there, with some earthy tones barely noticible, but really most of the flavors are masked by the wonderful hoppiness.

There's also an earthy/peaty aspect in there, but of course, besides alcohol, the bold hops dominate. In mouth, there's evidently intense hoppy grapefruit juice, caramel, crystal malt and still a moderate alcohol taste. Finish is huge, monstruously bitter, mouth-grabbing, memorable for a while. Mouthfeel is rather thick, closing onto syrup. Definitely worth a try to experiment it, but masochism as they say, is to be consumed in moderate amount.

In keeping with its Arrogance, it's a blatant exercise in extremes. But somehow, I find this version a bit more drinkable than Arrogant Bastard -- more balance being the key, I think. Citric fruit and pine sap bitterness mingle well with the fruity, estery flavors up front, and it provides a great transition to the finish.

Starts off with a thick, sappy malt syrup flavor then follows with an acidic taste with some sweetness (grapefruit w/sugar added). Alcohol comes in strong and throws me back.

This is pure pleasure and make no mistake you will pay by nights end. Pours a deep firey tawny amber brown, settles a bit darker in the chalice glowing of newly created lava from the earths crust as it procedes to grow a tall, firmly thickened, whipped froth of tannish wonder. Fades ever so slowly like a dieing fire to a thin ring and a hazy skim across the liquid leaving massive sticking amounts of webby laced sheets. Aroma appears stronger then smoke, more like heat from an oven with mounting sweet caramel, lightly burnt, darkened tropical passion fruits, earthy crispness of deep woods pineyness. Malts are king in this world of aroma, ruling with a mighty pitch fork that pokes at the hops as if to say ""Ha, ha... Try to take my throne you measly weed"". Taste is where it leads you down the path of whats about to become a head full of everything thats tempting. Complexing malts are forest fire big, tons of great semi sweet caramel, thick and thicker yet, flowing in and out of scorched and deeply ripe dark fruityness, pineapple, mango, plum, and raisins bursting within with a light burntness touching everything. Its calmingly smooth and far to creamy for such a fire to burn, but yet it does, and it builds with a wind of hops thats burning up brush of small dwindling pine, dried leaves, and wood. Incredibly balanced bitterness is deep and crackly over the musculature of the big boned skeleton of malts. Alcohol never makes its presense felt til it finds its way to the head where it smokes out any notions of all before it. You remember liking this thing you enjoyed the next day but are now lurking around like a zombie wondering how in the hell did I survive such a dance with the flames of a devil. F*cking great stuff!! Can't wait to dance again with this dark nectar, but not any time soon, as not to become a devils second hand. I hopefully have learned my lesson. Why did they have to put this in a bomber?

Strong malt flavors as well, more so than the regular Arrogant Bastard. It's amazing to me that this beer is 10% ABV the way it goes down. The alcohol taste is not overpowering, and the fruity hops and malt make it almost unoticable. I wouldn't reccomend trying to finish more than one bomber at a sitting due to the high alcohol content. With it's drinkability though, the taste would allow you to do so. This is a straight up American barleywine with an ass kicking hop profile with malt balance.

The flavour is perfect. It starts out with a huge hop kick and then settles into a nice carmel flavor with a slight bittersweet aftertaste. The taste of pine is there too, but not nearly as much as Arrogant Bastard. As the beer warms, the hop bite becomes more subtle and the warming alchohol and malt flavors come out much more.

Nonetheless, an enticingly attractive brew that screams for one's attention. Resinous, sappy, piney hops dominate the nose, while the lion's share of sweet malt appears to keep the hop notes in check. Grapefruity, piney hops smack the palate around at first, though as the beer warms, a sizeable, lightly toasted malt profile introduces itself, expounding lavishly sweet caramel flavor to the near-dominant flavors that the members of the lupulin family emit. Fresh pineapple notes linger, as well. A touch of alcohol is evident on the finish, but hardly enough to be overly distinguishable. The full, round mouthfeel is viscous, oily and sappy all at once. Drinks quite well for a beer of ten percent ABV, but the effects certainly introduce themselves shortly after the emptying of the bomber. Highly drinkable for its size... hedonistic nectar.","Jon","Nov 14, 2003"

Chewy and resiny that sticks to your mouth like peanut butter. I detect pineapple in the flavors along with a super blend of hops and malt. This is one fantastic brew! I would almost peg it for an Imperial IPA because it has similar qualities to many I've sampled.

4.48,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Clear deep garnet hue, covered by a light beige, dogged, dense head that yields exiguous lace. The aroma is comprised of a dominant buttery toffee and nutty carob combination, contrasted by a balmy, smoky pine wood and herb laced citrus hop nose. Swirling releases heaty ethanol and subtle fruitiness of a bourbon soaked fig character. Surprisingly well rounded and understated in aroma, but certainly ominously appetizing. Transient wash of burnt caramel sweetness incipient in flavor is promptly ensued and complemented by a combination of buttered sweet biscuit, freshly baked brittle and woody, fructose rich dried dates. Bellicose hop presence storms in mid palate, with both barbed bitterness and a deeply sappy, spruce and citrus pith hop flavor emerging concomitantly. This more than adequately tapers malt sweetness, and leaves a static, simplified, yet richly buttery toffee malt presence that mirrors that of the aroma. Full bodied and firmly dextrinous, with a oily, unwhipped heavy cream like viscous mouthfeel. A late resurgence of biscuit couples with the constituent citrus and stately diacetyl, lending a rich, bitter marmalade on singed toast impression. Finishes clean and simply bitter, with a mellow roasted grain and alpha acid extension. Agreeable alcohol warmth surfaces after a deliberation and envelopes the palate, throat and tummy. A truly delicious brew, that's reminescent of their Old Guardian in overall character, but is seemingly more balanced and drinkable. Double Bastard is a deceptively mild mannered strong ale that integrates robust hop character into a malt driven flavor profile. Superlatively drinkable.

Malty sweet, chewy flavors of roasted malt, caramel, malted milkshakes, and all kinds of fruit. A nice, mellow bitterness finishes off the palate very well, preparing the way for the next drink. An ever so slight alcohol note is detectable one drink, but not the next. ABV is expertly hidden. The mouthfeel is super-creamy, and must be experienced to believe. This is about as thin as Dom Delouise, and smoother than Billy Dee Williams. Drinkability is just too good, regardless of the ABV. Good thing this is a big bottle, or I'd be in tears about now.

But it's definitely not all about the malt. The hops do way more than just balance this beer. Hops seem piney in nature. DB finishes well although the 10% ABV is evident. Pours a dark coppery red with a nice tan head. Both malt and hops can be noted in the aroma. Very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. Awesome beer with great malt AND hop character! Had this beer 2 days ago and I can't get it off my mind. I only wish I could get more, but I'll likely have to wait until next year.

Exceptional. The aroma offers bold notes of pineapple, soft grapefruit and berries as well as some grassy, earthy and piney hops - all of which reside above a candyish and lightly caramel tinged maltiness. The body is full with a very fine, median carbonation that's creamy and just slightly syrupy in the mouth.The flavor starts quite sweet, reveals its deep fruitiness and then some very rich caramel maltiness along with some clear alcohol. A solid bitterness balances well against the rich malt - solid, but not overly bitter. The finish is surprisingly clean and dry for such a sweet and malty beer. I was really surprised by this beer. Firstly, at how different it was from the Arrogant Bastard; secondly, at how directly the fruitiness found in their flagship pale ale was carried over; and thirdly, at how good it was!

Invitingly evil (or is that evilly inviting?) deep crimson color. A two-finger tan head sits on top. Stays well at first, then disappears. Huge, and I mean MASSIVE aroma. And on top of that, very complex. Citrus jumps out at you first, then raisin and plum. Just a touch of alcohol. Malt is deep inside, but definitely present. On the palate... ever hear the term ""flavor rush""? I think it's associated with some brand of potato chips. Well, that's not ""flavor rush"". Double Bastard is ""flavor rush""! My taste buds didn't know what hit them! So many complex flavors hit the different parts of your tongue. I'll try to describe them. Malt and hop sections are both at maximum capacity here! Malt is caramel and a bit peat-like, extremely chewy, thick, and tongue-coating. Hops are aggressive pine and citrus, a bit leafy and floral on the edges as well. Raisin, plum, and berries have a big presence too. With the hops, this creates kind of a plum or berry skin bittersweetness, which is a very unique thing. It even stays on in the aftertaste. Alcohol presence, although noticeable, is minimal for a brew of this size. Grainy malt is noticeable as well, mostly in the aftertaste. You could almost call this a barleywine, but that wouldn't do its strength justice! I must say, this is beer heaven! I can't even put it into words.
