The flavours also feature the pine and oak, but caramel malts are shining through as well. There is also some earthy dankness in the mix. A dry bitter finish rounds out the pleasure of drinking this one.","BeerWatcher","Mar 04, 2015"

The appearance is a great dark amber with about an inch of tan foamy head. Very inviting to say the least. This beer has the aroma of caramel/vanilla, malt, some citrus overtones and a hint of oak. At the first sip, the taste starts with a nice balance of sweet caramel malt with piney bitterness with a big oak finish that adds a certain sweetness. The oak taste is the best part in my opinion. The feel is smooth and not aggressive for the ABV with lower to moderate carbonation making this an easy drinker. Overall, probably my favorite beer out there.","BillCheck","Sep 19, 2014"

Both hops and malts come full force and with the aggressive bitterness and also detectable alcohol bite. This beer will take your palate to a bar so it can purposely beat it with a stool. I don’t have a problem slapping two bottles of this at anytime. But after two it might get a bit, tiresome. It is a liquid journey, just not down the alley I would prefer. This brew is worthy.","Shroud0fdoom","Sep 01, 2014"

4.45,6,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Straight from the Stone brewery into a growler poured into a mug. Lacing for days with a nice creamy head. The oaky nose remains the center stage with the scent from the hops shining  through. Exceptionally smooth while still remaining a flavorful ale in a way that only Stone could do. The hops in the finish keeps the bastard ale arrogant for a good reason.","ZorroPlateado","Jun 21, 2014"

The oak adds a depth that makes it a really unique tasting beer, and the fact that it's unused wood instead of something like bourbon barrels makes it cleaner and less hot.

4.18,-0.5,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"As a fan of Arrogant Bastard I couldn't wait to try its oak aged uncle. It definitely did not dissappoint. This ale pours one of the sexiest deep rich mahogany colors that I have ever seen in a beer. There is a very slight off white head that gives way to a substantial film and a lot of thick Cream lacing. The aroma is rich and buttery with lots of malty sweet notes reminiscent of caramel, toffee, and vanilla. In addition there is the wonderful aroma of smoky oak and a little piney hops. This ale sips quite thick and syrupy, definitely on the high end of the medium bodied beers. It is not an ale meant to just slug back. For only a 7.2 abver it seems quite thick and full bodied. The flavor surpasses the nose in its rich deliciousness. It is sweet and malty and smoky and at the same time slightly bitter and surprisingly fresh tasting(at least for an aged ale. There are plenty of caramel and vanilla notes, highlighted by the deep richness of the oak and the slighly bitter notes of piney hops. It is sweet but not cloying and simultaneously bitter but not tongue numbing like many Stone offerings. This is truly a great beer. I don't know how Stone does it but they continue to impress me time and time again. Maybe time to make a pilgrimage to visit them and really take all that they have to offer in.","lochef81","Mar 10, 2014"

Scents of brown sugar, molasses and maple up front, this mingles later with vanilla, oak and spicy, piney and cedar-like hop aromas. In the background is some faint citrus and overripe fruit. A nice, complex aroma, highlighting the malt, hops and oak quite nicely. Taste begins with a big hit of bitter hops, simply bitter without much flavor. This moves into more bitterness, backed by hints of caramel sweetness, a bit of oak in the background and bitter citrus pith and pine hop flavors. A bit of fruit in the background. The finish is dry, with bitter hop, mostly pine, but with some citrus pith and a bit of toasted malt. The aftertaste is bitter hops and toasted malt. A big, bold flavor, not as well balanced as the aroma, quite bitter, but not bad. The slight sweetness works with the bitter hops to make it quite drinkable, and the oak gives it some nice woodiness. Very good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation and a resinous feel. This makes it quite easy to drink, as it goes down smooth. Overall this is a good strong ale. A nice balanced and complex aroma, bold flavor and smooth mouthfeel combine to make a very nice drinking experience. Good job making a good beer better Stone.","Auraan","Feb 14, 2014"

Not picking up any grain or hop scents, just a sweet dark fruitiness. Taste of sweet boozy fruits immediately cut by acrid bitterness. A resiny, pithy bitter that keeps the sweet cooked sugars from being overpowering, finishing on an earthy, woody note that rounds the sharp edges.

It sure looks good in the glass though. The smell is all hops and oak. Piney with some citrus undertones, the oak is there stronger than most other oaked beers that I've had. Tastes like an Imperial IPA, strong upfront hops that resound with resiny pines and sour citrus, not unlike most other Stone products that I've tried. The oak is very pronounced, almost fighting with the hops for dominance. The first couple sips are almost unsettling and I'm not really sold on this one. As I finish, I have grown more acclimated to the flavors, but a little underwhelmed. Carbonation is light and the finish seems pretty dry. Overall, I don't think I'll revisit this one for a while, which is a shame as I was looking forward to giving it a try.","SFNC","Dec 03, 2013"

A must try to have at least tasted. I prefer the arrogant or double bastard over the oaked. Although, the oaken bastard is very good.","KJK-1","Nov 20, 2013"

The oak works nicely to subdue the malt and booze. A bit of piny and floral hops are noticable as well. It has a very creamy mouthfeel that tempers the boldness of the flavors. I really love what the oak does to Arrogant Bastard - great beer.","greenmtn1111","Aug 25, 2013"

4.19,-0.2,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Wow - a tsunami of flavour washes over your tastebuds. Worthy of it's name! It looks good, while the aroma and flavour are stunning. Tons of pine-laden hops and sweet malt, with the booze very well hidden. The hop character lacks depth, but who cares when it's this good? The oak chips are quite subtle but lend a woody dimension with a whiff of vanilla. Body is silky smooth. A top-notch effort; once again Stone school other brewers in how to go nuts with hops. Well worth sampling if you have the chance to try it.","jazzyjeff13","Jul 19, 2013"

Pours crystal clear ruby red color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, oak, floral, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and oak notes with moderate hop presence. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, pine resin, orange zest, floral, oak, clove, and floral earthiness. Large resinous pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, pine, oak, clove, nuttiness, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of malt flavors; with the big pine and oak bitterness overshadowing the malts; and a fair amount of cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on, even with the huge bitterness. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 02, 2013"

3.88,-7.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy orange-red with a thin off white head that fades into a thin lacing. After a while in the glass the chill haze subsides and the beer clears up. The aroma is pretty muted, the hops may have faded at this point. Its malty with notes of caramel and some woody-vanilla hints. The taste is not as assertive as regular AB. I'm wondering if the oaking mellowed it out a little bit, or if it was the age of the beer. Its a relatively chewy malt bomb. Toffee, bready, caramel and oak are the predominate flavor profiles. The body is medium-thick but not syrupy. There is a slight tannin finish to the beer, presumably from the oaking. I like this beer but I'm not a fan of the tannins. Although I can't complain since the 4-pack was only $5.","jamescain","May 09, 2013"

Head is extremely smooth with great lacing. The smell is very similar to that of the standard Bastard, but with just a hint of the oak chips at the very end. The taste is actually quite different from the standard ABA. This time, sweetness, biterness, and oakiness dominate, with just a bit of pine at the end. The mouth is also quite similar to the original Bastard. Smooth, yet leaves the biterness lingering. Overall, I'm won over. Honestly, I'd probably buy this over the original any day, but unfortunately, it's not as common. Good thing I'm from San Diego!","MisSigsFan","Mar 01, 2013"

Generally I do not like the schmaltzy aftertaste of standard ales (English, Belgian and Brown) preferring instead those of the highly hopped IPA category. This beer has harnessed my curiosity to explore the ale experiments a bit more. Very nice beer - copper tone with a limited head but a strident aftertaste of hop.

I also remember being shocked by the $18/6pk price but buying it anyway. Sadly, I recall not being at all impressed by this beer fresh, finding it quite harsh and not very enjoyable...hence a primary reason this has been sitting quietly in my cellar for 8 years. So, when I stumbled upon this bottle I figured it was as good a time as any to give it another try. What I find now is a truly excellent beer that has held up very well and improved greatly with age. The balance here is just about perfect and the flavors have mellowed a bit and blended together to create a beer that truly surprised me. Not sure I have the patience anymore to lay a beer down for 8 years (at least intentionally), but I am really hoping that I have another of these vintage bottles hiding in a dark corner of my cellar collection.","portia99","Nov 27, 2012"

4.13,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"finally ive obtained this. it pours a rich redwood color, clear and amber like tree sap. theres a head an inch or so tall just off white, but it relaxes to just patchy foam after a minute. the nose is less in my face than i thought itd be. its just mellow notes of mature oak, tart dried fruits, and aggressive west coast hops. theres more balance from some nice english caramel or red malts. its also calmed from its original version to an arguably less arrogant and more refined and sophisticated status, which i certainly appreciate. the hops are much more laid back, contributing more than just bitterness. the oak does wonders for this beer, and its definitely my favorite of the bastards. it has a great feel, full bodied but the carbonation is tame from the oak chips, and the finish is complex and refreshing at the same time. the alcohol is also not as evident, which i think is also a positive this time around. i really enjoyed this one.","StonedTrippin","Sep 19, 2012"

Flavor is delicious caramel malt, pine and citrus hops and wood. Medium to heavy bodied. Malt middle and finish with a nice hop kick at the end. Well balanced. One of my all time favorite beers.","LiquidAmber","Aug 03, 2012"

3.62,-13.8,4,4.5,3,4,3.5,"O - I'm honestly not sure what this beer is trying to be. The color and dark caramel character never melded very well with the strong hoppiness of the normal Bastard, and the oaky vanilla character doesn't either. It's not bad, but it's also not very good. Certainly not worth having again, since it's far too small to age.","kdb150","Jul 27, 2012"

I've had plenty of beers that have seen some oak, but this one has such an intense oak flavor that when I first tasted it I was unsure whether or not I really liked it. After getting over the initial shock, though, I was able to thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the Oaked Arrogant Bastard.","StoneTSR","Jul 26, 2012"

4.53,7.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a shaker. Like the original brew, it pours a deep, dark amber with ruby overtones to it. The head on this pour was a little small, still with lots of carbonation rushing from the bottom, leaves excellent lacing throughout the glass. The nose is a little mellowed in this one compared to the original brew. There is still lots of citrus and piney resin hops, and the caramel sweet malt is there, but it's been smoothed out with a roasty, oaky aroma. The taste is very hop forward, lots of citrus flavor. The oak is there, but not overpowering like you're drinking a beer with whiskey in it. The malts have a more dark fruits, roasty taste to them. Mouthfeel is very full, mildly carbonated, slightly oily with a long bitter finish. Very excellent beer. It is an Arrogant Bastard slightly mellowed by the oak. I will have another please.","estlinska","Jun 25, 2012"

The smell is intense, if only a little more subdued than the non-oaked version. Thick with hop scents...spicy, woody, rich...toasted malt...bread crust...some dark fruit. The taste is equally intense, full and sense-provoking. Bitter, sweet (not bittersweet), and malty. Loads of hop flavor...herbal and spicy. Long finish with continuous hop qualities. It is hard to find the oak in the beer initially, but it is clearly present when you look for it. All around great.","Suds","Jun 09, 2012"
4.17,-0.7,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"In a nutshell; Yup, you guessed it, this is Arrogant Bastard aged on American Oak chips. The oak chips, with their creamy, overt flavors of vanilla and almonds definitely round out the very punchy flavor profile of the original, making it both drier, and more complex. The chips definitely sap a little bit of the fight out of the Chinook hops, letting the malts peep through a tad more. Overall, It'd really depend on my mood which of the two year round produced Arrogant Bastard variants I'd choose. I definitely can't recommend one over the other. My best suggestion is by them both and try them side by side.","flayedandskinned","Jun 09, 2012"

3.53,-16,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought that this was an OK beer and a slightly above average example of an American Strong Ale, it had some nice complexity, but some of the things that should have been highlighted ended up being overshadowed by all the sweet malts. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and it was a little boozy, one is enough for me, I wouldn't want a second. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty good in my snifter and it had a nice caramel color along with good head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance and the fact that the barrel treatment really didn't stick out that much. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I am glad I tried it, but when I want something barrel aged, I think I will look elsewhere. I recommend giving this beer a try, but it for sure isn't for everyone. Stone is a pretty good brewery, most of the beers I have had from them have been pretty intense, that's why I was let down with how light the barrel flavors in this beer where, I always expect big, bold and in your face beers from Stone, and this one didn't quite live up to my expectations, it's a decent beer, but nothing worth tracking down, Double Bastard is still my favorite of Stone's Bastard series.","StoutHunter","May 14, 2012"

Taste is sweet caramel malt, floral piney hops, some light toasted oak notes and light citrus fruity flavors. Palate is full body and flavor with a slightly sticky mouth feel and good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, floral piney hops ending is sweet bitter hops with some lingering nutty oaked flavor. Overall a good, robust and flavorful brew. Nicely done.","Samp01","May 11, 2012"

Aroma is complex, with sweet, caramelly malt up front, followed by piney, rustic hop aroma. Woody aroma from oak is blended and well-balanced. Like the aroma, the flavor is balanced and complex. Lots of hops from start to finish, with a bracing bitterness balanced by just enough malt sweetness. Oak adds just the right amount of complexity without being overpowering. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Nice, dry, lingering bitterness in the finish. Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite beers, and the oaked version didn't disappoint!","CASK1","May 06, 2012"

A nice aroma of fruit (particularly cherry), bread, oak, and just a touch of grass. The fruit and oak aroma blends quite well with one another. Flavor follows the aroma quite well. Sweet in the get go, woody in the middle, bitter in the finish along with a touch of alcohol showing itself. A nice balance shared between the different flavors. Medium and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, I enjoyed this one. I would have liked the finish to be just a touch less bitter for my personal tastes and that would have increased the overall score for me but the bitter level still wasn't too much to prevent me from enjoying this.

Quite sweet with a nutty brown sugar idea. There's a slight medicinal flavor here, but still very sweet.

When it says “oaked”, it means “OAKED”. While an excellent brew on its own, you can’t help but compare it with the regular version. Which raises the question….is it better than normal Arrogant Bastard? In my opinion, no. The extreme bitterness of the grapefruit-like hop character AND the extra bitter oak together just equaled kind of an overkill for me, and I find the original to be much smoother and better balanced.","TempeBeerMan","Feb 16, 2012"

The mid palate allows the malt character to shine, complex but still light, with caramel, candied fruits, a little bit of burnt sugar, even a little bit of bread. Drying on the finish with some oak, a nice piney bitterness and a little bit of burnt sugar, this beer is medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. The mouthfeel is quite nice here.

Take the huge hoppy slap in the face of most Stone beers (not that there's anything wrong with that) and really round off the spike of bitterness; what you're left with are fantastic layers of oaky malt and vanilla, finishing on the back end with sweet dark fruit and citrus rinds. I love the layers and the balance of this, especially compared to the hop bombs of other Stone offerings.","akinsja","Jan 10, 2012"

Smell is pleasantly hoppy with hints of lemon and a little oak-y. Taste has tons of citrus. Has been a long time since I tried the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale but I can't taste too much of the oaked character of this to know the difference between the two. Nice bitterness.

There's a bit to it that I can't quite place, but it comes together to work very well. I haven't had the original Arrogant Bastard in a long while, so I can't attest to how much the oaking actually adds, but irregardless (I love that ""word""), it is a good brew. Not sure if it's worth the expense, but independent of cost, it is a good brew well worth checking out.","kemoarps","Jan 09, 2012"

Smell of some dark fruits and lots of malt notes, vaguely reminiscent of the regular Arrogant Bastard (AB). Lots of woody oak character, with a bit of butterscotch and vanilla. Some subdued hop notes in the periphery. Taste has more oak and vanilla qualities, and takes on a feel that comes across like a thinner and lighter AB Some brown sugar, substantial malt notes and hopping that again, vaguely reminds me of the regular AB. A bit of alcohol at the finish as well. Body is a bit disappointing, would've appreciated it to be as big as the standard AB is. Carbonation is a light medium. Not bad on the whole, but the big and bold flavours of AB appear to be lost or subdued - however, I suspect that this may have origins in bottle freshness.","liamt07","Jan 03, 2012"

With the hops subdued, the oak chips do provide an interesting complexity and different character, but I'll stick with my non-oaked AB from now on. Definitely worth a try though.","FattyJLE","Dec 20, 2011"

3.7,-11.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O: I thought the Draft version I had in the Bistro was near outstanding. Lots of oak flavor in that one probably because it was so fresh.

4.03,-4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice dark amber body with not a lot of head. The smell is of roasted malts and some citrus hops comes through.

I like.","CheezyBlaster","Oct 25, 2011"
3.95,-6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Taste-Some up-front oak wood dull spiciness, followed by citrus hops and toasted malt. My first impression is that this brew is not as tasty or as well-balanced as the regular Arrogant Bastard. To my palate the oak just gets in the way of an already beautifully balanced and tremendously flavorfull brew that is Arrogant Bastard. To me it's like adding cola to a twelve year old scotch. Not bad, of course, but it's changing the flavor of something that should be tried on its own. Just my opinion. The oaked version is no slouch by any means, and certainly worth a try, but for my money the regular 'Bastard is by far the best!","hosehead83","Oct 24, 2011"

3.38,-19.5,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall: This one didn't really do it for me. I mean, its base beer is basically too good to screw up, but the oak seems to detract from the base instead of add. I always avoided this one because the sixers are so damned expensive. I found it sold by the bottle and bought one...so glad I only bought one bottle. Stone, put regular Bastard in sixers and this one in bombers!","JohnnyChicago","Oct 06, 2011"

4.45,6,4,4,5,4.5,4,"O - A beer that should be talked about more.

4.07,-3.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a very dark crimson-brown with a small foamy 1/4 inch head that settles to a small cap. Small streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of hops, sweet malt, and some oak wood aromas. There is also an earthy, herby aroma I am getting as well. Taste is of some toasted malt, herbal hops, and a woody earth-like flavor that tones down the overall hop flavors. A mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth but slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer where the oak gives Arrogant Bastard's hop overload a bit of a toning down.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 27, 2011"

The lacing does it's job pretty well and sticks to the glass nicely. The smell of the beer is still pretty hoppy, it still smells like Bastard. The addition of oak had a minimal amount of strength in my opinion. The oak shows up slightly on the nose and in the taste but doesn't really curve my thoughts of the beer in either direction. The mouthfeel is nice, it's slick and smooth feeling. Overall I found it to be pretty good and would probably drink it again if I could.","Knapp85","Sep 06, 2011"

Very fruity malty aroma, with some rounded out vanilla and hoppy citrus notes. A very smooth flavor, robust malts, caramelly malts, and juicy fruity, citrusy hops. The oak does not present itself in flavor, so much as in smoothness, and thats nice. Very full, but sweetish mouthfeel. This is a nice take on Arrogant Bastard, I think the oak does a nice thing for this beer. Very round, a tasty.","pmlondrigan","Aug 27, 2011"
4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in a standard pint glass. No dating evident on the bottle. Pours a deep amber hue with a semi-hazy clarity. Head is a quarter inch, loose and off-white in color and eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim. Some spots and a thin sheet of lacing adheres to the side of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses caramel malt, molasses, a suggestion of earthiness and perhaps a trace of coffee. Taste follows nose - not really getting any oak in here but there's a slight citrus character. A light hops bitterness comes out towards the back, but this is definitely a malt-centric brew with enough complexity to keep it from being one-sided or overly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant and even carbonation. Generally speaking, I'm not a huge Stone fan, but this was a solid offering. Not really sure where the oak comes in, but well worth a try nonetheless.","Jwale73","Aug 27, 2011"
4.06,-3.3,5,4,4,4,4,"Just like regular AB, a ton of caramel and brown sugar greet the nose, accompanied by a blast of pine and citrus hops that are at least a strong as the hops. The oak presence isn't at all unpleasant, but I'm not sure it improves things necesarily. In fact, it seems to somewhat blunt the raw power of the hops, particulary in the bitterness error. Not to say the big bad Bastard is tamed; indeed, it's still a force to be reckoned with. The oak simply seems to provide a certain smoothness while coaxing out lots of sweet and buttery subtleties from the malt profile. I prefer regular AB, but the oaked version is very nice as well. I'm curious how it would handle some cellar time. Possibly it would evolve into an exceedingly smooth sipper.","PDXHops","Aug 27, 2011"

I suppose the oak aging, or whatever they have done, has made the flavors more pronounced. One thing that surprised me was the obvious biscuit flavor.

Looks just like the regular, pretty dark amber with a thick sticky head and great lace. Smell is sweeter, with a hint of dank, grape and yeast. Doesn't smell as hoppy as ABA. Round yeastiness with a little sweetness, less hop character and more aspirin bitterness. The oak comes across as cloying, burnt toast bitterness on the back of the tongue.

The hops, in fact are perfectly bitter and lingering, but you don't leave the first taste thinking of the hops. You think of the bread-like taste first, then the hops actually take over in the finish. Alcohol taste is definitely present, but in no way does it take away from the beer. It finishes dryly, but not exactly crisply, and almost refreshing but definitely not the best beer for a hot day. This is full-bodied without being overbearingly thick in the mouth. I honestly expected this to be more like regular Arrogant Bastard, but with the oaked variety it seems like the oak chips took an edge of that maltiness and a spiciness to it that was either lost in the muddled feel of the non-oaked variety or simply wasn't there. Either way, I prefer this one and the fact that it's way more drinkable than its brother. The mouthfeel was not as thick and hard to drink.

The barrel aging is immediately obvious with oak and woodiness slowly giving way to bitter hoppiness.

As is swirl and stick my nose in the glass, I am bombarded by wonderful, heavy, sort of syrupy fragrance of sweet and sour. Lots of grapefruit, spices, and pine, but then on the other end of the scale there is vanilla, cherries, figs, caramel, toffee, and sweet malt. Taste is better than the smell, smooth rush of tartness from the hops in the guise of grapefruit, lime, and pine. Then there is the sweetness of toffee, vanilla, caramel, wild cherry, and sweet malt.

And why chips vs oak barrels? Chips are what less reputable vintners use in wine (cheaper, and although I think it's a similar effect I swear I can taste the difference in wines too).

The hazy, sediment filled dark ruby tobacco burst strong ale gives off unidentified fruit and sweetness in the nose. I was beginning to have my doubts about this bastard of a beer until I tasted it. Wow! Rich and complex. Bitterness up front and all around, evens out with a caramel malt finish. The bitterness lingers, without any leafy hop presence. Smoky, roasty, oak notes with hints of vanilla. Alcohol and fruity esters start to appear as you work your way through the pint. The imparted oak characteristics coat your mouth, and become present in great depth. It's starting to taste like a campfire. As it warms, bitterness increases up front with currant, tobacco and chocolate. I can't get over how much is coming out of this beer. Roasted malts start to dominate at the end. The flavor of this beer is it's strong point, but the mouthfeel is a close second. Crisp carbonation pairs well with a medium-thick body. The 7.2% is like a smack in the face from the gargoyle who sits on the front of the bottle, daring you to drink. Thank you sir, may I have another! I'm not worthy!","ggilman","Apr 18, 2011"

My wife thinks it smells like an asian sauce of some sort and, after the suggestion, I didn't disagree. The flavor is big hops atop that light caramel flavor with the faintest hint of oak. You could slip this past someone as Arrogant Bastard in my opinion without them knowing. That said, this is a very solid beer anyway. Big carb and a bit of lingering sweetness accompany the hoppy finish. Overall, a darn good beer, oak or little to no oak.

4.88,16.2,5,4.5,5,5,5,"I'm a big fan of their original Arrogant Bastard so I had to try this one. On the first smell I get a smoked sweet oak scent with some pine and citrus from the hops. It starts off with the smokey oak sweetness mixing in with the regular roasted thick almost caramel like malts they normally use in the original version. The oak is pretty strong in the middle of the taste which sticks around on the middle of the tongue just as long as the bitterness from the hops stick around on the back of the tongue. It's pretty rich and has a thick mouthfeel and could pass for an Imperial beer easily with the richness and body that it has. I love how Stone hops their beers they never fail me when I'm looking for that hop punch. They aren't a one trick pony though and this beer proves it. They incorporated the oak flavor so well in this that it makes an already amazing beer even better and more complex.

The woody oak flavor serves to relax the tension between the mighty flavors at odds. Each sip leaves a dry, bitter hop flavor on the tongue with the more cautious oak surrounding. The back of your throat reminds you of the past sweet vanilla malts and invites another sip. I would recommend checking out the Oaked version of the Bastard, but definitely check out Arrogant Bastard first.","HarrisonDean","Feb 18, 2011"

It smells like a Stone beer. Wow, I'm looking forward to trying this. OK- The taste is even better! The Oak makes itself known here, along w/ malt, and a big hop presence. Maybe a little grapefruit in there too. Amazing how balanced this beer is, how everything works together for an amazing result. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet the hops give a bite to the feel. Balanced in perfect harmony. This is super easy to drink as well. I could down several of these before the 7.2% ABV kicked in. Just like everything else I've had from Stone, this beer doesn't disappoint. In fact, I would have to put this in the World Class category. Fantastic Beer. Will definitely pick this one up again.","jayhawk73","Feb 18, 2011"

It smells of bitter citrus hops and has a light sweet maltiness to it. There is also a good and strong presence of oak, earthiness, and light smoke. It's definitely a slight upgrade to the AB. The flavors consist of mild hop bitterness to pair with a whole ton of earthiness followed by a nice and subtly sweet malt backbone. There's a lot of wood, dirt, tree bark going on yet in a pleasant manner. There are also light vanilla accents. It drinks exceptionally smooth and medium bodied. It leaves behind an appealing oaky/vanilla bitter hop flavor in the after taste. I find this to be much more appealing than the original AB. It has a lot more character. I wouldn't say it's necessarily easy to drink though. Like the AB, this one gets to be a little much after awhile. I couldn't drink more than one at a sitting.

Both brews had pretty much the same colour, a cloudy darkish brown colour. The oaked version had a smaller head (0.5 cm instead of 3 cm). The oaked ale has a weaker smell, I guess I lot of the hoppiness faded during the aging. That doesn't really leave that much smell, just some slightly spicy breadiness. The taste is pretty similar to the regular ale: a lovely bready hop flavour. The oaked version is a little drier with some extra woodiness.

Notes of oak and vanilla are present as well. Very bourbon-like. Full bodied with little carbonation but not so syrupy as to detract much from the drinkability. Not much different from the original bastard until you describe the palate. The oak hits you up front and almost drowns out the nice malt that, in my opinion, makes the unoaked version so great. Not bad though. Just a different character. The hops still come through strong on the finish but not as quickly or aggressively as the original. The oak lingers with the hops through the finish so you are left with a honey sweetness with a touch of bitterness instead of a wave of palate searing hoppy resin. This gives it a cleaner feel, making it easier to drink. I like this more than I remember. Maybe as much as the original.","hoppyhampy","Jan 14, 2011"

Very imposing. Good couple finger creamy froth head. The refined hoppy bitterness tastes like the traditional Arrogant Bastard Ale sans the Oak, but after some more tinkering to iron out the kinks. Thins out a bit after aspiration and hoppiness-to-mellow sweetness balance starts to shift towards sweetness. Citrusy notes of grapefruit rind are apparent, as is a mild caramely sweetness.

The color is a glorious clear brown-red with a touch of orange when held up to the light, much like a red ale, but way more legendary. The aroma is light in hops, light in oak, but the headturner here was the tropical fruits I smelled: guava and starfruit. They were surprising to me, and took me about 3 straight minutes of smelling to narrow down specific fruit smells. I'm not experienced enough to know if this tropical smell comes from fruits or hops, but it is definitely what I'm smelling. I don't taste the fruits, but I taste bitter hops with a little oak, and a small sting on the tongue from the carbonation. This beer sticks slightly on the mouth.

My only complaint is that the oak character is quite subtle, when it seems like the beer would have held up to a much more intense oak character. I get a some oak in the aroma as the beer warms, but there is little woody taste. This is a shame because a stronger oak character would have worked nicely with the darkness of the finish and could have mitigated the slightly harsh bitterness that coats the palate.

I really have never seen the great appeal for the original Arrogant Bastard, but the 'Oaked' version stands out as a pretty damn good beer. The flavors seem to come together much better and does not show the same roughness as the unoaked version. This one is pretty smooth and tasty.

As it warmed you do get more of an earthy smell, presumably the oak or wood with some nut and dry malt. Taste was more like a subtle version of the regular. You have the caramel, sweet backbone with the citrusy hops but overall a slightly dulled twist. Somewhat nutty I almost think. Mouthfeel was fuller and velvety, very pleasant.

A nice hit of malt up front, then you can taste some of that oak on your palate, and it leaves you with a bite of hops at the end. I tasted just a bit of cinnamon with this beer, and also some peat smoke. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel was on the dry side, but smooth. Would have guessed the abv to be somewhat higher.

Very good retension and a solid amount of lace all around the glassware. Aroma is bright citrus hops with a backing of wood/oak earthiness. Taste is inline with what the aroma led on. When compared to the bottled version this on tap almost seemingly is an exaggerated oak flavor that boarders being unnatural. Bitter oily hops upfront with alcohol warmth gives way to malt and oakiness flavors through the medium body to again oily bitter hop finish. Moderately carbonated with hops and oak left lingering in the mouth. Dare I say this bastard on draft is even more arrogant than the bottled version...excellent.","stakem","May 17, 2010"

There's a flatness to the nose, not necessarily a lack of scents per se, just a certain lack of vigor in the vanilla, chocolate base as well as the creamy whiskey notes and golden raisin, red cherry, apricot scents, this leaves extra room for the hops, grains and grasses to assert themselves whereas otherwise they would come off as more contained. Medium-bodied, whipped up and foamy in the mouth to no obvious specific end, More oomph in the caramel, vanilla fudge, mocha flavors, some sweet cedar as well. Same goes for a mild elevation in the nectarine, apricot, pineapple, peach fruit but, truly, not much. Some orange to lemon citrus yet surprisingly light.

The hops start to shine in the finish, but do not overwhelm the complex malt bill. The mouthfeel is fairly effervescent and not too sticky for the sweetness. A bit boozy tasting to be real drinkable, not sure I'd try to do multiple bottles in one sitting, and the taste re hops certainly benefit from warming up a bit.

The flavor is good, has quite a sweet flavor that comes across quickly, seems like brown sugar and caramel. Also there seems to be a nice amount of wood aged flavor, which adds to the complexity as a nutty and fruit flavor profile come through. There is a hop presence there as well but again it was not overpowering so I do wonder if I got a aged bottle of this one, regardless the flavors where nice.

My palate was all but destroyed by the end of the 12 oz (Like the bottle says, I'm not worthy!).

Minty, citric, floral, dry and woody. The oak still cant tame the Bastard but I do think its the culprit for the dryer taste.

Every sip is jam-packed with flavor, with a rich, dry fruitiness and notes of caramel contrasting with a potent, woodsy hop bitterness. The heat of the alcohol is apparent, but it is not overwhelming, and the rich smoothness of the beer helps to tame the booziness.

The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is not what I expected. I expected some of the oak to come through but all I smell is pungent hops. The hops give off pine resin and some light citrus aromas. It has been awhile since I have tasted regular Arrogant Bastard so I do not know how different the oaked version compares. Again any oaked elements are very subtle. Overall very hoppy and resiny flavor and no balance. Bitterness is high. Decent mouthfeel and carbonation. The bitterness hurts the mouthfeel because of the lingering bitter aftertaste. Another unbalanced, highly hopped and bitter beer. Enjoyable if that is your thing.","morimech","Sep 06, 2009"

Quite a nice looking beer. When it was brought to me I almost thought it was a porter with how dark it looked. I had to hold it up to the light and I could see that it was a very very deep red/brown color on the edges with a slight haze to it, the middle was still very dark. It had a off white colored head to it, almost a caramel or butterscotch color that goes away and lingers for about half way through. Slight lacing on the glass. The smell is good citrus and pine hops, not quite as strong as I remember it in the past. Taste was good too. Similar to to the taste, same hops, followed by a slight smokey taste to it. Again, not as strong as I remember it. Mouthfeel was good, surprisingly smooth for an American Strong Ale. Also it was pretty drinkable.

A second bottle provided a bit more malt in the nose and a hint more wood in the flavor but it may just have been expectation with the second bottle. Bitter hop finish.

Taste is hoppy, but is a conservative amount of hop, theres a sweetness in there as well and a bit of a roasted, earthy flavor, assumably from the oak. its not super robust but nicely balanced, wood flavor really comes through as the beer approaches room temperature.. mouth is on the lighter side of moderate, not thin though, nice carbonation (not too crisp but present). its very drinkable, goes down easily, not the fullest flavor but good all around..","BirdFlu","May 08, 2009"

The smell is a cavalcade of different hops as well as some oak and malt. I can pick out floral, piney, and citrusy hops. The taste starts off with a combination of malt and grapefruity hops that balance well and give way to some more hops that are slightly piney and floral as well as some oak flavor that helps balance out some of the bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a certain amount of slickness from the hops and fairly low carbonation.

Even though it is bitter there is not a lot of hop flavor. The sweet alcohol flavor is strong, something I really never love in a beer. It goes down smooth and seems to be only lightly carbonated.

Aroma comes in a little woody (go figure) but with other earthiness as well due to the hop profile... something that is large in regular bastard as well. I'm not breaking it down any further than that, this beer smells awesome. Like an old baseball glove. Body is light to medium. Flavor is fairly bitter with that sprucy resinous biterness tempered by a heavy maltiness. Ever lingering within the normal hoppiness rides the flavor of the oak, which changes this beer considerably. A must try for all the oak lovers out there","hophead247","Apr 07, 2009"
4.3,2.4,3.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"This beer certainly has its strong suits, but overall is a very, very solid brew. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is murky dark red with only a quickly fleeting head. The lack of head adds to the lack of power in the nose. Only with deep strong sniffs can you pick up the nice aromas available. The oak is stronger in the nose then in the taste. There is plenty of wood, along with hints of alcohol and the primary warnings of the coming bitterness. The taste is outstanding in the fact that you can really pick out many different flavors. Sweet malts only last a second but they're there. Then alcoholic piney hops upon hops bombard your throat after you swallow. Get ready for some dryness. Big oak backs all the flavors but never takes over. It really compliments it all the way around. Smooth smooth smooth in moutfeel department. Too much dryness for it to be super drinkable, but you could have a couple.","joshuadlight","Apr 07, 2009"

The stone brewery has become a favorite of mine over the years, I expect good things to come, and thank god i can get this beer on the east coast. You can taste the difference between the oak aged, and the regular brew. If you can find it, get at least two sixers... the only problem with this brew is that its hard to find. Upon tasting the first beer, i raised my hands up, and said yes.... yes....","rodney45","Mar 06, 2009"
3.98,-5.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from 12oz bottle received in trade with kiefdog. Pours a deep red color with a half finger of off white head that leaves a steady coat of lacing around the glass. Smell is definitely oaky and roasty. Taste is oaky up front but is followed by sweet Belgian-like yeast and malt tastes. It's hard to pick out specific flavors. This beer gets way better as it warms. Pretty thick mouthfeel that really coats the mouth and leaves an oaky aftertaste. Drinkabilty is as good a full flavored strong ale can be. My first beer from Stone and I'm fairly impressed.","dakid618","Mar 05, 2009"

First taste is big hops that penetrate the whole flavor, but are mellowed somewhat by the oak. Lots of pineapple and a potent malt, hints of vanilla and a hoppy finish. Easy to drink if you're a hop-head like me, has a nice bite without going overboard. A fantastic variation of a fantastic beer, quite addictive.","Thanby","Mar 05, 2009"

The ABV is in perfect balance with the brew's more earthy flavors. From the first sip to the last there is no wandering of flavor. This beer is in your mouth, to the point, and gone until the next sip. The after taste is pleasant and not a loiterer. You can smell this brew from a foot away though its ABV doesn't suggest how strong it actually was.

This is a truly beautiful beer to look at.

Nice sticky lacing and swirls on the top though. The aroma is more malt and earthy wood to me than it is hoppy. The flavor is hoppy, but that just seems like part of it. Arrogant bastard is very hoppy, and it makes no excuses that it is designed to be hoppy, the oaked version just seems to have hops as part of the mix. The malt stands out a bit more, probably because the hops mellow with the addition of the oak aging time. The oaked version of this is a touch sweeter, a lot mellower, and has a bit more character in mouthfeel thanks to the tannins from the wood.","dolemite77","Dec 24, 2008"

4.2,0,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Well, it is what it says on the label, an oaked Arrogant Bastard. It is probably unfortunate that I'm reviewing this beer during Double Bastard season. I love the amplified flavors of the stronger version. On the other hand, this beer tones down those flavors with a very refined but strong oak taste. A part of me misses the full bore of the pure stuff. This is a beer to pair against AB and thus appreciate its additions. Paired with Double Bastard (I'm not doing so directly but I've just had a lot recently), the oaked version is just a touch lacking. Then again, this seems to follow the Arrogant Bastard hierarchy. Double Bastard is the best drink to hold while you look down your nose at other beers, but the oaked has a more refined arrogance. It tastes like oak, probably the most arrogant of wood flavors. It's bitter and almost chalky and just dares you not to like it. It's the kind of taste that people tell you that you have to learn to like and, damn it, they're right. The appearance is the cherry on top with the color of an oak-aged brandy and a soapy head with plenty of lacing. It's just a difficult beer to describe without referencing Arrogant Bastard and firmly establishes itself as an even more snobbish version of AB. I mean I love it, but a duck's a duck. My only real thought while I drink it is how the oak really came through. You won't confuse this beer with the normal version. It's the kind of beer to get drunk to while you quietly judge a crowd of people and they come up decidedly lacking.","popery","Dec 10, 2008"

3.92,-6.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Sugary fruitiness to open opens up to a slightly creamy, slightly grainy maltiness. Oak tannins are finally apparent and mix well with the notes of vanilla I am picking up here. All of this mixes together as the fruitiness reasserts itself into a wonderfully complex flavor profile. The fruitiness here is not grapefruit or orange or mango, it's not any of these things. The flavor is a bit difficult to describe. The fruitiness is one the sweeter side, vanilla and honey, but nothing overpowering and all blends well with a sweet, underlying oakiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and leaves a long and lasting bitterness down the center of the tongue long after the last drop empties from the glass. Carbonation does not do much for be and could stand to be just the sligthest bit snappier, felt a bit uneven in places, that is to say, I thought the consistency of the beer could stand to be just a bit thicker, more substantive. Other than that I could not put this beer down, it has a beguiling flavor that you can't really put your finger on.

Woody roasted malts of front, big citrus kick in the middle, and the oak really shows up on the finish. Great flavors and excellent balance. It has a medium body, resiny texture turning dry, and moderate carbonation. Yes, this is a very good beer, but I don't think it lived quite up to the hype my friends created for me about this beer.

The aroma is of dark fruit, hops, alcohol, and of course oak...a lot of it too! The taste is more focused on hops with a background character that is still very noticeable of oak and wood.

The taste is up front with the malt characteristics of caramel, toast, and honey but the beer then gives way to the oak characteristics before finally finishing with a piney hop characteristic.

A very heavy Ale and I would guess it would be easy to bugger this combination up, but Stone has out done themselves. A truly fantastic ale, in a league of it's own.

The head was better and lasted quite a while for a cask. But the biggest problem here is that I think that Bastard is a a beer in any form that has to be served cold. Many beers are fine (or even better) at room temperature, but Bastard is not one of them (IMHO).

However, it was a sweet smell, and not sweet malt, though malt was present. The only other beer I can think of right off that had this powerful sweet hops smell is 3F's Dreadnaught. I have had several brews that had that, but only those two so assertively. Taste, too, is commanded by hops, with little noticeable malt (to me, I know it's there, though). This is certainly a brew for the hop lover. I'm not a huge American hops fan, but I still appreciate and enjoy this immensely. Mouthfeel is fairl heavy, but right where it needs to be IMO.

A strong, caramel, malty backbone blends subtly with the hops. There is a faint undertone of oak that ties together the disparate parts in a chewy, dare I say smokey, harmony.

Mouth feel is incredibly silky smooth for such an IPA treat.","genog","May 08, 2008"

It smelled very similar too, with lots of warm citrus hops mixed with caramel malt. It tasted the same at first, with the strong orange and pine hops blended with caramel malt, but it also had a noticeable oak flavor blended in. It felt about the same as the original, watery with slight carbonation, and a smooth clean aftertaste with strong bitterness (and oak). Overall this took a great beer and made it even better, with a more unique and balance flavor.","Pencible","Mar 31, 2008"

Lots of malt in the smell, I somehow expected to smell the oak, but it's kind of hard to distinguish. The taste really blew me away. Some raisins, roasted malt sweetness, followed by the familiar Bastard Ale bitterness and the oak character coming through. I really like the regular Bastard Ale, but I think this is even better. The aging really mellowed it out, it's got a great smooth character, wonderful mouthfeel, wonderful finish that lasts and lasts. Really fantastic beer.","PlaywrightSam","Mar 27, 2008"

A bit fruity in the nose, with some sweeter overtones. Not as much hoppiness as I was expecting, but it wasn't overbearing, which is a plus. Had some overtones that reminded me of baker's chocolate, as well as some smokiness. The body was a bit more on the heavy side, and there was a bit too much carbonation.

Initial taste is pungent raisins and prunes, and an earthy, woody flavour. Initial mouthfeel is medium bodied with an astringent edge, and a soft carbonation. Bitterness is very strongly balanced initially, and explodes in the finish with a long, drying aftertaste. Take 2 brings out some coffee-like aromas and a graininess. Still very astringent in the mouth but from floral hoppiness comes through with a grapefruitiness. No question, this is a big flavourful beer, and challenging to say the least.

Then a creamy oaky, with slight vanilla taste in the middle. Then hop layers abound and the finish has some hop bitterness, but nothing like arrogant bastard.

Everything the aroma promises and then some. Woody notes and hints of pine in addition to the citrus and hops. I think I discover something new about it every time I have this. Obviously this is a lot like Arrogant Bastard, but still wholly unique. It seems a little more confident, while Arrogant Bastard acts like it's got something to prove (though it proves itself with flying colors, to be sure).

Big taste of the hops... very citrusy and piny. Great bitterness on the center of the tongue, finishing clean with a strong, grainy touch. Some vanilla in the aftertaste.

It has a nice balance between the aromas. The first sip brings a very solid vanilla and tannin that moves to a full pine hop with a sweet caramel and almost sugary sweetness that fades into a solid but pleasing bitterness. I really think the vanilla on this one blends really well with the caramel and hop of the brew. I don't remember their being a a vanilla note in this one.

Smells slightly sour and woody- not acetic, but some wood sourness. There are also earthy/spicy hops and some rough tannins. The taste is somewhat similar, the somewhat harsh and spicy taste of the regular arrogant bastard has been smoothed out by the oak, but the oak introduces its own version of roughness. Nevertheless, its still fairly tasty as it is a fairly harmonious union between oak and hops and malt. Mouthfeel is a little tannic and rough- could be smoother. I miss some of the vanilla notes that come from full barrel aging. Just okay, and probably not worth the money.","Georgiabeer","Oct 28, 2007"

The first one I had I didn't really think the oak was doing much but smooting things out. Now on the second one a few weeks later I'm really getting a full oaky wood taste.

Mouthfeel is less dry than I thought it would be, and the carbonation is about right, medium to mild. So delicious I'd have another, dangerous, as the alcohol is well hidden in my opinion.

The beer poured the same deep amber almost brown as it's more common older brother with a similar head that left a little less lacing. The aroma was almost identical to it's brother, caramel malts and pine hops with just a hint of oak. The oak in the taste adds a truly unique quality to an already complex beer. My only problem is it adds just a slight astringency to the mouthfeel, nothing much, but enough to keep it from the 5 I gave it's brother. All being said, this is also a one of my absolute favorite beers, but I rank it just behind the real deal.","atsprings","Apr 21, 2007"

I'm not sure of the differences between the oaked and non-oaked, I would need to drink them side by side, though I do know the difference from the double. It's hard to forget the double.

Taste was very good..a little maltiness up front, then a good long hops blast with grapefruit and piney flavors (very much like Bigfoot). The follow through is very smooth and malty (like Monster Ale). My first sip felt thin and watery. All cured by the second taste. Smooth, rich mouthfeel and great tasting throughout.

The smell is much more malty/oaky than the normal Bastard. Maybe because it's because I'm a hophead that the odor doesn't stand out to me. Taste is absolutely amazing, mild bitter hops bite the tongue but is quickly diminished by the wonderful malty/vanilla oak flavors. The feel is quite smooth with a much more carbonated feel to it than I had anticipated. Very drinkable brew, I was quite pleased with not nearly as much bite as Arrogant Bastard. I have always been a big fan of the original Bastard and have never had much experience in oaked brews, but I actually prefer this over the original because of its drinkability.

It smells of pineapple, sweet mango, grapefruit, guava, caramel?, and some toasted malts. It has a medium to high bitterness with lots of tropical hops on the palate, contributing mango, guava, papaya, pineapple, and white grapefruit, with piney/green notes appearing later. In addition there are toasted/caramel malts and oak that is more of a presence than an actual flavor, along with perhaps some vanilla. The body is medium to thick with medium carbonation and a tannic dryness that begins light but becomes stronger, and it leaves a long finish. It is pretty drinkable, but perhaps I was expecting more. It is still a good beer, and one that utilizes hops nicely.

The aroma is pleasant. Oaky, for sure, but with some subtle hints of undetectable fruit. Maybe some vanilla, maybe some molasses? The taste is where the OAB shines, though. Malty and sweet up front, with definite oak notes. But the hops strike hard and fast, cutting through just about everything else and leaving a trail of grapefruit and pine down the back of the throat. Wow. What a lip-smacker this is. I really, really like the way this beer tastes. Sturdy, if not overwhelming mouthfeel. It's been a while since my last Arrogant Bastard, but I can't imagine why after having this one.

I paid $15.99 for a 6-pack, have enjoyed the regular AB in the past, love pretty much all the Stone offerings and have heard some pretty nice reviews (here and from friends); so maybe my expectations were a tad bit too high. I thought the oak imparted just too much of an astringent woodsy flavor -- I definitely get the sense that this somewhat harsh, acidic flavor came from oak chips rather than the more mellow experience that would come from barrels. Perhaps some aging will allow that caramel and vanilla flavor to come out more, and like I said, next time I'll try it a little bit warmer. Still a very good beer with the oak being an interesting addition, it's just not another awe-inspiring concoction from Stone. Either that or maybe I'm just not worthy.","Kendo","Jan 17, 2007"

An aroma of hops, caramel, vanilla and a hit of the wood chips. Overall, aroma is much more subdued than the regular and doesn't smack you in the face like it does. Don't know if that is the aging, wood chips or something else. The flavor was of malt, hops and burnt coffee. It has a medium body and and a slightly burnt quality to the finish.

The smell is strong alcohol mixed with some malty profile that could be anything, there is a nutty woody presence with of course plenty of hops in case. The hops seem more toned down but the oak flavor is a little to bite-y with the alcohol. It is a decent blend but I think it might need more time to mellow.

Aroma is hoppiness right up front, sweet caramelly malt undertones with a slight smoky woodiness, light notes of warming alcohol present as well. Taste starts off with sweet malts/ grapefruity and grassy hops, wood notes round off with the slight alcohol and dark fruitiness. Leaves a slightly bitter and drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick, almost a chewy beer, slick and viscous on the tongue that has a moderate level of carbonation which adds a lighter touch to the mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent, taste is great and has been executed wonderfully by the good folks at Stone.

The nose offers immediate hops, big, green, and citrusy. Lots of grapefruit, some subtle orange, all rounded out by woody oakness. The taste is like fresh squeezed orange juice for a second, then goes grapefruit on you. The hops and bitterness are pretty big, there must be some malt pulling it all back, but I don't really get it above all the citrus pith and the oak that hovers over the palate. There's even a flutter of strawberry bubble gum for a second. The finish is long, fruity, and bitter. The mouthfeel is dead on, good carbonation and smooth, slightly slick and oily on the finish.

At first musky grain was the only smell I was getting, but after letting it warm up a bit, I picked up on some nice peach and nectarine smells. Taste was big on hops up front, followed by the fruit characters in the background. There was also a certain bitter rye taste after swallowing, mixed with lingering warm alcohol. This is a pretty big beer to be honest, at least on the palate. I was a bit surprised that the alcohol content wasn't a bit higher. I could sit down with a six pack of these and probably finish them off in a night. Having said that, it was much mroe ejoyable sipping this one, and letting it warm a bit to get the full range of flavors and aromas.

The beer comes across much smoother, more delicate, and more compex. Almost a creamy flavor and texture (cotton candy).

The mouthfeel is very full and creamy, which I appreciate. Many beers sacrifice a full-body for the sake of drinkablility, but this is not one. The taste is a wonderfully complex mess. The bourbony oak flavor is pretty distinct, but far from overwhelming. The hops are very mellow, and I keep having to pinch myself to remind myself that I'm drinking Arrogant Bastard. The kick just isn't there; rather, there is a wonderfully complex taste that is nutty, fruity, and just overall delicious. While I'm not sure I could drink it all night, I consider this beer a treat. I have been very critical of the one-sidedness of regular Arrogant Bastard, but I find the Oak-Aged to be very good.","bignick","Apr 13, 2006"

Good caramel and toffe like flavors as in the original AB, but the hops are much softer, along with a slight smoky flavor. This is much more smooth than the original. The body seemed a bit lighter to me. Still very good, but lost some of the in your face hoppy character that I enjoy from the original.

The nose, unfortunately, was a bit more subdued than I expected -- perhaps from being served a little on the cold side? Anyway, Chinook vapors and roasted caramel malts wafted up, just not as strong as the non-oaked AB I've sampled. The taste is certainly that of the Bastard I know and love, yet different: softer, rounder, fruitier, more vanilla hints (the oak probably?) -- yet the brutal hops and malts abide. The mouthfeel on OAB is creamier and smoother. Medium bodied and chewy. I went back for more the other day and it was gone. :( Blessed nectar.","orfeu","Jan 20, 2006"

It was quite an educational experience, as far as what using oak can do to a beer. You could pick out all the character of the Arrogant Bastard, but with a little something extra. Our bottle poured with just a bit of haze and the lacing was thick and clumpy throughout. There was an earthy woodiness that melded nicely into the aroma and flavour, kind of filling in the gaps between the other characters. There was also a light vanilla flavour that was quite nice. The texture was creamy and smooth as silk. Overall, this is just a little better balanced and more complex than your garden variety Bastard (and I'm not knocking the original here) and definitely a treat.","DrJay","Jan 06, 2006"

4.22,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"The beer is quite tasty, but the oak is fairly subtle at this point. In the end this is a good thing, because if the oak was heavy handed it would really clash with the fresh, vibrant hoppiness that is characteristic of this beer. When paired with some Mexican food the Oak character really starts to become noticeable; it becomes much more woody with a pronounced buttery-oak type note in both the aroma and taste. But it still does not dominate the overall hoppy quality of this beer. This is a solid beer all around, and one which I enjoyed trying.","Gueuzedude","Dec 06, 2005"

Mango fruitiness, well contained oak and pepper peak through, but it fails to really impress due to a pronounced astringency and more acidity than Id like.

Sweet caramel and fruits with that arrogant bastard hoppiness backing it up. Very light woody notes as it warmed but they were minimal. Sweet caramel covered dark fruits over some bitter citric hops. Nice balance overall. Some woody notes were more apparent here than in the nose and seemed like it came out more than when I tried it fresh. Dry citric bitter fruity finish that sticks with you for awhile. It seemed a bit to mellowed at this point though. Pretty solid mouthfeel with good thickness and creaminess. I find the regular version to be more drinkable but this was still fairly easy to get through a bottle that big. Glad I drank it now because I cant see this getting better with more age.","meathookjones","Sep 30, 2005"

It is actually a settled down version of the original...all the tastes are a bit more subtle and add in a richer body and the wood and you have a gem.

4.42,5.2,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"As I poured the first glass, I had the impression that there would be no head, but it ended up forming a nice light and velevty head on an intense opaque amber brown color body. The smell is extraordinarily fresh and shows a great bouquet of red fruits with a very enjoyable sweetness. Also lighter hints of citrus, with a grapefruit character appearing slowly and getting deeper in the taste. Yeasty notes of vanilla appear after a while. The taste is way more aggressive than the smell. The very dry hoppiness invades and conquers the mouth with together with some oily notes. As for red fruits and citrus, their influence switched from the one they had in the smell: the once dominant red fruits notes are more subtles in the taste, as the grapefruity character took over. The aftertaste gets quite dry and grassy. The oaked aspect appears together with notes of cherry that create a slightly floury feeling on the tongue. Mouthfeel is enjoyably lighter than expected. Its complexity stimulates all the parts of the mouth and of the tongue. This surprizingly soft mouthfeel contributes to the great drinkability of theis character brew.","tjd25","Feb 17, 2005"
4.5,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Basically, I feel that the Bastard is already a full-throttle beer and the oak-aging is wasted on it. Sure, the oak is present (and it's drying, woody character does help to tone down and smooth the beast a bit), but does it really help to improve the character of the beer? I'd say not. It's different, but it's not better. And there's just too much going on to really enjoy the character of the wood (although it is oak-chips, right?). Good, but not great.","NeroFiddled","Jan 17, 2005"

The taste is hoppy and malty up front with some lovely oak notes and vanilla hints in the middle. The finish is slightly boozy, malty, hoppy, and oaky all at the same time. This is a lovely blend of flavors here. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, thick, bw, and cask-like and the drinkability is only hindered by the fact that this stuff will get you drunk all-too-fast.

I have to give the apperance/presentation a 5 because this bottle is so damn cool with the lock and all. The beer itself poured beautifully and looked exacctly like the ""un-Oaked"" Arrogant Bastard we poured side-by-side. A creamy, frothy head that cascades down the sides of the Arrogant Bastard flute-like glass. The head on the oaked AB lasted the entire glass and then some. Fluffy, soft bubbles formed a nice stiff heaed atop this beer. The aroma is hoppy and sweet but not nearly as stong with the hops as the regular AB. A bit of citrus in the nose as well. The flavor is smoky sweet with a burnt wood flavor. This beer is very very smooth. A lot of the hoppiness has mellowed out to make this a more malty tasting brew. Notes of currant, caramel, and mango fill in the flavor well. It is a slight bit thinner in the mouth but is still very velvety and smooth on the palate.

Once poured into a glass the body of the beer is a deep ruby brown, somewhat hazy, yet slightly translucent. The head is off-white with a yellow oiliness to it. This head is a champ when it comes to retention and lace and lasts through-out practically each entire glass adding to the overall experience. The aroma in the glass is lovely, hops are a bit downplayed when compared to the bastard in his original state, husky oak undertones and of course the dense caramelly goodness of the malt. The flavor totally corresponds, dense velvetty malts, subtle hints of husky oak, tiny pokes of vanilla flavor and dense piney hops. The oak aging process does wonderful things to the bastard...if only it weren't so damned expensive in this particular packaging, I'd still recommend getting one for the experience though.","FormatKid","Dec 06, 2004"

The finish is a great balance of hops with a hint of oak. The flavors just all come together in perfect harmony. The mouthfeel is extraordinary, so thick and so smooth. The drinkability is fantastic for a 7.2% brew. A damn near perfect beer. I wanted to give it a perfect 5, but I'm gonna hafta agree with Kevin here.

There's a pervasive oak character here but not the hop bitch-slap I'd expected from the Arrogant One. Flavor really threw me. I've had The Bastard before and this is nothing like it. Not nearly as boisterous in the hops and alcohol department. Lots of oaky character, with some residual sweetness on the palate. There's hops in here, but not nearly in the quantity I'd hoped. Finish is on the dry side. Mouthfeel is good but I wasn't blown away like I've been with other Stone beers.
