"3/26....pours reddish amber. Low foam, light on the bottom. Sweet caramel nose, bready, light cherry nose. Taste opens sweet, some astringent flavors. Borders on barleywine. Sharp bitter. Boozy. Very flavorful, but almost a wine/wiskey taste."

"O: Big decadent complex brew. I'm a fan."
""
"O:  Tatsty brew. An easy drinking sipper at an excellent price point."
"excellent offering from Lagunitas.  ""Strong Ale"" just about sums it up.  The balance between a barleywine style sweetness and a more hoppy offering is near-perfect.  Great sipper."

"Keg of eye ball drank."
""
"Taste is a funky sweet malt with light hop tones. A very sweet finish. Thick feel on tongue. Strong malty feel"
""
"Wow. Somehow fruity sweet *and* hoppy at the same time. Lovely mouthfeel and color. Would be a 5 but a bit cloying on the end."
""
""
"First review, should get another review after I add some beers."
""
""
""
""
"Feel: Full bodied, smooth, warm."
""
""
""
"Not too hoppy so it brings out the ABV in flavor a bit. Not too much, though"
""
"Overall: Still don't know that i'm a huge fan of the ""Strong Ale"" but this one is definitely growing on me."
""
""
"Had no expectations and was blown away. It's a fraction crisper than the best scotch ale out there (Bellhaven Wee Heavy). Taste is malty, caramel sublime."
"Beautiful Taste, Wasn't sure what to expect when cracking open this beauty. Smooth and Flavorful, Low key Soy Sauceish taste but I love it. Can't wait to purchase it again!"
""
""
"UPDATE: Got a 22 ounce bomber from Lambrecht's in Stevensville, Michigan for $4.99.  Still very good. Probably about a 4.00, but not as good as on tap."
""
""
""
"This is the best American Strong Ale I have had yet. Wish I could find it in a 6-pack instead of on tap."

"Pours a pretty mahogany brown in color with about a 1-finger foamy beige head. A good amount of sticky lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the glass. The aroma is of burnt brown sugar for the most part. The taste is pretty much the same actually with some roasted malts also with some spice. You really don't taste the alcohol in it. It will hit you after awhile though. Goes down pretty easy but is more of a sipper kind of brew then say, a chugging for sure. Not really much of a bitter or harsh aftertaste, or is the brew talking? ;) Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. You aren't drinking more than one of these at a sitting at all Overall, I liked it."
""
""
""
"Just an ok beer - nothing really special."
""
""
""
"Not my cup of tea. So take my review with a grain of salt. Tasted metallic and too boozy."
""
"Hairy Eyeball pours a dark amber color with a large lacing head.  There is a sweet, marshmellow like aroma.  The taste is also sweet, nice malty backbone with sweet dry fruit flavors.  Great body great flavors.  Overall a great drinkable complex beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm really enjoying the balance of this and I have to say I think it's seriously underrated."
"Overall, this is top notch.  For something so high in ABV, it's exceptionally easy to drink and goes down a bit too easy giving how strong it is.  I bought bombers of this for $6 a piece.  I stole them."
""
""
"Lots of raisin and some rum peach on the nose & the taste, a little boozey on the finish, nice medium bread maltiness to add some warmth."
""
""
""
"Had one that was a bit.... soy saucy.  It is Lagunitas so I am definitely willing to try it again."
""
"Still not entirely sure"
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Deep mahogany color with a thin white cap. Caramel aroma with hints of apple and cherry. More caramel and apple with a nice hop finish.  Medium to full bodied, bitterness lingers for awhile."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  An eyeball opening sweetheart of a beer.  Another great (and affordable) treat from Lagunitas."
"Very good beer. I'm always happy to buy bombers of most Lagunitas products because of their reasonable pricing policy on those products."
""
"Overall: This is a very solid strong ale/old ale. Its not as rich and complex as my favorites in the style, but its very tasty nonetheless. I dont get much alcohol at all as many on here suggest. Im impressed and think this is underrated, and prefer it to Brown Shugga."
"A wonderful American ale.  Nonsense with the reviews of boozey. Nice subtle malty flavor. Bit of brown sugar.  Good drinker.  Simple heh"

"2/4- Mo Dailey's (Norwood Park). I like strong beers, and this draft beer was very strong and I enjoyed this offering a lot. The taste was unique and the beer was very smooth. I really enjoyed the flavor.I will seek out this offering and other Lagunitas beers down the road, and I look forward to my next Hairy Eyeball, well maybe not literally but definitely served by Lagunitas. Well done!"

"Poured a gorgeous clear reddish brown body with a half-finger of off-white head. A very appealing looking rich strong ale. Scents of rich malt, caramel, dark fruit with notes of plum, red cherry, prune and raisin, candied, liquor-soaked fruit and fruitcake. Cherry predominates the fruit aromas with a bready malt aroma also present and hints of brown sugar. Overall impression of aroma is of a sweet, rich, malty beer with a nice rich fruitcake-like aroma lent by the alcohol and the profile of the fruity esters. Quite nice and very appealing as a Winter ale. Flavor begins sweet and malty with notes of caramel, sweet bready malt, fruitcake, cherry, raisin and prune. The middle opens up flavors of alcohol and light chocolate malt flavors. Finish is medium-sweet, with notes of alcohol and dark fruit, with further notes of fruitcake and preserved fruit, but with a light bitterness from roast and toasted malt lending a roasted malt and slightly burnt toast flavor and hints of dark chocolate. Aftertaste is lightly bitter with notes of alcohol, dark chocolate, black coffee and roasted malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very malt-forward, dark fruit heavy, sweet initial flavor, giving way to a bitter finish that keeps the beer from being cloying. Very nice, warming and pleasant, a good ale for a cold Winter night. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with medium-light carbonation and a sticky, rich feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good strong ale, warming, rich and full, but not overwhelming. Overall this is a fantastic strong ale. It has a wonderfully rich and sweet aroma that is a wonderful mix of malt and esters. This carries over into the flavor but is aided by roast malt lending a richer, deeper, darker flavor. The mouthfeel is a nice balance between rich and full, and modest and drinkable. A very fine ale all around and well worth drinking."
""
"Overall, a decent beer, but a little boozy for my liking.. You can really tell there is booze in this thing.. Given the price, it's totally worth it for the little bit of boozy feeling you get from it.  I think I paid $5 for a bomber."
"O - 4.50 - A good brew. This seems more like a food pairing brew to me than a standalone experience. Would work wonderfully with smoked and braised meats. I recommend giving this one a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you like big fruity sweet malty beers you will enjoy this reminds me a lot of fresh Old Stock Ale.  Old Stock Ale ages like a champ takes on nice notes of toffee and vanilla this beer intrigues me it may do the same."
"Malt, Malt, and Malt are up front with this beer."

"A good description  of this beer is hard to find. And I didn't succeed  either ."
"Pours dark brown with caramel colors"
"Despite this beer being a little hard-to-pin down style-wise, and overall fairly idiosyncratic, I think is quite a good brew. If anything, the mystery aspect adds points in my books. I haven't tasted anything quite like it. It's very complex. Also, it seems to be a great value. Got a bomber for only $4.79."

"I don't visit the strong ale variety much, but this beer tastes fine. From Lagunitas, I'm not too surprised."
"Not sure what an outlier is or why it was detected. I have to justify my rating with a review. So here's the review...this beer rocked. Period."
""
"1 pint, 6 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a deep amber that reflects almost red if held to the light. Head is dark brown and small. It recedes quickly with no lacing. Smell is a bit muted but I get bread, caramel, toffee, and maple, maybe a hint of vanilla. Reminds me of a old ale a bit as it warms. Taste is malty and toasted with some rich caramel and maple coming through again. Some sweet dark fruit in there that reminds me of raisins. There are some bitter hops on the end but just enough to clean up the sweetness that presents in the middle. Finish is dry and slightly bitter from the hops. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and sticky but doesn't linger. Dangerously sippable given a 9.1% ABV. Overall it doesn't blow me away but I can't come up with any glaring flaws either other than maybe the nose could be more prominent. A very nice American Strong Ale worth a look."

"Taste reminds me a little of a Belgian ale. Malt up front with some sweet fruit. No booze in the taste. Very smooth."

"Excellent strong ale.  Well balanced with a sweetness coming from both malt and yeast. Potentially dangerous."
""
""
"Poured out of a bomber into a mug, chilled.  Was good, very good, but could have been a little stronger in my opinion.  Some flavors were mute."
""
"Very good strong ale! Great!"
""
"Malty malty malty. With a roasted finish. Smell and taste caramel. Copper in color with a light off-white head, which fades quickly."
"Poured into my teku glass."
""
""
"Lots of malt and kind of sweet."
""
"Looks deep amber, but not quite red.  Smells chocolatey? What the fuck? Some sweet malt.  Not at all what I was expecting. The taste is caramel, some more of that chocolate, maybe a faint resemblance of hops on the aftertaste. Nice creamy mouthfeel, Yum!"
""
"Overall, an exceptionally smooth, full flavored ale that is deceiving in its strength.  Great pick for the coldest day of the year."
"Smell is good not a huge fan of the taste."
""
""
"A little sweet,but very good beer"
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious. Smooth and way too easy to drink."
""
"Dark sugar nose, light fruit, molasses with some spice. Pours clear dark amber with a 1” very finely bubbled, lightly tan tinted white foam cap that leaves rich lace. The beer is clean with no particles or sediment floating in the body. A big malty palate with a malt spiciness that suggests cola and anise and yeast driven fruit flavors, primarily plum or other dark red fruit. A big bitter finish answers a malty sweet beginning. In the end, malt, yeast, hops, and alcohol come into balance. A pleasant alcohol warming on the finish hints at the amount of alcohol in the beer. The beer is big and chewy, almost oily, with a moderate carbonation."
""
""
"There were some interesting comments in other reviews. No, ageing this would not make it mellow. It would get too sweet. The comment that it is like a fully realized ESB is right on. Americanized. As usual with Lagunitas, this is very worthwhile. Get it while you can."
""
""
"Great beer from Lagunitas."
"Strong, sweet, deep, ruddy-reddish brown, and smoothly bitter, this perihelial release is big and rich, but also only a bit syrupy and largely fairly restrained.  Compared to a lot of Strong Ales, this actually pretty light: certainly not buoyant, but thinner than many, and less dark in its malt-profile and color.  Somehow ""Hairy Eyeball"" seems apt—but I'm not entirely sure I can articulate how.  Mostly, however, it's just very drinkable for a big-abv, malt-sugary ale; and—while it's definitely the stuff of chill winter-eve drinking—it hits its marks and does its job."
"Can't say this is one of my favs from lagunitas, but it's not bad.  Fruity but with a strong flavor component that's heavy on the alcohol.  Seems a bit lost and confused, busy but lacking focus. I suppose my extreme love for hop stoopid could be affecting my opinion here, as they are very different beers."

"lagunitas hairy eyeball: great tasting, would not hurt to buy and let sit for a year or two to become very potent. Has a brownish/redish hue. Nice head that dies down pretty moderately. Taste very bourbon like and you can smell it. It taste more than a  9.4 ABV beer. As stated above, would not let this sit no more than 1 or two years, actually, a year and half. Overall still great, would buy another one."
""
""
"Overall I liked it and prefer it over Arrogant Bastard"
""
""
"O - I have an idea of what they are aiming for, but I think they need better integration.  The sweetness upfront and the bitterness in the back both come on a bit strong.  It makes for a good, but not a great beer."
""
"Very yummy but after two pints I looked up the ABV and decided to stop as I was the driver!!!  Had a Great time dancing and no hangover!!!!"
""
""
"Just a big ol' fruitcake, rich with big notes of ripe figs, burned banana peels and malts. Beautiful ruby colored with a not big but thick and creamy head."
""
""
"O: I'm so used to drinking Lagunitas's hop forward beers that something like this catches me by surprise; nice complex flavors and aromas;"

"Drinking like an English ale.  Interesting departure from the typical Lagunitas  offerings."

"Another great beer from a top notch brewery. Malt forward but has hops and drinkable as fuck. Lagunitas never rips you off on price for high grav brews."
""

"Overall: Excellent and under $4 for a bomber. This has a lot of flavor and the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Nice sipper."

"Overall - This is what I think of for a winter ale - the flavors are perfect, bold, complex and balanced. Such an excellent and potent example of the style. I highly recommend that you get a few bottles of this and share with family and friends during the holidays. Perfection. Two thumbs way up, thank you Lagunitas."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/7/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light chocolate, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light chocolate, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy hop/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, dark fruits, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome American strong ale style! All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malts, dark fruits, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This one is growing on me. At first try I didn't like it. Too sweet. I've had it a few times now and it's got a great malt profile and has plenty of hop to break up the malt flavor. I'm a fan."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a stemless wine glass. Sweet, malty and slightly bitter hop beer. A cross between a Scotch Ale and Winter Warmer if I were to categorize."

"Aroma is full of caramel malt and floral hops, with booze and hints of citrus. Toasted, nutty notes pale in comparison to the sweetness. Fruity specialty malt and dark notes of raisin and fig are reminiscent of brandy. Flavor reveals a fairly sweet caramel malt backbone, which begins with contrasting vinous notes and finishes exceedingly bitter. As it warms, notes of chocolate and lightly roasted malt add complexity, along with nutmeg and ginger in the aftertaste. Very interesting brew, but lacks a bit in depth of malt character."
""
""
"Yeast and malt jump out in the nose of this, the 2014 edition of Hairy Eyeball. That yeastiness follows through with a slight bit of hops riding backseat. Not much head but as it fades into a partly cloudy condition with faint lacing on the side, it will linger and give you pretty formations to grok over. Amber to red appearance with a sort of plum to dark cherry nearly currant kind of fruitiness that perks up as your mouth gets over the alcohol burn and residing mid level bitterness. Long for pucker that does not really recede. This is a sipper of a beer that would probably handle getting some barrel treatment eerily well and turn that 9.X abv up a notch and fill in with staves of goodness.  This would probably cellar like a beast as well and give you a really nice barleywine towards the first cold snap of 2015."
""
""
"I do not like dark beers (and I know, this isn't even that dark!), so this was a bit different for me.  Very flavorful, very malty.  I probably won't get it again, but I wouldn't be unhappy if it was served to me."

"My pour produced a brief finger of light-tan head that quickly fell to wisps. Nose was kind of boozy with a strong dried dark fruitiness, like prunes, raisins and dates. Color was a Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium. The first thing that I noticed after taking a sip was the intense fusel alcohol heat. The second thing was the extreme fruitiness and maltiness that came right behind it, reminiscent of a holiday fruitcake. Finish was warm, not outright hot, and incredibly fruity."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very malt-forward for lagunitas.  There is some complexity and with a full body this beer is quite drinkable.  A great beer for the malt-heads out there."
""
"Served from 20 or so oz. bottle into large beer glass which was frozen. Pours a great head, medium lacing. Appearance is very dark (the darker the better).. The first sip packs a wallop - strong alcohol content paired with a rich, creamy taste that keeps you sipping. There is a subtle hoppy background. Delicious to the last bubbly drop. So far this is my favorite beer of the few I've had. I would drink it over and over again. Very well done from Lagunitas. Overall, I would highly recommend this brew to anyone who enjoys the darker variety."

"Deep garnett in color with good clarity. Poured with a short, dense, off-white foam that quickly dissipated. Sweet malt, brown sugar, raisin and fig aromas with boozy notes in the background. Full bodied with tangy, assertive carbonation through the middle and a semi-dry finish. Sweet bready malt, dark fruit, fig and raisin flavors up front. Tangy, lightly spicy hop bitterness through the middle. Definitive booziness toward the end as well. Finished with a semi-dry feel and lingering bready malt and  herbal hop bitterness. This was excellent and, to me, drank a lot like an ale version of a doppelbock."

"Pours a coppery brown with 2F cream head. Nice lacing all the way down. Smells strongly of caramel malt with some esters and a tease of vanilla. More sweet malt with very mild piney hops followed by medicinal tones and a very sweet finish. Some late tobacco and vanilla aftertaste. More syrupy feeling than I typically enjoy, but the correction for that would turn the medicinal tones astringent. It's no Arrogant Bastard, but very good nonetheless."

"D - This is a very good beer... A malt bomb that leaves me wanted more... Surprisingly quaffable... I can't say a single bad thing about the beer itself... Also a bargain given the sub $6/bomber price tag... My only minor complaint is that this one comes in bombers... It's a lot a beer for one person... I would certainly buy a lot more if this were available in 12oz bottles..."

"awfully good beer for the price right here, under 5 bucks a bottle, this strong, impressive from the brewery who always frustrates me with the same yeast profile. its not so evident in this one, more of a belgian or a high gravity ale yeast profile, clean and highly attenuated stuff, not the usual from these guys on the yeast front, finally. not as dark as expected in color, looks like an english nut brown, smallish head too is short lived. the nose is caramel heavy, with some cherry and banana yeast notes, as well as some medium roast cocoa and a little residual sugar. the flavor is beautifully rich, a nice juxtaposition to its appearance, with heavy burnt or burning sugar flavors and a vanilla candy finish. great bubbles and i can still taste the grain, which makes this for me. confused on the yeast front, which is better than the typical lagunitas safe realm, but its undecided. shockingly strong, i would have guessed 7% abv before i saw the label. not sure how they can keep putting out beer this good for such a fair price, but the more of these bombers the better. great stuff, really."

"Mahogany brown color with a trace of beige head. Brussels lacing. Good clarity. Lush dark malt flavor with a very smooth and bone dry body. This starts off a bit on the sweet side and is quickly put in check by the faint bittering hops. This the most reserved bit of hopping by Lagunitas. Aroma of sweet dark malt is a bit reserved."

"Taste is robust and definitely packs an alcohol wallop. There's even a slight burn. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and light, despite the heavy alcohol. Lots of sweet malt, some grapefruit hops, and tons of juicy citrus and tropical fruit."
""
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of malts. Taste is alcohol, malts, some sweetness, boozy, a touch if breadiness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall isn't bad, but a bit disappointing."
""
"Overall: Malty sweet bread and toffee taste and aroma that balances with an appropriate bitterness. Good version of strong ale and price point was good. A bit boozy, will have again."

"The beer pours a deep, rich mahogany with hints of rich amber, ruby, and brown. The beers with a head of medium sized, off-white/nearly-yellow bubbles that sit a healthy fingers width above the beer once they settle down, and leave a nice medium width lacing along the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is nearly too dark to see through, but is crystal clear and clean of any sediment or particles. On the nose, the beer smells tamely of toffee and caramel malt. There are touches of biscuits and rustic bread thrown in, but overall the nose is subtle sweet malt, which is surprising given the ABV. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet, nearly cloying, with a fizzle of hot booze on the edges. Dark fruit sweetness is very prominent from the malts, and subtle acidity does work its way into the corners of the mouth, but bitterness is subtle to none-existent in the mouth. In flavor, the beer begins as rich toffee and bread malt, working its way towards oatmeal bread, then caramel. Sweeter caramel and booze enter towards the finish and carry a middling-length finish of raisin bread and caramel, almost like a bread pudding. The aftertaste is light, spicy booze and sweet malt caramel. A touch of stale bread runs across the palate. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium in body, with a middling carbonation that does put a nice tickle on the tongue. Mouthfeel is crisp, slightly syrupy, and a bit prickly. When the beer leaves, the mouth is left sticky with malt sweetness and a little river of saliva in the cheeks. Overall, this is a nice simple strong ale/barleywine/old ale/what is the difference between those styles, really? This beer treads on the maltier side of the tracks, and carries a supreme drinkability, which is dangerous given the ABV. It doesn’t hit me over the head with any intense or decadent flavors, but merely provides good flavor and warmth to the belly. This is a perfect sipper after dinner, as it will not weigh the belly down too much. A nice beer."

"This beer is sticky sweet with a great mouthfeel heavy lace and overall great appearance and smell, the alcohol content is superb and compliments the overall experience. The taste is orange like but not overwhelming a nice strong ale. Nice Job Lagunitas."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Meh its an ok offering, I remember now why I havent bothered writing a formal review when I had it before."

"Overall - Good beer. Lots of interesting characteristics. Fruity but not citrus, roasty but not overwhelming. Seek one out and see for yourself. Wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm not dissipointed."
""
""
""
"O- Nice beer, deep and rich but really only one note. The ABV doesn't need to be this high for a beer like this and actually kinda hurts it. I really like how the color sets it apart from other strong ales."
""

""
""

"O: Fairly complex and rewarding. A different direction than the hop heavy, yet delicious, offerings from Lagunitas. The bready aftertaste and alcohol linger, but are not overpowering. 9.4%ABV. Give this brew a try!"

"Overall: Very interesting brew, tasty. Very unique"

"O: Just okay. This beer is huge and not screwing around, but it's just a little too medicinal and syrupy for what it is, probably as a consequence of its ABV. I probably will not revisit this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark amber with good lacing. The smell is light coffee and sweet cream. The taste is super roasty with chocolate and coffee notes followed by a creamy after taste. This beer feels smooth and hides the alcohol well. Overall I was quite surprised by the flavor on this one and I liked it better than most Lagunitas strong ales."
""
""
"o - another winner from lagunitas and at this price it's hard to beat."
""
""
""
"Overall a very enjoyable strong brown ale. Can't beat the price point at $5.99 for a 22oz bomber."

"O - I like this beer a lot, it is a refreshing change of pace from the hop monsters I have been pounding down as of late. It reminds me a lot of an English-style Barleywine, just tuned down a notch."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall an outstanding Perennial Release from Lagunitas that adds some much needed variety to their landscape of brews. I'd buy it again if they release it next year, but once is enough for now."
"While on the surface this beer seems to be malt-forward, it has an unmistakable Lagunitas-style hoppiness that all the brewery's beers seem to be endowed with. This is a complex, unique, and delicious amalgamation of hoppiness and maltiness. It's like some twisted cross between a Belgian strong dark ale, an American barleywine, and a double ipa. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a goblet. This dark ale is a reddish brown color, not quite opaque but dark, with ample tan head. Aroma is dominated by malty toffee notes, with a light fruitiness like apples, a hint of chocolate brownie, and some hop resins that serve to offset the heavy sweetness. Unlike many Lagunitas brews where the hops lead the way, this is a dark malt bomb, rich and quite sweet, although the hops still lurk in there to provide a resinous bitterness. Tastes like burnt brown sugar, raisin cake and toffee, with these sweet baked flavors co-existing with a dark fruit undercurrent that evokes prunes and sourish cherry juice. I also get some herbal licorice root. Quite boozy as well, some fusels to help you remember that this is a big brew ... Pace yourself. Body is unexpectedly on the thin side but the sugars and hop resins do coat the mouth. Finish is long and lingering like most Lagunitas brews, with a fruity undercurrent like in the middle section hiding beneath burnt sugar and earthy bitter hops. Gives me a decent buzz and the low level of carbonation enhances this problem. If I am forced to compare, I prefer Lagunitas' hop-centric offerings and the alcohol is aggressive, but I did sign up for this and it remains one of my favorite winter ales. Put this shit in those casks around St. Bernard dogs' necks, damn the spirits."

"O: The mouthfeel really hurts this beer. You get a quick look at the flavors but then they are gone just like that."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"The Hairy Eyeball is a highly decadent ale that doesn't simply pair well with cake desserts, it serves to replace them altogether. Accompaniments of stilton, dried fruit and assorted nuts would make for the most divine closure to any premium dinner."

"My first dissapointment from Lagunitas. This ale pours a gorgeous amber brown color with a generous white head that lasts throughout the pour. The aroma is malty, herbaceous, and boozy. It sips thicker than expected. Medium to full bodied. Definitely coats the mouth. The flavor is very malty and almost cloyingly sweet. There is an awful lot of booze bite to this one and little to no hop presence at at all to balance the alcohol and malt. Not a bad beer by any means but not what I have come to expect from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
"The is the most overly malty ale I have ever had and I'm a fan of Lagunitas. It's way off in balance and I've tried it 3 times thinking I got an older bottle, it's under carbonated and just to dang sweet. It's just not a good beer for them and others are rating it because it's Lagunitas and not what it should be rated at. Sorry it's just not that good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice, full bodied, scotch like brew."
""
""
"Overall: I like the sweet taste of this beer, i just feel it needs a bit more balance. I expected a fairly larger hoppiness coming from lagunitas and was slightly disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The hops were a little too bitter/tannic for my tastes but not unbearable. The hops also compensated for for the common sweetness found in the style. Take the good with the bad. Not likely that I will get this again, but definitely worth a try."
"D: A pretty nice malt forward beer on the cheap but not a favorite from Lagunitas. Fairly nice balance but not all that in depth. Would take Brown Sugga over this any day."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear dark brown/ruby red color with an inch tan head that sticked around a while. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, dark fruit, brown sugar, nuts, and molasses. It tastes like dark fruit (raisins, plums, red grapes), caramel, nuts, grainy malt, toffee, molasses, and some light hops and booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky, but also smooth and easy to drink. I liked this brew, but then I've liked most if not all of the Lagunitas beers I've had. $5.99 a bomber."
""
"Overall a good beer that is nice to have once a year as it’s very complicated even though it’s malt dominant – the malt version of a DIPA that allows the malt bill to bring out different flavors and hide the ABV. This is the second bomber I drank this winter and both times I pretty much got wrecked from the bomber as the booze sneaks up on you, which is nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Why does it seem like everything Lagunitas does that isn't hop-forward is just OK? You could almost call them a one trick pony...but I won't cuz they're still awesome. This beer drinks easy enough but is just lacking character."
""
""
"I could drink this a lot."
""
"Not for every day drinking, but perfect taking some nice sips while enjoying whatever you enjoy."
""
""
""
"Very interesting strong ale and certainly worth the price. Just not the best from the folks in Chico."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer falls short. It is a little too sweet and has a funky aroma, and not in a good way. I think I'll pass next time."

"VERY GOOD; GIVE IT A GO!"
""
""
"Overall: A very solid malt driven brew. Good toasty and bready malt taste with some nice dark fruit undertones. A lot like a Doppelbock."
""
"Overall- Some may find the flavour to be a bit cloying, but for me, I think it is a well balanced sweetness. An enjoyable American Strong Ale sipper."
""
"B-"
"Overall: Definitely a good, but not quite great brew. The initial metallic taste was kind of odd and unexpected, but luckily does little to detract from an otherwise good beer. Definitely a sipper given its alcohol content; maybe something worth sharing on a winter day. Seems a lot like a barleywine to me..."
""
"O - You definitely feel the 9.4% ABV. An enjoyable beer and I look forward to having another sometime soon."
""
"It's dark brown with no real head or lacing. It's basically crystal clear. Seems flat, but the look of it. There's a nice bubblegum scent there. It's smokey with a sweet candy taste, true to the scent. It's a strong, full-bodied ale. Bold alcohol. A bit too bold...quite frankly, but a real nice drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: surprisingly un-hoppy for Lagunitas, tasty if in a malty mood"
""
""
""
""
"Easier to drink than a few other examples of the style (Arrogant Bastard comes to mind) and well worth the purchase if you want to go beyond the usual cycle of IPA-DIPA-IPA (like myself)."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - A very good example of an american strong ale. If you see this you are fortunate and should buy it. If you don't like high alcohol beers, I would stay away from it because the alcohol warming is the biggest piece of this beer, otherwise it is a good one to have. One top of that it taught me a new word ""Perihelial"" because the label says it is the Perihelial Release. Look it up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A departure from what I expect from both Lagunitas and American strong ales. Not necessarily bad but surely different. But it's cheap enough that I might grab another bottle to age and possibly enjoy in a year or two as the English barleywine I think it wants to be."
""
""
""
"The alcohol is obvious, but only strong support as it licks the roof of the mouth reminding you, eh, ""strong?"""
""
""
""
""
""
"O Ahh, with this one I don't really know. I love it one moment and dislike it the next. The first sip when cold was bad. Way too sweet. However it did smooth out when it warmed. Just seemed like too much of everything (malt, hops, coffee, rye, toffee, booze) that it all conflicted with the others. I wouldn't say it was bad, but I wouldn't say it was great. Just a middling brew. No knock on Lagunitas here. I dig a lot of their brews but this one isn't my fave. This may be pretty interesting with a year, maybe two, on it."
""
"What a great beer and just like all Lagunitas gems, very reasonably priced. At $3.99 for a bomber this is amazing and will buy again, you should too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance is a deep red amber with a two finger head, but the appearance is probably the best part of the beer. There isn't much aroma at all. The taste Is largely a malty sweetness of caramel and bit of berry fruit taste. There is a slight hop presence, but the malt definitely is the main part of this beer. Overall this beer is good, but this runs on the sweeter side and needs something to balance it out. Worth giving a try considering its only 5 bucks. (76/100)"
"O- a great winter ale, giving all the spice and Christmas crap a miss"
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was decent. For a strong ale, I couldn't detect too much alcohol (in a good way). The creaminess of this beer was great but the lack of wanting another sip knocked this down a notch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the more complex offerings from Lagunitas, very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I dont know what everyone else is drinking but this one is outstanding. Beautiful color, big malty aroma followed by big malty taste. Apples and pears, not very hoppy. Thats ok and I wonder if the lack of overbearing hops influences the lower scores a bit. Perfect for this time of year, great mouthfeel, easy drinking, yet packs one helluva punch. Delicious."
"O - I'm not at all impressed with this beer. Lagunitas says this a beer you'd reach for on a hungover morning. I'd imagine so, if one wanted to evacuate anything consumer from the night before. Not a great candidate for a Strong Ale. Seriously...what's with all of the hype with this brewery?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is met in the first sip by a sharp bite of alcohol. It doesn't achieve medicinal or fusel but it's sharp. Then you notice a syrupy sweetness. Subsequently it smooths out a bit. The taste is dark caramel. brown sugar, syrup, it could a have a nutty presence but is shy and a spice character that's heavy. The drink is slow and sluggish and it does not travel the palate well. The carbonation is not enough to lighten the sticky syrupy body. The finish is a slightly bitter, a hodepodge of spice and sweet fruit and a reminder of that alcohol and some warmth. Astringent int he finish and a bit flat . overall it lacks luster and courage. It's unctious,and a bit cloying. I think this is just ok."
""
""
"O - Mild and subtle all around. Decent flavors, but nothing memorable or complex."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a little too bitter for my taste, but it's a good winter beer. I'm into the dark fruit. I'd get it again."
""
"Not a favorite from Lagunitas but it's alright and the price points are usually a great aspect."
""
"O- I'm grading this as it tasted cold. The warmer it got, the less I liked it. The booze just became too prominent as it warmed. This beer is pretty complex with tons of different flavors going on. the ABV is never really hidden, but the flavors are good enough to distract you for a while. I can't say I'll ever have it again, but I recognize quality when I taste it."

"reading the other reviews of the past, I wonder if the recipe has changed. regardless, there are not many beers which are so totally toxic they do not deserve a 'decent' rating... let's call it a 'winter warmer' although it's still 72 degrees out at 5pm here on SoCal..."
"Served out of a 22 oz bottle on a cold foggy night in Boise. I thought the 9.4 alc would warm up the evening and it did. Dark amber with red highlights. Medium head, firm but collapsed quickly. Dark roasted malts, linger on the palette. Alcohol whispers through the hint of fruit. The near sweetness of barleywine but not quite. Do I taste oak? Close, it muses with the barrel but never delivers. On glass down, the frozen fog outside does not seem quite as cold. A very good winter tale. Cheers Nice story on the bottle's side panel."
""
""
""
""
"Would have again; worth trying (especially if Christmas beers, et al. are your thing)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Like the aroma, the taste begins with a full barley malt character almost akin to a Barleywine with a subtle sweetness balancing off the the boozy finish. Hops linger at the end but so does a molasses-like sweetness. Interesting but I wonder how it would be after it cellared for a few months."

"O: A good winter beer. I wouldn’t rush out for more, but I wouldn’t turn it down if offered to me either. Better at cellar temp than refrigerator temp."
""
""
""
""
"A tough one for me grade. It was certainly tasty, but nothing particularly shined for me with this one."
"Overall, this is a very unique strong ale. With all the malty sweetness, it leans more towards the barleywine end of things, but it's tasty and very drinkable for 9%. A great winter beer."
""
"O: It's sort of an American version of an old ale with a prominent malt presence but a firm hops bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I say this beer is an enhanced brown ale. The alcohol is present and the body is slightly cloying."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sort of an odd beer, like a stout-American barleywine hybrid."
""
"Mouthfeel is a little flat, thinnish, not very sticky. A little oily or slick. Overall, it's certainly not bad, but it's not exciting."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very malty beer. Sweet, not much in the hops department. If I was given this blind I would say it was a one-note take on an abbey dubbel. It is a pretty beer. Garnet color with thick off-white head, but that is easily the strongest aspect of the beer. Unfortunately, appearance is also the least important aspect of beer enjoyment. Rare failure from lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, slight fruit, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with strong malt and slight caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a strong emphasis on the malt aspect all around."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was outstanding for a strong ale at this price, and with this level of availability...I mean, I didn't even have to go to BevMo for this, it was at the local Ralph's grocery store."
"O - the first time I had this I was not a fan, but it is pretty good. Seems like a wee heavy of sorts with the huge malt flavors."
""
""
"Pour slow because the head foams up fast. Easy sipping brew with not much of an after taste. The bottle goes down very easy with some delicious caramel notes. overall a great buy that i would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a brownish amber with a one inch off white head that leaves behind lots of lace. Smell is very powerful rum soaked raisins, alcohol, burnt brown sugar, toffee, and turpentine. Taste is all of that, but better than the nose would have you expect, balanced nice. Body is medium large, nice carbonation, a touch dry, and a bit of a sipper. This is solid, I would say taste like a old ale to me, but that is subjective."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But at roughly $5/bomber, it packs a nice punch and the booze is pretty well hidden, present only at the finish where it, coupled with the hops, coats the palate in a cool, oily slickness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is great beer especially for the holiday season. And the high ABV pairs nicely with the snow we're getting in New England!"
""
""
""

"Overall: Very good beer, should be re-classified as an Imperial Winter Ale, has slight spiciness properties feel like your drinking a mellow gingerbread cookie. So if you're thinking what I'm thinking you would best pair this gem with your favorite dessert."

"Pours a brilliant reddish brown color with a decent sized creamy off white head that shows moderate retention and a fair amount of lace. An almost artificial smelling fruity nose with lots of grape, cherry, and tangerine. Brown sugar, caramel and hints of yeast esters play supporting roles. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is quite complex actually. Sweet and sugary up front mixed with grape dimetapp and a hint of wet cardboard. A hint of earthy hop flavor mixed with a bit of alcohol comes through next as do some quad like yeasty flavors. Lingering dark sugar drizzled cherries long after each sip. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Odd brew for sure, it took me a bit to figure it out, and it was somewhat drinkable. Probably wouldn't seek out again, but glad to try it."

"Color is pretty much beer bottle brown. Quite strong at 9.4% ABV. This beer is malty with hints of cooked brown sugar and molasses yet the sweetness is quite well reserved. Lots of dark fruit and fig like flavors give this beer quite a bite. Overall it has a strong roasty flavor and smell. This is a good cold weather beer due the high ABV and the dark autumn like flavors."

"Poured out of a 22 into a pint glass. This is a big dark malty beast, should have expected as much from Lagunitas's winter ale. A bit syrupy, little to no head, dark brown color. Very nice toasty caramel malt smell, creamy mouthfeel, but a little too much umami/soy sauce for my liking in the aftertaste. The taste is very fruity/biting though, reminds me of Ninkasi Total Domination IPA that way, with the combo of a little grapefruit-like tang and dark umami malt. Overall a good brew, but not really my favorite style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Fruits, sweet malts, and bitter herbal hops blend well together with notes of grape juice, apple juice, tobacco, caramel, chocolate. It's like an IPA and Stout in one beer. As the beer warms it feels like a light imperial stout."

"O: This is a damn good beer. At 3.70 a bomber after tax this is a great deal I can see my self buying this as long as I can find it. I recommend this to everyone who is a fan of the style."
"O- A tasty beer with a lot of complexity on the nose and palate. The alcohol burn is there, so I'd like to stash a bottle or tow of this and allow the booze to settle and the other flavors to come to the forefront. Still, I loved this beer."
""
"Overall - Officially an American Strong Ale by categorization, though I'd be partial to calling it an Imperial Brown, based on flavor alone. Similar to its sister brew Brown Shugga, though not as sweet or abrasive. All in all,, for 9% it comes across as a damn approachable, drinkable brew. Will buy again."

"Overall: An interesting experiment with this beer at this point. The barley has no doubt become the strong accent and drinks a lot like a barleywine. I would love to try a fresh bottle of this and see how the traditional Lagunitas hop presence being more active would change this brew."

" The taste is great, lots of malt layers with subtle toast and an almost bready yeast underneath the slight fruitiness with a hint of dark sugar and a mild pepper-like taste up front which is a bit of alcohol taste yet there is a mild pine flavor which I am guessing is hop derived. The bitterness level seems to present itself more as it warms with a nice chewy malt flavor and slight dark caramel taste coming in later. The alcohol is very mild in the taste..I only noticed it halfway into the bomber, but it enhances the flavor I am sure since there is a fresh raisin-like element that adds to the light roasted malt flavors. I would drink this again for sure since the value for such a quality beer at a great price is usually a no-brainer. I consider this one of the better strong brown ales I have had recently."
"D/O: This beer follows the blueprint for a very ordinary American strong ale, but does so effectively. It exhibits some semblance of balance, with hops and malt each evident to some degree. That said, it is the malt influence that is most appealing and memorable."

"Pours a dark red brown amber with a light tan head that dissipated to a thin film. Aroma of bready malt, dark fruit, sweet. Lots of flavor; malt, light and dark fruits, vanilla, but but somewhat subdued. Almost like a lightly flavored barley wine; subtle, but complex. Quite different. The thick, creamy body and pleasant overall taste are excellent. A second bottle had more assertive flavors. A great American strong ale."
"For a strong ale, this is a massively sweet & creamy beer. Loads of caramel, toffee and other sticky sweets come through on the nose and tongue. It's slightly boozy, but not bad for a 9%. There is a slight hop bitterness there, although I imagine with time a bottle of this would turn out similar to their Olde Gnarlywine. Another solid entry from this brewery."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost like root beer. Thin off-white head settles to a nice ring and swirls of haze. Big, malt-forward aromas of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, booze, and some residual hop bitterness. Something like a cross between a Barleywine and a big Brown Ale. Taste is similarly malt-heavy, with more sweet toffee, brown sugar, and caramel, some roasted nuts, baked brown bread, and some slightly grassy hops. Very signature of a Lagunitas brew. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall a solid stab at a maltier beer from Lagunitas. While I enjoyed it, I doubt I'd pass up a Little Sumpin' Sumpin' for it."

"O- Pretty tasty beer that I remember being much hoppier when fresh. A year has turned this into a barleywine/old ale of sorts. I might go back and pick up some more bottles to see if the alcohol will fade with some more age."

"Clear dark rusty color. Dense khaki head that holds nicely. Smells malty, and very boozy. Its an older bottle, it was the last one at the store and quite dusty. I think it tastes so much better than is smells. Really smooth and creamy for a 9%er. Yeast flavor it similar to other Langunitas beers, floral and fruity. Tastes like American hops, citrusy and pungent. Lots of caramel and grainy base flavor. Pretty unique, like Old Ales I've had but American in character."

"M: The Eyeball has one of the best feels I've ever experienced. I wish every beer had such an interesting and balanced MF. Thick and coating and creamy and warm, yet highly drinkable, with a perfect amount of muted carbonation."

"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the unique fruitiness, especially for the style. The malt profile was also interesting, as it started lighter and paler, and moved to an almost stouty mouth. A negative, however, was how overly boozy the finish seemed. If not for the nice balance from the rest of the flavoring it would have made this one a bit hard to handle."

"Something about this beer simply failed to connect for me. Moderately turbid chestnut with off-tan head. Up front a big dose of malty sweetness that was reasonably well restrained. Hops followed in a feeble attempt to breach the malt and then fell back after an initial rebuff. Malt rebounded and carried through the finish with a bit of a watery aspect. There was a consistent metallic note throughout. Overall, the effect was that of a barleywine that needed to spend some time in the gym."
"If you imagine beer styles on a spectrum, this would be somewhere between winter warmer and barleywine. This is a malty ale: toffee, raisins, some wintery spices (cloves, nutmeg, ginger), and a hop presence that feels almost a DIPA. Oily, medium mouthfeel. This is a good brew fresh, but I've sat on a 6 pack for almost a year and feel like the malts really took over and put the hops in their place."
"Very intriguing but a real stew of flavors. A bargain if you want a six pack of strong beers around for medicinal purposes."
"O: Pretty easy drinking for style and abv. Nothing amazing about it, but solid."
"Very smooth and creamy, this is an outstanding beer, and the best I’ve had from Lagunitas."
"Picked this up to finish off a mixed 6 pack and thought it was a good beer."
"According to the bartender, they intentionally age several of these kegs for months to see how they develop. This particular keg was aged for nine months (proper gestation, sounds to me). It pours a deep ruby-brown topped by over a finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises light raisins, light figs, wheat, and mild biscuits. It's all kinda weak and nondescript to my 'strils. The taste holds notes of figs, light roasted malts, raisins, dark wheat, brown sugar, cinnamon, toasted biscuits, very light wood, light orange rind, and very light bitter coffee. Damn, is the stuff all over the place (in a good way)! The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry-ish finish. Overall, a very solid brew, one that clearly blossoms with age."
"A cellar temperature bottle is poured into a pint glass. A large tan foamy head looks really good. It rests atop a dark ruby colored liquid with plenty of rising carbonation. I can smell caramel malts as I pour the beer. Getting up close and personal, I can smell brown sugar, alcohol, and some mildly oily hops. It smells good. I can taste why this is a strong ale; both the hops and malts are big and bold. Brown sugar, caramel, plum are all present. Bitter hops come in as I swallow and linger on, along with some alcohol. There is a bit of burn as I swallow and some stickiness throughout, but it is still a good mouthfeel. I like this beer. It's a pretty good strong ale. I would certainly pick up another bottle if I come across one."
"This one poured out as a reddish brown colored ale. The head was white and foamy looking and leaving just a touch of lacing behind on the glass. The smell of the beer is a little sweet and a little fruity, it's got a little bit of everything going on in there. The taste is kind of the same way in my opinion. I'm not sure exactly what they're going for here but it's interesting. The mouthfeel was drinkable, decent carbonation and nicely balanced. Overall I'd like to have this one again one day just to give it another shot. Perhaps I'd enjoy it even more the second time around."
"Good beer. A couple months ago slightly fresher I remember enjoying it more, but it's still good now."
"Overall - I don't understand the hype for this beer. Its quite difficult to drink and the flavors just don't work for my pallet at all. Beers over 8% are very hit or miss for me. A few A+'s and a several D's and even an F. This one is a big D (only because it looks and smells ok). I will not be able to finish this one."
"Overall she works out alright, but doesn't taste too much different compared to some of their other strong offerings. Glad I had it though."
"The deep amber hints of, then delivers a rich, toasted malt sweetness with lots of caramel and toffee flavor, then follows that sweet, dark fruitiness with a hint of dryness to round out the body of this brew. Not much burn but watch out for the alcohol - one 12 oz bottle is usually enough for me."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and fascinating in both taste and texture. The only real fault is that the 8.83% ABV does result in an vodka-like bite, which can prove distracting, especially late in the aftertaste. However, the rest of the beer quite makes up for this."
"good stuff, certainly would buy again."
"O: Great beer! Drinkable, recommended, and super-tasty. Will have again. The more Lagunitas I try, the more I like it."
"O) This makes for easy drinking - a dangerous combination with ABV as it is. I'd have another one, but the following day. Two of these might put me under."
"Have always been a fan of this beer, but on cask it truly is sensational."
"Lots of booze here both in taste and in the warming sensation, which did detract a bit from everything in this beer. This would have been better to have during cooler months since it's somewhat overpowering but the flavors work well together and the slightly toasted mouthfeel ties everything in together well."
"AAA+"
"O: Solid. Not a beer a will order every time at Lagunitas, but every now and then, it is very enjoyable. Especially if it is cool outside."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a deep, dark, vibrant and clear blood-ruby coloring that almost looks brown in dim light. The brew starts off with a thin (half inch) yet solid and dense head that is biege in color, and this slowly settles out into a film that is barely coating the top. Aromas remind me of a barleywine...delicious and rich. There is a darkly sweet molasses backbone to the smell, with fruits blended throughout, such as cherry and plum. Some very slight spicing and hops are noted deep into the aroma, as well. Flavors are rich, but on a slick and lightly oily body. The flavors have a bit of coffee in the background, as well as bittering hops, both of which balance out the heavy caramel sweetness and dark fruit characteristics. The aftertaste is rich in the caramel sweet, and slightly cloying, making the finish slightly bittersweet and rich, as well. There is a slight linger to the finish, but the flavors keep this from being overly unpleasant. Decent brew."
"O/D - overall a good American Strong Ale, but one will do me for the night."
"This one was enjoyable for me because I am fan for more bitter brews. I would recommend trying this out."
"M. Heavy bodied. Slightly syrupy but not overly sticky."
"Pours a tepid dark-brown. A light tan head sticks very well. Smell is cocoa powder and sorta airy and cool. Herbal notes on the taste, maybe some anise. Mostly dark malts and booze. High resins and tannins; nutty. Finishes minerally, bitter, and hot. I had no idea what to expect, but this was a complex & decent brew."
"Definitely worth a try."
"M. Heavy bodied, with some carbonation, although this seems to almost get lost in the body and flavor. Slightly syrupy."
"A good tasting beer that is not as threating as it may look. Easy drinking."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. This is different than my recollection of this beer as I remember it being much more hoppy than it is and having a rather harsh mix between the hops, dark malts, and water in the finish. This beer is much different and is much more palatable. This beer is a little on the mild side for the style as far as palate sensations go for this style, but overall it is clean and well presented. I would drink this beer again and more importantly, I am not sad about my mistake of buying the wrong six-pack."
"Overall - This beer's 9.00% ABV is well hidden in a myriad complex flavors that will lull you into bliss, revel"
"D: This is possibly one of my favorite ""malty"" beers. i am quite enamored with it."
"Overall: A good strong ale. The flavor and mouthfeel were good but the lack of aroma was disappointing."
"O - A good strong ale. Deeper flavors would have been nice but this is a solid brew."
"D/O- Nothing really stands out with this one for me unfortunately. Could be my least favorite Lagunitas to date (a half dozen or so). Would recommend something else in the style. Thanks for the beer PTMcB!"
"A big, big beer - a little too cloying for my tastes, but acknowledged to be well done for a beer aiming to be a hairy eyeball."
"Overall I thought this was a good American Strong ale, it kind of reminds me of a cross between and American Barleywine and a Dopplebock. It had Ok balance but I felt like a little more floral hops would help this brew out a little, I always felt like all in all Lagunitas is pretty generous with the hops but this one was for sure all about the malts, some may call it a malt bomb. As with most of Lagunitas high gravity beers the alcohol was evident but still nicely subdued which makes for good drinkability, but the sweetness of this brew would prevent me from having more then two. I could see picking this up when I am in the mood for a really malty beer, and for the price it is a pretty good deal, like all of the other beers I have had from them. If malt forward beers are you thing then this brew won't disappointed. This was another good beer from Lagunitas, if they make a bad beer, then I haven't found it yet."
"O/D-Although I do not detect any cherries, this beer reminds me of those chocolate-dipped cherries that have a liqueur-syrup filling. Its as if they took a slice of pineapple, a handful of cranberries and dipped them in cognac based syrup. This is a big, bold beer. I respect Lagunitas for putting this beast into a decently affordable six-pack. I only bought a single, would not buy a 6-pack. Too boozy for me, but for about 10 dollars, a six-pack of this would floor you. I respect this beer, do not love it."
"Overall impression: A well-balanced American Strong ale. Not hoppy enough to scratch the itch, not malty enough to put it over the top. Not my favorite Lagunitas beer but a very solid example."
"The appearance is a dark copper brown with foamy but thin head that retains well and leaves nice sea foam lace. Teh smell is sweet and malty with caramel and honey notes followed by earthy and spicey hops on the back. Some dark fruit peeks through too. The taste follows the nose. This is a malty, sweet beer in the vein of dopplebock. Caramel, honey and notes of toffee with herbal, spicey notes of hops with some hints of nutmeg and dark fruit like raisins and fig. Hints of roasted malt and chocolate. Overall a medium bodied beer that is well balanced. Easy to drink."
"I wasn’t expecting to enjoy this much because the last Lagunitas I had was a let down and it scarred me. But I loved this. Flavorful and big with some weight, yet easy to drink."
"Overall - Aside from the look of the stuff, there really isn't much here. It leaves a bit to be desired. Grant it, it's bitter enough to make you grow hair on hairless parts of the body, but that's it. My opinion? If you want an average ale that is nice to look at, buy this."
"Overall this was a pretty good strong ale. It was a good deal."
"Not a bad easy drink or sipper. The 9% adds a nice,non-intrusive touch."
"Overall: This is a big beer. Super satisfying and very enjoyable."
"Overall: A great beer! And deceptively high in alcohol by volume...I would never guess it was 9%...maybe 7% at the highest. Once again, Lagunitas has it under control!"
"A much sweeter strong ale than I'd generally expect from the style. Has a barleywine sort of character. While it isn't the best beer I've had, it certainly is worth seeking out and tasting. Lagunitas has yet to disappoint me, and this certainly follows that trend! Probably good to have something sweet to pair with it."
"Seems like I've seen this all before from this brewery, but I'm not really complaining - not about a solid, strong west coast ale. Well, maybe the booze isn't quite as well integrated as it usually is, but that's just splitting hairs. I could see hitting a sixer of these, if perchance, I wanted to get my drink on, and yet at the same time enjoy it all the way through."
"Overall - overall a good beer, very dominant and strong, to be would be best served in the winter on a cold day."
"Overall this was a one sided meh, although it had personally hyped me with its appearance"
"O - This was an interesting beer and a good one. One of the better offerings I have had from a brewery that I don't generally care for."
"O: It grew on me as i drank it, but, I wish it was a little more balanced. I wouldn't buy again, but this is rare from a brewery such as lagunitas. Overall, not bad"
"o - eh. not a huge fan of strong ales in general but its alright. a few of these would definitely get me pretty tipsy, and the boozy taste would get me feelin it after 1. its alright."
"T: Sweet and malty upfront with a slight citrus hop bite towards the middle. I'm getting kind of a strange burnt flavor in there as well as a bit of beef jerky and coffee flavor towards the finish. It's a little on the sweet side for me and there's not quite enough hop bitterness or carbonation to tone it down."
"O - Not my favorite by any means, but not a bad go-to American strong ale that is easy to find."
"Overall-Another nice beer. Glad my buddy had this, because this is one of those beers I always walk by, and I should probably drink these more often."
"All in all, I guess I could compare this to a doppelbock or even a Belgian dark ale with bitterness on the backend."
"O: OK, bit of a strong brown ale. not amazing. i like strong beers, but i'm not sure i'd have more than 1 of these in a session. meh."
"o - a brew that I pulled from my cellar because most of the good beer stores are closed and I didn't feel like going out - and because I wasn't too excited about aging it, it just got tossed down there. Certainly a pleasant experience, but nothing to rave about. Also I didn't check the date but I'm pretty sure it's not fresh"
"D - The alcohol is hidden but the effects are not, I feel buzzed almost immediately! Definitely a sipper for me."
"D - For 9% abv, pretty drinkable. Nice balance of flavors, and they are decently complex. A bit full and heavy so a bit more of a sipper, but still really enjoyable."
"O just peachy keen I love this beer."
"Overall, though, this one struck me as a real find, and a keeper. I'm a big fan."
"Overall this isn't bad. The 9% ABV could be balanced out better, so this one is a sipper."
"Overall. Good tasting beer."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, but the cereal flavor was ultimately too dominant, and beyond that, I drank a full 12oz of it and am still not really sure what the hell it was."
"Its a pretty solid brew. Different for sure. Very flavorful and complex."
"O - Not too shabby, but it could be a little better balanced."
"As with most beers Lagunitas makes, this brew reflects a lot of hard work and thought, along with quality ingredients, resulting in a tasty and enjoyable beer I'd gladly drink again."
"Pours a very dark amber/mahogany. Thin, off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves some lacing. Rich malt aroma - plenty of dark fruit/raisin, caramel, chocolate. Some resinous hop presence. Tons of malt flavor - rich, sweet chocolate, raisin, caramel. Good hop bitterness to balance it well. Full body and a thick and creamy mouthfeel. A very well balanced, malty strong ale."
"O- A really good beer from a really good brewery."
"This one poured a very dark amber almost brownish color with some big beige head and good lacing on it. Smells like heavy malt with a bit of alcohol coming through, not bad though. Taste is rich roasted malt and molasses. Not much alcohol taste coming through which is good. This is on the high end of a medium mouthfeel. It's a little thicker beer but it goes down smooth. I definitely liked this beer and will look for it again. For being 9% alcohol, it tastes great and goes down very easy."
"Overall - A decent brew. I couldn't get passed that feeling that what I was drinking was just syrup with alcohol, almost the consistency of a cough medicine. I didn't think it was really that bad in the taste, and I think the hops bitterness really saved this beer from become a syrup bomb."
"The first couple of times I tried this I just drank it out of the bottle and I didn't like it that much. The strong taste of Belgium yeast was over powering. Not this time. It was poured into a glass and became a different beer. Quite enjoyable. If you get a chance to pick this one up... Do!! And don't sip it out of the bottle on a camping trip. Pour it out and let the beer do the talking."
"Pours a dark brown, letting light through easily, minimal head. Scent is of musty earthy hops and combines with a strong molasses and fig backbone. Taste is slightly thin in complexity and the body follows suit with some wateryness. taste brings some more fruittyness with spice, but the earhty and musty hops cover up much of this. One of the weaker flavored and bodied strong ales I have had."
"Good brew. This is why Lagunitas will always be a favorite of mine."
"O - very rich and warm flavours, the alcohol is very well hidden in taste and balanced by the sweetness, but detectable in the dryness, but very drinkable, as expected Lagunitas never fails to impress"
"Medium mouthfeel, and just a hint of booziness. Overall a good offering, and different enough to be interesting."
"D/N A very good beer although not very drinkable. Not complex and flavorful enough to keep me wanting more. Worth a try if you come across it though."
"O--Lagunitas doesn't disappoint, but this brew is a bit all over the place!"
"i like this brew... it is not a wowzer -- came out in January -- woulda been perfect a couple weeks ago. nice late winter Heavy Ale."
"Overall -- This one just did not work for me. The unique dark roast flavors found in Hairy Eyeball clash with the hops. Then again, I'm not a big fan of BSDA's, which I think this closely resembles, so your mileage may vary."
"The mouthfeel is almost oppressive in it's thickness, I honestly wasn't expecting anything nearly this thick. It's also a little bit too smooth, it makes the hop prickle at the end feel just a bit awkward. Overall, this is a pretty confused brew. I mean, it tastes alright, but I just never feel everything comes together to making something absolutely great."
"O: Decent offering from Lagunitas, I would have liked BS to have stuck around a little longer, or a rerelease of Imperial Red. But WTF is out, and I will be enjoying plenty of that."
"Pours out a deep brown with a lasting tan head. Aroma is boozy sweet, with ripe apricot and nutty caramel. Taste brings out the nuttiness in a big way, with sweet caramel following with a slight hint of cocoa. Finishes semi-dry and bitter, pretty hopped. Earthy and dark and warming."
"D - Took me a while to get through one. The booze was coming through for me. Though I enjoyed it taking my time with it."
"body is medium, but the carbonation is very smooth and makes for an easy to drink beer. overall, a pretty solid brew."
"O: This is a really nice Strong Ale. Not overly sweet, a nice hop undertone with the alcohol pretty well hidden."
"This beer looks pretty nice in the glass. Dark brown in color with a thin white head that laced a little. Smells good with alot of dark fruit notes and bready malt aromas. Palate has some sweet raisin and caramel flavors but is burdened by the fusel alcohol and the ill-fitting bitter tannins in the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy and is highly carbonated. Not my favorite brew by any means but could suffice on a cold winter night."
"Interesting and rewarding, much going on."
"Hairy Eyeball Ale was a true oddity. Although the appearance and mouthfeel were exceptional, both the taste and aroma were hugely disappointing. I felt like the life had been sucked from this beer."
"Overall: Surprisingly not the hop bomb that Lagunitas loves to make. This has a lot of dark beer character and just a bit of hop profile. Very interesting."
"Overall: A huge flavor ale and surprisingly easy to drink given the ABV"
"D--I like this ASA because it is not overly hoppy, which was a bit of a surprise. Nice change of pace and certainly a solid offering by Lagunitas..."
"Overall, although not my favorite from this brewery, another solid offering from the boys at Laginitas."
"O - Overall, definitely worth a try as it has some unique properties. The ABV goes completely undetected. Not my favourite by lagunitas, but still a very tasty offering."
"Not bad, not great. There are better beers from Lagunitas which I would prefer in the future."
"D.) This definitely has a pretty low drinkability for me, partially due to the ABV, but also because there are simply better beers in this style that I can find fairly easily. Worth a try, but not much more than that."
"O: It's a solid offering, getting plenty of bang for your buck. Packed with booze that almost overpowers the flavors at times. It's a personal ""one and done"" kind of beers, where I enjoy it, but get rather sick of it. Worth trying."
"Pours an extremely dark brown color with a medium off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is malty with a bit of chocolate and a hint of dark fruits. Taste is WOW...didn't see this coming from a beer with not much going on in the nose. This beer is very sweet, maybe a little overly sweet. I initially get overly sugary molasses with a tad bit of chocolate. Lots of dark fruit flavors with a bit of alcohol. Flavors are not blended together very well IMO. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a big beer. Drinkability is fair. This is not my favorite beer from Lagunitas. I feel like it's the inbred offspring of Gnarleywine, Imperial Stout, and a Quad of some sort. If you want some bang for your buck though, can't beat the price."
"D- I might try and put a couple of these in the cellar to see if it'll improve, I'm not overly confident though."
"Dark ruby red with a cream-colored head with some pretty dense structure that looks like it's going to cling well. The smell is malty with some leathery/musty notes. As you drink, the lace makes rings around the glass that stick there and forces you to wash them out. At first sip I thought I was getting an alcohol burn on the tongue but it's the hops asserting themselves with bitterness. The flavor given off by the hops is resinous pine and that adds to the feel of mustiness or tobacco, but less so than what you get in the nose. The malts add some molasses which goes in with the mouthfeel. This beer clings to the lips and coats the tongue in an oily sort of way. There's a lot going on in this beer and it doesn't all seem to work all that well together. The hops are adding more bitterness than flavor and the malts don't deliver enough of a balancing sweetness. Balance would satisfy the style standard for an English Strong Ale. The Brewers' Association does not offer one for American Strong Ales. BeerAdvocate is no help, referring to the style as a ""catch-all"". So I'll rate it against the English style and continue to complain about it not being balanced."
"D - I have a certain disdain for normal beer that's like everything else in regards to style, but I wont argue it's bad because it's certainly not. It's just like every other strong ale."
"There is a good amount of carbonation here, and is actually a bit wetting to the palate. The burn of alcohol is not detectable, which makes this a bit of a dangerous beer. Much too easy to consume for the fact of being a higher ABV'd beer."
"Had this one on draft at Abbaye served in a tulip shaped glass. Pours a dark brown with little head. Little aroma of dark malts. Tastes like brown sugar, molasses, raisin, fig. No noticeable hop character. Interesting beer - a real sipper due to its complex profile. Couldn't even notice the high ABV. Enjoyed it & would try it again."
"I found this to be a very interesting beer. I gave it a 4.0 for mouthfeel. I don't know if the feel is good or bad, just very, very unique."
"A bit thick on the mouth and not easy to drink quickly. I like this on draft; not sure if it's something I'd pick up a six pack of, though."
"o - went down very easily, not overly sweet, could easily knock back a few more of these"
"Drink - There are a lot of different flavour going on which makes it a nice beer to switch things up with. The alcohol became more evident as the beer approached room temperature. An above average beer that makes a good winter warmer/sipper."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is good. I could finish a few and then regret it. Watch out for the high ABV. Lagunitas doesn't make weak beer."
"D- I surprisingly finished the 12oz bottle easily. I love big beers, so I was able to muscle thru it, but I will not grab another"
"Overall, this beer seemed a bit of a mess. Malty and strong are about all I can say about it. The flavor was pretty uninteresting and became even more so as I finished my glass."
"D: Unfortunately, I liked this beer less and less as I drank it. I almost drain-poured the last quarter or so. The dominant flavors are a strong raisiny malty sweetness and a bitterness that lacks the nicer attributes of hops. I think I can see where they were going with it, but it lacks fullness and balance in the flavor. I find it too strong, in malt and alcohol, without sufficient other flavors to smooth them out."
"D: A decent brew. Perhaps a touch too sweet and nothing really extraordinary about the flavors."
"The taste presents a heavy dark fruit vibe with a constant edge of hops to keep it from going all Belgian dark on you. Alcohol is a bit high but the finish is surprisingly clean. Some smokiness adds to the already mighty complexity. There is a lot going on here, most of it good, but sessionable it is not. More of a nightcap type thing."
"D - Definitely drinkable - high alcohol content at 9% but it is not so present in the taste. Tasty but looses its zip a bit after a while."
"Medium to heavy mouthfeel, slightly syrupy. Overall a decent drinker, havent noticed the strong alcohol content yet. Wish I grabbed a few of these, as I always seem to with Lagunitas. I had no idea this was a Strong Ale going in, and have to say it exceeded my expectations. Don't let others thoughts stray you, this is a must try."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side, with carbonation being a little below average. The drinkability was good, I enjoyed it a lot. It was pretty bold in both hoppy and malty categories, but managed to integrate them together pretty nicely. It reminded me a little of Arrogant Bastard actually, only more sweet. Pretty nice beer overall."
"D: This is very tasty and seems to be akin to a Dubbel-Strong Brown Ale blend."
"D - Warms the belly and drinks a bit hotter than the abv would indicate."
"4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0"
"Deep mahogoney, almost opaque, with a inch tall off-white head that dissapates slowly and leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. The smell is the only thing from this beer that lacks at all, but not too bad as hints of alcohol and slight resiny hops come through. The taste is huge and robust though, hitting the palate with a big bold flavor of creamy malts and crisp hops that is balanced perfectly by a coffee bitterness that finishes the taste off. With a creamy yet crisp mouthfeel, this beer is good for most people who like a good strong beer without being overwhelmed by the alcohol flavor. It's there, but only as an afterthought despite being 9 percent. This makes it surprisingly easy to drink but beware because it packs an unsuspected wollop. Great beer from Lagunitas."
"A decent example of the style, though there is nothing that sets this one apart from others except that it has no obvious flaws. Very clean, but not distinguishable."
"D - Another big hit from Lagunitas; one of my favorite brews of 2010. Smooth but with a fair amount of bitterness. Nicely balanced. I'd recommend it to anyone."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with ruby hues. 1/2 Inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of booze, raisins, and a bit of hops. Flavors of dark fruits, alcohol, and some bitterness. Not much hops here which is shocking since this is a Lagunitas beer. Hints of brown sugar. Dark fruit aftertaste. Overall this beer is decent but the dark fruit flavors make me think it'd be rough to drink a few of these in one sitting."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, caramel and candy sugar. In the taste, just like the aroma, caramel and candy sugar, with hints of alcohol. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sticky sweet candy sugar aftertaste. Nice big ale, but kind of line and average."
"ABV is hidden well and is very easy to drink."
"The big complex flavors are very nice. Really reminiscent of Arrogant Bastard for me. The alcohol is a touch overstated. This beer could probably use some time to mellow out, but really overall a good tasting beer."
"If you want to go to sleep with a warming beer, definitely try this one out. Although it's not a style that I prefer, this one is still a good one. Sweet, malty, smooth, just the right amount of hops, and plenty of alcohol without tasting like it. Try it!"
"D: despite high abv. Alcohol is well masked & makes for an easy sipper .."
"D- Skip this and go straight to the Gnarlywine."
"Cheers"
"D - the drinkability is good. It's easy to drink, and tastes great. I really like this beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to pick some up. I recommend giving it a try."
"Interesting beer but didn't really appeal to me for some reason. The taste was just not what I was expecting. Sort of weird flavor combination, closest to a winter warmer maybe but more potent."
"Overall, this was a little meh for me. So far, I have not enjoyed any of the Lagunitas offerings, still searching for something impressive from them."
"D: Another fine sipping strong ale from Lagunitas. They always seem to make their hops known, as evidence by this brew as well, but with a delicate and complex malt balance. Too many of these brews at 9% ABV in one sitting and the next day, you probably realize why it's called ""hairy eyeball."""
"Finish is smooth with a subtle bitterness."
"glassware: tulip"
"Drinkabilty: I've avoided this beer for a couple of years for some reason. I wont anymore. This is a great, malt forward strong ale. Sweet and toasty."
"M&D- Goes down really smooth. Its not quite as heavy as it looks. Its a nice easily drinkable brew that Lagunita's has made."
"For the 9% I would say the drinkability is average. The alcohol is not very well hidden and the harsh bitter nature does not promote more drinks. Probably the most disappointing Lagunitas I have had...perhaps it is just a bad bottle?"
"D - A sipping beer, good taste, just hard to drink in multiples."
"This is yummy as hell. Rich, thick, and powerful-a real sipper. Love it."
"Hairy Eyeball Ale pours a mix of smooth and burnt caramels with some amber highlights. The head and lacing is small and brief, quickly dissipating into the brew. It smells strongly of brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of pineapple. I find the taste for this one pretty jumbled and not quite complementary -- at first sip you're greeted with a rush of sticky sweet brown sugar and honey, which is countered with tart grapefruit. Notes of prune and red fruit finish off the palate. The beer has a medium body with a slight silkiness. I can barely see myself finishing off the 12 ounce bottle of this one -- the sweet/bitter tastes are more than a bit cloying on the tongue. Not one I plan to have again."
"D: Very drinkable. Not too high in alcohol content, so a great drinker if you're looking for a decent six pack."
"I liked it but still pretty expensive in this part of the world, a fair bit going on with this beer I'm curious to what some aging would do for it"
"Drinkability is good for a 9.0 beer. I could sip a few of these over a long, cold evening. Lagunitas can do other things well besides hop bombs."
"Walnut colored pour with a very healthy mocha colored head that stays put. Not much of a smell, but the taste is pretty good. More malty molasses, and coffee up front, and a more bitter burnt back end. The alcohol is hidden up front and comes out at the end. It's like eating hot chips and salsa. As long as you keep eating it is great, once you stop, it is not as nice. Packs a punch. I prefer the sweeter Brown Sugga, but this is pretty good."
"I love the rich creamy malts in this beer!! Very tasty."
"drink ability is decent....the high abv....and the fullness of the beer limit to 1 maybe 2 a night"
"Drinkability: This has some elements of a standard barleywine, it's just a little bit boozy, but not that well balanced."
"D - This is really drinkable, and very different from what I remember the first time I tried it. There are many layers of flavor here and I am not sure if it's complex or just all over the place, but a nice beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability: I really like this, and it is different from my previous experience with Lagunitas (IPA, Maximus, Hop Stoopid, Brown Shugga). I was always under the impression that their beers were very American and this is labeled as an American Strong Ale. However, this is very English (and noticing a little Belgian now), but innovative, as it seems to be an English Strong Ale & Stout hybrid. Also, this is 9%? Wow, completely hidden. I would have guessed more like 7%."
"The entire aftertaste and palate feel follows suit, as you get this rough feeling around the mouth as if you chewed paan, and have a leafy tobacco taste in your mouth - it's actually really nice. Drinkability is less for this due to the rough feel building up a little bit, but the beer is well bodied and certainly hides the 9% abv perfectly."
"This beer drinks well and i was surprised to learn the alcohol content. Perfect for a night when i am just having one beer to unwind completely."
"Great"
"Drinkabilty - At 9% not something you can drink much of. This is a soild ale but it lacks balance and flavor. This is a arrogant bastard clone, and not a better one. Its decent but, not something id select over arrogant bastard."
"I'm going to say that this is the best American use of Belgian yeast that I've experienced thus far. In a lot of other beers the yeast comes across with a strong phenolic/peppery character, but it's smooth as silk here. Very strong caramel malt profile with a *decent* hop balance. Very thick mouthfeel, almost viscous. Easy drinking with a well-masked high ABV. Go for this sweet baby, you shan't regret it."
"Overall: Good beer overall. This seems like a bastard version of a Belgian ale. I could see this cellaring very well. Not the best beer I've had from Lagunitas by far, but it's still worth trying."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew at all. I don't love the taste, but it's pretty unique and interesting."
"One of these is enough for me. Not digging the heavy figgy malt profile."
"Nice Imperial Red Ale/Strong Ale."
"D- Very filling, can't imagine more than one per sitting but enjoyable and if offered, I would gladly accept another in another sitting"
"The mouthfeel was medium in body and slightly creamy."
"Final thought - Such a unique beer, love that it's seasonal. Instead of chocolate or strawberries in the bedroom, try this. Awesome beer!"
"Pours a dark reddish-brown that has an off white head that has good retention and very good lacing. The smell is a pleasant sweet smell of sweet malts, sugars, and some dark fruits. The taste is caramel, molasses, followed by a nutty and maple flavor, than get some raisins mixed in and it finishes off with a slight citrus taste at the end. The after taste is a sugary sweetness mixed with a little bitterness from some hops. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but thanks to the sugars it becomes sticky on the lips and tongue. I know this has 9.0% ABV according to the beer bottle, but can hardly taste the alcohol and the good taste and balance makes me want to drink more than one, but I only bought one for $1.99 plus tax and deposit. For those who have not tried this go out and buy one and I think you might buy another."
"malts made me barely finish this one"
"D- Hides its 9& ABV very well, I could easily go through a Sixer."
"This is a very good beer, a true lagunitas classic. Going with there style, it doesnt fit into a certain category like most, american barleywine and strong ale its hard to decide."
"I wouldn't say the drinkability is too high with this one. Definitely not something you'd have more than one of but it's enjoyable while it's in the glass. Probably just a bit above average for a beer of the style."
"This beer pours a mahogany color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, pine and citrus. It is rather pungent, but quite simple. The taste has more caramel than the aroma which I think is a really good thing. There is still a noticeable hop presence, however, it is in the form of a rounded bitterness on the tongue, and a lively bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with sprightly carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would happily drink again. The aroma is pretty generic, but the taste is solid and for this beer that is enough."
"Excellent beer, excellent taste. For the most part, I love everything that lagunitas has to offer. Well balanced and exceptionally tasting beers. what more could you want especially from a high ABV beer. Good stuff, keep it coming lagunitas. 9 more letters."
"Despite the alcohol being well hidden, I'd definitely say this beer is a sipper. I'm not sure how much longer this beer will age. Will be interested in revisiting it in a few more months."
"Poured into a snifter. The color is a nice really dark red-amber with a really thin head that doesn't really last. The nose is strong and malty with some brown sugar, caramel, dark fruits, and a bit of light booze. Really nice and complex. The taste is some brown sugar and light dark fruits. The feel is a bit boozy but quite nice with a good body and drinks well."
"I found this to be pretty similar to the brown shugga', maybe it is because I just reviewed that one as well. However I did find this one more to my liking."
"The body was thick, still easy to drink. The carbonation was perfect, the feel was syrupy in the mouth, and chalky through the finish. Would make an excellent winter warmer, or a fantastic dessert."
"Found this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Greensboro, NC, it shows a very opaque black color, chilled in a nice goblet. It has a giant milkshake-like light tan head with tons of lacing left behind. The aroma brings malty caramel and yeasty evergreen with a sweet brandy touch. Neat. The flavor brings a sort of Dr. Pepper, malt blend with some hints of whiskey and maybe juniper toffee. There are some chocolate and maple brown bread ideas milling around as well. This is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. It has a thick, near syrupy feel and is not highly drinkable in my book. Very good, interesting stuff although it seemed somewhat unbalanced, hard to capture on the taste buds, almost harsh. Alcohol is notable."
"This poured a deep dark red with a 2 finger head. Some fruity esters and very mild pine like hops. Very malty and sweet, kind of like a Dopplebock. Hint of raisins and brown sugar. This is tasty and easy to drink. I would seek out another one of these!"
"The eyeball is much darker than I expected it to be. It has a shallow head and laces nicely in the glass. It smells delicious and carries hint of aroma that gives it that true strong ale character. I really enjoy the strong yet full flavor with a very nice blend of healthy malts and mild hops. The going down is just right for a complete beer experience and the tastey sips invite a second bottle."
"Solid beer but not my thing. When picking a slightly similar beer from Lagunita's portfolio I would go with some Brown Shugga instead. Drank easy but not super enjoyable. Not the beer for me."
"D- I drank six and so can you"
"D- Pretty good stuff. The ABV and heavy flavor make it tough to session, but one will do."
"M/D: Thick, creamy and delicious. If you can take the ABV you could drink it all night."
"Kind of like an india black ale, but it could be hoppier."
"Drinkability/Palitability:Lower; not a beer to be messed with coming in at 8.8% ABV. Lagunitas has a way of making beers that sneak up on you."
"Drinkability-Considering the ABV,the drinkability is good but the sweetness could become cloying after two."
"Haven't had this beer in a long while. I opened a (5) year old bottle of this a few weeks ago and unfortunately, it went down the drain. This beer doesn't strike me as one to be aged for that period of time, maybe a year or two, that's about it. Would definitely purchase this again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a deep amber color that has a nice 2 finger off white head that lasts real long leaving sticky lacing after each sip. The aroma is of burnt caramel, some toffee, slight apricot and fig notes. The taste is a little milder than the aroma led it to be. Some nice malts up front with decent toffee sweetness and a slight mild bitter finish. Alcohol is definitely in the back of my throat lacing a nice warm sensation. This is a decent brew but not sure if good on a hot summer night to have more than one."
"pours a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head and tan sticky lacing and ring..i smell malts and toffee and dark fruits some roasted spices..taste is the same..its roasted malts and toffee some dark fruits,,some chocolate and toast put is some citrus hops and finish it off with some brown sugar..mouth feel is heavy /medium and robust with a nicely balanced strong ale ..i could only drink 1 of these but i did enjoy it will buy in singles again and recommend this one"
"jd"
"I find this quite difficult to drink because the sweetness is very strong. This beer can use quite a bit more balance. Not a bad beer by any means but just a tad bit too sweet for my tastes."
"Overall a decent strong ale. Typical on all points. Nothing stands out for me though."
"Beer poured dark brown with a 1 finger head that is leaving lacing and long lasting. Nose has hints of brown sugar and raisins. Taste is a huge sweet malt backbone, brown sugar raisins, dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, medium carbonation, extremely smooth and satisfying. Drinkability is good, the abv is well hidden. Not much complexity here, this is simply a nice winter warmer. Glad to have had a chance to sample!"
"D: A cleaner mouthfeel would have increased the drinkability and overall score. Drinks like a porter."
"D: I think I might grab a few and cellar them. I have always had good luck cellaring their beers. Fresh this was a joy to drink. Insanely drinkable for the style."
"12-oz bottle. Foamy, full head. Aroma of licorice, caramel, and vanilla extract. Color is medium brown and clear. Heavy sweetness. Heavy full body, sticky texture, almost syrupy. Surprisingly clean finish for such a heavy beer. The finish makes the beer drinkable, and not just for sipping."
" ~ I'd love to sit down with two or three of these babies and really enjoy them. This makes for a great desert beer even in it's mild demeanor. I wish I had picked up a six pack and not just a single. I'll be back for more."
"Powerful, so start the night off with this one."
"D- Mellow and well balanced. Seemed to be the opposite of their Undercover Investigation Ale which is hops then malts. The Hairy Eyeball starts out with a nice malt sweetness balanced out with the slightly bitter hop finish. Leans towards a sipper, but if you're into it I could see drinking a couple. It was good, but didn't do much for me."
"Drinkability: It is a brew to savour and enjoy, not something to pound a six pack of in one sitting. i dont know what category this falls under, it is not hopped enough to call this a barley wine, but it has more bitterness than you would expect in a classic example of old ale"
"D-Well done. Big, flavorful, complex, incredibly well balanced, and best of all way tasty. Hard to believe its 9% ABV. Another great brew from Lagunitas."
"This beauty pours a dark mahogany with an initial two finger tan head, finishing off with a nice sticky lacing the whole glass. Has a sweet toasted malt and molasses on the tongue. Light on the carbonation with a medium/heavy body. If I lived in Petaluma,CA there would be not a taste for everyone else. If you can't get it, road trip it!!!"
"What a name, bizarre yet intriguing, I've picked up a six of this before but it was so good, it got downed without a review. Well I scored another, marked at 8.83% ABV, so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a delicious smell of brown sugar, molasses and black and hint red licorice. Pours to a nice translucent deep red brown with a thin tan head. Taste of this brew is complex. It starts with a chewy roasted malt base and progresses to a black licorice flavor with a molasses and anise slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is extraordinary. It starts almost syrup thick then zests ion the middle with carbonation and thins (not overly so) but still sticks to the ribs. This is a perfect example of this style and a very delicious brew. This brew can be very sneaky at 8.83% ABV. This beer is also an extreme value as a six pack sells for less than most four packs of equal or lesser quality. Keep up the good work Lagunitas. May have to cellar a few to see what pans out in a year or two."
"D. good it sips well perfect for spring could have 2 in one sitting"
"Beautifully poured beer at McNulty's Pub in Cleveland Heights. Great lacing, Great aroma, a little on the thin side in the mouth, which seemed to accentuate the higher ABV. Overall, Quite yummy, a treat. A sixer would be a full evening at home, but I might have to try it."
"D - Decent strong ale for sipping but not necessarily a session beer given the high 8.80% ABV on board. Perhaps a nice after dinner beer."
"The 8.80%abv is minimally noticed, but gives you a nice, fuzzy, feeling with a mild hint of warmth. Perhaps not the best thing to slam a 12-pack of in a session, in that respect, but it's tasty enough that you just might, if you aren't keeping track of your intake."
"Not much to add to my review of on-tap version nose and flavor wise, but I used this as an opportunity to compare with Stone's Arrogant Bastard, which I would view as the comparator for the style re Cali Strong Ale. I thought the depth of flavor, re malt profile balance between caramel and bread, and hop profile, more aggressive bitterness on back end, tilts scale toward the Eyeball. On drinkability, though, a this ABV you better be careful. I certainly prefer the tap version to this bottled version, but as few kegs as I've seen of this in Beervana, I'm lucky to have scored this bottle. The big question is whether this will cellar well. Damn, I should have grabbed another bottle!"
"Value: I paid $2.49 for a single. Not bad at all."
"- Overall this is certainly a good beer, and one I will buy again for sure. It is dangerously smooth and tasty... and a favorite from this brewer. I seem to favor their browner ales vs. their golden..."
"D: The high alcohol would limit drinkability, but it is a tasty beer."
"definatly a sipper in my mind. packs a little bit of a punch. definatly overall better with some age on it. im interested to see what even another year will do to my one remaining bottle. i would suggest aging this beer, if you got the room, i wouldnt really go out of my way to do it again though."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Hennepin globe glass. This beer pours a mahogany brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. A massive 4 inch creamy beige head pours out of the bottle leaving a rather sparse lacing. Up front comes dark fruits, with apples and pears. Prunes and dates with just a little bit of raisins. After that i pick up some piney hops. The flavor is big and malty. Prunes, dates, over ripe apples all come through. Brown sugar with just a little bit of chocolate. The hops really fade out of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, leaving a caramelized brown sugar flavor soaked into the palate. Once again, Lagunitas has made a good big beer that is readily available and affordable. Gotta love Lagunitas."
"Mouthfeel-Solid carbonation delivers a quick bitter sting that soon gives way to a malty sweetness. There is a hoppy bitterness that emerges quickly but subsides as the finish yields to some alcohol warmth. Not hot or strong. Can alcohol be earthy? The booziness is candy like. I usually froth on the palate but I choose to roll this around and I get some different sweet flavor profiles, dried fruit finally comes through, bubblegum even. This is certainly a strong ale and I got a case of this along with a case of Brown Shugga' so let the high gravity times roll! Lagunitas never disappoints and I could probably sip two of these."
"Pours a nice dark transparent coppery brown with a fairly thick pale tan head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is richly malty with an undertone of brown sugar and a hint of cloves. Lively flavor is malty and spicy, slightly sweet and slightly bitter, with a teensy alcohol bite. Texture is fizzy, tingly and edgy, dancing on the tongue and on the way down."
"I found this overly sweet and had to make an effort to finish it for that reason."
"D: A sipper for sure. A decent strong ale but it's scent reminds me too much of a Flemish red ale, which turns me off to seeking it out any time in the near future."
"Drinkability: A nice and big malty brew. One of my favorites from the brewery. One per serving, but would get this again."
"Future outlook: Solid, if unspectacular beer. Won't be a beer to go out of my way for, but at a good price point, and might be a beer to enjoy occasionally."
"Poured from 12oz into snifter on 3/26. Poured dark brown with 1 finger off-white head. This one smelled sweet. Fig/plum, sweet malts, maybe even brown sugar, no hops detected. The taste follows with a little more caramel and slight alcohol heat. Full body and almost syrupy and sticky. The drinkability is average due to sweetness."
"This has a sticky, very sweet feel about it. To me, this has a light feel despite being a tad on the heavy, over malted side. This one will surely dry you out, so keep a glass of water available. Drinkability is slightly above average for me, though you may need to pace yourself with this. Too much and it may be lights out if you are not careful."
"Drinkability:Farily drinkable. Reminded me of a less attentuated Backwoods bastard. I'd drink this again if it were priced a bit less. This was a pretty unique brew, definitely satisfies a sweet tooth."
"M/D: Medium to fuller body. Medium carbonation. Other then that mouthfeel is very average. Drinkability is okay, a little too strong on the alcohol taste that lowers this score for me. ABV is not hidden at all."
"D: This is a beer that really needs to be sipped, although the alcohol is masked rather well. I couldn't see having more than one of these in a single sitting."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Its something like a strong brown ale, but with quite a bit of hops as well. It is very unique, and my first lagunitas beer, and I will definitely seek out more."
"D_Very drinkable especially for a high abv."
"Taste is almost identical to the nose, a touch sweet with toffee, light brown sugar, and a tiny bit of roasted malts. Where this beer loses is the finish to me - a tad too bitter and malty balancing the rest of the beer, but not part of the same equation. Body is mostly thin, but the alcohol is fairly well hidden."
"Very nice American Ale, would recommend it and happy that I have two more bottles. Thank you Lagunitas."
"Smooth and sweet mouthfeel, almost creamy with a full body to it. Moderate carbonation. Quite drinkable for the ABV, and a very flavorful, complex and enjoyable beer!"
"This brew didnt do it for me. Too malt forward without the balance to pull it all together. Glad to try it, but probably wont be trying it again."
"D- hairy eyeball is a good american strong brew from the west coast. The combination of malts and spices makes it a pretty drinkable beer. The alcohol is very strong. I defintely will enjoy one or two of these at a time"
"Drinkability was slightly better than average which was good for such a full flavored beer."
"Puffy foamy cap of a head, This one has a big winter Spice aroma, which is in the taste as well, this could fall under the so called ""winter Warmer"" catagory, which is as ambiguos as the Strong Ale catagory. This one is sweeter in the malt dept with toffee, with a slight alcohol burn but nothing major. Some fire roasted nuts mixed in with the spices. Carbination is kept to a minimal, medium density, slight stickyness detracts from the drinkability somewhat."
"The color is a heavy brown with not much head or lacing remaining after getting a look at it. ok, not great."
"D= very drinkable with forewarning of what this beer is!"
"Good drinkability. Slightly sweet but no signs of abv."
"D- Fairly high ABV at over 8.8% but is oddly easy to drink. I could put a few of these 12oz bottles down without too much hesitation. Lagunitas surprises me yet again with some amazing brew."
"Pours a clear, dark reddish brown, with thin white head. Smell: dark brown sugar, hint of smoked meat, background leafy hops. Fairly subdued. Taste: dark brown sugar, some sugary dark fruit bread (date bread anyone?), big citrus rind hop kick which fades into something a bit medicinal, finishes with a very German dopplebock character. This was definitely not what I expected from Lagunitas, but it's a nice sugary dopplebock with west coast hops."
"Redneck Grade: Slap your momma!"
"Lagunitas Hairy Eyeball pours a mere disk of foam over a nearly opaque coffee colored brew. Carbonation is moderate and steady, the nose is a collection of surprisingly muted toasty notes- mocha, maybe a bit of molasses. Flavor is more pronounced- estery English yeast funk, sweetish dark toast, a bit of char and grassy hop off the back for balance. Mouthfeel is round yet crisp, trending dry, with a bit of a grassy medicinal aftertaste. Lagunitas is striking a pretty fine balance line here. The label indicates 56.7 International Bittering Units pushing up against an 8.7% Alcohol by Volume brew, yet there's not much of a bite from the hops nor does alcohol make much of an impression save that feeling of well being. This one's pretty sneaky kids- drink it slowly!"
"Nice sipping beer. Decent offering from Lagunitas."
"D: Very drinkable despite its hairy strength. Outstanding, a must try!"
"D- I don't know what this beer is, but it works fine as a nightcap"
"A different winter beer, I must say. Pours out a dark red-brown with a nice one and a half finger head that ahs good retention. Leaves a nice medium coat of lacing and a decent ring stays behind atop the ale. Smell is a bit boozy, maybe more than a bit. Some dark malts with sugar sweetness. Ahhh, too much alcohol in the nose. There is also some dark fruits and spices and a bit of earthy hops. The taste is medium toasty/sweet/roast malt with some dark fruit and earthy hops. Some alcohol in there for sure but it is tolerable. Grassy hops on the palate too with high bitters. Some winter spices and brown sugar in here too. Mouthfeel is medium body with low carbonation. Heat is too much for me here. There is a decent bitter coat. It needs more carbonation and cream and less heat. Drinkability is OK. The price is good for a strong beer but the ABV could be hidden much better. The strong flavors become a bit too much. Probably not gonna get it again but I actually prefer this too any of the other overly spiced winter ales I have had."
"Taste is rich and full without being sweet, cherry and raisin notes dominate with dried fruits more prominent with exposure. Feel is light and smooth for the style with enough carbonation and malt to mask the ABV yet not become cloying. Well balanced and quite drinkable. Think I'll stick a few in the cellar to enjoy in the off season."
"Rating by Tommy from BrewFanatics.com"
"D: the name may be a tad off putting but whats in the bottle is great to drink."
"Taste is very nice with caramel and hops. There is a nice dose of hops which I am not used to with a bock tasting beer. A very thick bodied beer. A sipper and a few of these should age. I will update."
"D: a sipper, might improve with some age on it to smooth it out."
"All in all, this brew is not very good. Avoid!"
"D -"
"Medium thick body and light carbonation. A good winter sipper with really interesting flavor."
"Poured a deep raison like color with good carbonation and a dirty white head. Nose is sweet, burnt, brown sugar, caramel. Taste is molasses, caramel, brown sugar, with some dark fruits on the end. Mouthfeel has a light sourness, booze tinge with a stickiness. Pretty good and drinkable."
"You take your time with this pint, but it's very nice. Very interesting. Something tells me this is a different beer out of the bottle vs. the draft version. I am guessing that I would like this more on draft. But one never knows."
"Drinkability: A good beer for malt lovers. Deep rich and smooth. Good ABV that makes this a great fall-winter beer."
"D - For a strong ale, this is a pretty easy drinker. Flavors are subdued, body is light, and everything is well balanced with not much of a noticeable alcohol presence. Not my favorite strong ale (so many good ones out there), but a pretty good beer - probably would be one and done in a bar and try something different the next round though..."
"Morey's Bottom Line: They label this as a strong ale, but to me, it's a winter warmer. Very similar to Anchor Christmas in my opinion. A well crafted beer for sure."
"This is the third beer I've had from Lagunitas and it's starting to become appearant that they are a little hit or miss in my book. One of the beers was fantastic, one was middle of the road and the last I just didn't enjoy. This one was the middle of the road."
"D -- I bought a sixer and it took my fiancee and I two weeks to finish them. I can't say I'll buy another, but I can see where other people may really enjoy this beer. It's just not for me, and this is only one man's opinion."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Not a favorite from Lagunitas, which I agree is typically underrated and yet is one of the most remarkable US craft beers available in this region. But this hairy eyeball still offers a nice brew, pleasing and quality."
"Note: don't serve this ice cold. Once I waited for this to warm up a little bit the taste greatly improved!"
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, yeast, sweet malt, slight citrus, and slight tart malt. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, slight yeast, and dark citrus (plum). Overall, a good blend, body, and complexity."
"D - Going back to the singles store to locate a sixer. Man a great big beer that might be a regular for me. Might want to locate the cappuccino stout first before I get to love this one too much."
"D: For the ABV, it's fairly easy to drink, but it 's not necessarily a beer I would look to try again. One of the few Lagunitas beers I haven't been too crazy about."
"D - This is just a really good beer. Lots of malt flavor, especially chocolate. A nice bitter, clean, chocolate finish with a hint of alcohol warmth. Very nice on a cold night after shoveling some snow."
"(D)- An interesting american strong ale. Reminds me more of a winter warmer like I stated earlier, but still enjoyable. Would be even better if it were more balanced, but perhaps this would benefit from additional bottle aging?"
"Drinkability: I finished this one a little too quickly. Though it's almost Spring, I could definitely cozy up to a few of these in the upcoming months. Very nice overall."
"Another gem from the boys at Lagunitas."
"Overall Impression: This beer is so good, that my brother in law ( who is a Coors Light drinker ) was so scared of the ABV that he had to split one with me, but he liked this beer a lot!"
"This is pretty good for what it's trying to be. I wouldn't always be in the mood for something like this, but when craving something sweeter I would certainly put this on the list for consideration. I like what Lagunitas does."
"Light but delicious. Though very odd indeed. A touch tannic on the finish and that detracts from the overall drinkability."
"Dark brown with a thin off-white lace. Deep, sweetish malt, spices, and dried fruit aroma, with a little booze. Similar in flavor: sweetish malts, dark fruit, and some alcohol. Baking spices and molasses overtones; hops lend balance and a hint of pineapple/ripe citrus. Body is lighter than the flavor would suggest, and the finish cleans up enough to fall just short of cloying at the back of the palate. A very nice beer, would make a great holiday sipper."
"The Hairy Eyeball is a strong heavy ale with very little feel, a tad too much sweetness, but with nice warmth on a cold winter day."
"Overall impression: probably my least favorite offering from Lagunitas. Not an easy drinker, and not very complex to the point that I enjoy sipping on it."
"Poured a reddish brown with a two-finger head that died slowly and left some lace. A very strong malt presence in the aroma; roasted and sweet along with some piney hops. A medium-bodied beer that I had to sip on as it is a little sticky and there are a good chunk of malts: caramel, bitter chocolate, toffee, coffee possibly and they definitely roasted some. Hop presence is minor but it gives off a sour fruit type taste. Balanced alright and passes the tongue leaving a dry backbite. A good ale that is worth trying."
"A good beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Alocohol is well hidden. Definitely drinkeable for the style, but after 2 I'd be hard pressed to handle another. But who really needs more than 2 of this style anyway?"
"I did try this beer and I hate it. I will drink anything and everything. This beer was just not my thing. I would suggest that you do try it because Laginitas dose a great job at brewing and I find no real flaws with this beer (other than I don't Like its taste). I read the reveiw prior and I think this guy did like it and describe it correctly. I'll post his quote now ""caramel, burnt sugar, golden raisins, with a slowly drying lightly bitter finish. Uninspiring..."" and I would add very slightly if any bitter finish. OUT of BALANCE. raisen bomb. poop! but I'm an IPA lover so go figure. You decide!"
"Pours a hazy, dark brown with less than a fingers worth of head. Nice ruby highlights. Smell is a bit muted but full of malts. Not much of a hop presence. Very nice peachy, apricot smell. Expecting a malt bomb here. Super malty and rich. Plums and dark cherries are present. Just a bit of spices (cinnamon and nutmeg). Very nice mouthfeel, thick and creamy. It actually is a very drinkable Am. Strong ale. Goes down very smooth and easy. Very nice beer."
"Alcohol is well-hidden on the palate but by the end becomes evident in its effect. Overall, this is a solid beer but nothing overly spectacular. Would probably pair nicely with some mild milk chocolate or a maple-accented dessert."
"Very drinkable givin the abv. but I wouldn'y have more than 2 of these, especially if they were pints. Very glad I tried it."
"Like I said, not sure there is anything out there to compare this too. It's a really good beer that is so unique. I may just have to pick some more up to age and see how it develops. Recommend giving this one of a kind beer a try."
"The flavor profile is a bit weak. Not really interesting enough to warrant revisiting - maybe I should have gone with the Yakima Twilight instead..."
"D - This tastes good, has an amazing mouthfeel, and left me wanting another. Didn't feel or taste the booze. Pretty strong flavor though, and I probably wouldn't want more than two in one sitting. I had a second draft a few days later at another bar, and took the same tasting notes."
"a really great aftertaste with this beer, fairly easy drinking, not spectactular but solid."
"Mouthfeel, all the flavors come and go, then come again. Light biscuity bitterness. Very drinkable, its cheap, high in alcohol, low in presence."
"D- This was a decent brew overall but not one of lagunitas stronger"
"Drinkability: the hairy eyeball is very much a sipper to me. While I would not hesitate to have it again, it's definitely a one-at-a-time beer to sit back and appreciate."
"Drinkability: This is the second bottle I've had of Hairy Eyeball, and I just don't get it. I might have another bottle, but only if there's nothing better available."
"D: so i tried this again just now and tastes noticeably different, still has this odd hop finish lingers on the palate, but all-in-all a pretty decent brew"
"drinkability: it was an alright beer. a little on the sweet end."
"Great Ale."
"D – I like either the appearance or the name of the beer most; the rest of the beer is so-so."
"Hairy eyeball is a pretty good strong beer, not as hoppy as DIPAs but not a super sweet malt bomb either. A nice change of pace and a pretty good winter beer."
"This is a big brew, but with an ABV of 8.8% it's not out of control. Sweet and savory, it's got a little something for most beer lovers. Not for the faint of heart, but strong ales rarely are. Another solid effort from Lagunitas."
"Another nice offering from Lagunitas. Well priced! Pours a very dark brown, light head and lacing. Smells like hops and malts! Dark fruits. Creamy and on the drier side. This makes a nice sipper in the winter. There isn't much to say about this one except for it totally fits in the Lagunitas lineup."
"D- Very drinkable in terms of hiding its high alcohol content, however I can't see myself drinking more than a couple in a sitting."
"A decent beer, but a bit disappointing from Lagunitas."
"drinkability: i remember this one being alot better. perhaps my palate has developed since last year or perhaps i dont remember that well. i remember it being more like a classic american barleywine. still a well masked high abv and affordable."
"The alcohol is oh so well hidden in this, but after three bottles I was feelin' nice and relaxed. The mouthfeel on this one is very satisfying. Thanks again La-Goo-Knee-Tuss."
"taste - Oh yeah! A creamy, malty, fruity spicy, near perfect mix."
"Overall this is a solid beer however it's a bit too sweet for my tastes. Worth a shot, even more so if you enjoy the maltier side of things."
"There was a time, a time not too long ago, where a man (in this case) could stand side by side with a robot, and enjoy a beer together. This was that beer. But the new batch of Hairy Eyeball may just be too young. Red and lucid like the eye of a robot (think Johnny 5 pre-electroshock) it appears the same beer. But the je ne sais quoi that once dwelled within has vanished. There was something there, something we shared. Now it is gone. Perhaps only time can bring that back. For now, though, its chemical alcohol smell and a flavor without that backlash of grassiness make this, perhaps for the first time ever, a beer reserved more for robots *sniff* than for me. In the future, I too will be robotic and this will be my beer of choice, for I am a Lagunaut."
"D: I loved the 2008 vintage and I drank several bottles of it throughout the year. My palate has changed considerably since then; I think it's an enjoyable mid-range beer, best consumed fresh."
"Pours a dark brown body with a reddish tint that's easy to see through. The head is maybe the best part about this beer, it stick around for quite some time and leaves lots of nice lacing. Smells strongly of alcohol with some malt, hops, brown sugariness, and dark fruit. Taste is alright for me, a little over-hopped in my opinion. Theres some decent complexity, I just don't love the taste. Overall it was alright, I don't think I'll seek it out again."
"D = not so much. Perhaps at a beer tasting or a festival, but for me this would not be placed into my collection of ""drinking"" beers, so much as ""appreciation of brewing skill"" beers. Food pairing: Mutton. Goat, or Game, but as a palate cleansing beverage, not a ""beer with dinner"""
"D - Extremely drinkable and extremely delicious. Alcohol barely noticeable, was surprised to see 8.8%. Only bought a single bottle, will seek out more."
"What hurts it overall is its lack of substance and body. Nice to sip and it would pair well with a good cigar."
"Style is an American strong ale. That is exactly what it is: strong. There is not much hiding the alcohol. Theres some great spice and toasty malts, but the alcohol bite is present in the sip. Don't let you believe this is a boring or overwhelming beer. It is actually really interesting and good. The mouthfeel was the only off part for me. I felt it could have been more balanced instead of sweet."
"I've had this at least 5 times before tonight and each time I've been equally impressed. This beer isn't for everyone. The alcohol isn't hidden well and the flavor profile is very powerful. This is one of the more complex beers I've had. Just my opinion. Aside from the buttery, toffee flavors there is many fruit and spice flavors to round this one out. Taste is very unique and overwhelming in a good way. Mouthfeel combines silky, chewy and creamy into one long finish."
"D - This was almost drinking like a barleywine to me...maybe my bottle was a couple months old...but all in all a decent beer with some nice complexity to it...maybe it's better a little older?"
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at Oaktree in NJ. Upon pouring into my shaker glass, the ale appears a clear deep brown color with about an inch of tan foam. Nose and flavor are of toffee, caramel, bitter, biting hops, very slight citrus note. medium in both body and carbonation with a lingering bitterness."
"D: Enjoyable in winter I'd say. Strong but tasty. I'd buy another 6-pack, but I wouldn't drink two in a row."
"Final thoughts: This is an interesting change for Lagunitas from the really hoppy beers. Its pretty interesting for a dark American strong ale. Nice dark fruits and malts, touch of hops, a little sweet. However I could expect a little more from this beer, it just seems like something is missing."
"this beer pours a hazy reddish brown color with an off white head that fades to a sheet of lace leaving rings around the glass. the aroma brings loads of roasted malt and a bit of fruit at the back, maybe some yeast esters. the taste doesn't disappoint with the sweet nearly sticky maltiness, and the fruity flavors this is a pretty flavorful beer, the alcohol and astringency at the end are there, but not bad for nearly nine percent. great carbonation, thanks to Sam the Beer Man, with their nice five beer growler line up."
"Unsure where the name came from; expected a punch in the face, but is surprisingly ""sweet"" and mellow."
"honestly this was hard to drink..very malty, with a very heavy alcohol taste. I Tried during memorial day as a sipper..I would try others If I was new to the game!!! If you want to start on a Lagunitas brew I suggest Hop Stoopid."
"Lagunitas Hairy Eyeball is a red-brown ale with particles afloat. It has a small, dense, sand colored head that leaves tenacious lacing. It has a sweet, malty aroma with a grassy note. It has a smooth medium body with a slightly sticky finish. It's pretty sweet and resiny. It's reasonably bittered; the green, fruity bitterness shows up at the finish and provides the aftertaste. It's a touch heavy for a session ale."
"Great smell and a good looking beer. Appearance is very dark and the smell malty and strong caramel notes. Def a session beer with great caramel feel. Too heavy for me to go more than one but worth trying and having a good conversation with - as noted in previous posts not much carbonation even on the tap"
"Pours a clear red with 2 fingers of dense, sticky foam. Nose is caramelly malt for the most part, and a hint of floral hops. Very malty and very bitter flavour. Tons of dark caramel sugars and dark fruit and toasty grain. Hints of apple and juicy citrus hops. Fairly heavy body but with a good deal of carbonation as well. Feels quite prickly on the tongue. Not in any way sessionable. Lots of flavour but also very heavy brew."
"Notes - Needs more carbonation"
"Taste: Doesn't taste as good as it smells. The taste of this beer isn't really working for me. Flowery hop taste, dark sweet malts, little buttery taste. I just don't care for the taste."
"Pours a clear, but dense, dark copper color with 2 fingers of rocky, creamy light tan colored head that never fully disappears. The aroma is very malty and heavy with toffee, molasses and a touch of hops. The flavor is sweet malt, some citrus hops and finishes very strong with brown sugar and a very noticeable alcohol presence. Its full to medium bodied that is a touch sticky. I would say this beer is a pretty cross between a scotch ale and a malty barleywine. Overall, I'm just not impressed with it. Alcohol is a little too noticeable."
"This beer pours an amberish brown, nice reddish hues with a one finger of light tannish head. Head recedes quickly and leaving spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is very sweet - sugar, caramel malts, and some candied dark fruits. Taste is of sweet malts and sugar at first. VERY, very sweet beer. The middle is of dark fruits, though still very sweet - like candied dark fruits, and caramel. The finish leaves a very sweet aftertaste to it. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, thick syrupy mouthfeel to it with an aftertaste similar to when you eat too much candy. The alcohol is very well hidden. For me, the sweetness was overkill that lowered it's drinkability."
"A solid, (sweet) beer."
"I must say that this is perhaps the first beer that I noticed flavors hitting me in a particular sequence, which I though was pretty cool. A very nice strong ale that deserves time and contemplation. I could see myself drinking this over a particularly sharp and tactical chess game."
"D- I would drink this again if given the chance."
"If it was just the fruit adding the sweetness this would be a winner, but I suspect there is some extra sugar in there as well, making this just too sweet."
"Pours a deep red with a sizeable cream- color head that fades to a good lace. Smell is a sweet, sugary caramel and... Is that cheese? Taste is immediately sweet malt. LOT of sweet malts. It's syrupy and really sweet. I think it tastes more like a Maibock. Once you muddle through the sugar slush, there is a very light hop that quickly becomes alcohol which fades into the aftertaste. It's really just too sweet for me. Mouthfeel is syrup. Not that drinkable. I love lagunitas but I'm not sure about this one"
"* Twisted-off with the bottom of my Erdinger Champ bottle. See, I told you I would use it to open a bottle."
"A deep dark clear amber body with a thick offwhite head, light to meduim carbonation , lots of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt , with a bit of spicy hops,and just a hint of alcohol. Flavor is rich like caramelized sugar,rasins and dry malt grains,with some zesty piny hop notes,honey, a little spice like maybe peppercorn or something like that but very faint, full body with a smooth texture, nice malty finish, the 9% ABV was well hidden. This was a really good drinker, I plan to buy more."
"Jolly rancher beer with cola-esque caramel. Again, nice balance. Mild herbal hop spice and no sign of a 8.7% abv. Syrupy mouthfeel."
"Cheers."
"D: For such a high ABV very drinkable, although I don't think I'll be having again as this is very hard to find in DFW. I got the last one in the only store that I found it at."
"Good, but not top notch. This particular specimen may have spent too long in the fridge (~1 month). I say it's one step away from being a barley wine, and that might be where it should be taken on the next batch."
"I would drink this beer as one of my first choices any time I see it available and I want a Strong Ale. Especially if it is 2-4-1 happy hour at E St!"
"Very dark mahogany color. 2-3 finger tannish head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is so sweet it reminds me of lemonade and cookie dough. Very malty and sugary taste. Tastes almost like brown sugar in beer version. Not much bitter taste in the front but the aftertaste reminds me of a barleywine. Overall a great beer. A little high in ABV to drink too many but I'm definitely good for 2 or 3."
"4.5 D: What an odd and surprisingly awesome beer. This is tasy enough to drink several more times."
"d: considering i enjoy barleywines, this is more drinkable, but might not be so approachable for everyone"
"D: This is a good winter style. Reminds me of an Americanized dubbel overall. I enjoyed it on a nice 70 degree day after dinner, but I think it would be better at about 20 degrees on an autumn or winter day. Does every beer this brewery put out taste so good?"
"Decent beer, don't know that I'd seek it out in the future."
"California is without doubt the most competitive of American states as far as craft breweries go. Of all its many great micros I have no reservations about calling Lagunitas one of my favourites. They not only have a charming attitude towards work and life, as illustrated in their hilarious write ups and company mentality, but a kick-ass lineup of beer to boot. Lagunitas: don't stop what you're doing because I don't ever want to stop drinking it."
"D - Nice offer to try!"
"Easy to drink. The alcohol is noticable but not overbearing in the least. I'll be looking for this one in the future."
"Pretty heavy body, but a pretty smooth drinker."
"D- Nice beer couldn't drink all night but is a great winter time beer."
"D - Not bad, but would like more flavors, perhaps more spices."
"Blipped ""Eyeball Kid"" by Tom Waits"
"This beer poured a dark red with purple highlights and a single-finger head. The smell is a mix of many different things, including toasted malt, at least a couple kinds of hops, dark fruit, molasses, and alcohol. The taste starts off with a sweet candylike malt that reminds me of a belgian tripel that gives way to some grassy then citrusy hops that balance it out very well. This is a beer that deals in extremes while remaining very tasty. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a little slickness and warming from the alcohol, with mild carbonation. This beer is surprisingly drinkable for a high ABV beer with a fair amount of hops. Great beer, everyone should try it at least once."
"D: It's rich and a bit heavy, not to mention sweet, but that doesn't mean you can't drink a few. I don't know that I'd drink it with some other beer to follow."
"Thin head with good retention, mixture of bubble sizes knit together well, dark cream white in color, moderate lacing. Dark brown to red in color, perfect clarity, richness of hue keeps it sitting impressively in the glass. Thickly constructed nose of toffee, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, date, plum fruit, some doughiness but not a lot of roast or toast, nothing beyond minor presence of hoppy citrus or flowers, malt city. In the mouth it's full-bodied and heavy, pretty much squats on the palate. This even with credibly strong carbonation. There's more pine and mixed white citrus here, however, the smart money is still on the toffee, chocolate, caramel and honey flavors. The fruit as in the nose half raisin and date, half plum and cherry. Its cloying qualities make it pull up short rather than extend through a longer finish. Flavor intensity is a plus, just wears you down some, not sure I could finish two bottles in a row without feeling bloated."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0903-Patrick"
"D: Eh...I don't know on this one, lots of interesting flavors, and my tongue and head just don't know where to go on this one. I could maybe drink a second, but definitely not a third. Quite an interesting beer. Lots and lots of things going on. I'd recommend this to anybody that likes dopplebocks and scottish ales."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer. I'd have no problem drinking another one... or two!"
"D: This is a decent, easy to drink beer. Different than what I expected, but definitely worth a try"
"Overall a very solid beer with a tight flavor profile. The rich malts dominated everything through enough hops shone through to provide a nice balance to it. Reminded me of bigfoot."
"12oz bottle into a Lucifer tulip pours a crisp brown with a decent khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is burnt caramel, dried fruit and a hint of wood. The taste is a strange blend of caramel, brown sugar and dried fruits that gives way to a balanced taste of pine hops and caramel malts.. The beer is medium bodied with smooth carbonation and some warming alcohol that shows in the finish. This is certainly an interesting beer, but I was hoping for something better."
"Very drinkable with a nice mouthfeel. Extremely impressive for a 8.8% ABV beer!"
"D: Drinkable for >8% abv; beer doesn't disguise it. Nice malt characters and hop balance. Not overly complex; nicely balanced."
"The drink is fullish-medium in body with an excellent sizzle of fine carbonation. Though Hairy Eyeball is quite potent at 8.7% ABV, it remains pretty mild in flavor with admirable alcohol suppression that leaves the beer plenty drinkable."
"As the alcohol rises the drinkability starts to lower, but this still works fine, just a slower sipping beer."
"Taste is not quite as gummy as the nose, but it is still there. Residual sugar sweetness is actually a good thing in this beer, as it helps keep the high alcohol and (what seem to be) high AA hops in check. Body is full, almost syrupy...but oh so easy to drink. This one is a beer geek's wet dream. Definitely recommended."
"D-Not a great one in my book, and seemed to overall lack a sense of balance and what flavors are supposed to be accentuated."
"D - Reasonably drinkable for what it is. Nice mocha character, not too complex but enjoyable and pretty well balanced."
"Label show IBU's of 56.7 vs. Maximus of 72.41. The taste is no where near that close. Big use of malt hides the hops in this one."
"It's more drinkable than it should be. Not heavy at all yet still very flavorful. It compares very favorably to Arrogant or Double Bastard if that is your thing. I would say it's as drinkable as either and, honestly, better than."
"Notes: This is the one and only time that I bought a case of any beer since I really started getting into finding and rating a lot of different beers. I did so since last year I was so impressed with this one and I went back to the same store (World Wines and Liquor in Mentor) to discover that it is a seasonal. I was not going to let that happen again. Also it was an early (not the first) craft beer that really turned me on to the scene. Really though, this is a great beer!"
"Notes - In summary, this is a good beer that's a bit too sweet even for my sweet tooth."
"Again, if I were rating this as a Barleywine, it would rate higher. As it is I love this beer. It's worth searching out."
"Not a bad beer at all, I'm glad I picked it up on a whim. Definitely one that is worth a try. I probably won't be buying it again anytime soon though because while it wasn't bad it didn't impress me that much either."
"D- This one is definitely a sipper, but it does drink pretty good for a beer of it's strength. Overall, Hairy Eyeball is is pretty solid beer that I would definitely purchase again. Recommneded."
"D. Would struggle to drink more than one of these in a row, but liked it none the less. A little too sweet/not hoppy enough for me. Although my favorite style is a IIPA so go figure."
"A heavy-flavored beer with some alcohol punch, not exactly something I'd double-down on. Very tasty, but a ""one is enough"" per sitting type of brew. I enjoyed it, and would seek it for a return to the style. Price is right ($2.15 for a 1 oz. single)."
"It pours a nice mahogany color in the glass, with light brown foam and plenty of lacing on the glass. Slightly nutty aroma. The flavor is far more substatial than the aroma, and has plenty of nut malt goodness, with a brown sugar sweetness. This one is definately malt dominated, but finishes with a slightly earthy, grassy hops. Really liked the warm blend of flavors, here. Some heft in the mouthfeel from all that malt. Very smooth, and drinkable beer, especially if you don't mind all the sweetness."
"D - I like this."
"D= This is a unique beer, but not one I could ever drink more than 1-2 of in a sitting. Would appeal to those who like very sweet beers."
"Very nice texture on this medium heavy bodied beer, feels great in the mouth with just enough carbonation to tickle the taste buds but not ruin the creamy texture of the beer. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, only detected in the mild warming sensation it imparts. I first tried this beer at a beerfest a couple weeks ago and really enjoyed it so when I saw a 6-pack at my local beer store I couldn't resist. It tastes every bit as good as I remember!"
"A very nice strong ale I would definitely enjoy drinking many more of.."
"pours a little thin, and not much head. a little murky and plain brown. smell is sweet with just a little funk. Definately not overpowering, but noticeable. Taste is also sweet, malty with alittle brett funk and sugar. Good finish, and is sweet and hides the high alcohol. Mouthfeel is decent, fairly smooth, nothing special is pretty drinkable and decent all around. Nothing amazing for this style, but pretty good and worth the money to try. Sweet and a different than most other american wilds I have had, just not too special."
"D - Not really my cup of tea. Pretty subtle in aroma and flavor, overall. Not bad per se, but just not a style that appeals to me compared to a DIPA, Imperial Stout or even a good old fashioned pilsner."
"Verdict: Hairy Eyeball is somewhat similar to Brown Shugga', but certainly different enough to warrant its existence. Perfect for a cold and drizzly day like today. I'll be aging a couple of bottles next to the bottles of Brown Shugga' to see how it evolves."
"Lagunitas... one of my favorite breweries. Not only are their beers all delicious and consistent, but they are all high ABV and well priced too... (usually like 8.99 or 9.99 a 6 pack or 3.99 a bomber) This beer is no exception, pours a nice dark red/brown. Tons of lacing and good head retention, sexy. On the light bodied side, very sweet taste to it. Sort of took me by surprise but it had a nice mouthfeel to it. Very hoppy but well balanced with the sweetness. Some alcohol taste kicks in at the end, but it has a nice warming appeal to it. The sweetness was a tad bit too present for me, but other than that this is a great beer... here's lookin atcha!"
"That being said, it is not a bad beer at all.. Dark amber/brown pour. Fruity, bready, malty smell with caramel (again, think bock). The flavors are very malty, with caramel and a cola-like taste, raisins, and only a trace of bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a full-mouthed presence.. Again, its very similar to say an eisbock or perhaps a darker scotch ale.. Definitely good, but nothing unique."
"All in all, pretty dang drinkable for a strong ale. A bit syrupy/sweet on the whole, but that's not necessarily bad. I wouldn't want to drink more than one or two, but I'm sure I could. Kind of reminds me of Brown Sugga, but with a bit more hops, a bit more sweetness, and a bit more strong. Nothing really amazing, but an all-round impressive strong ale."
"A good American strong ale for a cold night."
"Pours out a dark brown that isn't completely opaque with a small white head. Minimal lacing. Smell is kinda metallic more than anything. First taste is of the chocolate-ish malts. Hardly any hop bite at the end. Definatly a sweet beer. Mouthfell makes this a good drinker, alchol isn't overpowering and carbonation is just right."
"Not one of my favorates, its just to malty for me"
"i did save one for aging purposes and will compare it to next year's batch."
"D: another plus on the list of beers for me. Lagunitas makes another tasty and voluptuous brew. Also, almost 9% in the firewater category...I would not believe it for a second this is very tame"
"This a great brew. A perfect choice for a cold weather sipper. Another top notch brew from the folks at Lagunitas."
"Pours a very dark brown with some cherry red hues. The small tan head fades fast and leaves a couple of small fingers of lace sticking out. Notes of burnt sugar, tree bark, pine resin and dark fruits (plums, prunes, grapes) rise to the nose. A vinegary essence is noticed as well. Tastes sweet and sugary, but not cloying. There's a good hop bite mixed in along with some more dark fruits. Mouth-feel is a bit creamy at first with some dryness working itself in over time. It lies just between medium and heavy. A slight shake foments a small and quick bubble blast, indicating a low level of carbonation. The alcohol becomes more evident as the drink warms. This is kind of like a subdued barleywine, and it has a really cool name. All in all, I'd say it's a damn good drink."
"D- it drinks well, though i would not have more than 2 or 3. it fills you up for sure. overall, pretty good."
"Pours a clear copper color with two fingers of tan head that had good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Figs and prunes is what I get from the aroma. Some alcohol is also detected. Very malty charactor in the flavor. Dark fruits again, especially figs comes to mind. Sort of a sticky sweet aftertaste and the alcohol is barely noticed. A tad overcarbonated but otherwise a nice body. Nice flavors but something I would grow tired of after one, maybe two bottles. The high ABV does not help drinkability."
"This poured a clear, dark cherry color with tan head. It smelled like raisin and prune with brown sugar, earthy whole wheat, and a bit of sweet chocolate. It tasted like fresh barley and oak with some wild yeast, and a bit of semi-sweet chocolate and sour cherries and alcohol. It was quite thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a nice malty scent and a clean flavor, but wasn't as sweet as expected. (Perhaps it would sweeten with age?) The wild/sour flavors also didn't seem to fit. It had a very nice full body, and was fairly easy to drink despite some alcohol being noticeable. I enjoy this beer, but there is certainly room for improvement."
"A nice beer year after year from a local brewery."
"D- Not sure what to thin of this but I have to say there are lot of better offerings in this style and by this brewer."
"Overall- This is a bold beer that has a lot going on. Lots of big flavors that make you want more."
"Nice. This is almost like a really high octane English Barleywine with an unusual yeast being used."
"Not bad. Enjoyable, but a bit standard. Worth a try though."
"Overall this is a really good Ale!"
"Drinkability: Probably a little more drinkable than the average Strong Ale due to the light mouthfeel, I wouldn't drink more than 2 in a sitting."
"D: I'm pretty impressed with this. Quite complex and definitely delicious. For its high alcohol content, it drinks nicely. I'll look for this one earlier next year - very appealing."
"The taste has a bit of an ABV throaty burn, but not bad at all for an 8.8% beer. The taste has the berry sweetness indicative of the nose, there is some hop punch in the beer; there are some barleywine qualities in the beer. It is pretty full bodied, a tad syrupy, pretty low carbonation, a bit sweet and sticky, a touch cloying, but overall this is a good beer. The beer has a sweet liqueur quality to it in the best sense, without the alcohol harshness, although there is plenty of ABV in the beer that is more warming than anything else. Overall, the beer is quite complex and enjoyable."
"Good drinkability but could have been bigger and I would've liked to taste a bit more alcohol in this one. A solid brew. nonetheless."
"D: With the 8.8% ABV I can't drink more than a few of these in a sitting, but it's not a bad beer."
"Drinkability: A solid Strong Ale from Lagunitas. Especially at around $9-$10 a sick-pack, you can make this one last over a long snifter session. I wish it packed more of a punch overall, and even though I don't smoke cigars, for some reason I imagine this is one that would go well with one. And not only that, it's warm out right now, in February in Richmond, and the beer is drinking just fine. That adds some points, since most would be reserved, at least for me, for winter."
"Tasty, pretty darn drinkable. Dangerously so, in fact. ABV contributes a bit to the taste, but it very well hidden nonetheless."
"Thin film of head disappears quickly over a brown body with copper and amber highlights. Smells of roasted dark malts, very sweet and pleasant fruits with the slightest alcohol coming through. Tastes of malts and hops, balanced so perfectly; flavors of nut and chocolate make me wonder if this beer is the spawn of a porter and a brown ale. Only the tiniest bit of sour and alcohol pulls through each sip. The mouthfeel is what is unattractive for me. Medium carbonation is just fine, but the beer itself is light, water and even thin. An exceptionally easy beer to drink overall--it's like the nearly 9% alcohol stayed in the bottle during the pour! I'd recommend Arrogant Bastard over this one in the category, but I'm pleased with this Lagunitas release. It's perfect for a rainy night."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some carbonation, a bit thin."
"6-pack/$11/Whole Foods"
"Pours a dark brown black color, almost no head, quickly diminishing. Tan in color. Strong dark fruit aroma, grape, some hops, some alcohol. Taste of alcohol, hoppy flavor, some of that dark fruit taste again. Letting warm up a bit, hopefully the alcohol taste will be mellowed. Not much mellower."
"I found the drinkability here as pretty easy and quite high. The texture is amazingly amble and fillingly rich with a nice taste to match its soothingly silkenesk flow. Nothing Hairy about it really. More like yummy!"
"""Quite right, Uncle Jimmy."""
"Overall a good beer but there are other examples of the style that I enjoy better like Double Bastard and Odell's ESR. Still a good offering and at a fair price."
"D - Not good for a session, but very drinkable for a strong ale. A little bit too sweet for me, but another solid brew from Lagunitas that comes at a terrific value (8.99/6 pack)"
"I am a fan of Lagunitas but have reservations about beer with high ABV. This beer drinks very smooth and has a great brown sugar and molasses taste to it. ABV is not prevalent...could drink a couple of these with no problems. I did not get much aroma from the beer which was a little suprising...overall would probably buy it again."
"D - Despite a very well-masked abv, drinkability suffers due to it being a rather uninspiring beer."
"Notes: just like Lagunitas - not a lot of anything here. its like they are too afraid of putting too much flavor in their beers. further evidence that lagunitas is overrated"
"All and all, a superb brew. Thanks Scott."
"I will be very honest, I did not really enjoy this beer. Appearance is good, nice deep brown color with a little head and no lacing. Smell is okay with lots of dried dark fruit right up front, a bit of hops and way too much alcohol for 8.80% in my opinion. Taste is more of the same but something doesn't mix well here. It goes sour and not in a good way. Mouthfeel is decent, slightly above medium body. Drinkability is not that good."
"The flavors are a bit rough, but the mouthfeel is fantastic. I believe a little age on this would do it alot of good. So lets see what 6 months gives us."
"Overall: All in all this is a good, unique brew. The flavors blend together almost a little too much and it becomes somewhat muddled, that and it has the slight metallic aftertaste. Otherwise this is another solid effort from Lagunitas."
"Date consumed: 7 September 2008"
"This wasn't a bad beer but it just seemed really boring to me. I wouldn't seek it out."
"Drinkability: A bit too sweet and a bit too coarse, though it fits the name."
"D: A solid sipper hybrid of styles I have here. Not blowing me away, but nice enough and good to drink. A solid brew from Lagunitas."
"Pours clear mahogany with a small tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma is malts, malts, and some fruits. Taste is more of the same, but with a handful of hops thrown in. The alcohol is more prevalent when the beer warms. A strong ale that could pass as a lighter barleywine."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown color with a thin off-white head. Pleasant aroma of dark fruit, maltiness, caramel and spice. Flavor very similar to aroma with strong malty presence as well as some fig, cinnamon and brown sugar notes."
"PH"
"Looks cloudy, no, murky, brown with no head and a certain mystery to it that I kind of like. It smells malty, woody, burnt caramel-ie, and other ""ieS"". Taste is like cola, with a crisp note that cuts through the sweet that dominates it. Surprisingly balanced & maybe attributable to the hops that accompany an ""American""... style definitions. Hops definitely come on in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is sticky & full-bodied. Good for the cold days they don't have in California. Drinkability is not bad, but this is a challenging beer & one I don't think I could put down a lot of. Not a knock on the beer at all, its just that if you're drinking a few, you don't always want to work that hard."
"D - This is a nice strong ale. Fairly easy-drinking despite the powerful ABV."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Deep mahogany color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Molasses nose. Flavor is sweet/roasted molasses some bitterness at finish. Higher ABV hidden and the high IBU (96.7) is not in your face. $1.67 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"After another 11 months, I tried another from the same six pack. The alcohol has mellowed considerably and a fruity complexity is far more apparent. The comparison to a fruitcake still stands and sweet dark fruits are more evident in the nose."
"The name is funny. There is nothing funny about the beer. Pours a deep amber color topped with a thin head. Aroma is quite sugary and alcoholic with plums and maybe some figs. The flavor consists of toasted malts, a rush of alcohol and sugars along with some dark fruit character; plums, figs and molasses. A real solid sipper while being easy to drink."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, deceptively strong kick, this is a very good beer to drink for a while if you want to try pounding a stronger beer."
"D: An excellent strong ale that stands up to the best in this style. Lagunitas brews definitely deserve more attention! This is a fine beer."
"A beer that would be excellent in autumn or early winter. Great session beer."
"Deep, deep chestnut color. Nice malty aroma with a heavy hand of hops thrown in for good measure. Solid malty flavor up front. Treacle and caramel flavors. Strong hop presence. Somewhat syrupy sweet. Lingering bitterness and a slight dryness as the sweetness fades. Good solid body-very full. I get a lot of strong ales of this abv with an alcohol burn present-none here. Good solid effort form a great brewery. Not over the top like some US strongs."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Alcohol is moderate, and flavor is good making for a nice and easily consumed beer."
"Drinkability: Much less malty than the other Lagunitas strong ale that's commonly available (the Brown Shugga'), and a little more up my alley - more complex, more subtle. That being said, the abv% is still up there, so be careful. Interesting, and I'd recommend giving it a shot at least once."
"Bottle courtesy of Secret Santa: Poured a deep dark brown color ale with an average foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of big caramel malt is quite imposing and dominating. Taste is also dominated by some heavy caramel malt with some notes of bitter hops. Lacking some floral or citrus notes with not as much hops as I was expecting considering the brewery. Full body with average carbonation and no discernable alcohol. This one was a bit of a surprise considering the lack of hops (yes there is a lot but not as much as I would expect from Lagunitas) but the malt was very efficient."
"The body is full yet goes down well. This is a damn good brew whatever it is. Up there with Old Gnarly."
"D: Pretty good. I could drink the whole thing and although there was some alcohol present it didn't feel like 9% abv beer."
"Interesting, I'd definitely revisit."
"Alcohol is very nicely concealed. Too drinkable for such a strong ale."
"pours a deep mahogany brown with a modest head which dissipates quickly leaving a light lacing in my snifter ; a strong smell, cereal grains, dark fruits, caramels, alcohol and licorice, a touch of hops and smoke detected as well ; a rich, sweet, malty flavor full of nuts, dates and fig well balanced with hop bitterness ; a full bodied brew with moderate carbonation ; not a bad beer at all, pretty drinkable for a 9% ABV..."
"D:"
"D - Malty and slightly boozy making it a bit cloying. Hard to have more than 1 in a sitting. Reminds me of a milder version of brown shugga."
"Not as spicy as I remember from the bottle, but still very complex and tasty, not to mention quite large. Recommended."
"Overall, a superb brew with some kick. Highly recommened for American Strong Ale advocates."
"D : Really good and easy drinking. You don't feel the alcohol"
"Poured into a pint glass pours an impressive reddish brown with some serioud head that leaves some thick fat lace on the glass. Smell is very sweet with hints of raison and maple in there also a bit of sweet molasses. Taste is pretty awesome of raison with malt backbone and a bit of a hop bitterness. This is pretty awesome stuff and rivals what some of the other big players are doing out their for their strong ales, In my book simply put, awesome stuff."
"-Oelergud"
"I love the name of this beer, it's great. Should have been the name of their double IPA though but I digress. Poured a nice dark reddish brown with a wee head. The nose was refreshing with sweet milk chocolate notes and a hint of citrus. The taste was equally malty but balanced well with the hops and fairly smooth on the palate. It was warming but you don't notice the hefty ABV too much in the taste."
"This beer is big bodied and definitely a sipper. The more it warms (and the more it warms me up) I can really start to appreciate it. Not for the faint of heart or the newly converted."
"D-One per sitting is all I'd recommend. Maybe two if you're brave. Very enjoyable beer."
"Slightly deceptive in terms of potency, this beer seems like you could have several--the flavor seems innocent enough."
"I bought this bottle as a 12oz single at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"Pours a dark brown. The smell is malty and earthy. The taste had a lot of sweetness in it. Caramel all over the place. To me it's maybe on the verge of being cloying. What this reminded me of is Leffe Brown which is way too sweet, almost sugary for me. The malt predominates big time in this beer. I probably wouldn't get it again although maybe I can see a beer with this sort of taste being ok in certain situations (ie maybe some sort of food pairing)."
"Needs more hop to balance out such a brew, seems almost like a sweet dobble bock. Nothing hairy about this brew, the 9% is NOT to be felt. But, by mid-bottle, the sweetness settles (or is less noticeable)."
"D - This is a mind-blowing brew! It's extremely complex and tasty, and could serve as an excellent sipper or a semi-sessionable brew (for a short session at home, when no driving is necessary). When I first heard the name, I immediately associated a hairy eyeball with a ball sack or single nut, but then I realized that hairy eyeball probably refers to the blood shot state of inebriation that could be attained by drinking more than one of these bad mofos!"
"Overall enjoyable, enough carbonation that it wasn't too syrupy. Would've made a good session beer if it weren't for the high abv, but I enjoyed sipping this over an hour or so."
"Really nice and full body. Tasty, but not in my top 3 Lagunitas."
"Tastes like a boozy, slightly hoppy version of a brown ale. As the last beer of a long night, it was perfect after getting off work. It's a little too sweet and boozy for a session beer, however, so I opted to head home after polishing off my pint of this. I'd drink it again, but not more than one pint at a sitting."
"The follically gifted optical anatomy pours a deep clear ruby red with big bubbled off white head. smell is of maltiness with some clean sort of floral hop. Taste follows, predominantly malty but a noticeable spicy hop presence, but not very bitter. The brew is a good balance, but to me it is kind of boring. The flavor is nice and rich, but there is not alot of complexity here. Mouthfeel is good and viscous, drinkability is very good for a 9% brew. A good one, threw one in the cellar just to see what happens. Good beer, but nothing worth seeking out."
"Drinkability - Quite easy drinking despite the ABV. Overall a very well put together strong ale. Although a little more complexity would be nice..."
"I very much enjoyed this beer, and will definitely drink again, and recommend it to anyone."
"Smooth, juicy and clean with very fine carbonation. Plenty of warmth and a mild dryness in the finish. Medium bodied throughout. A nice selection and one of the better strong ales I've had in quite some time."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a tasty and interesting beer, but it's a bit much to be more than a one and done. But with that said, the one glass was well worth trying."
"Not bad. I am not sure I'd go out of my way to buy another sixer. Hard to classify this beer. American brown ale? I really enjoy all the Lagunitas beers, but this one did not really stand out for anything in particular. At 9%, it is a monster so it is not really a ""session beer"" and I am not sure I would want to spend some of my soberness on this beer."
"Pours a clear brown to maroon color with a large creamy tan head that lasts a bit. Looks quite nice in the glass. Smell is bright and fruity and delicious sweet malt up front. Body is semi creamy with flavors of sticky malt, light alcohol and a slick mouthfeel and a complementing moderate hop bitterness. Kind of a dark toffee toasty hopped maltiness, and I thought it was pretty good, and very drinkable for 9%. Nice beer."
"Great sweet malty goodness, decent alcohol burn, nice balance, not overly hoppy, good session beer. Nice head but not foamy. No aftertaste to speak of. Best served on the warm side. Good with salami and cheese. Could have used slightly more carbonation to bring up the scores in appearance, smell and mouthfeel. Taste was excellent, not a treat, not a utility beer. Reserve for good friends and pathetic souls who have never had a really good beer."
"Overall: I enjoy the hop forward brews Lagunitas puts out. This is not one of my favorites and one I will most likely pass on in the future."
"D- This beer has a nice big malt profile that is not too sweet and the alcohol is very well hidden. This makes a great sipper but it really catches up to you with the 8% ABV."
"Drinkability is pretty high, a smooth and simple stronger ale with a clean profile and high digestibility. Still it's pretty sugary, and with the higher ABV, I doubt I'd enjoy more then 2 or 3 of these."
"Overall, it is a nicely drinkable beer. The candy sweetness and minty hops are not quite my preference, but it is certainly quaffable. Worth a try, but not my first choice."
"Overall not a bad beer but I would probably only drink one or two due to the richness of the brew."
"All in all, an odd juxtaposition of light and refreshing and bursts of intensity. Drinkable, but not too memorable."
"Tried this for $4.75 at Four Moon Tavern in Chicago."
"Overall a nice strong ale. Not the best from Lagunitas, but well worth drinking."
"D. Hard to finish. The rest of the 6 pack is going in the cellar. Hopefully it gows to meet it's reputation."
"Really quite delicious, a very enjoyable strong ale that masks the high ABV (8.8%) very well. Excellent."
"D- A little strong for too many but it's deceptive. Very good beer all around. I love this brewery"
"This strong ale is very easy to drink. Almost too easy. I'll definitely have again."
"Overall very drinkable, and no idea about the 8.8%..."
"Dark brown color with a nice creamy tan head that lingers. Enjoyable aroma of malts, caramel, and hops. Enjoyable taste, similar to the smell, but with some nuts and spices in there. Nothing overpowering; nicely balanced and not too complex. A very rich beer, and well worth trying. Goes down rather smooth and nicely. And, despite the strong ABV, it's really quite drinkable."
"Full-bodied and evenly carbonated but a touch slick on the finish. Otherwise just fine. Highly drinkable ale and it seems to have something to appeal to both hopheads and malt-fiends alike. Check that, the booze really sneaks up on you and could easily render you silly if not careful. Down goes the drinkability..."
"No room for head on the heavy pour from the bar. Great lacing, opaque brew, dark amber body. Knocking points off smell here as I was getting a low to no smell, taste is where this one wins. Sweet and hoppy, almost double IPA flavors. Carbonation on the tongue is mild but noticeable. Excellent balance of malts and hops. Full body beer, good mouth fill. A good session beer for me."
"Strong ale is the correct description. Strange name. Bottle does not give a clue as to the type of beer. Tastes linger including hoppiness, a little caramel, aftertaste, pleasant mouthfeel. Aftertaste also stays in the mouth and on the tonue. Pleasant look."
"I had a Lumpy Gravy last night and thought that would be similar to the flavors of this beer. At $9.49/sixer this is a good value for a well done American Strong."
"D: No idea what to make of this other than a wonderfully tasty beer, and another score from Lagunitas."
"D - Not an everyday beer, but one I would not turn down if given the chance."
"Recommended."
"D- I was pleasantly surprised, a tastey brew overall, not a sessionable one for me though."
"I could not drink too many of this beer. Probably only one actually. It is far too sugary and the caramel is overpowering. Considering caramel is not my favorite flavor, this is understandable. Others might feel differently."
"D: Not interested in having any more of these, a bit of a let down. The alcohol showed up more as the beer went down."
"D- Only the strength of this beer would stop me from drinking this all night."
"Sweet and smooth are the two main flavors here. There is a slight hop to the aftertaste but is very barely detectable. That is, until you drink more. The hops tend to build the more your drink it (as far as the aftertaste goes). All in all, this is a very drinkable beer and at 9%abv it's definitely a keeper."
"Another great offering from Lagunitas. I seem to look forward to each of their seasonal releases, as they are all very tasty. The one starts off with a nice, deep mahogany color, with a tan head. The lacing is great. Not any hop smell, and it is definately a warming drink. Half-way through the glass my stomach is feeling toasty! This beer is similiar to my favorite offering of Lagunitas, Brown Shugga, it just seems a bit lighter and less sweet. Both have a remarkable mouthfeel and drinkability given their ABV. Well done Lagunitas!"
"This is a pretty tasty brew. It's quite potent and meaty. I would buy this again. A fine American style barleywine/Strong ale. It would probably cellar really well."
"Overall, not bad. But I don't see myself having more than 1 of these due to the mouthfeel and drinkability."
"The beer poured a light ruby-red with a creamy half inch head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. There was a slight scent of fruity malt, but no discernable hop aroma. The taste was a fairly nice balance between the malt, hops, and alcohol, with the hop bitterness winning out in the end. Nice carbonation and lacing, with a coating of sweet malt residue in my mouth after every swallow. Tasty."
"Drinkablity: Interesting and unique beer. Not as over the top as I expected."
"The Hairy Eyeball is more interesting than my palate can pick out.. I have some of last years in the cellar.. I must give one a try pretty soon."
"A solid strong ale, just a little too sweet to have more than 1 in a sitting. A good value for the price."
" Alcohol harshness has subsided, rich caramel flavor. No hops. Overall a very good candidate for aging."
"Overall, an excellent choice in the Lagunitas lineup. Sure, I prefer Unibroue's various takes on the Strong ale. But they're also quite a bit more expensive. Seems to fit well with Lagunitas' position as a brewery - not necessarily the best, but you get a lot for the money."
"Tasty beer, one I should have tried long ago, but kept passing up. Dammed if I'm not kicking myself now. Defiantly worth picking up the single, I'll have to get a sixer next time. Really really drinkable for a 9% beer."
"Huge body, a little more balance/age would help."
"Better than I would have thought based on my initial impressions from the bottle, but it could be better. I'd try it again."
"This is another great beer from Lagunitas."
"I felt like I was sick and my mom was forcing me to take the cough syrup"
"Overall, more of a doppelbock than I was expecting. Good, but with not much to offer."
"D- Decent. Doesn't blow me away. Kind of tame, but it sure gets the job done."
"M: Medium to full bodied, nice carbonation. Drinkability is alright, the alcohol is really warm on this one and that hurts a little, but not much."
"Nice body, but not so heavy that I wouldn't drink 2-3."
"D - pretty nice; I look forward to having another, though I'm not sure how many I could drink in one sitting. The ~9% is keeping me warm this evening. Would recommend trying."
"Toasted malts and herbal hop bitterness up front. Grape, prune, and powdered sugar sweetness come on strong. Sting of herbal, slightly piny hop bitterness tempers the sweetness. Fruity, warming alcohol before a finish of herbal hop bitterness and tangy-sweet grape juice. Pretty tasty. Medium-bodied with a slightly over-carbonated feel. A little creaminess wouldn't hurt. Another decent American strong ale from Petaluma!"
"Poured into a straight pint. Pours a rich mahogany color that when held up to light turns an amber color. Strong head that dissipates at a moderate rate, that eventually leads to outstanding lacing. amazing sweet malty aroma that also has a light floral hoppy aroma. Smells strong alcohol-wise as well. a slight hint of prunes finishes it off. This beer is so complex flavor-wise. The malts are sweet off the bat and the hops just kick the palate in the ass for the finish. Mouthfeel is overwhelming with all the flavor. Not quite a session beer but three of these and I am ready to party. Thank you Lagunitas!"
"Hairy Eyeball ale pours a dark copper from a brown twelve ounce bottle and displays quite a bit of ruby when held to the light. There is a thick ivory colored head. The aroma is malty and estery/fruity. The flavor is very fruity, and malty, not much hops, which only provide some bitterness. Alcohol is not really noticeable in the flavor as much as it is in how it's warming me. Not bad, worth a try."
"Another solid beer from Lagunitas. Nothing stellar or unique, but a fine beer nonetheless."
"D: At 9.0% this one could get one in trouble by ignoring the label and going by taste alone. Will have another and then move on to another."
"Lagunitas IPA was a personal favorite, so I had high hopes for this strong ale which stands with a hefty 9% ABV... Copped a single 12 oz bottle from Gary's in Madison... pours a deep, dark, mahogany, brown hue with minimal tan head... smell is complete with roasted malts, brown sugars, and dark fruits... taste complemented the aroma with a prune, fig, date essence... strong malts, caramel, honey, and dark-cherry flavor... a strong, sit-back-down-and-enjoy type of brew, one of the better ones from Lagunitas... packs a punch... good mouthfeel, and average drinkability... wouldn't specifically run out and cop this one again, but it was still a solid brew... strong, rich flavors with dark overtones... a good depiction of the style... Worth a try..."
"Nice mouth feel on this brew and a good finish, too. I'll definitely be drinking this one again!"
"Final Note: don't drink this one too cold, slightly chilled brings out all the delicious flavors."
"D: Overall typical lagunitas hopping and really nothing to get excited about. Some alcohol warming providing for a moderate good drinkability."
"Overall- Another good offering from Lagunitas."
"Poured a very viscous amber with virtually no head on it. Had the look of a high alcohol barleywine. Smelled cherries, wood, and maybe a little nuttiness right off the bat. Was expecting that same flavor of cherries but it was lacking a little. Very woody and caramel flavor with little bit of a bourbon(very light) feel. Malty backbone came through for a good balance with a clittle bit of citrus hops. Mouthfeel was fairly slick and oily but not over the top. I enjoyed this beer and it certainly didn't feel like 9%. I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again but didn't think it was spectacular."
"Bottle from Volo in a tulip glass. Poured a deep ruby, with a small tan head. Aroma contains hops, caramel and a touch of alcohol. Flavour reminded me a lot of bourbon - the alcohol came to the fore, and there was a pleasant oakiness. I think the oakiness balanced off the sweetness of the malt somewhat. Mouthfeel is thick, making this one a sipper. Overall, I would have been happier if the alcohol was more muted, but it still made for a nice drink."
"Decent beer."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. It may not seem like it with a description like ""fresh dirt," but it fits into the flavor profile nicely. Plus, it's my observation not yours. Give this one a shot, and it will not disappoint."
"Notes - A decent beer, but I do have one problem with it: it's entirely too strong for its depth of flavor. If I'm drinking a 9% beer, I want it to be complex; something to savor and sip slowly. The simple, sessionable flavors of this beer don't work with its high ABV. Bigger is not always better, guys."
"A winter offering from the great state of CA. The Hairy Eyeball Ale pours into the glass with a deep burgandy body and a nice medium-bodied light head. A slight alcoholic taste with a balance of piney hops finishes the palate. An interesting interpretation of a winter beer."
"Pours a clear dark ruby with a tan head. Nose is heavy with hops and a slight touch of alcohol...though not much. Flavor is heavily influenced by hops, but the alcohol seems to mute it a bit. And if my naiveté is skewing my judgment, the hops are definitely reigned in after being allowed to run out in the open for two seconds. In the overall sense, it is a good flavor pattern. Feel is a bit thin. Doesnt seem to be a lot of carbonation on it. Overall it is a good brew. For a limited release though, I cant say I consider it anything special. Just another hoppy release that is still good to try."
"12 oz. stubby bottle; 56.7 IBUs. It pours a mildly-hazed (unfiltered?) deep crimson, with medium carbonation and an inch of light yellow/brown head that leaves some moderate lacing. Smells of dark, alcohol-soaked fruits, vinous, caramel and molasses malts, red berries, nuts, and maybe some sweet cookie batter. It has a pungent flavor of vinous malts, pecans, dark fruits, grains, caramel/molasses, and citric/piney hops that deliver a fairly high bitterness. The body is medium, oily smooth and drying, with medium carbonation and a fairly long finish. Overall a nice, comparatively smooth strong ale that would pair excellently with a slice of pecan pie."
"This beer pours a reddish-brown color with a thin off-white head that burns out fairly fast. Thin spotty lacing. The aroma is on the sweet side with malt and plums, along with a touch of alcohol. Rich and smooth body with a nice toasted malt flavor, along with warming alcohol and dark fruit flavors. Some hops are in there but it could have used a bit more. The finish is sweet and toasty with a lingering malt aftertaste. Above average overall."
"Pours a dark mahongany color, nice carbonation, nice small fizzy creamy off-white head, some tiny islands left behind. The nose is malty, slighty hoppy, sweet, cherries, and caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, sweet, slightly bitter/sour, and a good dose of caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well in this brew. Medium body. Drinkable. this is another very tasty brew from Lagunitas. They keep pushing out some very nice brew's at a very reasonable price, way to go Lag. Recommended."
"I have yet to be let down by this brewer. Another fine offering by Lagunitas."
"Recommend this sweet and malty beer with pasta"
"Overall: This packs a punch for sure. Not the best I've had from Lagunitas, but not bad by a long shot, either."
"This is a nice Christmas-y barleywine-y thing. Even in August."
"I feel bad for not drinking these Lagunitas beers sooner (brown sugar, undercover, hairy eyeball). Some say that aging beer is a crap shoot. I am now hapy to know that i should just drink Lagunitas beers rather than saving them. Fresh Laugnitas beers are amazingly hopped, so i should just focus on the fresh ones."
"Pretty good. When I was drinking it, my guess (correct it turns out) was that it was a strong ale. Reminds me somewhat of Arrogant Bastard. Very complex."
"Well worth a try. I gonna let my other one sit for awhile and compare."
"12 oz stubbie. This one is a fantastically deep amber color with crystal brilliance. There is minimal head that stays around as a light patch hovering over the brew. I'm not seeing any bubbles working out of solution in this one. The aroms is full of incredibly deep caramel sweetness, with a strong pine resin hop and a potent alcohol spiceyness added in. Everything about the aroma is big. The flavor brings a strong bready character that moves to a caramel-soaked resinous pine hop. The hop moves from a peppery sensation after swallowing the brew to a fairly strong bitter bite on the sides of my tongue. The bready character of this one is really strong throughout the drink. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very mild carbonation. This one actually feels like it is pulling moisture out of my salivary glands by drying the lateral portion of hte back of my tongue and under my tongue. Interesting feeling. I find that I really have to slow down on this one from the strength of the bready flavor and the hop along with the drying feeling I am getting. It is nice, but this is one that needs time to dissect."
"Very little head with a clear brown color. Lots of different aromas: heaby malt, bread, taosted, burnt, dates, oak. Nice oak and a little smoky taste.I hint of pine and citrus, but not muuch. Didn't really taste of feel the alcohol. Decent level of carbonation. Will want to taste this again in a year or so."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep brown that shows some ruby highlights under light. Almost no head or lacing to speak of. The aroma consists of a lot of caramel, some sweet and roasted malts, and a touch of hops. Very sweet, rich aroma. As for the flavor, it has quite a bit of sweetness like the aroma suggests. You can taste very sweet caramel, fruits, and a bit of alcohol that is followed by a quick hoppy bite at the end. Very similar to a barley wine. The sweetness tends to overwhelm the other flavors towards the bottom of the glass. The mouthfeel is thick and oily with little to no carbonation. Definately a full-bodied beer. I enjoyed this beer, but wouldnt mind the sweetness being toned down a bit, or balanced out by a few more hops."
"D: Alot of different flavors come through in this brew. Overall balance loses out to the abundence of hops. Higher alcohol content is well hidden. Recommended."
"D: This beer smelled better than it tasted. Fairly unimpressed with this beer as Ive tasted many like it."
"Pours a clear dark brown/red, medium tan head forms, settles to a thin layer and ring, some lace spots, decent retention. Smell is sweet, very malty, toffee and grains, figs/raisin, citrus, some iron, not bad. Taste is nice and malty as well, toffee and raisins, iron, dark fruits, grains, nice balance, almost old ale like. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Some heat going down. Nice strong ale to drink, one of the better Lagunitas I've had. Thanks April!"
"A nice, well-balanced brew. I have had this in the past and it is even better than I remember it."
"D: This is a very interesting strong ale, different flavors and smells each sip - I would have loved to have a new one to compare the 2005 version too."
"This brew is a deep and shadowy brown, with just a slight crimson shade. It presents a thin but steady tan-colored head and a respectable trail of lace. The aroma is pleasant: a mix of malt, sugar, figs, and some ethanol. Beneath the first layers of smell, there's a little grapefruity hops. Not bad. The taste is sweet (a bit sticky), with a good dose of bitterness. You can easily taste the alcohol in this one, as well as some toasted malt. The malt flavor is a consistent theme through the brew, but it's not as complex as it could be. It's pretty full in body, and modestly carbonated. Worthy of a try, but there are a lot of strong ales out there that a"
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dates into a pint glass. Was bascially black unless held to a light then it was a dark mahogany. Had a decent head to settled to a constant collar with very good lacing. The smell for me was awful. It had a rotting plum smell with a medicinal alcohol smell in the background. The taste was just as bad. I can see where some may like this but this ended up a drain pour for me. Very bitter with a bad aftertaste. Don't recommend unless you are a big fan of the sytle. (2, NA, ML, N)"
"Overall, a nice beer to sip on. quite malty, i thought it would have had a bigger hop bite to it. I like it, and would love to have it again, but i dont see myself searching for it when i travel again."
"D- Very tasty. I wish I would of bought one in Cali."
"D: A very approachable good tasting American strong ale. I think it could actually stand to be a little stronger."
"This beer is still good but I don't recommend aging it for longer then 18 months after you buy it.Tasty thought."
"D- think hoppy scotch ale or a balanced scotch ale, complex and enjoyable, a more pronounced hop presence would be nice, good none the less"
"It's an American strong ale with roots in the English barleywine style. It's malt heavy, with a lighter hops compliment. The malt profile is rich and fruity, like apples and berries. The hops seem slightly fruity, not too harsh, but add a nice balance. This beer isn't amazing, but it's well-balanced and worth a try."
"The mouth is medium body, showing decent complexity, as the creamy and sweet elements, eventually dry out a bit on the finish. Very solid overall."
"got this at the Corkscrew in Urbana, IL. Poured much, much darker than i had expected. A dark red brown with red tinge to it. Nice head that settles well and leaves a nice lacing. Odor is hoppy, slightly fruity (raspberries?) Smells strong and flavorful. Taste has tons of hop bitterness but not a ton of hop flaovr. Some caramel mingling with dry malts. Bitterness dominates this brew and is maybe a bit overdone. heavy mouthfeel. This one is a bit of a one-trick pony. Ok if you like a hop bomb i guess, but its not all that interesting."
"It was served in a Snifter. This eyeball was a dark chestnut brown with tons of cranberry and ruby red highlights throughout the beer. It only had a small skim of white almost tan colored head of foam that fizzled away into a few white/tan foamy rings and a trace of spotty lace. The smell was very fruity at first. I'm not too sure what kind of fruits were in that jumble. After that there were some notes of raisins, brown sugar, very little toasted malts, and it ended with a pinch of sweet citrus hops. The taste was slightly sweet with a touch of toasted malts, raisins, brown sugar, grapefruit, and it decided to end this taste with a big bang of alcohol soaked dry citrus hops. If you decide to hold the beer in your mouth, the alcohol soaked dry citrus hops keep getting stronger and stronger until you're forced to drink it down. Are they sure that their Hairy Eyeball Ale clocks in at a 9% ABV? If it does, then it really masks it's alcohol content. You better keep your eyeball on this eyeball because if you don't, you'll look like the drunk Lagunitas dog. Here's looking at another one of these!"
"D: You can drink these until the 9% abv catches up to you."
"Damn good brew. I've had this twice recently. Once at the Atlantic Chip Shop and for this review, at the Gate in Park Slope, Brooklyn (both places are owned by the same people). On-tap. Dark brown almost black with a 1/2"" head. Since this is my second time having it, I know it will be good. Hoppy aroma. I love that smell. The flavor is sweet and hoppy. Both flavors work really well together. Great balance. Medium to heavy body. Zesty finish. Highly drinkable for such a strong beer."
"This reminds me of a barleywine that isn't overloaded with hops. It's very well balanced, but appears rather flat without any foam or lace."
"Hairy Eyeball pours a very dark red/amber hue with a beautiful khaki colored head. Lace sticks quite well to the glass and remains at the top throughout tasting. Smell is that of raisins and brown sugar with a hint of caramel. Taste is quite different, some cherries and fig perhaps? Quite balanced with a smooth maltiness that is followed by a mild hop bite. I don't sense much alcohol in the taste or the smell, but I guess everyone is different. Has a crisp zing to it that seems to come from the carbonation. More drinkable than I had anticipated, surely give this one a try if you have the opportunity. Solid work Lagunitas."
"A definite sipper, this falls somewhere between an old ale and a barleywine in terms of its warming satisfaction and ability to be enjoyed slowly and contemplatively. Can't wait to stock up on more Lagunitas stuff."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, but high abv limits sessionability."
"Pours a reddish-brown with a moderate amount of foam that sustains for a few minutes. Sweet praline nose, laced with molasses. Powdery caramel-toffee malt flavors coat the tongue. This is a touch thick up front, but drier in the long, bitter finish. I like how this beer is thick up front and dry and bitter in the finish. I just picked up a single bottle, but I'd try this again in a six-pack next time."
"Not something I could enjoy beyond a couple pints, but a great way to finish out the season and well received. As usual, a solid offering from the experimental folks at Lag."
"Tremendous beer, very drinkable."
"Big and deep malty profile. Sweet caramel malt flavors. Thick, creamy, and robust. Malt takes the lead, but it has a surprisingly nice balance. Spicy hops shock the taste buds with a bitterness that lasts into the finish, but hangs around as a supporting cast member. Little bubbly carbonation is spritzy on the tip of the tongue. An interesting offering from Lagunitas. Definitely enjoyable, but not one I'd go after every day. Abv is up there, but not very apparent in the tastes, so watch out!"
"D - Not bad to sip on but not as in your face as some American Strongs (IE Arrogant Bastard) and not as smooth as some others (IE Gordon or Hibernation Ale)."
"An interesting Strong Ale that's robust in flavor yet subtle in aroma. At 9% abv, the alcohol is evident but not overpowering. A decent, powerful ale, but probably not a brew that I'd seek out."
"Pours a very dark brown/mahogony with a large tan foamy head with some small lacing. The smell has roasted malt,alcohol,and dark fruit. It's not too strong,but not bad. The taste has alot of dark fruit,alcohol,roasted malt,coffee,and abit of a hop bite. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing pretty well. A good beer,it maybe could use some cellaring,but still not a bad brew."
"The Hairy Eyeball pours a deep red/brown with a sticky pale head. Smell is a deep fruity maltiness. Dark raisins, plums, and caramel with a twinge of hops. Taste is rich and malty, the same dark fruits I smell plus a nice light roasted flavor. Not overly sweet with the maltiness, just right in my opinion. There is a nice juicy hop bitterness and flavor as well, balencing the malts. A slight alcohol flavor warms as it goes down. I had this for the first time at the EBF and I will certainly be buying more in the near future."
"The beer pours a ruby red/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of crystal malts and a slight raisin aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth, burnt caramel flavor that goes down easy and finishes rich and warm. It has a roasted/raisiny finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good strong ale. It's full flavored and packs a punch."
"Cheers!"
"Lagunitas hairy eyeball. $3 with grad school id at Porters pub. They have the whole blondie album playing here. As a child who grew up with an older sister who played this so I'm happy. On to the review. Deep dark opague red/brown. Medium sized head. Nice lacing. Some malt in the smell. Slight citrus hops. Taste is sweet at first as the sugars hit you followed by a very dry finish from the grapefruitlike hops. A little on the sweetside but the hops do a decent job of balancing it. Mouthfeel is on the chewy side with a viscosity that coats the tongue in a nice way. I'm digging this beer drinkabilty is deceptive. I think I could probably pound this but the alcohol underlies each sip. Similar to the Brown Shugga, though not as sweet"
"Drinkability- Not the best. Almost to sweet to wholly enjoy. Has to strong of a alcohol undertone. I'd be curious to try it after maybe a year or so of aging."
"Overall a very interesting beer full of complexity. The woody, malty character keeps me coming back for more. A tasty treat that I will pick up again."
"Drinkability- Heavy body and high abv ideal for ideal for slower drinking; This is definitely a capable entry in the Strong Ale category, but I can't help but compare it to its cross-state colleague, Arrogant Bastard, which it falls somewhat short of in quality and flavor."
"Overall not great, I was expecting more as this replaced the very good brown shugga in the seasonal line up from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: warming alcohol and hearty flavors make this a slower sipping beer which is great on a cold winter evening. Very tasty and worth picking this one up."
"I highly recommend this one."
"A damn solid American Strong Ale."
"My only real complaint is the oily mouthfeel on the tongue, but the taste and drinkability more than compensate. Also, the taste seems to come together a lot as it warms, so give it time. Overall a pretty tasty brew. I'de really like to try it on tap."
"Conclusion: A good brew, I certainly wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me. Not amazing enough that I'll make it one of my regulars though. But I will remember it and may get it again."
"This is a wonderful winter brew. Very flavorful. A nice one to enjoy in the winter. Be careful though, the alcohol level is about 9%, though it seems a bit less."
"Truly an excellent beer. Very fitting for review #1100."
"The taste is nicely hopped with some accompanying bitterness and medium malted flavors. There is some nice fruitiness and ginger spice along with some slight alcohol flavorings. This is a good one that I would gladly drink again."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Poured into a nonic a deep ruby color with a dark brownish tint a quick to form one finger slight off white head atop,great balance and complexity in the nose deep brown sugar and alcohol dipped dark fruit intertwined with spicey/grassy hop really trying to hold up to the malt...advantage malt but a close call.Big and warming with great flavor and balance gummy,juicy malt with that brown sugar and raisin-like quality finishing resiny and piney inducing great hop burps.I love these kind of big American brews insanely balanced,big and bold with great complexity,Lagunitas rocks!"
"I like this one, without a doubt. Needs to be available all year round. Pours an opaque reddish color. Almost black at top fading to red. Nice looking. Doesn't smell like much, only drawback. Nice smooth, silky taste for a strong ale. High hops kick in at end but they simmer quickly, making it easy to drink. Dangerously drinkable, as I am drinking it as quickly as a California common! Highly complex brew with plummy taste and a great pleasure to drink."
"the hops offer more to the flavor than aroma. a sharp tingly bitterness punches fairly far forward and sits on the tongue. big IBUs. it seems dry, though not thin. in my eyes the malt element can't keep up with the hops. i can't tell if it's weak or the hops are just overdone. there are some nice flavors but i wish i could get some more of these"
"A peculiar aftertaste leaves the mouth dry. Not a bad beer, but i am not sure i would go out of my way for it."
"This is an odd brew, in some leftfield purgatory between porter and pale ale, with an overly large ABV to be sessionable."
"On tap at Boston's Bistro. Dark mahogany with ruby highlights. Thick tan head holds together very well. Nice patchwork of lace left on the side of the glass. Citrusy, toffee, and dark candy fruit in the aroma. A bit of floral hops as well. Rich toffee, sugary, a bit syrupy, along with fruity flavors. Nice amount of flavors here. Good amount of citrusy bitterness. Pretty well balanced. Finishes a bit dry. Not may favorite from Lagunitas, but good."
"Good winter warmer, don't be put off by the name."
"Drinkability was OK, but not great, with lots of acidity and sweetness to deal with. Then again, as potent as this brew is, that might not be a bad thing."
"Mouth is the only thing waining as it could be a little more round but besides that this tasty treat could satisfy my palate all night long."
"Medium bodied, but the flavor gives the feeling of a stronger ale. Coats the tongue in the afterglow. It's a decent, competent brew. The sweetness can be a bit overwhelming, but the bitterness and strength of the brew is a good balance. It is a one-n-done beer, though; can be just a bit much."
"Pours a dark ruby with a short head that dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves no lacing. The smell is slightly vegetal up front and with a sweet roll finish and a little dark spice. The taste is somewhat light and subtle. Somewhat surprising for the alcohol here and the profiles of some of their other beers. Soft notes of caramel, raisins, and other dark fruit. A slight tang of bready yeast on the finish. Light mouthfeel, and fairly low carbonation, but very smooth. Eh, not my favorite Lagunitas. Well made, but not all that interesting."
"Medium mouthfeel feels light with all the creamyness,lots of carbination. very enjoyable beer,easy drinking start to get a bit filling. Could drink all night if it wasn't so filling."
"I think Lagunitas is one of the most underrated, least appreciated craft breweries in the entire country. Their big beer is top-notch. Olde Gnarlywine, Brown Shugga', Cappuccino Stout and Imperial Red are all fantastic. Hairy Eyeball, as well, has both flavor and power to spare. In fact, it can stand nose to nose with some of the best American strong ales... and not blink."
"Another good looking arrival into Georgia from this successful brewer from California, I picked up my Hairy Eyeball in a six pack of 12 oz. bottles. As I poured the first of these into a pint glass, the beer looked rather unassuming. The body was clear, and mahogany brown; the head was small and short lived; and the lacing was sparse at best. The smell was much more enticing than the looks, as I detected honey, orange marmalade, and strawberries. There was also a noticeable spiciness from the hops as well a whiff of alcohol. The taste was even better than I had anticipated from the smell. I was expecting a sweet malt bomb; however this beer was actually quite well attenuated and balanced. There was sweetness there of course, showing up as apricots, toffee, and brown sugar, but the herbal bitter hops were quite bracing, and the overall the taste was more dry than sweet. The mouthfeel was a bit abrasive, but with some age, I think this would round out for the better. It was quite similar to the Brown Shugga, but not quite as hard hitting, which made it a much more approachable beer IMHO."
"D - Pretty good. I wouldn't mind having it again. There was something too ""rugged"" about it. The flavors were complex and there were a lot of them. Even though they meshed well, it seemed to lack some sort of ""flavor flow"" that other beers might have. I didn't mind it terribly much, but it did strike me as odd how the flavors seemed to stand indivually rather than blend."
"Poured a dark brown with a cream-colored head. Taste was very strange, alcohol, sugary, malty, weird. I do not know what to think of this beer. I think I liked the Brown Shugga much better. Oh well, I'll put some in the cellar and see how it does next year."
"Drink very easy for the abv, nice take on the style & worth a pint or two"
"A worthy brew. This one is a great after dinner beer by itself. Such a wide range of flavors that this should appeal to anyone. Great winter release to warm the body on a cold night."
"Nice brew. Not sure what I'd call this one, it isn't that strong in flavor, and the abv isn't all that high."
"Pours out a rosey purple brown body with a 1/4"" head that fizzles down to a thin layer of foam. Some head clings to the glass in scant patterns. First smell I get is a bit like rotting oranges. What follows is straight up sweet, darker malts, alcohol and a bit of citrus hops. When I taste this, i basically get a barrage of sweet malt body, piney hops, bitterness (quite bitter for a 50-something IBU beer), and a finish that is medicinal in the amount of alcohol. I can pick out some flavor as the aftertaste lingers, which is a blend of chewy dried fruit and pine resin. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit slick. Mild carbonation. Yeah, I don't really want to drink this all that much. I remember liking this a couple years back. Kind of nauseating now."
"The color was a nice dark brown with a little tan foam and very little lace. When pouring, you could see it poured thick. The smell of roasted malts was very pleasant, along with a sweet fruity aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, caramel and coffee with a hint of fruit. Not overpowering on the alcohol. This strong ale was very very pleasant. Couldn't believe that a american strong ale like this was so tasty with out the tartness or bit of alcohol. Yum, I need more!"
"This is an extremely complex beer. You have some malts that stand out, along with some hops, and then come along the fruit flavors. Watch out for the alcohol, it may catch you by surprise. Recommended."
"Always down for sampling a new Lagunitas beer...appears a dark ruby cola hue with a large tan head leves fine lacing all around my chalice very nice looking brewski. Aromatics come on strong with a great malty profile full of raisins and dark chocolate with some mild herbal pine hoppiness evident also noted was a minimal tart character that I was getting. Flavor is strong and assertive just like an American Strong Ale should be, some malty bready caramel malts with more fruit soaked ripe alcohol notes but finishes with a solid bittering pine hop flavor...definitely comes off much more hoppier in flavor than the smell was letting go, this is probably due to less finishing hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied somewhat mild syrupy texture even carbonation carries it well so that it doesn't stay coated on the palate. Drinkability from a fan of the brewery and uniqueness of all their beers, this one just adds to their likability solid American Strong Ale that I will definitely have again in the future."
"Served as the guest tap at the Blue Frog Brewery in Fairfield, CA. Deep, robust shade of dark copper, full of lively carbonation. Almost as dark as the stout I just had. Lots of big bubbles. Foamy head like the brush at the carwash, stained a light shade of brown from the beer. Big time carmel and chocolate malt body; no residual sweetness, just lots of malts that finish dry. Hops provide a good kick, but not the regular C-hops; I'm having trouble picking the varieties out but they're delicious, maybe one high-alpha and lots of aromatics in there. Deep and rich, and also very refreshing and satisfying. Alcohol is well hidden, but that big body is a clue. Great of draft so get it if you can find it. Cheers!"
"This one desires a place on the go-to list."
"you will not want to put it down! and if you think his thing tastes good from a bottle, imagine trying it on tap! somehow they squeezed an extra 0.20% of alcohol into this years model, too, and i wouldn't notice the alcohol at all. very nice very drinkable and very much worth purchasing!"
"Recommended, but you may discover why it's called ""The Hairy Eyeball"" if you have more than one..."
"M&D - smooth and bittersweet, easy down, a fine ale that wold be easy to have a few of, well done Lagunitas"
"Low carbonation, but nice and full for a 9%abv strong ale. This isn't a beer where the higher abv is hidden super well but certainly not overwhelming or too overdone. A nice strong ale from lagunitas."
"Wow! An interesting and tough to categorize brew, no wonder it was put in with the catch-all ""strong ale"" category. It's like the bastard child of an English Brown and a Triple Eisbock, married to a winter warmer and secretly sleeping with a barleywine. The closest thing I can compare this to is Hair Of The Dog's Adam, and it's not really that close. Only Lagunitas could come up with this."
"A true testament to Petaluma's best...once again a feat to be reckoned with!!!!"
"Bottle at cafe volo- Body is rouge in colour....thin head with an off white colour. Aroma is malty, nutty, bready. Lots of hops in the nose too. Taste is raisins, suragy prunes, hops bitterness. Alcohol not noticable....a very nice winter warmer! Even in the summer!"
"ABV is evident in this one. It's not too bad but it seems much more like a sipper than a session brew."
"Thanks for the EYEBALL Mr. LBB."
"Good stuff (although a bit pricey at $9 for the bottle... but what can you do)."
"Wish now I'd saved a couple of more of these for cellaring."
"Taste; as with the smell, those pine tree hops hit you at first. The malts have a nice solid presence with caramel, brown sugar and with some hints of toffee. This also has a nice, alcohol soaked, dark fruity presence underneath the hops and malts, with dates, figs and just some hints of cherries. Mouthfeel is thick and a bit syrupy, with low carbonation. Drinkability would have been even higher if not for the high abv."
"An easy drinking strong ale, despite higher hops bitterness, it still pans out well."
"Pours a deep amber brown with two fingers of beige head that takes its time to subside. Pretty nice lacing on the glass. Nose is full of dark malt, figs, raisins, a hint of molasses, and a slight tinge of alcohol--smells decadent. Taste starts off with a sweet molasses malt, followed rum-soaked fruitiness, raisin and cherry really coming through, with a nice piney and bitter hop balance towards the end. Very nice tasting, complex enough to be interesting, nicely balanced. Medium bodied and fairly creamy, this isn't as full as expected. This is a pretty easy drinking strong ale, I could drink two or three if getting drunk isn't an issue."
"Pours dark with light amber tint with a bit of a tan head that goes away pretty quick. Aroma is malty with dark fruit, raisin, prune, and rich molasses syrup. Full mouthfeel with smooth aftertaste, a bit salty. Taste is buiscut with some dark roasted malt, earthy piney hops oak, and prunes. There is some serious depth to this beer, reminds me of some dipa's and also some imp stouts. Very complicated. Definately a sipper beer with some alchohol warmth. This is one of those beers that does not fit into a nice neat catagory but is very enjoyable anyway."
"Good stuff."
"The label says ""Beer Speaks. People Mumble."" and this beer certainly speaks to me. Truly a unique, complex and wonderful beer well worth seeking out!"
"This is a very tasty beverage, full of flavor. Richly malty, nice ABV, with just enough hops to balance it nicely. Lagunitas is a good brewery, with a great imagination. Keep it coming, guys!"
"Medium to full bodied, smooth and very well balanced. Strong on both malt flavors and hop presence, but nothing overwhelms. Warming effect very evident. Probably a beer I could have one or two of in a sitting."
"Deep brown with reddish hues, slim tan foam that leaves a nice swirly top throughout the experience. Good lacing to boot. Aroma of slight alcohol eminates, with notes of raisin, caramel and and a firm hop smell. Taste is strong, high on the hops and malt, with a chocolatey flavor that is very sweet, blending into a bitter finish. The alcohol is quite noticible in the finish also. Semi-thick feel on the palate, coats well, with good carbonation. The flavors are nice, but perhaps too intense for some, as with the alcohol. This lowers the drinkablilty, but overall a nice one to try. Being a strong ale it doesn't really have an identity, just expect massive flavor from this brew..."
"Very drinkable sipping beer. Really close to American Barley Wine in style."
"I had one, and had I not had my son in tow, I likely would have had another. It was that much fun to sip and savor. It's big, no question, but it flows willingly over the palate, behaving entirely too drinkable for a beer with such a hefty ABV. This one could gt you in trouble, but common sense would likely prevail, at least for most of us. It's the rare Hairy Eyeball that delivers comfort instead of unrest."
"12 ounce bottle. Bronze with golden highlights and a yellowed parchment colored head. Brown sugar encrusted hazelnuts soaking in armangac aroma. Nutty sweet start, cherries floating in bourbon middle, alcoholic flame-out finish, bitter mineral aftertaste. Burps reveal a bit of hop character. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. An impressive creation, but this one just shows too much booze. Maybe I'm getting jaded, but it seems like these gargantuan high abv malt bombs are getting pretty hard to tell apart. I really wanted to like this one more, but... Strong ale, for sure. Stand out ale? Not so sure."
"To me, Lagunitas has a definite knack for crafting some beers that can really only be enjoyed not as everyday drinkers, but tasty occasional treats. Hairy Eyeball is one of those, I think. I wonder what effect a little time in a cool, dark place would have..."
"Very drinkable, almost scarily so. The bartender hesitated in giving one of these to my friend because he thought he just picked it for it's novel name. He told us it's dark, and that there's alot going on in it. But I disagree, I think all the ingrediants gel together to make one very smooth strong ale, that is heavy on the malt, with a subtle hop character."
"Being a stong ale drinker I find this to be a much too drinkable beer. This beer suits it's style to a ""T", I don't think it gets much better than this...honestly. Drink with care, and ENJOY!"
"A decent brew- I'm not in love with it, but I would enjoy it on occasion."
"I've always enjoyed the names of the lagunitas beers. Labels always catch my eye in the beer store as well. Best of all I've had good success in the taste department which in the end is what matters most."
"I highly recomend this beer, I;m sure it would be good in a different way with some cellaring, but I don't think I need to wait because it's so good already."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle a pretty garnet color topped by a good inch of creamy tan head. Pleasant aroma is a blend of sweet caramel malt, fruity hops, and a molasses or bourbon-ish sweetness. Palate is sweet caramel and toffee up front, blending with a light hoppiness that contains notes of plums and dates. A light astringency emerges on the finish. Rich, creamy body both carries the flavor and disguises the alcohol a little bit. Very easy drinking considering its strength. Truly an enjoyable winter ale."
"The aroma is sweet, brown sugar and molasses, but not strong. However this ale is clearly hopped. The flavor is predominantly dry/bitter; some bitter chocolate flavors underlined by caramel and fruit sweetness. The body is way to thin for a beer of this potency, though the alcohol is not overwhelming. In fact, the light body makes it a bit too drinkable and could potentially get you in trouble (for example if you did not know the abv, which innocently is now marked at 9% abv, not the 8.8% listed)."
"Clear amber/chestnut colour with a dark cream head. Good lacing composed of fine bubbles. Big toffee, caramel malt and citrus hop character in the aroma and flavour. Some gingerbread in the flavour. Moderate lingering bitterness and some orange hop flavour. Excellent carbonation, on the low side and well-integrated. Dry finish. Plenty of malt with a good hop/malt balance."
"Afterthoughts - The name be a bit offputting to some, but it screams try me and its a worthy contender to be a regular in my mixed 6 packs for its seasonal duration."
"Amber color with some copper hues, nice off white head, with some lacing. Malt, with raison, some fruitiness, bready aroma. Malt some what prodominat in the flavor with back character of fig, raison, caramel. Nice carbonation leading to medium-full bodied. Some hop bite in the back of the throat becomes apparent after a while. Overall a nicely done drinkable beer."
"12oz bottle bought in December 04. The label on this one lists the ABV at 9%. Poured into my Nonic a deep, cloudy, ruby red with about one finger of head. Carbonation is almost zero, but the lacing on this is incredible. Smell is currants, plums, dark cherry and a hint of alcohol. Similiar to Double Bastard but less alcoholic. Taste is smoooth, a huge punch of sweet malt that is punched in the head by the 56.7 IBU's. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste and only manifests itself through the pleasing warming after it goes down. This beer is dangerously drinkable even at 9%. This has become my favorite offering from from Lagunitas. Here's Lookin' Atcha'!"
"No freshness date. Not much head, but there and dark brown and clear beer. Nose is lots of cramel and good hopnose( european) with roast. Next to that malty, peppery and dry. Taste is not as it is quiet sweet, carramellic and liqorice. Hops defenitly not forgotten but also good maltiness all together full malty and fine. Not that much carbonation but think stylelike so overal good mouthfeel too. Well balanced brew that i enjoyed and like to meet again someday."
"dark reddish amber and light bubbly foam, lots of carbonation rising through the top and disrupting the beer's white cap. smells of rich malts and sugary toasted hops. some brown sugar and light cherry. very bitter and strong, but finishes cleaner than expected with chocolate remnants on the tongue. body texture overall is a bit too light for the punch the flavor packs. increases drinkability, but lowers mouthfeel points for sure. abv is masked by the somewhat flavor-inhibiting hop bitterness which is probably a plus.. methinks this to be a mass-produced unfocused strong beer.. like a steel reserve for the beer advocate set."
"The color is dark maroon with a ruby glow when viewed against a light source. The head is good-sized, somewhat creamy, and light brown. Aroma is of citrusy west coast hops with an underlying rich maltiness. The aroma is just a little subdued compared to what I expected. A sip starts with a tasty citrusy hop flavor with a nice bitterness. Then the rich malts kick in and give the beer a much more complex taste. There is a nice richness here, yet it never seems like it would stop you from drinking more than one bomber. This is definently a ""bigger"" beer that is deceptive in it's ease of drinkability. Totally recommended."
"Volo had 7.3% a.b.v. on their menu, but there was more of a 9% presence here. Brownish with a mocha head, significant head and lace, overflowing bottle a bit like Belgians do once the bottle was opened. Horrible aroma, fishy and like someone sweaty had drunk from this glass just prior. Not like to think about that. Pefectly served at Volo at just under room temperature and enjoyed on their deck. Smooth, creamy, refreshing, full mouthfeel. Hops came at you more and more, but carbonation was not overbearing rather drying. Spicy hop aftertaste.Had two years later, aroma quite passable and so an upgrade."
"d - This is a great beer made dangerous by its lightness and freshness. The best Ive had from this brewery."
"Overall Impression: Hardcore stuff. Makes for a good sipper. Its like Lagunitas answer to Arrogant Bastard, and not a bad one. I can see buying more."
"From the bottle, poured deep red with off white head. aroma, dark fruits, malts, hops, sour raspberries, plums, alcohol, chocolate, raisins. flavor sweet choclate, malts, plums, raisins, when it warmed up the alcohol came out, a nice bitter finish. enjoyed this"
"Quite enjoyable, I had not even heard of lagunitas until tonight, and now I'm glad to be introduced to such a good brewing company."
"Drinkability/notes: A very pleasant and understated strong ale, not really suitable as a session beer due to the high alcohol content, but a very pleasant beer to share with friends. In this area (Central Texas), Lagunitas bombers, including this one, sell for $2.99 - $3.49. In my opinion, this is a very good value for the price paid."
"Finger thick foam at start settles to a lightening film with some very nice lacing. Real mahogany brown hue, on the darker side, and quiet before the storm still ness to the whole affair. Real fungal hop presence on nose, with some fruity notes as well but on the whole the bouquet is quite sedate, which is surprising given the style. Real caramel shot up the nose on mouth, with a mix of crushed and smoke roasted walnuts, finishing with a hop vine of bitterness. As the pour warms, some slightly buttery aspects come to the fore. Like it a lot."
"Hello, what have we here? I said to myself as I poured out a deep auburn brew. I thin tan head caught my eye and said...""I am going to be a tasty beer"" The smell was smooth and sweet, just like many other things that I love. The smoothness carried over fromt the smell to the taste, under the guidance of a sweet, somewhat carmel taste. It was strong and and bold and overall a nice beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is another excellent beer from Lauginats. It's the second of theirs I've had (bother Barleywines), and while the Gnarlywine was a little better, this is still a kick ass brew. Full of flavor and complexity, yet incredibly smooth and well balanced. Thanks to my buddy GClakrage for yet another wonderful beer. This one is a keeper for sure."
"Pours a dark reddish brown, cloudy copper. Small brown head that recedes quickly but not completely, leaving an attractive skin of foam over the top, quick, lively carbonation. Strong smells of ripe cherries and molasses. Tastes of very sweet and chewy malts, a bit too sweet for my taste, and yummy nuts. Lovely mouthfeel of medium-heavy satin. Long sticky finish and hops that finally come out and express themselves as pine and black tea. Hints of milk chocolate emerge in the finish after it warms. The high alcohol in this brew is well hidden in the nose and mouth but definitely warms the gut. I'm rating the last bottle of a six pack; it took me the first five for this beer to grow on me because the sweetness was just too much, but now I find this beer pretty pleasant."
"A really nice barelywine. Creamy, richly rewarding, just like a barleywine ought to be...big thumbs up from me."
"Thanks, Rob!"
"Beer is good. Happy heavy beering."
"This bad boy just gets better as it warms...damn!"
"Crystal clear deep ruby hue. Two fingered, dense and steadfast cream white head. Thick, coating lace remains. Lightly buttery sugar cookie and raspberry hints upfront in aroma are accompanied by mellow notes of sugared biscuit and dark toffee. Restrained and well rounded aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a toothsome combination of strawberry tart and dark lovibond caramel. Bold, yet winsome hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness aptly. Mid palate nutty brittle and biscuit malt flavors surface agreeably, adding malt depth and extension to the dryness facilitated by the hop bitters. Understated woody and lightly floral hop flavor persists throughout. Nearly full bodied, but at a low enough viscosity to permit effortless sipping. As the beer warms, hints of red apple esters complement malt derived sweetness. Finishes with a surge of cuspate hop bitterness and trace vanilla notions fleeting quickly. A rather delicious brew that sits dangerously softly on the palate. Although Hairy Eyeball lacks the complexities of a top notch barleywine or strong ale, its cleanly crafted nature will most likely make it a staple of mine while it lasts. Tasty, indeed."
"On tap at the venerable Collins bar in midtown NYC. This sipper poured dark amber, with shimmering highlights. It boosted a tan head and left fine, well developed lacing. This is a hoppy/malty bulldog of a beer. tasty and well balanced. Solid malt package in counterpoint to a respectable hop wollop. Full bodied, Obviously well crafted. Well worth a try."
"Most of the flavors here are pretty good. Molasses and alcohol both come through pretty strong. The mouthfeel is a little thin and sharp, and the drinkability takes a bit of a hit from the readily apparent alcohol."
"First sip reveals an average body with light gentle rolling carbonation. Flavor is similar to nose some sweet caramel and toffee with grassy hops and a bit of peppery alcohol on the finish. Overall nice and well balanced."
"Overall, a good malty brew! Kind of like a Scottish ale."
"Drinkability: I'm all set with one. It's actually a nice beer with lots of complexity, but I just can't bring myself to the point of saying I really enjoyed it."
"Deep amber in color, with just the thinnist wisps of tannish head. Very lightly carbonated. The beer gives off a toasty malt aroma with cherry-like fruity undertones. More toasty malts in the flavor, which develop hints of brown sugar and spice-cake flavors. Some fruitiness follows, sort of a cross between rum soaked raisins and maraschino cherry, but always with a spicy, alcoholic edge. Toastiness returns and combines with a reasonably substantial hop bitterness for a lingering, slightly prickly aftertaste. A bit heavy -- I can't see myself having more than one of these in a row -- but not bad."
"Not that great. And I usually hope for more taste and complexity in a barleywine."
"Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, actually quite light considering the strength. Full, but not heavy, in otherwords."
"Top notch stuff here people. When I poured this beer it was a very dark amber red with a great head that left large ammounts of lacing around the glass. The smell was unique with a mix of carmel malts, various spices and a touch of cedar. This beers flavor was unique as well with a good dose of carmel malt sweetness which opens up into a nice subtle hop bitterness and spice flavors. The mouthfeel is nice and airy and complements the beer very nicely. This is another good beer from lagunitas."
"I tasted this beer because I like a lot of Lagunitas beers, but moreso because of the ingenious name. It pours a dark red with very little head development. Swirling the glass brings more of the foam out, but it dissipates quikly. The aroma is full of caramel flavors along with a non-descript hop scent and a bit of a cinnamon roll scent. The flavor is very malty with a light hop bitterness at the end. It feels and tastes a bit sandy on the palate with nores of cotton candy and sweet fruits and banana. Overall it's a decent barley wine but it really didn't spark any great desire to have it again. Being an English Barley Wine it is not surprising that the hops are a bit more mellow than an American Barley Wine."
"Overall: Heres Lookin Atcha! Beer Speaks. People Mumble."
"Drinkability- Quite and interesting beer with lots of good qualities. The alcohol is very pronounced though. I only had one this trip, but should have had another because it really was a good and interesting beer."
"This brew already tastes like a well aged barley wine. Excellent."
"Pours a deep ruby color topped by a creamy tan head. In the aroma I get notes of crystal malt, and a hint of citrusy hops at the end. Aroma has notes of toasted/ biscuit malt as well. Wow, a smooth creamy body greets my tongue as I take the firs sip of this beer. It is lightly sweet up front and finishes with a fruitiness that reminds me of raisins. There is a slight bit of bitterness in the finish, just enough to provide a foil to the maltiness that is the center-point of this beer. This beer is a very nice, well balanced beer. It is so smooth and well integrated. If you like malt accented strong ales witha bit of balancing hops, then this beer is for you"
"22 ounce bottle. Very nice to drink and pleasant flavors reside. Not very complex, but that does not detract from a very nice beer."
"Very drinkable brew, only negative to it might be its strength of flavor and alcohol. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"22oz Bomber, No Date Poured a deep amber with a thick head. Raisins in the aroma along with yeast, doughy malt and caramel. Full body that is smooth and soft. This one's got alot of malt in the flavor. The hops are bittering it quite a bit but not pronounced in flavor. Not a bad thing though, flavor is solid. Malty and a slight fruitiness with lots of hop bittering. Lagunitas is a major league player. One of the best out west in my opinion."
"Noisy, dark yellowish tan, crusty head. Dark, dark red-brown beer. Deep fruity, hoppy, tangy, caramel/toffee nose. Huge hoppy, alcoholic, buttery, grainsy front. Chewy, chewy, malty middle. Some chocolate, not too sweet. Roasty, grainsy, bitter finish. Alcohol warming. Man, I like this beer a lot. It's a nice, big malt (but not too sweet), big hop badboy."
"Notes: So far this is by far my favorite brew from Lagunitas. It's smooth rich complex character is like a meal in a bottle. I will definitely have this brew again."
"22 oz bomber bottle. A lovely rusty mahogony colour with a nice white/off white head of thick white foam. The aromas are a bit subdued, but very malty in nature. The hops are in there as well, but they are in the background a bit. This smells sweet and boozy, with some lovely roasted malt notes as well. Nice. The taste is very full. Malty and sweet up front with a distinct roastiness as well. The mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy/chewy and the drinkability is damn excellent. Man, is this a good brewery or what?"
"Drinker beware! I don't know what it is about this ale but it made me a bit light headed. It was the only drink I had tonight but the alcohol snuck up on me quite unexpectedly. Cheers!"
"ng"
"Medium to full bodied with a nice thick, rich and creamy mouthfeel. Great carbonation to lighten it up a little. The great balance and hiding of alcohol make this exceptionally drinkable. This goes down scary easy for an 8.8% brew."
"Half a pint down and I'm already feeling it."
"Hairy Eyeball makes for a spirited and well-composed winter seasonal. Worth seeking."
"Update  I originally rated this with an 03 vintage so thought it would be interesting to review it again with an 04 (drank in Jan 05). This really is an easy-drinker, and the big sugary malts make it dead-on for the style. Well done, Lagunitas!"
"Bottle says Perihelial release. 8.8% by volume. Appears to be a New Years relase judging from a story on the side label."
"Nice drinkable ale on a cold winters evening."
"Bottle cellared one year... A dark mahogany body reveals orange and ruby highlights when held to the light; and it's creamy light tan head slowly erodes to a wide collar without leaving behind much more than spotty lace. The nose is rich with caramel, molasses, piney hops, light spice and wood. It's quite refreshing, and reminiscent of a crisp fall evening under the stars. It's medium-bordering-on-full bodied and just slightly zesty in the mouth before warming to become creamy and smooth as its very fine carbonation ""pillows up"". Caramelized brown sugar and light spice dominate the rich, malty flavor before a splash of alcohol becomes apparent. Some softer notes of caramel and nuttiness follow in the finish. Resinous, piney hop flavors are present the whole way through, but shine in the aftertaste. Exceptionally well-balanced and highly drinkable despite its strength. A most wonderful holiday meal beer or nightcap!"
"Dark amber color, medium head. Full bodied ""Christmas"" Ale. Deeply roasted malts, chocolaty. Fairly hoppy. Good balance. Full flavor, somewhat spicy. No alcohol bite despite a 8.8%. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is chocolaty and slightly bitter. Interesting beer."
"The flavor is very much as the nose foreshadows. A vinous, non-descript sweetness vaguely resembling some non-existent brown fruit dominates the beer. This flavor, which reminds me of the aftertaste left in my mouth when I eat too many raisins, thins into a sour stickiness in the back of my mouth. Several consecutive sips leaves me with the sensation that Ive just finished a flat, alcoholic Dr. Pepper. Its odd, because I really WANT to like this beer, but like Brown Shugga, it just falls short. I tasted it twice because I was so dissapointed with the first one, I wanted to be sure before reviewing it. Its un-complex, non-malty and kinda sour. It tastes like a beefed up New Belgium 1554 or a high gravity Kostritzer. Theres no roastiness and no toastiness from the obvious use of darker malts. The 56 IBUs lend neither any hop flavor or aroma, and dont even really do a very good job of off-setting the sweetness of the non-fermented fermentables. This is a very average strong beer, since its very hard to achieve this little flavor with this many raw ingredients"
"Pours a very dark copper color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a heavy and sticky lace. Nose is sweet caramel and molasses with some milder notes of pine and fresh citrus. Medium to heavy in body with many layers of flavor. Taste is sweet roasted malts at first quickly followed by other sweet notes of gingerbread cookies, dark caramel, spice, and a touch of fruit. More bitter flavors of pine resins and grapefruit rind then begin to take over setting up a bitter finish of raw hop leaf and a hint of citrus. The hop oils create a slick feel in the mouth throughout, and the alcohol begins to become more apparent as the beer warms. A great beer with a great name!"
"Thanks again to xlperro for ""Beering It Forward""!"
"The beer pours an intense ruby red with the head pretentious in its size, the texture frothy, and the lace a thick sheet to occult the glass. The bouquet of toasted grain, sweet caramel, light brandy tone also present, seems more like a ""Barley Wine"" than an ""American Strong Ale"". Front is malt, somewhat sweet; the top is medium in feel, mildly acidic with the hops perky in their spicy bite, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting a real ""Belly Warmer""."
"Well,with a name like 'Hairy Eyeball' and from a brewer like Lagunitas I knew I would be in for a wondeful treat. Nice, dark amber color but not much head from the pour though . I loved the well balanced flavor. Not overly hopped for those who are scared of such things I'll take this one anytime."
"I would have put in the American Barley Wine category but it prob fits both styles fairly close."
"I've got to give this one style points just for the name . . .  Seriously, though, I agree with the first reviewer that this beer is reminiscent of Stone Brewing's Arrogant Bastard.  It looks similar, and the same smells and flavors are there, but they're just a little more subtle (perhaps except for the hops).  Pretty reddish-amber color, good tan head that retains well.  Maybe a little less balanced than AB, more towards the citrusy hop side than the malt side.  A very good beer with a great name (for what that's worth)."
"Copper and red hues.  Fabulous aromas of prunes, brown sugar, and rich malts.  Complex and 'juicey' mouthfeel.  Full bodied, slight abrasive hop coarseness.  A one of a kind.  Delicious, delightful, a delicacy in beerdom."
