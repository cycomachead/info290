"O: At first I wasn't too thrilled with this one, but as it warms up it changes quite a bit.  Definitely a treat for hop heads."
""
""
""
"Poured into a mug. Thick head, doesn't have a strong hoppy smell but sure tastes like a double IPA, with lingering taste of hops. High ABV makes it absolutely delicious!"
""
"Cheers!"

"Really great ale. Maine Beer company has hit a home run with Lil One"
""
"Reminds me of Stone's Arrogant Bastard, except it's 6 ounces less beer for a couple of dollars more. Good but there's probably a cheaper alternative."
""
""
"My only complaint is that the alcohol is a bit over the top for my tastes, though for sure that's what they were going for -- a warming winter ale."
""
""
"My second favorite now from MBC. Right behind MO."

"Like a hoppier but ultimately less satisfying version of Bigfoot. Solid, but lots of booze without the body needed to back it up. Maybe this needs some age. A hot, hoppy shredder. (3.5)"
""
"Nose of citrus, pine, malt, slight resin. Taste sweet chewy malt, pine, citrus, tropical fruits, resins, dry bitter finish."
""
"Caramel colored and opaque with a low, frothy head that settles out quickly.  Big bright aroma of citrusy hops, is that a ton of cascade?  Huge hops flavor with subtle malt riding beneath.  Alcohol flavors emerge, adding some warmth, but the hops mask it somewhat.  Rubbing alcohol lingers.  Could use more depth of flavor for my tastes, as hops and alcohol dominate, but the hops are fresh and delicious, so I'll enjoy the rest of this one."

"Definitely pick up a bottle if you have the chance. I hope to see this come around more often."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beers looks, smells, and tastes fantastic. It's definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"Pretty good but not world class like MBC`s other offerings such as Lunch, Another One, etc."

"Bottle as a trade extra dated 010215. Pours hazy deep dark orange amber with a huge off white and yellowish creamy fluffy head. Nice aroma with the characteristic Maine yeast, floral hops, light citrus sweetness, some bready malt. For the ABV, the aroma comes off very delicate. Nice. Flavor is nicely bitter citrus rind, floral flavors, lemon peel, some pine, sweet malty bready backbone. Medium bodied, medium carbonation with just a touch of prickle, dry bitter, dank. Basically a DIPA here bordering on very light barleywine, but comes off relatively light on the palate. This is really nice."
""
"Maine Beer Co just keeps pumping out extremely good beers.  Wow, this one is an excellent ale.  Nice rust color on the pour.  Very good, big flavors with hints of hops, but malt heavy in all the right places.  MBC - cannot go wrong."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a bit cloudy. Dark Amber color. Huge head. Thick, squishy and frothy. Lots of frothy lacing. Aroma is full of candied citrus hops some pine and sweet apricot hops. Also quite malty and balanced with caramel, fruit cake. The first sip really brings a potent hop delivery. Spicy, herbal hops. Pine, dried grass, grapefruit, candied oranges. Hefty maltiness but it finishes rather dry. Caramel, sweet dough and crusts. Quite bitter. Noticeable alcohol. Pretty aggressive. Interestingly enough, it becomes softer as it warms. Full bodied. A tongue dryer. Not my favorite Maine brew; still pretty tasty. Definitely a nice, hoppy offering that pairs excellently with the bitter cold weather outside."

""
""
"overall-not quite in the same league as the famous Maine brews Lunch and Dinner, but a solid offering, due to the high price i'm not sure if i'd buy it again but i'm glad i tried it."
"Disappointing brew from a usually world class Maine Beer Co."

"Dated Jan so this might not be quite the hop monster it once was. Pours a slightly murky golden amber color with a frothy off white head that persists forever sticking lots of lace on the sides. Aromas of earth pine brown sugar and caramel. The flavor is bit sweet with hints of caramel and raw brown sugar with a solid hit of earthy pine and resin. Toffee and light fruit with a bit of alcohol flavor round us out. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sticky creamy resinous mouthfeel. I drank this at the wrong time I think. Either super fresh when the hops still popped or with more age to bring forward more fruit and subdued hops. I'm interested enough in seeing how this develops that I may pick up a bottle on my way out of town to cellar for a bit."

"O: Was this beer aged on wood? Because it seems like it was. A rather hoppy Strong Ale, one with the alcohol front and center."

"Lil One is worthy of a World Class rating, but has been knocked down a peg by loyalists of Lunch that unfairly compare the two despite the distinctly different styles of a Strong Ale and an IPA. MBC stretches the boundaries of a typical Strong Ale by over-hopping, then dry hopping and bottle conditioning: the result is an arse kicking brew that rocks your palate and tickles your hop bone!"
""

""

"Overall: Excellent beer!"

"Surprisingly less intense then it's nose in a good way. Very heavy bodied.piney and herbal throughout with a spicy hop bite on the back end. Clean hop finish with a touch of alcohol heat. Subtle notes of citrus and caramelized dried fruits.faint sweetness with moderate bitterness to cut it.a little moodiness and a big body reminds you this is a big beer which is nice. Bold and mild and nicely balanced but like most strong ales/barleywines lacks any form of drinkability. A nice clean supper. Like other Maine beers nicely balanced, well blended, clean, subtle yet bold and pricey."
"Lightly weathered copper orange in color with a heavy haze. Poured with a thick, dense beige foam that reduced to a thick cap that left, thick, sticky lacings on the glass. Sharp citrus grapefruit aromas followed by pine hops and sticky sweet caramel malt. Ripe pineapple and boozy aromas begin to surface as this warms along with intensifying maltiness. Full bodied with a thick oily feel and very soft, light carbonation. The hop flavors are in reverse of the aroma. Big pine hop bite with biting tropical citrus flavors beneath and a sturdy, sweet caramel malt backbone. Finished with a light pine hop bitterness. An excellent hop forward strong ale."

"Overall - This is terrific, another stellar MBC brew."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost completely opaque dark amber with a medium off-white head. Aroma is tropical fruit, pine, with a caramel background. Taste is medium-heavy bitter, medium sweet, some alcohol as well. Finish is bitter and alcoholic. Full bodied, syrupy texture. Not bad at all."
""
""
"O-This was the second beer I've had from MBC and was recommended to try if I like SN Celebration. It rocked, great hops with some malt. Glad I got the last one"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew seems to be ambiguous when it comes to style. This beer is a delight, screw categories! If I had to ""classify"" this brew, the American Style Strong Ale fits the bill. This IMO doesn't need a category to enjoy it. Maine Beer Company is doing great things. The aroma alone on this is worthy of World Class status. It has everything you look for when a beer is hella dry-hopped. I hope that this beer isn't on brewed once status. This brew is Recommended."

"Another win from Maine Beer Company."
""
"O - Not sure about how this is fresh, but after a year of aging this takes on a barleywine character which works pretty well. Quite well balanced and very drinkable...almost scary drinkable. Reminds me a bit of Southern Tier's Backburner. Quite good."
"O.One of my favorites from Maine Beer company I will definitely have again. They brew some really good brew"
""
"O: a fantastic double IPA - nothing ground-breaking, but easily peer with beers of this sort; relatively balanced between thick malt and bitter pine hop - not a beer you're gonna confuse with an IPA or a barleywine - nothing borderline about it. Gotta pick one up if you spot it (assuming you like DIPAs, that is)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty solid and hoppy strong ale. It almost comes across as a reverse DIPA: a ton of hops present primarily to keep it from becoming a malt bomb. There’s tons of flavor to go around, and it’s definitely tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A hoppy yet balanced brew for sure. Very similar to a hoppy amber like Zoe, but still different enough. Definitely a heavier malt presence for sure. The style reminds me of Arrogant Bastard, though it is quite a different hop and malt profile. Really tasty and easy drinking brew. Very nice."
""
""
""
"O: This is quite a hefty beer. The flavor profile reminds me very much of Celebration, but with the gravity amped up."
""
""
""
""
"The ABV is high-- to tank this one when you're feeling good-- it's enough to make you sing YEAH and open another!"
""
""
""
""
""
"look out for this one - quite a nice winter beer...."
"O: The flavor profile of this beer reminded me a lot of FireStone Walker Double Jack. I would say that Double Jack is a lot smoother and would be my preference of these two beers. Still, this is a beer worth trying and another great product by the Maine Beer Company."

"This is a good offering from Maine Beer. In retrospect, I probably should have drank it sooner. But the hops mostly held up, and they are good. I would say that the malts are a bit too earthy and cooked, but I suppose that is to fit the style. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great creamy hoppy beer. Their signature style turned up a notch. Very lacy. DIPA strength, drunk exactly 90 days after bottling, bottle from Capone's. Big IBU without major palate erasing. Good drinkability. Fuller mouthfeel. CItrus orange aroma and flavour."
""
"O-an interesting beer, not sure what to make of this, but pleasant enough to sip and enjoy"

"A fairly strong and good looking brew."
""
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. Drinks nicely considering the ABV, meshing nicely with the hop-forward profile. Another solid beer (albeit a bit ugly looking) from MBC, but not one of their top creations."
"Comes across like a borderline Double IPA. Bitter from the ample, peppery hop. Solid pale malt base, but the tale is of the hop. The alcohol is present but well blended. The aftertaste does not linger as long as the bitterness would suggest. Smooth body."
"O: aweso beer great flavor no alcohol very fangerous at 9.1 %"
"Overall - Disappointing Maine beer. I'm just not getting it."
"If you are a hop-head, then this is a dream. It doesn't really fit the style, but it is a very tasty beer none-the-less."
""
"O: A DIPA in sheep's clothing, Maine Beer's Lil One is a 9.1% ABV hop bomb with a little more malt complexity than your average ""shock and awe"" big, bitter IPA. The American Strong Ale catch-all category allows this beer to be as big, fresh and hoppy as it wants to be while offering a bit more fruity complexity, even though its nuances are crushed by bitter hops. A pretty good example of the style and certainly a beer for hopheads to try."
""
""
"O: A decent beer but the flavors don't really meld that well. Definitely clean, but too earthy for me."
""
""
""
""
"A resiny hop bomb from ME Beer, go figure. While this is indubitably a good beer I don't know that it stands out from any of the other ME Beer hop bombs. Probably my least favorite of that trio (Zoe, Peeper and Lunch. I guess you could count Mo too) due to the thick dessert like malt character but that's just my preference."
""
"That being said somebody get me another one!"
"Overall: This is a delicious brew. I'm not going to try to categorize this because it covers a multitude of styles. It could be a DIPA, an imperial red or a strong (as the description up top says.) Regardless, it's a bit hop forward, but as I keep drinking the malts seem to come through. The more I drink this, the more it shines. Good stuff Maine Beer Co. The consistency of this brewing company is awesome. I have yet to have a beer worthy of a total score under 4."
""
""
""
"O: Another winner from Maine Brewing. We just got them in the DC area, and they've yet to disappoint."
""
""
""
"Taste reminds me more of an East coast malt heavy DIPA, sort of like Stone Coast's Triple IPA was like, grapefruit citrus hops upfront with a interesting bitterness in the aftertaste, likely from some spicy rye character, caramel malt quickly comes in to smooth things over so not to be too one-sided, very thick and full bodied with a proper carbonation level that provides a nice creaminess, alcohol is pretty well hidden but this is still a sipper because of the heaviness of this beer."
""
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a blast of sticky, earthy hops that provide a ton of dry bitterness that lingers over the leathery and sweet malt notes into a bone dry finish. The hop profile is one dimensional with very bitter, tongue coating dryness that is a bit overwhelming. Dirty and soil like with a ton of grass and pine flavor countered by spicy rye, leather, toffee and subtle vinous fruit. The caramel malt sweetness and vinous dark fruit notes found in the aroma are almost completely overpowered. The high ABV is well masked with only a touch of heat and alcohol sweetness but this beer is still tough to drink and is in desperate need of some balance. Not a bad beer but it lacks complexity and drinking all 16.9oz was a bit of a chore."
"I’m doin’ this guy with a jelly doughnut—wouldn’t you though? It’s working out pretty well. The super sweet and bright jelly rocks the shit out of the fatty, bitter profile into a push/pull bonanza for a hibernation treat. I’d also, however, go beef/rabbit stew, pot roast with parsnips and carrots, spicy-sausage-topped pizza, Indian, and other super sweet, fruit based desserts, and a shot of whiskey would make this baby shine."
""
"M: it's a big medium actually. Somewhat chewy although it doesn't look that way."
""
""
""
""
"[O] I'm not really digging this. The hop character clashes with the malty strength of the base beer. The mouthfeel isn't as substantial as I would like it to be and the collection of flavors is extremely muddled. First miss by a stellar brewery in my opinion."
""
"D: a big guy for sure, the hops starts things off in an awesome way, especially on the nose. however after a few sips more and more grain comes through until a balance is reached. sticky, rich, woody, big. memory brings me back to stones arrogant bastard."
"It's not necessarily bad, but confusing. I would definitely recommend the other Maine Co. beers. They make some of the best beers I have had, each and every one. This is an outlier for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has many attributes of an excellent beer. Actually, it has many attributes of several excellent beers that don't necessarily belong together. Either make a barleywine or an ipa, or do something totally different and make a strong ale. As it stands, it's tasty, but could be so much more if they went one way or the other."
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet malts, a bit of citurs maybe?? with nice hop flavor without much bitterness. Its a bit hot, but creamy and pleasant. Nice winter brew and great new addition to the MBC line up."
"I like this as a strong ale. The aroma leads one to think this will be a full on DIPA, but the caramel malts really kick strong in accompaniment."
"O: I really thought this was going to be a dainty pale ale when I picked it up. Still not really one that I'd age, and they say not to on the label, but it would be interesting to experiment if I came across it again."
"O - Damn, I love Maine Beer Co's beers. Usually great hop taste and very balanced. This one did not do it for me. It was bottled on 1/23/13 and drank within 30 days of bottling so it was definitely fresh, but I was not a fan of the hop profile on this one. Huge disappointment. I had been drinking a few other hoppy beers today so maybe I had some palate fatigue, but this one was rough."
""
""
""
"O: A lot of people have been calling this a Double IPA. I'd say it's more along the lines of an Imperial Red. Nobody likes calling it a Strong Ale I guess. It's kind of a cop-out. No matter what you decide to call it, this is an excellent beer. It features one of the more memorable hop profiles I've come across in a while, and it drinks far too easily to be 9.1% abv. Maine Beer Co. will have to get Lil One to market in greater numbers next year. This is one beer that people will be clamoring for once word gets out."
""
"The hops here seem to be just a bit off for me. They aren't bad by any means but they don't jump out at me and take over the beer as I expected them too. That would be fine but the malt doesn't really take control either. I guess the beer falls into an odd space for me. The hops aren't big enough for to be a DIPA but the malt is too much to make a regular IPA/hoppy red. Neither seem big enough to make it a strong ale/barleywine. So it's a bit tough to categorize."
""
""
""
"O- This was another great hoppy beer from MBC. The abv was extremely well hidden and the beer was very nicely balanced. Maybe not my favorite in their lineup, but definitely something I would like to try again and worth seeking out. At the $8-9 price tag for a 500ml bottle I'm not sure how often I will be drinking this in the future even if they make it readily available. I definitely recommend at least checking it out though."

"Bottled on 1/31, poured on 2/10. Really surprised at this great ale. Poured a lovely bright amber. Great floral\citrus nose that you find in the best DIPA's (which this beer reminded me more of than the boozier\maltier profile of an American Strong). Contained a unique sweetness that reminded me of watermelon. Hop forward but not a bomb, overall a solid balance. Extremely drinkable for the ABV. A real exceptional beer from MBC."
"The beer pours an odd and ruddy red/candied brown with slight hints of orange. The head is nicely sized and colored almost a sand dune white. The beer’s body is murky, but not dense, with a nice clouding, while the beer’s lacing is light and stringy on the glass, leaving a few strands. On the nose, the beer smells of big piney hops with just a touch of fruity mango and onion. The malt sits below the hops as a very light caramelly touch mixed with some lovely breadiness that blends beautifully with the piney hops. On the tongue, the beer tastes rather straight forward with big grapefruit and pine bitters, with a touch of sweet malts which lead me to think of ruby red grapefruit juice. This taste is sadly subdued for what I was hoping. The beer begins with bitter aspirin, which quickly opens into grapefruit melding with light sweet malts that bring big ruby red grapefruit flavors to the mouth. The finish is strong with grapefruit and pine and a big rush of alcoholic heat, though no alcoholic flavors are present at all. The aftertaste rings nicely with light pine and some sweet caramel malt. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a little bit of heaviness on the tongue. The beer is smooth and creamy, with a nice crispness to it that does leave me feeling slightly refreshed. The mouth is left slightly damp, with only a ghost of the dryness coming off from the hops. Overall this beer is a bit of a disappointment. It is not a horrible beer, but it really doesn’t have the complexity of other Maine Beer Company beers. It reminds me of Celebration, only with more heat in the finish, which is nice I guess, but not worth the $9 I paid for it… The beer really just feels like a Double IPA to me, as I am really not getting enough of the malt from it. The beer is simple and tasty, but I was hoping for so much more and it just did not deliver. This beer is good, but I wouldn’t try it for its price point."
"Overall- This is the best I've had from Maine Beer yet. This is a near perfect IIPA."
""
""
""
"O: Hops are SUPER fresh! This is SUPER tasty! Drink this as soon as you find it!"
"Lots of hops in this beer. Definitely drink it fresh. Very tasty."
""
"O: Apparently this is their new winter beer (at least according to the back of the label). Nicely balanced and way too easy to drink given the 9.1%. Definitely looking forward to either getting more this year or stocking up next winter when it's brewed again. As with nearly all of MBC's brews, drink this one fresh!"
""
""
"This is a much bigger beer than anything MBC has done and I think they mostly succeeded. Personally, I'd like to taste a little more of the malts. What this beer does do very well is masking its high ABV; there are no extra unfermented sugars here. The small batch size of this beer makes me think it will be a while before I have it again, but it appears on the shelves again next winter, I would buy a bottle."
