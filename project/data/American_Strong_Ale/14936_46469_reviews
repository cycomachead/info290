"O:  Fantastic complexity and flavors from this beer.  It has a lot going on and each sip is a true pleasure.  Buy it if you can find it.  The beer has a lot of good whiskey flavors going on but the components are also shining brightly.  A little more heft in the mouth would have been nice though."

"D - One is enough, obviously.  Half of one is probably enough.  Good to try."

"Damn. FiftyFifty makes some fine stuff & I’ve come to expect excellence from them over the years. I am not disappoint, son, darn-tootin’ close to elite status."

"Overall- This is a good beer but an absolutely terrible purchase at $25 a bomber. Really not sure what I was thinking, but it's rare and I had never tried it before. This brew is solid but I wouldn't buy it again unless I saw it on sale for half off."
"Overall: One really tasty brew. This is one deep complex brew that makes it's presence known and rules over your taste buds. I really enjoyed how well the oak shines through while all the other notes duke it out on your tongue"

"OVERALL: This is alright, but certainly nothing special. The oak is a touch perfume-like, which becomes tiring as the bottle empties. An okay beer from a brewery that makes some rather good stuff. Happy to try things from 50/50, but this is not a repeat. Thanks again ScottO!"

"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, citrus zest, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice barrel aged qualities all around."

"O - My first FiftyFifty. Pretty good. Not as well rounded as some barrel aged beers I've tasted but worth a try."
""
"O - It's worth a try, but not sure I agree with the overall rating. There's some aspects of it that are muddled and need to be pulled together."
"M - Full body. Creamy. Light carbonation."

"T- Chocolate and lots of whiskey right away, chocolate covered raisin, light char and a lot of honey sweetness. Flavored get a touch disjointed as the beer warms, but pretty good."
""
"Overall I was extremely pleased with this. Shocked to find and although it's a little steep in the pocket book, it lives up to a hard earned Jackson. It can be tough to find, but when you do, give it a shot. Or a snifter."

"this one is pretty-darned-alright. didn't know what to expect and searched the BA data banks for an inclination of what to expect. this is NOT their stout, but a rather singular ale-type of version. it is similar to the Firestone barrel series, and very comparable. a little thicker than any of the more notable Firestone editions, I think, and that flies in the face of the eclipse series in general as they are much 'thinner' than the TOTALITY stout which is the base brew for the eclipse. but this is really interesting. further, it states that it is TWELVE PERCENT, rather than the 9% stated at the top of tis page which leads me to wonder.... anyway! decent brew. not as smooth and refined as the eclipse series, but very decent in its own right. my first time realizing it even exists after searching out the eclipses the last two years... it's a little rich, though...."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. This brew is quite perplexing. At times, it kinda has a mellow black ipa kinda feel to it. It looks like a stout but smells/tastes strong of american barleywine. It makes sense after reading the blend description but it is strange how the stout aspect is all in the looks and the barleywine dominates every other aspect of the brew except the aftertaste hints towards stout. This is worth trying but not getting crazy over. Unless you are a fan of boozy black ipas, then it is worth flipping your shit over."

"Thanks David!"

"O: I really enjoyed this. After having it on tap a few times I’m glad I got to sit down in a controlled environment and really enjoy a bottle. An excellent blend."

"I am amazed at how well these aromas and flavors play together. Everything is well incorporated. The name says it all: Barrel Aged, Really Tasty."
"o - overall decent strong ale, probably not worth what you'd have to give up to get it."
""
""
"Not my favorite beer from FiftyFifty, but nothing really mind-blowing here. I'm looking forward to see how this ages in the next year or so, as I have one bottle left. Decent, but not sure I'd seek out again."

"Medium bodied with a really strong boozy barrel presence that dominates the flavor, almost completely obliterating and trace of a base beer.  Lots of toasted oak, vanilla, spicy rye and scorching hot booze assaulting the palate.   After it warms up considerably, there is some subtle hops, leathery malt and dark fruit but the boozy barrel character is way too strong.  This brewery usually makes really good barrel aged beers but this turned out to be extremely hot and one dimensional."
"Bart’s decent, but I could use more barrel or bourbon. Interesting blend, though. Really tasty yes; barrel-aged no."
"Fuller body, well carbonated, sticky and slightly dry on the tongue with a lingering effect. This is an awesome example of blending, style bending and barrel aging. I had the opportunity to try this twice but I still wish I had some bottles."
""

"Drink- Incredibly good. I never thought I would get to try this one. Thanks Scott. A very wonderul beer that was complex and layered for days."
"As said above, easier to take down than a regular eclipse, although I am a bit of a lightweight. The smoothness off the tap make this stand out like whoa. A touch of heat, not hot with a above medium body. You gotta try this stuff. I might have to seek this out again."

"PP (Price Point) $7.95 for an 8oz pour. Great deal, do it all day! A dollar an ounce for an insanely good barrel aged product!"
"Can't figure out how something like this, with so much diverse flavor from different component beers, didn't have much heat and didn't really fatigue the palate. This was a great beer to change it up with after a massive palate gauntlet of Eclipse barrel aged stuff that night. Can't wait for this on tap."
"J"
"This was quite good. Not on the same level as Eclipse, but with a bit more work it has the potential to be. Glad that this is going to be bottled next year."
"I recently just had this on tap at the Eclipse pre-release party. It has some great chocolate, oak, earthy hop bitterness, and vanilla notes. Its the perfect blend of stout and barleywine. The bitterness that comes from the barley really pulls out some nice citrusyness that plays well with the vanilla and oak notes. Overall an amazing beer!"
"Sampled at the 2008 Strong Ale Festival, was excited to see this in the lineup after hearing all the hype from the Bistro Barrel Aged Fest, consumed 12/5/08, reviewed from notes, color was a medium brown with some dark orange mixed in, creamy 1/2 inch off white head that had some retention, small amount of lacing also, aroma was filled with whiskey, roasted malts, oak, dark fruit, and both types of chocolate, flavor was a little dry at first with some hops carrying over from the barleywine component, beer gets sweet as it warms with the fruit and malt, oaky characteristics keep it dry enough to keep things in check, bourbon finish is smooth but a little funky at times, there is also a bit of earthiness lingering in the background, mouthfeel is sweet and fairly smooth, body is on the thicker side even after barrel aging for four months, could drink a few glasses of this, especially nice in the winter time, not too filling, I did not know a barleywine and oatmeal stout could blend so well, probably would have been better without the Jack barrel but still quite enjoyable, recommended"
"Poured a dark brown color with red edges and a small sized off white head. Aromas of wood, oaky, bourbon, citrus, and fruity. Tastes of lighter wood, bourbon, fruity, and citrus. Some coffee and oats in the tastes too."
