"Dark copper body, with a full, pillowy white head. One of the most beautiful looking beers I’ve ever laid eyes on. Aromas are pine cones, and wood. The flavours also feature the pine and oak, but caramel malts are shining through as well. There is also some earthy dankness in the mix. A dry bitter finish rounds out the pleasure of drinking this one."

"Sucks they're retiring this one, I was a big fan of this beer."
""
""
""
"Expected more from this beer being oaked age. Poured light body, smells of malts and oak. Taste is thin with hints of vanilla with a burn from the alcohol at the end."
""
"V - Medium."
"I stopped drinking this after the price increase gosh maybe 8 years ago now...Found it on tap the other day and its all I have been drinking, the oak flavors elavate the Arrogant Bastard to outstanding heights"
""
"One of my all time favorite ""strong"" ales. The oaked version of Arrogant Bastard has just a hint of oak under tone that I really enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz Bottle.Very good brew.Not quite as good as the Double Bastard but still pretty good."
""

"A great aged brew."

"Just not feelin' it dawg. I don't like the flavor of it. Struggling to finish one 12oz beer. Glad it was only 1 in a mix-a-six."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little mellower than regular AB, but a better taste.  This is truly a favorite.  Not as sweet as original."
""
"This is the only beer I've given straight 5's for every category so I want to back it up with a review. The first time I had tried this I was completely blown away.  The appearance is a great dark amber with about an inch of tan foamy head. Very inviting to say the least. This beer has the aroma of caramel/vanilla, malt, some citrus overtones and a hint of oak. At the first sip, the taste starts with a nice balance of sweet caramel malt with piney bitterness with a big oak finish that adds a certain sweetness. The oak taste is the best part in my opinion. The feel is smooth and not aggressive for the ABV with lower to moderate carbonation making this an easy drinker. Overall, probably my favorite beer out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker brown body. Oaked malty aroma. Very malty flavors. Good amount of woodyness also comes through."
""
"has a bitter finish but a great tasting Ale!"
""
"It's nice that the oak chips enhance the hops, ergo the bitterness. A very rough beer that many people are probably not ready for, before being worthy. Aggressive, but rewarding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose is extreme malt almost as much bitter.color looks like diarrhea.no bull shit,no pun.nice aggressive kick of dry hops at the end.much rather drink the regular ""bomber"" bastard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Save your money and stick with the original."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the very few beers I give a 5 rating. Will drink this anytime, anyplace, on a daily basis. Just barely better than the non-oaked version."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I hate to say this but this ale is aggressive. This is not for everyone like the brewer said. Both hops and malts come full force and with the aggressive bitterness and also detectable alcohol bite. This beer will take your palate to a bar so it can purposely beat it with a stool. I don’t have a problem slapping two bottles of this at anytime. But after two it might get a bit, tiresome. It is a liquid journey, just not down the alley I would prefer. This brew is worthy."

"The oak barreling mellows out the malt flavor aftertaste yet leaves a slight hoppy flavor.  Has a reddish caramel color and lovely smell.  Not too hoppy and not too malty but will shock the uninitiated to strong ales from Stone.  Arrogancy at its best!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - OK - i just read my review of the non-oaked version. I wrote 'well made beer, just don't like the dry treacle taste'. Ditto!!! The oak does not add enough to this palate. Ah well, proves you need to read your own reviews, not go by scores :-)"

"O: Highly recommended. If you do not like the original Arrogant Bastard due to the lingering bitterness, then try this one! No lingering bitterness with full flavor and hints of bourbon and vanilla!"

"Straight from the Stone brewery into a growler poured into a mug. Lacing for days with a nice creamy head. The oaky nose remains the center stage with the scent from the hops shining  through. Exceptionally smooth while still remaining a flavorful ale in a way that only Stone could do. The hops in the finish keeps the bastard ale arrogant for a good reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2012 On tap. This is one high hop brew that I can take. It has so many things going on that one never knows they're being assaulted by all that bitterness. Well crafted & worth tracking down."

""
""

""
""
""

"The aroma hangs back even as it warms. I get a light woody oak with a hint of caramel malt. The flavor has an apparent bitterness with a drying finish. There's a bit of caramel and some toffee. It’s maltier than I expected, with some oaky tannins, a caramel malt flavor and a long finish."

"M: Probably the best thing about this beer. Don't know what it's like out of the bottle, but on tap, I have never experienced a hoppy beer like this to be so rich and full in it's mouthfeel. Quite an achievement, the best mouthfeel I have experienced."

"Overall, I think I prefer this one to the original AB. The oak adds a depth that makes it a really unique tasting beer, and the fact that it's unused wood instead of something like bourbon barrels makes it cleaner and less hot. Will definitely have to get some more of this excellent brew."

"As a fan of Arrogant Bastard I couldn't wait to try its oak aged uncle. It definitely did not dissappoint. This ale pours one of the sexiest deep rich mahogany colors that I have ever seen in a beer. There is a very slight off white head that gives way to a substantial film and a lot of thick Cream lacing. The aroma is rich and buttery with lots of malty sweet notes reminiscent of caramel, toffee, and vanilla. In addition there is the wonderful aroma of smoky oak and a little piney hops. This ale sips quite thick and syrupy, definitely on the high end of the medium bodied beers. It is not an ale meant to just slug back. For only a 7.2 abver it seems quite thick and full bodied. The flavor surpasses the nose in its rich deliciousness. It is sweet and malty and smoky and at the same time slightly bitter and surprisingly fresh tasting(at least for an aged ale. There are plenty of caramel and vanilla notes, highlighted by the deep richness of the oak and the slighly bitter notes of piney hops. It is sweet but not cloying and simultaneously bitter but not tongue numbing like many Stone offerings. This is truly a great beer. I don't know how Stone does it but they continue to impress me time and time again. Maybe time to make a pilgrimage to visit them and really take all that they have to offer in."

"This is a much more calm version of arrogant bastard - a nice take, but I wish the hops were more present."

"This was the first oaked beer I have ever had, and aging it in oak really adds a lot to this beer. Basically, Stone Brewing Co. took what is already a favorite beer of many, and found a way to make it better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: It’s good. Very tasty, but too bitter for my palate (like most Stone offerings). As with most quality oaked brews, it improves as it warms."

""

"amber color and abundant bubbles make it look appealing and the foamy nature of the thin head is nice. Scents of brown sugar, molasses and maple up front, this mingles later with vanilla, oak and spicy, piney and cedar-like hop aromas. In the background is some faint citrus and overripe fruit. A nice, complex aroma, highlighting the malt, hops and oak quite nicely. Taste begins with a big hit of bitter hops, simply bitter without much flavor. This moves into more bitterness, backed by hints of caramel sweetness, a bit of oak in the background and bitter citrus pith and pine hop flavors. A bit of fruit in the background. The finish is dry, with bitter hop, mostly pine, but with some citrus pith and a bit of toasted malt. The aftertaste is bitter hops and toasted malt. A big, bold flavor, not as well balanced as the aroma, quite bitter, but not bad. The slight sweetness works with the bitter hops to make it quite drinkable, and the oak gives it some nice woodiness. Very good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation and a resinous feel. This makes it quite easy to drink, as it goes down smooth. Overall this is a good strong ale. A nice balanced and complex aroma, bold flavor and smooth mouthfeel combine to make a very nice drinking experience. Good job making a good beer better Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I need to try this fresh, as I know this isn't what this brew is supposed to be. $3.29 for a single of this, and it should have been discounted."
""
"We always say that Stone does best with their special brews, but I am starting to appreciate their everyday beers as well."

"The oak adds a wonderful complexity to the Arrogant Bastard base. A great beer that is very much like an American barleywine, but very well made, unlike some other attempts."

"Update: had it on tap, and it was even better. Very smooth, with nice vanilla and oak notes to complement the earthy hops. Malt profile was far less dominant. Very bitter brew, and very good."

""

"O: I'll post another note with a bottle still in the freshness date. As is this is a very tasty beer though in my opinion not quite to the level of its 'official' BA 100 rating"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is quite hoppy. If this is your thing, then you will love this beer Unfortunately, I am not fan of hoppy beers - this one reminds me more of an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber, slightly dull with a quickly dissipating head. Nose of sugary marzipan, dark fruits like figs, cranberries and cherries. Not picking up any grain or hop scents, just a sweet dark fruitiness. Taste of sweet boozy fruits immediately cut by acrid bitterness. A resiny, pithy bitter that keeps the sweet cooked sugars from being overpowering, finishing on an earthy, woody note that rounds the sharp edges. Full mouthfeel with enough carbonation to keep it from feeling heavy. An improvement on the already fantastic original recipe."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nicely done. I love this beer and the variations of it. The only one I don't seem to like is the pepper variations. But stone is spot on with this brew. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. I like it better than the normal Arrogant Bastard offering."

"There's a lot to like here. The oak aging does a lot of good in this one. The oak gives it a great vanilla note that carries throughout the beer. You also get the strong citrus notes in here that's the counter part to the sweetness. One of the better stone beers available."
""
""
"O - A great brew to really get everything you can out of an American strong ale, like others I would be interested in trying one right off the line fresh"
""
""
""
""
""
"Instead of being an Arrogant Bastard with oak added, this guy really transformed into a mellow, but still very strong beer. Will be buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An absolutely excellent tweak to an already excellent beer. When I'm in the mood for Arrogant Bastard I'll definitely be going oaked from now on. The mellowed down character with depth of flavors makes this even better!"
"O - Awesome beer that is different in todays domination of IPAs. I think this is a fantastic beer to drink in the winter."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber color into a tulip glass. The one finger head shrinks pretty quickly leaving some nice lacing and sparse islands of foam. It sure looks good in the glass though. The smell is all hops and oak. Piney with some citrus undertones, the oak is there stronger than most other oaked beers that I've had. Tastes like an Imperial IPA, strong upfront hops that resound with resiny pines and sour citrus, not unlike most other Stone products that I've tried. The oak is very pronounced, almost fighting with the hops for dominance. The first couple sips are almost unsettling and I'm not really sold on this one. As I finish, I have grown more acclimated to the flavors, but a little underwhelmed. Carbonation is light and the finish seems pretty dry. Overall, I don't think I'll revisit this one for a while, which is a shame as I was looking forward to giving it a try."
""
"O: solid beer. Easy to drink. Lots of flavors to pick up on, but fairly balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really surprised at this one. Drinks and tastes like an IPA. Completely lacks the complexity of the regular bastard and the oak aging is lost on me. Still a good beer, but I'll take other things for the money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Well after being harassed by my buddies about why I haven't drank this beer I decided to give a try. Although I bought the Oaked ABA. It pours out in a nice dark brown reddish color. I think the smell is a lot stronger than the actual taste. once I smelled it with that dark smoky smell I figured it would be a little hard to drink since smell is half the taste. I have to admit I enjoyed it. I will be having this beer again soon."
""
""
"Overall - another complex and flavorful brew from the folks at Stone!"
""
""
"O - Good beer with a lot going on. A nice sipper for a cold evening."
"This is another great beer in the bastard family from stone. A deep amber color is just tempting immediately. You can pick up on the oaken notes in the smell and taste immediately. Low carbonation. The oak notes are very much imparted in the taste. A good hop character still shines through as well. A must try to have at least tasted. I prefer the arrogant or double bastard over the oaked. Although, the oaken bastard is very good."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on tap into a pint glass. Pours slightly cloudy red with little head. Smells of floral and cirtis notes with a nice deep fruity bouquet. Tastes of berries overwhelmingly with slight citrus but still has some lingering bite. Beer is medium bodied nicely carbonated good bite. Overall a superb beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not worthy! This is another solid from Stone. Bold, complex and well balanced. Nevertheless, I still preferred the original version."
""
"Notes - I drank this two days after purchasing, but noticed I'm drinking after the best by date so I'd love to try a fresher one to see if it is any better."

"O - This is one fantastic beer. The oak does wonders for the flavor, and the huge sweetness of the brown sugar and molasses are slightly balanced by the bitter hops. It's surprisingly easy drinking despite 7.2% abv and thick sticky body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't remember this being so sweet when I first had it. Very drinkable and pleasing."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not all that different from the original Arrogant Bastard Ale, but still a welcome development with something to offer."
"D: This is a very nice complement to the base beer. I don’t think it elevates the overall score but the oak is definitely a nice added nuance that works well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer I like quite a bit, finally got around to reviewing it. The fact that it's best by date is up in a week makes me wonder what one fresh off the line would taste like. I've had it before, but didnt pay that much attention to the dates. All were excellent. love that oak flavor. Thanks Stone!"

"O: took me a while to get this one, but I am happy I did. The oak on the taste and smell are done so very well, it sets the bar for others to follow. A great beer with good balance of all elements."
"O - A very good quality beer. Nice beer to sip and enjoy on a rainy evening. Cheers!"

"O- as you are finishing the beer you the taste of the hops fades with the roast tatse taking over. Love it"
""

"Beer poured into a pint had a nice mahogany brown color, the head is a light creamy brown dies rapidly to a slight foamy head, easy to drink under. The first taste had a citrusy bite but the back taste was hops. Not as smooth as many beers, but you don't want this one to be smooth. You want some taste and this has it. A very good beer."

"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall- Good beer, not for everyone though. Strong burnt bitterness."
""
""
"Taste-wise there's dry oakyness at the front with slight cherries and baked apple. It finishes bitter with even more oak. The oak works nicely to subdue the malt and booze. A bit of piny and floral hops are noticable as well. It has a very creamy mouthfeel that tempers the boldness of the flavors. I really love what the oak does to Arrogant Bastard - great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is probably the highest I'll ever rate a non-IPA, but this beer from Stone is very IPA-like as they are obviously using a lot of great hops and you can really taste them through the heavy malt and oak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a beer that could be enjoyed by guys who like lagers and even hopheads. The beer is superior as it warms compared to right after you pop the top. It goes down like an IPA, you get used to it after the first couple sips, then it's really smooth. Another good offering from Stone."
"Overall: Arrogant Bastard got me into craft beer and this oaked version is even better. I love this beer, and always will."
""
""
""
""
"O - insanely complex and a one of a kind. I do, however, prefer the regular Arrogant Bastard"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - one of the best beers I've ever had. This is a good beer for people that like a bit of dark, a bit of hops, and a bit of oak all rolled into one beer. I, personally like all of the above, so this is a treat every time. Cheers!"

"It's almost like a toned-down barley wine in some ways. It kind of makes me think of Arctic Devil, but with hoppy bitterness epmphasized more than sweetness. However, the truth is that this oaked version of Arrogant Bastard is unlike anything else I've ever tasted, and the standard cersion was ALREADY incredibly unique and awesome. A terrific twist which has created a beer that bends the dimensions to its will with its unreal complexities."

"Wow - a tsunami of flavour washes over your tastebuds. Worthy of it's name! It looks good, while the aroma and flavour are stunning. Tons of pine-laden hops and sweet malt, with the booze very well hidden. The hop character lacks depth, but who cares when it's this good? The oak chips are quite subtle but lend a woody dimension with a whiff of vanilla. Body is silky smooth. A top-notch effort; once again Stone school other brewers in how to go nuts with hops. Well worth sampling if you have the chance to try it."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/12/2013. Pours crystal clear ruby red color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, raisin, oak, floral, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and oak notes with moderate hop presence. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, pine resin, orange zest, floral, oak, clove, and floral earthiness. Large resinous pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, pine, oak, clove, nuttiness, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of malt flavors; with the big pine and oak bitterness overshadowing the malts; and a fair amount of cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on, even with the huge bitterness. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - ABA is a work of art and this is just another piece in that gallery of fine Bastard ales. My wife says I'm an arrogant bastard and maybe that's why I like these so much though I think it's more to its in your face flavor that does that. One things for sure I can't get enough Liquid arrogance and Oaked Bastard instantly became an all time favorite for me. Whether its beside the camp fire in mid summer or the fire place on a cold winter night Oaked Bastard seems to find my glass at some point. If you like AB then this is a no brainer. If you don't, well like the bottle says: It's probably not for you anyway."

"Well, this is very good. I recommend giving this a try. It didn't, to me, stand out as something I'd go very far out of my way to seek out. It is good, though, and if it is looking at you, and there are no other good choices at the time, this will definitely come through as a worthwhile drink."
""

"O - Not an ""amazing"" beer but not horrible. If you don't like Arrogant Bastard Ale or Stone Brewing's overall style, you won't like this. If you do, its worth a try—I think it is pretty good."

"I might finish this bottle. I might not. But I will definitely not be drinking another one. Whatever hops they put in this beer, however they add them, it doesn't agree with me. Turns out an oaky version of a beer I don't like is still a beer I don't like."

"Stone.... You guys knocked it outta the park on this one. Everything we love about Arrogant Bastard=The aggressiveness, the sweetness, the gnarled head of foam, and the global reputation were all upheld. All they did was add a fantastic woodsy quality and then tied all the flavors together with re-bar and force-fields."

Pick a four pack up if you find it."

"Pours a cloudy orange-red with a thin off white head that fades into a thin lacing. After a while in the glass the chill haze subsides and the beer clears up. The aroma is pretty muted, the hops may have faded at this point. Its malty with notes of caramel and some woody-vanilla hints. The taste is not as assertive as regular AB. I'm wondering if the oaking mellowed it out a little bit, or if it was the age of the beer. Its a relatively chewy malt bomb. Toffee, bready, caramel and oak are the predominate flavor profiles. The body is medium-thick but not syrupy. There is a slight tannin finish to the beer, presumably from the oaking. I like this beer but I'm not a fan of the tannins. Although I can't complain since the 4-pack was only $5."

"Overall - While I did not like this beer to the extent I like the standard Arrogant Bastard, it is still an excellent beer no doubt. I would highly recommend it, although I would also recommend you drink the original first for a control group (comparison purposes). Great beer."
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. The vanilla in the beer shines through thanks to the oak aging. It's pretty darn delicious. I may revisit this beer if I'm in the mood for a smooth well balanced woody beer."
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Deep gorgeous ruby red, with a full white head that leaves lots of lacing. Smells hoppy like an IPA, but with a thicker malt presence. Taste is similar to the smell; hops up front, solid malts through, but a sweet woody oak finish that sneaks in at the last second. Mouthfeel is pretty full, but smooth. Delicious."
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall: I do like the oak treatment the they added to Arrogant Bastard. It adds a layer of complexity to an already very solid beer. The only downside is the added expense. A solid treat now and then."

"Quite nice, a touch more oak filled and spicy than I would have like but the beer did not suffer for this. The beer was very smooth and highly drinkable despite the relatively high abv. and the strong taste. There was a good malt taste to the beer that complimented the initial early hop one beautifully and went down a treat; a strong but very enjoyable beer."

"""This is an aggressive ale..."" but you most certainly will like it. Pours that signature Bastard darkish red color with a 1.5 finger bone-white head. Head is extremely smooth with great lacing. The smell is very similar to that of the standard Bastard, but with just a hint of the oak chips at the very end. The taste is actually quite different from the standard ABA. This time, sweetness, biterness, and oakiness dominate, with just a bit of pine at the end. The mouth is also quite similar to the original Bastard. Smooth, yet leaves the biterness lingering. Overall, I'm won over. Honestly, I'd probably buy this over the original any day, but unfortunately, it's not as common. Good thing I'm from San Diego!"

"Well, I don't care for the taste but it has some things going for it - the appearance and mouthfeel do win it some points. Unfortunately these pale in comparison to the taste for me. I enjoy barrel aged beers so I'm a bit surprised at this one. I'm guessing this is a polarizing brew. Still though, worth trying once."

"Pours dark red with nice head. Aroma of pine hops and faint oak. Definite malt presence. Flavor has a nice oak up front and strong toffee malt. Hops give it a crisp finish. The dry sharp oak seems to wash out some of the nice regular arrogant bastard malt sweetness that balanced this beer. Not bad, but need to be in the mood for some oakiness for sure. A bit like chewing on a piece of wood."

"O: Good beer that is very much like the original AB. A small difference in the nose and a mellowing of the bitterness in the taste. To make up for the less bitterness there is a good oaky flavor that adds to the complexity of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Very enjoyable mellow beer. My only gripe would be that the flavor profile could have used a little more sweetness to counter act the oaky and earthy notes."

"O-Nice to review a true classic and one of the beers that got me into beer nearly a decade ago. It is a close call between this Bastard and the standard, non-oaked version. Both are great beers, but I think the oak imparts some additional character that pushes this version over the top."

"Pours a rich mahogany with a finger and a half of head. Mild carbonation, good retention and lacing. So far so good. Aroma of hops, some citrus, oak, with some sweet caramel malts making a rigid backbone. Taste follows the nose well, strong up front hops with a tinge of citrus, smokey oak, caramel, some toffee, with sweet malts bringing them all together. Mouth is pretty good as well, strong bitterness, thick full body, with a sticky resin and dry finish. Very easy to drink. Overall a good idea that turned out to be a great one. I prefer this over the regular bastard any day"

"Arrogant Bastard Ale hails from a category that I'm not...um...""skilled"" in; certainly not an expert. I do not prefer brown or Belgian ales so I was actually surprised to find this complex a ""flavor profile"" from a category named American Strong Ale. Generally I do not like the schmaltzy aftertaste of standard ales (English, Belgian and Brown) preferring instead those of the highly hopped IPA category. This beer has harnessed my curiosity to explore the ale experiments a bit more. Very nice beer - copper tone with a limited head but a strident aftertaste of hop. I wouldn't refuse this beer - even at an IPA Beer Bust."
""
""

""
""
""

"O - Very enjoybable. The oak aging really enhanced the character of this brew and raisted the rating quite a bit for me. Good stuff."
"Poured into Duval tulip/\Really suprised at how much the mouthfeel has softened on this one! Not much of a fan of the Stone palate wrecker hop blast style although I can recognize it as good beer... This is really nice. 2008 bottle that's been chillin' in my cellar makes me wish I'd saved a couple more. Deep Amber, great head after 4 years in the bottle. Piney citrus hops are still readily apparent on the nose but the flavor really shines! A smooth operator flavor; quick piney blast, smooth creamy bitterness and soft tea. With an oak finish and smooth, smooth hoperator finish I could drink this all night!"

"O - Having been an Arrogant Bastard fan from day 1, I recall being very excited when this oaked version hit store shelves. I also remember being shocked by the $18/6pk price but buying it anyway. Sadly, I recall not being at all impressed by this beer fresh, finding it quite harsh and not very enjoyable...hence a primary reason this has been sitting quietly in my cellar for 8 years. So, when I stumbled upon this bottle I figured it was as good a time as any to give it another try. What I find now is a truly excellent beer that has held up very well and improved greatly with age. The balance here is just about perfect and the flavors have mellowed a bit and blended together to create a beer that truly surprised me. Not sure I have the patience anymore to lay a beer down for 8 years (at least intentionally), but I am really hoping that I have another of these vintage bottles hiding in a dark corner of my cellar collection."

"O: Meh, it's good, but definitely nothing I would seek out again. I guess I was expecting something ""bigger", but in fact I found the opposite. Hints of oak, no bourbon, faint vanilla, thin body, and a reserved flavor overall. Plus, it's expensive. All things considered, I'll look elsewhere for my next brew."
"Just good."

"Interesting twist. Probably makes it more drinkable as the palate doesn't get wrecked so quickly. But then is it really still AB?"
""
"Overall I gave it a 4, would recommend it to a beer connoisseur but not for the untrained palate that wouldn't appreciate an Arrogant Bastard Ale!"
"O: Fantastic go to beer for a night out. Not too heavy to down a few pints, but strong enough to taste great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is one hell of a beer. It just keeps opening up more and more. The longer you drink it, the more you discover. It's extremely complex and I would recommend it to any true beer lover."

"The mouthfeel was suprisingly average for such an expensive beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This has the hops of an IPA and and a great malt profile with a strong bready and toffee flavor. Very strong flavors without intense bitterness, sweetness, or ABV. The sum of the parts is what creates the intensity. Oakiness adds an additional complexity. I really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Compared to AB? I have no idea. I don’t know which one is better than the other and I would be getting ahead of myself if I said that I did. This is truly something else though, and I could see how someone could say it is better than AB. I love this beer, it is one of my all-time favorites and I look so forward to picking this up again and again and again."
""
""
"Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale is similar to Double-IPAs. Its flavors are intense, complex and demanding. Its flavors continue to develop for what seems like an eternity on the palate. I took my last sip ten minutes ago, but I am still picking up new flavors as I breathe and move my tongue about my mouth. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Taste is good but a bit of a letdown after how good it smells. Maybe if this was a little older the hops would die off more and it would be awesome but as it stands its a little too hoppy to be perfect. Still delicious and I still would never turn one down"
""
""
""
""
""
"However, it has lost a fair portion of the herbal and all of the minty hopping aspects it had fresh... I'd consider that a fair price to pay for the gain of these medium leather and light sherry qualities, especially considering it also reduced the oak wood tannic levels down into the range of my personal palate preferences. Aging this one worked out well for me because of my low tolerance for oak chips, all the extras that happened to come along with it were just extra icing on the cake for me."
""
"Arrogant Bastard is decent. It's a benchmark. Oak is good, but it's often used incorrectly. Stone makes a decent beer better by using oak properly. That's the story, and it's a good one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I personally think this is slightly more drinkable than the non-oaked variety. The oak adds some nice (not excessive) flavor, and mellows out some of the overall harshness. Nicely complex and tasty."
""
""
""
""

"D - Certainly not an everyday brew, but as an occasional treat, this is really something. The earthy profile, hoppy bite, and creamy body all come together to make a remarkable beer for the true beer drinker. Can't wait to try more Stone brews after this one."
"finally ive obtained this. it pours a rich redwood color, clear and amber like tree sap. theres a head an inch or so tall just off white, but it relaxes to just patchy foam after a minute. the nose is less in my face than i thought itd be. its just mellow notes of mature oak, tart dried fruits, and aggressive west coast hops. theres more balance from some nice english caramel or red malts. its also calmed from its original version to an arguably less arrogant and more refined and sophisticated status, which i certainly appreciate. the hops are much more laid back, contributing more than just bitterness. the oak does wonders for this beer, and its definitely my favorite of the bastards. it has a great feel, full bodied but the carbonation is tame from the oak chips, and the finish is complex and refreshing at the same time. the alcohol is also not as evident, which i think is also a positive this time around. i really enjoyed this one."

"Very impressed with this one. Compared to regular Arrogant Bastard, the hops are a bit more aromatic yet toned down on the palate. The malt bill is more prominent and the oak aging certain brings a whole new and tasty element into the mix. If you're a fan of the Bastard series or Stone brews in general, get your hands on some of this."

"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark, reddish brown mahogany color. Hint of smokey oak and grapefruit. Some of the oak comes through on the palate, but it's subtle and adds to the roasted flavor of the malt. Hop bitterness is present as well. Very nice balance of smoky peat and tangy grapefruit, some apricot. Full bodied with a nice long finish that is neither dry nor wet. Leaves a warm feeling in the mouth, body, and soul!"

"As I reviewed the Bastard, I would say Intense, or Aggressive, but I'm also adding another couple of words: Drinkable. Approachable. Same dog, with less bite. Give it a try and enjoy, you'd be hard pressed to not like this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid beer for the style. Not quite as big as most beers from this beer style, but its got a big enough flavor profile to be a legit American Strong Ale. I have drank Arrogant Bastard Ale a few times before and there is no question that the Oak version is a huge improvement over the base beer. Its just much more balanced and alot easier to enjoy. The price tag is a little steep for this brew and I think that there are a few better options available in this beer style for less money."

"One of the best beers out there - Stone brews are often palate wreckers but this beer is a palate reset - especially after hoppy IPAs. Few beers can make that claim and it has something to do with the balance of hops and malt in this beer. The oaking brings a sweeter flavor to the normal AB - slightly more caramel comes through. Sweet pour; sweet head; sweet aroma. Amazing beer."
""
"O: weirdly enough, I have never had (regular) Arrogant Bastard (AB) but Double Bastard (DB) is a staple beer. This Oaked AB was great. Picked up a lot of familiar characetristics from the DB, but with a lighter (less menacing?) palate assault; definitely able to pick up the distinction of the oak, too..."
""
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a somewhat opaque orange brown with a thin white head and light lacing. Woody, malt aroma. Flavor is delicious caramel malt, pine and citrus hops and wood. Medium to heavy bodied. Malt middle and finish with a nice hop kick at the end. Well balanced. One of my all time favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Arrogant Bastard is no longer one my favorite beers now, but after two misfires from Stone (Smoked Porter w/ Vanilla Bean and Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale), it's good to have them get back into my good graces again with this solid - if not amazing - drink. Long live liquid arrogance!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Arogant bastard is one of my favourite beers and the oak aged version is great but I preffer the original. This one tastes more bitter and hoppy which is very tasty but I feel the original edges it."
""
"O- very much like sour beer. Oak is not as prevalent in the brew as I expected. But it definitely changed the character of this beer. I love the original. Nice experiment, but not a must"
"O - I'm honestly not sure what this beer is trying to be. The color and dark caramel character never melded very well with the strong hoppiness of the normal Bastard, and the oaky vanilla character doesn't either. It's not bad, but it's also not very good. Certainly not worth having again, since it's far too small to age."
"OVERALL: This is a big beer. It is also a unique beer. I've had plenty of beers that have seen some oak, but this one has such an intense oak flavor that when I first tasted it I was unsure whether or not I really liked it. After getting over the initial shock, though, I was able to thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the Oaked Arrogant Bastard."

"I'm a bit torn by this beer since I liked it, but found myself wishing I just had the regular AB instead. Nice oak rounding out the hops and malt, and I appreciated the balance, but it seemed to have lost the hop profile I like of the AB. Otherwise, I agree with what most others have said here. Very good beer based on another very good beer from a very good brewery."

"This beer is a whole different animal with oak age and tamed hops. I'll drink this on cask any time I see it."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown copper color with a finger of beige head that retained for a nice long time and left intricate lacing when it finally dissipated. The nose has mild woody notes. The wood also comes through in the flavor profile and nicely accentuates the fine balance of malt and hops. The finish is dry and bitter. As this beer warms, the sweetness from the malt becomes more pronounced yet still blends well with the oak."
""
""
""
"O- Although the standard AB is hard to beat, I just might give the Oaked version preference because of a better balance of aroma and flavor. Fans of AB should absolutely try this incarnation of an already world-class beer, as you might just find yourself reaching for Oaked AB more often...and be sure to get it fresh!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: In the future, I'll probably opt for the regular Arrogant Bastard over this more mature version. However, it is a very nice and complex beer with a flavor that stays with you even minutes after you've swallowed."
""
""
""
"Overall a nice California hop bomb but not quite what I thought it would be."
""
""
""
"O: ok, well, I thought the ""arrogant bastard"" was just an ok beer, but this is way better. Everything is perfectly balanced. Personally, I think the ""oaked"" version of this makes the regular ""arrogant bastard"" look like a kindergartener."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - this was a mild strong ale. I remember liking it, but wish I liked it more. I need to find it fresh on tap I think. Very drinkable, but overall there are both better strong ales and better oak beers out there."

"Poured from the bottle into a shaker. Like the original brew, it pours a deep, dark amber with ruby overtones to it. The head on this pour was a little small, still with lots of carbonation rushing from the bottom, leaves excellent lacing throughout the glass. The nose is a little mellowed in this one compared to the original brew. There is still lots of citrus and piney resin hops, and the caramel sweet malt is there, but it's been smoothed out with a roasty, oaky aroma. The taste is very hop forward, lots of citrus flavor. The oak is there, but not overpowering like you're drinking a beer with whiskey in it. The malts have a more dark fruits, roasty taste to them. Mouthfeel is very full, mildly carbonated, slightly oily with a long bitter finish. Very excellent beer. It is an Arrogant Bastard slightly mellowed by the oak. I will have another please."
""
"Overall this certainly lives up to what one would expect from stone. The addition of oak aging was a perfect accompaniment to an already tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- If you are growing weary of the over exhuberant hoppiness of IPA's and DIPA's but still like something with a bitter kick, this does it. Wish I had bought a six pack. Next time I'd like to try this next to the un-oaked version just for fun. Excellent!"

"Rich chestnut in color with a slight haze, this beer is crowned with an off-white head, leaving copious amounts of firm lace. The smell is intense, if only a little more subdued than the non-oaked version. Thick with hop scents...spicy, woody, rich...toasted malt...bread crust...some dark fruit. The taste is equally intense, full and sense-provoking. Bitter, sweet (not bittersweet), and malty. Loads of hop flavor...herbal and spicy. Long finish with continuous hop qualities. It is hard to find the oak in the beer initially, but it is clearly present when you look for it. All around great."
"In a nutshell; Yup, you guessed it, this is Arrogant Bastard aged on American Oak chips. The oak chips, with their creamy, overt flavors of vanilla and almonds definitely round out the very punchy flavor profile of the original, making it both drier, and more complex. The chips definitely sap a little bit of the fight out of the Chinook hops, letting the malts peep through a tad more. Overall, It'd really depend on my mood which of the two year round produced Arrogant Bastard variants I'd choose. I definitely can't recommend one over the other. My best suggestion is by them both and try them side by side."

"It’s been a while since I’ve had this one and it was still pretty darn good. It’s interesting how the aging not only adds the oak flavor to this but also diminishes the assertiveness of the hop profile a bit, really allowing the aggressive of the roast to come out. The oak aging smoothes this out some; but not nearly as much as you would think."

"I don't know if I'd have it again. Not my fav, but not that bad. Not a fan of cask ales, so maybe if it had a little more carbonation, I'd be more into it."

""
"O- This beer is the business. I prefer the Double bastard but only for special occasion. But compared to the Double, this is much more.... manageable. Delicious stuff here."
""
"I think that I like this better than the original Arrogant Bastard, as it was just much smoother and got more flavorful as it warmed. A fantastic beer that was enjoyable from start to finish."
""
""
""
"Overall - I usually don't allow price to interfere with a beer rating, but this beer is so close to the original, while nearly double the price, that it's hard not to ding it a little here. Not a bad one to try, but stick with the original if price is a concern."
""
""
"Higher marks overall because I know in my head that this beer is well built with full flavor and is balanced. The combination of grapey fruit, syrupy malt and medicinal/pine hops is not my favorite. The oak brings out an interesting dimension but only serves to increase the booze and palate bashing flavors. More of a double ESB with oak, not my favorite."

"original review on: 10-20-2010"
"O: Amazing beer. Complex with great flavors and aromas. They did this beer right."
""
""
"O- Enjoyed the oaked version... try and have a few in my stable for when I'm craving some oaked maltiness."
"Overall I thought that this was an OK beer and a slightly above average example of an American Strong Ale, it had some nice complexity, but some of the things that should have been highlighted ended up being overshadowed by all the sweet malts. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and it was a little boozy, one is enough for me, I wouldn't want a second. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty good in my snifter and it had a nice caramel color along with good head retention. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance and the fact that the barrel treatment really didn't stick out that much. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I am glad I tried it, but when I want something barrel aged, I think I will look elsewhere. I recommend giving this beer a try, but it for sure isn't for everyone. Stone is a pretty good brewery, most of the beers I have had from them have been pretty intense, that's why I was let down with how light the barrel flavors in this beer where, I always expect big, bold and in your face beers from Stone, and this one didn't quite live up to my expectations, it's a decent beer, but nothing worth tracking down, Double Bastard is still my favorite of Stone's Bastard series."
""

"O - I prefer the non-oaked Arrogant Bastard, but the oaked variant is still a good beer. The combination of the rich oak flavours and the citrusy hops strikes me as a bit unusual, but still quite good. Would get again."
"Pours a brownish amber with a small beige head. Aroma is of caramel malt, floral piney hops with some citrus notes. Taste is sweet caramel malt, floral piney hops, some light toasted oak notes and light citrus fruity flavors. Palate is full body and flavor with a slightly sticky mouth feel and good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, floral piney hops ending is sweet bitter hops with some lingering nutty oaked flavor. Overall a good, robust and flavorful brew. Nicely done."
""
""
"Overall enjoyable. I think I may like the unoaked version better as its hop profile is a bitter brighter and less bitter. But the oaky wood notes in this is nice."
""
""
"O: Perhaps I got a rogue bottle, but as it is fresh and the seals are intact I'm confident in declaring this beer over-rated, and while it has some redeemable qualities, not reminiscent of the quality I've come to expect from Stone"
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle to a tulip glass. Deep amber with ruby highlights. Good clarity and nice retention of a light tan head. Aroma is complex, with sweet, caramelly malt up front, followed by piney, rustic hop aroma. Woody aroma from oak is blended and well-balanced. Like the aroma, the flavor is balanced and complex. Lots of hops from start to finish, with a bracing bitterness balanced by just enough malt sweetness. Oak adds just the right amount of complexity without being overpowering. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Nice, dry, lingering bitterness in the finish. Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite beers, and the oaked version didn't disappoint!"

"O - I picked this one up as a single because the six pack price was $16.99. I wasn't sure what to expect because I don't drink many ASA, but I do know that I usually like what oak aging adds to a beer. This beer has a strong aroma and flavor, not unlike an American Barelywine. The oak contributes a good amount of flavor, but the hops really dominate this beer. Malt offers complexity and balance. Overall, a fantastic beer that I highly recommend."

"Pours a dark cherry red color with a half a thumbs width khaki head that quickly recedes to the edges of the glass. Solid lacing. A nice aroma of fruit (particularly cherry), bread, oak, and just a touch of grass. The fruit and oak aroma blends quite well with one another. Flavor follows the aroma quite well. Sweet in the get go, woody in the middle, bitter in the finish along with a touch of alcohol showing itself. A nice balance shared between the different flavors. Medium and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, I enjoyed this one. I would have liked the finish to be just a touch less bitter for my personal tastes and that would have increased the overall score for me but the bitter level still wasn't too much to prevent me from enjoying this. I'd happily drink this again, even at this cost."
"Was somewhat frightened of this one going in since I don't have much experience with oak aged beers yet but I really enjoyed this brew. Nice off white head with a dark brown pour. Smell was wood, maybe alcohol in there as well. Flavor was surprisingly very smooth and not overpowering. Great stuff; would buy again!"
"Single finger head on a cloudy garnet with golden hues with nice lacing. Aroma is subtle but good with mostly caramel, malts, pine hips and bubblegum. Flavor is an improvement on the regular arrogant bastard. The oak and breads are excellent with citrus as pine hops. The mouthfeel is a little creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall definitely an improvement to the standard arrogant bastard and a nice offering from stone."

"I got this on tap last night. Didn't know what to expect since I havent had arrogant bastard in quite a while and don't remember much about it. But this was delicious. Very surprised about how good this was. It had a nice fluffy head that hung with me till the last sip. It was dark where I was so I couldn't really tell the color. Seemed a hazy dark amberish. Smells of malty hops and a bit of oak. Tasted very balanced malt and hop with a hint of the oak that really complimented the flavors. Fairly thick beer, a bit creamy. Very nice overall experience. Would gladly have this one again."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours deep brown with a minimal off-white head that dissipates, leaving some lacing around the edge. Aromas are of hops, wood, and roasted barley malt. The subtle woody flavors really come through as do the flavors of the malt and the bitter hops. The sweetness and bitterness balance well. It's medium bodied with some carbonation. The aftertaste lingers on the back of the tongue. Overall, this is an excellent and interesting beer. If you like the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale, you'll love this one. Perhaps I need to revisit Arrogant Bastard Ale soon."
"O - Good overall smell and flavor. A little heavy, but not overwhelming. Oaked aging really takes a solid beer to the next level. Quite pricy, but worth it if youre into aged beers and like arrogant bastard."

"Hazy, dark brown in color with a ginormous mound of froth that takes 5 minutes to decline to a blanket of tan head with monsterous lacing. The aroma suggests a boozy malted milk shake with herbal qualities and evergreen brown sugar. Nice. The flavor delivers a really wild cotton candy malt with sprucey tinges. Quite sweet with a nutty brown sugar idea. There's a slight medicinal flavor here, but still very sweet. This is solidly medium bodied but it has a bit of an aqueous feel with very delicate carbonation. Like it's original incarnation, this Arrogant Bastard is a very enjoyable brew. No disappointments here."
""
""
"O: This is a great example of why people should keep exploring the art of beer. Stone took a great beer and made it even better. All it took was a little time in some oak to earn it's arrogant title."
""
"Overall, quite good. 4.5 overall reflects that I was somewhere between 4 and 4.5 for taste. Stone has done a good job using oak to compliment the base flavours rather than overpowering them."

"O - Simple amazing. You aren't worthy. I love the standard Arrogant and the oak just adds even more complexity. One of the best Strong Ales hands down."

"see you on the next one."

"O: Wonderful sipping beer, great bold flavor and smell. Definitely an improvement on Arrogant Bastard. I like this one a lot and really enjoyed it."
"I don't know what really makes this so much better than the original. Maybe its because the bitterness is a little more subdued, making this easier to drink. Maybe its that extra taste of oak that gives my palate something else to focus on. But whatever it is, I can say that while I don't like Arrogant Bastard, I LOVE Oaked Arrogant Bastard.

"O – Many beers offer “oaked” or “barrel aged” varieties that are only slightly different than the normal versions. This is NOT one of those. When it says “oaked”, it means “OAKED”. While an excellent brew on its own, you can’t help but compare it with the regular version. Which raises the question….is it better than normal Arrogant Bastard? In my opinion, no. The extreme bitterness of the grapefruit-like hop character AND the extra bitter oak together just equaled kind of an overkill for me, and I find the original to be much smoother and better balanced."
""
"Overall - While it looks like regular Arrogant Bastard, the differences in taste and smell are almost like night and day. Some people may not like the oak intensity of this beer, but other may find this to be yet another excellent offering for all to try."

"Overall: Not sure why exactly but I just don’t enjoy the Arrogant Bastards, oaked or not, all that much. Maybe it’s the assertive hoppiness that detracts from the old/strong ale kind of flavor, with its creamy fruity booziness; it’s a little jarring. Just not that appealing or drinkable to me personally; a bit too hot and boozy. Clearly well executed but not a personal favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The oak aging doesn't come through very strongly on this, though it does change the beer subtly but noticeably, altering the balance a bit and imparting a little extra layering. It's a tough call between the two versions, this one is just a little softer, less intense and maybe a touch less bitter; both are great."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed every sip of this beer and one glass lasted me quite a while. While this isn't exactly a ``light beer'' at 7.2% abv, it's still surprising how slowly this beer insists on being sipped. Much of this is due to the hops, which take this beer to another level. Speaking of which; man, those west coast brewers certainly do love the hop. I'll bet Stone CEO Greg Koch sprinkles whole hops over his morning cereal instead of fresh fruit."
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice brew I keep coming back too, quite refreshing too actually."
"The palate opens with a blend of juicy pine bitterness, citrus fruit, and an immediate oak tickling. There's vanilla, some raw oak character that makes the hops a little cheesey. The mid palate allows the malt character to shine, complex but still light, with caramel, candied fruits, a little bit of burnt sugar, even a little bit of bread. Drying on the finish with some oak, a nice piney bitterness and a little bit of burnt sugar, this beer is medium-light in body and moderately carbonated. The mouthfeel is quite nice here. A good beer."

"Pours a dark brown with amber tints, a small, solid cap of white head that leaves some attractive lacing on the glass. Sweet aroma, caramel and malty goodness, boozy oak, vanilla. Taste follows the aroma, sweet caramel, burnt caramel, oak, hints of booze and vanilla, strong with a bitter finish infused with notes of citrus pith and pine needles. Mouthfeel is full but not too heavy. Another heavy hitter from Stone, very good overall, but not for lightweights."

"O- This was a great beer. I enjoyed this beer more and more with every sip. Perfect balance between hops and sweetness (reminded me a little bit of the 90 minute) and the oak definitely added a little bit of character to it. My only complaints are that I wish it was more affordable (payed $20 for a 6-pack), but it was definitely worth the price."

"O- Great beer! The oak rules with this beer, but the hops also shine through. Nice work Stone!"

"I didn't even like arrogant bastard on first drink, It flew over my head, adding oak was engenius, and radically increases the beers drink-ability. The serving from a cask makes that flavor even more inviting and knocks it out of the park. The consistancy was a little runnier from cask but nothing that should deter you from trying this amazing beer."

"Mouhtfeel is smooth and well-rounded with a rather heavy feel. Overall, OakedAB presents you with a tasty and bold beer with wonderful oak notes and it doesn't come with the Barrel-Aged price tag."
"Overall: Really enjoyed it!! It is a complex experience for sure and pairs with just about anything worth eating."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light brown/amber color with a one finger head that is relatively dense and off-white in color. Smell is of pine and a heavy sweetness, maybe a dark fruit smell. Tastes follows the smell, I get the pine and dark fruit, but also notes of oak that come along with the caramel malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy with easy-going carbonation. This beer is one of the few oak aged beers I like. In general I don't appreciate that flavor, but it comes off well in this beer."
""
"O- Good beer to end the day with."
""
"Good, but feels a bit young, and as often, do the cask really improve the beer?"
""
""
""
"O. An okay beer. A ton of oak and pine. A little too much. Nothing really special about this beer. Try it if it's handed to you, but I wouldn't pay $7 at a bar."
""
""
"Overall: It is almost identical to the original Arrogant Bastard except the the citrus taste has been replaced with a woody flavor. It is impossible to decide which version of the AB I prefer. Nonetheless, this was an excellent experiment which yielded yet another delicious and unique beer from Stone."
""
""
""
""

"My first foray into the Arrogant Bastard lineup and I am won over. All the hops and oak flavor got a little tiresome towards the end but still a great brew."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a ruby red, with a one inch tan head with a hint of red in it, wonderful retention, and lace that rivals the best. Smell is pine, carmel, wood, and grass. Taste is all of that, just a little different then his brother. Not sure it is worse or better just slightly different. Body is larger then its abv would suggest, but very drinkable. Good amount of carbonation and lush not dry. This was a beer that blew me away when I first joined BA. Still complex and wonderful beer, a must try for any beer lover. Best by 1/24/12 thanks Stone for dating."
""
""
""
"I like having 12 oz. samples of this to keep around and it makes for an excellent nightcap. Not the best beer ever, but still pretty darned good."
""
""
"This is one of the best arguments I have tasted for oaking a beer. Take the huge hoppy slap in the face of most Stone beers (not that there's anything wrong with that) and really round off the spike of bitterness; what you're left with are fantastic layers of oaky malt and vanilla, finishing on the back end with sweet dark fruit and citrus rinds. I love the layers and the balance of this, especially compared to the hop bombs of other Stone offerings."
""
""
"Thanks to HeavyCsOptician for this one. Pours a rich dark amber with a nice two finger thick off-white head and plenty of lacing. Poured into a Stone Imperial Stout snifter. Smell is pleasantly hoppy with hints of lemon and a little oak-y. Taste has tons of citrus. Has been a long time since I tried the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale but I can't taste too much of the oaked character of this to know the difference between the two. Nice bitterness. Good carbonation. Medium body. Overall this is good. A sipper for me."
"O: I appreciate the type of barley malt that was used in this American Strong Ale. It almost reminds me of Innis & Gunn minus the sweetness on steroids; or if Fullers made a Strong Ale. Quite enjoyable."
"This beer is an example of something that is more than the sum of its parts. Individually, it has great components, but all together, it really is fantastic. I quite enjoy it. There's a bit to it that I can't quite place, but it comes together to work very well. I haven't had the original Arrogant Bastard in a long while, so I can't attest to how much the oaking actually adds, but irregardless (I love that ""word""), it is a good brew. Not sure if it's worth the expense, but independent of cost, it is a good brew well worth checking out."
""
""
"O: Sadly the taste of this drink doesn't stay the same throughout. It starts off tasting similar to a barleywine, but then it changes to a DIPA back and forth. Even though I loved this drink the first time I had it I can't say that I would pick it up again especially since its price tag."

"Poured a deep ruby red with some mahogany highlights. A yellowish off-white head leaves some lacing and moderate retention. Smell of some dark fruits and lots of malt notes, vaguely reminiscent of the regular Arrogant Bastard (AB). Lots of woody oak character, with a bit of butterscotch and vanilla. Some subdued hop notes in the periphery. Taste has more oak and vanilla qualities, and takes on a feel that comes across like a thinner and lighter AB Some brown sugar, substantial malt notes and hopping that again, vaguely reminds me of the regular AB. A bit of alcohol at the finish as well. Body is a bit disappointing, would've appreciated it to be as big as the standard AB is. Carbonation is a light medium. Not bad on the whole, but the big and bold flavours of AB appear to be lost or subdued - however, I suspect that this may have origins in bottle freshness."

"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the cleanliness. The flavors blended together beautifully, with no flavor taking center stage over the other. We were surprised to find the oak subdued a bit in the nose, but happy that it came through in the flavor, so much so that it added a nice drying crispness to the finish."

"Overall, comparing this to the regular arrogant bastard, an already incredible beer, this beer is delicious. The compliment of the oak to this hoppy beer is great. In addition, the aging has toned down the hops but brought out incredible flavor. I have a bottle of this in the cellar and am looking forward to enjoying it and seeing how the flavors mature over the next few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The oaked version of one of my favorites. This is still a tasty beer; however, the oak seemed to diminish one of my favorite qualities of the original AB, the strong hop presence to balance the impressive malt backbone. With the hops subdued, the oak chips do provide an interesting complexity and different character, but I'll stick with my non-oaked AB from now on. Definitely worth a try though."
""

"If you like oak aged, give it a try, otherwise, your money would be spent better elsewhere."

"Another nice offering from Stone, I prefer this to the regular AB. Im not usually a fan of anything hoppy on oak (or in a barrel) but this is actually quite tasty. All the components work really well together."

"Overall: Pretty good beer comes off like a watered down IPA. The way this was sold to me was like it was the best ale made since sliced bread. Stone never fails in making a good beer but this by far isn't their greatest accomplishment."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not even going to waste my time listing everything. This is by far the WORST beer I have ever had that is rated as a great beer. I have NO idea how anyone could think this has taste or is a great beer. I have a very good grasp on what good beer is and can even appreciate great beer styles I don't prefer, but this is just a horrible beer. I was recommended this beer by a beer steward and told that it is a very good beer, very much worth the $18/6. It is in fact one of the worst tasting beers I've ever had including Bud light!!! It is bitter, tastes like burnt wood or charcoal, is thin, no complexities to speak of, just an overall horrible beer IMHO. This is the LAST time a try a Stone beer. I have had 4 Stone beers and ALL of them have either been a huge let down or out right horrible beers. I can't believe how bad this beer tasted. I've only had a few beers that taste this bad in my life and they are usually the ones that go for $9 for a 24 pack of cans!"

"O- Drank side by side with the regular arrogant bastard and it is remarkable how the nuances of the oak change the beer. I though this one was a little smoother and more balance."

"This is a decent sort of beer, though the ""aged on oak chips"" thing rings of novelty to me (especially if you factor in price). This is enjoyable, but there are plenty other things I enjoy more."
""
"Overall this is a really good beer but not out of this world good. I had to dock a few points because of the price. This beer runs around $22 a six pack in this area which is way too much in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very goodly ale. Certainly no session, but one that I'd love to have more of."
""
""
""
"Cheers..."
""
""
""
"O: A bit surprised by this beer, quite complex, but nos as I expected. I find sweetness and bitterness a bit unbalanced, but overall that's a nice, refreshing brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: While it won't satisfy fans of complex, intense beers (contrary to Stone's marketing), it remains a good beer I'd have again on draught. Don't expect anything incredible; you won't find it here. It hides its ABV well. The price isn't bad here in California, but I imagine this is far from the truth in other states."
""
""
""
"O/D - Pretty solid, yet I can't see the oak imparting too much character on this to make a significant difference. A tasty beer, but it seems like oak influence takes away from what was great about the original. Still a great beer, yet building on something that didn't need tampering with."

"Like the aroma, the flavor has a healthy dose of caramel and toffee. There's lots of earthiness here, along with some rindy hop bitterness. To me the oak is very subtle, detectable but subtle. Makes me think the price-hike on this vis-a-vis regular Bastard is really playing on the gimic aspect as opposed to something actually benefitting the flavor profile. Anyhow, this is flavorful but I'd go regular Bastard if I'm feeling like a Bastard. Prosit!!"

"Color is a reddish-brown, with orange highlights when held to light. The tan head is full and thick, with tons of lacing left behind. Hop aromas come through strongly in the scent. The taste is all kinds of delicious, and incredibly complex. There's so much going on in the taste, it's hard to describe. Caramel, molasses, roasted, spicy, herbal, dark fruit, pine, and citrus. These flavors all come together in perfect balance. Extremely smooth and highly drinkable. World class, indeed."

"I was able to enjoy a 12 ounce bottle of this recently, unfortunately the best by date had passed, but I found this to be a very enjoyable beer. The taste wasn't as significantly different than I was lead to believe, but just like most other Stone brews I found this overall satisfying. The price is pretty high in Denver, but it certainly isn't unreasonable."

"This beer is hard to put a finger on - its has a nice strong brown ale character, heavy maltiness balanced with some subtle vanilla notes, and obviously some significant oak (but not so much that its overwhelming). Medium body, and pretty refreshing, particularly considering the style. Overall this is a really good beer."
"Overall (4.0): Pretty good. They really oaked the shit out of this. Not that it’s bad, it’s just different. Loses a lot of what makes Arrogant Bastard great, even as it successfully reaches for a whole new style of beer, practically. Totally different dimension than original Arrogant Bastard, but I can appreciate what’s happening."
"Overall: A very good Oakes beer. The oak is very prevalent but not overpowering. Very complex flavor profile. Well balanced. Very high drinkability."
"O: I thought the Draft version I had in the Bistro was near outstanding. Lots of oak flavor in that one probably because it was so fresh. I think this bottled version has likely suffered from either age or packaging/handling. Overall, I would definitely try this one again - but fresh!"
"Overall: Somehow I like this even better than the tap version of Oaked Arrogant Bastard, which is quite an accomplishment. The nuance and depth that each flavor takes on in the cask version is incredible."
"O- The oak is certainly noticeable, however, I think it's a little too prominent. I'm glad I finally got to try this, but not sure how often I would want this brew."
"Overall pretty similar to the regular Arrogant Bastard - but with oak. Bold, assertive, tasty."
"Overall is this a very nice strong ale with a nice oak touch."
"seriously. one of the best beers i've had. i've had regular arrogant bastard and i thought it was too hoppy. this is perfect. not sure if it's because of the age on it or if it's because my tolerance for hops has grown"
"Overall, another great offering from Stone."
"O: A great beer. I had it a little too cool at first and it felt terribly underwhelming. That was my bad though. Once I let it warm up it showed a lot more depth."
"This is a good beer overall. Love the oaked element. I have really been digging oaked beers lately. Glad I tried it, will drink again if the mood calls for it. I could see sipping this beer for awhile. It has a strong taste to it that makes you want to savor it."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice dark amber body with not a lot of head. The smell is of roasted malts and some citrus hops comes through. The taste is a little of oak and roasted malts up front, then some bitter hops hits the back of the tongue. It has a nice mouth feel and overall a good and balanced beer."
"This beer smells great looks like a dark chocolate color. Smell is very sweet with fruit aroma but taste is very bitter with extreme beer taste quality head is medium to high. All in all it was to bitter for me but i would definatly try it agian. Plus i did not taste the oak? maybe my pallete is not as refined as i thoght it was?"
"Bitterness is again a wonderfully balanced, an art that Stone has mastered. Similar flavors flavors to Ab; tart cherries, candy apple coating, classy hopping, malty bites . . . but the oaked has a mild toasty edge, soft but present, and a lingering sweet bitterness. I like."
"Taste-Some up-front oak wood dull spiciness, followed by citrus hops and toasted malt. My first impression is that this brew is not as tasty or as well-balanced as the regular Arrogant Bastard. To my palate the oak just gets in the way of an already beautifully balanced and tremendously flavorfull brew that is Arrogant Bastard. To me it's like adding cola to a twelve year old scotch. Not bad, of course, but it's changing the flavor of something that should be tried on its own. Just my opinion. The oaked version is no slouch by any means, and certainly worth a try, but for my money the regular 'Bastard is by far the best!"
"Overall: I like this beer much. I like the oak aging. It adds an edge to the usually Arrogant Bastard Ale."
"O- A delicious brew. Maybe a bit more mellow than the original, but I fail to pick up on any oak qualities (my palate may not be refined enough). Maybe I'll revisit this in the future."
"If you are looking for something different and a neat crossover from wine to beer, this is one to try."
"Overall: OAB is revved up more than regular AB. A real step up over most beers. Really good with cheddar. This one slaps you in the face with proof positive that it earns its arrogant title."
"O - Would definitely drink this again. Stone has proven to be a solid brewing company. Every beer I've had from them is good, and this one might is one of my favorites. They typically aren't exceptional, but always good."
"O - A good, well-rounded beer. The oak adds a nice depth to it that blends well with the original flavors. Everything evolves the longer I have it in the glass too, each sip is better than the previous."
"Overall: This one didn't really do it for me. I mean, its base beer is basically too good to screw up, but the oak seems to detract from the base instead of add. I always avoided this one because the sixers are so damned expensive. I found it sold by the bottle and bought one...so glad I only bought one bottle. Stone, put regular Bastard in sixers and this one in bombers!"
"O- Great beer, you've done it again Stone. I can't decide if I like this more than the original AB though."
"O - A beer that should be talked about more. It only makes sense to put this in bombers and add regular AB to sixers, however now that i've had this I don't really mind that its available in mass quantities. Don't wait any longer, go out and buy more of this, I know I will. Cheers~!"
"Medium body, decent carbonation, smooth and creamy on the tongue. Drinks nicely, the oak aging gives this a much better mouthfeel and adds some pleasant vanilla flavor."
"You can really smell the barrel on this one and it smells delicious. cloudy tanish red with a lovely tan head. Has a really nice sweetness to it from all the malts and the oak comes through in the back and really makes this a super delicious beer. I will absolutely get this again."
"O - Overall this beer is BIG, delicious, smooth, and sexy"
"Pours a very dark crimson-brown with a small foamy 1/4 inch head that settles to a small cap. Small streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of hops, sweet malt, and some oak wood aromas. There is also an earthy, herby aroma I am getting as well. Taste is of some toasted malt, herbal hops, and a woody earth-like flavor that tones down the overall hop flavors. A mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth but slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer where the oak gives Arrogant Bastard's hop overload a bit of a toning down."
"O: I enjoyed this greatly, as I do with every single Stone creation I've ever tried, but I still prefer the original better. Wish they had that available in 12oz six packs."
"o: beer cant be beat for price, availability and overall greatness."
"O- Again, might just be me, but I think the oaky quality really adds a nice balance to the hop punch."
"Damn, this is good. I like the regular AB better but this is its own amazing drink."
"Overall: A delicious brew that I think is better than the original (I rarely think that with oak aged beers). It really balanced it out (though it has been a while since I had one of the originals)."
"O- Very good, very interesting beer. Oak adds some complexity and smoothness to this one."
" Overall this is a GOOD beer that, in my opinion, could have been a GREAT beer had it possessed a more prominent woody taste. This is still a very quality, drinkable, deep brew, but Stone could have been more aggressive with the oak. Cheers!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brownish/amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is hops up front, a bit of oak smoothness, a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique and good beer."
"This poured much like their normal Arrogant Bastard ale with a caramel like brownish orange color and thick white head on top. The lacing does it's job pretty well and sticks to the glass nicely. The smell of the beer is still pretty hoppy, it still smells like Bastard. The addition of oak had a minimal amount of strength in my opinion. The oak shows up slightly on the nose and in the taste but doesn't really curve my thoughts of the beer in either direction. The mouthfeel is nice, it's slick and smooth feeling. Overall I found it to be pretty good and would probably drink it again if I could."
"This is the perfect example of a 10 on my hop bitterness tolerance. Damn good, but I think I prefer the original."
"93."
"O- I like the original, but the oak adds a depth that the original does not have. The smell was a little weak, but the taste more than made up for it. This is a wonderful brew. However, the price is a little steep for a beer that is not off the charts. I will definitely enjoy more of these in the future, but not as often as others that are a little lighter on my wallet."
"O - Overall, this is another great ABA style, I think the smell could be stronger on the oak side, but that might be overwhelming and unbalance the taste side. Definitely a little more on the wood/oak side of things with the normal aba styling, another winner from Stone. This is better then og ABA, screaming bitterness and must have a higher IBU rating. I just wish the sixers were a little less pricey ($15.99 +). Thumbs UP~!!"
"a lot going on with this brew. a damn oak-y beer, the label speaks for itself. if you like arrogant bastard, you'll of course love this ""caskaway"" brother."
"Poured roughly into a tulipish glass, garnet, ruby rudy brown hugh. Light tan two finger rocky head, belgian lace abounds and a light tan ring hangs around. Very fruity malty aroma, with some rounded out vanilla and hoppy citrus notes. A very smooth flavor, robust malts, caramelly malts, and juicy fruity, citrusy hops. The oak does not present itself in flavor, so much as in smoothness, and thats nice. Very full, but sweetish mouthfeel. This is a nice take on Arrogant Bastard, I think the oak does a nice thing for this beer. Very round, a tasty."
"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in a standard pint glass. No dating evident on the bottle. Pours a deep amber hue with a semi-hazy clarity. Head is a quarter inch, loose and off-white in color and eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim. Some spots and a thin sheet of lacing adheres to the side of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses caramel malt, molasses, a suggestion of earthiness and perhaps a trace of coffee. Taste follows nose - not really getting any oak in here but there's a slight citrus character. A light hops bitterness comes out towards the back, but this is definitely a malt-centric brew with enough complexity to keep it from being one-sided or overly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant and even carbonation. Generally speaking, I'm not a huge Stone fan, but this was a solid offering. Not really sure where the oak comes in, but well worth a try nonetheless."
"Just like regular AB, a ton of caramel and brown sugar greet the nose, accompanied by a blast of pine and citrus hops that are at least a strong as the hops. The oak presence isn't at all unpleasant, but I'm not sure it improves things necesarily. In fact, it seems to somewhat blunt the raw power of the hops, particulary in the bitterness error. Not to say the big bad Bastard is tamed; indeed, it's still a force to be reckoned with. The oak simply seems to provide a certain smoothness while coaxing out lots of sweet and buttery subtleties from the malt profile. I prefer regular AB, but the oaked version is very nice as well. I'm curious how it would handle some cellar time. Possibly it would evolve into an exceedingly smooth sipper."
"O - It's a great beer, but as others have notice it is generally pricey. Nonetheless, I highly recommend trying it at least once."
"Full bodied and mostly firm, with a fair edge to it. Interesting and a fine beer, but not up to expectations."
"Overall, a good beer. More subdued than its cousin brewed without oak chips. I like the Arrogant Bastard more, but this is a darn good beer too."
"As much as I like this, I'd take a regular Arrogant Bastard Ale over this any day of the week.. this is a notch below because the hops don't shine like they should. Still a nice brew from Stone."
"Took a little time for me to find the right glass for this ale (don’t ever underestimate the importance of this), but after that Magic! And in picking the glass that worked, it brought out all the best qualities of this ale. I have had the unoaked versions of this ale in bottle and draft. That being said I have read more than a few comments on liking the unoaked version over the oaked, I cannot agree on this one, this stuff is excellent!"
"Enjoy"
"D: Should've bought the whole 6-pack! The oak chips really add a different dimension to this. A delicious offering from Stone"
"O: This is a very good beer. I haven't had a regular Arrogant Bastard in a while so I am not sure how the two compare, but this is my first go with the oaked one and its marvelous. A great beer for anytime of the year."
"Once I could look past the bitterness, there was a creamy mouthfeel that was pleasant. Too much hops, too much lingering bitterness on the tongue for me to try this one again."
"P.S. I had someone else try this beer and they hated it. It was way to strong for him and he'll stick with whatever is on special at the bar that night. Guess I can be arrogant."
"O- Very good. At the price I don't get it often, but I enjoy it when I do."
"This ale is in a category by itself. The brewers choice of hops, nutty flavored barley malt, makes for a very robust, complicated, tongue teasing, ""ale"". After taste of the hops in this beer would be a good thing...but....it disappears a bit too quickly. No problem...take another awesome sip. Loved it!"
"I'm also wondering if the batch the Bros. had from 2003 is substantially different from the one I tried. I'll never know!"
"Overall: This is a very nice brew. Good for anytime of the year. Something that I see myself picking up quite frequently."
"Overall a great beer and glad that I got a chance to enjoy it and I will defiantly pick it up again in the future."
"This is an exceptional beer. It costs a little more than most, but it is definitely worth it."
"I like this beer quite a bit, but I think I prefer normal Bastard. The decision to only put this in 6 packs has always been a little strange to me, but at the same time it kind of makes sense? I dunno, I just know it's good."
"Overall: Nice beer. Very well balanced"
"Overall: Great beer at a great price!"
"Overall, this is excellent fare, and worth the price over the regular six-pack of Arrogant Bastard. Fans of the brand will find even more of the flavors they loved in the original, but in a nicely elite form."
"The oak definitely adds a new dimension to this beer. However, I don't really like it quite as much as the original Arrogant Bastard as the lack of hops hurts the balance found in the original. It is definitely delicious and enjoyable, but just not quite as great as its base beer."
"A fine example of a beer that is cut above the rest, and knows it. It has a whopping, bold taste that is surprisingly very nice. And it smells just as surprisingly good. This is a man's beer, sporting strong, vivid character with a clean finish. Tasted great with barbeque."
"Good beer. Very good beer. Maybe even very very good. With the number of great beers that can be had for less though, I'm not sure very very good is enough for this beer. Still recommended, definitely try one for yourself."
"Overall, this is a great beer(a little too expensive though) that keeps me coming back for more."
"O-Very nice brew, easy to drink and would drink again or recommend...it's got a pretty heavy price tag at 15 bucks but I get it for 10 at my local liquor store so it's a mega score..."
"O: I really, really enjoy this beer. I have had a ton of arrogant bastard over the years. In comparison, I find this version to have more of a biscuit like flavor and a subtle oak flavor. All around I think the flavors are fuller in the oaked arrogant bastard but still balanced well. I suppose the oak aging, or whatever they have done, has made the flavors more pronounced. One thing that surprised me was the obvious biscuit flavor. I don’t recall getting that flavor in the regular arrogant bastard. Once the beer warmed ever so slightly, I noticed the flavors came out wonderfully. This beer is awesome. You should drink it."
"Second time drinking this, first time reviewing it. The regular ABA is probably my favorite go-to beer, so I'm anxious to try this again. Looks just like the regular, pretty dark amber with a thick sticky head and great lace. Smell is sweeter, with a hint of dank, grape and yeast. Doesn't smell as hoppy as ABA. Round yeastiness with a little sweetness, less hop character and more aspirin bitterness. The oak comes across as cloying, burnt toast bitterness on the back of the tongue. Taste gets better and more complex as it warms. Medium thick mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. I don't like that the hops are subdued. Not at all bad, but I much prefer my regular ABA."
"Overall a great beer, rare too for me here in the UK."
"All in all, I rated it high because how it accompanied my meal, it was faaan-tastic! I don't know if I would have loved it as much on its own... but my next BBQ, some Oaked Bastard is what I will be serving."
"Looks great with a nice head and thick pour. Smell reminds me of a marzen-ipa if that makes sense. Lots of hops and caramel and it shows up in the flavor along with a pleasant smoky ""bite"" that isn't from the hops. I'm guessing it is from the oak, but i'm not really tasting any vanilla even though I'm looking for it. The mouthfeel is perfect and satisfying. A great drinking beer that is constantly in my fridge."
"A nice nightcap of a beer, one that I enjoyed sipping outside while watching the fireworks - at least until the hippy crawled out of the weeds and started chattering about how my beer-drinking reminded him of the Boston tea party and how that won the Revoloutionary War(?)."
"This pours a dark copper color, with a light brown head, it leaves behind foam lags as it goes away. It smells of hops and sweet malts, maybe a little caramel and slightly woody. Medium mouth feel plenty of carbonation and hop stickiness. The taste is a little different form the regular AB, there are some woody hints which is quite nice, there are tons of hops and a little malty sweetness in the middle (which is quickly overpowered by the lingering hops bitter after flavor). This is one heck of a brew, the subtle change is very welcomed and i like the hints of a woody taste, once again Stone has developed a fantastic brew."
"Not crazy about it, and unsure if I should hold the rest longer."
"O: A skillfully crafted brew; the enhancement of the Arrogant Bastard series with Oak tones takes an excellent beer and succeeds in making a captivating variation. If you don't enjoy it, ""You're not worthy."""
"O (D) - it's a good, hop-forward, but multi-dimensional beer. I dont know how fresh this bottle is though. It's a bit pricy."
"Overall, Oaked Arrogant Bastard is a damn good brew, which of course is to be expected of any variant of the Arrogant Bastard franchise. It's big and complex, and the oak just adds an interesting new component to an already great beer."
"O: This is a fantastic brew. Stone never ceases to impress me with each of their brews."
"Overall I really like this beer. I get apprehensive about trying an oak aged beer, because they became so popular a few years ago and it seems like they were oaking everything for a while. Not always to positive results. This is one of the exceptions and a beer I would definitely go back to."
"If you can still find it buy it now, this is by far the best incarnation of Arrogant Bastard."
"Fantastic stuff. One of my favorite oak aged creations, and on tap it's nearly off the charts."
"O: Overall a very good beer. Far more complex and superior to the original Arrogant Bastard. However, it is not quite at the level of the Double Bastard, or my personal favorite Stone offering, the Sublimely Self Righteous Ale. Still though, a very good brew in its own right. I would recommend this beer and plan on enjoying it again."
"O: Very good brew. A nice change from the regular Arrogant Bastard. Love the big caramel flavor. Definitely will get again. For the price this one is to be savored!"
"OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale is unique and delicious in a dark way. It makes you realize where they get the inspiration for their mascot, assuming the gargoyle is a mascot and not their supreme overlord. Another fine entry, “Stone Brewing Co.”"
"This beer pours a hazy reddish brown color with a nice thick slightly off white head that sticks to the sides of the glass. the smell is hoppy with malt hints and a definite oak presence. the taste is dominated by oak with a strong floral and bitter hop presence and then the malt sweetness to finish off the flavor. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. this is an awesome beer to sip, but it is hard to drink more than 2."
"Stone did an excellent job adding a little extra on top of their already magnificent line of beers. The experience you get from drinking this brew is what makes it so good. Full of flavor, smell, and leaves you feeling good. Not quite as much of a hop gives it a smoothness you don't always find in Stone brews."
"Overall I have enjoyed this for many years but am just getting to reviewing it. I know now why I have yet to sit down and try to describe what goes on in my mouth when I drink this or it's unoaked brother. Very complex and almost un-describable, but that's most definitely not a bad thing. A must purchase if you are lucky enough to get the chance!!!!"
"Overall Impression- Fantastic! Much better than the original Arrogant Bastard with the woody/oaked character throughout. Nice warming and would be a perfect beer for the winter. I won't be going to this much during the summer but awesome Strong Ale! I am looking forward to enjoying my Arrogant Bastard that I started aging in April of this year."
"O-Real solid.The oak is well played,not obnoxious.Really compliments the beer well."
"Pretty good overall, but my least favorite of the bastard series."
"Overall: Love it. Great addition to the Arrogant Bastard Series."
"Overall a great beer, I prefer this to regular AB and will seek it out. You should do the same!!"
"O--I love Oaked Arrogant. I find this much easier to consistently drink than regular Arrogant. Very much a fan of this."
"Pours a light cocacola hue with minimal head and no lacing. Looks similiar to a socttish ale (old chub?). Smell is sweet with a touch of oak, vanilla, hops and malt..also some citrus. The taste is oaky, but sweet. Much smoother than the standard AB. Mouthfeel there is a touch of dryness, but it is not unwelcome. Overall enjoyed this beer very much. Id buy this over their standard offering if not for the price."
"Overall fantastic Strong Ale with tons of flavor, and a complexity that allows you to taste all flavors. Yet doesn’t let any one of them overpower the other."
"Stone always seems to please and this gem is no exception. I never take offense to the arrogance of the label. I just put my lips together and move on. Appearance is a rich amber with nice head and wonderful beige lacing. Smell is toasted bread, piney floral hops. Tastes: the malt is abundant and toasted but complemented nicely by the plethora of hopalisciousness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall a wonderful American strong ale with complexity that even I am incapable of capturing using mere human language. Cheers."
"O - I think I enjoy oaked bastard more than the regular version. This one is more complex and keeps you on your toes, while the regular version is a bit one dimensional. Pretty good stuff."
"Dark brownish black beer with brown on the edges and an off-white head. It smells of hard malts and some bitter wood and hops. This must be dryhopped or something on the end because it has a really hoppy finish on top of all the other roasted malts and dark fruits. It's actually quite nice but a load to drink. Bought myself a six pack after trying it on tap."
"Oh malty goodness. With some very nice hop flavors to accentuate the barley malt. The hops, in fact are perfectly bitter and lingering, but you don't leave the first taste thinking of the hops. You think of the bread-like taste first, then the hops actually take over in the finish. Alcohol taste is definitely present, but in no way does it take away from the beer. It finishes dryly, but not exactly crisply, and almost refreshing but definitely not the best beer for a hot day. This is full-bodied without being overbearingly thick in the mouth. I honestly expected this to be more like regular Arrogant Bastard, but with the oaked variety it seems like the oak chips took an edge of that maltiness and a spiciness to it that was either lost in the muddled feel of the non-oaked variety or simply wasn't there. Either way, I prefer this one and the fact that it's way more drinkable than its brother. The mouthfeel was not as thick and hard to drink. The oak chips make all the difference in the world to the overall drinkability of this one, and for that this beer is fantastic."
"Overall, this beer is outstanding. The oak aging gives it a sort of smoothness and adds a hint of tartness as well. Hops dominate but the malts provide good balance. A must try beer for any IPA fan."
"Overall. Great stuff. The oak is awesome. Not crazy complex, but plenty going on to keep things interesting."
"O - Alittle more refined than the standard version and recommended"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a SA Perfect Pint glass,this beer is a deep copper color with a medium off white cascading head. This brew looks very good. The aroma is sweet with notes of plums and dark fruits,caramel,spices,and of course wood,with a hint of alcohol. The barrel aging is immediately obvious with oak and woodiness slowly giving way to bitter hoppiness. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is just about right,with the alcohol taste just barely present. The additional oak aging adds a new layer of complexity over regular Arrogant Bastard. The bitter character of this beer is the perfect foil to the delicious sweetness in the smell. "
"Poured garnet red with two fingers of creamy beige head. Smell is fairly muted. Subdued hops, wood and plums. Taste is a very nice presentation of bitter citric, resinous and floral hop elements, light malty sweetness and subtle pineapple, tropical feel. The body holds up well, moderately creamy with ample carbonation. Good stuff, different than the 'regular' bastard."
"Very active, removed the cork and it came out in a lava flow. I was quick to slurp up the spillage...can't let good beer go to waste. Pour give a big head on tan foam, leaving heavy lace as it settles. Looks like a 18 on the SRM beer color chart. As is swirl and stick my nose in the glass, I am bombarded by wonderful, heavy, sort of syrupy fragrance of sweet and sour. Lots of grapefruit, spices, and pine, but then on the other end of the scale there is vanilla, cherries, figs, caramel, toffee, and sweet malt. Taste is better than the smell, smooth rush of tartness from the hops in the guise of grapefruit, lime, and pine. Then there is the sweetness of toffee, vanilla, caramel, wild cherry, and sweet malt. Mouthfeel has tons of body and depth. Creamy, with a touch of drying, plenty of zing from the carbonation. One will do me for a spell, but if I see another, I will make it mine."
"Much better as it warms. The bitterness tones down a bit, and the sweet malt becomes more competitive."
"Overall: A very tasty and interesting brew. Fairly easy drinking."
"A big beer, for certain. Enjoyed this one, but with caution. It's quite a sensory overload."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. It was very balanced and went down very smooth. The oak was a great taste, but definitely didn't dominate like I thought it was going to. Will hopefully enjoy again in the near future."
"A pretty decent strong ale, still not at the top of my list though. I love Stone, but unlike a lot of my friends, AB and it's offshoots don't do it for me."
"This is a very drinkable and pleasant ale, and the oak notes are a very nice compliment to this beer, and I especially appreciate the fact that while the oak is prominent in this beer, it does not take over or dominate the other flavors, and all for a very reasonable price!"
"What an increible brew; quite filling towards the end but extremely drinkable and smooth. Stone really nailed it, a significant improvement over the original AB."
"Overall this beer is good. The booze seems kind of pronounced considering this beer is 7.2 abv. I dont necessarily taste any oak but this beer is different than regular Arrogant Bastard which I prefer over this one."
"This brew pours an impressive semi see through amber hue with decent carbonation that leaves a two finger head and nice lacing,the smell is vanilla,raisins,alcohol,piney resiny hops and caramel candy,it has a medium bodied well carbonated semi sticky mouthfeel and has tastes of oak,figs,boiled candy,sticky date pudding and finished with a beautiful all round mouth numbing bitterness and overall a very pleasant drop to drink and would drink/buy again cheers."
"Overall this is better than I expected. Very good beer."
"O: Oak Aged AB takes a bit of the hop wallop out of the sails, but the essence of these West-Coast varietals are still very much at play. On the plus side, the 7.2% ABV and hop chaos is smoothed out so nicely and malts are really brought forward by the calming, refining qualities of wood-aging the beer. An excellent sipper just dying to be paired with a good cigar."
"O: This is a really really good beer. I don't have other ways to put it out. It really is a great beer from a great brewery. Drinkability is off the charts."
"O: Candied caramel apple with peach/plum, piney, and oaky flavors. Awesome. More hop-forward than Arrogant Bastard with more complexity and a smoother feel. My favorite of the four Bastards and one of the better beers I've had."
"O: well done, prefer the flagship, but not bad either."
"CHEERS!!"
"Final thought - good beer not worth the money unless you have never had it"
"O: Delicious. Oak flavor gives it even more depth than the original bastard."
"Overall Drinkability - This definitely made my list of top IPAs. I definitely recommend it. Has a good amount of complexity due to the sweetness you don't normally find in an IPA."
"Overall: in my opinion, the Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale is definitely superior to the ""standard"" Arrogant Bastard. Great stuff!"
"This beer is absurd in its complexity. Delicious, powerful, and downright intriguing. When fresh, this beer is a masterpiece."
"O: Overall, I love Arrogant Bastard, but not this version. Sort of a weak review, but I've already reviewed Arrogant Bastard to much acclaim, and just am not digging this variation."
"overall this beer takes a huge hit based on its price $18 a sixer - - how in the world did they come up with this price"
"Hopheads should delight in this one. Yeah, I know it has malt, but boy does it have hops too. Although this is aged with oak, I didn't notice an overwhelming leaning toward wood. Just enough to make this a really great beer. Highly recommended."
"this was good, the best i've ever had oaked bastard."
"O: A damn good brew. I’m definitely a lot more eager to try the “Oaked” counterparts of my other favorites now that I’ve seen what a difference oak-aging can do. Definitely worth the price difference, down to the last penny."
"Poured a 2"" head with a body packed with effervesence. Lovely auburn red color blows me away. Smell was milder than I expected, some maltiness and hops. Taste at first sip seems a little salty, but a richness and hoppiness still comes through. Honestly I think the oaking cut the power of the hops down from the unoaked version. And why chips vs oak barrels? Chips are what less reputable vintners use in wine (cheaper, and although I think it's a similar effect I swear I can taste the difference in wines too). All in all this is an excellent beer but I prefer the unoaked version, which I scored higher."
"O:The inception of its tale."
"Overall: The Oaked Arrogant Bastard is the first real microbrew that I've had after discovering craft beers. I'm glad that I found the time to review this beer after drinking it for the first time. The beer is great with its strong taste and smell. What I don't like is the price of a six-pack (17.99 is kinda of steep.)."
"All in all, this is a solid, interesting and complex ASA. I'm happy to say that I've never really had a beer like this before and I enjoyed the experience. One day in the future I'll have this with the regular version to help me appreciate what the oak aging has done for this beer. This marks my first offering I've had from Stone and it's sure not to be the last."
"O: Good stuff but fairly one or two dimensional. This is not an A+ beer ... I don't get it!?"
"Overall - Very glad I took a ""chance"" on this one; I do not regret it. Have never had the regular Arrogant Bastard, but it is on my ""to-do"" list for sure!"
"Poured down the middle of a tulip glass from a 12oz. bottle, produces a one finger foamy head, that settles quickly with minimal lacing. The hazy, sediment filled dark ruby tobacco burst strong ale gives off unidentified fruit and sweetness in the nose. I was beginning to have my doubts about this bastard of a beer until I tasted it. Wow! Rich and complex. Bitterness up front and all around, evens out with a caramel malt finish. The bitterness lingers, without any leafy hop presence. Smoky, roasty, oak notes with hints of vanilla. Alcohol and fruity esters start to appear as you work your way through the pint. The imparted oak characteristics coat your mouth, and become present in great depth. It's starting to taste like a campfire. As it warms, bitterness increases up front with currant, tobacco and chocolate. I can't get over how much is coming out of this beer. Roasted malts start to dominate at the end. The flavor of this beer is it's strong point, but the mouthfeel is a close second. Crisp carbonation pairs well with a medium-thick body. The 7.2% is like a smack in the face from the gargoyle who sits on the front of the bottle, daring you to drink. Thank you sir, may I have another! I'm not worthy!"
"Its kind of funny, you look at the bottle on this brew, and the label says ""Your Not Worthy."" Its very true. This brew is a great representation of the style. I have had the original Arrogant Bastard, which is also an amazing brew. This brew steps it down, but not in a bad way. It gives it a more reserved, almost elegant version of teh brew. It still hop strong and a great brew. I can't wait to get my hands on another bottle of this brew. Until you have tried other respresentions of this sytle, your truely Not Worthy to have this brew."
"Pours golden brown with a big tan head that sits for a while. A touch of oak appears along side hops and a sugary caramel in the nose (or something like that). My wife thinks it smells like an asian sauce of some sort and, after the suggestion, I didn't disagree. The flavor is big hops atop that light caramel flavor with the faintest hint of oak. You could slip this past someone as Arrogant Bastard in my opinion without them knowing. That said, this is a very solid beer anyway. Big carb and a bit of lingering sweetness accompany the hoppy finish. Overall, a darn good beer, oak or little to no oak. A bit more complexity from the oak - vanilla and wood, would have melded with the caramel flavor and the hops to make a dream beer."
"Finish: Sweet bitter hop"
"The oak aging adds depth to this decent beer, without being overbearing as would be the case if you bourbon/whiskey barrel-aged the beer."
"Overall this is a good offering from Stone. I enjoyed it more than original AB."
"O: Good combination of hop, malt and oak flavors, they all blend really nicely with eachother witout any of them being overpowering."
"M/D - Sweet but not cloying. Smooth without much carbonation. Every sip is enjoyable and gets better as it warms to room temperature. Very drinkable and definitely recommended."
"O - A unique and tasty beer. One of Stone's best!"
"O: Stone is as good as it gets and for them to throw some oak into arrogant bastard and enhance its already stellar flavor, is just another example of pure genious. I love the West Coast brewers and their use of hops in beer and this is one of the best."
"3.5"
"Opinion: As I prefaced in my review, I really enjoy this version of the Bastard. It is definitely one of the better hop-balanced beer out there, IMO. There is so much going on here that it is a little surprising that it is only 7.2% ABV. At the price I won't be drinking this too regularly, but I must say that if you like the original Bastard, you have to give this version a try as it takes an already good beer up a notch."
"Again, this is more accessible and easier-drinking than standard Arrogant. I was worried the oak really wouldn't show up and while it still is a bit muted, the purpose for adding it is there in the drink."
"O: love it! Hard to choose my favorite from the Bastard series.."
"O - Will have this again when I have time to sit and absorb it, not a session beer but very drinkable with a ton of flavor. It makes me think of Great Divide's 17th Anniversary DIPA. 4.5"
"A brilliant ale, in my opinion. Full bodied and full flavored. It has a spicy hop kick that is unmatched... at least in the ale's that ive tasted"
"I'm a big fan of the original Arrogant Bastard. This one is excellent too, but I think I like the original better. This one pours nicely, and the deep red color is beautiful. The oaky flavor is lovely, but the original AB is really special. The added oak flavor is a nice twist, but not needed."
"Overall its not my favorite of the Bastard line up but I like what they did with this.I want to get this again in the future.If you enjoy the style I would say get this."
"Definitely liked drinking this one, and will get again."
"O- excellent beer, very tough to beat. just wish it wasnt $18 a sixer"
"I'm a big fan of their original Arrogant Bastard so I had to try this one. On the first smell I get a smoked sweet oak scent with some pine and citrus from the hops. It starts off with the smokey oak sweetness mixing in with the regular roasted thick almost caramel like malts they normally use in the original version. The oak is pretty strong in the middle of the taste which sticks around on the middle of the tongue just as long as the bitterness from the hops stick around on the back of the tongue. It's pretty rich and has a thick mouthfeel and could pass for an Imperial beer easily with the richness and body that it has. I love how Stone hops their beers they never fail me when I'm looking for that hop punch. They aren't a one trick pony though and this beer proves it. They incorporated the oak flavor so well in this that it makes an already amazing beer even better and more complex. You won't be disappointed if you are a fan of their beers... this might even turn out be your favorite from them."
"A mouthful reveals the smoky oak flavor as advertised, with a soft citrus edge bolstered by a generous grain bill with a hint of toffee sweetness and bitter hazelnut notes. Strong hop presence with lingering bitterness leaves you feeling worthy. Robust and intimidating, it delivers the wallop of a big beer with some style. A real American Strong Ale with the personality of a dark, rogue double IPA."
"A truly special beer and a delicious version of a classic."
"So how do you take one of the best beers ever and make it even better? Freakin age it in oak barrels! Dark coloring with a light head give this beer the attitude that lives up to its name. The great hoppiness that comes from the hopheads at Stone give this a flavor you want to come back to. The smoothness that comes from aging in oak barrels is also a delight. Get excited every time I have this one."
"A very nice American Ale. Big, balanced, and quite flavorful."
"Overall its a great brew, the oakiness was like good oaked red wine {cab} Nice blended balance in the taste and smell."
"O- Too much booze...too much grapefruit without balance...did not like....poured this after 1/2 and grabbed something else."
"-Cheers"
"A worthy variation on a great beer."
"Wow, some good beer here."
"O: The faded hops do not hurt this one because it is more malty in the first place. It is tasty but to expensive to revisit often."
"D - A bit too full bodied for me to put away many, but this is overall a solid big-flavored beer that I really enjoyed."
"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
"Drinkability is low for me, as are most heavier ales. But 1-3, perfect. Hearty beer, perfect for winter. Gotta find this on tap next."
"Medium bodied, slick and oily mouthfeel, with just enough light carbonation to keep your tongue from being tarred with wood juice. Finish is a long and lingering fresh oak with light grapefruit peel bitterness. Fairly easy to drink, if you can get past how wooden this version of the Bastard is. Not really my type of wood flavor."
"D - I don't know how many of these my taste buds could handle, but this was definitely very good. another spectacularly crafted stone brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is slightly under medium bodied with nice fine carbonation. Not quite creamy, but still pretty good. This beer is more drinkable than the rest of the related strong ales, but not much more so. In the end though, the oak really does nice things to this beer."
"M - Smooth with a semi-sweet finish. Touch of milk chocolate on the backend."
"Drinkability: This is just what I was looking for to sit and enjoy the Bruins v. Sabres game tonight. Will def. have another"
"This was a gamble of a few beer I purchased, and I've very glad I did."
"D: The strength of this beer is in its balance. The oak could have easily been too strong, the hops too bitter or too floral, or the malt too sweet...but they get it right and the result is a great overall drinking experience."
"Overall I wouldn't look for this beer again, but the fact that most reviewers said thatthis beer had massive hop presence, and the fact that my bottle is both older and hasn't been refrigerated, leads me to think I'll be buying a fresh bottle someday to re-review."
"D: I thought that the taste here was good, not great... but the amazing mouthfeel and complex flavor keep drawing me back in, and at much faster rate than that of many beers whose tastes I prefer. Could easily have a few glasses of this."
"taste ,mouthfeel and drinkablity just wonderful"
"Amazing. Who would have thought oak chips would impact the flavor like they did. Definitely has softened some of the rougher edges on the base beer (Arrogant Bastard Ale). It's a definite improvement on an already damn good beer. Highly recommend."
"D: Arrogant Bastard is a favorite beer of mine. Oaked Arrogant Bastard is all that greatness, with a mellow calming wood sensation that I don't think is rivaled in any other oaked beer I've had. Truly remarkable."
"Overall: I prefer this to regular Arrogant Bastard. A nice American Strong Ale."
"Drinkability is good, its a very inviting beer, but the alcohol is a little high to have more than a few at a time."
"D - I can understand why this is so highly rated, with a nice balance between sweet and bitter and malts and hops. The oak provides a bit of class and is a unique accent to the bold flavours. Really enjoyed this one!"
"Better than the original. Very god beer."
"D- This beer was good but not what i expected.I was hoping it to be alittl more flavorfull and not so dry tasteing but still a very good drinkable beer!"
"D: extremely drinkable. it is really hard to tell this is pushing 7.2%abv. drinks like an 5.0% amber."
"D: A tasty beer, and quite possibly the best offering I have had from Stone. Well worth trying. I'd have it again."
"You are not oaked worthy! Still, it pours a semi-murky garnet topped by a finger of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises the standard fare of pine and grapefruit, along with a decent blast of flowers, a solid contingent of caramel, and a small amount of, you guessed it, oak in the background. The taste followed very similarly, with the oak playing a nice supporting role to the other aforementioned elements. Nothing overbearing, which is refreshing in these days of o'erblown wood-aging nonsense. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a very nice brew, though I'm not sure I would necessarily take it over the normal Bastard on a regular basis."
"Drink - A very interesting beer that I'm happy I tried. I'm not sure I've had anything quite like it before. That being said, I'm not sure I'd seek it out again."
"Pours a dark crimson color with pillow of khaki/tan colored head that lingers and leaves good lacing. Scent brings an aggressive yet balanced attack of hops (grapefruit and pine), malt (carmel and toffee) and oak (vanilla and dried oak). First sip hints at boldness, but oak aging smooths it out nicely, all components of scent are there aggressively, but aging has allowed them to smooth out and increase drinkability. Soft on the palate, medium bodied, slightly dry. A very nice beer which showcases what oak aging can do to a beer as big as the Bastard."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer. I love the sweet flavor and the vanilla and will definitely have more in the future."
"I'm a relative newbie and fully respect it's probably my unrefined palate that doesn't recognize a superior beer here. All the top reviewers love this. I'll revisit in a few years."
"D - same same but different from the original bastard, the minty note is very refreshing and the woodiness ads more depth to this strong ale, this edges out the regular arrogant bastard for my money"
"This beer is very well balanced, appeasing an aggressive hopping with sweet malts and sour fruit esters. The woody oak flavor serves to relax the tension between the mighty flavors at odds. Each sip leaves a dry, bitter hop flavor on the tongue with the more cautious oak surrounding. The back of your throat reminds you of the past sweet vanilla malts and invites another sip. I would recommend checking out the Oaked version of the Bastard, but definitely check out Arrogant Bastard first."
"First time trying this beer.. Pours a medium dark brown w/ a thin off white head that quickly disappears. The smell is fantastic- Caramel, Hops, malt. It smells like a Stone beer. Wow, I'm looking forward to trying this. OK- The taste is even better! The Oak makes itself known here, along w/ malt, and a big hop presence. Maybe a little grapefruit in there too. Amazing how balanced this beer is, how everything works together for an amazing result. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet the hops give a bite to the feel. Balanced in perfect harmony. This is super easy to drink as well. I could down several of these before the 7.2% ABV kicked in. Just like everything else I've had from Stone, this beer doesn't disappoint. In fact, I would have to put this in the World Class category. Fantastic Beer. Will definitely pick this one up again."
"Try them both - the Arrogant Bastard and the Oaked. They live up to the hype they get IMHO"
"Might have gotten a bad batch, but Overall not impressed at all, long lasting aftertaste. Thick, heavy beer. Long lasting head about 2 fingers tall, cream or off white in color, deep red/brown in color. Had a burnt coffee/wood smell, with a burnt coffee kick in the face for taste."
"Notes: This is a great one off of the original Bastard."
"D: Love this one, I would get this one any time that I can get it fresh!"
"D- Easily drinkable, goes down easy. I have to say I kind've put this beer on a pedestool heading into the festival as one of my must try's and was a little let down. Maybe I'll have to revesit this one later."
"Great carbonation level and mouthfeel makes this very drinkable but not really a session beer. Perfect for a night in the hotel room."
"A classic, and delicious drink. Nice winter beer."
"D- Pretty good but I dont think it is an improvement of the original. I like the addition though and makes for a pretty good beer."
"D: a perfectly balanced, flavorful brew that could easily be enjoyed in multiples without knocking you out."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I've been wanting to try this for a while, but couldn't bring myself to cough up the $20 per six pack. And then bam! I was browsing the singles section at beer run and they had one for tree fiddy. This stuff is nice. It's got a beautiful color, smell, and taste. It's really smooth and drinkable. I think it may be worth the $20 next time."
"This beer pours a deep, rich mahogany with a one finger beige head. It looks identical to the regular Arrogant Bastard. It smells of bitter citrus hops and has a light sweet maltiness to it. There is also a good and strong presence of oak, earthiness, and light smoke. It's definitely a slight upgrade to the AB. The flavors consist of mild hop bitterness to pair with a whole ton of earthiness followed by a nice and subtly sweet malt backbone. There's a lot of wood, dirt, tree bark going on yet in a pleasant manner. There are also light vanilla accents. It drinks exceptionally smooth and medium bodied. It leaves behind an appealing oaky/vanilla bitter hop flavor in the after taste. I find this to be much more appealing than the original AB. It has a lot more character. I wouldn't say it's necessarily easy to drink though. Like the AB, this one gets to be a little much after awhile. I couldn't drink more than one at a sitting. Solid beer though."
"D: I drank this pretty slowly because I was doing some work and 7.2% kinda requires you drink it slow, but even if I was free to get drunk, I'd probably need a serious break after 2 or 3 of this heavy brew. But just drinking one was fantastic."
"M/D) Full bodied beer. Very soft in the mouth. Before the finish, takes on an almost syrupy consistency. Very drinkable beer, but one that should be enjoyed once in a while, not an everyday session beer."
"It was great to compare this one with the normal Arrogant Bastard Ale"
"A little boozy and pricey for my taste, but a nice sipping beer. Easily available and decent tasting which are the strongest traits in this category but doubt I'd seek this out again."
"I'm sure I've had this before, but it's been a while, I think. I've never been all that impressed by any of the Bastards. But I used to drink my beers too cold, and maybe they were old or something? Whatever, I'm impressed now. This beer has an interesting malt forward start and a strong San Diego finish. Very good beer. Looking forward to my next one."
"D: The addition of the oak was a nice added dimension, but to be honest, I think I prefer the original version for its straight up hop assault."
"D: I doubt I'm going to finish this one, its my fault for jumping the gun though. I'll make sure to come back to this in a years time, as well as get a review for a fresh bottle as well."
"Notes: I enjoyed this, but just wasn't blown away by it. Pretty much what you would expect with a lot of caramel malt and a lot of hoppy bitterness. Not much oakiness comes out."
"Comments: There is a definite rustic cabin feel to this beer. I feel like I should be drinking it by the fire in the middle of the woods. Unfortunately the price point of $22/six pack is not inviting me back for more."
"Really a terrific beer, I think I prefer this to the regular AB, as it seems to be a bit more complex and less focused on just the hops"
"D. I actually prefer this one to the original (non-oaked) version and could drink it all night long without getting bored."
"Pours red with just enough light penetrating it that allows you to see through the glass. I took a sniff before swirling and got faint hop aroma and took another sniff after swirling and got a pineapple aroma which is kind of weird but I'm not complaining since I love pineapple. I'm not sure if this arrogant bastard was aged in oak because I'm not tasting any signs of it. Very smooth with no alcohol burn which is not surprising since the ABV is only 7.2% Very little hop presence with a sweet kick. I like this version of arrogant bastard better then the regular arrogant bastard since that just leaves me really thirsty."
"D - This is a fine brew. I love barrel aged beers. As I mentioned before, the hops are more subtle, but it is such a enjoyable experience."
"You definitely get what you pay for with Oaked -- it's well worth the price."
"I drank this alongside the regular arrogant bastard so that I could see how the oaking changed the flavour. Both brews had pretty much the same colour, a cloudy darkish brown colour. The oaked version had a smaller head (0.5 cm instead of 3 cm). The oaked ale has a weaker smell, I guess I lot of the hoppiness faded during the aging. That doesn't really leave that much smell, just some slightly spicy breadiness. The taste is pretty similar to the regular ale: a lovely bready hop flavour. The oaked version is a little drier with some extra woodiness. The aftertaste is slightly different; it's woody, musty and slightly metallic. It's still good, but I prefer it un-oaked."
"The mouthfeel is above average, but nothing spectacular. Pretty good offering from Stone, but given its price tag, I'll probably stick with the regular unless I'm in the mood for a treat."
"Seems very drinkable to me. The hops aren't overbearing and goes down very easily."
"Price = $2.99 at Whole Foods"
"Dee-lish."
"D- the first time I had this beer it was so woody I was barely able to drink it now after many years and many oak aged beers I can deal with this level of wood. That being said I think this one takes the cake as the woodiest brew I've had. The chips do a real number on this one. If your into wood this one is for you."
"It's a very good brew."
"Glass: snifter"
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Enjoy by date is 2/16/11. Pours a reddish brown with a sold inch of foam. Good lacing. Syrupy sweet malt on the nose. Notes of oak and vanilla are present as well. Very bourbon-like. Full bodied with little carbonation but not so syrupy as to detract much from the drinkability. Not much different from the original bastard until you describe the palate. The oak hits you up front and almost drowns out the nice malt that, in my opinion, makes the unoaked version so great. Not bad though. Just a different character. The hops still come through strong on the finish but not as quickly or aggressively as the original. The oak lingers with the hops through the finish so you are left with a honey sweetness with a touch of bitterness instead of a wave of palate searing hoppy resin. This gives it a cleaner feel, making it easier to drink. I like this more than I remember. Maybe as much as the original."
"This beer pours a very dark amber almost brown color, with a lacing tan head. The smell isnt the best, smells like a 2x4. The taste is very hopy, with a nice oaked flavor. Very harsh, and very powerfull. Overall I found this beer, amazing, in my top 10."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours a dark, semi clear reddish colour with a thin white creamy head. Aroma is nutty, oak, smoke and a bastard's wild oats. Astringent mouthfeel, noticeably strong but well integrated hop character. Raisins, caramel, black licorice and wood flavors. An enjoyable beer with interesting flavors spun off from the bigger brother."
"A helluva brew. Rich dark amber almost glowing brown color. Opaque and a tad hazy, looks like maple syrup in a beer glass, almost like a solid instead of a liquid. Very imposing. Good couple finger creamy froth head. The refined hoppy bitterness tastes like the traditional Arrogant Bastard Ale sans the Oak, but after some more tinkering to iron out the kinks. Thins out a bit after aspiration and hoppiness-to-mellow sweetness balance starts to shift towards sweetness. Citrusy notes of grapefruit rind are apparent, as is a mild caramely sweetness. Mid-range carbonation. Complex but patient and not overpowering mouthfeel, a little on the heavy side. No unduly lingering bitterness. In a word, a masterpiece!"
"Overall an exceptional beer that packs an incredible amount of taste into a 7.2% beer. As I tell friends, I am just barely worthy of this beer. I enjoy the hop overload, but the malt bill always throws me slightly. I do think that the oak chip aged version does mute some of the characteristics slightly making the overall taste more cohesive and less abrasive."
"The CPJ"
"D - Well I can see what the base was in lucky bastard! The oaking of this beer really takes it to the next level and makes me want to mix it with the regular Bastard. A very good bastard of a beer! BTW single was 3.75 but if I was able to get a sixer for under 15 bucks I would pick it up."
"D - All around very drinkable beer. Flavors are nicely balanced, nothing offensive, enjoyable without getting old quickly. First glass went down fast."
"Highly recommend!"
"D: Your one and only, Stone palate wrecker. I could do a few bottles though."
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer has an amazing appearance and smell. Great taste and complex flavors. Malt is brought out by the oak, but still a nice hop bite on the finish. There is a rich, creamy mouthfeel -- not unlike the taste you get from a beer on nitro tap. A very enjoyable beer to drink. Despite what other tasters say, I could drink these all day long."
"Hazy rust coloured beer, with a musty, slightly off smell. The smell is not hoppy, or malty, or even oak. More like mildew. Tastes of celery. A very dry taste, and not a lot of oak flavor. This finishes with full hop bitterness, but without a spice, or floral, or fruit taste that makes other hoppy ales so appealing. Nothing memorableon the tongue, and this has a very low drinkability for me due to the dry and mustyness of the beer. This has a good look and feel, but does not otherwise impress me. I would try it again, just to make sure I did not get one that had been mishandled, but otherwise would not seek it out. Overall I was pretty dissapointed after really loving Double Bastard."
"Poured on-tap at the Stone Brewery into a pint glass. The beer is a cloudy brown/amber color with no head. Smells are earthy, with hints of nut and wood aromas. Very well blended nose. Initial taste is a hop forward flavor, which is very well balanced with a malty-sweet and wood taste. The beer is round and full bodied in mouth, with a smooth, bitter finish. The beer also maintains the bitterness with a hoppy aftertaste. It was surprisingly easy to drink despite the bold flavors."
"While drinkability is better than the normal Gargoyle, I still can't see having more than one or two of these at a sitting."
"D- Its just not enjoyable for me. I understand this style is very hop focussed but this is just flat out hop domination. I can appreciate the strong hop aroma but the lack of balance has me wincing with each mouthful, crying out for a little malt sweetness. Not a style i can consider drinkable."
"D- This is a highly drinkable beer, the finish is not too bitter at all. This is a well blend of malty with not an over powering hop finish. I almost want to stand up and clap after drinking this beer."
"I'm on good terms with the Double Bastard, so I didn't expect this to be so different. I do not like molasses. I do not like the smell of molasses. This reminds me terribly of molasses. Fortunately, the alcohol content overpowers one's taste buds and the molasses taste fades. I got through it ok and recommended it to a friend that likes this type and he gave it a thumbs up."
"M/D/N Medium bodied and soft, with medium carbonation. Fills nice on the palate. I could see drinking plenty of this beer with no problem. Drinkability is good. Although doesnt warrant the high price tag at 18 dollars a six pack."
"What a huge disappointment. Not a bad beer, but I expected something great. I'll try it again, maybe from the bottle next time."
"Really full in body and maybe a little too oily, which would be my only off critique for this bastard."
"Pours a dark amber with huge foamy off-white head. Nose is obviously wood from the oak, mostly piney hops. Taste is earthy, the oak really comes through on the palatte, body is malty and barley, finishes with an aftertaste or bitter wood. Pretty heavily bodied, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. One of the better oak-aged beers I've tried. ABV sneaks up on you, so smooth and drinkable."
"Of the normal Arrogant Bastard, Oaked Arrogant Bastard, and Double Bastard (I have not tried Lukcy Basartd) I love the Oaked the best. I find it to add some great complexinty. Not all beers are better when oaked; I find oaked IPAs to be less delicious. However, Arrogant Bastard is a perfect beer to be oaked. Awesome."
"D- This is too damn good and I could drink this a long time and be a happy man. I think it may make me a little too arrogant with the 7.2%, however I don't think this beer would be as good if they didn't make it the way it is. They don't call it the Arrogant Bastard for nothing."
"D: Goes down dangerously easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style. This is a well balanced smooth beer that is worth enjoying a few pints of."
"D- Love the bastard and this just one ups it. The oak mellows it out a bit allowing the hops to shine. Really enjoyable."
"Mouth/Drink- Nice and full but not as sticky as you would expect, probably because of the excellent carbonation. This drinks better than most other big oaked beers I can think of, but it is still not something I would drink a bunch of in one sitting."
"D - This is very smooth beer that drinks easily. I will definitely pick this one up again."
"when i breathed in a snoot full of the aroma comming off of this beer i couldnt place it at first. after my first sip i realized what it was. the grapefruit flavor came through like a laser beam. the rich caramel color and sour bitterness make this beer very unique. i really appreciate the complexity of its flavor."
"Nice ruby-copper pour with a two finger off white head and great lacing. Very unique, complex, almost medicinal and spicy nose. Lots of sticky, resiny, pine up front with hints of oak, cinnamon, corriander, cloves and a touch of vanilla. The taste mirrors the smell with the bitter, piney hops the star. Just as spicy and complex as the smell with cinnamon, corriander and cloves all coming through. A subtle caramel malt sweetness balances out the bitterness quite nicely. This thing really mellows as it warms and becomes very smooth and drinkable. Another winner from Stone!"
"It was an aggressive beer, but not overpowering. I feel it went down easier than expected, which could be bad, but I haven't like most of Stone's Brew before, so this was a very splendid surprise. I'd highly recommend it."
"Pours dark pinkish ruby, mostly clear, with dense cream to tan colored head. Great head retention and lacing. Fruity hops aromas of citrus, tropical fruits - mango and grapefruit; sweet pine resins as well. Only hints of malt with some raisin and caramel notes. Bitterly hoppy, more on the resinous side with less citrus. Perhaps the hops have faded a bit? It can be hard to find fresh Stone on the East coast sometimes. A nice woody, earthy flavor from the oak, underlined with sweet malts. Medium bodied but lighter than expected with the combination of high malts/alcohol, lots of hops, and wood character."
"D-The folks at stone took an amazing beer and 1 up'd it.. congrats, an incredibly drinkable brew"
"Nice full mouthfeel but with a drying quality from the oak in the finish. Outstanding beer!"
"Very tasty beer; slightly odd and slightly rich at times. That makes it a beer not for every day, but still a tasty one."
"Great offering for the hop lover. Nice combination of flavors and fairly easy to drink. I like this a little better than the regular version."
"D-nice smooth drink with a decent ABV. This beer benefits from the aging process. Obviously not a party beer but goes well with dinner or a night in with friends"
"D/M: smooth drinking brew, great taste and unique finish helps the drinkability, slight carbonation tingle"
"Poured a hazy, deep mahogany with a finger of thick cream colored head. It looks the part of a pretty substantial beer. The hops come across in a fragrant, floral manner. There's also a hint of grapefruit along with a biscuity malt with a hint of spiciness. This spiciness (kind of a nutmeg/pumpkin combo) shows itself more in the taste. In the taste, the citrus is more of an orange intermingling with pine. You also get a woody, earthy twang on the back end. Maybe just a hint of vanilla as well. Pretty rich and creamy feel. The alcohol really doesn't show itself. I'm thoroughly impressed by this one."
"Drinkability: This is basically the same as Arrogant Bastard, however, the taste of the beer yields more of a balanced flavor profile than it's inspiration. Just as drinkable as AB, but a bit more savory."
"D: Awesome, glad it comes in a six pack though"
"Overall, a great beer."
"Drinkability is good up until I finish the glass, at that point I feel very content but can no longer continue."
"This is one of my favorite beers ever. It is fantastic. The non-oaked version is also fantastic. DEFINITELY recommended, but you have to like a strong beer which is damn bitter. Otherwise, this isn't the beer for you."
"This beer is not for everyone. If you want a friendly amber or smooth golden ale, do not try it. If you want a big strong ale, grab a sixer, and enjoy!"
"This is a delicious beer, and drinkability is not a problem as long as you stick to one or a couple."
"Drinkability: This is a potent brew - very strong in flavor but enjoyable. Went well with Chili and cornbread, and I could see myself having this alone. The higher alcohol is well hidden making this beer a bit dangerous, but with such strong flavors, I'm enjoying it, but my tastebuds need a rest after one. I could see myself finishing off a larger glass though..."
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky,hazy, rust copper color with a thin head. Some lacing. Sweet aroma of oak, hops, and a bit of citrus. Flavor is a great blast of hoppy oak. Great bite to it. An aftertaste of more oak. Certainly drinkable and delicious. Overall Stone improved on an already great beer. Well done."
"First off wow i didnt think stone could make something as good as the arrogant bastard any better but i was plesently suprised. Pours out a dark amber color with great head and lacing, very sticky! Smells smoky with alcohol notes and estery tones. After one sip i was in love, the oak chips really bring out a whole new perspective to this beer which should be welcomed with gusto. If you like stone brew co and love your tounge to be bitch slapped this is a beer for you! Only gripe is it is quite expensive 17.99 per six pack but i guess you are paying for quality here."
"This beer really lives up to the name... it's so complex and delightful that it's hard to describe with anything other than a well-done kitchen sink of dark ale... smells of alcohol/chocolate/fig/cinnamon... and bites so chewy that I have lock-jaw.. the hops are booming in their presence here and this beer is big, bold, and beee-u-ti-ful! Love this beer...the floral herbal hops are lip-puckering yet its dry and sweet to balance and incredibly drinkable at this weight. Awesome brew"
"But oh wait - Stone brewed this?! Damn guys. Good job."
"D: Wouldn't want more than 1 in a sitting but it was still quite enjoyable."
"D- Goes down easy, for a buck fiddy its hard to beat, a bunch of places around me sell it for 16.99 a 6 pack"
"D-I have to qualify this. I think it's a fantastic beer fresh. The bottle I have is nearly a year old. I've been curious to try it with a little bit of age, and I think what this bottle suggests is promising. Highly recommended, whether it be fresh or a vintage bottle."
"A very big, tasty ale. In a way I think it is a little too big, with the flavours clashing and overwhelming rather than complementing each other. This said, it's not as if the brewery positions the beer as anything but an aggressive beer and on that count it delivers, big time!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, deep red color with a nice frothy head. The aroma was big on the hops with a hint of sweetness. Taste is predominantly hoppy with a rye-IPA like finish. Hint of intermittent malty flavor with nice lacing along the glass. Solid on the hops and definitely tastes better as it warms. An absolute ""in your face"" beer, extremely potent. Worth a try, drinkablility is good, but I am sure I can't have more than two of these in a sitting."
"Attractive aroma. A sour, vinegar like smell. Nice bodied appearance, but very thin on the palate, watery. The flavor is thin too. A slight bitter, then oak with a malty finish. The poor balance is what turns me off. The different aspects of beer are not working in harmony."
"Drinkabilty - This is very nice. Enjoyed the oaked flavor. Its strong enough that 2-3 is enough. Would be great to drink with a steak. If you like arrogant bastard but isnt quite fullfilling enough for you, then this beer might be your ticket"
"All in all, this is just as impressive as fresh, albeit in a completely different direction. Must try fresh, and if you have the time and space, a must try with some age on it as well."
"This is heads above standard arrogant bastard, and each year when this one comes out I make sure to pick up a few bottles. The flavors are so rich and blend together so well that it disappears way too quick."
"The taste is perfectly described in the title bastard with a beautiful oak taste it isn't over powering and doesn't take over the bastard taste we know and love"
"D: One bottle was enough for me."
"D - This is simply a great beer and I can certainly enjoy more than one!"
"D- Amazing. Crisp, clean, bitter, delicious. I love how the complexity seamlessly interacts from mouthfeel, aroma, taste, to finish. Drink it slow, let it warm a bit and note the transformation along the way."
"12 ounce bottle. Although seemingly expensive for a six pack, this one is actually less per ounce than the AB bombers. Poured a hazy dark brown color with a big, frothy tan head. Aromas of toasted oak, juicy hops and sweet malt. On the palate, medium bodied, citrus-y hops, light oak, caramel. The oak really works well with this beer."
"D-Easily drinkable...and likely one after the other without difficulty."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down really easy. Its rather smooth considering the style and alcohol content. I really like this beer, and I will be picking up more for sure. Good job Stone. Cheers."
"D - Very enjoyable strong ale. Very complex yet smooth with abv not felt at all. I highly recommend it."
"D - Very good beer with a good strong ABV. I would definitely have more if Stone was readily available in MO."
"Drink- It's a very good beer. Could have a few during a sitting & @ 7.2 would make the night a lot more fun too. Would like to have the next one paired to really highlight a cuisine."
"if you read the label on this beer it explains it fully. stone makes some good beer"
"D: Overall a very nice beer. Lots going on here. I'm curious what this one tastes like when fresh. The bitterness would hinder me from enjoying more than 12oz."
"drinkability - the mouthfeel of this leads it to be a one and done proposition"
"Pours a semi light hazy brown colour. A very bold malt taste up front with a little sweetness of citrus and hops on the finish, and the oak was very subtle. The the little sweetness touch on the end of each taste was very refreshing. It took me a few sips to appriciate this beer fully, and I was sad when the pint glass was empty. Damn tasty beer, very easy to drink."
"Overall, this was an excellent beer. What I wish I had done, was to compare the oaked and the regular beers side by side. That way I could really pick up the differences. This will definately be a beer that I will come back to."
"A very drinkable ale, the aging on toasted oak chips imparts Arrogant bastard with additional subtle complexity."
"D- A good beer from Stone. I prefer regular Arrogant Bastard because it is cheaper and just as good. Worth trying and will have it again, but not on a regular basis."
"Very complex nose on this one. The oak seems to bring out the pine and hide the citrus in the nose. The oak is defiantly there but doesn't overpower the rest of the beer. It adds complexity without making it too dry."
"D - Bought a six pack and will be happy to finish the lot. A big beer with big flavors, ABV reasonable enough to have a few."
"D- This beer is good, but I was hoping something a little bit more in the flavor department. I don't know maybe it needs to grow on me a little more."
"Mostly smooth and a bit creamy feel to the beer. The carbonation is quite delicate but very pleasant. The beer is drinkable for the style. You might tip over after a few though. This is probably my favourite American Strong Ale to date."
"Well done, Stone. Well done."
"Tasted on 25 October 2010, bottle says ""Enjoy by 12 20 10"" 12oz bottle, poured into Sam Adams Summer Ale glass, two-finger beige head that looked spongy as it faded, lacing covers 40% of the glass. The color is a glorious clear brown-red with a touch of orange when held up to the light, much like a red ale, but way more legendary. The aroma is light in hops, light in oak, but the headturner here was the tropical fruits I smelled: guava and starfruit. They were surprising to me, and took me about 3 straight minutes of smelling to narrow down specific fruit smells. I'm not experienced enough to know if this tropical smell comes from fruits or hops, but it is definitely what I'm smelling. I don't taste the fruits, but I taste bitter hops with a little oak, and a small sting on the tongue from the carbonation. This beer sticks slightly on the mouth. This does not taste like a 7.2% beer, and I would definitely consider this a session beer for myself, so excuse me while I crack open bottle #2."
"Full of flavor, and yet not too high on the ABV; I would take Stone's bastards any day over mediocre barleywines. Not too oaky or woody, but still very good. I have rated this exactly same as regular Arrogant Bastard. If I went looking for woody flavors, I would seek Dogfish Head's Palo Santo Marron."
"Excellent beer! Got this at their brewpub last night. Poured with a huge, light tan, foamy, frothy, sudsy, head that lasts a long time, lots of lace, and some small bubble trails. Color is a lovely, clear medium amber. Aroma is a very nice blend of malt, hop, and yeast. Flavor has lots more depth: the malt, hop, yeast; plus, nutmeg, allspice, oak, dark ripe fruit and a hint of roastiness. Body is very good with great carbonation. Finish is like flavor, but tapers quickly and has a bit of alcohol at the end."
"Either way, it's as good as the regular version. A little bit different, but not that much. I wish I could say I really tasted the difference the oak made, but I don't think I can make that claim."
"The oak only goes so far to round this beer out, and it is still a bastard to drink."
"D: Good but I was hoping for a bit more balance. The smell seems up be up front malt, and the taste seems to be all hops. The oak seems to get lost in this as well."
"D- I really really like this beer if this was all I was going to drink all night that would be fine. But if you are going to have many different beers put this beer as one of the last ones you will try, cause it is overpowering my taste buds. Good beer."
"D: One of these is enough for me. Delicious but it wears down the palate."
"D- Easy to down, but it's one that you want to savor. I found that the first I had was the best, as the oak flavor was so new and vibrant. Maybe it fades with time, or maybe it was just something that you can only be blown away by once. Still very enjoyable, and very well crafted. Lives up to the arrogance on the bottle."
"mouthfeel is surprisingly a hair on the thin side, but not deal-breakingly so; moderate carbonation. relatively high marks for drinkability, though in the final analysis i'm not sure i'd put this above (or even equal to) the regular arrogant bastard. still, an enjoyable beer well worth a try."
"Pours a deep red almost brown color with an off white head. A hop, alcohol, sweetness scent. This beer has all the charaters of the oringal bastard the strong grapefruit flavor, hop bite but it is slightly enriched but the hint of oakness at the end."
"Drinkability -- The only thing stopping me from drinking this on a regular basis is the price tag. Phenomenal beer, a step up from standard-issue Bastard. Would *love* to see this in bomber form."
"Though I wish the oak came out in the flavors themselves, it was definitely nothing but a compliment to an already great beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"What can one say? Stone continues to impress. One of the best things I've had in months."
"Great beer, one of my favorites from stone. I prefer this to the regular, the Oaked aged AB is much smoother drinking and mellow than the regular. Highly recommended."
"D - This can age well. Still doing good 'past it's prime', it's a fantastic beer with great balance and a nice finish. For how much goes into the beer ingredient-wise, it's very drinkable. The arrogance is deserved here."
"Mild carbonation. mild alcohol in the background, though it is not as present as you'd expect. An exceptional brew indeed."
"Is it a Belgian ale? No, but the smell makes one think so. It is similar, but much more bitter."
"D - This beer has an interesting character that becomes quite complex in the finish and aftertaste. There are some nice, barleywine like notes from the interaction of the significant hop character with the dark malts and the lingering tobacco/smoke flavors are quite nice. My only complaint is that the oak character is quite subtle, when it seems like the beer would have held up to a much more intense oak character. I get a some oak in the aroma as the beer warms, but there is little woody taste. This is a shame because a stronger oak character would have worked nicely with the darkness of the finish and could have mitigated the slightly harsh bitterness that coats the palate. A very good beer, but it could be a really great beer with a little tweaking."
"D-Very easy drinking and complex; the oak really balances the bitterness."
"This beer pours a cloudy, dark copper color with no head. The aroma is toast, molasses, raisins, and alcohol. It's flavor has notes of toast, vanilla, licorice, and brandy. The brandy taste takes over and at the same time there is a strong bitterness that gets stronger the more you drink it. It also has a nasty, bitter aftertaste. Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale is way too strong to be good and is not recommended!"
"Drinkable- I figure something called ""Arrogant Bastard' is a bit beyond drinkable but in fact Stone really watched the details and rather than load up for an over the top bomb,went for interacting elements and having no real weak area. It's not a lightweight--or econo,so it's no 5 in the drinkable but it does well for what it is."
"Oaked Bastard is a dark shaded brown with some redness if you look towards the light. A nice cream/tannish foam up above with tightness and stickiness on the glass. Smells fairly oaky, I remember it being extreme in the past. Infact with more sniffs it comes out a bunch. Under that a strong ale presence with a bunch of caramel and some alcohol with dark fruit and nuts. Tasting this from a fresh keg keeps up stone's rep for me. I don't buy their beer often but when I do, I know I will at least like it. Oak, wood, caramel, toasted malt out the ying yang, almonds, vanilla, and some nice citrusy hops to top it off. Feel is above medium with a solid structure, some alcohol as well but not much, carbed up nice. A nice Oaked beer that is readily available, i'll need to revisit a bottle to see how that goes, but this tap version is nice."
"This beer pours with a deep amber color, not to dissimilar to a darker IPA. Wonderful head retention. The foam sticks to the glass as it goes down and looks beautiful. The front end of this beer is full of caramel notes and a slight nuttiness which gives way to a stellar hop finish. The finish is where the oaky-ness really shines. It stays in your mouth minutes after you've set the glass down. A shining example of an American Strong Ale"
"As good as the on-tap version, maybe even better."
"D: The overall taste is really great, but the amount of ABV that this brew packs is not masked well with the taste, there is a strong booze note in the body that slightly brings this rating down. Although a stellar beer, this one is"
"Verdict: This Bastard's Grown Up!"
"The bitterness will be appreciated by IPA/IBU lovers. It's good but you might be better served by a good 'ol bomber of the genitor beer."
"For me, this is far, far more drinkable than the regular Bastard. The oak chips have mellowed the bitterness to a point where it's actually tolerable and I can fully enjoy the complexity of the beer without being overwhelmed. An infinitely more pleasant American Strong Ale experience."
"Conclusion: I have never had original AB, and have never had Oaked AB fresh. This bottle is very good as it is, and I imagine that it would be very good fresh as well. I have never liked Stone brewery, but can't help liking their beers as every one I try is well crafted and tasty."
"D - Absolutely a delight to drink. Thank you Stone Brewing for this homage to ales!"
"D: I started drinking this beer with mediocre expectations, but it ended up being pretty good. I wouldn't want to drink several of these in a night, but would be happy to have it again sometime. Although, it is pretty expensive for a six pack."
"D - I find this beer quite enjoyable but I am not sure if more than one would be in order."
"D- Complex brew, big beer. Its got the looks and the taste. I'm not a fan of oaked beers really so I won't be returning to this one."
"A very good brew I would have in the middle of a tasting group. It's strong enough to burn out the pallet for white ales, but won't do any damage on the way to an IPA or very malty Stout as a nightcap. Perfect middle of the progression beer. I'd suggest it as a session beer were the price tag a bit smaller. Still worth every penny though."
"D - Quite drinkable, especially with the plate of BBQ I had for lunch. I'll seek this pairing out again!"
"A very good beer. The oak aging has really toned down the bitterness from the regular, non-oaked version."
"Bottle. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a tan head, actually looks really good in my opinion. Good lace. Malty oak nose with a slight hops aroma. Sweet earthy upfront flavor with a more than expected hop bitterness presence at the end. Medium mouthfeel. Another solid beer from Stone."
"A little undercarbonated for my taste, but the medium body of this beer is spot on for the style. Surprisingly drinkable, especially for me considering I have often been overwhelmed by the mounting bitterness of some of the Stone offerings."
"this is an aggressive ale, you probably won't like it unless you truly know what a very good ale should taste like -"
"Heavy body. Good linger."
"D: I don't see myself drinking a lot of these because I'm not a big fan of the style. Put that aside, it's a great beer for its style, couldn't drink it alone."
"D-not too shabby, a lot of the complexity slowly fades but the oakness stays very well!"
"For some this may be a hard chore to finish, but I pounded mine, almost accidentally. It was about 6 mo old so the hops and alcohol may have been muted compared to fresh off the press examples. Honestly, my favorite Stone beer I have ever had as their usual beers are way too Pacific coast hopped and ruin my palate, but this one, I will re-visit and that is a first for me and Stone."
"22oz bomber"
"MF/D: a simple buzz of carbonation teases the mouth with various cacophony of flavors leaving the tastebuds aching for more. a clear step up from the arrogant bastard."
"Because of the amount of bitterness in this beer, it is very drinkable. Quite refreshing I might add. Palate cleansing. Very drinkable!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I would recommend this to the hopheads out there."
"D - Much smoother and easier to drink than the regular bastard. With the abv the same, I could easily pick this one over the other anyday."
"D - I could drink these all night, probably even easier to drink than the regular. Of course you probably won't like it... at least that's what the bottle says."
"D: I always want to route for this beer (as I do many of Stones IPA and ""Strong Ales""), but every time drink this brew, I notice the same unpleasantness time and time again. I'm sure others with disagree and that's fine, but this beer just doesn't do it for me."
"D- A nice change but one is enough"
"Overall, a good but not great beer for me. I'll stick to the regular Bastard. Will need to re-try just to make sure I didn't have a bad one. Avail here in TX. Rotation - one re-sample to make sure but probably one is enough [RS;O]"
"Oooh, vanilla and oak flavors really smooth this bastard out. Nice. Plenty of both malt and hops, the former being a bit sweet and very much burnt caramel. Hops are subdued pine resin flavors and a healthy dose of pithy bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and coats the mouth easily with oaky goodness. I really have never seen the great appeal for the original Arrogant Bastard, but the 'Oaked' version stands out as a pretty damn good beer. The flavors seem to come together much better and does not show the same roughness as the unoaked version. This one is pretty smooth and tasty. I bought this as a single, but now I think I will spring the 14 bucks for a sixer and see how it progresses over a year or two in the cellar."
"I like this beer, but I wouldn't put it with my cluster of this years favorites."
"Not the first time I've had this beer, but I bought it again just so I could review it."
"D_Decent brew. Definitely better than the regular. But with the huge amount of oak its a definite sipper. One bottle is hard enough to get through."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle and decided to use a chalice. Pours a clear dark ruby with a creamy off-white head with great retention and lacing. Upon first smell I thought it was reminiscent of the regular Arrogant Bastard. Very citrusy, almost pineapple hops. As it warmed you do get more of an earthy smell, presumably the oak or wood with some nut and dry malt. Taste was more like a subtle version of the regular. You have the caramel, sweet backbone with the citrusy hops but overall a slightly dulled twist. Somewhat nutty I almost think. Mouthfeel was fuller and velvety, very pleasant. Overall a great beer from Stone though I think I prefer the regular version better."
"Atmosphere is great. Tall, dark, and handsome appearance. Nose is a really good balance of components.... sweet, spice, malt, hops, and woodiness. Flavor is bitter and hoppy with a nice subtle sweet balance. Thick and robust. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D- Ok, a little too intense from the hops and abv for a great drinkability, though well worth it for a taste."
"Though this beer is certainly hop forward the oak has helped dull the sharper edges to create a more well rounded, yet classically American ale. The mouthfeel is full, rich and fitting of the brew. All in all a dangerously drinkable and enjoyable beer. Another winner from Stone."
"An interesting beer, especially as I haven't had Arrogant Bastard before. A nice way to finish off the evening."
"M/D: Medium bodied and coats your palate. I find this beer to be quite drinkable, almost dangerously so. Overall I quite enjoy it, and find the caramel/vanilla combination to be quite nice."
"D - This is a phenomenal beer from Stone. I'm impressed with just about everything they put out and this is no exception. It seems like I taste something new with every sip. Recommended."
"D: It's going to be a bit of a chore to get through more than one bottle, it's certainly not a session beer, but that's not to the detriment of the entire experience, it's just a fact of the matter. It's a very full-bodied beer, especially at 7% ABV, and it should be respected and perhaps even feared. This one has more flavor, body, and character than even Double Bastard. It's excellent."
"DB- The dreaded $17 six-pack, or at least thats what I thought a year ago. That price seems perfectly reasonable now, a well rounded, fulfilling flavor. The hops are the only flaw to me here, but a very small one. The wood and malt are so nice. After some thought, great Strong Ale/Old/Barleywine flavors captured in smooth, drinkable beer."
"Brown opaque with small lasting head. Aroma of smoked oak, pepper, leafy hops and vegetables. Taste is very woody and plenty of hops. Damn, so much oak. Great palate, Stone-like. This one was a little too much for me but I can say it was interesting to taste."
"goes down well. a bit harsh, but complex enough to remain pleasant. seems a bit boozier than it is."
"This isn't awful, but i much prefer stones stouts, or IPAs."
"Very good but don't really see what the oak brings other than a tongue depressor finish. I'm not even sure I'd know this was oaked if it wasn't stamped on the bottle. I'd have to try both versions side by side."
"My typical preference for hoppy beers is to be light in mouthfeel, and Arrogant Bastard fits that bill. It has moderate-to-high carbonation and is light enough to not punish my tastebuds under all of that malt. Drinkability? Absolutely! This is a damn solid, hoppy beer that I would get down with anytime. I would probably buy this with some regularity if I could."
"D: Probably not more than 1 of these per sitting for me, long finish kinda sticks around"
"[ serving type: Chilled bottle poured into a glass]"
"Nice full palate. The hops these guys use are awesome - wish I could get my hands on some myself."
"Overall this is one of my all time favorite beers, though for the money, drinking it ALL the time will get expensive."
"creamy off white head, check. lovely amber hues and shades of reddish brown, check. first sniff loaded with hops, only lasting a fleeting moment until the other aromas of vanilla and maple syrup take over. this i assume must be from the oak aging, which also adds quite a nice bit of depth and complexity to the taste. sweet and savory flavors on the first sip are in juxtapose with a crushing lingering bitterness that creeps up quickly to balance out the alcohol and nutty profile of the malts. my bottle was one month past the drink y date and still very nice. would eventually like to try a fresh bottle to compare. this handles like a real beer. its solid, fun, and ripping with good qualities."
"D: This is a wonderful strong ale. Easy to drink despite the higher ABV."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable, the oak characteristics really add to the flavor of this beer. Excellent brew from Stone."
"This oaked Arrogant Bastard bottle is one that I have aged for 2 years and decided now was the time to have it. This beer is in fine condition, but I don't think aging did it any favors. The smell is definitely melanoidin dominated with woody, earthy contribution from oak. The taste was pronounced caramel and toasted grain with a bracing bitter finish complementing the sweetness. The oak comes through in the aftertaste providing some tannins and herbal bite. I need to try this beer fresh, to better sample the hop quality."
"Overall, a decent improvement from regular AB and definitely a solid example of how oak can be used to accentuate, rather than overpower a beer."
"Dark ruby brown pour with a small dense tan head. Mellow grapefruit and vanilla aroma with hints of dark fruit. Malty vanilla and oak flavor up front, slightly nutty flavor in the middle, little bit of honey, leading to a dry and bitter finish. Medium body."
"pours a opaque brown color with spare off white head, good lacing, and lively carbonation. caramel malty smell same sweetness follows through in the taste. bornt wood flavor, strong bitter harsh hops with lots of bite, and caramel hints. oak bitter finish. long flavor duration, and a medium body. slick sticky texture. abosolutely amazing brew. has a bit of a heavy complexity to itbut goes down so smooth. definitely for the more advanced palate. probably just pushed it way into my top three favorite beers."
"Incredibly hoppy but if you're into that, you'd be able to do a couple of these. A bit on the strong side, but not too strong. A must-try for hopheads, and probably worth a try for others too."
"D- Much easier to drink than the regular Arrogant Bastard because it is not nearly as viscous and has a nice dry oaky finish."
"Drinkability-Scarily drinkable, the oak smooths everything out so well that I can see why Stone sells these in sixes; I can go through a sixer in a day no problem."
"As a big fan of regular Arrogant Bastard, I looked forward to trying this iteration and it did not disappoint. It has all the elements that i loved in AB but manages to add additional complexity. I could drink this stuff all night without getting sick of it; the flavors are that good (plus it hides its alcohol really well under all of the complexities)."
"D: Pretty solid on the drinkability scale; preferred to AB; only downside is probably the price per bottle (17.49 for a 6er)"
"Pours a brownish with a red tint. smell is bold of hops, malts and a nice woodiness.(smells like this beer was brewed in a smoker). Tastes like a smoother arrogant bastard with a nice woodiness.Mouthfeel is great medium bodied and crisp,love my ABA. Drinkability is through the roof this is an exceptional beer,my only wish is i had had this on tap!!"
"D- hides the ABV well. The bitterness and lack of anything aside from the oak flavor could be offputting, but whatever."
"Tastes like an oak aged ipa."
"Overall- This is a unique beer and I always enjoy drinking it despite not being worthy. I love how aggressive yet drinkable it is. It's such a great beer and deserves to be Stone's flagship beer. I know they are different beers but I have the same feelings about this beer as I do about DFH 60 Minute. 60 minute is more malty and roasty while AB has a hoppier taste they both are unique beers loaded with malts and hops and highly drinkable."
"Hmmm, I really can't decide if I like this better than a regular AB. The oak certainly adds a new dimension to the taste but at times comes up a little too much. It definitely dries out the finish a bit more and it's nice to get the wood flavor subtly throughout rather than just in the aftertaste. I guess it just depends on if I'm in the mood for a little wood..."
"Too much for a full serving. As a 4oz sample, this bier is ASTOUNDING. Undrinkable after about 6 oz."
"Drinkability is decent, a little muddled to be honest."
"D- interesting, and i'm glad i picked this one up. i was blown away with the originL arrogant when i was a novice because i've never had such a beer. now, a little more evolved, i can find flaws, however small, namely so much oak. still an amazing brew, but i'm one and done. i know it takes alot of oak to stand out againt the hop gargoyle, but for me it's just too much."
"D - This was a really great tasting beer. It is so good in so many ways. It is nice to try a 'hyped"" beer that really delivers."
"This is a whole different ball of wax to the non-oaked version that I had on tap. I'm shocked at how the oak makes the difference."
"D - First off, wow what a beer! This was an out of bounds treat for me, I wouldn't be able to drink more that two of these I think, the earthy flavors & bitterness are very strong. I would love to sip on this beer in the cold winter season with an open fire, and I'll definitely buy this one again. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys just about every style of beer. Cheers!"
"d: Mouthfeel suggests a quaff-able beer but taste suggests something you should take your time with. Very aggressive beer. Love it but not something i could drink more than 2 of."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable; alcohol is well masked; extremely drinkable, almost chuggable, actually"
"Verdict: Unsurprisingly, Oaked Arrogant Bastard ends up being the same old Arrogant Bastard we know and love with oaky and vanilla-like notes mixed in. Given a choice between the two, I'd always opt for this version."
"D: One of my favorite beers, with a flavor demanding moderation"
"great beer fresh, even better with age."
"Year old 12oz bottle. Pours an amber/brown with a small head. I don't care much for the look. Nose is fresh flowers, oak, brown sugar, and alcohol. Taste is dominated by oak, which leaves a lasting bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very nice, medium with perfect carbonation."
"Enjoyable, but not a beer I could drink all night, or on a regular basis, just a little to 'in your face' for me."
"D - Very drinkable for a hoppy beer. Seems a bit more toned down than arrogant bastard which is a bit too in your face for me."
"A pretty easy drinking beer for something of this style. The Oak adds another element and rounds out some edges. Terrific."
"Tastes like one oaky bastard. Would love to try the dry hopped."
"D- A strong ale with an intense bitterness. One and done for me but I like it very much."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a little warming, very drinkable due to delicious-ness."
"D. Lightly carbonated yet still a smooth drinking ale. Yet another excellent ale from Stone who are rapidly becoming my favourite American brewer. Good stuff indeed."
"D-- Excellent beer for colder nights. Have had fresh Arrogant Bastard before and it is exceptional. Oak Aged is excellent. Fresher would only enhance the other flavors and possibly bring out more but this at a year old is very good. The Oak taste and feel makes this exceptional. The ABV is a bit more obvious in this but that might be more the age and Oak. Still could drink 2 before feeling the bite of this."
"Summary: Really excellent ale from Stone. I've had the arrogant bastard before, but the oak aging takes it to a new level."
"D: I could easily drink a bomber of this, but after that i would probably prefer to mix it up with something else. The hops are intense and delicious, but the bitterness yearns for something more soothing afterward. like a cuddle."
"D- Pretty good, I dont know if I'd choose to drink it all night, but I was definitely wishing I had a bomber and not just a 12oz bottle."
"Overall a good beer, very enjoyable."
"D - The beer's only weakness, one is enough."
"Mouthfeel - Creamy rich goodness. Medium in body with a nice tooth. I find myself chewing it like a toffee."
"Overall, amazing beer. I like this better than the straight Arrogant Bastard; which I loved to begin with. Very intricate flavors come through at different times that really leave you pleased as a drinker. There isn't anything more that this beer could really offer."
"Poured from the bottle into my Brooklyn snifter. Dark amber color, almost brown. Quick surge of carbonation formed a nice white head. Smell was good, but I was expecting a bit more of a wood-aged note. Not quite as pronounced as I was hoping for. Taste was pretty stellar though. A nice hit of malt up front, then you can taste some of that oak on your palate, and it leaves you with a bite of hops at the end. I tasted just a bit of cinnamon with this beer, and also some peat smoke. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel was on the dry side, but smooth. Would have guessed the abv to be somewhat higher. This is a unique beer with just as a unique flavor, so a single bottle was a nice introduction. A great offering from Stone that shows what wood aging can do to a beer, but doesn't take it to overkill levels."
"Libation: For such a hop/flavor forward beer, this is very well balanced and goes down extremely easy. Given the ease of drinkability and the undetectable 7.2% ABV Oaked AB can be dangerous if you've picked up a sixer."
"Oaked Bastard is my favorite of the three. It has a little more complexity than the regular AB, but is not quite as rough around the edges as the Double Bastard. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Hops and malt are in good balance and the beer is light enough so that you can put back a few of these."
"Slightly dry mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Easy to sip, but the tartness of the finish helps to slow you down. More complex and rewarding than the regular Arrogant Bastard."
"D: A hefty mother of a beer, fills you up nicely, very satisfying but the dryness of the oak & hops left me thirsty"
"All in all still solid, I just prefer the regular AB or double Bastard to this, but an interesting twist none the less. I think adding the oak compromises too much of the other taste."
"Poured out a dark amber beer with 2 inch head, medium carbonation.Smells very good , very balanced sweet with a ton o hops of course. Taste is excellent. Slightly sweet malt with a slight vanilla type twang, strong hops but not overboard.Has a slick mouthfeel very nice. Very drinkable, probably not more then one at a time"
"Oaked Arrogant Bastard actually used to be my favorite beer. I still love it, but various things about the flavor don't always mesh with me. That said, I love the balance of flavors, and there's an amazing amount going on. Also, like its non-oak-aged older brother, it's one of those few beers that I've literally never tasted anything like."
"D: Stronger than AB with a heavier body. The oaked flavors add a nice touch to the flavor but I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't say better than AB, just a bit different. Great beer none the less."
"D: I've never had a normal Arrogant Bastard Ale, although after this I definitely need to try the two side by side. The smokey flavor from the oak chips really helps to segue between the mild fruitiness at the front and the intense hop bitterness at the end. I think I could do a six pack of these, but that 7.2% will sneak up on you in a hurry."
"Highly recommended!"
"An excellent beer, and one which is surprisingly drinkable for its strength, depth and aggression. It has actually been some time since I sampled the plain Arrogant Bastard (if you can ever really use that description of it), so it's hard to compare it to the original, but this has such depth, such fullness of character, and such robust arrogance, that it stands by itself as a stellar and wonderful example of the American brewer's craft."
"Man, what a letdown. I am a big fan of Arrogant Bastard, but this doesn't do it justice. It tastes over-oaked, almost fake. The appearance and aroma were really promising but it really went downhill from there."
"D - The big malts, pine hops and oak aging make this one robust, earthy brew. Well balanced, easy going down, this was a pleasure to drink, and I prefer this oaked version significantly more than the standard Bastard."
"Served in a Stone pint glass, it appears a ruby red amber color, very clear with a finger of yellowish foam for a head. Very good retension and a solid amount of lace all around the glassware. Aroma is bright citrus hops with a backing of wood/oak earthiness. Taste is inline with what the aroma led on. When compared to the bottled version this on tap almost seemingly is an exaggerated oak flavor that boarders being unnatural. Bitter oily hops upfront with alcohol warmth gives way to malt and oakiness flavors through the medium body to again oily bitter hop finish. Moderately carbonated with hops and oak left lingering in the mouth. Dare I say this bastard on draft is even more arrogant than the bottled version...excellent."
"D- ABV too high for major drinkability. The mouthfeel makes it more of a nightcap than anything else."
"Sometimes i am surprised at how much Flavor a brewer can get out of a certain process, and this is one of them. there is soooo much oak in both the nose and flavor of this one it's crazy. Aside from the Oaky wood there is some sweet caramel malt flavors and a light hop addition. a rather sticky mouth feel with light to medium carbination. very solid beer that i could have one now and then and keep stocked for the occasion, but probally not have alot in a row."
"It's a good thing I was driving because I wouldn't have stopped at one. Definitely going to have this again!"
"Poured into a pint glass, amber with creamy head with great retention and lacing. Smell was toasty and malty sweetness then piney and oiily hops. Taste was of big caramel malts up front, then earthy hops smoothed by the oak aging. Dry smooth finish from the wood. Fantastic beer, one of my go-tos."
"D- easy to drink and a nice change of pace from the original bastard, but i think the original one edges this one out. even more so when the price point comes into play."
"Was very excited to try this beer, after reading all of the reviews and reading about it in Naked Pint. Appearance: reddish, really no head to speak of, little lacing. Smell: grapefruity hops and wood. Taste: hops is the most prominent taste but as it goes down, there's some dark fruit maybe and yes, a hint of mint. I let this one warm up a little. So glad I did; it grows with complexity as you continue to sample it and drink it at room temperature. It's truly delicious but the slight bitter after taste will keep me from actively seeking this one out again."
"Oak is mostly in the nose though some vanillin is preent in the flavor. To me just as good as regular arogant bastard, which I could interchange frequently without regret."
"Overall, this is very good...but not enough to make me want to throw down a prayer rug in the direction of San Diego County. For me there are still better beers to be had for less money."
"Last but not least, the drinkability is quite good. The abv is up over 7% but you wouldn't know. The other flavors eat up the alcohol. I probably couldn't drink more than 3 in a session without getting sick of it, but I'd enjoy the hell out of those three."
"D - Good drinkability, but I can't see myself having more than 2 or 3 in a night. Too strong to enjoy past one or two. Complex enough to get time after time though."
"Drinkability: I liked the beer, but I don't think I could have too many of these. The tannins in this one are a bit much."
"D: This stuff is extremely strong. I'm glad I only got a small bottle!"
"D - This was one different and very enjoyable. I would buy this again and would love to try it fresh on tap."
"The taste is very nice: The hop bitterness beautifully complements a spicy and slightly peppery old oak taste. The malty sweet backbone shines through along with the actual hop flavours of thick citrus fruits. Medium-bodied and appropriately carbonated, OABA is wonderfully drinkable."
"D - I found this to be very drinkable. The smokiness of it started off as a problem but as it warmed, really blended well with everything else."
"Taste is very very good. Grapefruit, pine, and citrus hop flavors are balanced by some vanilla and caramel. Just a great flavor for a strong ale. Not too overpowering, so it's also very drinkable. I had high hopes for this one, and it didn't disappoint at all."
"I like this more than the standard Arrogant Bastard. Pours a Brownish red with some copper tones and foamy cream colored head. The nose is filled citrus, vanilla, grapefruit and red fruit. Hoppy aromas with a nice touch of oak. The malts and hops intermingle with notes of grapefruit and red berries. The oak nicely balances the hops"
"Damn. I wish had access to this."
"Never had the non-oaked variety of Arrogant Bastard, but I want to try it. Good stuff, my friends."
"Pours translucent ruby brown, good tan head. Smell is earthy malts, a bit of must; in fact, with nice sweet notes. First taste is a sheet of (one-dimensional) hops that turns into the customary AB fruity, butterscotchy, malty thing, followed by a super-dry finish that I can only liken to ""sucking on a wood chip."" Not my thing, but I'm glad I tried it once."
"I would happily drink this all the time. I guess my only criticism is that this thing is $3.75 for a 12oz. I would love to add it to my rotation of commercial beers but its just too damn expensive."
"Overall, this is definitely more complex than the original, not as bitter, but it is its own beer really. I really enjoyed this one."
"Still medium bodied and lots of carbonation. The flavor of the oak is there as well but the hops seem off in this one. The bitterness isn't matched with the original and I don't like it as much."
"This was really good. I'm not sure exactly what ""Oak Aged"" means, but if they just added wood chips into Arrogant Bastard and let them soak for awhile, I would say it added a slight sharpness to the taste. It still has a nice, smooth dark flavor to it, but I could almost get the taste of cut wood somewhere in the mix."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Very drinkable, it's a sipper for sure and puts a smile on my face ever time I take a drink. Overall, great brew, not as good as the double bastard in my opinion but it does go down a slightly different road with the oak chip aging it goes through. Pretty cool flavors come out of that additional wood that aren't present in regular arrogant bastard which make this bad boy all worth it!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit dry, but the bitterness sticks around for a little while. It's the kinda beer you only have once an a while, the six pack lasted me almost a year."
"Drinkability- I love the balance and complexity on this beer, one thats a pleasure to drink and you would want to drink all night cuz its hard to switch else where after"
"Overall, this is a very good beer that is a must try for all Beer Advocates. I was really excited to see this on tap at Out West Steakhouse in Kernersville, NC."
"Two fingers easy of light tan colored foam, islands of larger bubbles, however, displays very good retention and density, thick brushes of lacing. Light cloud to the redwood colored liquid, near to opaque, more of a zinc orange further out. There's a flatness to the nose, not necessarily a lack of scents per se, just a certain lack of vigor in the vanilla, chocolate base as well as the creamy whiskey notes and golden raisin, red cherry, apricot scents, this leaves extra room for the hops, grains and grasses to assert themselves whereas otherwise they would come off as more contained. Medium-bodied, whipped up and foamy in the mouth to no obvious specific end, More oomph in the caramel, vanilla fudge, mocha flavors, some sweet cedar as well. Same goes for a mild elevation in the nectarine, apricot, pineapple, peach fruit but, truly, not much. Some orange to lemon citrus yet surprisingly light. Seems to depend more on brute power than offering a richer array of flavors. Telltale astringency through the finish puts out any final thought of flavors reverberating."
"A very drinkable beer with a great hop presence. The Oak doesn't come through much, but does add some to the flavor."
"d: I'll have another!"
"D: I'm not sure that I would want to have more than one of these in a single sitting because the oak tannins really hit my palate hard. It is a tasty brew, and would probably do well to age a bit so that the oak chip flavors blend with the malt and hop character a little better."
"D: a solid offering by Stone, the oak is nice and the mouthfeel is great for the style. A little pricey @ 16.99 a sixer, but good nonetheless"
"Stone Brewery just made it to Chicago - today actually. They have some tough competition out here. It's great to finally taste the Bastard though."
"Can't finish the bottle, i'm guessing it's an off batch, or inferior oak chips. The initial taste is pretty unsettling."
"D - I liked this one a lot. Vanilla and oak is very interesting. Solid body with a intense flavor."
"This is tasty...big caramel and molasses flavors in the malt with the oaky wood flavor and the mellow sweetness coming at the end. The last part of the aftertaste to me is really like the smell of fresh lumber in a way. Perhaps a bit of orange and herbal hop flavor too. The mouth feel is thick and creamy. Overall this is a good good brew, very drinkable and tasty, but I could only afford one on my budget. 18.00 for a sixer is a little too steep."
"d - Enjoyed this one quite a bit. Thought there was a nice contrast of smooth oak and vanilla with bitter hops in the taste. Would def try again."
"Funny thing about this beer... I have never had it without a cheese pairing. I had it once in San Francisco with some smoked gouda, and every time I go to the Gingerman in CT I get the cheese & bread sampler plate and a Stone OAB. This beer is excellent with mild and sharp cheeses alike."
"Drinkability is good, but I was expecting more from this Bastard. A fresher sample is in order, as this one feels more like a weak barleywine."
"D- A very solid brew for sure. Gonna lean toward a sipper here and would hit this one up again."
"Overall, not a big AB fan, the oak doesn't improve it."
"The feel was smooth and coating, the carbonation had a fair bit of spike. The finish was dryish and had a nice pinching feeling that lingered. Great flavor, great beer."
"D: Great taste and a 7.2% ABV, makes for a good time."
"D= Pretty good. Decent beer and just a layer more complexity than the regualr AB."
"Deep mahogany body, not clear, one finger light tan body, medium dissipation with a thin layer of head covering the top of the brew. The nose is malt dominated, caramel, with vanilla notes present, little hop odor. Taste is pretty sweet up front, with some fruity esters (cherries, raisins), not very bitter, this beer really mellowed out from barrel aging. The hops start to shine in the finish, but do not overwhelm the complex malt bill. The mouthfeel is fairly effervescent and not too sticky for the sweetness. A bit boozy tasting to be real drinkable, not sure I'd try to do multiple bottles in one sitting, and the taste re hops certainly benefit from warming up a bit. I certainly prefer this to regular Bastard, very smooth and quite tasty."
"Easy to drink I think. But I've had a 10%, 11%, and then this drink. Anything would likely feel faint after those deep potions. Hard to say..."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no expiration date or lot code. Sampled on March 5, 2010. The pour is a pine color with ruby red hues and a thin but long lasting tan head. The aroma comes across as hoppy and wooden with a hint of Allspice. It has a mouthfeel in the medium range. The taste is well hopped, sappy. wooden, and breaded. It is a fairly nice beer."
"Pours a dark brown-copper hue with a thin dark beige head. Aroma is a mix of sweet toffee, smoked oak, and a hint of citrus. The oak barrel taste is definitely there as well as some alcohol, like a weak alcohol scotch/whiskey. A good amount of thickness, and little carbonation, which I like in a thick beer. for 7.2% ABV, not too strong on the alcohol taste which makes it very drinkable. A decent anytime beer based on pure taste. However, a bit pricey at $3 a bottle at a supermarket."
"I like it. But I'd probably pick the unoaked version over this, given the choice."
"Not what I was expecting: not usually a fan of Stone's big-malt-bigger-hop beers, but this one was balanced, yet complicated enough to string me along, & the oak was an awesome binder. Good combination of challenge & reward, & nothing if not interesting. Great beer, but one is satisfying, thank you."
"~Cheers"
"This brew poured to a slightly cloudy red/amber color with a good sized light tan head that had very good retention and left lace rings down the side of the glass. The aroma here comes across as fruit, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness which I think comes from the oak age? Hops where in the nose is there but they did not seem to be overbearing. The flavor is good, has quite a sweet flavor that comes across quickly, seems like brown sugar and caramel. Also there seems to be a nice amount of wood aged flavor, which adds to the complexity as a nutty and fruit flavor profile come through. There is a hop presence there as well but again it was not overpowering so I do wonder if I got a aged bottle of this one, regardless the flavors where nice. Had good carbonation and a nice full body feel. Overall this was a nice brew, I think one per sitting would be enough for me but one that I would come back to."
"Overall this was an awesome expierence for me and changed my view on barrel aging. Im excited to venture off into a new journey within our craft beer world."
"I supposed I expected the oaked factor to contribute some tannic notes, but found none. Overall, my impression was that the oak perhaps lent a mellowing to what is normally a more vigorous hops attack. More malty and a touch sweet than the standard AB. Finish was firm with lingering caramel malts. My bottle was a bit on the older side, so it may have been a bit sharper when fresh."
"I could glug it for hours but it'd kick my arse and, well, there isn't any left anyway."
"D-this beer is easy drinking. Nothing over powers the senses but the flavors are still bold. This is a hop beast and would be interesting with age on it to see how it developes."
"Overall, a nice beer but personally i still prefer a regular Bastard."
"The beer i took to see the resumption of the Champions League 2010. Poured in a pint glass. Look: Reddish amber color, like a ruby, two fingers of creamy and beige head, very good lacing; Smell: Wood, floral and pine hops, some honey too; Taste: Wood, pine hops, little vanilla and malt in the middle, earth hops and more woods at the finish; Mouthfeel: Dry, woody, extra bitter, robust body; Drinkability: Seems wooden juice with alcohol, world class."
" the oaked version because the oak gives a added complexity."
"D- I could see having a couple of these in a sitting."
"D: Pretty drinkable for such a big beer. Overall this is delicious and arrogant is always a staple, but this is that much bigger and better. Still prefer double bastard, but this is nice."
"Very drinkable, a classic beer. I enjoy it even more than its wood less brother."
"Poured into a Shaker pint. Pours a hazy red/amber with particals suspended in the brew. Small off white head the quickly goes into a film with OK lacing. Aroma of hoppy flowers, alcohol and citrus. Smoother than regular Arrogant Bastard with piny and grassy flavors and a bitter citrus finish. Not a fan of this style but got this as a Christmas present. Love reading the bottle however."
"d: a decent beer that is absolutely worth a try; strong hop flavors but still well balanced with a nice mouthfeel"
"Pours deep mahogony/with ruby hues, and is topped off with scads of beige lacy froth. Massive wood/oak aroma, dank forest and pine, floral dripping herbacous honey, roasted malts. Taste is over the top wood juice, which suits me fine. Pine and citric hops, lucious wet leafy greens, tannic concentrated hop buds. Spiced malty finish. It's mostly about the hops n' wood here. Very good."
"D-For the ABV this is highly drinkable."
"D: Very smooth start to finish. Alcohol is well covered and large malt character paired well with hops."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This has some dark coloring on par with a nut brown. Just a slight head on this with some nice even lacing throughout. This has a nutty, earthen scent, some alcohol burns the nose. Surprisingly, this has a mild taste compared to the smell. I'm not much with food pairings, but this tastes like something that would fit with a nice holiday dinner with just a bit of alcohol underneath to help you cope with the relatives. Awesome beer!"
"D: strikingly different from the standard DB, booze a little too overpowering"
"D - A step up from the regular Bastard. Smoother and more arrogant."
"for those who like extremes and strong ales that are hopped up but nonetheless approachable, this is quite drinkable and a near-suicidally beneficial session. just take gulps every 20 minutes and don't go over 3 hours...if you're afraid of hops and prefer watery beers, no, it will be undrinkable to you."
"D: Impressive. This beer is VERY well crafted (and I am not a big Stone fan!). In my opinion, FARRRR superior to the regular Arrogant Bastard. I think the difference is highly noticeable."
"Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale is exactly what I want from aa ale: dark and earthy, with a warm finish."
"Poured a deep amber color with more carbonation than I expected. Nose was oaky, malty and some vanilla probably from the oak. Lots of oak, big hops on taste, did I mention dry oak, good and malty, that deep ruby color almost brown with a good nose. Big booze for a 7.2% beer, big malts,big hops and big flavor. Very good!"
"D - At just over 7% the only thing stopping you from drinking this would be you hitting the floor too soon."
"This is too bitter to drink much of. I don't think I would ever want to drink more than one bottle of this in a sitting. I like it but it's too intense and dry."
"D- No noticeable alcohol; well-balanced carbonation. Mellow with a nice pucker in the aftertaste. This beer is exceptionally drinkable."
"O: This one is a little more boring than I thought it would be, the age has muted the hops a little too much while the oak chips don't impart the refined oak flavor that I look for in a good oak-aged beer."
"D: Very drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden and the beer has many complex tastes which make it very enjoyable. I really like the subtle oak taste, which is much less overpowering than most oak aged beers i've had. Overall, this is really an excellent beer."
"All in all, this is a decent brew to try at least once. If you like a decent amount of hops, you might enjoy this a little more. I am not a huge hop guy, so it's kind of mediocre to me."
"D: I picked this one up on the recommendation of a friend and I can see why it's one of his favorites. Stone Brewing Company has managed to create a nice drinkable full flavored ale with a fairly high ABV but I don't think you'd know unless someone told you. It wouldn't be a beer I'd drink all night but rather one that I'd enjoy from time to time. This is my first SBC beer and based on it I'll be looking for a few more."
"D: Another solid offering from Stone. The 7.2 abv leaves this one somewhere between the realm of session brew and sipper. I enjoyed all the complexities presented by this beer, but the bitterness of the hops and dryness of the oak became just a bit overwhelming by the end of the bottle. My palate was all but destroyed by the end of the 12 oz (Like the bottle says, I'm not worthy!). That being said, I definitely enjoyed my single 12 oz bottle and will almost surely drink this one again, albeit in small quantities."
"I grabbed the last 3 of these at Utobeer at Borough market London. Lets hope they restock soon.."
"D: I hadn't been a fan of brews with excessive hops until I had A.B. The oaked version is slightly different, but also a bit mellow in comparison to A.B. Either way, one can't go wrong with either version of A.B. A good, hearty brew that is worthy of a session. That is, if you're worthy..."
"I truthfully wouldn't ever get this on my own. I just don't like the flavor that the ""oaked"" adds to it. I'll drink, but only when I am not the one paying for it."
"Surprisingly, the alcohol never shows up and the complexity of flavors invites more sips. The oily, resiny oak may dull the palate though. I enjoy this more than regular AB."
"This is a very aggressive beer. It seems like all of Stone's are that way. I think it was a bit too aggressive in the beginning but it did manage to tone down a notch or two toward the finish."
"Taste seems to be dominated by a hop bitterness, finishes with a dry, more pronounced grapefruit flavor at the end. The oak aging seems to mellow this bastard out a bit, especially compared to the original bastard. The feel is somewhat thick and creamy, a very substantial brew in my book. Highly drinkable, even for a brew with this amount of alcohol content. May be too drinkable."
"Overall, I'm a fan of this beer. It's not the best beer I've ever had but this beer really combines malty and hoppy flavors and still ends up smooth and tasty."
"This beer does not have the undeniable palate presence of the original Arrogant Bastard, not that it's a bad thing. It is much more mellow, refined and the bitterness is definitely diminished. The oak has created a whole different beer, with subdued hops and sweet, nutty malt. It is different but still has a robust flavor, don't make a mistake, it will conquer any palate or food pairing that is unworthy."
"D: Full flavored and robust ale, but after one, I'm done. The touch of oak is nice, but I prefer the regular Arrogant Bastard."
"Drinkability: Because of the strong malt and sweetness of this beer, it seems to be a little strong. I could drink a couple of these maximum."
"Pours a dark, nutty brown with a creamy off-white head. Nice lacing. The oak comes through in a fairly big way atop what is easily recognized as none other than Arrogant Bastard. Lots of hops and a strong malty finish before the lingering bitterness kicks in. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, with the oak creating a nice complexity."
"D- In my honest opinion, this is one of the top 5 beers ever. I don't know much but it gets my vote"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed this one. The oak gives it a nice complex flavor but also makes it pretty smooth drinking."
"Ahh.. oh well.. on to the next.."
"Even the label looks good! http://www.arrogantbastard.com/oaked/images/OAKEDpic.jpg"
"M, D- CO2 level is very lively and gives bouyancy to the significant weight. ABV just detectable. A substantial beer, this."
"Body is thick, though the carbonation is quite prickly for something this rich."
"D - Phenomenal. Smooth, rich and delicious. Great paired or as a stand-alone."
"Cheers!"
"Very nice."
"     Very drinkable. The round earthy finish makes me constany want a other sip.  I would keep it stocked I the fridge if It were more Economical as it is absolutly deliscious for those who like a BIG tasting beer.   "
"Overall a great drink. One of the best oaked beers I have ever had."
"Oak, roasty malt, dark fruit and booze and smoke notes. Toffee, oak and chocolate flavors with a citrusy hop finish. Medium body with light carbonation. Very tstay brew."
"Mouthfeel- Medium body, lively carb."
"Pours a mostly clear reddish brown with dense eggshell colored head. Smell: leafy, pine, citrus peel, caramel, hints of milk chocolate and green wood smoke. Taste: toasted, caramel fading into dark brown sugar, leafy and citrus hops. There's a just a bit of a charred wood smoke / aged whiskey thing towards the end of the sip. I'm not sure that I prefer this to the standard bastard, but it's definitely more easy drinking."
"D - Very drinkable for something that is this heavy and has this much alcohol. Great beer, wish I could buy it all the time."
"D: needs to be sipped over atleast an hour, flavors come out of hiding from refridgerator cold to room temperature. amazing brew."
" I do enjoy a good bastard and this is a wee one..12ozbottle? The first impression is that is resembles AB exactly or does it? Well, the first aromas to hit my nose are familiar. A closer inspection reveals some earthier notes a woody potting soil? I can detect booze and funky hop aromas. Minty, citric, floral, dry and woody. The oak still cant tame the Bastard but I do think its the culprit for the dryer taste. I am gonna have to go against the grain here and say I would rather have the original over the oaked... Im not worthy."
"In fact, the oak seems to mellow out the whole ale, as opposed to offering a more complex beer necessarily. The usual chinook and cascade hop dominance with a very strong malt backbone, but the oak seems almost like they dry hopped it with oak chips as well. Mouthfeel thins through the bottle, but this remains a surprisingly drinkable beer, not nearly as demanding of a drink as the other versions of bastard ale."
"D- For such a complex beer, its not a tough job to hammer this one down. The carbonation is perfect, the smoothness is to die for, and the overall alcohol burn with lingering effects is wonderful....This beer is outstanding"
"I'm definitely a fan of the original Arrogant Bastard, but I feel confident in saying this trumps it in my mind. The oak adds some great depth to an already tasty beer."
"D- Wouldn't mind having another one of these, in fact, maybe I will."
"Taste is close to an DIPA, which didn't quite match the aroma. Picking up carbonation, bitters, booze, and a dry finish. Good beer...would put it under a Rogue Dead Guy though."
"This is interesting, cause this is a good beer that seems to present all of the requirements to a high level, but does not seem to exceed them. I think it is easy to drink given these circumstances and the ABV allows more than one."
"Drinkability is pretty nice. A smooth and complex flavor that goes down pretty easy. I could see having a couple of these at a time and I'd like to have it again."
"taste is smooth, somewhat woody, caramel, malts, grapefruit hops in the back, and some nuts, ends on the dry side and nicely bitter."
"Medium body and medium carbonation with a slightly dry finish. Not sure if this is better or worse than the regular AB, all I know is both are great and quite tasty. I'd be interested to try both versions side by side later on to see how they vary."
"(D)- A good beer with an extremely dry feel that is made even drier with the oak barrel. Definitely a winner, but I think I would rather just reach for the regular Arrogant Bastard; its less expensive and easier to find, and perhaps just as good."
"-i like it. may have been a touch old and i might update later"
"the oak makes this beer, in my opinion, much more drinkable than the regular Arrogant Bastard by mellowing out some of the bite. with the original already a favorite of mine, this brew is something I'll certainly buy again and again."
"Not quite as great as on tap, in New York but still a superbly tasty strong ale. The original I still think remains king, the oak seems to cut the hops back a little and mutes the balance of flavour"
"I was actually rather dissapointed by the taste. Everything else was fine - but the oak came through a bit too strong. It masked some of the great hops in the original Arrogant Bastard. It also added too much vanilla undertone to it. This beer reminded me of a well-made chardonnay that got pummeled by oak. It's a great beer, but it could have been more nuanced. From my understanding, there is quite a bit of bottle variation in this particular beer. I would buy it again."
"Had this one at Pizzaria Paradiso in Georgetown. Beautiful look - deep amber color with a nice fluffy head on top. Nose is surprisingly straightforward - oak and a touch of caramel malt, with quiet hops in the background. Taste is oak again, but the hops come through strong. This is nice, but didn't touch the Maharaja I had after in terms of complexity. Maybe not worth the price (which is always high) in my book, but still good every once in a while."
"D - yummy, but wearing after a bit. one easy to put down, but also enough."
"Still, not to be ignored."
"D - For being such a big beer this is very quaffable."
"Good carbonation to it, very nice mouthfeel, easy to drink if you like hops at all. I'm a fan, definitely an improvement on the regular Arrogant Bastard."
"O - A very good beer! This is even better than the regular Arrogant Bastard, albeit slightly so. Wish I could find it in bigger bottles :p"
"D- The oak-aging of this beer really smoothes it out and creates a nice smooth drinkability. Leaves a little heat in the throat, but not in a bad way."
"The beer feels light and oily but they are by no means negative characteristics. Definitely more drinkable than the original Arrogant Bastard. Bitter, but not palate scraping."
"Drinkability: While this was certainly smoother and easier than regular AB, I really missed that extra arrogance. Oaked Arrogant Bastard on-tap was just too flat and dull. Still tasty though."
"D - Greatly enjoyable when consumed in moderation. Strong yet smooth."
"D- really enjoyed this beer. seemed to be very well-balanced with a malty sweet start and hard bitter finish."
"This was my first Stone beer, and needless to say it knocked my socks off!"
"This has been available for a while but today I finally snagged it. Seems lighter all together compared to the Bastard. It is more vanilla-ey and the oak flavor shows up reminiscent to a barleywine. Hops are much more subdued in this one . Lots of caramel malt, toffee and caramel flavors."
"O: Good beer, but it could be so much more. Would be a true great if the back end were smoother. All that aside, I am blessed to have this as my introduction to Stone Brewing Company."
"D - I probably couldn't drink a bunch of these in one night, maybe 2 or 3 tops, due to the bitterness. I'm more of a sweet ale/stout person. However, for the hopheads out there, this is a wonderful beer and I recommend it to anyone."
"D Good even though it is so big I reached the bottom of the snifter with no trouble. 4.0"
"D) Good! Rich, flavorful, something to savor. But enjoyable and easy to drink. If the alcohol was a little less present, I'd enjoy it more but this is a treat. Highly recommended."
"d- good, wouldn't drink it all the time."
"This is a great brew, I havent had the original version but if it is near this good I know I will like it. This is one big and great beer."
"It's really a quite interesting brew. Definitely stands out as something special. It's drinkable, but not really an everyday beer, in my opinion."
"D: One of the great beers of this style. Will definitely open up a beer lover's world if they haven't tried this one yet. But be ready for some hops."
"Instant classic."
"Drinkability: I love how smooth this beer is, the malts really make this thing a treat to sip and savor. Letting it warm up shows the good hop aromas are still around. Coming in at 7.2% ABV, this bastard is dangerously drinkable, and very easy to session with. Although at nearly $15 a six pack, I'm glad I was able to get just a single bottle of this without killing my wallet. Overall a pleasurable experience that I will definetley come back to again."
"Mmmm... for a beer that's marketed as being aggressive, this is a lot smoother than it's non-treed brother. I really liked the original AB, this one is exceptional. The drinkability on this is insane, I could drink several in one sitting. An aggressive beer that is complex and absolutely delicious."
"The feel of this beer is a bit light with low carbonation and a good drinkability."
"Part of that is because the alcohol is seemingly only the number on the bottle. It doesn't feel anywhere close to 7.20% and I would almost qualify this as a session beer, regardless of how high that % is. This is an absolute winner and worthy of the accolades that everyone has given it on here. This is a beer that's strong in craft and taste but not in it's punch. A worthy achievement indeed!"
"This is great, and I would probably take this over the normal Bastard due to it's inhanced comlexity and hightened drinkability."
"Shows a ruby/brown color in the glass with a thick froth. Louds of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, dark berries, cirtus hops, oak, and vanilla dominate the nose & palate. This is an outstanding brew!"
"I have enjotyed most American Strong Ales that I've had. This one is not for me. I think I would love this beer without the oak after taste. Poured from bottle into clean glass. About 1/4 inch of head. Smelled inviting and first taste had me questioning what it was I just tasted. Continued on and it never got better. I'm not saying this is a bad beer becase many like it. Just not for me. Ill stick with Great Lakes Nosferatu for an American Strong Ale."
"D- I most definitely could have myself many of these in one session. I think I may like this more then the original. I am gonna be going back to buy some more of this."
"Really great in taste but packs a punch."
"What a wonderfully complex but balanced beer; I can't say I've ever had anything like it. I didn't think the regular Arrogant Bastard could be surpassed, but this definitely does so."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a thin head. The aroma isn't very distinct at first, with just a hint of malt sweetness. As it warms, however, scents of fruit and alcohol come out. In contrast to the mild aroma, there is nothing non-distinct about the flavor. Every sip is jam-packed with flavor, with a rich, dry fruitiness and notes of caramel contrasting with a potent, woodsy hop bitterness. The heat of the alcohol is apparent, but it is not overwhelming, and the rich smoothness of the beer helps to tame the booziness. Despite the many-faceted boldness in the flavor, it is quite drinkable. Two thumbs up... enjoyed every sip."
"Great character in this beer. Quite a monster that has been aged and mellowed."
"Overall, I love this beer! Another hit by Stone. I'm glad I have five more sitting in my beer fridge. Definitely pick this one up!"
"Super intense yet also super smooth and drinkable. World class."
"D - This one was good but I think I would take a regular Arrogant Bastard...the hops are perfect in this one and the oak only shines through to take the hops down a notch"
"Aroma is powerfully delicious, caramelized apricot, grapefruit, pine. I don't detect oak. The hoppiness of this string beer hits hard up front, with full-on grapefruity bitterness, balnced breifly by a rich mouthfeel then a lingering very bitter finish. Very delicious, but a bit exhausting and bit unbalanced. I would believe this to be a DIPA. I also can't quite tell what the oak brings to this...I would like to taste this and regular AB side by side to compare."
"this guy is strong (a healthy ABV) and bursting with flavor. it's good for occasional drinking, but i can't see myself drinking this regularly."
"Drinkability? Off the charts. Careful with this one."
"To me this is very much superior to the regular Arrogant Bastard."
"D-Like the original AB, the 7.2% ABV is dangerously masked. I don't notice it in the taste. Very drinkable. But I guess I learned I don't like wood in my beer."
"Moderate carbonation, full mouthfeel, but very tannic and puckery. Average drinkability, I don't think the oak does anything better for an already very good beer."
"The mouthfeel was mainly Hoppy and tangy, light carbonation. This is good very complex beer, I'll be enjoying this one again."
"Overall, a deep and complex offering. Enjoyable."
"A decent beer but not up to the expectations of a Stone brew."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied! despite the high alcohol, it's very drinkable....how drinkable? if I had more i'd be drinking it all night."
"d: this would be very drinkable provided you are a major hophead! also the hi alcohol content will limit all but the most accomplished alcoholics. CHEERS!!!!"
"Pours a murky deep ruby in color with an off white head and excellent lacing. The smell is complex and rich with earth notes, a big hint of oak and some extremely bitter hops. The flavor is a bit hot when fresh but nothing like a straight up bastard. Bitter grapefruit and earth oak flavoring cover the pallet and a lingering almost barleywine after taste hangs around for a while. As for mouthfeel and drinkability, well its almost to good. I could drink this all day"
"Drinkability: strong in both alcohol and flavor, but tasty. Goes down slow but easy."
"Drinkability: good beer. i prefer the regular (light) version over the oak, but the oak/aging does add some interesting flavors and mouthfeel."
"The drinkability is superb and somewhat scary. The 7.2% ABV is virtually unnoticeable and could easily creep up on you. I could drink this nectar of the gods all night. Excellent job Stone! The regular Arrogant Bastard is a great beer, but this has got to be one of the best beers I have ever had."
"American strong ale indeed!"
"D: Oh my, this is almost too good. If you have not tried this brew yet, do yourself a favor and go grab one. Better yet, if you can get a case, do that..."
"This is one I could definitely see myself drinking more than one of, were it not for the price tag. I love regular Arrogant Bastard, but this seems to have a much fuller quality to it. Absolutely worth a shot, at least once."
"Good drinkability. The strong bitter hops can get overwhelming along with the toastyness. Still a high quality brew. I would have it again."
"this beer pours a nice clear red color with an off white almost tan color that sticks to the glass as it recedes to an uneven patchy lace. the aroma gives away a bita of the oak, but not so much as to overpower the hop arrangement. the taste follows, once again well balanced hops and malt, the malt complimented by the vanilla woodiness of the oak. the medium mouthfeel with good co2 make this a pretty drinkable beer."
"D - Very drinkable though the flavor is a little strong if your having more than one or two. Great beer!"
"Overall this is a full mouth experience with many differnt flavors adding to the overall experience. One to sip and contemplate, but when your done you might as well order another one or two, because you've still got some thinking to do."
"The flavor profile is really full of hops upfront with the oak wood chips and roasted malt following through. For an aged beer, the hops are still pretty prevalent throughout the brew. There isn't as much bitterness as the original Bastard and at 7.2% ABV, I really couldn't detect any alcohol palpable on the tongue, which really increases drinkability. I was really impressed. The Oaked AB has a medium-bodied and creamy mouthfeel with bold flavors. Drinkability is pretty decent - definitely needs its time for you to finish it. For now, I'm actually preferring this oaked version to the original AB. Drinks very well!"
"Overall, I am not to impressed with this beer. It is just way to hot for me. I like the oak flavor, but the alcohol that it brings with it is too much. I should be able to finish this fine, however."
"D: Who can ever complain about anything with the words ""Arrogant Bastard"" in its title? It's complex, yet smooth, yet full and robust. A bit sweeter than the original, but quite the experience, nonetheless."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a one finger off white head. Smells of hops, sweet malt, and oak. Taste is the same, and the alcohol comes through. Sweetness blends nicely with the bitter hops. Full bodied and nicely carbonated. I could drink this one again and again."
"D: Drinks very nicely."
"Review #600. I hope this arrogant beer can live up to this milestone. Pours a magahony color with two fingers of off-white head that had excellant retention. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is not what I expected. I expected some of the oak to come through but all I smell is pungent hops. The hops give off pine resin and some light citrus aromas. It has been awhile since I have tasted regular Arrogant Bastard so I do not know how different the oaked version compares. Again any oaked elements are very subtle. Overall very hoppy and resiny flavor and no balance. Bitterness is high. Decent mouthfeel and carbonation. The bitterness hurts the mouthfeel because of the lingering bitter aftertaste. Another unbalanced, highly hopped and bitter beer. Enjoyable if that is your thing."
"Edit: I don't know if I just missed it with the first bottle, but this next bottle revealed a lot more oak and vanilla"
"Overall, a great beer with great, potent flavors. One of Stone's best offering and a must try."
"D: This beer is great. The oak really balances out the brew. I haven't had the original but I'm not sure that I want to after having this beer."
"Drinkability: it's a pretty heavy beer with 7% abv, slightly bitter but smooth, not really an everyday beer but like a good cigar this beer nicely compliments a good occasion"
"Overall, I like this beer...but I must admit, I prefer to leave the oak out...just like in my white wines."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I could see myself ordering a few at the bar and following them with a nice sweet stout. Cost is a little prohibitive, but it is a wonderful treat."
"D- Very drinkable. Id have no problem putting a few of these down."
"Overall: I appreciate what they did here with the added oak character, although I almost feel like the marketing mock is humorous considering they dare you to drink it and then you are rewarded with a smooth ale even if it is still a strong one."
"Very tasty, better than the regular. Much smoother, you can taste a bit of oak on it, and it leaves a good flavor in your mouth. Still a bit sticky like the regular one. Overall an awesome beer! Worth the higher price tag, but I wish it was sold in bombers."
"A very good beer in my opinion. However, if I had to pick one of the two, I would pick the original... just my two cents."
"Drinkability: Both the oak and non-oaked versions are fantastic. However the addition of oak seems to bring this beer together releasing more flavors and making this beer more complexed. They are two beers to be respected but respect the original more and dabble in the oak from time to time. I'm afraid to say I enjoy the oaked more. I'm scared of the arrogant bastard beating me up now."
"Had this one on tap at the Sunset Grill in Allston MA. I tried it in the bottle about a year or so agoa and really liked it, but decided to review it this time. Quite a nice looking beer. When it was brought to me I almost thought it was a porter with how dark it looked. I had to hold it up to the light and I could see that it was a very very deep red/brown color on the edges with a slight haze to it, the middle was still very dark. It had a off white colored head to it, almost a caramel or butterscotch color that goes away and lingers for about half way through. Slight lacing on the glass. The smell is good citrus and pine hops, not quite as strong as I remember it in the past. Taste was good too. Similar to to the taste, same hops, followed by a slight smokey taste to it. Again, not as strong as I remember it. Mouthfeel was good, surprisingly smooth for an American Strong Ale. Also it was pretty drinkable. A pretty universal beer, could drink it year round, could be nice in warm or cold weather."
"All in all, this is a super smooth sipper that goes great after a long day of work (at least that's how I enjoyed it)!"
"I would not recommend this as a first step for one moving away from BMCs, and perhaps not even as a second step. Just like DIPAs, it isn't going to be a beer that ushers in a gentle transition! Other selections might be recommended for that purpose. It is, however, clearly a world-class American Strong Ale, and excellently represents this style. For the experienced drinker of specialty/craft beers, this is a must-try."
"This bottle was cellared for about a year. Appearance is a dark amber with decent carbonation and great lacing. Smells of malt and oak-wonderful. Taste is completely different from Arrogant Bastard. I pick up some of the same hop profiles and malts as AB, but the oak definitely mellows and enriches. I walso pick up a hint of coconut as well. Great mouthfeel and highly drinkable."
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a small head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma was citrusy and not a lot of it. The taste had some citrus but was mostly bitter, with a bitter grapefruit skin aftertaste. Feel was medium bodied with a slightly oily feel. Drinkability was OK. I liked Arrogant Bastard and I liked Double Bastard so I'm not quite sure what went wrong here. If this is an example of what oak aging does to a beer, you can have it."
"Drinkability is well not exactly moorish"
"D- Really an awesome beer. The oaked addition is subtle but definitely there and pleasant."
"Pours a dark amber color with a one finger head and okay lacing. The smell is of a malty backbone with citrus hops present over the top, grapefruit smell there. The taste is of a smooth malt backbone more prevalent than the orginial and the hop taste is citrus hops, and the oak taste is present also. The bitterness however, is much less pronounced. This beer is much smoother and the flavors are more enjoyable than the regular AB. The mouthfeel is of slight carbonation. Overall this is a very good and very drinkable beer, the oak aging makes the flavors smooth and more prevalent and much more enjoyable."
"12 oz bottle. Pours an attractive dark amber with little to no head. Strong smell of tropical fruit (especially pineapple), caramel, malt and hops. I tasted notes of pineapple with an aftertaste of espresso beans."
"It's a strong beer, but I always want to drink a couple of these."
"D: Much more drinkable than ""regular"" Bastard and much more complex and interesting (in my opinion)."
"Drinkability: If they weren't so expensive, I'd be drinking these all the time. Wonderful beer."
"Double Bastard is one of my favorite Stone beers and this one is certainly up there too. There is a lot to appreciate in this wood aged beer. It definately makes me want to try more of the oaked varieties."
"Future outlook: This was alright, but for my money, wasn't as good as ""regular"" AB. Probably won't revisit anytime soon."
"D- Like the original AB, this is a very assertive beer with a ""Thank you sir, can I please have another?"" conundrum of palette punishment being overcome by the primal urge for another. Great beer, but the one area I found it to be inferior to the original is with it's drinkability. There is a lingering smoke to this one that is very interesting and tasty (would undoubtedly pair wonderfully with food) but is a little more to handle than the AB."
"This beer is very good, but the woody taste might get to me after a while."
"Overall Impression - A drinkable beer. The oak is interesting. It seems the oak subdues the hop flavor making it bitter with out the nice hop flavor."
"D - Drinkability and mouthfeel were very surprising to me since it went down so smooth and fast. I wish I had the 750 ml bottle of this."
"This is an excellent beer to savor after a long day at work. This is a very well balanced strong ale. I can't believe that its 7.2%. The bitter hops is the first thing that you taste. But, its not overpowering. Its hoppy bite is mellowed by the oak aging. The carbonation is full and not fizzy. Its the second sensation that hit. Then the carbonation and bite fade and the rich malty and oak flavors linger for a while. Not strong, just present."
"Had this the other day while brewing. Poured a dark amber/ruby red color with beige head that faded somewhat slowly and left good lacing. Smelled of malt, earthy hops, spice and fruit. Tasted of caramel malt and earthy hops. Very smooth. Even better than the original."
"-Bye"
"Wonderfully drinkable and very enjoyable."
"M&D: very smooth on the carbonation, the body is full but not OTT, the flavour is complex and not overly oaked, and the alc., just like AB, is very well hidden. A balanced act overall, as complex as it is highly quaffable. Highly recommended!"
"I give this a slight nod over its garden variety brother, but you can't miss with either one."
"pour is copper amber with a nice sticky lace of a head. a good amount of wood chips in the process made the palate and nose a bit boarder. well malted. with a mild wood, honey, pine nose. the palate has a wonderful interesting lemon zest pepper and sweet woody honey pollen. no alcohol in there really. nice work. much broader than the regular arrogant bastard."
"D- Very drinkable and a great strong ale. Will find more for my enjoyment."
"Not sure what the big deal is here. It pretty much tastes the same as the regular Arrogant Bastard, the one advantage is that you can get it in 12 ounce bottles. worth getting if that' s importnat to you and if the per ounce price is not much higher than the standard."
"drinkability: overall a great beer and one of the best beers on the market period. Love this beer with some good BBQ."
"If you have not tried this beer, you must as it is truly a work of art!"
"I had this poured from a bottle. The color was nice, had a good odor to it, it didn't have the same smell as the arrogant bastard regular, iI could detect a difference in the two beers for sure. The taste had a little bit more of a depth, and a bite to it than the non oaked arrogant bastard and you could taste the wood working with the beer to change the flavor and depth. However, the flavour difference wasn't really enough to justify the price difference in my opinion. I personally prefer to regular arrogant bastard."
"Pours a murky deep ruby in color with an off white head and excellent lacing. The smell is complex and rich with earth notes, a big hint of oak and some extremely bitter hops. The flavor is a bit hot when fresh but nothing like a straight up bastard. Bitter grapefruit and earth oak flavoring cover the pallet and a lingering almost barleywine after taste hangs around for a while. As for mouthfeel and drinkability, well its almost to good. I could drink this all day"
"D. The beer has major flavors, but they all balance out pretty well. Basically everything is over the top ib a really good way. A must try"
"Drinkability- Aside from the alcohol, the flavors come together nice and magage to be refreshing enough to remain pretty drinkable."
"Pours an orangy redy browny thick syrupy color with a light tan head that dissipates and laces well. Smell is vanilla, sticky piny citrusy hops, and malt. First taste is the bitter sticky hops which I love, then I get a distinct taste of pencil shavings which is not so pleasant. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, drinkability is fine."
"I picked up a six pack of these after hearing so much about this beer. I have never seen these before where I normally shop (they have other Stone products) and it was the only six pack left so I had to grab it."
"Though drinkable the high alcohol content makes this difficult to sit back and take down like many other brews."
"D-The look and smell of this beer had me excited but it just doesn't do much for me after that...Ok...nothing more.."
"Poured a dark reddish brown with a nice lievely head, some lacing down the glass. Smells of pine with some sweetness, also some oakiness. Tastes sweet up front with hop bitterness and some oak taking over from mid-mouth all the way down. Delightful. Mouthfeel is rich and good. Drinkability I knocked down slightly as I see this one as a beer to enjoy as a single, not a session beer."
"I prefer the regular Arrogant Bastard."
"D=enjoyable and somewhat stout, limits drinkability, however the alcohol is not out in front and therefore could sneak up."
"Pours a beautiful red brown color with a small off white head that leaves lots of stickage in the glass. Bitter hops, sweet malts to balance, some small whiffs of alcohol and a little bit of maple syrup and wet wood notes. Sharp and assertive, bright with hops, good barrel complexity and loads of malt holding it all together. A drying wave of alcohol add to the experience, rather than becoming offensive. Great with food i must say, this is a very drinkable beer, medium/light in body, aggressive carbonation. If you havent tried it, and you're a fan of the original, pick it up."
"Picked up a single of this to try over in Wiscoland. Other than the disappointing smell, this was a pretty solid beer. The oak is present, but not over the top."
"Served on tap at Novare Res, poured into my Uprising Chalice. The color of the beer is a combination of dark copper and ruby. It has a thin tan head. The beer smells woods; there is oak and hops in the aroma. You can certainly taste the oak in the flavor, as well as some alcohol. There is also some grassiness/floral flavors, but that could just be an aspect of the oakiness. There is a hint of caramel sweetness in the finish. There is a normal amount of carbonation and a medium body with some mouth coating. Overall, a strong and tasty beer that is worth seeking out."
"D: For only the brave, but if you are into dark ales, I don't see how this one could do you wrong."
"This is an overall good beer. I think it's a bit pricey for what you get, but that's my opinion. The beer is a nice deep amber color and has a lot of complexity in the smell with definitive notes of oak. The taste is rather good with a great balance of hops and malt with a lot of oak flavor. Finishes surprisingly dry considering how big this beer tastes. Decent alcohol flavor in the finish is brought out more with the oak accompaniment."
"Beer pours up nicely with a lingering soft, foamy head. The aroma is dark malt and warm brown sugar. The flavor has a lot well-rounded roasted malt character, with some faint chocolate. The bitterness from the malt and hops plays well with the sweet aroma. The mouthfeel, my favorite part, makes this beer truly extraordinary: thick, almost creamy. Alcohol comes in at a reasonable 7.2%, making this beer a good one to share with friends who might not be the biggest beer geeks. Thanks Stone, I'll definitely be picking up some more."
"The beer is pretty heavy and thick, and I do feel the booze in the stomach as I drink, but not as much as I would expect. This is a very drinkable beer that is deceiving. The high abv always rears it's head eventually..."
"D- Delicious, a great overall beer. Will definitely seek this out again."
"A great beer, the more I have it the more I appreciate it."
"Other than the noticeable oak flavor, can you really tell the difference? This is once again, a damn fine ale and a great interpretation of the Arrogant Bastard. That reminds me, I need to put my review of the original AB up ASAP."
"This beer lived up to the hype. An outstanding job by Stone."
"Overall, this in one tremendous beer that only gets better and more complex as it warms up. Really top-notch!"
"Medium-bodied with a strong amount of carbonation a clean and dry finish"
"If you want an unreal oak aged beer go with the oak aged unearthly DIPA from southern tier!....good shit"
"Overall, a good offering - no doubt about it. This is a beer created to be savored by and entice the palates of beer advocates and at $16.99 (!!!) a sixer only real beer nerds will go for it, anyway. Outside of such a context this beer almost doesn't make sense."
"Is there too much going on with this beer? Seriously, there might just be. I am going back to the non-oaked AB at a future date, which I subjectively remember liking even more. But then, I still have the rest of these to enjoy and ponder."
"Cheers!!!"
"Notes - A good mouthfeel but a little more carbonation wouldn't have hurt. I really like Arrogant Bastard but this struck me as too hoppy. That can't be right. I'll mark this one down as a revisit candidate, maybe with a side by side for regular AB."
"Overall: Powerful IPA that slaps you in the face. I love the flavor and smokiness of this one. It's major drawback: the price. I paid over $16 for a six-pack. Worth trying, but I'm not sure I would buy again."
"D - Not really a session beer at all, but complex and delicious. Has a lot going on and the oak flavors really balance it out very nicely. Great brew."
"D- Despite the ABV I could drink it or either of its brothers all night."
"Overall: B+, 4"
"Purchased from Rays Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Pours a dark amber color with a thin off-white head. Aroma balanced between hops and malt, and oak is detectable. Strong oak flavor that lingers, but is not overpowering. Burnt caramel flavors and hops come through in the finish. Medium to full bodied. I wanted another after I drank it, but 2 would probably be the limit in one session. I'd definitely buy this again."
"I want to love this one but the woodiness is getting in my way.... I'll review the Reg Arrogant Bastard and then revisit this one...."
"D - hands down, one of the best beers i've ever tasted. i could drink the whole six pack if they weren't so pricey. get it anytime you see it."
"Dark amber/red with a nice thick tan head. A bit of oak comes through in the nose which is primarily of wax fruit and hops. Flavors are pleasant-full rich malt with nice balance of bitter hops. Flavors finish hop heavy and then is long lasting. Not a lot of oak in the mouth, if any, a bit of a disappointment that. A second bottle provided a bit more malt in the nose and a hint more wood in the flavor but it may just have been expectation with the second bottle. Bitter hop finish. Quality and well made; not as ""significant"" as one may want."
"MF/D: Sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little intense, but still good. Lighter in body than I had expected. Overall, a solid offering from Stone"
"D: A great, complex beer. I'm trying to recall this beer against the non-oaked version and I don't think either one is better than the other - just different. This one has more earthy flavors, but a deeper complexity. A mighty impressive beer and one which showcases the potential benefits of oak aging. Not all beers are capable of handling the oak and not all beers that are oaked are oaked properly, but this is certainly not one of those beers."
"D: I loved this beer. I found myself sipping it even though it was creamy and easy to drink. I just wanted to savor it. Stone once again earns my respect. Please come to IL!"
"D: Not a huge fan of this one (and, to be honest, the original form). I recognize the appeal in this one but it's not for me, and I won't get it in the future."
"slightly hoppy aroma, some brown sugar-like sweetness, a bit of earthiness from the wood, sweetness opens up with the beer, very ""brown shuggah""-esque in aroma.. pours a deep auburn with tan head, faint bits of red when light passes through.. Taste is hoppy, but is a conservative amount of hop, theres a sweetness in there as well and a bit of a roasted, earthy flavor, assumably from the oak. its not super robust but nicely balanced, wood flavor really comes through as the beer approaches room temperature.. mouth is on the lighter side of moderate, not thin though, nice carbonation (not too crisp but present). its very drinkable, goes down easily, not the fullest flavor but good all around.."
"Overall - I definitely prefer the original over this weird wooden brew. Arrogant Bastard is just fine without oak chips, and I'm not totally enjoying the addition. Now if you'll excuse me, I need take a blowtorch to the back of my tongue to put my bitter tastebuds out of their misery."
"12 oz. Into snifter. Deep orange/red color. Thin head that faded to a film. Some lacing but not much. Smells great, biscuity malts, fruity hops, some oak notes coming though. Tastes like a mellowed out Arrogant Bastard, bitter hops, some wood tastes coming out into the taste also. Medium to full body."
"Drink is good probably a little too heavy for a six-pack but definetly a must have."
"Notes: This is such a great beer it's a wolf in sheeps clothing. I love it. Cheers"
"D--A solid one and done beer"
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick beige head that dies to a thin line of bubbles. Nice lacing down the glass. Smells great, like oily citrus hops. A great woody citrus flavor with some sweet malts. Delicious. It is much more tamed than the original Arrogant Bastard. Even the bitter finish is more mellow, it's still there but not as strong. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth....I can't really find any faults with this beer, it is definitely up there with the best."
"D: a scrumptious beer! This is another buy, great flipping stuff"
"Moderate carbonation, and a slight chewy feel. I lacks some of the depth I had hoped for. I guess they don't call it ""Arrogant Bastard"" for nothing."
"What a fun beer to drink, so much going on but pieced together well. The creamy-oak flavor is appealing and adds complexity to the brew. It's my third or fourth time drinking this; I cannot understand why I have never picked up a six."
"D- American Strong Ale, baby! This is one of those beers that is just fun to drink. The flavor profile is interesting, the taste is great, and the feel is perfect. Pour me another, please!"
"Great, great beer. I have not had the pleasure of the Double Bastard, but will be seeking it with fervor. The Arrogant Bastard franchise has me hooked."
"Another solid offering from a great brewery."
"D: Gotta say, other than a bit of vanilla, there's not much to distinguish this from the original. Still a fantastic brew, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try the oaked versus the standard (or pay much extra for the chance). Stone's got another winner here, give this a shot!"
"Turbid, copper amber with tons of fine suspended yeast and a beautiful creamy tan head that leaves sheets of lace in big sticky rings all down the glass. Smells savory and complex with a big smack of pungent, fruity hops and caramel malt. I can't really detect any oak in the nose. Tastes very balanced between piney hops and caramel malt, a bit smoother with a more refined mellowed flavor than regular AB. The oak is all in the finish and the flavors grow bigger and badder as it warms up. Medium slick hop oily mouthfeel with velvety smooth carbonation. An outstanding beer."
"Overall: Good drinkability, strong roasted coffee flavor in the beginning then strong bitter hop toward the end that fades to a burnt bitter flavor. All of the flavors are really big, could probably use some age on it to calm things down."
"5 stars"
"Pours deep amber brown from the bottle with nice tan head. Nose not as strong as expected with strong hops mixing with little oak. Taste is nicley balanced with hop and malt balance with great vanilla touch at the finish. What a beer! Certainley worth while."
"Drinkability: This is a yummy, delicious beer; complex, yet unbearably simple. The oaken flavors are there, but they're not overwhelming. However, nothing about this beer is underwhelming. The heavy mouthfeel goes along with the arrogance of this beer. Stone warns you that ""you probably won't like it."" I believe I do like it. But many, many more samples will be tasted before the final judgment has been passed... for now, this beer is definitely on the keeper list."
"D: A unique take on the original A.B. I have to say this beer marries with oak quite well. If you like A.B. you have to try this. I do slightly favor the original however. I will have to pick up a few of each the next time I get access to these and do a side by side comparison. Either way, I come out a winner."
"This beer poured an opaque dark copper with some red tints around the edges and a single-finger tan head. The smell is a cavalcade of different hops as well as some oak and malt. I can pick out floral, piney, and citrusy hops. The taste starts off with a combination of malt and grapefruity hops that balance well and give way to some more hops that are slightly piney and floral as well as some oak flavor that helps balance out some of the bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a certain amount of slickness from the hops and fairly low carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, one of those ones that everyone should try at least once if they're serious about beer."
"Full bodied and viscous beer, it's dank and drinkable. There is alot going on with this beer. I enjoyed it very much. It's definitely worth checking out."
"This beer just blew my mind. The oak aroma sets you up for a complex array of flavors. Some people were saying that it has too strong of a grapefruit taste. The grapefruit is there but balances perfectly. Great head retention when poured into a glass and the color was one of the nicest hues of red I have ever seen. My friends were eve commenting on how hilarious the bottle was. This is my perfect beer and I could drink it everyday. I was worried that my $16.00 was not going to be worth it but im getting another one this weekend. Great call on this one. Fantastic!"
"Hazy dark burnt orange with one finger creamy head, nice lacing all the way down. I think this is an amazing looking beer! Smell has that oak, bourbon scent. Taste is interesting, the bourbon barrel start with grapefruity, dry finish. Very luscious mouthfeel. Drinkability is fair, I like grapefruit but since I can't eat more than three I probably wouldn't care to drink more than three of these. Good stuff, though."
"A terrific beer, highly recommended."
"D: I remember this being a lot better when I had it in the past. Before, I would have said that this is definitely better than regular AB. Now, I'm not so sure. Maybe I got an old bottle. Regardless, this is quite outstanding. If it were a bit bigger, it would be an ideal digestif."
"Hands down,this beer kicks ass! this is perhaps stones best beer. This is the third time I've had it and still blown away...why this only has an A- is strange, trust the bros review!"
"The bitter finish was not over powering. Nicely balanced ale."
"D: As long as you keep sipping that bitterness is held slightly at bay due to the initial sweetness. That being said the IBUs must be off the charts. This beer is also 7.2%ABV and fairly full bodied. Definitely a sipping beer. Yet, as stated above the palate becomes adjusted to the bitterness, and a second beer may go down faster."
"Drinkability: Session if you can - but a sipper for me. Sip & Savor on the beach after a hot day in the sun. A beer to look forward to drinking."
"The first flavors that I got were some grapefruit mixed with honey, evolves into malty sweetness and finishes dry and nutty. The oak just adds this amazing wood-chip flavor on the way out. The flavor matches the scent quite nicely. This feels very creamy on the tongue, very nice. The balanced ABV makes this easy to put down, but still so full of complexity."
"Rating: I'm giving this one five out of five coals, BUT...it's not because i think it's the best tasting beer i've ever had, but because it's so well crafted. I almost expect a gargoyle to fly out of the bottle and punch me in the face. It's almost a magical beer with it's incredible balance. The bastard who came up with this brew deserves to be arrogant."
"this is a very nice beer, not usually my style but just adds much to this discovery of so many new flavours from america. i'll tick off the OAB, but if i come across it again i will buy it."
"Verdict - it is an ebullient American-hop bomb, though a little more smooth and refined than its original namesake. Like several Stone beers, it will be a palate-wrecker...not one to start up with. I like it better than regular Arrogant Bastard."
"The beer pours a dark copper color with a light cream 1 finger head, a little lacing. The first thing that hits you is the sweet caramelized sugar smell with earthy hints of the oak. The beer tastes almost exactly as it smells, caramel and oak with the addition of some bitterness. Even though it is bitter there is not a lot of hop flavor. The sweet alcohol flavor is strong, something I really never love in a beer. It goes down smooth and seems to be only lightly carbonated. The oak flavor is great and will keep me coming back but the strong alcohol flavor will keep me from having a session with this beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable for the style, a sipper, but still delicious and drinkworthy."
"Poured from a 12ounce bottle into a pint glass..Pours dark amber with smallish off white head. Aroma comes in a little woody (go figure) but with other earthiness as well due to the hop profile... something that is large in regular bastard as well. I'm not breaking it down any further than that, this beer smells awesome. Like an old baseball glove. Body is light to medium. Flavor is fairly bitter with that sprucy resinous biterness tempered by a heavy maltiness. Ever lingering within the normal hoppiness rides the flavor of the oak, which changes this beer considerably. A must try for all the oak lovers out there"
"This beer certainly has its strong suits, but overall is a very, very solid brew. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is murky dark red with only a quickly fleeting head. The lack of head adds to the lack of power in the nose. Only with deep strong sniffs can you pick up the nice aromas available. The oak is stronger in the nose then in the taste. There is plenty of wood, along with hints of alcohol and the primary warnings of the coming bitterness. The taste is outstanding in the fact that you can really pick out many different flavors. Sweet malts only last a second but they're there. Then alcoholic piney hops upon hops bombard your throat after you swallow. Get ready for some dryness. Big oak backs all the flavors but never takes over. It really compliments it all the way around. Smooth smooth smooth in moutfeel department. Too much dryness for it to be super drinkable, but you could have a couple."
"Two thumbs up from me!!"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a deep orange with a moderate head. This bastard has an oaky aroma with faint wiffs of alcohol. The flavor has oak up front then some citric hops. Oaked bastard has a medium body, average carbonation and is fairly quaffable. The oak mellows this one a bit. IMO I prefer reguall arrogant bastard."
"The Oaked smell invites me into it's smooth taste and flavor. It's color is a beautiful dark amber. It's is a smooth and subtle as a bastard ale will get. There is no overwhelming flavor, just liquid goodness. Stays on my tongue well, it's a great drink. I am highly impressed with this special beer. Great for all times of year!"
"D: Super-refreshing. This is one to enjoy after a hard day's work."
"It has a fuller body and richer more oily mouthfeel, with more caramel and body in the aroma and flavour. However, the malt is more subdued and the hops become less flowery and flavourful but significantly more bitter and astringent. it actually has less overall flavour but more bitterness and more prominent alcohol."
"Drinkability: I really really like this. Unfortunatley I can't comment on the difference between the Oaked AB vs. regular AB, because I've only had the oaked. But I'm looking forward to trying the regular."
"The mouthfeel is purty good. Like I've communicated this far, I don't think this beer has a lot of character. Though I yearn for more flavor as I feel the beer, I can say that I enjoy the feel. Still, I'm determined to write an independent review. Mouthfeel is just better than average. The beer's okay, but I won't follow the first with a consecutive second. Stone is good and oak is good, but this beer is average."
"Very good beer that everyone should try. The original AB by itself is a great beer. This is is complimented perfectly by the sweet woody flavor that is given by the oak aging."
"A good beer from a great brewery.Very bold,if you cant take a punch this beer will knock you right out."
"It is worth trying for sure, but if you'd like a real thing, you should still go for the original ABA."
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel, and surprisingly drinkable for the amount of hops!"
"D- Nice beer to sip on, goes down smoothly, definitely not a session beer."
"pours a nice nice dark brown/ruby color with good lacing thru-out..the smell is earthy,woody,mossy it looks and smells very good...the taste is good not great its a woody/smokey flavor followed by a hop /alcohol taste and rounded out in a carmel/malt finish.. this beer is good and worth a try..its above average but not one that i will buy a sixer of ill stick to singles on this one.. give this one a try"
"Pours a clear, ruby red colored body, with a huge foamy whitish head, frothy and lasting. Soft aroma, some hops but woody & muted. Not too strong. Muted hoppy taste. Woody. Not a bitter aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel. Sweet aftertaste."
"D - I think after one, you'd start to lose the deepness of the flavor, so I wouldn't drink more than one. But, I would drink it all day if I had alot of it."
"How do you round out the bite of the Arrogant Bastard Ale? Oak age it- Outstanding. An absolute pleasure to drink. It's the wiser, older brother to the original. The oak aging really mellows out this hop bite, and leaves a great blend of caramel malts to enjoy. Definitely worth it if you have a few extra bucks"
"Notes: Oak-aged AB is even better than the original! The earthy wood notes add much more depth and makes it much more interesting, especially if you've been drinking the original for a long time. Great hoppy flavor, nice malty presence, and alcohol is masterfully hidden. Just great! Highly recommended"
"Dark amber with a one finger light tan head. Good amount of lacings. Aroma is peachy floral hops. Taste is citrus hops with a touch of oak tannins. Hops are big, malts are supportive but lose the battle for dominance. Proper amount of carbonation, good mouthfeel. Bitter dry finish. Alcohol is well masked. Tasty, hoppy beer."
"I've been eagerly anticipating this one...Poured a cloudy copper color with just a small amount of head that faded quickly without any lacing. Smell is slightly medicinal, slightly sour and kind of earthy, no doubt due to the oaking. I also get a little brown sugar. Wow, the taste is super complex. First hit has some sweetness to it, then a ton of malty body and then bitterness. Not much carbonation, with a lingering finish that is a bit drying. This beer is super smooth and creamy. This is an awesome beer, definitely lives up to the hype."
"The drinkability is this beer's strength, you can drink this until the cows come home if you are stupid enough to do so."
"D - Not a quaffer. Its good and holds its own, but I wouldn't have more than two in a session. If that sour smell went away it would be more drinkable."
"I picked up a 6 pack for 14 bucks, and honestly wanted to hate it... i was honestly blown away. Upon pour I recieved a hint of peach and grapefruit, and upon first taste i was blown away... its hoppy, but its flavor compensates for the overwhelming audacity of its marketing campaign. The notes in the beer cannot be described, and ive seen nothing short of perfection in this Ive had 4, and im pretty toppled... The stone brewery has become a favorite of mine over the years, I expect good things to come, and thank god i can get this beer on the east coast. You can taste the difference between the oak aged, and the regular brew. If you can find it, get at least two sixers... the only problem with this brew is that its hard to find. Upon tasting the first beer, i raised my hands up, and said yes.... yes...."
"Poured from 12oz bottle received in trade with kiefdog. Pours a deep red color with a half finger of off white head that leaves a steady coat of lacing around the glass. Smell is definitely oaky and roasty. Taste is oaky up front but is followed by sweet Belgian-like yeast and malt tastes. It's hard to pick out specific flavors. This beer gets way better as it warms. Pretty thick mouthfeel that really coats the mouth and leaves an oaky aftertaste. Drinkabilty is as good a full flavored strong ale can be. My first beer from Stone and I'm fairly impressed."
"*this past November I was in the area and had the opportunity to visit / tour the Stone brewery. while having lunch at their bistro, i was lucky enough to have a glass of a 2006 Oaked Double Bastard. talk about heaven in a glass..."
"Deep mahogany color with a thick tan head and good lacing. Smells of thick hops, pineapple and a robust roasted malt. First taste is big hops that penetrate the whole flavor, but are mellowed somewhat by the oak. Lots of pineapple and a potent malt, hints of vanilla and a hoppy finish. Easy to drink if you're a hop-head like me, has a nice bite without going overboard. A fantastic variation of a fantastic beer, quite addictive."
"Pours very dark brown with ruby tones. Almost no head. Smell - plums, hint of oak, sweet malts. Taste - bold and bitter hops plus some whiskey-like taste upfront. plum fruitiness with some alcohol. Very bold strong beer, a bit off balance on hoppy side. Full body, semi-dry finish. Very interesting combo of fruitiness, maltyness and bitternes. Very unique. drinkable for ABV."
"D: I really liked this. It grew on me as I drank it. Not a beer to hurry through. Doing that would cut short the complexities that emerge over the whole experience. The oak adds an extra complexity and smoothness to the mix that I really liked."
"Drinkability is a little rough, but that is what stone wants, this no simple beer for the complacent."
"Sublime balance."
"From what I can remember, I like the extra complexity of this beer versus the 'regular' (heh) offering, especially the additional perceived hop components. The oak doesn't change the nature of the base beer, as other oak-aged products seem to show - well, this is Arrogant Bastard we're talking about here, so not much of a surprise, I suppose."
"Probably my favorite tasting beer to date! It pours a maroon/brown color with a two finger head. Smells very sweet like honey, peanuts, and hops. The smell is very pleasant. On first sip, this beer is phenomenal! It's very delicious and tastes just how it smells. It is so smooth! I've never tried the non-oaked AB, but this beer is so good. I am definitely going back to get more!"
"Overall, I'm sad I only had a single, I could have went for 1 or 2 more. Very good beer and if you have to pick between the Oaked A-B and ""standard"" A-B, go with the Oaked. Dangerously drinkable at 7.20%."
"Porus a reddish brown in color with only a small head that is quickly gone. Smell is strong dark malts and the usual Stone hopping. Taste is much the same, but remarkably the oak is really smoothing this beer out. Wasn't expecting that, but it's well done and taste's good."
"Poured a deep amber color with a small light tan head and some light lacing. Smell is deliciously hoppy, some sweet caramel, and some noticeable oakiness. Lots of bitterness in the flavor. Light pine and citrus, but a noticeable hop bitterness rather than hop flavor. Oak gives it a buttery, woody flavor, and slightly more complex and drying than the regular Bastard. Medium full body. Very tasty, nice and bitter, big beer without the overly high ABV. Good stuff, but it's been so long since I had regular Bastard that i can't remember which I like better. But this is damn good stuff."
"MF&D the drinkablilty is still exceptional, but the feel is just a bit thinner that the regular bastard, something that I deem not right for this complex and bold a brew."
"Medium bodied feel on the palate and it is surprisingly easy to drink. It is smoother than regular AB but has a little bit more taste. One of my favorites ."
"Not the first time I've had this beer, but the first time I've reviewed it. Wow, I'll not let any jaded beer drinkers bash this one from Stone. Great stuff."
"Well, what else can I say? This one takes one of our all time favorite beers, and takes it up several levels. Great complexity, and perfectly balanced. What else can you ask for?"
"D- This stuff is so much of an improvement on the regular bastard, it's amazing that by just wood aging it that these flavors can pop out like they do. And at a ""mere"" 7.2% this stuff could make me happy man all night long."
"With the cellaring the beer seemed to improve. Still has alot of oakiness and bitterness. Still tasty, but not my favorite Bastard."
"I don't have the regular Arrogant Bastard handy for comparison, but I believe if I had a choice between the two, I would choose the oaked version. Something about the finish seems more mellow. Very good, one I would definitely get again, but as I said not more than two in a night."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Nothing is too overpowering, as all ingredients work to balance the others. This is my first beer from Stone and it lived up to the hype. I look forward to drinking more."
"Wow, this an amazing beer. I'm really glad I picked this one up, and will be getting this one again. The taste is hard to describe just because its so complex. Truly a great beer. Although somewhat expensive, it is definitely fell worth a try. If you have never tried it at least pick up a single if you see it."
"Found this at a BP for $2 a bottle, yes you heard me right. Since I am such a fan of the regular Arrogant Bastard, I had to pick this up the first time I saw it. Just a bit of piney taste compared to the regular one. I prefer the non-oaked one in fact, but still a very very good beer. For the price, you cannot beat it."
"The Bastard(in any of its forms) is Stone's best year round beer in my opinion, and Worthy of its label.."
"D: Easy drinking and well-balanced. I would definitely have again."
"I think this is a very drinkable brew but at 7.2% I would not be looking for much more than two of these. Great beer to watch the game with a Blue cheese burger."
"This was my perfect beer of 2008. From the beautiful brown that bounces all around the glass to the mouth feel which is heavy enough to know you have something in there but not enough to suggest that you're having a meal. The ABV is in perfect balance with the brew's more earthy flavors. From the first sip to the last there is no wandering of flavor. This beer is in your mouth, to the point, and gone until the next sip. The after taste is pleasant and not a loiterer. You can smell this brew from a foot away though its ABV doesn't suggest how strong it actually was. All in all, I recommend this beer to anyone, and as a guy who cooks everything with beer; I must say that using this to cook would be insulting to its true purpose. Put it in a glass."
"D - This is an easy drinking beer with good balance. Honestly, I don't think this is any better than the regular Arrogant Bastard, but it's a nice change of pace. Another winner for Stone."
"D- Great tasting and relatively easy to drink considering high ABV. Highly recommended."
"Poured an Deep amber coler from an 12oz bottle with an offwhite lacing. Intial nose is sweet woody hops and citrus aroma. Taste is amazing filled with burst of tangy hops, vanilla and spice. Mouthfeel is great with a long lasting oaky finish. Can't put this beer down!"
"Taste: Mmmmm. This bottle is fresher than I thought it would be. Oak and citrus comprise the majority of the taste. This is a really well constructed ale. I wish I didn't already have a buzz going so I could enjoy it more."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice thick head, beautiful amber color with a slight chill haze. Lacing on the glass the entire session. The aroma is of floral hops and an earthy bonque of hops. The taste is fruity sweet, peaches and rose hips come to mind. The body is medium to full and the alcohol is well hidden. After a pint I want more, but I can say the alcohol buzz is now there. There tends to be a smoothier fell to this brew and I can only assume that it is from the oak chips."
"I mean it's a Stone beer; you can't really go wrong. I wouldn't say this was among my favorites from the renowned brewery, but it's certainly worth a try."
"Def. not close to one of the worst beers you can find, but I would say skip it and go for a regular Arrogant Bastard Ale, which is Superb."
"D: Very drinkable beer, much lower abv than I was expecting, but all the flavors blended well and the finish was awesome."
"Drinkability: Solid beer. Tastes like there's more alcohol than the 7.2 ABV, which makes this a sipper. It's too sweet to have more than one. Not bad, but not a beer I'd have too often. I'd be interested to try the normal (non-oak aged) Arrogant Bastard, to see how that compares."
"Finish is smooth, oaky, moderately bitter. Smooth beer for the intensity, well balanced. Yum."
"The oak adds a higher level of smoothness to this brew and increases its drinkability. Definitely one of my go to beers."
"J"
"Another beer brewed by Stone that I love. Although the unoaked arrogant is still an amazing beer this one is definitely worth the money. This beer pours a dark amber. It leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass as you drink it. It has the strong smell of the oak chips that it is brewed with along with the earthy aroma of hops. It is excellent if you sip it slowly and enjoy."
" This beer goes down incredibly smooth. A bit pricey around these parts but worth a try, will not disappoint"
"Notes: Oak aging really brought out some nice intricacies in this beer, I'll be back for more. Chalk up another victory for Stone."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel but the oak flavors is also the thing that disappoints. The finish is kind of dry and chalky leaving that woody flavor all over the palate. Not one of my favorite aftertastes but the rest of this beer makes up for that. Awesome."
"Overall a good beer, would definitely get this again."
"Good body with nice mouth feel and a warming effect from the alcohol."
"Drinkability: This to me is the new standard bearer. I am not a hop head, but wow was I blown away. I will limit how much I drink due to high abv but when I think about this style--here I come."
"D - I could happily drink this beer every day for the rest of my life."
"Since I already reviewed the Arrogant Bastard, I would go into all the same stuff again, only to say that this was almost exactly like the original, with only a handful of vanilla scents and tastes. Overall still a good beer, but not as exceptional as I was expecting."
"The oak flavor was not as apparent as it is in wine (at least to my palate)."
" This is very heavily flavored by the oak, and makes it nearly impossible to drink multiple bottles in a single sitting."
"Overall: Most oaked beers, whether stouts or otherwise, show a lot of oak. Not so this one. The use of oak is masterful, allowing the oak to support the rest of the beer without in any way dominating it. This is an outstanding beer, worthy of seeking out and worth every penny of its not insubstantial price. It is an elite American ale."
"Not a beer for everyone, you will either love it or hate it. It is aggressive, it is arrogant, and to some it could be a bastard. Feels like it could spin out of balance at anytime, but somehow the oak keeps it all held together."
"Big hoppy and grapefruit and wood smell. Oak comes through. Minty flavor. Full bodied, smooth on the tongue. Aftertaste is earthy and lasts forever. Really liked this."
"Overall: The mouth feel is spicy alcohol and slightly astringent and carbonated. The finish is bitter but pleasant. This a great beer has all the components and is very nice to drink. I usually like lagers but this can change your religion. I like that there a subtle hint of oak in the beer, it is over powering at all. I was worried that this beer was going to be heavy with oak and hard to drink I was wrong."
"Notes: if you like hoppy beers you have to give this one a try. either you are gonna love it or its just gonna be ok. not a bad beer but not on my faves list."
"Mouthfeel is good, a little oily on the back of the tongue but it just makes you want to drink more. Which I have no problem with."
"Overall - A bit of a disappointment this one... i love AB but this just wasn't for me..."
"Def not your session beer, but one that I thoroughly enjoyed. Certainly an arrogant bastard if I've ever met one."
"Nice to have just one. A great ale to have with dinner."
"Very good, Stone."
"taste is almost too much oak up front and through the entire sip, but am happy that the hops fought through the malt & oak chip bill to shine through the brew"
"Highly drinkable. This can be quite dangerous because the alcohol can sneak up on a unsuspecting drinker. As I said earlier in my post, this is what Arrogant Bastard should have been."
"Overall, I could drink a few, but definitely not what I'd call a session beer. More like a special occasion beer. Still, a fine beer, but I prefer the original AB much better."
"I would buy this again and hopefully I am arrogant enough to try the regular version of this next."
"Good body with alight mouth feel and a small warming effect from the alcohol."
"Pours a dark murky golden brown with amber red highlights. Frothy 2 finger head with good retention. Wonderful sheets of lacing. A woody vanilla aroma with sweet caramel malts and a hint of fruit like rasins.Flavor is complex,mellow taste of sweet malts and a big of floral spiciness.Big smooth creamy mouthfeel,with a crisp dry hop finish.VERY GOOD"
"Gotta love the Bastard. Kind of the middleweight champion of micro-brews. It does everything well. Dark, almost brown hue. Creamy lasting head. Great creamy and full body. The balance of malts and hops is near perfect. The oak is even a bit nicer than the original. A very unique beer, can't think of another one quite like it (It's almost like a smaller barley wine). Can't wait until the Double Bastard gets to Florida!"
"D. This is a big beer. Its a kick ass beer. Good to sip and I would have to reccommend you let this one get to 50 degrees to really get all the flavors."
"D: The oak chip treatment smooths out the hops flavors, but overall, the differences are small and I'll be sticking with the original article. I like the harshness and the value (at $4.29/22oz bomber it 's a great value)."
"Kudos to Stone for making this available in a 12 oz sixpack...(Please do that with everything else...I don't always want to break a bomber!)"
"On tap at the Stone Bistro. A deep ruby red color with a small beige head. Aroma is hoppy like regular Arrogant Bastard but with a hint of oak and vanilla. Flavor is assertively bitter with plenty of hop flavor malty but not sweet, and still a hint of oak and vanilla. Finish is dry with some lingering bitterness. I really enjoy this beer."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers. Stone Brewery is one of my favorites for pushing the envelope and challenging the accepted ideas of what beer should/could be. I won't go into great depth about this brew other than to say that from the moment i cracked my first to the moment i stumbled to bed, it was a glorious experience. This is a truly beautiful beer to look at. The transparent, red brick color and the fluffy white head made me salivate like a bell at dinnertime and the hoppy, woody smell completely lives up to the bravado on the back of the bottle. If anything, the taste only takes the appearance and smell to another level. I can't say enough good things about this beer. Everytime i drink it, I find something else to love about it. Maybe I'm an arrogant bastard, maybe this is a great beer. Either way, i will never hesitate to recommend it and will always enjoy it. Nasdrovia!"
"D: Picked up a 12oz bottle for $2.67. I would really love to try this one on tap or take on a growler. Perfect day after Christmas beer. Cheers."
"HV"
"One of my favorite beers... Similar to the standard AB, but the oak gives this one a bit of character that is lacking in many beers. Pours reddish brown, with minimal head. Nice sticky lacing and swirls on the top though. The aroma is more malt and earthy wood to me than it is hoppy. The flavor is hoppy, but that just seems like part of it. Arrogant bastard is very hoppy, and it makes no excuses that it is designed to be hoppy, the oaked version just seems to have hops as part of the mix. The malt stands out a bit more, probably because the hops mellow with the addition of the oak aging time. The oaked version of this is a touch sweeter, a lot mellower, and has a bit more character in mouthfeel thanks to the tannins from the wood."
"The oaked bastard is extremely drinkable. I could easily drink several of these with dinner or lunch or all by themselves."
"This is a great beer and well worth seeking out."
"All and all a good beer. Glad I tried it, but I'm guessing this just isn't my style."
"(rated Oct 11, 2008)"
"Aside: I love the marketing...""This is an aggressive ale. You probably won't like it. It is quite doubtful that you have the taste or sophistication to be able to appreciate an ale of this quality and depth."""
"D: This is a strong beer but I would say a sixer of a game of cards makes you a man. but only if you motorcycle home with a cigar in your mouth trailing a shower of sparks. A good cigar masks even this beers odeur."
"Magnum. Finally broke down and bought one, and it was worth it. Pours light mahongany with a ring of foam as the head. The aroma is full of caramel, malt and oak. The taste is phenomenal. The oak tamed the previous Arrogant Bastard, making it seem deeper and mellowed in taste. The malt is sweeter and the hops are more flavorful, but without the bite. Its almost like a scotch finished in a sherry cask. I really hope this one finds a permanent place place in Stone's lineup."
"D: On the whole an excellent, drinkable beer with lots of character. The oak adds a interesting dimension. Very mellow."
"Taste started off sweet... Nice and malty with a great bitter hopp finish. I can't stress enough what the oak adds to this beer. Simply amazing. It had a pleasant mouthfeel as well. I can drink it all night long. Thanks for another kick ass brew, STONE!"
"Rusty red/brown pour, cream like colored head. Smells a little bit like a sweet fruitcake. Taste mixes sweet malty biscuit with some citrus and pine. The bitterness is balanced out with the oakiness. Medium bodied with some good stickiness. I thought this was much better than the regular Arrogant, and worthy of the hype."
"It's really good."
"3.2/5"
"Highly recommended and very drinkable. A repeat customer is born! Now off to find the 3Litre bad boy!"
"Overall a great, great beer that is significantly better on draft. Amazing what they can do with an oak barrel. Pick this beer up if you have the chance, you will not be disappointed."
"Well, it is what it says on the label, an oaked Arrogant Bastard. It is probably unfortunate that I'm reviewing this beer during Double Bastard season. I love the amplified flavors of the stronger version. On the other hand, this beer tones down those flavors with a very refined but strong oak taste. A part of me misses the full bore of the pure stuff. This is a beer to pair against AB and thus appreciate its additions. Paired with Double Bastard (I'm not doing so directly but I've just had a lot recently), the oaked version is just a touch lacking. Then again, this seems to follow the Arrogant Bastard hierarchy. Double Bastard is the best drink to hold while you look down your nose at other beers, but the oaked has a more refined arrogance. It tastes like oak, probably the most arrogant of wood flavors. It's bitter and almost chalky and just dares you not to like it. It's the kind of taste that people tell you that you have to learn to like and, damn it, they're right. The appearance is the cherry on top with the color of an oak-aged brandy and a soapy head with plenty of lacing. It's just a difficult beer to describe without referencing Arrogant Bastard and firmly establishes itself as an even more snobbish version of AB. I mean I love it, but a duck's a duck. My only real thought while I drink it is how the oak really came through. You won't confuse this beer with the normal version. It's the kind of beer to get drunk to while you quietly judge a crowd of people and they come up decidedly lacking."
"It pours a dark reddish brown color, looks amazing in a glass. Leaves a thin head with a fairly good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops with a slight hint of malt. Taste is indescribable. At first it is hoppy, but then a fine malt taste overwhelms on the finish. Exceptionally drinkable. One of the best beers I have had in some time. I will definitely be trying more beers from Stone in the future."
"12oz bottle from Whole Foods in Portland. Pours a hazy copper body with a half inch of light tan head. Lemon, grapefruit, pith, pine, with some woodiness. Tastes citrussy, with pine, pith, lemon, grapefruit, wood, vanilla... Um, cat pee notes? Hints of caramel and toffee in the aftertaste. A little aqueous in the mouthfeel with light carbonation. This beer grew on me, but I must say I was much more impressed with regular Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard. Still, I'd love to try it on tap."
"Drinkability: For lack of a better term, this beer was f-u-n fun to drink. It was extra bitter and that made it worthwhile alone; but yes, this beer has a high drinkability. The ABV is a little high, so I'd likely take it easy and not drink a ton of it, but it was so much fun and such a great taste that it's worth it... So yeah, just make arrangements to get a driver or drink this bad-boy at home."
"Pours a deep brown red with a thin white head, huge streamers of carbonation, and amazing lacing. The smell is surprisingly slight but malty and sweet. The Flavor is vast, reddish, sweet, with cherry, wood, and smoke, like tobacco. The mouthfeel is large and round, viscous and carbonated. The beer has a nice hop bitterness and a deliciously bitter, woody finish."
"My only qualm is that the oak could be a little less to let the base flavors shine through, but other than that, a near perfect oaked beer."
"Sugary fruitiness to open opens up to a slightly creamy, slightly grainy maltiness. Oak tannins are finally apparent and mix well with the notes of vanilla I am picking up here. All of this mixes together as the fruitiness reasserts itself into a wonderfully complex flavor profile. The fruitiness here is not grapefruit or orange or mango, it's not any of these things. The flavor is a bit difficult to describe. The fruitiness is one the sweeter side, vanilla and honey, but nothing overpowering and all blends well with a sweet, underlying oakiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and leaves a long and lasting bitterness down the center of the tongue long after the last drop empties from the glass. Carbonation does not do much for be and could stand to be just the sligthest bit snappier, felt a bit uneven in places, that is to say, I thought the consistency of the beer could stand to be just a bit thicker, more substantive. Other than that I could not put this beer down, it has a beguiling flavor that you can't really put your finger on. The most import thing, however, is that this beer tastes good and that I would be more than happy to try another if I could get my hands on one."
" Drinkability suffers, thin, lack of carbonation, flavors stacked to the bitter side."
"D - Oh so very drinkable. Delicious."
"Lightly hazy, dark brown with a small, tan, creamy head. Good retention and lacing. Smell was rather surprisingly mild. Caramel maltiness, vanilla, just a touch of wood and very light hops. The taste was much more pronounced. Woody roasted malts of front, big citrus kick in the middle, and the oak really shows up on the finish. Great flavors and excellent balance. It has a medium body, resiny texture turning dry, and moderate carbonation. Yes, this is a very good beer, but I don't think it lived quite up to the hype my friends created for me about this beer. Still, defeinitely worth trying though."
"This is really a tasty beer. The woody taste reminds me a lot of the Founders Curmudgeon I drank the other night. Even at $17.99 a six pack this one is a good buy."
"I was curious how this would compare to the original Arrogant Bastard, that I wasn't too crazy about (too much bite and bitterness), but this one had a lot of the good flavor without it being too powerful."
"It poured a dark amer color with some creamy head. The nose was really oaky, but nice. The flavor was a slight oak but not as dry as you would expect from the nose then just lots of hops so you get oak and hops no real malt showing through. Overall its an interesting beer but I would like more malt in there."
"Having this one on Thanksgiving after a good post dinner nap. Pours a pretty dark cherry red with a thin, quickly fading tan head. Some spots of lacing are left behind. Smells of dark fruits (cherries, figs, raisins) hops, and roasted malts. Tastes of vanilla, hops, sweets, smoked wood and toasted malts. A smack of syrup is left on the lips. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied and is warmed with a good alcohol heat. This beer is just one of the many things I have to give thanks for today."
"D- Certainly good. Alc is reasonable and well balanced. Great beer. Bring Stone to Chicago!"
"Thank you for coming to Maine. Served in a pint glass, the beer was a cherry amber color with a thick tan head and some pretty good lacing. It had a nice dark fruit aroma, with a bit of malt. The taste was a nice mix of dark fruit and malt, with a nice hops bitterness at the end. I also felt there was a bit of a vinous taste to it. A thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: Stone puts out some great brews. I admit this was my first experience of Arrogant Bastard not to mention the first oaked beer I have tried. I was and am very impressed by this brew. I look forward to enjoying this beer at every opportunity I get."
"D: All day long. Assuming my wallet would hold up."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very easy to drink without too much carbonation. Doesn't finish too bitter for the high hopping and definitely warms from the high abv."
"D: Ten bucks a six-pack would warrant a special occasion purchase, but something about Stone keeps me coming back for more. The 7.2 abv hits me a little harder than brews of this strength, yet I think I'm on an empty stomach."
"great beer. the balance in such a loud beer is exquisite."
"D - With the high ABV and oakiness of this, I would find it hard to drink more than two or three. Very tasty brew overall! Let this one warm up for a while after taking it out of the fridge - maybe 20 or 25 minutes."
"Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale pours a dark reddish brown with an off white head that laces nicely as it fades. It came in a brown twelve ounce bottle with graphics painted on. The aroma is all about citrusy hoppy goodness. There might even be a hint of oak too, but it's way buried. Citrusy hops dominate the flavor and as it warms the oak becomes more noticeable. Excellent beer, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable brew. Definitely worth the wait while it warmed up. Would seek out again."
"This is my first experience with Stone. Thank you for coming to Florida! I'm looking forward to more of these and sampling the entire Stone line."
"D: THis is one of the most drinkable strong ales ever. It has a lot to do with the oak really making this beer more smooth and the alc. is hidden really well. Thank God this beer is year round now!"
"A nice variation on Arrogant Bastard - as much as I like roadtrippin' to Discount liquors...please Stone, come to Illinois!"
"Feel is standard ale/strong ale, medium body, light carb, refreshing but satisfying. Overall I enjoyed but for the money would buy others."
"Overall impression: This is a great beer! I like it more than the regular Arrogant Bastard, which has been a favorite since I discovered it at the Telluride Blues and Brews Festival five years ago. Of course, Stone hit a marketing home run with Arrogant Bastard, but there is definitely truth in advertising here. ""This is an aggressive ale."" But despite my lack of ""taste or sophistication"" I DO like it. I like it very much"
"This ale is a beautiful deep reddish mahogany, and pours with a fairly thick tan head. Aroma is rich and hoppy with a definite smoky oak overtone. Flavor is almost indescribably delicious - mainly hoppy with malty, nutty, smoky and even sweet hints, and definitely some contribution from the oak chips. Texture is supremely smooth, and leaves a very pleasingly hoppy and smoky aftertaste. A winner!"
"NC BEERMONGER LOVES THIS BEER!"
"It pours a deep mahogany-ruby color with an exceptional head that continues to rise after you are finished pouring. The head is tan and thick and leaves some of the thickest, stickiest lacing I've ever seen. After the head resides, and layer stays above the beer throughout the drink. The aroma is of dark fruit, hops, alcohol, and of course oak...a lot of it too! The taste is more focused on hops with a background character that is still very noticeable of oak and wood. The hop profile is very much of resin and pine...almost sticky in your mouth...it goes great with the smoothness that the oak lends to the brew. Outstanding on tap."
"D: Difficult not to overdrink."
"Drinkability: Regardless of the relatively high ABV, this is easy to drink. Tastes good, nice body, and creaminess. Probably wouldn't go through more than a couple, but its certainly easy to drink. Recommended"
"o: excellent beer. ive not had too many oaked beers of this style and i suspect i may be mistaking the oak flavor with oxidation. fairly complex but ""c" hops are dominant."
"Drinkability: Just as delightful as the non-oaked Arrogant Bastard, though I never felt the oak treatment gave it all too much of a unique distinction, except, unfortunately, in its price tag."
"D: If you can handle the hop/oak flavor/bitterness this is very drinkable"
"Overall, very enjoyable for anytime of the year, and a little drier then I had expected. Nonetheless, a very nice edition of an already great strong ale, I highly recommend giving this a shot."
"This is truly one of the best Strong Ales. Beautiful dark amber color with a nice white head. Taste is quick to announce the oak , malts , hops & woods. Smooth drinker, with a nice mouth feel that is not overwhelming with any one flavor or to heavy. Easy drinker that is not to heavy yet very smooth. Just a great brew all around. Just need the stores to stock it more often here in NY."
"Fantastic beer. I love the regular Arrogant Bastard, and this is even better. Dark maroon/brown with a decent head. Smells and tastes like Stone for sure - HOPS. Bitter and heavy and full of flavor - very complex beer - this is Stone at its best. I've had three 12oz bottles and I feel great. This is great beer."
"Overall, a more complex and smoother version of Arrogant Bastard Ale (which was amazing in its own right). This is a must try if you're a fan of hoppy, strong ales."
"A really good beer, but tastes like something I've had before.."
"This beer pours dark cherry amber with a creamy cappuchino colored head that leaves a nice film over the beer and leaves a bit of lace. The aroma smells of caramel, toasted and honey malts along with musty woodiness and faint floral hops. The taste is up front with the malt characteristics of caramel, toast, and honey but the beer then gives way to the oak characteristics before finally finishing with a piney hop characteristic. The beer also displays a medium-full mouthfeel with a subtle carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I would like to see a more potent hop characteristic like the regular Arrogant Bastard, but the oaked version pleases nonetheless."
"This is a really good beer. It is a bit different from the original, but if I wasn't told it was oak aged I don't know if I would be able to tell that that is what was different."
"It's been a long time since I've had a beer that was truly unique, and this one is it. Pours nice and dark, and the oak on the nose is absolutely wonderful, nice creamy head. The first sip is oak and Hops fighting for control at the same time, it's so nicely balanced it's a tie, and the hop finish is complete. A very heavy Ale and I would guess it would be easy to bugger this combination up, but Stone has out done themselves. A truly fantastic ale, in a league of it's own. The only negative is this is a one bottle at a time kinda ale, I can't see sitting around and draining 5-6 of these. That's not much of a negative, but this one is a must try, and cannot help but love experience."
"D - I would gladly make this a session beer of choice against most others."
"Drinkability- Lots and lots, I want more."
"This is good stuff, lives up to the hype. I think I liked this a bit better than regular AB."
"Exceptionally smooth with silky carbonation, Stone's Oaked Bastard is a fine evolution of its 'regular' Bastard brother. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy - a great consistency. Slight carbonation. I truly enjoy this - but probably after a few may be overwhelmed by the hop after taste. Overall, a great, big, arrogant beast."
"Grapefruit is the major player up front as the oak and smoke covers the back end fully and tastefully. Mouthfeel is smooth and carries the heavy flavors matchlessly. Some sweet, whisky like wisps is the back end of the taste. This is exquisite stuff, not for amateurs. Absolutely first class. I would love to try this on tap."
"D - To be honest, I can't see myself drinking more than one of these in a single sitting. It's a damn good beer, but the spiciness of it is a bit much for me. I definately prefer the non-oaked Bastard over this one."
"Highly quaffable, and decidedly delicious. I expected more of a woody, oakiness to be present, but sadly (or perhaps not so sadly, I don't really know for sure) the oak didn't show itself overtly. Still, a beautiful ale and an equally beautiful drink."
"I enjoy Arrogant Bastard as is but I think the oak barrels and the aging makes for a much more complex and delicious beer."
"drinkability is good. this is a mildly subtle, yet complex brew with a wonderful malt smoothness and at the same time a solid hop bitterness. somewhat of a paradox in comparing opposites within the same profile, this brew walks that line while remaining satisfying and drinkable. many others have failed where this brew seeks its solace; in the no-mans-land of sweet and bitter, of malty and hoppy. the balance of an ESB with assertive hop quality and warming malt complexity. cheers!"
"Pours a handsome mahogany color, minimal tan head fades somewhat slowly, leaving a few scattered dots of lacing in the glass. Rich malty aroma, sweet/thick caramel smell, and just a hint of smokiness. Some sweet citrus flavors, slight grapefruit bitterness, but definitely a malt-heavy brew, robust and rich, and again, just faint hints of smoke/wood. Medium-bodied, I think I might like this one just a tad thicker, but it still works well...also some great lingering bitterness on the back and sides of the tongue. Drinkability really surprised me here....I want another one. Now."
"Is it really arrogance if it due the respect? My latest sampling from the Stones Brewing company. This beer is something else. The beer smells florally, hops and malts present. Taste is bittersweet with a good blend of hop and malt and a bit of taste of brown sugar. It has a fairly thick feel on the tongue full body. If it wernt such a pricey beer there'd be nothing keeping this bastard on the shelves, definitely one you could do more then one of and it's not too high in the alcohol to make it too overwhelming. Definitely a darn good beer."
"D - this is great beer. Definitely one that merits drinking slowly and enjoying. My first offering from this brewery and I was very pleased. I would love to try more if only I could get anything else from this brewer either in Missouri or Illinois..."
"D: Oaked AB is relatively drinkable because it's smooth, complex, and tasty. I'm a huge fan of this beer, and I look forward to buying some more soon."
"I enjoyed this beer, but there is something about it that isn't quite there."
"All in all this was a solid beer. What else should one expect from Stone?"
"D - highly drinkable, a 'must try' for all beer lovers."
"D- Not a terribly sessionable brew, but definitely a nice beer that wouldn't be a bad idea to seek out if you've never had it."
"My first Stone has pleased me greatly and I look forward to enjoying more of their work! They're lucky, after that shot at my self esteem on the bottle..."
"Drinkability is very good. I finished this beer much to faster than I should have at that point in the night, but I had a very easy time doing it. Definitely give this bad boy a shot."
"Drinkability: This isn't my type of beer because of the strong hops bitterness, but I could definitely see the quality of this brew in the taste and mouthfeel elements."
"Very satisfying. It's ""extreme"" without getting ""ridiculous"". I loves me some Stone and I'm so glad I can now pick this up whenever I want."
"there is a definate signature taste. I think it is a very well crafted brew..i would recomend it"
"it pours a red amber color with a nice big brown tinted head. good lacing too. the nose is dark cherries, roasty malts, slight sour oak. the taste is oaky, dark cherries, roasted malts, bitter as hell! medium body, low smoothe carbo, a very smoothe brew. This brew makes me wanna eat oak aged babies!"
"Excellent!"
"Bottle - Pours a cloudy reddish/brown - unappealing, not pretty to look at. Ok, I'll say it, It is ugly. Smells of deep fruits and lots of alcohol. The aroma is complex with honey and pear battling a ton of other notes all screaming to be heard. First sip is tangy/bitter - also complex. There is a whole lot going on here. The oak really makes this 7.2% ABV beer seem a ton stronger. An intriguing complex ale that is spicy, bitter, and tangy. You have my attention."
"Every time I have had this beer it's been good but this particular bottle however old it is, is a bit more interesting to me since the hops don't quite knock me over the head as is the case with most hoppy beers these days."
"d: the more I drink of it, the more I want another. The taste grows on you."
"Drinkability: Very interesting and tasty, and not as ""arrogant"" as expected."
"I haven't had Arrogant Bastard in years, but figured I'd try this oaked version on tap at Monk's Kettle in case my tastes have changed. Let's see...nope. Still tastes like the absurdly over-hopped Arrogant Bastard I remember. No balance at all. Just pure hops. Maybe I'll try it again a few years from now."
"I haven't had the regular Arrogant Bastard, but I am a fan of the Oaked version."
"Sampled from a 12oz bottle. I'd like to experience it in a bigger bottle; it grew on me right up to the last sip and I want more. Someday."
"D- outstanding overall, but for some reason i enjoy the bite of the regular version of this beer better, but dont get me wrong, this one isnt bad either!"
"D: Highly drinkable, this will definitely be a stalwart in the fridge as I prefer six packs vs bombers. The standard Bastard is great but this is even better."
"4.0 D: Excellent beer. I would argue that aging it does make it better for most people. The biggest difference between a fresh one and an almost year old one is the aftertaste. In the fresh OAB, the woody aftertaste is even stronger than the beer taste. I personally like that about the beer, but it decreses its drinkability. The aged one has a more subdued aftertaste which is more palatable for most people."
"Arrogant Bastard itself is a great beer. Oaked Arrogant Bastard is that much better."
"Top-notch, just like the ordinary AB, but probably not worth the 50% premium price they put on top."
"D= This was a very interesting beer. I apprciated the oak flavors playing against the malt sweetness and the big hop biterness. No much to complain about but I do think this beer would benefit from further aging."
"I'm going to need a bigger fridge."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a rust color with brown tint to it and a nice fluffy head that leaves nice thick lace on the glass. Smell is a hoppy resin, biscuit and also a bit of caramel in the nose, also nice notes of vanilla and wood. Taste is very sweet with a nice sweet hop finish, overall I can't detect much of the oak in this one, but I can detect the roasted malty character of this brew. Overall this is another awesome offering from Stone, I can't wait till I can purchase this in Florida, I am hearing very soon."
"Can't Recommend this enough"
"D: Well-crafted and much preferred to the non-oaked variety. Deceptively drinkable considering the high ABV."
"By my count, there should still be four more of these suckers at the store, and if I have it my way, at least one more will be mine. I can't wait to have it again. Great beer."
"Deep amber color with a somewhat lumpy, inconsistent head. Aromas of pine and fruit cocktail. The taste is very good, toasty caramel layered over with pine, fruity, and oak notes. Creamy rich body. A lot of fruitiness on the finish with more woody notes coming through late. Distinctive without being outrageous. Recommended."
"I don't know why these guys of the Arrogant line are so Arrogant, I've never had a beer of this line that was anything better than okay."
"A drinkable beer, but in low quantities, not one I would want more then one or two of."
"D- For the drink and the experience, it is very nice. A session beer it is not. I like it and will make it a staple in my fridge if we get this offering in my area."
"A pricey 6-pack. When will Stone make an arrogant bastard English style mild ale? Huh? I didn't realize English Mild was too American-Mass-Market for them. Or maybe their palette is not sophisticated enough."
"Crimson hues with a light tan head. Would like to see more lacing and retention. Aroma consists of spicy hops, vanilla, malt and oak. The taste is hoppy to the extent of being a little too bitter for my liking. The aftertaste is also too acidic and is actually giving me some wicked acid reflux. Oak and vanilla can also be found in the flavor, but are almost silenced by the bitterness. The mouthfeel is the best part of this entirely cocky beer. Characterized by a smooth creaminess and perfect carbonation. However, I found the bitterness and astringency of this one to be a little overpowering, thus limiting the drinkability. I personally prefer regular AB."
"drinkability: high"
"The oak chips are really noticeable, even more so than I thought and definitely adds a different element to the beer, although AB itself is one damn fine beer. Hazy deep amber color with a nice tan head with lacing. Aroma is oak, vanilla, fruit (cherries?) and roasted malt and this part is more enjoyable than the original. I get the wood chips right away in the flavor with some smoky malts, a little sweet and tart with a dry hop finish. Seems perhaps a bit more mellow than the original AB which is probably the aging. I may prefer the standard AB, which is a little more in your face but they are both excellent and very well done."
"A nice beer from Stone..."
"Pours a deep amber orange color with a big beige head that remains for the entire beer. Nice lacing. The aroma is of wood, tropic fruits, citris and just a hint of oak. The flavor is very floral, malty, piney and oak. Medium body, average carbonation. Long dry woody finish."
"The oak aging smoothes this monster out, blends the flavors and adds new ones. Awesome brew. Superior to the regular Bastard, which is one of my favorites."
"I feel bad not giving this beer a higher rating. Stone has consistently been one of my favorites, but I think my tastes are leaning toward different styles now."
"Guess I'm far far too uncultured to notice a huge difference. Still a great beer and an excellent birthday morning celebratory drink."
"Overall this is a good beer. I was disappointed by the lack of (or my perceived lack of) oak taste and aroma. Drinkability is average, but then again I am not a huge hop lover so for those who are or who don't mind them it may be higher. Recommended!"
"Solid one finger sand colored head. Great lacing that bands to my glass and great retention too. Appealing color of hazy amber with orange highlights. Fantastic aroma dominated by floral hops, grapefruit and some malts underneath. Deeply complex and yet drinkable. Malt flavor is forward, then hop bitterness and finally an oak finish. Medium/light carbonation. Exceptionally smooth with a great mouthfeel. Top notch brew in every way and maybe even better than the original (it is slightly more enigmatic). Continues to develop as it warms and a must-try for all beer aficionados."
"Whenever I find this I will buy this!"
"a very good beer."
"D- Yes please!"
"Drinkability is quite low due to the high ABV. I would definitely search this beer out again though but it's not high up on my list as I wouldn't be able to drink anything else for the night after one of these."
"D - Alcohol is well hidden."
"Alcohol is masked very well and I could have a few of these without flinching."
"Overall, pricey yet well-executed idea by Stone. Not a daily drinker, but a nice treat."
"Alas, I am still not a fan of the Oaked Bastard on cask either, but for completely different reasons. Where I found the bottled version to be too tight and overly strong with the wood taste and feel, I found the cask to actually be a nicer balance of wood to hops and malts. The head was better and lasted quite a while for a cask. But the biggest problem here is that I think that Bastard is a a beer in any form that has to be served cold. Many beers are fine (or even better) at room temperature, but Bastard is not one of them (IMHO). Overall, as I said before, the balance of elements was better on this one than other Bastards, but that still doesn't mean that it is well balanced across the horizon of all ales."
"Pretty drinkable for the ABV."
"This made my top 10 list of beers."
"A large off-white head. Very creamy with excellent lacing. The overall appearance is quite intimidating, a murk dark brown/red. The aroma is great, a sweet hoppy mollasses with a light doughy scent. The palate on this beer took me off guard, I was expecting a kick your ass alcohol taste, but instead I got a medium body with very soft carbonation. The flavor was very sweet and the alcoholic finish didn't last 2 days like the Ruination IPA did."
"It has been some time since I tried the regular Arrogant Bastard but I remember it being much different. The oak really adds a lot of complexity, but at the same time takes away from the spotlight a lot of the character that I liked about the regular. Can't see myself drinking more than one of these in a sitting but either way, good stuff."
"This American Strong Ale poured a medium amber color from the firkin. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is caramel malt, earthy hops and a bunch of oak. A medium to full bodied American Strong Ale. The malts are caramel and fruity. The hops are grapefruity and floral. The oak flavors are mostly in the back end and the finish. Yeah it's double bastard and all that implies, but the oak aging has mellowed the beer a little, the oak and malts go well together here. Another beer that does very well as a live firkin ale. Very smooth taste. Nice soft carbonation. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is bitter."
"12oz brown bottle from asix pack I purchased while visiting DC this summer. Pours a hazy meduim brown with a creamy 2 finger head, great longevity and beautiful lace. Lovely citrus hop aromas, but not overwhelming. Behind the hop is a just right malt smells mixed with a hint of yeast. Upon the first sip, the creaminess of it is beautiful. The initial malt flavors fade somewhat quickly into the hops. IMHO the hops a bit sharp. Nice bitterness in the aftertaste. It could stand some aging to completely smooth it out but it is still an excellent beer."
"Taste, mmmm... Its definitely of AB pedigree, but the oak aging settles it down a bit, providing some tannins and vanilla, the slightest hint of wood. I'm not going to say it has refined AB, but it seems a bit more complex, shady, more an enigma, if possible. The hops are hefty and well oiled, the mouth is hefty and lively, and the joy, its a great drinkin beer. Everything is quite excellent, perhaps just not exquisite."
"This was everything I thought it would be and more. The pour was a semi-cloudy dark red colour with a thick, tightly knit sand coloured head. Head was easily a finger and a half, perhaps two fingers thick and stayed in place for some time. It looked like something out of an ad, really. Smell was dominated by hops. Period. However, it was a sweet smell, and not sweet malt, though malt was present. The only other beer I can think of right off that had this powerful sweet hops smell is 3F's Dreadnaught. I have had several brews that had that, but only those two so assertively. Taste, too, is commanded by hops, with little noticeable malt (to me, I know it's there, though). This is certainly a brew for the hop lover. I'm not a huge American hops fan, but I still appreciate and enjoy this immensely. Mouthfeel is fairl heavy, but right where it needs to be IMO. A fine ale, indeed."
"Oakey Dokey, the bastard has busted my balloon knot. As if the motherfucker wasn't nasty enough, now he takes a bath in oak tea! He wears a polluted cloud of a head, and a subsiding period of a dress. Burnt caramel covered shards of dock wood splinter the tongue. Burnt Sugars become slightly bitter over cinnamon swirl toast. The sonofabitch offers me a slice of vanilla ice cream cake at the end with no reach around in sight. I'm rollin with the bastard goddamit, and your ass is smellin sweet!"
"Great Beer."
"Very complex taste. Loads of hops that are citrusy and herbally. Big malt backbone with sweet caramel, and a touch of vanilla from the oak and a fruity aftertaste. Goes down very easy. A damn good beer. Too bad its not available here and this is my last one from a trip to Vegas."
"Drinkability: The richness of this beer, not to mention the price tag do not exactly meld with a session type beer, but I could easily drink myself into a cashless stupor with this one. Worth the hype."
"Drinkability: Deceptively drinkable if you're a fan of hoppier beers. No cloying aspects to this brew. Just a spotlight/showcase of an already great beer in the Arrogant Bastard."
""
"M/D - A creamy and smooth feel and very drinkable. Alcohol is surprsingly well masked given the higher ABV."
"Drinkability- A very tasty spin on an old classic!! Highly recommended to all the Arrogant Bastard Lovers!"
"I drink it everyday ... one a day. JUst what you would expect from Oaked AB. Fantastic."
"D-The more I drank the more the oak came through and might discourage drinking more than 2. But I sure would enjoy those 2! Really like this beer."
"The ale poured a deep amber red into my English Pint Pub glass, forming a good sized, rocky head that quickly dissipated. What little aroma there was brought to mind warm caramel, very malty. Taste is where this brew surprised me. In contrast to its sibling's smack you in the head assertiveness, OAKED Arrogant Bastard presents a well-blended sum of its substantial parts. A strong, caramel, malty backbone blends subtly with the hops. There is a faint undertone of oak that ties together the disparate parts in a chewy, dare I say smokey, harmony. For as strong an ale as this is, you certainly don't feel it. It might be better to call this a sneaky bastard."
"The mouthfeel is very slick. I probably wouldn't have many due to the extreme dry bitterness, but that's just me."
"I really want to try the unoaked version of this beer. I have a feeling I really will like it!"
"The oak aging did wonders for the taste. I love the original, but this version is much tastier. If you ever get a chance pick one up. As of August 2007 they are creating this brew year round, so hopefully you will be able to find one in your area."
"A dark fruit taste mixed with some oakiness hit my tongue first. There is some sweetness in there, caramel I believe, and the hops do come through although not as powerful as some other Stone BC brews. A medium-bodied beer, full is stretching it, that goes down extremely smooth and hearty. I have to have this again."
"Drinkabiliy is not high for me since it is pretty strong on the taste buds but the oak does make it smoother and more complex. A good one to try no doubt."
"Oak aging adds complexity and balance outshining the original Bastard."
"D: A good drink by itself. A little to sweet to drink in multiples but was very wine like and should be sipped and savored like one."
"I don't like the marketing of this beer. The whole ""you won't like this beer it's too complex for you"" approach doesn't work for me. I wanted to not like this beer, but, it's really good and I like it."
"This version of the bastard is amazing. Hands down! I love the regular bastard, but this really blows the regular bastard away. The pour is a little darker than the chestnut brown it's more rich. Not quite a brown, but not a chestnut brown. It has a two finger tan head that wacks your nose with an oak and grain smell. You can also catch the hops and malts, but the oak is the dominant. The taste is amazing. Almost like the bastard, but with the oak flavor sealed in. The oak gives this beer more of an earthy feel. The mouthfeel is hoppy and smooth. Again if you love hops, the drinkability is great!"
"Drink em' if ya got em'"
"D: Very nice brew from the fellows over at Stone. Similer to DFH Immort IMO but just not as strong. The woodyness limits the drinkibility in my case, but none the less a fine selection. Skal."
"Parks a dark amber, good clarity, and a half inch of off-white, dense head. Aromas lean towards the pine, woody hop notes, with the oak taking a brighter stance (like fresh cut wood), than most oaked beers. The smell of a pine sapling is just overwhelming everything else. Though, it is quite nice. On the palate, the chinook hops really dominate and that signature pine like smell transfers over to the mouth as well. There is certainly oak in this beer given is sweet vanilla flavors. I think this style certainly is well served with oaking and it really compliments it. Overall, I'd say I have to prefer this to the regular AB. Unfortunately it's quite cost prohibitive."
"D: This is a solid beer, but so far, has been the most disappointing Stone beer I've tried. I wanted knock-you-socks-off good ... this was merely good."
"D: This one you can drink all night. Amazing what a little oak does for this beer."
"D: This is a very good beer and I get the subtle differences between the original, but it's not my favorite representation of the style."
"Overall, a very, very good brew. The oak brings the AB craziness down a notch, and makes one of the most well-balanced extreme beers I've ever had."
"The oak does not come through immediately in the taste. It starts out similar to normal arrogant bastard, with the malts hitting you upfront and the bittering hops coming through strong. The finish though is what really distinguishes it. The oak really comes through on the finish and lingers nicely along with the alcohol. It has a nice medium mouthfeel, which fits nicely with the style, and the carbonation is appropriate, giving it a nice mouthfeel. It is definitely an enjoyable beer, but I'm not completely sure if it is worth the extra cost over the standard AB."
"I was very impressed with my first Oaked Arrogant Bastard. It's strong in all areas, and I especially appreciate its color. Now I'm really eager to try regular A.B. It was a great break from all the uber-hopped beers of late as the malt and oak aging characteristics really shined on this one."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is moderate, but flavor is fairly strong. It definitely drinks easy, but mass consumption is definitely limited."
"AB is the watermark for hop-focused (but balanced) strong ales. I don't really see the oak doing a lot here, but there are some nuances where it comes through. Regardless, it is delicious."
"notes: I love this beer, the malt in this beer is so round and the hops clean up so nicely, it sits so nicely on the pallet at the end and the aftertaste is very enjoyable as well. This beer is absolutely fantastic."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic glass, wow pours a deep copper color with a one inch light brown head that disappears and leaves a layer of lacing on the glass. Their is a nice citrus nose with some caramel malt that leaves a faint oak scent. At first you can taste the malt with some caramel then quickly goes over to the citrus hops and finish dry and leaves a pleasant bitter aftertaste with a hint of oak. Nice carbonation that goes down easily and leaves only a slight oily feeling on the tongue. If this beer wasn't so expensive I could drink a lot of these, excellent beer."
"Very drinkable due to the oak - rounds it out, some soft sweetness, chalk & vanilla come through (in a good way), and finish is balanced as well."
"M/D - Fabulous, bitter aftertaste. Smooth going in, neither syrupy or watery. Plenty of flavor in each sip. Just enough complexity to have some fun while sipping, but the characteristic flavor never wavers."
"I really like this beer. Nice to have a wood aged beer that is not a stout or aged in a liquor barrel. The oak is perfect with this beer, does not overpower and adds some mellowness and complexity. Great beer."
"Pours a reddish color with plenty of sparkling bubbles throughout the body. Head is a rich color of off white with plenty of frothy, creamy foam sitting on top of this sparkling beauty. Aroma is ripe with rich fruit notes, and plenty of woodsy flavors. Smell is hop strong, but has a relaxed feeling with all the oak textures that come through. Taste is very delicious with plenty of malt sweetness mixed with a vanilla hoppy experience. Mouth feel is incredibly silky smooth for such an IPA treat."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, nice kick, I always have high expectations for Stone beers and they have yet to disappoint me, with this beer I was very interested to see what difference the oak aging would make on an already great beer. It seems to me that it took a little bit of the harshness out and made an excellent beer even better."
"Oily hop resin and a bit of a cloying mouthfeel.I like big IPA's, but this is not as drinkable as I would like. I'm a fan of Stone, but this is just a bit too strong and the drinkability really isnt there."
"D- This is the second time I have tried this beer and both times I have thought that the wood chip aspect was just too much. Worth a shot for sure though."
"This is a beer that I could make an evening out of - several of these with good cheese with friends and good conversation - doesn't get much better."
"Great beer!"
"I am very glad I picked up another sixer in Colorado as this is a damn tasty beer. I intend to age some of the other bottles and see how they turn out as well. On that note, I had taste of a 4 year old magnum of Oaked AB and it was amazing."
"Now this is an American strong ale. Big, bold, and completely out there."
"D: so good, but a little too hyped. very smooth and drinkable."
"Overall this was to me, an average beer at best. My review for the Double Bastard was well below the ""average", and I'm sure this one will be as well. I just didn't get much enjoyment out of this beer. Adding to that, it's about twice as expensive as their ""regular"" Bastard, so I'd have to say I found it to be one of the worst ""bang for the buck' beers I've had in a long time. To each his own I suppose."
"D- At 7.2% I'm not sure I could have too many of these, but it definitely worth it. Complimented my meal quite well."
"Its full of unique flavors and is a drinking experience unlike most others. If I had to choose, I would go for the original since I am more partial to fresh hops than I am to barrel aged whiskey/bourbon tastes. Have your own taste test sometime and find out if you're ""worthy""."
"D- Very drinkable on tap. The relatively thin body goes down easy"
"Overall- A great brew for a beer fanatic. As Stone writes ""You're not worthy"" -fans of macros and milder brews will have a hard time adjusting here. For me? Complex, big, and delicious."
"D: Complexity and intricacy is through the roof. This beer is flat out fantastic. Such a smooth taste, didnt think the AB could be improved on. Not too strong to not be able to enjoy several."
"Drinkability: It takes a minute to get used to, but this might go down even more easily than Arrogant Bastard. The oak helps to balance the other flavors, and while I don't think this is quite as good as the original beer, I'd definitely like to keep a few of these on-hand for the occasional taste. Fans of the original brew should give it a shot."
"Better than the regular Arrogant Bastard, which is just one dimensionally hop-dominated. At least this has the vanilla flavors of the oak to save it from totally mediocrity. This would be a really good beer if Stone could just have held back about half the hops they put in."
"I tried this immediately following the standard Arrogant Bastard. It poured almost identically, with a dark and clear auburn color with thin light tan head. It smelled very similar too, with lots of warm citrus hops mixed with caramel malt. It tasted the same at first, with the strong orange and pine hops blended with caramel malt, but it also had a noticeable oak flavor blended in. It felt about the same as the original, watery with slight carbonation, and a smooth clean aftertaste with strong bitterness (and oak). Overall this took a great beer and made it even better, with a more unique and balance flavor."
"12 oz bottle from New Beer on Chrystie St in NYC. Very hazy, if I remember much more hazy than the regular Bastard Ale, lots of tan head with huge lacing. Lots of malt in the smell, I somehow expected to smell the oak, but it's kind of hard to distinguish. The taste really blew me away. Some raisins, roasted malt sweetness, followed by the familiar Bastard Ale bitterness and the oak character coming through. I really like the regular Bastard Ale, but I think this is even better. The aging really mellowed it out, it's got a great smooth character, wonderful mouthfeel, wonderful finish that lasts and lasts. Really fantastic beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a large light tan head that possesses very good retention and lacing. The aroma is malt with some oak character along with some piney hops. The taste features a very nice malt backbone with some oak and a bitter hoppy finish. Overall, this yet another stellar offering from Stone, and I would highly recommend it!"
"Drinkability: Complex yet smooth, I found myself gulping rather than sipping and constantly wanting more. Another very impressive offering from my favorite brewery."
"D: A treat... enjoyed it and it can easily be recycled for two glasses in a row."
"Drinks real nice, very great beer, a good sipper. As it warms up, the flavors come alive."
"D- I enjoyed this a lot. Stone has made a really classy and drinkable beer here."
"Overall: I didn't realize until after I poured that it was past the best before date, and if it had came out badly I wasn't going to review it. But even with the date it was still quite tasty. I will pick up a fresher bottle sometime in the future, and if there are appreciable differences I will note them here."
"Drinkability is rather high, although the complexity begs savoring, not slamming. Definitely better then original Arrogant Bastard IMHO, I'm not sure why I let this sit in the back of my cellar for so long before busting it out tonight, a few months old served at cellar temp."
"I paid $15.99 for a six pack. Yes, cheaper than a bar, but still a costly endeavor."
"D - A bit much for daily drinking, and I don't really taste much if any oak. Worth a try, but not anything supper special."
"An improvement over the regular ABA, if I could have imagined such a thing being possible. A true ""beer experience," but again, not for the faint of heart. This is a very complex sipping beer, to be savored and enjoyed in a relaxed environment. So grab your favorite snifter, that velvet smoking jacket you've been looking for an excuse to wear, and take a load off - this beer's that good."
"Tasted on 3/8/08."
"One of my favorite beers. Highly recommended."
"d- not too heavy, higher alcohol, hops linger good could not drink too much"
"Just found this beer at my local pick a pack (Omega Pizza at 22nd and South, Philly--well worth a visit for good selection, decent food, and friendly staff, by the way). Threw it in at the end instead of a Philly Pale and very glad I did. Amber color, not a lot of head, but a big hoppy/oaky nose and a full mouth. This is a big beer with mucho character. A touch dry, but this did not take away from its delivery. Because of its bigness and its 7.2%, not an ideal session beer. Definitely a new regular though. Highly recommended."
"I've always thought that aging was nice but not really worth the price. This one might be an exception. It's quite nice. I love Stone brews."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep red - almost looks like a barleywine. Smells like orange peel and alcohol. Can't quite pick anything out of the nose or from the taste. Taste is relatively complex. Very well balanced between the malts and the hops. It's definitely not as hoppy as I though it would be. Overall, a very solid brew."
"Enjoyed this beer on 1/25/08. Poured a very dark copper with a thin brown head. Bubbles cling to the side of the glass the the head falls. A bit fruity in the nose, with some sweeter overtones. Not as much hoppiness as I was expecting, but it wasn't overbearing, which is a plus. Had some overtones that reminded me of baker's chocolate, as well as some smokiness. The body was a bit more on the heavy side, and there was a bit too much carbonation. I probably couldn't drink more than one at a time, but I could see it being paired quite nicely w/ some Ben & Jerry's."
"Drinkability- Not greatly drinkable. There was once a time when I could go to a bar and drink nothing but the bastard, but I think time has run it's course on me and no longer will the bastard set me free. I love other beers from stone, but arrogant has eluded me in my old age. Even on oak and with age, I can't say that this is the best beer in town anymore."
"Not difficult to drink a few of these. I remember when I worked at a restaurant that had this on tap (briefly). People who didn't like the regular ABA loved the Oaked ABA. It took some of that initial harshness out of the beer. Both beers are great though."
"Here's another epic beer from the brewers at Stone Brewing Co. out in California. It poured into my crystal tasting snifter with a nice foamy head that quickly dissipated. There was a good bit of lacing on the inside of the glass. The aroma was nice and woody along with a fresh pinch of hops. The oak chips do a wonderful job of drying out the initial A.B. The taste is sublime, a mellow mixture of vanilla and toffee with a nice hop bitterness. This is a truly awesome brew worthy of trying. The only question is, are you worthy of trying it?"
"Overall, this is a nice brew. It's very rich and complex. Another fantastic Stone product."
"D: Very pleasant brew with a complex and varied taste, outstanding appearance, and excellent mouth feel. It is a bit overhopped for my taste but like other Stone products this beer balanced a massive hop presence with other strong flavors."
"D - A very slow drink... One would be my limit..."
"Very unique twist on what is probably one of the best beers out there....Arrogant bastard. Must try for any Stone fan."
"Drinkability, as with the traditional ABA, depends on one's tolerance for hops malt & yeast which knock you over the head with their presence. For myself, and many others, it's a much-welcome presence in the beer world."
"Almost thinner bodied seaming to its regular counterpart. Still reddish brown, with a somewhat muted dryly-sweet malt smell and light hops. Taste though was lighter, more muted, and much dryer and chalkier, especially in respect to the bitterness. The oak seems to have magnified the things I didn't like about the original. Not for me."
"D - The mouthfeel really throws off this beer. I really like the regular one though."
"Appearance is dark brown with a moderate amount of foam. Smells of oak and spices. Taste was somewhat disappointing; the oak flavor dominates everything else. There was a bit of spices, maybe some cinnamon in there, but overall the flavor was on the weak side aside from the oak. It's hard to believe this is the case with a Stone beer, who make some of the best I've tasted, but this one wasn't all that impressive. It was OK to drink while taking my time, but I wouldn't have wanted another one anytime soon."
"D: Great beer that is dangerously drinkable."
"D - A boozy and intensely oak flavored ale, bery tasty w/ plenty of hops and flavor, yet not the most drinkable beer for my taste. This was paired w/ a salad my brother made w/ tons of ginger and lime w/ cilantro and scotch bonnets. There was also a garlic aioli w/ raw egg dijon mustard and chives with redskin roasted potatos- which was even more intense when paired w/ this ale. My brother tried to burn my mouth w/ a fiery orange habanero in the dressing and the oaked bastard seemed tame next to his full-on ginger lime dressing."
"As i move it around in my mouth it feels like a party of malted hops and barley is exploding my mouth. A great creamy feeling flows down my throat. I can still taste the beer in my mouth 30 seconds to one minute later. A great beer. I would love a case of this to store."
"Drinkability is great. But for the alcohol content, I could drink these all night."
"Again, I really like this beer. I pick up the oak immediately, but think that its too ""raw"" Its almost like chewing on an oak chip. If you favor a good whiskey, check this stuff out."
"Okay, it's a nice beer and fun to compare to the original. Definitely recommended to try, but for me it probably won't repeat in my fridge too often - especially for the price."
"D- another solid beer from stone, i really like the oak flavors but the ageing on the arrogant bastard makes that part a little worse but it is still a great beer"
"D- I really enjoyed this beer but it was definitely a sipper. A nice beer to savor with a little time on your hands to pick up all the subtle nuiances."
"d: yes this beer is very drinkable"
"D: Another home run by Stone. I love Stone Brewery!!!"
"Aroma is moderate hops of equal parts flowers and grapefruit. There is also oak, vanilla and something peppery to the smell. Pours a quite nice amber-red with a creamy head. The appearence gets a 5 from me for the absolutely outstanding lacing. Taste is nice subtlely bitter hops. Good. Goes down well with a creamy texture and soft carbonation. Will buy again."
"A very tasty American strong ale. I'd like to try it against the regular arrogant bastard just to get a real feel for the oak. Highly drinkable and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Drinkablility: I managed to handle only a few of these before it was just too much (which was probably for the best). Definitely a good beer for people wanting to try out the subtleties of what oak can do to a beer."
"This was a perfect celebratory beer after my alma mater Saint Joseph's routed villanova by 22. Perfect."
"D: I could probably drink this until I couldn't stand. Big improvement over the already tasty original."
"Taste is mainly contributed by the hops, strong piney bite, woodiness comes through, no doubt contributed from the ""oaked"" aspects, good bitter aftertaste that makes you pucker."
"enjoyable, though i think i prefer the original more. the original is just more bold, yet balanced. this one just has everything too subdued in comparison."
"Pours a slightly hazy brown color, thick off-white head, excellent head retention. Aroma seems malty at first but as it warmed slightly the hops came out with a vengeance. A faint woodsy aroma rounds out the smell. The hops seem surprisingly more subdued than i expected, which is balanced nicely between a malty flavor and the oak. Mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly drying on the finish, just the right amount of aftertaste. Very drinkable, all the flavors and aromas blend nicely. I enjoyed this much more than regular AB."
"had to try this one ; pours a deep, hazy orange-brown w/ a thin light tan head which dissipates rather quickly leaving a decent amount of lacing in my pint ; a strong citrus hop aroma w/ some darker grainy malt undertones ; a crisp hop bite initially, followed by a nutty/caramel flavor, a faint oak presence as well, an excellent malt to hop ratio ; a med. body w/ decent co2, well balanced with the flavor ; a decent brew, though i'd have trouble drinking more than couple...."
"Less arrogant perhaps, but the smoothing of flavors makes for an even better beer."
"Very nice."
"Drinkability : well one is enough at a time, it would be great with spicy chicken wings and yes I will buy it again"
"i think a more appropriate name for this beer would be ""half a bastard""."
"Nice and smooth, very quaffable."
"I am not a huge fan of oak in my beer unless it is a bourbon barrel so this one was a tad hard for me to drink as i tasted no bourbon at all, just wood and hops, but for what it is, it is okay. i wouldnt choose to drink it again over all the other choices though."
"For someone who described Arrogant Bastard Ale as ""the Owsley acid of beer," I feel like a traitor doing this review. I fear that the oak flavoring has changed this to some strange hop-flavored bourbon stuff. All I could taste was bourbon. I don't like bourbon at all, so maybe that's why I was disappointed. Oh well, it's still better than Rainier and definitely better than Fischer. If you like the bourbon smell and taste, I'll bet this will be good for you."
"Wow, this is good. I bought a 6 pack of this after already trying regular AB many times. I was blown away. Everything I liked about AB plus piney and vanilla notes that made me never want to stop drinking this stuff. The mouthfeel and especially drinkability are off the charts for me. Beautiful dark amber color, too. If oak-aging worked this well for every beer, the world would be a better place."
"The aroma was malty with sweet caramel filling the nose. I really tasted the oak and maltiness which was really powerful... It hits the back of my throat and was slightly carbonated. Enjoyable beer but I was questioning how tough I was and if I could handle their offering. To me it was similar to sipping a nice tumbler of Kentucky whiskey."
"M & D: Weighty, yet still wet... a combination few get right. The bitter body makes for a bit of a slow drink, but the have done well balancing something so intense. Not for any sort of crazy consumption, but that kinda seems to be intentional. This isn't to be treated like a bad macro on a summer day. Nonetheless, I find myself pouring every last drop I can get out of the bottle into the glass."
"D: I had one, and it was enough, I enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. The beer seemed to be lacking in balance to me."
"Pours a deep murky brown with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the sides and surface of the glass. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops. Some light oak notes. Taste is toasted and caramel malt balanced by abundant grapefruit/citrus. A dull background sweetness. Oak notes throughout. Some dark fruit as well. Complex. Fairly balanced although the hops are somewhat dominant, but that's not a bad thing. Light lingering bitterness. Really great stuff. Nice full bodied creamy mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable considering its heaviness. Overall a great beer"
"Tastes great. Lots of spicy grapefruity hops, chewy caramel malt and a shy woody oak taste. It might just be me but I found the oak to be laid back, not in a bad way. It adds just the right touch."
"I had extremely high expectations for this after really enjoying a bottle of Ruination I brought back from vacation, and I'm really pleased to say that I was not disappointed."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation level is excellent. At 7.2%, it's a little on the heavier side, but extremely smooth and drinkable. This is a Stone classic."
"D: Kinda tough, to be sure, but the taste does leave me wanting more, and that counts for something."
"This is an ale of such magnitude that it's nearly impossible to comprehend all of the complex flavors at once. An absolute masterpiece."
"Mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is solid for such an arrogant beer. Certainly a fine creation by Stone."
"What a terrific beer! Easy to drink but not easy to stop drinking."
"D = This is very drinkable. The only problem may be stopping yourself before having too much given the ABV."
"All that is left is the Double Bastard and I just received a bottle in a trade yesterday so I'm trying it next."
"Lingers in the mouth with a slight oily feel and some mild astringency. Leaves a lightly sticky hold. Overall very nicely balanced between bitter and full in a well bodied, full flavored brew. Carbonation is good for taste and body. A pleasing beer with good drinkability."
"Picked up at Halftime Beverages (loading up on the good stuff CT can't get...). Dark brown/orange color, with a big frothy head. Nice hoppy aroma, with a little bit of citrus. Taste is incredible! Powerful hops, but in now way overwhelming. I don't know if it's the oak chips that soften things, but this is probably the smoothest beer in this class I've ever tried. For 7.2% it is extremely easy drinking; I could actually see this as a session beer. This is one I'll have to load up on the next time I go out of state."
"Still, this is definitely something not to be missed. I would highly recommend it."
"So where does that leave me? About the same as my original assessment, surprisingly. Complexity and flavor-changes? You betcha. Drinkable brew? Not exactly...I'll be aging my last bottle for a while to see if it improves."
"Pours a hazy dark, dark, dark brown with a creamy, sticky, tan head. Initial aroma is fruity and floral - notes of dark fruit, some molasses, grapes. Initial taste is pungent raisins and prunes, and an earthy, woody flavour. Initial mouthfeel is medium bodied with an astringent edge, and a soft carbonation. Bitterness is very strongly balanced initially, and explodes in the finish with a long, drying aftertaste. Take 2 brings out some coffee-like aromas and a graininess. Still very astringent in the mouth but from floral hoppiness comes through with a grapefruitiness. No question, this is a big flavourful beer, and challenging to say the least. As far as the oak goes, I like the woody flavour I guess, but could do with a little less astringency."
"Full bodied, it is hoppy and bitter as expected, piney again, with the same caramelized malty notes, along with some definite woodiness. Well balanced, it is a very good brew, but not fantastic. I believe aging this might improve it a bit."
"D- the only thing wrong with the drinkability is the price at 13.99 a six pack ,even though you will not be disappointed a pleaser for sure."
"Beer is deceptively smooth (I'm really not noticing that its 7.2% abv, which while I am used to that, it seems to be disappearing quite quickly (so yes, i like it!....just not quite what i expected, which was a heck of a lot). And in all fairness, I may not be educated enough to distinguish wood aging unless it is quite pungent, which wouldnt necessarily be the best way of presenting said aroma/taste."
"D: Defintely a drinkable beer. Nice and smooth body with a spicy taste made it a fairly enjoyable beer. The oak taste did well to round out the malts. Definitely a good brew."
"In the mouth it was good - smooth. Mostly went down fine, but the bitter flavor was bothering me at the end."
"Tried Stones IPA and liked it had high hopes for this one with all the buzz surrounding the arrogant bastard, and to tell the truth, wasnt disappointed Copped a single 12oz from Garys in Madison for almost $3.00 The oak flavor really comes through slightly bitter but very unique and different. Appearance was exceptional ruby-red to light brown with a frothy head smell was somewhat bland  more so than I had expected for a beer of this quality and reputation, and the drinkability was limited by its hefty alcohol percentage otherwise, an all-around outstanding brew that certainly warrants recognition enjoyed this one Recommended"
"Pours a murky brown with reddish hues that has a lighter tan head. Nose is mild alcohol with some mild hops. Overall not the kick in the nose I would have expected. Flavor is a combination of wood and a tingling alcohol presence. Hops are definitely there in a deep way. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and the liquid is pretty well bodied. I have to say that I distinctly remember my first time trying Arrogant Bastard and it left an impression. This seems to be a far cry from it and I want to say it is more subdued. Decent, but not as great as I would expect it to be."
"Overall impression: A lightly oaked, highly hopped, American strong ale (I say barleywine but I defer to the brewer). One of the better oaked beers as it adds character and does not overpower the beer. Worth a shot once but for the price, it probably won't be in my regular rotation. Still, Stone delivers yet again."
"I prefer this one over the regular AB. It is a great a brew and the oak only makes it more drinkable. Man, Stone keeps impressing me with its many brews."
"This beer pours a deep red brown with good head and moderate lace. The nose is more like double bastard than the original. Can still smell that classic arrogant hop smell, but also a thin creamy smell and just a hint of the oak. The taste follows the nose. Good hop flavors through the first taste. Then a creamy oaky, with slight vanilla taste in the middle. Then hop layers abound and the finish has some hop bitterness, but nothing like arrogant bastard. I the oak hit this bastard over the head. Nowhere near as savage as the original, but in my opinion better. The abv is very well hidden, and the oak adds a nice new layer of flavor. Pick it up and age a few for a year or two. goodness. go stone."
"Well carbonated and pretty easy to drink but it's not a type of beer I would drink all night, but great on a cold day/night."
"Dark brown (tea colored when you hold it to light) not a lot of head, modest lacing. Aroma is woody grapefruit. Tastes hoppy with toasted caramel malt. The oak really comes through in the taste, I dont think it improves on regular Arrogant Bastard without oak. The oak gives it an interesting new twist but Arrogant Bastard is already a damn good beer that is hard to improve on. That said I enjoyed drinking this beer. The flavor was interesting and complex with a nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel was full, carbonation was a little light. I probably won't drink this again since the Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard are better."
"Poured from the bottle to a deep amber-orange, with a nice fluffy light tan head that lingered well and left good lacing. Nose was a complex mix of malty sweet oak and some citrus hops, with a hint of alcohol sneaking in late in the glass. Mouthfeel was tingly and the taste leaned more to the malt side than the hops. Finish was long and pleasant, but while this was a good beer, Im much more a fan of the non-oaked, hop dominant version of this beer."
"Overall, it's a great Beer, but I have my suspicions that this is not just the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale that has been aged with oak chips, but that they tweaked the recipe a smidge first."
"not very dynamic, not that i didn't see that coming"
"Prosit!"
"Medium bodied with a semi-dry finish. The carbonation is middle-of-the-road as well and brightens the whole deal up a bit. The flavor and texture really seem to linger on the tongue. Really well crafted and a very interesting adaptation of the style."
"Though I honestly can't taste the oak in here, I can definitely tell that this is a variation of the regular Arrogant Bastard ale. Though I've grown to enjoy the AB in the past couple years (from initially disliking it), I think that this is superior due to the balancing out of strong flavors with others in order to create a complex (but not overly so) beer. Highly recommended."
"D- A delicious beer, but not worth the incredible build up that I gave it. I need to taste the normal AB again to better compare, but for now I'd say I might as well just get that and save the money."
"I have been drinking standard issue AB for many moons and find it to be a very well balanced and drinkable ale. The oaked version is a cut below in my opinion. Very attractive burnt orange hues. I expected oak in the nose but didn't really find any. The blast of white grapefruit pith is ever present from start to long after finish. Something in this beer leaves an unpleasant lingering sourness that I don't find in the regular AB. It's still very good stuff though, being a Bastard at heart."
"3L bomber (2004 version) at our Septoberfest party. The beer is cloudy dark reddish-brown color with a thick tan head that has good retention. Patches of lacing. Woody, citrusy hops aroma with lots of malt. Full-bodied with a subtle oak character which infuses the already-tasty Arrogant Bastard with an interesting new dimension. Flavors of malt, fruit and piney hops are all present. Hops become steadily more pronounced. The finish is hoppy and malty with a lingering citrus and apricot aftertaste. Really good."
"Had this on tap. Deep, deep red with a little bit of froth on the top - no real head per se. Smells boldly of citrus and oily hops. Very complex taste. Everything the aroma promises and then some. Woody notes and hints of pine in addition to the citrus and hops. I think I discover something new about it every time I have this. Obviously this is a lot like Arrogant Bastard, but still wholly unique. It seems a little more confident, while Arrogant Bastard acts like it's got something to prove (though it proves itself with flying colors, to be sure). Will definitely have this again if it's on tap. Heck, for special occasions, I may even fork over the big bucks and pick up a six pack."
"Stone Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale pours a deep red brown with a nice yellowish head that lingers and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is sweet dark and fruity malts, with an almost vinous character. The flavor is dry malts at first, with hints of bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is quickly dominated by a strong hop bitterness pungent grapefruit and some pine. I think the oak has cut down a bit on the sweetness of the beer, making it seem a bit dryer, but it doesn't seem to be an overpowering flavor."
"Nice glossy sweet attack of caramel and butter gives way evenly to fairly intense resiny bitterness. Hard cinnamon candy flavored hops, with lemon and pepper. Pasteurized apple juice sweetner with dried marshmallow. Wood flavors are subdued but serve to structure the large volume of texture and sweetness. The finish is polished and relentlessly bitter."
"Pours a dark ruby color with an off white head that dissipates quickly to lace on the sides of the glass. The smell is an odd mix of hops, pine, and grapefruit. The taste is of grapefruit and pine with a little beer in there too. I couldn't drink to many of these, in fact I like the non oak version much better. It was nice to try, but not one of my favorites."
"Wow, I never thought I'd come across a 12oz bottle of this beer in Vermont. Good for Stone. I love Arrogant Bastard Ale, but this beer makes ""Oaked"" into a dirty word. The oak coloring really throws off an otherwise great beer. Hey, it's still a great beer even though it's been oaked."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a reddish mahogany brown color, with a bit of a light brown head on it. It leaves a small amount of lacing. The aroma is an interesting mix of oak and pine. Perhaps a bit of caramel in there also. The flavor is interesting. The oakiness is definitely up front. It is a complex taste. A bit of piney bitterness on top, with some of the sweetness hitting you later."
"Mouthfeel-immediate hop bitterness, very astringent and medicinal. I have not had many oaked beers but this carries one hell of an edgy taste. Something not quite hoppy is in there competing for supreme bitterness on the palate. A froth releases a very minute malty sweetness. Finishes with a medicinal bitterness that lingers. I love AB and this has another aggressive bitter edge that just exudes all that is Stone. This brew backs up every word that is printed on the AB bottles- YES! I am worthy. Very well done but for me only good as a one-timer every once in a while."
"Stone is awesome."
"D- Good drinkablitiy. The bite on the back end and the weight of the beer makes it a little more difficult to make into a session beer but I'd drink it again."
"Tasty and interesting stuff, and quite different from the normal version."
"Alike on the tongue, we have a smoother, more mature Bastard. Yes, there's a big hoppy bite but it's deeply ingrained into the matrix of an oak barrel. The hops don't linger as long either. In their stead is a woody, earthy aftertaste."
"Thanks for the extra, NCSUdo!"
"A slight disappointment. I figured the oaking factor would start with AB as a baseline and add a great deal of taste and depth. Not necessarily so. Yes, slightly more vanilla scents and a bit more of a chocolate and roasted malt undertone than AB, but not hugely noticeable. Bottom line: If you're a fan of AB, you'll like this one as well. Not much more, and prob not enough to justify the added cost of this over regular ol' dependable AB."
"D- Fantastically drinkable and sessionable beer."
"This was actually on tap at the Moan and Dove. It poured with a heavy head and had a very, very dark appearance. It did, however, have some amber seen when you looked through it in light. The Oaked Arrogant Bastard had a very strong malty aroma and was wicked sweet in caramel-like flavors. It had a medium body and was really, really thick. Very desert-like. That oak-aging worked wonders for a Stone classic. Highly recommended"
"D: I think this is better than the original-the oak really balances with the sweetness. Easy to drink despite the high alcohol. Another creative brew by Stone that works really well. Nice to see this in 12 oz bottles and year-round."
"Great beer here and would be even better after a bit in the cellar."
"For as much as I love the Stone beers, the AB and the OAB have never really done it for me, but I am not going to let my tastes alter the overall review. I know the ""fizzy yellow beer"" mantra, but there is something I just can't get into .... A brewing buddy says I can't stand Chinook hops .... I have little idea if there are any Chinook in here, but I just can't put my fiinger on my dislikes... that being said, I will continue to buy and try the OAB just to prove my palate wrong ... Damn Stone ... Love you guys."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber color, some carbonation, not much of a head, some islands and sticky lacing around the glass. The nose is of sweet malts, a slight woodsy tone, hops, and caramel. The taste is malty and slightly bitter in the tongue, the finish is quite dry, nice undertone of caramel. Alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, still an awesome brew, would still recommed if you can find it."
"D - Great beer, this beer has really strong flavors with a good after taste. It is highly drinkable."
"Good mouthfeel with a bitterness from the hops that lingered long past the swallow."
"Although I wouldn't change my score, my respect for this beer actually grew as I finished the six-pack off. I think I'd be more likely to pick this one up, too."
"Found a six-pack of this at a local store. I've always liked Arrogant Bastard, so I was excited to see the Oaked version come out. I poured the 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. It's a lovely ruby-copper with a small, tan head. Excellent retention throughout the process. Smells are good, but a little off. Definite notes of piny hops, a thick malty center, and the oak. However, along with the oak comes a slightly rubbery smell. Not strong, but it's still there. Taste is much better. Big taste of the hops... very citrusy and piny. Great bitterness on the center of the tongue, finishing clean with a strong, grainy touch. Some vanilla in the aftertaste. Medium-bodied - not as thick as a stout, but a couple steps up from a pale ale. Overall, very drinkable beer. The character morphed nicely as the beer warmed up. Definitely check this one out at least once!"
"While I wouldn't pay a premium amount more for this beer than I would a regular Arrogant Bastard, this is still good stuff. But only slightly better than the original."
"This stuff is pretty intense, and will follow you around for the rest of they day. Hell, it might just sleep overnight on your doorstep as well if you don't watch out. Big on the malt and on the hops, although the hops do win out in the end on that tug of war."
"Pours a nice thick ruddy head, almost amber in color. Head retention right down to the bottom. Bright hoppy taste and exceptional mouth-feel, down right to the bottom creamy. Color is a deep amber brown. Oak flavors are there but don't take over the hops and sweet alcohol taste. Which is surprising But still -- an excellent Bastard! Recommended!"
"Overall a stunningly bold and perfectly balanced ale. It's like The Avengers, The Invaders, The Fantastic Four and the Super Friends all got together and created this beer. If I were to compare this beer to a band, it'd definitely be Led Zeppelin. Full force, multi-dimensional, grimy and graceful! A perfect beer for me!"
"12 oz bottle. Its been a while since I had this one. It pours a deep amber color with a light coat of head over top. The clarity is moderate and there are a few stray bubbles, but no real carbonation present. The aroma is deep caramel with an underlying pine hop and a mellow tannin and light vanilla. It has a nice balance between the aromas. The first sip brings a very solid vanilla and tannin that moves to a full pine hop with a sweet caramel and almost sugary sweetness that fades into a solid but pleasing bitterness. I really think the vanilla on this one blends really well with the caramel and hop of the brew. I don't remember their being a a vanilla note in this one. Mouthfeel is thick, with a light carbonation. Drinkability on this one is really good. There are some big flavors but they blend well and don't make it overpowering. This one still impresses me."
"d: Tough to score fairly. Comparing this to ab lowers the score quite a bit. Scored on its own merit,however, this is a beer I'd revisit."
"Overall, an excellent,excellent beer that could be enjoyed in quanity or sipped. A more tame version of Arrogant Bastard, but one that adds its own stamp on the name."
"i like it. very smooth. dark. nice faint citrus taste, alcohol is pretty hidden. cant really find the oaked flavor though but that doesnt take anything away. this is yet another stone brew that goes straight to the top of my list.not the best but up there pretty close. if you like the original bastard you will like this"
" Nicely carbonated with a full body. Leaves a very dry bitter finish. The hop flavor and bitterness hides any other tastes that might be present. Alcohol is well hidden making it easy to drink. I'm not really getting an aged ale with oak chip tastes.Maybe the earthy tone I tasted was the oak chips. It does taste different than regular Arrogant bastard which I prefer. It does have a slight sweet finish. I'm not really impressed with this. The price they were charging was outrageous at like $16.99 a six-pack. I only bought a single."
"Peer comparison: I'm off in another direction on this one, but I think I'm ok with that. Evidently the lighter mouthfeel is seen as smoothness but others, but I don't have any problem with the smoothness of the regular. Sounds like the tap version may have some subtleness not mentioned in the bottled beer, but I haven't had a chance to confirm that--sadly I live in a non-Stone state and grab it when I'm elsewhere. No one pointed to the oak as dominating as I did, which seems to be the point of reduction for me."
"One of my least favorites from Stone Brewing and my least favorite strong ale."
"D - Excellent, I had a few, and am looking forward to having a few more. This is probably my favorite offering from Stone. Bravo!"
"Drinkability: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... good stuff. I would like to do a side-by side comparison with regular Arrogant Bastard Ale.... just to appreciate the difference."
"Appearance was blase due to the fact that there was no head or any lacing. My first sip I was hit by a whallop of fruitiness, and after that I got the hops. Only after slurping it a bit could I taste the oak. I guess this is the first Stone that I liked(I haven't had their stouts yet), so maybe I'll sample a few more."
"D: Very drinkable with the alcohol well hidden. Solid offering, but not in the same league with the other Stone brews."
"This is an enjoyable beer. Not much different from the regular Arrogant Bastard but I'll take what I can get here in Connecticut!"
"D - Overall some very interesting flavors on this one. Worth a try but I don't know if I would ever choose this over a regular AB."
"This beer poured a clear brown with a 1 tan, rocky head. The aroma is initially of hops, but later gives way to malty sweetness. The taste follows the aroma. The hops are bold in the beginning and it is followed by a sweet malty oak flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied and seems suited. Overall, this is a delicious beer.quite drinkable and highly recommended."
"-Overall I found this more mature than Arrogant Bastard, but lacking some of the complexity found in Double Bastard. Does our future hold an Oaked Double Bastard? Anyway, it pairs well with a cheese platter and most Italian cuisines."
"Purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle last week. Pours a dark brown with a head that fades quickly to a thin cap. Some slight lacing. Smells slightly sour and woody- not acetic, but some wood sourness. There are also earthy/spicy hops and some rough tannins. The taste is somewhat similar, the somewhat harsh and spicy taste of the regular arrogant bastard has been smoothed out by the oak, but the oak introduces its own version of roughness. Nevertheless, its still fairly tasty as it is a fairly harmonious union between oak and hops and malt. Mouthfeel is a little tannic and rough- could be smoother. I miss some of the vanilla notes that come from full barrel aging. Just okay, and probably not worth the money."
"Drinkability: Excellent. More drinkable in quantity that regular Arrogant Bastard. Very satisfying complexity."
"Excellent! A nice dark, very deep, copper color with great head and nice lacing. It has a nice deep scent, nice hops in it, along with a bit of a smoky feel. Great taste, again a nice shot of hops along with the smoky feel. Goes down very smooth regardless of type, and even more so when you consider that it's a higher ABV beer. Excellent choice anytime! (Although you should never feel bad if you can't find the oaked and can only find the straight Arrogant Bastard.)"
"Feels smooth but with a little gritty chunkiness. Not too thick but not watery either. A tad prickly. This is actuall a very pleasant, strong drink. Not one you can guzzle all night long but a formidable strong oaked ale."
"D- I like this on much better than regular AB. The flavor is much more complex yet not as aggressive which makes for a nice strong ale. I will certainly have this one again. The only edge regular AB has is its sharp spicy character."
" high-grade american Strong ale. I would only ask for a slightly bigger, if not smoother malt presence."
"12 oz bottle from Bevmo. This is the summer 2007 batch. .Pours a rich dark red color with a generous off white head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is strong with citrus and hops. Flavor is complex with biter hops in the forefront, rich malts, hazelnuts, and a bit of caramelized apple. Mouthfeel is full, silky smooth and satisfying. Finish is long with vanilla and slightly sweet. The oak aging really mellows out this concoction. This is a superb beer. Recommended"
"Most of the times Ive had this it has been very fresh, plenty of citrus and bitter in the finish that keeps you coming back for more. I like this beer. If you like Arrogant Bastard but cant handle the bitterness try this. I feel that this really is the crowning achievement of Stone Brewing."
"Recommended for: Walt Whitman, Bobby Flay, Ricky Bobby."
"D: A very drinkable beer. The smoothness of it is very impressive since there are so many big and dominant flavors present in the beer. This is one category where it definitely holds the edge over the regular version."
"An enjoyable beer which makes me want to crack open the bomber of regular Arrogant Bastard ale."
"Drinkability: Definitely an eye opener, a nice taste with some boldness, but it was too much to drink more than one or two in a session. A glass of this should be savored as a treat."
"what a great beer, this is why you never stop trying new things...if you have the opportunity this beer is worth every penny"
"Carbonation: Fairly light with a quickly gone head after a hard pour. Ring around side of glass lasts through out."
"12oz bottle purchased from Claredon Wines in Boston for $3.25. Pours a ruby brown with ample head but little carbonation. Surprisingly little aroma. Flavour is of nice roasted malts. But I'm not getting much oak in the flavour. Sure, it's a nice beer - but at its price, I am hoping for something more special. I also wasn't enthralled with the regular Arrogant Bastard, so maybe I'm just not programmed right for this beer."
"D - I like the oaked version much better than the regular arrogant bastard. I wish this was a year round release."
"Flavor begins firing on all cylinders with big full malts, followed immediately by substantial rich hops mixed with the oak. piny, herbal hop flavors. Oak flavor is of freshly cut wood, not smoky."
"Drinkability: I could drink a couple of these in the night without getting tired of it, though its alcohol is over 7 so I wouldn't be driving home from the bar."
"This poured a deep amber with a robust 3+ finger off white head and a nice amount of carbonation coming up. The foam is leaving a nice lacing all the way down my glass. The nose is big and wonderful, woody, citrusy and a bit of spice. Very hoppy beer with nice pine and grapefruit notes. The mouthfeel is robust and creamy. This is a delicious beer, and overall much more drinkable than regular Arrogant Bastard (though if it is better is arguable)."
"Bottom line: This is a very good oaked brew that I'd certainly buy again. The flavours all work together in almost flawless harmony and I can only recommend it highly!"
"Oaked AB smells terrific--vaguely sweet, with floral hops, and a bit of oak. There's hardly any woody taste however--in the mouth, Oaked AB is basically a smoother version of the standard Arrogant Bastard. While I like the original, I prefer to avoid the punch to the mouth hops/malt, and the alcohol is better hidden here. A really good beer."
"D - I love this stuff. I could get a few in before things deteriorated due to the ABV."
"Definitely worth the $2.50/12oz bottle. Would buy this beer again for sure."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall very nice beer. Most people shy away from arrogant bastard because of the strong flavor (and name) but the oaked arrogant bastard ends up being a lot smoother and easier to drink than it's counter part."
"D: Off the wall as merely Arrogant Bastard, the oaked version takes on a different character. Drinkability is solid, as Stone likes to play mind games with their labels. Sure, they'd like you to buy into the ""intimidation factor," but it's really just a bold beer that oozes complexity, yet keeps balance somewhat in mind."
"Big, big taste. Lots of wood in there, almost as much pine as oak. Grapefruit, some malt to balance it, and other citrus flavors. Can't think of a better beer to get a sixpack of. I found the flavor far less overwhelming than the normal A. Bastard."
"I dont know what it is about stone brewing but I love everything they make. I even keep a half barrel of something they make on tap at all times."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that lasts. The aroma is great. It has a smooth and mellowing scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with a generous amount of hops and a mild oak aroma. The taste is good. It has an aggressive wood flavor up front as well as in the finish. It blends well with the bold malt and hop profile. The hop bitterness lends itself well to the oak flavor. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a wonderful version of an already great beer. I prefer the original, but this one is a good drinker as well."
"drinkability- as much as i really enjoyed this beer, I think it would be impossible for me to have more than one a night or even a week perhaps. After tonight and the other beers I tried, my mouth needs a while to recover. This beer is amazing and if you have the chance to get your hands on it, GO FOR IT, it takes an awesome thing and makes it completely different. GO STONE!"
"D=Highly drinkable until the abv decides you've had enough. Can't wait until Stone finally decides to show their pretty face in Wisconsin...."
"This poured very nicely, a very dark amber with a nice tan head. Smell is extremely hoppy, with a slight aroma of something different (I'm thinking it's the oak). The flavor is almost pure hops, but the finish contains this almost smoky aroma, definitely unique. It's aggressively bitter which isn't totally a bad thing but can be a bit much, put simply you have to be in the mood for something like this. But if you are, there's very little else out there that rivals this."
"Nice ruby bronze color with the expected sticky off white head. Smell of citrus and pine and yes there is some woody oakyness in the background. Taste is bitter up front, slightly grapefuit but most noticable is the pine. This is followed by the oak that serves to smooth things out. Lots to chew on in this one. The first one I had I didn't really think the oak was doing much but smooting things out. Now on the second one a few weeks later I'm really getting a full oaky wood taste. What can you say, another excellent beer from Stone. I haven't had the original AB in a long time so I can't really compare this to that one. Either I'm getting tougher in my reviews or I liked that one a little better."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into duvel snifter. Poured a brown red color with off whit head with good retention( just like all of Stones beer). Smell pineapple grapefruit herbal light alcohol. Taste a combination of grapefruit , pine, carmel, Toasted oak. Mouth feel chewy but not heavy. A great tasting beer, but I like the double bastard more than the oaked but the oak is a lot smoother than the regular bastard."
"A very very complex beer, giving sweet highs, bitter lows, and everything inbetween. I didn't find much difference between the oaked and the original, although it has been a while since I have tried the latter. Regardless, it's a beer that's worth your while."
"I love it and so will you."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"georgeous looking beer. dark reddish brown with a big big off white/tan head that leaves an enormous ammount of lace. light smell of piney, grapefruity hops, some nice malt and it's all mixed in and blends pretty well with the smoky/oaky. tastes the same. pretty well blended. fairly silky smooth mouthfeel and pleasure drinking. glad i finally got to try this one. don't see it as a regular in my rotation, but delightful none the less."
"Pours a clean deep amber color, with a tan head. Aromas of a malty hop presence. In the taste, a sweet malt, a small dry hop, and smoother than regular Arrogant Bastard. A small bitter mouthfeel, with a alcoholic and sweet malt aftertaste. Feels bigger that it is, and the hops are not as big. NIce and smooth."
"So what's the next version of the Arrogant Bastard series, Oaked Double Bastard Ale?"
"Well, I very much enjoy the original, and I must say that the oak is a nice compliment. It's nicely drinkable, and is no problem to enjoy more than one in a sitting. It's certainly a nice variation of the original, although I don't think it is superior (nor inferior). It is certainly more expensive..."
"When I popped the top of this beer, an evil looking vapor slowly crept from the bottle. Pours into the glass with a moderate tan head that quickly fades. Aroma of vanilla, damp malt, and a hint of bourbon notes. Flavor is dominated by the oak notes. Dry smoky flavor has very little malt sweetness to counteract it. Hop bitterness comes in eventually, but still plays second fiddle to the wood. For this size of a beer, the mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinakbility is OK, but I'd take regular AB, DB, or really ANYTHING else stone has to offer over this. I think I can get a couple more if anyone's intersted in trades. :) Pretty much a disappointment."
"Not a heavy beer at all, it easily belies its 7+% ABV. I could drink a few of these."
"Drinkability - I could make this sessionable.The oak aging mellows this beer quite a bit and adds some nice flavor depth."
"Pours a dark yet translucent copper amber color with a big stiff light tan head that resists fading. Nice sheets of lacing left behind. The smell has a lot going on. You get a sweet floral citrus from the hops with a vanilla caramel behind it. Medium-full bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a tingle of hops yet mellow with almost creamy textures. Full flavored, the taste is just as complex. Citrus-pine hoppiness balanced with a sweet caramel malt and cherry vanilla notes. A notable hop bitterness lingers appropriately. A really nice drinker."
"Drinkability: Well I didn't care for it. The Oak just overshadows the good smell and what starts out as a good taste"
"12 oz bottle. Small off-white head that is mostly diminishing. Pours a clear amber. Mild citrus, hop, and woody aroma. The initial flavor is dominated by hops. The oak aged taste comes on the back end, kind of spicy. Medium body, creamy texture. Mild carbonation with spicy, hoppy finish. Complex beer yet drinkable. Other than the price tag, would have no problem drinking this every day of the week."
"D- This is definitely a sipper and I would only have 1 glass in a night but certainly delicious and worth trying."
"Drinkability - Only five minutes in and the beer is half gone from the sampling, that's the best sign..."
"Another highly recommended beer from Stone"
"D- Smooth and unique, I have been a big fan of Oaked AB for a while. From the bottle is not as great as draft/growler, but this is still a highly drinkable strong ale especially compared to AB and Double AB. The alcohol is well-masked and I could drink several in a session with no qualms. I am sure I will be drinking much more Oaked AB in the future."
"I like this one...but, personally I would probably choose the non-oaked Arrogant Bastard over it. I had this at a tasting awhile back and wanted to have it on a fresh palate - I still feel that while the oak is interesting (and I've had barrel-conditioned brews that really enhanced the flavors) it almost interferes with its great natural taste (call me a ""party-pooper"" I suppose). Still in all, it's a great beer...the Double Bastard still takes it all of the three, though."
"Overall- A beer that you drink on a cool night in a bar. 1 or 2 is sufficient."
"Just picked up a 6-pack, so I'll let the other 5 settle for a bit and see what happens. Still have one from last year as well, so I may open that soon to compare."
"D: A very good beer, a change-up on the original Arrogant Bastard, but I like both styles very much."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer and another great example of Stone taking a style to the next level with an invested interest in balance and complexity. It might be hard to drink more than a few of these because it truly is an assault on the senses, but in a good way."
"Good clean flavors and an interesting departure from normal flavor- this brew poured a bubbly dark brown, very active and spewed out the earthy malts and signature stone hop profile. The taste was very different than i had expected. The oak took on a mineral quality as a flavor, almost metallic but not unpleasant. The aging process really melds the piney hops the aromatic wood together, like drinking the liquid flavors of an IPA combined with the almost cedar-like properties of the oak. Very nice, though the effect on my tastebuds was was irreversible for the night, making this one the finale for any future beer parties."
"M: surprisingly smooth and creamy and nicely refreshing for such an aggressive beer. leaves a nice tingle in the mouth."
"Pours an almost pure ruby with amber. Almost looks like a brown ale. Nice sized head that dies rather quickly and laces nicely. Smells are less potent then I would like. Faint caramel and vanilla, some malt, orange rind. Tastes as it smells along with big spicy and dry hops with a little bite. The characteristics from the oak are apparent. Feels medium in the mouth with perfect carbonation. Drinkability is off the charts. I can see why those 3litre bottles are out there!"
"Although Arrogant Bastard in an of itself, is a fine brew..it pales in comparison to this one. Very smooth and not rough around the edges. Nice citrusy flavor with possibly some cherry/plum going on and lots of head and hops. A beautiful looking beer and I'd have to say, behind Nosferatu, the best American Strong I've ever had."
"The mouthfeel was medium to full. The drinkability was very good. The bitterness is somewhat tempered and a it is a little more interesting than the regular arrogant bastard."
"Drinkability is good. I would prefer a regular Arrogant Bastard for a session but this is a very enjoyable offering with great flavor depth."
"Anyways, I have another bottle that I will try later on and see if there is a difference. But as this bottle went, it was a solid representation of a Stone brew, yet didn't happen to get anymore wowness then expected out of it from my first on-tap experience."
"Drinkability is very good. I am pleasantly surprised with how well this has held up. I'll probably set a couple of these aside for a few more months to see how much more this changes. Very interesting, and enjoyable."
"Interesting twist on their Strong Ale, this is a very decent oaked brew, and a must for fans of the Bastard."
"Overall Impression: Talk about flavor, complexity in this one! I have never had an Arrogant Bastard Ale and wasn't expecting a huge lingering hop bitterness. Great beer and oaky! Hop heads enjoy!"
"It's a perfect beer for an Arrogant Bastard like myself!"
"Beer poured a reddish brown color with a nice sturdy off white head that is sustaining well. Nose is somewhat fruity, malty, with a hint of citrus. The boquet gets better as it warms. Taste is interesting, the palate is greeted by heavy oak with the malts and slides into the AB's familiar hop slam finish with hints of citrus. Mouthfeel is a bit smoother than the original AB. Overall drinkability is good. This was definitely fun to try, and a very good beer, but the oak is a tad bit too much for me personally compared to AB."
"I like this even better from the tap than the bottle. A very well composed beer, and an example of good oak aging. Highly recommended."
"I have had this beer twice in my life, however, I wanted to relate an incident about this beer. A friend of mine was recently given a bottle of 1997 oaked arrogant bastard. This friend of mine is no where near being a purveyor of fine beers, as his favorite beer is Coors Light. Sadly to say, after drinking one drink of this magnificent ale, he was disgusted by its flavor and then he proceeded to pour it all down the drain. In reality, he should have poured himself down the drain instead. Obviously, when he told me this, I nearly flipped out and then I chastised him for his recklessness. His response; ""Dude, it's only beer."" What an ignoramous."
"D: So happy I decided to try this one today. Will be looking forward to more Stone brews in the future. Definitely have to find this in the Midwest. Thanks to msbulldog25 for this brew!!"
"Drinkability: It is far easier to drink than one would expect for all of its arrogance"
"I expected a lot more flavor and a bit more complexity. My score is high enough to tsay this is a really good beer but I expected more, especially when this costs nearly 3 dollar per 12 oz bottle."
"Mouthfeel is decent, I like the juiciness, but have to take some off because of the high perceived astringency. Drinkability is good, better than the normal Bastard. I have a 3L bottle of 2005 Oaked AB waiting for me, so I hope the drinkability is damn good!"
"Drinkability: With the alcohol percentage coupled with the palette crushing oak drinking more then one 12 ounce bottle in a sitting won't happen. I will drink this beer again,but this is a one/night treat."
"Highly recommended!"
"Overall drinkability of this beer is great. Almost a session beer. The 7.2% is almost unbelievable for a beer with this much flavor."
"I want a plate of cheese and fresh fruit. I want another bottle (or three). There is a certain malty vibe in Oaked AB that reminds me of Free States Old Backus Barleywine. Clearly though, Oaked AB is a big-ass malty DIPA. I am not down with the American Strong Ale term. WTF is it? Either it is a Barelywine or a DIPA. Simple as that. Screw labels. Is it tasty? Hell yeah. Is it drinkable? Oh, hell yes. I havent sat down and reviewed a beer this good in a long time. I needed this. Thank you, BuckeyeNation! This beer was great."
"Anyway, recommended"
"Wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd Be. Overall it was solid."
"Nice full mouthfeel. Low carbonation doesn't overrun the flavors. Overall the drinkability is superb. I could drink this all the time. Its less upfront than the original and a bit smoother overall without the harsh hops. Good stuff."
"This is one easily quaffable beer. A 12oz bottle simply isn't enough."
"Taste is exceptional and complex. The woody oak really comes through nicely. Flavours reminiscent of port and some raisin. Piney and herbal hops that go into a lovely caramel malt with a bit of vanilla and biscuit in the back. Cookie-like in the finish and perhaps a bit grainy. Balance is near perfect. Mouthfeel is less dry than I thought it would be, and the carbonation is about right, medium to mild. So delicious I'd have another, dangerous, as the alcohol is well hidden in my opinion. Another wonderful beer from Stone."
"This isn't quite as good as regular Arrogant, but i'd like to give this oaked another shot"
"This OAB is a nice change of pace from the regular. Decent beer."
"Sampled side by side with regular Arrogant Bastard Ale, like you could call it regular. The beer poured the same deep amber almost brown as it's more common older brother with a similar head that left a little less lacing. The aroma was almost identical to it's brother, caramel malts and pine hops with just a hint of oak. The oak in the taste adds a truly unique quality to an already complex beer. My only problem is it adds just a slight astringency to the mouthfeel, nothing much, but enough to keep it from the 5 I gave it's brother. All being said, this is also a one of my absolute favorite beers, but I rank it just behind the real deal."
"Bottled sample shared with trevorwideman. Murky amber in colour with strong aromas of dark caramel, pine, white grapefruit, vanilla, almond, and a hint of raisin. Very woody in the mouth (both fresh cut wood and bark), red grape skins, a bit of port (probably the combination of the caramel and grape elements), with a cookie like malt character coming through near the finish. Theres a citrus fruit + woody astringency that balances out the malt in a very interesting way. I think I like this beer a bit better than it's non-oaked counterpart. Thanks trev!"
"the last of a few i received for my bombing"
"Poured an almost clear brown color with a small off-white head that left some lacing as I drank it. The brew has a piney hop smell to it, like its twin brother the aroma is not too pronounced. The taste is of grapefruit hops, a slight chocolate malt flavor, a bit of rubbing alcohol. I'm not sure of the differences between the oaked and non-oaked, I would need to drink them side by side, though I do know the difference from the double. It's hard to forget the double. The feel is light and fizzy, and leaves a bitter aftertaste that lingers around. This is good as a sipper but when I take a big gulp, the bitterness kills me. Good for one or two."
"A nice brew, but I'll take the original bastard over the oaked."
"Overall impression: Fantastic beer, and I love that they are offering it at least occasionally in 12 oz bottles. Glad I stocked up!"
"Drinkability- As the regular AB, this one is very very tasty. Definitely a beer you could enjoy copious amounts of as I find myself drinking it faster than what I would expect. Excellent version of a excellent beer!"
"Hazy, amber sort of color-a muted orange is more like it. Good enough aroma-some woodiness against a backround of hops. Big malty taste with a pleasant tongue stripping level of hops and astringency. Some definate oak flavors. though I think I was looking for more. Good body. Very drinkable though I find the oakiness detracts from being the ""regular"" bastard. Too little oak and too many expectations maybe. Bring on the oaked Double Bastard that has been laid down a year or two."
"A really fine beer. Reminded me of a barleywine...specifically a mixture of Brooklyn Monster Ale and Bigfoot qualities. Pours a very cloudy brown color with a good size tan head. Left good lacing on the glass. I was expecting a Bigfoot / Celebration Ale style smell, but the aroma was fairly mild. Taste was very good..a little maltiness up front, then a good long hops blast with grapefruit and piney flavors (very much like Bigfoot). The follow through is very smooth and malty (like Monster Ale). My first sip felt thin and watery. All cured by the second taste. Smooth, rich mouthfeel and great tasting throughout. Have to rate drinkability good. Has all the flavor of Monster Ale and Bigfoot with a much lower ABV. I wouldn't say no to a second one!!!!"
"Highly enjoyable beer from Stone. I'm glad they decided to release this in 12oz. bottles last time around."
"Interesting concept, decent flavor. Good, but I had higher hopes."
"I wouldn't be able to put away a sixer of these while watching the game, though."
"D: Truely an enjoyable brew. Perfectly balanced and comlex. The subtle oak finish was the winning point for this beer. Insanely drinkable and dangerous. Highly recommend."
"As it hits your mouth this is definitly different, Bitter isnt as floral, but sharp. Leads to a very raw wood meets shoe polish kind of mouth feel. It is odd how the oak brought out the oil in the hops. Very elementaly woodsy overall. I think this one drinks better on the colder side. I'll stick with the original."
"I'd have to drink Arrogant Bastard Ale and Oaked AB side by side to determine how much they actually differ. My guess is that the oak chips definitely add something of value. I did a little jig when I found out that Stone decided to release this beer in user-friendly 12 oz. bottles. I'm doing an even more enthusiastic jig now that I've had it. Smashing stuff."
"Drinkability: Given the sharp nature of this one, I don't think I'd have more than one in a sitting. That said, it's an enjoyable ale and one that will get you talking."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is slightly bigger than medium bodied. The beer has a very creamy finish. This is a very drinkable and tasty beer. This is one Bastard who is always welcome in my house!"
"Finishes dry and crisp with a long, lingering bitterness. For only 7.2% this beer is a mouthfull."
"The Arrogant Bastard that happened to be Oaked poured a beautiful dark copper/amber hue with a think khaki colored head. Lace stuck to the glass throughout the entire tasting. I really thought this would have a powerful overwhelming smell, but to me, this was quite subtle. The smell is much more malty/oaky than the normal Bastard. Maybe because it's because I'm a hophead that the odor doesn't stand out to me. Taste is absolutely amazing, mild bitter hops bite the tongue but is quickly diminished by the wonderful malty/vanilla oak flavors. The feel is quite smooth with a much more carbonated feel to it than I had anticipated. Very drinkable brew, I was quite pleased with not nearly as much bite as Arrogant Bastard. I have always been a big fan of the original Bastard and have never had much experience in oaked brews, but I actually prefer this over the original because of its drinkability. I plan on experiencing more oaked brews thanks to Stone. Definitely give this one a try if you have the chance."
"I thought this beer was well balanced and not nearly has hoppy as the regular arrogant bastard. The aroma was a bit more mild than I thought it would be. Otherwise a very tasty brew."
"D- i honestly thought this brew would be over hyped, but it seriously knocked my socks off, one of my new favorite brews, recommended"
"I have no idea how someone could say that this is ""no different"" than the regular AB, especially when this beer bears only a superficial reseblance to its own incarnation of a few months ago. Vastly more balanced and layered. Again, not better, just... different."
"D - Now I don't know how to review this. You want to drink this beer - it is delicious. But it's strong and big and I will be more than content with this 12oz bottle. It's not all that drinkable, but I think that's kinda the point."
"As much as I loved the Double Bastard Ale, I guess I'll never care much for it's little brother, oaked or not."
"(EDIT) After trying this on tap, I have to say that it's WORLDS better. A nearly masterpiece actually."
"The impression I get is that the oak wood chips nullified the hops, removing the wonderous abrasiveness of ""plain ol' Arrogant Bastard"". Still a good beer, but I vastly prefer the original."
"D: I found this to be a more enjoyable version of AB. The addition of oak chips sands off a lot of the raggedness of AB making it even more drinkable."
"I liked this a lot -- similar to the original AB, but different enough to make it worth seeking out on it's own. Looking forward to the 2nd bottle, but I'll save it for a while."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel on this one is medium to full bodied with a bit of a drying effect that I assume is from the oak. The drinkability is really good."
"D - I enjoyed this very much, and I can definitely see myself drinking more than one in a setting. I need to have a side-by-side sampling with the regular Arrogant Bastard to declare an outright winner."
"As time as gone on Stone beers have leveled a bit for me. The BA hype, the reality that it's a nationwide ""micro", and a ridiculous fanatic fan base, have all been factors. This one, however, lives up to the hype."
"One of the many 12oz bottles I purchased. The color is identical to arrogant bastard as is the color and quality of the head. Dark red-orange and almost brown. The smell is hoppy and very nice. I think I smell caramel also. The taste is also slightly similar to regular bastard but smoother. I am not sure if I can taste the oak but this definitely tastes awesome. The mouthfeel might be the best part; very creamy. If you like Arrogant Bastard you should definitely get your hands on this stuff (if you can)."
"There aren't really any striking differences between this and regular Arrogant Bastard. What differences exist are pretty subtle. I can't really say it's an improvement, but it's certainly very good in its own right. Not one that I'd have as a regular even if it was more available (and cheaper). It's still definitely worth checking out, especially for Bastard fans. Recommended."
"This beer has a dark red hue and a dark cream colored head that lasts for a while...at least 15 minutes. It wasn't thick at all at that point, but still there. It has a good strong piney and malty aroma. The beer is fairly creamy feeling, and then the hop flavor hits. It is a little too hoppy for my tastes, but definitely within style."
"piney wood aroma, subtle. vibrant rust color, vaguely cloudy with cream head. sweet roasty malt with hoppy bitterness. smooth creamy bite, with lasting hangtime. earthy organic feel. begins in the nose and finishes in the back of the throat, and pleasurable through out."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - served on 2/1/07. It pours a very mildly hazed crimson with a two inch, pitted khaki head that leaves rings of lace. It smells of pineapple, sweet mango, grapefruit, guava, caramel?, and some toasted malts. It has a medium to high bitterness with lots of tropical hops on the palate, contributing mango, guava, papaya, pineapple, and white grapefruit, with piney/green notes appearing later. In addition there are toasted/caramel malts and oak that is more of a presence than an actual flavor, along with perhaps some vanilla. The body is medium to thick with medium carbonation and a tannic dryness that begins light but becomes stronger, and it leaves a long finish. It is pretty drinkable, but perhaps I was expecting more. It is still a good beer, and one that utilizes hops nicely. I tried it on-tap while in Boston for the EBF and found the oak presence to be stronger and the beer perhaps even more drinkable than the bottled version."
"Drinkability: Even though this is chips instead of barrel, they're certainly doing a lot for the beer, and improving upon a beer that's already pretty fantastic. Don't let anyone tell you that it's the barrel way or the highway. Sorry, silly joke. At any rate, this is a fantastic beer that, even in its greenness, has improved a great deal, or has even discovered some unforseen beautiful things along the way. In my opinion, worth the high price tag, even if it is around $15 for a six pack. I was a skeptic, but right now I'm a believer."
"Bottle courtesy of HogTown Harry via trade- much thanks Harry! I poured the twelve ounce bottle into a tumber- looks similar to normal AB- a little cloudy, deep caramel with an off white. Also smells typical AB, sweet, but the wood is noticable. Taste is just fantastic- in your face hoppy, but with a great malt backbone and the oakey flavour. The oak is defintely there- but not overpowering. It reminded me of the oak in Old Yeti. I think it really matches well with the style of AB. Mouthfeel is of a great body, medium carbonation and bitter/woody finish. I could drink many of these- but alas this is my only bottle. A great treat, that even the wife thought was delicious (who would have thunk it?). A great beer from Stone"
"D: Higher ABV prevents this from being a session beer, but it's very drinkable nonetheless. Great balance definitely helps. I'd love to see what a year in the cellar does to this brew. A side by side comparison with the standard Arrogant Bastard is a must, also."
"Thanks for another incredible beer Dr.Jay!"
"Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a dark brown color ale with a nice medium brown foamy head with good retention. Aroma of citrus hops with some nice caramel malt. Taste is sweeter then expected with lots of caramel malt and a medium bitter finish with some citrusy hops. Body is definitely above average with some medium carbonation. I thought the oak presence was quite subtle and overall this is more reminiscent to a barleywine then an American Strong Ale but enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: You can drink this all day long, period. A solid, balanced beer that will appeal to both beer enthusiasts and casual drinkers alike. Try using this to ween your friends onto more adventurous beers."
"Overall, the aroma is divine. The flavor delivers, and, although surprisingly light on the palate, it balances out the strong flavors. By far my favorite of the arrogant bastard variations."
"The body is fairly full and creamy. The carbonation has been smoothed out a bit. The tannins from the oak are a bit harsh, however. Drinkability suffers as a result. It would be a real treat to drink it every once in a while, and it is easily more complex and interesting than the regular bastard, but four out of five times, I would probably opt to drink the regular. That being said, I am very stoked by this beer."
"Notes: Pretty damn good. Not better than AB, not worse than AB, simply a brew with some subtle changes. Shows what adding some wood can do for a beer."
"Thanks for the trade Grub!"
"Poured from the bottle into a belgian snifter. This beer has an alluring appearance. Sort of an opaque, brown-apricot color, with a creamy one-finger head that dissipates a bit too soon. Leaves traces of lace along the side of the glass, but nothing terribly intricate. The aroma is pleasant. Oaky, for sure, but with some subtle hints of undetectable fruit. Maybe some vanilla, maybe some molasses? The taste is where the OAB shines, though. Malty and sweet up front, with definite oak notes. But the hops strike hard and fast, cutting through just about everything else and leaving a trail of grapefruit and pine down the back of the throat. Wow. What a lip-smacker this is. I really, really like the way this beer tastes. Sturdy, if not overwhelming mouthfeel. It's been a while since my last Arrogant Bastard, but I can't imagine why after having this one. This just made my top-20 list of American craft brews. I'm definitely not worthy...."
"Very unique, ans still worth the tiume and effort to come by it. But it definetly wasn't the orgasmic brew I had expected. I'll save one bottle for aging, with no time limit set at the moment. I will get back to you on how that turns out."
"As for a comparison with the non-oaked version, this beer seemed to possess aromas and flavors that were smoother, softer and, overall, more enjoyable."
"This is a beer I have been looking forward to trying. The color is a cloudy mahogany with a decent head. Smell is a little bit like fresh cut firewood. The taste has just a hint of the oak showing. Fair. I wouldn't take this above regular Arrogant Bastard. Do not misunderstand that comment though. Both are solid brews. Try this of you have the chance."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" orangey tan head over the slightly cloudy orangey brown brew. Head lasts nicely, with plentiful delicate lacing. Aroma is lightly woody, strong citrus and pine hops, and alcohol wafts in at the end. Taste is dominated by citrus hoppiness, with pleasing warmth upon the swallow. Maybe even a little numbness in the mouth. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is very easy. Not quite the same beer I remember having on tap, but that was a composite of a fresh and aged sample, and it was a long Stone Night at the M&D last January."
"Kudos to Stone for joining the raging oak trend. I love what oak can do for a beer. I had a hard time with this one though. There was too much going on. The hops dominated my brew and really didn't seem to let much of the oak or malt body come through. Maybe aging will help but to me that seems a cop out and my score is reflective of my tasting. I preferred the regular AB to this one. Apparently I am not worthy per the bottle:-)"
"Going to try my hardest to age a few but one, two, three, or four of these when needed is recomended. Keep in mind these are baby 12oz. Drinkability depends on how many you invested in."
"Not enough Stone to go around, I'm definitely glad they downed the portion size on this one from last year's 3L and draft releases of it. 12oz much more accessible to most of us East coasters, anyways it appearsa cloudy ruby amber brown with a large foaming beige toffee toned head looks good, real good leaves even lacing in a uniform fashion around my chalice. Aroma contains moderate oak with a piney hop edge and citrus grassy notes in there as well, touch of anise or other spice effect going on for me with mild vanilla softness overall hops shine and really unite with the alcohol great smelling brewski. Flvors is great mild sharp sweet malt caramel qualities with abrassive arrogant hop doses including herbal, pine, and mild citrus peel bursts definitely some woody character somewhat minty expression as well a somewhat tamed but oh so flavorful version of Arrogant Bastard. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller in body with strudy carbonation to carry all that the gravity, definitely coats the palate and gives you that I need to brush my teeth to get the enamel back to normal feel, due to the substantial oily hop resins flowing down the palate. Drinkability is actually amazing one of those rounded out Bastards is something I could go for anytime, I definitely need to pick up a few more."
"Full and luxurious in the mouth and a very pleasant sipper. Fine, active conditioning gives the hop bitterness a nudge, but nothing distracting (its an Arrogant Bastard, after all!). Its a pleasure to see the Oak-character develop as it warms and the oak is done is a noticeable but not overpowering way, giving a refined edge to the Bastard. An awesome beer that I hope against all odds will remain in smaller than the 3L size in the future."
"The beer is quite rich and a slow drinker, one 12 ouncer was more than enough. I liked it, but I didnt think it really improved upon Arrogant Bastard, so I most likely wont get it again. With a tag of oak aging, I was hoping for more complexity. The unique aroma & flavor described, really wasnt that appealing to me, so I was let down somewhat in that respect. But hey, you win some, you lose some."
"Although I really enjoy the regular bastard, the wood chips adds some complexity in flavor and masks the alcohol even more. A ballsy, well crafted bastard."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable Strong Ale, the Oak adds more character but also mellows the bastard some. But overall good but just as soon have a regular Bastard for the price. Thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"As much as I loved the regular ABA, the Oaked version just didn't do it for me. My wife prefers the oaked version, but I think it masks the great balance of hops/maltiness in the regular ABA and leaves a slightly acidic aftertaste in your mouth. Still a terrific beer, but I prefer the non-oaked version."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my DFH pint glass the color of dark brewed iced tea with an inch of off white head that slowly fades and leaves a slight lacing. Smells of caramel malts, grapefruit, toasted grain. Tastes of rich, oakey wood, sweet malt, mildly bitter grapefruit and citrus. Hop bitterness comes through in the finish. Very smooth and mellow with medium carbonation. A nicely balanced beer. I could drink a few of these in an evening."
"This is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. It just glides down my throat. So good!"
"Pours a beautiful head that falls, but doesn't dissapate. It has a great lacing that follows the length of the glass. Brown color is dark and not too cloudy, looks great. It smells like a maltier beer with a slight hint of woodiness. The flavor is pretty bitter with hops and very malty and the woodiness really comes out in the finish. The mouthfeel was very good, no bite, nothing but pretty smooth stuff. The drinkability was very nice, I will enjoy my next few."
"I expected more from this one. Im really not sure where to place this on taste alone as it doesnt remind me much of the original AB. Its not bad by far, but maybe a little confusing."
"stone is my lord and shepard!"
"Notes: I was mildly disappointed with this beer -- my 100th review on BA -- as it tastes right now. I paid $15.99 for a 6-pack, have enjoyed the regular AB in the past, love pretty much all the Stone offerings and have heard some pretty nice reviews (here and from friends); so maybe my expectations were a tad bit too high. I thought the oak imparted just too much of an astringent woodsy flavor -- I definitely get the sense that this somewhat harsh, acidic flavor came from oak chips rather than the more mellow experience that would come from barrels. Perhaps some aging will allow that caramel and vanilla flavor to come out more, and like I said, next time I'll try it a little bit warmer. Still a very good beer with the oak being an interesting addition, it's just not another awe-inspiring concoction from Stone. Either that or maybe I'm just not worthy."
"Not noticeably different than regular AB, maybe aging will bring out the oak more."
"I think the beer has lost its kick, I had it for ther first time on xmas eve 06 and it was very bitter and now its a mear shadow of it self.I will say drink fresh whenever possible and drink it all up cause when it gets soft,its not like the Bastard its meant to be."
"Dark red color, off-white head that retains somewhat, but leaves no lacing. Lightly toasted smell, oak and pine make up the majority of the smell. Not overpowering, but still nice. Smooth malty flavors at the forefront, moving into oak flavors that are greeted with a bit of a piney/oak finish. Less than medium carbonation, medium bodied. This is very smooth, I think this is my favorite of the ""Bastard"" series. Definitely would buy again."
"it really makes me crave some hops flavors that are missing. The flavors are blended very nicely making this a smooth drinking beer with some nice big flavors."
"I'm so glad Stone finally gave us a way to buy this beer aside from in the massive magnums. It was definitely worth the wait."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability - a fun six pack to enjoy and share. Don't know if I'd buy it again, but it's one well put together brew."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a reddish/brown, with a small tan head. It smells like citrusy and piney hops, some wood (oak), and caramel. It tastes like bitter hops, wood/oak, and a bit of sweet malt. Not too bad. It starts bitter, then is sweet, then has a bitter lingering hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy, and also a bit oily. The drinkability is good, but not great. It's still a good beer, but I like the regular Arrogant Bastard Ale better."
"Very reminiscent of European beers. Strong but balanced with layers of depth."
" Palate is very nice - sweet caramel and dark malts up front, with notes of brown sugar, plum, and raisin. A hint of light, grassy hops peeks through for just a moment, before yielding again to the superb maltiness. Finish is again sweet and malty, showcasing the oak quite nicely. Mouthfeel is superb - rich and creamy, like velvet. A slow-sipping treasure, much better from the bottle than on draft."
"D: A little strong on the flavor to drink too many of these, but I don't think that's the point. It's perfect for what it is, a ""novelty"" (and I use that term very loosely) beer that's released only once a year."
"My palate is very well soothed by this gem of a brew. I think that it is well served by the oak aging, as it seems to smooth the flavor profile out a bit. As much as I like the original, I feel that the malt and hop textures are better reconciled with the oak. Steve Wagner is the shit."
"The drinkability a bit down just because of all acidity,not all bad,I'd say this beer is a bit over-hyped to me. Just wasn't all that impressed with this beer."
"This beer poured a very dark red amber color and formed a huge off white foamy head that subsided slowly leaving latticed lace. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, caramel, vanilla and a hit of the wood chips. Overall, aroma is much more subdued than the regular and doesn't smack you in the face like it does. Don't know if that is the aging, wood chips or something else. The flavor was of malt, hops and burnt coffee. It has a medium body and and a slightly burnt quality to the finish. A good beer, but I guess I expected more from the supposedly oak aging."
"Yawn. What oh right. This beer is pretty much like the regular bastard which is ok in its own right. Nice amber hue small weak head, low carbonation. The smell is strong alcohol mixed with some malty profile that could be anything, there is a nutty woody presence with of course plenty of hops in case. The hops seem more toned down but the oak flavor is a little to bite-y with the alcohol. It is a decent blend but I think it might need more time to mellow. I could drink a 6 pack in a week, but not something I would get regularly."
"This brew pours a dark mahogany color with a large, billowy, tannish-white head. Lacing is thorough, and sticks all over to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit, grapes, and oak. The taste is of brash hops, and abrasive oak. It is like drinking a board. Nothing is in harmony. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. I guess it could be considered a good beer, if you are looking for something with a lot of flavor, but don't care whether or not those flavors work well together."
"Poured a rich brown amber color with a huge cream colored head that stayed for a while. Smell was very sweet of caramel with an almost a bourbon or whiskey smell to it. The taste was very intresting. Very crisp with a slight touch of alcohol. Sweet caramel malts and a bit of a wooden hop back. This is a very complex beer, I don't think I could begin to explain the taste and do it justice. Very very good, only wish I could get more of it around here!"
"Mad metal props to msubulldog25 for this bottle."
"-Oelergud"
"Solid brew  the regular is just as good and preferable, and the double is better than the oaked (IMO)."
"Drinkability is fine but I really think I prefer the regular version better."
"I am very impressed with this beer. It is strong and complex; definitely worth another sample. Next time, I'll have to get a traditional Arrogant Bastard and compare the two."
"I am going to go ahead and make a controversial statement: that Oaked Arrogant Bastard is the Arrogant Bastard to try. Oaked smooths out much of the bitterness of AB while adding greatly to the flavor, and not diminishing the character, but rather augmenting it. Basically, this is the finest Stone ale there is, and OAB is probably the finest strong ale period. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Tasty and unique, I am glad I finally obtained a bottle of this."
"Man I wish I had some more of these. A little tamer a smoother than its non-oaked brother which is quite nice. At $2.50 a bottle and limited availability this is unfortunatley a brew that I will only be able to have a little of once a year. Bottoms up!"
"D: Not for me. Maybe i'm not ""ready"" for it. Don't know if I ever will be. This highly touted beer falls way flat in my book. When I think American Strong, this isn't what i'd like to imagine. I just don't care for this one."
"Very well done!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a cloudy auburn brown with coppery highlights, slight reddish tinge. Full finger of foamy head slowly passe to a ample sticky lacing with a hazy, thin cap. Aroma is hoppiness right up front, sweet caramelly malt undertones with a slight smoky woodiness, light notes of warming alcohol present as well. Taste starts off with sweet malts/ grapefruity and grassy hops, wood notes round off with the slight alcohol and dark fruitiness. Leaves a slightly bitter and drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick, almost a chewy beer, slick and viscous on the tongue that has a moderate level of carbonation which adds a lighter touch to the mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent, taste is great and has been executed wonderfully by the good folks at Stone. Another level of definition and complexity to an already excellent beer, the oak has calmed and smoothed an aggressive beer into a more enjoyable aggressive beer. Would highly recommend, will purchase again."
"drinkability is good. tasty and somewhat balanced, but not nearly as well as the hopslam i had earlier."
"12oz. bottled on Nov. 10, 06. Poured in my glass dark amber color with a large off white head that sticks to the glass leaving lots of lacing. Smells of fresh floral hops and musk wood scents leave my mouth watering. Taste is amazingly smooth with lots of fresh grassy hops and nice blend of semi sweet malts. Mouth feel is just right not to thin or carbonated. This beer has some strong flavors but is still mellow at the same time. This is by far the best in the Arrogant Bastard line up."
"Dangerously drinkable as alcohol is all but forgotten, but considerabley out of my price range for sessions, instead a tastey treat for special occasions."
"I loved regular AB and Double Bastard, so I was pretty sure Oaked was going to be great - I wasn't disappointed. Wonderfully complex beer that I wish I could get more readily. Cheers again to the folks at Stone!"
"I cannot say anything bad about this beer. I like the Arrogant Bastard, but the oaked version is just as flavorful, but smoother, and the flavors are more rounded out. Instead of having a large separation between the hops and the malt in the Arrogant, the oaked has a very nice melding of these two characteristics, while the hops are just as pungent, aromatic and flavorful."
"hands. Taste of slight smoke and grapefruit with mint and vanilla. woody, bitter finish, but not unpleasant. I could drink a lot of these"
"This is overall just a great beer. I can't wait to buy some more and keep it in my fridge."
"Poured out a nice chocolaty brown with an orange hue, crowned by a bubbly, chunky light tan head, incredible lacing. The nose offers immediate hops, big, green, and citrusy. Lots of grapefruit, some subtle orange, all rounded out by woody oakness. The taste is like fresh squeezed orange juice for a second, then goes grapefruit on you. The hops and bitterness are pretty big, there must be some malt pulling it all back, but I don't really get it above all the citrus pith and the oak that hovers over the palate. There's even a flutter of strawberry bubble gum for a second. The finish is long, fruity, and bitter. The mouthfeel is dead on, good carbonation and smooth, slightly slick and oily on the finish. The downfall might be the drinkability, so much hops, so much oak. One is a lovely visit. More would be uncomfortable."
"Tasty, delicious, ...I like it, but not as much as the Original A.B. So, sue me."
"Mouthfeel is a pleasant coating feel with some nice quenching aspects to it. Very drinkable especially considering the abv of 7.2%. A very nice beer. I have tried this at fests on draught before and I have to say that the bottled version holds up quite well to the draft."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkablity: Like all of the other Stone Brewing beers I've had, this one didn't really disappoint, except for the appearance and smell. You really need to taste this beer to truly appreciate it. If you like the regular Arrogant Bastard and biting in big oak trees at the same time (I don't know how or want to know how), then you absolutely adore this beer."
"Drinkability: An amazing drinking experience, and a wonderful brew. Amazing what just a litte oak can do to a beer like this."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Nice 3+ finger head. Fluffy and tan. The beer is a deep reddish brown (more red than brown) with not much visible carbonation. As it settles the aroma fills the air. Sweet citrus, very mellow, round, and smooth. Buttery hops. and now a taste... Wow. I've had arrogant bastard before but the oaked is SO much better. It's silky smooth and flavorful without having that abrasive tang that regular AB has. It has a thick and smooth mouthfeel that warms your tongue. Better than I expected, I was thinking it was one of those overrated beers that people only thought they liked because it was expensive. Not the case at all. This beer kicks some serious ass."
"very drinkable, a real masterpiece of a beer."
"Slainte!"
"D: Are you worthy? Definitely a great tasting brew. Smooth and well balanced with a good body. They sure like their hops at Stone. Drinkable everyday..."
"The bottom line: My favourite of the impressive Bastard lineup, not quite as abrasive as Double, but the additional oak aspect, and sweeter finale in this one make it my pick of the lot, spectacular stuff."
"Pours a dark amber color with a mediocre tan head. A lovely assault of hops in the nose, mostly citrus. The aroma of hops is complemented by hints of sweet malts and alcohol. The front is smooth and mellow, very sweet with little carbonation. It finishes spicy and bitter from the hops. A nice balance this brew is. A very good ale. I am not sure how much the oaked part makes so next will have to try the non-oaked...."
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber that you can still see through. 1/2"" head disappears but leaves behind nice lacing as the level of liquid lowers. Massive resiny hop smell that I can pick up 3 feet away from my face. Grapefruity hops as well. Tastes much mellower than original AB with an almost sweeter upfront taste. Slams you with a bitter, sticky and resiny aftertaste. Medium bodied with a peppery and prickly carbonation. Extremely drinkable even at 7+%. My only regret is that I didn't pick up more of these."
"Medium bodied with a crisp, dry bitterness. Very drinkable...I would love to find some more of this somewhere. Another excellent Stone product."
"Very foamy mouthfeel, so foamy it almost turns into a cream as I ""swish"" it around my mouth. Very drinkable and I would have to recommend it."
"Pours a clear dark ruby with a huge tan head. The head lasts forever and leaves great lacing. The smell is very pungent with citrus hops and a creamy ""bisquity"" aroma. Lesser smells include vanilla and oak. The taste is a bitter blast of citrus hops followed by a creamy mixture of smoked wood,sweet malt and carmel, vanilla, and alcohol. An excellant tasting beer. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing perfectly making this a classic beer. A truely great beer making me feel not worthy. Cheers."
"Drinkability: This went down smooth for a strong ale."
"Pours a hazy red/brown, small but thick off white head, nice lacing and great retention, this shit sticks. Smell is toffee, vanilla, piney resin, oak, toffee, big malts, big hops, big oak, spectacular. Taste is more of the same, toffee rich maltiness, vanilla and citrus, amazing play between the oak and the piney hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation, thought the carbonation was a touch too aggressive, nice clean bitterness. Fantastic, this deserves its high rating."
"I really dug this one. It had some bite and different flavour but was balanced enough that no one flavour or aroma overpowers you. It's one of my favourites within the oaked phenomenon, if not my favourite. I still am not a huge fan of the beer oaking process overall, but I'd be more than happy to drink this one again and if you are into oaked beers, you're bound to love this one..."
"This is not a balanced beer, but it is a rich, full beer with wonderful bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, full. This is a very very tasty brew, alcohol is deceivingly tasty and/or sneaky. This is definitely less harsh than the regular Bastard, which I also enjoy. I'm not sure whether or not I prefer one to the other... have to have a side by side comparison. However, this one really is more well-rounded and easier to drink. Less sweet than I recall, but then it has been a while. An excellent brew."
"Drinkability is awesome. Complexity and carmel match the 7.2% alcohol well, making this a very balanced beer. Like other top beers, wish I'd bought two of these instead of just one so that I could have another!"
"As dense as this is I couldn't see drinking more than a 12 ounce serving or two at a time but I would definately break this out to warm up a cold night. Where most wood aged beers tend to come off as way too woody to the point where they lose their identities, the oak in this has to wrassle with the deep malts and pungent hops making for a terrific balance of strength, depth and rich texture. Even those that don't like Arrogant Bastard should give this a try. Noteworthy at the very very least."
"Keep in mind that I drank this beer with a medium head cold running its course. I was hoping to taste this beer, and I sure did, but it was not over powering. A delightful mix of hops and malt, with a strong, hop presence. A dark brown, almost ruby color. Not much head, but that might be deceiving, as it took the server a while to bring my brew. Not much evidence of lace in the beginning, but nice pattern as I enjoyed my pint. As far as aroma, I smelled hops, and again, not overpowering, but I can't penalize this brew because of my head cold. I hope this beer is still around when my head cold is gone."
"Admittedly, Im not the hugest Arrogant Bastard fan in the world. I think its a fine beer, but certainly its not near the top or my favorites as it seems to be with others. The oak aging improves it, rounding out the flavors. Definitely glad I picked it up."
"Will definately revisit in a couple months..."
"Full oak induced mouthfeel, very smooth and fulfilling. This beer is great, it has alot of oak character and is surprisingly drinkable despite the cacophany of flavors pounded into the palate."
"It's wicked awsome."
"Cheers, Stone, this beer is great. It's almost everything I was looking to improve in the A.B. and more. Seek-find-drink this beer!"
"Eh, one is enough. This is too mellow and the finish tastes a bit like household cleanser. Overall it is a real disappointment, considering how much I like the regular bastard and most of Stone's other beers. To be honest, I would not have guessed that this was a Stone beer if I did not pour it myself, since it is not up to Stone's standard of excellence."
"I'm not sure that this brew could replace my love for draft AB. It is, however, a nice change from the norm and quite convenient in the six packs."
"D: I don't know how i feel about his overall. Yeah, its an interesting thing to do with an already interesting beer, but it kind of just funks it up and makes it harder to drink and, well, less fun to drink. I'd rather have the Bastard straight, thanks. Next up is the Double Bastard that's in my fridge."
"Glad I got to try this. As stated above, I find this is just as good as AB. Both hoppy bitter beers, but whereas AB is pure hop bitterness, I find the oak finishes with kind of a 'charred' bitterness. Nice to have an oak aged beer that accentuates instead of dominates the original taste though."
"M&D - the mouthfeel is smooth for its potency, but you have to like strong beers obviously, otherwise very nice and balanced and layered nicely, great job stone, though i prefer regular AB"
"I was a fan of this beer the first time I had it. It was a while ago but I swear I remember there being more oak to it. Maybe a year of aging might take the hoppiness away and leave more of the oak. Wasn't sure how old that 3L I had was. I always though that oak is exactly what AB was missing (which is bold to say it's missing anything though). I guess I though it would compliment it very well. I'll hold on to some of these and re-visit next winter."
"Pours a brownish red color with a small head that sticks around a while then disappears as you drink it. Smell is mild with a slight woody odor. Taste is solid, but it doesn't jump out at you. Very hoppy with a nice bitterness to it. Mouthfeel is medium. Overall a good beer. If given the choice between the Oaked and the regular bastard I'd choose the more fruity Arrogant bastard."
"As good as this is, I'm glad I opted for a single 12 oz bottle rather than an $18 sixer. The oak is interesting, but it doesn't make an already awesome brew that much more exceptional."
"Drinkability...I'm not believing the hype with this one. This may be one of the most over-rated beers I've seen on this site IMHO. I'm just not feeling it...""I'm not worthy."""
"I would rate the original Bastard higher than this. Stone has some attractive pricing on many of their excellent offerings, but I'll pass on this one next time."
"Same cough syrup red color with a decent tan head. I honestly do see my difference between this the the regular stuff. Lots of spicey and piney hop aroma. Huge bitterness. Long agressive finish. The oak here is subtle at best. For some reason, I am enjoying this more that the regular bottle I had a couple of weeks ago."
"Smooth syrupy viscous mouthfeel is accompanied by a touch of hot alcohol and some blisteringly bitter hop oils, with pine-like resin flavor characteristics.	I've never loved Arrogant Bastard, but was hoping the oak imparted some quality that would raise this up, much like whatever Stone did to Double Bastard, that makes that such an exceptional beer. That quality is lacking in the Oaked, and though it is better than straight up Arrogant Bastard, it still isn't good enough for me to recommend."
"Thanks for the brew Darren."
"It tastes juicy and bitter, like overestimating a bite out of a grapefruit and grabbing an immoderate amount of rind. There's an initial malt sensation, but it quickly subsides as the hop flavor grows and finishes bitter and dry at the end. I don't want to call it subtle or mellow because there isn't anything delicate about it, but the flavor progresses slowly enough that the drinker is not overwhelmed by the striking level of hops; it's like an Arrogant Bastard in slow motion."
"I could drink a bunch of these if they didn't cost so much."
"I have been trying to track a down a six pack of this beer for a good solid month now, and finally I came acrss it tonight. Pours a lovely ruby red coloration, with a nice sticky white lacing that holds well through the course of the glass. At first musky grain was the only smell I was getting, but after letting it warm up a bit, I picked up on some nice peach and nectarine smells. Taste was big on hops up front, followed by the fruit characters in the background. There was also a certain bitter rye taste after swallowing, mixed with lingering warm alcohol. This is a pretty big beer to be honest, at least on the palate. I was a bit surprised that the alcohol content wasn't a bit higher. I could sit down with a six pack of these and probably finish them off in a night. Having said that, it was much mroe ejoyable sipping this one, and letting it warm a bit to get the full range of flavors and aromas. I must admit that I've never really liked the unoaked Arrogant Bastard, but this one hit the spot with me. I didn't really pick up on the oak addition, but none the less, I liked it alot. Definitely recommended if you can find it."
"D: A fine beer but not one I'd drink everyday. I'd imagined this would be 'amazing' and instead it's just 'very good' with hints of oak-aging. Still I would drink this again, many times over. Try this (if you can find some) and enjoy!"
"Another great beer from Stone and I really enjoyed getting this beer in a 12 oz. bottle. Worth a try if you are a fan of regular Arrogant Bastard."
"d - nice brew, the first time i had this i loved it and this seems to not have the same punch. the first time i had it it had been aged a while and i am planning on doing the same with the others that came with this six pack. i also need to do a side by side with the regular AB to get a good comparison."
"Taste is noticeably smoother than regular Bastard. The oak is indeed there in the taste. A nice woody, vanilla flavor is blended with the bitter, citrusy hops. The malts are sweet and the aftertaste leaves the faint lingerings of oak on the tongue. A fine beer."
"Another winner from stone."
"I'm not a big fan of regular AB, but this is one tasty beer. The oak aging advertisement is misleading. I was expecting the typical flavors from oaking, but this one is much more bitter than regular AB. So much so that it overwhelms much of the other flavors. I would like to get ahold of one of these that has had some cellar time to see if it makes it more balanced."
"Mouthfeel is full, but the finish is a little dry. Highly drinkable. Highly reccomended. I shouldn't have had this one before the original, because there's no where for this beer to go but down. An absolutely outstanding brew."
"D - High. I loved this beer, especially as it warmed up."
"This beer is really fantastic! It is smoother, cleaner, and more drinkable--just a tad less harsh--than the regular Arrogant Bastard. The color is great, the head is beautiful, too. Seriously the best beer I have ever had. For my taste, this beer is perfect!! I look forward to making this my annual Thanksgiving treat."
"Drinkability is middle of the road. One or two 12oz bottles or a single bomber is enough for me. I actually prefer the original Arrogant Bastard to this, which I even feel is overrated a tad."
"Some advice, don't just get a 12 oz., get something bigger. 12 oz. is just a tease."
"Just as intense as the regular version, with just a little bit more complexity."
"(about $4-5 over priced IMO), a great, if overpriced beer from a brewery that usually is a pretty good value for the quality delivered"
"12 ounce bottle."
"A great spin on a classic brew. Out of the 12oz bottle it poured perfectly with a nice dark red color and a perfect off white head. Traditional Arrogant Bastard smell but with more subdued hopiness and a more musty malt/woody scent. The taste was quite a bit different as well with a more mellow flavor and less hop bite. The oak flavors really come out as the beer warms and it gives the aftertaste a very unique flavor. The original Bastard is still king, but this is an excelent spin on a classic. Very recommended."
"Overall, more one-sided and harsher bitterness than I remember the regular Arrogant Bastard."
"D: The beer has a moderate abv, but the hop and oak characters are so intense that you may not make it beyond a bottle or two. The beer is a treasure."
"D: Don't get me wrong, I still finished every sip of this beer. Perhaps I got a bad bottle but I doubt it. I've got the rest of the six pack to update my reviews if I feel its necessary. I'm a huge fan of barrel aged beers...I love the complexity it adds to the brew. This one simply has too much oak."
"Never thought I would see this one in 12oz. bottles. Has the same Arogant Bastard characteristics that makes me so glad that I got into craft beers. As expected, the oak barrels impart a complex woody, nutty, musty, and raw character. It also rounds out the harsh hop and fusal characters of 'regular' Arogant Bastard. The beer comes across much smoother, more delicate, and more compex. Almost a creamy flavor and texture (cotton candy). From the bottle, it seems that the oak flavors, aromas, and nuances are more previlant than the times having it from the growler. I'll sure have more of these in the upcomming months."
"A wonderful version of the Bastard here. The oak wood chips added a lot of complexity and nuances to the beer's flavor. Also, this beer seems much smoother and softer in body and mouthfeel than its predecessor. A must have brew!"
"Overall an EXCELLENT ale. Solid ABV with an excellent drinkability. Head and shoulders above the regular version. Really, just a superior beer."
"A very full body on this beer, great on the palate. It is very satisfying that even though this beer has a high abv it still has a big body as well, especially for being a beer that is not a ""dark beer""-porter or stout etc. As mentioned before the beer finishes dry which compliments the oak character very nicely. Carbonation is not overpowering. As to the drinkability I'll almost definitely buy this again, maybe not this season though. At $18 for a sixer the price hits the pocket book hard. Overall a great brew, which I enjoy perhaps more than the Original AB."
"It's the great taste of Arrogant Bastard feathered by a well-integrated earthy oak addition. It's still extreme, but in a less extreme way. The solid ABV is warming, and in no way an obstacle. The original is edgy and a breeze to drink. This one is every so slightly softer, and maybe even a bit breezier. It's better than good, it's wood."
"D- It's once again a amazing big beer. It isn't as good as the regular one but is pretty darn close."
"Drinkability: the old reliable bastard with a twist. Nice change of pace from the standard and it peaks your interest. Nice beer."
"D: Quite good, however I was hoping that this would be a bit more different than its unoaked counterpart. To me, the differences are so subtle, that it probably isn't worth the premium to get the oaked version. However, the 12-oz serving size is a plus."
"I like to enjoy this beer with small sips, not because it's strong, but to really soak up the vanilla oakiness in the finish. These flavors are a bit subtle, so definitely let the beer warm some to bring them out. This, paired with the solid hop bitterness provide a good balance and really make this beer worth drinking."
"Highly recommended for fans of extremely flavorful, rich, full-bodied beers. I prefer this slightly over this year's Double Bastard."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth mouth and a zesty swallow. Fine."
"Notes: Wow, what a great beer. Hard to believe they could top the original Arrogant Bastard, but here we are. I love the oaky, woody flavors and thats smooth, creamy mouthfeel."
"Mellow, darkish ruby with a glowing glow. Thick, whipped, creamy, sticky, bright sandy brown head. Very nice to look at. Nose is rich caramel rolls and fruit punctuated by vanilla, oak, and resinous hops. Taste is [not surprisingly] much like ""regular"" AB. However, there is a definite added complexity/dimension with the oaky, madeira, vanilla flavors. The hops are still aggressive, but the added malt complexity balances them much better. What am I trying to say here? This is damn good beer! Finish is slightly warming and redolent of a fine Scotch. Here's hoping this is released in 6 packs every year."
"Drinkability: I was in one of the most uncomfortable parts of LA, the service was awkward, and my meal was overpriced, but I forgot all about that when I was drinking this beer."
"I'm not sleeping oh no no.."
"This was my first time trying the oaked version of the AB and was pleasantly surprised. The beer really took on a big and very noticeable difference that makes this beer more complex and IMO more tastey beer."
"Scrubbing carbonation teases my palate and a medium yet somewhat crisp mouthfeel leave yearning for more. Get this brew, it's golden!!! I would drink this year round if possible."
"pours nice and clear reddish-brown with a straw colored 1 inch head. nice lacing. aroma is citrus and piney hops with a touch of whiskey. first taste is a woody, vanilla malt, but immediately gives way to grapefruit citrus hops of the original AB. the pineapple i love in the original AB is missing, but i guess that's part of what makes this different. finishes slightly resinous, bitter and dry. wood carries through to the end, and you can taste this flavor on your lips. surprisingly smooth and crisp at the same time. i find this slightly more enjoyable than the AB, and i'm interested in trying this with some age, although it's wonderful fresh."
"D- like its other bastard kin, shouldn't (definitey could, and have) drink more than a couple of these in a night, a good move by stone to put them in 12 oz's this year, wont look forward to it as much as the double, but will definitely be picking up a few of these each december for quite a while"
"Pours a beautiful deep ruby red color with some amber highlights. A huge fluffy cream colored, almost yellow head forms. Tons of delicate, sticky lacing is left behind as the head fades. Good head retention. Excellent smelling brew! Big malts and hops, candy, kinda boozy, with a nice oaky aroma in the background. Some citrusy smells with hints of vanilla. Quite bitter on the tongue, duhh!! Tastes like Arrogant Bastard with wood! Lots of hops upfront with the malts taking a backseat. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, but leaves a nice crisp feeling on the tongue, kinda dry. A pleasure too drink, I like this a little better than the original. I hope to find some more, nice job Stone!"
"drinkability: the most drinkable strong ale I've had to date."
"I got a six pack from the last case at Hi-Times. This stuff is going fast. So if you see it, grab it."
"I still can't say this is one of my favorite Stone beers: I prefer the refreshing quality of their IPA or the complexity of their Old Guardian, Ruination, or Imperial Russian Stout. I will qualify this by saying that I don't really have a basis of comparison as far as what an American Strong Ale should taste like, so I can't judge to style. I can appreciate it for what it is, though, and I will have an easy time spreading out my consumption of these over the next several months or even years and seeing how the experience evolves."
"A huge Huge thanks to fellow Buffalo area BA Orfeu for leaving some of this and a few other gems on my porch tonight!Poured into a brandy snifter a deep amber infused with some tawny brown a big fluffy almond colored head atop leaving multiple sheets of lace as it settled into a soapy-like top.The only let down of this beer in my mind was the nose seemed a bit unasumming some faint vanilla and caramel and hints of orange peel.Oh man the flavors are definently Not unassuming where to begin here caramel sweetness and woody tones at first sip the vanilla from the oak becomes prevelant a big drying spicey hoppiness really hits and hits hard just making it oh so drinkable and balanced.As the beer warms the alcohol heat comes thru more but not outta hand,oh so beautiful a beer I just loved it."
"Picked up a six for 14.99 and I'm a little disappointed. IMO, this brew was no different in taste, smell, appearence, and mouthfeel than Arrogant Bastard. Still a great looking ruby red w/ a 2 inch creamy amber head and left an excellent amount of lacing. The taste and aroma was similiar to AB. Malty caramel, toffee, citrus hoppy w/ a well balanced sweet-bitter ending. I failed to smell and taste any oak barrel, even after drinking 4/12 oz bottles. Well, I guess if OAB and AB are similar to me, I'll score it the same."
"I got a bit of sticker shock, never paid that much for a six pack before, [12.46] but after reading the forums [and doing the math] It's really not such a bad deal after all, and maybe it would be nice to have this and other richer stone offerings in 12 oz bottles."
"12 oz. bottle - Dark molasses color with a tint of red head is tan , medium , small bubbles  nose of dark berries ( cherries ) , cinnamon , coffee grounds and orangey  taste of malts , gummy tar , spruce , hopps ( both bitter , and pine ) caramel , and some wood ( mostly cedar )- medium tart body  aftertaste is long earthy , malt and caramel"
"Very drinkable. In my honest opinion more so than regular Arrogant bastard. I think the oak does wonders for this beer. It really smooths the flavors out."
"Overall a little too hoppy and not enough balance. No doubt this will make a lot of hop heads happy."
"Somewhat syrupy and oily mouthfeel, full-bodied with ample carbonation. A lot lighter bitterness than the AB, so it's definitely a step above as far as drinkability. This is one incredible brew, Stone's done it again."
"M - Yep, this is most excellent. Good job Stone. Pump up that Barry on a few more beers. I love it."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a nice white head and minimal lacing. Surprising considering the amount of hops here. Smell is immediately of oak, dry bittering hops, and slight malt sweetness. Taste is a blast in the face of bittering hops, dry in the back of the throat aftertaste. Oak melds pretty well with the hops and kind of eases the hop assault. Nice thick mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable, I can see it paired with a nice sharp cheddar."
"Eric"
"And it is reallly amazing with my curried chicken and rice."
"Can drink very easily"
"Love this stuff !"
"Drinkability: All of the flavors, smells and alcohol are quite intense, but also constructive. This is not a session brew by any means, but takes some thinking to get through the glass. Kudos on a fantastic beer lesson; complexity 101."
"This beer would probably not make a great session beer. The flavor is very aggressive, and therefore, after a few, it might get old. Also, the alcohol content is a little high, so drinking too many would be a problem."
"I prefer this one to the regular Bastard. It takes it to a whole new level, and it's great. Awesome stuff."
"Overall this has been my favorite new beer experience in a long, long time. While it is a bit pricey, in my mind it was well worth it."
"Okay, this last 1/3 of the beer has sat at least a half hour. Oranges early in the taste. Esters are low, which was deceiving, as the mouthfeel sets up an expectation. Just a little bit of alcohol heat. Touch of cherry sour. Cascade hop smell and flavor. IMO, this beer was fairly disappointing. Needs more sweet and some esters to accompany the mouthfeel and fill out the beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit creamy with laid back carbonation, making this really easy to drink. A tasty oak aged brew that still on the lower end of the abv spectrum for these kinda beers. I'd happily drink much more of this if given the chance. Maybe I'll have to plunk down the change for a bottle of my own someday, but for now I'll just have to be thankful for whoever the kind soul was that brought this and allowed me the opportunity to sample it! Stone strikes again!"
"Mouth: Most prominently smoky and bitter, the fruity entrance of this beer does not meet the expectations set by the complex aroma. Also, I would prefer that the beer maintained a more strongly carbonated mouth-feel, but I think that the size of the head (which remained consistent to the very last glass of the bottle) uses up a fair amount of the bubbles. The oakiness, while very interesting and enjoyable, seems to be so bitter as to cover up the much needed malty sweetness. A little unbalanced, but over-all an enjoyable 3L celebration."
"D - Overall, this beer is slightly underwhelming given the hype and rarity. And the math doesn't work out in favor of the consumer. The bottle is 101.4 oz., which equals 6.33 pints... maybe 8 pints if you leave room for head. At $70 a bottle, you're talking $8.75 a glass. Now, I could justify this price for a full pint on tap... but not for a glass at home from a bottle that you inevitably have to have others pitch in to finish."
"-UF"
"Dark reddish color & thick beige head. Love the woody oak character. Huge toasted malts and resinous hops make up the majority of flavor, with some subtle vanilla tagged on. Remains very smooth down to the last drop. I truly prefer the oaked version over the regular Arrogant Bastard. The oak really adds another dimension of flavor and complexity to the already great brew. I think bottling this in a 3-liter is just downright hilarious, but it's probably the coolest looking bottle you'll ever come across."
"Much smoother than it's unoaked sibling. Cinnamon, vanilla, toasty oak. Very well integrated and somewhat complex. A much higher RS than the unoaked version. Still good hop component and big roasty malt flavors. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Would love to drink a whole 3 liter."
"Still a helluva powerful brew, but powerful in a more palatable way. I love AB, but maybe because it tests my fortitude. The oaked AB is lovable because it tastes fantastic."
"Happy to get the chance to try this one on tap at Redbones in Somerville, didn't know it was available on tap, as I had only seen the super sized bottles. Anyway, poured the expected dark dark murky amber, with a tan, thick head, and leaving tons of sheeting and sticky lacing. Nose of heavy malts and some coca-cola. Strong, heady brew, lots of malty/hoppy goodness, more cola, vanilla, dark honey and Stone ballysness, oak/wood present but certaintly not overpowering, would love to have the chance to do a side by side tasting of the oaked and non oaked versions. Fine brew from the Stone crew."
"That's faint criticism at best, and I can't wait to compare the on-tap variety."
"flavor is similarly balanced. grassy hops with caramel malts, vanilla and a bourbon soaked finish. medium-high carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. better than the regular AB, which is overwhelmingly hoppy in the flavor; the aging has mellowed out the hops and allowed the malts to shine through."
"This beer is really all over the map. It is very good, no doubt. It is very attractive in the glass, with a supple head. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy, which I appreciate. Many beers sacrifice a full-body for the sake of drinkablility, but this is not one. The taste is a wonderfully complex mess. The bourbony oak flavor is pretty distinct, but far from overwhelming. The hops are very mellow, and I keep having to pinch myself to remind myself that I'm drinking Arrogant Bastard. The kick just isn't there; rather, there is a wonderfully complex taste that is nutty, fruity, and just overall delicious. While I'm not sure I could drink it all night, I consider this beer a treat. I have been very critical of the one-sidedness of regular Arrogant Bastard, but I find the Oak-Aged to be very good."
"an exceptional beer, I was lucky enough to find this at the fantastic Linwood Grille in Boston."
"Oddly, I prefer the standard Arrogant Bastard over the oaked version. I had such hig hopes for this, but it just didn't quite deliver. A solidly good beer all around, but not nearly as good as I had hoped... IMO, save your money and stick with the standard A.B."
"Highly recommended."
"p.s. My friends at Stone in Escondido, CA have started making Oaked Arrogant available in six-packs!! Yay!! The price is about double for other beer, but then, the flavor is about double too..."
"flavor is a very melllow complex. There is a whole lot going on but not too much of any one thing. The oak adds a dimension that really brings the flavor home and keeps everything subdued and enjoyable. More strong molasses andsome deep-woods piney hops give a nice sweet base with a just slightly bitter bite to it all. Got some black cherry, fig and raisin flavors out of it also. Full body that was extremely smooth and not-quite creamy. Absolutely amazingly drinkable and enjoyable."
"On tap at BW3 in Indy. A 10 oz. pour, served in a chalice. Mahogany in color and cloudy. Thin white head which disappeared immediately. Hop aroma is restrained by the oakyness. Good caramel and toffe like flavors as in the original AB, but the hops are much softer, along with a slight smoky flavor. This is much more smooth than the original. The body seemed a bit lighter to me. Still very good, but lost some of the in your face hoppy character that I enjoy from the original. All in all, a good treat, and a good chance to compare what adding some oak character does to an already great beer."
"Served up as a full pint, Oaked Bastard is a cloudier version of the garnet-brown hued ""regular"" stuff. 1/2"" of thick beige froth. The nose, unfortunately, was a bit more subdued than I expected -- perhaps from being served a little on the cold side? Anyway, Chinook vapors and roasted caramel malts wafted up, just not as strong as the non-oaked AB I've sampled. The taste is certainly that of the Bastard I know and love, yet different: softer, rounder, fruitier, more vanilla hints (the oak probably?) -- yet the brutal hops and malts abide. The mouthfeel on OAB is creamier and smoother. Medium bodied and chewy. I went back for more the other day and it was gone. :( Blessed nectar."
"A few of us (including grub, Wintermute, and TheBeerFruit) shared this one on New Year's Eve alongside the standard Arrogant Bastard. It was quite an educational experience, as far as what using oak can do to a beer. You could pick out all the character of the Arrogant Bastard, but with a little something extra. Our bottle poured with just a bit of haze and the lacing was thick and clumpy throughout. There was an earthy woodiness that melded nicely into the aroma and flavour, kind of filling in the gaps between the other characters. There was also a light vanilla flavour that was quite nice. The texture was creamy and smooth as silk. Overall, this is just a little better balanced and more complex than your garden variety Bastard (and I'm not knocking the original here) and definitely a treat."
"In conclusion - this beer is quite rare, but if you ever have the opportunity to try it, DO IT!"
"overall- This is a big and flavorfull beer. Compared to regular arrogant bastard, oaked has a much smoother feel and a little more depth in the flavor."
"The beer is quite tasty, but the oak is fairly subtle at this point. In the end this is a good thing, because if the oak was heavy handed it would really clash with the fresh, vibrant hoppiness that is characteristic of this beer. When paired with some Mexican food the Oak character really starts to become noticeable; it becomes much more woody with a pronounced buttery-oak type note in both the aroma and taste. But it still does not dominate the overall hoppy quality of this beer. This is a solid beer all around, and one which I enjoyed trying."
"Cloudy beautiful orange-copper pour that displays a huge dark beige head. Balanced and complex americanized hop-malt monster surprises with powdered cocoa notes amidst the bready and thick malts, fully letting the way to the heavily earthy, rooty, soily hops bearing a bite of citrus. Mango fruitiness, well contained oak and pepper peak through, but it fails to really impress due to a pronounced astringency and more acidity than Id like. Dry medium body, powdery texture, not too bitter, quite alcoholic."
"3 liter bottles shared with myself. Dark brownish red with a huge fluffy tan head that seemed to stay around forever while covering the glass was thick lace rings. Sweet caramel and fruits with that arrogant bastard hoppiness backing it up. Very light woody notes as it warmed but they were minimal. Sweet caramel covered dark fruits over some bitter citric hops. Nice balance overall. Some woody notes were more apparent here than in the nose and seemed like it came out more than when I tried it fresh. Dry citric bitter fruity finish that sticks with you for awhile. It seemed a bit to mellowed at this point though. Pretty solid mouthfeel with good thickness and creaminess. I find the regular version to be more drinkable but this was still fairly easy to get through a bottle that big. Glad I drank it now because I cant see this getting better with more age."
"Had on tap at 'bones. Dark amber, low head. Aroma was of that coveted candied hoppiness that I really like. What I like about this one was the prefect balance of malt to hops...neither overpowered the other, nice job. Oakiness wasn't that detectable, although I thought perhaps it added some dryness to the taste/mouthfeel."
"Notes: No problems recommending this to anyone. Very strong and addictive."
"Really psyched to finally get to try this one...and especially on tap."
"If your a fan of arrogant bastard this is a must try. The oak ageing adds a whole new level to an already fine brew. Appearance was the same as the original but when I leaned in for a whiff it was a whole new brew. Woody, hoppy, with a heavy malt body that seems to be the boss. It is actually a settled down version of the original...all the tastes are a bit more subtle and add in a richer body and the wood and you have a gem. Had this at Naja's at a beer advocate social after hearing the guys talking about it. Thanks for the heads up...great great brew."
"If you can still find it buy it now, this is by far the best incarnation of Arrogant Bastard."
"This was simply one of the best and most unique beers I have ever tried. If you have the opportunity, do your tongue a favor and try this. Outstanding."
"Drinkability: I'm worthy, but I think I'll stick to normal AB unless this comes out in bombers (not bloody likely I hear). A good Stone effort."
"Excellent drinkability. Alot more force and stuff going on in this beer than the -- dare methinks -- ""low"" ABV."
"As I poured the first glass, I had the impression that there would be no head, but it ended up forming a nice light and velevty head on an intense opaque amber brown color body. The smell is extraordinarily fresh and shows a great bouquet of red fruits with a very enjoyable sweetness. Also lighter hints of citrus, with a grapefruit character appearing slowly and getting deeper in the taste. Yeasty notes of vanilla appear after a while. The taste is way more aggressive than the smell. The very dry hoppiness invades and conquers the mouth with together with some oily notes. As for red fruits and citrus, their influence switched from the one they had in the smell: the once dominant red fruits notes are more subtles in the taste, as the grapefruity character took over. The aftertaste gets quite dry and grassy. The oaked aspect appears together with notes of cherry that create a slightly floury feeling on the tongue. Mouthfeel is enjoyably lighter than expected. Its complexity stimulates all the parts of the mouth and of the tongue. This surprizingly soft mouthfeel contributes to the great drinkability of theis character brew."
"Basically, I feel that the Bastard is already a full-throttle beer and the oak-aging is wasted on it. Sure, the oak is present (and it's drying, woody character does help to tone down and smooth the beast a bit), but does it really help to improve the character of the beer? I'd say not. It's different, but it's not better. And there's just too much going on to really enjoy the character of the wood (although it is oak-chips, right?). Good, but not great."
"Dark reddish copper with a lovely, thick cap of white foam that lasts, lasts, and lasts. Leaving excellent lacing on my tulip glass. The aromas are excellent and although similar to those of the regular arrogant bastard they also exhibit hints of vanilla, oak and caramel. Yum. The taste is hoppy and malty up front with some lovely oak notes and vanilla hints in the middle. The finish is slightly boozy, malty, hoppy, and oaky all at the same time. This is a lovely blend of flavors here. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, thick, bw, and cask-like and the drinkability is only hindered by the fact that this stuff will get you drunk all-too-fast. It is still too bad that this stuff is all gone from Philadelphia. Does anyone want to send me a growler, or split a chained 3L bottle? Tracy?"
"Drinkability- One of the best beers I have ever had. Everything comes together so well in this beer. How I wish they had this beer in the bomber size bottles."
"Poured deep and woodsy amber/ruby brown and clear with a think khaki ring and slight cloudy dusting in the center. Lovely. Perfect amount of carbination, not too much, just enough to let you know it is there, but not fizzy or ""fluffy"" feeling. The mouthfeel is very good. Bit under medium bodied. Scents of piney loveliness and vanilla. Nice and dry with dark, hoppy bites. Tastes of grapefruit rinds and gin, whiskey woodsiness. Touch of vanilla hits you at the end. AB is always such a drinkable one for me, and man, add some wood to it, and now it is even more so. Yum. Sad to see this one end!"
"Mouthfeel is good with a nice supporting level of CO². This is a funky beer in that where I expected smoothness, I received harshness. While I am certain that much time and expense went into the oak aging, the effect is lost when it becomes overbearing."
"In short, this is an amazing beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Finish is very strongly bitter, but not unpleasant."
"3 ltr... Poured a copper color with an off white head and spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of vanilla, cherry fruitiness, and a mild hoppiness. Taste was the typical Ab grapefruit bitterness, with intense malt. Finished with vanilla and more hops. I enjoyed this more mellow version of AB."
"A great experience, a 3 litre bottle shared with many fans. Beautiful dark colour, pour. Excellently hopped,moderated by choice malts, oak bits give flavour. Bitter and wine-like finish and aftertaste. Pine and some grapefruit in nose. Carmel and grapefruit in mid-sip. Medium-full mouthfeel. A bit too oaky from the oak chips, that was less so on-tap two years later when tried at Solena Beach Pizza Port."
"Served from the always attractive 3L bottle. Luckily we had a new garbage can anda bunch of ice around to chill this bad boy. I have to give the apperance/presentation a 5 because this bottle is so damn cool with the lock and all. The beer itself poured beautifully and looked exacctly like the ""un-Oaked"" Arrogant Bastard we poured side-by-side. A creamy, frothy head that cascades down the sides of the Arrogant Bastard flute-like glass. The head on the oaked AB lasted the entire glass and then some. Fluffy, soft bubbles formed a nice stiff heaed atop this beer. The aroma is hoppy and sweet but not nearly as stong with the hops as the regular AB. A bit of citrus in the nose as well. The flavor is smoky sweet with a burnt wood flavor. This beer is very very smooth. A lot of the hoppiness has mellowed out to make this a more malty tasting brew. Notes of currant, caramel, and mango fill in the flavor well. It is a slight bit thinner in the mouth but is still very velvety and smooth on the palate. Aging with oak is a definate improvement upon an already exceptional beer."
"I finally got a night set aside to drink this 3L, just me and a friend taking on this monster. Once I fumbled the lock off and popped the flip top I stuck my nose right in the bottle and took a big whiff...oh yeah, that's oak...sniffing from the bottle musty oak aromas were what I detected most of all. Once poured into a glass the body of the beer is a deep ruby brown, somewhat hazy, yet slightly translucent. The head is off-white with a yellow oiliness to it. This head is a champ when it comes to retention and lace and lasts through-out practically each entire glass adding to the overall experience. The aroma in the glass is lovely, hops are a bit downplayed when compared to the bastard in his original state, husky oak undertones and of course the dense caramelly goodness of the malt. The flavor totally corresponds, dense velvetty malts, subtle hints of husky oak, tiny pokes of vanilla flavor and dense piney hops. The oak aging process does wonderful things to the bastard...if only it weren't so damned expensive in this particular packaging, I'd still recommend getting one for the experience though."
"Update  Popped the 06 right after it came out. This is edgy right off the shelf. The oak is raw. I keep checking my cheeks for splinters. This has a lot of spank that needs to be cellared out unless of course you like a little smack to go along with your bastard, which of course we all do. I suggest drinking fresh and aging as well."
"Thanks to Greg Koch for sending Oak Aged Arrogance out this way. I debated whether I preferred this to the standard Bastard, and I admit they both have their own unique characteristics; the everyday Bastard slaps you in the face with flavor, while this is more nuanced and subtle (words I never thought I'd use to describe Stone!!!) and equally enjoyable in its own way. Quite good, and if this growler is my last then I will be drinking more of these next year!!"
"3 Liter bottle split up with my boys Kevin (kmpitz2) and Chris (clvand0) and poured into a tall stemmed Arrogant Bastard glass. It pours a deep brownish ruby red color with three towering fingers of head. Bigass chunks of lacing all down the sides of the glass. The smell is a little less hoppy than regular Arrogant Bastard. It still has some citrusy aromas, and some dark fruit aromas as well, such as cherry. The taste is rich and malty at first. Lots of cherry, wood, and earthy flavors. The finish is a great balance of hops with a hint of oak. The flavors just all come together in perfect harmony. The mouthfeel is extraordinary, so thick and so smooth. The drinkability is fantastic for a 7.2% brew. A damn near perfect beer. I wanted to give it a perfect 5, but I'm gonna hafta agree with Kevin here. For as strong as the flavor is, there could be just a little bit more in the nose. Nevertheless, the beer was just a treat to drink and an honor to share with Kev and Chris."
"I split this 3 liter brew with two other BA's - kmpitz2 and sheepnutz. The bottle is superb with its lock and chain. Poured into a 22oz Arrogant Bastard glass. It pours a red color with a very tall head that has great retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. The hoppy aroma seems subdued in this version, but still very much present ... just more balanced. The flavor is great. Caramel malts with a lot of American hops - citrus, earthy. The oak is very apparent in the flavor as well. Thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"Hazy reddish-brown in color, with a long-lasting tan head that makes a tolerable effort to lace the glass. Aromas are certainly nice, but not what I'd expected. There's a pervasive oak character here but not the hop bitch-slap I'd expected from the Arrogant One. Flavor really threw me. I've had The Bastard before and this is nothing like it. Not nearly as boisterous in the hops and alcohol department. Lots of oaky character, with some residual sweetness on the palate. There's hops in here, but not nearly in the quantity I'd hoped. Finish is on the dry side. Mouthfeel is good but I wasn't blown away like I've been with other Stone beers. As AKSmokedPorter said...had I not known beforehand that this was oaked Bastard, I never would have thought this came from the Stone brewery."
"As nice as it was, a glass was appropriate, and I feel the number of days that I'd prefer this beer are quite few."
"Ive never been crazy about Arrogant bastard (always felt the double bastard and imperial stout from stone blew it away), but OMFG, this is one killer beer. The aging mellows it a lot and really brings out the malt notes and softens the bitterness. At the same time the woody/oak quality add a whole new dimension to the beer. Very nice. I wish theyd bring this out full time alongside the regular arrogant bastard in 22oz."
"On draft at Anam Cara, this beer came to me in a tulip glass. The color was a dark hazy red/brown with a decent cream colored head. The lace draped on the side of the glass. The aroma was a decent blend of malt and hops. The flavor had malt with a hint of Christmas candy and some brown sugar, with a touch of hop flowers. A mild alcohol finish. I think the oak mellows the hops not the alcohol. Medium slick mouth feel. Medium drinkability. I couldnt drink too much as you still sense the alcohol."
"Not worth the $70 for a 3L bottle, but benmiliron and I split the cost and now that we did it once we don't have to do it again."
"Drinkability: Well, I'm working on a 3L bottle as we speak. Because once it warms its flavor significantly betters, I would rate this brew as quite drinkable; however, in order to savor as much of the beer's flavor as possible, I would suggest getting some friends to help you out when dealing with a large quanitity of this ale, such as the 3L bottle. Regardless, it's damned tasty!"
"Draught. Copper. Aroma consisted of the typical lemony and grapefruit like hops and toasted and caramel like malts that are usually present in the standard Bastard. Added notes of strawberry jam, vanilla and toasted oak became evident in the nose as well. In terms of flavor, the hops toned down a lot. Toasted oak and vanilla became evident as well. I had this on draught twice on two different days. It wasnt that good and this isnt what I consider to be an improvement. But you might."
"I almost wet my pants when this beer appeared at the festival, but I was sorta disappointed when I finally got it."
"A somewhat hazy brown, the head a tan crown that was creamy in texture, the lace a thick coating upon the glass, with the nose sweet with the aroma of malt and Oak, hints of alcohol and bubble gum, yummy is a good description. Start was ambrosial, thick with malt, the top moderate to full in its feel. Finish was moderate in its a acidity, the hops delightful, quite dry and a bit of a tummy warmer, one damn fine beer in this old dawgs book."
"If you have the option, try this one, it is great! The balance between hop and malt is unlike any other Stone offering I have had before. Hope to get to try it again sometime."
"Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard Ale is a wondrous brew that I could have been happy drinking all night. Alas, this was not to be but I hope to once more indulge in this great offering from Stone again soon. This is liquid gold worth going great lengths to try if given the opportunity."
"Drinkability- this beer goes down very well, but the alcohol kick was quite strong. A couple of these and I was done. Overall, this was an excellent beer, and I am pleased to have had the chance to try it."
"In sum, very drinkable, as the oak-aging softened, rounded, and deepened this beers character. The oak-aging really helped this beer alot, more than it might help other ones, I feel. Really made a great turn on the bottle version, taking it to an exceptional level."
"This beer is a work of art. I was lucky enough to try this at the Stone 12 beers event in NYC and it was in the opinion of many I was with, the ""Best in Show"". It had the same intense blend and balance between the sweet, slightly roasted malt, explosive citrus and firey hop flavor and bittering, but an added deep, smokey roundness that mellowed and softened it into someting incredible. I had 3 and still tried all 12 beers. Thank God for trains. An absolute taste treat for the hop lover. Lets hope the Stone boys keep putting thier Bastard in oak and sending it east!"
"It was one of the first beers they ran out of at the fest and rightly so. I was duly impressed. I cant wait until Stone makes it to stores near me. I am craving my next one already."
"Bottom Line: A truly special experience for which I’m glad I was present. Thanks Greg!"
"On tap at the Blind Tiger. Deep hazed brick red brown colour with a special looking lace … one bad ass looking beer. A mad but “oh so confident” oily hop aroma with a one-two slap of faint alcohol and sweetness says “who’s your daddy”. The minty hop flavour puts the tongue in a headlock and the it drops a pungent grapefruit dropkick to the palate. Malt is there for the three count and vague hints of wood leaves a puckering dizzy feeling. This beer was like a suplex off of the top rope for me."
"Loved it; one of the highlights and I definitely prefer this over the non-oak version. The aging added a whole other depth of complexity and smoothness to the beer."
