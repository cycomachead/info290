The flavor is sweet and delicious - not like other beers that I can think of.  This might be a nice dessert beer (typically a role filled by stouts).

The aroma is of burnt brown sugar and yeast for the most part. Lots going on with the taste than the nose would have you think as there is some caramel, pine, hops with a hint of dark fruits. Great taste but has a slight bitter hoppy finish that lasted a bit too long for my liking. You can't taste the alcohol at all, which is strange since it is so close to 10%!

This is just a DIPA on the maltier side. With that being said, id consider this and 90 minute the best beers in that regard. And perhaps even Great Divide Herculese. All are great examples of a malty IPA done right. This one has a great balance between bitter hops and sweet malt, and goes down extremely smooth, especially considering the abv. Id rather go for a Lil Sumpin Sumpin, Hop Stoopid,  or Sucks, but as far as a malty IPA goes, this is a winner.","Bone53","Feb 04, 2015"

Without reading any of the label but the name, I thought it was going to be a brown ale. It poured into a pint glass with a beautiful copper color and the fluffy creamy white head immediately came to life, and stayed! It left quite a bit of lacing with each sip. Boy, what a nice looking ale. When I smelled it, the hops drifted up but not too strong, with some nice malts to blend in. The taste was just wonderful. The fact that I was completely caught off guard with the type of beer this was really enhanced the favors for me. No preconceived notions. The hops was right up front but not too strong. Think of a mild IPA. The malts were just right but what knocked it out of the park for me was the sweet flavors. Then I read the label. Brown cane sugar! It really works well with the malty flavors to produce what has become a new favorite of mine. It was not overly carbonated nor to thin. It was just right for me. While the sweetness of the cane sugar may be too much for some, this is one ale you should try. I was also very surprised to see that it had a 9.99% ABV! It completely disappears into what I think is an excellenty crafted ale. Kudos Lagunitas!","trebbates","Jan 12, 2015"

I also really like that this beer comes in a six pack. It gives me a chance to try it over the next few months to see the hop character fade and the brown sugar maltiness come to the forward. I don't think it was a very expensive 6-pack either. $12-13 I think. That is an excellent value for money when you consider that this is the better part of 10% alcohol. The use of cheap brown sugar instead of the more expensive malted barley. Great job Lagunitas!","ClavisAurea","Jan 05, 2015"

Smells hoppy like an IPA, but without as much citrus. I'm getting mostly brown sugar and hops. Mouthfeel is bitter and dry. Definite alcohol warmth and a numbing mouthfeel as beer warms. Overall, looks can be deceiving. Expected something more with this one, but certainly worth the $2 from a local Ohio grocer.","Jonoesh5","Jan 05, 2015"

The smell is fruity and floral, with citrus and piney notes, and just a bit of malty sweetness. The taste is fantastic, with some sweet malty flavors, some wonderful fruity and grassy flavors- just great! The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with just a light touch of prickly carbonation. Overall, this is one great beer- what I've come to expect from Lagunitas.","timontheroad","Dec 17, 2014"

Aroma is of hops and sweetness, kinda nice. The hop bitterness and the brown sugar hit at the same time, providing a very pleasant blend of flavors. They are balanced so well that they are fighting each other to be on top. Sugar leaves a little in the aftertaste, leaving a nice cool hop bitterness with a touch of citrus rind, not bad.

Body is a deep red amber in tone.  Nose is an interesting balance of both sweet and hoppy.  You get both grassy hops and sassafras candy in the smell.  Taste is of resin based hops and chewy sassafras candy resembling the nose considerably.  Well balanced between the malt and the hops this is scary easy to drink for nearly 10% alcohol.  I am really in love with Lagunitas this year, they have been so consistent.  I am putting extras of these away in the cellar to see what magic works in a brew that I believe will age spectacularly well.","SPLITGRIN","Dec 06, 2014"

First thing I smell when cracking the bottle is.... you guessed it! BROWN SUGAR! not overly sweet knock you out brown sugar aroma, just a nice deep smell that isn't over powering. Also smells of tropical and piney hops, not much of a malt smell. The taste is just awesome, exactly like the aroma. This is so easy to drink it's dangerous. I'd even go to say that it's easier to drink than a pale ale. It's just so smooth being 9.99% ABV. In conclusion,  this is one of the best beers I've ever tried.

I disagree, as I feel that hairy eyeball is much more balanced and tastier than brown shugga. But as with everything else; if you've enjoyed this in the past then that's all that matters.

The taste was great with a nice balance. First some sweetness and wonderful grapefruit notes from the bitter hops. Very refreshing.","WhiteHillsStore","Nov 20, 2014"

Taste has some good caramel malt, yeast mild orange and bitter hops. Palate is a medium to full body, carbonation is good and a smooth mouth feel. Finishes with a good caramel malt and yeast flavor followed by citrus, orange notes and bitter ending for balance. Considering this is a barley wine it is not as strong, reminds me more of an DIPA, but it is still good. Overall very good, smooth, balanced and flavorful brew.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

4,-0.7,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,"So Alberta missed out on the Brown Shugga train this last season so I had to wind up in sunny (this time) Victoria BC to snag a 6-pack. How exactly do distributors make these sorts of decisions? In any event, I got to relive the experience and now can write a legit review of this beer on the basis of more than fuzzy memory traces (particularly fuzzy considering the ABV on this heavy hitter). Color is lighter than expected, a clear reddish brown with generous amounts of sturdy light beige head. Smell is intensely sweet and malty, yet with a hop presence that makes one think IPA, fruity with a wisp of pine. Is this beer a barleywine, a double IPA, or a key example of the shades of gray, ill-defined ""Americans strong"" category? Probably a hybrid that features elements of all these styles. The palate is extremely fruity for starters, fruit punch, grilled pineapple, and candied boozy peaches carrying the top note and some faint cherry and plum in the background. There is also a tangerine peel, pepper, and faint pine hop presence that serves to cut the heavy-duty brown sugar sweetness, and to my palate the sugar is not as prominent as the name and initial expectation might suggest. This beer is surprisingly drinkable, on the thin side of moderate, and the well-concealed booze makes things even more dangerous, although I find that the alcohol presence does grow over the course of a bottle or two. Moderate carbonation and finishes sweet yet with some added medicinal bitterness not apparent at the front end. Hoppier, lighter, and perhaps sweeter than its stablemate Hairy Eyeball but certainly a close cousin, with some IPA ancestry apparent as well. I'd drink this on a semi-regular basis if it was more available in my neck of the woods. Maybe my liver is glad it is pretty scarce.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 29, 2014"

Lagunitas is the best value out of California out here in PA. A case of stone Ipa costs me 43 bucks while this is about the same price as this brew that is more complex and alcoholic. sucks is good but it's a totally different beer and is probably an easier drinking beer but if these two were side by side for the same price there's no question i'd pick the Brown shugga","deeznuts420","Feb 09, 2014"

Almost a washed cheese rind flavor like trappist cheese. I can't tell if I really like it or not. Which may be why this beer has captured my attention. Its like stinky cheese; you don't particularly like it but keep coming back because of how different it is. I will be aging some bottles to see what happens. Good stuff but then again I'm not sure.","MrPlayboy","Feb 07, 2014"

But the last two have been wonderful, this one even better than the one aforementioned in my reviews. This one had a beautiful burnt sienna color the head was not overly lofty and it settled to a nice, yet carbonated tipple. The taste was sweet yet not overly saccharine. It had a nice malty component but not overly so and the hops, what little that I could detect hit with just the right amount of bite. Overall I would say this is one high quality brew and one I would definitely look for again when it arrives next year.","humuloner22","Feb 06, 2014"

The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and sticky definitely coats every inch of your palate for a long time. The nose is very sweet with some nice hop notes and a definite alcohol vibe. This is not subtle, which is one of my favorite things about Lagunitas beers. The flavor is almost reminiscent of a barley wine. It is deep and malty with a hearty dose of west coast hops and a very strong alcohol bite on the finish. Im a huge fan if lagunitas but this beer is not quite my taste. It is very good just not my style.","lochef81","Feb 04, 2014"

Just a little alcohol burn in the throat, but not until after a few sips... very smooth. Medium bodied with some nice sugar stickiness. This ale could be dangerous, but in a very good way!

I would say Lagunitas should dial down the alcohol just a tad and try for a better carbonation level. That would help cut the booziness and give the mouthfeel a boost.

Notes of caramel, brown sugar (imagine that), and floral hops are all present. The taste starts with heavy sugar sweetness which is followed by a swift hop bitterness. The hops don't seem to cut the sweetness too much, rather it adds an earthy and floral component to the sweet malts and makes for some similarities to wildflower honey. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and has a somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a bit sweet for me and the hop character just isn't my favorite pairing.","homebrew311","Dec 28, 2013"

A very strong smell of Carmel and malt hints of pine and herbs. The mouth feel was very creamy and sweet with a nice bitter on the back. The flavors are of carmel pine and dark fruits, the brown sugar is by far the most noticeable of the flavors but very well balanced. Even with an ABV of 9 this is a very easy drinkable brew. Went well with my lamb stew.","dalahodson","Dec 08, 2013"
4.18,3.7,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I can't believe I missed out on this last year, but my year of waiting has paid off well. This is fantastic stuff - it is destined to fail in so many respects, but the malt profile, as well as the herbal backbone, meld so well with the addition of brown sugar that it really reveals that the gents over at Lagunitas seem to pretty much know what they're doing when they approach any beer recipe. I feel this would get too sweet if aged, as the hops provide a much needed bitterness to round things out. Recommended for sure.","magictacosinus","Dec 07, 2013"

One of the best parts of buying a lagunitas beer is not having to break the bank. 10 bucks for a sixer of nearly 10% ABV beer equals one heck of a deal. I'll grab at least one sixer every year.","screamking","Nov 29, 2013"

I don’t think any brewery creates such beautiful smelling beers as Lagunitas. Taste mostly follows the nose, with a slight malty taste at the back of the throat. That aftertaste is about the only thing reminding me that this is a barley wine. As usual, Lagunitas has created a superb brew.","marv3mania","Nov 29, 2013"

There was a lot to like here, even if it felt like an Ale that wanted to be a dessert beer. There wasn't anything else I could have picked up from the store that was quite like this and because the hop profile was so pronounced here, it kept this from feeling like an Imperial Brown Ale or a Barleywine that was brewed in America. Take this for what it's worth - a Strong Ale with lots of taste and body, even if it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. This one's worth savoring to over a good Rolling Stones anthology, as I'm certain that this will endure just as well as the song it's named after. Highly recommended as an alternative to the seasonal offerings currently on the shelf.","JerzDevl2000","Nov 29, 2013"

I feel like they could have definitely gotten away with calling this a DIPA, although I guess they did a little better not attributing it to a style at all. I tend to like hoppy beers better when they're a little bit lower-ABV, and the brown sugar mixed with the booziness can make it seem a little sickly sweet occasionally, so I do have some problems with it. But the hop flavors are really nice, and the brown sugar is a nice addition, and it's definitely unusual and interesting, so I did really enjoy it!","MasterfulIdiot","Nov 14, 2013"

It is a little unbalanced but in a good way like one would expect from a Strong Ale. The malts dominate over a modest hop kick and the brown sugar comes through nicely in both flavor and aroma. Both tasty and robust. I would say one could cellar this but why wait. A great seasonal classic.","Nugganooch","Nov 14, 2013"

Looks pretty stellar. The nose is tangy, barely funky, with pine and candied fruit; while the flavor is sweet up front, with apricot and peach on the tongue, and then bitter in the throat. There's also a spice element to it, and I also get like Pez or Smarties candy in the nose mid-sip. For 9.99% abv, you sure wouldn't know it - I've had 7's and 8's that tasted boozier than this does. Bottle says that it's brewed with brown cane sugar, which, you know, from the name and all I was picturing a molasses-derived brown sugar, but the raw sugar makes more sense. I remember having this at a beer festival a few years ago and being duly corrected after asking for the ""brown."" "It's not a brown, it's an American strong ale."" Indeed.

The aroma is sweet hops, that is a good hop scent with sweet toffee and malt all rolled into one. The first taste was a wow moment. The full on signature Lagunitas hop profile with loads of the sweet malt and toasted sugary goodness to make for a perfect beer. It is definitely unique to say the least and dangerously easy to drink.. Not quite an IPA and not quite a barley wine, but a great brew nonetheless. I love all of Lagunitas’ beers and this may be my favorite.","brurevu","Sep 09, 2013"

I don't have a ton of barleywine experience at this point, but this one seems to match the profile. Maybe even a cross between a barleywine and a DIPA.

Getting the hop bomb of citrus and pine mixed with some sweet malts. Not getting much shugga, but it smell quite good. Taste is just as interesting. Part barleywine, part IPA, part SA. Not sure, but it's sweeter that I thought it would be. The hops are actually a great finish and don't overpower it. A quite complex brew that was tough to sit down. Lots of carbonation, perhaps too much as this was quite dry and a bit metalic. Overall- A pretty good effort and a nice blend of sweet malts and american hops. Weird to explain and put into a category, but a must try and one I will hit out of the bottle to see what may be different. Enjoy-","TheDinger","Feb 24, 2013"

I guess I can see it tasting like a strong ale, too, though. Not that any of this matters – I just like categorizing things. Useless rambling aside, this is a tasty and extremely drinkable beer given the ABV and my initial expectations after the aroma. I would have never guessed this clocked in at a tick below 10%.

Smells not very hop forward, but malt, sweet, bread and grain and some caramel, but some noticeable alcohol and pine like hop notes. Tastes very sweet and malty and not at all bitter at first, the bitterness only emerging after a time (like their sumpin') and this tends to modulate the loudness of the bitterness overall. Nice late hop echo coming in later. Mouthfeel and carbonation is moderate fussy and just about right. Overall, another very good Lagunitas offering, although I don't like as much the loud malt notes in the beginning that really mute the effects of the hops...I want the hops right THEIR!","Bitter_Echo","Dec 26, 2012"

Pours slightly hazy reddish orange color with a very nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pine, caramel, grapefruit, orange rind, apple, brown sugar, bread, toast, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, pine, apple, brown sugar, toast, bread, citrus rind, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, light fruits, brown sugar, bread, toast, floral, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with a great hop bitterness/malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent ""experimental"" Barley wine! Great flavor balance and complexity; and dangerously easy to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Dec 16, 2012"

I really expected something different with this one, but instead got the same old typical, basic, dull Lagunitas flavor. Caramel malts, tree sap, pine and citrus hops, woody nutshells, stale alcohol notes, some off-flavors consistent with oxidation. About medium in body and carbonation. I'd probably never get this again. So many uninteresting beers from this brewery, and this one's no different.","Rifugium","Dec 06, 2012"

Pours a beautiful amber red with an off-white/relatively tan pillowy head, good retention and lacing. Smell reminds me of Lagunitas Sucks from last year -- sweet and hoppy, with a resinous malt character that is reminiscent of other Lagunitas offerings, but more pronounced here. Flavor is similar but super sweet, which is good but some may find it over the top. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth, with little hop bitterness, but very good. Over all this is a very good beer, and makes me realize just how much Lagunitas means to me. Cheers.","rodlavers","Dec 02, 2012"

Toasted malt, brown sugar, grassy and lemony hops, notes of bread, and just a hint of clove on the nose. The mouthfeel is interesting as it gets a little dry in the middle, but finished nice and wet.

I waited a LONG time to try this beer, and I have to say, I was disappointed. It's not a bad beer, but it didn't taste the way I expected it to. The name doesn't describe the taste IMO, but I can't really get mad about that since it wasn't made to taste like brown sugar (this was a woopsy-daisy barleywine to which they added a poop-ton of brown sugar in an effort to salvage the product...they liked it and decided to bottle it as a beer), and the lingering aftertaste is remarkably brown sugary if you wait a minute or two, and you're looking for it. The immediate impression I got upon first swig was a bit of a watered-down Sierra Nevada, taste-wise. It's got more of a bitter taste than I expected. And it WILL mess you up, consider yourself warned. I drank three and I was so toasted that I got sick, and that doesn't normally happen with me. It's not bad, but it's not something I really think that I'll buy again. I'm more of a Lil Sumpin' kinda girl. If you're looking to get schmammered, I think any Lagunitas beer will do the trick for ya lol, but this one will have you on your ayse for sure.","Sakura99","Nov 21, 2012"

The nose comprises brown sugar (no way!), light maple syrup, pine needles, and the essence of grapefruit peel in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with some brown-sugary maple taking control up front, and some bright grapefruit and mild pine needles getting the back half. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice beer, one that marries two distinctive flavor combinations and doesn't try to force them to live dysfunctionally together.","TMoney2591","Nov 19, 2012"

The taste is amazing. Hoppy, spicy, and sweet all at the same time. Goes down smooth and leaves your taste buds begging for more. You can taste the alcohol but, even at 9.9%, it's nowhere near as prominent as a lot of beers near this potency. Great tasting beer that packs one hell of a punch.

Body ramps from medium to full, with prickly carbonation into fluffy into a chewy, hops and booze soaked finish. Although pretty big and sweet, it doesn't come off as heavy, at all.

The taste was malty, without being as hoppy as some of the other Lagunitas seasonals. Since this comes out every other year, I almost forgot how good this beer is. It is smoother than wild, and has more fruit flavors -orange - than any other Lagunitas in my opinion.

Nice fluffy white head, recedes slowly leaving sticky white lacing all over the glass. Not sure what I was expecting here, but this isn't it. It looks and smells like a DIPA. Smell- citrus hops, tea leaves, orange peel (from the hoppy aroma). Taste- hop blast down my throat. Drying citrusy hop oil scorches my throat. Its followed by a tropical fruit backbone. Absolutely zero trace of brown sugar here at all. Is this a DIPA? I'm confused. Was expecting something along the lines of a barleywine, but this is a DIPA, I don't care what they call it. That said, its delicious, wonderful hop profile and great malt backbone.","lnashsig","Nov 04, 2012"

A very nice aroma offering some aromatic citrusy hops alongside a big cookie dough and brown sugar base. I like it. Flavor starts off with some grapefruit from the hops and then transitions into the sweeter side from the malt, offering some dough and brown suger. Some bitterness in the finish. Some alcohol is noticeable in the finish, it doesn't add to the beer but it also is not a deterrent in any way. A thinner but creamy and active mouthfeel, though the activity dies out prior to the finish. I kinda think a thicker mouthfeel would benefited this beer. Overall, been wanting to try this for a while now so glad the opportunity finally arrived. Worth the wait I do think, good stuff.","denver10","Nov 03, 2012"

Overall this is a great beer and I can see why people were upset last year, but it birthed sucks so that's pretty awesome. And let's just call it 10%, because you can't taste the 9.99% that it's listed at anyway, so that .01% won't make a difference IMHO.

Solid earth and resinous hop flavors with barely any harsh edges. A bit of warming alcohol lingers long after each sip.

Beware: This thing has the qualities of a puppy, but it kicks like a mule! At 9.9%, it drinks closer to a 6.5%, and it'll sneak up on you like a ninja in the night if you're not careful. Not the most complex flavor or presentation, but when taking into account the strength and it's subdued quality, it's quite an impressive beer.","TheSixthRing","Oct 09, 2012"

Fruit and umami make for a distinctive combination, reigning over muted hops in this well-aged example. Like most of the beers coming out of Petaluma, this beer's intensity has a tendency to fatigue the palate, but less so due to the focus exhibited by its ingredients.","beagle75","Aug 07, 2012"

Hoppy, citrus and sweet malt aroma. Crisp intense hops up front. Medium barley wine like body and taste with caramel malt and faint citrus. Light brown sugar background. Like a cross between dark IPA and barley wine. Another hit from Lagunitas. Nice.","LiquidAmber","Aug 07, 2012"

We were so into it we had distributors hunting it down and then bought all they could find. Then another season came and something had changed. It wasn't what it had been... One of my good friends, Dr. Burton, was not as fickle as I. He tasted it, said some nice things about it and then shelved it. A few months after my initial taste for that season he presented it to me. It was all I had hoped it to be; malted brown sugar with the right amount of hoppiness supported by a healthy does of alcohol. It put a smile on my face. I am a fan of this beer. If your first bottle isn't making you smile, let it sit. It learns to please as it matures.","AlexanderCsamaj","Oct 31, 2011"
4.27,6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O- Very good, something different from the everyday. Definitely couldn't drink more than one per sitting but with something like this you would want to treat yourself on occasion with this.","korguy123","Aug 30, 2011"
3.35,-16.9,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Deep amber in color with a white head that dissipated quickly. No lacing on the glass. Aroma is brown sugar and and citrus hops. Flavor is brown sugar, caramel malts, and some spices that I can't place. There are some citrus hops in the flavor, but they lurk in the background. Medium to heavy bodied with medium carbonation. It has a very sweet finish that isn't cloying and long lingering. This is a good thing, in my opinion, as I've recently had a few beers that left an unpleasant long lasting sweetness. I was very surprised to see that this is 9.9% ABV. The alcohol is very well hidden, so proceed with caution!","notsoprobeer","Aug 09, 2011"

4.12,2.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, this is good beer, though I did find the sugars became rather strong after a few sips, and due to the high alcohol content (9.99% ABV), a tinge of vodka-like alcohol hung around the edges. Still, I suspect anyone who already likes Lagunitas--a company deliciously geared towards over-indulgence--will find this a nice addition to their line.","jondeelee","Jul 30, 2011"
3.5,-13.2,3,3,4,3,3.5,"For a beer with such a high ABV the drinkability of the beer is outrageous! I can easily see myself getting into a little bit of trouble with this brew.

Smell is sweet caramel, boozy, sugary malts with a strong odor of bittering hops. And yes I would say it does have a brown sugar smell. Even being served a bit too cold it smell is powerful. Taste is all over the place. Somewhat tropical notes lead the way with the sugary sweetness of the caramel and candy sugar blasting it's way in. I have had 2 lagunitas beers before this and the aftertaste was plauged with a watered down sameness. I detect nothing like that here. It is quite flavorful thru and thru. Mouthfeel is extremely oily and thick with a bit of heat on the throat. I am really glad to have picked this up. Much preferred to Olde Gnarleywine.","generalnotsew","Jul 23, 2011"
3.53,-12.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On the sip you get hops up front, but those quickly give way to the sweet malty tones brought on by the brown shugga that’s been added to the brew. Once the sweet notes have passed, hop oil lingers but doesn’t overpower.","jmvecchio1","Jul 16, 2011"

3.97,-1.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a cloudy auburn-brown coloring that is almost opaque, with a slight haze to it. No head on the pour at all. The beer has a bold, round aroma, which is a smooth blend of supersweet sugar and caramel, with a decent balance of hoppiness. Flavors are sharp and heavy, with a good foundation of wet, deep hops riding strong under a boozey highlight and malty sweetness reminiscent of molasses and caramel. There is a sweet theme to this brew. The aftertaste is a slick, rich, almost syrupy sweetness, but refrains from being cloying, with a good hops presence once again. Impressive. The finish is slightly bitter, which keeps it light, and the crispness from the carbonation makes it quick.","GarthDanielson","Jun 26, 2011"

The smell of the beer is semi sweet, not as sweet as I expected it to be from the name. There was a little bit of a roasted smell in there and some hops as well. The taste wasn't overly sweet, I guess I took the name of the beer too literally... The flavors were decent in my opinion. After finishing it off I found myself saying that it wasn't the best beer out there but I suppose it'd be worth another try.","Knapp85","May 19, 2011"

3.81,-5.5,4,3,4,4.5,4,"Overall I though this was a pretty good brew. It is kind of similar to WTF, if you replaced the hops with candied and brown sugar. It isn't the most complex beer but the flavors are pretty nice and everything comes together nicely. Normally I am not a fan of super sweet beers but thankfully the sweetness stayed in the aroma and wasn't that overbearing in the flavor. This beer isn't that drinkable, but if I didn't have shit to do in the morning and had another bottle, I would drink it. I could see this being a good bigger beer for the summer, it could be refreshing and might make a good campfire beer, I may have to verify it this summer. If you like stronger beers with some sweetness to it, this should be up your alley, and if your a fan of Lagunitas then this won't disappoint. This was another solid beer from Lagunitas, everything I have had from them has been good, so far my favorite Cali brewery. 2013 edit, tried the years release and it seemed very off to me, it was full of onion and garlic like hop aromas and flavors, i don't what's up with it.","StoutHunter","May 14, 2011"
3.23,-19.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a dark amber color, with little off white head. Sticky lacing surrounds the pint glass. A fierce race of carbonation bubbles race to the top. Strong smell of piney hops, caramel, and burnt sugar. The smell was very interesting for a Strong Ale, the smell of this one could pass for a DIPA. This one is pretty bitter. The hops are pretty forward, I also taste hints of caramel and molasses. The taste is sweet up front, but has a very bitter backbone. The alcohol is well masked for being 9.99% ABV. Mouthful was pretty heavy and carbonation was moderate. Overall the beer was different in a...different way. Nothing stood on why I loved it or hated it. Pretty average beer, glad I had a chance to try, but wouldn't care if I ever had this one again.","brian44556","May 05, 2011"
4.18,3.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The smell was odd, I had half expected a strong IPA and not a Strong ale, but that was no bother. Lots of hoppy tones, pine and citrus but the biggest players were by far caramel and a burnt sugary almost molasses like aroma.;l, also deppicted some earthy tree bark type aroma. The taste followed suit, earthy caramel tones with a definate hop presence and a sweetness that lay on the palate for a good long while. The feel was a little thin and slick, for the amount of flavor present I would have like to have a bit more thickness to it, but it was nice none the less. Alcohol was definatly not hiding and was a big presence here.","mikesgroove","May 05, 2011"

I was fortunate to get a single and it was an enormous dissapointment. I'm not going to let this beer change my view on Lagunitas, still a top 5 brewery, maybe Brown Shugga just needs some age.","SWMeyer4141","May 03, 2011"
4.25,5.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Lots of head, this one. Lace is much and lots of cling, right down to the last sip. Head is about three fingers, color is a dark brown, a 21 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is rich and sweet, with aromas of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel, peach, and roasted malt. Taste is bold and sweet, with flavors of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, grapefruit, and sweet roasted malt. Mouthfeel is full and chewy, smooth like heavy cream with just enough zing to make it interesting. Don't let the flavor fool you, the almost 10 percent alcohol by volume creeps up on you and away you go. This brown shugga' is calling for me to get some more. A good desert beer for sure.","beerprovedwright","Apr 28, 2011"

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"pours a dark amber with a 1 finger off white head. fairly good amount of lacing. smells of sugar, caramel malts, floral hops and alcohol. at first you get a big taste of sugar, almost too much, but as it flows across your tongue the hops let you know they are there and finally with a 9.99%abv you get the alcohol. not the brown i was looking for, but with everything going on i really like it.","match1112","Apr 14, 2011"
4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the great 6 pack values out there, less than 11 bucks. Poured a copper color with a nice tan head. Aromas of piney hops, alcohol, raisins and brown sugar.

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Into a tulip glass on 3.30.11 this settles a beautiful, very clear cherry wood hued red color under a thin but nicely sustained head. The aroma is much milder than I'd have expected but otherwise an appealing one with notes of toasted sugar, light cherry, and moderate citrus hop. Mouthfeel and taste comes off very similar to a barleywine with a big complex taste. Bright, sweet, but earthy dark fruit, perhaps cherry, dominates the palate with somewhat of a spirit-like warming akin to, again, a barleywine. Finish is dry and sweet. Huge flavor delivered smoothly...Very nice.","albertjr21","Mar 30, 2011"

So my classification would be a junior version of a pretty fresh American barley wine - and not all that junior. Pours amber with a finger and a half of fast dissipating tan head. Smells of bready sugar sweet hops, however you might interpret that. The taste is pretty good - again, think American barleywine, that is fresh and hoppy, but not. In that sense that some American barley wines are so over hopped that they taste excessive when drank fresh. There is also a nice sweetness behind it. Not perfect, but this beer was <$2, so I'm impressed. The mouthfeel is pretty sweet, but not overly thick. It sits on the tongue with that sweet bitterness, but it doesn't coat it.

In the background you could barely taste a hint of bitter, citrusy hops, the beer finishes sweet. This is a very thick brew, it has low carbonation and every sip leaves you wanting more.

I also get slight bread notes and cherry. Taste is in your face with sweet malts and hoppiness. The brown sugar definitely makes itself noticeable, unlike the high ABV, which is untraceable. It finishes with nice dark fruit flavors and sugary sweetness. This beer could easily bee classified as an American Baleywine. Mouthfeel is well balanced and a bit syrupy.

The aroma is heavy hop handed with some sweet caramel and brown sugar (as the title supports). The taste is knock your socks off good. I mean the balance of hops and sweet malt along with a thick consistency and mild warmth of alcohol in the finish. It starts with a slight citrus and pine hops but then the sweetness hits the back of your mouth. The finish is nice and bitter with the slight hint of alcohol on the tongue. This brew is something I am going to seek out again as all I had was the one sample. This one will not disappoint.","WJVII","Dec 28, 2010"

Then cherries in the middle to give it more of a fruity sweetness. Finishes with a citric hops bite along with a little alcohol warmth. Delicioius. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. Leave a sorta sticky oily feeling on the palate. Not bad, but different. The hight ABV and sweetness keep the drinkablity down.

Hops take a back seat to the sweet malt flavor. Moderate carbonation with a chewy body. Finishes with a slight espresso roast, slightly bitter, and sticky.

The large amount of hops help to bring towards balance, but there is so many hops and so much sugar that it is impossible to imagine this would ever be referred to as balanced. It is very difficult to imagine drinking more than one of these at a time given the alcohol and ""bigness", but every time I remember I have some in the basement, I am happy.

Grapefruit and orange citrus flavors ride a wave of sweetness through the middle. Finishes lazily with sweet caramel flavors that taper to pine hop flavors and the faintest hint of alcoholic heat.

Has a barleywine style smell, with dark fruits like raisins, to begin with. This aroma is chased by loads of brown sugar notes. Tasting the beer for the first time you immediately notice the thick mouthfeel, though it's not unpleasant. Brown Shugga is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Alcohol is cleverly hidden, save for a little bit of a burn down in your chest after you drink it. The taste has a lot of different things going on. There are some minor fruit notes, but for me this is a lot like waffles and maple syrup. Mild citrus hops help lend balance to the beer. Oddly enough, even with all of the sugary notes this finishes quite dry, which leaves you wanting more. Despite the heavy body, it's really easy drinking. Call it the perfect fall beer.","eclaycamp","Nov 20, 2010"

Pours a beautiful burnt red/copper with a loose half inch, tan-colored head that reduces its volume by half in less than a minute before eventually settling into a swirl and a band. Clarity is translucent. Nose is a little difficult to decipher - sweet malt, a slight vinegary quality and maybe a trace of soy sauce. Taste follows nose - definitely getting that salty, soy sauce flavor following the malty/brown sugar start. There's also a light hops presence that helps balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a slightly oily quality and an easy, even carbonation. Not sure how I feel about this one. It's not bad, and I would certainly try it again, but it's not what I would consider exemplary.","Jwale73","Nov 19, 2010"

The mouthfeel is very satisfying. Thick, creamy and chewy. This is a big beer with good, complex flavors. With the thick sweet bready body combined with the ABV, it doesn't drink very easy.

There was no real hop aroma or flavor at this point. The beer is pretty much a sweet malt bomb. It actually reminded me of a doppelbock to some extent. There's a big sugary caramel flavor that dominates. The beer has taken on some light sherry notes. The body is beginning to thin out but it seems to be holding up against time better than the gnarleywine, oddly. The caramel malt and brown sugar sweetness aren't quite as overpowering or simplistic as you might expect. The flavor is round and full without being cloying. Very nice.","popery","Mar 11, 2010"

At any rate, the flavor is superb with a big, thick caramelized sugar note taking the lead. There's a sort of sweet, sticky toffee flavor that blends nicely with caramel, brown sugar and like a bright red fruity center. Not overly hoppy but there is definitely something there. The finish is nicely dry with citrus and pine flavors coming into the mix. The hops do a really good job of keeping the sweet malt flavors from cloying and keeps me wanting more. It's full-bodied with a nice warming quality but never feels overwhelming. I absolutely loved this beer. Probably one of the best experiences I've had with a beer in the past year.

Taste is again, hoppy, with some mint leaf, and a really raw earth character. Body is medium to heavy, and leaves a very bitter aftertaste.

Lightly roasted malt kicks things off here followed by a moderate bitter kick from some hops, fading into a lingering piney and somewhat smokey flavor. Very interesting, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected--was thinking this was gonna be like DFH 90 in the sweetness dept. Very interesting flavor, akin in ways to both English and American Barleywines. Thick and coating, the MF on this one is great, very smooth and full-bodied.

Scents of molasses crisp, toffee, caramelized brown sugar, white grape, cherry and pear fruit cushion the nose, however, there's a formidable burst of grapefruit citrus, hay and grass as well, not a sugar bomb but any stretch. In the mouth it's medium-bodied with carbonation which fits the whole, more bitter or astringent feel here without being offputting. The butterscotch, honey, molasses coating mostly during the first few seconds before tangerine, white grapefruit and sourdough bread show up. Some banana alongside the grape, pear, apricot, cherry fruit, not that fruity overall. Gets smokier and more of a roasted chocolate dust edge near the finish.

The flavour reminds me of a nice barleywine - dark fruit and alcohol, but with a sweet, caramelized brown sugar touch. In other ways, it also reminds me of a malt heavy double IPA, as there's a decent citric bitterness rounding things off.

The beer has a sweetness from the sugar and malt that is balanced very well by the ops, with everything hitting at once and a little bit of the brown sugar coming out in backend as well. The high ABV is hidden quite well, I would have guessed it was way less than that. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and slick with a tiny bit of warming from the alcohol.

Clean finish sure, drinkability good especially for the abv. Probably great if you're a straight hop head. The base of the beer tastes like EVERY SINGLE other beer I've had from Lagunitas. Malt and roast are just too words they don't like to incorporate. It's like they just keep taking their IPA and adding different small items and calling it a different named Strong Ale. Everybody is always so high on this brewer and I guess I just don't get it. West Coast bitter beer, the thought being this is crisp and clean and organic in some instances. Rambled enough.

Smooth and creamy with a great hop bite and malt sweetness. There are plenty of malts in this. I swear I can taste toasted malt, chocolate, toffee, caramel, peppermint, butterscotch, and maybe hints of roasted and/or coffee malts (anything with sugar, and yes, brown sugar). Not thin, not overly thick though, wouldn't necessarily say bready but a little viscous. A good beer that I recommend and look forward to having again.","clayrock81","Jan 02, 2009"

This is an intensely sweet beer, which is no supprise considering its called brown sugga and says something about sweet release on the label. The large hop presence was unexpected and really this beers saving grace for me.

Very sweet, but not drain-pouring, outrageously so. There's a nice balance between the dark sugary sweetness and bitter, citric hops. Sugar coated orange slices, hints of caramel and maple syrup. Alcohol is completely well hidden in the flavor, but it can be felt in the throat on the way down. Thick and creamy to say the least, the epitome of full-bodied.

Aromas are quite hoppy, plenty of grapefruit, orange, along with a slight spicy phenolic character with some spicy twang. Very little in the way of malt aroma, just a sweet note, but a good bit of alcohol. On the palate, it just sits on your tongue, one of the heaviest feeling beers I've had in a while. Sitting only at 51 IBUs, it isn't overly bitter, quite balanced actually; but, there's just a ton of hop flavor. Still, the malt character is lacking, just a touch of bready toastiness, crystal sweetness, finishing dry with lots of lingering hops. Overall, it's an interesting ASA (DIPA), though I think the undercarbonation and mouthfeel bring down the drinkability a bit.","dreadnatty08","Mar 16, 2008"

It has a strong sweet malt base with a very nice hoppy bitter with very little hint of the amount of alcohol that is in this beer. It then follows up with an overly sweet aftertaste of brown sugar.

It has an incredibly smooth malty taste that weighs heavy on burnt toffee flavors. It goes down easy and finishes silky smooth with a nice hop blast that lingers. The mouthfeel is fine.

The one thing I noticed with this beer is the high ABV. The beer has such a nice taste to it, and they go down fairly easily. But if you want a few, be careful.

Hop flavors on the finish leave a slight bitterness in the mouth. A good brew, but nothing particularly special. Mouthfeel is good, chewy but not terribly thick.

Tons of dark dried fruits in the flavor, some pineapple, some sweet brown sugar, and plenty of body warming alcohol stacked on a sweet malty base. Finishes smooth and just a bit boozy.

The 10% alcohol level was certainly a compensating factor; but actually it was a revelation in the glass. It poured a clear coppery teak colour with very little carbonation; the nose was redolent of molasses, but in the mouth you have an interesting tension between the bitterness of hop and the residual sugar. The key is, it wasn't sweet at all, but beguilingly smooth and syrupy with some caramel butterscotch notes. In an inexperienced hand it could be extremely dangerous: hugely drinkable.

The body is a deep red with lots of dark sort of purply tones. Smells of malty sweetness, this doesn't really emanate a very thick malt rather a sweet malt with nice toast notes, the hops are not too over powering but provide a nice balance. Flavor is slightly thin and sort of a sharp sweet bitterness, which I'm sort of indifferent to. The mouthful is sort of flat and through that the sweet, sort of cough spryness gets a little not so tasty, but I have to give it props for a yummy hop burps.

On the palate, bitterness and brisk carbonation start things off, followed by thick, sugary sweetness and a touch of bitterness at the back of the tongue. Some chocolatey sweetness at the very end. Not very complex, however -- it's mostly just varying levels and characteristics of sweetness. Mouthfeel is marked by slick malts, alcholic heat, and prickly carbonation, with the alcoholic detracting signficiantly. Overall, this beer is nothing to shout about.

Sweet brown sugar, pine sap, and prickly alcohol aromas. Piney hop resin washes across the tongue dropping sweet brown sugar bombs before fading into the back behind warm alcohol. The hops come to fill out all aspects of the flavor and when coupled with the alcohol, it attains an almost pine-sol like solvency. Not particularly smooth, the pine adds a rough-cut texture to the medium-full body. The fine carbonation eases the drinkability somewhat. The finish comes to be filled out with an almost medicinal alcohol flavor laced with pine that leaves me wondering where the brown sugar sweetness went.

Granted, you might want to be in the mood for the syrupy sucrose sensation it creates, but combined with the hefty but never obnoxious ABV, it makes for a nice warmer in the colder times.

4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"650 ml bottle, with an always entertaining if somewhat maniacal ""story"" behind Brown Shugga on the label's side. On the front it says this is a ""messed up"" Gnarlywine. Tasted at room temperature. Popping the green cap gives a whiff of strong and very sweet maltiness. This beer poured nicely, with low carbonation, producing a creamy light brown head which was moccha like in that it seemed to have streaks of lighter whites swirling. Rings of lacing which stuck instantly and seemed very viscous. The beer is a light, dusty ruby red. Dark nectarine, or light strawberry in certain light. An attractive beer without question. The aroma is very similar to a good barleywine. The phenols are always there, and the aroma tickles the nose with its strength. Heavy malts, but a definite kick of strong hopping is also present, adding an earthiness and a dryness I have not smelt in too many barleywines, or, like Brown Shugga, barleywine hybrids. Thick burnt caramel, red wine, the inevitable licorice and and creamy root beer. The northwest hops always add a nice balance to the heavy malting. The aroma is quite sweet, yes, but not as much as I thought it might be with the addition of brown sugar. The sugar can definitely be smelt, however. Smelling very closely, a very refreshing note of citrus, mixed with red grapes. Other aromas include rice pudding, mollasses, and fresh cinnamon buns. The taste is delectably full and satisfying in its maltiness, but the hops play their part perfectly here too. The syrupy malts come first, sugary and bursting with brown sugar and licorice flavours. In the middle the citrus hops come again and combined with the malts give a chocolate-orange combination which is incredible. I paired this beer with St Paulin cheese from France, and the light nutiness of the cheese made the chocolate and especially the orange come through in the beer magnificently. I would recommend the pairing. The alcohol is masked quite well up until the finish, when the bitterness, almost vodka-like in its bite, creeps up on you. The taste too is barleywine with perhaps an added sweetness. Burnt toast and cinnamon, maple syrup and a load of mollasses. The mouthfeel is definitely full, with extremely low carbonation, making it quite syrupy. Despite its near-10% abv, this is very drinkable, but with caution. It warms the stomach rather rapidly. A beer I wish was more widely available in Alberta(for now, only one store in Calgary has the exclusive rights to sell it). It also paired well with 3-year aged cheddar. A definite re-drinker, and cellaring a few for a year or two sounds mighty prudent.","Cwrw","Oct 10, 2005"

Texture is extremely chewy with mild hints of carbonation on the back on the tongue. Alcohol becomes more present as it warms, but slightly cold is hardly noticeable in the flavor. Starts off peppermint sweet, with some hop bitterness, but not enough to balance the sweetness from the sugar. Still, for some reason this is exactly what hits the spot right now, and I think it's delicious. Drinkability is good despite the booze because it's just so damn tasty.

It warms my throat slightly as it goes down. It has a sweet caramel taste. Not too much for hop flavor though. I can also taste some brown sugar, hence the name Brown Shugga'. This beer is full bodied. It goes down smooth leaving a malty sweet aftertaste. I dont think this beer would make the greatest session beer.

Some alcohol it noticeable and it also smells of a slight cinnamon. A touch of earthy hops round it out. An odd but pleasant smelling brew. The flavor is similar to the nose with a big sweet component from the sugars and the malts. Light fruitiness is there and a bit of alcohol and some bitter bops. Quite an interesting mix and the brown sugar is obvious. Ends on a slight alcohol bite with a touch of fruit sweetness. About a full bodies brew with a sticky feel.

4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"From a 22 oz. brown ""Sweet Release"" bottle, I actually like the little blurb on the side of the bottle this time. This pseudo barleywhine pours out a very appetizing ruddy copper hue, hazed with suspended particles when held up to the light. Thick and creamy off-white head with good retention, and some massive sticky lacing. The nose is sweet with light malt and fruit, with some nut and dried fruit notes in it. And mango. Weird, I smell mango. Nice touch! This is also one very tasty mistake Lagunitas has on their hands. Boozy from the start, but mild, the malt blends very nicely with the hops, dancing cheek to cheek the whole way through. Sweet caramel malt coils itself around a refreshing fruity hop character, and they are both hepped up on a good dose of brown sugar, which helps them tango the whole night long. The sugar makes itself more apparent on the finish where it takes on a nutty flavour, and then recedes into a mild citrusy sunset of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and very drinkable, but not watery, it holds its own over the palate. This Brown Shugga is deceptively drinkable, you have to know where you're going to stop before even going in, or suffer a high abv% brown sugar hangover catastrophe the next day. Not that I know anything about that, some guys told me about it once, no fooling. This Brown Shugga should definitely be chalked up to being what we call in the hot shop one of those ""happy accidents", that should henceforth be repeated time and again.

More of the figs and hard candy character along with the doughy hints I detected on the nose. Mild hop bite, and just a hint of alcohol warming. Denser mouth feel than I anticipated. Nicely drinkable. Unusual, yet pleasing version of the barley wine style.","carln26","Feb 09, 2005"

Couldnt pick out a distinct brown sugar flavor but could tell from the overall sweetness (not sweet like DFH 120) that a decent amount of sugar was used. Mouthfeel is watery and light.

4.46,10.7,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a nice ruby / amber color with a fairly large white head that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Aromas consist of caramels and toffees with a mix of brown sugar and some piney resinous hops. Initial flavors start off quite sweet with a strong backing of caramels which is followed by a nice hint of vanilla. There is also a nice flavor throughout of brown sugary sweetness that almost has a toffee like aspect to it. The finish is totally west coast with a strong mix of citrus and piney hops that adds just enough bitterness to round things off. The body to this beer is completely fantastic with a great chewy / creamy like feel to it. Overall this brew wasn't the most amazingly complex or in your face beer but it was definetly a fantastic barleywine that just hits the spot...","bigbeerdrinka","Dec 30, 2004"

The aroma was of caramel malts, but nothing much more. I expected maybe some brown shugga... The flavor is somewhat caramel-like. Alcohol is apparent and there is a lot of sugar in the taste. Too much sugar. Slightly thin. Not a bad beer, but too sweet and thin.","clvand0","Dec 29, 2004"

Nose is made up of sweet, buttery caramal rolls, brown sugar (crazy, eh?), alcohol, and subdued vegetal/floral hops. Cake-icing sweet malt flavors start out. Sugary sweetness mixes with apple/pear brandy notes and toffee. Hops finally arrive near the finish to counter some of the sweetness. Medicinal/herbal hop bitterness isn't enough to handle the treacle sweetness. Add in the obvious alcohol presence and it's a little too cough syrupy for me. Mouthfeel is big and syrupy. Not bad, but not my kind of BW.","alexgash","Dec 14, 2004"

There is a sweet caramel and molasses smell typical of a barley wine. The flavor is very potent with a sharp sweetness in the middle and lots of tangy, toffee, and carmel flavors throughout the beer.

It poured a color only of what I could describe as liquified brown sugar. A foamy head formed, and as I drank a sticky lace was on the glass. The aroma was of brown sugar. The flavor was of brown sugar. By the way, I like brown sugar. I used to sneak it out of the bowl as a kid when my Mom would bake. There were other tones in this beer: the malt was a nice backdrop flavor to the brown sugar. The only negative was that it was so rich and the alcohol was pretty strong I am not sure I could drink too many of these. My palate would be worn down.","MuddyFeet","Aug 07, 2004"

Very robust malt blend with a brown sugar taste that gives way to a good hop and malt balance. This is a great desert beer.

Starts off with sweet brown sugar, almost too sweet, but is quickly balanced by bitter notes of pine oils and raw hop flavors. The fact that the abv is 9.9% is quite a surprise as I couldnt detect any notes of alcohol. However, it does explain the increased difficulty Im having typing this review!

4.03,0,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Jakey likes! Pours a crystal clear medium brown with amber highlights. The head is oddly yellow (not sunshine yellow, but a dull creamish yellow) and looks almost greasy or buttery. The head forms nicely and sticks around long enough that I can't complain. Even when it's mostly gone, what's left manages to sheet the sides of the glass. The first thing that came to mind after the first sniff was leaves. It's that smell when you're out in the woods and you pull leaves from a branch and crush them. The hoppy leaf smell dominates the soft warm malts underneath. The flavor is what stole my heart, though. You've got buttery biscuits topped with caramel and toffee flakes topped with a dollop of cream sprinkled with brown sugar and a light drizzling of maple syrup. Actually, that makes this thing sound sickeningly sweet, but it's not. It's just sweet enough that you'd call it sweet but no more. The slightly herbal hops are easily picked out but don't overpower or even dominate. An exquisitely balanced brew and one that I wouldn't guess was over 6% just by the taste.","aracauna","Feb 27, 2003"

3.6,-10.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Slightly hazy ruby hue, topped by an off white, thick, creamy well retained head. Mellow, mint laced citrusy hop nose with a dominant note of underripe tangerine. Medium caramel malt aroma with hints of biscuit and butter. Mellow impression of berryish fruitiness rounds the aroma out. Baked biscuit mild sweetness is perceived at first, then is ensued by a pronounced, almost syrupy well caramelized sugar note, which persists throughout. Hop bitterness provides meager contrast, leaving the overall flavor profile quite sweet. Hop flavor manages to eek in, lending a brown sugar smothered grapefruit impression mid palate. A bit lightly bodied, and a touch over attenuated, yet residual sweetness remains assertive. Finishes with a lingering suggestion of warming butterscotch schnapps. Brown Shugga is quite an odd brew. The sweetness is only a hair shy of cloying, and seemingly overshadowed malt nuances. That being said, the sheer uniqueness and dearth of alcohol character (until the finish) warrant a try. With a greater hop presence this could be a fine barleywine. It's quite tasty, nonetheless. This would make a delicious, supremely calorically dense vanilla ice cream float.

The aroma is quite appealing as the brown sugar sweetness blends almost imperceptibly with a blend of citric and lightly floral hops. Mild fusel alcohol aromas develop as the beer warms. The flavor begins malty with some light, fruity notes, followed by an almost granular sugary flavor and some mild alcohol warming. The finish is dominating by a biting hop presence, but one which stings only for a second and merges gracefully in to a very well-balanced sugary sweet and somewhat spicy aftertaste. Medium-full body and rather like a mild barley wine in character. A very well-crafted (even if accidentally!) and drinkable beer.","mzwolinski","Jan 20, 2003"
