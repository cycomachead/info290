"Strong orange blossom honey flavor, medium to full bodied but finishes crisp.  One of my new favorite Dogfish ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Subtle flavor of honey graham cracker. Pretty darn good, and sneaky strong - you do not notice that this is 9% ABV."
""

"Dogfish head brewed American Beauty with almond honey granola and all American hops and it sounds outrageous. It has a fruity, granola, almond honey nose. Pours orange tinted amber under a 2” quickly dissipating lightly tan tinted white foam cap with clingy lace. On the palate it enters nutty and slightly sweet with honey and light sugars balanced by a moderate hop bitterness on the finish. The finish has an underlying layer of honey and leaves a little honey stickiness on the lips. The beer is very creamy with above average carbonation stuffed into a medium full bodied beer. The granola is definitely there throughout but it is never too much to be cloying and is nicely balanced by the other flavors in the beer. It pairs well the the background pale ale graham cracker flavors and is well balanced by both the hop flavors and bitterness. The alcohol is unnoticeable."

"I just have good things to say about this beer. it is very drinkable. Another reviewer described it as mild, which is accurate to be sure, but I think in a good way. it is just so well balanced. Top that off with my favorite musicians' furry friend and I can't help but smile, smile, smile..."
""
"I was expecting more from the DFH name and price. I would plausible buy this again in a 4 pack for 11$. But not a 16$ bomber."
""
"Overall: I was surprised at how mild this beer was, it was good, but very mild in my opinion."
""
""
"Strange.  Usually with off kilter strong ales, especially old ales and barleywines, I wind up liking the beer more and more as I progress through the pint.  This was the exact opposite.  It never became bad, but I took my sweet time finishing it and probably won't order it again."
"Good but a little sweet for my taste"
""
""
"I'd call the ""imperial pale ale"" description accurate, calling it a strong ale or barleywine works too. It's just a big beer with a lot of everything. The hops aren't on par with Arrogant Bastard, they're a softer citrus punch. The malts are toasty with a granola-like sweetness (or maybe I'm imagining that because it's on the label). Very smooth and balanced for the strength, it feels at home in a red wine glass. It's a good trip."
""
""
"DFH American Beauty is a sweet, nutty Imperial ipa that is both sweet & bitter.  Perfect head, delicious smell of sweet hops.  The sweetness & bitterness of the perfect caliber.   Awesome reason & art of the bomber bottle label.  Great for an at home cupples nightcap.  Enjoyable to those just getting into IPA's of strong ales.  I prefer more of the bitter IPA's or douple/imperials.  Give this Dogfish Head brew a try whenever the opportunity.  Enjoy!"

"I'm not sure whether I would pick up this brew again. I don't want to say it wasn't good( because it really was quite good), but any store that stocks this is bound to have something better for the same price tag."
"Purchase Value (B) – “Bombers” are typically more expensive than six-packs, as was the case here – $11.99 for a 750 mL bottle is about average for a 90+ rated beer, but it felt like I was paying for the artwork and tribute nature of the beer, rather than the taste."
""
""
"Another exceptional, impressionable craft beer from DFH."
"I'll try it again in the summer at Soldier Field."
""
"Well the bottle art is obviously fantastic, but the beer is pretty damn good too. I could easily drink this while walking down Shakedown Street at Alpine Valley looking for a ganja goo ball, and a grilled cheese. You can pick up some of the honey in the flavor, which mingles nicely with the earthy hops. The alcohol is well hidden. The body of this brew is medium and really smooth. Easy drinking, even at 9% ABV. Glad to recommend this brew. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The label states that this is ""An Imperial Pale Ale brewed with almond honey granola & all-American hops."" That sums this up much better than be listed as an American Strong Ale. I love the label, great to see the dancing bear with a mug. A fine tribute and overall a very tasty and enjoyable beer that hides the ABV and is quite easy to drink, much better than I expected. Jerry would be proud."
""
"Just had my first it won't be my last"
"Didn't think i was gonna like this one, but it really surprised me. I will always grab a bottle of this stuff."
""
""
"Although not quite what I expected (I anticipated a bolder malt and grain character), the beer grows on you with its varied and, generally, complex flavors. The boozy component detracts from the overall appeal. It's somewhat hot and astringent. Still, one may find this another intriguing and appealing quirky DFH offering that's worth the experience."
""
""
""
""
"Very good imperial pale ale... smooth and refreshing, had from tap.  Would recommend trying, alcohol of 9% hidden really well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not a fan. Thought it tasted terriblen especially the aftertaste... Which was papery? Not really sure. Thin, and just smelled kind of funky. Somewhat bitter, kind of foamy so the pour might not have been great, but good color. Trying again when I can."
""
""
"This is what it says it is. It tastes like an amped up pale ale, and I would have to say that they nailed. Yet I would much rather it be an Imperial IPA. But it's good. And my fellow deadheads asked for there to be granola in it, so I guess they had to work with that!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich golden color with a thin fizzy head that trails the glass. The smell has a bit of toasted malt from the granola as well as a decent amount of citrus from the hops. The taste was very bright with hops being the focal point with the granola coming through in bits and pieces. Very well balanced and hides the heavy alcohol content well. Would definitely try again."
""
""
""
"O: Good. Nothing phenomenal, however. A bit sweeter than I like my DIPAs to be. Too heavy overall to be drinking till the morning comes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not real impressive. An interesting idea, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear, amber color.  Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Grapefruit hop nose and flavor follows - grapefruit hops, hints of honey in background. Light lingering bitterness. $14.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
""
"Worth sharing with a friend, you won't have a bad time with this beer but you aren't going to be transported back to a Dead show either."
""
""
"Crisp, almond-nutty, dry finish... different and enjoyable."
""
"Caramel malt dominant, with notes of resin. Slightly nutty and oaty. Flavor is malty, as well, with a bitter, resiny finish that's a little more than I prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hoppy, nice balanced bitterness... interesting notes with the body (grains, granola, etc.), but didn't quite fall into place for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too sweet. Just not good."
""
""
"O: On the whole, this is an enjoyable beer. Not really classifiable in terms of style, but worthwhile."
"3.43/5.00"
""
""
"a real nice IPA a little on the sweet malty side I think from the honey granola with a little nutty finish really really good IPA from Dogfish Head"

"O: Its a nice thought, throw some granola in there to appease us hippies.  Unfortunately I didn’t get any of the “almond honey granola” notes in either the taste or aroma.  Oh well.  Still a solid brew, but definitely not worth the price tag.  Dat bottle label though… 3.75"
""
""
""
""
""

"Earthy pine hops, lots of sweet malt with an overbearing honey flavor and sweetness. Nice to try but I wouldn't seek it out again."

"D - A really enjoyable American Strong Ale... It's like every beer you've ever drank, but it's also completely unique... I don't have a single complaint... Also, while I have no superlatives the unique dimensions make this one completely memorable... I would drink this on a regular basis if I were able to... A job very well done by DFH..."

"This beer is excellent, it is strong, but not too strong. It has a very pleasant aroma and despite its high alcohol content, it finishes very smooth. The granola, which was the ingredient voted in by deadheads, really adds a nice note to the end."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it drinks well. I don't really know how to categorize this beer and BA's definition fits it well. It's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A delicious creation that captures the spirit of those crunchy granola tripsters who worship The Dead. Give the finish some time to settle on the tongue and you'll swear you just ate a Clif Bar. Judged solely as a beer, I can see how some would want a stronger hops profile in order to better clean the sugars, but doing so would turn this into an IIPA, and would drown the taste the recipe has successfully achieved. Because of that, I recommend tasting this alone rather than attempting to pair it with food."

"Bottle as an extra from trade. 10/1/2013 bottle date so this has been sitting around a bit but I don't care. Pours deep orange colored with a big creamy 2-inch off white head. Lots of lemon peel in the aroma, grass and hat, orange, and some sweet malts. Flavor is super sweet orange-lemon pinesol. Flavor is a bit watered down with some sweet orange blossom honey and orange marmalade flavor in the background. Just under medium mouthfeel, low to medium carbonation, slightly slick on the tongue. This one is a bit funky for me, and don't really get any granola flavor so not sure what that added here. Not a big fan overall, really had a soapy floor cleaner characteristic to it."
"O) A good brew. I'd definitely would drink more of this, if I had more on hand."

"I like the band, I will have to admit, I have seen them a few times over the years and the offshoots as well. That is what got my attention in regard to this one. But I will have to say that it is very good I have been enjoying IPA's lately and I have to say that of the Dogfish Head beers I have tried over the years I do think they make a damn good IPA style wise over some of the other offerings. Although this could also be me. Anyway, I thought the color was good and nothing surprising about that, typical of the style. It did have some head that settled into a nice lacing after a few minutes. The smell was fruity, with that hoppy pine smell I love. But there was a sweetness to it as well. That is where the granola enters I would assume. It does have that cereal grain impact to it that kind of mellows out the hoppy bitterness in the taste. The taste was not unlike the smell, I detected grapefruit, graininess, with some evergreeen presence. It had a sweetness to it that cuts through the hops and makes for a really balanced IPA. I would recommend this one and if I could find another one around I probably would pick it up again. I hope this is something Dogfish Head does more than once. My one complaint is that it was pricey to begin with and that seems to be an unfortunate trend overall in regard to good beers. I guess we will just have to get used to it."

"Okay, I'm officially tired of these endlessly silly flavored beer-like brewing experiments from DFH. I don't see them going in interesting new directions. It just seems like silliness, but for the fun-loving this is a flavored malt liquor with a story. And hey, it's the perfect pour for your morning bowl of Cap'n Crunch. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Bottleworks in Seattle."
""

"Poured into a goblet. A nice medium golden amber color with a 1 finger white head. Plenty of carbonation rose from the bottom to keep a nice thin layer on top. Aroma was slightly sweet malty, a bit of hoppy bitter, a tad of grainy bread as well. Flavor was a sweet up front, but had a hit of tangy hops as well. A bit of floral as well. Felt good in the mouth, coated nicely with bit of tingle. Overall, not a bad beer. Nothing really stood out from the granola profile, but it didn't hurt it either."

"Overall interesting but not great, hops are interesting as well as the creamy oat feel, not sure if I like how the ester and phenol profile come through with the booze, not sure what yeast they used but I'm not a huge fan of it, at least in this style although it would probably be good in a big Belgian tripel or something."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is herbal resinous hops up front backed by a round malty mouth - biscuit in the back. It has a nice dry finish - oak and char notes. A very nice IPA, not many citrus notes but a nice earthy resinous flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Simply a decent IPA."
"O- Though it wins points for being unique (but what Dogfish beer doesn't?), it's not as good as I'd hoped."
""

"this one has been on the self for a few weeks now- im just now getting around to trying it. (i have to say- the acid bear turned me off). i finally broke down and pulled the trigger. this one pours a clear golden with a thick head. the smell is hoppy with a good mix of the oats from the granola. the taste is hoppy but not really strong. its mild and sweet. over all this is a pretty nice beer."
"M - medium bodied well carbonated and rather drinkable"

"Overall: A slightly hoppy grainy and earthy average beer. Does not rank too high on the scale of DFH beers I have tried. Nice to have tried, but I think I will pass in the future."

""
""
"On tap at dfh rehoboth. I have to say this is probably my least favorite dfh...its sweet likebfruit juice but a bit of alcohol burn. Somewhat thin and lifeless...I really wanted to like this one but just didnt work for me. Best label ever though...one if my fav bands but not so much on the brew"
""
"O: Was expecting more somehow. Disappointed with the link to GD, but O.K. drinking wise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I wonder how much better it might be at 7% abv. It fits the profile of a 9.0 sugar bomb....for me anyway. Good, yes. American Beauty, not even close."
"O- This is a good beer. It's nothing extravagant or outrageous. It's just a simple idea and very well executed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A real mellow DIPA even though it's not classified as one at the time of those review. I would definitely grab it just to have it but it's definitely no 90 minute so buyer beware. Salud!"

"O: Not a bad brew fro dogfish, I was expecting a lot more but this was flavorful and different from other IPA'S."
"o - overall, initially i had high expectations for these music series beers...especially after that amazing bitches brew...but then i was brought back down to earth with the next few and have come to expect very little from these beers other than a hunt to obtain them. the good news, this one is actually pretty good. abv is well hidden and the flavors are pleasant. it works. far from a world class beer, but good enough that i don't mind tackling the full bottle on my own."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/1/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, orange peel, grapefruit, floral, grass, toast, bread, light pine, honey, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright hop notes with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, floral, grass, light pine, bread, honey, toast, light nuttiness, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, pine, bread, honey, toast, light nuttiness, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop and malt flavors; with good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial pale ale style. All around nice complexity of citrus/tropical hops with a moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"A little expensive at $12.50 a bottle in my area but at 9% ABV you don't need more than a bomber. It was a nice purchase to enjoy for Thanksgiving. I will buy regularly. 90 minute is still my favorite DFH beer but this is good and can be gifted to all your Deadhead friends that appreciate good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: American Beauty was, to me, the Dead's best studio work and while I didn't go hunting around for the album to play along with my tasting session, the memories certainly bias my review; maybe I wouldn't have rated it this high without the connection but this beer was certainly worthy of a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a fairly plain beer, with simple scent and taste and body. The alcohol was hidden ok, and the finish was pretty smooth, so it was easy enough to drink. Nothing special at all, and even though it wasn't bad, it really wasn't worth the price."
""
""

""

"D: a little underwhelming. under two months old and this already lost a lot of zing. not getting any flaws due to age, just missing a step. I am a fan of the collaboration brews, but making a high quality beer should always take precedence and this misses the mark for me."
""
""
""
"An interesting beer- it really does smell and taste like granola. Notes of cinnamon, almonds, some sweetness, and a grainy underpinning that's just like the granola graininess. Overlaying the granola is a firm, spicy hoppiness and a touch of sourness from the grain. Quite pleasant to drink overall, but perhaps a bit too thick in body from the granola. Still, a fun take on the band and a beer."
"O: Never thought I'd have a beer made with granola, but damn, I love it!"
""
""
"O - This is not bold in any way. It is good and pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Once again, Dogfish Head goes bold and doesn't disappoint. Really tasty brew. Shame it's a one-off run."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good and well-balanced ale, tastes fresh and flavorful. Definitely hoppy but has some notable malt in there to even it out. Decadent body. A bit boozy but all things considered, pretty tasty and worth trying."
""
"O- Alcohol is well hidden and I feel this is truly an Imperial Pale Ale like the bottle says. Very enjoyable, I will pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great Pale Ale. It hides the alcohol really well, and is crushable as hell. No way I'd guess this was 9% blind. DFH has been throwing me for a loop lately with all the stuff they've been coming out with; I almost feel like I can't keep up. Though this isn't worth nearly $20 a bomber, that doesn't mean the beer isn't good."
""

""

"Pours a really big head but it’s mostly air, the larger bubbles pop and sizzle down rapidly although it is fun to watch, eggshell white to light tan, not a lot of stick to the lacing, tends to slide down the glass sides. Light gauziness to the coppery orange color, closer to a reddish brown than yellow, the bubbles are few but they are fat and move with some speed. The nose is diffuse and easygoing, a gregariously sloppy array of sweet grains, orange pulp, honey, hay, white pepper, good amount of apricot to peach fruit, finishes more soft and estery than hoppy, slight vinous quality. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and consistent filling cheek to cheek, not soft per se yet not biting nor unduly bitter. The honey to yogurt aspects lead alongside orange and grapefruit citrus, again the apricot, peach to yellow apple fruit plays a sizable role. Malty and the granola is evident with each sip, sweet grains give it an even consistency start to finish. More floral through the finish, some pine sap too, the sweeter side of hops. The carbonation is on the creamy side and helps it ooze over the tongue. There’s nothing you can say it nails 100% and, as before, it’s not a beer of pinpoint precision. But it is extremely satisfying and something to just kick back and enjoy."

"O: This is amazing. Very very happy. Highly recommended. Kinda sweet for an IPA, but still."
""
"This beer is simply too sweet for me. I agree with the concept of ""Imperial Pale Ale," here: higher ABV, some bright hops, but a massive, massive dose of malty sweetness. It tastes good, but it's just a sugar overload for my palate, at least compared to what I was expecting in this kind of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy and moderately bitter, with a high ABV that is partially hidden. The contributions of the granola are also mostly hidden, although there are hints of honey."

"O - This is a fairly delicious brew. Second beer by Dogfish that I have tried with the beer/music collaboration theme. Both were successful."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Superb. 9% abv, watch out, very easy to let it get away...drinkable, indeed."
""
""
"First, this is NOT AN IPA. It is an Imperial Pale. Good looking beer, bright and clear copper. Lots of wheat and grain, and some good fruit smells, banana, some mild hops, mango. Smell was very mild but good. Good be a little more potent for the people who like to smell their beers a lot like me. Very smooth, and easy to drink, but less carbonation than i was expecting. Very good beer!"
""
""
""
"To the moroons out there... You know who you are! THIS IS NOT AN IPA! You beer nerds ruin the the whole beer drinking experience! Put your skinny jeans on, go back to class and finish your studies at the hipster universities you attend. My brother in law is a brewmaster for a local brewery and I have experience drinking many good and not so good beers. Please cut the bullshit, Read what you write (out loud so you hear how ridiculous you sound), and stop making a simple process so complex. This is an awesome ""PALE ALE"" (NOT INDIA PALE ALE)! If you can't read the bottle label of the beer you're ""RATING""... Please don't be one of the assholes that rate the beers! Well done Dogfish Head (as usual)!"
"Not quite what I had in mind for the description. But it's still good, just not memorable. I could use more blending and complexity with more rounded flavors and feel. A good offering by DFH, however, not sure I can recommend @ $14+"

"another nice brew from DFH, not a world beater but for such an ABV this is exceptionally balanced, I don't love it but it is hard to not just love sipping on it as it is an easy goer. definitely worth checking out as it does not clobber your brains with hops but yet has definite punch."
""
""
""
"O: For an Imperial IPA per the bottle this is lacking in hops to balance all the malt. Overall it's nice, the malt profile is just a bit much making it a bit unbalanced, otherwise a nice beer"

"It is a shame this is a limited edition but, day-em...I'm glad I got to experience it."
""
""
""
"Overall – Well.. It was OK, but really not worth the $12.00 price for a bottle. The look is fantastic and the taste starts out quite nice, but toward the end of the taste, due to a rather non-complementary set of flavors, leaves a somewhat disjunct flavor it linger on the tongue. I am glad I tried it, but would never buy it again."
""

""
"Overall a very solid beer for any season. This is the first offering I have sampled from Dogfish Head. I hope to sample more shortly."
""

"Simple (by DFH standards) but a great beer. I hate The Grateful Dead but I love this beer. It's the antithesis of Pearl Jam Currant beer for me. Worth the price tag for me."

"Poured from a 750mL into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, dark, honey-brown coloring with a tall, frothy, dense, clingy, off-white head that has some staying power. There is a thick, almost solid lacing left behind as you drink. Aromas of spicy and green hops, with pepper notes, honey sweetness, passion fruit and grapefruit, and resinous notes. Flavors are tangy forward, with a solid bitter undertone. Roasted toffee and nut, as well as some toasted oat character, with a light and tart citrus highlight, some resinous cedar notes, and hints of toffee and dark fruit. Smooth in mouth, with a subtle effervescence from the slow flow of carbonation. The aftertaste is a solid, balanced blend of bitter, sweet, and toasted grains. Slightly bitter and dry finish, with subtle lingering notes. Very solid, drinkable beer, and overall, a fitting tribute to a musical and cultural icon."

"O - Initially the alcohol effervescence takes a front seat and masks just about everything, 1/4 in after your palate adjusts to the punch of booziness different flavors start to emerge. Surprisingly, for the boozy effervescence the alcohol warming is kept to a minimum."
"A good IPA, with all due respect, but the aim is almost wasted."

"Surprising alcohol presence. Brief pale malt flavor with a touch of sweetness. Straight forward bitterness without any of the complexities of most American IPAs these days. Creamy aftertaste of black pepper bitterness. Thin body for the style with a slightly elevated level of carbonation."

"750 ml bottle, bottled on 9/25/2013. Served in a Dogfish Head IPA glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head that stays around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like citrusy hops, honey, grainy malt, oats, and some light berries. I think the taste is mostly like the aroma, it tastes like citrusy and light floral hops, grainy malt, oats, honey, and a bit of berries/fruitiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good Imperial Pale Ale, and it's certainly worth trying. $11.99 a bottle."
"Nothing earthshattering here, but this is a pleasasnt enough beer. If the price tag wasn't so ridiculously high, I might even order it again some time. However, if wishes were horses beggars would ride; bottom line is, the price is so over the top expensive that it's just plain absurd, and so nanturally I won't be ordering this ever again."

"Yes, this was strong but like anything worth enjoying, that's an afterthought because this was a beer that was not meant to be quaffed down in a hurry. The Dead payed at the Meadowlands here in Jersey more than at any other location and even though I never saw them there or anywhere else, the write-up on the side of the bottle expressed the desire to bottle the essence of a Dead show. Like a Green Flash beer, there's enough of a ""skunk"" here to make me think that I'm in the midst of haze of 420 but with the chewy and grainy granola aspect thrown in, has me thinking that a ""crunchie"" gave this to me at a concert. No matter - I enjoyed this and hopheads, deadheads, or even heads of a household would be wise to seek out this earthy, seemingly organic beer. There's a lot to like here for those who enjoy a beer that helps one to turn on , tune in, and drop out."
"It's lightly crisp all the way through. The body is medium and there's a flowing creaminess on the tongue. Neither the crispness nor the smoothness ever waver."

"Poured a light amber color with a decent inch head. Moderate lacing. The taste is on the maltier side of an IPA, not a ton of hops, in the nose or the taste either. Didn't get the granola flavor until the second half of the bomber, but it was there! Not a bad offering from DFH, but not one I would visit again."
""
"Pours into an imperial nonic a deep rich golden with a large blooming white head that really takes it's time settling slowly into a frothy mass,great carbonation.Aromas are lighter with some citric hops and nutty notes.To me this is DIPA all the way on the palate minus residual sweetness,caramel and nutty malts run into dry resiny hops with some more sweetness in a lingering finish.Not bad,not overly sweet just amp up the hops a little and this would be great in my opinion.I like this beer alot more than the Dead."

"Overall this would make a great year round beer. Hell I like it way better than 90minute."

""

"O: Ok, not what I was expecting at all. It appears that nobody can agree on the style either. Max's had it listed as an Imperial Pale and RB had it as an American Strong Ale. I really only got the granola in the scent."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with the granola adding a grainy aspect in the mix."
"O: Good flavor, creamy mouthfeel, but it has its flaws. I thought it’d be hoppier, and smoother. Decent at best."
"Overall: another fine brew from Dfh."

"Overall: Another good offering from DFH. While the hops are definitely there, I don't think this one is for for the extreme hop heads. Bitterness is mild, and it's pretty heavy on the malt sweetness. If you're looking for a malty pale ale though, this one will do the trick."
"Not a bad pale ale at all without quite hitting what I was hoping for. Easy to drink but didn't have any kind of wow factor for me."

"O- This was a nice showing by dogfish head. Nice use of the hops meshing with the granola. Not a mind-blowing beer, but very nicely put together and happier than most of their offerings."
"American Beauty to me will always be the movie which was a master piece. This beer is overly complex but the end result isn't that of a master piece but a lot of mixed up parts that don't really do much for me. Worth a shot but if you can get it on tap do that, avoid in bottles."
""
""
"O: Overall, a lighter beer with not a particularly large amount of flavors or anything particularly special, which is odd for a Dogfish beer. Certainly enjoyable, just not particularly memorable."
""
""
"O: Bah, another disappointment from DFH. The sad thing is that this had promise - there wasn't an overload of ridiculous ingredients, just a basic imperial pale ale with 'Merican hops and granola. The end result, though, is something that starts off nicely but quickly falls on its face faster than you can say ""Deadhead""."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty beer and a seriously mild IPA. Worth a try."
"O: On the one hand I appreciate that this is a DFH beer that is somewhat ""normal"" and doesn't include whatever piece of shit ingredient Sam decided to throw into the brew kettle on that particular day. One the other hand, the hop character is surprisingly subdued and overly soapy. It's not a bad beer, but it is a flawed beer. Sad to see the GD associated with it."
"If I could go back in time, I would have seen both of the Grateful Dead shows held in Highgate, VT back in 1994 and 1995. It took me a while but I eventually warmed up to The Dead. This beer will warm you up too!"

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a healthy three finger ivory head that dissipated very slowly, leaving massive lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, grassy hops, light citrus and hints of tropical fruit. Flavor begins with a burst of grassy, citrus hops and very nice blended fruit juice juice with apple, light tropical fruit and a hint of honey, finishes with sweet grain, lingering fruit juice and a nice grassy, slightly floral, bitterness. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess and active carbonation that gave this a very nice mouth feel. This is on the juicy, semisweet malt end of the IPA spectrum (at 9%, why isn't this an Imperial IPA?), the hops are assertive, but take a back seat to the very pleasant fruit forward maltiness. The granola apparently adds both flavor and creamy body to the beer that resembles oat pale ales. I don't know if I would have detected granola in a blind taste test, but knowing ahead of time, I can completely buy the oaty, grainy, fruit, light honey of granola as the flavor here. I really liked this a lot and had to pace myself because of the flavor and ABV. I will pick up another bottle if I see it. Hope this makes it into the Dogfish rotation."
"A very nice beer. It's not as hoppy as I would have liked but it's highly drinkable, especially at 9%. Very clean, too."

"25 ounce bottle of the dead bear hoisting a mug as American Beauty's emblem on this DFH label I am listening to the album American Beauty, the beer is crystal clear copper amber with a fine khaki head forming thick. Aroma floral hops citrus notes beautiful American hop bouquet I'm a fan going forth with this beer. Big honey notes of earthy grain from the granola additions this is a beer for hop heads and dead heads alike no worries there's both here to party. Flavor wise there's big hops with hints of whole grain granola hanging in there, it's a big beer experience the grains don't take away from the American hops in anyway I'm enjoying every last drop, slightly resinous hop oils reign supreme here, mouthfeel has an oily complexity medium bodied at best with rolling hints of big hops making it through in this big alcohol beer. Overall I'm thrilled to be party of history this beer is going to sell out in all markets due to the strong Dead following whether the beer is worth it's weight in gold or not. However, I feel that both parties are going to pleased with this offering."

"I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a mild IPA, or even a more malty lager. At 9%, this is dangerously drinkable no matter who you are."

"O) Doin' that rag!, was very impressed with this beer. I wasn't expecting much with it but now I can't wait to try on tap. It's worth the money for the bomber."
"Dogfish Head American Beauty ---4/5."
""
""
"A unique one for the fish, but nothing that is calling me back desperately. No worries there will be more hits, so since the Grateful Dead didn't exactly have many ""popular"" hits either what does it matter? More to drink for all!"
""
""
""
""
"O-actually it's pretty good. Not so good I'm upset this is unlimited but good enough I'd be willing to get a second bottle. It's not super hoppy or bitter but it's got a great flavor with a lot of complexities."
""
""
"O: I think this is another solid offering from DFH in their music/beer lineup. The beers in this series have all proven to be pretty fun and interesting and American Beauty fits in there nicely. Hop heads and others who are only after a hardcore Imperial IPA aren't going to be fans due to it's huge malt foundation but all of the pieces are here for a great beer regardless of what it's labeled. I'd happily get another bottle and share it with friends."

"O/D-I don't like the Grateful Dead and I'm rarelyartialy to Dogfish brews but the n,ae Imperial Pale struck me as very interesting. Well they sucked my ass in again. I can't believe I bought the beer. It wasn't bad but Jesus, $12.50 for essentially a mediocre DIPA that is tribute to a band that actually annoys me. Damn."
""
"I definitely enjoyed this offering from DFH. Some people may bash it, expecting more of a hop explosion from a DIPA, but I appreciate the balance, feel, and the way the sweet grain and hop flavors all work together. Very nicely done."
"O: I think DFH did an excellent job mixing granola with an imperial pale ale. The granola flavor really stands out and helps to leave a nice sweet finish on the palate. I like the fact that you can taste the granola and the hops of the pale ale. Very well done, I will need to pick up a few more of these."
""
""
"O: A really solid job by DFH. The granola is front and center with the hops the whole way. It lends a nice flavor as well as helping the mouthfeel a bit. Very easy to drink given the 9% abv. I'd definitely have this one again"

"over the moon stoked to get a bottle of this last night from a very close friend. I have been anticipating this more than any other beer in my life, as it combines two of my most favorite things in the whole wide world, craft beer and the traveling circus of good times that is the grateful dead. I put the record on, and I opened the bottle to a clear brassy light copper colored brew, brimming with fast paced carbonation and over an inch of soapy off white head that leaves thick and tall lacing etched in the glass as it drinks. one smell and ""I knew right away she was not like other girls", as there was a definitive granola aromatic. honey, oats, even almonds compliment the strong pale ale base beer, which is far more hoppy than I expected it to be. the taste is odd, almost like two different beers. a sweet nutty almost esb on the front of the tongue, and a bitter hoppy strong ale that could just as well be an arrogant bastard on the back of the palate. its a strange dichotomy, long and strange, just like the trip. the two never really join up, but its a cool effect nevertheless. way high carbonation, and a light body for how strong this is. I loved the complexity and the idea behind it more than anything else. don't know if I will ever get to have this again, but thanks to dogfish head for recognizing the importance of the best band that ever lived, and for anti-hierarchically figuring out a way to make it unique. one of the best labels in the beer world too. the sentiment might be better than the beer, but who cares. see ya at the next show!"
""
""
"American Beauty is an inquisitive ale that hasn't been all that ""Dogfish-ed"" up. Its a well-built beer where everything comes together nicely. There's really no debate of the ale's friendly and approachable taste. But much like the Grateful Dead's music, I find the beer a bit banal (gasp!)"

"M: Light medium bodied."

"Edit: original review was at brewery, having one back in DC on tap, the granola is more noticeable, and it seems more woody than grassy."
