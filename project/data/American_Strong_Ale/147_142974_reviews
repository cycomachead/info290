"Overall: Very good brew, something that was very well needed for a pretty long day. Happy Easter to everyone. Salud!"
"Another soulf Stone creation."
""
""
""
"In the end, this well blended gem comes off much like a light-bodied version of a bourbon barrel barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bourbon was very heavy, really felt just like watered down bourbon"
"Overall about what I expected, Arrogant Bastard + Bourbon."
""
"I'm not a fan of the regular version but this is certainly better.  Still has a lingering bitterness that seems to strong. BBL effects complement rather than overpos=wering the underlying ale."
""
""
"Malty, piney and bourbon. A bit thin. I think double or lucky would have been a better base"
"Solid BA beer. I like how the bourbon doesn't show up like a bully and start pushing all the other flavors around. Nice barrel character as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was not feeling this. The base beer is a solid brew, and i felt like the barrel aging hindered my enjoyment of the beer instead of enhanced it. Found the after taste to be unpleasant"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This kinda tastes like you dropped a shot of bourbon into an Arrogant Bastard. It's very bourbon forward which runs over any other flavors that may be present."
""
""
"Nice amber hue with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of khaki colored head rests on top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Loads of malt and notes of sweet bourbon are apparent in the nose.  The flavor is initially malt and then a wallop of bourbon and plenty more bready malt.  Citrus hops reveal themselves in the back of the palate.  The mouth is thick and a bit warm with alcohol."

"Overall - really good and complex but not my favorite arrogant bastard"
"Mouthfeel is dry, moderately thin. Overall, I think I'd rather have regular Arrogant Bastard, but this isn't bad."
""
""
"Not for the everyday, but I would be glad to have this again sometime."
""
""
"Overall, this may be the best variation on a Bastard Stone have come up with yet.  Was it worth the expense to buy a 4 pack with three other Bastard variants to get it, though?  Ummm...."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a mug, the beer is a dark brown with amber highlights, a thin, foamy, clingy, off-white head. Some carbonation action throughout the body, too. Aromas of vanilla, brown sugar, resinous hops, a subtle spice blend, and old world fruit sweetness. Very rich and layered. Flavors are hopped bitter forward, with a resinous blast of bitter green notes, followed by a vanilla and woody undertone, a heavy dose of booze, and all of the sweet and rich notes from the aromas seem to lessen. Very subtle Belgian yeast notes and spice blend nod their head in there, too, to add some depth. The body is robust and smooth, with a boozy and hop resinous aftertaste. The finish is slick and dry, with a booze and old world fruit linger cleaned up from the heavy hops bitterness. Big beer, and damn tasty."
""
""
"O: excellent beer."
""
""
"O - My favorite variant and I think I like this more than AB.  Really well balanced and just enough bourbon without the booziness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  7.8% used to be a huge beer…now it’s fairly tame.  That said, 7.8% is still dangerous, especially when it goes down this easy and with this much interesting complexity to keep you coming back for that next sip."
""
"Little disappointed about this beer is very thin little to no bourbon flavor a little oak flavor and a bit bitter on the finish"
"Overall I still find the base AB brew delicious.  The kiss of bourbon up front was very nice.  I wish the barrel aging could have been longer than a few weeks or however long it was."

"Pours a nice clear amber color with a white two finger head of active foam that hangs around a decent time. Smells of malt and wood with a sweet finish. The taste is that of a slightly more refined Arrogant Bastard. The bourbon is subtle at best, but a nice vanilla tone is to be found, along with brown sugar and a nice alcohol tingle. It has decent body and adequate carbonation to produce an enjoyable feeling. Overall it is a great beer. It will probably fall short of what some people expect from a barrel aged beer, but it's a solid offering. If you like regular Arrogant Bastard this is certainly worth trying."

"O: Nice, balanced beer that I'd happily have all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"F: Fairly light bodied for a barrel aged beer.  Somewhat creamy.  Long, bitter finish."
"O: Tasty though I like the original Arrogant Bastard better. This could use more bourbon influence and needs to round out the body on the back half"
"Sampled at Snallygaster 2014. Like Arrogant Bastard with a hint of bourbon."
"Lots of negative reviews but I think this one is excellent.  Perfect for all of those haters of the regular arrogant bastard this one is much less aggressive and bitter than the regular. Great balance of malt sweetness to bitter hop,  with a nice but not overpowering bourbon presence. Would definitely buy again if I had the chance."
""
""
"Seemed like a weak effort by Stone to get something in the bourbon barrel aged category.  Very mild bourbon flavor was a nice addition but didn't add that much complexity to the beer overall.  Expected more from this one."
"Overall: A pretty good balanced brew. Good strong notes of earthy hops and toasty malt. The barrel presence could have been a little stronger."
""
""
""
"O: The barrel tames Arrogant Bastard a bit. This is still a ridiculously aggressive beer, but where the base beer by itself never falls below notch 11, this is smoothed down to perhaps a 9.5. The hops in particular are a little less bitey. The barrel itself adds a woody and charred character that complements what's already gong on. A shorter aging of about a year, give or take a little time, might even be appropriate though not necessary."
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer overall. I would pick this one up again if I saw it."
"O - A great variation of an already great beer."
""
""
""
"o - a lot of the AB variants have been hit or miss with me but this is a definite hit."
"Pours serene with  ruby glow.  Tan head of creamy foam.  The taller glass favored the look better on my two pours.  Sweet, tropical with a bourbon scent.Light bread and a soft floral.  Really light sweet wood.  It's bitter and herbal in the drink.  With tea like back note.  Soft pepper. Very nice.  The bourbon on the palate is round sweetness among leafier more herbal qualities.  Strong, warming, finishes dry and bitter like a tonic with a touch of sweet fruit."
""
""
"This is really unexpected and a neat creation.  Like how it manages the hop forward aspects of classic arrogant bastard, but with some real interesting barrel character that push the flavor and feel in a different direction.  Real cool."
"Overall - I feel like the barrel in this added a really refined feel to the regular AB, and I love how Stone used the barrel to add complexity and nuance, ultimately complementing instead of dominating - a masterful touch which resulted in smoothing out regular AB's more rough (arrogant) characteristics. A fantastic brew."
"Getting no barrel whatsoever. Kind of think it was a scam by Stone to get people to buy boxes. Pretty disappointed in this. Taste like regular AB. Seriously, no effort was put into this."

"D - Good beer.  Glad to try."

"      D/O  Drinkability is much like the other Arrogant Bastards.  Personally I could only do one bomber in an evening.  This beer is meant to be savored and enjoyed, not to be drank in a serial manner.  Overall this is a world class beer made better with Bourbon Barrel Aging.  Bravo!   4.5"
"Not an amazing beer an interesting drink kinda confused between some of the complex flavors."
""
"Generally I am a fan of bourbon and BBA brews, but I honestly prefer this Arrogant Bastard without the bourbon."
""
""
""
"Smooth but thin bodied, this beer has a complex flavor.  Very good darker malt base to start, but the swallow brings a nice, if subtle, hop bitterness.  Long aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe the best value barrel aged ale I've had.  Bastard bomber 4 pack from costco was $15.00 and that include a Lucky and a Double Bastard as well.  It does taste a little boozy for the surprisingly low ABV but I very much enjoyed.  I got the bourbon flavor right up front and found it still lingered after the swallow along with a woody finish."
""
""
"22oz bottle from the Box of Bastards 4 pack. Pours a semi translucent reddish brown with very little head. Some lacing. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, bread, caramel malts, and raisins. The taste is bourbon and lots of wood. Some vanilla as well as more breadiness, dark fruits and some light citrus peel. A bit nutty. Tastes boozier than the 7.8% abv. Finishes with more bourbon and wood flavor. Light mouthfeel with not a lot of carbonation. Overall, its a pretty decent beer but not much of an improvement on the regular and oaked versions."

"good job stone"
"O:  An enjoyable beer, overall, but I wish the bourbon were stepped up a couple of notches.  Arrogant Bastard is a potent, aggressive beer and the barrel treatment just can't seem to compete at all with what's already in the beer."
"O: The vanilla notes from the barrel are the biggest difference from the base, but the barrel definitely effects the beer in a good way overall. Not hot or overly boozy in any way, which makes it nicely drinkable and a solid release. Definitely worth picking up in the Bastard Box"

"22 oz Bomber.Got this in a four pack with other Bastards.Poured into 20 oz Firestone glass a golden color .Smell is quite hoppy.I loved this.Got to say it went down great.Have not tried the rest of the box but if there all like this I`m going to love this set.Great price of 19.99 for four Bastards.Nice ABV of 7.8.Pick some of these up.If your a Stone fan you will love it."

"Bottle. Pours a clear Amber color with a mild head. Aroma is sweet and oaky with noticeable bourbon character. The flavor is highly influenced by the barrel. Lacks the bitterness that the base beer boasts. It's fruity and sweet with some caramel and toast flavor. The finish is heavy with bourbon character. Vanilla bean, dried, tannic woodiness. Genuine bourbon finish. The barrel dominated much of the beer as it should. Fuller bodied with ligher carbonation and lingering woody flavor. Not my favorite Bastard but a new take on an old standby."
""
""
""
"Overall - If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this were the Oaked AB. I just get very little bourbon influence; it's much more oak driven. I'd love to do a side by side, because I don't think they're far off. They both tame the AB's aggressiveness with a nice, mellow oak woodiness. Overall, and a steal at which I got the Bastard Box."

"22 ounce bottle, printing is a bit smudged but it looks like it says it was bottled on 09/24/14.  Served in a snifter, the beer pours a mostly clear ruby red/chestnut brown color with about an inch light tan head.  Head retention is OK, and there's a lot of lacing.  I like the aroma, it smells like piney hops, dark fruit, caramel, oak, and a bit of vanilla and bourbon.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and citrus peel noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and has a decent amount of carbonation.  I'm not sure how long this was aged in bourbon barrels, but I'd guess it wasn't for a very long time.  Not that I'm complaining, but this was hoppier and less bourbony than I expected it to be.  With that being said, I liked it.  Part of the Bastard Box, $20 for bombers of regular, bourbon barrel, Lukcy Basartd and Double Bastard isn't a bad deal at all!"

"This one is a lower ABV and thus lighter bodied BBA than I'm used to. But I came to really enjoy it. The smoke, oak and bourbon flavors are very much there but it's not overpoweringly boozy or syrupy. If you want a beer that imparts the taste of bourbon but isn't gonna hit you over the head this great. By the end I thought I was drinking liquid wood in a good way. Arrogant Bastard bitterness was still somewhat there and it blended nicely on the finish with the woody qualities. Even for bourbon drinkers who don't always want to sip on a whiskey to get the flavors they're after should try this beer if they get the chance."
"While I enjoyed Bourbon Barrel Aged Arrogant Bastard a little more than the base, it fell short of being the ""Southern Charred Jr"" I hoped for. Still an enjoyable enough brew that I'm happy to have tried."
"Gotta love the perks of showing up right at the beginning of a Stone mini-tap-takeover.  This stuff pours a lightly-hazy tawny-amber topped by a finger of dirty khaki foam (gotta take those slacks off before you hit the rugby pitch).  The nose comprises oak, maple syrup, mild whiskey, and mixed greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, with a tad more syrup and oak, some pine resin, and a twinge of sharp grapefruit rind.  The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, I feel some of the Bastard is missing in this incarnation, but it's pretty tasty, regardless."

"A good barrel that is woody but not like a 2x4, smooth yet fresh feeling oak. The essence of arrogance balances this out and overall its a smooth, flavorful beast."

"Poured into an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass. Pours a deep red amber with ruby tones and a half finger light khaki head that dissipates to patches, but leaving good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus hops, light oak and bourbon. Flavor is mellow dark malt with suggestions of dark dried fruit, citrus hops and a pleasant light oak and bourbon overlay. Lightly creamy body, but light carbonation. An interesting take on the Arrogant Bastard line, with the same classic hop profile, but softer and more integrated. The malt is reminiscent of old ale malt more than the lighter caramel malt in the base beer, which is a great fit with the other flavors. The bourbon and oak are less forward than in other bourbon ales or oaked Bastard, but integrate well. Although there is a good bitter finish, no a hop bomb like the base beer and other variants, but still hop forward. Very different than the original and from what I expected, but I like this a lot. The more subtle flavors played well with each other and none dominate. I'd get this again if it was brewed. I was reluctant to buy the four pack just to try this one, but the other beers in it are so great (I actually liked Lukcy better this time around) that it was pretty painless. Great four pack."

""
"Overall / Drinkability:  A slow sipping beer, and indeed it is Arrogant Bastard with a bourbon accent.  One is enough per evening.  The alcohol is well hidden, but to my surprise this beer is more of a palate wrecker than I thought it would be.  Arrogant Bastard doesn't tire out my tastebuds as much as this one does.  Still a very enjoyable beer though."

"This is by far and away my favorite bourbon barrel beer I've had thus far. The barrel flavor is subtle, but there for sure, and that is definitely a plus for me. Nice added complexity. To my surprise, I am very much enjoying this one, as I'm not the biggest fan of spirit barrel aged beers. I'd definitely recommend at least trying it"
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is far from being a bourbon bomb. Which is a good thing—the subtle barrel/spirit notes (a bit of oak, some vanilla, hints of toffee, brown sugar, and maybe coconut) blend really nicely into the background of the standard Arrogant Bastard profile. While I could see a more barrel-forward brew being just as complex, it could just as easily suffer and become one-dimensional. In the increasingly crowded field of barrel-aged everything, Stone once again proves that they can set themselves apart and do something interesting. [Bomber, from the Bastard box set.]"

"I haven't checked others reviews but I imagine there may be issues with the lack of an overwhelming bourbon presence. I actually like the subtler approach and that I can still taste the malty red qualities. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was expecting a lot more out of this. The barrel aging is too subtle and the beer isn't strong enough to stand up to it, which is too bad since if it was stronger it could really accentuate the flavor profile. Charge us an extra four bucks and barrel age the x2 bastard next time. Also bomber mixpack only beers suck, cut that shit out Stone. Yeah it's cheaper than buying them individually, but I could have bought the other three separately and frankly this single beer is way too mediocre to commit $25 to"

"I am all over the place on this one. Honestly, not really sure what to think (I know, real helpful huh?) From a bourbon aged standpoint, I am not impressed much. It does seem to give it a much smoother, mellow feel, but the flavor is very faint. Much more noticeable in the aroma. There is a little wood flavor and some burn as it gets warm, but I think it is drowned out by the hop profile. It is slightly sour too, like raisins. Some caramel malts and much more muted hops than any of the other bastards. I definitely like it more than regular Arrogant, but not sure if I prefer over Oaked other than the feel. I would describe it as a cross between an american barley wine and an old ale. Very good overall."

"22oz bottle from the new Bastard four pack which is a great deal at $22. Looks pretty much like standard Arrogant Bastard. Aroma is a very nice bourbon and oak aroma. Flavor is good, basically AB with a touch of bourbon but for me it's a little too thin. Bourbon barrel aged Double Bastard would probably work a lot better."
