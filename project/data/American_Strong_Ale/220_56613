4.1,4.6,4,4,4.25,4,4,"From my tasting notes: Lagunitas says it’s a Brown Ale, but in pure Lagunitas style they ratchet up the hops to a level that thoroughly blurs that line. It poured a copper brown with a malty sweetness on the aroma with a hint of hops. The taste was like a mixture of a brown ale and an IPA. There was the sweet nuttiness of the malt balanced by the signature Lagunitas hop bitterness that created another great brew. The body was full and helped weigh down the hoppy profile while maintaining its high drinkability. The WTF was another fine beer from Lagunitas!","brurevu","Oct 07, 2013"

Upon settling, a hearty ring of bubbles surrounds the surface while a solid dusting covers it. The aroma is of caramel malt, earthy hops, a bit of spice, and a solid dose of orange/lemon citrus. Some nuts (cashews, most predominantly), toast, and ubiquitous "dark fruit" is buried in there as well. It tastes of citrus, a suite of hops (bitter, earthen, and spicy all appear), and some grass up front. Quickly, the more robust malts push through, and caramel, toast, nuts, plum, and a bit of toffee come through. The mouthfeel is initially lightened by the carbonation, but becomes viscous, sticky, and resinous before too long. Finish is dry. Overall, this is a good strong ale that I'd happily drink again. Like many things (everything?) from Lagunitas, there are a ton of hops here, and they play nicely with the maltier base.","eclipse54","Aug 21, 2013"

Spicy rye, ripe fruits behind that and pine. Big caramel malt, some bread and a nice touch of chocolate to tempt the palate. As it warms you can notice a little soy quality that ultimately detracts. Taste upfront is big sweet malt , the rye spiciness and some toasted bread. The chocolate is very nice on top of that. Delicate and fruity hops come in with some bitter and oily resin to coat the mouth and it goes down easy and a little nutty. Finishes a little sticky and slightly dry. It’s a plucky little ale that I would have rated higher had it not become salty after a while and had it not tasted so very similar to all the other lagunitas beers.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The aroma was tell tale Lagunitas with spicy hops front and center, taste flashed the hops and took it to citrus/pit fruit tang that I love from the brand. This Strong Ale has all the good points of a IPA and the ABV of a Barley Wine, solid mouthfeel that lets you know you are drinking something. Overall I'm glad I tried this and always grab new stuff from this brand.","Bear1964","Jun 05, 2013"

An inch of creamy, tan head sticks around as well as to the glass. Hoppy aromas of grapefruit and pine are very noticeable, and very Lagunitas like. Muted caramel and toasted malt aromas provide some contrast to the hoppiness. The caramel malt sweetness, with just a touch of rye, opens the palate up to receive a wallop of citrus and piney hop that pulls through the finish. Medium in both body and carbonation, this Recovery ale weighs in at a hefty 7.8% ABV. Another winner from the folks in Petaluma!","phishsihq","May 06, 2013"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"I liked this a lot, id call it a hoppy American brown ale before I call it a strong ale, but I suppose that's inconsequential here. this beer pours a nice clear lighter brown, indian red maybe, with a pillowy tan head with outstanding retention. the nose is way hoppy for a brown, it crowds out any malt sweetness and plays off the bitter cocoa powder element perfectly. the flavor is also quite hopped up, and for once in a lagunitas beer, that same old yeast strain actually works here! at least it doesn't detract from the feature elements I should say, its a non-issue, which is nice for a change. love the roasty malts with the hop bitter, its an underutilized combination of flavors. great carbonation and soft texture to a bigger beer. the finish is complex and chocolate forward, but there is also a little residual sugar that challenges the hops. this is a great beer, totally unique, and one I will absolutely be buying again. outstanding stuff.","StonedTrippin","Apr 06, 2013"

Pungent, fresh, citrus hop aromas with pine hops, toffee and sweet caramel malt beneath. Thick, syrupy feel despite the agressive, slightly fizzy carbonation. Pungent grapefruit and citrus hops up front followed by a tangy and brown sugary sweetness through the middle - a signature taste for Lagunitas brews. Citrus hop bitterness trends to pine hop flavors to the end. A strong sweet caramel malt backbone flavor throughout. Finished with a malty and pine bitter aftertaste.","IronLover","Apr 04, 2013"

Taste is sweet and malty before being overthrown by hops, citrus, pine, pineapple and grapefruit, nicely bitter throughout before settling into a nice dry finish.

Aroma of malt, light fruit and light hops. Interesting flavor progression. Intense hop aroma and start, then a nice malty, lightly nutty middle with light citrus and subtle, well melded malt and hop finish. Medium to thick body. Interesting and satisfying.

Smell is quite malty with some caramel and herbal hop aromas. Taste is of brown sugar, caramel, and herbal hop flavors up front with a very malty backbone. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that to me seems like a hybrid between a barleywine and an IPA. Good stuff.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 19, 2012"

The flavoring was simple, but expertly crafted, with honey and sweet hops adding to an already sweet beer, without causing it to become overpoweringly sugary.

It's a fine brew and a nice change of pace, but it's one of those beers I'd have to be in the mood to drink. Part of me wants to cellar one and see what happens.","ryan1788a5","Jun 04, 2012"

This beer pours a deep amber with a nice head on top. There is lacing but it fades fast. The smell is a bouquet of citrus. I don't really know what an imperial brown ale is supposed to smell like. The smell is decent, but its nothing amazing. Upon tasting this beer you can defiantly detect a hop not followed off by some kind of malt backbone. The beer feels fairly smooth in the mouth. This beer is decent, but its nothing to write home about. I give it a 7 out of 10","ADemshar","Apr 12, 2012"

3.67,-6.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear, dark chestnut color with a slender head quickly fading to a patchy covering. Juicy, fruity hop bouquet...sweet, oily, and floral primarily with some citrus and a surprisingly mild caramel note. More juicy, dank hop oils hit the tongue in typical Lagunitas fashion. It's not a particularly intense beer in any aspect - well done in the hop department, though the flavor tends to vanish as quickly as it comes. If you chew on it a bit, the hop character is nice...dried fruity, resinous, citrusy. Increasingly malty as it warms, but it never comes all that close to what I would venture to call an "Imperial Brown Ale". Some caramel, brown sugar, and nuts. Medium bodied with a creamy slickness. The ambiguous hoppy strong ale style is something these guys do a lot of and they typically do a good job. While this doesn't stand out in any way, it is well crafted as usual.","wedge","Apr 07, 2012"

Aromas of grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, orange, herbal, pine, and nuttiness. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of big pine, caramel, biscuit, toast, herbal, orange, grapefruit, nuttiness, and a bit of molasses. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, citrus, biscuit, nut, and toast on the finish for a good period. Some nice malt balance, but this is still a very hop forward beer as would be expected from these guys. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and oily mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Definitely a beer that should be sipped on. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable hoppy brown ale. Good amount of balance and complexity. I would like to see what age brings this one; this was a very fresh bottle.","superspak","Mar 24, 2012"

It is juicy, soft on the palate, and slightly warming, with a pleasant maltiness that serves as a counterbalance to the hoppy character that lingers on the tongue. A bitter, long finishing drink that pairs well with food, this is an ale to be savored, only to be brought out when the need for a little good cheer is pressing.","Keene","Dec 09, 2011"

Mouth is full with mostly the raisin/prune aftertaste. Just a touch of bite at the end and in a bit of foaming. Taste is all of the above.

Some cherry and faint amount of raisin. Fruity malt flavor upfront. Bready caramel backbone with cherries and raisins. The middle is slightly sweet with more of a grape twist than raisin. Finishes dry. I was expecting a tangy sweet end but this dryness was surprising. In a good way. As the beer warms the 8% shines through. The cherry flavor turns medicinal.

4.88,24.5,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is my 1st review here on BA after about 3 months of trying new styles of REAL BEER and after doing my 1st home brew this morning (Dunkel Weisen). Right or wrong this is my take on this brew. Poured this bad boy into my Chicago Cubs mug for ole #10 Ron Santo, rest in peace; you were a Cubbie till the very end ! This brew pours a dark Pepsi Cola brown with red tint and 1 finger off white head which dwindles down to a frothy layer atop the brew. There are 40 umpteen tiny bubbles surfacing from the bottom, it looks 	more like a soda than a beer. Smell is fairly astingent, alcohol, dark fruit, dark roast coffee, piney hops. Wow, I figured the hops would blow me away, but that's not the case at all. Alcohol and hops are well hidden with the roasted malts taking front and center. Semi dry on the tongue and mouth. Can taste the hops half way through the mug, but still not overly bitter. Dark roasted coffee becoming more prominent. As it warms more the piney hops continue to come forward, still not offputting. Becoming semi clowey in the throat. (2nd pour) Head hangs around somewhat longer than the 1st pour, dark malts dominate the smell now, followed by dark roast 	coffee. The lacing is a stringy patchy impression that weeps downward. Back to the dark roast coffee and dark malts on the tongue with bittering hops coming forward half way through the mug. I like this, how it moves from dark coffee/malts forward to bittering hops forward as you move from the top towards the bottom of the mug. Spider web layers of off white lacing as you move 3/4's of the way through the mug. I've never experienced a brew like this that is so multi faceted as you move from the top to the bottom of the mug. Starting to pick up some sweet crystal malts near 80% through the mug. This is an amazing brew, multifaceted to the Nth degree. Reminds me of the days of Or, when chemicals were used to expand the mind. I'm gonna have to 	say AfrigginMazing. Thanks Lagunitas for a step back into my sorid past, some 30+ years ago.The only thing that would have made this better would have been to be listening to Jimmy Hendrix blarring Purple Haze.

I love maltiness and was excited about this beer, but I can't taste anything under this intense leafy flavour. I'm so against misleading descriptions on a beer bottle. And this was the worst. Bleh.

Hops are mostly apparent in the aftertaste. The beer is medium body and quite smooth (with the exception of aftertaste which leaves bitterness in your mouth). I find this beer a bit disjointed.

Taste is interesting; not overly special or standout, though hard to pin down. Full bodied, characters of a Brown and a Strong Ale. Malt forward on the palate with some hop bitterness but not much. Mouth feel is medium to light bodied, dry finish. Overall a great choice at this moment, as I was completely undecided what to have and this beer isn't even sure what it is/offers.

Taste leads with the solid malt profile as described above, hops come through with notes of pine and citrus, some dark fruit notes creep through, beer finishes muddy and earthy.

The aroma is moderately malty--biscuit, caramel, a bit of a raisins mixed with all the malt is a burst of citrus hops in the background. The flavor starts with a burst of citrus and piny hops mixed with a bittersweet, caramel malts. The beer finishes slightly dry with a long lasting bittersweet hop flavor. The beer boasts a smooth medium-full body with medium-high perceived hop bitterness. Overall a very tasty, good looking beer. The flavor profile definitely tilts hops, which was a bit of a surprise given the nose, but I like it, kind of fitting given the name...where the hell are we going, up or down, hops or malt?","uwmgdman","May 07, 2011"

I would recommend letting it sit outside the fridge for a little bit before really judging it. I probably won't get this beer again but it is certainly worth a try.

The taste has a nice sweet backbone, caramel malts and dark fruits present with hints of citrus hops at the end for a slight bite. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation.

There is an aroma of oak and malt that is light, and the lightness is actually very pleasant. The initial tastes are malt and caramel, with a sour/bitter undertone. The bitterness is residual through the aftertaste, and also balances well with the rest of the beer. The beer is very smooth and light in mouth, and leaves a light film/residue.

I also get a very strange scent of meat. Initially, I get some very sweet malts with some molasses. Some smokiness and some woody flavors follow, ending with a smooth hop bitterness. The alcohol is also present as this beer warms up a bit. Very tasty as the flavors adapt to your palate and your mouth gets used to it. The mouthfeel is very nice.

Taste starts with a good pine and lemon rind hop bite, then thick roasted malts and brown sugar, clove, licorice, some fruity esters, then finishes with grapefruit, pine, burnt sugar, and a healthy alcohol burn.

It has a pretty full body that's very smooth with a slick finish. Pine, citrus, roast and chocolate combine to make a nice, full flavor. It has a long, bitter, resiny finish.

From the nose is some cinnamon, malt, evergreen lead, and gum. From the taste one mostly gets the battle between malt and hops, with some juicy fruit thrown in there for good measure. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side, letting the malt get the better of the hops in the end. I have to admit that this was a little tough to get through. I almost felt like I was drinking a glass of beer in the vain of Wrigely's cinnamon gum, if that makes any sense. Good, but not great. Worth a try, but probably just one from me.

Then it turns to the malts, with lots of dark malts, roast and some coffee flavors come through, then more caramel, some toffee, a little sweet stickiness, and lots of brown sugar. A surprising blend of heavy malts and roast with nice spicy and piny hops. Normally I would think the amounts of each would not contrast well, but Lagunitas pulls it off again. I'm a big fan.","jlindros","May 09, 2010"

Hazy brownish amber, not red enough for mahogany, translucent but not opaque, some dilution around the rims. Sweet, not sugary, nose of candied orange peel, rose hips, toffee, molasses, coconut, as it warms it sharpens and you get white grapefruit, nectarine, papaya, pineapple fruit, fairly "tropical," hops dominate without bitterness, herbaceousness. Full-bodied, the carbonation comes close to causing discharge when you start sipping. Here more chocolate, vanilla, toffee and coffee ice cream upfront. As it hits your throat the hops switch things up, pine, flowers, mixed sour citrus and pumpernickel bread. Touch more restraint in the peach, apricot, pineapple, mango fruit, flavorful but not out to smack you down. The molasses and honey return to saturate the finish, coconut oil too.

Once again, Lagunitas has made a really pretty beer. The aroma is odd. Big piney, resiny hops mixed with brown sugar and chocolate. Bit of raisin. The flavor is much the same. Up front, once again, you get this big piney hops, semi brutalizing the palate. Not what I expected, then it completely switches gears and hits you with brown sugar, a little bit of sweet chocolate, prunes and raisins, then bam, its back to the hops for the finish. The mouthfeel is light and perfectly carbonated. For me, this is a marriage that ends in divorce. The flavors just don't work together and instead butt heads.","hwwty4","May 04, 2010"

Pours a deep mahogany brown hue with a nice fulfilling two finger gap of light khaki head floating above the body of this brew. Minimal amounts of speckled lacing cling to my imperial pint glass I'm imbibing from. Aromatics bring out some nice hops with herbal tea leaf and citric qualities going down. A spearmint herbal tone really interweaves with the dark roasted malty layers as well brings out some cookie dough and creamy malt notes as well. Flavors include a nice biscuit dark roasty brown malt backbone kicking up the dust with a few scraps of herbal/citric/and minty hop bursts flying across the palate, quite the excellent experience. As it warms the hops brighten in the best possible way, I will call this an IBA, quite possibly the best example I have had of the India Brown Ale thus far competing closely between DFH and Terrapin versions that I've enjoyed. Like a nice hop tea joined with some Italian Biscotti, those brown malts make this a warm and inviting experience. Mouthfeel is soft carbonation is sturdy yet restrained enough to let the beer do the talking excellent finish on the palate with occasional citric hop burps arising in the back of the throat this is one kick ass drinking beer. No worries find this one and give it a shot what does the title refer to or mean? I have no clue but I know good beer when I see it. I'm glad it made me tune into Wilco's Yanke Hotel Foxtrot, fuckin' classic listening jewel to go along with this great drinking IBA.","WVbeergeek","Apr 23, 2010"

The hops are there with some spicyness then the malt perks up but gets slammed down again in the finish. Cofffe comes into play then quickly vanishes as well.

This brew cannot really seem to reconcile the malt and hop element thought both would be superb on their own.

Overall this was another nice brew from Lagunitas. The scent was great, and the taste was clean and enjoyable (although they were fairly different). Basically the same hop profile as all recent Lagunitas beers, but with a bolder, roastier malt to counter-balance the flavor. The body was good, and the alcohol was decently hidden, so it was easy to drink.

The palate opens with a moderate hop bite, quite pine like, along with a blend of caramel, brown sugar and toasted malt. Maybe a touch of chocolate? Sweetness is moderate, and it doesn't feel like all the flavors have come together very well.

Tastes like a dull hoppy amber ale I guess I was figuring there might be more of a toasty "brown ale" malt presence to this thing.

Taste is the same. Too much hops for me. The label says "malty (and) robust," but I'm not getting a whole lot of malts, and certainly not much robustness. This is hoppy, and one-dimensional in it's malt character. There is some nice balance in there as it warms up, some sweetness starts to show through, light caramel and breadiness with maybe (just maybe) a hint of chocolate. Overall, not digging it too much. This falls under the category of the so-called "India Brown Ale" but this misses the mark when comparing to what others have done. It tastes like a typical West Coast IPA with a little chocolate malt thrown in. I really felt this was one-dimensional and unimpressive. I thought jamming to some Wilco would save the experience, but even one of my favorite bands in the world could do this beer no justice.","KeefD","Mar 28, 2010"

If the majority of brown ales tasted like this, I would be a much bigger fan of the style. Whether Wilco was a play on the name or not, I hope they appreciate the effort that was put into the creation of this brew as it is worthy of their (and your) immediate attention.

The appearance was a clear mahoganey brown with about a 1 finger tan head. The foam slowly settled leaving a thin film of bubbles on the surface. There is a strong roasted malt aroma. The flavor is very balanced between the roasted malt and the hops. At 64.2 IBUs it satisfies the cravings for bitterness but provides the maltiness of a lager. The bitterness also lingers long on the palate. The mouthfeel is rather even, not very sharp on the tongue. Medium bodied, in that you get a full flavor profile throughout. As opposed to thinner beers that you don't know you're even drinking. As far as drinkability, I could go back to this beer again and again. I'll have to see where it may be on draft.","trekbiker3000","Mar 27, 2010"

Nice aroma, the beer smells like chocolate, caramel, toffee, and pine and citrusy hops. The brew tastes like caramel malt, citrus (grapefruit) and pine hops, bready malt, and some chocolate and brown sugar. Great balance between the hops and malt in the flavor of this brew, although I think the hops flavors are stronger. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with light/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew. I'll definitely buy this again, especially considering the low price (I think it was just $4.99 a bomber).

The beer pours a deep reddish brown, maybe ruby... is that a real color? There's not much head on my pour perhaps because I'm drinking it a bit warm. The aroma has a whole mess of well-developed malt notes with some nice piney, citrusy hops. There's a bit of chocolate, but I'm getting more caramel fruit flavors with touches of rye spice and nuts. The flavor is a rich and could have easily gone too sweet but hops and yeast keep the malt in check. Full, thick feel. This beer drinks bigger than its abv. Another nice one from Lagunitas.","popery","Mar 26, 2010"

Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that said, it has a silky texture that glides down the throat with more ease than a 7.8% beer should.
