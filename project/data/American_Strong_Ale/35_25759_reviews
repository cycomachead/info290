"This just isnt beer.  Way too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is just perfection, if you like cordial-like flavors. From the deep ruby hue, to the warm, inviting smell, next to the way it just coats your mouth with deep, dark fruit flavors, I just can't get enough of this beer. A steep price, yes, but small pours and the look it brings to people's faces when you break it out make it a worthy investment."

"10th Anniversary edition, 2012. Only had a few ounces, but it was more than enough. Rich and sweet, with boozy dark fruits and figs. Drank like a brandy or dessert liquor. Very nice though, unlike any other beer I've tried."

"Amazingly complex I felt as if I was drinking a brandy. Very smooth and very strong. One of the best beers but paired with a high price tag"
"The body is viscous and thick, and the alcohol is at 29%, yet this is incredibly pleasant to drink, much more than any spirit that I have tried."
""
""
""
"Not even sure how/why this is a beer. I wouldn't drink this if it came in $8 6-packs, forget the insane price it sells for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly lighter caramel coloring, but still rich. Has a sherry/amarone type nose and has a rich taste that for its abv, is remarkably balanced. I'm not positive if this is the best beer I have ever had, but nothing else comes to mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Totally worth the search for it"
""
""
"I am new 2 all this but I've had some good stuff and by far I think this is the best of what I've had so far. It looks cool, smells great, and goes down easy just like I like it!"
"Overall (4.5), what can I say about this beer. Prior to having it, it's one of those beers that it's easy to remain aloof about--the price point is so over the top that thoughts of ""how good could it really be?"" come naturally. I've always wanted to try it--mostly for the novelty of a 30% ""beer""--but also recognized that it would surprise me if the opportunity never presented itself, given that I wouldn't go out of my way to procure a bottle and probably would balk at the cost if one ever crossed my path. Now that I've had it, I can honestly say that I would actually have to talk myself out of buying a bottle if I came across one, and that in spite of it's high rating on BA, I think it might actually be underrated. It's just an amazingly well-done and envelope-pushing beer."
"Fine sherry with nutty notes, lite syrup. An exceptional beer and worth the hype."
"This beer is a definite experience and I'm stoked to have had the opportunity to try something I wouldn't have bought for myself it's an incredibly smooth beer at that high of an abv that is surprisingly drinkable and to me tastes like a world class barley wine that had been age in bourbon barrels but the bourbon flavor faded away"
"WOW!  Strong but magnificent!   Split the cost of this with 2 other guys and we are sipping it over the next 6 months as it is waaaayyy strong!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This stuff is not beer. It's liquor. Very strong on the first sip.  It cools down after a few sips, but that might be because your drunk. This is an interesting experience, not all I hoped for though."
""
""
""
""
"Cannot taste the alcohol, but, it is there"

"I bought this beer several years ago and opened it on my 30th B day. Very complex with layers of flavor. Hats off to the vision they had to age a beer 18 years. I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The question is- “Is it worth the $200+?” and my answer is going to be absolutely yes. If you understandably can’t afford the decanter try a $20 two ounce pour at a bar. Frankly, that might be the best way to try it. If you do get the decanter it’s got to be something you share, it has to be conversational; a sign of what great things beer can be at one of its outliers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall,  this is a must try and, for me,  lives up to the hype. It's just a sipper,  so your 2oz pours sould last a while!"

"Had it for the first time at 2013 FOBAB, unbelievable, never had anything like it , ever. Extremely complex, a ton going on in there, and unbelievably delicious. Like an aged 120 minute IPA, with a HoTD Matt, and a Bruery BBA Melange #3, and some cognac tossed in for good measure; something everyone should experience at least once, if not buy it for future delights."

"I was lucky enough to taste the most recent two releases (2012 & 2103) side by side, and I have to say that the addition of KMF made a huge difference. It definitely added a lot of extra fruit and sour notes that seemed a bit more muted in the 2012. It's one of those brews that's worth the investment for any beer geek out there, if for no other reason than to say that you've had it. A co-worker of mine still had one from 2008 and we tried some of that recently. The more vibrant notes in fresher batches mellowed out, giving way to more robust bourbon and port notes. Overall a fantastic brew."
""
""
"This isn't a regular beer.  I wouldn't want this if I were in the mood for a beer. But if I wanted spirits, and decided to crack this open instead for a special occasion?  This is deeper and more complex than any whiskey or bourbon I've had straight, and could easily meet your needs for that kind of a drink. Despite the price tag, I can now easily see myself buying one of these to crack open on special occasions, or even for a special nip before bed."

"Overall: I had huge expectations for this but felt a but let down. I think its a bit too far over the line to a spirit and lacks what I truly like about beer. Overall still a cool thing to share with a friend and a good experience, especially with an old triple bock next to it."

"There's nothing like it. Is it worth it? Who can say? It's a unique masterpiece. I'll probably never buy another one but I'm glad I did it once."

"Massive Utopias vertical with the gang last weekend. Followed by Millennium - MMM! I cant read my notes only remember what vintages stood out. 2013 with the little window in the bottle was actually my favorite, I expected to like the older ones more. 2005 and 2009 are marked as the next best. Of course none of them held a candle to Millennium, the whole group agreed with that. Flavors were all big sweet malt, toffee, lots of warm vanilla, old tawny port.The 2013 or whatever the most recent bottle was had more developed rich flavors and not as cloying on the tongue. A good experience."

"Overall. An experience. Yep. Probably not as good an experience as a $200 meal, but I will enjoy this many times over the coming months so that's how I'll look at this one. Not sure if I'd buy this one again but by the time this bottle is gone I'm sure I'll know. 4's across the board for a rating because it's very interesting, quite enjoyable, but in a league of it's own in every way."

"I'd try this again if I knew it had been aged for a few years. I think the sweetness would really be tempered, which would allow some of the flavors to come to the forefront of the beer. You know there has to be something pretty wicked about this beer because of its price and rarity - I just didn't get it when I tried it."
""
""
""
"It tastes... kinda like if you could make cognac out of beer. Fruit cognac amplifies and embitters the fruit, producing a hyperevolved and lightly burny version of, say, orange juice, where the sweetness hasn't gone away so much as it's lapped itself. So take the sweeter pale malt nodes favored by Sam Adams and then amplify them so much they retain only their barest essence. And the somehow, remarkably, make it pleasurable to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the whole I've really enjoyed trying this beer. It is totally pushing the envelope of what beer can be. I don't think that beer culture is there yet, but maybe this is where it is going."
""
"Very complex layers of flavor and aromas and I love the craftsmanship that went into developing this beer and also the story, there is no better. The only minor negative for me is that it is syrupy and thick not like traditional beer at all. I do get that this is stretching the definition of what beer is and I like that spirit but I kinda like beer where it is. This is the port wine version of beer and deserves it's own category and that is what Sam Adams has created here, a new category of beer."
""
""
""
""
"I've had this one a few times, from a few different vintages - I suppose I'm lucky. Aroma is quite bready, with malty notes and some nice spiciness. Also notes of brandy and yeast on the nose, maybe even champagne. Flavor is similar but less boozy than the nose - surprisingly easy to drink, especially considering the ABV, but definitely a strange brew. Very interesting."

"A whole lot of acclimatization is required to actually get into this one at first - but once you're past that initial palate gang-bang, the teetering balance of malt, bourbon, port, rum, funk, maple, sugar, and hops starts to make more and more sense, and that's only due in small part to the 54-proof alcohol.  Utopias is one of the few end-points of beer fandom, and is almost worthy of its sticker price (I'd say shelf tag, but, heh, it never actually made it there, around here). My only real beef here, is that I can only make an educated guess as to how much I have left in the 'bottle' - I'm thinking at least 16oz, as this kind of thing surely engenders more writing than imbibing, eh?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Finally tried it. It's like no other beer I've tried. Clearly worth a sample but I would never even think to toss out so much coin for a whole bottle of this."

"O: Overall good, although less than amazing. Pretty smooth considering the abv. Tasty but not necessarily outstanding, however an awesome experience to share with beer buddies."
"This one is a real treat if you like big boozers and you can find it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Been wanting to try this but at that price point you could land a world class bourbon alone, so very hesitant. Shared a pour from someone - very good but not worth it."

"O: Well worth the experience and splitting a bottle or slow sipping one is worth the price tag, especially at ABV of around 29 and the age and blend that make up this beauty."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- 2012 >> 2013 which smelled/tasted a lot like the Chinese sorghum whiskey that my dad likes to drink that is incredibly disgusting and makes me nauseous. The 2012 version is so decadent, sweet and boozy; it is definitely the superior vintage of the 2. So if you find a 2012 and want to buy it, go for it. Can't give that same affirmation for the 2013."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This ale totally surprised me in how smooth it was compared to the abv. I could drink a much bigger pour. This was really good and the price is very hefty, but certainly worth a try and dare I say, I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Few beers match the over-the-top descriptors used on their bottles, but this one does. Extremely complex."

"Overall: Well I'm definitely sticking to beer and not liquor, but for a hybrid between the two this was quite good. I doubt I'll buy full bottles of it very often before I win the lottery, but it is very nice to have every now and then."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is sticky honey, rich sherry sweetness with red wine tannins, some molasses and dense malts. Balanced with a bit of heat. A great sipper, similar to how I'd expect to enjoy a fine port or cognac, though I am embarassingly uneducated in those elixirs."

"the good people at boston beer brought five gallons of this to big beers in vail this weekend, and i have to thank them, because i would never be able to afford to try this one of a kind brew any other way. with much anticipation my glass is filled with a hazelnut colored liquid that shines mellow bronze on the edges and has essentially no head. the nose is hotly alcoholic, i smell it long before it even gets to my nose, very intense. but i also smell rich malted barley, the start of homemade caramel is white sugar just sweats in the pan, and a woody vanill vibe that reminds me of a good bourbon. the taste is more like a cognac than a bourbon or a beer through, and thats what i notice the most. its not nearly as sweet as it smells either, but has some necessary residual sugar to soften the alcohol burn. it almost feels distilled instead of brewed. i get a ton of wood on the finish, like a combination of countless barrels. its a little bit of everything rolled into one, but it somehow, to me at least, makes beautiful beer. i know others have been critical of the lack of carbonation, massive still body, and the price tag on this beer, which is certainly not for everyone, but i found it positively delightful. would i buy it? maybe. but i am overjoyed that i got to sample this, and honestly, a sample is all you really need with this strength and intensity of flavors. this proves that sam adams still makes some of the most far out beer in the world, even if the flagship brands are super safe."

"O-An absolutely amazing beer. So glad I was able to try this. It is worth seeking out to try."
"I am thoroughly impressed. beyond any expectations. an entirely different experience in taste, and I have been doing some serious research in beer this last year or so. got a bottle of Elijah Craig 12 waiting to drown out the expected yukkiness, but honestly I think it may be the other way around... this truly is nectar. I have to give this one all 5s and it is NOT due to the price. this is truly an elixir to be experienced..."

"3oz pour. Pours deep clear brown with no head . Smells is absolutely amazing, I get a lot of the barrel , dark fruit, cherries , port, Carmel, chcolate, slightly smoky. Taste is sweet up front, coniac flavors, dark fruit again, oak, perfect sweetness, chocolate and Carmel flavors like the nose. This beer is amazing and im so glad I got to try it , the sweetness is spot on, heavy oak flavors, nice plum, cherry, and other dark fruits. Texture is thinner than you'd think in a really good way, no burn either.This is on another level and it's so unique."

"O: Forget the 'beer' moniker. This is an exceptional beverage under any category. People complain about the price, but when you normalize the cost per ABV and volume, buying this beer for $200 at 24oz is like spending $270 for a 750ml of fine cognac. Thats not a bad price to spend for an exceptionally blended mixture of 1 to 20 year old aged tinctures."

"Tasted on multiple occasions, poured from the tap at the GABF. Can't say I agree with the general public on this one. The taste was extremely sweet, nearing that of cough syrup. The alcohol percentage was difficult to hide with significant alcohol burn. Mouthfeel was nice and rich. However, overall, this isn't one I would want to try again. Nice try Sam Adams"

"O - My mind is blown every time that I try this very special brew. I love to sit and watch the amber elixir slowly tear down the walls of the glass. Not what I think of when I hear the word 'beer,' but that's part of the mystique surrounding the Utopias."
""
""
"Overall: Glad I bought this one, however I really don't care for it. Yes I gave it all ""5s", but I respect this beer. The complexity and the work put into it deserve full credit. It is truly one of the most unique brews I have ever tasted. It drinks like a cross between a fine wine and good whiskey. I would recommend that everyone try this at least once to say they did."

"Angelo generously shared his $145 bottle with some of his friends down at MBBC. What a fantastic treat! This hophead was overwhelmed. Every once in a while, I'll go for a Dogfish 120, but Utopias is way beyond that. What a fantastic brew -- one of the best ever! But at such a cost. Not worth it to me. That's a flaw in the Beer Advocate rating system. Obviously it should factor in the cost, but it doesn't. Yeah, I'd like to drink this every day, but not if I had to pay for it!"

"O - This is something that must certainly be savored at a slow pace & in good company. I know this beer is a substantial financial investment; however, it can be opened with a friend at several occasions and re-sealed without a worry. Truly a unique experience, and one that is worth the price in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is awesome! Extremely flavorful, extremely complex, and extremely fantastic. Utopias will now be placed on a metaphorical shelf of honor next to my best scotches, Armagnac, Cognac, and Spanish Brandies!"

"I really enjoyed this one! I don't typically drink an American Strong Ale, but couldn't resist the opportunity to try Utopias. Surprisingly smooth, like a good Cognac. This would be fantastic on the front porch on a cool night with a fine cigar...which is how I intend on enjoying this if and when I ever get another opportunity!"

"Highly recommended for a group tasting."

"If you like madeira, port, or sherry, you need to buy a bottle once in your life. You won't regret it!"
"The beer - really more like a lovely sweet bourbon - was intense yet delicate, sweet yet subtle. At near 30% I was pretty silly by the end of my generous portion. Every sip was delicious and different! Mostly what I remember is a milk-chocolate, maple syrup sweetness. Rare to try, but if you ever have the chance, I highly recommend it!"

"The beer pours no head and leaves no lacing except for traces of alcohol. The beer itself is a lovely brownish red that is see through. The beer has a very strong maple syrup smell that mixes with hints of oak barrel and vanilla. Other notes that make a strong appearance is toffee with a bit of the alcohol smell as well as tiny notes of cherry. The smell is interesting in that the smells are, at best, balance and, at worst,, complementing each other very well. The taste is strong and sweet with maple syrup dominating the tongue. The beer has a cherry flavor and very noticeable funk from their KMF line. The taste also has hints of vanilla as well as bits of alcohol. The 2013 edition definitely has a tartier taste than the 2012 edition. The aftertaste is very sweet and sugary. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth bordering on slick but with body. No carbonation but definitely heavy. The beer has a tiny bit of alcohol burn at the beginning but goes out towards the end. Overall, a fantastic beer and one that I will continue to look out for every year."

"M - Full bodied. Thick and viscous. Next to no carbonation but that doesn't detract from thsi beer at all; in fact it is complimentary."

"Holy cr@p this ""Strong Ale"" kicked my arse. I bought a 2007 from my local bottle shop and I've yet to drink it. The owner of the bottle shop mentioned that a place down the street was serving it in a shot glass for $15.00 per sniffer. We made or way down to the bar and had a chance to taste it and, fheew, this beer was strong, maple syrupy and really well balanced for a 29% beer."

"0- This was my first time having the legendary Utopia and after hearing some grave reviews I was pleasantly surprised. I am a huge port fan so this was a nice treat for me. I definitely enjoyed this beer. Would I pay $200 for my own bottle? Probably not. But an ounce an a half was enough for me to experience something great and finally know what it tasted like."

"I purposely avoided using the word beer in the previous sentence as I think Utopias holds equally much in common with spirits such as bourbon and cognac as it does with other beers."

"Make no mistake about it, though, Utopias is damn good. I think it comes as no surprise that it's definitely a ""sipper", and it's a highly enjoyable and tasty one at that. Is it worth the price tag? Hard to say. Is anything worth that much money? Depends on how much you want it, I guess. I'll tell you this - it makes for a great experience and a great time when shared among friends. A nice conversation piece in itself, and enjoyable for beer geeks of all types. Big thanks again to Jeff for letting me take a taste."

"Overall: I can safely say I’ve never had “beer” like this before. It definitely comes across more like a cordial than beer, and drinking it would follow suit. It’s meant to be enjoyed at room temperature and in small, savory sips. This batch has very complex flavors. I’ve read that oxidation is part of the appeal of this beer; in other words you open the bottle, screw the cap back on when done and leave it be (like most liquors). Since I can’t personally speak to how this may taste a year from now, I would risk a guess that it will be as equally tasty as it is from a recently opened bottle. If given the chance to try it (or any of the previous batches) you’ll definitely want to add it to your “tried beers” list."

"As with others I had trouble rating this beer as it is a wholly unique beverage. I was extremely glad to have gotten a chance to try it. Would I shell out the funds for another, tough call. Would definitely go in on a bottle with friends."
"Was treated to a sample today at Three Bling Monks in Garfield, NJ. In a single word ... ""delicious""...and thanks to Brian for the sample. I would say though that to call this a beer is almost a misnomer as the taste is really more like a liquor or brandy. Tasty for sure, but difficult to call it a beer. The rating system for this is difficult cause I don't feel like I'm rating a beer."

"Aromas are sticky sweet, big raisin and prune, nutty sweet tawny port. Flavors are largely the same, flavors linger long into the finish. Seems like any number of aged strong ales... Hardy's, JW Lees, etc, albeit with a nitro boost of alcohol. What mars the experience to me is the jarring astringent bite from the alcohol, which is more akin to sipping a whiskey neat. The complexity and flavors are there, it's just not as easy to sip as it could be, maybe 27% has something to do with it. Again, my personal preference is for beer and/or whiskey, not a hybrid, though this is an exceptionally unique product."

"From notes, 7/28/11. Tried 2011 and 2007 versions. Vanilla, sherry, caramel, toffee and some booze make up the aroma. There are also notes of raisins, grapes and brandy. Lots of molasses. It’s complex and layered. Tons of barrel flavor. Very smooth feel. Little booze in the taste. Deep amber color and still. The ’11 had a better aroma and the ’07 the better taste, but they were fairly similar and it could have been bottle variation. Taste is fairly sweet but lots going on. Big molasses, fruit, bourbon and other spirits, oak, treacle, caramel. Very tasty."

"The smell of this beer is extraordinary. Cognac, bourbon, vanilla, .... This is the only beer I have ever tried that I could sit and sip all night. I was able to sample a few ounces as part of a split with friends. The beer pours deep brown/black, with no head. It leaves a nice oil slick in the mouth, which allows you to savor the flavor. There is no hint of beer in the flavor, as it tastes like a very smooth cognac. If you asked 1000 people (non beer geeks) to taste it, I doubt anyone would say it was a beer. It is certainly worth it to split the cost with some friends, but I can buy a few great bottles of single malt scotch and a bottle of Bourbon for less money."

"O - An excellent experience trying this, it is a very complex brew. The various barrels work really well together, presenting an up front flavor which is more like a fine spirit than a beer. The finish, however, is pure malty delciousness, reminding you that you are drinking a beer. I very much recommend seeking out a pour, but be warned - the server at ChurchKey said it lasts 3-4 weeks after opening before succumbing to noticeable oxidation, so purchasing a whole bottle is probably not a good idea unless you have several friends to share it with."

"O: Overall analysis, a very good complexity that shows through even in limited volume. Would love to get a longer appreciation for this, but i guess thats what the multiple servings are for. To be consumed like a fine, very expensive wine, with each sip being gentle, small, with a long drawn out swallow. Very savoring. This is a once in a lifetime purchase for me. At $300 a bottle was it worth it? only for self satisfactor sake. The bottle is quite the appeal and makes for a good show piece. Best split with friends or experienced by the glass at an establishment if you want to experience this first hand. 27% abv was not as boozy as one would think, ive had beers 10% that seemed more potent then this, just take it easy with small mangable sips, to much and that 27% will smack some sense into you."

"O: This is the pinnacle of sipping beers. Sweet, complex and warming. This is a beer I will savor for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: glad i tried this one but not wanting it again. even more boozy than the 29% or whatever it is would suggest. the sweetness I think is what makes it a little too unbareable."
"D - Drinkable in the traditional sense is not something nth at applies to a beer like this. The aroma is spectacular, the flavor is excellent also, but with a sweetness that is still slightly excessive. Oddly pleasant for such an over the top drink."
""
""
"Overall this is a wonderful ""Ale"". I see it more of a brandy, something to sip on among fiends, but very much worth the experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This absolutely lived up to the hype and I can't wait to see what happens to it over the years. If you've been thinking about dropping the amount of money it costs to taste this, don't wait any longer. 4.5"
"Great for what it is. The nose is a little simple, likewise the mouth feel. I would just as well have had a good dark brandy or cognac. That being said it is one off my bucket list and amazing for a beer the achieve this level of smooth complexity and malty depth, thoroughly enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear brown with no head. Legs of beer form on the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, sherry, and port. Taste is much the same with some wood and maple flavors as well. There is an alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. This beer has no carbonation but there is a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely strong and extremely rich but super tasty."
"O - Ive had the 09 and think 11 goes crazy over the top of it. The 09 had to many sherry vinous flavors to it where the 11 has that rich malted palate that lets you know its a beer. Much better than expected and will be aging for a while. Can only imagine what this could turn into. Perfect in my book. Not much room for improvement at this high of an ABV."
"Being that I am also a wine lover, the best way for me to describe the 10th Anniversary Utopias is as a bad Port wine. It smells and looks similar to a port with dark brown cognac like features and tastes like one, unfortunately a bad one. Very heated in the mouth and all sorts of flavors but they are subdued by the bad alcohol taste. I had the 2009 earlier this year and it was much better thn the 10th Anniv. IMO you are much better off buying a $30 Warres Port if you are looking for this taste. I was very much looking forward to this one with all the hype it had around and since I very much liked the 2009 but this one was just a diasppoinment unfortunately."

"Some friends all chipped in to buy a bottle to drink at our company Xmas party. We poured the entire bottle into 14 small tasting glasses. Dark brown body. No carbonation; totally still. Smell was ripe with rum barrels and booze. Taste was intense and powerful. Rum, port, caramel, raisins, toffee, sugar cane all came to mind. Mouthfeel was silky smooth and luscious like a nice cognac. This ""beer"" really stretched the definition of what beer is, even even though it was high priced, it was worth it. I though that this was better than some top shelf rums or bourbons I've ordered before."

"O: This is more an aperitif than a beer. You probably will not want to drink it after coming home from work or otherwise have too much of it. In many respects, as just about everybody knows ... its more a distilled spirit than a beer."
"O: Some say it is not worth the price, but I can say that I bought two bottles. One to keep, and one to trade. Now, I can honestly say that I am keeping all $400.00 worth of this stuff and will save it for years to come to sip in celebration, and with friends."
"Overall: Even with all the 5.0 scores above, I still must give Utopias 2012 an Overall Score of only 3.5 because of its price. It was probably worth this one-shot group purchase, just to see what all the fuss is about. But if Jim Koch wants me to buy future editions, it’d need to be priced closer to $50 retail. Its production economics probably wouldn’t cooperate with that price point, though. Oh, well. I can still buy plenty of super-tasty other beers with what a single bottle of Utopias costs."
""
"O - Very delicious. But not worth the cost, effort or hype. This ceases to be a beer to me. I've had dessert wines that have had almost the exact same taste."

"Overall, it's more than a beer. It's an experience for sure. Is it worth the price? I would say if its divided up among several people it is. Definitely something to try once in your life. Personally loved having it."

"Small sample thanks to scotchzi. Pours a flat, clear, reddish amber with big legs dripping with a swirl. Nose is ultra starchy and rice wine like specifically huangjiu or yellow alcohol, Chinese rice wine. It’s tough to describe but heavy red bean starch, sweet toffee, not as much smoke and rice character as huangjiu and more savory soy and saltwater. As it opens up/decants you are rewarded with cinnamon and amaretto. Still, enormous umami character like porcini mushroom and beef bouillon. Interesting combo. Taste is sour lemon up front with mild alcohol heat ending with big starchiness and more lemon. Mild oxidized character. Interesting. Alcohol heat is not an issue. Palate seems decently viscous. Hard to compare to other barleywines as this is more like brandy and rice wine blended. I’m very grateful for the sample, but I think it is safe to say I would not spend $100 on a bottle...though you get to savor this over a long period like Scotch so maybe it is worth it."
""
"Pours a mahogany caramel color with no head. The nose is almost like amaretto and brandy together. Chocolate covered cherries, almonds, maple, pecans, definite booze heat (obviously), caramel, molasses and some slight red grape notes. The taste is very sweet. Maple, almond, oak, cherry, chocolate, booze, pecans, caramel and molasses. It is syrupy, sticky, sweet, very hot. It is definitely a lot different than a beer. It kind of deserves its own classification. It is fermented like beer but it is like drinking a liquor like cognac or brandy. I love it but I don't know if I can call it a favorite beer. Maybe my favorite liqueur..."

"Hard to call it a beer, but this is great stuff. I've been sipping on this bottle for 2 years and it hasn't lost a thing. A great beer to try if you're willing to shell out the dollars."
"O- Really a crazy beer. Flavors are ridiculous and it's different than anything I have ever tried. Try it if you can."

"O: This is a very good drink, though it's not exactly beer in the classical sense of the word. Sure, it's technically beer, but this one is more in line with a sherry or a port than a beer.

"This one doesnt even deserve the typical way I do reviews, nor does even remotely deserve to be on the top 100 for even a second. I commend SA for doing what they did with this. But overall its a syrupy mess. Heavy fruit and syrupy malt on the nose and same in the flavor. It actually starts off like it might taste good, then takes a dive. I mean its not bad, its just not that good. The mouth is exactly what you'd expect, flat syrup. Shame on you guys for rating this as an exceptional ""Beer"""

"Notes: What a treat… This really reminds me of Spanish brandies and other local blends like quinas. They were in the mix of barrels for this 2011 edition, and they do shine beautifully. Memories of a Cardenal Mendoza, so this is something that may appeal to anyone keen on that sweet complex brandy range, it has some of that Carlos I and Duque de Alba range but the final sweet complexity puts it closer to Cardenal Mendoza than anything else I've ever tasted. If one can afford it, at the suggested retail prize, this is a delight to have and share with people either intrigued by the limits of beer, or this complex Brandy, Cognac, solera blends… Pushing the price at the retail point I guess might develop part of the legend but hurts the accessibility to something that is already pretty pricey. At this price range, if I can afford it then, I'd love to have access to a bottle of the next vintage… in 2013? Thanks Luke, and Manning for making this possible."

"Big huge thanks to etan for cracking this open. Dark brown with highlights of Ruby. Nice legs. Aroma is very raisin brandy rum plum prune and a lot of vanilla brown sugar burnt sugar and molasses. Some honey as well. Extremely complex aroma with so much stuff going on. Flavor was really sweet but not unpleasantly so. Lots of raisin and brandy with a nice heat from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is sticky and viscous, almost like a liquor. I really don't know what to make of this ""beer"". Its really enjoyable but I don't know how to think about it."

"Reddish brown colour, without any head. Huge legs. Nose has a big layer of alcohol over everything, butterscotch, brandy, cognac is quite prominent, caramel, toffee, oak - too complex to accurately describe, held my nose to this for ages before digging in. Incredible. Again a layer of alcohol veils everything just a bit on the palate, but tofee, nuts, oak, butterscotch, brandy, cognac, brown sugar and some sweet chocolate. Sweet and extremely 'desserty' - dense body with a lingering flavour. Thick, alcoholic but a great warmth in the finish. The smoothness at which the alcohol is applied is fantastic. A spectacular offering, and unlike any 'beer' I've ever had before. Certainly something I could smell all day."

"Obviously, Utopias is not your average beer and is hard to rate on the same scale as the others I have reviewed on this site. As I alluded to earlier, this is a sipper of a beer that is certainly meant to be enjoyed like a fine brandy or scotch. I also enjoyed mine with my awesome beer nerd friends (TChopcraver, TCGoalie & Buckyfresh) which is something that I also recommend if you are able to track down a bottle of this. Ultimately, I found this beer to be quite tasty and if money were not a concern I would probably try to buy it every time it came out and pop one open for a special occasion."

"Pours a cloudy dark brow-mahogany with no head. The initial aroma that I detect is nutty, pecans, with vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins, some port like qualities, and a touch of alcohol. The taste has amazingly very little alcohol perception! Dark fruit and port qualities dominate the flavor, figs, plums, raisins, oak, bourbon and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is very syrupy and viscous with no carbonation and a sweet lingering finish. Overall this is an exceptional beer and I’m very glad that I finally got to try it."

"O - Incredible. If this beer isn't perfect, then nothing is. If you can appreciate a barrel-aged beer, take that times infinity and you have Utopias. Kind of pricey but I can totally understand why. Save this for special occasions, and you won't be disappointed."

"Bottom line, this beer is absolutely fantastic and worth seeking out. Birth a child to trade for a bottle. Mortgage your grandmother. Or just chip in ~$30 with six of your best friends and split a bottle. Utopias is no bargain, but it's easily one of the best beers on the planet. And certainly the most unique."
"O: Fantastically interesting. Almost certainly not worth the money, but what a bottle and what a 'beer'. I highly recommend you try some."
"Pours a clear ruby brown with no head, obviously. The aroma on this puppy can be smelled from a mile away. The aroma is a ton of dark fruit from the start - a huge dose of prunes and raisins. There is a caramelly sweetness that reminds of candied raisins and the malt is laughing and dancing in the background. One can also find sour cherries and a huge alcohol burn. This tastes like a million things. The flaovr is extremely sweet up front like glazed prunes and cherries mixed with fresh caramel and cream with a dash of vanilla. The malt is also quite present, adding layers of flavor and even roast and a dash of coffee if you really search. The mouthfeel is really unique - creamy and thick, coating the mouth, along with a burn from the alcohol, but you don’t taste so much as feel it. This is awesome stuff!"

"O: I mean, it's a $200 bottle of beer. Can I tell you to buy this with a straight face? Hell yes I can. It's worth it. Team up with your buddies, split it 10 ways, I don't care what you do. Just make sure you get your hands on a 2 oz. pour of Utopias while you are still a beer fanatic. It is unlike anything I have ever had before. It truly is a port, but man is it lip-smackingly tasty. It definitely drinks boozy, but somehow maintains a pleasantness and smoothness that is unbelievable. If you have the budget, grab this one. Sort out the details later, up to and including charging your bestest buds $20 a pop for their pours."

"A generous pour yields a cognac like liquid, still and a brownish/copper/amber color. Aromas of Madeira wine, brandy, butterscotch, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, alcohol, vague fruits. A complex nose that boasts a lot of character. In the taste, concentrated Munich malts, chocolates, vanilla, dry oak, generic fruits, bourbon, sherry, brown sugar, alcohol, toffee, maple, candy, and butterscotch. Mouth-feel is slick, chewy, right around medium bodied but no carbonation. Like a fine liquor. Overall, Utopias is a beast of a beer, and pushes the boundaries of what beer really is and can be. I recommend trying this, but a whole bottle would last me a long long time. Boston Beer Company can consider this one a success and a brew worthy of a great celebration. I say force carbonate this and see what happens."

"Overall: When a beer can be opened and still stored for weeks (or months), the line between beer and liquor has justifiably become blurred. There is just an incredible amount of complexity involved with this beer that makes it very difficult to judge. Did I really enjoy it? Yes, it was amazing. Could I drink more than 4 oz.? That would be tough. Do I regularly want to pay $165 for a bottle of it? Probably not. Scoring this beer is difficult."

"Pours a transparent copper brown color with no head. The nose has a fair bit of whiskey up front, notes of roasted barrel and some untertones of vanilla, sweet caramel and an earthy root type aroma. The taste is similar, sweet caramel, root beer, a piney syrup, earthy and root like with some notes of chocolate. Strong whiskey/bourbon notes, lots of heats with a fair bit of sugar left over. Syrupy feel, chewy and viscous, well carbonated and a touch of driness in the finish. Lots going on, spirit like, a touch all over the place."

"great taste, but i wasnt too crazy about the aroma, way too hot. still, to me this kind of takes away the whole beer drinking expierence at 27%. id love to drink this again, but thats not going to happen with the insane pricetag. an amazing beer non the less, but id prolly take a matt, deliverence, or black tuesday over this. the same big sweet flavors with minimal booze. still...cheers to sam adams for this insane offering!"

"Overall, I am glad I was able to sample this beer. It is excellent as a novelty beer, but is is really not beer at this ABV in my opinion. More like an aperitif or a desert wine. Too sweet and boost overall to be enjoyed often or even a few times a year to be honest and boost overall. Recommended definitely tontry once in your beer lifetime and to say that you tried it, but not something I need to revisit anytime soon."

"The beer is dark walnut brown hued with ruby highlights. No head or lace. The aroma brings oak, booze, brandy...smells intense. Whoa, what a flavor! Thick and syrupy, yet ridiculously smooth. Palate coating. Alcohol masterfully hidden. Brandy, toffee, booze, oak, port, scotch, smoke. Just terrific. A great choice for an after dinner sipping beer. Would love to have some of this in the cellar. Ideal for a nightcap on special occasions."

"One of a kind. Stunning. Complex, balanced, challenging, and yet very personable. Highly recommended."
"Glowing, bronze/copper color with zero carbonation and lots of 'legs'. There is so much going on in the nose, smells so much like cognac with lots of vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee with hints of maple. The balance that is obtained in this beer even with the ABV and the amount of blending and aging is just fantastic. The tiniest of tiny sips explodes on the tongue with so much flavor. This beer is nothing short of spectacular. The smell and taste completely take over your senses. I was lucky to get a sizable portion for sampling. One of the most creative concoction, something every beer aficionado must have at least once in their lifetime."
"GABF 2011 Aroma is that of caramel, toffee, slight alcohol. Appearance is a beautiful amber with heavy legs, no head.Taste was amazing... like a very delicious maple syrup- cognac like taste. Palate was warming and smooth, perfect sweetness/ alcohol balance. Overall an amazing beer, something I was lucky enough to try. I don’t know if I would ever buy one (with the amazing price tag) but its definitely something special."
"Overall – A very unique and delicious after dinner beer that was enjoyed with good company. I can’t wait to have this again come Thanksgiving and Christmas time. My brother-in-law thought this was absolutely incredible and is also looking forward to visiting this again with a bit more age on it. While one could taste the alcohol, obviously, it was less prominent than one would have expected. A sipper for the ages."
"O: Spectacular. Not much else to say here. Awesome flavors. Strong booze doesn't get in the way of the flavors either. This beer absolutely has lived up to the hype and everything that precedes it. Very happy to get a shot to try this, and I will enjoy the bottle for quite a while."
"Overall: Super complex and good. Such a unique beer. I feel like I picked up a new taste every time I took a sip. Definitely will have again."
"This is a fantastic, style-busting beer. I feel very privileged to have tried it...However, at $160/bottle (2011), I am not sure I would ever really want a bottle for myself. The beer is hot and is a great sipper, but it really reminds me of a bottle of Lost Abbey Deliverance, but stronger. Not to detract from the quality of the beer, but I really feel like the price-to-enjoyment ratio just does not pan out on this one for me personally. Good shit though."
"Overall, this was well worth the wait. I love it and am glad that I bought a bottle. I plan to enjoy it slowly over time with friends and for occasions."
"A modern marvel that's quite tasty in its own right. I'm not sure I'll go rushing out to buy a $150 bottle any time soon, but then again, I am tempted..."
"I won a 4 ounce sample of the 2011 vintage at a festival, best 10 bucks ever spent. Poured into a tasting glass, dark brown headless pour. The aroma is amazing, oak, vanilla, bourbon, hot booze. The taste is as amazing as the aroma, finishes with lingering caramel and vanilla. The beer is smooth and sticky, no carbonation actually makes it smoother. The beer exceeded what I was expecting, my first 5, I definitely will be looking for more."
"D/O: At first encounter this beer exhibits a convulsion-inducing quality that reminds of the way that an actor takes a stiff drink. Its early flavors overwhelm the senses while remaining true to the smell. It is able to lift the bourbon and other spirits from the wood successfully, yet their presence is short-lived. The latter two acts are surprisingly vacant--not by the standards of normal beer, but in this case compared to the beginning. Utopias may be the poster-child of extreme beer in America, possibly in need of a new style that is the plank-owner of."
"Overall, this outrageous Strong Ale represents a huge achievement in craft brewing. Prior to tasting, I didn't know if I'd enjoy it since I'm not a big fan of hard liquor. However, it defied my expectations with its smooth, bold flavours and enormous depth of character. A boundary-pushing ASA that further expands the notion of what beer can be."
"Absolutely a magnificent example of how far beer can go. Worth $150+? Maybe or maybe not, at least the bottle will last a long time as a night cap beer."
"O - I was a bit apprehensive about the overall experience with this one, based on ABV, but Utopias is surprisingly drinkable."
"O- This, as expected, was a very different beer. Incredibly rich with an interesting alcohol bite that would intrigue those who enjoy sipping on bourbon. Seeing the high price on this beer gives me the lingering suspicion that I have tried it for both the first and last time. What a foreboding feeling."
"Overall, very good, but not what I expected with the hype and price. I have a feeling it will be amazing in time!"
"Overall: Amazing beer overall. I am so glad that I shelled out $15 for a 2 ounce pour. This would rate as as good a whiskey/cognac as I've ever had. Phenomenal. If you have the chance, try it."
"Overall i was not let down at all. been waiting a while to try this beer. At 27%, if i had a bottle it would take a long while to get through it, the sheer cost would also be a consideration."
"Nice sipper. One you truly have an ounce or two at a time. Very interesting beer and worth trying if you can get your hands on some."
"Deep, deep mahogany broze color. Huge aroma of vanilla, caramel and maple syrup-it comes at you from even down on the counter in the glass. Lightly oaked. Just a gamut of flavors-huge caramel/maple flavors. Vanilla and oak. Trace of booziness. Serious malty quality going on. Decent mouthfeel-very sticky and gummy-has to be from residual sugars but still nice. Just a great experience all in. Obviously a sipper-small doses and special occassions are just the thing."
"This was enjoyable especially since I didn’t pay for the bottle. It barely resembles beer. This is much more like an after dinner drink. I like it, but I'm sure it's not for everyone."
"O: Exceeds expectations. I have had Tactical Nuclear Penguin and did not like it. This takes everything wrong with it and makes it right. Great flavors paired with good alcoholic heat. Glad I had the chance to try this."
"2007 vintage. Pours a dark amber with obviously no head, but it does leave some serious legs on the glass as it is swirled. Huge aroma with big molasses, some brown sugar, a significant amount of booze (unsurprisingly), brandy, and vanilla. Taste is pretty sweet, but not cloying. The molasses and brown sugar are present. Brandy and vanilla comes through as well. A little bit of maple. The alcohol is certainly present, but surprisingly restrained given the ABV and the amount present on the nose. Full bodied. No carbonation. Drinks similar to something like a cognac, but the beer qualities are certainly there. Unique and enjoyable. I'm glad to have tried it."
"Sam Adams Utopias was the longest one ounce of beer I've ever drank. It was certainly the most expensive and probably the most impressive too. I wanted to take the glass home with me just to keep smelling it - good thing I couldn't, I bet weeks later my girlfriend would be pleading with me to finally wash the thing. And I still wouldn't want to. Drinking Utopias after awhile you sort of get lost in another world... and you don't want to leave it."
"Notes: Had a 1 - 1.5 oz snifter at The Sanctuary in Iowa City. Very nice beer to sip on with amazing flavors and a nice warming feel. Alcohol was surprisingly well hidden. I loved how the barrels affected this beer; they really helped make this an excellent sipper."
"Impressive, complex. It's a malt liqueur, and aged in everything. Tastes kind of like everything, but not a clash. Paired with Fritos Flavor Twists (Honey BBQ). It's a pedestrian pairing, but the sweetness and potency of the Utopias does pair pretty well with the MSG and sodium of the twists."
"Overall a hell of a 'beer' thats more like a sipping whiskey or port. Very cool, would love another 2oz of this in the future. Very interesting how they brewed this without icing, and you can tell because its far better than the 'iced' beers out there."
"D - Wow! What can I say, I love this stuff, absolutely worth the wait; great across the board; I really liked this beer; could have been a bit thicker, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it; I really can't get enough of the smell, my nose was pretty much shoved in the glass for a whole minute; great aromas and fantastic taste; great job SA! I want the bottle!!"
"2003 vintage, huge thanks to John for starting things off with this in the wee hours of the morning. It was dark so hard to see, but seemed like a deep dark murky brown or purple in the little light I had to work with. The smell was rich syrupy caramel. The taste followed the nose fairly sweet, but extremely drinkable. I only had a very small sample but this went down smooth and warmed me up immediately on a tiny sip as I battled the weather at that ungodly hour of the morning. A beer like this is unique and surprisingly together...the fact that you can drink it and reseal it and it will still last for years makes it really an anamoly, but it works."
"O: This is really a unique and special ""beer."" I put beer in quotes for the obvious reasons that it just isn't like any other beer. It lacks carbonation and that's weird to be drinking a beer that doesn't have carbonation but the overall complexity contained within that copper-kettle bottle is one of the biggest reasons to go find this beer."
"Massive thanks goes out to cmrillo who shared this one with the group at the ""Evening Wood"" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo as well! 2005 Vintage (OH SNAP!)! Bottle #8458! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured ruby red with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, alcohol (duh), and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, BIG alcohol (no shocker here), peat, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this brew was excellent. I'm really glad I finally got the opportunity to give this one a shot. I thought this was going to kill me on the alcohol, but Sam Adams did a fantastic job on making it as sweet as possible to cut back on the burn and overwhelming alcohol flavor you get in other high ABV brews. Really enjoyed getting the chance to try this one. This one only came out during the tasting for one of two reasons I think... Either A) Rillo was really drunk or B) I mentioned to him that I had never tried Utopias before. Either were possible at this point honestly. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I got the chance and I am seriously debating on buying a bottle for myself in the future based on this experience dispite the high price."
"Overall, this is an beer experience unlike any other I've had before. You NEED to try this 'beer' - if only just for one sip. The complexity of this blew me away. Its defines the term sipper. Unbelievably impressive creation. Cheers to Sam Adams!"
"Serving type: bottle into a taster."
"D/O: Great way to stretch the definition of beer yet again. Strong flavors that remind me of other liquors while still staying true to the traditional methods. Might not appeal to some but it's a great blend of flavors."
"This is not your regular beer and shouldn’t be consumed as such. Appreciate this for what it is instead of what you expect it to be and it’s rather incredulous. I’m not really sure if it’s worth the price, but it’s definitely incredulous. I’m just glad I was able to partake."
"Utopias was an odd choice for a sunny June evening in Boston, but then again it does sort of make the evening its own. I'll be curious to see how it pairs with a roaring fire in December."
"O: Hard to even call this a beer. It really is like a sipping after dinner drink. Loads of complexity. It was amazing."
"Overall it's a fun drink, but for the amount and price you have to pay I think I'll have to pass but I am very glad I tried it."
"O: There is no way in God's green earth I would ever pay over $250 a bottle for this stuff... but doesn't everyone say that? Still though, this was pretty damn good. I'm glad it exists for those willing to fork over the big dough, and thanks to harrymel for forking over the dough so I didn't have to."
"-GFunk"
"overall, it was a good enough experience, just much different than i had anticipated it would be; this beer surprised me."
"(O) I was expecting a crazy, boozy mess with this one. Something like a huge, high alcohol infused beer but it wasn’t anything of the sort. This is a fantastic beer."
"O: If it wasn't as expensive as it is, I would have a really hard time not downing this whole bottle. An amazing beer that I see myself getting every time it comes out. Easy to drink, great complex characteristics, and a special treat for the holidays."
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown in color with no head. In the aroma, caramel, maple syrup, hints of dark cherry and alcohol. In the taste, dark cherry sweetness, caramel and butterscotch, and don't forget about the alcohol burn. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry alcohol and caramel and dark cherry sweetness in the aftertaste. WOW! Big alcohol, like drinking a shot. Nice flavor but very boozy, I think 2oz is all anyone really needs."
"Overall: S glad I was able to try this....a bottle by itself might have been too much, especially here in Hawaii where the shipping cost is applied to almost everything. It's definitely a sipper. I think the real kicker is the bottle and the feeling of refinement that you get from drinking this ale. Although the taste did live up to the hype and I appreciate the concept, the idea of buying a bottle that is upward into the $160-$200 range seems to be overreaching."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. It is a very special thing and Sam Adams is a really cool to still be pushing the boundaries of beer. I will certainly buy more of these in the future and see how this beer continues to evolve over the future vintages."
"D. People say this is not like a beer, but it really is. It's like an amped up barrel aged beer. I got notes similar to Angel's Share Grand Cru, Raison D'Extra, 10 year old J.W. Lees, and CBS along with notes of cognac and rum. I've been looking forward to this beer for some time now. I'd love to try some other vintages, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. I'll just continue to enjoy this tasty treat a few ounces at a time."
"O - I think I'll make this a tradition and get a bottle of newer vintages when they come out. I've had this at a beer best before, but it was a really small amount and I guess I didn't fully appreciate it. To have a bit more of a serving is just wonderful to take in all the textures, flavors and aromas. This is great and I really enjoyed it. A true sipper though..."
"This beer pours a dark caramel color and is of course flat so it has no head or lacing, but some nice legs form as the liquid is swirled due to the high alcohol content. The nose is full vanilla, caramel and hot alcohol vapor. I also get notes of black figs and dates. The flavor has all of these flavors plus notes of red grapes, dark cherries, sweet brown sugar, woody oak, and maybe a hint of toffee, bread crust and other sweet sugary fruits. There is a nutty quality with flavors that remind me of ground walnuts. The finish is very sweet and it coasts my mouth in syrupy sugar. The body and mouthfeel are thick and heavy and not as hot as the nose suggests. I wish this beer was more affordable so I could drink it more often, but I can definitely taste the quality. I could drink this every night, and I'm afraid my bottle is starting to get low. My bottle shop still has more, I may have to splurge on another!"
"I want to love this beer. The effort and the time spend to create this, 18 year of barrel aging, 6 different barrels blended….I mean how amazing is that effort? The problem is this isn’t coming off as so dramatically different from beers I can get for 6-12 bucks a bottle. There is a flavor here that is in J W Lee that I want to describe, I think perhaps it is a result of the hops, but I just can’t describe it and I didn’t like it in J W Less, but here I’m finding myself more and more interested in it. At 40-50 bucks a bottle this would be outstanding beer, but 170 a bottle makes this simply an incredibly underwhelming experience. I really hate myself for taking this feeling, but beer has to be graded as beer, and frankly this isn’t beer by any normal measure. I’m not sure what color something like this should be or how to score the appearance as it has no comparison. I’m not sure how to score the mouth feel as this is only 27% but the alcohol kicks nearly as well as some smoother bourbons. I’m glad to have tried this, and I’ll enjoy the rest of this bottle. I do hope this ages well open as I can see some rather good changes to come in time."
"10 months later, and I was curious as to how this has held up, so I poured an ounce. tons of brown sugar and maple with less dark fruits. booze still present, as expected."
"O: Thoroughly unique, this is my second time having this and it's just as good. Expensive as all get out, but this is something every beer geek needs to try at least once."
"At $170-$200 a bottle in my area this certainly is not a common brew. It'd be a stretch to even consider this a once-a-year treat. Certainly its a special occasion sipper."
"O-its definitely tasty. each sip leaves you begging for more. i couldn't drink a whole glass of this though, not because of the alcohol but because of the sweetness. the ABV actually doesn't come in to play too much at all here. this just isn't something you'd drink if you want a good beer. this is more for a night recap when your favorite relatives are in town. this is definitely a must try for anyone though, whether you're a beer lover or not."
"Overall, I'm blown away. I'm putting this baby on the shelf and saving it for special occasions. I feel like I'll buy another one next time around because they apparently keep getting better from what I've heard. That being said, I feel spoiled having started with this edition. Cheers"
"Overall, this is barely a beer. It's got some beer traits, but it really pushes the boundaries of a beer. It's more of a beer/spirit hybrid. For as strong as it is, it's reasonably mellow. There is only a slight burn deep in the finish, but I've had worse from other beers. Overall, this is surprisingly smooth and I'm glad I picked up a bottle."
"2011 Edition poured into a port glass. Nice copper color with no visible head. Heavy appearance in the glass. The smell at first is a lot of alcohol but that passes any you get a wonderful raisin molasses combination. Very reminiscent of a LBV port. Heavy smooth liqueur type mouth feel. Taste is difficult to describe. First thing I notice is an unusual prickly carbonation feel on the tongue. Then raisins, nuts, maybe some sherry. Finished with molasses, wine and wood. Some nice bitterness too. Nothing else like it so it's not really comparable. Overall outstanding."
"Fantastic! I don’t know if I could call this a beer, it is more of a dessert wine than anything else. The aroma is the best I have ever felt from a beer, or from any beverage for that matter. On the tongue, raisins, dried fruits and all kinds of other sweet flavours mix together to give ou a sugar overdose only to be perfectly balanced by an easy alcoholic touch from the 28% ABV. Glourious amber colour in the glass with a pleasant body for the palate. Did I mention the perfect aroma?"
"Drink and overall: Glad I got to try it. Awesome product. Very unique idea, and I think they really have some thing great. I was very impressed with how non-spirit like it is. I'm a big bourbon guy, but the mouth is nothing of a distilled spirit. Fantastic."
"2009 bottle...Kevin, you still owe me $65 for this. Pours a somewhat hazy dark chestnut brown with ruby edges, no head or lacing. Nose is very pungent, heavy whiskey barrel, tends toward a spirit for sure. Lots of roasted marshmellow, heavily sugared, and hot. Stinging and really hot in the mouth. Caramel, sugar, earthy, Spicy, ""rooty"" per Kevin. Peppermint and root beer! Lots of roasted marshmallow, some maple syrup. Sort of difficult despite all the complexities."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with basically no head. The smell is sweet and boozy with hints of bourbon maple and vanilla. The flavor is very close the the aroma withe the sweet booziness up front followed by the bourbon and maple notes with a hint of vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick with low carbonation. Overall this beer was surpassingly drinkable for the abv but that is likely due to how sweet it is, which almost becomes cloying at times. Was nice to try but would likely never buy"
"Bought a bottle on this in November of 2009. Opened it in January of 2010. I've been having a few sips out of it over the last year or so just to see if there is any changes taking place of over time. The major change I've noticed is that the smell of maple is much stronger now than it was when it was new. The flavor is also along the same lines. The maple is really coming through now, it's almost like I should put it on pancakes or something. For a beer that's over 20% abv it's very smooth. There isn't much of an alcohol burn. This beer is just all around very impressive. I don't know if I'll ever buy it again but I'm proud that I got some when I did."
"d - Overall Utopias is a very nice beer from Sam Adams. Given the high ABV and the mouthfeel it is certainly a sipper and certainly something best consumed in 2 oz. samples. I thought it had a great, complex smell and would definitely like to have it again. Don't think I would pay $180-200 for a bottle, but if given the chance would love another 2 oz. sample of this."
"Maybe if this was called something else I would have been more receptive to the taste but to call it beer is sacrilege to me. Can you imagine calling something that was 20% wine? Wine makers and experts would label you an idiot. This should not be on this list imo, hence the very low marks."
"Would I buy another bottle if I had the chance, probably not, but not because it wasn't good. This is such a complex drink that to describe it as beer really doesn't do it any justice. I'm glad to have tried it and glad to be able to mark it off my bucket list and would encourage anyone who has the chance to do the same."
"Had a 1.5 ounce pour at Beer Bistro in Toronto. I think it was the 2009 version that came into Ontario. Comes out a clear amber-brown colour. There is no head or lacing, but it is supposed to be still so I can't fault the beer for that. I don't know how to judge appearance on this, it would be like judging appearing on congac... they all look basically the same to me. On the smell, alcohol first seems to be there, but then I get vanilla and strong caramel and maple. This reminds me a bit of the Remy Martin XO congac. Smooth mouthfeel, as you'd expect with no carbonation. A little bit boozy, but this was really delicious. Glad I got to try it."
"Pours just like a cognac, no head, dark reddish brown, lacing all over glass, thin yet syrupy, no crabonation. Smells of congac, stron alcohol, caramel, oak, vanilla notes, sweet and malty. Taste of Dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, and lots of maple syrup notes, cognac back into play. Dry finish with a heavy alcohol burn, very smooth and silky as it goes down which makes it more of a beer than a spirit to me. This is a very slow sipper. 4 ounces took me over an hour, but it was well worth it. Glad I saved this bottle, and still have another to save for many more years. Really is worth all of the hype (and the $150 a bottle!)."
"Pours a clear mahogany color with no head and no lacing. Smells of caramel, figs, and rum. Tastes of rum, figs, and tons and tons of caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and it has no carbonation. Drinkability is tough. It really is pretty good."
"D: A truly original and breathtaking offering by Sam Adams. this competes with many of the top-shelf single-malts, bourbons, and rums I have encountered when it comes to complexity and flavor balance. Definitely worth a try if you are lucky enough to come across a bottle."
"D - I made my small pour last an hour, so as to enjoy it as much as possible and let it warm in order to really appreciate it. Looking forward to trying out other years here and there in the future. Really, really, good. Recommend."
"cheers."
"Had this in Las Vegas from the Freakin' Frog brew pub thanks to my beer aficionado buddy who treated me with this brew on the night of my bachelor party. I thought this interesting brew was strong alcoholy-syrupy, almost brandy-like. Amber in color, like maple syrup. The flavor is like a brandy with maple and walnut. Very warming with an alcohol finish, also a bit of vanilla. It is uniquely complex; smooth and sticky mouth feel..."
"The CPJ"
"D - This is a sure sipper and is still a little hot. Rich, full, sweet and delicious, it is still quite enjoyable. I will definitely be on the lookout for the 2011 vintage this year."
"Pours brown and thick with reddish tints. No carbonation as expected. Very strong biosphere on the nose. Smells very much like cognac. Lots of fruity smells plum perhaps with caramel too. Complex and smells great. Tastes boozy but has a lot of oak and caramel and fruits. Overall, very drinkable for 27%. Great to try. Would never pay the price for it"
"It has a sweet, boozy smell and a wonderful scotch-brown color. This beer leaves long, great legs on a glass. What a wonderful treat to share with guests!"
"Overall, this is the best stuff that I have tried. I am going to have a hard time making my bottle last. It is a little pricey, it did cost $175 for the bottle, but well worth it."
"It is worth the expense to experience."
"Overall, it is very interesting and complex. I can see why it appeals to beer drinkers who also drink nicer liquor. I am extremely grateful to have tried it."
"This is not a common beer, it is something to enjoy very slowly - as a cognac."
"it poured nothing like beer, the smell was somewhat inviting (though not like beer), it tasted bad, it burned in your mouth, and it's far to expensive to drink (that is assuming anyone would want to)"
"D- well this is the ultimate fermented beer and it doesn't disappoint. I can't believe this is beer and I'm really happy I got to try it. So complex and interesting. Easily the best brew I've had from bbc."
"2005 vintage generously shared by Chris- thanks! Pours a clear blood orange red with some lighter hues at the edges. As expected, this one is still. Smell is very boozey, some raisins and maple syrup and a hint of oak. Taste is very hot, dark fruits, mission fig, raisin, maple syrup, over-ripened peach. Mouthfeel is obviously liquor-like rather then beer. Slightly coating and sweet but the alcohol heat helps the finish. For a 27% beer, this is far better then what I expected and an excellent dessert drink (drinkability rating keeps this 1oz after dinner pour in mind)."
"Bottle. Sampled both the 05 and the 09 in one night! Crazy! The aroma is nuts with more of a liquor aroma with sweetness added. Even smells hot! Caramel, vanilla, and toffee with a taste of alcohol that is extremely unique. Oak notes as well. Really glad I was able to try this and would totally try this again in the future. A sipper for sure. Is this beer? You need to try it for yourself to determine."
"The body is still and coats the mouth and throat like Nyquil. Overall this beer is insanely good in small doses. Probably not worth the price considering the type of spirits that $200 could buy, but the price shouldn't affect the score."
"The 05 wasn't as sweet. I didn't like it as much. It was more toned down though."
"I opened this bottle on the New Years Eve going into 2010. It had a great color to it. There really wasn't much head or carbonation at all to this beer. It smells like brandy with notes of vanilla, and very strong alcohol. It tasted very much like a brandy type beer with vanilla and caramel notes. Alcohol was very prominent. The mouthfeel was good it was a little dense and coated the mouth very good. Drinkability was surprisingly good. It wasnt harsh to where it made it difficult to drink but it definetly had a little burn to it. It was a great experience though. It definitely pushes the envelope on what has done before. I think it is a great beer and well worth the $150 that I paid for it. I will be looking forward to the next bottle of this that I purchase. TRY IT IF YOU GET THE CHANCE."
"The appearance of this beer is a headless caramel color with ruby red twinges when held to the light. The aroma is like whiskey and a hell of a lot of it. There may have been nuts or caramel tones as well to the aroma, but the alcohol made it rather hard to detect. The taste however strongly resembled that of maple syrup, partially due to the beverages consistence and mostly to do with the maple flavor. There are some toffee and hazelnut notes as well along with fruit characteristics like cherry syrup. This is a very viscous brew, but it is as advertised and compliments the style quite well. It actually doesn't really burn at all for something of such high ABV, making it very drinkable for a sipping liquor. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to try this, it was truly an interesting beer!"
"I'm curious to see if this beer was fortified. It is better to compare this to port as it has all of the properties of a fortified wine. Pours very thick, looks like brandy. The smell is very intense with all of the elements listed above plus dark plum and some blackberry. The taste is sweet and potent, like maple syrup with vodka. Overpowering but delicious. Worth having as a treat (or dessert)."
"The liquid is colored deep ruby. There is no head whatsoever. Lots and lots of film is left behind as I swirl the glass slightly. The nose is very complex. I can smell alcohol, oak, cognac, burnt wood. The taste is syrupy, and sherry-like with lots of fruits: prunes, dried apricots and other candied fruits. It's a little sweet, which works well. The finish is warm and has some crystal sugar sweetness. The coat is quite alcoholic, but also sweet and fruity. I was very afraid that Utopias wouldn't be very drinkable, but it truly is. The first sip will shock anyone (how can a beer taste like this!?), but after that, it goes down like any sipping hard alcohol of good quality. I actually went back for another pour! This drink is an exceptional invention--probably one of the best beers I've ever had, and unlike any beer I've come across. It is most definitely worth seeking out."
"Usually I don't do reviews with such a small sample size, but with this beer you really don't need a large amount, in fact, 1-2 ounces is the perfect pour for a beer of this type."
"Clearly the hype of Utopias makes this a fun beer to have reviewed. I'd try it again sometime to see if it matches up to now."
"A delicious drop and something truly unique. Better than any of the other super high alcohol beers I've had."
"A strange side note: during our tasting 1 of the individuals used a plastic EBF tasting cup while the rest used a small 4 oz sampler glass. Utopias served in a plastic cup smells significantly different than in the glass. I know it sounds strange but everyone at the table recognized this difference. In the glass it smelled more metallic and the alcohol was much more evident. Inside the plastic taster, the smell was more sweet and the alcohol was less pronounced without the previously mentioned metallic twang."
"This is something to be savored. Definitely not to be drank regularly. I did find it hard to drink, despite that, it was excellent."
"D - certainly an after dinner drink, maybe as a nightcap"
"D - More than all it is cracked up to be."
"Drinkability is good for what it is. This is the definition of a sipper in both flavor intensity and ABV. Quite pricey as well. Refined, smooth, and enjoyable."
"poured an ounce or so into my duvel tulip. 2005 vintage. thanks to some guys at martys in newton for calling me up when they dug up this gem. pale brown, orange and ruby tints, looks like bourbon. no carbonation, sugary enough to have some legs. nose is of rich maple, candied nuts and booze. as you bring it to your lips, you can feel the alcohol torching your palate already. only a small amount coats your palate completely. amazingly enough, booze and sugar do not create that typical medicinal taste. maple and honey flavors dominate the taste. mouthfeel is glorious, smooth and warm. i dont really know how to comment on the drinkability, other than the fact that i drank it all and i want more."
"Well it was everything I thought it would be which was as my friend kingcrowing put it ""tastes like a fortified beer."" I have to say I am happy that imagineiii was generous enough to share this."
"Is a really cool ""beer"" and totally worth checking out if you can."
"Right now, this was fantastic. Put a couple of years on this to mellow the booze out and this would be absolutely awesome. I'd imagine that the '07 is drinking pretty good right now. I may have to invest in a bottle of this down the line and see for myself."
"D- I basically treated this as a fine alcohol that I sipped on for a few hours. Also because it was the only thing I was able to drink all night beer wise. I came in not knowing what to think but after having tried it I am thoroughly impressed."
"I have only tried this beer once and quite honestly it may be the very best I have ever tried. The presentation was amazing. The growler is entirely metal. The color was an nice amber in color.The flavor profile was not at all overly sweet, but instead consisted of fine malt (from the use of Caramel, Vienna , Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts). This was combined with a balancing refined bitterness all in perfect harmony, while finishing with a satisfying dose of warming, but not burning alcohol. At 27% alcohol by volume, this deceptively strong beer is better compared to a premium Brandy or exquisite Sherry as opposed to any beer that I have every known. Even though this beer was aged in Scotch, Cognac and Port barrels, it did not have the overpowering raisin or maple character found in the Triple Bocks. Everything about the Utopias equated to balance and perfect harmony. Dropping $150 to $200 on 24 ounces of beer seems a bit ludicrous, but at a world record 27% ABV you have to be getting your money's worth."
"Notes from 02.11.10 at Beer Palace in Oslo"
"The world wide stout became flavorless after the Utopias, but much more drinkable."
"O - While it may be very different from what we would normally consider a beer, Utopia is really a fantastic creation. The complexity is overwhelming, and I'm sure it'll only get better with age. Worth every penny."
"Overall, I was elated to receive this as a gift. I had stared at it for a long time, not wanting to part with the money. After the first taste I knew it was something I'd love to keep and let mellow, so I quickly searched out another bottle. Not as gimmicky as some may think, this is very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Obviously not the easiest of brews to down, but who said one have to rush things in life? In small sips Utopias does wonders for the palate, almost. On a side note: once again, very, very similar to sweet mead."
"Vintage 2007. Thanks Dan for the sample. Pours completely still into the tasting glass, a nice rich auburn hue. Aromas of maple, vanilla, cognac and caramel. Drinking this is more like sipping cognac than drinking beer. Lots of alcohol, but also vanilla, caramel, wood, toffee and brown sugar. Very complex and very delicious. Glad I got to try this one again."
"Four of us split the bottle so ended up getting a fair quantity of this titan and boy was I happy about that. Pours a hazy amber, no head. The aroma is awesome after a minute or two to let it open up. It smells very sweet, like maple syrup with a vanilla quality to it. The taste surprised me because of a few things. Firstly, the heat is prevalent as would be expected but not as much as you would think. It is covered very well by the rich, sweetness. The second thing that surprised me was the lack of bite. I expected a much bigger bite but that is not to say I was disappointed, just pleased by in different ways. It had a silky, vanilla-oak finish that sticks with you quite a while after each drink. There is no carbonation whatsoever which was expected for an after-dinner type beer that is to be served at room temperature. In truth, even though it is brewed as a beer, it has much more in common with a nice cognac. Very drinkable to those who like a heavier drink, goes down easy and would probably sneak up on you if you kept drinking it all night."
"Taste is just like the smell, lots of deep sweetness, caramel, bourbon and honey with a lingering burn. It's dense and rich with a coating mouthfeel. Very smooth due to the lack of carbonation. Much more like a port than a beer and one I'd buy again if it sold for a reasonable price."
"Medium body, no carbonation. Full of heat. Very complex, what a treat."
"Tastes like it smells but with much more honey and it is quite hot. Very much like a good 50yr or older tawny port. Such big caramel and toffee flavors, good oak and bourbon really keeps things in perspective. Hugely complex. Light cocoa nib flavors, herbal tea, fig, date, quince paste. Thick, sticky and creamy a great beer but just way to expensive."
"D-I appreciate what SA has done here and find it to be VERY interesting but to actually sit and drink this...no. It is a novelty only. I will save my high ABV drinks and money for the likes of real liquors such as port, cognac, bourbon and Scotch. The aged version was certainly more palatable than the fresh version so maybe over time....I could see myself sitting down with a small snifter and enjoying it. For the price though....see my previous statement."
"in the end, I had a huge smile on my face and my brain was turning. Look forward to the next try."
"Prosit!"
" It smelled like alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, mixed with some raisin. It tasted like a beer liquor- alcohol, bourbon, sweet vanilla, maple syrup, prunes, figs, malty and nutty. A true sipper after dinner warmer. Overall absolutely delicious."
"Mouth/Drink: Smooth but hot mouthfeel, obvious with the alcohol as high as it is. 2oz each time if enough for me. Enjoyable if you're a scotch or liquor drinker in general. Lots to be discovered in each sip."
"D: If I was a cognac or port drinker, i would dig this for sure. However, I found myself wishing that I had a cold, carbonated, beer. I wouldn't have this again, however, you have to applaud the unique and daring lengths that Sam Adams has gone to with this one."
"D: Supremely drinkable. The 2-or-so-ounce pour that I got was enough to last me a long while, and I kept discovering new things with each small sip. Next time around, I think I'll definitely grab a bottle of this to hold onto for a while."
"D - I'm so happy I bought this beer for $150. It truly is a once in a lifetime experience. I have never had beer like this and I will most likely never have one like this again. Worth every penny. I could sip on this one and enjoy a 2 oz pour for hours."
"This is a sippin beer. After I poured, folks would sip it. set it aside. Drink something else. Come back to it. The taste really grew on me."
"Hmmm....taste....well to start the beer is medium to low bodied, there isn't any bitterness or carbonation to sour it out. Its sweet but not cloying at all, but it does finish really really dry and the alcohol is biting. It really is like sipping liquor not beer. Its plenty enjoyable but after four ounces I was ready to call it quits. I don't need anymore but I would try it again. Much better than the triple bock, overall a solid and impressive beer."
"In a third time and place it is the hardest yet most satisfying kegstand in the world. This beer is to be respected or it will kick your utopi-ass.    "
"Overall - I was slightly underwhelmed by this experience. It was no doubt a delicious beer but certainly not worth the list price of $150 IMO. Luckily, I had this at a tasting for $14/oz. Quite enough for me."
"This brew is a must-try if for nothing else than the experience. There are flavors all over the place, all blending together with the alcohol to make the most unique thing that has ever been in my mouth...and possibly ever will be."
"D: I'm glad I only had a 2oz. pour of this one. Can't and won't stand any more of this. I'm really glad to have had it though and taste what the commotion is all about. Not worth the investment in my opinion and might need a couple of years to tone down the alcohol and heat."
"I'll definately grab a bottle of this next time it's around."
"I tried this beer back in 2007. I was working at a store and my manager broke the neck off one of the 4 bottles we had on accident. The break was perfect. None of the beer spilled and it didn't get into the beer. I poured the remaining into a nalgene bottle and saved it until I got home for a more proper tasting. I like this beer because they are pushing the envelope and just the idea of what beer is and can be. No head at all completely no carbonation. Lots of molasses and caramelized sugars. Alcohol presence heavy, very very warming. It would make for a nice beer to enjoy during the heart of winter with good friends."
"Vintage 2007. Thanks to Kevin for his generosity in sharing this both now and at a previous tasting! The beer is a red copper color displaying plenty of church windows. Aromas of cognac, figs, plums, and raisins tickle the nose. Tastes of raisin, brown sugar, and a glorious spiritlike alcohol character that is just delicious. The body is thick and smooth, even without carbonation the feel is delightful. High in alcohol, but scrumptious to have sitting in the mouth. This is a beer I would drink all the time if it were feasible. Outstanding beer, while some may have ""beat"" it in terms of ABV, they taste comparatively atrocious to this masterpiece."
"A masterpiece. Ok, I'm not so sure if I'd pay three figures for my own bottle, but for a small dose at a smaller price, do what I did and go for it!"
"Pours dark amber with no head. The aroma is maple syrup, vanilla and caramel. The flavor is alcohol, sherry, port, caramel, vanilla and maple syrup. Thin mouthfeel and no carbonation. The alcohol is pretty hot as you would expect for a beer of this strength, but the complex flavors and aromas make the beer outstanding."
"D: I was honestly expecting to not like this beer. Once I gave it a sniff and a taste, however, I became a believer in it. And should I have a couple hundred bucks to spare, I would pick up one of these."
"O- it's hard to rate this as a beer- more a liqueur. One of, if not the most complex beers I've ever had. Quite the special experience."
"Big thanks to Bryan Brick at K&L for getting four bottles into their shop in Redwood City, California."
"My 100th review. Yay!"
"so very glad I was able to try it."
"Drinkability - I suppose if you had to factor in cost of consumption along with abv, this really isn't a very drinkable beer. Except that, in reality, it is - though certainly as it was intended to be consumed. In sipping, it's easy to enjoy, very similar again to a port or sherry, though in its own way, more complex and a little tastier. Smooth and balanced, it certainly is a great concoction worth the try. Looking forward to sipping this bottle over some time to come."
"D - It's a sipper. Don't be stupid! For Jebus Christ sake, it's 27% abv! Don't drink a pint!!!"
"I have to say that Utopias is well out of my day-to-day price range, even if I could find it (I will not disclose my seller as I don't want to cause a stampede). I was first let into the know of Utopias by a co-worker of mine who has to this day, not found a bottle of for himself. I almost feel bad..."
"Drinkability: I was truly shocked. I thought this beer was all hype but after trying it I change my mind. Not sure I'd pay $200 for it but it was great."
"D. Wonderfully drinkable, wish I could have had an entire glass of this beer to really sip and enjoy."
"D - Poured 3 oz. Probably enough for now. Excited I have more."
"Thanks again and many cheers to Josh for letting me sample this treat."
"I really am glad I got to try this without shelling out $25-40 in a bar setting. I really loved it and was a great experience and may even look for my own bottles as funds allow just to be able to pull out on those special occasions."
"Not as un-beer-like as many BAs seem to think. Big and complex and certainly unique, but fits relatively well under the strong ale / old ale umbrella."
"D. Well, it is 27% ABV, and it is quite pricey. For a taster it cost us $25.00! However this a wonderful beer for anyone who has the funds and appreciation for what it is. This is one you have to try at least once."
"D: surprisingly well for the ABV. Definitely a sipper. This was split amongst a small group. Definitely the way to go with this one."
"D- Nice drinkable beer at 3 to 4 ounces. Anything more than that and I think I would have a problem. This beer isn't made to be drank in huge amounts. Very interesting beer to say the least which I am glad I got to try. I don't think it was worth the price I payed (overall) but I went in on this with a couple of friends. Worth trying at least once in your beer drinking life."
"To be honest I was not too impressed with this beer. While I am a Samuel Adams fan, this beverage did not hit it with me. First off, its very expensive which is the biggest turn off. Second, it drinks closer to a tawny port or port wine, maybe sherry. In some cases it's not classified as beer because of it's fermenting methods, and ABV Levels. Good taste, very good for sipping on. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, it just doesn't remind me of what a beer should be. Plus, it's not worth the money."
"This is a great beer that everyone should try if given the opportunity. If you find one, try to have a few friends go in on it with you and it'll be more fulfilling and won't bruise the old wallet quite as much."
"D: How do you rate the drinkability of this beer? A couple of ounces after a meal is all you really need. In that respect - it's good. 4/5"
"I am sure many main stream beer drinkers would like take a shot of Utopias and chase it with Bud Light, or even drop a shot of this into a pint of Guiness, but please hold back the fratboy-horses and enjoy the complexity of this beer."
"It is somewhat hard to rate a beer like this in terms of drinkability, but this stuff does go down pretty easy."
"This isn't really a beer. It's incredibly hard to rate ""within style"" because I'm not sure there's really a style here. It's a wholly unique creation. It's almost like a maple syrup port liqueur. But not overly sweet. Glad for the opportunity. Probably wouldn't buy a bottle, but would be happy to have it again."
"D - quite drinkable -- err, sippable -- considering the gravity. But let's be real, it's not the first thing to come to mind when you think of drinkability, no matter how enjoyable"
"Many have questioned whether or not this can be opened and enjoyed over time rather than all at once. I will see over time, because there is no damn way im drinking this bitch all tonight, but my first impression is that you could recap this and let it sit just like a bottle of booze. What gives me this impression? Oh i don't know, maybe the fact that this IS a bottle of booze!"
"This particular bottle is the 2009 batch, bottle number 437. Pours into the Sam Adams Utopias glass as a brownish/red or deep copper color. Swirl the glass gently and it sticks to the sides like a viscous, syrup; this stuff is THICK! There's no carbonation and no lacing. Smells of maple, cinnamon, whiskey, bourban, vanilla. Perhaps a slight hint of butter? (very, very faint, though.) The taste is, well...good gawd, is this really beer? I sip this and think I'm drinking a fine cognac, it doesn't taste like beer, it tastes like a cordial. Picking up nuances of vanilla, cinnamon, maple, massive amounts bourban, sherry, and whiskey. In fact, there's so many different layers of complexity that I can't even detect them all. There's a huge burning sensation in the throat for an extended period of time after the sip. The texture is amazingly velvety smooth on the tongue. This is more of a cognac than a beer and I'm blown away by this beer, it's so incredible, different, and pushes the envelope to such extreme measure that the line between liquor and beer has now been fogged. I'm fortunate to have gotten a bottle of this through a family connection, I hope to experience this again before I die! The big down side is because of the 50 barrel quantity, it's darn hard to find and when you do, who can really afford it? My father in law works for Sam Adams so I'm blessed. (Go ahead, punch me!!)"
"D: 27% abv, what do I say? Goes down easy for what it is. I'm just giving it an ""average"" (3.0) because there really is no precedent for a ""beer"" like this. As it is, it is very tasty and I am grateful to have tried it."
"I've got 2 bottles for my bachelor party in January - looking forward to another great drink."
"Props to my buddy Jake for finding this. We cracked it on a crisp, sunny fall day. Pours into the glass like syrup, a deep reddish-brown, obviously thick. No carbonation but I'll be damned if it doesn't leave legs on the glass like a fine wine. Lots of greasy ones. It smells of alcohol (makes it hard to smell, really), prunes, and honey. Tastes of molasses, maple syrup, prunes, honey, vanilla, and oranges with a peppery and strong warming alcohol finish. It has an oak-like aftertaste and long after the fact it tastes like sherry. Maybe it just takes me a while to identify that. The mouthfeel is syrupy but slippery, absolutely flat. It coats your tongue and seems to be settling in to stay like an unemployed in-law. I can't call it drinkable, really, but then again its not that you don't like it, its just that its very clear that a small amount is all you need or want in a session. Really unusual, really sweet, very complex, and very, very good. A fantastic experience, cheers to Jake for the opportunity!"
"Not my cup of tea at all but really glad I had the chance to try it. My hat is off to the people at Sam Adams for constructing such an innovative and unique brew"
"drinkability: what a treat and definitly worth the expereince. Much better than triple bock."
"This is beyond beer in the traditional sense. Massive alcohol burn with a surprising amount of subtle earthy and and dark fruit character. Wonderful bourbon oak character. Rich toffee and caramel. A must try."
"Excellent, great snifter drink especially on a cold night. Very much reminds me of great tawny port. If it wasn't so pricey and rare I would drink this semi regularly."
"Pick up a sixer and kick back with a pint! ;)"
"Sam Adams Utopias pours a smooth amberish red liquid with brilliant orange highlights. No carbonation, and pure liqueur in appearance. Smell is strong. Wonderfull blend of bourbon, nice wood, and other whiskey notes. Complex as any nose can note. Taste has a mixed whiskey flavor thats smooth, strong, and slightly sweet. The strength is exeptional, but far more smooth than I ever expected. Feels like a fine Cognac in texture and density. Fine barrel wood types of Bourbon linger in the aftertaste with a slight sweet note of Brandy. This is one fine drink of some strong booze. My taste loves this, but its not for the faint of heart."
"A special treat. Hats off to the folks at Sam Adams for creating this gem."
"This is very drinkable, but it is definitely an 'occasion' drink. It is just way too rich and decadent to have on a regular basis. But on the occasion that it does get poured, it shall be enjoyed, thoroughly."
"Overall this was the most unique beer to ever touch my lips. I'm so glad Andy was able to score a bottle and split it with me. I look forward to sipping this beer on cold Wisconsin nights. Fantastic."
"D - Given how much alcohol is in it, this is dangerously drinkable. Not something you can pound, but easier to drink than some ""normal"" beers I've had."
"Drinkability: definitely a sipper but I would definitely have this again. I'm glad I tried it and I recommend others to try it as well. I recommend this for cognac lovers as well as those seeking an intense sweet earthy raisin profile with an alcohol nose and presence throughout."
"So complex and tasty! So many nuances in this, In my opinion, my review does not completely do this beer justice! Another thank you to BeerFMAndy for letting me try this incredible & spectacular brew!"
"D= How can you rate this beer anything less than perfect... This is a beer that all other ""extreme"" beers will have to match up to. There is nothing to compare this too and is so far out there that I'm not sure if people will try to match this. Not only that but it's awesome. Not the best beer I've ever had but it's up there and for the ""style"" it's perfect."
"Overall a unique experience, a novelty. I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste it, but for $225 a bottle here in Rochester, I'd rather have an early 90's vintage Thomas Hardy's ale if I am looking for a similar experience."
"Utopias was awesome to try and my second glass was delicious with a cigar, but $180 is simply insane. I'd love to give the drinkability a 5, but at some point the price must be factored in when it gets to such a level. If this were $40-$50 and readily available it would be a staple in my house."
"They were selling this on tap for $15 an ounce. Luckily my boy was working at the Tap and gave me a free taste...Nose was all about whisky and honey. The taste was like a port wine or mead with intense alcohol flavor as well. This was amazing, but no beer is worth so much money. A gimmick if you ask me, but a very very tasty gimmick."
"This beer is phenomenal. It is insane, and a drinking experience unlike any other I have experienced. This is almost certainly the most complex beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I am truly impressed with the boys at Boston Beer Co. Well done, sirs. Well done. Wow."
"D - This beer is so drinkable it's scary. A perfect night-cap and sipper for the winter season. If someone gave me a snifter full of this without telling me a) the percent and b) what it was I would probably be much more drunk than I'd like. A great sipper that is a fantastic beer and totally surpasses the hype."
"I am pleasantly surprised by the complexity of this beer. I really hope I'm able to get another taste of this sometime soon."
"Overall this was a very worthwhile experience and one that all should enjoy at least once. Highly Recommended."
"This was an exceptional experience. Was able to try it at a tasting event at Table & Vine in West Springfield, MA. There is no real effervescence at all to it. The taste is along the lines of a bourbon, with hints of maple syrup. For the high alcohol content it was incredibly smooth, with an almost velvety mouthfeel to it--very easy to sip on slowly. All and all, a bit difficult to describe, but a great experience to say the least."
"this beer pours a beautiful brown color with golden red highlights. no head or effervescence to speak. the aroma screams of roasty dark malt, dark fruit, and a bit of hops hiding in the alcohol. the taste is great with the dark fruit, the aging in the casks really paid off some really tasty sweet wood notes. the biterness and the alcohol bite and low carbonation make this a really amazing barleywine. damn near a whiskey. thanks for the beer weswes."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with no head and a noticeable clinging to the sides of the glass. The aroma is awesome!! It has a killer warmth to it as well as a damn complex array of dark fruits and burnt toffee. The taste is perfect. It has an extremely complex mix of malt character and alcohol esters. The wood aging really adds a nice vanilla character that rounds out the flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It is a full bodied beer with no carbonation. This is an exceptional beer that's in a class of it's own."
"D: I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I expected it to be some ridiculous booze-bomb, so I flatly turned down the invitation to share in splitting this up. I'm glad I was talked into it afterward; this was truly worth the experience. I can see myself buying one in the future as a self-gift, if I can swing something slightly better than the $200 / bottle price."
"Drinkability is surprisingly high, and if not for the potency I'd be happy sipping on this for quite a while. This is a great beer, pretty much one of a kind at this point and more than just a gimmick, it's genuinely enjoyable."
"Utopias should be reserved for a life altering celebration or an occasion where it is the focus. While this is an amazing beer, it has few of the standard qualities of beer. One or two ounces at a time is plenty. So, amazing as it is, I find it difficult to say this is especially drinkable. I hope to have another someday, and certainly expect to enjoy it just as much. As for cellaring, I wonder how much it can progress beyond its current state. Oh, and it floods back Autumn memories, sitting on the porch with Grandpa, his cigar, and evening drink."
"Overall: Its delectable and when you drink it you understand the price because this is the definition of finely crafted beer (if you can even call it that) but truly is an artfully developed masterpiece by Jim. Perfect showcase of my venture into the beer world as this is my 100th review; i've come along way from being a beer noob to knowing/respecting the likes of this one."
"O: Obviously a sipper. It gets a little too sweet after drinking a few ounces - but a few ounces will go a long way. This was very good and I'm glad I had the experience, but at $14/ounce or $150+/bottle, I really don't think it's worth it. As I mentioned above, this really isn't beer either. I definitely wouldn't think it was beer if someone just served it to me without telling me what it is. You can probably get some nice liqueurs for $30-40/bottle that achieve basically the same thing that this does."
"D= Obviously a sipper, but I sort of understand the price better now. This is a beer that drinks like whisky, so the bottle will last a long time if you have an occasional ""shot"". Could be nursed for months!"
"I don't really know how to review this beer. It is what it is. An intense aroma and flavor profile. Obviously meant to be an after dinner drink. I love port wine, and this is very similar. I really enjoy this, and worth a purchase if you can get a few friends to go in with you (like I did). If you have the means and opportunity, pick it up."
"I was fortunate to try a snifter of this at a Sam Adams beer dinner recently. Pours clear caramel with no head. Smells amazing - not like beer at all, but rather like port or sherry or some other similarly delicious alcoholic beverage. Smell stings your nostrils in a good way with caramel, vanilla, oak, and alcoholic heat. Taste follows the smell - and leaves that same bite in the back of your throat as would brandy or sherry. Extremely sweet. Body is very thick and there's no carbonation whatsoever. Overall, a very delicious beverage, but I would not spend $150 on a bottle."
"Say what you will about the price tag, this is an excellent beverage. I think calling something so high in alcohol that it forces CO2 out of solution a beer is a bit of a stretch. Though it may technically be a beer, it drinks like port and that is how it should be viewed. In any case, I enjoyed it and if you're buyin, I'll have another!"
"Pretty good, but you can't drink a ton of this."
"Overall, this was amazing. I could sip on this all night. The epitome of a sipper for sure, but the flavors are very complex."
"D - Well, it's meant to be a sipper and it is. Really awesome stuff, but way overpriced of course. Nice novelty beer."
"D: The biggest deterrent is the $price$tag$, but one hell of an adventurous beer on Sam Adams part. The high abv makes this impossible to drink in large quantities, but when savored it's a great liver warming beer."
"Overall - The fancy, after-dinner liqueur for the beer drinker that doesn't like liqueur. If Millennium and Triple Bock challenged what a beer could be, Utopias downright defies it. Is it the ultimate evolution of beer? Or is it just a snooty pet project from the nutjobs in Boston? Does it really matter? This beer is awesome, and that's all that matters. Grab a few snifters and a few really good friends, and enjoy."
"D: I actually like this one. Of course, it's more reminiscent of a fortified wine or liqueur than a regular beer, but that's how it's supposed to be. A great sipper with a sophisticated yet cocky character."
"For being so high in alcohol this is really a shockingly smooth beer. Must be enjoyed in a room of beer lovers, because this is intense, exploding all over the place with conversational quality."
"first HUGE THANKS to Schulzy1 for sharing this beast. pours out a slightly dark caramel color and immediately the aroma fills the nose. maple syrup and cognac smells. taste is enthralling!! notes of caramel, toffee, maple syrup, and alcohol. this is truly a wonderful elixir. if you like sweets and alcohol, you will like this, but first, you have to get it...simply amazing and hard to believe it's a beer. also, this one is a sipper"
"D: Hardly drinkable due to the amount of heat, but I did find that with every sip I took the next one came quicker."
"Think a beer that tastes like a liquid Werther's Toffee, intertwining complexities and profiles seamlessly and balancing the liquor/beer nicely. Hard to make a a beer taste like a beer when it has no carbonation. That mission was accomplished here."
"Enjoyed on New Year's Eve 2005. Deep amber and copper with long legs (and burgandy lips). The aroma presents some overwhelming alcohol, with maple and whisky. Tons of maple in each drink. Oak and vanilla. You can feel the alcohol evaportating in your mouth. So over the top that this is no longer beer."
"pours medium to dark brown. no head, no carbonation. pours like a cognac, sticky and sweet. Its beautiful the way it coats the side of the glass. Aroma is pure alcohol, can hardly smell the vanilla and chocolate. The taste is sweet and delicious. Taste of vanilla, chocolate, maple, raisin. Aftertaste is a nice burn as it goes down, smooth as well. This beer will fuck you up. Drink with caution!! Drinkabilty is low, too much and you can hurt yourself. But it is a MUST try."
"Strong maple notes both in smell and taste. Tasted like a port fortified with maple brandy. Created a warming sensation as it traveled down the esophagus. I drank it out of the Utopias glassware that came with the bottle. It had a slight syrupy consistency that coated the glass."
"D: Good alone, or with dessert. Absolutely worth the cost, it has earned its reputation. Very warming, good for the winter."
"O: Drinkability is low due to high ABV. While very tasty, a few ounces of this and I am done for. This is a brew best shared amongst people who really enjoy craft beer and not for thr faint of heart."
"I have the bottle from 2006 and still tastes unbelievable and actually think it is getting better with age. Highly recommend trying this beer if you ever get the opportunity."
"Great brew."
"Also had the pleasure of having it out of a keg bout 5 years back."
"D: Somehow really drinkable. Had a 2oz sample of this and that was more than enough. Then I had another 2 oz sample. The warmer this gets the better it gets. Just an amazing beer that really does push the limits of what beer can be. The cellaring potential on this beer is off the charts. I don't think it will ever get worse."
"This beer is delicious. Unfortunately I know have acquired a taste for a beer I am no where near being able to afford."
"Drinkability : one shot of this is enough for the evening. The sweetness of this is almost too much."
"This one pours from a tupperware container to my glass. There is no carbonation but it sticks to the glass and slowly slides back down. The smell is extremely boozy and that is all. The taste is nothing like beer. It is very sweet but very easy to drink. There was a strong alcohol presence but not in a bad way. The mouthfeel was sweet and smooth, not sticky as it was in the glass. Drinkability was horrible for a beer but great for what it is. I am very greatful to soulfly967 for bringing a sample over."
"I'm not even sure this is beer anymore, but it tastes amazing. If it wasn't so ridiculously expensive this would be a regular feature in my liquor cabinet."
"i was a little skeptical going in to this one. i really wanted to try it, but expected something boozy and very obviously not ""beer"". however, i was very pleasantly surprised. even with the higher alcohol, it never loses its ""beer"" character. sure, there are comparisons to be drawn, but this is more like a strong finely-aged barleywine or strong ale than a port or cognac. even at the high bottle cost, i honestly want a bottle of this so i can just spend a day sipping on it. so good. huge thanks go out to mike for pulling this from his personal stash for the event."
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber, nice honey colour, no head and no lace, but does sport some pretty insane looking legs, they really stick all over the glass. Smell is amazing and intense, vanilla, honey, oak, toffee, nougat, insanely malty, alcohol, grapes, figs and raisins, butterscotch, slightly musty, maple, just crazy rich and intense. Taste is the same, mega intense, wood, insane amount of toffee and honey, brown sugar, figs, raisins, vanilla, dark fruit, maple syrup, alcohol, just has everything in the flavour, very rich and malty. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy, low carbonation, insanely smooth, you do not get the almost 26% alcohol out of this. Perfect fireside sipping beer, I'd replace everything of that sort in my liquor cabinet for this stuff. Just amazing and I'm really happy I got the chance to try this. Perfect for what it is, need to get me some."
"2012 bottle is very maple syrup liquor."
"I'm sure this was not intended to consume in large amounts but a tasting was just the right amount. It went done smooth and just seemed to slide across the tongue."
"2007 Bottle Number 08474 - Pours a beautiful orange/brown with absolutely not a trace of carbonation. This is more like a fine conaque than a beer. Sampled along side by side with Hair of the Dog Dave. Dave being happily aged for 14 years was mellow and welcoming, purring like a cat with a ton of complexity. The young un-behaved 2007 Utopias was still screaming with plenty of maple syrup, spicy fruits and a whopping of alcohol playing haphazardly on the tongue. The 2007 Utopias could use a good 8 to 10 years of time out. This is a highly addictive drink that makes you pay whatever it takes on ebay to satisfy the craving for more. I am saving a bottle for 2017 and another bottle for 2027."
"- some fuesel alcohol flavors were present but not overwhelming - i mean what do you expect from a 25% brew?!"
"Drinkability: A nice after dinner sipper, but something to spread out over time, as it is very stable; a nice toast to end Christmas 2008"
"If you do not like Hard liquors you will most likely not like this. I only drink beer, and I found myself having a really hard time with this one. I can definitely see where people would love this, but I personally would not go out of my way to have it again because it is more of a Hard Liquor than a beer."
"Drinkability is suprisingly high. The flavor profile is spot on IMO and quite enjoyable, and although the alcohol is very apparent, it's an important aspect to this beer. I love it."
"D - Sip this one and enjoy the complexity. This is not a beer by conventional definition. I only drank about 4 oz, and that was plenty. Kept me warm on a cold winter day"
"D - You need to give it a little time to open up or it is an alcohol mess. Very good and nice to see some breweries, especially as big as Sam Adams pushing the edge on beer styles."
"This is interesting to try, but it fails a key test: what is the point? If you want a beer, have a beer. If you want Cognac, have cognac. This is neither and therefore will satisfy nobody."
"A special occasion beer--and yes, this is beer. Reminding myself of that as I sipped helped me remember 1) the almost limitless possibilities of the brewing process, and 2) the talent of Jim Koch and co. when they really roll their sleeves up and get to it. This is a far sight better than their Triple Bock--don't even compare the two, even if it's tempting to do so. (Thanks again Greg!)"
"Thanks to Jim Koch and everyone at Sam Adams, this is something truely unique."
"I had the pleasure to taste this at yesterdays GABF evening session. I was much more impressed than I thought I would be as it leaves a very pleasant maple and vanilla taste on your palate and although very alcoholic it had only subtle hits of its true abv. You do have some oak and Sherry notes that come through as well. It has a very thick mouth feel and no carbonation. This is truly a great beer that can be appreciated by any beer advocate."
"This pours a dark red/burgundy with no head at all, its served still. Looks thicker and almost syrupy compared to any other beer ever. Smells of cognac, port wine, alcohol, and maple. Tastes like it smells, lots of alcohol in there. This one is a sipper for sure! Sweet sticky mouthfeel with a slight alcohol burn and a thick body. This is one of those brews that truly breaks ground. Great brew that really is outside the box, I wish I could afford to drink this more often!"
"Overall I'm glad I had a chance to try this. It's very interesting, somehow it still resembles a beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a syrupy dark amber with no carbonation. Smelt of condensed maple, alcohol and molasses. Taste was pure maple, molasses, and a smooth alcohol burn. Truly unique and amazing. I would recommend all BAs try this at least once. I know I will be getting a bottle of the next release."
"I could see how this wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, and it certainly isn't ""drinkable"" in the slightest, but really wonderful to try."
"Pours a beutiful golden brown into a tiny brandy snifter to capture the aroma. It looks more like liquor then beer, and the nose is off the charts (and clearly more developed then the 07). Malt, port, caramel, dates...Seriously, every other time I lifted this to my lips just inhaling the delicious aroma was enough. And the flavor; a drop on the tongue spreads throughout the mouth a delcious complicated hoppy, malty, caramel magic. Being stranded on a desert island would be worth it if a bottle of this was along. I thought this beer would be all hype but it was worth every dollar."
"I was able to sample a 1 oz pour of this at Downtown Bar & Grill in Brooklyn. It was a nice dark bronze/copper color with no head or lacing (as expected). A very nice aroma with some sweet smells and vanilly. The flavor was very smooth which matched the aromas and you could taste the alcohol. It very much reminded me of a tawny port in both smell and taste. The mouthfeel was very smooth and syrupy. Even at the price, this is one that I would love to pick up a bottle of and slowly savor. It's definitely a sipper."
"This is a pretty brew. Flat, yes, but pretty none-the-less. Dark reddish amber, and very Cognac-like in appearance, how can one turn away. The aromas jump out at you whilst you take in the colour of this brew. Yes, they are that strong and seem to shout things like Alcohol!, Sugar!, Raisins!, Sherry!, Port!, Cognac!, Malts, and Plums! The taste is burning and singing with alcohol, but in a good way like a fine strong port, or a nice French Cognac. The taste is all alcohol, molasses, other sugars, dark fruits, nuts, syrups, and more. Truly a ""beer"" to behold. Mouthfeel is liquor-like and coating and the drinkability is actually quite good for a beer that you drink by the shot, or snifter. Truly a one-of-a-kind brew. I hope every BA gets to try this,"
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Drinkability- sip all night long, great for breaking out for celebrations, (like when the Giants won the super bowl)"
"Tasted at room temperature, out of a snifter. It's slightly thick and syrupy, with a pleasant mouth feel. It's sweet and warming, with flavors of maple, vanilla, oak and caramel. It's a wholly unique experience -- it doesn't taste much like beer, or for that matter scotch or anything else. Absolutely worth trying, and worth the price, but not the sort of thing I'd want to regularly indulge in."
"Overall this was really unlike anything I had before. It is in a class of its own, as it should be and something that everyone should get to try. For 120.00 I would buy a bottle with no issues asked. I would love to have this one sitting around waiting for me every night!"
"This is a def must try- a holy grail of beer if you will- enough said."
"I wish I could put this on waffles."
"Overall: Drop all preconceived notions of beer when tasting this. Treat it as you would any hard liquor of your choice & you'll be fine. Though i probably won't splurge 120$+ on a bottle, i definitely love this brew & was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to try it. You should try this at least once."
"Quite a while ago I had the unfortunate experience of trying over and over again to like Sam Adams Triple Bock. I tried multiple bottles, both fresh and aged over 5 years. None of them worked for me. I could never get over the taste of soy sauce and dead yeast. Happily, this attempt at creating a super strong beer fares much better. First off, the bottle is beautiful- I love the copper sheathing. The pour itselff looks like a cognac or something, but slightly more viscous. No head at all, but excellent clarity and it sticks to the glass. The aromas are not at all beer like. Instead I get maple sweetened brandy, but nicely balanced and not too sweet. The taste is even nicer, for what it is. Long brandy like heat, but fairly smooth and tempered somewhat by clean-tasting relatively dry maple syrup flavors, and some vinous qualities. Extremely smooth in the mouth, and although surprisingly dry, the sweetness and feeling of alcohol build as you drink and necessitate only having a single small pour. Very interesting, and very much a beer digestif."
"Drinkability: A super slow sipper for sure, and one that's made even more enjoyable when you weren't the one who actually paid for the bottle."
"Drinkability- Well there's no way I could drink more than a couple ounces of this at a time but it's definitely tasty. I am a fan of a nice whiskey over a couple cubes and this was sort of in the same breath. I'm sure it was more of a cognac or brandy but I don't drink that stuff. Pretty darn good and big thanks again to Greg!"
"I am amazed that this bottle cost $160 and a bottle of 120 is only $10. It is a great beer experiment. But the beer obviously taken on alcohol from the whiskey."
"D: This is a sipper. At a couple of ounces at a time this makes for a wonderful after dinner or before bead treat. I doubt much more than a few ounces in any one setting would be able to be appreciated."
"This was quite an exceptional treat to sample. It's technically a beer, although its characteristics are more like a scotch or cognac. It poured a clear, dark copper with no head. It had an extremely strong and complex scent of brown sugar malt, cinnamon sugar, wheat, and alcohol. Its flavor was even stronger, blending super sweet honey, maple syrup, hazel nut, refined wheat, and delicate malt. It was oily and very smooth with no carbonation, and a very strong and lasting aftertaste of bitterness and alcohol warming. Overall this was just about perfect - one of the best alcoholic beverages of any sort that I've tried. It was very simple at first, but the more you thought about it, the more complex it became. It had chameleon-like characteristics, in that you could discern hints of practically any flavor you thought about. Despite the ridiculous price tag, this is worth it."
"This could easily be called a cognac or several other different types of hard alcohol, tasted much better than their Triple Bock even though it was much stronger, cannot imagine what Hair of the Dog Dave tastes like it has three or four percent ABV on this one, only twelve thousand bottles of this worldwide, aged in four different barrels throughout the year it is brewed, lots of time and effort go into making this rarity, truly one of the most unique beers I will ever have, glad I tried it even though it was the most expensive couple ounces of beer I will probably ever have, recommended if you do not mind pulling out the credit card"
"Overall, it was fun to finally try this beer with Koch as my bartender. It was interesting and complex. A strong/old ale type beer with massive alcohol. The most impressive thing about it was the drinkability. Was I blown away? No. Would I pay $125 for it. No. But I'd definitely drink it again for free."
"Overall: I managed to find a bar that was offering the 2 oz. shots of this. I'm glad I paid the money I did for the shot, but I'm also glad I didn't buy the whole bottle at a store. In that end I'd recommend it, but only to those who seriously like the high gravity barley wine style beers, or port, or whiskey."
"D- The only thing that will keep you from having another is if you're buddy owns the bottle and won't part with any more. 2 maybe 3 short glasses of this will suffice."
"I see what all the fuss is about. Good and calling this an ""extreme beer"" is a good thing. Drink-ability is diminished purely of the alcohol content. Sip don't rip it. Enjoy just like a cognac."
"D- I think it is really good but not easy to drink. It is more like a hard alcohol instead of a beer (of course). I doubt I would spend $150 on a bottle but to try a ounce of it (like I have) it is good."
"This was one of best Christmas presents ever and it took me until now to drink it. I first had it a couple years ago at Sam Adams Beer Dinner. I would highly recommend everyone try it at least once. A couple ounces is more than enough."
"I was lucky enough to receive this as a gift from my wife for Christmas. I was so anxious to try this beer that I was almost nervous. I figured for the price, this beer must be something special. The first thing to hit me was the smell after opening the bottle. It smelled strong of alcohol, oak, and a sort of molasses sweetness. Poured out with no carbonation, but still looked nice in the Utopias snifter. The color was of a deep copper. The taste was smooth in comparison to ports and cognacs. It definitely can't be compared to most other beers. There are notes of oak, burnt caramel, vanilla, and fruits; but none of them overwhelm eachother. Part of the enjoyment of this beer probably comes from the experience of drinking a beer that is more expensive than a lot of fine wines and spirits. Athough it is smooth, this beer is definitely a sipper. Two ounces is just enough to make each tasting special. If you can find a bottle, or a bar that will sell it by 2 ounce shots, taste it. You'll be drinking a part of new beer history."
"After recently having the past five vintages of the beer, its quite obvious that these beers get better and better with each subsequent release. Even as earlier versions are lesser in alcohol, they portray an overall rougher alcohol taste. The more recent versions are smoother, stronger, and more sophisticated in taste- and yes... worth every penny!"
"No head and no carbonation more like cognac than a beer. This is a great winter after dinner beer. It's 20F out tonight and this seemes like an apropreate beer. Taste is burnt caramel honey and maple I dont taste any hops. This is a great beer but its just to expensive I dont think I will buy it again."
"Jim Koch, I tip my hat to you. Or would, if I had one."
"D-Not an all night drinker but I would have more than one for a very special occasion Try this if you get the chance you will not be let down."
"Overall, an exceptional beer/liquor. Well worth the money for me to try once in my life and exceptional to sip on. Will definitely consider purchasing another one if I can ever get my hands on it."
"Overall: I am honored to have a bottle of this on hand to sip as I please. I drank it as the colts game finished and it was a great way to end a wonderful day of drinking wonderful brews. I look forward to future occasions when I will sample this one because it is a wonderful and ultra unique brew that in my opinion is worth the high price tag."
"Well... when I first heard of Utopias I knew that I would have it one day. How does one even begin to categorize or rate with numbers something that is nothing like anything else ever made? I would recommend to every beer fanatic a taste of this, at all costs. This will absolutely change your perception of what beer can be. It's much more like a port or scotch than a beer, of course. It's amazing."
"I'm not really sure how to rate this ""beer"" as it is so different as to preclude it from being compared against any conventional beers, but I'll give it a shot. I poured a 1 oz. sample into my Utopias glass that came ""free"" with the purchase of the bottle. Color is a clear burnt orange with hints of amber and ruby. As it is flat, there is no head. Swirling reveals legs on the side of the glass as you get with fine wines and cognacs. Swirling also exposes the intense aromas of vanilla, maple, and brown sugar. These come out in the flavor as well, with an intense sweetness and a warming alcohol sense as it goes down. Given the sweetness, strength, and most importantly the cost, I would not want to drink more than 1 of these in a given evening, which is why I gave a low score for drinkability. Overall, its a nice novelty but not really what I look for in an alcoholic beverage, and the cost is staggeringly high at $150 per 25 oz. bottle (roughly $6 per once)."
"Still very good and i did get it for original 150 dollar price."
"I did buy a couple more bottles to cellar and I can't wait to taste how they are in a few years. I didn't think this could live up to the hype, but it did for me. I'll admit that I am a port fan as well, so I already enjoy a lot of the flavors and feel that Utopias brings to the table."
"D- Obviously not an all night drinker but I will have as much as I can! Try this if you get the chance you will not be let down."
"If one likes scotch or whiskey, I'm sure they would love to give this a try. It is definitely a sipper, but I am not sure how much I couldn't drink very much of this at all."
"It was fun to have, but I don't see myself, because of the hefty price, buying a bottle anytime soon."
"Considering the alcohol level, this is very very drinkable, but only by way of sipping. I'd love to have a bottle of this so I could pour a significant helping into a snifter and just slowly revel in the sweetness and warmth on a cold winter night."
"I came in to the tasting skeptical of whether this could really be a worthwhile brew. I left blown away. I could easily drink this every night in place of a good port were it not so cost-prohibitive. Simply put: excellent."
"I was all about this with the 2005 version. I mean really talked this up to friends who themselves loved it. However, this version was a real disappointment. Flavor was consumed by the alcohol in this batch. Someone told me that this version tastes like a cheap port. After having this I would have to agree. Don't get me wrong. I LOVED the 2005 version. I paid a grip of money to get that version and felt it was money well spent. This version really bummed me out. I may be wary of future vintages from now on. I would say, taste this (if you can) before you buy."
"OK, wow. What an amazing beer! Knowing it's rarity and it's tendency to be gone quickly at the GABF, my buddies and I shot straight for the Sam Adams booth and this was our first beer of the day and by far the best. This beer is obviously big but it's complexity is amazing. There's very little carbonation but the mouth feel is excellent. It's very sweet but not overwhelmingly so. It was like liquid candy. Loved it. :)"
"Sampling Utopias was definitely a unique experience. I would definitely spend the $14 again to do so. Congratulations to Sam Adams for not only brewing the strongest beer in the world but doing so with style and flair."
"D = A great drink to be enjoyed slowly after dinner. A good substitute for a port, sherry, scotch, bourbon, cognac, etc. However, it is definitely expensive and if that were not caused by its limited availability, I would say it costs too much for what it is."
"Definitly a sipper. A good beer, but not worth 100+ a bottle imo"
"How could a 25% abv beer be any more drinkable? This beer is definetly a sipper, but considering it's 25% alcohol, it's a damn drinkable beer."
"The pour is a clear copper color with no carbonation and thick streaming legs on the glass as you swirl it. The nose is very warm and nutty with a lot of maple. The flavor has hazelnuts, vanilla, caramel, figs, and maple that finishes pretty hot, but not as hot as you would think. It defiantly is more like a port wine than a beer. Worth a try if you can get it."
"Shared a bottle of this last night at Bodega Brew Pub downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin. Poured with a lovely redish amber color. Very aromatic with sherry, caramel, walnuts, and hints of oak, rum, vanilla, and brandy. Taste was the same but thick with sweetness. Great finish. Satisfying. And so rich."
"Key points are: maple, drinkable, and delicious. Perfect for a cigar. Worth the money? Hell yeah, but I'm still not gonna buy one!!! Cheers!"
"Well done."
"Thanks go to blitheringidiot for sharing this rare treat. 2005 vintage #06370. Poured into a small snifter glass. Appears a beautiful, clear amber red with zero head, carbonation and lacing. Smells of butterscotch, vanilla, and brandy. Tastes of butterscotch, sweet brown sugar, molasses, vanilla. Practically defines the word smooth. Buttery mouthfeel and like I said, no carbonation at all. What an amazing, wonderful beer. The perfect celebration drink for a beer lover. I am grateful I had the chance to sample this extraordinary brew. Thanks to Jim Koch for putting this out there. Excellent job BBC!"
"Update: had a glass on NYE 2012 and must say, with developed beer taste buds, this is exceptional. Mind-blowing. So much better than I remember."
"It's hardly a beer-like, but - wow - it sure is wonderful! Glad I had a chance to try it!"
"Finally found my notes for this one... one of those legendry beers that mostly lives up to its name. Into a snifter glass, pours black, viscous, no head, no lacing, no carbonation, just a thick black liquid. Looks dangerous. Aroma is strong, and I mean strong. Heavily bourbon, vanilla, heavy fruits, maybe some oak in there if i can sort it from the bourbon, very intoxicating, delicious. Taste is on the verge of overpowering, can't imagine going more than a snifter full of it. Mirroring aroma, heavy on the bourbon, really more like hard alcohol than beer, complex and fierce, but refined in every sense of the word, smooth and warm in the mouth. This beer is the answer to all those Boston BrewCo bashers, like the Jaguar wing of FordCo."
"Rich. Satiating. A true sipper!"
"My Utopias was a 2003 - I don't know what the other people on this sight are talking about with their Utopias ""MMII"" and ""MMIII"" because they are not listed that way on the Boston Brewing Company websight. Anyway, I was lucky enough to come across a bottle of this stuff for free! Oh, but it was no accident by the way. So, it poured a nice copper with no head (not carbonated) smelled and tasted at first like a cross between tawny port and single barrel Bourbon. Repeated tastings narrowed it down to a monster strength J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, or a 10 year tawny, but with more burn. I shared this out with five other friends. We had all we wanted, and dumped the rest out the window (not kidding - it was free, and we had our fill). It tasted marvelous for a beer, but just standard for a good tawny port I bought for a quarter of what this thing originally retailed for. Why go out of your way to pay 120 bucks for something that tastes like a good 35 dollar bottle of port? Oh, because it was free (for me) that's why. Still - an amazing beer."
"Drinkability...Try it if you get the chance, I would again, but this is not a beer one drinks on a daily basis. Definately something special."
"Drinkability/Overall: an amazing experience that I am glad to have had a chance to partake in. Truly blurs the line between beer and spirits. Distinct and refined, this is the sipper of all sippers. Worth the money for a bottle? Not for a starving college student like me, unless I won the lottery, wherein this would become a staple in my liquor cabinet."
"Now, I've heard people say, ""whoever spends $106 (or now $150) on a bottle of beer is crazy."". Well, they may be right. But ya know what, I worked hard for that money I spent on this beer. It is like no other beer I've ever had, or will have in my life (unless I get another bottle, which is definately not out of the question). It's an experience. Some people go to strip clubs and drop $500/night for something they won't remember the next day. I spent $106 on something I'll remember for rhe rest of my life. Personally, I think it's worth it."
"I like how Sam Adams can still demonstrate a huge set of balls when they want to."
"Dark amber pour with zero head. Immediately after smelling the question arises, is this beer or sherry? Smells like a good oloroso sherry with aromas of dried apricot, burnt sugar, vanilla, prune, maple, hazelnuts. The flavours on the palate follow through with a little more of a boubon overtone, and more than a little heat on the finish. Absolutley fascinating!"
"Much thanks to hero27 for graciously sharing."
"Sippable and enjoyable, I would enjoy more of this if it was free again."
"Dark, dark, dark...no head but with high abv..who cares. Smell had distinct bourbon notes. This has the texture of an after dinner drink, syrupy, smooth, alcohol, but with a malt kick. Naturally, with a syrupy quality, the mouthfeel is chewy..mmmm. Natgurally, this is a sipper...smooth for the extreme abv. Evereyone should try this at least once in their beer tasting lifetime."
"It is very similar to a fine brandy, cognac or even scotch in the way that it is sipped slowly and for longer duration of time. I find it difficult calling this a beer - but, as it is I would highly recommend trying this if the opportunity comes your way."
"A final note: I can only assume that the cask conditioned sample I had yesterday would be completely different from a bottled sample."
"Sampled from a cognac like pour at the Sunset Grill and Tap in Allston, Massachusetts. Copper colored with no head. The nose is sharp and extremely alcoholic if you take a big sniff very close to the glass, but if you sniff from a bit further away and use the wafting method, an unbelievable range of aromas comes about, including caramel, vanilla, mocha, maple and hazelnut. Rich, diverse range of flavors, very similar to the aromatic descriptors above. The alcohol is huge, but I didnt find it overwhelming in any way, but well hidden."
"I got the privelege of bringing a bottle to a rather high end tailgate party this past fall. Yeah, I know it's $150 and that scares a lot of people, but they only make 8000 bottles for the entire world, it comes out once a year and it's 25% abv. It pours golden-amber- brownish with a light ring around the top. This ""beer"" drinks more like a port or fine cognac with a certain level of ""burn"" on the lengthy finish. A real treat if you ever get the chance."
"I was bracing for a sharp alcohol bite, but didn't get one. It started to bite, but the maple and caramel flavors covered it well. Very sweet, kinda smokey. Seems like a cross between a tawny port and scotch, maybe a little thicker. Couldn't drink more than about 2 oz. Bottle comes with a screw top so it will keep for a while."
"I have been looking forward to trying this beer for a long long time and finally had the chance recently. Pours a golden color with no carbonation to be seen anywhere. The aroma is very alcoholic, but lends way to something that reminds me of a tawny port. Very strong vanilla, cherry, and some wood character. Extremely complex. The flavor has all kinds of stuff going on. Starts out with a caramel and cherry thing then melds with the vanilla. The alcohol is obvious, but it's not overbearing like I expected. This beer is extremely easy to drink, surprisingly. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is surprisingly good for such a high abv."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, slick and sweet. It's 25% abv but there's no harsh alcohol burn to be found here, making it easy to swirl it around your mouth and really enjoy the flavors of each sip. This is really quite tasty and an enlightening experience to show just how far the limits of beer can be pushed. The high price tag will keep me away for now, but maybe someday I'll be able to snag a whole bottle of this for myself. Kudos to Jim Koch and Sam Adams for pushing the limits and thanks to blitheringidiot as well for giving me the opportunity to enjoy this rare treat."
"Drinkability is surprisingly high for me. I'd probably buy a bottle if I could find one around here. (Ohio doesn't sell beer above 10 percent or so.)"
"I was glad to have the opportunity to try this (at the brewery -- free, no less), and if I had the extra $$$ I'd get myself a bottle. For now, though, I""ll content myself with memories of this incredible brew."
"Drinkability: Excellent as a novelty beer (TRY THE STRONGEST BEER IN THE WORLD!). Treated like a scotch, this is one ale to savor, as the flavors and aromas have never been repeated (in my experience)."
"Overall, Im glad I got to try this but I dont think I would ever want to buy it. $25 for a entry fee beats $150 for a bottle any day."
"in comparison, is far better and more drinkable than the other strong beers i've tried, such as Dogfish's WWS and 120 IPA or Sam's Triple Bock. setting the record for alcohol content while making an enjoyable sipper? have to call this one an unqualified success."
"I'm going to let the rest of ths elixir sit right where it is until Christmas *next* year!"
"The taste is sweet, but not overly so and has a concentrated maltiness to it. There are also flavor notes reminiscent of molasses and maple syrup here. The finish, at times, is dominated by hot alcohol notes that make the finish reminiscent of rum. Actually the more I think of it, the more apt the rum analogy is; there are lots of molasses and fermented cane flavor type notes here. The flavors are so concentrated that they are almost overwhelming, some of the notes I can't seem to pick out. I do get notes of vanilla, lots of caramel, and toffee brittle."
"Last swigs: Is this worth the price? NO!!! Is Jim K. a genius at marketing this stuff? YES!!! Props goes to Jim K. He made a good awl-kee-hawl beer and people actually are stupid enough to shell out $100+ ducats to taste it. What a belly holding laff! Should you seek this. Naw, but if it falls in your lap, check it."
"If you have money burning a hole in your pocket and can find this great brew, I'd say go for it. You can always split the cost with a few friends like I did. That way you won't feel so guilty when you're staring at the gorgeous empty bottle."
"Pours without a head and no lace. Crystal clear deep amber color, no carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is a strong alcohol. Starts sweet, with serious alcohol overtones, taste is a cognac/brandy, lingering alcohol aftertaste. Is this a beer?? And how can you compare to others? Its bottle #1776 for me, very expensive and really DFH World Wide Stout (18-23% ABV) at $7.95 tastes more like a beer. $100 for 24oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"This is one of those beers that you can sip and ponder life. A hundred bucks for a bottle is something you spend on wine usually, but I am sure glad someone else out there was willing to spend it for me."
"Drinkability-Considering the alcohol content it was surprisingly drinkable. You could taste the alcohol so if you don't like hard liquor you may not like this. As mentioned before this is NOT a session beer. The label describes the best way to drink it, and think it is accurate: room temperature (we chilled it too and I preferred it chilled) in small (1 or 2 oz) portions."
"How many samples of this did I drink at the Jom Koch lead tour at BBC in JP..at least 4 or 5. Why? Cause it was unbelievably tasty. Normally I shy away from these huge alcohol beers, but this was surprisingly drinkable. Where do we start. First, it looks like cognac in the glass. Good start. Secondly, while the alcohol is very very evident in the aroma, my impression was of a good reposada tequila: some spice, maybe some cinnamon, definitely enticing. Tastewise it is surprisingly sweet, aka, no alcohol burn, which is why I was able to drink so many samples ;-) A very smooth drinking beer, there's a lot of different angles of sweetness here: maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, even fruit sweetness from raisins. Add a bit of butterscotch in the finish. I really enjoyed this one, and kudos to BBC for this tasty, sipping brew."
"This beer can simply be had no other way than sipping. The 3oz. I had was enough to enjoy, and a good, albiet very different beer."
"Pretty color (from what I could see- it was a SMALL sample) and smelled of maple, vanilla... sherry-y. You can smell the alcohol, but it's not overpowering. Taste is... amazing. Cognac comes to mind. Sweet, but not too sweet. The alcohol was sneaky and warming. I expected to be gagging and coughing after one sip, but I found myself really enjoying it. I sipped and savored. Couldn't do too much of this- like cognac- but I enjoyed my little snifter of it. I would have it again, cerainly- for free, of course."
"If you ever see it around, I would pick up a bottle (at $180 I know it's rough) for special occasions."
"Sherry is the flavor that dominates here but lets break it down a little. Roasty caramel, vanilla, hints of black currant and oak. Alcohol is a bit pronounced but not as much as I would have expected. This beer is refined and sophisticated, not rough. Lightly sticky in the mouth with a dry finish. A sipper to be sure but a tasty one."
"Drinkability- Just a bit of this was good enough for me. Good stuff best had as an after dinner aperatif. Thanks Pete for the chance to try this wonderful brew!"
