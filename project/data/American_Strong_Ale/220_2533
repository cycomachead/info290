4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a pretty mahogany brown in color with about a 1-finger foamy beige head. A good amount of sticky lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the glass. The aroma is of burnt brown sugar for the most part. The taste is pretty much the same actually with some roasted malts also with some spice. You really don't taste the alcohol in it. It will hit you after awhile though. Goes down pretty easy but is more of a sipper kind of brew then say, a chugging for sure. Not really much of a bitter or harsh aftertaste, or is the brew talking? ;) Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. You aren't drinking more than one of these at a sitting at all Overall, I liked it.","BeerWithMike","Feb 26, 2015"

4.27,11.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a gorgeous clear reddish brown body with a half-finger of off-white head. A very appealing looking rich strong ale. Scents of rich malt, caramel, dark fruit with notes of plum, red cherry, prune and raisin, candied, liquor-soaked fruit and fruitcake. Cherry predominates the fruit aromas with a bready malt aroma also present and hints of brown sugar. Overall impression of aroma is of a sweet, rich, malty beer with a nice rich fruitcake-like aroma lent by the alcohol and the profile of the fruity esters. Quite nice and very appealing as a Winter ale. Flavor begins sweet and malty with notes of caramel, sweet bready malt, fruitcake, cherry, raisin and prune. The middle opens up flavors of alcohol and light chocolate malt flavors. Finish is medium-sweet, with notes of alcohol and dark fruit, with further notes of fruitcake and preserved fruit, but with a light bitterness from roast and toasted malt lending a roasted malt and slightly burnt toast flavor and hints of dark chocolate. Aftertaste is lightly bitter with notes of alcohol, dark chocolate, black coffee and roasted malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very malt-forward, dark fruit heavy, sweet initial flavor, giving way to a bitter finish that keeps the beer from being cloying. Very nice, warming and pleasant, a good ale for a cold Winter night. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with medium-light carbonation and a sticky, rich feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good strong ale, warming, rich and full, but not overwhelming. Overall this is a fantastic strong ale. It has a wonderfully rich and sweet aroma that is a wonderful mix of malt and esters. This carries over into the flavor but is aided by roast malt lending a richer, deeper, darker flavor. The mouthfeel is a nice balance between rich and full, and modest and drinkable. A very fine ale all around and well worth drinking.","Auraan","Jan 31, 2015"

3.94,2.6,4,3.75,4,4,4,"1 pint, 6 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a deep amber that reflects almost red if held to the light. Head is dark brown and small. It recedes quickly with no lacing. Smell is a bit muted but I get bread, caramel, toffee, and maple, maybe a hint of vanilla. Reminds me of a old ale a bit as it warms. Taste is malty and toasted with some rich caramel and maple coming through again. Some sweet dark fruit in there that reminds me of raisins. There are some bitter hops on the end but just enough to clean up the sweetness that presents in the middle. Finish is dry and slightly bitter from the hops. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and sticky but doesn't linger. Dangerously sippable given a 9.1% ABV. Overall it doesn't blow me away but I can't come up with any glaring flaws either other than maybe the nose could be more prominent. A very nice American Strong Ale worth a look.","Mcwill51","Jan 20, 2015"

The beer is clean with no particles or sediment floating in the body. A big malty palate with a malt spiciness that suggests cola and anise and yeast driven fruit flavors, primarily plum or other dark red fruit. A big bitter finish answers a malty sweet beginning. In the end, malt, yeast, hops, and alcohol come into balance. A pleasant alcohol warming on the finish hints at the amount of alcohol in the beer. The beer is big and chewy, almost oily, with a moderate carbonation.","pat61","Jan 09, 2015"

Compared to a lot of Strong Ales, this actually pretty light: certainly not buoyant, but thinner than many, and less dark in its malt-profile and color.  Somehow "Hairy Eyeball" seems apt—but I'm not entirely sure I can articulate how.  Mostly, however, it's just very drinkable for a big-abv, malt-sugary ale; and—while it's definitely the stuff of chill winter-eve drinking—it hits its marks and does its job.","OrestesMethuon","Jan 06, 2015"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light chocolate, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, dark fruit, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light chocolate, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy hop/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, dark fruits, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome American strong ale style! All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malts, dark fruits, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 12, 2014"

3.84,0,,,,,,"Aroma is full of caramel malt and floral hops, with booze and hints of citrus. Toasted, nutty notes pale in comparison to the sweetness. Fruity specialty malt and dark notes of raisin and fig are reminiscent of brandy. Flavor reveals a fairly sweet caramel malt backbone, which begins with contrasting vinous notes and finishes exceedingly bitter. As it warms, notes of chocolate and lightly roasted malt add complexity, along with nutmeg and ginger in the aftertaste. Very interesting brew, but lacks a bit in depth of malt character.","barczar","Dec 02, 2014"

Not much head but as it fades into a partly cloudy condition with faint lacing on the side, it will linger and give you pretty formations to grok over. Amber to red appearance with a sort of plum to dark cherry nearly currant kind of fruitiness that perks up as your mouth gets over the alcohol burn and residing mid level bitterness. Long for pucker that does not really recede. This is a sipper of a beer that would probably handle getting some barrel treatment eerily well and turn that 9.X abv up a notch and fill in with staves of goodness.  This would probably cellar like a beast as well and give you a really nice barleywine towards the first cold snap of 2015.","MostlyNorwegian","Dec 02, 2014"

Color was a Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium. The first thing that I noticed after taking a sip was the intense fusel alcohol heat. The second thing was the extreme fruitiness and maltiness that came right behind it, reminiscent of a holiday fruitcake.

The first sip packs a wallop - strong alcohol content paired with a rich, creamy taste that keeps you sipping. There is a subtle hoppy background. Delicious to the last bubbly drop. So far this is my favorite beer of the few I've had. I would drink it over and over again. Very well done from Lagunitas.

Sweet malt, brown sugar, raisin and fig aromas with boozy notes in the background. Full bodied with tangy, assertive carbonation through the middle and a semi-dry finish. Sweet bready malt, dark fruit, fig and raisin flavors up front. Tangy, lightly spicy hop bitterness through the middle. Definitive booziness toward the end as well. Finished with a semi-dry feel and lingering bready malt and  herbal hop bitterness. This was excellent and, to me, drank a lot like an ale version of a doppelbock.","IronLover","Jul 05, 2014"

More sweet malt with very mild piney hops followed by medicinal tones and a very sweet finish. Some late tobacco and vanilla aftertaste. More syrupy feeling than I typically enjoy, but the correction for that would turn the medicinal tones astringent. It's no Arrogant Bastard, but very good nonetheless.","MacCherry","May 23, 2014"

3.77,-1.8,4.5,3,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours a deep, rich mahogany with hints of rich amber, ruby, and brown. The beers with a head of medium sized, off-white/nearly-yellow bubbles that sit a healthy fingers width above the beer once they settle down, and leave a nice medium width lacing along the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is nearly too dark to see through, but is crystal clear and clean of any sediment or particles. On the nose, the beer smells tamely of toffee and caramel malt. There are touches of biscuits and rustic bread thrown in, but overall the nose is subtle sweet malt, which is surprising given the ABV. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet, nearly cloying, with a fizzle of hot booze on the edges. Dark fruit sweetness is very prominent from the malts, and subtle acidity does work its way into the corners of the mouth, but bitterness is subtle to none-existent in the mouth. In flavor, the beer begins as rich toffee and bread malt, working its way towards oatmeal bread, then caramel. Sweeter caramel and booze enter towards the finish and carry a middling-length finish of raisin bread and caramel, almost like a bread pudding. The aftertaste is light, spicy booze and sweet malt caramel. A touch of stale bread runs across the palate. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of medium in body, with a middling carbonation that does put a nice tickle on the tongue. Mouthfeel is crisp, slightly syrupy, and a bit prickly. When the beer leaves, the mouth is left sticky with malt sweetness and a little river of saliva in the cheeks. Overall, this is a nice simple strong ale/barleywine/old ale/what is the difference between those styles, really? This beer treads on the maltier side of the tracks, and carries a supreme drinkability, which is dangerous given the ABV. It doesn’t hit me over the head with any intense or decadent flavors, but merely provides good flavor and warmth to the belly. This is a perfect sipper after dinner, as it will not weigh the belly down too much. A nice beer.","Maxwell","Mar 02, 2014"

3.85,0.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bomber into a goblet. This dark ale is a reddish brown color, not quite opaque but dark, with ample tan head. Aroma is dominated by malty toffee notes, with a light fruitiness like apples, a hint of chocolate brownie, and some hop resins that serve to offset the heavy sweetness. Unlike many Lagunitas brews where the hops lead the way, this is a dark malt bomb, rich and quite sweet, although the hops still lurk in there to provide a resinous bitterness. Tastes like burnt brown sugar, raisin cake and toffee, with these sweet baked flavors co-existing with a dark fruit undercurrent that evokes prunes and sourish cherry juice. I also get some herbal licorice root. Quite boozy as well, some fusels to help you remember that this is a big brew ... Pace yourself. Body is unexpectedly on the thin side but the sugars and hop resins do coat the mouth. Finish is long and lingering like most Lagunitas brews, with a fruity undercurrent like in the middle section hiding beneath burnt sugar and earthy bitter hops. Gives me a decent buzz and the low level of carbonation enhances this problem. If I am forced to compare, I prefer Lagunitas' hop-centric offerings and the alcohol is aggressive, but I did sign up for this and it remains one of my favorite winter ales. Put this shit in those casks around St. Bernard dogs' necks, damn the spirits.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 10, 2014"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, dark fruit, brown sugar, nuts, and molasses. It tastes like dark fruit (raisins, plums, red grapes), caramel, nuts, grainy malt, toffee, molasses, and some light hops and booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky, but also smooth and easy to drink. I liked this brew, but then I've liked most if not all of the Lagunitas beers I've had. $5.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Jan 19, 2014"

Subsequently it smooths out a bit. The taste is dark caramel. brown sugar, syrup, it could a have a nutty presence but is shy and a spice character that's heavy. The drink is slow and sluggish and it does not travel the palate well. The carbonation is not enough to lighten the sticky syrupy body. The finish is a slightly bitter, a hodepodge of spice and sweet fruit and a reminder of that alcohol and some warmth. Astringent int he finish and a bit flat . overall it lacks luster and courage. It's unctious,and a bit cloying. I think this is just ok.","utopiajane","Dec 30, 2013"

Medium head, firm but collapsed quickly. Dark roasted malts, linger on the palette. Alcohol whispers through the hint of fruit. The near sweetness of barleywine but not quite. Do I taste oak? Close, it muses with the barrel but never delivers. On glass down, the frozen fog outside does not seem quite as cold. A very good winter tale.

3.44,-10.4,3.75,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a brilliant reddish brown color with a decent sized creamy off white head that shows moderate retention and a fair amount of lace. An almost artificial smelling fruity nose with lots of grape, cherry, and tangerine. Brown sugar, caramel and hints of yeast esters play supporting roles. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is quite complex actually. Sweet and sugary up front mixed with grape dimetapp and a hint of wet cardboard. A hint of earthy hop flavor mixed with a bit of alcohol comes through next as do some quad like yeasty flavors. Lingering dark sugar drizzled cherries long after each sip. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Odd brew for sure, it took me a bit to figure it out, and it was somewhat drinkable. Probably wouldn't seek out again, but glad to try it.","johnnnniee","Dec 11, 2013"

A bit syrupy, little to no head, dark brown color. Very nice toasty caramel malt smell, creamy mouthfeel, but a little too much umami/soy sauce for my liking in the aftertaste. The taste is very fruity/biting though, reminds me of Ninkasi Total Domination IPA that way, with the combo of a little grapefruit-like tang and dark umami malt. Overall a good brew, but not really my favorite style.","bsonk","Dec 03, 2013"

4.02,4.7,4,3.75,4,4.25,4.25," The taste is great, lots of malt layers with subtle toast and an almost bready yeast underneath the slight fruitiness with a hint of dark sugar and a mild pepper-like taste up front which is a bit of alcohol taste yet there is a mild pine flavor which I am guessing is hop derived. The bitterness level seems to present itself more as it warms with a nice chewy malt flavor and slight dark caramel taste coming in later. The alcohol is very mild in the taste..I only noticed it halfway into the bomber, but it enhances the flavor I am sure since there is a fresh raisin-like element that adds to the light roasted malt flavors. I would drink this again for sure since the value for such a quality beer at a great price is usually a no-brainer. I consider this one of the better strong brown ales I have had recently.","Slatetank","May 25, 2013"

Big, malt-forward aromas of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, booze, and some residual hop bitterness. Something like a cross between a Barleywine and a big Brown Ale. Taste is similarly malt-heavy, with more sweet toffee, brown sugar, and caramel, some roasted nuts, baked brown bread, and some slightly grassy hops. Very signature of a Lagunitas brew. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall a solid stab at a maltier beer from Lagunitas. While I enjoyed it, I doubt I'd pass up a Little Sumpin' Sumpin' for it.","jsanford","Aug 04, 2012"

I think it tastes so much better than is smells. Really smooth and creamy for a 9%er. Yeast flavor it similar to other Langunitas beers, floral and fruity.

Up front a big dose of malty sweetness that was reasonably well restrained. Hops followed in a feeble attempt to breach the malt and then fell back after an initial rebuff. Malt rebounded and carried through the finish with a bit of a watery aspect. There was a consistent metallic note throughout. Overall, the effect was that of a barleywine that needed to spend some time in the gym.","Brent","Oct 26, 2011"
3.94,2.6,3,4,4,4,4,"If you imagine beer styles on a spectrum, this would be somewhere between winter warmer and barleywine. This is a malty ale: toffee, raisins, some wintery spices (cloves, nutmeg, ginger), and a hop presence that feels almost a DIPA. Oily, medium mouthfeel. This is a good brew fresh, but I've sat on a 6 pack for almost a year and feel like the malts really took over and put the hops in their place.","nsabo","Oct 12, 2011"

3.96,3.1,4,3,4.5,4,4,"According to the bartender, they intentionally age several of these kegs for months to see how they develop. This particular keg was aged for nine months (proper gestation, sounds to me). It pours a deep ruby-brown topped by over a finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises light raisins, light figs, wheat, and mild biscuits. It's all kinda weak and nondescript to my 'strils. The taste holds notes of figs, light roasted malts, raisins, dark wheat, brown sugar, cinnamon, toasted biscuits, very light wood, light orange rind, and very light bitter coffee. Damn, is the stuff all over the place (in a good way)! The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry-ish finish. Overall, a very solid brew, one that clearly blossoms with age.","TMoney2591","Sep 09, 2011"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"A cellar temperature bottle is poured into a pint glass. A large tan foamy head looks really good. It rests atop a dark ruby colored liquid with plenty of rising carbonation. I can smell caramel malts as I pour the beer. Getting up close and personal, I can smell brown sugar, alcohol, and some mildly oily hops. It smells good. I can taste why this is a strong ale; both the hops and malts are big and bold. Brown sugar, caramel, plum are all present. Bitter hops come in as I swallow and linger on, along with some alcohol. There is a bit of burn as I swallow and some stickiness throughout, but it is still a good mouthfeel. I like this beer. It's a pretty good strong ale. I would certainly pick up another bottle if I come across one.","ToasterChef","Sep 08, 2011"
3.8,-1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This one poured out as a reddish brown colored ale. The head was white and foamy looking and leaving just a touch of lacing behind on the glass. The smell of the beer is a little sweet and a little fruity, it's got a little bit of everything going on in there. The taste is kind of the same way in my opinion. I'm not sure exactly what they're going for here but it's interesting. The mouthfeel was drinkable, decent carbonation and nicely balanced. Overall I'd like to have this one again one day just to give it another shot. Perhaps I'd enjoy it even more the second time around.","Knapp85","Aug 31, 2011"

4.27,11.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and fascinating in both taste and texture.

3.98,3.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a deep, dark, vibrant and clear blood-ruby coloring that almost looks brown in dim light. The brew starts off with a thin (half inch) yet solid and dense head that is biege in color, and this slowly settles out into a film that is barely coating the top. Aromas remind me of a barleywine...delicious and rich. There is a darkly sweet molasses backbone to the smell, with fruits blended throughout, such as cherry and plum. Some very slight spicing and hops are noted deep into the aroma, as well. Flavors are rich, but on a slick and lightly oily body. The flavors have a bit of coffee in the background, as well as bittering hops, both of which balance out the heavy caramel sweetness and dark fruit characteristics. The aftertaste is rich in the caramel sweet, and slightly cloying, making the finish slightly bittersweet and rich, as well. There is a slight linger to the finish, but the flavors keep this from being overly unpleasant. Decent brew.","GarthDanielson","Jun 28, 2011"

This beer is much different and is much more palatable. This beer is a little on the mild side for the style as far as palate sensations go for this style, but overall it is clean and well presented.

3.91,1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good American Strong ale, it kind of reminds me of a cross between and American Barleywine and a Dopplebock. It had Ok balance but I felt like a little more floral hops would help this brew out a little, I always felt like all in all Lagunitas is pretty generous with the hops but this one was for sure all about the malts, some may call it a malt bomb. As with most of Lagunitas high gravity beers the alcohol was evident but still nicely subdued which makes for good drinkability, but the sweetness of this brew would prevent me from having more then two. I could see picking this up when I am in the mood for a really malty beer, and for the price it is a pretty good deal, like all of the other beers I have had from them. If malt forward beers are you thing then this brew won't disappointed. This was another good beer from Lagunitas, if they make a bad beer, then I haven't found it yet.","StoutHunter","Jun 01, 2011"

I respect Lagunitas for putting this beast into a decently affordable six-pack. I only bought a single, would not buy a 6-pack. Too boozy for me, but for about 10 dollars, a six-pack of this would floor you. I respect this beer, do not love it.","VelvetExtract","Jun 01, 2011"

This is a malty, sweet beer in the vein of dopplebock. Caramel, honey and notes of toffee with herbal, spicey notes of hops with some hints of nutmeg and dark fruit like raisins and fig.

I initially get overly sugary molasses with a tad bit of chocolate. Lots of dark fruit flavors with a bit of alcohol. Flavors are not blended together very well IMO. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a big beer. Drinkability is fair. This is not my favorite beer from Lagunitas.

As you drink, the lace makes rings around the glass that stick there and forces you to wash them out. At first sip I thought I was getting an alcohol burn on the tongue but it's the hops asserting themselves with bitterness. The flavor given off by the hops is resinous pine and that adds to the feel of mustiness or tobacco, but less so than what you get in the nose. The malts add some molasses which goes in with the mouthfeel. This beer clings to the lips and coats the tongue in an oily sort of way. There's a lot going on in this beer and it doesn't all seem to work all that well together. The hops are adding more bitterness than flavor and the malts don't deliver enough of a balancing sweetness. Balance would satisfy the style standard for an English Strong Ale. The Brewers' Association does not offer one for American Strong Ales. BeerAdvocate is no help, referring to the style as a "catch-all". So I'll rate it against the English style and continue to complain about it not being balanced.","Naugros","Mar 14, 2011"

The smell is the only thing from this beer that lacks at all, but not too bad as hints of alcohol and slight resiny hops come through. The taste is huge and robust though, hitting the palate with a big bold flavor of creamy malts and crisp hops that is balanced perfectly by a coffee bitterness that finishes the taste off. With a creamy yet crisp mouthfeel, this beer is good for most people who like a good strong beer without being overwhelmed by the alcohol flavor. It's there, but only as an afterthought despite being 9 percent. This makes it surprisingly easy to drink but beware because it packs an unsuspected wollop.

I find the taste for this one pretty jumbled and not quite complementary -- at first sip you're greeted with a rush of sticky sweet brown sugar and honey, which is countered with tart grapefruit. Notes of prune and red fruit finish off the palate. The beer has a medium body with a slight silkiness.

There is still a noticeable hop presence, however, it is in the form of a rounded bitterness on the tongue, and a lively bite in the finish.

Pours to a nice translucent deep red brown with a thin tan head. Taste of this brew is complex. It starts with a chewy roasted malt base and progresses to a black licorice flavor with a molasses and anise slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is extraordinary. It starts almost syrup thick then zests ion the middle with carbonation and thins (not overly so) but still sticks to the ribs. This is a perfect example of this style and a very delicious brew. This brew can be very sneaky at 8.83% ABV. This beer is also an extreme value as a six pack sells for less than most four packs of equal or lesser quality. Keep up the good work Lagunitas.

I thought the depth of flavor, re malt profile balance between caramel and bread, and hop profile, more aggressive bitterness on back end, tilts scale toward the Eyeball. On drinkability, though, a this ABV you better be careful. I certainly prefer the tap version to this bottled version, but as few kegs as I've seen of this in Beervana, I'm lucky to have scored this bottle. The big question is whether this will cellar well.

After that i pick up some piney hops. The flavor is big and malty. Prunes, dates, over ripe apples all come through. Brown sugar with just a little bit of chocolate. The hops really fade out of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, leaving a caramelized brown sugar flavor soaked into the palate.

I usually froth on the palate but I choose to roll this around and I get some different sweet flavor profiles, dried fruit finally comes through, bubblegum even. This is certainly a strong ale and I got a case of this along with a case of Brown Shugga' so let the high gravity times roll!

Mouthfeel is round yet crisp, trending dry, with a bit of a grassy medicinal aftertaste. Lagunitas is striking a pretty fine balance line here. The label indicates 56.7 International Bittering Units pushing up against an 8.7% Alcohol by Volume brew, yet there's not much of a bite from the hops nor does alcohol make much of an impression save that feeling of well being.

There is also some dark fruits and spices and a bit of earthy hops. The taste is medium toasty/sweet/roast malt with some dark fruit and earthy hops. Some alcohol in there for sure but it is tolerable. Grassy hops on the palate too with high bitters. Some winter spices and brown sugar in here too. Mouthfeel is medium body with low carbonation. Heat is too much for me here. There is a decent bitter coat. It needs more carbonation and cream and less heat. Drinkability is OK.

In the mouth it's full-bodied and heavy, pretty much squats on the palate. This even with credibly strong carbonation. There's more pine and mixed white citrus here, however, the smart money is still on the toffee, chocolate, caramel and honey flavors. The fruit as in the nose half raisin and date, half plum and cherry. Its cloying qualities make it pull up short rather than extend through a longer finish.

On the light bodied side, very sweet taste to it. Sort of took me by surprise but it had a nice mouthfeel to it. Very hoppy but well balanced with the sweetness.

There's a good hop bite mixed in along with some more dark fruits. Mouth-feel is a bit creamy at first with some dryness working itself in over time. It lies just between medium and heavy. A slight shake foments a small and quick bubble blast, indicating a low level of carbonation. The alcohol becomes more evident as the drink warms.

It was quite thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a nice malty scent and a clean flavor, but wasn't as sweet as expected. (Perhaps it would sweeten with age?) The wild/sour flavors also didn't seem to fit. It had a very nice full body, and was fairly easy to drink despite some alcohol being noticeable.

Tastes of malts and hops, balanced so perfectly; flavors of nut and chocolate make me wonder if this beer is the spawn of a porter and a brown ale. Only the tiniest bit of sour and alcohol pulls through each sip. The mouthfeel is what is unattractive for me. Medium carbonation is just fine, but the beer itself is light, water and even thin. An exceptionally easy beer to drink overall--it's like the nearly 9% alcohol stayed in the bottle during the pour!

Was expecting that same flavor of cherries but it was lacking a little. Very woody and caramel flavor with little bit of a bourbon(very light) feel. Malty backbone came through for a good balance with a clittle bit of citrus hops. Mouthfeel was fairly slick and oily but not over the top. I enjoyed this beer and it certainly didn't feel like 9%.

Smells of dark, alcohol-soaked fruits, vinous, caramel and molasses malts, red berries, nuts, and maybe some sweet cookie batter. It has a pungent flavor of vinous malts, pecans, dark fruits, grains, caramel/molasses, and citric/piney hops that deliver a fairly high bitterness.

3.85,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"12 oz stubbie. This one is a fantastically deep amber color with crystal brilliance. There is minimal head that stays around as a light patch hovering over the brew. I'm not seeing any bubbles working out of solution in this one. The aroms is full of incredibly deep caramel sweetness, with a strong pine resin hop and a potent alcohol spiceyness added in. Everything about the aroma is big. The flavor brings a strong bready character that moves to a caramel-soaked resinous pine hop. The hop moves from a peppery sensation after swallowing the brew to a fairly strong bitter bite on the sides of my tongue. The bready character of this one is really strong throughout the drink. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very mild carbonation. This one actually feels like it is pulling moisture out of my salivary glands by drying the lateral portion of hte back of my tongue and under my tongue. Interesting feeling. I find that I really have to slow down on this one from the strength of the bready flavor and the hop along with the drying feeling I am getting. It is nice, but this is one that needs time to dissect.","kmpitz2","Jun 29, 2007"

The aroma consists of a lot of caramel, some sweet and roasted malts, and a touch of hops. Very sweet, rich aroma. As for the flavor, it has quite a bit of sweetness like the aroma suggests. You can taste very sweet caramel, fruits, and a bit of alcohol that is followed by a quick hoppy bite at the end. Very similar to a barley wine. The sweetness tends to overwhelm the other flavors towards the bottom of the glass. The mouthfeel is thick and oily with little to no carbonation. Definately a full-bodied beer.

The taste is sweet (a bit sticky), with a good dose of bitterness. You can easily taste the alcohol in this one, as well as some toasted malt.

It only had a small skim of white almost tan colored head of foam that fizzled away into a few white/tan foamy rings and a trace of spotty lace. The smell was very fruity at first. I'm not too sure what kind of fruits were in that jumble. After that there were some notes of raisins, brown sugar, very little toasted malts, and it ended with a pinch of sweet citrus hops. The taste was slightly sweet with a touch of toasted malts, raisins, brown sugar, grapefruit, and it decided to end this taste with a big bang of alcohol soaked dry citrus hops. If you decide to hold the beer in your mouth, the alcohol soaked dry citrus hops keep getting stronger and stronger until you're forced to drink it down.

The smell was much more enticing than the looks, as I detected honey, orange marmalade, and strawberries. There was also a noticeable spiciness from the hops as well a whiff of alcohol. The taste was even better than I had anticipated from the smell. I was expecting a sweet malt bomb; however this beer was actually quite well attenuated and balanced. There was sweetness there of course, showing up as apricots, toffee, and brown sugar, but the herbal bitter hops were quite bracing, and the overall the taste was more dry than sweet. The mouthfeel was a bit abrasive, but with some age, I think this would round out for the better.

2.34,-39.1,4,2.5,2,3,2,"Pours out a rosey purple brown body with a 1/4" head that fizzles down to a thin layer of foam. Some head clings to the glass in scant patterns. First smell I get is a bit like rotting oranges. What follows is straight up sweet, darker malts, alcohol and a bit of citrus hops. When I taste this, i basically get a barrage of sweet malt body, piney hops, bitterness (quite bitter for a 50-something IBU beer), and a finish that is medicinal in the amount of alcohol. I can pick out some flavor as the aftertaste lingers, which is a blend of chewy dried fruit and pine resin. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit slick. Mild carbonation. Yeah, I don't really want to drink this all that much. I remember liking this a couple years back. Kind of nauseating now.","goochpunch","Jan 26, 2007"

The smell of roasted malts was very pleasant, along with a sweet fruity aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, caramel and coffee with a hint of fruit. Not overpowering on the alcohol.

Aromatics come on strong with a great malty profile full of raisins and dark chocolate with some mild herbal pine hoppiness evident also noted was a minimal tart character that I was getting. Flavor is strong and assertive just like an American Strong Ale should be, some malty bready caramel malts with more fruit soaked ripe alcohol notes but finishes with a solid bittering pine hop flavor...definitely comes off much more hoppier in flavor than the smell was letting go, this is probably due to less finishing hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied somewhat mild syrupy texture even carbonation carries it well so that it doesn't stay coated on the palate.

Lots of big bubbles. Foamy head like the brush at the carwash, stained a light shade of brown from the beer. Big time carmel and chocolate malt body; no residual sweetness, just lots of malts that finish dry. Hops provide a good kick, but not the regular C-hops; I'm having trouble picking the varieties out but they're delicious, maybe one high-alpha and lots of aromatics in there.

Semi-thick feel on the palate, coats well, with good carbonation. The flavors are nice, but perhaps too intense for some, as with the alcohol.

The body is way to thin for a beer of this potency, though the alcohol is not overwhelming.

Carbonation is almost zero, but the lacing on this is incredible. Smell is currants, plums, dark cherry and a hint of alcohol. Similiar to Double Bastard but less alcoholic. Taste is smoooth, a huge punch of sweet malt that is punched in the head by the 56.7 IBU's. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste and only manifests itself through the pleasing warming after it goes down. This beer is dangerously drinkable even at 9%.

Lightly buttery sugar cookie and raspberry hints upfront in aroma are accompanied by mellow notes of sugared biscuit and dark toffee. Restrained and well rounded aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a toothsome combination of strawberry tart and dark lovibond caramel. Bold, yet winsome hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness aptly. Mid palate nutty brittle and biscuit malt flavors surface agreeably, adding malt depth and extension to the dryness facilitated by the hop bitters. Understated woody and lightly floral hop flavor persists throughout. Nearly full bodied, but at a low enough viscosity to permit effortless sipping. As the beer warms, hints of red apple esters complement malt derived sweetness. Finishes with a surge of cuspate hop bitterness and trace vanilla notions fleeting quickly. A rather delicious brew that sits dangerously softly on the palate.

Some fruitiness follows, sort of a cross between rum soaked raisins and maraschino cherry, but always with a spicy, alcoholic edge.

3.5,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I tasted this beer because I like a lot of Lagunitas beers, but moreso because of the ingenious name. It pours a dark red with very little head development. Swirling the glass brings more of the foam out, but it dissipates quikly. The aroma is full of caramel flavors along with a non-descript hop scent and a bit of a cinnamon roll scent. The flavor is very malty with a light hop bitterness at the end. It feels and tastes a bit sandy on the palate with nores of cotton candy and sweet fruits and banana. Overall it's a decent barley wine but it really didn't spark any great desire to have it again. Being an English Barley Wine it is not surprising that the hops are a bit more mellow than an American Barley Wine.","BrewMaster","Jan 08, 2005"

4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep ruby color topped by a creamy tan head. In the aroma I get notes of crystal malt, and a hint of citrusy hops at the end. Aroma has notes of toasted/ biscuit malt as well. Wow, a smooth creamy body greets my tongue as I take the firs sip of this beer. It is lightly sweet up front and finishes with a fruitiness that reminds me of raisins. There is a slight bit of bitterness in the finish, just enough to provide a foil to the maltiness that is the center-point of this beer. This beer is a very nice, well balanced beer. It is so smooth and well integrated. If you like malt accented strong ales witha bit of balancing hops, then this beer is for you","Gueuzedude","Jun 15, 2004"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"22oz Bomber, No Date Poured a deep amber with a thick head. Raisins in the aroma along with yeast, doughy malt and caramel. Full body that is smooth and soft. This one's got alot of malt in the flavor. The hops are bittering it quite a bit but not pronounced in flavor. Not a bad thing though, flavor is solid. Malty and a slight fruitiness with lots of hop bittering. Lagunitas is a major league player. One of the best out west in my opinion.","BierReise","Apr 02, 2004"
4.38,14.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Noisy, dark yellowish tan, crusty head. Dark, dark red-brown beer. Deep fruity, hoppy, tangy, caramel/toffee nose. Huge hoppy, alcoholic, buttery, grainsy front. Chewy, chewy, malty middle. Some chocolate, not too sweet. Roasty, grainsy, bitter finish. Alcohol warming. Man, I like this beer a lot. It's a nice, big malt (but not too sweet), big hop badboy.","kbub6f","Mar 29, 2004"

4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"22 oz bomber bottle. A lovely rusty mahogony colour with a nice white/off white head of thick white foam. The aromas are a bit subdued, but very malty in nature. The hops are in there as well, but they are in the background a bit. This smells sweet and boozy, with some lovely roasted malt notes as well. Nice. The taste is very full. Malty and sweet up front with a distinct roastiness as well. The mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy/chewy and the drinkability is damn excellent. Man, is this a good brewery or what?","francisweizen","Mar 08, 2004"

4.67,21.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle cellared one year... A dark mahogany body reveals orange and ruby highlights when held to the light; and it's creamy light tan head slowly erodes to a wide collar without leaving behind much more than spotty lace. The nose is rich with caramel, molasses, piney hops, light spice and wood. It's quite refreshing, and reminiscent of a crisp fall evening under the stars. It's medium-bordering-on-full bodied and just slightly zesty in the mouth before warming to become creamy and smooth as its very fine carbonation "pillows up". Caramelized brown sugar and light spice dominate the rich, malty flavor before a splash of alcohol becomes apparent. Some softer notes of caramel and nuttiness follow in the finish. Resinous, piney hop flavors are present the whole way through, but shine in the aftertaste. Exceptionally well-balanced and highly drinkable despite its strength. A most wonderful holiday meal beer or nightcap!","NeroFiddled","Oct 20, 2003"
3.7,-3.6,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Dark amber color, medium head. Full bodied "Christmas" Ale. Deeply roasted malts, chocolaty. Fairly hoppy. Good balance. Full flavor, somewhat spicy. No alcohol bite despite a 8.8%. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is chocolaty and slightly bitter. Interesting beer.","beerguy101","Aug 28, 2003"
2.81,-26.8,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"The flavor is very much as the nose foreshadows. A vinous, non-descript sweetness vaguely resembling some non-existent brown fruit dominates the beer. This flavor, which reminds me of the aftertaste left in my mouth when I eat too many raisins, thins into a sour stickiness in the back of my mouth. Several consecutive sips leaves me with the sensation that Ive just finished a flat, alcoholic Dr. Pepper. Its odd, because I really WANT to like this beer, but like Brown Shugga, it just falls short. I tasted it twice because I was so dissapointed with the first one, I wanted to be sure before reviewing it. Its un-complex, non-malty and kinda sour. It tastes like a beefed up New Belgium 1554 or a high gravity Kostritzer. Theres no roastiness and no toastiness from the obvious use of darker malts. The 56 IBUs lend neither any hop flavor or aroma, and dont even really do a very good job of off-setting the sweetness of the non-fermented fermentables. This is a very average strong beer, since its very hard to achieve this little flavor with this many raw ingredients","TXHops","Feb 27, 2003"
4.5,17.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark copper color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a heavy and sticky lace. Nose is sweet caramel and molasses with some milder notes of pine and fresh citrus. Medium to heavy in body with many layers of flavor. Taste is sweet roasted malts at first quickly followed by other sweet notes of gingerbread cookies, dark caramel, spice, and a touch of fruit. More bitter flavors of pine resins and grapefruit rind then begin to take over setting up a bitter finish of raw hop leaf and a hint of citrus. The hop oils create a slick feel in the mouth throughout, and the alcohol begins to become more apparent as the beer warms. A great beer with a great name!","Morris729","Feb 07, 2003"

4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours an intense ruby red with the head pretentious in its size, the texture frothy, and the lace a thick sheet to occult the glass. The bouquet of toasted grain, sweet caramel, light brandy tone also present, seems more like a "Barley Wine" than an "American Strong Ale". Front is malt, somewhat sweet; the top is medium in feel, mildly acidic with the hops perky in their spicy bite, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting a real "Belly Warmer".","Gusler","Dec 29, 2002"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"I've got to give this one style points just for the name . . .  Seriously, though, I agree with the first reviewer that this beer is reminiscent of Stone Brewing's Arrogant Bastard.  It looks similar, and the same smells and flavors are there, but they're just a little more subtle (perhaps except for the hops).  Pretty reddish-amber color, good tan head that retains well.  Maybe a little less balanced than AB, more towards the citrusy hop side than the malt side.  A very good beer with a great name (for what that's worth).","BKotch","May 17, 2002"
4.97,29.4,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Copper and red hues.  Fabulous aromas of prunes, brown sugar, and rich malts.  Complex and 'juicey' mouthfeel.  Full bodied, slight abrasive hop coarseness.  A one of a kind.  Delicious, delightful, a delicacy in beerdom.","Jordan","Apr 12, 2002"
