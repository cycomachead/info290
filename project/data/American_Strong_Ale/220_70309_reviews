"I love this beer. Its something that warms you up when its cold outside, but gives you that sigh of relief when you have had a hard day to. Not something that you would really want to drink more than two of at a time because of strong flavors that can ruin a palate if you want to drink or taste anything else for the next few hours."

"O - Bursts of sweet and spice, malt and hops. Wonderfully bold and hearty. Enjoyable, but a bit too sugary sweet and I reached my limit on sweetness halfway thru."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"all the sugars mellowed out completely leaving it with an almost woody flavor, which is awesome because my biggest complaint with it right of the shelf was that it was way to sweet and really hard to drink. still a bigger fan of the mondo red. but if you come across an old bottle its def worth grabbing and letting it sit a while."

"Lagunitas comes through again with a beer that is full flavored, hoppy and reasonably priced...way to go!"

"A simple review would be to say the Lucky 13.alt is another excellent Lagunitas beer with the trademark big hops with a touch of sweetness, but that’s too easy. The Lagunitas Lucky 13.alt is an alternative take on their Lucky 13 Imperial Red Ale that pours a dark dirty blonde with plenty of hops in the aroma. The initial taste was like biting into a big juicy grapefruit that kept my mouth watering and wanting more. There was a light malt on the end that adds a lingering sweetness, but it was the big sweet grapefruit flavors that kept me coming back."

"lagunutas crafts a wide array of ales and this one is most unlike their other efforts. not an everyday beer, but this is perfect for the pale/ipa drinker that wants to mix it up a little. get this in the mix instead of that IIPA."
""
"The body is medium with a certain thickness and it's a tad clunky, maybe a little slick and somewhat lacking finesse. I think Lagunitas was looking for the ""beer is good because it's strong"" people. Overall, though, it's better than a lot out there."
""
""
""

"Overall, a very respectable American Stron Ale, very unique in its color and taste compared to the traditional bunch (e.g., Arrogant Bastard). Would be interested to try a double ASA version of this. My favorite is still Double Bastard."
"O: This is quite enjoyable. It doesn't look or taste much like a blonde ale, but it disappeared pretty quickly. Recommended."
"O: Overall a good beer, but if this one has had the malt turned down versus the Lucky 13 I'm almost worried to try that, although the original's alcohol is a bit lower. Given the nose, the palate/mouthfeel are just a bit too much and I think the hops could be bumped up a bit to add a bit of crispness to the thickness"
""
""
""

"Poured into a pint glass."
"O- A pretty tasty example of the style and I'll have another, please. A good price helps. ;^)"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great looking beer with drinkability at 8.8% abv."
"Overall it's thick, flavorful, and interesting. I would consider it more of a novelty beer to be enjoyed occasionally than an everyday drinker. You've kinda gotta commit to this one when you pop the cap."

"Overall- A rather sweet but tasty, none the less, IPA with an easy drinking style. While not quite up to the traditional Lucky 13 it was an interesting take, and is well worth the try if you get a chance."
""
""
""
"Another nice beer from Lagunitas. This would probably be my end of summer, beginning of fall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I taste a lot of orange and citrus hops, defined by a midpoint bitterness and held together by a pleasant caramel malt character. There’s a malty sweet finish. A beer big enough for the hop head in me, but malty enough for those who shy from the lupulin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely an interesting beer that does not seem to fight into any style very well - I like the presence of the hops and the alcohol is fairly well hidden. This is a big beer and is much more of a sipper than an easy drinker."

"O: Great beer. It smells great and tastes better. I love the balance between the bitter citrus hops and bready sweet malts. I would have liked more carbonation."

"In short a very very good beer. Highly enjoyable!"

"Overall - Great for its type I am sure. Not usually my preferred style but I'll try any Lagunitas. I suppose if you paired it with the right food it would be better suited, but I like a brew that is able to stand on its own, so that's how I judge them."

"Really liked this beer. I really didn’t even know what type it was when I bought it and found out home when I checked Beer Advocate (hiding the rating with my hand of course). Another good beer from Lagunitas."
""
"O: This beer held up really well. I'm surprised and happy with this bottle. A great beer by itself but as an Imperial Blonde, this was awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a golden light copper with a little over a finger of foam. Not too bad of retention, equal lacing. Tiny suspended shards of yeast cloud the beer, interesting, gives an unfiltered look, doesn't detract the score much. Maybe the bottle's just old. Smells pretty good, spicy hops with a good citrus undertone. Caramel malts with a touch of alcohol all come together quire nicely. Taste translates well, spicy caramel hop resins having the most flavor, followed by the roasted malts. Not much of the citrus as in the smell, but is definitely detectable. Everything balances nicely, very enjoyable. Body is good too, crisp and dry with a medium body. Overall really good, not very familiar with the style but it seems pretty hop dominant for a strong/imperial blond ale, which is good news to someone who drink mostly ipas like me. Glad I picked this up"

"Not great. Honestly, I think this beer made me a little sick."
""
""
""
""
""

"My first strong ale, a catch-all category as indicated on BA. I don't care how it looks...an IPA, I guess. Smells malt forward and sweet and maybe some floral hops... Taste is, whew!, sweet, and roasted nuts and ripe fruit...the malt backbone masking some middle hops. Interestingly, as the sweet wears off, the hops that were once hidden seem to come forward a bit. Mouthfeel is ok, and so is the carbonation, and the mouthfeel, is more on the DIPA side of syrupy, but not too much. Overall, too much malt for me...wishing that the hops were up in volume. Still fun to try."
""
"-Overall 4.0: Falls slightly short of 4.5, but is an excellent brew. It really takes you on a swirling journey of all the things that make beer great: hops, malt and...magic. I would recommend this beer if you can find it. The 8.8% ABV is completely unnoticeable and as this baby is so sessionable...hope you have tomorrow morning off from your job as a brain surgeon. BUY IT!"
""
""
""
"O: Excellent brew. Great combo of the hops and malt, and enough alcohol to make it interesting. I’m a fan."
""
"O - A rather pleasant easy drinking Strong Ale. Lagunitas makes some good sweet beers and this one lives up to it. One worth picking up if you like a sweet imperial beer that is nice and citrusy. I did find this beer enjoyable but it had a weird alcohol flavor on it. Wish the alcohol presence was not so noticeable because it distracted from the other great flavors. Oh well, Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One of my favorite Ale's of 2012. I highly recommend this one. (May release)."
"OVERALL: This was a really nice brew. The nose and flavor don't really match here, as the hop aromas advertise a totally different ride, but that's not to say the ride itself wasn't an enjoyable one. A beer I'd defintely drink again. Thanks again for sharing Doops!"
""
""
"O: I can't find any fault with this beer, really. The quality and craftsmanship are there, and it's certainly tasty enough. I am personally just not moved by it. In my mind there's just a ""been there, done that"" type of feeling as I drink this. I'm not sure if it's just me, but every Lagunitas beer seems to have the same ""house"" taste (especially in the hop profile), and I just get bored with them sometimes. That's not to say that they're bad beers; I thoroughly enjoy them when I'm in the mood. I just wish they'd venture out and make a beer that's more of a departure for them, maybe take a risk every now and then. Maybe I'm being a little unfair. It's still a fine beer and well worth a drink."
"O: Loving it! Would order another and buy again. What a deal lagunitas bombers are, $4.49! Alcohol comes through late in the first pint. Not sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm not too incredibly ""wowed"" by this one, but Lagunitas has my respect for pushing the boundaries of what a quality American strong ale can be. If they worked on the yeast attenuation a bit more, the alcohol % could get a wee boost and (more importantly) the overall sweet character could get a much needed reduction."

"a big sweet ipa. it pours clear brassy color with a small white head that doesnt last long at all. it smells like hops and caramel malts, tons of residual sugars, and a fair bit of alcohol. it tastes really hoppy, and i would certainly categorize it as such. the hops are fresh and sweeter, and the malt adds even more sweetness. it sticks to the teeth and feels like a cavity waiting to happen. the aftertaste has some bitter bite to it, but its too little too late in my opinion. medium body and mellow carbonation, but the feel is ruined by the sugar. its worth it for 5 bucks a bomber, but it isnt anything special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is amber with a hint of gold. Head is relatively light and disappates somewhat quickly to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Mouthfeel is ok. Smell is heavy hops despite just a 60 IBU. Sweeter malts and sugars help enhance the hoppy flavor which I get mostly spices from. Citrus is present maybe from grapefruit."

""
"Pours a mostly clear amber color with a slightly off-white head. The scent is yeasty mixed with citrus and malts. Taste is bold and delicious. It is a mixture of sweet malts and bitter hops creating a unique blend that finishes slightly dry. Smooth, refreshing and fulfilling for an overall great beer."
"Not too sure about this one. Well-made but straddles the line between a barley wine, a DIPA, and... well, I suppose the flavours are kind of alt'ish. Worth a try."
""
"A really good beer, i was surprised by the big malty note. But i think the hops complemented nicely. A fairly unique beer that i think worked overall."
"O: Good beer, kinda makes me think of a barleywine , delicious."
""
"O: Not many breweries do these West Coast-style hop bombs like Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
"and I like their alternative...try it and see if you think I'm crazy. If you do, all I can say is, you are taking the same position as my wife, my boss, and a bunch of other people you wouldn't want to be on the same side with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful brew, well worth a pickup. Good mix of style elements, wonderful to drink."
""
""
""
"A real craft brew, Lagunitas always delivers!"
""
"It also continues Lagunitas' tradition of being able to finesse rather voluptuous beers into very slim-fitting attire. I suppose, given the label, such an analogy is appropriate. As the beer gets fully warm, its bosoms begin to spill out a little. But the Blonde cannot be faulted for that."
"O: THis is just a great beer. I have bought this probably 20 times and it never gets old. I just wish this beer was year round."
"O- I can't believe it took me song long to pick this up for $4.99! I'm an idiot! Lagunitas is oneof those brewery's that I often overlook for no good reason. Almost everything they do is damn good! Gonna grab a few more of these before they dissapear!"
""
""
""
"O-a decent strong ale, but needs a little more balance for me"
""
"O - A great brew with nice drinkability at 8.9%"
""
""
"Overall, not as good as I remember when I had it on sample. Still a solid beer that I don't believe benefits from the high alcohol content."
""
"A very luxurious beer, and at the time dangerously drinkable. Well done."
""
""
""
"Will pour a five+ finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear copper/amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Citrus hop nose and flavor is citrus hops and caramel, very similar to a double IPA. $5.79 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
""
""
"O - It seems like the more I drink the hops fade and the biscuit comes through. It's like an imperial pale ale."
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable big beer. Malts, hops, and alcohol are big but balanced."
"Overall pretty good. I liked most the taste. full of flavor and the sweet malts were definitely offset by the bitter hope. Not my favorite Lagunitas brew, but definitely one to enjoy as a treat once in awhile. Can't see myself drinking more than 22 oz.'s of it, though"
"Smells of crazy citrus and fruit hops and caramel malts. Taste is fruity citrus and mango hops with slight malty sweetness. Its not as complex as I hoped but still tasty. Although I'd compare it more towards a malty DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious! The first time I tried this beer I really liked it. I have had it several times now and each time I try it I think, ""yeah", its still that good. Perfectly balanced! Thick and creamy, somewhat sweet malt is balanced by the 60 IBU hop fest."
"O: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, well-disguised strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer with a lot of flavor and substance worth drinking for a long time."
"Great beer. I'd recommend this to any IPA drinker looking for something big."
""
""
"O- Who doesn't like a Lagunitas Bomber for 3.50? They make great beers for a very affordable price, that are easy to get. Happy Birthday Lagunitas, keep the good ones coming."
"O: Good beer indeed."
"Not my favorite Lagunitas brew overall, but it fits into their portfolio quite well. A good hoppy strong ale (their M.O.), though personally it's a little too sticky to want more than one."
"O/D-I assumed this was an Altbier because of the name. Turns out this was a beastly hop-laden ale. I really loved it. Not the best Lagunitas, but definitely in the upper tier of their brews. Big, brash, bold and beautiful. Oh, and bitter."
""
""
""
"a great beer for the value but i believe there's so much going on here in complexity that it all ends up blending together and you don't even realize it."
""
""
""
"A nice twist on their already excellent Lucky 13. Pours a honey color with superior lacing. It's got a noticeably citric taste with a nice hop bite. The alcohol starts sneaking into the picture after a few ounces, but not in a way that makes it hard to handle. Never theless, it is strong and I found myself perfectly drunk downtown on a hot summer's day thanks to a bomber of this. An odd afternoon to be sure, but mostly another great beer from Lagunitas."
""
""
"O: Another home run for Lagunitas in my books. I hate buying bombers, but Lagunitas makes them super affordable, and this one is definitely worth the $4.99 I paid for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like the Lagunitas description of an extra pale ale moreso than American strong, but this is a tasty beer regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle, pours pale amber/copper with a fluffy off-white head that holds good retention and leaves excellent chunky lacing down the glass. Aromas are fruity, grapefruit rind, floral hops, caramely malt, toasted grain. Tastes are juicy grapefruit, pineapple, mango, tropical, biscuity, finishes slightly bitter. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, smooth, ample carbonation. Overall, I was disappointed to see they changed Lucky 13 from a red to a blonde, but this beer is exceptional either way! Excellent balance, excellent complexity, fresh and vibrant."
""
"Overall- Happy 13th anniversary Lagunitas. These guys never disappoint. A brew that is well executed and balanced. Defnitely worth trying and getting a bottle of."
""
""
""
"O- Coming from me, another killer brew from Lagunitas...a brewery that 'can do no wrong' and definitely worth searching out. After this, I've got to revist Undercover Shutdown, as I haven't had it over a year..."
""
"O: this is delicious, beautiful use of hops an malts, everything is deliciously rounded and well balanced, deffinatly grab one of these when you get a chance."
""
""
"Overall - Tasty, and flavor-wise offers a little bit of everything. A little more like a hopped up strong ale, has good balance, and not overly sweet. Very affortable price, and a quailty beer, worth a drink for sure."
"Poured a lovely orange colour, but anything good I have to say ends there. It smelled like a pine forest that just had all of it's bark gashed open with pine sap dripping out. It tasted like more of the same. It had some sweet characteristics, but was mostly just astringent and pine-like. Anything else that would have been present was completely masked by the pine-flavoured hops and the astringency. This stuff was terrible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good. Distinct flavor."
""
""
"Overall, very pleasant. Nice tasty version of the style. Minor flaws are just that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste wise it's solid and not mind blowing, but I love everything else about this beer they did a great job on this one."
""
"Overall this is a pretty good DAPA."
"Overall: Another very solid brew from Lagunitas. Very good citrus hop taste."
"Overall- Alright, but something of a letdown after the aroma. Booze is under wraps, but so is just about everything else- it's not bad by any means, but very plain. Fine enough, but in the end, it's a pretty generic Lagunitas brew. I'd probably pass on it in favor of one of their other fine offerings with more punch."
"One note: I'm not sure why this is under the category of ASA... I'm thinking west coast diipa."
""
""
""
""
"The amber colored body was clear, and the head was foamy, and two fingers thick. The aroma was laden with tropical fruits like papaya, mango, and guava. The taste was not quite as sweet as the aroma hinted at. I got a more bittersweet, bready taste, rather than the tropical blast. The alcohol was warm and up front. The body was medium thick and somewhat astringent. This was a nice IPA/DIPA, but somewhat more interesting malt choices would have improved the beer."
""
"Overall, it's very well made and tasty, just doesn't leave much of an impression. Not disappointed that it's a one-off. Maybe I'm being harsh, I did enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"High B-"
""
"O: Good beer, well worth whatever it was I paid for it (like $4 or something). Would be really good with some smoke in the air while working the grill/smoker in the heat. Summer brew victory for Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel on lucky 13 is a medium build and is not to thick. It's easy to take down and not overly sweet and not boggled down with malt. This one is good for a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good and very tasty beer. Worth a try."
""
"T - Lagunitas does it again with this fine strong amber ale. I can say without hesitation I will return to this many times over at a measly $4 a bottle. Bravo!"
""
""
"At first the taste was all hops (dank and citric), but it gets more sweet and bitter as you progress through the beer. I like how the dank flavors and mango/pineapple work together. Theres so much going on upfront and late, that I almost had trouble finishing it. Too much going on to drink it."
"Pretty good brew with some nice hop intensity and a good malt backbone. It reminds me a bit of some American Barleywines."
""
"Beautiful glowing amber golden body forms thick 3 fingers worth of head, slightly off white. Fine even lacing intricately left behind as the head dwindles, or after your first few sips. Aroma has an intense tropical fruit, pine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit blasts of hops, all sugar coated with a nice malt backbone peaking through with a kiss of alcohol reaching the nares. They make some big beautiful beers, this has a wallop of hop flavor well blended malt sweetness and soothing alcohol which all goes down extremely easily with each sip. There's up front sugar from the malts, a bit of warming alcohol, but then there's a well blended hop orchestra of mango, grapefruit citrus peel, pine cone, and straight up dirt as in earthiness. Really well blended flavors that don't become cloying by any means, extremely easy to drink for a beer this huge. Resinous but not too oily, slick just to lubricate yourself and your palate, even carbonation nothing cloying...damn good. Overall feelings, I love Lagunitas and this is proof that they need to build their Chicago plant sooner than already planned, it can't get any fresher or more affordable only 4.75 to 6 bucks at the highest in a beer store around my parts."
"Well done and well worth a try. Seek out if this should become available in your general area."
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice and hopy bitter beer which hide it's abv very well."
""
"O: A good beer and very well balanced, I enjoy Lagunitas they make some good brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh bomber into a duvel glass. Pours a clear orange amber with 2 inches of off white head that shrinks to coat the top with ok lacing. Aroma is pine, grapefruit, oranges, bread, and faint lemon. Flavor is tangerine, biscuit, caramel, leather, mild grapefruit, and some lemon. Thin mouthfeel and well hidden abv. Nice beer."
""
"Atmosphere is good. Nice hue, solid foamy head, and fair lacing. Nose is a full and strong combo of bread and sweets. Flavor is pungent and bready, with an indistinct and unexpected, but prevalent sweetness. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
"I think overall I pretty much like it. The bitterness is harsh and grows and sneaks up on you, but the beers a sipper anyway. Not too deep or complex but definitely unlike anything I've ever had before."
""
""
""
"After a year away, I'm still a fan. A good solid dose of hop goodness with a nice full sweet malt bill to back it up. I'll continue coming back to this when it's available. "
"I have yet to find a beer from Lagunitas that hasn't been exceptional !! This doesn't disappoint, grab one of these when your looking for a big ale, and you will enjoy tasting brewing perfection.."
"I really enjoy Lagunitas, and this is one of my favorite. The beer is a nice straw color and has a decent white head. You can really smell the citrus hoppy goodness, and the taste is spot on. I am glad that the hops are overpowering, and the malt really can stand out. I will be buying up more of this seasonal where I can find it."
"O: A solid drinking beer. Hops are prominent but malt flavors are lighter than a traditional dipa. Recommended if you love hops, not recommended if you love blondes."
""
""
""
"A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty delicious beer, but is it really all that different than Lagunitas Sucks, Wilco Tango Foxtrot, Imperial Red, and even Lil' Sumpin Sumpin? All have that dominant sweet ruby red hop character, and only minor variations outside that. I love the flavor, but can we try something different now?"
""
""
"Overall I still really like this one. The balance between the bright bitter hops, sweet tropical malt, and strong alcohol works well."
"O: Great showcase for Lagunitas' hop usage, but doesn't really seem that different from a DIPA to me."
""
"Overall this was a nice offering to sample on draft but nothing I need to revisit anytime soon. A solid Imperial Red Ale in that the alcohol is well masked from the smell and taste and the hops are fairly solid but not overly bitter. Well balanced and would be great anytime of year, with or without food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Medium bodied. Complex with a decent balance. I really enjoyed the complexity with all the citrus, honey, hops and malts. Cheers."
""
"Overall a good but not great Lagunitas beer. Lead by example; enjoy your life."
""
""
"hazy orange body with a fingers worth of off white head rises and settles rather quickly leaving next to no lacing. smells of tropical candy, sugar, hops and bread. taste is very similiar to the nose. lots of candied sugars and hops. mouthfeel is thick and chewy with the high level of sugars. good carbonation and some hop bitterness on the finish. overall this isnt my cup of tea, too sweet."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. A pretty different American Strong Ale with some nice fruity flavors that belnd in and feel balanced."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear orange amber, half finger white head that slowly dissipated into a ring and nice lacing. Great aroma of herbal and piney hops, light malt and tropical fruit. Flavor is nice sweet and caramel malt, light fruit, brown sugar. Nice hop kick at the end. Very well integrated and balanced. I'm not sure this a traditional alt, but it tastes good."

"Love this stuff here. A tremendous effort from Lagunitas; awesome flavors and full chewy mouthfeel. Another winner from this world class brewery."
""
"two finger thick off white head which leaves nice lacing, on top of a cloudy golden with crimson hues body. musty slight noble hops like aroma with mild citrus note. Flavor is very much like an IPA with a musty malt and hop flavor on the front end and nice pine finish. subtle grapefruit note inbetween. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Becomes more drinkable as you go and more like an IPA. Overall a good beer that I would have again."
"22 oz. bottle into 9 oz sample glass. Pours dark amber color with a decent size head that does not dissipate quickly. Malty smell with hints of citrus and hops. The beer does taste a bit ""heavy"" (like alcoholwise) but this should not be unexpected with a ABV of 8.9%. The taste of the alcohol is a little overwhelming at first, but the tastes of citrus and hops do come out later. The beer, while a little bit of a slow start, goes down very smooth once you get past the alcohol feel, and a good beer for those hoplovers out there."
""
"Overall: This is 8.9%? What?! I feel like I'm drinking a session here with the balanced character, but there is just enough bite to keep me wanting more and focused on the flavors which seem to keep changing. A very nice and very surprising beer."
""
"Is this an alt? Blonde? Strong ale? Related to Lucky 13? Who cares, it’s another Lagunitas aroma hop bomb and that’s enough for me."
""
"Overall - At first I was a little disappointed with the flavours, but as it warmed up a bit in my glass the hops and the sweetness really came out. It's got a nice nectar like flavour that keeps you looking forward to the next sip. Lagunita's is quickly becoming one of my favourite brewers."

"Call it a blonde ale; call it an IPA; call it what you want. This 13th anniversary ale is tasty stuff, and at $5 per bomber, the price is very right."

"O: Let's be honest, this fits the winter months in the same way Tim Curry (present-era Tim Curry, by the way, not the sexy bombshell we remember from Rocky Horror Picture Show) fits into a speedo. And while it's more IPA than impy blonde to me, it's still an incredibly enjoyable, almost world-class brew that was a great value to boot ($5 for this?! HELL YES). Get it while you still can!"

"O - This has good drinkability. The flavor is nice and goes down easy. I would have no problem having a few glasses of this. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It is like a red ale and IPA all in one. Another solid beer from Lagunitas. Check it out."

"Aroma is hoppy...birght, citric and minty. Flavor is mostly juicy tropical hop flavors. Body is actually fairly thin and there isn't much of a malt presence here. Alcohol is quite minimal as well for an 8.9% beer. This is a solid effort."

"Overall: Not a bad beer at all. I would but it again...if you like bitterness and the scent of taste of pure ""hopness"" this is for you. Not your smoothest ""blonde"" ale...I would like to confirm with Lafunita's if this is an actual blonde ale or in reality maybe we are just drinking a ""blonde"" IPA, cheers to all."

"(Reviewed 10/21)"
"I generally like Lagunitas quite a bit. Very solid beers, competitively priced and readily available. It is not very often I have anything to say about the brewery so I do not feel bad when I say that this is not their best work. The appearance and aroma start out strong but the beer goes down hill from there. The flavors are a bit disjointed and the mouthfeel is slightly off. I can certainly enjoy a serving of this beer but it is not one I am going to go back to. Worth a try, you may like it more than I."
"Overall I thought this was a great beer that was very well done. I know Lagunitas loves to heavily hop there beers and this one was no different, I thought the Alt. version went better with the citrus hops then the red version, it was almost like drinking a pretty strong and super hoppyl IPA. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and flavor, the aroma had a real nice mix of citrus fruits, and the flavor was pretty damn good too. There wasn't anything that I didn't really like about this beer but it could have been a little less sweet and sticky. This beer has pretty good drinkability, I don't think I will have any problem taking out this bomber by myself, it seems like this would make a great summertime beer. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a nice hoppy beer and I would recommend this to anybody whole likes an aggressive amount of hops in their beer. I like this beer more then the red version and it is up there as one of the better beer from Lagunitas. Lagunitas makes some high quality beers for a low price and this beer is no different, I have yet to be let down with any brew I have tried from them, they are one hell of a brewing company. Edit, after this brew warmed up a little bit it got much more bitter and harder to finish, so I am taking that in to account."
"Pretty bland. Just some malt sweetness without anything else going on."
"O: This beer has some good elements, though fleeting. A malt-centric brew with some tasty fruit and spice to keep it interesting, this one has only interested me more in Lagunitas’ famous lineup (especially the original Lucky 13 Mondo Large)."
"O - A restrained strong ale, good in all aspects but not a stand out. Enjoyable but lacks some character."
"Rich mouthfeel in this combination malt & hop bomb. Expansive hops & great carbonation explode the flavor! Not overly bitter, but has a really nice slightly dry mouthfeel out back."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I prefer the original Lucky 13, but this is by no means a miss. Another very good offering from Lagunitas."
"Once again I should thank the good folks at Lagunitas for what is a very good beer. A beautiful amber color with a creamy white head. Strong citrus aroma, with grapefruit and pine both dominating the wonderful bouquet. The taste is very balanced. The grapefruit and pine are very pronounced, but the bready malts add some volume and create a wonderful beer. Very hoppy, but you also get some caramel sweetness. I enjoyed this beer a great deal. A wonderful strong, big beer."
"Poured this American Strong Ale from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale pours a nice clear amber color, produces an off white head, retention is average, lacing is outstanding. The aroma of the ale is packed with malted grain, creamy caramel and toffee, citrus hops. To die for. This is a medium bodied beer very strong malt backbone, caramel and toffee explodes in the forefront. A sweet sticky brown sugar body gives way to bitter hops, and grapefruit. Amazing Ale!"
"O - Pretty incredible. Excellent balance that surprised me after the aroma. Not as dry as I'd expect with it being just less than 9% abv. The only downside is that it can be deadly with how well it masks the booze content."
"O - A very tasty ale that has the classic Lagunitas hop profile that keeps you craving more. At almost 9%, this stuff is incredibly dangerous given its sessionable characteristics. All day any day is the motto that comes to mind."
"O: I do not understand why lighter-flavored beers get such high ratings on this site, while stronger, fuller-flavored offerings receive only moderate (B, B+) ratings. This brew is incredibly flavorful, creamy, and well-balanced. A serious contender in the Strong Ale category. A solid ""A" rated brew here. No less. After sampling several of their offerings, Lagunitas is certainly making a believer out of me."
"This is a pretty bold, if simple beer. Brash malt and hops collide, but end up blending nicely. ""Balanced"" but not in the english, mild-mannered sort of way. Enjoyed this one."
"Pours a slightly hazed deep-gold. An off-white head/ring clumps around the glass. Smell is very leafy and food-like, like decomposing vegetation. The yeast strikes again! Taste starts off nice and hoppy, melding into smooth malts, that detritus taste again, and high sweetness. Very sweet finish, along with a new wave of pleasant bitterness. A little heat, but the abv is masked well. Very good beer; I like Lagunitas offerings, and this one doesn't disappoint at all."
"O: very tasty beer, but considering the broadness of a Strong Ale I think this one might be a bit more like an IPA or a DIPA. The hops are the star in this beer in my opinion."
"D: For all the alcohol in this beer, it's hidden very well. Drinks nicely, I wish I bought a case."
"A very drinkable brew with some of the notes of little sumpin sumpin."
"Overall a decent malt bomb. Definitely on the sweet side. The peppery spice and yeasty funk could be a little more pronounced for my taste. This one is good, but not great."
"For the ABV this is scary drinkable. Bitter and sweet, the fruity hop character is a nice change of pace. The malt character adds fantastic balance. This is yet another awesome Lagunitas offering."
"O-Picked it up thinking I was grabbing Lucky 13 and came away pleasantly surprised."
"O: Well put together beer, but I would buy this again for the price I have to pay."
"Overall: Honestly I'm not a fan of this beer. I find it a bit rough around the edges and hard to drink. Not recommended"
"Interesting beer. Definitely an IPA style beer. Has some sweetness throughout. Caramel, brown sugar ix minimal but balanced nicely with the loaded citrus hops. Pours golden with some lacing head. Good beer. I would defiantly drink this again. Only knock is again most of their beers have a similar taste."
"For what it's worth, I remember enjoying this on tap a lot more than this bottled version."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and citrus zest. Extremely citrus forward aromas. Taste is also very citrus forward with big grapefruit flavors up front with citrus zest on the finish. Some sweet malt is apparent in the taste as well. Very mild hop bitterness quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a nice level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with awesome citrus aromas and tastes. A great deal for the $4.50 I paid for the bomber."
"This is a pretty smooth offering for 8.9% ABV. The mouthfeel is great, and it is getting better as it warms up a bit. Carbonation is high. Very good lacing around the glass as I drink. I like this beer for a $4.25 Bomber."
"Pours a deep ambery orange color with a quick disappearing white head. Big juicy hop aroma and a hint of apricot jam. Nice mouthfeel with low carbonation.. tastes exactly as it smells... nice and hoppy... but not overly bitter. Defiantly go out and give this one a try.."
"D/O: This beer is practically a re-creation of Lagunitas' spring strong ale, Undercover Investigation Shutdown, full of all-too-common features such as pungent and under-attenuated grain that drowns out even what was likely a robust hop bill. Its signature Lagunitas qualities could be detected by a beer-obsessed shark from three miles away."
"O: Impressive. I was not expecting this from this brew. Nice pick-up BevMo. Happy I purchased the bottle. You're getting better. Still love my locally-owned shop better though."
"O - extremely drinkable in spite of big flavours, warms the insides and makes me smile"
"O - An excellent outing. It's like if Arrogant Bastard got over itself, went to the beach for some sun and realized it didn't have to try so hard in this world, that things are already pretty good as they are."
"Finish is very long bitter grapefruit skin with hints of pine. All around a wonderfully drinkable and consumer friendly brew. This could be a daily beer for me (if I had a daily beer)."
"Pretty decent overall. Kinda reminds me of hopslam."
"O-this is basically an IPA. now i'm aware that strong ale are often quite hoppy, but this just has all IPA characteristics and misses some of those extra flavors found in strong ales. as an IPA, its average."
"O - Solid beer, but they should get rid of the 'alt' tag."
"Very interesting brew. Grade A"
"Mild carbonation. Nice beer, but a bit hoppy for an alt."
"22oz bottle. Orange-amber color. I wasn;t sure what to expect since the label had ""alt"" on it but this was no German beer by any means. It smelled hoppy and tasted like a hoppy strong ale. Overall it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. A very good value for $4 and about what I'd expect. I think I liked the regular lucky 13 more."
"O: Very consumable, tasty, and compelling. Recommended! I liked it and would have one again...and again."
"D - Lagunitas never disappoints me, a very nice brew."
" Big, big hops"
"This is a really nice, easy drink. Not overly complex, but it doesn't need to be. It hit the spot on a late summer night. Recommended."
"I might have liked this if I hadn't ever had a Lagunitas strong ale before, but I have and they all sort of start to run together as just slight variants of the same beer, not that it makes it bad, but its not breaking any new ground either."
"No big departure for Lagunitas, except maybe for that mild, but lingering, herbal character. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I guess."
"A really tasty ale. Smells like fresh pineapple juice with a tinge of maple syrup. The taste is relatively sweet, but nowhere near cloying. There is a nice all-around bitterness that balances out the sweetness. The pineapple was more present in the nose, but still comes through in the taste. There is a nice grapefruit as well. The carbonation is good and the body is medium. This could easily be described as a DIPA and I prefer a little sumpin' sumpin' just a tad more. This is a very impressive ale and I will go enjoy my second glass!"
"The mouthfeel is thick and smooth."
"The color when poured into a pint glass was of a golden yellow, with an orange hue. The smell was the usual piney aroma, but, with a hint of yeast. The taste was of fresh pine neddles, with a hint of yeast and orange citrus. After each sip or gulp, as the ale settled on the palate, the bitter the mouth palate felt. Over all, it was just a touch above average, for my palate. Not what I would purchase again!"
"O: Great stong ale....would definitely buy again...and again..."
"Stared at this one on the shelf long enough: time to buy and try. It pours a clear brass topped by a solid finger of white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, caramel, honey, light maple syrup, and a decent amount of flaky biscuits. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grapefruit and newcoming pine taking center stage whilst the sweeter and breadier notes surrounding them closely, snugly. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, a very pleasing beer with impeccable balance. Good times."
"Sips of malt and sips of hops. A great marriage. Above average mouthfeel. Lasting generous white head on cloudy golden body.Apricot and grapefruit citrus, bread and alcohol. Very drinkable, a wonderful accompanyment to supper. Good for west coast spin on style."
"I haven't had the regular 13th anniversary since I don't like reds. But picked this up since it was nicely priced. The smell reminded me a little of an ESB, but the taste was more of a IPA variation. Another pretty good beer from Lagunitas."
"O: Too bad it's a one-off, it's delicious!"
"All in all very enjoyable, but the 8.9% ABV does come across a little boozy. Many layers of complexity. Very happy with this one, another quality brew from Lagunitas."
"22 oz bottle from ""Habits"" in S.Salem. $3.69 Clear and darkish golden beer with a huge,thick and frothy off white head. Extremely pungent hop aromas,resiny and deeply herbal..some caramel malts also appear. Taste is well balanced with a huge chewy caramel/toffee malt presense and an equally terrific dank resiny hop over load..a titanic clash!..hops win in the end though. Ok on the palate..the two immense competitors meld well. A good beer but not one of Lagunitas best."
"Overall - This reminds me very much of an india pale ale, but a mild one at that. The alcohol is hidden very well. I barely noticed that I was enjoying a 8.9% abv. Very pleased to have had this twice. If I were to see some sitting on the shelf, I would definitely purchase again (especially for $4.49 per bottle), but not look for it specifically."
"O: very drinkable and very dangerous. I enjoyed this and wish I could try the original of the lucky 13. Definitely would like to get more of this!"
"Overall I am not a huge fan of this style but some one who is would like the price point of this beer and drink a lot of it."
"Edit: Upon reading some of the other reviews afterwards, I'm actually going to reiterate this: NOT INTENDED TO BE AN ALTBIER. It's just a high-grav retooling of the original Lucky 13."
"O- A solid beer, definitely worth trying."
" I always liked Lucky 13 as a red but this is a great variation. Not overhopped (though it did seem so at first) like a lot of Lagunitas but a pleasant flavor and an easy drinking big beer."
"\A quick clean taste that really did not have much of a follow though to it. It really kinda was dominated by the cereal grains and earthy bread like malts that drown out anything else that might have been trying to make a run at coming forward. Very smooth with a crisp clean finish. Not a ton of carbnation and the body itself was very light Very nice actually as there was nothing really holding you back from having multiples of this. Low abv and a very smooth flavor with a crisp finish"
"Overall: A really nice brew to celebrate a milestone for one of my favorite breweries."
"Pours a golden amber color with a thin off white head that left plenty of lacing. The aroma is like candy, lots of caramel and juicy, fruity hops. The taste is bitter up front with some piney hops, sweet caramel malt, a little toasted malt, and a bitter lemony finish. The beer is kind of heavy at first but the finish seems lighter, the carbonation is on point and it has a nice dry finish. I would drink this again, seems more like an IPA to me though."
"Overall this beer is enjoyable....they should make this one again"
"22 ounce bottle into snifter. Pours crystal clear orangish golden amber color with a dense 1 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Nice amount of thick lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big pine, orange, lemon, grapefruit, breadiness, caramel, and molasses. Very nice and complex aromas with nice strength. Taste is tons of orange, lemon, caramel, pine, honey, breadiness, and a bit of spiciness as well. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with caramel, citrus, and pine flavors; with some nice sweetness in there as well. Insanely balanced beer, with just the right amount of sweetness, and overall great balance of all flavors throughout. Insanely smooth drinking for being almost 9%, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is basically invisible, only a a slight warming after the finish noticed. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied. Overall, an absolutely outstanding offering from Lagunitas. So much well balanced flavor."
"Oh my I like this brew!"
"Very surprised at this beer, nice hop profile and the bitterness is great. Never knew an alt. could taste like this."
"O - I dare Lagunitas to make a beer I don't like. I don't think they can. This beer is like an American Barleywine ""light"". Not quite as heavy, but similar taste characteristics."
"O - This is a great beer. Maybe one of my favorites. Has a bit of a sweetness to it, but it's balanced well by the hops."
"Pours a deep golden color with a good sized fluffy white head that shows great retention and lace. Aromas of citrus and pine waft from the bottle the second it is opened. Sweet toffee and caramel malt backbone hold this one up quite well. Taste is citrus and pine up front, sweet caramel and burnt sugar pop in for a second somewhere in the middle. The hops take over the finish and dance for a second with a touch of ethanol. The malty sweetness is almost approaching maibock here but the hops are powerful enough to keep that in check. Medium body and level of carbonation. Resinous and sweet sticky mouthfeel. This is nice, I liked it. It's a bit different, but I really enjoyed it."
"Another good beer from Lagunitas. It’s right in their normal wheelhouse, despite the whole alt angle. Pours bright orange with a dissipating white head. Hops are strong and provide a big citrus and spruce flavor. There’s some light sugary vinous complexity, as well, but I’m not sure where it’s coming from. The beer has a definite sugary, candy cane note with deeper caramel sticking more to the background. The mouthfeel is nice and round. The taste starts sweet with lots of delicate hoppiness and ends with a healthy but relatively gentle bitterness. It’s deceptively easy to drink for the abv, and there’s very little stickiness or booze to it. Once again, Lagunitas has made a strong, hoppy and delicious beer. It might run together a bit with some of their other offerings, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less delicious."
"O: I liked this beer, although I would put it in the lower half of Lagunitas beers. I couldn't judge this to style because I'm not really sure altbier, blonde ale, or any style really fits this brew. American pale ale probably fits best (but not at 8.9), but, nonetheless, this is another solid offering."
"Overall: Good and interesting, but nothing spectacular that makes me want to buy this again, though Lagunitas bombers are usually a good price."
"Overall, I liked this. Once you get past the light smell, it really takes off. Wonferful taste!"
"One word to describe this beer, WILD. It's got tons of stuff going on, and it's hop complexity rivals PTE. It's almost that similar build and flavor profile. I'm definitely going to try and get my hands on more of this wonderful beer and try and discover even more nuances."
"O: as nice as I was to split this I almost wish I was more greedy and saved it for myself, I like this, a lot."
"I always look forward to new Lagunitas offerings to get my hands on.Poured into a becker a brilliant copper/bronze with a fluffy white one finger head atop that took its time settling.Fresh malty aromas of bread ans lightly sweet caramel,fresh herbal tones underneath.Again fresh is a good word to us for the flavors,slightly crisp bread and caramel tones with slight nuttininess,of course hops are gonna play a part from these guys lending a gentle herbal finish.If I was from northeast Germany I might have a heart attack over this beer,but Iam not and I think its a great new world ""big"" alt beer."
"Overall, weird, nice flavors though, and i would certainly buy this again, hell im thinking of looking for the extra bottle i bought right now"
"This pours a clear copperish color with a nice slightly off white head. The smell is a little sweet, I get some pine and citrus hops, kind of reminds me of their little sumpin. The feel is thicker than expected, its on the heavier end of medium body. The taste is different than expected, there is the sweetness, lots of caramel and toffee, the hop bitterness is a little off, with a weird after taste (ripe orange peals?) and there is more alcohol flavor and burn than I was expecting (noticeable booziness) This is okay, but I doubt I get it again, little sumin is way better from this."
"Smooth light bodied beer. Easy drinker. Has a sneaky 8% on it. Lagunitas just keeps churning em out. Maybe not a grand slam but i'd be happy to see this beer on tap anyday."
"O: Pretty good beer. Not a hop bomb, not a malt bomb, it has a nice balance. I'm not very familiar with altbiers, but I think this was a good start!"
"Other comments: This is a pretty good beer, but Lagunitas beers all taste pretty similar. Something about the malt profile, hops, and mouthfeel that doesn't seem to vary much from beer to beer."
"Final thought - Why is everything lagunitas makes that is seasonal so awesome? Thank you again, Lagunitas for always making a top shelf product. 8+% and only around $4, wtf?!?!"
"Overall this is tasty but no Altbier. You find new things through experimentation, like North-Western Hops don't really belong in Altbier. As the usual Lagunitas hop bomb this is good for the price, just don't expect it to taste like Altbier."
"Well done guys!"
"D - This is a big, thick and mostly sweet beer. It seems to be a double Alt, almost like they literally took a normal Alt and (since Lagunitas can't seem to do anything normal) just doubled it. The malt is very sweet and completely dominates the beer. If you really look for it, you can detect a fairly significant level of hop bitterness, but it just isn't up to dealing with the hugely sweet malt in this beer. Nonetheless, it is surprisingly drinkable for what it is."
"surprisingly easy to drink for the alcohol strength. Lagunitas continues to impress me with their high quality and good value beers."
"O - Overall a great brew, reminds me of a really good DIPA or a DPA. This was a hit on CASK at Hamiltons Frikin friday 7/29! Rock on Lagunitas!"
"Pours from a bottle into a pint glass a fairly hazy golden amber with a quarter inch quickly fading, slightly creamy light tan head. Aroma is light: floral with slight pine and lemony hints. Mouthfeel is surprisingly medium bodied and dry. Taste is somewhat yeasty, with pine, lemon peel, spices, and slightly grassy. Excellent summer beer."
"Opinion: I pretty much gave my opinion while I went through the flavor. To reiterate, this is a good beer if it were meant to be a balanced DIPA or something. Don't buy it expecting to try anything even remotely coincident with an Altbier."
"O: I'm begininning to think that my taste buds seek out hops. Based on the description of an altbier, I would not categorize this as such because all I taste/smell is the hops. To me, this tasted like a double IPA from a brewery known for their hoppy beers. Just enough of a malt character to give me reason to pause. Not familiar with the style, but I wouldn't think this is a good example of it."
"This si an interesting beer. I don't like it as much as the hoppy red Lucky 13, but this alt is quite good. This purchase was a happy accident; I'm glad I got to try this beer."
"This brew pours a nice deep golden color with two fingers of head. Retention and lacing are quite good. It smells like a Lagunitas brew, to be completely frank. Plenty of ""dank"" citrus hops and alcohol. The taste on this brew is actually quite interesting. It starts out with some aggressively bright and SWEET hops, along with some tropical fruit aspects and sweet grain. Sweet is really the main thing here! There's really not much bittering hops here, with just a little bit of bitterness coming through on the finish, along with some honey flavors. The mouthfeel is solid, it feels just about right, if unexceptional. The drinkability is good, but hampered by the sweetness. Overall, an interesting beer that stands out from the Lagunitas lineup. It's another solid brew."
"I might be jaded by the stream of Lagunitas offerings, each being so predictably similar in character to the last, except that I don't think I'll ever tire of their brand of uber-hoppy, fully flavoured, ludicrously drinkable beer. Nor would I ever want to stop supporting a brewery that offers said ales with such clever packaging at such reasonable prices."
"Pours a mostly clear amber with two fingers of creamy offwhite head, settles to a quarter inch, with a few big clumps of lace on the glass. From the center of my cheapo, non-laser etched glass, a massive, neverending column of bubbles rises. Neato. Smell: pineapple, papaya, grapefruit rind. Honey-like sweetness, lightly biscuity. Taste: fleeting taste of soft melon, then pineapple, sweetened grapefruit, finishing a bit pine-needle-y. Honey + biscuit backing these up. Prickly carbonation is welcome as its fairly full bodied. Whatever style you or I think this is, it's a really tasty beer. Bottled July 7th."
"O: This beer definitely tastes like it is strong—unlike typical altbiers—although for the most part the alcohol is well masked from the smell and taste. The smell and taste are very unique for the style."
"I don't mean to suggest this beer doesn't taste good. Well anyway, I probably should have limited this review to a single figure: ?"
"Overall another interesting beer from lag - btw the brewhouse is awesome!"
"Lagunitas always delivers big hoppy beers at a great price, no difference here."
"Beer is light in body, dare I say thin, with a mild yeast presence, weak on the lead off, and a dry mildly bitter finish, pine hops on the middle. Decent, I enjoyed it and would have it again."
"O: I didn't realize this brew was different than the Mondo Red Ale when I purchased it. This .alt version isn't quite as tasty. It is a little on the sweet side for my liking."
"hmmm, a strange push-and-pull at play here. as the nose suggested, the malt-back is huge - tons of caramels and breadiness; and a pretty good slug of hops on the back end. for whatever reason, i'm not entirely digging the combo. it's a more than adequate beer, but malt and hops seem like two entirely separate events. a bit of a let-down for my well-deserved high expectations of lagunitas."
"O - An interesting brew, and I really wish the hops hadn't fallen off on this bottle. This really surprises me, as I always find Lagunitas brews to hold up really well. Handling issue--who knows? Won't pick this up again, but I'd definitely give it a try on draft to compare, and I'm already looking forward to the next anniversary beer from Lagunitas. Cheers,"
"22 oz bomber from EZ. Poured a clear falt syrupy bronze body with a small tightly foamed brigther white head. Aroma is sweet and syrupy with notes of pine resin, molasses, caramel, hops. Body is medium to fuller with very soft to nill carbonation and no tace of ABV. Flavor of grains, molassess, pine resin, citrus rind, hint of toffee, hard rolls and fruit skins. Solid beer and better then I was expecting."
"D: Lagunitas certainly doesn't seem to have much trouble brewing high-gravity, highly-hopped strong ales of all different varieties, and this doesn't stray far from that successful formula. An interesting mashup of styles - there are elements of an IPA, a blonde, and a strong ale here. A bit of a sipper, but a very worthy brew."
"O: This is a classic lagunitas take on a style. They ramp up the hops and make a terrific beer. This is an imperial American version of an alt. Good beer."
"O - Yet another great offering from Lagunitas, grab this one if you get the chance."
"O - Ehhh. This is a good beer, but I probably wouldn't grab another one. A fairly average...well, I'm actually not sure what style this is. An imperial amber/red? The abv is well hidden and the balance makes it pretty drinkable."
"O: Another good Lagunitas beer, nothing extraordinary though. They got the hoppy beers down pat."
"Overall it is a pretty solid beer. This reminds me of all Lagunitas' beers. Above average, but nothing that blows you out of the water. Solid beer, would definitely drink again."
"Compared to regular Lucky 13, the .alt version is smoother and, well, blonde-r. Piny burst of tropical fruits tastes like every other Lagunitas beer, and the malts do their best to add a sweet, caramel-rich background. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick with a low carbonation level. Lucky 13.alt is more of the same from this Sonoma brewery--a hop-forward, fruity sweet, high ABV beer that you'd have a hard time picking out of their lineup."
"All in all a pretty sweet Anniversary brew. I'm glad I gave it a go."
"O - Quite a surprising brew. This could become one of my new favorites. Awesome and definitely worth seeking."
"Very good American Strong Ale, although it doesn't seem to fit into a traditional Altbier profile, at least with my experience with the style. Particularly enjoyed the aroma. Flavor is also quite good just a little hot for my tastes."
"Drink- I saw it and bought it and was glad I did. Its a new style which seems very close to a DIPA. Id love this on tap at some point. Although Ill take a bottle too"
"Great balance throughout this beer. Nice flavors. Another winner from Lagunitas."
"Shared a bottle of this one this afternoon with schmittymack. Poured a nice golden color with a good finger or two of fluffy white foam. Aromas of pine, grapefruit and maybe mango. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of pineapple, honey and light malt with a linger bitter finish."
"O - Hell. This beer kicks ass. My local bottle shop just picked up the slack by providing this new beer. Very happy I purchased the bottle."
"22oz bottle. Pours a semi translucent bright amber color with a 1/2 inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of malts, booze, citrus and apricots. Some hops and tropical fruits maybe. Pretty complex smell that I'm having trouble pinpointing exactly what I am smelling. Taste is boozey with some grapefruit/citrus/tropical fruits. Malty with a nice alcohol burn at the finish. This beer has some of that typical hoppy Lagunitas flavor but a bit more subdued than some of the other offerings. Somewhat sweet. Drinkable even though it has a boozey taste to it. Again, like with the aroma, hard to figure out all the nuances here. There is alot going on with this beer but I am digging it. Overall, this is a unique beer worth having again."
"This one is well worth checking out. Especially if you like Dreadnaught, as some (but not all) of the flavor profiles are similar in my book."
"O: Lagunitas makes some fine ales, and this was one of them."
"Picked up a 1/2 bbl of Lucky 13.alt as a replacement for a Lagunitas IPA keg that I suffered through. Neither the shop, nor I realized that it was the 13.alt, so it came as something of a welcome surprise. In terms of reviews, the best I can offer is that this brew reminds me of Founder's Centennial IPA and a little bit like Double Dead Guy--both of which I have had on my tap system. I would attribute this to the use of malts to 'mask' the ~9% ABV characteristic. Anotehr well-built offering by Launitas, and one that I'm proud to have on tap at home."
"O: Pretty pleased with this. Basically like drinking a big DIPA with a stronger malt base. Strong hops, good balance, smells and looks delicious. Definitely a winner. I'll have to try to find the brunette version to compare."
"Overall, this is an excellent amber ale. I had the other Lucky 13 last year but I don't remember it being this tasty (unfortunately I didn't review that one). Dangerously drinkable. It reminds me of a Hop Stoopid/Undercover Investigation Shut Down Ale Hybrid: A citrus hop blast countered with a malty-caramel brown sugar backbone. Go get one!"
"I thought I was role playing with the blonde as I have rendezvoused with the brunette before but alas...I see it's another beer with an .alt at the end. Whew! Bomber poured into a snifter I am met with a nice copper colored ale with a foamy off white head with minimal lacing. The aroma is quite nice with red grapefruit, mango, pine and sweet hops. The taste has a nice combination of bitter and sweet on this beauty. Very smooth drink for being this high in alcohol. Light malt backbone. Big bitter aftertaste. Major mouth salivation going on if you are into that. Great mouthfeel. Overall this beer does the style proud. Awesomely drinkable though the taste may get tiresome after one 22 oz. I noticed as it warms, the sweetness shines through. A very well made beer and of course....worth the low price from the Petaluma crew."
"Appearance is a nice golden amber color that has a finger of off-white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is much like a DIPA. Lots of fruity nuances like pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. Fresh and inviting. The taste is very fruity with the pineapple dominating. A stong bitterness creates a nice dry mouthfeel. Medium-bodied and easy to drink. This is more of a a DIPA than anything else. Damn tasty."
"Bottle poured a nice golden amber color with a large white head that lasted awhile and laced nicely. Piney floral hops dominate the smell. Taste is a fantastic balance of flavors. Citrusy sweet and apricot flavor malts balance nice with the bready malts. Slick mouthfeel and medium bodied. Finishes with a smooth bitterness from the hops."
"Overall: As I said, way too similar to Maximus. In all honesty, all of the hoppy Lagunitas beers are somewhat similar for me, but this goes too far. Plus, Maximus is not my favorite DIPA by any means. Ultimately, I still do enjoy it, as I like the signature Lagunitas taste, but I prefer it be better balanced within the beer."
"Pour is good nice foamy head that laces the glass. The smell is so perfect I have no idea what an alt beer is supposed to smell or taste like but I'm guessing its not like this. Scent is the standard lagunitas sweet hop concoction smell mixed with some serious passionfruit and some fresh cut grass. The first sip is a bit of a let down perhaps because I am a fan of lagunitas ipas and this style is not usual for them. A lighter version of the ipa but still good and quite flavorful. Weaker then the scent but unique and a little peppery, hops are great and sweet malt and baked fruit are there. All and all solid but I would rather have a shutdown, maximus or sumpin sumpin."
"A very nice, hoppy beer, that as it warms becomes more balanced with malts."
"Inexpensive for a bomber and prety good."
"Overall, this was a really pleasant and enjoyable beer. At such a great price, I'll definitely be grabbing more of these before they're gone for good!"
"overall this beer is outstanding....they def. need to make this one again"
"O: An interesting and solid beer. I've already tried several of these over the last few days and would definitely buy more."
"With all due respect I don't think this was classified correctly. I have not had an alt beer...but just by reading the description...this ain't one. Tastes almost like a Burton Baton jr., a cross between an IPA and a strong ale. I'm guessing the .alt influenced the classification but don't think that's what Lagunitas meant."
"D - A bomber size is just about perfect for this beer. I will probably pick this one up again if I see it."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Dale's Pale Ale shaker glass. Very hard to get more than half a finger of head out of it. Very big bubbled body (kinda looks like a cream soda). Decent lacing. Smells first off like Lagunitas house yeast. Flowery hops. A little bit of citrus, but not too much-o. Big malt character on the tongue. Some light bubblegum flavors and a nice flowery and citrus-y bite. Nice biting bitter finish. Sneaky for 8.9 I'd say. Not like any alt-bier I've ever had. Great addition to the Lagunitas line-up."
"Overall- This is ok, but maybe not something I would grab again. I love Lagunitas and love Witchsbrew for sharing. 3.5/5"
