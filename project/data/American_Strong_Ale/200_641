Aroma is sweet with toasted malts, treacle, nuts & a hint of raisin backed a thin hint of floral hops. Taste is sweet but less so than in the nose, caramel, roast, nuts & raisin. Finish is toast, roast & metallic with some hop character in the form of a nice bitterness that's accentuated by the alcohol & intense roast. Aftertaste is metallic, lightly bitter & astringent. Alcohol presence is low for the ABV but is present in the form of bitterness and spice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, some spicy prickle, wet, slick & astringent in the aftertaste.","mothmanscott","Sunday at 04:43 PM"

A quite strong caramel/malt flavor which masks the high ABV quite well.  Almost a  medicinal malt flavor.  Aroma is strongly malt based.  Not a well balanced malt flavor but not bad.  I first tried it at the 2011 Minnesota Autumn Brew Review.  The brewery rep gave my uncle and I a bottle under the table and was quite personable. Left a good impression of Mendicino Brewing for me.

The taste holds notes of orange peel, caramel, lightly-toasted biscuit, and a touch of fennel. Things seem limp, uninspired (whatever that friggin' means...). The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a weak little beer, one that lacks any discernible character worth paying attention to.","TMoney2591","Nov 06, 2012"

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Eye of the Hawk American Strong Ale, or ""Hawks"" as me and my buddies like to call it, is an instant classic. My first experience with this beer was at a social occasion where after taking a few sips, I realized I was drinking something special. It was a huge surprise to see printed on the side of the bottle 8% alcohol. This is a strong ale with a sturdy mouthfeel, and an appropriate and sippable bitterness you would expect from this style. Crisp, clean, and refreshing, with the alcohol content of malt liquor, whats not to like? Overall its just one of those beers that you're happy to drink any time, any place, without getting too fancy or stealing the spotlight. The best thing about this beer though, by far, is the value. $6.50 for a 6 pack at Trader Joes. YES! Overall just a great beer that is a refreshing change from the hophead trend, with great value and flavor that keeps you interested without overdoing it.","BenHesk12","Nov 04, 2012"

Once I got past that, the caramel sweetness was about as much as I could handle. Dang, but this was making me sweat. Finish was semi-sweet as the yeast had converted much of the sugar into alcohol.

No clue why the aged bottle has sediment. You will definitely want to buy more of this just to fool around and experiment with. To my knowledge theres nothing that suggests aging, therefore the score I gave it was for the fresh bottle which was kinda unappealing due to its overpowering alcohol feel.

There is also alcohol in there as I breathed in deep, it was pretty sharp to the nose. The taste is very malty with an even maltier aftertaste. Not much else going on here though there is a slight alcohol finish which isn't masked very well. Mouthfeel is rather oily. I couldn't see myself putting more than one away at a sitting.

Aroma carries some caramel malt, some cinnamon, some slight hops, but nothing too robust or pungent. Flavor profile is very upfront. Bursting with malt and some sweetness, carbonation really works well in this. Some alcohol notes in the finish, which is long and bitter in a good way. There's a nice creamy texture to this beer, and a heavy sweetness which paired well with the hops. A little malt forward, but very good beer and usually very well priced, so worth keeping around your fridge for sure.","SolomonGrundy","Sep 28, 2010"

The hops are what keep this interesting and I will defintley be buying more of this in the future. Highly recommended!","thespaceman","Feb 24, 2009"

As is, it's definitely a great buy at its price (I scored a sixer for under $7) but it's not in the upper echelon.","Windigstadt","Feb 18, 2009"

Slightly full mouthfeel with a biting finish. The flavor is questionable. I like a strong beer with lots of bite, but this one is on and off again with me. There is a dominant malt presence and an equally dominate hop presence that leads to a balance which is good but the high abv really tends to interfere.

The taste is good, with a mild sweetness on the palate followed by a mildly bitter finish, not especially hoppy for a strong ale. The best feature of this brew is a lovely mouthfeel, which is thick, smooth, and seems to expand gracefully in your mouth.

The flavor starts with a bland two-row taste and progresses to light caramel and a hint of buscuit. The aftertaste holds some mild citric hop flavor and a moderate bitterness that manages to balance the mellow malt sweetness but you really have to search for the hops and the overall taste is sort of blah; especially for 8% ABV. The alcohol dries the palate and eliminates most residual sweetness without drying the mouthfeel too much but the alcohol character sticks out a bit too much considering the lack of malt and hop presence. Light-ish in body with medium-high carboantion- this beer drinks more like a boozed up amber ale. Good drinkability for the style despite the apparent ABV.

4.1,12.3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Brewed up in New York - 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date; served in my Sam Adams tulip. It pours lightly-hazed, medium amber, unfiltered?, with a two-finger, loose tan head that recedes fairly quickly, yet leaves moderate lacing. In the nose it is rich and malty, vinous, with molasses, dark fruits, green/citric hops in the back, and an aniseesque spiciness. The malts are pungent on the palate, imparting molasses, toasted, caramel, milk chocolate, and vinous notes. The spicy/grassy hops have to battle the malts for supremacy, and on the way contribute a medium bitterness, notes of green/leafiness, and sea salt. It has a medium to full body that is tingly at first, but becomes smooth, almost creamy. Overall an agreeable, easy-to-drink strong ale that delivers and nice interplay between the malts and hops.","mmmbeer","Aug 13, 2007"

The taste is initially of a sweet maltyness that quickly transitions to bitter from a combination of the hopping and alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly mouth-stinging carbonation. Overall, this is a drinkable beer but not quaffable.

Along with the fruitiness there's a nice sweet caramel taste, alcohol nearly imperceptible until the finish. Very mild presence of hops, but still very well balanced. M: Slightly coarse, crisp, a tad thin. D: Holy crap, 8% abv?! I just now noticed that, I had no idea. There's a slight trace of alcohol on the finish but with it's light, refreshing character it's amazingly concealed.

Very subdued up front, the rich malts kick in midway through the taste, providing a noticeable caramel/vanilla flavor. A nice hop balance kicks in at the end, leaving a peppery aftertaste in the back of the mouth and throat. But the caramel flavoring rules the roost here for sure. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. A totally drinkable beer, this Eye of the Hawk. I would suggest giving it a go in the fall or winter, or even early spring, as it's not exactly a summer refreshener. But still, it's a tasty brew. I think this would go great with a bread pudding dessert, or entirely post-meal with a nice big cigar. Nicely done here by the gang at Mendocino.","Atlas1","Jun 19, 2007"

Unfortunately the hops and malt are not very integrated but play against one another to some degree. The result is both a sweetness and an unsupported bitterness without enough depth.

Has a lovely floral hops aroma, but sampled from the bottle it's WAY too sweet. I should've let it breathe; my wife poured hers up and said it was indeed better in the glass. You'd think I'd know better by now. But the website calls it a ""coppery golden-amber"" color. When I looked at it, I saw a dull, sickly orangey hue that didn't look very appealing. Bleah.

All in all this beer tasted very average to me and I can't quite tell what Mendocino is trying to put forth here. I know it's been around for a long time, but is it a barleywine?

I had it at the brewery first, and thats what prompted me to get a 6er. This is of course, a review of the bottled version, and as such gets mediocre marks.

3.72,1.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Saratoga Springs rendition...clear amber color, thinish pale yellow head that's down to a skim in 30 seconds. Dots for lace. Lightly malty aroma, a lot of brown sugar tone. Medium mouthfeel. Sugary start, lower carbonation lends a malty impression with slight intrusion of a lemon rind sense around the edges. Monolithic in flavor, similar beginning to end with an iced tea statement. Could have used a little more complexity for interest to me, but drinkable and hiding its alcohol content fairly well. No indications of building extreme sourness that I pick up from Saratoga Spa Red Tail Ale...","ADR","May 30, 2004"
4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A nice surprise. Light copper colored, off-white head with good R&L. Aroma lets you know that something different is on the way. You can smell the big cherry and banana esters with the accompanying alcohol in the background. Caramel is huge. The spicy hops try to poke through the thick liquid, but don't. It is well-balanced though it leans towards the sweet side. Big bodied but that and the 8% somehow do not hinder the drinkability. Semi-reminiscent of Old Foghorn, but less alcohol flavor and much more rounded.","waughbrew","May 16, 2004"

Alcohol burn is the initial sensation in the mouth, of this medium bodied and moderately carbonated ale. Caramel malt sweetness is the first impression on tasting, but bitter piney hops and alcohol quickly obliberate any semblance of malt balance here. Piney and floral hops run the show here, and there is also an earthy mustiness present in the background. Alcohol becomes a distraction toward the end, and is not at all hidden. Aftertaste is slightly astringent. Not really bad, but not one of my favorites.","merlin48","Feb 07, 2004"

Bold floral hop aromas emerge from the glass followed by the scent of citrus peel. Theres virtually no alcohol aroma present at all. Theres a lovely bittersweet taste that intermixes with light carbonation to create a very well balanced mouthfeel. I swear, I could never taste the alcohol.

The aroma is a very acidic hoppy one, with a backbone of bready malt. A little alcohol is noticeable too. Flavors include a good amount of hop bitterness in areas, again a bit acidic. Malt is biscuity and bready. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. This beer improves greatly as it warms. Finish is dry and hoppy. Not a bad effort. It resembles something Belgian in subtle ways.

It had nice copper color with a head that died rather quickly. More of a malty flavor, didn't notice much in the way of aroma or hops. It was an ok beer, er I mean strong ale, perhaps I may have to give it another chance.","greebz","Mar 13, 2003"

You can't even detect the high alcohol in this brew, which can be kind of dangerous. Pours an orange/amber with a copper head that billows pretty thick and eventually settles out. The forefront of flavor is the hop character, and then the malt crashes through (biscuit, caramel?). A very rich and complex ale, that starts with a sweet fruit tone, and then the bitterness of the hop resins marches in to blend quite a well balanced ale. I was also getting a hint of honey, in the finish. Mouthfeel is intriguing, very full just due to the amount of flavor. Medium bodied and overall very delightful ale. Drinkability is fair, but there is alot going on here, kinda complex and high in alcohol to keep throwing these down.","WVbeergeek","Mar 03, 2003"

The taste is unusual, there seem to be a lot of hops fighting their way to the top, but not quite getting there. The malt taste seems a little cloying, but flat. Kind of leaves me not really liking this beer. Edited to add: Barley wine? I was thinking maybe an APA. Huh, they hide the booze well.","jackndan","Feb 26, 2003"

There seems to be a good nose on this beer that reminds me of other barley wines I have had; lots of malt and a smoky aroma. The taste is decent but has a bit of an astingent taste that is not quite desirable. There seems to be a nice hopiness to the beer and a good warming effect. There is a consistent malt character throughout. However, that astringency seems to overpower. Not bad but not great.","Maestro","Feb 19, 2003"
4.08,11.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a light amber with a fair sized off-white head. Smells of apple and (white raisin?) or grape. Very medicinal and alcohol tasting (almost like a cough syrup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, although I don't go looking for that flavor in a beer. Pretty hoppy. Has a very nice mouthfeel - fairly smooth and thick. The drinkability suffers as a result of the fairly high alcohol content. Holy crap, this is a dangerous beer.","Admiraldinty","Feb 10, 2003"

Head is massive in size, creamy in texture and the resultant lace is a thick clinging sheet to seal off the glass. Aroma of sweet malt dominates, with a hint of sweet country butter and a quite fresh and pleasing nose. Start is sweet, middling top and a serious acidic bite and pleasant hop spicy presence. Aftertaste dry and lingering, a decent drinking beer and could be considered a session beer.","Gusler","Jan 01, 2003"

It leaves a nice aftertaste of biscuit malt. I'd like to taste the hops a little more, but overall an OK beer, and it looks great with that gummy head.","bcm119","Oct 03, 2002"
4.05,11,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Slightly hazy orange amber in hue, covered by a persistent off white bumpy head.  Web like lace is left.  The aroma is comprised of light fruity esters, sweet caramel, biscuit malt, an earthy hop nose w/ hints of woodiness.  Subdued diacetyl butterscotch is present as well.  Fruity sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ensued by notes of buttery toffee and toasty malt.  Lightly tart yeast esters and moderate hop bitterness emerge mid palate.  A bit light in body, but the all around smooth nature of this brew lends excellent drinkability.  Finishes quite clean, w/ mild breadiness fading quickly.  Eye of the Hawk is a flavorful, somewhat understated but highly drinkable strong ale.  Very enjoyable.","marc77","Aug 27, 2002"

Nice slight diacetyl butterscotch & subdued hop nose. Drinks very deceptively, the 8% alcohol is barely noticed. A very nice blend of malt & hop...neither takes the spotlight, they just meld together in a super finish. This is one of the most easy-drinking strong ales I've had the pleasure to drink.
