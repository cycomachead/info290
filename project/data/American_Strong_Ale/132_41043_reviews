"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Moderate gusher upon opening. Pours hazy deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, pear, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, pear, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, biscuit, nuttiness, light pepper, floral, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, pear, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, biscuit, nuttiness, light pepper, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/toasty malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice strong ale. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready/nutty malt and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Personally this one is a little too boozy for me and a little too boozy to really be an easy drinker. I don't think I would get this one again as I feel like there is a clash between the sweet malt flavors and the strong (almost medicinal) flavors of the hops - seems out of balance."

"Great testimony to an Ale... They really got this one right. Only can handle a couple of bottles, first off its a little pricey, secondly you will agree. Great taste, great pour, great appearance. This is a must have. I have shared this with many friends and they all agree, the taste is complex, and once it warms in your hand gets better ."

"Poured into 22oz snifter; slightly translucent orange-red with a thick rocky cream-colored head that fades slowly, leaving chunky lacing. Smells of sweet, nutty, toasted malts with a hint of hops. Taste follows nose well; sweet nutty toasted malt with a good dose of warming alcohol, oak and some slight hop bitterness. Finishes with some lingering nuttiness."

"The double ipa revolution is here and this beer is right up there with the greats.This beer is complex and strong and you can drink it warm or cold.If its chilled its less complex and strong, I love this beer warm getting all the aromas and taste.If you get the chance try this beer you won't regret it"

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours dark hazy copper with a thin, lasting white head and lots of streaming tiny bubbles. The beer smells like caramel and brown bread. There's a touch of earthiness from the hops that I detect in the smell. The beer is a bit more bitter than the aroma would suggest, with the earthy flavors being a bit more forward than I would have expected. I get the caramel and bread that I also got in the smell. I can also taste some of the alcohol. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The beer goes down pretty smoothy and it has a nice warming quality from the alcohol. This is a very good beer."

"Purchased at Tacoma Boys. Appearance is hazy ruby brown. Beautiful white head with good sustainablity. Aroma is dominated by caramel and toffee notes. Flavors are sweet, caramel malt and toffee with no noticeable bitterness. Smooth creamy velvety body. This is great, great, great. A real treat."
""
"It's a matter of personal taste, but I found this beer to be a bit too hoppy ... at least initially. Everything else is right on the mark ... underlying sweetness, floral aroma, beautiful color. As my taste buds acclimate, however, it seems to be tasting better ... but still more hoppy/bitter than I prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Definitely a heightened version of DGA, with a more assertive flavor profile. Malt and hops are ramped up."

"Wonderful thick rich beer. Luxurious in the mouth. One of my favorite strong ales. This beer is a seasonal release here in the central valley in Ca. Every time I spot it I buy a bottle. This beer goes down easy, and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy."
"This did help me get over losing my reviewing glass, however, so thank you DDG!"

"O: This was insane. I don't really want to say this, but it one-ups normal Dead Guy from all the right angles. A real pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer. A little sweeter than I expected. Still love the regula Dead Guy better than this. I will definitely buy it again, but not before I try other stuff first."
""
""
""
""
"All in all pretty nice. I am glad to have found it on tap as I recall bombers were pretty expensive."
""
""
""
"overall- super great beer , dont drink it to fast , enjoy it , high alcohol , you surely wont notice til its gone and then you want more and a nice fat hamburger."
""
""
""
"Overall- Very nice. It has a slick, fairly clean style that I can appreciate, just harsh enough to keep it from getting boring. Assertively malty but the hops are well-placed, and it never becomes treacly, overly sweet, or cloying. This one would sneak up on you if you didn't know it was 9%. Feels like an Americanized Stickebeer, and I applaud the brewers. I'll definitely be having this one again."
""
"O/D - The increase in flavour with this beer doesn't seem to justify the 'double' label. It was tasty and clearly stronger than the original, but I was expecting so much more. Didn't seem to warrant doubling and seemed to much like the original with a higher alcohol content. Probably wouldn't seek it out again, especially due to the price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ The look and feel of this brew was outrageous!! While not as fantastic as the look and feel, its other attributes were great as well. Definitely one to try."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty delicious. One of the better malt-forward brews on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: enjoyable but doesn't quite get to where I expect. 2 very different flavor profiles, neither of which are standouts on their own and they don't compliment well either."

"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown with a nice tan head and lacing. Aroma of sweet and caramel malt, dark fruit, citrus. Nice medium full mouth feel. Subdued caramel and toasted malt and dark fruit flavors with an interesting peppery and hoppy finish. Not overly complex, but nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Double Dead Guy doesn't really mess around with the Dead Guy formula - it really just tastes like a stronger Dead Guy, although I guess technically that one is a lager and this is an ale. So we've got the caramel and light frutiness, also a beautifully clear red body. The sweetness is evident, but not overdone. It's another one of those strong beers that can be easily consumed in large quantities, until the alcohol sets in."
""
""
"O: Done very well. Dead Guy Ale is one of my absolute favs and while i still love that one more then the double, this is def worth trying and a very nice backup."
""
""
""
"D: Quite good with a robust malt-forward taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer, would pick it out of a lineup if needed. Just not overly complex or one I'd actually reach for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation is strong but welcomed."
""
""

"O: Excellent Strong ale. Nice and malty with enough alcohol to make it interesting."
""
""
""

"This is a very nice Strong Ale. Lots of malt complexity with a competent balance of hops. A contemplative one. I highly recommend this."
""
""
""
"I tried this beer on June 2, 2012 after purchasing from the King and Spadina LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent scarlet red with a generous tan coloured head. The aroma was sweet malt, alcohol, weak fruits, and floral hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was caramel malt, some fruit (cherry?), a little graininess, and a bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - its a good beer, not overly complex, drinks smooth for a 9% beer, pretty dangeour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Burnt amber colored beer, with a white head. Beautiful clarity. The aroma is moderately intense, with bread-crust and earthy hop aroma. Flowery, herbal, spicy, sharp yet smooth, this is a great smell. Warming, but the alcohol is dangerously coy. It sneaks up on you. Relatively low in carbonation, but enough to cut through the sweetness, which is substantial (to counterbalance the hops). Very full in body. This is a strong, exceptionally good brew."
""
" it was Truly DOUBLE in every way, and of course shared this with friends making it a very special tasting. Looking for another! I rated this a 5 because it deserves it, I salivate when thinking of drinking another. Beautiful orange/red color with a strong but pleasant palatable swallow! It reminds me of a perfectly mixed cocktail but only in a beer balanced flavors of sweet/sour/bitter and floral! Friends said""You only have one""?"
"Overall a decent beer that is strong and sweet with earthy notes and an alcohol presence that shows through in every sip. I guess it fits the profile for strong ales, but I'm also glad I split this bomber. I like the regular Dead Guy ale much better."
""
"Carbonation is a little full on."
""
"O/D-I enjoyed the normal Dead Guy much more. This one is a bit too sweet for me. Alcohol not masked well enough. But I drank it quite easily and without any complaint until I am currently reviewing it."

"O- If you like dead guy and big beers then you will like this one. I dont really think its worth the 11-12$ price tag in my opinion but definitely a good brew"
"It isn't a cheap beer, but it is very tasty. I recommend the bottle if you have the cash for it. Age the bottle for six months to a year if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tons of flavor, a much more developed and complicated dead guy ale. Has that distinctive dead guy flavor. I don't know how it tastes fresh, but the age has served it well. Drinks like a session beer."
""
"Bottle received from Liam on here... in a trade done last year! :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with an orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is the same with the addition of a perfume-like flavor that isn't too pleasant. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that I really don't care for too much."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent, sweet but not cloying, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I'm actually quite pleased and a bit surprised, because I am not a big fan of regular dead guy ale. If it wasn't so friggin' expensive I'd probably drink it again. Rogue's beers are quite good, but the thing that stands out most about this brewery is the fact their beers are consistently overpriced."
""
""
"I understand the concept of this beer and love the smell of it! Not a fav of the Strong Hoppiness! Great For a Strong ale of course but i tend to lean towards lagers and browns... Probably need to sit down and ave one of these again and really get into it! not a go to beer but You should try it out!"

"O: Yeah, this is pretty good. The more it warms and the more you get acclimated to the alcohol, the beer gets a little bit better with each sip."
""
"Overall: Full bodied just not too well balanced. A good brew just seemed a little off to me. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great strong ale, it aged well, I'm glad to have opened it at this point but I'm curious what another 6 months would do to the hop character"
""
"Vintage 2009, a little unbalanced. And rather tacky bottle."

"O: A nice strong ale with a good balance of flavors that hide the alcohol extremely well. A good sipper that would pair well with a sharp cheese and crackers"

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass, as usual no bottle date, but at this price I can't imagine it's a fast mover. The look is a nice amber color with a large foamy off white head. The smell is heavy malts, caramel, toffee and alcohol, not much hop presence. The feel is medium to light. The taste is way different than I expected, there is a little hop bite, less malt than expected and a little alcohol burn."

"This beer is not for the faint-hearted. It is strong! This is a beer you want after long hours of hard work in inclement weather. In colonial times, I can image a beer like this is what the fishermen liked to have when the fleet came in."
""
""
""

"O-Not bad and very drinkable even with the high ABV but probably would not revisit again cheers."

"Overall: The flavor is pretty good and the mouthfeel is better, but it simply lacks the dynamic complexity to send this to the next level. I would be interested in trying a fresh batch."
"Poured slightly hazy red-orange with a tan head and fair lacing. Smell was a one-dimensionally caramel candy malt bomb. Taste was much more interesting. Mild citric hop and caramel sweetness initially, then slightly cherry/vanilla flavors gave me a sense of bourbon, but it wasn't done yet, now some resiny pine appears toward the finish, with biscuit notes, almost reminiscent of gin. Although there is substantial sweetness here, throughout, it somehow manages to finish reasonably dry, and non-cloying. Medium to heavy body with mild carbonation. Overall, this a big one, contains everything including the kitchen sink..I enjoyed it."
"D - After 3 years this one has kept up a nice drinkability and flavor. Still very enjoyable."
"O - The original Dead Guy is a great beer because it is so well balanced. This is enjoyable, but has so much over the top sweetness that it is one-dimensional."
"I was engrossed in a conversation about real and local food while drinking this - which only served to further my appreciation of this strong ale. =)"
"I'm surprised at how much I liked this because I'm not particularly fond of Dead Guy Ale, which I simply find too sweet and candy-like. This offers a more balanced, IPA-ish approach to the formula that finds a sort of harmony between sweet and bitter."
"O: This is a powerful, fairly forceful beer. A well made, interesting brew."
"Dead Guy Ale is where the marriage of hop and malt is consummated in holy matrimony; Double Dead Guy Ale is where the two experiment with wild, kinky sex. While it offers very much the same experience as regular Dead Guy - a smooth, simultaneously malty-hoppy ale - it does provide a little extra ""oomph"" that'll put the zowsers in your trousers."
"The Bottom Line: A damn good beer that is complex and a belly warmer."
"Overall: Despite the stronger abv of this beer, I would never have guessed it based on taste. This is a very good beer, quite tasty, and very well balanced. Certainly worth a try, but I think it is overpriced compared to other beers of similar style and quality."
"Body is a little heavy and sticky and the carboantion is soft. Overall this one seems to be a little messy. Somewhat enjoyable but I'm not entirely sure what I should be getting out of this one."
"This is a very enjoyable and rich ale. It is on the boozy side but it does not dominate the flavor. This has so much more flavor and complexity than dead guy. I will pick this up again!"
"Overall, a good heavy almost barley-wine like and bitter brew. If you like Dead Guy, you'll undoubtedly like Double Dead Guy -- appropriately named."
"O: Glad I tried it. Interested to see it as it gets some age on it. Beyond that, nothing too memorable."
"Pours a deep burnt orange/red, almost rust colored body. An inch of foamy white head develops, but leaves minimal lacing. Regardless, the initial presentation is very good. Smells of delicious, toasted malt, floral hops, some piney herbs, and freshly cut grass. Taste emphasizes the toasted malt, some caramel, muted hops, faint vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. Mouth is very smooth, with moderate carbonation and a superb finish. Overall, just a great beer all around; I'd gladly have another."
"O- I'd say it's good, it's simple, but doesn't knock it out of the park. A solid strong ale, I would recommend splitting one of these with a friend. Again, would make for a good winter-warmer."
"Had it on tap at the Cerulean Garden in Winona Lake, IN. Pours deep copper color, very clear with thick off-white head. Smells of caramel malts and some citrus hops. Taste is malty with hints of citrus. Full bodied with good carb. This is a tasty brew with a very nice balance between the malt and hops."
"Overall: this was my first American strong ale and though I am not adverse to high ABV% or big beers this was a bit rich and sweet for my taste. It was not a bad beer just sweeter coupled with the heavy orange peel flavor was not my favorite. It took me about 30 minutes to drink because of the thickness and richness or the beer."
"I've had this in the red label, as far as I can tell they don't date these Rogue bottles. I call bullshit on that policy. Pours a deep ruby hue with a tan beige head forming thick in my chalice. Aroma sweet malts and deep brown sugar caramelization going on. A touch of backing alcohol and subdued hops comingthrough in this 22 ounce offering. Upfront high malt content in flavor reveals semi caramelized burnt sugars with a standarad hop/Rogue tolerance. Hops provide earth citrus bitterness amongst the sweet fruitiness/carmamelized malts with heavy backend bitterness being almost leafy in the finish. Mouthfeel some big juicy residual sugars left behind make each sip heavy handed with the malts and I call it an even medium bodied carbonation rolling steadily pretty solid. Overall a beer I would drink with friends again, big malt the original definitely more friendly to a palate searching out balance. this is a bigger sweeter hoppier version."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is outstanding. Medium bodied, with just the right amount of fine carbonation. Very creamy and smooth on the palate. Overall, I really enjoyed this one from Rogue. A simple, yet solid strong ale that I would definitely have again."
"Deep orange/amber colour, one finger off white head, good retention, some lace left behind. Smell is malty with caramel/toffee, slight citrus notes, faint alcohol but malt is huge here, light spice notes as well. Taste is malty but not what the nose would suggest, citrus come through, large hop profile, bitterness is fairly high, citrus and grapefruit finish with more malt in the aftertaste. Light-med carb, full body and creamy at points, good feel overall. Quite nice overall, ABV well hidden, would have this again fro sure."
"O- I very much enjoyed this beer. Not as heavy and strong and in your face like most american strong ales. Its lighter and more enjoyable."
"Overall, while nothing here that really stands out, this is a very rich, aggressively malted ale, quite a pleasant drink that invites one to have another, in fact the wife and I kicked this growler in around two and a half hours. The 9% ABV is buried by the malt and not noticeable at all. Not one I would aggressively search for, but if found definitely worth trying."
"This is a real great flavor and taste. I like this alot just like the dead guy but with some age and a little more alcohol content. Very good brew again by Rogue."
"Enjoyable but nothing I'd race back for."
"O - This is pretty much how I imagined it would be, big and malty, I would definitely say this one is worth giving a shot at some point in time."
"This has aged very well. The hops are still present and really help compliment the finish. Very smooth flavors and great mouthfeel."
"Pours a lightly hazy, dark, burnt orange color. A foamy, cream colored head shows decent retention, leaving behind soapy lacing that dries to random spots and flares. The aroma is a buttery, diacetyl bomb, showing an overly sweet caramel malt base and astringent, bitter, floral and citrus hops. The flavor shows more of the same, toasty, sweet caramel, buttered popcorn, and bitter floral hops. Thick and syrupy, the palate is heavy up front, finishing in a dry, biting astringency. Sadly, Iâ€™m not disappointed, as my expectations were pretty low to begin with. More of a bad thing does not a good thing make."
"overall, I think this is a very tasty beer, but perhaps not quite as intense as I was initially hoping. I dont know that is quite double the beer of the original Dead Guy Ale, but is still very tasty. I dont know that it would be a consistant buy at the price, but a very nice brew indeed"
"M - Medium body with a nice chew. Light carbonation."
"Overall a pretty good beer, kind of makes you think of beers from micro brews which is always good thing."
"O- middle of the road on this one. I prefer the standard Dead Guy a lot more. Don't think I'll buy this again...the bomber was pretty expensive too, I think 13 bucks? I like the fact that it's painted though, so no light gets in"
"Overall a decent beer, but some things were really nice and some things weren't. Look and smell were way up there. Poured a nice copper with a brown tinge to a two finger head. Great looking. Smell had butterscotch, bread and a barleywine type sweetness to it. No alcohol present in the nose at all. COMPLETELY different taste. Alcohol way up front, with almost nothing else on the finish except bitter and dry. And then an alcohol residue on my tongue. Not too pleasant. Carbonation was heavy, so mixed with the alcohol it just didn't do it for me. Not one of Rogue's better offerings."
"Overall - I was expecting more, this was not as dominant as the hype had it built up to be. was a good beer, id have it again, just lower my expectations. Great share with SpinRSX!"
"Notes from 12-7-2008, the expectation I had of this beer going into it was that it was going to be an imperial version of the dead guy ale. Not the case one bit, this brew was completely different. The beer poured out as a amberish brown color with a little bit of head on it. The smell was of malts and had a little sweetness to it. The taste I felt was a little bland, I was just struggling to figure out what the flavor was supposed to be on this one. The mouthfeel was barely carbonated making this a little on the flat side. Overall I found the best part of this beer was the bottle it came in. I still have it in my from as a dust collector on my dresser. I should really look into finding this again and trying it one more time."
"O- I liked the 2010 version better. This one is ok. Looks and smells great. However, the taste does fulfill my hopes or expectations."
"Pours an amber-brown, with a soapy offwhite and chunky head. Larger bubbles for the most part, that leaves some sticky lace and moderate retention. Nose has some hops, citrusy for the most part, but holds more malt than anything. Big caramel notes, and some moderate alcohol. Taste has layers of toffee and caramel, sugary with some candied flavours. Good hop bite in the finish. Light bitterness and a reasonable malt sweetness. Good flavour, albeit simple. Mild alcohol. Body is about medium, and a has good weight in the mouthfeel. Quite nice, and a bit pricey but worth the shot."
"O - Very glad I had the opportunity to take this for a spin. It's not a bit cheaper as I would love to session it again. Definitely worth picking up."
"Overall â€“ I think I expected more from this beer. The flavour was well balanced, but it just didnâ€™t have a wow factor. The smell was very light and the feel was pretty boring. The taste is nice and the alcohol is well hidden however."
"The similarity to the original isn't overwhelming but I guess I can see how it results from it. I like how it remains light and drinkable in spite of its weight. I'm not sure which style this would fall under but it seems like a light-drinking cross between a double IPA and a barleywine. At this price this stuff ends up being a little too boring to buy more of but I'd say it's worth checking out at least once if you're into Dead Guy."
"O: A solid beer with a nice balance between hops, malts, and alcohol. 4.0"
"O: This is a really nice, American strong ale. 4.5"
"This is a fine strong ale."
"Taste - tastey caramel/nutty maltiness but I thought hoppy - hoppy in a good way with slight alcohol burning finish. It is my opinion this is a good beer. I have tried several Rogue beers and this rates in the middle of the pack - too pricey."
"It pours a very nice bronze color and has a good two finger head from the 750ml bottle. It laces lightly all the way down the glass. The imperial smell and taste is the biggest strength of this beer. I will say it is a bit over priced for it's quality. That being said the Double Dead Guy is very good. I like the imperial IPA hints and the true smooth drinkability. I miss the musky smell and flavor of the Dead Guy in this brew. The mouthfeel is a little bitter and pleasantly imperial and smooth. I rated it a little lower than I would have if it tasted like an American Strong Ale and had a lower price point."
"There's very little hops in the flavor. This beer tastes almost smokey and bready. There's zero hint of carbonation and a full, enjoyable mouthfeel. This is not a taste that I prefer, but I can tell it's a well made brew. Recommended if you like this style."
"O-Pretty good beer, but at $11 for the bottle, probably isn't something I'll be buying again anytime soon."
"O: good beer but there are many I would pick over it more often than not. More complexity would but nice but I didn't notice the high alcohol level once which was nice."
"Too expensive for a blase beer in my book, not impressed."
"Didn't want to pass up a chance to try this on tap and I was not disappointed. Similar in color to Dead Guy- Mahogany with a off white foam. Very mellow taste for 9.0%ABS, had a malty, nutty flavor up front, and light hops on the back end. (I did drink this after my Stone Ruination so that could have skewed my palette). I really enjoyed this one- as did my wife who is not near the hop-head I claim to be. Would recommend."
"O: This beer is pretty good, but I just can't see myself (or anyone) routinely paying $10+ for it."
"Mouthfeel is full and chewy; also a little resiny/sticky from the aggressive apricot/citrus hop flavors. Overall this is a very good beer, but not for the inflated price point associated with this 2x series from Rogue. I also like the original Dead GUy more and if I didn't know what this beer was I would have a hard time comparing it/knowing it was supposed to be a 2x version of Rogue's flagship."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, a little thinner than I expected going in. For the style, pretty easy drinking, but just not my favorite."
"D - Seems like a balanced beer than is sippable and enjoyable at the least. Not world class, but definitely a beer that is worth coming back to."
"The taste matches the nose, starts smooth and moves to a slight woodiness almost a bourbon alcohol finish like its been aged in barrels"
"drinkability: it is a big beer and one bottle would be ideal for one individual. great to share if possible, but I would rather just give a whole bottle to the other."
"D: I love this beer for those cold gray days. Some people choose to grab Hot Cocoa and sit by the fire, instead I grab a warmer, like Double Dead Guy."
"D: This is a bit boozy but solid."
"t. nice balance, real solid it's just there isn't all that much complexity, it's just sort of sweet then bitter without a lot of the complex notes that make many beers interesting"
"What a surprise for me. I was expecting a boozy, thick mess, but got one fo the bettter Rogue's that I've tasted. Normally a $7 draught pint would be viewed as expensive, but when 22 ounce bottles are going for over $10 at retail stores, it doesn't look so bad."
"D: The thing I remember about 2x Dead Guy from a couple years ago was how quickly I drank it. It just seemed to go down so easily compared to before, when beer had been a chore (albeit a pleasurable one). The inebriated state I found myself in from drinking it so fast made me romanticize the role this beer played in my journey towards a love of the beverage. So yes, the alcohol isn't easy on you, but 2x Dead Guy still goes down so easy for me."
"D - The drinkability is good. It is a bit of a slow sipper for me, but it goes down rather easy. I have been wanting to try this beer for a while, and Im glad I finally had the chance to pick it up. I think this is a good beer and I would recommend trying it. Thank you New Beer Distributors for having this in stock."
"This beer is not for sissys. Strong malt flavor at the beginning and finishes bitter. In between there is some fruity characteristics, but they are hard to find given the 'in your face' character of the beer. Pours a dark amber color with some frothy head. Somewhat harsh mouthfeel and definitely lingers in your mouth. The 9% ABV is definitely apparent in the taste as well, which can detract from some of the complex flavors."
"I am a big fan of Dead Guy Ale, but this beer is an example of ""more of a good thing is not always better."" Big malt - huge actually. Malt sweetness vies against a distinctive alchohol bite that is a bit distracting. Wavering into barelywine territory at times. A big beer, but not particularly engaging. I find myself liking this beer as a one time experience, but not enough to go back for more. Cool bottle, nonetheless."
"This is a pretty potent brew, not for the faint of heart. This beer brings a lot to the table, but it's not something you can have a lot of."
"MF isn't sticky by any means, but definitely not a lighter ale. All told a really quality ale that is obly marred by its price."
"the alcohol bite at the beginning is fairly annoying however as the beer warms its very pleasant to drink"
"Pours a dark amber color with a tiny head that recedes quickly without really bringing any lacing forming. The nose is definitely quite a bit of malt with some caramel, toffee, and bread. The flavor brings quite a bit of booze. A lot of booze. Some booze-soaked bread and a bit of fruity yeast. Mouthfeel is dominated by booze and a bit of sugar. Too boozy and not really all that complex."
"D: Better than I was expecting. Very clean and approachable. I'm not sure how this beer is fresh, but it definitely holds up well after about a year."
"Although they are often criticized, I find Rogue beers to be pretty good, and they were there all those years ago when I was getting into craft (mid-90s). That said, their beers are a bit overpriced, and I drink them only occasionally. That said, I enjoyed this beer, although it was a bit syrupy and boozy (which I often enjoy). Amber colored, with a small beige head. Caramel, dark fruits and sweet malt. Good."
"Drinkability: Quite high considering its abv, however I was in good shape with the 750mL bottle."
"Yeah, this is a big beer. A little rough around the edges, but that is the Dead Guy way, right? We are just as much proponents of session beer as we are of big beers. With this bottle, we're asked again if a strong beer can be a session beer."
"2008 vintage. First time I have had this beer. Wasn't sure of the style, but American Strong Ale seems right. A light amber color with mild carbonation. Pretty looking. Smell is a little hoppy. Taste shows the alcohol, but is nicely warming without tasting harsh. Pretty easy to drink for the style and not too heavy feeling in the mouth."
"Drinkability I would say is quite high due to its classification as an American Strong Ale. Much easier to polish of than say a Double Bastard. Im sure I could get myself into trouble quickly with this one."
" To top it all off, I got home from work today and my wonderful wife picked up another bottle for me to ""review"" along with a bottle of Lucky 13. At this pace I'm going to clean out my local World Market and go broke from all the world class beer they carry."
"I love it. One of my favorite beers I have ever had. Hence, the disappointment in its apparent cancellation. Damn, the good always die young."
"Pours a deep copper color with a nice two-finger head that sticks around. Citrus aroma is really dominant and the taste is all fruit too--kinda reminded me of Hawaiian Punch (a terrible analogy for beer but it was what kept coming to mind while drinking this). Has a bit of spice at the end. This is an extremely drinkable beer and I'm glad I had a chance to try before it is all gone."
"Make no mistake, there is a lot to like with this beer, and I happily emptied the whole bottle, but I feel that a more delicate touch would have been appreciated."
"Overall- A slight disappointment. I had high hopes given my love of Dead Guy Ale. For the price there are other beers that I would recommend over this one. Despite writing that, I still enjoyed the beer and am glad I tried it."
"I really enjoy the combination of sweet and savory flavors here, it really makes it a perfect drink to sit and relax with. As expected, warmth brought along softer malt complexity and brought down a touch of tart sweetness that existed up front. Now, closer to cellar temperature, this beer is in a league of its own."
"Vintage 2008, tasted from 22oz bottle at Lush West Town. Pours cloudy orange with a thin but lasting beige head. Nose is citrus, caramel, and fig sweetness. Taste is sweet with orange peel, brown sugar, and a bitter finish. Full bodied with average carbonation and a long finish."
"drinkability: smooth beer after a year, but not my favorite"
"Nice job Rogue! Another home-run!"
"While this is a decent beer, I think I prefer the original. Unfortunately I think they missed the mark on this one"
"D - As drinkable as regular Dead Guy just amped up a bit. I think Dead Guy is a beer that pleases a lot of people, including those that are not big beer drinkers...this is Dead Guy on steroids for the beer lover."
"Drinkability: A sipping beer that loses flavor relatively quickly...not worth the price. Stick to the original dead guy"
"Pour resulted in a huge, off-tan head with outstanding retention. Color was a deep copper with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had the standard Rogue yeastiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a bit more hoppiness than standard Dead Guy. Finish had a slightly honey-ike sweetness to offset the bitterness."
"D - Not all that great really, just not enough going on or it. It's not a horrible beer though."
"Double Dead Guy, the easily identifiable red 750ml bottle that catches your attention no matter how hard you try to ignore it. Poured into a snifter, it appears a hazed orange amber color with a finger of slightly yellow stained creamy head that receeds slowly leaving patches of lace about the glass. Aroma is sweet malt almost candy-like with a touch of hops that are both citrusy and herbal. Alcohol comes through just a bit in the scent as well. Taste is bitter with a faint malty grain sweetness that gets a little spicey towards the finish as the 9% alcohol comes through. There is a lingering flavor left from the alcohol that elevates the flavor of the hops without getting out of control with the bitterness. Light feel with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall pretty decent but was expecting a bit more out of the double aspect. I enjoyed the aroma of this brew more than the taste which is unfortunate. Not being a big fan of the normal dead guy ale, this one is a little better but still not something I would buy again."
"Also, if you're into collecting bottles as I am.. pick this one up!"
"I can definitely see the Barley wine comparison. It is not really my thing and the scoring may show that, but if the features I have listed resonate with you then I say go for it, you'll love it."
"Taste: Intense grapeskin bitterness up front which melds nicely into juicy, semisweet plums and rich caramel. A nice indeterminate spicy bite is pleasant and a dry bitterness underlies the whole works. Very smooth with all the parts working effortlessly together. The finish is pretty dry with some residual grassy, grapeskin notes and spice. A nice honey note as it warms and is quite reminiscent of a barleywine."
"Very solid strong ale. Doesn't rival arrogant bastard or sublimely self righteous, but a very solid brew."
"If I'm considering that this is a take on a bock, I like it quite a bit. Not my first choice of beers to age. Regardless, it holds up well and is very easy to drink while stomping some mario 3."
"Rouge's Double Dead Guy Ale, poured an amber color, with not too much of a head. It smelt of hops, and some other spices. It had an expetinal taste. It was bitter, but not too much, it had lots of different flavors, but nothing overpowered, it had a great blend of everything. It was however a bit hard to drink more then one. Overall it was VERY good, a must try."
"A big, tasty beer with lots going on. Well worth a try."
"D- Not a bad beer and easy to drink for 9% ABV. It's big down fall is how close it is to Dead Guy Ale with just a little more alcohol. I did enjoy the beer, but I think I will just stick with the regular Dead Guy Ale because it is cheap, easier to find, and just as good."
"MF - For a 9% ABV, very light. Slightly watery."
"The body was decent, but a little too thin, with a lingering finish. Drinkability was decent, and will very much depend on how much you like the taste. Overall, a decent beer that I sort of like. I hate the regular Dead Guy (it tastes like it has an actual dead guy in it), but enjoy one of these every so often."
"Taste is malty sweet with a fairly generous amount of bittering leafy hops and toasty malt. Not much hop flavor here. Pacman yeast is discernable and provides a biscuity/bread flavor. Some medium fruits come on in the middle...guava, pineapple and raisins. The burnt biscuit aspect is still the dominant flavor though. Not bad, it kinda grows on me as the bomber depletes. Still, just an ok beer. Alcohol is big on it and the flavors are all just a bit too toasty for me. Also, not a huge fan of Rogue's yeast."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice malt and hops flavors. Reminds me more of an American Barleywine then anything else."
"After a small sample, I was done with this one."
"I love dead guy ale as a unique flavored brew and a lot of that is present here as well in perhaps a too hopped up variety."
"Overall this beer is slightly how I expected it but in many ways not what I expected, specifically much less hop presence than I expected being Rogue and all. It was also heavier on the mouth and less sweet and the booze was actually hidden pretty well. It is pretty good fresh, now I will have to get a bottle or two to age."
"Not as hoppy as I expected but easy to drink with a good ale taste. No metallic aftertaste. Great beer for the on-tap special."
"D - One bomber in a night will do. This is definitely one to have, but not one to over do in a night. Considering it's abv, this is very drinkable."
"This is the 2009 vintage. Pours a medium-dark amber body with a thick, yellow-tinted white head. Aromas of caramel syrup and oak. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a medium carbonation level. Thick malt flavor with a puckering wood flavor. A little heavy in the oak department, but still good. I feel the hop flavors are overshadowed by the woodiness. Overall an interesting beer."
"Rogue Double Dead Guy (2009) is a very clear, dense and sparkling amber ale with a huge, foamy, yellowish off-white head that stays put. It has a slightly sweet, resiny aroma with notes of pine, citrus and biscuits. The aroma is muffled by the head at first, but pepper and molasses notes come out later. It's pretty full bodied and incrediby smooth and silky with a pretty clean finish. It's nicely balanced with a pine and citrus bitterness and a slighty sweet and bready malt. There's a pronounced toastiness to it. It has no faults to speak of. It's thoroughly enjoyable."
"D: This one just don't seem to come together."
"Poured from 750ml bottle to pint glass. Rust-like color with a light brown 2 finger head. I got aromas of caramel malt with slight citrusy hops. The taste is more caramel more citrus from the hops and also a slight mettalic flavor on the tongue- not a lot but could be a defect. This beer is smooth and very drinkable despite it's ABVs."
" ~ There's a reason this brew is sold in bombers. It's because that is all you need to really enjoy an evening. I certainly recommend this to friends. If you haven't been lucky enough to enjoy a bottle. You really shouldn't wait any longer. I have a 2008 and another 2009 I'm cellaring for a vertical sampling. I think six bottles should suffice. That will put the sampling to take place in fall of 2013. I can hardly wait."
"I thought it was a good drinkable beer for the reason for the season."
"D-- After a few sips the 9% does kick in, maybe needs to be hidden a bit more. I like Carmel so this is up my alley in a big way. May not be with everybody else though. Very good beer with a lot of flavor and backbone. One is enough but woudl seek out more than a few times. Being away from the US and having mainly Rouge available here I can see how people get tired of their stuff. The yeast strain really becomes obvious. Still I like this beer. A little over priced. Not Rogue's fault though. I think this would cellar quite well. Dead Guy Ale has been my favorite from Rogue for a while now and this has totally passed it. Not as drinkable as Dead Guy but far superior in almost every other way."
"Pours an orangish/reddish copper with a big and fizzy tan head. Aromas are sweet caramel with a touch of pine and grass and a hint of oranges. Flavor is very sweet and malty... has a lot of caramel, a touch of orange and grassy hops and an overwhelming alcohol presence that creates warmth and buries some of the flavors."
"D: Bold body and hardly noticeable alcohol? Drinkability is high."
"Carajo!"
"D - This is smooth and delicious. The high ABV is not unnoticed. Two is enough if I'm drinking responsibly. Otherwise, I could keep drinking them."
"*= Ideas from fellow taster"
"Double Dead Guy actually tastes like a fairly simple beer to me, although I have trouble pinpointing the specifics. It's a dark orange color, and a tan head, but with little lacing. A sweet caramel smell is there, and it's also present in the taste. I actually liked this better when it was colder (45 degrees). I find this brew surprisingly drinkable, and would actually default to that word to describe it"
"D- This beer drink more like a barleywine light. At a lower ABV this would be very sessionable, but at 10% i have a hard time finishing a bomber. Overall, very enjoyable."
"Received a fresh bottle for Christmas and shared it shortly thereafter with friends. While this beer was tasty, I'd like to see how this beer tastes in a year or two. The flavor is a nice mix of raisin and fig fruit notes with a hoppy citrus hit, but it's fairly simple for such a big beer. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick (but not too syrupy). And if this brew had more depth, it'd be a fantastic dessert or late-night beer."
"Drinkability: Really don't care for this one at all; the harsh, grainy flavors clash with the medicinal elements and the overall booziness just doesn't bring this together for me"
"Pours cloudy orange with a huge white head. Aroma is malty sweetness withe some fruit. Flavor is very fruity with a good malt backbone and enough hops to keep the beer from being overly sweet. Medium mouthfeel and a pretty drinkable beer. I have had this before and enjoyed it better this time."
"I've still been meaning to try their Brutal Bitter, but I continue to be apathetic towards most of the Rogue lineup, with the exception of Shakespear Stout, and the grossly overpriced Old Crustacean and XS Imperial Stout."
"Poured from a bomber bottle with the year 2009 at the bottom of the label. After being left and abundant frothy foamy head that measured about 2 inches. Not much carbonation after the pour. Very little scent other than a noticed sweetness. Taste is very pleasing the alcohol is present right at first making this a sipper for me. Brown sugars, and some dark fruits are tasted along with a roasted malts, somewhat of cereal taste. Mouth feel is pretty smooth, a lil heavy oils. Drinkable nature is only hindered by the alcohol, it could be mellowed a bit."
"From the 750 ml. pink bottle. 2009 batch. Sampled on Christmas Day 2009. The pour is an amber-red color with a foamy creamy head and nice lacing. The clarity is quite good. The aroma has a bit of roasted caramel malts, some raisin, and a little floral hop. Good medium to heavy mouthfeel. The taste has a little bitterness, a little tartiness, and a dry hoppy finish. Very nice brew."
"D - alcohol and slight abrasiveness slows this down. needs more sweet notes to balance all the bitterness and alcohol."
"OVERALL Rich, smooth, complex. Not being much of a ""dead guy"" fan, did not expect to be this impressed with double dead guy. Very good beer."
"MMM.... nice and malty with a hop to your head kind of finish. Beer pour muddy copper with a thin white heaf. Smells almost like caramel apple. Taste is malty and hoppy with a faint hint of apricots. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick almost a syrup. Drinkability is pretty good, as it goes down soo smooth."
"A pretty agreeable big boy beer, which justifies the cost somewhat, I suppose, what with the eponymous malty maibock all revved up, and West Coast hops judiciously, even sparingly used at times. Also, the equally elevated alcohol is so ably integrated that it's hardly noticeable, but those 9 points do catch up as it warms, and that tacky bottle nears its end."
"The mouthfeel was fine and it was a great sipper of a beer."
"Flavor is a bit more punch then the Dead Guy ale. A slight chocolate aftertaste, roasted malts, bitters. Pretty complex and full bodied. Very good beer!"
"This brew is nicely carbonated, but it still has an oily slickness. This adds to complexity in the mouth feel. This has a strong alcoholic finish."
"Outstanding atmosphere. Great appearance and nose. Full, complex flavor. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D - Extremely delicious!"
"Verdict: Double Dead Guy is a weird kind of beast--it seems like it was developed as a hoppy Doppelbock, but it ends up too leafy and in need of more citrusy hops. I'd be interested to see how this ages, if the hops mellow out and the flavor profile promised in the aroma comes out more."
"D - I like Strong Ales. I like Oregon. But in the end, this tasted too much like Northwest Rainforest in a Glass to get the full 5 stars from me."
"Drinkability: Deceptively drinkable for 9%ABV. Basically, this is Dead Guy with a bit more of a punch. I don't know if it's quite worth the price compared to regular Dead Guy, but still quite good and worth at least one purchase."
"Drinkability: A great beer but not that much different from Dead Guy that I could justify paying so much extra for it. Worth a try at least once but once is probably enough."
"Notes: We'll have to wait and see if this review gets the same fate as the previous two that I did."
"10 dollars however is a bit steep for what you get. But price aside, this is a damn tasty and satisfying beer. worth a go."
"D=nice drinkability, very balanced and a good overall beer"
"OVERALL: Fantastic. Just great. This bottle is well over a year old and I can imagine it's aged very well. Reminded me of Dead Guy, which is a good beer itself, but the senior version with a few years of wisdom under its belt. A malty treat with a beauty hop profile to balance it out. Very drinkable as well. This was a real surprise to be honest, as I wasn't expecting it to be this good. One of the best beers I've ever had. I just hope I'll be able to find this again somewhere."
"But this beer is definitely something everyone should try."
" Wow.I liked this more than I thought I would.I almost said nothing while drinking it.I loved the hops on this,since they didn't make this a DIPA but were there enough to bring harmony,not discordance to the table.I'm a musician.I would say this is very much like a doppelbock with Ale yeast.Very similar malt characteristics.I am buying Double Dead Guy again."
"Drink is very good even for a 9$ ABV. Maybe a bit on the heavy side for a session beer but certainly a must taste."
"Overall, an interesting beer. I like this a lot better than than the regular version but there's still some of the toasted biscuity malts that I don't much care for."
"all in all really an excellent beer from rogue. its been a while since i tried the dead guy ale but if i remember this double dead guy is just miles ahead of it."
"D: Kidding, right? 2 of these bombers and I am on the floor telling the wife ""Honest Honey, I only had 2!!!"" Give away your keys, please!"
"A fine gift on my birthday, red Double Dead guys! I have stryed from Rogues, an old standby, for no good reason, and am glad to be back, needless to say. The pour was a smooth red-brown with orange edges and had a great, dense creamy off-white 2 finger head with lotsa lace. The aroma was a hoppy floral quality with wet, smokiness. The taste, however, bent towards the malt more than the hop, which was nice, as I expected an extreme hopped pale ale. Instead, a nice strong ale with toasted malt, earthy grain-herbs & caramel sweetness, hemmed in by hop bites. Full, but not heavy, sweet but not tacky, I could definitely go for another!"
"Rogue does a great job of producing a nice range of truly solid brews. This one is exceptional."
"Yet another great beer from Rogue, and happy to make it my 100th review. Great bouquet of scents, full of flavour and easy to drink; what more could I ask for. Being a fan of hops, I think it helped a bit in its taste and drinkability. Overpriced: I think so, but glad I could get my hands on it. Can't wait to review another 100!"
"This is a slow drinker. It seems bigger than 9%. Fullness of alcohol, malt and hops. Will be tough to finish a bomber on my own. Guess it's good I started early in the evening. Seems I've moved into my first winter beer. It's cold enough - no day in the 50's in the past two week and it's only October."
"D: very drinkable given the alcohol...The complex flavors and perfect head and carbonation really help break up the sweetness."
"Medium body with a decent effervescence. Good, slow drinking from a 750 ml. Almost a sipping beer. I prefer the original Dead Guy if only slightly."
"This beer poured a clear dark gold color and formed a huge light tan foamy head like a float leaving a latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, caramel, and yeast. The flavor was of malt, caramel, and pepper. The body was medium light and slightly creamy. The finish was slightly sweet. A good beer."
"The double dead guy pours a deep amber with a thick off white head that sits atop and lingers. Smell is sweet and smooth. Nose consists of malts, doughy breads and something sweet that I can't quite pinpoint. Smell is not overpowering but very enjoyable. Quaff is also extremely smooth with the 9% abv very well hidden by the toasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and I say the drinkability is high. After peaking at other reviews I have noticed that many are saying the ABV is noticeable but I disagree. The complexity of the taste overshadows the ABV. Would like to see how one smooths out in the cellar. Another solid brew from the guys at Rogue."
"Poured a dark amber with a generous head that slowly reduced to a lumpy cover. The aroma was both hoppy and malty. The taste was also both bitter and sweet, but a nice balance of the two. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. I liked Double Dead Guy better than Double Bastard, but it was close. I definitely want to do a side by side in the near future."
"D - A damn pleasurable brew. A toasty chocolate aftertaste and a little buzz leave me craving another. DDG reminded me a little bit of Sam Adams Longshot Double Bock."
"drinkability is good. nice balance, hiding the alcohol very well. great malt profile."
"D: Drinks alright, but is really alcoholic and fills you up quick."
"Fair drinkability, too easy because its smooth and not bitter, not too easy because of high alc. and thick syrup feel."
"D: This would be fine if it were 12oz. But it's a bit much for 750ml. Be sure not to drink it too warm."
"i find this one very drinkable. carbonation is right where it should be, and i wouldn't have guessed it's any higher than 7%. overall this was yet another strong product from Rogue."
"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. I had this with some Thai food and it held up very well. Drinkability is good. I polished off a bomber in good style and probably wanted more even if it would be a bad idea abv-wise. A good tasting beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large frothy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma is more geared toward sweet malt then hops as I was expecting. Taste is very reminiscent of an American barleywine with loads of cookie dough sweet malt with a bitter hoppy finish. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done with an interesting balance between sweet malt and bitter hops."
"Pours a yellowish copper with a frothy white head that leaves lacing. The smell is malty and hoppy with some citrus and sweet notes. The taste starts somewhat sweet with some malty flavor, finishes hoppy with some bitter notes. The aftertaste keeps the bitter and hoppy flavors. There is a medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation. The alcohol is hid nicely within the layers of flavor. There is a nice balance, good carbonation, a great beer, easy to drink. Wouldn't want too many with the ABV, but definitely worth checking out."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden orange, almost red, thick and chunky slightly off white head forms, slowly drops to a thick layer and ring, a shit ton of lace sticks to the glass, big chunks. Smell is nice, very malty, big bready malty character, raisin, toffee, graham crackers, brown sugar, lightly fruity, mostly just a very thick and malty aroma, some alcohol comes through. Taste is similar, insanely malty, caramel, very bready, biscuits and light toast, brown sugar, dry crackers, a touch of fruity sweetness, Werthers candies, very malty, butterscotch, alcohol is hidden well. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, very thick and chewy. Just a real big malty ale, doppelbock/old ale character. Good stuff!"
"Pours a clear, amber/copper color. 2/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, alcohol, all spice, and some raisin. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness associated with this brew. Tastes of hops, alcohol, sweet malt, tart malt, and slight citrus. Overall, strong flavor, noticeable alcohol, good blend, and good appearance."
"D- Drinks like a nice, light, overly-hopped DIPA to me. Really pleasant to drink"
"Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation and an overall creamy mouthfeel. Not sure why but I found this extremely easy to drink despite the 9% abv and that the alcohol presence was definitely there most of the time. Don't know about the bottle, but this stuff is just that good on draft. Something I'll be sure to order again."
"D: I didn't really like this one. It came out a bit strange to me. It's not very powerful, yet it's unbalanced. Considering the hefty price tag on it, it was quite a letdown."
"Drinkability is better than some of the other American Strong Ales that I have had."
"Once you get past the initial blast, this beer really opens up and is an absolute pleasure to drink. What a few minutes ago seemed like a one-off sipper turned into something I wished I had WAY more of - the alcohol warmth is there at the start and the end but in between I started to think I could probably drink quite a few more. If only I had the spare cash..."
"D: Easy going, especially for something this strong. I'm giving it a 5, which makes up for some of the je ne sais quoi of the other aspects."
"The mouthfeel is the best part of this beer for me. It is full bodied, creamy and has a satisfying bitterness. The abv warms my belly nicely and helps shroud the poor flavors. Rouge ales are consistently a disappointment to me. Lame beer."
"Pours a light golden amber with ample off-white foam. Faint hop aroma with notes of spice and alcohol, something sweet, perhaps caramel. Fairly light bodied, mouth-feel is smooth with a bit of tannin. Tastes of light citrus with a mildly chewy caramel flavor and almost like it's out of a can. There's definitely some metal in there on the first sip, but seems to fade away as you continue. Finishes quite bitter, but somehow in a subtle way, not really very aggressive hop presence. Great effort from Rogue, although I think it's too expensive. I'll stick with original Dead Guy."
"A 2008 bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a very dark hazy orange color with a nice off white head that retreats to a one finger head. The head has fairly decent retention and leaves some ok lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is kind of hoppy but not to much, kind of a caramel smell as well as citrus. Reminds me of The Dead Guy Ale just a bit stronger (obviously). Taste is very similar with the caramel being pretty upfront. It's also pretty hoppy mainly with citrus hops. The taste isn't bitter at all, I found it to be pretty sweet mainly. Goes down smooth. Like the taste it is somewhat similar to the Dead Guy Ale just more of a punch to it I guess. Pretty good mouthfeel, pretty full bodied but nothing big but it's not thin or anything. Drinkability is good considering the higher ABV but it's hidden well and drinking the bottle was no problem. Overall pretty good stuff but I wasn't worried to much as it was coming from Rogue. I've got another 2008 bottle so I'll wait on it and see how it is compared to this one down the road."
"D: A bit hard to drink since the flavors didn't meld well and were all over the place."
"I like it but it is a bit pricey ($12 a bomber is what I paid) which seems a bit much for this beer."
"Overall I would say that I enjoyed this bottle, but I would be just as happy spending its admittedly high purchase price on a whole pack of regular Dead Guy. It just didn't seem different enough from that beer!"
"This is a beer that I prefer in its un-Imperialized state. I think a lot of the subtleties that make Dead Guy such a pleasure are lost and are dominated by loads of malt. Think palish barleywine not Dead Guy X 2, if that makes any sense. Still a well crafted beer."
"Poured out of bright red 2009 bomber. I had this on tap at the delightful Roguepalooza at Novare Res last year so when I saw this I grabbed it. Excellent ultra smooth ale that will smack you if you are not careful. Pours a nice gold/brown. Tangy flavors that slide down so easily."
"Drinkability: witht he high alcohol levels, this is a true slow sipping pint and more than 1 or two would be sufficient in a session."
"Overall, a good beer with clean, strong flavors. Not the best from this style I have had but a solid bew nonetheless."
"D--Nice beer overall. I would actually prefer a little lower ABV because if I am drinking something over 9% anyway I would go for a lot of others first. But this is still a commendable effort from Rogue."
"On a side note, it comes in a flat out kick-ass bottle. I'd love to award some extra points for that, but this review and the scores are solely based on the contents. Rogue, here's some kudos. That'll have to do."
"This is really an interesting ale and I'm growing very fond of it. Probably my favorite Rogue."
"Usually don't review beer from the bottle, but the situation presented itself. The only view of this brew that I got was from the thick, sticky, amber colored, resin like bubble over I got after my first few sips. It smelled of toffee, alcohol and some burnt malt. The taste was super nice, I really liked how prevalent the alcohol was. There was a slight mask of malt and hoppy bitterness, but the alcohol made you feel like you were drinking something important. Mouthfeel was ample and full feeling, but I wanted more carbonation. Drinkability was very good for something that is 9%. The bomber went down nice and I probably could have popped another."
"- Huge on drinkability.. hides the strength better than any other that strong that I think I have tasted... just go try one! And for all those that think Rogue is just so-so... get this and be blow-blown!"
"Quite drinkable, but definitely a sipper to be enjoyed slowly."
"D: Very easy to drink beer. Would readily have it again."
"Pours a hazy amber brew with 2 finger head, very mildly carbonated. Smells nice with citrusy type hops. Tastes hoppy,not overdone.Alcohol is there but definitely not overbearing. Just enough malt to back it up. Mouthfeel is ok. A recommended brew , would go very nice with smoky BBQ."
"D) Not for sessions of collegiate rabblerousing, but I can see having three consecutively and passing out on the floor with a smile on my face."
"I got a glass of this at MarCellar's in Idaho Falls, Idaho. It's a nice amber brown beer w/not a ton of head...actually, pretty light on the head. Head burned down to a trace within minutes of the pour. Nice and half hoppy brew with some nice malts. I taste quite a bit of alcohol and not as much nuttiness that I'd like to taste, I think. Good Beer - Cheers!"
"-Oelergud"
"D: The alcohol makes no attempt to be hidden, really, and nor should it. That flavour adds to the style, as far as I'm concerned, and it makes for a pleasant sipper. It's more enjoyable than I had expected, which was a pleasant bonus. A nice release from Rogue. I still don't know about the price point on it, but that aside, it's well worth tasting."
"Palate is quite alcoholic/hot, even at cold temperatures. There is a notable toffee malt flavor with big hops to balance, but it is nothing in the league of a doppelbock. It is a freak and needs a new name."
"Not sure I could drink this often, as it is a standalone solo bomber. Just fine for tonight, though."
"This has to be one of the all-time great bottles. The contents aren't quite as spectacular, but Double Dead Guy is well worth a purchase if you like big, hoppy, creamy beer. Say what you will about their prices, Rogue almost always delivers the goods."
"Drinkability? The big bottle and ample abv say this is a one of at a sitting but it's certainly not at all hard to drink. I like!"
"All in all, not bad. Definitely balanced, but not necessarily complex. This brew is barleywinesque, but lacks real depth. Worth a shot if you enjoy malt, hops, or both."
"This is one helluva smooth big and boozey brew. IT surprised my taste bud's with a great malty profile and i found myself begging my friend for a little more. All i can say about this brew is WOW. Good job Rogue, keep up the great brewing!"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I think it is very drinkable and it is a telling sign when my wife also enjoys it and wants more. You have to pace yourself because of the ABV and how easy it is to drink. Either way, this is very drinkable and very good."
""
"Good. Good. Good. Kudos Rogue!"
"Engaging, peculiar, and repeatable."
"Poured into a darkish amber color with plenty of sticky white head. You can smell a bit of the yeast, but there is also an underlying sweetness to it. The taste is of a medium malt, with some bitterness and minor sweetness. Overall feel is somewhat thick. Possibly something with some food, but I probably wouldn't want to drink several in an evening."
"D: Don't drink them fast because you won't enjoy them as much. Not because its complicated, but because it is that good. To many of these though and you won't be drinking much else for the night."
"mouthfeel is thick, moderate carbonation. actually pretty drinkable in a suicidal session sort of way...but one bomber ought to be enough to get a sense and appreciation for this superb bottling. and bottle."
"Notes: This is another winner from rogue. I like the sweetness from this one. A tasty beer all around. Cheers"
"Good beer but I wouldn't consider it the most drinkable beer. I prefer their stouts more than this. I'm glad I tried The Double Dead Guy, but I wouldn't buy a keg of it."
"D: Overall, a pretty decent beer. The tea flavor is kind of off-putting, and the alcohol gets you buzzed pretty quickly, which limits the drinkability."
"D - I couldn't do much of this, as much as I like it."
"I like this style of doppelbock although I feel the flavor is a little one-dimensional. I wish there was just a little bit more fresh hop citrus flavor to go with the bitterness so that it would help to balance this ale which is so full in mouthfeel."
"This is a limited release. Hopefully they will come out with it again, I agree with some of the other reviewers...with a bit more age, this will be an even more delightful brew!"
"This is interesting. I like dead guy and this is a big dead guy. Not amazing but im glad i tried it."
"I am not a fan of this beer. Its hard for me to describe, and does not seem to fit the style IMO. Something I would not recommend over so many other great Dopplebocks."
"D - A bit harsh because of all the alcohol, but pretty good. Not worth the price though."
"Very bright on the hit, with the bitters coming through almost immediately. Slightly burnt, slightly syrupy finish."
"D: If you like strong bitter herbal hops, this is your beer. ABV is well hidden. However, the next one of these I get I'll cellar for a bit to let it soften. I think it'll be better in a year or so."
"A must try for anyone who likes rogue."
"Enjoyed this one the other night with some friends. Pours a hazy golden yellow into my 6 oz tasting cup with a heavy amount of white head considering the cup size. Nose is hoppy, fruity like pine and grapefruit with hints of malts backing things up. Taste is more malty that suggested by the nose but the hops are still out front. Overall flavor is nice but it is just a bit earthy. Body is medium are carb level is medium as well. This is a really good brew from a great brewer."
"Is this a doppelbock? An Imperial Brown Ale? Or just a double Dead Guy ale? Whatever it is, it's good, though not fantastic. Nice hops-malt balance though a bit astringent in the summation. Another solid offering from Rogue, and definitely worth a try."
"Not a bad brew, I think $10 was a good price compared to what I saw it for elsewhere but doesn't seem like the greatest value at that price."
"of course the first thing you notice is the awesome bottle...after that, it pours a nice deep amber color, and formed a 4 finger head for me, and still had a one finger head by time i finished, it was pretty white, and rocky, and pretty thick. Pretty sweet taste to it, and it finishes a bit more bitter then i would normally prefer, but its not off putting for me. I can also taste the alcohol in the end, but its not TOO overbearing. I still prefer the Dead Guy Ale to this, for the less bitter taste and DEFINITELY for the price, i wouldnt buy again, not because its a bad brew, but because its not worth the money to me....but of course i would drink it if it was given to me... :)"
"Drinkabiliy - One is plenty, at least for me. Supplement this brew with others of similar quality and characteristic - if you like to slam down Dead Guy Ale, then you will love to sip away at this one"
"The flavor seems to make up for the intense hops lacking from the aroma. An assault of spiced, bitter, piny hops wash over the tongue."
"Very good offering from Rogue. I enjoyed."
"D: Wow, this is much better than I had expected. Exceptionally smooth and very enjoyable. It definitely warms from within. The alcohol bite will deter some, but is not stronger than I had anticipated. I thought it to be highly drinkable."
"Overall a great brew, not sure if it was worth the price tag compared to other beers but I definitely enjoyed it. The head was one of the best I have seen out of a bottle in a long time."
"I really enjoyed this beer and was surprised how smooth it was for 9% ABV. A - amber color with nice foamy head. It had a few small bubbles like a fine champagne. S - caramel, malt, sweet. T - very smooth, bitter on the finish, rich with a slight hoppy character. Overall, I loved this beer."
"Dark red pour, frothy cream head. Malty citrus nose. Initially not that much of an off shoot from the standard Dead Guy. Slightly more creamy mouthfeel, some malt, light toffee/caramel. Strong hop presence. As it warms though, improves. Mouthfeel gets even more creamy, more malt and stickiness. Really laces the glass. Clean finishing. Alcohol non-existant. Well done."
"The price on this beer makes it something to get as a special treat. It's big in just about every way. I can't comment on how true it is to Doppelbock style, but I think this beer hit every note the brewer intended. It's fantastic, and worth trying at least once."
"Outstanding."
"Poured into a pint glass a cloudy copper amber color with a thin tan head on it. Smells of malt, caramel with mild hops. Tastes of malt, sweet caramel, and a nice balance of hops. This beer was surprisingly smooth for being a 9% beer, it is almost too drinkable for such a high abv."
"This one goes down like water, despite the elevated level of alcohol. Alcohol presence is well-hidden on the palate, or perhaps it is just unnoticed as the previous two beers were also heavy-hitters, Chimay White and Flying Dog Wild Dog Weizenbock. Either way, this one is quite enjoyable; the bar charged far too much, but definitely worth a go."
"D: This is a very good release from Rogue, and woth a try, but for ""extended"" drinking the normal dead guy is better, this warms your insides very quickly."
"Note: This beer was really expensive. It's a damn good beer, but at more than three times the cost of regular old Dead Guy, it's really not worth buying again. Definitely worth trying once, or more than once if you a man of means (ie, a baller)."
"D: Good beer in the style. I like pretty big malty beers and thought it to be smooth, but maybe a bit to warming."
"I'm not a big fan of the standard Dead Guy but this was quite nice. More drinkable and flavorful than the standard, this one is well worth seeking out."
"Rogue cooked up a winner with this one. I had the 2008 edition of the Double Dead Guy. It has a clear, dark, red appearance. The scent is very light. The carbonation is low. The taste is where its at. It has a slight caramel and a slight bitter taste. And you would never notice that its 9% alcohol. Its just smooth. Its an excellent beer to enjoy."
"This beer should be marketed as a strong American Pale Ale or IPA. I might pick up another one just because the bottle is awesome, but not for the beer."
"Overall, this seems like a subdued double IPA. A different beer and fun to try."
"M&D - very easily drinkable, and superiorly unoffeensive, two Bud Light drinkers with me fully enjoyed it. well done, one of the best Rogue beers i have ever tried"
"A light golden with champagne bubbles. the smell was kind of weak, but i detected a lot of wood...is this oak aged? It was similar in the taste, some good hops, and still some of the wood...thought it was really solid, very different than the regular dead guy."
"This is a dead guy with extra alcohol and hops added in to the mix. It works in the most part as it bring a new hoppier dimension to a fairly malty beer. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and the finish is a little on the sweet side but it tastes like a typical Rogue beer. Not their best but a worthy beer to try and savour"
"Eric"
"D - This beer is a good example of American craftsmanship in beer, just don't expect Dead Guy +, and you'll be fine with this one"
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Overall, I like this beer. If you like Dead Guy Ale, you should definitely give this a try."
"Overall a very good beer. Nothing spectacular, but still a solid brew. Would definitely have it again."
"The double dead guy is a dark copper ale topped by a finger and half of almost white head. The aroma is massive malt richness with bread and toast and a hint of melanoidin. The taste is similat but with a large dose of floral hops to temper the malt. Huge bodied doppelbock that is truly delicious, even more than the other dead guy."
"The drinkability is definitely effected by the presence of the alcohol. Obviously, you expect a bit of this at 9% abv, but I think the alcohol takes up too much of the flavor profile to make this wonderfully drinkable."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a dark orange/amber with a decent head that settles to a swirl. Sweet and malty up front followed by a beautiful citrusy hoppiness featuring grapefruit peel as the predominant aroma. The taste is even better. The malty beginning transitions to a beautiful orange and grapefruit bitterness that really lasts. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and smooth. This is a very hearty and satisfying beer, especially on tap where it picks up a bit more smoothness."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a long time. As the name implies, it's an amped up version of the regular Dead Guy Ale, even though I don't think it's quite as good as the original."
"A strong pour gets nearly four fingers of light tan head that receeds in a couple of minutes leaving just a hint of consistant lace. Body is a glowing orange amber in color. Nose has hints of citrus based hops, sweet malt and some softly phelonic alchol spice. With first sip you get a even dose of richly balanced mineral based bitter hops. Malt joins in and gives just the right amount of balance without overtaking the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth rich and crisp with a bit of thickness. Hop bitterness does flash nicely at the end. Alchol is super well hidden for 9%. Very nicely drinkable brew."
"D-It's a higher alcohol brew, but it doesn't taste like it. It goes down pretty easily, though the hoppiness does get in the way of the smooth maltiness a dopplebock should have. Nonetheless, I think it's pretty enjoyable, surprisingly hoppy and bitter, and an enjoyable drink."
"Love the Dead Guy Ale, and this one is even better. Pours clear ruby red with an off-white head. Delicious Munich and crystal malt in the aroma with a healthy helping of hops. Creamy mouthfeel. Resin and pink grapefruit hops in the taste, with the tang of the crystal malt. It truly is an Imperial version of the Dead Guy."
"D - A nice, balanced beer. Maybe too easy to drink."
"Drinkability= Not really a quaffer. A sipper fo sho. good beer, not what i was expecting though. I would not seek out again @ the price tag of $15 I think it was..."
"This was nothing like what I expected, but by god its good. The alcohol is not evident on the taste at all, and that makes this one scary beer because it's so easy to drink!"
"Carpenter might be better than 90, but 90 is so drinkable!!! 120 let me down this time, but is still nice to try from time to time, but double dead guy?!?! never again. and I wont try tripple now either."
"Poured a clouded orange/copper color with a light tan head. Nose is sweet maltiness, with hints of alcohol and hops. Taste, sweet maltinessand a nice big hop presence. A bitter hop and a decent mouthfeel, with a semi-dry hop and hints of alcohol in the aftertaste. A hyped up Dead Guy but I did not find it that much more impressive."
"but damned good!"
"Drinkability - Bocks are supposed to be real session beers and DBs less so but still quite quaffable, so in this sense the beer is a failure. It's way too thick and boozy to throw back but lacks the complexity of other quality ""big beers"". Diehard dead guys might buy into the packaging hype but this was a disappointment. The awesome drinkability of the DGA is lost on its big brother. But hell, it's 9% so I'm drinkin' it!"
"Oily and thick on the tongue. Chewy but not a choker. Has the strength of a barleywine. Severe. A sipper, but a good one. Strong and challenging. Very good, but will be hard to repeat."
"D= very high. I'm scared of the high abv though...great brew"
"Pours clear copper with a big persistent white head. Smell is sweet and malty with some fruit notes. Pears. Taste has a nice very carmelly sweetness. Bitterness in the middle and through the finish provides some balance. Some hoppy herbalness in the finish also and a little warming alcohol. Nice but not particularly distinct or memorable. Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall a solid and enjoyable beer."
"An interesting brew, but the price likely will keep me from buying this again."
"Double Dead Guy basically says ""to hell with styles."" And if a style must placed on it, it seems more like an American Strong Ale than anything. (Maybe I should check the Rogue site for the official word on this.) No matter, it's my kind of beer, and a damn fine way to spend a Friday evening inside on a chilly evening. The gorgeous red bottle sits staring at me, taunting ""why the hell did you buy only one, eh?"" Glad it's a big one."
"MF&D - Perfectly balanced and complex. This ale had a nice sticky mouthfeel and at 9%ABV it was extremely drinkable. My only complaints are this ale should not be billed as a Doppelbock, its clearly a Double/Imperial IPA, and at $12 a bomber its a little pricey to get hooked on."
"It's not one of Rogues best brews, it's good and unique, but not something I think i'll be buying again. Kudos for them giving the idea a try."
"It poured a med red color with a thin off white head and not a lot of lacing around the glass. It smelled of hops quite a bit, tasted of hops also with a bit of an alchohol bite to it in the end, Medium bodied fairly drinkable brew.It's a little overrated if you ask me."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a huge foamy yellowish head that resists fading. Sheets of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is on the timid side for all the ingrediants this one is packing. Light and hoppy with matched sweet malty underpinnings that suggest a BIG ale to follow. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and creamy. The sweet malty flavors are fully complimented by the texture. A piny resin character prolongs the somewhat dry finish. Scoring points for complexity. This one is a really easy drinker...even at 9% ABV. The alcohol is well integrated. Can't speak to the truth of style...but i've enjoyed this one. Leans towards a Double IPA in some respects. On the pricey side at $11 a pop, but the unique bottle does 'sexy marketing' proud!!"
"D - A tasty beer indeed. A good balance of malt and hops. Something I'd drink again for sure."
"Caramel colored body. Slight haze. Bubbly dirty white head. Lacing is quite abundant for a 9% beer. Very thick nose of malt. True to form for a dopplebock. Throw in some blackstrap molasses and a little anise and you've got yourself a damn nice aroma. Upon tasting, it's really hard to tell that this fucker's got 72 IBUs with all the malt that I'm getting. Don't get me wrong, I get the hops and bitterness, but this is a malt forward beer, as it should be, with a little bit of a hop 'zing' ""Rogue Style."" It's a very enjoyable beverage. The malts are rich and bready. Oozing with nougat and caramel. Bread pudding comes to mind as well in a ghostly kind of way. It's way too easy to drink for the octane level. I notice the alcohol, but it's not intrusive and really fits into the context of the whole beer nicely. Well done."
"I wouldn't exactly call this beer drinkable in the sense that you could sit down and have a couple bombers by yourself. I would say that you do not need to be anywhere near the drain to consume this one. It's about middle of the road for me."
"Very cool red bottle. Warmed up a bit. Pours an amber brown colored body. Creamy small white head, diminishing. Clear body. Very hoppy aroma, malty. Sweet nutty smell, bitter. Smooth malty flavor. Nutty, with a hoppy aftertaste. Citrusy. good taste, carbonated. Slightly warming."
"the astringency is a bit much and effects mouthfeel and drinkability"
"D: I enjoyed this beer but not my favorite doppelbock."
"Poured into my Rogue Dead Guy Ale glass a very nice slight haze golden orange/amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacingin left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, nice touch of caramel. The taste is sweet/honey, malty, with some caramel. Medium body, you would not know this was a 9% ABV brew, very well hidden. Drinkable, another very nice/tasty brew from Rogue."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thick foamy beige head. Very roasty malt aroma with hints of chocolate, toffee, caramel and hops. Flavor very similar with lots of roasted coffee bean, chocolate malt, toffee and a dry bitter hop finish."
"Found this beer while rummaging around Gary's in Portsmouth, NH. Really cool bottle. It was a hazy orange color with a medium-sized off white head and a bit of lacing. Caramel malt aroma. Very malty taste, sweet, some hops. Nice enough beer, didn't knock me over."
"Beer pours a deep clear amber color. 2 1/2 inch frothy head that dissipates relatively quickly leaving decent lacing behind. The scent was very, very faint. I was expecting a much more apparent aroma - though you can pick up slight hops, caramels, and possibly some honey. Taste is very sweet at first that blends in to the nice hop bite. Alcohol is slightly apparent however not overwhelming and mixed well with the beer. Mouthfeel is nice - a little on the lighter side, but enough presence. I hope to pick up another of these to stash."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, with sugar cookies lingering. Tingly finish with the CO2 but overall, nicely balanced."
"D - Reminded me more of an american strong ale than a dopplebock but I guess I can see the reason it is a dopplebock since it more malt focused and less hoppy than most american strong ales. It tastes like a bigger dead guy and although I like the original I don't think this one is worth 10.99 a bottle."
"Should definitely be a sipper, at this size. The richness helps to limit the pace at which I can drink a glass. It is very smooth however, with nothing to disagree with. I could drink several of these on a cold night, but I might regret it in the morning."
"Overall, Double Dead Guy is a pretty solid brew that is definitely worth a try."
"good drinkability, it's got a bold, but not at all overwhelming flavor, and the 9% abv is pretty well masked. this isn't how i would have envisioned double dead guy, but this is a success none the less. very nice"
"Generally this Double Dead Guy tastes like a work in progress. I have another down in the cellar with which I plan to test this theory. Regular Dead Guy"
"Caramel and orangey sunshine hues captivate the slow, tiny bubbles making their way to the top of a ring o' foam head. Don't care much for the lack of foam. Sweet , toasted and faintly sugared malts give off aromas plums. Plus the faintly herbal and grassy hops. Thisis one bitter dopplebock, 72 IBU's!!! Astringent at the beginning of the taste. Then the malt definition???? Very interesting. Astringent, lmos medicinal hops in the front. Then sweet toasted caramel and crystal malts in the middle. The finish sees a blending of herbal chammomile and rosemary from the hops blending with very sweet, bready malts. Lots of caramel and toast. Very clean palate for a dopplebock. I wish there was some more sweet lingerings going on in this beer. Alcohol seeps in on the finish."
"Double Dead Guy Ale pours an orangeish color with a white head from a brown bottle painted red. The aroma is pretty mild, a little bit of hop is noticeable. The flavor is a bit hoppy, with a decent caramel backbone. I'm kind of surprised at how mild this beer is flavor wise. I don't detect any noticeable alcohol, but it's clearly quite strong. Worth a try, but definitely on the expensive side."
"Is this double the malt? double the hops? or just double the dead guy?"
"Surprisingly rich and thick light beige head on top of a clear amber body. Leaves copious lacing and a gentle swirll brings the head back to the beer. Very nice. Sweet carmel tinged malts and hints of alcohol. Taste has a bit of hoppiness up front, but the malts take charge. fairly reminiscent of the regular Dead Guy offering. The difference lies in the alcohol. Not as hot as a barleywine, but no mistaking the potency of this beer. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. Light to negligable carbonation. Nice. Drinkability is limited by the alcohol presence. It is not overpowering, but after a bomber, you'll know that you have had a serious brew. Tastey, but not necessarily a repeat purchase."
"D-I could have another pint but wouldn't go much farther"
"Overall, I'm glad I had this fresh. Not even close to the style, but a great beer nonetheless."
"Good version of regular Dead Guy but overall almost prefer the regular version."
"I wasn't a huge fan of the original so it shouldn't be a shock that I didn't like this very much. Its well brewed just not for me. Too much of the sticky sweet side of things."
"Not wild about this beer. Very expensive ($10) for the bomber, and I just didn't like it. Many other doppelbocks out there that taste a lot better at half the price. Celebrator, anyone?"
"Mouthfeel was slick and had a medium body."
"D: This is a great drinking brew. Perfect for the first cold night of the year."
"22oz bomber with bright red paint and 2008 date. Pours a medium amber with a huge head, good longevity and nice lace. Subtle aromas of malt, vanilla and yeast with a mild hop presence. Upon tasting, big malt presence with vanilla, slight sherry and decent hop flavor with a decent bitterness. I think it is quite literally double dead guy. A good beer but not sure its worth the $11.99 I paid for it."
"Of course, it's not a beer to drink in a time of manner just to feel the alcool. Take it slowly you'll enjoy it for sure. With salty side (pretzel...) is a very pleasant beer, and when I've a chance to buy it again, I'll do that for sure."
"Very drinkable but I was expecting more bang for the buck. This was not the beast I'd heard about."
"Poured red with orange highlights, substantial off-white head that seemed to rise from nothing before settling back to nothing. Nose shows alot of hops and malt, in almost equal proportions. Caramel is the most dominant character. Palate shows some more caramel before some sweet malt gives way to dominating bitter hops. The sweet caramel malt again makes an appearance to take a bit of sting out of the aggressive hops. Shows a spirit like aniseed on the nose as it warms."
"Its Ok but probably not worth the cash most will spend for this."
"For a 9% abv this was a very drinkable beer. But, being that the Double Dead Guy is on the more expensive side, I probably won't be able to enjoy this brew that often."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick and creamy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a slightly warming burnt toffee and roasted malt aroma that's sweet with a bit of dryness. The taste is good. It has a dry roasted malt flavor with a warm malty sweetness in the finish. It goes down very smooth with a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It's complex and flavorful and highly drinkable even at 9%."
"Drinkability: There's a couple of reasons why the drinkability score is so low. First off was the smell of this beer. There wasn't much of anything in aroma. Second was the taste. There also wasn't much going on in there. Third is the price of this beer. Holy Crap! For the hefty price tag this beer carries, you could buy a few good session six packs or a delicious barrel aged beer. There's no way I would buy this average beer at such a high price. Be warned!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: All in all, this beer is okay. All around okay. I think that there was more hype around this beer that what it actually deserves. Sure its good, but is it good enough to deserve all the hype that it got? I don't think so. I was so excited when I heard that this beer was coming out. Unfortunately I was let down hugely by it when I took my first sip. Now I've given a second or third chance..(I've tasted this beer on many different occassions before this) and still it doesn't meet what I think it should be concerning that hype that surrounded it. This is one that I'd not buy again were it a regular offering from Rogue, however, since this is a limited release I might buy a bottle to see how it changes over time and then one as well to use for trading or to sell on E-bay years from now....hopefully it will give me some kind of return. In the mouth the beer is medium-full, lightly carbonated-almost none at all. What this beer feels is almost what I'd say is good for it, maybe some more carbonation would be good, delicate bubbles on the tongue, not alot but there."
"D- A smooth, easy drinking beer. I was surprised to find out that this was 9% ABV."
"Very interesting. I'm a big Rogue fan, but this fell a bit short for me. This had a lot to live up to though, because I love the Dead Guy."
"Drinkability- All in all an average brew. Has it's moments, but nothing to spectacular here. Not worth the nearly $10 price tag I paid."
"Pours a really beautifully clear dark honey color with an attractive head that seems not just to sit on top of the beer but fade into the rest in a gradient. Aroma is a lot like normal dead guy- a little bready and airy. Taste has a little more of an american hop feel, sort of like a barleywine. A very delicious beer, obviously well made, but expensive as hell and I don't think that much far above normal dead guy, especially when it comes to price."
"Overall impression: Interesting - this isn't something I would want all the time, but it is a nice example of some interesting flavors you can get out of malt."
"Drinkability - very tasty and an ideal way to wind down the Halloween '08 weekend. Another pricy bottle, a good beer but not worth $13."
"A bit cloying, and not a beer that is invitingly drinkable."
"It's drinkable but it's not all that interesting. I love Rogue and the creativity displayed in most of their brews is enlightening, but sadly this is not."
"Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying this brew. I used to live in Oregon and found myself becoming quite partial to anything that Rogue put out, so I was happy to find something different in Kentucky of all places. A great find and well worthy anyone's time and money in trying (and you do have to pay a little bit more for it)."
"Most certainly NOT a Doppelbock which makes me wonder why it was listed so in the first place."
"D - This was delicous. I wish I had been able to try it while it was on tap in town."
"D- Maybe just a little on the sweet side, but definitely a good drink for this Halloween Night 2008."
"This one did not seem like a dopplebock for me, especially in regards to the color, I would call it more of a maibock or even and imperial red at times, this beer is quite expensive for what it is, think some age might mellow it out a bit and that might be needed, I would not buy it again, worth trying but pricey"
"Heavy bodied, but a slow, struggling carbonation stays with it throughout. For it's strength, it's a nice malt-focused drinker/sipper. But I'd like something to stand up and take charge, aside from it just tasting larger than normal."
"May be a bit steeply-priced, but if you're a fan of big, sweet alcoholic bocks, this is a quality one, so a no brainer. I'm more inclined to stick to the regular Dead Guy Ale for a night of partying."
"2008 vintage. This poured a clear dark copper with tan head. It smelled like sweet honey and burnt caramel malt with some grapefruit hops. It tasted like sweet caramel and honey malts with bitter grapefruit and pine hops, and a bit of confectioners sugar for added sweetness. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this wasn't terribly different from other Rogue beers. I guess using the same malts and hops will do that to a brewery. But this still had a great, clean flavor that hid the alcohol well, so it was quite easy to drink. And it had a nice body too. So it wasn't super unique, and didn't really seem to fit the style, but it was still a very enjoyable drink. However, I don't really feel like it was worth the extra cost, so I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Medium/heavy body but not quite as much CO2 as it should have, still quite alright. Drinkable but I wouldn't buy it. Again, not a doppelbock by any stretch, I'm not even sure this is a lager. Overall an alright beer."
"In terms of the nose, appearance, and my overall impressions of this beer: it's about on par with Dead Guy. For whatever it's worth, I would rather have the normal beer, and that's even without taking into account the double priced nature of this offering. In terms of Doppelbocks, I would rather pay this price for stuff like Celebrator, Dark Horse's Percolator, or less for locals like Bell's Consecrator, or even the Sam version."
"Nice. An explosion of flavor. I still think Dead Guy stands taller as a good solid beer, but this isn't bad and it isn't lacking in residual sugar."
"D: Pretty decent offering from Rogue, though a bit odd for a dopplebock (I didn't even realize it was one until later). I enjoyed the brew, but the retail price is a bit questionable. Go out of your way if you're a big Rogue fan, else just wait until you happen to come across this at a bar."
"D - This beer just doesn't do much for me its a little to boozy for me its worth a try though if you can find it"
"Drinkability is moderate. It's a decent beer, but nothing incredible. I'd rather have a regular Dead Guy."
"Bottle bought for halloween - split with buddy. Deep burnt orange nice head. Smells toasty malty. Taste - deep malty toasty goodness - reminds me of a caramel apple, alcholy and some hops finish. Mouthfeel - full, frosty creamy, carbed. Drinkability - can't believe the 9% - I'm going to buy some more - sorry I sat on this so long waiting for the weekend befor halloween."
"Overall: re-added to wants list"
"The 2008 DDG, finally making an appearance in Texas. I poured it into a Chimay chalice. It has a rich dark-copper color, with a quarter inch head of foam. The nose has a solid malt underpinning with a floral hop aroma. Very nice malty flavor, rich and bready, with a very light caramel touch. Moderately high bitterness, with a flowery hoppiness, but emphasis remains squarely on the malt. A touch of alcohol makes an appearance at the end, but not too much. Big body, with a smooth texture."
"Some pineapple flavor; Fruit punch flavor cut by a dry bittering hop. Light alcohol warmth in the background. Not over the top like some double bocks. Superb balance."
"D - A little too sweet for me, but I could drink a lot of this stuff anyhow. 9% is a good abv for a long evening."
"A solid and tasty brew, but a little pricey and high in abv to be a slynger fridge commoner."
"No off nodes, nothing overly bitter. None of the syrupynes that plagues so many big, hoppy beers. This is definitely a bock. And it's definitely a perfectly balanced hop bomb. And it's also one of the best beers I've had in a long time."
"It's darn drinkable for a ""big beer"" at 9%, but I don't think I could drink more than one. The buzz is already upon me. This is a beer that I will drink again."
"Edit: I see that this should actually be categorized as a Strong Ale and not a Doppelbock."
"A solid offering. Great to drink with a wedge of brie. Not the best in the style, but a good brew. Try it and enjoy the bottle design as well."
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. Much more than I expected for some reason. I think at $12 a bottle I expect to be blown away. This was good, but not $12 good. I wouldn't buy another at that price."
"Pours a nice dark honey-golden, clear with fine bubbles, and a very thick off-white and fairly persistent head. Aroma is strong and malty with undertones of caramel and hops. Flavor is surprisingly hoppy, with a good balance of maltiness and a sweet undertone - there is a fair amount of bitterness, but it is not overwhelming. Texture is smooth and edgy and very pleasing. Overall, another winner from Rogue."
"As an amped up version of Dead Guy, it's a good beer. I certainly wouldn't call it a dobblebock as it is probably doesn't stack up to the better dobblebocks out there. Either way, it's worth trying."
"D- Double Dead Guy Ale clocks in at 9% ABV, but the alcohol is very well-integrated into both the flavor and the aroma. This beer is a malt bomb for sure, but I never got tired of it. Seek this one out."
"I like this beer and wish that Rouge comes out with lots more of these great tasting beers!"
"Brilliant, clear red amber with thick foamy off white head and loads of tiny bubbles cascading up through the body. Leaves a decent lace as well. Aroma of sweet malt, fruity, maybe plum, turning a little more earthy as it warms up, even tranisitioning to a straw-like smell toward the end. Warm, well balanced initial flavor that is malty and keeps a little of the fruitiness from the aroma. Nice bitter aftertaste, which I felt was pretty reigned in. The malt is a little sweet and the flavors are surprisingly not over the top. Medium to full bodied with smooth almost creamy texture and only the slightest hint of alcoholic finish - really well balanced. This is a truly drinkable beer that is tasty, well balanced and easy to drink. My only real complaint is the price. This is a solid beer, but it is more than double the typical American-brewed bomber. There are some beers getting prices in this range, Russsian River comes to mind, but RR is worth it. I am not sure I could say the same for Double Dead Guy. Worth a try, but probably my only one."
"It feels a little heavy in the mouth, but not so much on the stomach. I'd say this is quite a drinkable beer especially considering how intense it really is."
"My friend gave it to me on my birthday out of her private stock, and overall, I see why she loves it, however it does not fit perfectly with my personal preference. For the type of beer it is, it is a tasty concoction, worth the experience, though it is outside my bouds of preference, overall, as I would gladly drink it if offered, or if it were availabe, though I would not necessarily go and spend 12 bucks on a 22 of it for myself. my dad would probably like it though..."
"Smooth, medium in body, and lightly carbonated, Rogue's Double Dead Guy Ale is quite tasty and very drinkable."
"Pours a medium amberish orange with a small tan head that retains well,leaving some nice even lacing on the glass. The nose is a bit grainy at first whiff,with some mildly sweet caramel and earthy notes. This is more like a double IPA than a Doppelbock,though it fits into neither category. This is very hoppy and equally grainy. Citrus and pine throughout with some caramel and light banana flavors. A magnified version of the DGA ,leaning a little more to the hoppy side,as apposed to the toasted banana bread side of the original version. A bitter finish and sweet caramely/fruity aftertaste keep things interesting. Double Dead Guy is a great offering,but others of equal character can be had for a much smaller price tag."
"A decent beer. Just too sugary for my tastes."
"This is a doppelbock, eh? I don't think so... More like a lighter American Barleywine IMO."
"Refreshing and delicious, hiding the alcohol."
"The color is great, and the texture and carbonation is perfect for me. It's a little hoppier than I like, and I like some hoppy beers."
"Pretty good, but maybe not worth it considering the price (~$11 for 750 ml). Worth a try though if you can find a good deal."
"D. This was a very interesting brew and one Im glad I had. I would try it again. Worth seeking out."
"WARNING - this stuff can really slow down your home brew bottling session, it slowed me down big time, so be careful! Maybe I will wait until AFTER I bottle before I drink this again during a bottling session! Oh well it made a good story in the process. Cheers!"
"In my opinion, for $11/bottle, this needs to deliver a little bit more.."
"I had this on tap at Taco Macs in downtown Atlanta. The beer style wasn't stated, but I claim it to be a hopped doppelbock (not unlike Smooth Hoperator). The beer was a little murky, dark copper colored. The aroma was malty and bock-like with a citrus character added to the mix. The taste was nice, sweet malty flavor with aggressive hops on top adding some bitter citrus sweetness. A little ethyl alcohol is apparent in the flavor, keeping the drinkability score low for me. An interesting beer that I'm glad I tried."
"Drinkability: Probably dangerously drinkable, considering the alcohol. The dryness is probably a bit higher than I would like over an extended drinking period, and it's not really like any other dopplebock I could name, but it's a good beer that deserves a look from any fan of Rogue."
"Because of the hype surrounding this beer, it seems that the actual samples have not held up to the anticipations. However, the beer turns out better than I expected. The appearance is similar to the regular Dead Guy, but the carbonation seems appropriate for the viscocity and the color is a bit darker- but still with the golden-amber, hazy hue. Light on head formation, but good with retention. Aromas are moderate and take on dopplebock melanoidins, rich, bready, alcoholic, and fruity with raisons, dates, and figs. Quite un-dopplebock-like with hight hopping rates of citrus and pine, and estery fruitiness of apples, pears, and berries. Aromas transer to flavors very nicely with a good balance of malts to hops that keep the beer from the overly sweet character of the original Dead Guy. Body is rich, but the hops and a alcohol bittering keeps the body from cloying, syrupy, or heavy. This beer works very well for a dopplebock, even if it is off of style a quite a bit. I think this is a better beer than the original."
"Not a bad brew, high ABV is hidden under the generous sweetness. Overall seems light in character. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall pretty solid, enjoyed it."
"D-This one to me is like a dead guy with a heavy body does not really have many of the classic dopple feels to it im not sure i would spend the money to get it over just the standard dead guy again."
"Sorry, but I can't get passed the mustiness in this one. Together with the fact that there just isn't alot going on in here. Won't be rushing out to buy more of these."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Mild carbonation. This is way out of balance, and doesn't seem to fit the Dopplebock style very well. This might mellow out and improve with aging, but I'm not that interested in finding out."
"Possibly the coolest bomber I've ever seen. Been hunting this one down all over town, but don't get me started on that. Now it's time to enjoy. A clean amber colored brew with a prolific tan head that reaches to the rim of the pilsner and slowly fades leaving a smattering of lacing all along the way. There's a not a whole lot going on aroma-wise. There's some toasted malts in distance. A bigger whiff also reveals some caramel undertones. Tastes malty and a bit bready. There's some grain and grass thrown in as well. A good hit of hops reveals themselves after a few drinks, and really stirs things up. The alcohol heat is evident, but not bothersome. My first impression of this brew wasn't that great, but as I spent some time with it, it really grew on me. Another top-notch offering from Rogue here."
"As all ready stated, this Dbl. Dead Guy is not really speaking the tongue and chewy cheek sticking Doppelbock that it should. And for the price I'd rather get me some Celebrator. Sorry, this Rogue beer didn't do much for me other then teaste me with its great appearance and fancy cool red bottle."
"D: Overall, some noticeable alcohol fusels and warming may limit consumptions, but much like the beer, you will warm up to this the more you drink."
"in is just awesome. Get it while you can!"
"The bottle gets you really excited to try this brew. Out it pours a hazy yellow copper with a craggy medium sized head. This brew leaves an inordinate amount of lacing as it goes down. Smell is sharp ripe fruits with a sweet caramel note. Some bready sour yeasts. Taste was huge bready fruit explosion. Just the right amount of sweetness. Very nice. Some alcohol bite as well. Faint grassy hops. Mouthfeel was initially full and chewy, but is quickly tempered by that alcohol bite. A fairly drinkable big beer, though I found a single bomber to be the right serving size for me."
"Nice bright red bottle. Appearance is clear amber-red that poured into my glass with a finger width of off-white foam. Good lacing. Not much in the aroma department. Some of the bready melanoidens typical of the style. Very faint noble hop aroma. Taste is mostly malt here similar to the aroma with a little bit of a winey aftertaste. Medium to medium-full mouthfeel, good carbonation, and medium-low hop bitterness makes this brew very drinkable for 9% ABV. Still, I'm a tad disappointed since I paid $11.99 plus tax for this bottle. Way overpriced but still a delicious beer. As I drink more of this beer I do like the use of American citrus hops. Kinda of gives it a crisper and more refreshing taste. Still, there are better examples of this style."
"Drinkability was so-so, it's not my style, hot and homebrewy. I'm gonna give my bottle at least a year of cellaring before I even think about cracking it open."
"D: I find myself a bit let down on this, in terms of drinkability and balance of flavor I will stick with the regular dead guy. Not bad but not great."
"Pours a fairly bright orange that is a tad cloudy with a small unimpressive mostly white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of citusy hops and fruits dominate. First sip is creamy with tangy hops bitterness. A nice malt backbone compliments well. The finish is tasty and bitter with the 9% ABV somewhat hidden. This brew is slightly under carbonated. Not bad but but worth $10/750ml."
"D - Great beer. I have been drinking Dead Guy for a long time but have never seen this before. I am happily surprised."
"Pours a clear brown amber with a thick creme head. Nose is not that eventful with mild malts. Floral fruity thing is kind of there as well. Flavor is malty. Bitter tone with a slight roasted edge. A noticeable alcohol edge. Feel is kind of sticky on the liquid and the carbonation is low and a bit biting. Overall this beer is ""eh""."
"The bomber was a wonderful blood red in color, but the beer thankfully looked like a normal Dopplebock. The body was clear orange, and formed a two finger thick foamy head quite rapidly. The smell was quite malty, which was a departure from a typical Rogue beer laden with hops. The hops were detectable as a floral and spicy smell, but it melded quite well with the malt. The taste was where this beer really shined. The sweet and caramelized malts were here as they are in any Dopplebock, but they were accompanied by a significant hop bitterness and a resulting spicy and dry finish. While this was a departure from the spirit of the style, it was a welcome change. The beer did suffer a bit on the palette from the high hopping rates, as this did not glide down in a soft manner, and presented a bit of an edgy mouthfeel. I liked it well enough to get it downed quite rapidly."
"Drinkability is pretty good here. Beer needs some aging to get rid of the alcohol burn. Otherwise, a great doppelbock that makes me hunger for pizza."
"D: I was impressed by Double Dead Guy Ale, a smooth sipper that you need to be cautious with. I actually preferr regular dead guy to the double, wasnt to impressed by this, better off leaving the dead guy single"
"A: Patchy head, pale copper color, the bubbles rise slowly as though in a thickened gel - 4.25, S: This is one of those beers that doesn't need to be right under your nose to get the sense of it, citrus and bubble gum are two of the aromas that first hit me - 4.00, T: This is a hop bomb, lots of bitter and piney hops, some underlying sweetness from a heavy malt base which balances it out nicely - 4.25, M: Medium bodied which lingers on the tongue for a while - 4.25, D: Certainly an extreme beer, the amount of hops alone pushes this beer into the category, I recently had this on tap at RFD in DC, and was happy to know that I had a bottle waiting for me at home, I would recommend this beer - 4.25"
"Drinks okay for the abv, nothing special here. OVERPRICED, glad I tried it, not sure I'd ever have another"
"It's lighter than most doppelbocks, a nice amber color with a solid head that dissolves down and leaves good lacing. Nose is crazy sweet, molasses straight up. Beer is quite tasty. Cookies, sugar and malt are HUGE, and a slightly chalky aftertaste. Body is nice, medium, with perfect carbonation. Overall, a delicious and interesting beer - I haven't had the regular Dead Guy in a while, so I'm not really sure how it compares, but this is a delicious and sweet treat."
"M/D: Good mouthfeel. Medium bodied, carbonation is light. Decent drinkability as well. The alcohol is there, so it's a bit of a sipper, but it goes down easy."
"D: A good beer from Rogue, certainly gets more interesting as it warms up. I could drink it again, but I'm not going to pay $12 for a bottle, if it was a $4 bomber OK."
"Decent mouthfeel, not entirely unpleasant. Alcohol burn hampers my enjoyment of this somewhat. Neat bottle."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a light brown color with moderate carbonation and lacing. Smell is sweet caramel and malt. Taste is more sweet caramel, with hints of bread. Average mouthfeel and good drinkability. I'm curious to see how this one ages."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Buckeye brew engine. A good bitterness,balanced with lots of caramel, tasty stuff, average mouthfeel. A poetry of lacing on amber. 2-row Pale, Munich, C15. Hops. Cascade for boil, cystal for aroma.Good drinkability but the ABV halts this from being the mainstay."
"I prefer the standard Dead Guy as this one is a little too boozey for me. Still, I would have no problem revisiting from time-to-time."
"Notes: A solid ""double"" version of the Dead Guy Ale, not quite as extreme as I was anticipating, what with the bizarre packaging. Worth a try and I'll definitely want more of this one!"
"Felt a little sticky, but goes down well. Quite filling."
"Mouthfeel is again thinner, and more carbonated than regular DG. Finish is much dryer also due to higher bitterness levels, more carbonation, and higher bitterness levels."
"D: I love me a good Doppelboack and this is right up there. The price was a little high at $12 but it is an enjoyable beer. They called it Double Dead to capitalize on that name but this is a different beast. Very nice all around. While often slept on Rogue can make a damn fine beer."
"22 ouncer. great looking, bright red bottle. Pours clear medium honey amber, short lived medium tan head, that leaves better then average amounts of sticky lace. Nose is all about the malt, bready, sweet and enticing. A few slurps here reveals a quite over the top malty brew, peppery alcohol lingering in the rear. Strong and flavorful, bready/toasty malt continues with the theme.. Nothing spectacular as far as I can tell going on, however as a lover of ""double"" whatever style you have, this one is one I would buy and enjoy over and over again."
"Amber with about an 1 1/2 inch off white heat.The aroma is not overwhelming. I can pick up a bit of citrus, vanilla and bready goodness. The taste adds caramel and lots of hops. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is an intense beer. I found it fun to drink it a few ounce pour at a time. If you like Dead Guy, you're going to love this. If Dead Guy isn't your thing, skip this one."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a nice dense cream colored head that settled into a good cap with plenty of lacing. The aroma is of bready munich malt, grape like hops, and a touch of booze. Similar to a barley wine. The taste is of a bready honey malt, touch of peppery and grassy hop, some alcohol, grapes. Kind of a boozy, hoppy, munich lager, thus the double dead guy lager name. Definitley some barley wine characteristics though. The feel is thick and slick, soft carbonation and finishes with a nice hop bitterness. Definitely a big beer with some appealing characteristics. Not sure it is a dopplebock though."
"I see a lot of people referring to this as a Maibock and Doppelbock. It's neither. The bottle clearly indicates it is made with top fermenting Pacman yeast, so it's an ale, not a lager. I've seen some people classify this a Strong American Ale. That's how it was labeled when I bought it at the store. To me, it tastes more like an American Barley Wine."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark amber/red color with an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells like caramel malt, bread/biscuit, yeast and some citrusy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma but with some pepper and alcohol noticable. Also the hops come out much stronger in the finish than I expected as the bitter hops linger around a quite while. With that being said, there's still good balance in this beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and chewy and also has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and enjoyable to drink. Overall I think this is a good brew, I'd pick it up again for sure."
"Over the past week I have now had the DDGA on tap at Taco Mac and at home out of the 750 ml bottle. Overall, I am now thinking I preferred it on tap. As I poured the 750 ml bottle, you see a uhc lighter, but very beautiful copper color. Solid, but somewhat light head. The smell does not really indicate much, to be honest. I felt this was the biggest shortcoming of the beer. The taste was interesting balance of a lighter than usual dopple, with a lot flavor. The hops are very strong in the flavor. There is a fairly present carbonization, which adds to the some what bitter aftertaste. A very drinkable beer, but nothing groundbreaking. I wanted to echo another person's feeling of let down, I had hoped to age a few of these, but am wondering if it is worth it now..."
"Pours a clear darkish golden/amber with a Huge tan foamy head. The head is gigantic and the leaves great lacing. The smell is strong with ""bisquity"" aromas along with alcohol,vanilla,and bitter hops. The taste is a combination of bitter hops,bread yeast,and alcohol. A nice flavor that's not too harsh and bitter for a high octane brew. The m/f heavy with all the flavors mixing well. A pretty good beer from my all time favorite brewery. Cheers."
"750 mL bottle. Pours a clear deep amber with 3 cm of tan foamy mostly diminishing head. Aroma of caramel, yeast, and hops. Initial flavor of sweet caramel malt. Flavor becomes more balanced as the citrus hops show up on the back end. Aftertaste is fairly bitter and long lasting. Light carbonation, light lacing, light to medium body, and definite alcohol presence especially as it warms. Overall another well done beer by Rogue and worth a try"
"Why not release a better beer such as something out of John's Locker stock?"
"D: This is a huge and filling beer that is easy to drink. I would save this one for special occasions and special meals. Halloween is coming up and in a dream world people would hand this out instead of candy. Plus, the bottle is a keeper."
"D- a very good ale with take you by surprise strength recommended with valor, two purple hearts."
"Double Dead Guy poured a hazy copper color with a nice one finger off-white head. Minimal lacing, but good retention on the inside of the glass. The smell was not as potent as I thought from my first experience, however the aroma is very complex with caramel malt, bread-like yeast, piney hops, and of course the smell of alcohol. The caramel malts hit you first in the mouth, then the sweetness fades out to a strong hop finish with a long hang time. This beer is full-bodied and viscous with medium carbonation. Double Dead Guy is surprisingly easy to drink, however the alcohol will catch up to you very quickly! Highly recomended... if you can find it."
"Yes, the aroma is like a Manhattan pothole, coming out of nowhere to almost take off a wheel, but the rest of the crew comes to the rescue and it's worth the patience it takes to not disregard it. The alcohol is a sneaky monkey, much stronger than it presents, but that also helps it drink willingly, if a bit daringly as well. So I have no idea how the smell comes up so damned short, but it's recoverable, and I'm glad it was, in the end."
"D: Very drinkable as the whole bomber was easy to finish. Very nice mix of all the flavors and a beer I really enjoyed."
"D: Good brew that has a lot going on. The alcohol really can hit you hard if this thing is warm. The flavor and aroma are very good. I would absolutely drink this again, especially if the bottle price drops a bit. As for now the price negatively affects the drinkability to me."
"D - this is a very tasty beer that's easy to drink, just watch out for the abv."
"Overall, you must get this beer if haven't already!!! Seriously."
"Fairly drinkable. I'd have another."
"It's on the fuller side of medium-bodied. Alcohol is noticeable, but not sharp. Drinks well despite that. This is a nice one!"
"Double Dead Guy is a great beer, and one that I expected a lot from. Happily, I wasn't too let down. It was way easier to drink than I expected it to be, as my empty glass attests to. Again, it can be a little hot, but not really that much, especially considering the 9% abv. Recommended."
"Overall I was hoping for a bit more, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good beer. Worth a shot if for no other reason than it's a limiting offering from the boys at Rogue."
"I like this stuff better than the regular Dead Guy now, even with the extra octane they managed to keep things in control and give it all an extra boost of goodness. I'll have to save my paper route money for another $16 CAN bottle of this stuff!"
"Very good beer, thanks Rogue for finally bottling this. I've had it on tap, but for $6 in an 8 ounce glass. This is by far a better value at $11 for 22 ounces."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into a pint glass in three servings (cool bottle by the way). Pours a copper color with huge, thick head and a lot of lacing. I had to let it settle for a few minutes before drinking. Smeels mildly malty, with sweetness and citrus mixed it. The hops are noticable, but the 9% ABV is not. Moderate to heavy body with mild carbonation. Tastes malty and sweet, but not overly malty. Tastes somewhat smokey to me. It goes down smooth and is a very drinkable doppelbock. I enjoyed this."
"Drinkability: That wasn't half bad! Rather drinkable considering the 9.5% ABV, I must say. Though I'm definitely glad I found it reasonably priced on draft as opposed to plunking down the dough for the bottle -- I don't want to be a Double Broke Guy."
"An interesting sample from Rogue... In my opinion, certainly not worth the price... More than anything your'e paying the extra dollar for the cool bottle..."
"It's hard to say much about this one, except maybe that it's a slightly stronger Dead Guy Ale. It's certainly not a doppelbock in the traditional sence, as it's less malty and sweet. Plus, it's brewed with an Ale yeast (Pacman) like Deadguy is. Maybe it's lagered? I don't know. It's hard to call an Ale a Lager when it's crossing one of the more fundamentel boundaries of beer (top vs. bottom fermented). Either way, it's decent, but not the most enjoyable beer I've ever had. This one's open for interpretation."
"D: Nice beginning, middle, and finish. I recommend picking up a 22oz., throwing it in your freezer for 20-30 min (if bought at room temperature) like I did. Drink the first part of the ""bomber"" at freezer temp and then allow it to warm. It truly gives the full spectrum of the beer's potential. FYI: I do the same with ommegang's three philosophers and unibroue cheque chose? Not sure if I got the spelling right. It's unibroue's low carbonation cherry beer (I'm too lazy to check the spelling)"
"Poured a clear reddish color with a small head that dissipated quickly. I expected more carbonation from this beer. Aroma was hoppy, but with a good bit of sweet, honeyish malt aromas mixed in. Taste was quite sweet up front with some notes of honey and caramel. The finish had a sharp alcohol bite. I think this one needs 6 months or more of aging to round out as it was overly sweet and cloying. Drinkability was slightly above average. I plan on picking up another couple of bottles to lay down."
"This was a great session beer that I would love to enjoy again."
"Overall a pretty tasty brew , recommended."
"D - Just shy of refreshing, but certainly drinkable. I've enjoyed better offerings from Rogue and for me the 9% ABV detracts from an otherwise nicely crafted ale."
"T: the most important part, not bad. if this is truly a dopplebock its underwhelming. there is a skosh of caramel and malt taste but its light and mellow. this is an easy drinking bock beer that has the 9% sneak up on you"
"Bocks lead malt-first all the way while this is leaning on the hops side. Bocks can get sickly sweet and sticky, while DDG gets abrasively bitter as it warms. The style issue has been beat pretty hard here, so I'll just say that I enjoy this high-gravity ale, and while it's not the best effort Rogue's put out, it's certainly an enjoyable night's drink."
"Pours a clear amber color, with a big frothy off-white head that settles fairly slowly. Aroma is somewhat dried fruit and sweet, chock full of malty goodness. Flavor has a nice, initially subdued hop presence that become more and more apparent. The heavy malt load helps create enough sweetness to mask the high 9% abv. Mouthfeel is full bodied, surprisingly less sticky than i would've expected. Tasty brew from Rogue. Surprised how un-deadguy the taste appears to be, but i'd have to do a side by side tasting to be certain."
"Worth drinking once but not that much better than regular DEAD GUY imo"
"Never would have pegged this as a doppelbock. Actually more of a slightly mild DIPA. I'll sure buy more."
"D- I don't think I meant to drink 750mL, but the bottle, which is sprayed red, is deceiving for its size, appearing more like 22oz which is somehow mentally more justifiable than drinking all 750mL. Either way, I found it very easy to sip on. Satisfying without being at all too heavy. Very nicely flavored, not getting old at all, but leaving the kind of lingering taste that causes you to keep putting the glass to the lips for more. At 9% abv the alcohol is respectfully well balanced into the overall character of the beer and has little negative impact beyond physical effect on the body."
"I felt the nose and taste were very complex and the beer grew on me as I drank it. I still would not rate this as a doppelbock. This is more of an American ale or brown ale?? Hard to catagorize this one. A good beer in an interesting package. There are several in their new lineup but some others are rather pricy."
"taste is watery at first then thickens up as it warms, grapefruit hops, malt, few sweet fruits, touch of caramel, ends with a very bitter aftertaste and slightly dry."
"I'd like to try this again in bottle to see how it compares."
"The beer is poured a copper a colour with a nice two finger head. Really good retention and lacing. The nose on the beer is malty with a bit of spicy hops. the beer has a nice bitter hoppiness with a nice caramel maltiness. This is NOT a dopplebock. it's probably closer to an strong American ale or something. The mouthfeel is quite thick and this beer is really drinkable."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"This is an interesting brew, it is surprisingly hoppy in the flavor and hides its alcohol fairly well (though it can get hot at times with the peppery alcohol notes in the finish)."
"D- scary close to dead guy ale though subtle differences can be noted, mostly in the malt department, rare brew so do try, though I wouldn't pay a rare price (if you have too that is)"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet maltiness, with hints of alcohol and hops. In the taste, sweet maltinessand a nice big hop presence. A bitter hop and a big mouthfeel, with a semi-dry hop and hints of alcohol in the aftertaste. Big hops, big alcohol, and a bit abbrasive, yet quite good."
"The flavor is a lot like regular Dead Guy, just, well...""Doubled"". Double the hops, double the malts, double the sweetness, and double my enjoyment. The hops are the highlight here, and while the resinous pine notes don't necessarily fit within the Dopplebock style, I definately enjoyed it. Body is creamy smooth, medium-bodied, neatly carbonated, and provides a lasting hoppy bite. I'd definately look for this beer again, and I hope to god that Rogue decides to bottle it."
"Deep amber-copper color with an off-white, foamy, fully diminishing head. The smell is predominantly of citrusy and floral hops, with a little caramel malt in there. Not as big I was expecting from DOUBLE Dead Guy. The taste is quite a bit bigger, with a big initial hit of citrusy and piney hops. Grapefruit for sure, then the outmatched malts show up for a little while before being shoved out of the way by the bitterness and warm alcohol on the finish. It has a medium-full body, light creamy texture, and moderate carbonation. I don't know. Something about this beer just didn't impress me at all. It was good, but I still consider it a bit of a let-down. And I DEFINITELY have to knock some points off for it not being a good example of a doppelbock at all."
"""Malts: 2-row Pale, Munich, C15. Hops. Cascade for boil (because John was out pf Perle) and Crystal for aroma (because John was out of Sterling ...) IBU's approx 50-60. 19.8 Plato Original Gravity, 4.9 Plato Terminal Gravity."""
"Notes: Not really sure how to describe this, style-wise, which makes sense given that regular Dead Guy is a bastardized style anyhow (a maibock is a lager yet they use an ale yeast). At times I thought this reminded me more of a Strong Ale, while at other times I was actually thinking American Barleywine, bordering on DIPA. I'd get it again though, whatever you want to call it. . . ."
"D: If I think of this as a dark IPA, I'm ok with it, but I'd much prefer the original Dead Guy ale over this one. Dead Guy is a wonderfully balanced beer. This isn't."
"The beer poured a clear, dark amber with a thin, dense, tan head into a chalice. Aroma was of piney hops. The beer was very well balanced, with a big hop flavor coalescing with a honey-malt sweetness, and with a solid bitter hop finish. A much better effort than the Skull Splitter, which I had the same day. A great ""upgrade"" to the standard Dead Guy Ale."
"D- Good and drinkable but I think I prefer the regular Dead Guy to the double."
"Nice beer, and will have again if it's not gone before I go back."
"D: I'm not sure I'd want another"
"On tap at Cole's in Buffalo,poured into a standard pint glass a hazed lighter amber with some dark orange tint a frothy smaller head atop.Noticeable honey and caramel malt in the nose with underlying pine resin hop,a bit heavy not a great midafternoon brew after stuffing your face like I did today but thats my own fault,sweet honey notes mixed with some toasty caramel biscuit finishing with that Rogue trade mark of citric/piney hop bitterness.A nice newer version of the old DG classic nice flavors."
"Overall I thought this was excellent and much smoother then I ever thought it would be. A better version of dead guy would be the best way to descrivbe it. Go out and get this one while you can."
"D: Hoppy and full bodied. Bold brew. I could easily finish two to three pints without blinking and would be very satisfied."
"Clear medium copper-amber body with a creamy, off-white head. Fresh pine hops and caramel malt are the pillars here with rummy alcohol and fruits mixing in. Taste starts with very piny hop bitterness. Balancing caramel and fruit malt sweetness comes to the rescue. Warming rummy fruits and deep malt goodness take center stage. Hints of vanilla in there. Herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Full-bodied with a creamy feel. A very drinkable stronger version of Dead Guy that really shines as it warms up. Very nice!"
"D-For a brew this big this is smooth stuff. I am sure the high ABV...it must be 10+% would keep you from downing too many. Certainly NOT a dopplebock but regardless an interesting experiment by Rogue."
"Overall- A little harsh around the edges. Give it a try!"
"I liked this. It truelly is a double Dead Guy ale, maintaining the sweet flavors and hoppiness of the original, while successfully adding a bigger and badder feel with the jacked up ABV. Actually, even with the higher alcohol element, I still found this to be a highly drinkable affair and one that I would return to."
"Served a crisp dark orange with a decent head that diminished and left spotty lacing. The aroma was loads of caramel and some roasted malts. The taste was a wonderful complex blend of caramel, dried fruits, brown malts and some sweet fruits. The beer is slightly heavy with some sticky alcohol. This one is a great sipper but still very refreshing."
"D: This brew benefits from resting after the pour...then look out...its a mouthful of joy. I question classing this as a doppelbock but whatever it is called it's a winner."
" Thanks Brian."
"Just not thrilled with this one and probably won't order it again."
"I usually really enjoy a big beer, but as good as this was I don't think it was an improvement over the standard Dead Guy."
"from a freshly tapped keg, it poured a fairly clear dark orangeish amber with an off white head that held well and left sheets of lace on the glass. normally, i'm not a fan of dead guy from the bottle, but on tap it's been excellent, so i had to give this one a shot. it's pretty much what i expected, an amped up dead guy with a lot more hops. very piney. almost overrode the nice caramelly and fruity malt character. i wished it was a bit creamier, and thought it would be hard to have a few, but enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Cheers"
