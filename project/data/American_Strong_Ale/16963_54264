4.31,5.1,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"a real showcase of bourbon barrels here. tons of vanilla, sweetness, wood, and warming alcohol in this brick red colored brew with extraordinary depth. shortish off white head caps off a dark and intriguing brew. the nose here is heavily oaked, with notes of dried cherries and brown sugar. i smell a little alcohol too, but nothing out of place. sweeter red malt starts the flavor trip, but its mellowed nicely by all the oak, which now gets a bit more nuanced with char, must, and tremendous vanilla character. layers of grain and wood compliment each other well, and all the residual sugar i anticipated from the nose is about gone, or at least not slowing this down at all. a very cool beer, soaked with rich bourbon flavors but still being rather drinkable, i could take down a bomber of this without a worry. decadent mouthfeel with just a tickle of booze and a very long finish like warm bread pudding. one of marbles best beers, i hope they make it back to colorado before long, i think they have all brought something unique to the table.","StonedTrippin","Jan 19, 2014"

Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and slight bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think the barrel aged presence is slightly better in the taste.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 24, 2013"

A bouquet of dark fruit, underlying oakiness, light bourbon accents, and vanilla on the nose. Dates upfront, hints of plum, and currants joined by caramel and toffee notes midpalate. Finishes with a bit of apple peel, a bit of hop bitterness, and bourbon soaked oak. Big full body; syrupy but lightened by some fluffy creaminess. This really is a fantastic brew.
