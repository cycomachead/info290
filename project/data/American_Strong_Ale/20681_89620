Nice aroma with the characteristic Maine yeast, floral hops, light citrus sweetness, some bready malt. For the ABV, the aroma comes off very delicate. Nice. Flavor is nicely bitter citrus rind, floral flavors, lemon peel, some pine, sweet malty bready backbone. Medium bodied, medium carbonation with just a touch of prickle, dry bitter, dank. Basically a DIPA here bordering on very light barleywine, but comes off relatively light on the palate. This is really nice.","BMMillsy","Jan 21, 2015"

Aroma is full of candied citrus hops some pine and sweet apricot hops. Also quite malty and balanced with caramel, fruit cake. The first sip really brings a potent hop delivery. Spicy, herbal hops. Pine, dried grass, grapefruit, candied oranges. Hefty maltiness but it finishes rather dry. Caramel, sweet dough and crusts. Quite bitter. Noticeable alcohol. Pretty aggressive. Interestingly enough, it becomes softer as it warms. Full bodied. A tongue dryer. Not my favorite Maine brew; still pretty tasty. Definitely a nice, hoppy offering that pairs excellently with the bitter cold weather outside.","VelvetExtract","Beers"

Pours a slightly murky golden amber color with a frothy off white head that persists forever sticking lots of lace on the sides. Aromas of earth pine brown sugar and caramel. The flavor is bit sweet with hints of caramel and raw brown sugar with a solid hit of earthy pine and resin. Toffee and light fruit with a bit of alcohol flavor round us out. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sticky creamy resinous mouthfeel. I drank this at the wrong time I think. Either super fresh when the hops still popped or with more age to bring forward more fruit and subdued hops. I'm interested enough in seeing how this develops that I may pick up a bottle on my way out of town to cellar for a bit.","johnnnniee","Jul 17, 2014"

Sharp citrus grapefruit aromas followed by pine hops and sticky sweet caramel malt. Ripe pineapple and boozy aromas begin to surface as this warms along with intensifying maltiness. Full bodied with a thick oily feel and very soft, light carbonation. The hop flavors are in reverse of the aroma. Big pine hop bite with biting tropical citrus flavors beneath and a sturdy, sweet caramel malt backbone. Finished with a light pine hop bitterness. An excellent hop forward strong ale.","IronLover","Mar 08, 2014"

The hop profile is one dimensional with very bitter, tongue coating dryness that is a bit overwhelming. Dirty and soil like with a ton of grass and pine flavor countered by spicy rye, leather, toffee and subtle vinous fruit. The caramel malt sweetness and vinous dark fruit notes found in the aroma are almost completely overpowered. The high ABV is well masked with only a touch of heat and alcohol sweetness but this beer is still tough to drink and is in desperate need of some balance. Not a bad beer but it lacks complexity and drinking all 16.9oz was a bit of a chore.","corby112","Feb 25, 2013"

It's kind of a cop-out. No matter what you decide to call it, this is an excellent beer. It features one of the more memorable hop profiles I've come across in a while, and it drinks far too easily to be 9.1% abv.

The hops aren't big enough for to be a DIPA but the malt is too much to make a regular IPA/hoppy red. Neither seem big enough to make it a strong ale/barleywine.

Great floral\citrus nose that you find in the best DIPA's (which this beer reminded me more of than the boozier\maltier profile of an American Strong). Contained a unique sweetness that reminded me of watermelon. Hop forward but not a bomb, overall a solid balance. Extremely drinkable for the ABV. A real exceptional beer from MBC.","BKBassist","0"
3.98,-4.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.75,"The beer pours an odd and ruddy red/candied brown with slight hints of orange. The head is nicely sized and colored almost a sand dune white. The beer’s body is murky, but not dense, with a nice clouding, while the beer’s lacing is light and stringy on the glass, leaving a few strands. On the nose, the beer smells of big piney hops with just a touch of fruity mango and onion. The malt sits below the hops as a very light caramelly touch mixed with some lovely breadiness that blends beautifully with the piney hops. On the tongue, the beer tastes rather straight forward with big grapefruit and pine bitters, with a touch of sweet malts which lead me to think of ruby red grapefruit juice. This taste is sadly subdued for what I was hoping. The beer begins with bitter aspirin, which quickly opens into grapefruit melding with light sweet malts that bring big ruby red grapefruit flavors to the mouth. The finish is strong with grapefruit and pine and a big rush of alcoholic heat, though no alcoholic flavors are present at all. The aftertaste rings nicely with light pine and some sweet caramel malt. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a little bit of heaviness on the tongue. The beer is smooth and creamy, with a nice crispness to it that does leave me feeling slightly refreshed. The mouth is left slightly damp, with only a ghost of the dryness coming off from the hops. Overall this beer is a bit of a disappointment. It is not a horrible beer, but it really doesn’t have the complexity of other Maine Beer Company beers. It reminds me of Celebration, only with more heat in the finish, which is nice I guess, but not worth the $9 I paid for it… The beer really just feels like a Double IPA to me, as I am really not getting enough of the malt from it. The beer is simple and tasty, but I was hoping for so much more and it just did not deliver. This beer is good, but I wouldn’t try it for its price point.","Maxwell","Feb 10, 2013"
