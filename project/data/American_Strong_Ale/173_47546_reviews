"Perhaps this style isn't exactly my thing, or the bottle was off, but i did not enjoy this. Very strong and overly sweet. Molten malt body with very little hop presence. Barrel notes overpowering."
"2010 vintage.  Strongly disliked it.  Smokey with off flavors.  Flat as usual with HotD."
""
"2010 vintage. Not for me, too smokey, strange flavor...smelled pretty good though. Not a big fan of these flat beers HotD does, but apparently I'm an 'outlier'."
"This was just horrible. My name is Matt and I am embarrassed.  Too much smoke and not enough other flavors coming through."

"I sadly did not enjoy this beer.  I found it way too overpowering."
""
""
"I'm a tobacco chewer and this is like having a chew. Strong tobacco character, looks great, smells ok. Tastes like a chew spitter. Not good."
""
""
""
"Tastes smokey, very little barrel present. It's like a baltic porter mixed with an old ale. Sweet and smokey, interesting to the point that I have few words to describe it, but it's an assault on the palate in a bad way as much as it is in a good way. Would not buy again for a while."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another incredible offering from HotD, no one does high gravity beers that age as gracefully! I only wish I had another vintage bottle, but I'm excited to crack the 2013!"

"Pour is extremely dark brown, murky, tan head.  Nose has olive, chocolate malt, some peat and a light smokiness to it.  Hints of caramel and brown sugar with a tough of dates.  Taste is much more smokey and peaty, almost scotch esq.  meaty an salty in the flavor, hints of the rich chocolate malt.  Some sweeter berry malt in back.   Maybe some iodine in there.  Body is full with soft carb and creamy feel."

"So glad I got to try this. The lack of carbonation really hurts the last couple of categories, but you can't have everything. Especially with HotD, I suppose. Still a very good beer."

"Overall- Typical Hair of the Dog. Remarkably complex strong ale that gives you a lot to think about. Most certainly one of the better ""strong ales"" I've had."

"O: Pretty serious brew. Super complex but nothing is overpowering. Garnering balance with this high ABV and multiple barrel agings is a rare thing but they pull it off pretty well. I'm not a fan of smoky beers but the huge sweetness and barrel aging has tempered the smoked malts quite well. Don't get me wrong, it's still smoky and meaty but it's tolerable for me. This one is very sweet, syrupy sweet and heavy. A sipper for sure. Dessert beer. Very unique."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The smoke and the apple brandy are the stars here and they play off each other extremely well. A very decadent and unique beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a beer that I feel so incredibly fortunate to ever have to opportunity to drink. My highest rated beer thus far. It shares the amazing mellow, well balanced, alcohol hiding barrel aged qualities with the other heavy hitters such as BCBS but is far more flavorful, complex and unique in my opinion."
""
""

"2013 was the clear winner, thanks again to Chris and Jeff for putting this pair together."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is malt, smoke, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a very earthy and woody set of aromas and flavors."
""
""
"2013 vintage. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with hardly any head at all. Doesn't look very carbonated, but there are a few bubbles on the side of the glass. Sweet, bourbon, candy-like aromas. Some woody and apple notes are noticeable as well. Lots of complexity here. Smells absolutely delicious. First taste is insane. Feels thin and basically flat. Some heat is obvious, along with delicious bourbon and apple brandy barrel flavors. The finish is wood and smoke, but somehow in an incredible way for me. This beer is really throwing me for a loop, as it is unlike anything I've had before. But I am really enjoying it. This was my only bottle, but I will have to get more. This would age VERY well. Overall, Hair of the Dog has blown my mind yet again, this time with the most recent release of Matt. Can't wait to try Otto. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall- Definitely lives up to the hype. A little disappointed that I couldn't get bottles but still happy to be drinking this. Definitely worth 15 bucks, maybe even 20."
""
""
"taste - holy cow. did not expect to enjoy it this much. I knew I would like it because 99% of the beer they make is fantastic, but this immediately vaulted into my top 5. maybe it was the 3 years of aging, but this was just a masterpiece of what a barrel aged strong ale can be. sweet but not too sweet. Boozy, but not over the top. almost tastes like some sort of sweet liqure blended with the malt and hops of a beer. just nothing like it. The Cherry Adam from the wood had similar qualities, but this beer did it without any added fruit. I now see why people were lined up to buy cases of the 2013 batch."

"Hair of the Dog makes some great beer and this very well could be their best. It's so rich, fruity, smokey and delicious that I can't stop thinking about it. If you get any chance to give this beer a try, trade, steal, or cheat to get it. Thanks again, Dave!"
""

"Great, great beer"
""

"As far as big, sweeter boozy beers go, this is one of the best I've had. Very complex and enjoyable. As it warms, the apple really comes through."
""
""
""
"Matt's presence on my palate is also huge; thick, chewy, viscous, oily, and sticky, and you'll be tasting Matt long after you've swallowed. Left over oak, booze, and fading dark fruits will coat your mouth for days if you forget to brush. Just an incredible beer when all was said and done. I can't thank Jeff enough for cracking this one. If I ever had the chance, I'd buy as much of this as I could afford."

""

"Perhaps the most complex beer I've ever tasted, and absolutely one of the best."
""
""
""
"7.2/10"
""
"O - This definitely holds the spot as most complex and interesting beer I've had. Would want to drink it all the often, but would certainly have it again. HotD talks about making old styles of ales and this one exemplifies that. Matt really does taste like an antique beer. Amazing work of creating complexity and depth in a beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite beers. So complex, so much going on. Alan Sprints needs to make this one again soon."
"Cost: $15 for a 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unique and awesome beer, though not my favorite from HOTD."
"O - This was an absolutely amazing beer and another home run from HOTD."
""
""
"Overall. A fantastic and very original beer. Haven't had aything like it before and would definitely like to have it again one day. Between this and the AftW I just had, I think these guys have redeemed themselves after my flat Doggie Claws ;-)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A beer i had been wanting to try for a very long time, glad I was finally able to do so. An amazing beer, which along with AftW live up to their reputation."
""
""
""
"O- One of the best I've had from HotD. An incredible beer to sip and savor."
""
"Edit: After having this one on tap for the 2013 vintage, I have come to the conclusion that this is my favorite beer right now and deserves a bump accordingly."
"The 2010 vintage pours with light carbonation into a murky deep coffee-brown body. There's very little head, but a pale ring of lacing. What is remarkable about this beer is how the elements of taste surge and fade like voices in counterpoint. Smells of sweet bourbon and light raisins greet the nose and they linger over dried apple and smoke. The taste comes and goes: a sharp dried apple sweetness, a slight alcoholic edge that pervades, a deeper sweetness of molasses and milk chocolate, smoke and charred oak, finishing on a quiet chocolate astringency. The body is medium to thick, the beer is sweet, not cloying, and in the delicate interplay of powerful flavours is one remarkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Really really nice stuff. The nose and flavor are so unique and come through nicely. Definitely a nice brew that I'm extremely glad I had the opportunity to try!"
"Overall: This beer is awesome! I havent have a really good American Strong Ale in a long time and this was just fantastic! I have wanted to try this beer for a long time and it does not dissapoint! I gotta try this beer fresh... when ever the next batch of matt is released! 4.75"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I waited a while to drink this and I'm happy I did. It was everything I expected it to be, and it's definitely the best HotD beer I've had so far...but I have yet to open my bottle of Adam FTW. Either way, I'm thrilled to have another bottle and to see what happens to this with some more age. Next time I'm drinking this cellar temp though, no reason at all to chill it. Great stuff by HotD, this is worth the hype."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nicely balanced with lots of complex flavors coming together. The smoked malts are a nice touch."
""
""
"Overall: Another winner from HotD - I have yet to have anything other than world class beers from this brewery! I will most certainly be getting some more bottles of Matt when a fresh batch is released."
"355mL courtesy of SuzyGreenberg. Pours a flat, clear, deep brown with some faint bubbles (who cares though!). Aroma is big rum raisin, dark fruits, apple brandy/calvados, baked apples, coconut, milk chocolate. Taste is light calvados, rich and mellow dark fruits, smores, toffee. Very refined, complex. Yummy yum yum. 4/12/2010 9/4/9/5/18=4.5"
""
""
"12 oz bottle shared at the September 2012 Santa Cruz tasting. Pours deep brown with no head. Sweet spicy bourbon aroma, prunes, raisins, wine grapes. Brown sugar flavor with some campfire smokiness, mild soy, dark fruits. Sweet and strong and delicious."
""
""
""
""
"o - REALLY awesome. I dig this A LOT. probably my favorite of the night. smoke is really present in the nose, but that's it...a bit in the taste, but it works well. it is part of the barrel. would definitely have this again and seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"Among the best beers I've had. Really really tasty stuff. If I could make a fruit-whiskey jolly rancher, this is what it would taste like. It pleases me greatly that my namesake beer is so damn good."
""
""
"Verdict: Definitely a sipper, unique blend of flavors between the smokiness and fruitiness, bourbon and the malt. A great brew that everyone should get to try once."
""
"Leathery, boozy, tobacco-y, smokey malt aroma and flavors dance around my senses at every sip & whiff. Black licorice and molasses impart even more darkness as I swish in my mouth. Boozy warmth throughout, creating an intense, bold flavor profile. So creative, so complex. And not for the faint of heart :)"
""
"O: Delicious and wonderful balance between the elements. Definite sipper. Could use a tad more carbonation, which along with the booziness knocks this a few points, but delicious nonetheless."
""
""
"This is an absolutely insanely good beer. The level of complexity is mind-boggling. It's almost overwhelming. Smooth, delectable and incredibly complex—genuinely one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
"o - Overall I liked this one a lot, though it is very different. I preferred Cherry AtfW, AftW, and FftW, but this is still a great beer I'd like to have again."
"Edit - I was fortunate enough to revisit this in the form of the new 2013 release. I must applaud Allan, this is absolutely the same stellar brew and merits a slight increase in the ratings for consistency."
""
""
"O - Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic."
"Matt pours a medium bodied, sticky dark dark molasses brown in color with no head, just light beige bubbles. The nose on this one is complex and smells like something I've had before but can't out my finger on. It features sweet malt, molasses, maple syrup, leather, tobacco, figs, oak, and light smoke. The flavors are almost identical. It's slightly dry so I get plenty of spicy tobacco and oak up front. It's followed by figs, plum, and raisin. It just has this earthiness about it. I really dig it. It drinks like an old ale and doesn't feature any alcohol at all. It drinks medium in body and coats your palate. It's really enjoyable. This beer is great so I hope it isn't too difficult to chase down."
""
"O- Really a standout beer. Complex, layered and blended nicely. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a little more carbonation. I was a little disappointed with the lack of bourbon I was able to pull out of this beer. Overall though, a definite must try."
"O. A fascinating beer and one-of-a-kind experience. It's quite likely I'll never quite find a beer like it. The number of flavors this thing presents is incredible, and it strikes a surprisingly impressive balance between all of them. Hop, malt, booze all get their turn here, and all add up to a very impressive concoction. Definitely over-the-top sticky and cloying, so beware of that, but the sheer breadth of diversity in the flavor profile in this is awesome. Not a perfect beer, but extremely daring and the results speak for themselves. Great job, HotD!"
""
"O - Glad I had the opportunity to try this rarity. This one lived up to the hype. Really great beer and another good one from Hair of the Dog. I was worried it would be past its prime but it's still drinking great. Hope they release this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours dark brown, almost black. No carbonation at all. Aroma of dark dried fruit, bourbon with hints of vanilla and caramel. Rich, complex flavor dominated by dark fruit, dark malts, chocolate and caramel sweetness. Finishes sweet with some wood overtones. A bit sweet. Would have scored a 10 with some carbonation. I'll age one."
""
""
"Overall - It's a fascinating beer. I honestly don't know how much I like it. The flavors are amazing, although I don't know how well they go together. Unique enough to really impress me, though."
"Overall, another solid effort from HOTD; they tend to produce beers over and over right up my alley. Looking forward to my Adam from the Wood patiently tucked away in my cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied, but lighter then it looked. Carbonation is low. Overall it was a really good beer. It felt a little overly sweet with the candi sugar at first, as it warmed though things really started coming together. The finish is where things really stood out for me in it, the barrel aging, slight smoked malt and balancing bitterness really worked together well."
""
""
"12oz bottle of the 2011 version of my namesake. Slight hint of apples on the aroma. Taste of smoke, oak, hides the alcohol remarkably well for 12.5%. This is delicious. Caramel, smoky, Apple, bourbon greatness. A sipper well worth the hype. Now if only I could find more of it..."
"This was a smooth, smooth beer to drink. The carbonation was extremely light. This one is defiantly one to take on slowly and enjoy sip by sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, I know I'm really supposed to like this beer a lot, but it just doesn't work for me. This is as slow a sipper as there can be. This would work much better in a small, small serving. It is fairly complex with a host of sugary sweet flavors to it, but it is just too overpowering for its own good. I'm getting thru the bottle but it is slow going. I would not call this one of my favorite American Strong Ales."
"Poured from the bottle into a few taster glasses. Color was the darkest of browns, maroon around the edges, opaque, no head to speak of, although light swirling produced a tiny bit of unexpected lacing. Nice aroma, indicative of the complexity that I'd soon be tasting: dark fruits and lots of them, booze, wood, esters, thick dark malts. Lots of sumptuous dark fruit in the taste--raisins, prunes, figs--no disguising the booze, smooth chocolate (lingered into the aftertaste), with hints of smoke and herbal hops. All things considered, the mouthfeel was amazingly smooth and velvety; obviously you want to let this one sit on the palate and get the full gambit of flavors from it. Very nice, and very savorable. I have a couple extra bottles of this that I'm going to let age for a while. Should be interesting to see how they taste in a few years, but they're obviously ready for consumption now."
""
""
""
"Flavors are a bit muted so I suspect this is a bit past it's prime. Would love to get a bottle from the newer batch to compare. "
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a great of example of barrel aging done right! The base beer is complex and interesting, and the barrel aging is done just long enough to add complexity to the base beer instead of dominating it. Phenomenally complex and enjoyable; I hope to run into it again. Along with Adam and Fred, this one is another stellar brew from Hair of the Dog. A limited release definitely worth tracking down. Thanks again for the trade boatshoes. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Overall this beer and parabola really remind me of each other. Both great, lots of smoky notes and some kings of spirits but not too much. Nice stuff."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a minimal white head. Smell is a fantastic mix of bourbon, brandy and chocolate with hints of alcohol and dark fruits. Taste follows the smell - the brandy and bourbon come together perfectly and combines with a bit of roasted malt and a bit of smoke. It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall, this is really a great beer that doesn't really taste like anything else out there. Probably my favorite HOTD beer thus far."
"overall: exceptional"
""
"O: One fantastic brew that I wish came in a bigger bottle. Hint, Hint!"
""
""
"Overall a mixed bag. Aroma and taste are really complex and surprising, but the beer's flatness leaves me wishing for so much more. Next time I'll do a side/side between Matt and Adam, the similarities are pretty obvious."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body, really sweet, strong, very dry, a little too dry for me, but the more I drink the more I like it. Strong, sweet, nice liquor backbone, leading up to a bitterness-less finish that leave the mouth dry. I would have liked a less dry finish but ultimately this was good."
"The beer appears nearly still and a dark brown color. The aroma is nice, with a lot of booze, pepper, spice, fruit, barrels. Smooth on the palate. Low carbonation with less booze in the flavor than was present in the aroma. Complex and delicious, this one is a slow sipper. Great blend of bourbon and fruit flavors, with light spice. Overall, a terrific beer. Glad to have finally tried it. It is my name, after all."

"O: A wonderful beer that is very smooth and a pleasure to drink. I wish I had a whole bottle to spoil myself with. Thanks for sharing, Mike."
"Easy to sip. Smooth, creamy, and full-bodied. There is just enough carbonation to let the full battery of flavors open up on the palate. Just about perfect in every way."
""
"O - Like this beer a lot, would love to drink it regularly when I'm in the mood for a strong ale that's been put in bourbon. Well done."
""
""
"O- Glad to have tried this and would gladly have another. Thanks so much Scott!"

"O- Just a touch more carbonation and I can't imagine it getting any better. Very glad I got a chance to try this one. Thanks Jim!"

"Overall: Very good beer. Very solid and highly recommended. I am becoming more and more impressed with HotD"
"O- very, very good. I must have!"
"O - a really great and complex but excellently balanced beer. Staying on my wants"
"The body is full but it's flat. We really need some carbonation to pull this together. Overall this taste great and smells great. It just needs some carbonation. This is my fourth HotD beer and the second that has been flat. That simply dissapoints."
"I like this a lot. The lacking carbonation might be very off putting to many, I don't seem to mind it here."
"An amazing beer. Much better than I thought it would be."
"A great beer. Stunning aroma and flavour combine to provide a wonderful dessert beer. Well done Alan."
"Now I'm going to drink a Cigar City BA Milk Porter by myself and forget about it. Literally."
"3, 4, 5, 4, 4.5"
"A most generous gift from inflateablechair. This one poured a murky, reddish-brown color with just a suggestion of bubbles on top. Aromas of red apples, bourbon, plums, dates and molasses. On the palate, this one was rich, full bodied and very nearly still, with flavors of bourbon, oak, dried fruits, leather and chocolate. An extremely complex and delicious beer."
"This was certainly flavorful and complex but still had a bit of rawness to it from the barrel that held this back a bit for me. I’d love to try this with a bit more age on it, as I’ll bet this one soothes out nicely. It was still really awesome that I was able to buy this here at the brewery."
"Overall: I could easily drink a few of these, but my liver probably would be upset. Incredibly complex, a real treat!"
"O: I'm a wine guy as well, so I love a beer that reminds me of a fine port or brandy. Love this beer. A sipper for sure. Thanks again Eric!"
"O: Worth every penny."
"Overall - wish I had had this on draft. It's pretty tasty, but not as good as I'd expected."
"Overall: Proper carbonation would make this better and really send it into a different category. As is, the flavor is pretty good, but it just does not have all the pieces."
"Had this in a bottle at the brewery. 2010 vintage. very dark with no head. His was very nutty and caramely. It was worth the wait and the money to sample. Maybe my favorite hair of the dog. This beer would be a great way to relax and unwind on a cold night."
"Bottle, with a big high five to pantanap, thanks dude. Pour is very dark, opaque, brown, no head except for a few bubbles, looks like a very old spirit. Ugly but cute at the same time, I like it Aroma is definately on the spirit/oak side of things, strong notes of molasses and vanilla. Taste is very, very sweet. I was afraid a little by the aroma, I thought we were on our way to a boozy mess, but the taste is so boldly sweet, with no off flavors at all, just a warm, sweet, monster sipper. Lots of calvados flavour, toffee, caramel. Palate is completely flat, good alcohol warmth, so long and silky in the mouth. I guess this is perfect for a cold winter evening, but it worked well for us on a hot july afternoon. While it was excellent, I found it very hard to drink hence the lower overall rating"
"Huge thanks to Beerzebub for the overwhelming generosity that he always shows me. 2010 bottle. The brew pours a near-still cola-brown hue; there is no head or bubbles but the liquid is viscous enough to leave slight legs upon the glass. The look is rustic and menacing. The nose is, on the contrary, the most absolutely inviting thing imaginable; the complexity is literally astounding. There is a plethora of sensory delights to behold within the flavor and aroma of Matt. Notes of charred brown sugar, toffee, raisin-dark fruit, cherries, hardwood smoke, tannic oak, buttery vanilla, booze, leather, and that familiar HotD twang - just to mention the most prominent associations - all make for a very familiar set of elements but they are combined here in an unusual and novel way. The feel is more lively than the look suggests, and is quite silky as well. Overall this is far and away the best HotD brew I've had (and that is saying something because I've had some great ones.) Lives up to any and all hype."
"It is still very much a sipper, but one that is quickly disappearing from my glass. Hair of the Dog has my attention already, but I think this is their best beer I have had so far. Easily my most favorite strong ale to date. Absolutely spectacular."
"Drink- To be able to try both at one time I was very happy. Thick, boozy, tastefully balanced and well done."
"a great beer, so many complexities. i can only hope ill get the chance to drink this again."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours hazy brown, no head. Aroma is tremendously rich, intense ripe apple, hazelnut, maple syrup. Flavor starts with big sweet bourbon, molasses, brown sugar. Finish has pressed appls, essence of acidity. Lightens towards finish, lifts perception of weightiness. The palate is rich, thick, velvety, chewy, and caressing. Medium-bodied brew. Very nice strong ale from HOTD!"
"Pours deep dark, muddy brown with a thin, creamy, yellowish rim of film. Aroma has a hell of a lot of character. Green apples, rubber, dark chocolate, plums, raisins, light tobacco. Low carbonation, fat and oily mouthfeel. Flavour is impressively complex. Rubber, dark chocolate, plums, raisins, oak, apples, roasted malts. A touch of smoke and thyme. Impressive viniousness. Long, lingering, warming aftertaste. Impressive."
"Simply put, Matt is one bad dog. Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good."
"Pours a rich mahogany with a silky tan head. Nose has an exceptional malt profile along with caramel, toffee, dates, figs, plums, cherries, cocoa, oak, bourbon and sherry. Taste is equally complex. Simply superb body. I need to find more of this. Possibly better than Cherry Adam FTW."
"Incredible. I don’t believe I’ve ever had a barrel-aged smoked beer before, but I love it. The smoke is perfect and smooth, like the aroma left in your clothes after a good cigar. Looks like I’m going to have to get some more Matt."
"This beer really does not disappoint. It's one of the best that I've had in a long time and it was worth the wait."
"The smell was full of complex aromas. Super sweet caramel toffee, prunes & figs, leather, alcohol, malty bourbon oak, apple and vanilla. The taste was as rich as the nose. Initially I was in a wash of sweet dark sugary ambrosia which was quickly balanced out by the sharp alcohol, dark fruit and lingering fruity vanilla finish. Mouthfeel was slick, low carb and full bodied. My fears of a 2011 CAftW-letdown were quickly quashed after a couple drinks. This was a real pleasure to drink and, having just finished my glass I'm sure I'm going to try to chase another one of these down in the future. Having had a couple vintages of CAftW and FFtW, this is the best HotD offering I've had the opportunity to drink."
"O - I love HotD, but I was let down with this one."
"4.0 D: Good beer that could have been great. Great balance between the barrel components and the beer itself. While this wasn't totally flat, the lack of proper carbonation made the nose less impressive, the taste too sweet, and prevented the mouthfeel from being a perfect 5.0. I would easily want to drink this again with a hope of better carbonation."
"O- I am proud that a beer that carries my name does not suck, and is in fact... actually pretty awesome. I'm glad I have more bottles to open on a special occasion. Fantastic beer."
"Overall: Hair of the Dog is a personal favorite and this does not disappoint. Given the price tag and relative rarity of this, I'd reach for Adam more frequently (my God I love that beer), but this is a real treat."
"O: I don't know how many of these you could drink or afford to drink. Totally worth seeking though. Quite unique."
"O: Meh"
"Consumed on 03-17-2011"
"This is a full bodied brew with a light, enjoyable level of carbonation. Big abv factor that does not attempt to be hidden. I forsee this brew becoming increasingly enjoyable as time passes. The alcohol at this point is very warming, fusel and seemingly evaporative on the tongue yet it is quite enjoyable. This brew was not at all what I expected but it was very enjoyable nonethelss."
"An amazing beer. A great sipper, and so complex. Like a fine wine/sherry. I am so glad I got to try this again. Highly recommended."
"What to say about this beer? It has reminded me why I love Hair of the Dog so much. Just a very complex and well done beer that I wish I had a lot more of."
"O: An interesting and complex brew with the double barrel treatment. I think its probably best fresh though."
"This is now one of my ATF!"
"O: Incredible, so many great distinct flavors that combine in total harmony with one another. Every little sip goes a very long way, packing gobs of delicious flavors. Great warming feel in my stomach as I savor each sip. I love this beer. I would definitely drink a glass of this before going to sleep every night if I could. This is heaven in a glass, what more can be said? Please keep brewing this Alan, I want more!"
"O: Probably the best HotD beer that I've had to date, Matt is really impressive. Incredible taste and solid in every other aspect, this one is definitely worth seeking out."
"The taste and smell were outstanding, but the appearance and mouthfeel were pretty poor. Overall, a good beer, but not something I would go crazy looking for in the future."
"O: Overall this is a very unique beer. I enjoyed the originality of it, but I'm doubt I will seek it out again."
"Bottle shared by Miketd. Thanks Mike for sharing this one! Pours black with no head. Aromas are complex with oak, vanilla, brown sugar, and some dark fruit. Heavy mouthfeel with little carbonation. Flavor is wood, wine, apple, candi sugar sweetness, licorice, and finishes with some alcohol. A very nice brew and worth the hype. Thanks Mike for sharing!"
"What a beer, truly unlike any I've had before. This is probably my favorite barrel-aged HotD offering to date. It's not without its flaws, but it's a decadent beer fit for commemorating whatever you have worth commemorating. Truth be told, I struggled to finish the bottle - it's a bit cloying, rich and drinks hot enough to warrant splitting."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers of the last year or two. I actually do want another one, but I also don't want to be hungover tomorrow, so I will reluctantly abstain."
"O: Delicious, i like the aroma better than the taste, i really like the evergreen smoke notes"
"This beer was pretty off putting to me initially, but as it came to room temp it really opened up. Tasty beer. I enjoyed the bottle of the new batch more. Not sure if it's the age or batch variation."
"Thanks again, Chris!"
"4.5/5/5/4.5/4.5"
"D-The depth of flavor is there, but it's too boozy. Hurts the drinkability considerably, though this is still something everyone should try. I get the impression this is better fresh."
"O - well, I'm glad to say I have ticked this bad boy, and the Bottleworks version of it at that. I just expected more from it. People talk up a lot of beers, and this just adds to the list of disappointments. Oh well, it was worth trying."
"D - This is good even at 11.5% i would definitely like another glass"
"(courtesy of Daknole!). Pours near black with great aroma of bourbon and some fruit. Taste was sweet with noticeable alcohol. Full bodied and delicious! Thanks Dak! This was a real treat. I'd been wanting to try this for quite a while and Dak comes through."
"D- An intensely interesting beer that leads to a deeply visceral experience. At first I wasn't quite sure the flavors meshed well for me but after sifting through layer after layer and enjoying it as it warms I have to say it's up there with some of the most interesting beers I have had the chance to taste."
"Drinkability:"
"Drinkability: Maybe I'm just growing curmudgeonly in my old beer age. This beer straddles a very interesting divide, showcasing both deep, smoky, dark toastiness as well as bright, green, fruity overtones. As a genre-blending experiment, it succeeds - I've never had a beer quite like this, to be sure. And not to sell it short - it succeeds on several other levels too, least of which is the divine nose and the masterful blending and complexity of the mouth. But I still require lift, head, lace, et al - this one had its procedural defects, and though they're not glaring, they do take their toll; it was a little difficult to finish those essentially flat final few sips. Of course, all that being said, this was still a pretty damn awesome beer - it's not every day you're going to get this many flavors and aromas out of a single 12 oz. bottle. Here's (three years late) to Bottleworks 10th Anniversary and to HotD for a great brew."
"Pours a slightly translucent dark brown. Smells of sweet figs, boozy raisins and a small amount of hops. A bit of smoke and maybe a touch of apple round it out. One of the more complex noses on a beer I have had. The taste is a crazy combination of mild hops (or other bitterness), rum raisins, dark fruit, smoke, apple, booze and vanilla. A lot going on in there. Feels like I could keep sipping it and get more flavors. Really heavy in the mouth with limited carbonation. Definitely a sipper, this is either a good sharing beer or a beer to be enjoyed in front of a fire, slowly, on a cold night."
"D: A bottle of this is plenty, but a real pleasure to drink. Sort of wish I would have traded for more than one."
"Drinkability is very good. Definitely a big beer, but I could sip on this all night. I'm amazed at how well it is already drinking. Not sure how long I'll be able to keep my other bottle in the cellar. A perfect beer for a cold winter's night. HotD has created a masterpiece. If you like stong ales, old ales, barleywines etc., this beer is a must."
"Overall I really enjoy this one. Wish I had a whole bunch of them."
"D - This is a big time sipper. Full of absolutely delicious flavors, and thick full chewiness. Perhaps one of my favorite beers lately. Absolutely world class."
"Mouthfeel is thick and coats the whole mouth. There is next to no carbonation, but it's not really needed. This is incredibly smooth. Definitely a sipper and a challenging beer, almost more of a spirit than a beer. Very nice and I hope to be able to try it again someday."
"Flavor is extremely sweet and fruity with a stronger smoke presence than the aroma which gives the finish a light spiciness. Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated with a thick, velvety lush mouthfeel bordering on syrup like. Vanilla and brandy dominate the sweetness in the front of the palate and the freshness of this bottle is apparent in the finish in it's booziness. Give this another year and it'll be perfect."
"D-Quite strong, very nice and certainly tasty. Alcohol heat does become present and noticeable upon warming."
"Final thoughts: A beer to remember...expertly crafted by Alan Sprints. Better than Cherry Adam, I wish it was as readily available as Adam...I could drink it every day."
"This is really yummy, surprised this lived up to the hype. Track this down!"
"Love it fresh and can't wait to try to aged."
"D: this is certainly a sipper and having split it with 2 others was perfect. would I drink another? yes, but on a different night. planning on aging one for a year or 2."
"EDIT- Shared a 2009 vintage at HOTD compliments of Dr. Will, his Ohio guest and John Michaelsen, $25, 7.27.11. The barrel aging and bottle conditioning gave this world class beer a really sublime feel, the apples were mellowed and the brown sugar had subsided. My observation at the bottom of the glass, 'this is a beer worth waiting in line to buy' says it all. Awesome, upped overall score to 4.5 from 4.0 previous review."
"A great brew. Worthy of the hype and the HotD label. Complex and certainly to be savored."
"Poured this 12oz bottle into large wine glass. It poured a blackish purple with almost no head retention. Only a little bit of non sticky lacing. The smell was overwhelming, in a good way. Lots of apple, dark fruits, pepper, sherry, and alcohol. This is an incredibly complex beer with many different flavors to pick up. Dark fruits (currants, raisins, plum), green apples very strong, tobacco and smoke, vanilla, cherries, and pleasantly black licorice. This medium to heavier body beer had alcoholic heat with a slick and semi dry mouthfeel. This beer is going to get even better with some age on it and I'm looking forward to it. A delicious, complex brew."
"In closing- If you can get this beer grab some and cellar it for the next few years to come. This beer beats the pants off of other big beers I've tried like Dark Lord, Darkness, Firestone 13 etc."
"D: What an insanely wonderful beer! I'm sitting on some more for a later date. If this turns into what the BWX vintage did, its an intoxicating treat to look forward too and watch progress! If you can get only one bottle of HotD beer, Matt is the one! Try it if you can. 5/5"
"Drinkability: Great! It doesn't feel so heavy right now at this stage. The lighter, thinner feel makes it easier to drink but you will probably be able to get more nuances once you let it settle for a while. Both are still wonderful. Matt is wonderful!"
"A near black pour with a thin khaki head. Smelled of booze and smoked grains. Soft, low bodied palate. Smokey and robust with a red meat character. Dark fruits and big cherry and caramel apple notes. Low bitterness but with noticeable alcohol flavors similar to port wine. Finished spicy with a smoked liqueur flavor."
"Update 8/31: I have not stopped thinking about this beer since I drank it. Originally, I submitted a 4.2 A- rating (changed the drinkability to a 5 on this update), but I want to stress that the ONLY reason this didn't get an A+ was the lack of carbonation. The flatness played a factor in every characteristic of the beer....but what I drank unquestionably had the potential to be one of the best beers ever to grace my lips. I now have a couple more bottles that I will crack down the line....and I am holding out hope that one of them has even a smidgen of carbonation so I can experience the true beauty of this beer."
"drinkability - what an amazing beer to try, complex, unimaginable, creative, one of the more memorable beers i've had"
"D - not meant to be consumed in excess, this beer is exactly as drinkable as it ought to be -- sip, appreciate, and lose yourself in this masterfully-crafted brew."
"D: This is a perfect special occasion beer. I slightly prefer Cherry Adam to this one, but Matt is definitely up there."
"This has been aging at 55 degrees since the release and it continues to improve, displaying a beautiful balance of apple brandy, leather, smoke, chocolate, and tobacco. This is aging wonderfully."
"HV"
"Taste is very sharp an pretty boozy, with a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and syrupy, quite tasty and drinkable though!"
"J"
"Overall, this was an incredibly complex beer with so much going on. At the same time, it is a single cohesive brew that is the epitome of barrel aging and blending. This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had and is worth the hype. I will for sure have another the next time I'm in Seattle."
"Oak,  molasses, smokey, apples, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel. An old ale at it's finest."
"Thanks Alex."
"D - I was very tempted to drink Bryna's 4oz before she got home. This is one of the few Hair of the Dog beers where I actually could down a whole bottle on my own. The year has done wonders to take the boozy edge of this, and none of the potentially overbearing flavors get out of control. Highly recommended."
"D- This beer is great. Hair of the Dog knocks another one out of the park! This beer both times I have had it has been divine. It is a smooth sipper and I could drink on it all night like that."
"after reading some of the earlier reviews, I think the year in the bottle has really done good for the ""hotness"" of this one. while their was a good amount of boozy flavors from the bourbon and apple brandy it didn't come off as just alcohol. the spirits seemed well defined, flavorful and were very enjoyable"
"Overall this was really unique and impressive, with so much layered complexity. Here's to 10 more years..."
"The smell alone is sublime, projecting notes of apple cured chewing tobacco, cherries, port wine and plum. The flavor blends notes of licorice, fig, vanilla, molasses, and woodsmoke while a distant glow of alcohol adds an ideal measure of heat. Just the thought of this exotic and seductive, motor oil-black ale has me drifting into a state of beer bliss. I can't imagine how high the gravity must have been to ferment out at 11.5% ABV while still retaining a plush body and considerable sweetness. But this is a rock solid beer that exceeds ordinary comparisons. It's pure magic."
"Having said that, the complexity is there and this would make for a really nice sipper. Very low carbonation, but not flat. Medium bodied with a good substance to it. Both the booze and flavor profile command small sips... oh yeah and the price tag and it's availability. Glad I got to try it, but probably won't seek it out again in the future. I bet it will age nicely though."
"Hair of the Dog comes up with some great ales. Pours very dark with a small but significant off-white head, and there is lace down the glass. The aroma of classier bourbon wafts, and it is rich and strong, as is the mouthfeel. A great drinking ale, with good chocolate. Coconut and vanilla accumulates in the tastebuds. Bourbon and a tad of sugar in the aftertaste, that is somewhat drying."
"The taste is hot with a boozy, burning finish. It has some brandy like warmth to it. Slight cherry like acidity as well as licorice, maple, and some subtle smoke. On the palate, its very lowly carbonated and has a syrupy, liqueur type consistency, and an over the top burn from the alcohol. I didn't feel like finishing my sample, so I shared it with people who appreciated it more."
"Phew - this one is hot and strong, no such thing as balance in Matt."
"4/4.5/5/4.5/5"
"yum."
"I will definitely be seeking this out again."
"D - Matt's got a lot going on, including plenty of malt goodness and a pleasant toasted coconut character that took me by surprise. Good stuff fo' sho'."
"The scent and taste on this are near world class. There's this funky milkiness that adds to the awesomeness of this one. There's a beautiful cola taste... Alright, I need to cut to the chase. There's in an incredibly unique smokey characteristic that is (excuse my ebonics) da bomb. The bourbon notes are phenomenal, truely magnificent. So smooth with that crunchy caramel flavor. Lovely vanilla, and light apple brandy tastes make this beer both one of a kind and amazing. I wish I had more."
"had this at the ACBF in Boston as a share from someone cool after the event let out. Wish I could remember who shared it but thanks. Nice flavor and was to be expected from HOTD . nice smoke malt presence and flavors from Belgian yeast coming through. Malty and sweet and a dangerous 11.5% ALC. Some slight apple flavor coming through with a candi sugar sweetness on a malty base. Good stuff."
"D: Very interesting idea and probably will get better down the road but this is almost a mess. Very tasty flavors that are being covered up by the raw alcohol. Wouldn't have guessed 11.5% from the nose but it actually seems like more in the taste. I actually warmed up to the beer a bit more the more that I drank. The alcohol mellows a touch as it opens up further and you get a bit of raw, meaty, smoked meat flavor in the back, adding some nice depth. Mix that with the wood."
"The beer pours the expected dark brown color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is as intense on tap as it was out of the bottle, with prunes, apple brandy, licorice, chocolate and coffee. As the beer warmed (I really think they were serving this beer too cold at Brouwers) I got additional chocolate, as well as some more apple and vanilla. Flavors replicate the nose, except this beer really smoothed out and became very creamy after it warmed a bit. I actually found it a bit astringent and angular initially, but with time and warming, the beer dramatically improved. As with the bottle version, the mouthfeel is very rich and full, and was just exceptional once it warmed a bit. Drinkability is pretty good, though the alcohol and sweetmess really make this a sipper. Also, after having this both in bottle and on tap, I really think this beer needs time to show it's very best. It's delicious now, but I think in a year or two, will turn into a real gem. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from HOTD."
"Bottle sample shared by alexsdad06. Poured a hazy brown color with an average off-white frothy head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Heavy woody, pine, citrus and dark fruit aroma. Medium to full body with smooth texture and soft carbonation. Heavy bittersweet flavor with a heavy complex bittersweet finish of medium to long duration. Standout complex brew."
"I never wanted this beer to end. Astounding stuff. One of my all time favorites."
"If you have the chance, it's worth the effort of tracking this one down."
"Sweetish, boozy, and strong. A real sipper."
"Smooth, medium body that's not overly heavy. Just an incredibly tasty brew that is a great treat and thanks to Scott for graciously sharing this one at a tasting at my house. Would love to have it again someday."
"One of the better beers I've every tried. What i really like is just the style with the barrel aging and the complexity and depth of the beer. The apple comes throgh with some berry type flavors a lingering smokiness and chewy caramel date nougat on the forever finish. Hints of milk chocolate, red currant, pitted fruits and a bit of toffee. Thick and creamy and oh so delicious."
"alan sprints is the shit."
"Drinkability, is somewhat iffy"
"D: Tough call here: an amazing brew, replete with varied flavors and tantalizing aromas. Will I have this again? Fortunately, yes. Will I place this in my upper echelon of 'must trys'? Certainly. Is it 'drinkable'? Well, that's debatable; definitely a wonderful sipper, but a few ounces go a long way. Find a lover of fine beer and share a bottle..."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. Hope I get a chance to try it again."
"D: Great, really is a beer worthy of the acclaim."

"Bottle from josephselander. Thanks man! Pours nearly black with almost no head. Aroma is of wood, chocolate, caramel, fruit and some booze. Kinda wine like, I don't get bourbon. Flavor is rich chocolate and smokey with vanila. Some tobacco and wood with alcohol burn. Big bodied and smooth. This one was worth the hype."
"Poured into my Westy chalice a thick black color, some carbonation, really no head, but there is some oil slicks left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of bourbon/whiskey notes, some chocolate as well. The taste is malty, sweet, lots of bourbon/whiskey notes, and a nice touch of chocolate, a slight tartness/sour note. Full body, the second I opened the bottle I got a good whiff of the bourbon/whiskey, ABV is there, but not to up front. Very drinkable, this one is definitely a sipper, does go down smoothly. Thanks Brian!"
"Overall a very impressive and unique beer from HOTD. A very tasty barrel aged concoction. Love the barrel profiles and the mouthfeel is just incredible. I really would love to have a few more of these, but one cellared bottle will have to suffice for now. I think this one definitely has great aging potential. If you have the opportunity to get your hands on some of this beer, get a few. Excellent beer."
"Bottle. Pours brown with no head. Aroma of bourbon, oak, and rich malt. Flavor of sweet apple, bourbon, and roasted malt. I don't get chocolate or smoke. Decent, but not great to me. Palate is a little light despite the bourbon. This beer is as I had expected it to be--good but not as great as the hype suggests."
"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with SuzyGreenberg, thanks again for sending me this one Ben, also had this on tap in May poured by Alan himself at the brewery, reviewed from notes, poured into my Dogfish Head snifter, color is a nice dark brown with some dark red around the edges, 1/2 inch creamy light tan head, sticks around for a few minutes, some lacing at first, aroma is amazing and consists of lots of oak, booze including both brandy and bourbon, green apples, roasted caramelized malts, vanilla, cream, bourbon, brown sugar, light cocoa, honey, and an unbelievable toffee scent, begins with a mellow boozy flavor mixed with smokiness and some candied fruits, mildly roasted malts in the middle with some of the apple flavor coming through, great brandy-like finish that is warm but not hot, lots of vanilla and chocolate following closely behind, aftertaste lingers with a great amount of oak, warms up with molasses and complexity with different fruits coming to the surface, love the finish on this beer, warming, slightly sweet, roasty, creamy, and malty mouthfeel, super complex, medium to full bodied, just the right amount of carbonation which was on the softer side, taste lingered for up to ten minutes at times, great aftertaste, drank this whole bottle quite easily but do not know how much more I could really do, alcohol is hidden very well considering what this is and the booze that are present are not super hot but more complimentary, very smooth, nice sipper and I cannot wait to have another next winter, this is one of the best Hair of the Dog beers yet and that is saying a lot, makes Adam even better than it already is, I look forward to seeing how this cellars, highly recommended"
"It's a complex beer, but I'd be lying if I said the dominant characteristic right now isn't an alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, but it ... needs ... carbonation. Drinkability suffers as a result."
"Well, when you take one of my favorite beers (Adam) and start playing around with it, you start to wonder if they should just not mess with a good thing. Well, in this case, the end product is a near-perfect beer that has a complexity that is unrivaled by almost anything else out there. World class."
"D - A sipper for sure, but I do like this one. I don't know if I'll try to score another through trades, because I'm disappointed that it's basically flat."
"Overall a big, big winner here. This was quite simply one of the best of the style I have ever had. Not even a touch hot either, this one will surely live up to the hype for anyone who can track it down."
"12 ounce bottle in a snifter. Pour is dark opaque brown with zero head. The liquid is viscous enough to cling nicely to the sides of my glass though. The noise features quite a bit of smoke. In the background I can pick out some oak, tobacco, and a bit of the apple brandy. The flavor is pretty complex, and I can easily say that I've never tasted anything quite like it. You get plenty of smoke, smooth oaky vanilla, and wonderful apple brandy. The mouthfeel is full and viscus, but for the most part flat. Matt is great, but I really with he was carbonated."
"For a beer that has a fairly middling aroma to it, the flavor has turned out to be quite nice. This is definitely a sipping brew and I am really enjoying the rich, concentrated fruitiness here that is just supported by roast malt notes and a hint of smokiness. After a slow start, this ends up being quite an enjoyable brew."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Big juicy apple flavor with bourbony vanilla and caramel right beside it. Flavors of maple syrup, smoke, caramelized sugar and tobacco appear mid-palate. Fairly hot, but pleasantly so, with a rich, full body. Smoky-sweet finish. Remarkable complexity on display here, and I'm amazed at how harmonious it tastes given the unusual blend of apple eau de vie and bourbon barrels with such a smoky base beer. My new favorite Hair of the Dog beer."
"I would not drink more than one bottle in a sitting, definitely a sipper, but it is an excellent beer that I would love to revisit. I think this beer would get better and better with time and I would love to try it after a few years in a cellar."
"A great beer, but just short of spectacular. Perhaps some age could do it, but unfortunately I will probably never find out."
"D: A very nice sipper. Complexity increases as it warms up. An all-around very good brew."
"Matt is an absolute mindblower, especially if you're into big American strong ales. ***Thanks to my main HOTD hookup msubulldog25 for looking out for me yet again. Cheers, Brian!***"
"Aroma is strongest of apples, both sweet and tart. Some tart apples and hay, as well as some sweet apple pie with spices. Brandy like booziness in the aroma as well. Strong deep chocolate and some yeastiness in the aroma as well. Taste is very strong of apple brandy, absolutely delicious. The apples mix with sweet chocolate up front, though the chocolate keeps more to the background. Some spices come in mid taste, cinnamon? The brandy takes the fore front in the finish with a nice spicy, peppery heat on the tongue and throat, with some wood, and oak notes. Mouthfeel is fairly full, the sweetness would be somewhat cloying if not for the apple and the heat. Low carbonation, spicy, peppery alcohol on the tongue and a drying finish. Extraordinary beer, unique flavors that come together very well. Not sure if this was done partly in brandy barrels, but the apple brandy flavor is strong and very nice. Can't wait to see what some age does to this as it mellows and the flavors have time to blend together."
"D: Despite the abv and intensity of the flavors this is a very drinkable beer for me. I'm glad they put this in 12oz. bottle, though"
"D: Not sure since I'm only having half a bottle, but this is terrific. A dessert beer and one of the better brews I've had."
"Drinkability: Really interesting flavor profile; very creative and certainly an exceptional beer; just wish there was a bit more carbonation"
"Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and powerful, but nearly flat."
"Drinkability: Very good, I drank it a little young, would love to try it with a few years to it. Very enjoyable, but it drinks very slowly. A beer to contemplate."
"Overall , WOW what a brew! It was easy for me to drink despite being young with a high ABV%. Had to pick up two more of these after having tried one. Its worth the price and the effort. With age it will be a masterpiece. Bravo."
"Drinkability is very high, as it's a fantastic beer. In spite of it being a rare, expensive one off, it goes down very easy, and if I lived by Brower's I'd be drinking it until it was gone. Wow."
"This beer is amazing. Totally worth the drive up to Seattle. I wonder how much more amazing this will get with a few more months or even a year or two on it. But it is just amazing now."
