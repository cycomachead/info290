"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, char, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, cookie dough, and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid cocoa and fruit aspects, but I am not getting any of the Belgian yeast they supposedly used in this one."

"Well, my 12-ounce bottle states the brewery as being Thomas Creek of South Carolina, and the label is a little different than the one shown here. But my research doesn't come up with much evidence and it doesn't seem worth distinguishing any differences here. So, it pours a deep, opaque black color with a giant head of tan foam that settles to a solid layer, but minimal lacing. The aroma emits a pleasant fruit malt idea, perhaps hinting of the alleged pomegranate. The flavor is somewhat striking but also difficult to describe. There is very little of the familiar malt characteristics I expect from something labeled a black ale, especially an imperial black ale. There's a boozy fruit idea, again, arguably pomegranate and apple, that seems to fight with the slightly chocolate malt base. It just doesn't blend well. It's medium bodied with a smooth initial feel but the soda-like fizziness takes over and ends with an unfriendly result that includes some chalkiness. The aftertaste is similarly poor with an odd vegetable-like bite and evidence of some alcohol. Disappointing."

"Good but not great."

"Opaque reddish black with a dark tan head. No lacing. A lot of malty chocolatey notes and not a ton of hops. A decent imperial black but I was really hoping to taste more pomegranate.. it becomes just barely noticeable after warming to near room temp. Maybe fresh? Or aged? In any case I would drink it again so, above average."

"They seemed to indicate this was a IBA/ABA/CDA, but whatever. Solid black pour into a Mack House goblet, a finger or so of foamy tan head that never completely dissipated, and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate malts, a tad roasty and leathery, hints of pine needles and dark fruit. Dark malts up front in the taste, complimented by notes of dark chocolate and coffee, a touch of resinous hops, and a well-defined pomegranate finish that left a slightly bitter aftertaste to offset the otherwise unexpected smoothness of the beer. Body was medium, if this was indeed a CDA, it was one of the most mellow I've had as far as hops/bitterness goes. A good drinker overall, though it seems that ""fresh and on tap"" is the way to go with this one."
"Three finger tan head reminiscent of a root beer float on a jet black body. Aroma of brown sugar, candy sugar, roasted malts, chili peppers and chocolate. Flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee beans, candy sugar. Oily thick body and moderate carbonation. Dark fruit notes include plum, raisins and prunes. Not too bad. Good flavors but they seem disorganized. Worth trying as it seems u will either love it or find it not too memorable."

"This was a fine one-off beer, however, recommended for dessert. While it warms well, it is clearly better cold. This bottle aged three years."
"O - I loved it. It's very unique and enjoyalble. I suggest having it on tap in thier tasting room, much better than the bottles."

"Overall, this is an average strong beer. It actually is an OK drink. It isn't bad and it isn't good. I don't see myself drinking this one again, but I'm sort of glad I experienced it."
""
"Overall not bad at all, a black ale with some tart fruitiness, different and enjoyable."
"Eh, it was fun to try. I'll review the other of theirs soon enough. 3.0"
"I'm fine with having tried this but sure glad I got it in a mixed 6 rather than committing to a full 6 pack. I'll credit it with being unlike anything else I've had, and for that give it a slight point boost overall, but the flavors never quite found a harmony. Worth a try but not worth a hunt.Â "
"I guess this is considered ""extreme"" - its really all over the place, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Give credit for being different!"

"12 oz bottle from Tom the beer guy. Shipped to me by Tom on his business trip-a true fiend!! Pours dark black with a very fizzy and fast dissipating head-all gone. Nose is a bit chocolate and malty-and maybe a bit old.Taste is malty, chocolate and very carbonated, especially for such a dark beer. Alcohol is just a bit present. Not bad but overall pretty much an average beer. Leaves me thinking that this style has seen better days."
" It makes me glad I live in FL."

"O: I kinda liked it. The juxtaposition of styles reminded me of a hybrid lambic/english southern mild approach in the beer. It isn't what a lot of people expect which is what knocks them for a loop."
"D/O- Usually I don't mind my beers on the boozy side but this was a bit much, almost harsh. Would have again down the line but will be wiser to split with someone. Held up well. Held on to this one for a special occasion...pre-poker night will do!"
"Overall: Really surprised by this one and glad to have tried it. The combo of fruit and roasted malt really works well."
"The CPJ"
"Looks pretty good. Thick, black, with a nice dark tan head. Good stops there really. Now, there is a great stout-like beer in here: roasted malts, nice chocolate, and coffee in the taste and the aroma...it's pleasant. But...you have to cut through this ridiculous sweet, slightly tart pomegranate taste and aroma. It just doesn't work with the stout qualities. I think maybe it would work better in lower doses, but as it sits, it's too overwhelming and disrupts the vibe here. Oddities aside, the feel is not bad, medium, good carbonation. Overall though, this just wasn't very appealing."
"O - flavorful, unique, interesting but ultimately not very appealing."
"Overall, the beer suffers for being too sweet - and I like sweet beer. It may have been better fresh in 2009 (the bottle says it can be cellared for 1-2 years), but aged as it was the sweetness overwhelms everything else."
"O: not a huge fan of this beer. too much fake like sweetness."
"I would have this again, but would not buy it myself. One is enough for a sitting, and half the bottle would have been better."
"drinkable - nope - i'm not sure i can take more than 4 - 6 ounces."
"Pours bitch black with almost no head. Smells a bit like licorice and coffee flavoring. Very thick and syrupy. Tastes like a watered down kahlua. Not really much going on here. There is no pomegranate at all. Overall a very rich and thick beer that is not that fun to drink. The booze is hidden well but that's not too important. Not really worth seeking out but if it's there try it."
"Pours a purplish brown with a rather fizzy ecru head. Pomegranate juice and cardboard in the aroma with some soy sauce. Sharp acidic fruit juice flavor with pomegranate seeds and prunes. I guess there's some roasted malt imperial stout blah blah blah in there too. Really weird beer. Don't know what to make of it but I certainly can't rate it highly by any standard."
"D - I'll admit that this is an interesting beer and probably the first time I've tasted fermented pomegranate, but it's probably the last time I will taste it in this beer. There is no way I could drink a second one of these and finishing this first one may be a little difficult."
"D: Defiantly would not sit down and drink to many of these, they have a pretty high abv, but also a very sweet flavor. A really cool concept but nothing I will keep stocked in the fridge."
"D: Nice, and a good change of pace beer. I certainly couldn't do a whole night of them though. Thanks again DmanGTR!!"
"Drinkability- Not too shabby. I was excited to try this one and after the nose I had second thoughts. But it really is pretty tasty and one way or another, everything works."
"Easy to drink, but definitely not a soft drink. Initial strong stout flavors, but then followed by Coke nuances. Had it on draft in September on a visit home but did not pick up the cola flavors then. Unique, interesting, and tasty brew."
"Pours dark brown / black with a small tan head. Aroma of coffee, dark malts, and some cacao. Taste is of coffee, dark roasted malts, caramel, slight hint of licorice, dark fruits, light bitter hops. Palate is full bodied, creamy, and oily. Finish is smooth and creamy, can taste the pomegranate. Overall this is a nice and smooth drinking brew very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Dessert drink."
"D: This beer sounded like it could be very interesting, and I suppose it was interesting, it just wasn't exactly my thing. I just don't think the roastiness worked all that well with a fruit like pomegranate."
"Because of the perceived lightness of the body of this beer, I would say this could be a very drinkable stout, but the sweetness overall kind of kills it. This beer has good potential, and maybe with some age it'd be better. Maybe..."
"2009...vintage...? It pours a surprisingly opaque black (the pour from the bottle seemed much more ruby-tinged) topped by nearly a finger of darkish ecru foam. The nose is pretty similar to an infected oatmeal stout, with some black cherries hanging all Damoclesianly over chocolate, graham crackers, and cinnamon. The fruit is more pronounced than in an infected bottle, though. The taste starts off fairly similarly, with a blast of chocolate-covered cherries, pomegranate juice, and roasted malts, but the fruits seem to become burnt as the liquid flows to the back of the tongue, eliciting a slight cringe and grimace. The body is a loose medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, this is definitely a strange brew (no Rick Moranis pun intended), not altogether offensive, but also nothing I'd really ask for again. Not really my bag, I think, though it is nice to see 'granates gettin' some love."
"I'll give them credit for the creativity here, but this tastes like someone took a schwartzbier and mixed in apple and grape juice. I wouldn't bother with this again. They really need to dial back on the fruit juice."
"D: Can't say I really enjoyed this beer but there is something very unique about it that makes it feel worthwhile since I only bought a single bottle."
"While we appreciate the concept of going down the road of ""extreme," Mack In Black seems to miss its mark with throwing balance and drinkability totally out the window."
"Interesting, but not something I'd need to drink again. Never had a pomegranate stout before!"
"A very interesting beer. Poured a dark cherry opaque color with a good chocolate brown head. Smelled like roasted espresso beans and some sour cherries. The pomegranate juice gave it a sourness but blended well with the roasted coffee taste and a hint of raisin. Not bad."
"Surprisingly good beer! Very different. Smell is sour cherry, pomegranate and slight espresso. I grabbed a single at State Spirits in Greenville, SC (great store) just to try something different. I was impressed. Taste is just like the smell, dark chocolate, espresso, a hint of pine (very small hint) followed up by pomegranate. The berry isn't overpowering and it was really a great match with the chocolate. Ill grab one of these everything now and then to change things up from my normal fare of DIPAs. Give it a shot, you will be pleasantly surprised."
"Your mileage may vary, but this one bummed me out."
"O: I'm having some interesting impressions with this beer. It is drinkable, but for my liking, maybe too much of a burnt lingering aftertaste. The pomegranate is spot on and almost gives this beer a nice funk to work with. The dark malt combined with fruit is a good mix. Recommend to decrease the burnt finish so that this beer finishes with clean dark malt and tart finish."
"Tart like an infected stout or porter, yet the pomegranate juice must be at work here. Dark coffee & chocolate notes, licorice, overshadowed by the bitter, tart fruit. Kind of prickly mouthfeel, strange combination. A little slick also. One generous pour was enough for me, probably won't seek this out, but it was unique to try. Thanks Keith!"
"Overall this is an OK beer. The tannins are just too much for me to really recommend it."
"d- I don't see myself ever buying this one again. it's not awful but it really doesn't provide me any reason to revisit. a strange brew that really misses the target for me."
"considered a fruit beer."
"Pours a solid black color with just the faintest of garnet highlights when held to the light. Tightly bubbled khaki head recedes slowly into the abyss. Smells of sweet perfume and chocolate and tart dark fruits, a little smoke and a hint of wet dog. Really a lot going on here. Taste is is kind of what I expected based on the aroma. Starts off with some tart fruits. I imagine pomegranate, raisins, plums, tart cherries dipped in chocolate. This melts into a bit of roasted grains, and leaves a roasted coffee chocolate finish. Medium to thick body, medium level of carbonation, creamy syrupy mouthfeel. This one is definitely different, but I think it works pretty well. The darker roasts seem homogenized perfectly with dark fruits. I wonder what this is like fresh."
"Smooth, somewhat chewy, light effervescence, slightly warming. Medium bodied. All told, a pretty darned good beer. Well worth picking up a several. The ABV is not noticeable at all."
"D: I wasn't moved one way or another. It's a nice experiment, but I feel the flavors clash. I wouldn't have it again."
"D: As I hinted at above, this is a snifter beer, not because of the alcohol, but because of the sweetness."
"Pretty drinkable in that it's very interesting and pretty well put-together, but I don't really want to drink more than one or two in a sitting because of the unique flavors and above average alcohol content. Overall, a very interesting offering from a brewery I've never tried anything from before but reminds me a bit of Dogfish Head Brewery in the creativeness areas. Either way, I think it's appropriate that I'm enjoying this beer in a DFH specialty glass. This beer is a definite must try, not only for ingenuity, but for being a good brew as well."
"Overall - Really good and much better than special golden ale. This is a unique, complex beer with a lot of depth to it's flavor and an interesting profile. Really enjoying this and have to recommend it to anyone that it's available to."
"D: It's not undrinkable--but the mouthfeel is far less than perfect and the smell and taste just seem to have elements that don't entirely mesh well. It's interesting conceptually, and I'd love to see more fruit experimentation in brews like this, but this one just doesn't seem to get there. I'm honestly a bit confused by this beer--I'm actually not sure how I'd even like this one changed--its components are not inherently bad, but the ""problem"" doesn't really jump out at you so much as something just seems off. It wasn't a drainpour, but I don't think I'd buy it again, either."
"12 oz brown bottle poured into ommegang glass..which is sort of a wide flute glass.. The design of the label is.. kind of wack, but oh well - the label notes that this beer can be aged 1-2 years, as well as that it has been fermented with pomegranate juice added. Appearance is Totally black, thin sticky head leaving some good lacing. Nose is unique, dark chocolate, dark fruits but not in the same sense as a Dubbel, its a thinner aroma, I guess it's the pomegranate? But not so sure. The taste is smokey and burnt malts, dark chocolates, and I can't tell if the presence of pomegranate is because I read it on the label or if it's a substitute for saying ""dark fruits"".. Hmm, Well this beer is sweet, a bit syrupy, and has great flavor of burnt malts that, if I didn't read ""black ale"" on the bottle, I would have guessed the beer to be a baltic porter. Drink- very tastey, I got this from my local store which has a very large rack saying ""mix your own 6"" and I always check it out because often times there are some pretty heady big time beers! I had never seen this beer before in sixes.. but I think I'd get this again if it were a reasonable price."
"drinkablity: not great"
"Thanks John!"
"D: This is one of those oddball beers that you'll either love or hate. It's drinkable if you like the sweet parts of it."
"The Pomegranate shows up a bit more as the brew warms, but still is not very present in my mind. Otherwise a fairly decent RIS."
"This is a pretty interesting brew and really not half bad. A nice change of pace for sure. I'd have this again on occasion."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a small amount of carbonation."
"An interesting beer, and not bad, but it seems like the flavors clash more than they collaborate. Worth a try."
"Pours a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy tan head, with some nice small islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee notes, very slight yeast, slight roasty notes. The taste is sweet, malty, with some chocolate/toffee, the bottle sez pomegranate juice which to me gives some very nice sweetness to this brew. Medium body. Drinkable, I really like the taste of this brew, would not call it a ASA, but it is very tasty, glad I have another bottle, thanks Diego."
"Ok to drink and in a blind taste might do pretty well but to put that it is brewed with a certian juice in it really makes me look for some flavors that really never present themselves"
"Mouth is slightly viscous, and really a great carbonation. Drinks fairly easy but I'm lost on the description."
"D: Average drinkability at best and average enjoyment going down. Definitely lacks incentive for repeatability or future purchases. Overall this beer started out with some promise but thins out at the finish hardly leaving you any impression of what could have been."
"If you read the label and you think it's going to be another fruit beer, you would be wrong. It's more of a dark roasted beer with a splash of pomegranate juice at the finish line. If you want to try something out of the ordinary, then pick up a bottle of this beer."
"Interesting."
"The label suggests that this one is suitable for aging 1-2 years. While it's believable, and would be interesting to see how its flavors develop, it seems to me that freshness befits it. Certainly worth a try."
"2008 bottle. Pours black with a small bubbly tan head. Aroma of burnt malt and sweet pomegranate, which just didn't mesh together for me. Very odd smelling and not in a good way. Flavor is still burnt with roasted malt and parmesean cheese and a sweet pomegranate finish. Meh, this is very underwhelming. The flavors are just bad. Why would you add pomegranate juice to an imperial stout? It was difficult to take even more than a few sips of this nasty beverage."
"M + D: Medium bodied, with a slickness towards the finish that serves it reasonably well. As it goes down, the glass begins to feel a little heavier.. more richness and weight on the finish picking up. Whether it's the fruity element or just a balance in brewing, the alcohol rests among the other flavours quite nicely, without any sort of heat / booziness. On a personal note, I would like to try this specific brew without the pomegranate juice. Certainly worth a try, especially for those looking for a little bit of authenticity in a beer."
"An interesting beer, not what I was expecting at all. This does have a fair amount of complexity to it at this point; at times this is a plus, but at others this beer just doesn't seem to be able to hold everything together in a balanced fashion. Still this is interesting enough that I am quite happy to be sipping on this right now."
"D: An interesting experiment... certainly worth a try, the pomegranate might be more up your alley than mine"
"d: Thanks to tpd975 for this via the nobody wants to see a beer geek naked BIF. Very good overall, I'm glad I got to try this one. I'd be curious to see what this tasted like without the fruit juice."
"This is a unique, creative brew. Dark and roasty with some sweetness, but with some bitter-ish balance. The pomegranate is just a hint - not overbearing, and not ""artificial"" - Just enough to put a unique ""spin"" on it. Alcohol is still noticeable. It claims that this ages well for 1 to 2 years. It would be interesting to see how it develops. Still, at this point it is an enjoyable ""dessert"" brew, yet in a rather reshreshing way. I did enjoy this more than the other Holy Mackerel, but then, they are completely different beers. This is one to grab when in the mood for something dark and slightly bitterish fruity."
"Drinkability: If the Imperial Black flavors were just a bit stronger and the pomegranate just a bit less intrusive, this could be a dynamite brew; as it is, it was much better than I was expecting, having been completely disappointed with their Golden Ale"
"Mouthfeel reflects its medium body, carbonation is right on and provides a drinkability that is only hindered by its higher ABV."
"Overall I am really impressed here. I did not think it was going to be nearly as good as it was and it has peaked my interest enough to get me to go after a couple more of their offerings. This is a winner in my book."
"This one really appealed to me, I don't really care what others had to say as you like what you like. I was very fond of the flavor profile of this beer. Probably the best thing I've had from Florida."
"D - I'm OK with the 12oz bottle, but I wouldn't go looking for more if I were in Florida. A touch bloaty, with lots of roasty aftertaste. An interesting experiment, but not anywhere near as successful as Surly Two."
"This is an interesting beer. Different, and it threw me for a loop on all counts. I don't know what I was expecting, but this was and wasn't it at the same time. Try it if you must, you may be surprised."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel and a enjoyable beer. But the pomegranate makes it more interesting but at the cost of this being a really good beer."
"d:I could barrel through another one of these now, and I probably will, but I have an oak-barreled Unearthly to work on first."
"I don't know that I would want more than one of these in a night, but I'll certainly be returning to this when the weather cools, these many months from now. Fans of strong ales and RIS should give this a try -- it sort of walks the line between the two."
"D: very easy to down several of these if necessary. this is the best florida brewed beer i've encountered"
"d: again, interesting but too much going on and too thin"
" Second edit: yeah, it's quite tough drinking a whole bottle. The juice is too strong. It's a shame because the taste the beer behind the juice is phenomenal."
"Pours a very nice black in color with only a frothy ring of head forming on the pour. Pours viscous and looks nice. Smell is plenty of black roasted malts and a bit of dark fruit. This has a very nice, full and creamy mouthfeel. Very pillowy soft, best thing about this beer. Not sure that I care for the pomegranate juice that much. I know they say there's not that much in it, but I could taste it and it wasn't placed well."
"Ok, I'm back, thanks for waiting. I enjoy this beer the sweetness of the pomm melds well with the bitterness of the burnt malt. The fruit is not so overpowering, which helps, and that bitterness of the burnt malt make this rather pleasant. It's reminiscent of a schwarzbier with a bigger mouthfeel, but that pomegranate added makes it different and interesting. Overall it was rather enjoyable, maybe after another year or so aging I could see this being really good when everything mellows out more, but I like this beer now too. Nice big carbonation helps make this big beer (no way you would think this was 8%) even smoother. Something very different and interesting, that blends well to make a pretty nice brew."
"EDIT: I had to come back to this review and lower my taste rating. This beer has a poor aftertaste, it dries out in the mouth and leaves an overripined fruit taste almost, not good at all."
"Pours a deep opaque brown, like dark chocolate, with a nice tan head. Smoky aroma is strongly of fine roast coffee and has a hint of pomegranate. Mouth-filling flavor has tones of coffee and unsweetened chocolate as well as a pomegranate hint. Mouthfeel is lively and tingly, and finish is pleasingly smooth."
"D: I actually enjoyed this beer. Something a little bit different that worked for me. I need this to sooth the pain of the Giants loss today. To be honest I probably need a barleywine festival but I just don't have that available for two weeks."
"Drinkability: Smooth and fruity (without being too fruity) thanks to the addition of health-inducing pomegranate juice."
"The drink is fullish-medium in body with plenty of carbonation. Though my description of the brew makes Mack in Black sound pisswater awful, it really is surprisingly drinkable... that is, once the nose and palate numb to the off-flavored assault and the 8% ABV starts warming the belly."
"This is an awesome beer. Found it this weekend and have been loving it. It pours pitch black with a tan head that quickly dissapates. Smells like coffee, and getting faint hints of something fruity, maybe from the belgian yeast strain used? Taste absolutely great. Lovely coffee and roasted barley flavors, and then a slightly cherry taste as an after thought. It's a little carbonated but, i'll overlook it. Truly an underrated beer."
"Pours dark, dark brown with ruby hints around the edges and with a small tan head that recedes quickly to a ring leaving no lacing. The smell is fairly sweet and with chocolate up front and hints of dark fruits and toasted grains. The taste follows the aroma with sweet chocolate and grains up front before the sweetness of the dark fruits takes over in the middle. The mouthfeel is very, very smooth and slick. This is a decent beer and fairly hard to categorize. Much better than the Special Golden for me."
"Drinks pretty easy, the complexity & dryness slow me down, maybe would better in cooler weather? Given it origins, I would think you'd need the AC down low in Fla to fully enjoy this, nice effort!"
"EDIT: the beer does improve as it warms, with the dominate fruit giving way to some chocolate notes & maybe even a touch of cherry. Much more palatable as it approaches room temp."
"O: Awesome idea, but might want to work a little harder on making this one better the next time around."
"props to the brewery for wandering off the map with this one. worth a try for the experience."
"D - I really liked it, but the flavors are very strong. I couldn't see drinking more than one of these in an evening. However, that's probably a good thing because very easy drinking high gravity beers get me into trouble."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium lobe. This beer pours a dark brown with just a few wisps of a head that instantly disappeared, leaving no traces that it was even there. The aroma is of milk chocolate, roasted malts, and overly sweet pomegranate juice. The flavor is like sweet milk chocolate that has a pomegranate filling but the more it warms a slight chalky under flavor comes through. The mouthfeel is way to light for this beer. I wish it had a bit more heft to it. This is a good start to a beer. I wish that they would look at reworking it. It could be fantastic."
"D- Just way too sweet for me. Very different for sure. I struggled with this one and honestly couldn't finish this one."
"Overall not a beer I enjoyed at all, in fact I couldn't finish it. That sweetness was just left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth."
"Flavors are really sweet with some chocolate in there as well. There's not a complex Belgian quality to this, but its really one dimensional. Is it drinkable? Yes. But something about this reminds me of a mass produced fruit beer aimed to not taste like ""beer."" Too Sweet."
"A blackish body with a one-finger semi-tan head that sticks around a little. Great roasted malt smell, hints of coffee and chocolate. Smooth and creamy, full-bodied with minor fruit notes. Good sweet touch here. Has somewhat of a dry backbite, but more or less passes down smoothly. Malty taste, roasted, coffee, chocolate and a little syrup. Good beer that I'll have to have again when I'm back in FLA."
"My only complaint is that the pomegranate is a little heavy handed. The bottle says it can be aged for up to two years. I wonder if some age will mellow out the fruit. Three more bottles left. I plan to find out."
"I don't know if I'd drink many of these in a night. One is OK."
"Oakes bottle, brought from Florida. I liked its roastiness and smokiness, not the addition of pommegrant juice. Its black with a white head. It has a sour finish.OK for a stout, not up there and even thinish for an imperial stout. Lose the pom and its an OK stout."
"Pours almost a pitch black with a thin mocha head that falls quickly to a film. Smell is full of roasted almond, pecan smoke, hints of apricot, plum, some peachy floral hints all finished by an alcohol bite. Taste begins with a roasted, malt forward note of burnt toast and roasted nuts. Then comes a plesantly unexpected fruity note full of raspberry, faint notes of pom juice, and some floral tangerine. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated. This is certainly a strange brew, one hard to really catagorize. I can't see drinking much more than a pint."
"I like both beers from Holy Mackerel, but this one is better than the golden ale."
"D-This is an interesting beer with good dark malt flavors. The pomegranate tartness is a bit out of place and makes it taste like cough syrup when the beer warms a bit. Good concept for a brew."
"Overall- Very nice cocoa/ coffee/ fruit blend. Very good, a bit sweet though.(Thanks Greg!)"
"Edit: The taste does start to smooth out as it warms. I'm bumping the taste up to a 4."
"Bottle courtesy of Secret Santa: Poured a pitch black color ale with a bubbly dark head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma is somewhat vinous with distinctive pomegranate juice which provides a weird offset to the roasted malt. Taste is also a weird mix between some roasted malt with some notes of pomegranate and no discernable hops. Full body with medium to low carbonation and no distinctive alcohol. A very interesting and unique experiment which I am glad I tried but not necessarily something I would seek out on a regular basis."
"Enjoy a good bar of chocolate? Check this out."
"Body is quite big, creamy, and lush with good drinkability in spite of the high ABV. Would be excellent with a warm brownie and vanilla bean icecream and razberry drizzle."
"It has all of the flavors of an Imp Stout, but is dangerously more drinkable. The ABV hides in the flavor, so watch out for surprises."
"The brew kind of grows on you. I could drink a few of these maybe space apart a little. Overall an interesting brew and it has Pomegranate so it must be good for you"
"Guess what I have to say is... cool it with the dark malts. Maybe replace your roasted or black patent or whatever it is you're using with cara malts."
"this one is a bit bitter and raw, i think a few years of ageing may help, i dont realy taste the difrence that the pomegranate juice makes, i asume that that flavor comes out later in its ageing. this one is nice though it is robust and the dark roast works well. the hops kick in nicley, i may try to get anouther bottle to cellar."
"bottle from Team Beverage Raleigh"
"D - While the 8% alcohol is not readily apparent, this is a very rich, full-bodied beer with a lot going on. I can't imagine someone wanting more than one at a time. Would pair well, I think, with a fruity dessert, perhaps a raspberry or blueberry tart. Or, forget the dessert and have this, this is dessert enough."
"D: This is a sipper beer"
"2008 listed on the bottle. This is an ""Imperial Black Ale"" brewed with pomegranate juice and a Belgian yeast strain. 12oz bottle. Pours a dark black color with a light tan head. The aroma is dark roasted malts with a fruitiness (from the pomegranate juice). The taste is dark and roasty, with a sour finish with a strong boozy finish. They sweet and sour nature of the taste combined with the strong boozy finish make this beer undrinkable for me resulting in a drain pour. I can count on one hand how many times I have poured out a beer before finishing it, and this is one of them. Don't know if I got a bad bottle or what, but I could not stomach the taste. Overall, I was not really impressed by Mack in Black and would not purchase again."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer and I would drink it again if I could get it in my area. Thanks go to sincereNC for the bottle!"
"This is an interesting stout which is fine. It's not as smooth and is too sour compared to stouts that I like. Worth a try for those who like stouts."
"D - I could have a couple of these but probably at the end of the night.."
"D: maybe two of these, but one is about all I could put down. The sweet and sour turned me off a little bit."
"D: I really enjoyed it and would say it's down right drinkable even on this hot Florida summer day."
"D : It's one I could try again but it was just a weird combination of flavors to me."
"Holy Mackeral Mack in Black pours an opaque black with a brown head from a twelve ounce brown bottle. Roasted malt is noticeable in the aroma as is a fruity thing that must be the pomegraniate. This beer is really a stout (the label calls it an imperial stout), roasty flavors abound and there is a subtle fruity flavor in the background that must be the pomegranate. The mouthfeel is a bit thiner than I would like. Better than I expected, definitely worth a try. Contract brewed for Gordash by the Florida Beer Company"
"Had this one at the Raleigh Would Beer Festival and had been looking forward to trying a whole pint. Poured a nice opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was a nice blend of pomegranate and subtle choocolate. The taste a very complex blend of dried fruits, dark chocolate and slight Belgian spice. The beer is medium bodied with hidden alcocol. This is an enjoyable beer on a 100Â° day that will only get more enjoyable in cold weather"
"Tastes like a stout, but a bit more drinkable than many. I really enjoyed drinking this one and will have more in the future."
"Listed as an Imperial Black Ale. The brewer said this was brewed with a Belgian yeast strand and pomegranates. It is a stout with definite Belgian characteristics. Tasty beer. Congrats on releasing this Bob, if you read this that is."
