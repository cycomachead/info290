"No date on bottle, almost no carbonation and very murky. No hop bitterness and very very sweet, lots of malt for sure but pretty one noted. Mouthfeel was very cloying and sweet. I suspect it was a very old bottle."

"I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or not but my beer had a metallic aftertaste that was unpleasant. It was also too sweet and syrupy for me. Not awful but I won't drink it again."
"Somehow I managed to completely freeze a bottle of this for a night, so there's no telling if the thawed version will still deliver the typical knockout experience. Poured in to a New Belgium tulip, the exceptionally murky ruby red grapefruit colored beer produced little head, no lacing, and left only some shiny hop oils on the surface. Under the light, the drink slightly resembles a stiff bloody mary, minus the celery stalk. There's lots of aromatic biscuit malts in the nose, with some lemon citrus hop. Sweet flavors come to the fore, with a nice biscuit backbone. The counterpunch is a minty, orange zest hop bite that keeps it in balance. The bitterness linger a bit, melding with a caramel sugar sweetness. The finish is pretty juicy. The alcohol is certainly there, but it remains understated for such a strong ale. The mouthfeel is pretty robust, with a gentle, yet spry carbonation. Well, I'm glad to see that my freezer faux pas did not damage the beer. It delivered exactly what I have come to know from this brew.  A very tasty, well-balanced American ale that will knock you on your ass."

"O - This is a big, malty brew. The alcohol is well hidden, but it is not in my wheelhouse."

"O - This is just flat out bad. Its not a good strong ale, nor a good double IPA"

"mouthfeel is neutral for an ale, a  bit biting from some thinner carbonatoin but not unpleasant"

"A goblet, eh? That sounds like a challenge! I have not broken out a goblet in a while, but I am happy to take up the goblet gauntlet. Holy Heavy Foam, Batman! My goblet may have proven stronger than their Strong Ale, but I backed off and allowed it to settle some before proceeding. I have to admit, though, that the density of the head was phenomenal, creating a mound of dense, rocky, light-tan head with excellent retention. Nose was rich with caramel and toffee notes as well as a decent alcohol burn that tickled my nostrils. Color was a cloudy orangish-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13). Mouthfeel seemed to be on the thin side and man, it brought the heat right from the outset! This would have been illegal to make and sell in South Carolina up until recently and they seem to be making up for lost time. I hold with my initial assessment about it being rich and malty sweet, but I was not getting much in terms of hops. My goblet was ringed with dense lacing as I drank. Phew! Finish kept up the heat, then slowly reduced to near candy-like sweetness. One of these will be plenty, thanks."

"This beer was sampled both fresh and after 2 ½ -years-age. Neither version was particularly notable, however, age did clean up some muddled flavors and added to complexity and the aroma. Alcohol did tone down as well. Both versions scored similarly."

"Overall: This is a solid beer from a brewery I'd never heard of but I'd drink again. My rating may even be low because I""m not sure I had the freshest bottle. As much as I think the catch-all category of ""American Strong Ale"" is a bit stupid, I guess I'd compare this to a poor man's Arrogant Bastard. But I love Arrogant Bastard, so this is worth a try."
""
"Thanks to Illucium for the sample!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a perfect strong ale, with great balance.. Nothing for amateurs or beginners here."
""
""
""
""
"If you like the dark side, definitely give this one a try. You'll be dragged in by the smooth yet bitter taste of this one."

"Nice weight, not too heavy, not too light."

"If I can find another single to put in a make your own six pack then I am all over it. And it's really good for it's 8.5% abv."
""
""
""
"Overall: I know this sounds contradictory but the beer was a more satisfying experience as a whole than it would seem from the individual scores. Gonna have to revisit this to make sure I give it a fair shot."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours orange copper with a creamy white head, lots of tiny bubbles, and some floaters. The head sticks around for a while. The beer smells nice and malty with some sweetness. The beer tastes bready with some hint of bread crust and some toffee and earthiness. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is a little dry, but it drinks pretty well for the higher gravity. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"A decent beer; the alcohol is nicely matched with the flavor profile, so would be worth having on tap."
"i have had this on tap before- but this is the first i have had ""bell ringer"" in a bottle. it pours cloudy and brown with a nice almost red tint. the smell is almost non existent. its not unpleasant, just not very potent. the taste starts off pretty hoppy and finishes with a strong alcohol finish. i like this beer. it lives up to its name."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Lives up to its name. This thing will knock you around a little bit, but a good offering from a solid SC brewer."

"O – This turned out to be a nice strong ale. I was a little skeptical after the aroma, but the taste, mouthfeel, and look were great. The taste is maybe not as complex or layered as better strong ales, but the beer is still very tasty. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the spice and alcohol heat combination makes for a great finish. This is definitely better than I expected it to be coming from Spartanburg (sorry, Sparkle City). Tasty and drinkable beer."
""
"O - When I was given this bottle I was told it was a style of it's own...and I would have to agree with that...I see the notes say an Imperial ESB, but the bright citrus flavors go against that...other than the light nose I enjoyed this one"
"Pours a hazy light amber color with a thin white quickly disappearing head. Aroma of malt and citrus with a little pine. Taste is very complex of malty sweetness, citrus, piney hop bitterness, well balanced. Ends with a slight alcohol note and a lingering bite of hops. Medium carbonation and a full body slightly creamy mouthfeel. This beer is very interesting and keeps me coming back for more and more sips. Easy drinking, and a very well done Strong ""Imperial"" Bitter. I will probably be having this beer again, and would recommend for those that love bitters or pale ales especially."
""
"Pours a murky honey brown with a 1 inch foamy orange-khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, brown sugar, and malt. Taste is of candied citrus zest, brown sugar, and toasted malt. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty tasty offering. I would gladly enjoy this one again."
""
""
"Overall: This would be more of an American Strong Pale Ale if this style was even recognized. A far cry from the Belgian Strong Dark Ales and Stone or other top American Strong Ales."
""
"A malty strong ale...caramel breads...brown sugar....real bready on the aroma....not much for a hop bite which is fine with me I like how this drinks....not immense in stature....maybe high side of medium bodied....finishes with just a little hop twang but this is a malt-forward ale all the way with big bready caramel/brown sugar notes.."
""
""
""
"This is a rather complex and flavorful beer, but unfortunately there are a few off flavors in my opinion. The cherry in both the nose and taste are a bit medicinal which over power the bready malts and nice dark alefruits. There's a nice underlying hop character which lends a little balance. Overall, not a bad beer, but a bit of a more balanced flavor would really make this an awesome ale. As it stands it's worth a try, but I'll probably avoid it in the future."
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a burnt orange color body with no head, just a real thin lace around the edge of the glass. The smell is of sweet malt and a little bit of fruit. The taste is maltey and tart fruit. I don't get a lot of hop taste just a tiny bit on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is ok, kinda leaves a after taste in my mouth. Overall this ia a ok beer in my book, i'm not a big malt loving guy."
"O: This beer is not too difficult to drink considering the strength; the alcohol is noticeable but doesn’t detract from the taste. It’s a real guzzler coming out of the bottle so you need to pour it carefully so you don’t get a glassful of head."
""
""
""
""
"The subtle flavors and aromas actually end up working in the beer's favor. This isn't an intense and aggressive beer, but it's well crafted and dangerously drinkable."
"O - Malt and caramel with great hop balance. This beer blurs the lines of what it actually is. But, it's interesting to drink and one that keeps you entertained."
""
""
""
"Murky orange body. Thin ivory white head. Light bits of lacing. Bit of a spiked fruit punch aroma a la arogant bastard. A little pineapple. Some cherry. Light alcohol on the nose. Flavor is solid, but nothing really stands out. Some definite alcohol linering afterwards. Biscuity malt. Tropical hop flavors. Decent."
"Overall impression - I'm not sure what the style is on this one. Not quite barleywine, not quite dead DIPA. Strong ale, perhaps? In any case, I think it lives up to it's namesake quite well. Worth a shot, at least if you come across a single bottle."
""
""
"C"
"o: Bland and uninspired."
""
""
""
""
""
"Still no word on the style, or what actual ingredients or processes are involved. Ah, well, we can only let our tastebuds be our guide. And this is delicious stuff."
""
""
"Overall: Very pleasantly surprised. Lots of hop flavor mixed with some spices reminiscent of a Belgian ale. Grab one of these!"
""
""
"Overall Impression- Not sure what the style is but very strong maltiness and caramel all the way through. It says ""Strong Ale"" on here but I would say it is either an ESB or an American Brown Ale with double the strength. Definitely a favorite brown ale for me and would go back to if available! Would like to try more from this brewery also."
"Smell is not very tropical but a tiny bit piny. There is a tiny bit of sweetness from the malt bill to be sure. Really more of a little pine/malt but not much tropical. Really an OK beer but nothing special."
""
""
""
"O: A tasty beer in the style of an American brown ale."
"Rather ordinary beer, though yes lots of hops, and malt, not so well integrated. OK drinkability to get the hops, a better malting would improve drinkability. little coconut.Doug’s bottle. Ordinary for the style. Decent sized retained head on hazey golden body.Some lace."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not bad but not too memorable either. I don't think I would try this one again."
""
""
""
""

"A fairly unique strong ale and one that I would like to revisit again sometime."
""

""
""
"Overall, this beer is pretty good. Nothing incredibly special. If there was a style called ""Imperial Amber", this would be it."
"D: Drinks surprisingly well given the age."
"O - I would try this again. A strng ale that is actually one you could have a few of."
"It would be a disgrace to simply chug down such an outstanding brew. Savor this beer slowly and enjoy!!"
"O - Not sure, taste is pretty good, reminds me of Hairy Eyeball but just no body. Maybe my bottle was old or is this by design?"
"O: A bold and flavorful beer that is reminiscent of Bell's Hopslam, albeit much sweeter and less finely crafted. In fact, my main reservation about this beer is that it seemed a bit roughly put together, like a very good homebrew. Some of that impression comes from the high levels of both sweetness and bitterness, with the bitter losing out until the aftertaste. It also lacks the complexity of a world class brew. Still, as a local brew it is about about half the price of Hopslam. Worth a try, for sure."
"O: A tasty beer. I found it in a ""make your own sixer"" area and picked it up. First time I've ever seen it, but definitely worth a look. I don't know that I would be quick to drink more than one or two of these, because even with the hops the sweetness builds at the back of the throat."
"Pours a deep rusty amber color, with a thick, foamy, sticky eggshell white head. It smells like a pine forest, needles, branches, and all, with a little boozy character throughout. In the flavor, all of that pine is contrasted by big burnt caramel character. The texture is fine but average. In one sense, this beer provides the bold yet reasonably balanced flavor profile of a decent barleywine with a slightly lower alcohol content. On the other hand, this beer tastes like a barleywine despite its (comparatively) lower ABV, and it is never a good thing for a beer to taste boozier than it is. In the end, though, the beer was enjoyed, which is good."
"O - A pretty good beer. Glad to see the SC beer scene is still heading in the right direction."
"Poured from a bottle into a non-iced pint glass. Pours a pleasant-looking bright light amber with a pretty good sized foam head. Probably a majority of the beer is made with 2-row grain without a large hop bill. Not a IPA. Some dark notes. Tastes slightly malty. Carbonated okay with a mouthfeel."
"EDIT- After reading more about the beer, I realize it's 8.5% ABV and the bottles claims it's nicely hopped, I don't find any outstanding hops to speak of in the flavor."
"Very cloudy copper coloured body with an orange glow and a thin-ish tan head. Aroma of strong malt, alcohol, caramel, pit fruits. Malty flavour with not much behind the initial taste showing some alcohol, a bit of pit fruits and not much else really. Aftertaste shows a little bit of hops (I'm pushing the envelope here to find something positive) and a tiny bit of pit fruits and almost nothing else. Overall, a pretty uninteresting beer - I was expecting much more from the taste, but this one is very weak in the flavour - the look and smell are okay, but there is nothing at all to this beer. I think I've grown tired of giving RJ Rockers my money to be uninspired by their work. It's almost as if they throw 3 ingredients in and a little hops, and call it a day on all their stuff."
"O: Not a bad beer, but a little understated overall. Wouldn't mind having another. Worth a try."
"I am glad I tried this one and would drink it again if offered, but not sure I would chase after the beer in a trade, etc."
"From notes: 12 oz Bottle. On sale -- should have known to avoid right there. Pours a cloudy orangish color with a finger nail thick white head. Aroma is sweet malts, caramel, no hops, fruit and brown sugar. Taste is malt, malt, bread, malt again, caramel, and a little more malt. No hops to speak of. The malt kind of beats the beejeezus out of the hops. I have tried a number of RJ Rockers brews now and they are pretty much all super average, boring beers."
"I like to take a brewery completely in as far as profile, and RJ Rockers doesn't stack up for me. This latest offering pours with very thick orange color. Lots of floaties in this beer. White head that doesn't remain around. Aroma is sugary sweet with no hops to think of, brown sugar and sweet bread. Flavor is bitter, sharp alcohol. Sweet sugar and bread. Finish is boozy. Slightly sweet but mainly distasteful. Steer clear."
"Beer is strong, hot, and boozy, some sweetness and caramel. The beer is sweet throughout with a moderate bitterness at the back of the mouth. Strong throughout. Not great but not bad either."
"Pours a medium copper color with a small white head. Sparse lacing on the way down. The nose brings some caramel malt and quite a bit of booze. Lightly-sweet bread in the background. The flavor has a bit of booze with some fairly-strong caramel notes. Sugary malt throughout. Medium body with a bitter and slightly-dry finish. Odd beer. Never came together."
"Overall this might be a bellringer with some booziness but not too impresses with flavor. Wish it was more balanced with some hops."
"Okay, I'm a little confused by this beer. It says American Strong Ale and then it says its an Imperial ESB. Clearly, this beer has an identity crisis going on. For me it was super malty. There were no hops to really speak of. While you could get that it was pretty high in the alcohol value - that's all there is to this beer. Malt and alcohol. The appearance had the look of a ESB, I guess. There was no real smell other than dominating malt. The taste was a bit boring. Just a malty carmel. Again, a bit boring. Not all that impressed so far with RJ Rockers."
"O- Not too bad at all. Surprised by the Imperial ESB would of never guessed that."
"A nice reddish copper color when poured into a standard pint glass. From first to last sip there is a good balance of hops & malt with dominant flavors of grapefruit and soda crackers. Ample lacking sticks to the glass. It finishes with a nice full mouthfeel."
"Ahh the American Strong Ale category! This seems to be a twist on the American Barleywine. Great looking brew. Strong smells and the flavor satisfies the palate after you quickly figure out what direction it's going. The empty glass reveals a very funky yeast smell that reminds me of catfish bait. This does not show up as your drinking though. Kinda weird."
"Found this to be quite good. The pour is a really nice looking copper color. The head is a decent yellowish white about a half inch tall. The lacing left behind is good too. The taste is soft and hoppy. The aroma is a little sweet with some hops and malt in the mix. The mouthfeel is smooth too, good carbonation and medium bodied. The abv coming in at 8.5 is pretty well hidden in this brew. Enjoyable beer!"
"MO- This beer didn't do it for me. It's definitely drinkable and I wouldn't turn one down though."
"12 oz bottle. poured from bottle, pours amber with white head, mild lacing, smell is not anything particularly special, smells like an average pale ale- mild hops, mild alcohol as it warms, taste is good, sweet malt, bitter hop finish, also some alcohol taste. not bad for 8.5%"
"This seems like a mongrel of no particular style, which would be ok if it had more pleasing flavors. But it is warming and would make a decent sipping ale if only there was some gingerbread to go with it."
"Flavors and aromas are of sweet malt, bitter white grapefruit, piney hops, caramel toffee, biscuits. Imperial ESB crossed my mind here. A bitter quaff to say the least. Medium in both body and carbonation with well hidden alcohol and a crisp, bitter finish. Certainly worth a try if you see it."
"D: Refreshing easy to drink, surprised to see this listed as 8.5%. Nice session beer I enjoyed while watching basketball with salty snacks."
"Drinkability: a nice beer that is a bit of a slow sipper, but a few of these could be consumed in a session."
"Worhty effort and I'd definitely try it again."
"A BOTMC brew that arrived at my doorstep. Bottle labvel says that this ale is worthy of your sturdiest goblet or most treasured stein. Well I finally scored one of Sam's holy grails so let's give it a whirl in that. Popping the top I get a huge malt smell and lots of sweet floral hops. Pours to a cloudy orange brown with a big off white head that leaves a nice lacing as it recedes. On the taste this brew hits up front with a big malt backbone then transitions into a sweet and bitter middle followed by a tart and sweet finish. The hops are very floral yet the bitterness is evident. Mouthfeel is silky smooth without a doubt due to the high AC. This is a very complex brew that indeed you need to watch or it may ring your bell!"
"RJ Rockers Brewing Company--Bell Ringer Ale--HANDCRAFTED--Every Beer Every Drop Every Time--2011 12 oz. Bottle. 8.50% ABV. 53 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Winter Ale. No sediment. Dense tight mild lace off white medium head. Clear rich bright pretty amber color. Mild hop sweet malt front. Creamy sweet malty caramel toffee candy smooth Winter malt spice hint rich body. Herbal hop and English malt notes. Clean rich mild hop	spice end develops dry hot clean EtOH notes. Big rich body finishes a touch unbalanced and rough. Nice taste. Nice aroma. Sampled 2/1/2011. Malt of the Earth Beer of the Month Selection received 1/19/2011."
"To me, this is WAY over-carbonated. Far beyond spritzy, this is fizzy, almost like a soda. Medium in consistency, despite the high carbonation. The balance is striking, especially in a style dominated by over-hopped or intensely malted experimental and limited beers. Even so, I find that I am having a tough time really getting into this beer. Would I drink it again? Yes. Would I buy it if I saw it on the shelf? Not sure."
"D: Quite drinkable with a complex taste. Certainly worth checking out."
"Thanks, loved the present. Dad"
"D - This is a fine beer. It's reminiscent of a light American barleywine and a strong ESB. The fruit yeast esters give it a very English-like feel when combined with the biscuity malt and restrained hops. However, the hops are not so restrained as in an English beer which leans American. I don't know if I'd go too far out of my way for it, but it is very enjoyable and would go for it again if presented the opportunity. If I lived within the distribution area I might develop a fondness for it."
"Very happy with this beer"
"D - Very very drinkable for an 8.5%. I can only taste the booze if I really try to, and I'd believe you if you told me it was a 6%. Easy to down and very tasty. A quality brew."
"I was very surprised at how drinkable this beer was for the ABV, in my experience higher ABV beers tend to be a stout or something just as heavy and thick. Very easy on the palette, will certainly buy this beer again, and as it states on the 6 pk, be careful, you might get your bell rung."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured from a 12 ounce glass into a SA perfect pint glass, hazy, opaque orange with a rock solid white head. The beer leaves beutiful lacing. The aroma is light, some sweetness, some citrus? The flavors are light and clean, sweet matlt, pineapple, it has a clean finish, just a hint of bitterness. The body is medium, well carbonated. This beer is an easy drinking, smooth beer at 8.5%, imperial ESB, very interesting."
"Maybe I got an old bottle...willing to try again"
"M- Medium body with relatively high carbonation."
"D- For a strong ale, it's very drinkable. Not until it had warmed a bit did I notice any alcohol. A quality beer. Unique idea with Imperial ESB."
"I'm glad Case sent me another one of these as this brew went from a solid D to one of the better Strongs I've had... Intense and hoppy and scary drinkability... I'm hoping I can find some more fresh bottles in the future as I would make this a staple..."
"D: This beer is very drinkable. My party went through 3 pitchers before we kicked the keg (the beer remained clear even on the last pitcher). The alcohol is deceptive and can creep up on you if you aren't aware of it."
"Overall not a bad beer. I'll age some of these and drink the rest. However, sweetness and alcohol turn me off on this beer. I don't see me picking it up again."
"A toast to our veterans! Happy Remembrance/Veterans Day!"
"Medium body, with an almost chewy feel at times. Decent carbonation. Some alcohol is felt, but not overwhelming. Pretty nice to sip on."
"D - Moderate drinkability - abv is rather potent, and not really that well hidden. Flavors are rather potent, not considered a session beer."
" D- This beer has a full pungent hop flavor with support from caramel malt and other softer hop flavors. This is really easy to drink especially for 8.5 %. It would be nice to taste this with a bit of age as I suspect the hops would soften and the malt would grow."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a hazy, iced tea-ish color with a one finger head that quickly settles into a light collar. There does not appear to be much carbonation in the murky haze. Aroma is sweet with a slight hint of citrus fruit. 1st sip is smooth and sweet, with some of the citrus flavor in the aroma present in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is of medium heft. I don't really notice much of a hint of the 8.5% abv, so these are nicely drinkable, but be careful as they could sneak up on you. Overall, an OK, but not great brew. The type of beer you'd get if they were out of your favorites."
"D: Personally, I think this is more of a sweet stong ale, not really a IIPA. It lacks the hop character necessary for a good IIPA. However for a sweet, high alcohol, brew, it's not bad at all!"
"12 oz. poured into a snifter. This pours a cranberry red with one finger of foaminess (not too carbonated). The aroma is of dark malts, caramel, honey, and a decent lode of hops (70 IBUs?). The taste is dark candied fruit, caramel, and clove. It leans a little toward the sweet side but not unbearably so, with some bitterness at the end. It's the best that South Carolina has to offer."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer, but I thought it would be bigger."
"I am really pleased with this beer. Hadn't heard of the brewery and bought a single on a whim. Very pleasantly suprised."
"Served on tap into a Dogfish Head tumbler. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and orange peel. The flavor was of malt, oranges, and chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. All of the aspects of this one seem to be very nice. If it were perhaps a little more complex it could be even better. I am glad I have been sending this out as an extra in some of my trades."
"Its to bad I cant find RJ Rockers stuff around here anymore, I think they make some quality stuff.Poured into a pint glass a clear amber/bronze with a well defined 1/2 finger white head atop,it held very well for a long time.Aromas are a mix of sweet malty caramel and sweetish dough,with a shot of piney hop that comes out more as it warms along with more present alcohol.Love the complexities on the palate,its quite toasty and warming with a big amount of caramel and sweet breadiness,there is a nice shot of piney hop in the finish.Its warming and basically a double ESB in my mind,a little light in the feel, but I really liked this beer."
"Considering the high ABV, Bell Ringer is dangerously smooth and easy-drinking, with a nice rich earthy flavor. It's simultaneously, a rich and smooth experience."
"It's kind of funny. What I don't like about this beer (too balanced) is what I like most about this beer (it's wonderfully balanced) and very easy to drink for a strong ale. I'd like to see RJ Rockers tip the scale to one side or the other and still keep the great drinkability. WIth all that being said it's a good beer that I'd recommend."
"Not the easiest beer to drink, but still tasty and complex. Would like to see the booziness hidden better, worth a shot, but I will probably not buy this one again."
"The mouthfeel is a bit chewy and thick. Very Creamy."
"Pretty good brew for the catch all category of Strong Ale. No one feature sticks out too much, which I am on the fence as to whether this is bad or good."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is very malty with caramel and toffee notes. The flavor is lots of caramel malt but not too much else. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This is the first strong style ale that I will stock permanently in my collection. Very drinkable with a nice kick, right up my alley."
"Malts dominate the taste, but I'm fairly certain it was hoppier the first time I tasted it. It's still like a barleywine, with a malty sweet mouthfeel countered by a bittering hop presence. Oddly, this is like an Arrogant Bastard Ale mixed with its more potent brethren, the Double Bastard--and the 8.5% ABV is probably spot-on for such a mixture! It's a pleasant enough beverage, and one I'll likely pick up again when I come across it on the shelves."
"Does not seem to fit any one style catagory, I have seen it refered to as an ESB, a DIPA, and a strong ale. I'm not sure exactly where it fits best, but it is a good well made, well balanced beer. Rather enjoyable"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a strange apricot color and was cloudy. It poured a tan head. The smell of this beer was hoppy for sure. There was maybe a little hint of caramel taste but it was blown away bt the high alcohol content. I will not buy again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is primarily of hops. Taste is very hoppy up front, a bit of malts at the end, a good degree of bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"This is a great strong ale that doesn't taste too strong. Excellent brew!"
"D - Drinkable but a bit high in abv which was not well masked."
"RECOMMENDED"
"D: It's good, but it's nothing special. If you like ESB, this might be up your alley, and I might grab a bottle of this again one day when I want something with a good hoppy punch to it. I want to like this beer, I really do, but I have to say that it doesn't really stand out on the first try."
"Hides the alcohol well."
"Pours a pretty nice hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice hop notes, and some citrus. The taste is malty, hoppy, slightly sweet, bitter, nice citrus note. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, nicely done."
"Drinkability: More of an English barleywine than an ESB, maybe an English Strong Ale; nicely balanced with understated hops, although the beer was brewed on 2/24/09 and it is now October"
"drinkability: ok"
"D - This doesn't really seem like an ESB. The color seemed too light. It really reminds me of a strong ale. That being said it is still a very tasty brew that may defy styles."
"D - The beer is drinkable, but it's not ringing any bells for me. The drinkability is standard, I could take it or leave it"
"D-Certainly nothing wrong with this one but it misses the mark for me."
"Taste is very malty with a bitter finish, body is a bit light and watery but still very solid. You would never know this is 8.5% either. Nice and easy drinker."
"D: This is the first beer I've tasted from RJ Rockers, and I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a big beer with some interesting qualities. It's not the most polished big beer, but it has a roughness that is mostly endearing. I'll look forward to trying some of their other offerings after this one."
"Drinkability: An ESB at 8.5%? I'd have to classify this as a strong ale. It's a remarkably balanced strong ale - definitely a characteristic of an ESB - but I'd be hard pressed to classify this as the latter when the flavors have to be this huge to cover up the alcohol. That being said, it does a good job (except in the nose) of hitting a few interesting notes, and I could see myself enjoying a few of these ... though more as a winter warmer than as a refreshing ESB."
"Poured a medium and hazy amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, nuttiness, caramel, and some fruitiness. Tastes of citrus, caramel, and the same fruitiness. Lighter alcohol in the finish."
"Thanks For Reading."
"Overall, much better than I expected. I would definitely enjoy having this one again."
"Drinkability is only hindered by minor notes of alcohol."
"This is a decent tasting beer but doesn't fit to style very well. It's almost all malt and so, could use some hop and bitterness presence."
"D: More like an imperial APA than anything else. More varied maltbill may be of help although this beer is far from bad -- it could just be so much more with a bit more complexity in the malt flavor and the allowance of more bittering and flavor from the hops."
"Really solid beer. Very good."
"This is not an ESB. More like and American Barleywine or Strong Ale. What ever you call it, it is a good beer. Something I would recommend."
"D - This is an odd one... Some wonderful characteristics (appearance & mouthfeel), some average characteristics (taste), and some negative characteristics (smell) blend together to make an innovative, but uninspired brew... This brew seems to be struggling with its identity as well... Is it an ESB? Imperial ESB? IPA? Something else?"
"Picked up a variety pack from State Line in Maryland. Appeared a clear light brown with a short off-tan head. Interesting, it tastes like a sort of English strong ale as this beer is pretty hoppy for an ESB. It also is missing out on the traditional creamy candy yeast character of British beer. Still, there's a tasty caramel and toffee malt followed by a rush of earthy, grassy hops. Very tasty and worth a try."
"D: A drinkable beer, though, like I said, not exactly what you think of an ESB as."
"Drinkability: A decent brew. it's very timid with it's flavor and aroma. Almost like a baby QUAD. Worth a try."
"grabbed a single of this from The Caboose, Ashland, VA"
"This is a good beer, but I am not sure what it is supposed to be. It is not like any ESB I have encountered before, though it stands pretty well on its own, whatever its genre."
"The drinkability of this ale is fairly low for me. I like it but it doesn't demand another. I would rather have this one as a slow sipper on a rainy day - much like today. This is a delcious beer that fits with a lazy Sunday afternoon."
"This is a full bodied hearty ale. Big feel and warming to the insides. I would go back to it for sure."
"Drinkability: I'd sip this beer. This is not a session beer. More of a sip & savor. I really enjoyed it."
"Overall, this was a decent Strong Ale, but it was a little one-sided (the sweetness) for me."
"The next few categories are where this beer shines, in my opinion. This is a very smooth and balanced strong ale. The 8.5% doesn't make itself well-known. Lots of caramel sweetness, with some citrus and grassy hop bitterness to balance it out. Pretty clean finish. Doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Great balance, and such a smooth and easy drinker. To me, this is as sessionable as a strong ale can get."
"My favorite of the Rockers collections. Bell Ringer has a dark copper color with a 1/2 inch head that fades thin. When I first tried this I expected a real strong alcohol taste being that it is a high gravity brew and 8.5%, but the alcohol did not overwhelm the flavor or aroma. Loads of malt and hops in this one! Hits the palate sweet with some bitterness towards the end. Be carefull with this one, 2 and I was on my way to getting my bell rung."
"The taste should categorize this as an Imperial IPA not a strong ale. Not much malt at all in this. It is FULL of citrus hops, specifically grapefuit. There's some sweet orange peel laced in the hops too. The after taste has a very slow tongue numbing bitterness and I usually don't like tongue numbers but it's so gradual I don't mind. Really good hoppy beer and definitely worth a visit!"
"*edit: okay, I take one thing back: the buzz kicked in* ;-)"
"Pours a hazy dark copper with little head--mainly a white ring. No lacing. The smell is caramel malts with bread & some citrus hops. The taste is fruity hops & sickeningly sweet malts; bready. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost flat, thick. This is a drinkable beer and could be quite sessionable due to its smoothness. Reminds me somewhat of a barleywine."
"This poured a hazy copper with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like caramel and honey wheat and cultured yeast, with some orange hops and a bit of raisins and alcohol. It tasted like bitter orange and copper hops, balanced with sweet caramel and earthy barley malt, along with some creamy yeast and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a fairly enjoyable beer. It had a nice scent, and pretty good flavor and body. It wasn't totally clean, and the noticeable alcohol detracted from its drinkability. But it was still a decent drink - much better than the Patriot Pale."
"M + D: A little thin in body, but the flavour does a little to help save that. It does manage to leave some lingering tastes on finish, so it's obviously not TOO thin. Being one of their bigger offerings, it's a sipping candidate, but it does go down quite easily, so take it as you will. A solid offering, with some aspects to it reminding me of Long Trail's Double Bag. Worth checking out."
"D - did I just finish this bottle? This was surprisingly light and smooth. Finishes before you know it."
"I really do love strong ales like this where there is some balance and still drinkable. A thumbs up!"
"Not a session beer but a nice, local treat from Spartanburg."
"Overall, a good beer that is interesting, and still has a good level of drinkability. Smells like a double ipa, but tastes like an american strong ale, I think this one would fit fine for many extreme beer drinkers no matter what side they prefer- hops or malts, as I think this one has good amount of both. Maybe this is a mild double english ipa..."
"Can this beer be described as inoffensive and uncomplicated? Yes. Despite that, or perhaps even because of it, is it a very drinkable and enjoyable beer? Yes."
"A nice very drinkable brew!"
"Tried this beer in a bottle at Jay's Midtown Tavern in Greenville, SC. Pours with a bit of a chill haze which turns into a copper/amber shade. Hop notes aren't overwhelming but overall it has a pretty nice aroma to it. This is definately a full bodied beer...lots malt and hops. I was really suprised to find out this beer was an 8.5 ABV. I wouldn't have believed it if it wasn't written on the bottle. Overall, I was very impressed with this beer from RJ Rockers. Not sure I would classify it as a DIPA, the bartender even told me it was not meant to be a DIPA. Definately give this beer a try!"
"Pours an attractive hazy orange with a nicely lasting white head. Smell is very mild and more caramel and faint hops than would be expected in a DIPA, but still a pleasantly malty and faintly fruity nose. Taste is fairly balanced with a slight leaning towards hops. A bit of sweet caramel up front along with fruity, orange and tropical fruity hops, along with a noticeable alcohol presence. Medium to full mouthfeel with medium, crisp carbonation. Solid DIPA, but could have hidden the ABV a touch better and been a bit more vibrant in the nose. Still enjoyable."
"I'm so bored with this beer that I barely made it through this review. This one needs a major overhaul as opposed to some additional refinement."
"Drinkability: Doesn't feel as alcoholic as it is, and it's very easy drinking and different for this style. I enjoyed it a lot and would certainly try it again."
"Pours a hazy, unfiltered orange with a bit of sediment floating about. Decent head and some lacing as well. Light aroma, somewhat waxy and sweet with malt. The hops are lightly citric and floral, but they are very subdued if pleasant. There is a touch of alcoholic heat at the end as well. The taste is also pretty pleasant, but I'd say it needs more hops as the sweet malt is more noticeable by far. There are some lightly citric spicy hops that add some bitterness, and the alcohol is well hidden this time, but the hops are not the star they should be. Very smooth and easy to drink, and a fairly pleasant beer overall, but could definitely needs some more hop oomph to be called a double IPA."
"Pours orange/red with a small 1/16 inch fairly white head. Smells of alcohol and malts. First sip is rather bland with the malts over powering the hops. A slight note of fruits is present in this light bodied beer The 8.5% ABV is very well hidden - unfortunately so is much of the flavor. This tastes more like a session beer than a high gravity. Not the punch I want in an DIPA."
"Bell Ringer has the outlines of a quality DIPA down pat. Now the Rockers boys need to fill in the center with loads of lupulin goodness. Words of wisdom for the day: shortage or no shortage, hoppy beer gotta be hoppy. Word to your brewer."
"D - Probably the easiest-drinking DIPA I've ever had. Terrific mouthfeel and very well balanced."
"just how i like them! wow this beer has a schnozzy on it too. highly drinkable, certainly refreshing, a beer one could handle several of...at least i would enjoy several at a sitting."
"If you like a DFH 60/90 minute, then you will like this"
"Drinkability: A fine, tasty brew, but those of you seeking a really punchy hop character or a coma-inducing level of hop bitterness will be left disappointed and full of rage. Instead of a double IPA it's more like a one-and-a-half IPA."
"Drinkability is really pretty high. It has a lot of character of a lighter IPA, though with good depth and decent bitterness. I found this one to be fresh and easy drinking, despite its abv and overall strength."
"A little on the hazy side with an amber/orange hue. There was a smattering of off-white foam from the pour that quickly settled to a thin ring and skim of fine bubbles. Looked sort of viscous during the pour. Floral hop aroma with quite a bit of caramel. Note of citrus and pine were present, but weren't very strong. Solid bitterness, not overpowering, that became piney towards the end. Quite sweet, lots of caramel particularly just before the finish, which then stayed fairly balanced between malt and pine. Hint of lingering alcohol on the tongue. Full bodied with carbonation a little bit low, fairly smooth and viscous. Nicely balanced and easy to drink, but lacking the hoppy punch that I expect from a DIPA. It seemed like it was crossing into american barleywine territory, especially in the flavour."
"The lingering bitterness reduces drinkability points. The 8.5% alcohol is well-concealed, though, and aids in the drinkability. I am however, glad to see more Southeastern breweries taking on these big styles we've been so deprived of."
"Amber-brown color with good head of suds. Very smooth for such a potent brew. Great balance of bitter hops and sweet malt. Robust and potent but terrific drinkability. Next to the Patriot Ale, this is the best brew that Rockers does and certainly the most kick-ass."
"Bell Ringer pours an orange-amber with a small half inch white head. The head dissipates to wisps of foam, leaving a small amount of lace down the side of the glass. The smell is full of sweet, toasty, and caramel malts rounded off by citrusy hops, perhaps cascade, which I believe I remember from a visit as the brewer's favorite. The taste is up front with a bready malt characteristic along with some caramel flavor. While the hops certainly make a presence, this is not a Double IPA. The malt and hops stay in balance with each other, which will separate this from your average Double IPA. Alcohol also makes a slight appearance. The mouthfeel is nice: medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Overall, this is very good beer and remarkably drinkable for the alcohol content. I probably prefer a Double IPA, but as far as the double pale style goes, this one is far more drinkable than most."
"Overall this was just great. I cannot say enough good things about this. It was well crafted, awesome to drink and just a fantastic beer, anyone who wants to try, a growler is on its way I would be happy to send it!!"
