4.38,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Interesting imperial red ale, with a mellow mouth feel and a nice balance - it starts out hoppy but it is well balanced with the malt in the beer, and it leads to a surprisingly smooth experience. Finishes with a bit of an alcohol aftertaste, although not unpleasant by any means. I'd definitely get another one next time I'm there, and would highly recommend.","Danobold","Apr 08, 2012"
4.32,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is my new favorite beer (until the next one). Had it a few times at various places around town. Color is reddish-orange with a slight haze. Aroma is a pungent piney-ness with a twist. I am very curious about the types of hops they have used in this brew. Good body and mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer despite its ""size"" (abv and OG). Good rich malty carmaelly flavor but not at the expense of the hops. I will be drinking this whenever I can. I'd love to see more of it from Peticolas. I can't wait to try their Scottish Ale.","tang214","Mar 10, 2012"
4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the Holy Grail Pub in Plano. The beer pours a hazy orange-brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of sweet caramel notes with some cherries and dark fruit, as well as a little bit of pine. The flavor is more of the same. I get some pine and orange notes from the hops, as well as some caramel and cherries. The alcohol is definitely present, but doesn’t hinder the drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Mar 03, 2012"
