"Note: 2014 vintage"

"Surprisingly light sweet boozy nice"

"Loved it, had several large pours from the tap at the local ""my favorite"" beer store, then took a 4 pack home. Sweet, fruits, caramel, great feel. i may have given it a little less than 5 but reading the reviews by reviewers that obviously thought they were buying a different style of beer pissed me off! I bought this beer because I WANTED a sweet, sticky, strong drink, just like this! I was a treat. Cheers Du Claw, thank you."
"Very good with a nice boozy taste."
"Tasted like apple pie moonshine for me. Not bad...love the ABV and was happy to try it."
""
"This was an aged 2011 vintage. One dimensional - too sweet."
""

"Taste is grimace-inducingly strong with the malts not enough to cover for the massive wave of alcohol. Not enough hops to provide a bitter, clean finish either. There are better huge beers out there, but most of those tend to fall in the stout category where the alcohol can be balanced by a heavy malt load. Its an interesting beer to try, I can finish my bottle and would like to see what a 3 or 4 year old vintage would taste like, but I wont go searching for this. Too boozy."

"O: this is like drinking gasoline with a ton of sugar added, it's absolutely awful"
""
""
""
"Overall it is a very poorly done beer and not one that I will be trying again."
""
""
""
"It's a lot like drinking a very flavorful malt tree sap, but in a way kind of fun.  Doesn't really have much wow appeal, more of a go for broke sense.  Regardless it is still enjoyable."
""
"Overall –  I was actually quite surprised.  I was expecting something a bit boozier in nature, but the sweetness and doughtiness of the beer really nicely balanced the rummy booziness of the beer and made it very palatable.  For such a big beer this one was rather well done."

""
"2.79/5: Rather unsophisticated, but if you enjoy mixing apple cider with Fireball, you'll probably love this"
"Full, velvety smooth body, drinks like a scotch on the rocks.  Slight tempered burn.  This is extreme beer, gone extremely right."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Well, I’ve had few as big as this one.  It drinks almost like a barleywine.  Aside from DFH’s 18% nonsense, I’ve not experienced anything quite like this.  I bet this would age well, and the alcohol end up less pronounced.  It felt lucky to try it, but you won’t see my buying another unless the jack it back up to 20+ abv."
"O- Overall this is a nice big beer,and probably the nicest extreme beer I have had.  The alcohol is there-but its not overpowering or annoying-it is also much more present in the nose and mouthfeel than it is in the actual flavor."
""
"Interesting beer. Score is for how much the flavor seems to develop over the course of the drink."
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - A sipping beer at best.  Beer advocate has the wrong ABV. The bottle I drank says 17.23. not 21.92."
""
""
"This is really just a mess of a beer. Too many high fermentable sugars results in a thin bubbly boozy brew with little identity. Lots of cider notes, astringency and fusels. For the price, it should be avoided...certainly are better versions of an American strong ale out there. I have another bottle, so might revisit it and revise this if I have even a slightly better experience, but as of now, this was a drain pour for me..."
""
"Overall: It's well worth trying. I would obviously recommend it to those who enjoy high alcohol beers, but namely Belgian ones with a bit of fruity and spicy character to them. You will get enough flavor out of the beer that it won't end up tasting like pure alcohol. I definitely recommend having some food nearby, especially crackers or pretzels to refresh the palate after taking a sip or two."

"O- Overall, I like it. It's tasty and just a pleasant beer to drink. I'm sharing the bottle with my sons, because I think it would be a mistake to try to kill it alone. Enjoyable, but not for you if you don;t like sweetness."

"5 - Overall this is an amazing beer, I have never had anything like it. The consensus is barleywine but it is much fruitier than any barleywine I have ever had. Another BA at the tasting, ucsbmullet commented that he thought it had some age, he guessed about two years. My first guess was a vintage big bottle of DFH Olde School Barleywine but the bottle isn't the right shape and it had an un-branded cap so I am going with my first instinct which is the only 15%+ beer from MD (where Oline73 is from) and that is DuClaw Colossus."
""
""
"M: It's full but a thinner full bodied brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm struggling to drink this glass. Way too sweet."
""
""
""
""
"Impressive, and not what I was expecting, but I don't know what I was expecting... Sweet, but not malty. Almost like mead."
"D: This was a very nicely brewed beer, given the alcohol level. Scent and taste weren't too over the top. But the body was like sludge and the alcohol was obvious, so it must be sipped. Could probably age forever, but nice now. Bold and complex, and great to contemplate. Recommended."

"M- Full bodied, bit creamy, definitely got a nice heat to it. Nothing near what a 20+% beer should be though. This is insanely drinkable. Like, holy shit if I'm not careful I'm gonna be on my face drunk. Not as syrupy as a huge stout or barleywine, so the heat doesn't hide as well, but I've had hotter 9-10% beers than this. Flavors are sticky, but not too long lasting. Very well put together, and it doesn't have anything disjointed I can complain about."

"Since I have a sweet tooth I was dying to try this and glad I splurged 30 bones (live a little)...poured a reddish copper with small head that died quick and left tiny lace running down my snifter. A boozy aroma of malts as I pick up hints of roasted but mostly some caramel, syrup/molasses and/or sugary goodness, cinnamom and spicy pepper and a touch of chocolate, and for some reason I'm getting a touch of fruit like cherry (the label says apple but it smells/taste like cherry to me). Taste is more of the same as this is an intense brew yet for all its thick, sticky, syrupy, malty goodness I feel that it is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. Real sweet as the caramel, cinnamon, touches of chocolate, and cherry-like fruit (although w/ label saying apple one could say this beer resembles a strong apple brandy), but also a dry edge as the spices and cinnnamon come into play. I also get a minor citrusy hop bite on the backend, which gives the slightly boozy and warming finish a little crisp snap. This beer was great to sip on and it took me a long time to sip and I think i had a minor buzz but it was worth the price as the sweetness doesn't get grating and kept going down easy and the warming enhanced the sweetness but the beer doesn't get too boozy."
"D- split a 22 with at least 4 friends and you'll be good any more and your done son."
"Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"Thanks dyan for the hookup"
"I'm going to be sipping this one for a couple of hours. Either that, or be asleep someplace between here & bed. Damn. Good beer that could easily be split 4 or 5 ways."
"22 oz bomber-clear amber color w/a mohogany tint & no head. Sweet raisin aroma. Very sweet flavors of raisins, toffee, caramel, & some faint candied sugar. Amazingly, the alcohol is not overpowering, but it has quite the warming property to it. A definite sipper, very sweet, almost like a mead or aptiff. Great after dinner drink, but you aren’t gonna drink too much of this. I think it will age well, we’ll see. Long sweet finish."
"Overall: Really smooth considering the abv. I think this one was better than the last batch."
"O- Really nice beer by DuClaw- and totally lives up to its name. This is a beer to be sipped, savored, respected, and probably shared. I enjoyed this one, and if you like big, bold beers, you will too. Just remember the ABV, or you might end up on the floor!"
"Poured a deep dark brown, with a big head that fadeed to nothing. Some nice lace down the glass, lots of activity left in the film on top, looks good. Smell was so complex it is even hard to describe. Everytime you went near it you smelled something different. Bready tones the first time, spiceness the second, alchol, some fruitness, a bit of the hops, it offeres a variety in every sense of the word. the taste is big, thick, full of alcohol, which is not even remotely hidden here. Lots of dark fruits and berries can be found in here if you look. Grassy tones, apricot, pear, very complex and lots of flavors seem to be battling each other. Almost tastes like a cross between an american and belgian strong due to al the complex things going on in here"
"O: Really nice! To be honest, I had never had any desire to try this beer due to its price and it's gimmicky nature. However, I'm glad I did! This is twice as good as DFH's high octane brews such as: World Wide Stout, Raison D'Extra, and Olde School... for starters."
"Beer is thin and super sweet, reminds me of apple brandy. Shockingly not boozy, very sweet, not bitter, mildly dry finish. I'd wager to say I'd have this again. Illogical, very smooth for a beer of this strength. Shocking really."
"An interesting beer, but it took me over a half hour just to drink my 6 ounce serving (my cheeks were starting to warm half way through). In small portions, this would make a nice after dinner drink or liquer. Not sure what I would ever do with an entire bomber of this stuff."
"O: This is a sipping beer @ 21 % alcohol by volume. It is strong and robust and amazing! Wow – That is all I can say."
"This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. For the huge abv, it was very approachable and I would certainly drink it again. During the tasting of this brew Deuane made the comment that this tastes like the beer version of Boilo... Honestly, I can't disagree with that. Spot on with that comment Deuane, thanks again for sharing!"
"Had on tap at an Oktoberfest event in MD. Wow. Pours mahogany with a small tan head. Aroma is of fruit, honey, wheat, and spice. There is not much alcohol in the aroma, which is surprising. Taste is of very dry honey, dark fruit especially raisins, and wheat. Lingering taste of sugary, dark fruit. The alcohol is well masked, but you definitely know it is there. It doesn't creep up on you, in facerapes you for the entire beer. Mouthfeel is sticky, but drinks easy. The drinkability given the amount of alcohol is frightening."
"Sticky sweet fruit cocktail of plum, pear, and apple. Malt? Nope. Syrupy body, and rather sweet, which effectively masks the alcohol. Surprisingly drinkable. A 22% booze bomb is the perfect way to end a night, just be sure to split the bottle 8 ways or more... thanks Joe!"
"A whopper of a beer this is. The biggest I've had from duclaws and undeniably huge. Pours an attractive marmalade brown color with a thin orange tan head. Smell is like marmalade as well. Taste starts out like marmalade but breaks down into cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves finally goin to a thin trace of malts. Considering the strength it has this beer is a rather gentle giant not revealing its huge abv in its taste (I barely noticed any burn). The drinkability of this beer is almost scary but luckily it's huge price and low availability inhibits drinking alot of it"
"Good work DuClaw..I'm proud of you."
"Colossus has been, according to the DuClaw website, verified by the Siebel Institute to 21% abv. Hard to believe, and yet... I buy it. I would buy it, too, if I could. The cleanest, most devilishly smooth ultra-high ABV beer I've had to date. Colossus is also the tastiest 20%+ beer I've had that's not called Utopias."
"Drinkability:This is an amazingly drinkable, well balanced, high ABV beer."
"Yikes! Not what I expected at all. Tastes like corn syrup with maple flavor added. If Aunt Jemima brewed a beer I imagine this is what I think it would taste like. The beer has good carbonation and a nice look to it but there is way too much unfermented sugar left in this beast. The reason the alcohol is hidden so well is because of the sugar. I don't have a problem with sweet beers either...this one just missed the mark for me."
"Pours a medium red/amber color, with a decent amount of carb, I wasn't really expecting much. Smells are sweet malts, slight apple, some clove and other spices. BAM! This beer is awesome, liquid French toast, in an extremly good way! I was not expecting it to be this damn good, there's some cinnamon, vanilla, a lot going on here. Mouthfeel is chewy, very pleasant. The drinkability is incredibly surprising given the abv of this beast. I think this beer might have been the show stealer at our tasting, as no one knew what to expect. So good!"
"D- This beer despite being such a huge ABV is very drinkable. I think this beer is flying under the radar so you should seek out pronto before it blows up. I know I'll be looking out for some more soon."
"D- The alcohol is exceptionally hidden... to the end that I would guess this to be a 12% ABV beer in a blind tasting. This makes for a fantastic dessert beer and/or nightcap."
"D: Not really drinkable. Nice flavors but too much of everything. Just never really comes together."
"The drowsiness is catching up to me, and without the music I had earlier, I can't think of a good lead-in for this brew. Dammit. Well, let's go this route: I bought this bottle based on the intriguing description on the label and the strangely high ABV (and equally high price tag...). Now, I'm not sure what an epic beer ought to look like, but this one does not appear all that impressive: a surprisingly clear garnet with a minimal amount of fuzzy head. Impressive? Nope, but pretty nonetheless. The smell, on the other hand, comes across exactly according to expectations: heavy alcohol tones, bordering on the kind of antiseptic you are bombarded by during every visit to a hospital or old folks' home, o'ershadowing some sugary maple, honey, and cherry highlights. You can definitely tell this guy's gonna hurt ya. Not quite, surprisingly. Yes, there's still a kick o' the 'hol, but it's not as bad as expected. Instead, the honey, cherry, sour apple, and maple flavors come through in a big way, creating some sort of syrup combo (cough and pancake) that strains the buds to their very limits. I'm stuck between opposing positions here: I'm not happy with the flavors, but, at the same time, I don't hate them either. It's both, the epitome of a love-hate tasting. My tongue is like the woman from ""Chinatown"" or the plastic surgeon from ""The Venture Brothers"". Confusion reigns, but it is clear that these flavors are not sticky and are also not hampered by anywhere near excessive carbonation, but they do sort of malinger for a while during a very long, dry finish. Honestly, I don't think I could guzzle this if I wanted to, and I'm kinda glad about it. Still, I'm thankful for the experience."
"The drinkability is very high for a beer of this strength."
"D - Yeah, Colossus is a monster with plenty of heat, but its not as menacing as a 21% ABV brew would imply. Don't let it scare you... this is spicy, fruity and quite drinkable for what it is."
"D: At 21% this is a sharing beer. We had 6+ people and it was still a struggle. Not one to try on your own."
"D: What would you expect with a 20%+ beer? This is a sipping beer, to be savored and enjoyed at the end of the evening -- much like a fine port or sherry."
"I was ill-prepared for this beast. I had no idea I was coming face to face with such grotesque (twisted) fruit and floral flavors. Difficult to pick a fruit exactly, it seemed like some chaotic combination of prunes, rosepetals, allspice/ginger/instant cider, peach/mango, some red and green jolly ranchers, robitussin, and cotton candy.. Yeah, I'm not standing by that as scientific but it's somewhere in that arena in terms of sugary-floral-sickly-sweetness. This was an issue at first because prior to opening I was thinking bitterness, brandy, no. It should be noted that my sweettooth is pretty weak... yeah, keep your rumplemints, gran marnier, and jaegar. The sweetness was so unexpected that at first my crutch to deal with it was some homemade jalapeno salsa which I'd have intermittently through the first couple oz's. That leveled it out quite well, and at the point I had waded in past my balls, I was able to drink it like a normal human. By the end, I had finally come to enjoy the bizarre and extreme concoction, both for its uniqueness and for the wallop it was giving my tongue, and its medicinal warming. I have a feeling that like many things, a beer of this stature is an acquired taste. It was remarkable how well-disguised the alcohol is, considering. Now that I know what I'm up against, I think I'm ready for another bout with this one to get a better reading, and for nuking it, which I didn't know was possible. And yes that will then be a shot, which might even need a chaser. Obviously drinkability is low for the average brute, unless you drink gran marnier shots with breakfast. Everyone should buy this if they see it to reckon with it's unique presentation when normal human beer seems boring, or to make drinking a 22 with a pal more akin to a sporting event of straight-face keeping."
"I'm having trouble finishing a single glass. This might make a good marinade or other cooking ingredient. Not a beer."
"Drinkability: American Strong Ale, indeed! It's more of a shooter than it is a beer. Perhaps it's a hot, chaotic mess, but it's still strangely alluring (minus the $40 price tag though)."
"Not that great when heated. It's like all I can taste is the alcohol. This one's probably best served slightly chilled like white wine, in a sipping glass."
"I had this at a temp. of abour 50 degrees. This became very overpowering to drink after a while and I choose to cut it with a hoppier beer to take out the sugar taste. I wasn't impressed with the price! $35/bottle! I could by 4 120 minute IPA from Dogfish head for that price and still have the same ABV content. It's worth having once though. I didn't get a chance to warm it to 105 degrees like the bottle recommends to taste the warm apple pie effect. This bottle if sipped will accomodate two people without a problem, so get someone to split the cost with you. This is also available at Wine World beer and spirits in the fridge to the left of the walk in door on the top shelf. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Good. Just a little too sugary for my taste, but this is what is expected in a beer with an alcohol content of 22%."
