I expected more from this beer (perhaps simply because it comes in a bomber).

Aroma of very light toasted malt, nuts and a spicy component similar to cinnamon . Flavor subdued brown sugar, sweet bready malt finishing sweet with light hops and a hint of chocolate. Aroma and flavors are attenuated, but pleasant. Medium bodied. Somewhat like a very light, sweet porter. The elements are all here, but it needs a little more flavor and integration. No too bad for the price, has a distinct malt syrup flavor that is uncommon in most beers.","LiquidAmber","Oct 16, 2012"

It's hard to know what to expect from it, as it really gives no indication of what type of beer it is, other than being an ale. But I'd compare it most to a porter, a style that I'm not all that fond of in general. As for the flavor, I found it pretty undrinkable. Very malty and bittersweet.

I'd put this one in the latter category. Despite Boatswain being unable to correctly identify their products (see Boatswain IPA and DIPA) this is as good as some pricier brews of a similar dark & strong style---whatever it is. I plan to go back and get another one or two of these. I consider it a good beer for the price.","5thOhio","Jul 30, 2012"

The hops comes through on this, and even though it's classified as a brown ale, I would've said that it reminds me more of a black IPA with a hint of smoked/cooked something on the end. The carbination was good and it had a nice head. I didn't have very high expectations with this beer, but it was on sale for $1.99, and I was pleasantly surprised. Would I buy it again?

It was malty and surprisingly hoppy, as the bottle brags about the elevated IBUs (80) on the label. The mouthfeel was the only fault here. It was a bit on the boozy side, plus there was a bitterness that lingered in the middle of my tongue. But, the finished was light and smooth.
