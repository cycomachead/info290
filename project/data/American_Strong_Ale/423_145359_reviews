"Starts as a Hairball, finishes as a Rodenbach."

"Yummy! Wish I would have bought 2."

"I wasn't feeling the caramel-toffee malt and for certain, the piney hops were weak at best and only noticeable in the aftertaste for a brief moment. Maybe it was the high carbonation that did this beer in, as it felt like a soda with some booze and yeast thrown in for good measure. I wouldn't call this a drain pour as much as it an underwhelming let-down. Yes, American Strong Ales can vary in their flavor profile and strength but in this instance, I felt that this beer was categorized incorrectly. Fans of Boulevard should still give this a go, because it's a fairly solid beer from top to bottom. Where it falls in their portfolio is the bigger question..."
"Pours into an imperial nonic a rich deep amber with a frothy off white head atop.Aromas are on the lighter side with some resinous hops and caramel malts standing out most,seems a bit restrained.The flavors are held back a little it seems as well,pine resin and faint citric hops to go along with some caramel and brown sugar notes,the body is particularly thin feeling.Was hoping for a little more from these two top notch brewers,another ho hum collab."

"Not sure exactly what they were going for here. Flavor profile is messy"

"O: Not great, but good.  Like other reviews, not as good as expected from brewery - but still drinkable."

"A lush tan froth stands steady atop this reddish-brown brew.  Smells of persimmon, black grape, molasses and slight vegetal tannins.  Tastes of grain wrapped in notes of grape and plum, grape juice and a pinch of nutmeg.  Easy going down with a very slight alcohol presence, but still quite flavorful."

"While it doesn't necessarily explode with venerable nuance—and though I enjoyed it much better when I had it on tap in Minnesota (where listed as brewed at Odell), versus out of a bomber bought in Kansas City (listed as brewed at Boulevard)—it's by no means a weak celebration of two quarter-centuries of brewing."
"pretty forgettable strong ale in this one."
"Serving type: bottle"

"It pours a chill hazed amber under a 1” white foam cap with a very slight amber tint. The nose is faint with a light wisp of grape, light very ripe fruit, pine and light sugars. You first notice the toffee aromas, then grape to chardonnay followed by pine. A thread of light toffee runs all the way through the palate supported by light fruit with some piney bitterness on the finish. Nicely balanced. It has above average carbonation and medium to just below on the body."

"Wow! A very bland and unexciting offering by two breweries that generally offer impressive beers. I don't get this. Little nose or aroma and the flavor is just a tad distinctive with a mostly weak malt body and an overall metallic hop bitterness. Something big and mysterious is missing here, and this winds up being a near total dud when weighed against these two breweries other offerings. Weak and sickly in the grand scheme of things..."

"Tasted from a 750 ML bottle on December 25, 2014."

"Happy twenty-fifth anniversary Boulevard! Keep up the great work!"

"Sometimes, good breweries should continue to do their own good things and not collaborate."
"I really enjoyed this beer.  It was a bit lacking in body, but the taste was great.  Even with the lack of body, the fact that it was so smooth going down made the feel outstanding.  Carmel, toffee, and malt lead the way in the taste profile."

"Smells like a marzen.  Taste is big toasted malt, light chocolate, and light woodsy hops.  Taste is like a mix between a marzen and a pale ale, with not as much hops as I usually associate with a pale ale.  Not a bad beer, but when I heard these two breweries were collaborating, I was expecting much more.  A pass for me in the future."

"On draft, this was way hoppier & way more drinkable.  Two great brewers, you'd think would come up with something better than this?"

"Pours a hazy, brown/pink color.  2/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of citrus hops, hint of spice, hint of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of pine, and a hint of yeast.  Fits the style of an American Strong Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, hint of sugar, hint of caramel malt, hint of yeast, hops, and a hint of fruit.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, complexity, and blend, but the body is underwhelming."

"This was excellent.  When two of my favorite breweries got together to make a beer, I knew I wanted to try it, and I finally found a bottle.  It's a great golden ale, not too heavy, very smooth, and I want more.  I've heard the Boulevard version is the one in bottles and is a little maltier, as compared to the Odell version that is on tap and tends to run a little hoppier.  So keep that in mind if you are looking around; they may be slightly different depending on which brewery made it and how you are drinking it.  But either way, this is a beer well worth seeking out, and here's hoping for a 50th Anniversary collaboration!"

"Golden cooper color with caramel, sweet, burnt sugar notes. Alcohol well hidden, super smooth."

"Overall - I'm not convinced this is an American Strong Ale, but then again I'm not sure how to classify it. Its not any of the pale ale styles, not enough hops. Of course not a porter or stout. So I guess this classification works. The history and story behind this beer and the breweries who collaborated on it is much more interesting than that of the beer itself, although it is certainly worth a try. A bit on the steep price side."

"i had hoped for a much more adventurous recipe when i saw these guys were collaborating. a strong pale to ipa on the hops front, but more bitter than flavor there, over a unique and robust autumnal grain base, copper and wheaty, fuller bodied, and balanced the way an esb might be. nothing new in terms of style overall though, i really thought they would get more creative to mark such a momentous occasion, so i am let down by that. the beer though, as unambitious as it is, is very good. full flush warming body, aggressive bubbles, and a nice tacky oily hop character in the finish. its big in flavor, and its perfect for this time of year. i have no issue with the beer at all, i just had hoped for a lot more with these two giants getting together. maybe next time..."

"Tired this at a beer school event in KC. The founders of Boulevard and Odell's where there talking about their history for two hours. I don't think strong ale is the correct style, more of a ESB with Belgium yeast. The Boulevard beer is a very malty compared to the Odell style ( only on draft) that is considerably more hoppy. I was a little disappointed with both of them but was awesome to hear their passion for two years."

"Old Chicago tap. Drank in pewter stein. Like a light IPA. Not as hoppy as their (Odell's) regular IPA but still has the great citrusy notes."
