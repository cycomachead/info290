"On tap at Dinosaur bbq in Syracuse.  Dark, malty. Little bit of bite to it. There is a little bitterness in the after taste.  Nicely done strong ale."

"Thought this would be a better beer than it is, still not horrible, and one that is sure to taste good with some morels and bacon grilled cheese."

"O: Funny name but not a great beer -- too much sweetness, a little bit too much alcohol presence, some odd off-flavors. All adds up to an underwhelming beer experience."

"O - This is a damn good beer. Great tasting yet packs a good punch. Highly recommend this beer for any strong ale or extreme beer fans."

"Middle Ages has a wide range of beers with good northeast distribution in bars and 22 oz bottles. The Wench has been one of their staples for years, a great beer for those craving hops in the winter."

"Check it out. I just hope that the wench is wailing about something other than the lack of hopsplosion."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the solid flavoring and the great feel to it. We were presented with a beautiful beer in coloring, and in foam, but the following taste after the invitation was robust, and as hoppy as advertised. The bitterness from the hops really dominated the finish, and you’re left with quite a different flavoring than you start with, which keeps the drinker guessing. The nose was comparatively weak, but everything else was exciting, and decidedly tasty."

"O: This beer is hard to describe as it its tangy and sweet with some dry characteristics. Due to the fact of its 8% ABV, its a big beer. Only for a good price would I seek this out again, but pretty good for a one off!"

"O-not a Bastard, but overall very solid, nice job Middle Ages"
"Amber in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a thick, rocky off-white foam that slowly reduced to a dense cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Intense caramel malt and citrus hop aromas along with a buttery nut aroma. Thick, syrupy feel with light, lazy carbonation. Floral and citrus hop flavors up front that slowly fade from beginning to end with a solid, sticky sweet caramel malt backbone. Finishes pretty cleanly with light floral hop bitterness in the back of the tongue."
""
""
""
"Appearance is a dusty reddish-brown, a dark amber with a coffee-coloured head and impressive lacing. Aroma of sweet caramelized malts and bready fruit. The flavour starts with a pleasant ""west coast"" style hop punch, but is then surprisingly sweet before its bitter closing. A nicely dry finish lingers with an alcoholic warmth appropriate for 8% ABV."
""
"Overall: The bitterness in the finish is a bit much, but I'm a fan of this beer. The warm alcohol is a welcome addition to the other flavors. 3.5"
"O/D-This is a hefty beer that has its pleasantries. It reminds me of a less refined Arrogant Bastard. I enjoyed this but was not in love with it. Still, its well worth a try. I can think of a good grouping of beers I would rather spend my $6 on for a bomber, but this was still a solid, big ale."
"O - I think this is a great example of a balanced strong ale. It does a great job of taking the ABV up a notch and increasing the malt/hop profile to match. I don't think this one will knock anyone's socks off, but it will certainly be a contender for their ""go-to big beer."""
""
""
"D: A big, rich, and firmly hoppy ale. Very approachable for its robustness of flavor. Yet although it does not flaunt its abv, it is obviously hefty. Very much a sipper – with both pleasant and aggressive aspects. A great brew for relaxing on a cold day. Superbly rich and enjoyable."
"Appearance is amber with a nice foam with good color. Smell has the right blend of hops and malt. This beer has nice mix of hops and malt that is felt on the tongue. Mouthfeel is good there is a slight lingering, but nothing that take away from the taste. Overall this is a fridge worthy beer. Get some and have a few peanuts and enjoy. Oh have this with some Old Bay Wings, you will not regret that."
""

"OVERALL: This was pretty enjoyable really. Made me think of an American hopped Belgian double – triple blend. Perhaps a bit too much heat for the ABV, but regardless, this was a flavorful, interesting and enjoyable brew that I’m glad to have tried. Thanks again for picking this up for me STEG."
""
""
"The off flavors and weird smell really ruined this one for me. The malt and hops don't shine through, and each sip is another dimension in odd, yeasty flavors."

"I'd say it's medium bodied with the carbonation on the light side; the mouthfeel isn't all that good but it's tasty and easy to drink so I give it a thumbs up. Nice.different.sort of.beer."
"This beer poured out with an explosive amount of head, I tried pouring slowly into two glasses and got no where with it... So I gave it some time to settle and eventually I got to look at the nice yellow body this beer has. The smell of yeast, malts and hops all show up in this one. The taste was quite nice, it had a really nice balance from start to finish. The mouthfeel was drinkable and easy to put down. Overall this brew wouldn't have gotten my attention without the girl on the label, but I'm happy to have got a bottle. It's enjoyable."
"Overall, surprisingly good for the cheesy label. I'd get it again."
"Drink- A huge mix of beer in this glass. Hoppy, citrus, malty, sugary. Bold a bit unbalanced but it works. I am glad to have had this and even more glad to have a double wench to ogle!!"
"The strenght of malt, alcohol, and hops; but in superb balance imediately remind me of Stone's Arrogant Bastard Ale except with a less pronounced in-your-face resiny hop bitterness. Still, a delightful beer for those who prefer strength and balance."
"D- i think the bottle i got wasnt the freshest, but i cant be certain. i wish they would just date their bottles. id like to have a crack at a bottle i know for a fact is fresh next time so i can compare. thanks again for the beer, vince."
"Pours a tawny color with a single-finger tan head and a good bit of lacing as it goes down. Thin collar throughout. The nose carries a good amount of brown sugar plus a nice bit of citrus. Smelling this, I thought this was an ESB. Maybe so, just a very strong one. Probably more properly classified as an English Strong Ale. Flavor brings a slight bit of diacetyl and some malty sweetness. Moderate fruitiness. The hops really don't come through until the finish, which is fairly bitter. Classic ESB-type profile. Really well done."
"Notes: This is definitely a well made and very enjoyable beer."
"D: A good, but not great beer offering a nice balance between malts and hops while allowing the alcohol to show through as well."
"medium body, average carbonation. drinks well. overall, a pretty good beer, I'd have it again."
"O-Kind of boring, but not bad."
"D: it is a pretty good beer overall. and it hides the 8% well. i could drink multiple glasses of this, but I don't know how often I would seek this out. The aroma is the best part of this beer IMHO."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking strong ale with a powerful hop bit. Alcohol is well integrated. One bomber is plenty."
"D/N- Very well done. Too bad this stuff is not readily available to me. Might make a trade in the future for a couple of bottles. I would like to see how this ages."
"This is a great favorite of mine. For a strong ale, it is easily on the palate with abundance of flavor and complexity. I really need to get out to the brewery, and get a fresh case. Have to do some draft and cask reviews for this as well. I enjoy the bottle but have had it on draft several times and found the things slightly lacking in the bottle are right on in the draft version."
"Conclusion: I feel it is becoming more and more rare to be totally surprised by a new beer. In this case however, I am happy to say that I am really surprised how good this beer is. It nailed every category and especially the mouthfeel; the best I have felt in an American strong ale. If I am ever around New York I will be seeking this one out!"
"Nothing particularly bad about this, but overall pretty average."
"I tasted Middle Ages at the mini GABF in Baltimore in the late 90s. I was in Syracuse last summer I bought this at Wegmans. It is a lovely beer."
"D-seems to be a reoccuring theme here but it is really nice and drinkable"
"Pours a crisp clear orangeish red. A good amount off-white head with great lacing. Smells hoppy and malty. A nice balance on the nose. Tastes A bit too sweet on the tongue. Some light bitterness on the pallette. Smooth and full bodied. A fairly decent strong ale but overall not outstanding. Pales in comparison to th double wench"
"If anyone has a FRESH bottle of this and would like to send it to me, perhaps my opinion would change."
"D: Easy drinking, if a bit of a sipper."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being a bit below average. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice flavors to it overall. Everything came together and worked pretty well. It showed off some nice hoppy and malty flavors throughout drinking it. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"This is an interesting beer. With less hops, it could be an English barleywine. With more malt (and hops to compensate) it could be an American barleywine. It's too dark to be an imperial amber, a la Nugget Nectar. I guess Strong Ale is a fitting classification, but it drinks a point or two less ABV than its listed 8%. A pretty solid beer that is going nicely with a bowl of dry roasted peanuts."
"d-robust flavors and smoothness of this beer along with good combination of malt and hops make this a great beer to enjoy, and is one of the best Ive had"
"I am glad I got to try this, but don't think I would choose it a second time if I saw it on the shelf."
"Strong, earthy and rough hoppy flavors abound. If there were an English strong ale, this would fit well. Has some bubblegum yeastiness that balances some of the burnt malty flavors. Hops are pretty unique, grassy and earthy...floral even. The Wench is a bit rough around the edges but makes for a fun one night stand. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel is not necessarily smooth and creamy, but it is certainly full. Reminds me of a cross between Hairy Eyeball and Arrogant Bastard with more of an English hop flavor. Pretty tasty beverage."
"Overall this was a solid beer that I am very glad I traveled into lower Manhattan to find it, along with a few other gems obviously. A really solid example of an English style strong ale, my favorite style, which I feel isn't crafted enough in this country."
"D: A very hop-centric strong ale with great attention paid to the malty details as well. The 8% ABV is not that noticeable through the strong, fruity malt flavors and dulls even further as the hops subside a bit and the brew warms. Complex and enjoyable; good for a disguised hop fix as well."
"Definitely a beer to savor. Yet I don't think it would be completely out of the question to put this in a pint glass and pound a couple. The malt backbone and complexity makes it drinkable enough."
"D - For a beer this rich and bold tasting, it does so without sacrificing drinkability. Very pleasant beer overall."
"Drink - A solid well-balanced IPA that is definitely worth trying. I'd really like to try this one on draft."
"Cheers..."
"M/D - Full bodied and a lasting bitterness. Very easy drinking for something this hoppy."
"Appearance is a clear/amber with 2 fingers of off/white, tan head. Smell is alcohol, dark fruits, plum and caramelized wort. Taste is almost caramel and prunes, actually delicious. Mouthfeel is good amount of carb, sticky. The drinkability of this beer is good when you share it, it might be too much if I did one on my own. Good beer."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is a touch high and prickly. Drinkability is good for a beer this bold, especially since 8% ABV strikes me as low just how big this beer feels. Superb."
"The taste is absolutely brilliant along with the dryness that you get from the intense hoppyness. The alcohol is alittle noticible but it blends well with all that is going on with this beer. I could sip this beer all day. Its a wonderful wonderful thing."
"Big body with a great smooth feel. Slick with alcohol and malty sweetness. No problem at all sipping this bomber til it's gone. High drinkability for 8%."
"Poured a copper/caramel color, with reddish hints when held up to light, into a pint glass, with less than a finger of off-white, good head retention, and good lacing. Smelled very malty, with hints of fig and raisin, as well as some hints of grapefruit and modest alcohol presence. Big malty dark fruit blend dissolving to more citrus notes at the finish, which also revealed some bitter peel as well as some alcohol. Thick feel, though mitigated somewhat by the modest carbonation content. Nice beer; hoppier than expected, though a little too thick for me to session."
"D- wailing wench is a splendid brew to enjoy. While there is some strength in the brew... I feel as though it is still so tasty. It has some alcohol... but you can still slam dunk this. Middle ages... you need to let the rest of the world know what you do!"
"D - Syracuse, you have a winner..."
"D - Very easy to drink, especially for an 8% ale."
"The body is pleasantly full, but again, not heavy. Drinkability is excellent. This bottle reminds me how much I liked this brew when I lived in Upstate NY. Worth seeking out."
"Very good beer, & additional points for busting out of the style box. Nothing extreme, just a good, well-crafted beer."
"Pours a clear chestnut color with a large off-white head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Rings of lace are left at every stage of the glass during consumption. Wonderful balanced aroma between hops and malt. Rich caramel notes first hit the nose then citrus and pine hops kicks in. I would not mind my DIPA's smelling and tasting like this but I know I am in the minority. Nicely balanced flavor as well. Caramel malt, and buttery yeast gives way to bitter citrus and pine hops. A touch of fusel alcohol makes its presence known at the finish. Finishes clean for such a robust beer. Medium body, enough carbonation to keep things lively, nice texture overall. I really enjoyed this beer. Seemed perfectly balanced to this drinker."
"D- This is a very drinkable ale that I could learn to trade for in massive amounts. I have been wanting to try this for a little bit and now I understand why people scream good reviews for it."
"Pours deep brown with a huge torrent of carbonation leading to a vast, long lasting head. Aroma is darkly caramel. Flavor is deep, caramelly, almost burned, with dark fruit and a strong hop flavor and a sharp, burning hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. This beer feels Heavy and primitive."
"Drinkability: Good but not something I would drink all night."
"Slick and full of hop oil, slides down the gullet with incredible ease. Perfect amount of carbonation, this brew cannot get much better. Slight alcohol warmth, though the alcohol flavor is hidden superbly. Drinkability is slightly above average, as this little number may destroy your palate if you are not converted to the gloriousness of the hop."
"Somewhat-cloudy brown brew turns ruby red against a light. Inch and a half of rocky tan foam settles to a stable half inch that leaves great lacing behind. Nose is a thick biscuit, huge caramel, vanilla... like creme brulee. Mild earthy and citrus notes also apparent. Taste is like creme brulee plus hops. Good hoppy bitterness that isn't apparent in the smell. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a lingering hop finish. Very enjoyable. Lace endures to the end."
"Notes: For a big beer it is relatively approachable. The hop flavor is a little different, but its not too intense or anything."
"Pours a dark amber with a nice beige head. Good lace and retention. Nose hase has sweet bready malts, toffee, caramel and light floral hops. Not exactly teh hop explosion as stated on the label. The taste was well balanced with subtle hebal hops and dark candy malts. Nice bitter finish, but again definately not a hop explosion. Full, lasting body is well carbonated. Nice strong ale, but definately not screaming with hops."
"Overall this was a solid beer that I am very glad I got to have on-tap in Syracuse for my first taste of it. I'm sure Wailing Wench and I will cross paths again."
"I finished the bomber, but was forcing the last few pours. Will try again just to make sure I didn't have a bad bottle..."
"Overall I am not sure what to make of this one. If it did not label itself o be soo hoppy I might have liked it a little more, but it set a bar I dont feel it reached."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Cant really drink more than 1 maybe 2 of these because it feels somewhat thicker than you would expect but great never the less."
"Thanks to aerozeppl for this bomber. Pours a deep amber color with a nice thick fluffy head, leaving some chunky lacing along the glass. Getting lots of bready, biscuity malts in the nose, along with a heavy dose of butterscotch.(typical of alot of their beers I think). Some floral hops lurking in the background. Not exactly ""screaming"" with hops as the label would suggest. Taste follows the nose with bready malt with a hint of caramel sweetness. Followed by a nice floral hop bitterness. The diactyl is quite noticable as well, with just a touch of alcohol. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Goes down smooth and easy. Good beer but I can't get over the diactly butteriness."
"A nice-drinking strong ale by Middle Ages."
"The aroma is hoppy and sweet with dark fruits. The flavor is a bit sweet with a brown sugar and carmel flavot, but the hops overpower it. Carbonation is high and the finish is dry. The hop bitterness lingers in the mouth a bit too long."
"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. It pours a deep brown color but comes out a dark amber/red when held up to the light. Has a thick cream colored head that goes away pretty quickly and not nearly as much lacing as I expected. The smell was a little different than I expected, but excellent. It didn't smell as hoppy as I expected but it was clearly present, then it had a nice sweet smell to it, almost like a brown sugar. The taste didn't quite live up to the smell, maybe it was the hype of the smell I just created. There was a citrus hop to it with some caramelized malt. Both the mouthfeel and drinkability was good, no alcohol bite at all. I really like American Strong Ales, this wasn't my favorite by any stretch, but it was good and I'd try it again, pretty original."
"The appearance is light brown with an average head. It reminds me of a root beer. The aroma is quite nice with loads of pine and grass hops. There is also caramel malt. The taste is like the aroma but the finish is astringent. The palate is smooth. Overall a well crafted beer."
"Drinkability: Solid for the summer or winter months, but more like a DIPA, which strong ales sometime represent. I could easily make this a session brew, as it's flavorful as hell without being over the top."
"Drinkability: One pint is plenty since it has such a wallop of complexities."
"M- Nice smooth full mouth feel."
"Conclusion: Not something I'd drink all the time, but nice to try now and again; this one's bold, brash, and makes no excuses for what it is, which is (IMO) a bit over the top. The sweetness is just a little bit cloying and a bit more depth would be appreciated."
"Bottle. Pours a clear brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of sweet malt and some bitter hops, plus a really an odd smell of curdled milk? Slight diacetyl. Flavor is more similar to an ASA with lots of malt and a bitter finish. Decent, nothing great but certainly drinkable."
"This is a good strong ale. No problem drinking the bomber. It is my first beer from Middle Ages Brewing. I think it would improve if there was more hop flavor and aroma, especially considering that it claims to be an ale 'screaming with hops.' That being said, it is still very good overall."
"I would definitely drink this as much as i can find it!"
"BUY IT!!!!"
"Drinkability is definatly there, but with the heat it has lowered my score just a bit. I can handle this one bottle, but more then one would probably drunken me up. Super glad I got to try this. I'm pretty interested would 2 years in the cellar would do for the taste, bringing down some of the hop bite and balancing the taste, as well as removing the warmth."
"Overall an average Strong Ale - hop presence is lacking but very drinkable. Not my favorite in style but would I would grab it on tap if I see it again..."
"The taste is complex and thorough, not a beer to be drank on an empty stomach. Mouthfeel is intriguing, with quite a bit of flavor hitting the palate. All in all, a great beer, and it is from upstate NY, so why hot ?"
"M/D- Fuller bodied with just enoughcarbonation. Not a session beer but very enjoyable and I certainly would try this beer again."
"All in all, im not sure Im qualified to review some of the MA Brews. I find my pallete cant sense out the positives that the beer typically gets from most reviewers. Im sure this has to do with not having the ability to appreciate the style. Sooo ... sorry for the low rating."
"D - First the label is easy to look at. The beer itself is pretty, and has plenty of flavor to be enjoyed. As the beer warms up it changes into a different drink, but equally as good. This is not the kind of beer I would sit down and pound, but I could see myself enjoying a couple. Would go nice with cheese."
"Pours a brownish copper color into my Chimay goblet. Several pillars of bubbles rise in the glass. A thin layer of head ponds the surface. Nose is mildly fruity. Very clear appearance. Very evident hops in this 8 percent Old Ale. As it warms, is it parsley maybe in the nose? Definitely herbal. The bitterness in this brew drowns away any maltiness or aggressive nose. Not a very balanced brew. Good but not special."
"D - This is definitely on the hoppy side for a Strong Ale. The hops really opened up as the liquid warmed up. However, this is wonderfully balanced ale with plenty of malty goodness and hop flavor."
"Taste: Pine and Citrus, it's pretty bitter. As it warms, Chocolate and Biscuit notes show up. Slick mouthfeel and great carbonation."
"I picked up a 22oz bottle of this having never heard of it. The chick on the label is kind of hot, btw. I poured this into my Chimay goblet. Pours a nice dark brown color. It was an easy pour, so there wasn't too much of a head. There was plenty of foam though that stayed atop the beer. Nice lacing left behind after the first sip. Sweet malty caramel aroma with a noticable alcohol presence. Smells a bit smokey and get a sense of some vanilla in there. The first sip was kind of harsh on a clean palate. A real malty sweetness to it with plenty of hops. Again, the alcohol is there. A touch of bitterness, but not too much. Becomes increasingly easy to drink with each sip and quite enjoyable. Medium to full bodied and quite smooth. Very drinkable. I wish I had another bottle to bust into tonight."
"This is a top flight American strong and has plenty of character with great balance and only a touch of alcohol. Great stuff from one of New York's top brewers."
"Mouthfeel is slick and slightly oily. Interesting indeed!"
"A much better beer than the first sip indicated. A solid brew."
"Drinkability: Not only was the label nice, but the beer behind it as well. If you love the taste of grapefruit, then look no further. This is your beer! Sometimes I thought the grapefruit was a little too much and wanted something new for a change. Luckily there were more flavors behind the grapefruit. Was it well balanced? Not really. There was no way in hell these toasted malts could balance out all of these grapefruit flavors. Would I drink this beer again? Even if they changed the label I would still drink this beer. It's great Strong Ale!"
"(rated Jun 26, 2007)"
"D: Always a great drinker. Their cask versions of their beers always seem to be hoppier than the bottled or draft versions. Very enjoyable."
"This is a very well balanced beer. Hops and malt are equally bold and complex, making for a highly drinable ale."
"D - This beer hides the ""Strong"" in its style very well. Add that to the delicious smell and taste, and factor in the great mouthfeel, and you've got yourself one wickedly drinkable beer."
"Poured a translucent dark orange color with a thick, frothy head leaving behind plenty of lacing. Aromas of hops, oil, fresh produce, and oranges seemed to come out nicely. The taste followed suit with a slightly timid hop profile that was chased by a brown sugar flavor. The finish was dry and crisp as might be expected for the style. The texture was a bit oily and poppy, but enjoyable. I shared this bomber with another person, so I did not quite have a full pint of it, but what I did have was plenty for me. I would not actively seek more of the same in a single session."
"Pours a pretty sexy-looking copper color, lots of dark ruby highlights, massive frothy tan head hangs around for a while, and leaves lots and lots of sticky lacing in the glass. Soft perfumey hops in the nose, and a huge & rich caramel malt aroma. Lots of caramel flavor, some slight citrus, and a good dose of alcohol coming through as well. Medium-bodied...I think I'd like this one a little more chewy. Pretty tasty, and definitely worth seeking out."
"Quite drinkable. A good beer, but not great."
"Very nice sipper with some strong food, this can stand up to a lot on the plate and not be overwhelmed by much of anything."
"Amber body with a sticky off-white head that laces well. Earthy hop aroma, with some citrus and sweet smoky malts. A lot more hops in the flavour than I was expecting, more or less wrestling the caramel bready malts to the ground and smothering them in citrus peel and earth. Full bodied and chewy - a very contemplative beer, and dangerously drinkable at 8%!"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Both score low due to level of hop bitterness. Again, this is not a balanced beer."
"HUGE ON HOPS, this one promises hops right on the bottle and delivers a truck load, and for those of you who like carmel malt, you wont be disapointed, the 8% alcohoal is hiden well. this one makes me happy that i have taste buds. if you can get one of these take it!"
"HV"
"Drinkability is pretty good for a strong ale, it's pretty tasty and smooth drinking, not to heavy and pretty clean. The lower price certainly helps!"
"D - Drinkability is good. For 8% it goes down easy. Limit is pretty much one bomber though. Too much carbonation holds this beer back but not by much. I would have this one again. Glad I got the chance to try it."
"D - Wouldn't session this one, and over time I think it would get a bit much. Lots of flavour and complexity though. Definitely worth trying."
"Off-white head with fair lace, deep red color, almost brown. The smell is very malty & fruity. Hints of sugar, malt, dark fruits, alcohol, and somewhat earthy. Medium-bodied with a clean finish. Highly drinkable for a strong ale and a good strong ale, but nothing epic. Recommended though."
"I was sorely disappointed by this beer. I was hoping for much better. The beer pours a darkish ruby color with lots of frothy head and lacing. The smell is rather pungent. There are molasses, caramel aromas upfront, with some dryish hop, heavy fruit aromas in the backbone. The taste is another matter. There is very astringent and bitter hoppiness, there is also a cloying almond-vanilla extract like unpleasant taste to the beer. Some reviewers commented upon the ringwood yeast used. Perhaps this gives the beer the phenolic weirdness that I couldn't get beyond. There is plenty of crystallized caramel maltiness to this beer throughout. The hops were just too biting and overall I thought the beer to be so out of balance that I could not enjoy this on any level. The aftertaste was a bit harsh as well. This is a one and done for me."
"D: the ASA is not really my favorite, but this beer is definitely well crafted,I will recommend it to any hop head lover, it is a little harsh for me, but you can buy it I think you will not be disappointed..."
"I finished this bomber in record time and it left me wanting more.. Thanks again to Joe for this great experience!"
"Aww, the Wench put a nice glow in my cheeks."
"Pours a clear darker amber color that's iced tea-like. She sports way better than a full finger foamy light yellow-hued tan head that resists fading. Visibly effervescent, the head is kept alive from beneath. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in it's wake. A bit more head and lace as things warm up, some 3D. This girl screams citrus grapefruit hop when you pop her cap. The smell is unbalanced towards the hops, but under that i get a toasted lager-like malty note. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied with a lighter texture that lends a bit to her drinkability. Full flavored, the hop and toasted malt taste combination is a winner. The whole thing lingers really nicely, but the 8% ABV is integrated well enough that 'multiples' are likely. Get yours on! Awesome effort from the good folks at Middle Ages. Cheers."
"Looking at the other reviews, maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, but if a beer claims to be ""screaming with hops", it's gotta deliver. The competition between hoppy beers is fierce, and Wailing Wench just doesn't cut it when compared to other offerings like Double Bastard and Old Ruffian. To a hophead like me, this was pretty weak."
"d: This is a very good beer, it's just not for me."
"This beer surprised me with how hoppy it was. Poured a cinnamon colored brown. Smelled of cloves, hops and spicy malt. Taste was dominated by a dry hop taste, with a little bit of sweetness sneaking in at the end. However, dry hops (that I would associate with a British style hop) dominated the taste. The alcohol was well hidden behind the hops. The mouthfeel was pretty thin for this type of beer, but a good beer overall."
"Clear dark mahogany with huge tan head and decent lace. Fruity sweet hops, grapefruit and cinnamon and apple and lemon aroma. Grapefruit and butterscotch explosion, smooth creamy with a share of alcohol. Tart bite on the tongue but solid malt character, lots of bitter sweetness. Quite drinkable for 8 abv. Excellent."
"This isn't a bad IIPA but the buttery character just seems to detract from the overall experience. I've got a bottle of Dragonslayer in the fridge, I hope the butter isn't a house characteristic of Middle Ages."
"Overall: This is a very hoppy bitter beer, although out of balance: If you like your beers straight up bitter and tannic tasting, you will like this one."
"The pint from the cask was fresh and the head retention was decent. Nice fresh hops in the nose, solid hop and barley taste with a nice clean bitterness at the end. A strong taste, but being on cast it was smooth and the mouthfeel was soft. An excellent solid strong ale."
"First off I will say that this beer is worth every penny. A little steep at 5 buck a 22 oz bottle, but it is the perfect blend of hoppy and malty beer. It has a deep red color perfect head retention and body. I made sure this was poured right into a pint glass at around 55 degrees to get the most of it. It is 8% percent alcohol,but it doesn't seem as strong as it is."
"Served at cellar temperature, in a pint glass, from a twenty-two ounce bottle. Pours a deep ruby amber color, that is quite dark. A somewhat vigorous pour yields a bubbly, soapy yet pillowy, beige colored head. Great head retention leaves thick rings of lace all the way down the glass. Great nose on this beer as well. Tons of hops hit the nose first, and then a quick rush of sweet malt. Huge plum and raisin aromas followed by a touch of oak, alcohol, and yeast. Aromas compliment eachother nicely. Taste is sugary sweet with a bitter hit of hops. Hops are knocked down a peg by a thick maltiness that lends the sweetness a hand. More of the dark dried fruits that were noted in the nose, show up in the flavor. Just a bit of the oakiness shows up as well. Alcohol is pretty well hidden but is there. Finishes very smooth with a decent amount of carbonation felt on the tongue and throat. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel is just a tad syrupy. Coats the mouth nicely. Pretty good drinkability here. This one deserves a 5 for the artwork alone."
"It's difficult to be subjective when it comes to reviewing my favorite beer from my favorite brewery, but I'll try my best. Currently on tap in a 5 gallon keg at home in my kegerator. Pours a gorgeous ruby color with hints of amber, very clear. Thick off-white head with lots of lacing. Aroma is intensely citrusy, again a combination of the hops (largely centenial I believe) and the ringwood yeast used at this brewery. Gentle round malt sweet in the beginning with an oily finish. Aftertaste again of citrus and hops with a nice crispness. Beautifully balanced beer that begs to be drank again and again, highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Just too many negatives here, between the fusel alcohol, the Ringwood yeast and the overcarbonation"
"D - Tastes like a combination of nosferatu and oaked bastard. I really enjoy that creamy orange, caramel, bready flavor."
"It's a sipper - something about it slows it down. Maybe it's from things going on that don't quite fit together. A solid brew nevertheless - bittersweet. Recommended for a slow drinking brew."
"D: Pretty darn good. Nice feel and flavors, a strong ale that's still easy to drink."
"Thanks BeerTruth!"
"Great brew, would look for this again and again."
"I've had this beer in many forms (bottle, on tap, and cask). If you ever get the chance to try it on cask then you have to. It is a great beer but the alcohol will definatly creep up on you if you're not careful."
"Edit: I dig the girl on the label though. I'm a sucker for redheads."
"This beer is pretty sticky for only having a medium body. And the CGI girl on the bottle is just a horrible piece of artwork. A hand drawn label would be much more attractive."
"I really found the taste to be the highlight of this beer. Has more hops on the palate than the nose. Tastes rather sweet at the start, caramel spread and toast, spices, fruity (raisins, plums?) and a good amount of hops make for a bitter citrusy finish. A good beer to have on a cool night."
"The drinkability is pretty good. The strong bitterness would limit the amount in one sitting."
"this ""wench"" can wail to her heart's content - and will get no complaints from me."
"Drinkability: Interesting flavor... a rather unique offering. This beer's bitterness has a better balance when comapred to an IPA. High alcohol content makes this a sipper though."
"D: Great balance, great flavors. I really enjoyed this one and would buy this again for sure."
"Pours a big off white head. Beer is a nice garnet hue. Smells of bread and floral hops. Taste is sweet malts and oily, floral and citrus hop flavors. Alcohol warms on the way down. Medium bodied with a nice full mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable but this beer would be best with cooler weather ( I am thinking fall). Big flavored well rounded beer. Glad I tried it. Thanks to beertruth for trading me this tasty beer."
"* near the end, I started to notice some chocolaty malt flavours more."
"D - At 8% abv, it's definitely not a session beer and the flavor leaves no doubt. It's a little smoother than a straight sipper, though. Two, *maybe* three pints would definitely not be out of the question, the 8% abv notwithstanding."
"Taste: High hop Beers are just fantastic on cask, the bitterness is sharp without going out of control and going harsh on you. I expected a little more body, but it's not like it was too thin either. The aftertaste is all crispy hops and builds momentum with every silky smooth sip. A very enjoyable pint!"
"Pours a very nice chestnut brown with a quite good head that sticks around as a cap throughout. Very good lacing as well. Very malty nose with quite a hit of alcohol. Fairly dry, and with some dark fruit and some sharp yeast. Taste is simarily dry with a bitter, earthy hop prsence throughout, and a fairly sharp astingency as well. It's bitter all right, but the hops are not all that pleasant. Mouthfeel is somewhat soft. Not slick, not creamy, just soft. Okay, alittle out of balance."
"Aggressive hoppiness here borders on the American barleywine and/or DIPA category but nicely enjoyable as an American strong ale."
"A dynamic and and flavorful Old Ale/Double IPA. My favorite Middle Ages offering and one of my favorites from any American brewery."
"This is a beer that really doesn't fit a standard ""style," and as such probably throws some people off who don't know what they're getting into. It's a phenomenal beer if you like hops, but if you don't, treat it as you'd treat an IPA."
"I must say I really like this beer. Beertruth included it as a surprise in a trade and I'm glad he did. It isn't very balanced and I may go as far as calling it a hopbomb, but that's perfectly fine in my book. I would also suggest letting this one warm up for half an hour or so before pouring it into the glass, the flavors of an ale of this strength come out much better at warmer temps. This is a top-notch brew and I wish I could buy it around here."
"Scott"
"Stunning chestnut color with a head that goes on forever. The whole way down the glass I need a spoon to dig thru the fluffy, tan goodness. Glad I have a mustache! Very deep floral and malty aromas. Not overly pronounced but very full and thick. Solid malt flavor with an extreme blast of hop bitterness and flavor. Nice resiny and earthy notes. Great caramel notes. Terriffic body. The resiny and slickness of the hops really comes thru on the palate. Very, very drinkable beer. Impressive."
"D-I always have trouble getting through a bomber wihtout help. But was good for a pint on tap at the blue tusk"
"One was enough for me to know it's not my cup of tea. Glad to have tried it though."
"Again, this seemed so much better in the tasting room, likely due to its at-the-source freshness, but letting it warm a little, and maybe letting it age longer should do a lot for it. As it is, it is very enjoyable and I look forward to trying it with some age on it."
"This is a good beer but the booze takes away from it.I think thats just common with the style.I wonder how this will taste aged a few months."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice two finger tannish head, tons of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is slightly sweet/bitter, malty, hoppy, grapefruit, and caramel. The taste is bitter, malty, hoppy, nice touch of grapefruit, and caramel. There is a slight dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, more of an IPA to me, but what do I know."
"Very drinkable, I could drink this all night, but the 8% abv might have me trying to score with the chick on the label."
"Drinkability: this is no way a session beer, but this beer beer you can easily drink but the well hidden alcohol can catch up to you. Find this one and give it a shot."
"Overall an excellent strong ale. Excellent complex hop, which is gently presented. Very quaffable."
"Thanks to BeerBeing for this and many other great brews!!!"
"A nice beer, but it didn't blow me away. Still, a quality stong ale that is pretty enjoyable."
"Very deep copper/light mahogany body topped by a thick, creamy, tan head. The head grudgingly fades, but it clings to the glass like an obsessive lover. Aroma has nice sweet notes, but it's dominated by hop perfume. Nice pine and floral notes abound. As for the flavor, bitterness runs rampant. Pine rosin, grapefruit rind, and herbal bitterness obscures most of the malt and alcohol sweetness. A bit of heat can be felt, but that's about it. Nice if you like hop juice, but really one-dimensional. Mouthfeel is a bit thick as expected. Drinkability is great for hop\heads. Not really a session beer or one that I'd even come close to calling ""quaffable", but enjoyable none the less. A solid offering for those who love hops, but the uninitiated may run from this beer 'wailing'."
"Mouthfeel is initially slick,but has a quick sparkle of carbonation following shortly afterward. Good beer, pretty drinkable for the big flavor and ABV."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a deep reddish copper with a generous inch of dense foam. Smells of perfumey, floral hops. Tastes of bitter floral hops and sweet dried prunes or raisins as well as some caramel malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. I would seek this one out again and it is rather reasonably priced for it's strength."
"The Wench was extremely well balanced -- despite the heavy fruit nose and initial taste, it ended a little drier and more bitter than sweet. If I didn't know it was a strong ale, or if I were a short stumble home, I would have happily ordered a second pint, and possibly a third. Made my entire night (and my extreme hangover the next morn) entirely worth it."
"Medium body with lighter carbonation. Some bitterness and alcohol in the swallow and aftertaste. Not bad...makes me want to search out another that may be fresher than this one to compare."
"Appearance - 4.0, Smell - 4.0, Taste - 3.5, Mouthfeel -4.0 , Drinkability - 4.0"
"If you love hops, this is for you. What can I say, I'm a hop head and I'm 5 minutes from the brewery, so I'm quite biased. Color is a dark amber with zesty citrus odors. Middles Ages offers this in bombers and on tap for growler fills but not in 12 oz. bottles. So far it's always been on tap at the brewery, whether it be for tastings or in the back room for fills. Definitely one of my favorite brews of all time, but if you're not much into hops I would avoid it. Drinkability is rough unless you enjoy a lot of hops and 8% ABV. At least try a sample it you're at the brewery or maybe Blue Tusk. I highly recommend it."
"I know some have complained about to much hops but that is never a complaint you will hear from me besides what did you expect with a name like Wailing Wench. The beer poured deep amber in coulor and head retention good leaving a nice lace in the glass. The aroma was a plesent piney zesty hopy one and the taste well what can I say I love hops. I have bought this beer before and even though it runs close to 4 bucks a bottel I keep comming back. Besides I like the label (its part of the experence)"
"Sorry, I'm just not this much of a hop-head. Pretty bottle though. . ."
"I bought this along with Druid Fluid because i'd heard that middle ages brewed a good beer. Poured dark fudge caramel brown with very little head. Alcohol and fairly strong buttery odor. the smell is kind of worrying....diactyl? Thick alco-malt flavor with lots of hop bitterness and oily-ness. some residual buttery flavor but this is swamped out to some extent by the large hop load in the beer. Its overall a bit unbalanced with the flavors not really coming together particularly well. Not really all that impressive of a beer but its certainly a big beer and not awful by any means."
"D: The abv is a little high, but the strong hop body makes for a pleasant pint."
"Hell yeah, Wench! Sorry it took me so long to find you."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a clear light brown color ale with a small foamy head with low retention. Aroma of citrus hops is dominating. The taste is also dominated by the citrus hops but is lacking in malt balance. Body is about average with no alcohol noticeable. This beer while lacking in malt balance IMO is still very enjoyable."
"Many thanks to dlee for this and many other fine beers and ales. You have a new friend indeed."
"Great drink. Hoppy but surprisingly smooth; bitter but kind of sweet. Gotta love this Wench."
"All in all good...could have been great with fresher, more distinct hops,."
"REALLY NICE! I wasn't expecting such a remarkably drinkable beer, but they've certainly pulled that off. Very nice!"
"D: Tasty, and not filling, but doesn’t go down as easy as I would like. However, it’s still a good beer."
"Song: Frank Sinatra's ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along"""
"I was surprised that this was classifed on BA as a strong ale and not an IPA. Has the buttery character associated with Ringwood. Fairly hoppy and smooth. Very good in a bottle but even better on draft. The Wench is a solid beer that I would recommend."
"This is one that you could drink for a while considering the ABV."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a darker brownish-amber color with a fairly large tan head. Definitely an aroma of hops: just not as much as I would have expected. Some pine seems to be on top. The taste seems a bit light for this tupe of beer. Smooth, but not as much bitterness as I would have expected or liked. Some dryness in the aftertaste. OK, but could be better."
"Pours to a frothy white head and dark amber color. Medium carbonation. Aroma is mostly citrusy American hops--not quite screaming but very bitchy. Flavor is what you would expect from an American IPA, and no flaws. Medium mouthfeel. This is a very easy to quaff brew. A solid wall of 4's."
"Recommended."
"Pours cola in color with a coppery hue and a decent size cream head that slowly fades back. There is a cola-y sweet aroma as well as a bitey piney hop smell. The beer is definitely hoppy with a good bite of piney peppery hops in the taste along with some malty sweetness that also shows a hint of citrus, although the hops seem to fall more on the pine side. A little bite of alcohol in the finish as well. Medium body and slightly thick on the palette from the malt sweetness. Definitely a hoppy experience however I thought that the sugary malts and the large hop bite do not seem to balance each other very well in the taste. Some good stuff going on here, just all seems to be competing for the stage."
"Pours a very dark red color, with a larger cream colored head that sticks very well, probably on account of all the hop oils in here. Hop aromas predominate, with some earthy and metallic notes at the forefront. Some chocolatey malt aromas poke through as well; it's a strange nose. The flavors on display here also defy easy categorization and they aren't necessarily pleasant. Quite metallic and bitter at the start; the flavors are thin and unbalanced, with a definite emphasis on the hops at the expense of the malt. Mouthfeel is on the thin side. I don't find this to be terribly drinkable, as the flavors are not really that interesting, even though the gravity is thin enough to promote drinkability under normal conditions."
"I was surprised to see that this is concidered a strong ale. It's strong but I was sure it would be an APA. I guess I still have a lot to learn about my new IPA/APA experimentation."
"($5.50 / Pint)"
"In passing, I would like to say that as a dyed-in-the-wool Arrogant Bastard fan, this is a great beer that is very much like AB, but much less bitter, less in your face, and more drinkable. I highly reccomend this beer."
"My neighbor gave me this for letting him park his truck in my driveway. The beer had a deep clear amber color with a large sticky off white head. The nose was big and malty with hops on top, caramel, coffee, some roasted malt and piney earthy hops. The taste reminded me of Scotch ale with more hops, malty flavors - caramel, toffee with a very nice earthy hop bitterness at the end. The mouth was light-medium; I was expecting a bit chewier."
"i'm not diggin this beer. smells liks butter, weak flavor characteristics, thin. if Nosferatu and Hibernation ale are my benchmarks with which to judge this one, not even close"
"This is a decent strong ale that grows on you. It seems less hoppy than the last time I enjoyed it. I love Middle Ages labels and themes but I'm not so sure about their quality control and consistency."
"D - for the style it is definitly drinkable. I enjoy it all the time."
"Flavor is a surprising burst of hops after such a subtle aroma. Lots of hops up front give a floral burst but it is all followed by a sweet and creamy caramel. The hops linger around the edges of the tongue. Kind of a wood flavor in this beer too. Full body that actually improved aas the beer warmed. Definitely a nice beer, only wishing I had sampled this one sooner."
"This beer poured a wonderful dark ruby color with a 1/4 inch creamy head. Aroma was very malty with some nutty aromas and spicy hops in the nose. Taste was malty sweet and caramelly with a pleasing hop bitterness in the finish. I also picked up some flavors of cherry, toffee and vanilla. For a medium bodied beer it was very easy to drink with the alcohol being very well hidden. A very nice example of a strong ale that hopefully will make it's way down to my neck of the woods. Recommended if you don't mind beers on the sweeter side."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A smooth, slick, rolling, perfectly effervescent beer in the mouth. Absolutely spot on for this style. So well done that I can't wait to pin this against Arrogant Bastard in a tasting."
"The overpowering richness of this beer might be a bit much for more than a few of these but I'll still say this was a drinkable beer."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"I thought the aroma and taste were a bit muted in this beer. Overall, it's a decent brew, but I thought it could use a little more character."
"Comments: I enjoyed this beer & am a fan of the style. I've had better, but still enjoyable. The one downside was the overly bitter aftertase which remained longer than I would have preferred."
"A very drinkable beer for Strong Ale. 8% is perfect if you decide to go on the heavier side. Highly recommend this one, if you can find it."
"Drinkability is really very good. This brew makes a great sipper. I will want more!"
"Pours with a thick sand colored head of small bubbles that builds and the deconstructs itself leaving sheets of lacing down the glass. Rich smoked amber with no visible carbonation streams. Full of citrus and pine in the nose with sweet caramel and toffee underneath. The taste is rich and fruity with a caramel sweetness. Tart and slightly dry in the finish with a citrus rind sharpness pulling at the margins. There is a slight mustiness underneath which works to balance the bright hop finish. No hint of the 8% alcohol. There is a long and lingering sweet citrus finish. Full bodied with a slightly heavy mouthfeel, the fine carbonation works to lift the weight. An easy drinker with a nice bouquet of hops, this one was a pleasure."
"Nice distinct flavor, and lots of it, without going overboard on any one aspect."
"One of my favorites from Middle Ages. Ringwood yeast is present, of course, and it works quite well with this beer. Lots and lots of delicious hop flavors. Damn drinkable too for its strength."
"A tasty awesome treat for the senses."
"I will drink this again, if for nothing else to rejudge."
"Nice sharp hoppyness on the front, warm mouth feel, finish was slightly carmel. Very round and smooth. Very drinkable for the hoppy yumyum of a double IPA. Not as aggressive as some in this class."
"It was good, but a little too fruity and thick for my tastes. but, I may like this more in colder weather, it has that warming, thick quality."
"Update 6/9/06: Shared a bottle with a friend and wished I had more. The english hops rule in this beer, so much so that I'd call it a double english-IPA. Unlike any other DIPA or stong ale I've had."
"Cheers!"
"Acquired in a trade with JahNoth, and cellared since then (early December?)."
"An interesting beer to say the least. An ale that accents fruity hops and sweetness."
"Woodsy hop aroma, raw, bursting and resinous, minty and clean, with hints of pine and lemon, while the malt is reminiscent of many East Coast hoppy beers; sweet malts, with hints of berries and caramel, jolly ranchers, seemingly covered in sugars and light alcohol. Sweet and sugary, salty, bitter and alcoholic, with a bursting and extreme amount of juicy, oily hops, which seems to be in an English, herbaceous type way. The malt is juicy and full. A very good beer."
"Got this bottle as a wedding present from wrxbeerwagon and chaduvel. Thanks guys! Dark garnet. Clear body with a sticky finger of creamy, light khaki head. Awesome label. Nose of toffee and butterscotch backbone. Big sappy, yet floral hops. Bitter and numbing, but with some alcohol. Taste is sweet and rich toffee malt up front. Quickly gives way to big hops: pine pitch, sap, resin, yum. Tongue gets numb as hop bitterness stabs crazily. Complex, warming rummy alcohol leads an otherwise, mostly bitter (sappy) finish. Could be a little more cohesive perhaps. Full-bodied, oily, and finally creamy, feel. Mouth numbing and intoxicating."
"It's big and even better, it's well composed. This girl can sing."
"Even though this score isn't exactly the greatest, I still liked this beer. It's just that it isn't very attractive in any one category."
"Wench pours an impressive deep mahogany with a generous mocha colored head, rich and chunky. The nose is of fresh spruce, juniper and Maine White Pine resin with a hint of ferrous. The taste is rich and viscous, coating the mouth with a sweet maltiness, then offset by the onslaught of hops bringing this brew into balance in a big way. The moderately roasted malts par well with the hops selected to create this brew and a nice stickiness is in attendance finishing short of sweet; ample hopping keeping this well balanced. The mouthfeel is nicely oily and smooth, rich and bold; hops again keep all elements in check. The taste of this great brew lasts for several minutes; drinkability is very good considering the concentration and volume of this beer. This is a very impressive offering from a brewer who seems to have their finger on the pulse of what we want. Yes, we want a wailing wench!"
"The finish is a headlock of hops, that has a background of sweetness complimented again with a sharp bitterness that laces the throat with a smackdown. Fantastic brew, I love the complexity in this ale. I paired this beer with my dessert, chocolate dipped strawberries. The hoppy bitterness in the ale really cut through the sweetness in the strawberries and the roasted chocolate flavor in the beer really complimented the bittersweet chocolate."
"M & D: Mouthfeel changes quite quickly on this beer as the flavors go from hoppy to malty to bitter very quickly. Full bodied and screaming with hops is a good assessment--No wonder its on the label! Drinkability is pretty nice on this wench if you like a strong full bodied ale with a bunch of hops and a bitter ending."
"Rich amber color with traces of crimson. About a finger of fluffy off-white head that left behind a little lacing. Citrusy aroma with a little pineapple. Flavor is full of bright citrusy, grapefruity hops though there is a good malt background. Kinda reminds me a Four Peaks Hop Knot, a local favorite. Rich and creamy mouthfeel with nice carbonation. This one might go down a little too easy for its strength!"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and moderately carbonated."
"873"
"It's an interesting brew, but maybe not my cup of tea (or glass of beer?)."
"Drinkability- Can't even tell the abv in this one. Super easy to drink. Tasty. Thanks for the bottle Lostbearbrew!"
"D- Big time fall / winter ale. Sipping brew all the way. Warming and flavorful and a easy paring with some mild goat cheddar."
"This is one outstanding brew. Wonderful combination of flavors; great hoppiness, perfect malt backbone, nice spiciness, and well hidden alcohol. Highly recommended."
"This reminds me of extreme beers. Not much balance here, but the flavor is explosive in a balanced way. You want malt, here it be. The hops are lip puckeringly present. Smooth, this isn't, but flavorful it is to the n-th degree."
"22 oz. bomber. Dark, overbrewed tea appearance with minimal, dense head. Aromas are of pine and citrus hops with that familiar Ringwood yeast Middle Ages loves to use. Initially very bitter, with a heavy mineral flavor -- almost overwhelming -- with some roasty coffee malt at the very tail end. Hops predominate with bitter, bitter grapefruit which all but entirely cloaks a bready malt structure. The mouthfeel is full and chewy. Alcohol (8%) is barely perceptible underneath all those massive flavors. This is a big beer, probably the most complex offering I've sampled from Middle Ages. Interesting in that I mostly detect the Ringwood in the nose and in the otherwise hoppy burps. Drinkability...not sure yet. I think I'll wait a while before picking up another, but this certainly has piqued my interest, and I'll have no problem finishing the bottle."
"Wow, this is a damn good beer. I feel bad saying this reminds me of Stone's AB, but it really does. A little more fruity in the hop character and not such a compact malt, but... yeah... very good."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Hoppy nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with some sweetness finish is hoppy/malty with some bitter aftertaste. There are better double IPAs like Stoudts. $4.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, deep ruby-amber color with a frothy light tan colored head. At first in the aroma I get sharp notes of pine and then the diacetyl kicks in. The beer is quite light on the palate, at least from what I was expecting. There is a light sweetness to this beer, which off-plays the sharp pine-notes, grapefruit, and tangerine. The diacetyl definitely is quite present in the taste, it especially lingers a long time in the finish. This is like chewing on a butter soaked mix of pine and citrus. I can't say that it is without merit though; the ample hop rate does help to mitigate the diacetyl dominance, except perhaps in the finish. This beer is quite a conundrum, at times I find it drinkable, yet at others I want to pour it down the sink. Thus the score neither captures the depths or the heights that this beer gets to."
"Flavors run the gamut. Initially sweet balanced by a thick, burnt malt profile. Hardcore grapefruit juice flavor; a bit like drinking malty, boozy grapefruit juice. Okay not really, but you get the idea. Rounded bitterness in the finish. I remember the cask version being much hoppier. This is well balanced by actually leans towards being thick and malty in my opinion. I find this to be heading towards barleywine country. A rich malty brew...a true ""big"" beer at that. Nice."
"I ended up giving the rest to my friend who said he barely noticed it (the harsh vodka flavor) and thought it was good. My wife also thought it was OK, so Im thinking it was a good sample, just not something I enjoy in a IIPA. Would like to taste some bottled so I can age it slightly. Maybe the vodka would die down with age?"
"Overall I was expecting better from a highly rated beer and brewery. Perhaps it is personal taste, but I like a DIPA to be a step between IPA and Barleywine family (juicier & fruitier than IPA, but not all the way to a thick sipping beer like barleywine). I cant argue that it is a highly hopped beer, it just lacks any inspiration of artistry in its construction. There is no complexity to its flavors and it lacks that juicy, hoppy chewiness that I love oh so much. I would call this average at best, and for the same price I can enjoy beautiful examples of the style like Maharaja, Big A, and Hercules. Given the high rating this beer holds I would certainly be willing to try again as I may have just tried a bad batch, but something tells me it just isnt a great DIPA."
"Beer is good. Happy hoppy regional beering."
"Thanks to lostbearbrew for the chance to wail!"
"Overall = Highly recommended for Double IPA or ESB fans. I would certainly drink another if it comes across my path."
"Man, I had to work through this brew with some effort. I pretty much detest butterscotch and the butteriness that dripped from this beer made it profoundly disappointing."
"Pours a two and a half dark tan head over a crystal clear red-brown liquid. Smells hoppy citrus/pine, caramel, chocolate, toffee, vanilla, alcohol. Buttery. Dark, almost oaky, smell. Intriguing. Tastes unlike any other IPA I've ever had. Hops are light compared to most IPAs. They taste mostly piney with some citrus character. Bitter is gentle, but seems more because of an acrid sting from carbonation and a sour tang. What's that sour tang?...it's caramelly, but it's as if the caramel was left in the sun and spoiled in some way. Maybe like the sugar and oils separated. Butterscotch, bordering on flat out butter. A little bit mediciney. Wet sugary sweet finish with an underlying grassy co-humulone hop roughness. This beer is balanced mostly toward the malt, but the hop flavor and bitter are noticable and keep the beer interesting. Md body but slick and buttery in the mouth. The oily feel just hangs there and keeps the flavor hanging around. Moderately carbonated with amazing lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. No overpowingly alcoholic, and all flavors and aromas are balanced well. One I'll go back to indeed."
"Pours a ruby red/brown, clear and with a big off white head, good lacing. Smell is very citrusy, piney, nice malt, light floral hoppiness, some malty sweetness. Taste is very strong deep malt, piney and floral middle, some alcohol and a clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is low, very warming, bitter burn in the finish. Very tasty beer. Thanks DrJay."
"Clear, deep ruby red with a big, fluffy, light tan head. Excellent lacing and very good head retention. Strong citrus/grapefruit and pine hop aroma with plenty of malt for balance. Pronounced bitterness with a full malt backbone. Caramel sweetness, pine and citrusy hops round out the flavour. Finishes on the dry side with a lingering bitterness and a hint of alcohol warmth. Smooth carbonation, a little on the low side, which makes it very easy to drink. A bit creamy as well. Great beer with lots of hops, but malt balance keeps it in check. A definite winner."
"A dark amber, nearly brown beer. Has a big creamy beige head with a good lace. The aroma starts with a somewhat fruity sweetness followed by a pungent grapefruit hop background. At first the hops bite your tongue. Then a smooth roasted malt charater slides thru followed by a dry grapefruit hop bitterness. Yum."
"Wave of lush flavours. A touch of biscuity malt, some great fruit & tons of American hops. Full bodied, moderate carbonation. Delightful."
"Appearance is perfect - clear ruby with a long lasting cream colored head and great lacing. Smell is interesting. Ringwood yeast is there. It has a very winey smell as well - don't know if this bottle is still good, but it's all I've got, so I'll rereview it if it turns out I have a bad bottle. The taste is sweet caramel and buttery up front, with some very strong bittering hops in the finish. The wine from the smell is completely gone. Alcohol and medicinal aspect is very noticeable, which knocks it down a couple notches. The mouthfeel stands out in this beer - it has that nice smooth creaminess that I look for in a Double IPA. Overall, I started liking this more and more as I finished the bottle, and maybe I'm being unfair because I'm not used to English IPAs, but it just seems kind of weird to me. Not something that I would crave for sure."
"Finger licking good."
"22 ounce bottle purchased at Green's on Ponce de Leon in Atlanta, GA."
"I want to drink this beer again, I bet the next time I have it I will like it more. But the fact I really want to try this beer again speaks to its wantability, which in my mind is better then drinkability. The palate might not have jived (totally) with me today. Still it was a good quaff. Thank you shippos for adding this bomber to the Secret Bunny Exchange."
"Id been sitting on this bottle for a short time, and wasnt particularly excited about it. I should have beenthis is phenomenal stuff. I suppose the label, with its renaissance-style redhead is worth noting. Pours a mahogany color with a creamy white head. Floral and strong hops smell (resin-like American hops) thats fairly well balanced with a sweet malt aroma. From the first taste, a serious grapefruit and pine flavor springs forward. Theyre tempered by a caramel sweetness and an almost tangy aftertaste. Its not a dry beer, and that really helps balance things. Rather full bodied and very easy to drink."
"Has to be one of the most drinkable IIPA's I have tried to date...gets better and better as it warms up."
"Wailing Wench definitely does not 'scream with hops' as the fetching, cleavage intensive, redheaded serving wench on the label claims. If it did, I'd like it more than I do. As noted, it's still good stuff and I'll have fond memories once it's gone. Thanks to HappyHourHero for the bomber."
"Big top, three ring circus of rivers hydraulic head that settles with a circular Petri dish of lace. Glowing mahogany hue with total clarity and yet possessing an odd thickness with no action. Real kind hop juice green on nose with a mossy alcohol present and a very light butterscotch. Hop bitter hits right from the get-go on the mouth followed by a mix of tart lemon zest, cinnamon earthiness, and light woody characteristics. In a style that still seeks to define itself, this is more than a fine example."
"pours a beautiful dark brown rubyish with dissipating head. smells hoppy with mild citrus and outdoor earthy notes. appearance is great. taste hits first with hops, the double ipa thing. continues with a belgianesque sweetness and dark fruit sourness which confuses the style. unique for a double ipa... leaves a real smoky aftertaste that rounds out an odd, different brew."
"Was able to try this brew on cask last evening. Funny thing is, the first time I ever had this brew was last week and then I find it on cask! Brew was poured to a amber color, had pretty good clarity and a nice sized tan/white head that had good retention. The aromas seem to be similar to the bottled offering. Definite hop aromas, more pine than citrus but they are both there. Over all it is a real nice aromatic brew. The brew has a dominant hop taste that really comes out about midway through and leaves a hop feel on your tongue for a while. Can notice some malt like characteristics but it seems to come and go quickly once the hop taste hits. Over all it is very good, but think I liked the bottled version a bit more. A beer I would get in an instance at any time!"
"I am sampling a room temp 22 oz bottle in a snifter/chalice. THe beer pours a deep chestnut color, much darker than I expected upon opening the bottle. A fluffy off white head foams up 1 cm and floats effortlessly on the surface. The head fades gradually to a thin surface layer that remains throughout sampling. Aroma is a complex mix of hops: pine, grass, and mostly grapefruity citrus scents. The first sip reveals a creamy texture and fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is briefly toffee and some dark fruit (plums) but this is quickly overwhelmed by piney and grapefruit hops. Now the hops are strong, but not burn your tongue strong, so dont expect it. I think the hops are just about perfect strength, and dont make the beer overly bitter,but I am not a hophead either. Very smooth brew that is easy to drink. No hint of the abv anywhere."
"Thanks to HappyHourHero for this one too."
"taste: smooth, easy-drinking, with a medium body, and a long, soft, fruity finish. I'm not getting the hops I expected, though...they aren't screaming in my mouth, that's for sure. Perhaps the ringwood yeast has taken over this beer? Just doesn't taste much like an IPA at all. the 8% listed on the label doesn't stand out in the least. As a tasty, smooth English-style ale, yeah, it's got it going on...but as a wild, bellowing hop monster, it doesn't cut it...at least not this bottle."
"Pours a dark red color, looks much like the Druid Fluid I had yesterday. Nice white greamy head. This beer seems to radiate with hops, ju solid tangy floral wall when you get any where near the glass. Taste is all over the place with hops bitterness, but I believe it is missing somesweetness, a very dry, somewhat smokey/sour DIPA. If it cut back on these flavors I believe this has the stength and the hotness of the chick on the label to be an elite DIPA. Still very good, and I thank Southernbrew for the final beer from his wonderful Georgia sampler."
"Drinkability is good. Very interesting take on the style. Ringwood stands out in a very good way with this beer."
"There's a very nice body here along with a smooth, creamy taste that goes down easily. I could have a couple of bombers of this on the weekend and be content. Kudos to Middle Ages and to dmeadows for allowing me the opportunity to sample this one."
"Over all WW is a superb beer. A triumph for Middle Ages. It easily ranks in my top 20 bottled and top 10 on cask. Seek this beer out."
"Thanks to shippos for bringing this one my way. 22oz bottle with an attractive and busty wench on the front. Nice. Pours a darker color than expected. It's almost a standard brown/amber color. Has a tall head that has good retention and leaves a nice amount of lacing behind on the glass. Huge aroma. The aroma is very mostly a grapefruity hop aroma, but there is a bit of malt hiding back there too. The flavor is not nearly as hoppy strong as the aroma would suggest. It's surprisingly well balanced as the malty goodness was hiding in the aroma, but it's right there in the flavor. The hop flavor adds a citrus/grapefruit feel to things and it finishes strong. Very well made. Drinkability is great for a Double IPA. Mouthfeel is right where it should be. No trace of the 9% alcohol."
"Thanks to shippos and clvand0 for the opportunity to share this beer. This pours a very deep rubied amber color, almost brown, but not quite, with a big-ass 2 finger head that falls very slowly. Holy crap. The nose on this one is gigantic. Tons of sweet grapefruit but with a very big malt sweetness as well. Wow, this smells great. The flavor is not as big as the nose. The malt is actually a little bigger than the hop, and the hop comes through as more of a spicey and sweet than just the strait up citric grapefruit. I like it. Its a sweet, malty beer but also a nice hoppy beer. I find it balanced. The feel is moderate to thick, very smooth. This is a damn nice beer. No hint of the 9% ABV anywhere at all in this one. Wow, this is worth finding."
"A well done double IPA. The balance is very even, allowing a solid drinkability, despite it's 8% strength. The hop profile is excellent, featuring the sticky pine sap flavor I've come to love in american grown varieties, namely amarillo. I love the fact that you can actually taste the malt all the way through, despite the hop attack. I'd certainly buy another bottle, maybe even a case to last until the next batch comes out."
"Anyway. Strange color for an IPA: red-brown with a thin, tan head. An amazing combination of floral and fruit notes in the nose and flavor--cherry, banana, grapefruit, strawberry, mango are the strongest, in that order. Pretty even-handed, in that the taste matches the scents. Smells a bit more hoppy-sweet, tastes more hoppy-bitter, but that's almost it. Excellent balance. I can see some pine and citrus now, an enjoyable fall-leaf flavor (and almost texture!) Smells delicious and backs it up. The bitters are fantastic, very smooth and manage to be biting without being harsh. I think the malt is muted (as it should be for the style), but it's a theory that the smoothness of the brew comes from malt. A very very good example of the style, definitely meant to be savored, and ideal in a larger-than-12oz serving."
"Sampled on 1/14/05 from a 22 oz buxom bomber bottle courtesy of slander. Pours out extremely dark amber with a tall tan head. The only Double IPA I can remember being this dark or darker was Gordon. Decent lacing and head retention on this one. Strong citric hoppiness with an almost equally strong sweet maltiness fills the aroma. There is an odd aroma I cant quite place that is pretty strong, Ringwood maybe? Flavor started a bit bitter with hops and somewhat buttery. The odd aroma seemed to be in the flavor as well which makes it a bit interesting. A good amount of malty sweetness is present too. The hoppiness seems a bit too muted for the style, while its there and pleasant its not quite the kick I would hope for. Mouthfeel is and medium with a slight bitter prickliness. Drinkability was ok as well. A pretty solid beer all around but not my cup of tea for a double IPA."
"This one is a very dark ruby with a sizeable khaki milk foam of a head. Really gorgeous this one. The aroma is heavily perfumed with lemon pepper and grass hops that tingle the nose. Beneath that is a warm maltiness mingling with alcohol and that butterscotch house character of Middle Ages. The flavor is sweet, but not cloying, balanced by a good bitterness from the hops. I dont know if Id call it a Double IPA, but its a very good American Strong Ale."
"While style appropriate, the taste is a bit bitter for my liking. A roasted astringency helps round out the bitterness and make it unique. Impressions of scorched sugar and creamy, frothy egg whites in the flavor and mouthfeel make this beer more interesting than others in its style that I've had. Surprisingly drinkable for something this bitter."
"OK, no sweet citrusy hops in the mouth. Well, maybe a little. But mostly this is just powerful bitingly bitter hops. The malt comes in late with some smoky caramel maltiness to provide a bit of balance. But really, who are we kidding? This is a tribute to hops and the hops shine though beautifully. Not that balanced really. A bitter hops aftertaste that lingers forever. I can lick my cheeks and still get the oily hops off with my tongue. Pretty drinkable if you like the hops. Right up there with Ruination IMFO."
"Pours a nice dark chestnut with a very impressive rocky and creamy tan head that persists steadfastly throughout the drink and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The smell starts with potent, fragrant, and fresh hops blended with plenty of balancing grainy and slightly toasted malts. Flavors start with a strong, but not overwhelming, hop kick. The hops are quickly and nicely balanced by strong toasty malts, yeastiness, and slight fruitiness, however. A masterful blend of hop and malts in my opinion. Mouth-feel is a touch heavy for an IPA, but the brew remains extremely drinkable due to it's well-balanced and refreshing flavors. I could easily have consumed the whole 750 ml bottle before noticing the strength of this excellent double IPA."
"Mouth feel is decent, somewhere in between thin and medium, not oily typical of many I2PAs. Flavor lingers for a bit. Drinkability is decent as well due to the balanced nature."
"Thanks to my mother in law bringing down some NY beers from Buffalo just in time for the Rose Bowl,anyways what a pour deep amber with a huge fluffy head that takes its time to settle leaving globs of lace.Aromas of citrius,pine and some butteriness in there,pretty well rounded.Big citruisy hop flavor up front but there is some great balance with a lightly sweet maltiness that kicks in late to make this a hop accented brew with a huge maltiness that almost keeps up.Mouthfeel is very creamy and how drinkable for 9% I have it nearly gone in less than ten minutes.I have been drinking a few west coast IPA's and hop tilted brews and this east coaster is the best in my opinion."
"This is a tough beer to call. I like the idea of lots of hops and ringwood, but there was something that kept it from being truly great."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1 1/2"" creamy dark tan head, which laces nicely. A deeply orange-copper hued brew, with slightly buttery hoppy aroma, with ample malt sweetness. Taste is Ringwood and sweet malts, with hoppy notes, but not ""screaming," which is what the bottles says. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent for the style, would advise trying. However, if you have a big Ringwood aversion, and don't plan on giving this a chance, don't waste your money."
"A little disappointing considering how far from the extreme bleeding edge this double IPA stands. A conservative and approachable East Coast take on the style."
"Bomber bottle, no freshness dating to be found. Pours a heady shade of dark auburn, quite clear, raising a tan head. This leaves a lot of stringy lace as well as sheets of lacing. Sweat, malty and resiny nose. So far so good! medium bodied. Creamy, buttery mouthfeel. Notes of vanilla, maple, leather, just a wee bit thin on the malt, but comes through with a resiny, pine finish. Strong, flavorful, complex and well crafted ale. Well worth seeking out."
" The aroma on this beer is indeed screaming with hops as loud as it can, it reeks of fresh juicy hops, and it has a lot more to offer too. Nice caramel and plum in the nose along with the dripping pine sap and citrus. Body is best described as medium bordering on the low end of strong ale heavy, perfect carbonation. Taste is a whirlwind of hop flavors, like a juicy navel orange soaked in spruce sap. Then something remarkable happens as the flavor makes a smooth but very definite transition to a sweet, fruit and nut bread malty middle. Finish wrapped up clean and dry as can be, just bitter enough to make you grab for the glass again as quick as your reflexes allow. Superbly crafted beer this one, eminently drinkable, I can only imagine the wonder it would be on tap."
"This is a very good Double/Imperial IPA from my fine friends at MA. This brew is dark amber/red/brown with a nice head of khaki foam. The aromas are of heavy, caramel malts, ringwood yeast notes, HOPS, fresh baked breads, and more. The taste is very malty and hoppy in a nice unison. The hops hit hard up front, but the malt backbone is very, very strong as well with a very pronounced biscuit flavor in the mix. The finish is leafy, and raw, ie: awesome. The mouthfeel is quite thick, but not OTT and the drinkability is very good. An interesting, and quite awesome Double IPA with that distinctive ringwood fruitiness blending perfectly with those distinctive PACNW hops."
"Anyway, moving on- The beer is of a high quality indeed. I was very impressed. It was a dark amber colour, almost like very weak, watered-down coffee actually. Darker than I'm used to for an IPA. It had a good sized fluffy slightly off-white head that didn't last too too long. It smelled like a big hop festival, almost stinging my nose. Also it smelled a bit bready maybe actually.. yes. Tasted oh so good, the hops were very much there, but not in your face. It was as though I was drinking a buttery dinner roll along with a side of fresh green hops. No real trace of the alcohol, and I know it's definitely in there.. Very very tasty. Mouthfeel was very slippery and soft swirling about my tongue and sliding down my throat. Drinkability is high- very drinkable, but this wench of a beer would whip your ass if left alone in the room with you, so you better watch out with her."
"Had about two years later on cask and got juicy grapefruit hops in taste and aroma. Nice darker colour."
"pours a nice dark amber colour with a moderate light tan head on top. this has to be one of the darkest ipa's (double or otherwise) that i can recall seeing. very nice. the smell is of hops galore. there are earth/dirt scents scattered throughout and a hop sweetness that is present as well. nice and strong without overpowering. reminds me of the scent of an old baseball glove. the flavour starts off nice and sweet and is quickly attacked by hops from every angle. there's a dirty earth/roasted malt finish that's dry and tasty. sweet hop burps with some pine needle notes come out shortly thereafter. some have noted caramel. i didn't catch it at all in the flavour or the smell. oh, well. it's still damn good. this one's @ 9% abv so be careful, as the alcohol is not noticeable at all in the flavour. i'd definitely try this one again. a nice first offering from middle ages for me."
"These guys... does anyone else do this much this well with the Ringwood yeast???"
"Wailing wench, I am in love with you, you naughty and nasty girl."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick off-white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice malty scent surrounded by an intense floral hop arrangement. The Ringwood yeast adds a fruity aroma that helps balance the malts and hops. The taste is good. It is rich in malt complexity and piney hop flavor. It is really bitter, but finishes strong and goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks well. It has tremendous flavor and complexity. I love this brew!"
"Man, when does the hop worship ever stop? This was a rough assault on the palate. Malty sweetness in the background, but the overpowering aroma and taste was pure hop goodness. Color was reddish in a dark bar, but very very attractive. The taste was hoppy, and slightly astringent and roasty, but ultimately, with a big, bold hop flavor. Great mouthfeel, as the taste just takes over your mouth and coats it. I would probably end the night on this one (as I did last night), because the intensity of the hops and the high abv leave one with such a warm feeling."
" hats of to tim butler and middle ages brewery for brewing a big hoppy beer thats not just about being bitter!"
"A nice full mouthfeel, its drinkable enough but mainly hop and roasty bitter with little hop flavor. A great malt base though, its an interesting take on Imperial IPA. Seems to be much better on cask than draught, which doesn't surprise me at all."
"Wench beats the Bastard anyday...great brew..."
"I am in love. Her name is Wailing Wench."
" Definately worth a try."
"Poured a deep chestnut color with currant red around the edges and a tan head. Smell was very hoppy and definitely the resinous, pine cone hop variety. Tons of forest pine smell and just a hint of malts streaking the back of the nose. Taste was a hop heads wet dream. So much hops I couldn't even fathom it. These were not the citrus variety. Straight pine. There was considerable malt backbone as well especially as it warmed. Tons of esters towards the bottom fo the glass as it took on some more doughy and malt driven flavors. The carbonations was a little much at the beginning but as it warmed up it settled down a bit. Wailing Wench was a pretty good beer, but I think it could do with a bit of mellowing and melding as the flavors were very distinct and did not act together. It was hops at the beginning and malts at the end. A little more togetherness would make this beer a lot better. Also a warning, the amount of hops destroyed my pallete so don't plan on tasting anything for another 2 hours."
"Drinkabilty: Here's where personal preference rears its ugly head. I'm not a big fan of the Imperial IPA, so I wouldn't head right back for 2nd's. But I enjoyed 1st's just fine."
"Backwash: I had been anticipating trying this beer for more than a week, when I finally got to try it. Maybe nothing could overcome such anticipation. It reminded me a bit of a bigger version of the DFH 60 Minute (and no, I dont think thats the 90 Minute) with a slight diacetyl note. It seemed thin and a bit unbalanced. In its defense, it was also very green, which may have affected its drinkability. For those hopfiends out there, this may be perfect for you. It was the hoppiest beer Ive ever had, and a bit too extreme for me. I look forward to giving this another try."
"My understanding is that this brew has a limited availability."
"Poured from a growler 6 hours after it was filled, right into a Middle Ages pint glass. It reaks of hops and I love it!!! There's a little citrus hop aroma mixed in with the normal Middle Ages yeast smell (Ringwood). It poured a nice dark tan head that soon became one with the beer. She's a pretty dark Imperial IPA, deep mahogany in color. It's all hops baby (best Dick Vitel impresion). The hop bitterness hits your tongue quickly but stops just short of going overboard. There's a certain sweetness to the hops which I'm guessing comes from the combined taste of the Ringwood yeast and the barley used. Definitely a quality IIPA, gonna have to try this one on cask. I bet it would be even better after a short aging. Ah, what the hell do I know:-)"
