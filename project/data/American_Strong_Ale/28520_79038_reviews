"Great hop flavor with a good balance of maltiness."

"Had this on tap at The Holy Grail in Frisco. Tasted like cough medicine. Maybe it had gone bad but whatever it was, this was not at all what I had expected."

"One of those beers that has nothing particularly wrong with it, but doesn't have anything particularly right with it either."

"Very nice. Somewhat hoppy, but nice malt notes too, similar to a amber/red ale in that respect. Medium bodied. Nice taste. Terrific with my fish and chips. One of the best offerings in Texas."

"The ""must-have"" from this brewery!"

"This is the best stout I've ever had the chance to drink.  I'm a big fan of dark sweet beers and this is as good as it gets for me."

"great beer, Solid choice overall."
"Easy drinking at a local pub needs to clean their lines better."
"Similar to a blue moon with mild hops and good flavor."

"After drinking one below average Texas beers after another, I ordered ""the Velvet Hammer"".  Thank God for Texas breweries!"

"It is a flavorful beer with quite a lot going for it. The flavor definitely is a good one, but in a way that it changes as you drink it. Some beers have only one note. This is an exception. Enjoy!"

"A malty strong ale the has enough hops to balance it out. Plenty of alcohol showing but works well with all components. Glad I had a chance to try this."

"O: Strong offering from a local brewery. Creamy/smooth nature is very nice for the strong ale/stout category."

"(O)- This is a big favorite down here since you see it everywhere. Definitely seems like an imperial red ale meets the catch-all style of an american strong. Definitely an enjoyable malty treat."

"Overall: A decent offering that slants a bit too much on the sweet side for my palate, though I recognize that is a characteristic of the style"

"Overall, this is one of my favorite local brews these days. Big ups."

"Interesting imperial red ale, with a mellow mouth feel and a nice balance - it starts out hoppy but it is well balanced with the malt in the beer, and it leads to a surprisingly smooth experience. Finishes with a bit of an alcohol aftertaste, although not unpleasant by any means. I'd definitely get another one next time I'm there, and would highly recommend."
"This is my new favorite beer (until the next one). Had it a few times at various places around town. Color is reddish-orange with a slight haze. Aroma is a pungent piney-ness with a twist. I am very curious about the types of hops they have used in this brew. Good body and mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer despite its ""size"" (abv and OG). Good rich malty carmaelly flavor but not at the expense of the hops. I will be drinking this whenever I can. I'd love to see more of it from Peticolas. I can't wait to try their Scottish Ale."
"On tap at the Holy Grail Pub in Plano. The beer pours a hazy orange-brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of sweet caramel notes with some cherries and dark fruit, as well as a little bit of pine. The flavor is more of the same. I get some pine and orange notes from the hops, as well as some caramel and cherries. The alcohol is definitely present, but doesnâ€™t hinder the drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
