4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a ruddy mahogany color with a soapy head and plenty of lace. Aroma is fully malty and has just a kiss if smoke. Reminds me of the smell of a mild aged scotch but of course faintly. In the taste, malty with some piney, resinous hops providing expert balance. Toast, caramel, brown sugar and hops. Disguises the alcohol very well. Full bodied with a soft carbonation, wasnt pouring well but drank just fine. Overall this is a smooth American Strong Ale, can hit with the best of them.","Stinkypuss","Aug 05, 2014"

4.07,6.5,4.25,4,4,4.5,4,"Mellow spice in the hops with much attention devoted to a burnt sugar, caramel, semi-fruity malt. Earthiness builds in the middle with more hop flavor than bitterness, and enough of it to go around. A little bit more of that chocolate is going a long way. More than smacked by a blanket of kilned barley malt and dark fruit nuances. Pleasant with a subtle sweetness that I adore. Booze is not head-rearing, but steady and somber. It's a great drink for almost 9%. Carbonation is on-key, and the body is buttery and filled-out to great effect. Premium mouthfeel for an Imperial Amber. No points docked for style, either. Would order this over most strong ales and barleywines that meet near the middle of the Venn Diagram. Awesome.","thecheapies","May 21, 2014"

The aroma is citrus, a little fresh pine, molasses, sweet dark sugar, and slightly like sweet fruit punch (think about it, it's there). On the palate, a little more roasted barley character is present, with a good hit of lemon and a balanced bitterness. Not a lot of heat - though the alcohol heat is present - and overall a fairly rich, creamy body. Little lingering taste of chocolate, malt, and brown sugar. American Strong Ales are always such a mixed bag, this one comes close to being the American Ale equivalent of a Belgian Dubbel. Very much worth a try.","Groulxsome","Apr 10, 2013"

Color is a hazy to cloudy/opaque depending on width of the glass, amber brown. Aroma is an interesting heady mix of malt, yeast, hop, dark ripe fruit, leather, funk, hint of cocoa. Flavor's like nose, very slightly sweet, lots of bitter and good carbonic tang. Body is full, bitterness stands out on back of tongue, carbonation is just right.

This beer definitely is great if you're a malt lover. The taste was sweet and malty, more of a roasted malt, some sweet ripe fruit and a caramel kick to it as well. I personally hardly noticed the hops. Maybe the first few sips, but eventually the malt took over. Mouthfeel was fuller, but not too thick, very smooth and it leaves a nice slick feeling.

Poured into snifter glass. Appearance was a nice Amber Color with generous white head. Appearance however, is where the enjoyment ended for me. Smell was a very sharp earthiness of dry grass, leaves and twigs. Not a memorable scent. I could taste a little bit of caramel, but it was over shadowed by such a sharp hoppy bitterness and overburnt taste that I wasn't able to enjoy it. Maybe its the Strong Ale style that I am just not a fan of, but I just had trouble getting much enjoyment out of it. The mouthfeel had dry citrus/lemon with a hint of pine, but nothing memorable. I tasted way too much alcohol for my liking and not enough balance with the caramel and other fruit/earth flavors. Maybe it was too much carbonation. I don't know, but to me it lacked balance. I wasn't able to finish the 22oz bottle which is rare. I am by no means a American Strong Ale expert, but it was something I will not be trying again.

Not too heavy, but still a sipper. Medium to low carbonation, smooth feel to it. Pretty substantial hop character that's well integrated overall. Will pick this up again...","emerge077","Jul 20, 2010"

3.8,-0.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This brew pour brilliantly clear deep mahogany with a deep ruby hue and a thick, sticky tan head. The aroma is moderate-high citrus and piney hop and a medium-low sweet caramel malt aroma in the background. The flavor is quite complex, medium-high hop flavor, pine, citrus, and floral with moderate hop bitterness. Beneath the hops there is a moderate malt backbone -- malty caramel, a bit of burnt sugar and a hint of smoke. Carbonation is medium and body full. Overall a hoppy amber ale that is complex and hides its 8% ABV remarkably well.","uwmgdman","Mar 31, 2010"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Picked this up by random accident, label caught my eye, and picked up a sampler pack before and was pleased. Deep deep amber pour with a big billowy head. Big malts dominate this beer, didn't get that much hop balance, but not a problem. Boozy undertones remind you of the 8%.

4.35,13.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Murky looking crimson brown body. Thin and bubbly beige head. Lace etches my glass in nicely spaced rings. Aroma is piney and sprucy and brings out a spiked punch aspect to it as well, which I like in strong and old ales. I'll tell you what. This beer has got some character. Best beer I've had in a while from Lakefront. It's actually pretty subtle but complex. The pine and spruce are subtle and not overbearing in the least and mix nicely with the tropical fruit tones and underlying toffee/nougat malt base. Alcohol is detectable but only in trace amounts, which ain't too bad for an 8% beer. Body is hitting light-medium at best. And the carbonation is quite reserved. Very enjoyable beverage.","Bighuge","Dec 12, 2009"

It's quite sweet, almost cloying from the start, but the sweetness does not get worse, thankfully, and the character, plus light hoppy bitterness and the warm alcoholic spiciness moderate this a bit. However, it is still almost cloying, it's a bit rough, very thick and oily, and rather one-dimensional, the character strong and bold but lacking depth or complexity. The oiliness gets worse and becomes too slick and thick as it warms and a rough meatiness soon develops. It is somewhat enjoyable, but only in small amounts and it's very heavy.","Offa","Oct 09, 2009"

Whoa! A slightly aggressive pour results in a solid two inches of thick beige head that would make a rootbeer proud. After it settles the amount of sticky lace on my glass is just as impressive. The aroma is spicy malt and hops. Sort of peppery with a sweet fruit hint. The flavor is rich malt and bitter hop. The flavor is spicy as well. Caramel,sweet fruit,pepper,chocolate even a hint of coffee. The alcohol come through on the finish. Lots goin on here. Very flavorful and robust. Medium to full body. Plenty of carbonation. This is probably the most flamboyant beers I've ever had from Lakefront. This is a good thing. I'm sure I will run into this beer around town. Lucky for me.","beerwolf77","Aug 12, 2009"

3.95,3.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Aroma of a stronge pale ale - lots of spicy hop mixed with a good malt presence. Same with the quaff, with bits of doughy wood resin mixed in for good measure. Nothing strong ale about this one - it's a hop bomber, but a darn tasty one. 8% is well hidden, I'd have no problem recommending this one to try.

The aroma is a perfect balance of caramel malt and citrus hops. The problem is that it is very faint. The taste is a mirror image of the aroma; nice but faint. Honestly, from what I detect this beer is very simple so even if it were more pronounced I still don't think I'd like it much. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a texture that is a little thin and watery for the style. Overall, this is a beer that is truly lacking. It surely reinforces my previous conclusions that Lakefront brews really good lagers, and really poor ales.","KarlHungus","Jun 23, 2009"

The taste is rich and thick with malt, and quite creamy but not too sweet. Lots of piney hops followed by a touch of malty sweetness on the back end. A bit thick in the mouth but quite smooth. Big, and with lots of hops and a fair bit of alcohol, but it's all well supported by the malt.","Georgiabeer","Jun 14, 2009"

The aroma was a lot hopper than I was expecting, as the smell of resinous hops was unmistakable. The taste matched the smell with drying bitter hop taste evident up front. Backing this up were raisin like malts that was not too sweet. The body was soft and viscous and finish very dry and chalky. A nice strong ale I would love revisiting.","rajendra82","May 16, 2009"

Smooth, tasty, bald, complex and thoroughly enjoyable ASA. Lots of nutty malts, some wood/smoke, honey, and dark bread notes. Yum. A very nice, smooth and mellow take on the style.
