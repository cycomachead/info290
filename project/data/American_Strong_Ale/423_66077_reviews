"Everything I've tried from boulevard has been amazing. Except this. A truly mediocre drink from an otherwise outstanding company."
"A earthy/dirt like aroma followed by a thin ale that while hiding it's alcohol well, doesn't make sense with the lightly noticeable chocolate notes. A rare miss by Boulevard in their Smokestack series."
""
"This is a weird beer, I got no chocolate at all, I really didn't like it much at all, glad I didn't plunk down $19 for it"
""
""
""
"I think this would be better received under a different name. The chocolate is subtle, and fitting of the artisanal style that Elbow works in. If you're coming into this expecting Hershey's-type flavor, or what you get in popular chocolate-flavored stouts, you'll be at least somewhat disappointed."

"Overall: I truly dislike when a beer is billed as having a particular adjunct, and yet nothing of that adjunct can be found in the flavor. It feels like false advertising, even if said adjunct is actually in the beer. I'm also not a fan of expecting something sweet and getting hit in the tongue with a clod of wet, woody mud. Not a repeater."
""
"Not a fan. It just seems like the are trying to cover a poor base beer with some chocolate that doesn't really present itself in the bottle. The chocolate is more present on tap but still seems to miss the mark for me."
""
""
"great beer! however the chocolate is not there or to subtle for me. I enjoyed it but not sure it should be called a chocolate ale"
""
""
"Don't judge a book by its cover"
"Cocoa nose. Dark chocolate palate. Light color. Long finish. Medium heavy body."
"Liked this beer very much."
"Overall-Glad i tried it because I was so curious. But I really don't think I'll be buying anymore."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MF - Overall not too sweet and certainly smooth, but there is a blast on chocolate sweetness in the middle that for some might take away from the final herbal bitterness in the finish. 3.5"

"Strongly would not recommend, particularly if you like chocolate or stouts in general already."

"You taste the alcohol more this year vs last year. This is a smooth beer. Presents differently than a traditional chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
"I am drinking this on tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl. It pours a light, slightly hazy brownish amber with a thin white cap that leaves whore stocking lace. The nose is chocolate over light grains with some light sugars. It has a very intensely chocolate palate which is surprising for a beer this light colored.  It actually starts a little thin and grows in body and character as it moves over the tongue and finishes with lingering chocolate tastes. The chocolate is semi-sweet to a little more. Medium body and medium levels of fine soft carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Dark golden in color with a little head. Very fruity aroma. Fruity taste with a little sweetness & malty flavor. An ok beer."
""
"O - Really interesting.  A well executed take on a chocolate flavored beer."
""
""
"Not much else going on here and kind of a one trick pony.  Again, nice to see chocolate used in a different context but I didn't find the beer anything too special.  Definitely one to split unless you're really into chocolate/cocoa beers without a heavy malt presence."
""
"Chocolate isn't overwhelming. Amazing that it's an ale with the chocolate taste that it has! Phenomenal Beer!"

"O - This was a bit of a disappointment. The alcohol was more prominent than I like and the chocolate taste was kind of weak. I guess my expectations were off. I should have read reviews and been prepared."
""
""
"Corked caged bottle into tulip.  Nice amber brown color with fluffy head.  Fantastic chocolate Belgian aromas.  Flavor of chocolate, Belgian style trappist yeast, tobacco, really well balanced and unique.  A bit of an ommegang style going on here which is fine by me,  The chocolate is obvious but not over done.  Really perfect balance of flavors.  Great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was disappointed by this offering from Boulevard, which I was really looking forward to trying.  I just didn't taste the chocolate as much as I should have.  Reviews were pretty hit or miss, and I knew that before I bought it, but was hoping it would be more of a hit for me.  Oh well.  I'll try another Smokestack Series release eventually since most of the rest of them appear to have been more successful."

"I have never had a more interesting and conflicting beer. If this tasted anything like the aroma, it would have been a drain pour, yet the appearance, flavor, and mouthfeel all redeem this thing!. Being heralded as a chocolate ale, I was expecting a dark brown or black colored beer, so what appeared was surprise number 1. The smell really gave me the heebie-jeebies as it smelled nothing like I would expect for a chocolate ale and expected some kind of sour wine/vinegar flavored beer - surprise number two. Lo and behold! The flavor was exceptional smooth, soft, and subtly chocolate overall, nothing at all like what the aroma suggested - surprise number three!.  I can't get over the extremely weird smell, but with everything else considered, this is a very tasty, fine looking beverage. A conundrum with depth, complexity, and surprises!"

"Boulevard Chocolate Ale ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really like this one. It's a sipper."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of peanut butter, sweet malt, hint of alcohol, hint of yeast, and a hint of roasted malt. Sadly, chocolate is lacking in the aroma, but strangely peanut butter present. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dark chocolate, sweet malt, hint of hop, hint of yeast, slight peanut butter, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, more peanut butter than chocolate, but otherwise weak appearance, and blend. This beer does not live up to the hype."

"O: No chocolate. That should be enough to deter any drinker with the literary aptitude to read a bottle. I can't say in good conscience that it is a horrible beer, but it is quite poor. I feel that my expectations have been ransacked; that I've been bamboozled! How could a beer boast the proclamation of chocolate and stand with nothing to offer? For those who live in the world of summation and ""buzz-words," where is the chocolate???"

"O: A solid beer in small doses - the chocolate flavor (despite the disappointing aroma) is moderately prevalent, but it's a bit of hard work to imbibe. If this were closer to a stout or even a brown instead of an amber/red, I'd like this much better. This is something that you split between 6 or so people instead of drinking by yourself."
""
""
""

""
""
"I'm working from memory, so I won't be including minor details. The chocolate flavor of this batch was quite subtle, and I think that's a very good thing. Initially I thought the beer was a bit too thin and the flavor somewhat shallow. Even though I had let the beer warm up a little before drinking, I thought the flavor improved markedly as it warmed further. Honestly I loved the last few swigs and sips, and by then I wished I had purchased several bottles. I really think it might be best near room temperature, but I'll have to experiment more next year. This beer is incredibly smooth and deceptively strong. I like that combination since I'm not a quantity drinker. I really wish I didn't have to wait another year to try it again!"
""
"Overall- I have been trying to get my hands on this beer for 3 years and I thought I had missed out again this year until my sister-in-law surprised me with a bottle. It is a pretty good beer but I don't know if it was worth a 3 year wait, but I am glad that I got to try it finally."

"O - I like the chocolate character in this beer. An interesting take on what can be a somewhat boring base beer."
""
"It's an interesting beer, but it's chocolate angle is more akin to bitter fruit and chili warmth and mild bitterness, and the label seems very misleading. I am sure people are drinking this and thinking... brown or chocolate sugar expectations, but this has some real neat spice character, but chocolate is really just the secondary for the main act."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty interesting and good take on a chocolate beer. Lighter bodied but a big chocolate malt taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unique and interesting. Wasn't sure if I'd like this, but the manager had 6 bottles, would only let me buy one, so i figured I was up for it. Glad I did. This is an ale, feels like it, drinks like it, but it's chocoaltey. Not like a milk shake, or a chocolate stout. It is an ale infused with chocolate flavor through and through. Very funky, in a really good way."
""
"O: exceptional and unusual."
""
""
""
"I was really looking forward to this, as I do all of Boulevard's Smokestack beers. To say I'm a fan of Boulevard is an understatement. Sadly, as I glared at the empty bottle, I wish I hadn't purchased it - a first for a BLVD beer. It's worth sampling, as it's unique enough to warrant the addition to your palette... BUT(!) I'd recommend going in on a bottle with a bunch of friends - finishing a bottle by yourself might prove a challenge otherwise."

"General commentary; I do not know what is going on with Boulevard, I have had plenty of misses with their smokestack 750ml and this is certainly one of them. Yeast poisoning? Remember a couple of years ago they pulled BCA off the market? Yep, due to yeast poisoning. Read the reviews of on tap vs 750 for the 2014 BCA, they seem to vary greatly."
"O - Boulevard's Chocolate Ale collaboration has quite a bit of authenticity to it's flavor profile as opposed to artificial ingredients but it doesn't quite help the fact that dusty cocoa and cocoa bean don't give quite a nice liquidy chocolate profile the label's decorated with. This Smokestack series is a nice offering in and of itself but doesn't quite stand up to the series' otherwise impressive gamut."
""
"Well I expected this beer to pour dark so I was surprised to see such a light color. It taste good but it's not great. Glad I tried it but this is probably a one and done."
""
""
"Definitely not worth $14. If you're curious about trying this beer, I'd save your money. Or get your friend to buy it. Total disaster, I literally poured this down the drain."
""
""
""
"O: When it comes to dark ale adjuncts, chocolate seems to be fairly common. Here, Boulevard seems to have had something special in master chocolatier Christopher Elbow, and that shows: the cacao you taste is gourmet. But the beer is hindered by a sad off-flavor, a plastic-y case of what I think is over-carbonation. When I twisted the cork off I was surprised by the pressure it had – that thing ripped out of there like a gunshot – and when I poured I could instantly smell the off-aroma. I’m pretty sure this is unfiltered, though, so I guess it could also be a yeast off-flavor. But, in all, there’s obvious quality beneath this beer’s missteps; I just wish the bottle wasn’t so damn expensive ($14 for 750mL) so I could give it a second chance without feeling insane…"
""

""

"Mouthfeel is good. High carbonation and stickiness seem nicely balanced. There is a somewhat vinigar like sticky sour finish but is very light and not intrusive."

"I must agree with many of those who have tried this 2014 batch of Boulevard chocolate ale, the chocolate is faint and barely noticeable. Two years ago I kept going back to BCA because it was quite simply one of the best beers I've ever had. It was a surprisingly easy drinker back then as well, which was strange for a chocolate beer (of course it's not a stout or porter). The balance of chocolate was spot on, a perfect blend that was just sweet enough. It appears this beer has fallen victim to the cost-cutting methods or alternate recipes so many brewers implement to stretch out ingredients and increase production on high-demand limited release beers. I had been eagerly awaiting this beer perhaps more than any other in the last two years and am severely disappointed with the bottle I drank. I just paid 13.99 + tax for a beer that had absolutely no business being in a high priced bomber. Sure it's a solid ""3.0"" beer to be put in a 6 pack for 7.99 and sold as a typical craft amber ale or something, but with chocolate that isn't pronounced, and sold as ""chocolate ale"" for around 15$, ratings should be adjusted accordingly. The difference between the bottles I bought in 2012 and 2014 was night and day. I even think 2012 was clearer copper color, while 2014 looked cloudy when poured. I have one more bottle I'll put away and pray for some miraculous aging and I'll try to find it on tap to compare, but wow. MAJOR letdown. Looking at all the wildly variable reviews on this beer... maybe it's just one of those inconsistent beers where every now and then you get a special batch. *sigh*"

"O- This beer was kind of confusing intially with the light color and the lack of texture. All in all I really enjoyed it. I appreciated the milk chocolate flavors just because I'm so used to encountering dark chocolate flavors. I will snag a bottle of this when I see it next."
"The body is moderate to mod light. For the ABV would like a bit more complexity. Carbonation is good. Overall a bit disappointing."
""
"Severely frustrated with these results!"
"Sadly .. I will not be buying this brew next year unless they change the recipe by making the chocolate the HERO of the beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Note: I realize people smelled and tasted green beans from the ""infected"" batch 2 years ago. That did not influence my review. I smelled what I smelled and tasted what I tasted. I'm starting to think the batch wasn't infected at all. Its just a bad, bad beer."
"$15 for 750ml"
""
""
""
""
"Not as 'Yoo-Hoo' like as the version from 2 years ago, in a good way. Very drinkable and pleasant, but not mind-blowing. Worth a try for sure."
"With all the hype around this beer, the lines at the liquor stores, the 1 bottle per person limit, i had high expectations....perhaps too high. I thought it would taste more chocolatey. There is definitely a chocolate flavor but it more like a faint very mild cocoa truffle like flavor. The chocolate taste is more present on the backside of the drink and definitely more so as it warms. The beer definitely tastes better than it smells, in my opinion. The smell was not so pleasant to me, but perhaps i am just not that familiar with high end chocolate and this is how it smells."
"Overall, I can't really say that the beer lives up to the crazytown hysterics that people go through to get it, but that is no fault of the beer. The way people hunt this one down is simply unreasonable for ANY beer, even one as delicious as this one. It certainly shows just how creative Boulevard can get with their brews, demonstrating that you can infuse chocolate into a beer without making a stout or porter. I can't help but wonder how ridiculous getting hands on a bottle would be if this was just Boulevard Chocolate Ale instead of Chocolate Ale by Boulevard in Collaboration With Christopher Elbow."

"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of chocolate and nutty malt notes is quite interesting. Taste is also dominated by really nice floral black chocolate notes without much bitterness. Nutty caramel malt notes are also easily discernible and really enjoyable. Body is about average with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very enjoyable and nice integration of chocolates notes without going back to a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I review the beer against what it was SUPPOSED to be, its a total miss. Maybe a 2.0, because the chocolate is still noticeable."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, cocoa, and a nutty aroma. Taste is much the same with cocoa and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."

"Nice HUGE pop when releasing the cork. Poured into a chalice a very nice hazy golden amber color, very nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy/fizzy off-white head, which leaves some nice oil slicks and sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, very nice touch of dark chocolate, some slight notes of bananas, nice little hop note to boost, lightly spiced. The taste is very nice, malty, with that nice touch of yeast, throw in some dark chocolate, and bananas/spice note. Medium body, slightly dry finish, very drinkable. ABV is hidden very well. Overall a very tasty brew. Do not expect a Stone Arrogant Bastard here folks, this is more like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Thanks Bill for sending this one my way."
""
"Flavor wise that rich, sweet milk chocolate carries over into the rest of the beer. Its as close to a pure chocolate tasting beer as I think you can get. The flavor isn't as overpowering as the delightful aroma but its still a very flavor packed brew. It has a nice thickness and it goes down smooth, very little carbonation. Would love to try this again sometime."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a 750 ml bomber with a cork and cage, served in a Chimay chalice."
"O: This beer was surprising from the nose to the taste. I was expecting a little bit more chocolately sweetness but, what I did experience was interesting and enjoyable."
"Shrug. This is a nice enough beer, especially for those who like the flavor of chocolate in their beer (I'm fairly neutral on the concept myself)."
"This wasn’t what I was initially thinking this was going to be (thought it was going to be darker) but that was OK! I liked how the chocolate here was more of a complimentary flavor to the others things that were going on with this, while the higher alcohol gives this a heft that made it more of a warming after dinner sipper. This was well crafted and interesting."

"On the whole, I must admit I was disappointed by this offering from Boulevard, and I say this as a huge fan of some of their other brews. This chocolate ale was short on chocolate and on definition--far too nuanced for me to ever get a grip on what quite it was supposed to be. Hopefully it can be forgiven on account of the proximity to its best by date."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, Batch 2010-2 (I don't think this is one of the infected batches), best before 09-2011. I saw this on sale at Bridge Liquors recently, and I've never had this beer before so I figured why not buy it? Served in a tulip (as recommended on Boulevard's website), the brew pours a hazy dark amber with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like bittersweet and milk chocolate, tootsie rolls, nuts, and some booze and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, although I would like to try a fresher bottle sometime. Definitely worth a try."
"Beer drinks a little like a chocolate flavored spirit. The body of the beer does very little to conceal the presence of alcohol and the whole thing comes off a little solventy. The chocolate is nice but a little one note. I won't have it again."
"I probably couldn't drink more than 8-10 oz at a time so I would recommend a bottle share if you get the 750."

"Poured on-tap and served in a vase, the beer is a cloudy, amber coloring with a thin, small bubbled, low profile off-white head. Aromas of semisweet chocolate, roasty notes, and an earthy undertone. Flavors are much more chocolatey. Seriosuly, this is a melted Hershey bar in your mouth. Creamy, smooth body, with a mild chocolate milk aftertaste. The finish is smooth and light. I really can't expound on the flavor any more, because it is truly all chocolate. Impressive flavor profiles given the style. Tasty."

"Overall: A unique take on chocolate beer, but it loses something in the long run. The chocolate flavors feel old and waxy and don't really help anything. It's all there, but it wasn't put together correctly."
"O - Not what I expected but still a solid beer."
"Overall it's an extremely interesting beer. However, I feel mine's gone bad and I'm not sure how to rate it. I'll put one in but I'm getting a new bottle."
""
""
""
"""Aroma was more subtle than I thought it would be, chocolate, vanilla, maybe a little coffee aroma in there. A nice thick tanish colored heat, huge amounts of lacing. Flavor is chocolate through and through with some vanilla in there as well. A fantastic beer for chocolate lovers! Well done Boulevard!"""

"*This is not from the infected batch."

"* I didn't write down the batch number on the bottle but we looked it up before we opened it and it was not one of the reportedly infected batches they are offering refunds for."
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a somewhat cloudy red-orange amber. Massive off white head that lasts a long time and leaves abundant lacing. Very attractive. Delicious chocolate and light malt aroma. Taste is very different, mild light and dark fruits, sweet malt, caramel, vanilla and chocolate. Mild hops in the finish. Very tasty and well integrated. I really enjoyed this ale. Will buy again."

"An interesting beer, the cocoa is unique and really blends well with the hop character."

"O: I understand that this is one of the infected bottles (2011-1), but I've had infected Boulevard beers before and they still deliver. This may not be what the Chocolate Ale is supposed to taste like, but it's still delicious. Labeled under any different name, and this is a delicious sour. It's super tart, super fruity, and surprisingly drinkable. In a month or so, this might change. I'm glad I opened it when I did. This beer could easily turn into an infection time-bomb in the near future. If you have a bottle... drink it now."
""
""
"Pours much lighter than I was expecting, looks more like a light tan soda than a beer, very clear with minimal head. Whoa, the smell is pure chocolate. Like taking a container of unsweetened cocoa powder and snorting a line. Very bitter and complex without the usual sweetness I associate with chocolate, even dark chocolate is sweeter smelling than this. Very unique aroma. The taste is good but not quite as good as the aroma. Definitely still get a heavy chocolate taste with just enough malt backbone to remind you this is a beer. Hard to discern any hop presence behind the the bitterness of the cocoa. The mouthfeel was good, very easy to drink especially for 9%. Overall this is a very unique beer. Most chocolate beers I have tried have been beers flavored with chocolate, this is more like chocolate in beer form."
"Quite the brewing oddity here. Don't think I've ever seen so much cocoa packed into a beer so pale! The nut brown pour was quite a shock, me having been conditioned to expect chocolate beers to be dark, dark, dark. The smell is melted Hershey's bittersweet chocolate all the time. Interesting. But I can't say it's a great experience, simply because it isn't delicious. A bit overpoweringly bitter for me, but I think it's quite an accomplishment in brewing engineering."
""
""

""
""
"really interesting beer. a chocolate brew that isnt black or brown. pours a beige to dark tan color with a one inch lasting off white head. smells entirely different. cocoa powder in its bittersweet glory is the dominant smell and flavor, but it also as a jovial belgian like yeast thats extremely active and complimentary, as well as a unique malt profile that gives a lot of dimension to the chocolate flavor, which is not overpowering in the slightest. alcohol is well concealed and this is amazingly drinkable with very bright carbonation and a medium body. i was quite impressed with this one, well worth a try if you can find it."
"O: Was pretty disappointed with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a diaphanous copper ale with just a sheet of fine, light latte foam. No lace. Smells of chocolate, a hint of pepper and some english malts. Flavor is of cocoa, butter, some sugar and sweetness. No infection tasted here. Body is smooth and rich with low carb an a syrupy finish. Interesting beer, don't know if the beer is infected, but I find it to be pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was quite the pleasant surprise. It's definitely a sharer for me - a 750 on my own would be a bit much. I'd love to try this fresh and see if there was more chocolate and less boozy sweetness."
""
""
"There is a distinct character to this beer. It's a sipper. A lot of thought went into its brewing. My favorite Boulevard to date."
""
"O- I love it. I'd like to have more."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style in that this beer is exactly what the name implies, it’s not a stout, it’s a chocolate ale."
""
"Something went wrong with this one. The infection either wiped out most of the chocolate character as well or it was never there. Either way, very dissapointing."
""
""
"8,3,8,4,16. 750 ml bottle. This is the first chocolate beer I've ever had that wasn't black or dark brown. It pours hazy orange with a huge beige head that collapses after a few minutes. Aroma is of course chocolatey. I also smell a hint of coffee. Taste is sweet with a hint of sour leading to a faintly dry bitter finish. Velvety mouthfeel and medium carbonation. It's a nice beer, but I prefer Southern Tier's Choklat and Sam Adams Chocolate Bock."

"Overall this is sort of a strange drink. I like the chocolate but wish it was a bit maltier. It is not too sweet which is a good thing, and things start to improve once it warms a bit."
""
"EDIT- Turns out it was a bad batch and the company reimbursed me 100%! VERY VERY cool of them! I'd love to find this beer again and have the chance to give a review on a good batch"
""
""
""
"Chocolate is definitely here but it's not the rich, indulgent chocolate I was expecting. More of a spicy cocoa with a raspberry type tart finish. An addition of chile would have been nice."
"I'm not displeased that I tried this beer - It's a very interesting brew, especially since you only seem to get chocolate incorporated into stouts. Unfortunately, ""interesting"" doesn't equal ""good."" I'd only recommend this for novelty, but sometimes novelty can go a long way."
""
"EDIT: As I keep going, the vanilla and caramel pick up in flavor. Interestingly candy-driven for a beer that comes across as powdery and not overly sweet. Score going up!"
"Mouthfeel: A smooth start that finishes with a sweet to the tastebuds feel"
"Overall: Very chocolaty. Love the big cocoa taste and it still tastes like beer. This is another beer from Boulevard, that when I first started drinking it, I was like this is just above average. Then it will hit me that it is very good, then I will go back and forth between above average and good until I discovered I finished the bottle and want more...So long story short--a good beer, but Boulevard makes better--or maybe they don't...yes I will get this again--once a year for Valentine's day."

"O/D-A cool gift for Valentine's Day. I was happy to try it but at about $10 for the 750 ml, I think I kinda wasted my money."
""
""
""
"A very light brown in color. Smells exactly like one of those chocolate hard candy mints. Taste is initially a blast of chocolate extract, followed by some light malts, and a clean dry ethanol finish. Mouthfeel is syrupy, low carbonation. Overall an interesting beer, though the chocolate flavor gets a bit overboard after awhile."
""
""
""
"O - Really unimpressed by this beer. Until drinking this, I hadn't had a bad beer from Boulevard. This though...average at best. Perhaps it was a bad bottle, I dont know, but regardless I wont be buying this again."
""
"Part of a recent trade, poured from the 750ml to an Ommegang tulip. Cloudy burnt orange color, big frothy head dissipating quick. Smell is pretty faint, milk chocolate, maybe a little nutty. The taste is not quite what I was expecting but once you get past the overly carbonated tounge massage some levels of chocolate flavor appear that are nice. A hybrid of fine milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate flavors, yeast spice, and an almost tart like accent hangs around sip to sip. Not creamy in any right which would of made this much more pleasant. This wasn't at all what I was expecting and maybe my rating is a little unfair do to my expectations. It's an above average beer In my opionion."
""
""
""
""
"Don't confuse this one with a chocolate stout. I didn't expect one, but I did hope for a bit more of a chocolate presence. This is definitely a strong ale that just happens to have a bit of a chocolate fetish going on."
""
"Add to that, the too thin and bubbly mouth feel and the end product is just not quite right."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice beer that I would partake in again...perfect for the season and not overpowering like some chocolate beers out there"
"Poured from the bottle, the scent was a potent but strange aroma. Some have described it as peas. It did take away from the drinking experience slightly. It poured a golden brown type color with a certain degree of cloudiness. A sweet chocolate flavor was immediately noticeable on the first taste. The taste yields to a smooth and sweet chocolate aftertaste that lacks the ugly sour milk flavor of a chocolate stout. There is almost a certain brandy quality to the aftertaste as it is mildly warming. With a mild level of carbonation, this is a excellent after dinner drink."
""
"Poured out as a nice looking golden color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer was very nice, it had a chocolate aroma that was subtle but dominant at the same time, very interesting. The taste of the beer was very interesting also, the chocolate was in there for sure but yet it seemed natural and not overly sweet or artificial tasting. It's much more natural tasting that Southern Tier's Choklat. The mouthfeel was nicely carbonated and was medium bodied. Overall I was really impressed with this brew. I would enjoy having this one again someday."
""
""
""
"Most chocolate beers play off the roasted malt chocolate tastes and will tend to be in a roboust stout form. This beer is on a lighter body and pours a golden amber color. The taste is smooth with a chocolately finish. The 9% abv is hidden well, I recommend this beer to chocolate lovers."
"Overall Impression- A very sweet and easy going brew and is nice for the style. I expected more character in the taste and mouthfeel though... Would not go for a bottle of this. Glad some people think this is an outstanding brew, I will leave it for them to enjoy."
"I'm more than a little disappointed in this. The taste profile is bland and I feel that there is way too much alcohol involved. I want a chocolate ale to taste like chocolate. This beer tastes like a 9% ABV amber more than it does anything else."

"Just tried this after eating a smidge chocolate cake- tastes really refreshing and great with chocolate."
"an interesting chocolate ale that's worth a try. wish i saw some more roasted malt or chocolate malt here, but its still a good beer."
""
"O- This beer has some unique qualities which makes it a must try. While not something I would want all the time I will definitely have another. I think Boulevard was right on by making this a limited release and if you love chocolate then they hit the nail on the head."
"This is interesting. I cant quite wrap my head or palette around it. Its not bad but not my favorite and a bit disappointing."
""
""
""
"O: This is not as great as I was expecting. It is good, but nothing too special."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers Kansas City..."
"Not what I expected, but a good beer. Reminded me of some quads I've tried."
"The hype surrounding this beer is amazing. Not quite sure it's worth all the hype, but still glad I got to try some."
""
""
""
""
"But there's a downside. Its trick is only one, like so many ponies out there. But I love Cocoa Puffs, so that's cool with me."
"O: Pretty good beer. It's chocolately for sure but honestly it's surprisingly mild. It's not one of those gimmick beers that just tastes like someone watered down some hershey's syrup. Surprisingly complex, in fact I think it could almost use a little MORE chocolate if they're gonna call it a chocolate ale."
"All in all, a heavy old ale style that loses its chocolate edge; once that initial chocolate flair is gone, its time to get creative to choke the syrupy stuff down. Interesting one sipper - won't need to try again."
""
"O- Not a bad beer by any means. However, this is definitely not an everyday brew. This is with out a doubt a desert beer. Very chocolaty, very sweet. This would be a great after dinner dessert in beer form."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really interesting beer with a nice chocolate note. I do get the cocoa notes but I don't know if I would call it a ""chocolate ale."" The alcohol provides a nice warming throughout. Very unexpected, but nice."
"Reviewed on: 02-14-2011 19:57:42"
""
"O - Refreshing to get some chocolate out of a beer that is not a stout. Well done. This one is good fresh and the chocolate flavor is spot on, so I would not recommend aging this beer. Just came into stores today here and I'll have to get a bunch more at just $9 a bottle. I would like to cook with this beer as I think some wonderful things could come out of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: THIS BOTTLE WAS ONE OF A LARGE RECALL FROM THIS BATCH"
"Interesting, to say the least. Definitely chocolaty, with a different flavor profile that usually show up in beers, and in a style that doesn't usually incorporate chocolate. Overall, it works pretty damn well."
"D-Very easy drinking and deliciously chocolatey without being too over the top. The base beer is subtle enough to let the chocolate shine without letting the chocolate overwhelm the base beer."
""
""
"O: A very nice beer, quite delicious. Unlike anything I've ever had. Worth seeking out."
""
"O- not a bad beer, in a small dose, I would not want to drink a whole 750, but tasty in a taster format."
"This beer is fun. It's a nice change for a chocolat beer that isn't a stout or Sam Adams. This beer turned up lately at a local grocer and I snatched a few. Very tasty. Another winner from Boulevard!"
""
""
""
"Taste was different than I expected. Chocolate notes were not as evident after a few minutes open. This reminded me of Maudite or Trois Pistoles. Dark fruit with a hint of sour. Chocolate was there if you looked for it. Definitely a distinct beer. Moderately priced as well."
""
""
""
""

"O: This was definitely different. I have a feeling that some of the chocolate notes have faded with time. Will revisit fresh."

"O- This is really different and very well done! I could think of at least a dozen meals to pair this with. The smell tells you belgian stout, but the mouthfeel and taste are anything but. I love the subtle hop and dark chocolate bitterness. I wish I had more of this for the cold NY winter ahead of me."
"O: A chocolate lovers dream. Near perfect harmony of chocolate and beer. Excellent for both craft drinkers and people just getting in to craft."
"O: This beer would be far more successful to me if the nose matched the depth of chocolate in the flavor. This is not the case however. What you get is a beer that smells like a middle of the road ale without a whole lot of character... and then all the chocolate character comes out on the finish of the flavor. Interesting to say the least."
"I’m continually impressed with Boulevard’s smokestack series and this is another gem in the line-up."
"This beer didn't quite fit my expectations, which is probably my fault. I expected a lot more chocolate and a little more sweetness. For some reason I expected a darker malt base also. That isn't to say this beer is bad, because what I encountered is a malt bomb that reminds me of a lightly hopped strong ale."
"Overall, this was much better than I had expected. It's the first non-stout chocolate beer that I've ever had, but it's opened my eyes to seek others.."
"O - This beer really surprised me. I expected more chocolate (hence the name) but I picked up a lot of fruity notes such as apple. The chocolate is present but very much subdued."
"O- Is this past its prime, or just was it never? I did not enjoy this, nor did the other 2 I shared this. Had too high of hopes, but i'm still glad I got to try!"
"Overall: I was very disapointed in this one. Tastes fake and one dimensional."
"Pours a cloudy deep copper color almost brown. A nice pillowy head sticks around and lines the glass. Smells of dairy and very sweet. Some chocolate on the nose but mostly sweet malts. Also hints of alcohol. Taste is pretty smooth compared to other chocolate brews. Malts and alcohol up front with a nice lingering cocoa flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a very nice texture. Overall this is a great brew. I don't think I could handle the entire 750 mL of it but the taste is truly unique and complex and the aromas are spot on."
"in 750ml bottle, 2/18/2011, not different from tap"
"Kinda wish I had this handy whilst taking down the Box o' Chocolates those times. Oh, well... Regardless, it pours a clear sunrise russet topped by a healthy finger of khaki froth. Honestly, I expected something darker. Not that this looks bad, just unexpected. The nose is pretty much straight dark chocolate, with a hint of fudge in the background. This ain't no sweet chocolate, either: It's brash, slap-you-in-your-sad-little-sweet-expecting-face bitter cooking chocolate, baby. Dizzamn. The taste doesn't change things up very much, though the chocolate's bitterness seems cut a bit. It's still quite a bit of some black-hole-style dark chocolate, don't get me wrong. I think some dark greens and some rich toffee are mixed in there as well, but it's hard to tell with all of this chocolate hangin' 'round here. Not bad, really. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that yearns to be chewy. Overall, a tasty brew that definitely lives up to its name. Sure, it's a one-trick pony, but it's a pretty decent trick..."
"The smell was awesome, and the taste was very good with suttle hints of dark chocolate. Very smooth on the tongue and kinda heavy overall was a great beer one of the best chocolate stouts that ive had and one of the best in the smoke stack series."
"O: If you can get your hands on one, DO! This is a very delicious treat!"
"Overall: Was delighted and more than a bit surprised to see it on the shelves, had little expectation. To reiterate, quite unlike any beer I've had up to this point. I think I prefer chocolate and cocoa notes in my stouts, but I do thoroughly enjoy this beer. The taste isn't terribly complex, but I think the way it all comes together is rather pleasant."
"Another great beer by Boulevard."
"Tips into excellent territory. Thought this might be a gimmick, but in reality it's a well-crafted brew that pleases this crowd of two. The Smokestack Series is as good a line of beer as you can get - keep it up, Boulevard (& use caps!)."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer, but I would have liked it to be a little smoother in the finish."
"This beer provides som really nice balance between the fruit, spices, and chocolate notes. What is nice is that the chocolate is not overwhelming and there's not a dominant sweetness or booziness. Well executed and very enjoyable overall."
"Overall: It definitely masks its alcohol content well, and, with a taste like Smucker's..."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry, a little chalky, pretty nice. Good beer. Much better than I was expecting."
"o) Just not a beer for me. All indications were that it would be tasty but it just hit my taste buds wrong. Surprised as I have had great success with other Smokestack series beers."
"PP (Price Point) - $15 or so for a 750ml is a pretty decent price, just not my style."
"Overall-Just didn't do much for me. It's not the worst beer I ever had but just got really bored with it. My wife liked the first few sips then didn't want anymore either. This would be a good beer try a black and tan with or some other crazy mixture."
"Drinkability: An interesting experiment - a light to medium bodied strong ale with a chocolate flavor is not something I would have thought of. The variety of flavors was nice, but in the end the sweetness kind of dragged this into the 'ok' range for me."
"o - Overall a good beer, though I think this is one to share with some friends. I think it would be tough to tackle a whole bottle of this by yourself. Would have it again."
"Overall I think its good, it is nothing like I have ever had in a beer before."
"O – Really nice flavors here. If you are a chocolate fan this is a great ale to have at. Its smooth and tasty and not overly sweet. Good solid brew that is well worth trying."
"If this thing is falling off now, man I wish I'd have tried it months ago...it must have been stellar, because it's still wonderful, unique, and wonderfully unique!"
"My excellent neighbor once again provides a wonderful delight from Boulevard. The Chocolate Ale deom the smoke stack series hits a home run! The color was a complete surprise to me....I was expecting a dark rich color, but instead it was a cloudy amber beer with thin white head. The aroma screammed dark choclate. The tast starts as a normal ale, then the finish is a sweet hersey chocolate bar. The mouthfeel is quite nice, the abv is nicely balanced."
"I have enjoyed all the other Boulevard beers I have tasted except this one."
"This serves as a wonderful contrast to other top-tier chocolate beers, distinguishing itself by allowing the complexity of the chocolate to speak through the ale, the base of which is closer to Belgian or Italian styles than a rich dark stout (the more traditional vehicle for chocolate in beer). Smart, daring, and enjoyable concoction, this."
"O: Good, nice choc, malts, light hops, not much for booze either, tasty."
"O - Incredibly unique brew. Flavors are more amazing than i've had in quite sometime. Interesting brew...."
"Drink- I can see why people in the midwest were pissed when this flew off the shelves. This was unique, inventive and very tasty."
"D – This is another great beer from Boulevard, they never seem to let me down, but then again the Batch 2 Imperial Stout from this year was a little funky, but I’m looking forward to how that one ends up. I would buy this again and enjoy it with a group of friends. This is a beer worth sharing, even nonbeer drinkers would enjoy it."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"Overall I enjoyed this beer more than I anticipated, not due to the fact that Boulevard made a beer with so much chocolate influence, but that they managed to let it retain some beer characteristics and not overdo the sweetness. Worth a shot."
"overall a really nice done beer. came across to me as more of a belgian ris."
"O: Not the best chocolate ale I've had but it is definitely unique. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the style."
"This may not wow you, but it's definitely worth trying."
"Pour yields a copper-colored brew that is mostly clear. Off white head lasts for a good time and leaves an average amount of spotty lacing behind. The nose has a bit of caramel, but is overloaded with chocolate. However, it's more reminiscent of packaged chocolate milk or Hershey syrup rather than cocoa nibs. One dimensional and a bit fake. Not sure whether actual cocoa was used, but it doesn't really seem like it. The same can be said of the flavor. Body is medium with light carbonation, and the finish is slightly-astringent. Overall, not big on this one."
"CH33RS."
"Fanatastic brew! A gem in the Smokestack series from Boulevard. Yum!"
"Overall, I don't really understand the hype on this one. Not something I'd recommend at the price here in Chicago, $20. There are some weird things I'd pick up just to have again with a friend who hasn't had it before, this one would not be one of them. Was wanting it to live up to the fantome chocolate, but it didn't."
"Not the biggest fan chocolate beers but this was definitely worth trying. Don't know if I'd buy it again unless I wanted someone to try it"
"This bottle poured a very cloudy, murky, and chunky auburnish brown in color with a heaping, frothy and soapy cream colored head. It has a moderate amount of stirring sediment. It smells of chocolate flakes, cocoa powder, and has a light citrusy hop aspect. It's very appealing on the nose. The flavors are in your face, melted and velvety soft milk chocolate. It really, really makes me think I'm drinking a glass of chocolate milk, ala Nesquick. The flavors are phenomenal and insanely delicious. The aftertaste may be the best part, being rich and bold. This beer is shockingly good. To be honest, I really didn't expect that much but wow. It is also impressively smooth. It's hard to classify this as a traditional American Strong Ale. I feel it should be in a different category. This beer is just too drinkable, and at 9%? I can't believe it. I only got a tad of alcohol at the very end of my glass. This beer is a must try and bested only by Boulevard's BBQ in their 750ml bottle series."
"O- Not too bad at all. I don't think I'd be able to drink this one by myself, but with a group no problem."
"All in all, an interesting and good beer."
"4.0 D: Lots of chocolate in this chocolate ale, so in that regard it doesn't disappoint. Solid all around."
"Overall is good not great. Probably won't buy again this year at least."
"This is a nice and unique chocolate beer that drinks way easier than a big heavy stout or porter. Very unique, but not as good as it was on tap. I would not recommend aging this as the chocolate seems to be falling off already. I would definitely have this again."
"The mouthfeel is quite full and yet still finishes dry with ample carbonation. I wonder what kind of yeast they used because I am getting the nice dry Belgian finish and that would make sense as well because I got some Belgian yeast flavors earlier. I will have to investigate at a later date. Overall this is delicious. I can best describe it as a desert beer for the warmer seasons like Spring and Summer. Most chocolate beers are stouts and porters which are too much in the warmer months but this can be enjoyed any time of the year. Boulevard continues to impress and please me with each beer of theirs I sample."
"Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side, but the carbonation was ample and moved the tastes around nicely. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It was a great way to break up a stout-focused tasting without totally switching up flavors!"
"O. Overall I have to say I am somewhat surprised at what this beer turned out to be. I was expecting a dark beer with lots of dark chocolate flavors. Instead it was a strong ale with some white choclate and vanilla flavors. This beer needs to be served room temp. It gained quite a bit as it warmed. Overall a pretty uniques beer. I personally would have went for a darker more chocolate fouces beer if I was making a Chocolate Ale. Probably my least favorite of all of the Smokestack Series beers."
"I like my chocolate dark, and I think I prefer my chocolate ales to be the same. The chocolate used here is definitely interesting, but not a favorite."
"Creamy, fluffy body, very smooth and easy on the tongue. This is pretty different from what I expected - definitely a nice change of pace from syrupy huge stouts and the alcohol is masked nicely."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It's easy drinking and a unique experience that's worth giving a shot. Im only now seeing this listed as a strong ale with 9+% that is shocking to me, the abv is well hidden. It's not something I would want to drink on a regular basis but it makes for an interesting offering to pair with food. A word of caution, at the time of this beer being shared, a non-beer drinking person in the room tried a sample and chugged the rest of the bottle... This beer does appeal to those who ""don't like beer."""
"For what it is - this is pretty much ideal."
"Whoa, the taste is way different than the nose would indicate, just a totally unique blast of artisanal chocolate and sweet vanilla. I like how it is not really 'milky' in the chocolatyness. Lots of cocoa, little bit of bittering hops. This beer really gets mad props for the uniqueness of the beer, very original. And for the most part it works well, I might have gone with a little less alcohol and maybe some more caramel maltiness."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Being an ale it's a lot lighter than other chocolate bocks I've had. Being a strong ale the body is good. The aroma is of light cocoa with noticeable hops and maybe a hint of caramel thrown in. The aroma is a bit odd. The cocoa flavor comes on very faint at first, then is has a sudden crescendo for a few seconds, then becomes lighter than the initial taste. It ends up being very light cocoa with an odd tartness from the hops. The malts don't make much of an appearance. Overall it's a bit of a letdown. The alcohol is felt but the flavor doesn't really ad much character to the beer."
"Opinion: I think that Ommegang has something to learn from this beer as the Chocolate is absolutely unmistakable. The supporting beer is really good as well. I personally make Chocolate beers as well, and I have found a Bock to be a nice base for this style, but the Old Ale suits it well too. This beer is well blended and represents what it is supposed to be. I also think that it would age pretty well, so I may pick up a few more to cellar. This might be REALLY good (better than it already is) in a couple years...as long as the Chocolate holds up and doesn't go bitter. I will pick up a couple and see. Either way, I would definitely recommend that you give this beer a shot. You won't be disappointed."
"Nothing about this beer screams Chocolate Ale or American Strong Ale. It's a wacky blend of styles that just seems to miss on most levels, except the aroma. I'm glad they're only brewing this once...."
"This beer pours a reddish coppery yellow with all kinds of sediment/floaties. Light tan head that didn't amount to too much. The smell is pleasant, with some hot chocolate qualities mixed in with dry pine hops. I also pick up a bit of vanilla, pepper and distinct almond. Unfortunately, the smell was deceiving. I am very confused by this beer. It is almost as if they took an amber or even a pale ale and tried to dissolve a bunch of powdered cocoa in it, and were unsuccessful. It doesn't taste terrible, just not very good. The chocolate tasted like a bittersweet powder and wasn't integrated with the rest of the beer. You tasted the cocoa on one hand then you get some nice vanilla, almond/hazelnut and pepper on the other. Mouthfeel was gritty and unbalanced. I didn't finish the whole 750, not that I couldn't, I'd just had enough. This won't deter me from Boulevard or the Smokestack series, as the rest of them are basically all home runs."
"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass a hazed mahagony reddish brown color with a large 3 finger tan head that slowly recedes, leaving lace as it does. Milk chocolate notes in the nose like a hot cocoa you get on a cold day. Medium mouthfeel. The chocolate is there but this is a very odd chocolate beer, as I'm used to chocolate stouts or porters, but this is much lighter and a more subtle chocolate flavor. Overall, it's ok, if I am in the mood for a chocolate beer, I'd much rather hit a Southern Tier or something like that."
"D: I enjoy the experimentation of the Smokestack series. This is a good beer, but no all-star. Lacking in chocolate influences and overly sweet. I'm sure Christopher Elbow is wonderful with chocolate, but his gifts don't translate well in the beer. Glad I tried it, but won't go back for more."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed especially as I had this on tap a couple weeks ago and the flavor and aroma where amazing. Very chocolaty with great taste. The wife even loved it. No sign of booze in that one. The bottle however is a different story. Worth trying but not up to the hype level. Maybe after some lengthy aging. Avail here in TX. Rotation - on-tap for sure and maybe a bottle for aging if I can find another. [R;Y]"
"O: Another excellent beer in the Smokestack Series. Can't wait 'til next month when I can just go to my local and pick up their bottles!"
"O: Not at all what I was expecting given the name of ""Chocolate Ale""."
"Notes: Definitely a chocolate beer, but luckily it is not overly sweet. Lots of nutty flavors as well. I enjoyed drinking it, but it is definitely not an everyday type of beer. Something like Valentine's Day is great for this since it isn't an amazing beer, but it isn't something I want regularly."
"This is good, but weird. I guess not really ""weird"" as compared to beers that a TRUELY weird. Its just not what springs to mind when you see the label. I'm not exactly flying through this glass, but I'm no where near drain pouring either. I guess I could say that this one occupies the meaty middle ground."
"Mouthfeel is probably the largest detractor with a slight burning sensation while you are taking a sip. Overall an amazing beer that everyone should try."
"Finish: Malty and a little heat, all the chocolate left my palate"
"D - I thought I was going to hate this beer when I first smelled it, however the taste and aroma are not one in the same. Overall rather enjoyable unique offering from Boulevard."
"This is a very interesting beer. The chocolate provides tons of roasted flavors, but it remains relatively light on the palate. The idea to make it a lighter beer to really feature the chocolate was a good way to go in my opinion."
"Overall- A great beer overall. I really enjoyed drinking this beer and I certainly hope that Boulevard will brew it again."
"A unique beer in that most chocolate beers I've had have been stouts. This is definitely an ale, and probably a very good one to introduce to a BMC drinker in that it's not overly complex but plenty tasty. It's very drinkable. No hint of alcohol even though it's got a fairly high ABV."
"Overall this is exactly what Boulevard wanted this beer to be and it was another solid smokestack release. Must try for anyone who likes this style."
"Overall, an interesting beer. It's interesting to see a lighter chocolate beer. I don't really think the execution followed through though."
"A bit unusual to have a lighter malt beer to be flavored with cocoa. Has a different chocolate flavor profile compared to the typical stout."
"Another solid offering from the smokestack series-Chocolate ale achieves an impressive amount of chocolate complexity in the nose and aroma, which make for a pleasant drinking experience. The intense flavors and high alcohol content do limit the drinkability of this beer a bit, but it's a nice sipper. This beer can be summed up in one word: Decadent."
"Drinks very easy for the style & ABV. Tasty, but not mind blowing, I would be just as happy with another bottle of Ommegang's Chocolate offering. This one actually could age into something better, I'm thinking. Since I only got the 1 bottle, I may never know..."
"Drinkability was good. No signs of ABV. Good blend of flavors."
"No beer in Kansas City had ever achieved the amounts of hype and hysteria that this beer achieved. It's a collaboration between Boulevard and Christopher Elbow, KC's own nationally-renowned master chocolatier. Kansas City went crazy for this collaboration. My verdict? The craziness is kind of justified. As a yearly release, this is going to be a favorite in KC for years to come. If you like chocolate, and/or you like subtle, refined beer, please seek this out. Just don't pay eBay prices for it."
"The most unique chocolate beer I've ever tried. It doesn't rely on roasted grains or malt sweetness to bring out the chocolate, instead the base beer offers a warm amber body and light hopping so the chocolate can really stand out on its own merits. And the quality of the cocoa used in this one certainly does sing. For me, this is a beer to be shared. The 750 mL was a little much for one drinker, but split between two or three it would be fantastic after dinner or even paired with roasted pork."
"Thanks to Dan for sharing this one with us after dinner tonight. Poured a medium brown color (we were all surprised at how light it was) with a decent light brown head. Huge chocolate aromas practically leap from the glass, dominating all else. Light to medium bodied, with flavors of chocolate, cocoa and a little toffee."
"I really love the idea, and Boulevard rarely misses with the Smokestack beers. Though this did not come together as well as I was hoping. It is very interesting, and worth a try. Just not the homerun many of the others in this series have been."
"I am going to hang onto the 2nd bottle and see what some age can do."
"D= This is a unique beer for sure! I've never thought of how chocolate could work in a beer that didn't have roast malts in the bill. It turns out it works just fine. Instead of having a supporting role this beer lets Christopher's chocolate creation really shine. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability- pretty easy, the chocolate flavor is a little dominating, so I see this one as an occasional drinker."
"D - great taste, but very assertive."
"Very creative offering."
"This is a rare occasion beer. Almost a winter warmer which is very appropriate for the craft. It is nearly a cocoa liquer. I find the malt:bitterness:alcohol balance is too far toward the alcohol. Perhaps it needs to age. Anyway, go try it!"
"Overall, this was better than I was expecting. The nose was just a little disappointing, but anything that it lacks there it makes up for in the taste and mouthfeel. The ginger cookies were a great suggestion and complement the chocolate, vanilla, and caramel very well. This is highly recommended!"
"I'd really like to see this be more like 6% abv. It's not that the alcohol hurts the flavor or aroma, but that it doesn't at all add and is unnecessary. This is a well crafted beer, but I have a hard time believing that anybody is going to drink this more than once, twice at the most."
"Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Smooth, easy to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden. The sweetness is balanced somewhat by hop bitterness. Another nice beer from the Boulevard Smokestack Series. I am glad I picked up additional bottles of this beer."
"I opened this up too cold. Once it warmed a bit the beer really opened up."
"D - This tastes good, but it must be shared. It is too much to handle as a 750ml beer."
"It pours a nice amber color with a creamy white two finger head. Good retention with notes of lacing throughout my glass. Smell is like an expensive box of chocolates with milk and dark chocolate, toffe, vanilla, and dark fruits. Taste is just exactly like it smells with a slight bitter balance to it with hops. Medium body with nice carbonation. Very superb beer and excellent."
"Like I said before--easy chugging until the 9% crushes your hopes and dreams."
"Mouth feel is medium in body, the chocate give it an interesting mouthfeel, drinkability is good, although it feels a little like a novelty the chocolate flavor comes through so well I encourage everyone to try it"
"D: Good"
"Drink is good. A nice brew, on par with and worthy of the name Smokestack. Another hit for Boulevard."
"Edit: After a while, and some warming, the aroma opened up and was more enjoyable. Score was adjusted so."
"Another well crafted and unique Smokestack. Definitely one I wouldn't want more than once a year. It's just an interesting dessert to me. Not a bad thing!"
"UPDATE: Yep, I finished the 750."
"Pours a cloudy reddish color with a big semi loose head and some lace. The aroma is roasty with some of those French chocolate truffles that are dusted in cocoa powder and some light fruitiness. The flavor is fairly bitter with roasted cocoa notes and a decent amount of fruitiness without really crossing that line into sweet. There is some alcohol hottness but not really in a distracting or annoying way. The beer tastes like chocolate but really not in a one dimensional way and gets nutty as it warms. Roasty cocoa is the star here for certain."
"Good job, Boulevard, as usual."
"A one note beer, but a really interesting note."
"750ml bottle $8.99. When i popped the cork I was amazed by the chocolate smell, so rich and yet not overly sweet. It smelled like expensive chocolates. The color was surprisingly amber and I was expecting black or brown. The flavor was more exquisite dark chocolate, very well done. Boulevard has really been impressing me with their smokestack beers and I look forward to the next one."
" All in all this is one damn unique and tasty beer. Perfect for a night, (there will only be one or two...or none..depending) where you can just sit down with a trashy novel and read you single sorrows away."
"I guess you should decant it like a wine? This beer improved greatly after letting it de-gas a bit."
"Mouthfeel is a lot lighter compared to the flavor and aroma. Usually something with intense flavor is a lot heavier. There is a light powdery grit that intensifies the chocolate flavor."
"A good Valentine's Day ale. I wish they had made much more of it so others got a chance at it. I was one of the few who managed to get a bottle of this too. Looking forward to that night here in the next few days. Prosit!"
"Overall I highly enjoyed this offering. Everything seemed to work together almost perfectly and the chocolate while still being very rich was not over the top. Well done."
"Really reminds me of a Belgian pale ale with chocolate instead of citrus playing the focus of the flavors. A good beer that really goes out on a limb and does a good job of displaying the chocolate flavors."
"Thin, could use something else. Perhaps a stout version would be better. I don't know. This one didn't sit well with me."
"An enjoyable experiment to challenge to tongue? Absolutely, and I applaud Boulevard for pushing the norms to brew this beer. Something I'd enjoy again and again? Probably not - just not my glass of beer, no matter the quality."
"From opening, I knew this was going to be an original experience. Christopher Elbow has a great gelato place in KC and I tried his dark chocolate gelato, and I could swear it was an identical chocolate profile. This beer is an ale rather than a stout which I was rather surprised about, I assume they really wanted to put the chocolate at the front of the flavor profile rather than muddle it within a big stout, and do something new. With a great off white head, and a hazy amber color, this beer was quite an experience, and I know every chocolate lover would really love this big beer. Cheers!"
"I was worried about this one from boulevard, but it doesn't disappoint. This is a very unique brew, and I can see how some folks will not enjoy it as much. I found it to be a very good brew with little touches of luxury. It should be great with a creme brûlée or fruit desserts."
"Overall, I'm afraid I fell prey to the hype of this beer. While I think it is very good it is a little underwhelming. The fact that it is a one-time brew and the city is scrambling to snatch it all up may have done this beer in expectations wise. I'm very happy to of had this bottle but if this were a seasonal I would not be anxiously awaiting its release every year like I do with so may other Boulevard beers."
"M&D- A fairly light brew. Not at all what i expected to get when i bought the bottle and saw Chocolate ale. Tastes a bit more carbonated than it looks. Tickles the tongue and throat on the way down and sit really well. Great warming feeling that comes with the taste. A 9.1% ABV is great on a cold night. This is really a great brew from Boulevard. I am glad to see that they are reaching out in new directions and collaborating with new ideas and people."
