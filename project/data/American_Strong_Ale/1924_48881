Sweet, fruits, caramel, great feel. i may have given it a little less than 5 but reading the reviews by reviewers that obviously thought they were buying a different style of beer pissed me off!

There are better huge beers out there, but most of those tend to fall in the stout category where the alcohol can be balanced by a heavy malt load. Its an interesting beer to try, I can finish my bottle and would like to see what a 3 or 4 year old vintage would taste like, but I wont go searching for this.

Another BA at the tasting, ucsbmullet commented that he thought it had some age, he guessed about two years. My first guess was a vintage big bottle of DFH Olde School Barleywine but the bottle isn't the right shape and it had an un-branded cap so I am going with my first instinct which is the only 15%+ beer from MD (where Oline73 is from) and that is DuClaw Colossus.","quirkzoo","Nov 13, 2012"

A boozy aroma of malts as I pick up hints of roasted but mostly some caramel, syrup/molasses and/or sugary goodness, cinnamom and spicy pepper and a touch of chocolate, and for some reason I'm getting a touch of fruit like cherry (the label says apple but it smells/taste like cherry to me). Taste is more of the same as this is an intense brew yet for all its thick, sticky, syrupy, malty goodness I feel that it is surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. Real sweet as the caramel, cinnamon, touches of chocolate, and cherry-like fruit (although w/ label saying apple one could say this beer resembles a strong apple brandy), but also a dry edge as the spices and cinnnamon come into play. I also get a minor citrusy hop bite on the backend, which gives the slightly boozy and warming finish a little crisp snap. This beer was great to sip on and it took me a long time to sip and I think i had a minor buzz but it was worth the price as the sweetness doesn't get grating and kept going down easy and the warming enhanced the sweetness but the beer doesn't get too boozy.","clayrock81","Sep 25, 2011"

Bready tones the first time, spiceness the second, alchol, some fruitness, a bit of the hops, it offeres a variety in every sense of the word. the taste is big, thick, full of alcohol, which is not even remotely hidden here. Lots of dark fruits and berries can be found in here if you look. Grassy tones, apricot, pear, very complex and lots of flavors seem to be battling each other.

Spot on with that comment Deuane, thanks again for sharing!","stakem","Beers"
3.72,1.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Had on tap at an Oktoberfest event in MD. Wow. Pours mahogany with a small tan head. Aroma is of fruit, honey, wheat, and spice. There is not much alcohol in the aroma, which is surprising. Taste is of very dry honey, dark fruit especially raisins, and wheat. Lingering taste of sugary, dark fruit. The alcohol is well masked, but you definitely know it is there. It doesn't creep up on you, in facerapes you for the entire beer. Mouthfeel is sticky, but drinks easy. The drinkability given the amount of alcohol is frightening.","CuriousMonk","0"

A 22% booze bomb is the perfect way to end a night, just be sure to split the bottle 8 ways or more... thanks Joe!","emerge077","Feb 02, 2011"
4.67,27.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"A whopper of a beer this is. The biggest I've had from duclaws and undeniably huge. Pours an attractive marmalade brown color with a thin orange tan head. Smell is like marmalade as well. Taste starts out like marmalade but breaks down into cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves finally goin to a thin trace of malts. Considering the strength it has this beer is a rather gentle giant not revealing its huge abv in its taste (I barely noticed any burn). The drinkability of this beer is almost scary but luckily it's huge price and low availability inhibits drinking alot of it","hdofu","Jan 01, 2011"

1.72,-53.1,4,2,1,3,1.5,"Yikes! Not what I expected at all. Tastes like corn syrup with maple flavor added. If Aunt Jemima brewed a beer I imagine this is what I think it would taste like. The beer has good carbonation and a nice look to it but there is way too much unfermented sugar left in this beast. The reason the alcohol is hidden so well is because of the sugar. I don't have a problem with sweet beers either...this one just missed the mark for me.","trafordboy","Jun 17, 2010"
4.77,30,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a medium red/amber color, with a decent amount of carb, I wasn't really expecting much. Smells are sweet malts, slight apple, some clove and other spices. BAM! This beer is awesome, liquid French toast, in an extremly good way! I was not expecting it to be this damn good, there's some cinnamon, vanilla, a lot going on here. Mouthfeel is chewy, very pleasant. The drinkability is incredibly surprising given the abv of this beast. I think this beer might have been the show stealer at our tasting, as no one knew what to expect. So good!","Lukafer","May 26, 2010"

3.95,7.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D- The alcohol is exceptionally hidden... to the end that I would guess this to be a 12% ABV beer in a blind tasting. This makes for a fantastic dessert beer and/or nightcap.","jgasparine","May 05, 2010"

3.53,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The drowsiness is catching up to me, and without the music I had earlier, I can't think of a good lead-in for this brew. Dammit. Well, let's go this route: I bought this bottle based on the intriguing description on the label and the strangely high ABV (and equally high price tag...). Now, I'm not sure what an epic beer ought to look like, but this one does not appear all that impressive: a surprisingly clear garnet with a minimal amount of fuzzy head. Impressive? Nope, but pretty nonetheless. The smell, on the other hand, comes across exactly according to expectations: heavy alcohol tones, bordering on the kind of antiseptic you are bombarded by during every visit to a hospital or old folks' home, o'ershadowing some sugary maple, honey, and cherry highlights. You can definitely tell this guy's gonna hurt ya. Not quite, surprisingly. Yes, there's still a kick o' the 'hol, but it's not as bad as expected. Instead, the honey, cherry, sour apple, and maple flavors come through in a big way, creating some sort of syrup combo (cough and pancake) that strains the buds to their very limits. I'm stuck between opposing positions here: I'm not happy with the flavors, but, at the same time, I don't hate them either. It's both, the epitome of a love-hate tasting. My tongue is like the woman from "Chinatown" or the plastic surgeon from "The Venture Brothers". Confusion reigns, but it is clear that these flavors are not sticky and are also not hampered by anywhere near excessive carbonation, but they do sort of malinger for a while during a very long, dry finish. Honestly, I don't think I could guzzle this if I wanted to, and I'm kinda glad about it. Still, I'm thankful for the experience.","TMoney2591","Mar 26, 2010"

3.5,-4.6,4,4,3.5,4,2.5,"I was ill-prepared for this beast. I had no idea I was coming face to face with such grotesque (twisted) fruit and floral flavors. Difficult to pick a fruit exactly, it seemed like some chaotic combination of prunes, rosepetals, allspice/ginger/instant cider, peach/mango, some red and green jolly ranchers, robitussin, and cotton candy.. Yeah, I'm not standing by that as scientific but it's somewhere in that arena in terms of sugary-floral-sickly-sweetness. This was an issue at first because prior to opening I was thinking bitterness, brandy, no. It should be noted that my sweettooth is pretty weak... yeah, keep your rumplemints, gran marnier, and jaegar. The sweetness was so unexpected that at first my crutch to deal with it was some homemade jalapeno salsa which I'd have intermittently through the first couple oz's. That leveled it out quite well, and at the point I had waded in past my balls, I was able to drink it like a normal human. By the end, I had finally come to enjoy the bizarre and extreme concoction, both for its uniqueness and for the wallop it was giving my tongue, and its medicinal warming. I have a feeling that like many things, a beer of this stature is an acquired taste. It was remarkable how well-disguised the alcohol is, considering. Now that I know what I'm up against, I think I'm ready for another bout with this one to get a better reading, and for nuking it, which I didn't know was possible. And yes that will then be a shot, which might even need a chaser. Obviously drinkability is low for the average brute, unless you drink gran marnier shots with breakfast. Everyone should buy this if they see it to reckon with it's unique presentation when normal human beer seems boring, or to make drinking a 22 with a pal more akin to a sporting event of straight-face keeping.","willPS21","May 30, 2009"

I wasn't impressed with the price! $35/bottle! I could by 4 120 minute IPA from Dogfish head for that price and still have the same ABV content. It's worth having once though. I didn't get a chance to warm it to 105 degrees like the bottle recommends to taste the warm apple pie effect. This bottle if sipped will accomodate two people without a problem, so get someone to split the cost with you.
