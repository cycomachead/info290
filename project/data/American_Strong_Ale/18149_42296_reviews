"Tried this at the brewery this weekend and it's phenomenal! The Brandy barrels sweeten it up just a touch compared to the original but it didn't get cloying."
""
""
"Plenty of licorice, cinnamon, and dried plums. The barrel aged aspect of it is its saving grace, otherwise I would not drink it. Prefer the Bourbon Barrels Aged version."

"Im sure dome will disagree but this vintage was the reason ""barleywine should still be made", as a great brewmaster said. Really lucky to get to try this in great company."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very flavorful and strong beer to sip on for a long time."
""
"Had a recent tasting of this beer again. It was perfect in every way. The smell was vanilla, toffee, molasses, sweet balsamic vinegar and caramel, the taste was more of the same with malty sweetness, no roasted bitterness, well balanced with alcohol heat at the finish. Enjoyed this beer at 55F temp, a perfect sipper. Would pick up whenever available. Better than than the Bourbon Barrel version which i also love."

"Bottle at Falling Rock Tap House in Denver. Pours pitch black and inky with no head whatsoever. Aroma is sweet brandy and some light anise, molasses, more sweet sugar. Flavor follows with thick brandy and molasses flavors, some light oakiness, burnt caramel, very sweet. Nearly no carbonation in this one, and on the sweet side which cuts through the thickness and puts things a bit on the cloying side. Big bodied though. I definitely liked the bourbon version better than this one, but would be nice on a winter day."

"Overall - I suspected this might be infected and/or flat. I got both. Anyway, I think I've had this beer on tap a couple times, but I can't remember, so this is the experience I can rate."

"O: 12% alcohol is not present, which is impressive. That said, this is disappointing after the bourbon barrel aged version, and I wasn't expecting it to be as good (bourbon Angel's Share is one of my favorite beers). THAT said, this is a really good beer, recommended, but worth a try? At $15, I'm not sure..."

"bottle from 2008 is drinking extremely well right now. tried side by side with cuvee de tomme, a once in a lifetime opportunity. dark brown in color, sludgy thick, very little visible carbonation. a nose like a fine cognac, with warming but not caustic alcohol intensity. lots of layered sugars and spices here from vanilla to clove to nutmeg to brown butter richness, this has a whole lot going on. i get some nice oak sweetness and mellowness in there too, but to me this is a little less interesting than the bourbon barrel edition, which stands as one of my favorite beers of all time. the brandy flavors have maybe worn off a bit with age, so i get the oak and the booze without all the flavor i got from the bourbon barrel. still. the angels share is a ridiculous beer in its own right, so i have no complaints really at all. smooth as velvet with warming booze, almost no carbonation, but it isnt missed. a little goes a long way here with this incredibly rich and strong flavor experience."

"O - Sweet, syrupy, dark fruit with no carbonation. No thanks."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the lack of carbonation pretty much ruined what seems like it would be an excellent beer. I would never be able to pick out the brandy barrel aging, but it does seem complex."

"Overall: A solid beer, the brandy barrels gave this some really nice flavor. The age has made this very smooth and thankfully it still has a bit of carbonation. Definitely a pleasant beer with some nice flavor, especially if you are a brandy fan."
""
""
""
"This would be a world class beer if some issues were dealt with, I've only had a few beers from this brewery but I've noticed a trend"

"Overall: I had huge expectations for my first Lost Abbey beer. Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed. I wanted to pour it down the drain, but ended up finishing the bottle. I just couldn't stand the thought of pouring 15 bucks down the drain. I even tried letting it warm a bit, in the hopes that it would get better, but it just didn't. I would not recommend this. After going back and reviewing the beer notes on the Lost Abbey website, I won't write off the brewery just yet. This is for those of you who crave the experimental beers!"
""
"Overall, a real treat. Age helps it for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one seriously complex beer. I mean there are a ton of things going on in the nose and flavor. Huge aroma of chocolate and oak hit me like a ton of lead. After warming up a bit more sweeter notes came out like brown sugar and a vinous profile came out. An oil mouth feel that was slick, yet sublime at the same time. Flavors were, like the nose, incredibly complex with the same notes as above and a sweet character but balanced by a wine-line tannic kick. I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: fairly disappointing u ad heard a lot about the lost Abby and this was my first beer from them i'll defiantly try another but this particular one I would not recommend"
""
"375ml bottle: 2009 vintage: This one pours an inky, opaque brown color. It is absolutely still: no carbonation at all. Nice nose to it. I definitely get a whiff of the brandy. A little musty aroma. Definitely some dark fruits in there, with a little plum on top. Lots of caramel malts. Very nice taste. Thick caramel, some of the brandy, Lots of mingled dark fruits, some coffee notes. Oak notes also. It doesn’t suffer at all from the lack of carbonation. Very Nice!"

"O: After sipping on this for a bit I have to assume it's infected. It's just pure tart/sour fruit and a little caramel. Boy was this a waste of money. Let's try the bourbon version, maybe it can redeem itself. As for this one, I drain poured it."
""
""
""
"A vigorous pour produces a viscous black liquid with a handful of bubbles that dissipate almost instantly. Smells of oaky vanilla with a boozy edge. Hints of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit and tobacco round out the nose quite nicely. The flavor is sweet like an aged barleywine. Sweet sugar and caramel mixed with some vinous notes. A touch of ethanol and a nice flavor of dark fruits, grapes, chocolate, and tobacco. Medium to thick body with a sweet syrupy mouthfeel and not a lick of carbonation. I've sat on this bottle for quite some time fearing the disappointment that would ensue with the inevitable flat bottle. The lack of carbonation ruins the mouthfeel on this beer and makes a sweet beer even stickier. This smells wonderful! It's too bad I couldn't get a proper sample of this beer because I'll bet its really great!"

"How about if I host a tasting of lost abbey (tomme will you come?)"
"O: it was an 09 vintage and it was still pretty hot, I honestly thought it would have mellowed out somewhat; still tasty though."
""
""
"Edit: I drank the whole thing! Not sure if it was a train wreck that I just couldn't turn away from, or if I couldn't bear to pour so much $$$ down the drain ;-)"
"Poured very aggressive into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottled in 2010. Pours a very dark brown, with no head at all and subsequently no lace. Smell is dark fruits, molasses, whiskey, and vanilla. Taste is not correct, thinking this is tainted. No pop at all with the cork and a very flat and stale tasting beer. Very sour and boozy and this was my daughter's celebration beer. Going to contact brewery. Body thin, terrible carbonation, not sure if it is dry, and going down the sink, what does that say about drinkability? Trying to figure out what to drink now."
"Overall not nearly as good as the bourbon, but worth a try. Such an interesting beer."
"Pours an almost opaque brown-black with no head and no lace. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, raisins, dark fruits, vanilla, brandy, and wood. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish and a woody aftertaste that lingers after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is good beer that smells better than it tastes. I just wish the carbonation level was better."
"O- A major disappointment from The Lost Abbey, especially at the massive price point. The bourbon version is much better, but either way, these angel's share versions are really expensive for what you get."
""
"O- what a disaster. I've had this on tap and it was great, this was terrible. Tastes like 3 shots of Sambuca made it into the small bottle"
""
"and much better than kbs. on par with 2 fantastic beers, central waters bbb and weyerbacher insanity."
""
""
""
"As is? Drain pour and at $14.99 a pop, a rip off. I should have listened to my instincts on this.... I now know why there were 3 more on the shelves..."

"Review from 1/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours dark, dark red brown amber. No head or carbonation. Rich aroma of brandy, dark fruits, malt and alcohol. Nice. Dark fruits with an emphasis on plums, brandy, some sherry notes. Heavy bodied and complex. Finishes sweet and boozy. A pleasant complex strong ale. This will definitely be interesting to age. It needs a bit more carbonation to rate higher, but I'll still get this again."
"O-an interesting strong ale, but too much brandy and no carbonation of note"
""
""
"O - This is a nice beer. Don't know if this was how it was intended, but it certainly was interesting."
""
"I think this was a good brew, but it's gone bad. And the fact that it's still means they actually bottled it this way?"
""
""
"overall: tasty - more interesting than the bourbon version, but not as good"
""
"Overall while this one smells nice nothing else about it stands out in a good way. A huge miss by Lost Abbey and a waste of money at $16.00"
"Overall this was a nice beer to sample and one I was quite excited for as I newly found out I like brandy quite a bit, but the lack of carbonation and heavy oak makes it a task to consume an entire bottle, even over a 3 hour period. Much more suited for the new smaller 375 bottles but a touch more carbonation and restrained barrel flavors would have made this much more approachable and enjoyable."
""
""
"O - Very disappointing, especially at the $20 price point. Not recommended. I really wanted to like this beer, but it let me down on too many levels. This brew was a total mess."
"Smells interesting, likely infected, but a bit of sour mash, maltiness and odd musty barrel character. Taste touches on these notes with a bit of tartness and a mealy unpleasant taste as well. Thin and tart, the drain drank more of this than I did :("
"Notes: What a pity… Either Lost Abbey was trying to pull off a provocative barrel sour/wild ale or this one is very much infected. It really does not work very well either way.. Stimulating at first, tiresome rather quickly as it was asking to meet the drain... What an amazing disconnect between nose and palate… Sure, there is a link, but a thin and veiled one. And of course, all things considered, it feels like I paid waaay too much for this one. Wondering if this is an off quality-control bottle."
"O - Was really looking forward to this beer and it turned out to be a very expensive drain pour."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer though i feel it came off a tad flat. Exquisite complexities from the barrel aging "
""

""
""
"Rating 1700! 375 millimeter bottle sampled at RBWG 2010 - shared by kp, I believe! Huge Wow this is amazing. Dark reddish/brown pour with a small tan head that fades fast. The aroma and flavor are both awesome vanilla, apples, coconut, barrel, and so much more. Amazing stuff!"
""
""
"O: not a bad beer, I prefer the brany version above the bourbon version !"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was one of the notorious ""flat abbey"" beers back in 2008 and 3 years of aging certainly hasn't helped it improve."
"D: Perhaps it’s because I’m not familiar with the way brandy tastes, but this beer was very different from anything I’ve had before. If you’re looking for a new experience, this is a good choice."
""
"O: This beer smells good but it fails in pretty much all other respects. I like a lot of the other beers from this brewery, but this one is just not for me. I would avoid this one."
""
""
"O - Such a superb Strong Ale, 2009 was a great year for both this and the Bourbon version. Not sure why this gets so much hate, but I suppose I'll try the '10 Vintage to see."
"Really great beer is grounded due to complete lack of carbonation. horrible mouthfeel almost makes me want to drainpour this beer, but the flavors are just so spot on I can't bring myself to do it. Great attempt at something that really could have been special, but just falls oh so short."
""
"D - It's inspired and bold, but I find the brandy to be overbearing, masking some of the more subtle characters of the beer. It hides its ABV well, but it's still a sipper."
"This beer has a lot of complexity, but tough to get around the utter lack of carbonation. Comes across as flat and somewhat lifeless."
""
"Dr: Very drinkable for the high ABV. I'd never know it was 11.5%. I really like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn shame, this beer is amazing if not for the lack of carbonation."
""
""
"O- I didn't know what to expect with this. Very complex very tasty but seriously lacking because of the carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brandy-aged Angel’s Share is damn good stuff. The brandy works better than the bourbon, I think; the liquor at at least melds better with the bright, barleywine-style flavors of the underlying brew. Shame that uncarbonated bottles ruin this beer's ranking. It's a great, with the proper amount of bubbles."
""
""
"O - Well, I WAS really psyched for this one, but because of how flat it was, it pretty much took everything away from this beer, except the nose. And for paying $22 for a 375 ml bottle, I was actually pretty pissed. Hopefully LA actually does something about their bottle QC."

"I look forward to current vintages that do have successful bottle conditioning. The flatness ruins the whole drinking experience. You can taste how good this could be, it just isn't there without the carbonation."
""

"12.7 ounce (375 ml) caged and corked bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky brown color with no head and no lacing at all. The cork was on the bottle tight, but once I got it out and there was no ""pop", I figured this would be a flat bottle. The brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, molasses and caramel. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a red grape and a bit of a weird tart fruit flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick with pretty much no carbonation. I'm lucky I didn't get a totally infected bottle of this, it could have been a lot worse. This wasn't an awful beer, but it wasn't really enjoyable either. I'd like to try a good bottle of this brew at some point in the future, but that's not going to happen anytime soon after drinking this one."
"Overall: This beer has mellowed a bit over the past two years. There is no carbonation/head, but the flavors are very complex. The mouth is enjoyable, with only a hint of alcohol which is impressive for such a high ABV beer. Well done."
"The overall flavor is decent, but the base beer is too overpowered by the brandy barrel aging. A little more subtlety would have been nice, but I guess I should just be glad there is enough carbonation to allow me to drink it. Unfortunately I don't think I would ever recommend this beer to anyone. Carbonated or not, it's never going to be worth such a high price tag."
" Overall this is a pretty tasty brew it's just a shame it's flat and pretty damn expensive! I really wish I could try this carbonated,cause I think it would be killer."
"Probably the last Lost Abbey brew I will ever purchase, I just can't comprehend the lack of giving a crap about the qc of their brews."
"Overall: It would be interesting to try this beer if it was not totally flat."
"Enjoyed it dispite little to no carbonation. Not sure it's $15.00 worth. If the price drops I'll consider purchasing more."
"O: This beer tastes great, but there are several portions of it which have you asking questions."
"O: I'm on the fence if this is an infected bottle or not. It's not over the top with off flavors, but I don't think it's supposed to taste like this. The tart flavor was intriguing at first, but got old after a quarter of the bottle. I hate to pour out something this pricy, but there's other stuff in my fridge I'd rather be drinking."
"Anyway we opened the bottle and it was poured into a wine glass, fitting for this brew because it looked just like a dark red wine as it poured out. The beer had no head on it at all. The smell was very rich with lots of sweet boozy aromas. We drank this one slowly trying to savor everything we could in this. The flavors of sweet brandy and the dark malts gave this beer a very unique flavor. The mouthfeel was a little flat and didn't really spark my interest too much... It finished with a dry aftertaste and was a little on the boring side I thought. Overall I'd like to try it fresh, not sure how old the bottle was that we had but I would enjoy having it right from the brewery."
"O: This seems to be a polarizing brew for sure, and I can definitely see why. I respect it, but don't particularly care for it."
"Two things kill this beer. Lack of any carbonation, and just the odd taste. Boy am I pissed that I bought multiple bottles of this shit. Didn't realize it was the Brandy at the time. Lesson learned."
"Overall impression: Perhaps the most disjointed drinking experience I’ve ever had. Looks like crap, smells great, tastes OK but suffers immensely from flatness. Sadly, it seems a few tweaks away from excellence. Correction: one tweak away. That tweak, of course, being carbonation."
"O: Very tasty. Although mini-carbonation it is quite a good brew. Good as well as complex, but develops quite a bit as it warms."
"O: Don't bother with brandy angel's share; it really doesn't go well. The mouthfeel alone kills it with the flatness, but the heat and lack of interesting flavor are enough to mock the price. Far too expensive for the experience. Had the bourbon before and it was much better, would love to try the grand cru."
"This is tasty with or without carbonation. I'll take it either way. I do wonder how much more I might like it with a bit of carbonation though."
"This one is flat. That sucks, but it's makes up for that with flavor. Make no mistake, this is a rich beer but it is darn tasty. A little bit of carbonation would easily put this at the top of the charts."
"O- I was very let down by this beer, I’ve heard mixed reviews, and all the low carbonation stories that I’ve heard definitely apply to this beer. Under carbonated to a point where it affects the beer, I’ve never had an infected beer, but this one tastes like it might be, the sour notes come out so strong and really take away from the experience. I tried my best to finish this bottle but the taste was just too much, had to drain pour."
"This is a very special beer, like other strong barrel aged ones it is best after dinner, as a strong wine."
"Terrible disappointment."
"Overall, this is a beer that highlights tastes boldly that I have only experienced hints of previously. I believe its at its peak now, can't imagine this keeping much longer and still being carbonated. A bad mofo of a beer, and this is a sipper worthy of a very intellectual conversation."
"Overall is really good."
"A $16 disaster. I have never had a ""good"" version of this beer, but I will never again risk paying this much money if THIS is my reward."
"Overall, its pretty good- but over priced."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy Lunch for sending me this one in a past trade! 2009 Vintage! Tasted back-to-back-to-back with Bourbon and Grand Cru. Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a murky dark brown with a basically non-existant off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, massively sweet alcohol (brandy, yum!), and subtle peat. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, very sweet alcohol (more brandy!), and subtle peat. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. I enjoyed this one quite a bit more than its bourbon counterpart. This could have to do with the fact that I enjoy Brandy over Bourbon, but this one was just much sweeter and more inviting. Definitely great flavor and aroma going on here. Really glad I got the chance to try this along-side the Bourbon version for comparison, but this one definitely took the cake between the two."
"This beer was interetsing, but definetly not what I expected or hoped for. Especially for the price."
"Overall remarkable, but even a small bottle is plenty."
"Pours a black-ish color with a small tan to no head. In the aroma, dark fruit,, brandy notes and hints of alcohol. In the taste, brandy, small oak notes and alcohol taste in the end. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to sweet brandy like aftertaste. Big brandy presence, small oak notes, and its a sipper."
"O: Not bad. The lack of carbonation makes me a bit worried, but it seems to taste good so I'm willing to keep drinking."
"O- I was a little disappointed, not impressed with the balance. This may have been a bad bottle, I will have to muster up the courage to try this one again."
"Well made, tasty as all get out but hindered to a certain extent but the low low carbonation. Still, a nice sipper for a cooler evening. Happy with the purchase."
"O: The most wine-like barleywine I've ever encountered. I loved it, but it's not for everyone. Personally, I'd buy another bottle or three, but I'd be cautious about recommending it."
"- It is such a shame that at this time the beer is so under carbonated. The look of the beer suffered greatly because of the lack of head, lacing, and stability. The mouth feel suffered because it became only a bit watery feeling because of the lack of carbonation as well. Everything else about the beer is stellar. I can't seem to understand why after so many years of this beer being under carbonated, that the issue hasn't been resolved. I am guessing that the yeast in the bottle and some time on my other bottle will hopefully take care of this issue years down the road though I am not keeping my hopes up. Taste and smell though is like no other."
"O: Glad to have finally tried this one. Overall, it's a really good and complex beer. Could be overhyped a bit but then again I wouldn't pass up another bottle if I found one!"
"Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit!"
"D - This is basically bottled jack and coke - for fifteen dollars. Honestly... for the price I am very disappointed. If the bottle was five dollars, I'd be less bitter and never buy it again because I'm not a huge fan. For the price I expected more, but this just isn't very good. I'm disappointed and saddened."
"Overall: Well worth drinking, but I feel that the three years it's had in the bottle have been good for it, but much more I feel that it would start to slip. A great beer overall, though, I will always support Tomme when I get the chance."
"Pours like the usual, flat Angel's Share. Aroma is very intense dark molasses, chocolate, loads of delicious dark fruit and fruitcake, blackcurrant, and straight up port. Taste is caramelized sugar, intense cocoa, oak, and vanilla bean; very port and sherry like. No carbonation docks the flavors a touch. Mouthfeel is round and full bodied, again port-like. Incredible aroma, sucks that it's flat but otherwise a superb beer."
"Overall: A good beer. I am so glad it was not completely flat or infected. I enjoy it though I do not know if the risk of the aforementioned problems is worth the dollar amount. A lot of alcohol warmth, I would love this on a cold winter night."
"An incredible display of art in the glass. So many incredible flavors and aromas all come together for a near masterpiece of a beer."
"D- Very smooth. A lot of barrel character. Maybe more barrel present than I like, but still a great beer. Im just thankful I got to try it with carbonation."
"O - Disappointed considering the cost. I expected a lot more and was left with a sour, non-carbonated mess."
"Overall - What a waste of $14. I'll never buy this again. My friend bought two, and he's not happy."
"overall: This seems to be a very good beer with the aging potential to be great."
"O - The good news is that this isn't infected, but the bad news is that overall it's underwhelming. After a couple years, the booze is still present and sharp, the wood is burnt and harsh and the appearance and mouthfeel are subpar. The brandy is very subdued compared to a year or so ago."
"O: ""The Tomme"" needs someone to introduce him to ""The Refund"". Total palette-wrecking wallet rape and ruin-er of what could have been a great night of drinking. The only thing worse than these two bottles of beer is the realization that I still have another one waiting, taking up space where my $50 used to be."
"O: I actually liked this one a lot more than I would have thought, and this made a great sipper over a few hours. Better than the bourbon in my opinion."
"D-The alcohol burn fades a little as it warms to room temp., but it still lingers which really hurts the drinkability for me. I do enjoy the flavor profile, though the price point is really discouraging me from trying this one again."
"Overall it's not very good and I won't seek it out again."
"Drink- For the money I spent on this it was well worth not shelling out for the whole bottle. I wouldve been dissapointed. This was tasty, different and a bit complex. Would like the other variants."
"O: Better than I expected given the bashing it has received. With carbonation this beer would be an A+ for me, and even without any I am still digging it."
"Pours a dark brown with mahogany highlights, starts with very small cap of khaki head, gone very quick. Scent is rich and complex... notes of brandy, port wine, chocolate, fig, prune, oak, vanilla, lightly burnt carmel. Taste combines all scattered notes of scent perfectly, rich, deep dark and complex - a definite sipper. Full bodied, lower carbonation. The burbon version works a little bit better with the make up of the beer (deep and dark) while the brandy version adds a little bit of brightness. Draft adds more to the experience in body for sure as opposed to bottle."
"Poured into a tulip glass, a nice, cloudy, dark brown, with a small beige head that retains well throughout the drink. Little to no carbonation visible. LOVED the aroma! Big, big chocolate smell, with a definite boozy presence, and underlying dark fruits. Taste of chocolate, alcohol, and dark dried fruits up front, prunes, black cherries, raisins; molasses and brown sugar following, with the brandied-oak finishing things off with a bite, and not quite dry. Tasted best when allowed to sit and reach closer to room temperature. Full bodied, strong, and very drinkable, but not for the weak of heart."
"O: This is one of the worst beers I've ever had. I took two sips and poured the rest. Absolutely horrid. I've become more and more leery of all LA beers. Tomme - take care of the issue."
"Good beer. Curious about it without this much aging and with more, also"
"Overall. I have a feeling the bottle was bad not sure though, Not sure if its worth the $16 price point."
"Overall, not a bad beer, I would like to try the bourbon barrel one. Not sure I would pluck down $15 again for this one, but I don't regret it."
"Overall: a bit underwhelmed...I may have to compare to the bourbon aging..."
"O: Overall the flavor is pretty good, but I would like to see what this beer would be like carbonated."
"What a difference a little carbonation makes. Much of the same look, aroma, and flavor profiles as my previous bottle review, but the carbonation makes the difference between a great tasting but palpably strange and visibly flat brew and a world class brew. Fair head and lace. Aroma and taste, think port with all of the oak, prune, and molasses characteristics. Throw in a lively feel from the carbonation. Add to this a bittersweet back end. You've got a spectacular beer. If there were a consistency rating, this brewery would get a 1."
"Not a bad beer, but doesn't match the complexity and smoothness of the Bourbon version."
"Taste, nice, a little sweeter than the bourbon version, a definite sipper. Licorice and chocolate seem there. Wood flavors. Raisins. I think I like the blended version better."
"I've seen a lot of ho-hum reviews of this beer but I believe when it's properly carbonated, it can be excellent. It will be interesting to see how the corked bottle in the cellar compares to the tap version."
"I'm glad to finally have an Angel's Share on tap; a brilliant ale from Lost Abbey."
"This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation leaning towards low but it is fitting and enjoyable or this offering. Any more carb and it might have been distracting. Lots of flavor and depth to this sipper. Overall very enjoyable and easy drinking considering the big abv."
"I have read the reviews and honestly I was hesitant to open this one up when I realized it was the brandy version. I've tried Deliverance and was impressed but this was one of my most unpleasant beer experiences lately and by far my lowest scoring review."
"Full syrupy body, lower carbonation (but absolutely not flat), sticky and chewy. Great flavor, nice barrel integration, very rich but an excellent beer."
" The flavor is wonderfully nutty and dessert-like with lots of caramel and dark wood w/ a moderate amount of toffee and mild spice and nut in the flavor w/ toastiness and alcohol mingling amongest the slight creamy taste of the malt. There is a subtle vanilla and mild bitter malt flavor that compliments the mild barrel tannin level. I found this to be good overall and a incredible difference from the first time I tasted thiss w/ the uncarbonated version a huge letdown. I found this to be the best tasting of all the samples I have tried of Angel's Share -just head and shoulders above even the bourbon version!"
"Overall an exquisite beer. Seek it out, it won't disappoint."
"D - Drinkability is low on this beer. I'm not sure what went so wrong with the beer between the nose and the taste, but contrast is striking. Tantalizing aroma, but a trainwreck of flavors with no carbonation to boot."
"Crap, dead flat no head or bubbles to speak of. Probably skews my view of this beer as a couple of my tasting partners liked it. Had some very interesting prune, raisin and dark fruit flavors. I liked the hint of brandy barrel I got, but it was so sticky cloying and sweet I couldn't look past the fact that it needed some carbonation. Finished with loads of alcohol and caramel."
"Some good bold flavors there, but they're too much when a beer is completely flat. Left half of the pour in the glass on the table when I got up and left."
"O: HUGE disappointment here. I'm glad I got it out of the way, but never again."
"O: Just a hot fucking mess of a beer. I'm not sure carbonation would have saved it for me. Such poor craftsmanship on LA's part makes me sad for anyone who buys this atrocity."
"A hard pour down the middle of the snifter results in, wait, hold it, absolutely no head at all. This is not a propitious sign. Dark brown in color. A few spots of tan lace appear after the glass is slightly shaken. Rich sweet malts, cherries and raisins, some overly soured fruit, damp wood, spent grain and chocolate to the nose. Tastes sweet and near cloying with a big hit of alcohol up front and some chocolate, more dark fruits and spice intermingling. Move vinuos than beer-like with a watery mouth-feel. Just can't get down and make love to this one."
"CHEERS!!"
"Edit: upon opening another bottle, it is slightly sour as well. This beer is a trainwreck. Scores adjusted again."
"Lost Abbey should be ashamed of themselves. If a novice homebrewer like me can carbonate a big barleywine, they can make sure their overpriced beer gets carbonated. I don't expect to give any more money to these amateurs."
"The threads were correct of course, no carbonation, no head, no lacing, sux. Therefore, mouthfeel was way off as well and the total drinkability takes a serious hit, not to mention I paid like $16 or $17 for it. But anyways, just wanted to say the nose was still awesome and the taste wasn't bad at all. I would recommend that anyone that already has an '09 in the cellar pop it now because you're only going to get more disappointed the more time you invest into it. Cheers."
"(D)- This is flat as flat can be. This is very sickly sweet while being horribly off with a charcoal and graphite bitterness. No thank you. I far preferred the Bourbon Barrel variation better especially considering it wasnt flat!"
"glassware: tulip"
"Highly disappointed, as I have tried several other beer by Port/Lost Abbey and have not been disappointed. More than likely I will try this again, but it is tough shelling out $12 for a beer and being completely unsatisfied."
"D: At 18 months out (give or take, don't know exactly when in 2009 this was blended/barreled/bottled), it's hard to imagine this as the brewer's vision. Still quite warm, almost flat and quite sweet, a small bottle is finishable, but only given ample time. I still have another bottle, and will hope that it'll improve. As such, a disappointment, but 'try'-worthy as a reco."
"Carbonation, head and lacing would elevate this beer to a much higher rating. Overall rather disappointing for this reason and certainly not worth the pricetag I paid for it. But the potential for excellence is right there."
"Very solid and I can't complain since its my first angel share. I'm very impressed. Drink with caution."
"D - Great flavor and smell on this brew, fantastic! I enjoyed this one very much. Dont think I can drink more than one in a sitting."
"In the end the worst part to me is seeing all the potential great things in this beer ruined by being completely flat. I'd say if you can find a recent edition of this beer that you know for a fact is carbonated (and is at a reasonable price) give it a shot, otherwise avoid."
"D- Very smooth overall, not to potent on the brandy or to roasted etc. Was a pleasure to have."
"This is a case where they should have made ten the loudest instead of going to eleven. It's overpowering and crass and seriously in need of carbonation."
"Okay, so the 12.00%abv is not very hidden. That's okay, actually. The flavor lends this one to be more like drinking alcohol than beer anyway, so it works out alright. A sipper, to be sure, but enjoyable, nonetheless."
"Still, very glad to have tried it at least once...unfortunately the high price tag will make it difficult to revisit anytime soon."
"Cheers..."
"T: Raisins and some more dark fruits (fig, plum) at first and then some toffee and a hint of leather. A hint of carbonation keeps this one from being too syrupy and thick. Another strong offering from Lost Abbey."
"D: While lacking the sometimes oppressive booziness and bourbon character of standard-issue Angel's Share, this beer nevertheless presents itself as the more fully realized of the two--more appropriate, more balanced (maybe even too balanced), and more enjoyable. Overall, the flavors remain relatively simple, yet smooth, coming together to produce a drinkability that belies the strength."
"Angels share is One of the most complex beers I have ever had. I have a few bottles tucked away in my cellar and I can't wait to do some vertical tasting with the different vintages of brandy and bourbon aged varieties!!"
"D-I could drink several of these, but if I did, I'd be on the floor. In this case, ""D" is for Dangerous."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer and I found the base beer was augmented very well by the barrel. Well worth a shot."
"D - This is a decent beer but a little over-the-top. The lack of carbonation is hurtful for both the beer and the brewery that doesn't seem to care. Another year or two to mellow this one out would be nice."
"D- Fairly high, given the obvious ABV. Very enjoyable. Would like to try this on-tap or with a bottle that fully bottle-conditioned."
"Thanks Ratman for finally giving me the opportunity to try this one. Having very much enjoyed both the bourbon version and the grand cru, I was excited to try this one; I was not disappointed. Poured a deep, dark brown color, with just a touch of medium brown foam. Aromas of red grapes, booze, brandy and raisins. Thick and full bodied, mouth coating and very boozy, with brandy, brown sugar, oak, vanilla and alcohol."
"This beer is actually really good - but probably only for people who like big boozy, brandy flavor. Funny enough, I had it after it had sat down for a year, so I imagine that it would be unacceptably boozy fresh."
"Maybe I'm biased on this as I love brandy and have been waiting to try this for quite some time. Yes it's flat which hurts the score overall but I think the flavor is just about perfect, perhaps a bit sweet"
"Tried the bourbon version, now on to it's cousin. It pours a nearly opaque black-brown topped by a sputter of off-white foam. The nose comprises oak, whiskey, toffee, butterscotch, raisins, and molasses. The taste brings more of the same, though the whiskey has transmogrified into brandy, some chocolate is added, and there is a distinct alcoholic burn in the back. The body is a straight medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a very nice brew, though the heavy brandy and oak notes and the more-than-palpable burn detract a good deal. Still, I liked this one more than I did the bourbon version."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with carbonation, but no head. It honestly looks like a cola in the glass. The smell is pretty potent on the fumes of brandy. Other detectable notes would be the oak, brown sugar, and raisins. The taste was pretty damn good. The aromatics matched the flavor dead on, but the brandy mixed with the raisin oak flavor was in such a way that it was like candy on my tongue. The problem was, it wasn't candy, it was brandy. And as it turns out just like this beer brandy burns going down. This was still a little rough on the palate, my opinion is that it needed a couple of years to mellow out. It was still a very enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability: The QPR here, initially, can seem like a bit much. But with the care taken to make this brew, I think it's easy to understand how it's so expensive. Today's my birthday, after all, and though other brews could've been cracked open, or this one could've been saved for another year, I just had to try it, and I'm glad I did. There's a lot to admire here. I've had nothing but good experiences so far with Lost Abbey, and I hope to have more in the future. If you're a brandy fan, and you see this, pick up a bottle. In the future, I'm going to do my best to make sure I can get a bottle of the bourbon-barreled version."
"I just deleted my first and only review of this beer...This is a huge sign of grace, because it was one of the worst beer I've ever had. It was a solid mass of malty bukakke and I wish that $19 and an hour of my life was given back somehow, but that is LIFE! You live, grow, and become something better. Same with this beer. Haters gon hate!"
"D - The year really helped this strong ale out. Flavours have melded very nicely to create a very solid ale. Smooth, creamy, and potent with nice complex flavours but would still benefit from more aging."
"D: I really enjoy this beer but am afraid that it is more of a sipper than anything. The ABV is high and is very present (one of the aspects that makes it so enjoyable). Enjoy one."
"I've had several bottles since that time, at least one of which was completely flat, and on tap once which was nice. I'm dropping my original scores a bit as you simply can't trust that bottles of this will be carbonated, even lightly. Some were outright dead."
"Drinkability: This is a big beer, no doubt about it, but the lack of carbonation is really hurting it. However, it is tasty, so I would give it the benefit of the doubt and say that other batches of this brew are significantly more drinkable than this one, so I will rate this part as such. I would certainly seek out other batches to give it a try."
"The feel of beer is heavy bodied, and it's best to be prepared for it. It will sneak up on you if you take it too lightly. It slowly goes into a gradual lowering of flavor. It hits then drops, slowly with a smooth texture and a nice kick. It is the beer you will talk about for time to come."
"Tough to know how to rate this on mouthfeel, as it was almost, if not completely, flat. Must a beer be carbonated? In this case, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Certainly a sipping beer - sweet malt notes with a distinct brandy character from the barrel - something to be shared after dinner in snifters."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable despite the hotness. The dry finish provides some relief and might allow me to indulge in a couple of these."
"D- A sipper for sure. I like this one a bit different."
"overall: a nice beer to drink every once and a while I would drink this 2 times a year no more but its enjoyable"
"Drinkability- How does one score something that they would drink again in a heartbeat but would probably not drink two of in a session? This for me is the hardest category for a bold beer, but I woulds say it rated high as I always wanted to enjoy another sip."
"D: I am happy I tried this, but wouldn't go running back to the bar for more."
"Drinkability: This is a one-and-done type of beer, but it is one that I come back to again and again. Very enjoyable!"
"D: I would certainly have another and really the smellability of this beer tips the drinkability scales for me. I absolutely loved the scent. This is a very interesting and complex beer."
"D-Amazing flavors that aren't overbearing. Great mouthfeel. A sipper that you can't sip because it taste too damn good!"
"if this has bubbles, it would be a solid A, maybe even an A+. amazing flavors through out"
"The nuances of this are very good and keeps me coming back for more."
"Overall, it's interesting with a lot of complex flavors, but it's way too over the top for me, esp in alcohol and sweetness - more like a liquor than a beer. Tastes a bit like plum or fig cough medicine."
"D- Strong brew, not the faint of palette. Intense flavors, especially of brandy, not for Natty Ice drinkers. Requires a earned appreciation for strong, intense beers. If that's your bag, definitely seek this one out. If not, you probably aren't going to dig the Angel's Share."
"Pours a very dark muddy brown that shines with ruby highlights when held up to the sunlight. Carbonation is very low, but luckily it is not completely flat like some Lost Abby beers tend to be. The low carbonation means that there is little to no head, but when swirled, a tan foam forms and gives me an idea of what could have been. The nose on this beer is effing incredible. It has plenty of rich chocolate right up front that gives way to, brandy, molasses and a nice earthiness. I also detect a hint of burnt sugar and a bit of Belgian yeast spiciness. Swirling brings out more brandy and some musty smells. The aromas mingle very well, and the sum is definitely greater than that of the individual parts. The flavor is not quite as potent or deep as the aroma. Once again it has plenty of cocoa, but the chocolate flavor lacks the richness that is present in the smell. Other flavors include brandy, molasses, burnt sugar, toffee, and oak. As one would expect, this beer is pretty hot, with a noticeable alcohol component, but it is also strangely dry. The mouthfeel is medium to full and very smooth with a finish that is equally smooth and enjoyable. This beer is one to be savored for sure, but I think it hides its considerable strength quite well. If I was going to take drinkability literally, I would have to mark it down because I would be content to just smell this beer all day. Truly a wonderful beer that I will likely seek out again, even with the premium price tag."
"An enjoyable, contemplative brew."
"Note: I am now drinking the 2009 on 4/1/11 and have gotten over the lack of carbonation and decided just to focus on the flavors. While I am going to leave the ratings from the 2008 alone, I have to say that I am rather enjoying the taste of this one. The port-like character of the aroma and the taste is enticing and, while there is some booziness, it has mellowed into a flavorful melange."
"I hate to rate drinkability."
"Overall, a well crafted beer that would go over well with liquor lovers. I appreciated the layers of complexity in this."
"Excellent brew. This is what I've hoped for from The Lost Abbey, & what I hadn't found yet. Top-notch beer that I'd happily have again."
"Hot and slow to drink. For a beer, ok. For the price, a travesty. I'd rather put that kind of loot towards a good bottle of booze."
"Overall a good beer that I enjoyed sipping on this evening. Could use some improvement in the appearance and mouthfeel categories in relation to carbonation though. My overall rating definitely won't reflect how much I enjoyed this one given the high weight appearance has."
"I really do like this, but the lack of carbonation and the hot hot alcohol make this an absolute sipper with no room for leeway. If the two problems with this beer could be fixed, this would be an overall A or higher for me."
"Lack of carbonation seems the norm for Lost Abbey, and I won't be buying or trading for any more of their beers until I see this addressed. A Belgian-inspired brewing company with undercarbonation problems makes no sense to me."
"D: Complex no doubt but this beer could really do with a bit of carbonation. Not only to enhance the appearance but also awaken the muted flavors and liven the palate. Alcohol is definitely noticeable even for its high ABV. I'd definitely give this one another chance. With some carbonation and age to tone down the heat, it could no doubt be phenomenal."
"The brew is OK, but nothing exciting. Certainly not worth the price that was paid. Rather unimpressed."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had."
"Some issues with the look and feel aside, this was a warming tasty sipper. The brandy added an extra fruity layer of welcome complexity to this that worked well with the vanilla and green tannic character of the barrel. This was nice."
"Pours a murky dark Brown with virtually no head but looks silky smooth as it enters the glass. Smells of Browned butter, dark fruits, brandy, dark rum, and biscuits. the taste is great, Dark candied fruits soaked in brandy on top of sweet biscuity cake. Chocolate, caramel, vanilla and some nuttiness rounds it all out Mouthfeel was wonderful to me, almost no carbonation but so silky smooth! So what if it is not what you expected, not every beer has to be carbonated as much. Maybe it could have had more but I can not understand people getting so up in arms about it. Not sure about all the controversy surrounding this one but I think LA did a fantastic job as usual. Very full bodied beautiful Beer!!"
"2008 edition. I won't go into any long diatribe about how much this beer sucked, nor will I address the debate about whether it should have been released or whether the brewery took ownership of the problems with this beer and reasonably addressed them. I will say that I am very, very disappointed by this beer and do think Lost Abbey ought to have been more proactive in dealing with quality control issues with Sinners rather than having the few who initiated resolution of the issue be taken care of, but no one else. When this brewery is good, their beers can be out of this world. When bad...well, here is an example. Pours with absolutely no carbonation. None. Nada, in a beer that screams out for it. Thick and viscous with no head. Without any effervescence, this beer smells flat and overly sweet, with heavy caramel notes and a whiff of brandy that doesn't go nearly far enough to cut the sweetness. The taste is similar, with flat oak flavors out of balance with the light brandy notes and sweetness. Thick and viscous in the mouth, but not entirely unpleasant here. Drain pour for me. This could have been so great- but for the price, I just won't risk it again."
"d - Very disappointing. I like bourbon beers a lot, but in this one the bourbon just dominates everything in the smell and taste. Being flat doesn't help it either. Would not want to have again, unless it had some age on it."
"Notes: Vintage 2008. This picked up a lot of the brandy flavor and is a very vinous beer. Hints of dark malt come out, but it is really an afterthought. I wasn't overly impressed by this one, but it was decent. Would probably be great if you like brandy, but that isn't necessarily me (I don't hate it, but just not really a fan of it)."
"2009 vintage. The beer pours dark brown with only a few bubbles. Looks like this is one of the flat Lost Abbey beers. The aroma is brandy, oak, maple and alcohol. The flavor is even better with a lot of maple notes as well as some oak. You also get a lot of vanilla, brandy, dark fruit chocolate and alcohol. Very low to flat carbonation and a medium to thick mouthfeel. Even with the bottle conditioning issues, this beer was very good. It was sampled side-by-side with a 2010 Bourbon Angel's Share and this beer was superior in my opinion due to the strong maple notes."
"D - A well-crafted blend of some serious brews, barrel-aged. Sounds exceptionally drinkable to me."
"Honestly, it's not as bad as I was thinking (not Triple Bock bad), but I won't be buy this ever again, not even at a significantly cheaper price such as $3. Maybe it needs a bit more age to mellow out the alcohol and wood characteristics. I've got its brother the Bourbon version, so we'll see how that one stacks up with my lower expectations."
"Quite a complex and interesting beer, the drinkablility is hard to judge due to the faux-thin nature of the body. Its definitely a sipper in this way, and some of the flavors start to become overly sweet as it warms. I have a bottle of the newest vintage waiting in my fridge, and I'm interested to see the comparison between the 2."
"The body is nicely full and, surprisingly, not at all heavy. Drinkability is also surprisingly easy for a beer this strong. I didn't finish my 12oz bottle in one sitting, and with the lack of carbonation, I'm not worried about going flat before I have a chance to drink/share the rest. Overall, a solid brew, worth a shot if you see it."
"I feel bad for all who got flat ASBB, depressing."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. The beer pours a shade lighter than pitch black, with absolutely zero hint of a head forming or any lacing (sigh). The smell cheers me up a little bit, dark chocolate and oak/vanilla notes. As I sip I pick up the same flavors I found in the nose, with dark fruits and a slight refined alcohol finish added to the mix, complex and very enjoyable. As suggested at the outset, there's absolutely no carbonation whatsoever. In addition, the body is decent but could stand to be a little more full. The drinkability score would be at least a point higher if not for the poor mouthfeel, as even the slight alcoholic heat at the end of the taste doesn't really pose a problem."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer as long as I didn't think about the price. I don't think I'd spend $16 on it again. For some reason it made me think of me of Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout. I can't say why, but it did, and I haven't even had the Sam Smiths Imperial Stout in a couple of years."
"D: Low, but ""sippability"" is high....yah know, if that were a category."
"My brother in law, who isn't a BA, even asked why she didn't buy two bottles because this is his favorite non macro beer I've given him."
" Pours super thick murky brown, with an obvious dense center. Not very sure what causes this but looks really cool. The smell of oak, barley and alcohol fill your nose from the first smell. This is a very earthy beer and drinks very slow. Even the smallest sip covers the mouth with a ton of strong dry barley flavor. Think a very dry Cabernet vs a sweeter Cab...this is one ""BIG Beer"" in every sense of the word, smell, taste, mouth feel and ABV weighing in at a solid 12%! This beer gets a solid 5. Recommend buying a bottle or 3 and having one fresh and cellaring them for later dates!"
"Angel's Share is right."
"D: Overall, this brew is quite drinkable. It does lack in some aspects, but the complex flavors and full body make it quite unique. It's one that's definitely worth trying."
"Light body and literally no carbonation. I have had worse beers, but this one is not my favorite either."
"Drinkability: Perhaps not a spot-on sampling? I can only rate what I taste. Not my cup of tea. To the next one."
"Wiseman Justin: A (4.30)"
"D- Exactly what you would expect from a beer of this description. A one beer night over a good meal or great conversation."
"Overall, this is the third time I've had one of the Angel's Share from Lost Abbey and this has been the best bottle I've had. This beer is flavorful and enjoyably complex. If Lost Abbey can keep up their quality control then I might just pick up another bottle in the future. Also, I'm really looking forward to the Grand Cru version of this. I've heard good things and I know when Lost Abbey does something well, they do it very well."
"I'm really happy as to have tried this and having it side by side with the Grand Cru was a great experience. I just wasn't digging this version too much and when price is factored in I don't see myself picking up more of this. On the other hand the Grand Cru version was outstanding and if you have the chance to try it I would highly recommend it."
"Despite the fact that the carbonation could be a little higher, this is a very enjoyable beer with a great balance of brandy flavor. At the current price point I don't think a 12oz bottle is worth it though."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"I poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a dark, nontranslucent amber with the slightest hint of a head, after a very vigorous pour. All carbonation is gone within a minute of the pour. Brandy is the predominant aroma going on. There are hints of oak and vanilla to round out a very pleasing smell. The flavor is suprisingly good for a flat beer. The oak and vanilla mellow the brandy nicely. The beer is warming and it finishes with hot alcohol. The beer is full bodied, and somewhat creamy. The lack of carbonation really kills the enjoyment for me. The beer is a sipper, the brandy ensures that. I would avoid this overpriced brew."
"Overall: The Bourbon and Brandy flavors are so strong in this beer that it's nearly an example of a slightly carbonated Bourbon. That said, it's extremely warming and pleasing on the tongue with flavor complexities ranging from vanilla oak, to bourbon and some dark fruit. There is no indication of hop presence and barley malt character is dominated by the barrel aging. Ultimately, a great beer for a Brandy lover but a bit biased in that direction for a beer lover."
"I had this on tap another time and it was alot better, alot less sourness and moldy musty notes and some carbination, this was way underwhelming."
"Mouthfeel is pretty full but could be even more syrupy to match the taste. This is an extremely boozey beer and as much as I enjoyed it, at 12% ABV I probably would not have been able to get home if I had had two!"
" The Angel's Share 2010 is an American Strong Ale and 12%. It smelled of oaky vanilla, raisins, prunes and brandy. It tasted extremely malty, sweet with tons of caramel/toffee notes, with a huge burnt coffee aftertaste. It wasn't quite balanced for me, the brandy definitely overpowered the other flavors. It also was lacking in carbonation, which I personally didn't think that was such an issue since this beer is heavy and pretty much a sipper (but I know that goes against all beer codes)."
"Overall this was an excellent American Strong Ale from The Lost Abbey and one that seemed to do quite well aging in a brandy barrel. Recommended."
"It took me a little while to warm up to the amount of brandy the aging imparted on this beer. I wavered between not liking it and loving it throughout drinking the bottle. Really on the fence here."
"D: Drinks surprisingly well. I'm really disappointed with this batches' lack of carbonation. This thing just sits in the glass like late 60's Cuyahoga River water...still, lifeless, and brown. Looks aren't everything, but c'mon! Really?"
"drinkability - even if this beer had a different mouthfeel - i would never buy this beer again - over hyped and over priced - oh well live and learn"
"Overall, this is ok, nothing special, the grand cru crushes this."
"I sampled The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged beer a few months back and can confirm that the brandy barrel-aged example is nearly identical. All in all, this is a terrific beer. I am glad Tomme and company were able to take care of the carbonation issues that plagued the 2008 release."
"Overall, this COULD be an awesome beer. However, this one lives up to Lost Abbey's mo...no carbonation. The prices they charge for these beers is absolutely criminal, especially with their persistent QC problems. Thanks again Alex!"
"J"
"M/D: This was phenomenal; lightly carbonated like a cask ale, the feel is syrupy and medium to heavy in consistency. The texture is great for the style. There is a sour twinge towards the end and a sweetness that leaves me looking for a glass of water. Not a guzzler, nor should it take less than a half hour to drink a single glass, but I enjoyed every second that it took me to drink this."
"D: Kind of the same complaint as last year: it's pretty damn expensive. Comes out to a $20 pint if you do the math. I'm not denying the quality of this beer. But I feel it's overpriced in general, and specifically for Lost Abbey, who isn't easily going to pry that much money out of my hands after last year's debacle. I'd have loved to see them pass on the cost savings of the new bottle, like Russian River did. Eh."
"I think the drinkability is quite good for a high alcohol beer like this. The flavors are very well balanced without being overly sweet. The alcohol finish may detract somewhat."
"2009 release, 12.7oz bottle, $15.99 in Chicago. The price is high, but I was glad to get a smaller bottle as I'm pretty sure 750mL would be way too much of this beer. The beer is dark brown and opaque, thin ring of head, no lace but above all there are BUBBLES! The aroma is strong brandy, caramel-like sugar, plums and other dark fruits, boozy alcohol. The taste is all brandy, I'm not sure how much the base beer matters against the strength of these barrels. I'd like to try Angel's Share without the barrel aging so I could get a better feel for the beer itself, but that's not to say this isn't good. Any flavors I list are likely to be from the brandy, dark fruits like figs and plums, strong booze, etc. Lightly carbonated with a velvety mouthfeel, I honestly think the light mouthfeel suits the style well."
"Tastes like an English Barleywine thrown in barrels. A 750 ml of Angel's Share costs an arm and a leg (usually $30 in SoCal!), but 11.5 ounces from draft cost me $9 in Anaheim (a $20 equivalent for 750 ml). Even the 11.5 ounce size was a slow ride, but a tasty one, so don't be afraid to share a bottle with others."
"Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Alcohol is pretty intense so sipping is a must. Has the perfect amount of carbonation for such a big beer. This a great beer to share and I'm glad I grabbed another to put some time on."
"D- This stuff is an incredible pleasure to drink, but the booziness can become overwhelming with time. This knocks the drinkability down in my book."
"Drinkability is hard to place on this one. I'm going to enjoy slowly sipping this glass of beer. But I would not go back for a second, and am glad that I didn't opt for the 750 ml bottle, not without someone to share it with. Very enjoyable beer, though."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit slick. Carbonation is mellow but well placed for the style and ABV in my opinion. I really wouldn't want it more carbonated. A 375ml bottle is the perfect serving size for this and I really am enjoying this years bottling. Decadent."
"D: Very drinkable for how hot it was. Nice and complex, this is a good one to savor for a while."
"Served in an 8oz snifter. This one poured thick black and had a strong aroma of alcohol and candied fruits. The taste waste alcohol and brandy up front, giving way to flavors of dark fruit. Incredibly smooth with a nice thickness to it. The drinkablity is very good, but be careful it packs a punch. An excellent brew. Glad I had the pleasure of trying this on tap."
"D - This one got pretty intense as it warmed up, and the brandy is obviously apparent. While it wasn't much to look at, it delivered a complex flavor profile overall while maintaining its drinkability for a 12% Strong Ale."
"I could drink too much of this. Very good. If you can get your hands on it, try it. Especially now that it comes in a 375ml bottle so you don't have to drop 30+"
"D: Very enjoyable beer, lots of nice flavors and strong flavors. Overall lots of complex flavors and a very enjoyable beer. Excellent beer for a cold winter night. The booze is definitely a slow down factor on drinking this beer, a constant reminder, but still a nice beer. I hope I can find some of the bourbon barrel. Recommended."
"D - I'm honestly torn whether the taste and complexity can be truly appreciated with such a lacking body. Sipper if ever I can say there was one. Regardless, this is worth the cost for at least a try and maybe another to lay down."
"D- Not a drain pour, given the incorporation of great flavors, but at 12% and obvious quality control issues, this does not have good drinkability. I can't wait to try this beer with proper carbonation; my expectations are high."
"D - Personally, I really like this beer. Would seek out again."
"Have to thank gthorton for letting me know it would be on tap for only $4. Big thank you as well to Wine Steals for the generous pours of this awesome beer, our 4 bucks got us very large goblets full of the sweet nectar!"
"I wanted to see if the 2008 finally carbonated. It is not, and pretty much ruins this for me. I don't want to harp on that issue to much. It is what it is. I hope I can find some 2009, which I hear is suppose to be carbonated. Will update my review then."
"D/O: A much needed improvement over last years and reminds me of a decent english barleywine. Easy to drink but not so easy on the wallet (overpriced at $18) to buy more than one."
"D: This is a high ABV drink mind you, but for the style this is an exceptionally smooth drink, that now that I have tried it, I think I will fork out the $30 for a bottle, because it is so well crafted."
"Overall, I was glad to see the carbonation here. A nice beer and I really enjoyed the heavy brandy notes. Fairly drinkable and the 375 would be ideal."
"Overall - This is very interesting, and not really like any other beer I have had. I really enjoy it, and think it will continue to get better with even more bottle age."
"D: It tastes powerful and slightly intimidating. Glad I drank slowly, because it definitely packs a punch. Obviously not a session beer (too high in alcohol and price), but something I would love for a well-balanced dinner party with friends; eating something lighter and simple (thin crust cheese pizza) while drinking helped me appreciate the complexity of it with each new sip."
"Had the newly released 2009 batch on tap at the Blue Palms. Pours a deep mahogany with no head whatsoever. I'm used to flat Lost Abbey bottles, but not draft. The smell is amazing. The brandy is prominent but not overpowering and blends nicely with sweet malts. I smelled this beer for a couple of minutes before I took my first sip, which sadly did not live up to the nose. There is an alcohol burn that dominates the initial taste and doesn't provide any real flavor. In fact it seems to cover up most of the flavors that slowly try to reveal themselves as the beer warms up but with limited success. There are some traces of sweet malts blended nicely with brandy in the finish but that is pretty much it. The mouthfeel is a little lacking, this batch seems a little watery, thiner than I remember previous batches. Drinkability suffers as this beer is still pretty hot. Hopefully over time the heat will mellow out and the flavors will really develop but it seems like the Lost Abbey didn't really bring their A game with this batch. The brandy barrel AS is my favorite of the two versions but this batch isn't as good as previous years. By no means a bad beer, but a pretty weak batch of a once great beer."
"Overall, I enjoyed this variant over the bourbon aged variant and apparently I'm in the minority. The flavors of the base beer were not overwhelmed by the brandy as they were, in my opinion, in the bourbon. If I want bourbon, I'll drink bourbon."
"This one would probably be helped with some age in the bottle (reducing the alcohol notes a bit), but I didn't enjoy it enough to bother finding out."
"This giant beer is a strong dark ale, aged in brandy and port wine barrels. It reminds me of sherry, particuarly Pedro Ximenez, a very dark, and sticky sweet style. Rich and complex with notes of burnt caramel and hazelnut brittle. A very smooth concoction which is a bit boozy, but not so much in the very front. It has a long, warming finish which I find quite pleasurable."
"D- Well if i was not driving, I could of had another, but that was out. I enjoyed sipping on 10 ounces of this over a hour and that's the way it should be. Brandy Angel's share is a sipper and anything else is uncivilized. Get on this if you find a tap version, don't fuck with the bottles, they are a waste of scratch."
"Ok...not as bad as I thought with the raisin flavor...in fact, very good. Just the right amount of carbonation. Brandy/booze factor is definitely there. Great warm feeling down the throat and into the stomach from the brandy. Nice grainy, malty taste...somewhat sweet, but with a nice bitterness to compliment the overall flavor and experience. Very, very good beer!"
"Overall, this is an overpriced bottle and despite all the problems surrounding this release, it actually turned out to be pretty decent. Having said that, I plan on holding onto the other bottle I have for a long time to see if any more bubbles appear."
"D - Very interesting. Drinks more like a liqueur or a brandy than an actual beer. Alcohol makes its presence known with a nice warming in the finish."
"D: hard to drink, heavy head, but good in spite of this. Got to sip it though. I wonder how it would be on tap..."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I think I've gotten most of my generic observations out of the way above. Does this beer suffer from lack of carbonation? Yes. Does it - hypothetically - probably suffer less than the bourbon version would? Yes. Is the base beer amazing? Yes. Would I die to try this on tap? Yes. Do I hope Tomme Arthur works out his carbonation issues? Despite all the vitriol he's gotten on this site, in these reviews, and on the forums, I hope - for everyone's sake - that he does."
"M + D: A little touch of carbonation prickle, but for the most half, this feels like a cask conditioned ale. The temperature is appropriate for the feel, and works with the flavours quite nicely. While I pick up a note of licorice a little strong, it was a strong ""4" all around."
"D: I want to keep drinking this, but I also don't want to fall on my face. A great strong ale in that it hides the alcoholic burn, but it's present enough to remind you what you're drinking."
"Very impressive and quite different from the bourbon barrel version. Excellent stuff."
"It's a big complex beer and well worth getting hold of."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. The flavor profile is nice which makes for good drinking. The alcohol is fairly high, but well incorporated so I have no major qualms there. Unfortunately the lack of carbonation is definitely an issue for me. All in all it's a good beer, but it could be better."
"D - This beer was a challenge to review... Trying to put aside its once lofty status as well as its well known issues was difficult... While I'm pretty sure this isn't what Tommy envisioned when he brewed it or what the majority of BAs expected when they purchased, the result is a still enjoyable ""misstep""... A 750ml is a little tough to work through solo, but this is far from the drain pour that many BAs make it out to be... I keep taking sip after sip and seem to be having a hard time putting my glass down..."
"carbonation."
"Reviewed on 10/24/2009. 2008 bottle. Absolutely no pop at all upon uncorking. Pours a flat dark brown with absolutely no head nor any carbonation. Lots of floating yeast particles. Aroma of booze, raisin, and lots of malt. Flavor is also boozy (although I don't get liquor specifically) with lots of sweet malt, prunes, raisin. Cloying and sweet. Not very complex nor tasty to me."
"All told this is a decent beer. Not as terrible as some people have made it out to be, but certainly not worth the price tag. The lack of carbonation doesn't bother me much. I think a creamy feel would do this beer well, but it drinks ok without it too. And at 12.5% it did the job I wanted it to do, and tasted pretty good doing so."
"I liked this one a little bit better than the bourbon version I had on tap. It seemed to have more character and sophistication in it's flavor profile."
"Pours a pitch black with no sign of life, no head, no lacing. Looks like black wine, not even a ring around the edges of this beer. Not impressed at all with this aspect of the beer. Smell was the best part of this one. Wood, whiskey (not too huge but tasteful), raisins and dark fruit and a pinch of alcohol. There was also a lot of cocoa in the nose that I did not remember in the bottle. A nicely balanced scent on this one. Taste is also good. Huge cocoa and whiskey with raisins and dark fruit, a good wood aspect and a pinch of alcohol that could be overwhelming at points. Once again, I don't remember the cocoa aspect in the bottle. Mouthfeel was a bit light for me, very warm with extremely low carbonation. A wine-like watery consistency with a huge coat of alcohol and whiskey on the tongue. Drinkability is decent. I know this one is too pricey for the quality, better on-tap vs. the bottle, probably have it again ON-TAP due to its rarity in MA, the alcohol started to kill it after 8oz."
"750ml courtesy of RomanW70. Pours the color prune juice with no head. Nose was vanilla, booze and a suggestion of grapes. Taste follows nose with the addition of some cocoa. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with an almost non-existent carbonation presence. Delicious beer with great complexity. This beer doesn't need a lot of carbonation, but a trace more would have really made this beer exquisite. A great offering nonetheless, but definitely one to share."
"Shows a very dark brown in the glass with absolutely no head. The nose is sweet and dominated with scents of bourbon & brandy oak barrels followed by molasses, chocolate, espresso, black licorice, subtle black pepper, vanilla, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, maple syrup, toasted nuts, baking spices, & belgian waffle aromas. The beer is very syrupy, viscous, & sweet (alcohol) on the palate with good mouthfeel/carbonation and a long finish. Overall, this is an outstanding beer, but on that you'd have to drink over a long period of time and/or with a cigar."
"Overall, yet another disappointment from Flat Abbey. They continue to baffle me. Their Duck Duck Gooze, Cable Car and Isabelle Proximus are hall of fame beers and among my all-time favorites. But multiple others are just flat, un-carbonated disasters. I got this one for free from a buddy or I'd be pissed about spending $30 for a flat beer."
"Not bad, has potential. I have another bottle that Ill age for a few years in hopes it carbs up-"
"The mouthfeel is incredibly thin, and there is NO carbonation at all in this beer. If this were carbonated it would be better than the bourbon version, the flavors are more balanced and the scent is awesome, but the drinkability is awful, like a thin cough syrup."
"10oz pour at Tria in Philly. Purple/brown in color. Looks DEAD flat. No bubbles, head or lacing. Big fail here. Hoping the keg helps this 2009 flat version out. Smells of extreme chocolate covered raisins and rasberries. There is enough carbonation in taste to keep it alive. That's a plus. A lot of chocolate in taste and dark fruits. Noticable booze in taste. Not bad. Tough to drink a lot of this."
"Pours a very dark reddish colored body. Small off-white head, diminishing. Smells like whiskey, brandy. Smooth fruity aroma. A little funky smelling. Muted aroma, not very strong. Slick taste, dark fruit aftertaste. Some roasted flavors, doesn't taste like beer at all. Funky taste, slick like whiskey. Not sure how to rate this, doesn't taste like any beer I've had before. Better as it warms, some chocolate taste comes out. Dark fruit like fig."
"D- Keeping in mind that it is a 12% strong ale aged in Brandy barrels, this is quite a drinkable beer. One might call it a great ""sipper."""
"I was excited to try this on tap because the bottles I had were amazing. One of my favorite beers of all time. This batch was way too boozy and not very well balanced. Avoid and try to find some bottle from 2007 that aren't infected."
"D - Can't drink this anymore, me and my friend dumped it all down the sink. It's that bad. What a complete waste of money."
"This beer should never have been released or once it got out it should have been recalled. Mouth feel is appalling! Not ""appropriate for the style"" not ""mildly carbonated"" not even close! Dead flat! Dishwater! Smells pleasant enough and you can vaguely see the potential of what it could be if it were properly carbonated, but it's not. It is hard to even describe this swill as beer, it reminds me more of a glass of iced tea after all the cubes have melted. As a Patron Sinner, I am very disappointed that Lost Abbey let this one out of the brewery."
"D - So much going on with this beer. Very enjoyable even without the carbonation. Would love to try a carbonated bottle. Normally oak aged beers have an overpowering wood chip smell and taste. Not the case with this beer, very well balanced and oak does nothing but enhance the flavors. This is a sipping beer with a mandatory 2 minute break in-between sips. If this beer played Call of Duty 5 - it would def be a 5 star general."
"M&D - this portion is a bit from memory, i wont judge based ona bottle suffering from a well documented issue. at the EBF i remember a significant liveliness, yet highly drinkable, i know that after the EBF it became kind of my ""white whale"" and when i saw a bottle i spared no expense. hopefully the carbonation issues will be/have been settled and i can have this great brew from a great brewery again"
"Ah well, at least it was carbonated."
"Mouthfeel is fantastically thick, smooth and velvety on the palate... and in my imagination it is perfectly carbonated. But since in reality it is not at all carbonated, the mouthfeel sucks. drinkability is also imaginatively huge."
"It will age well and is possibly one of the best beers I've ever had!"
"D- I personally would want to split a bottle several ways due to the rich nature. Also, the fact that one should share something so awesome."
"Aroma doesn't betray the abv. This is a smooth smell of caramel, light chocolate, vanilla and a touch of very dry timber. Oh, how I wish it were colder outside and the fireplace lit. Anywho, the taste follows the aroma. The caramel is a bit thicker and the vanilla clings to the woodiness. almost seems like a carbonated port. Some chocolate comes and goes as well as unripe figs and apricots. Very nice. I likey like this one. Alcohol does hit hard in the end...i'd like to see this one age a bit longer."
"d: I admit that I came into this with a chip on my shoulder. I had all kinds of nasty things in mind that I intended to write. It pains me to say it, but this great beer is only a couple bubbles away from being world-class. As great as it was, this is most likely my last Lost Abbey offering. They have taken a beating in the forums in recent months and deservedly so. To repeatedly release flat beer is baffling and unacceptable. Plain and simple, beer needs to be carbonated BEFORE it is sold. The onus should not be on the consumer to properly store a beer while it carbonates before it can be consumed. To do so without a word of warning to the public is particularly outrageous. Because they have failed to do this more than once, their customer service record is irreperably damaged in my eyes. Its a shame that such talented brewer would treat his customers with such disdain. No more LA for me."
"Save your $30. The bad experience stories are true, much as I wanted to see them wrong."
"A little dry, but a tasty take on the style. I'd say the carbonation issues with this were overrated."
"Despite all of this, I still ""almost"" want to call this a world class beer, even in its current state. It is so close, just a smidgen of carbonation would have been satisfactory. Can I get a smidgen, please?"
"Overall: disappointment, want to try another vintage"
"Nevertheless, its been a joy to drink, a pleasure. Its the kind of crazy complex brew that the beer aficionado requires, from time to time. Much thanks, Tom. Much thanks."
"Drinkability: Relatively low, it's just a little too boozy for my liking. Yes, the taste was good and solid, but with that kind of alcohol burn, it's more like drinking light spirits than enjoying a great brew."
"D= Tastes great and smells wonderful. The carbonation problem is the only downfall for this beer. Really tastes great. Could be one of the best in the world but, well as I already mentioned it has no carbonation."
"What a great beer this had been. $40 is a lot of money to spend on a defective product. Had this been well carbonated I would do it again but given the circumstances I would like to return my second bottle for a refund."
"Served in tulip glass at about 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Poured muddy amber. Chill haze perhaps? Next to zero carbonation. Strong vanilla and oak flavor with malty sweetness. Vanilla and tobacco scent. Alcohol certainly noticeable in flavor but not overwhelming. Slightly slick mouth feel. Paid $45 at the Foodery in Philadelphia. While I appreciate the artistry in this brew it is not quaffable at all, but perhaps it should not be. I really wanted to like this beer and was prepared to deal with a little funkiness from the barrel but the lack of carbonation can not be ignored. Sadly, I will never pay my own money for this beer unless the price drops in half."
"Incredibly hot, to the point where my mouth is burning. Every flavor in the scent is echoed in the taste. Very nice burnt caramel and toffee flavors that mix well with the vanilla and oak tastes. Fairly roasted. Unfortunately the lack of carbonation really kills this beer. I really wish this could have been had ontap..."
"D: If I wasn't going to an epic tasting after this, I would have drunk the hell out of this and the bourbon AS on tap. Excellent beers, along with DDG, the only beers I kept wanting to drink in the 100 degree heat."
"Big thanks to scrizz for sending that beer to my house!"
"HV"
"Met and exceeded high expectations. Not sure what happened with the '09 batch but if there is any '08 left seize it immediately."
"D: Although it obviously suffers from the lack of carbonation, it's still a really good beer. Perhaps it could have been slightly less boozy, but the brandy flavors give it a rather rich character."
"This beer poured with zero head. It is flat, and I mean flat like tap water. Not a single bubble to be found. Smells great, but it is a subtle smell. The nose is full of vanilla, caramel, plum, and boosy goodness. The taste is very similar with loads of over ripe fruit, vanilla, and sweet brandy. However, this beer feels horrible in the mouth. It is overly sweet and hard to swallow. I refuse to pour this expensive beer out, so I tried to sip slowly and enjoy. How can a big brewery mess a beer up like this? I have had beers carbonate slowly before. They tend to only have a bit of bubbles after a few months in the bottle. After 8 months, those beers finally have full carbonation. This is different. There is no sign of bottle fermentation. I am afraid this brew will never carbonate. I have one more bottle in the cellar. It will sit there for the next 3 years, then I will revisit. I pray for carbonation. Lost Abbey needs to learn about quality control. Oh well, at least the CdT was somewhat carbonated."
"2008 750ml bottle.. drank on july 10th 2009 @ 6:15pm::: Very light tiny pop, pours a jet black with maybe 50 small brown bubbles on a vigorous pour, headring disappears after a minute or two .. . . smell is wonderful, from clean dark fruits, to candied brandy, and all the smells of your childhood (if your parents were lushes) ... . mouthfeel of water, no carbonation, like drinking a pussy version of SA Triple bock, but its actually very easy to drink, unlike the 3x bock .. .. quite a lot of heat comes through, but for 12% not that bad .. . . even a light touch of carbonation would have been nice .. . flavours of oak, smoke, tar, chocolate plums, cherry brandy ... . you're like a bone with a bone ... I can see why people got pissed about this brew, god! the potential this beer has to be great and the way Lost Abbey went about it is unexcuseable, money grubbers! but that being said, a nice brew but all and all: a disappointment ... . ya i said bump uglies, so what you wanna fight about it!?! .. . . It will take ALOT for me to buy Lost Abbey beer again, thanks Tomme, i hope you enjoy my $32 ... you're a fuckin crook ... honestly: i did kinda enjoy this beer in a weird way, but basically it is a mess...."
"D- when my friend picked this one up, i really wanted to try it and to like it. ive never been disappointed with something ive personally purchased from lost abbey. however, this beer was flat. and it wasnt my bottle, it was the whole batch. the flavor, smell, and complexity of this english barleywine are fantastic. however, the flat bottle made this one nearly undrinkable. several people we offered tastes to replied that it was much more like liquor than beer."
"D - Beer should be adequately carbonated; this beer is not, and is almost undrinkable. While the recipe is perfect, the absence of carbonation takes away from an otherwise fantastic beer. Avoid the 2008 batch, unless on-tap."
"Pours a murky brown that disappointingly has no head and no film on top. There are bubbles in the beer, but they take a close look to notice. Smell is caramel and booze. Boring. It's hard to taste this when I can't get past the fact that its flat. Mouthfeel is absolutely horrible. Its almost like I'm drinking a beer thats been opened for a week. Drinkability is bad too. I just can't give this a good review. The $32 price tag makes it that much worse. I feel as though I've been duped. Oh well, that's life."
"On tap, this beer is rivaled by very few; from any serving type, it still is in the upper echelon aroma and flavor wise. From the bottle, however it's mouthfeel takes more away than it contributes."
"First thing about drinkability is that this is a nearly flat beer that costs $33 a bottle. Tasty beer but that flaw isn't a point of recommendation, for $33 they should be able to put the fizz in."
"This beer stirs up as much passion in people as religion and politics. After months of reading about this one, it was time to remove it from its resting place. I was not holding out much hope for this one, so the disappointment level was reduced. I know they are offering reconditioned versions of the 375 ml bottles, but I feel that is way too much of a hassle. Since they released a flawed, but safe to drink, product, I am going to review that version. I feel that this has the makings of a great beer. It smells great and the flavors of the beer were quite apparant. I would be willing to try the next version provided there was quality control checks to guarantee the beer was truly ready for consumption."
"For the price, I don't think I'll be pursuing this brew anytime soon. It's certainly one to try if you're at all a fan of old ales or old stock ales (J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, Old Engine Oil, etc...)"
"all that said, this here draught version is pretty nice. life-alteringly phenomenal? probably not. but give credit where credit is due - and constructive criticism where that's due as well."
"Thanks to Adamdc! Rock on Rockstar!"
"O.K., there I said it. It's really good!"
"D: God, do I wish I knew what this beer was like with some decent carbonation, I think it could be a world class beer if it had some form of mouthfeel that was other than just the viscosity of this beer. Would I drop 30 bucks on this beer again? If I knew it was a carbonated bottle, yes, probably. But I'm not sure if I'm willing to risk another 30 bucks on a gamble. Not as terrible as people make it out to be, but dropping 30 bucks you would hope that you get the product the brewer intends you to get."
"Overall, I can see how this beer was rated highly at one point and is now floundering. It has great potential but seems a bit heavy on the alcohol and unfortunately, it is completely flat and this wrecks the beer. I think I would try it again if I knew that it was going to be served the way it should be. A bit disappointing, but I will continue to remain optimistic."
"Bottle: Poured a deep murky brown color ale with no head whatsoever. Aroma of of alcohol vapor with some gross residual sugar. Taste is overly dominated by brandy notes with some sweet sugary malt with an almost gross feel. Body is full with no carbonation and strong alcohol showing. I know the issue this beer had with carbonation but the fundamental issue are bigger then only carbonation - way too much alcohol is showing even though I understand beer as been barrel-aged with a lack of complexity. I must admit that this example is definitely over-hyped and fall well below my expectations."
"So i read the guys review below me and he declared his as not flat, though really undercarbonated. This is completely flat. Like a smidge above water, and really, it ruins everything for me. $30 drain pour, but you live and learn."
"Ok, not flat. One micron this side of flat. If flat baseline was water, this beer would have to be 3 or 4 times more carbonated than it is to be a low carbonated beer. Wasted 30 bucks, but now I can at least object with authority."
"Drinkability: For me, it wasn't quite deserving of the perceived inflated hype and permissive praise, nor was it one of the accused, loathsome issue-prone bottles. So, I hit happily somewhere in the middle -- a fine beer to accompany me through a few episodes of House and catching up on my e-mail."
"Addendum: retried now in September, another drainpour. it is obvious that waiting longer will not help this absolutely horrendous beer; the yeast is not viable. Do not waste your money."
"Very light, almost non-existent carbonation. All in all, not very pleasant. Will try again in the future. Lost Abbey is going to be stuck with these kinds of reviews and conclusions if it releases beer unreasonably early. Just my opinion."
"Rating: 3.0/4.0/4.0/4.5/3.5"
"*Note: Appearance/Mouthfeel is based on both tap/bottle."
"Drinkability: I love the way this tastes, and that alone can keep me sipping on it. 12% is very well hidden, I think."
"Blipped ""Angel"" by that dog"
"If you need a nightcap to share with 20 friends, look no further. If you are looking for a drinkable brew... here's hoping the edges soften with time."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth, nearly flat."
"In response to the carbonation issues I've heard about: sure it was a bit flat, even on tap, but nothing to end your marriage or break your flat screen TV over (sorry, inside BA joke)!"
"First taste has less sweetness than than I'd predicted. Chocolate, caramel, rasin, and oak. Just a tiny bit of smokiness. This must have been for the dark angels. The ABV really starts cooking on the finish, and does drown out some of the subtlety and complexity I'd hoped for. Not sure how this would hold up in the bottle. But, some more maturation might help it calm down a bit. There is no carbonation. I'm not sure if that is expected? Like the label states, ""Make sure you share."""
"overall very, very good."
"Pretty drinkable too for a 12% barley-wine. It would make sense for there to be more alcohol heat, but it swallows pretty smooth. All around really nice and I can't wait to try the Bourbon Aged version to compare."
"Thanks for all the hype and not backing it up Angel's Share. Here is your bad advertising from one really pissed off customer."
"Despite the well documented and accurate posts about the lack of carbonation I bought a bottle to split with some friends. A very slight pop. Poured no head whatsoever. The beer is flat. However in the vein of Sam Adams Utopias this beer really doesn't need the carbonation. The brandy barrel aging comes through big time in the aroma. Flavor was that of sherry with a little bit of oak. Like most high alcohol beers it is on the sweeter side. Not cloying but more a a rich caramel sweetness. Depsite the lack of carbonation the beer is medium to full bodied. A great beer and much maligned in my opinion because it doesnt need the carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is a bit chewy, warming on the way down, and decently creamy throughout. I would hesitate to drink too many of these - it's a huge beer with a high a.b.v. Definitely a treat, not a session."
"D - No thanks for the 2008 version. I'm going to review once again when I crack a bottle that's a different vintage. This one is a no-go. I have to drain-pour this bottle...couldn't drink this any longer."
"D: This is the second time I have gotten to try this gem of a beer and the taste has been incredible each time. I know people are complaining about the carbonation issues, but I think the controversy is a bit overblown in the context of this beer."
"bottle 2008 Pours a murkey brown with no noticable head what so ever. Has a wonderful aroma of wood, sweet fruits, vanilla, and sweet caramel. Has a awesome flavor. Very lightly carbinated. An Awesome mouthfeel. The alcohol is well hidden. Very well balanced. Has a great mouthfeel. A real good finish. This is a wonderful beer. Makes me wish I was an angel for my share. Very well done."
"Verdict: Orgasmic."
"Hopefully this beer will correct itself with time, but unfortunately had to drainpour my bottle about half way through. Very disappointed with this beer, especially after how much I liked the bourbon barrel version."
"Drinkability- Tremendous beer, whatever type it may be considered."
"Full body silks over my palate with ease. Perfectly delicate carbonation. Delicious stuff."
"Definitely one of my favorites. This makes me weak in the knees every time I taste this."
"Wow, on tap at the EBF, this past Saturday. The only brew I took notes on all weekend. Enjoyed 2 large sized samples that were truly savored. Poured burnt dark chocolate, near black, under a fierce looking dark tan head, sticks and sticks and emits loads of raisins and bourbon to the waiting nose. Rich, chewy and complex in the mouth and around the tongue. I picked up luscious notes of more raisins, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, ripe dark fruits...lovely beer...."
"2009 Brandy Barrel on tap at O'Brien's Lost Abbey night. Pours nearly black with a tiny head and no lacing. Strong aroma of Brandy, dark fruits, sweet toffee, vanilla, and oak. The last Angel's Share I enjoyed was the bourbon barrel, and this is my favorite of the two. Delicious brandy character throughout, with hints of vanilla and oak. Alcohol is strong but I love it. The finish is long, sweet, and full of brandy. One of my favorite barleywines. Full bodied with low-medium carbonation."
"D - My #1 at Toronados, no doubts."
"D: Pretty intense. Two glasses at most for me. On a side note, I can't believe this stuff was $3.50 with the happy hour pricing. God, I love Toronado"
"This is a great sipper that will be enjoyed through the night glad I got to try it and it wasn't infected. I must say this is defiantly my favorite American Strong Ale I have tried so far. I will defiantly seek another Angels share out for the future"
"Pours dark brown/mahogany with a brown head. Heavy dark friut aroma with lots of oak. Rich, and very malty with lots of fruity goodness up front. This was the last beer of a long night of sampling for me and Mike. Hopefully I will be lucky enough some day to have another bottle of this fine beer."
"2006 Version at GABF. Multiple samples over several days. Perhaps the best beer at the whole festival. At least the very best barrel aged beer. Chocolate, caramel, toffee, fruit, brandy. Complex, very concentrated. Great finish. The 2006 was a brilliant beer and was the standout at the 2007 GABF as well. Im concerned about my remaining bottles of 2007 though."
"This is a great beer, though i definitely prefer the bourbon version. Very drinkable for the ABV and I look forward to the newest version coming soon."
"Pours darker copper, slightly hazy, with a small ring of bubbles around the edges. Alcoholic nose, mostly brandy. Slightly medicinal, oaky, and a hint of pine tar. Lovely, creamy feel. Brandy up front, but not as powerful as in the bourbon barrel version. Vinuous flavors of red wine and fresh white grapes throughout. A bit of cream and vanilla, and a warm, alcohol finish. I thought this was superior to the bourbon barrel."
"Pours a very dark brown in color. Some ruby highlights that give the sense of reddish/purple highlights. Smell is very dark, ripe fruits. Plus a lot more brandy than I was expecting. This is incredibly boozy. Taste reaffirms the nose. I can't get over how much brandy flavor is in this beer. You can barely taste the underlying barleywine. This is a brandy bomb! Still some dark fruits trying to make their presence known, but the brandy barrel just won't let that happen. This is a huge, very big beer. I've yet to have anything even close to this experience."
"D- This one needs to be sipped because it's such a huge beer."
"Thanks so much for sharing pwoods!"
"The grand finale beer on cask at the Lost Abbey barrel tasting. Reddish brown appearance. Not nearly as much carbonation as the bourbon version I've had from a bottle. Admittedly, I had a few beers by the time I drank this, so my tongue could have just been scorched, but this seemed a little rough around the edges, not quite as smooth as the bourbon version. Though I hear maybe this is just because we were having a sneak preview of what will not be released in bottles until down the road. In any event, this was still great - lots of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, carmel, and what I guess is brandy (I'm not even sure I've drank brandy before). Definitely distinguishable from the bourbon counterpart. I'd love to try the two side-by-side."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Caramelly malt, chocolate, caramelized figs, raisins. Medium-full in body with low carbonation. Vanilla beans, subtle tannins, this has a pretty up-front barrel character. The brandy version is distinctly different from the bourbon barrel variety, namely in the vinous, fruity nuance that the brandy barrel lends the beer. Delicious stuff."
"Poured a reddish brown color with a thin, light tan head, that left sticky lacing on the glass. Aroma of tons of dark fruits, vanilla, oak, cocoa, caramel malts, and a touch of alcohol as well. Taste of some toffee, roasted malts, dried fruits, more oak, and vanilla, with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Fantastic barleywine, thanks EDA!"
"Not so easy to drink due to the sourness."
"Notes from and tasted on 4/18/07"
"Thanks Dave, this rare gem was a real treat!"
"Pours a dark molasses with a t hin half finger head that quickly dies down to a thin ring of bubbles. Swaying the glass back and forth leaves a sticky webbing on the sides. Rich brown sugar and caramel engulf the senses with a tiny hint of bourbon. Sweet raisins, dates, and fig dance in the nose as well. Heavy vanilla and a slight oak aroma can be detected too. Not as strong smelling as I had anticipated, but I think that's why I enjoy it, not overpowering. Taste is smokey sweet malts up front of chocolate, caramel, and butterscotch. Woody vanilla notes with pepper and spice dry the mouth a tad. An interesting pumpkin bread flavor on the tongue as well. Surprisingly I find very little alcohol on the tongue with this one. Mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as I was expecting. Medium to full silky smooth body with a tingling carbonation. A sipper for sure, but I pretty much knew that would be the case. I look forward to see what a few years will do to this. I can't wait to try more barrel aged beers from Lost Abbey. Thanks again guys for hooking me up with this beauty."
"The beer pours with a dark coffee color and a small tan head that clings to the sides of the glass. The smell is sweet dark chocolate, a light fruitiness, a moderate booze, and wonderful barrel aged sourness. The taste, wow. I had a bottle of this fresh and on tap and it had evolved. It is not as sweet and brandy-like now and the sourness has really become dominate. Sweet malt, carmel, liquor filled chocolates, slight oak/barrel, brandy, sour, funkiness from barrel aging (oxidation). The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a slight alcohol burn, and a clinging finish. For an 11.5% abv this beer goes down easily, maybe too easily. I really like this beer and am glad I have few more sitting in my cellar. I hear the next batch (2008) will be from freshly emptied brandy barrels, so I look forward to that beer."
"(Bottle, thanks WeeHeavySD) Pours very dark brown with deep reddish hints and a light brown head. Elegant and complex aroma with tones of chocolate, caramel, nuts, English toffee, English fruit cake, lingonberries, blackberries maybe some blueberry and strawberry jam and a wide subtle fruit spectra of raisins, plums, sweet pears, yellow apples and banana in the background. The oak wood blends in very well with soft tones of vanilla, cocoa nut and some butter. Also some hints of yeast, sugar, spices, peppery mint and sal ammoniac. Well balanced alcohol warmth carrying every aroma beautifully. The nose is extremely soft with notes of gruel. The flavour starts of with a second of chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. Then a rather full caramelly and fruity sweetness comes along with some fiery alcohol. The finish carries all the sweetness with a balanced sour berry touch. Oak, vanilla and some subtle sugar sources goes through every stage of the beer. Undertones of dark berries and dark fruits like raisins and black currant lemonade. Hints of liquorice, salt and hops. Medium to full sweet and syrupy with a light tart edge. Light bitter and light dry. The mouthfeel is maybe the best ever with a silky, smooth and velvety character. The carbonation is perfect for the mouthfeel and carries the beer gentle down your palate. Sugar, chocolate, vanilla, salty liquorice and some earthiness linger in the aftertaste. Near full bodied. What a perfect beer from our new favourite brewery! Yeah baby!"
"D-Whoa! This is some complex stuff. Hard to even explain all that is going on with this concoction! A wonderful sipper one has to try for themselves to understand. This is a highly enjoyable and palate stimulating sipper. A mighty fine drinking brew."
"Somewhat thin upon drinking but a creamy texture does come through on the middle. Have two more bottles of this so I'll have to try them...soon."
"Cheers to seaoflament for this 750ml bottle from 2007!"
"This insanely delicious ale is a masterpiece of the brewer's art. If it isn't the best American strong ale on the planet, then I'd love to know what is. The Angel's Share (Brandy) may be heavenly, but this bottle is mine, all mine. Let the angels get their own damn beer. Talisker deserves my undying gratitude for agreeing to part with one of his bottles."
"At the time I am posting this review I have now had both the Brandy and Bourbon versions, and I can say that the Brandy version is easily my favorite of the two."
"Pours almost black, with a light tan head. Smell is vanilla, raisins, dates, sweet dried fruity, and is just bursting out of the glass with goodness. Taste is super rich, smooth creamy sticky malt, vanilla, modest hops, dates, and decadent. Very drinkable. One of my all time favorites."
"Angel's Share might be over-hyped, but it's great stuff all the same."
"D: As a strong barrel aged beer I found this to be very tasty. I normally don't like boozy beer, especially ones with a lot of oak, but this beer was crafted well and didn't float off in any one direction. I can't consume a lot of this in one sitting but a small glass is very nice."
"Reviewed on: 12-25-2007 20:59:22"
"Well done brew! I felt bad about taking so much for myself but it was in love with this beer and the brandy complexities that it melded together with."
"Beautiful muddy, and thick, brown color with a light brown head that leaves very little lacing. Every swirl of this Angel produces a generous head back. Smell is of doughy, cookie and a rich toffee, buttery, and maple syrup boozy bourbon notes. Taste is sweet and awfully creamy. Mouthfeeling is great and allows you palate to soak in all the tasty bourbon and leaves a lingering warming. Great beer!"
"Thanks Tomme!"
"Overall, this beer totally lived up to the hype. It was worth every mile travelled, every minute waiting in line, and every penny spent. I only wish i could have purchased more. A truely remarkable beer and worthy of the highest of scores!"
"Props to Tomme on this amazing beer! This is what oak aging should be...not overwhelming but smoothing out flavors and adding complexity. I'm really looking forward to trying the bottles of Bourbon-barrel aged AS."
"Overall I really loved this one. Now I have not really had anything from Lost Abbey that I have not liked, but this and Devotion on back to back nights have really taken this thing to a while new level. The complexity displayed in the is uncanny and I really had a touch time with this review, as I am not usually at a loss for words with my reviews, but this one had me there, it was just that good. I really look forward to the Brandy and Bourbon barrel aged editions later this year; they will truly be breathtaking as I can only imagine the heights to which this one will get."
"I've been lucky enough to sample this one several times, from the wood, from the keg, and from the bottle. I do give the nod to the bourbon barrel one for overall beauty, especially from the wood but this one is damn fine as well. Darker than most barleywines, this one is almost the colour of a chocolate Terry's orange from the UK. The aroma is all brandy, chocolate malt, lovely deep fresh baked bread and spice. The taste is great, with a real depth of chocolate, brandy, and deep roasty malt flavors that are all well integrated and integral. The mouthfeel is medium milkshake thick with a great drinkability. Good stuff. I wish they would bottle all in 375's as well, because honestly without a friend to split this with a 750 is too much."
"its flat and it sucks, what happened?"
"A fantastically crafted beer with a very nice barrel character. I still prefer the creamier flavors and texture of the bourbon barrel version."
"Plain and simple...I love this beer. The fruit flavors, dark sugar sweetness, malt and brandy barrel is a near perfect marriage. And unfortunately I don't think any review can do it justice. The balance is incredible. This is a rich sipper. That cuts drinkability just a tad."
"Update: I've gotten to try some bottles of this that were not good at all."
"D- Sip slowly & enjoy! There is such a complexity of flavors running through that change as the glass warms in your hand. Disappointed that this will have probably have been my one and only Angel's Share experience."
"D: This beer is so complex that it almost cuts down in drinkability. Your simple ape brain cannot even begin to process what is being thrown at it. The amazing this is that there is not one taste that really dominates. One of the best balanced beers I have ever had."
"kudos to the staff at beerbistro for the time and effort involved in getting these rare treats available in ontario. it isn't easy, and it isn't cheap, but it's so worth it."
"Poured into snifters, a cloudy brown/orange, thin tan head forms, settles down to a thin ring, leaves some spots on the glass, and has some nice legs. Smell is amazing, sherry, oak, rich raisins and fig, toffee, brandy, some alcohol, vanilla and chocolate, dark fruits, bananas foster, insanely rich, sweet brown sugar/molasses, just great. Taste is just as good, lots of toffee coated figs and raisins, brandy and oak, alcohol, vanilla, rum raisins, chocolate, bourbon, date pudding, caramelized bananas, toast, simply amazing. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, low carbonation, warming, alcohol hidden very well, really coats your mouth and is insanely smooth for such a big beer. Very long finish, very rich, one of the best liquids I've ever put in my mouth."
"Overall this was a very nice treat. I would have expected this would need more aging but is very good as is. I am very impressive with Lost Abbey. Good beer."
"Thankfully I have one more to treasure and savor for a future date!!! A must try beer if you get the chance!"
"I am glad to have a couple more of these to age, and to possibly compare side by side with next years batch."
"o man, got this straight from the brewery and poured it into a brandy sniffter. poured a lot darker than expected but thats a good thing. almost opaque with a ruby hue around the edge. the nose offers up brandy, vanilla, and oak. carbonation is perfect for my taste. this is one of the best beers i have ever drinken. im holding onto my remaing bottles for special occasions only."
"Incredible. Pours a caramel brown, almost opaque with a thick creamy head and contiuous lacing. Nose is big brandy at first followed by caramel, chocolate, dark fruits and if taken in altogether without picking them out it smells like plain yogourt. Big brandy up front but not boozy whatsoever. Chocolate, brown sugar, caramel and dark fruits all take their turn on your pallate then a smooth as silk brandy finish. Insanely drinkable and I couldnt detect half the abv. A world class libation."
"D: There was a decent amount of hype surrounding this beer as there is surrounding Dark Lord. When I finally tried Dark Lord for the first time, I was a bit disappointed. Tasting The Angel's Share for the first time was the exact opposite. This beer is as good as, if not better than the hype as far as I'm concerned. The ease of drinking for a beer of this ABV is incredible and the flavor profile is outstanding. This really is a world class beer."
"Bottle shared at the Beer Bistro in Toronto. Gotta splurge sometimes! Dark murky beer with minimal head. Nose is off dark chocolates and fruit- not what I expected for a barleywine! Taste- sublime- the brandy aging has turned this into a very unique beer. Hops are subdued, so really not that much bitterness. Just silky thick tootsie roll, plums and raisins, and vanilla sweetness (to name a few). Almost seems like more Belgian Quad than barleywine. Great sipping beer, but still dangerously drinkable. No hotness to speak of, just pure heaven."
"This is sad..."
"There is a reason everbody wants this stuff, it is amazing and I wish I had not traded so many of my bottles already, I do not think any barrel aged beer will ever live up to the quality of this one, trade whatever you have in order to get a bottle of this and you will not be sorry, I recommend this over them all, this beer is practically perfect"
"**How can I leave the above review intact? This no longer reflects the Brandy Barrel Angel's Share that has been released. Apparently the flat, un-carbonated monstrosity that I purchased at an inflated price was ""intended"" as an ""English Barleywine"" with absolutely no carbonation, and I was just too dumb to realize it. I will average the scores of one of my favorite beers, and come up with something that reflects the two vintages."
"While I was expecting this to be at least good, I really am impressed how good this really is. This beer really works quite well with the brandy barrel. This is truly and enjoyable sipping brew, as the label states, 750ml is definitely a good size for slowly sipping & savoring amongst friends. I really like the flavors found in this brew as well as the silky textures of the body / mouthfeel; the two really compliment each other quite well. I can't actually the texture of this beer being any better for this particular set of flavors. I really think more brewers need to explore this particular barrel type, as I just transferred a bunch of a Belgian-style Quad from a Heaven Hill Brandy barrel (same type of barrel used here I believe), that is shaping up to be quite phenomenal as well. Speaking of which, the brandy character really seems to move this beer into the realm of a strong, dark, Belgian beer like a Quad; ultimately, I think this is why I like this beer so much, barrel & barley wine did not really excite me that much, but little did I realize that the combination would evoke the complexity & fruit character that I like so much in a really good Quad. Quite surprisingly (at least to this lover of funky beers), this is easily, objectively (removing the situational aspect) the best beer I have ever had from Tomme. I really wish I had at least a couple more bottles of this batch as I have a feeling it is going to age quite well. Without the barrel character (brandy & oak derived), this beer would merely be at most good and more like just decent; really it is the marriage of all of the components of this brew that make it so incredible."
"Chocolate rules! Here is a barleywine well malted by the includion of quality chocolate, and must lead to an increase in score. Because of the darker look, the sweeter chocolate smell, and of course the Hershey chocolate taste with brandy from the barells. Above average mouthfeel. Better more complex barleywines, Belgiums? Of course. A very expensive choice of $70 bomber all-in at Beerbistro."
"Taste: Quite rich but never going overboard, the barrel-aging is just at the right level where Brandy and Rhum flavors are present but without draining out the body. The booze flavor is there but without the burning or harshness you can find sometimes, only a nice warm feeling in the throat at the very end. The body is quite malty and easy to drink, even at near room temp. Surprising how it can seem so simple in one sip, then throw you for a loop the next. It just evolved and flowed, and deserves all the hype and then some."
"Pours a dark brown in color with ruby and copper hues in the light, a good sized coffee and cream colored head slowly recedes. Aroma is big and rich, sweet dark fruits, prunes, figs, and raisins. Some nice buttery caramel as well as some strong leather, saltiness, and a grapey sweet boozy brandy aroma. Also a hint of sweet red licorice. Taste follows the aroma, nice raisin and prune barleywine characteristics, a decent sized grapey-ness, somewhat bready, buttery caramel is also present in the taste up front. Finish is a blend of dry woodiness/oak and a very nice warming alcohol. Medium to heavy in body, not overly thick or cloying, the dryness from the hops and the wood adds a nice balance to the malty sweetness. An outstanding beer, the best I've had thius far from the lost abbey. Definitely belongs in the american barleywine category, my favorite style, rather than strong ale. You can smell this one over and over and it excellent each time, the brandy comes thru quite well in the aroma. Glad to have an extra to lay down for a little."
"D: The oak is strong in this one. Brilliant. Im totally digging these alternatively barreled versions of beer. Brandy barrels, sherry barrels, bourbon barrelsbring it!"
"The beer poured a deep brown, slighty amber body with a thick tan, almost redish hugh with some solid lacing around the glass. The nose is a bit malty, sweet and had a touch of wood and the high abve. The taste is complex and has some nice wood notes, high abv which brings out some characteritics of a port or brandy. This is a sipping beer and with a nice full body, I can see why. Another treat from Lost Abbey."
"D- This is an amazing beer. It really is a sipper with these such strong flavors but it really pulls it all off in my eyes. Can't see myself sitting with a better sipper for a special occasion. This was a great choice for my 300th brew. After coming soo close to finishing it I think it can get kind of sickly I think it would be better in a 12oz. When you finish it you would still be craving more. It has taking me about close to 3 hours to drink it. It's great just gets kind of cloggy and sickly near the end. Still a great brew I just had to take some points away from it."
"Originally reviewed November 24, 2006. 750 mL Bottle. Aroma is running away and just out of reach initially. There are some insanely, entirely rich bourbon brandy emaciated currants with toasted almost, with bright estery yeast notes. Very warming alcohol, with barrel drawing a bite in the nose. Luxious matuer fruit. The aroma wakes up and glows a little stronger with a little more warmth and swirling. Flavor is so completely delicious, with amazing bourbon touches and a heavy head of canded fruit, sugared mango and crystallized ginger. The beer complexity is lightly muddled and condensed into a sweet, creamy dense flavor. The flavor starts with a real tangy, bright sweet pear, then ascends to a rich malt creaminess over brandy flavor, with piquant yeast richness following. Then a rising phoenix of flaming alcohols appear from the dust. The alchol is enlightening and scorches the nostrils, but its not disconcerting. This beer is young and will only get better with time and the alcohols that are perceptible are actually astonishingly characterfull, so they are well appreciated. Even notes of earth and woody mingle in, with a genuflection on the altar of a competely seductive malt character. Figs in honey, maple syrup candy next to hazlenut-chocolate wafers all in one. It reminds me of living in Amsterdam and going down to the market street in the morning and getting large, fresh hot sticky syrupy stroopwafels right off of the griddle and eating them right there at the stall, fresh of crusty caramel and wafer. Finish continues amazing complexity, with bright Chinese cassia, blended aromatic pink and white pepper and redolent in tawn fruit. Oh wow, its getting hard to explain all the permutations of this beer. Barrel character is only helpful, and thats what makes this beer so astonishing. It doesnt get out of hand or overwhleming, a true team player, adding yet another exciting delicious level. Finally, a closing curtain of grassy mentholness, with some sou spice and a few more bright yeasty esters in juniper. This beer has complete complexity and is an all around winner. Subtleness and exacting execuation make this beer tops, with astounding dry clarity and total excellence. I appreciate the ability to clearly distinguish all the nuanced characters individually and culture appreciate for the niches of this beer. An amazing opportunity."
