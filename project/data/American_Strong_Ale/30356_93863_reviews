"Overall quite good."

"Tastes of scorched caramel, earthy malts, accompanied by a gentle pleasant oakiness. A spicy, burning boozines gets calmed by sweet malts and hints of vanilla, while the wooden oak notes settle down on the back of the palate. Has a high, sparkling carbonation, which pushes malt sweetness on a detectable level during the finish, with warming, wooden alcoholic hints in the background."

"(O)- A big beer, but well balanced and well integrated with the barrel notes."
"Verdict: I'm not sure the base beer held up to the barrels, but there is a lot of complexity. The balance is poor for the most part, but it's still an enjoyable brew. It's big, bold and pretty in your face, but it's remarkably quaffable. My glass was nearly empty before I knew it."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied verging on full, with an excellent level of fine carbonation. By no means does it drink to the level of its ABV. Just about perfect. Overall extremely impressed with this. Just about a perfect level of barrel aging presence. I need to pick up more of these. I have been extremely impressed with every Prairie Artisan beer I have tried, and this one is no exception. Very good."

"O- This is a big beer but well blended and cut with some nice alcohol makes this a great sipper. It would be nice to have a bit more malt forward but it is still very tasty."

"Very tasty, the heft does get to you rather quickly. I preferred this on draft vice the bottle I tried months ago. If I ever see any more bottles I will scoop em up. They will age nicely I'm sure"

"Deep brown, short-lived khaki head that collapses to a few swamp bubbles. Big booziness right off the bat. Working through that some thick caramel, prune, ripe apple, coarse wood, toffee, and a dusting of coffee grounds. More booze on the finish, huge whiskey note. Much more like a massive English barleywine than any type of brown ale. Carbonation is low, even taking style into consideration. Lots of flavors going on, the booziness is a little much even for a 13% barrel aged beer. I wish I had another one of these to try in a year."

"Overall - Good flavors, but it's really boozy. Not what I expected at all."

"O - the whiskey barrel presence is prominent and the base beer is difficult to appreciate. I think I'd would have liked this much better with some age, but I'm not convinced the base beer is where it needs to be in the flavor department for an outstanding rating."

"Carbonation is good, a touch on the high side, but I think it moves the beer along. This is a fantastic barrel aged beer. Prairie is for real, they know what they're doing. Standard lineup, check. Funky brews, check. Barrel aging, check. Keep an eye out for these folks."

"Low C+"
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and whiskey aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and whiskey flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of a woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a slightly better barrel aged presence in the smell."

"Big flavors all around. The gums go numb after swishing this stuff around in your mouth. It packs a punch and delivers on flavor. Lots of whiskey, vanilla, with just the right amount of chocolate. As big as this beer is, I found myself taking bigger drinks than I would normally for this kind of brew. It's good to see that Prairie has another side."

"Very nice! Love how the complexity of flavors all gel together smoothly. Another impressive offering from the brewery and probably my favorite of theirs so far."

"O-This comes across as an English Barleywine that spent some time in a barrel more than a brown ale. Beautifully balanced and integrated while remaining somewhat assertive. A real treat"
