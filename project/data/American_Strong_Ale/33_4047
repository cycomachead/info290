Pours a bright ruby red, with a one inch white head that settles fairly quickly, leaving behind little streams of lace. Smell is raspberry, biscuit, dark fruit, caramel, honey, and hints of vanilla. Taste is tart raspberry up front, vanilla, biscuit, caramel, and plum. Body is almost medium, nice carbonation, a little dry, and very drinkable for 9%.

Tastes fruity and tart, some Carmel, English bready yeast. In two different glasses one was poured more vigorously and it mellowed it out quite a bit, it knocked the carbonation down and it accentuated the fruit.

Smells sweet and malty with layers of caramel, raisins, cherries, toffee, lightly tart raspberries. The flavor starts off sweet with caramel and toffee, but almost immediately is overcome by raspberries. The raisins, cherries and prunes battle to be the dominant flavor half way through and linger with a bit of fusel alcohol in the finish. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, medium body and level of carbonation.

It leaves me with the impression of being a fruity carbonated cocktail that my wife or non beer drinking friends would probably enjoy. Medium to full in the feel, the carbonation level was quite low.

I enjoyed this on Christmas and my Mom and wife elected to partake in sharing the beer with my brother and me. I found it a good strong ale w/ raspberry flavor, but I couldn't really see more than 1/2 a bomber in a sitting. It is pretty dry and tastes like it would have been better fresh.

As it warms, it loses a lot of the bitterness, making for a much easier drink, and the malt starts to shine through a bit more, At room temp, becomes more of a strong fruit beer rather than a weak strong ale or barleywine. The raspberry provides a nice little tang, and while it doesn't have so much as a kick as it did right out of the fridge, there's still a bit backing it.

It has a rosey copper color with a goodly oatmeal color head and great lacing. The aroma is a pleasantly sweet raspberry/cherry over very subtle malt bread. Enticing if you accept the fruit side of beer. The taste is a bit shocking with syrupy fruit, sweet and tart, a dry wine-like bite on the tongue. The feel is a bit thin with tiny bubblage. Not very drinkable though, sort of chokes you with the tart power that overwhelms any hint of what might make this a barleywine in any traditional sense. Of course, I now see that this is apparently not a barleywine and that makes sense, but doesn't much change my mind on the overall rating.

Could pick up the berry with slight sweetness. Left some bitterness on the tounge at the back end of the sip, along with some tingling. Tingling was interesting in the mouth, but didn't detract too much, but the stickiness/sweetness kinda hit it a little.

The aroma definitely is of fruit, but not sure if it clearly comes across as raspberry but regardless it is a nice scent. Also you are able to pick up a malt and alcohol scent that mixes nicely. The taste is extremely smooth with a creamy texture. Has a nice sweet flavor that breaks to a tart finish, which is very good and different from most fruit beers I have had in the past. I am not picking up much of any hops but I would imagine that they are there just hidden. As the brew warms the alcohol becomes more evident but goes nice with the other tastes. I think I would get a little tired of this brew if it came in a larger offering than the 22 oz (which would be crazy) but is why I am giving a little lower rating on the drink ability. This is another excellent brew from BBC, not the normal offering I would get but now that I have had it, I would get it again and recommend it.","Stimack","Apr 10, 2007"

I was expecting your typical wheat beer with a bunch of fruit flavoring dumped in post fermentation, as is the case with many of the ""flavor added"" fruity ales. This one is different. The color is quite reddish and enticing. It doesn't have much of a head and very little carbonation. This is a strong beer with an alcoholy warmth to it, slightly like a liqueur in mouthfeel. The taste is smooth, a little on the syrupy side, with plenty of good ole raspberries. There isn't much of a hoppy bite at all, which is good because it would have diminished this ale and what it is trying to do. The back end is where the alcohol lingers the most and where it is most pronounced. This is a strong ale at 9% ABV, but it doesn't taste quite that strong because the complexity of the elements masks the strength to a point, but only to a point. It comes through as mentioned on the back end. This is a very nice ale, a pleasant surprise, and one worth coming back to, especially when some warmth is needed. L'Chaim","albern","Apr 06, 2007"

If I didn't know this was a 9% beer I would have never got that from the taste. The sweetness and fruit overpowers the alcohol. Feels very smooth in mouth, not too much carbonation.

As i recall, with the exception of the Coffeehouse Porter, this was the first Berkshire beer i tried back in the dizzle. It poured a really lovely pinkish color, unlike anything I have seen in the recent past. Minimal head on this one, but a nice white lace to compensate. As it warmed, smells of tart rasberries showed up, as well as some other mild berry aromas. Taste was on par with the tart rasberry aspect, but there was a slight problem. Another reviewer had mentioned that the alcohol was too much; I whole heartedly agree. Sometimes that syrupy sweet alcohol flavor can simply become too much to handle. That was the main thing that dragged this beer down a bit in my book. It was not too heavy, but the alcohol could have been a bit more well hidden. One 22oz was more then enough for me. Having said that, this is still by no means a beer to skip. Im surfe many would enjoy it quite a bit. This being my third time sampling this brew, I would probably say that I will get it again before it goes on hiatus. Bottom line is that this beer is one of the better fruit beers in the New England area, right up there with #9 and some of the Boston Beer Works fruit beers. Cheers","jamie2dope","Feb 07, 2007"
