"I think a snifter of this was gonna be $10 or $12, so I opted to get a dollar or two sample of it... I'm glad I did. While this beer has an awesome heat I'd expect from a strong ale, and a super nice, fresh hoppiness and ALSO some solid balance, the price is just kind of crazy to me, especially since it's not even barrel-aged or anything. If this were a bit cheaper, I'd probably score it higher, as unfair as that probably is. I really do like the taste of this one though, it just doesn't warrant the price tag -- fresh hops, warming alcohol, nice combo of both sweet and bitter... pretty nice beer."
"3rd of the night after Raven's loss. Slight step behind Sawtooth, but next time will try side by side, just to be sure."

"Aroma is malts, fruit, toffee and leather. The flavor is fruit, malts, toffee, slightly coarse texture, slight liquor notes, mild alcohol and a tangy/sour finish."
"Intentionally the opposite of smooth."

"Overall - A pretty good American Strong Ale if maybe a little rough round the edges... definitely worth a try though..."

"Overall (4): Comes across as an aggressively hopped English Strong Ale.  Quite tasty and decadent, even if it is a little rough."
"overall: Frankly, a little disappointed from an admittedly spoiled beer lover. Maybe a bad bottle? Maybe it needs some age."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 6/10/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine/grassy hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, citrus peel, pine, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, light roast, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine/grassy hops and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately crisp/sticky, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial ESB style. All around great balance and complexity of citrus/pine/grassy hops and dark/bready malts; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"O - A very impressive beer. Lots of flavor and doesn't rely on a ton of hops to accomplish it. Would make a great fall sipper. I'll be looking for it again"

"Cooper color. Finger and a half head with nice retention and fine patches of lace. Nonspecific malt aroma. Smooth and nutty. Rich malty flavor of oats, wheat and a touch of roasted nuts. Assertive earthy hops. Well balanced. Full bodied. Good carbonation. Malty texture. Tasty stuff."
"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted July 2014. Purchased at Costco."

"back after a long hiatus, this is essentially double sawtooth ale, so a double esb, and i think its wonderful. rich and more american than english on the hop front, but with a real sturdy and classic english malt base. the alcohol is high, but its well hidden in this smoothed out feeling drink, than improves with temperature. copper in color, mostly clear, decadent looking with a tall and foamy white head. malt first and hops on the back end in both nose and taste. distinct flavor elements include an herbal complexion, culinary herbs, maybe bay leaf, as well as unlit smokes, birch syrup, and tangerine zest. its dynamic, and i appreciate the interesting hops here, its a necessary twist in a style of beer that i dont think gets played with enough. it comes in layers, and is far more complex than i expected it to ever be. mouthfeel is full bodied but well carbonated, frothy in feel, palate coating, and a little resinous from the hops. finish is long and bitter, yet clean feeling, and extremely satisfying overall. a beautiful american take on the english classic. i hope this one sticks around."
"O: Think of an extra special bitter, which is not necessarily bitter, but balanced, and then make it a double (Imperialized)... a real nice drink if you know what you're getting. Rich and relatively dense, sticky and toffee-sweet, with dull and mild resinous bittering. Strong ale but not necessarily American-style."

"I have been a fan of Evil Dead for a while now... Anyway, this stuff pours a murky and brackish brown topped by a finger of glowing khaki foam. The nose comprises wet cardboard and buttery toffee backed by some very light orange peel. The taste holds notes of dry biscuit, orange peel, light earthy greens, very light tobacco, and a general sense of something musty hanging around, malingering in pain. It's an improvement on the smell, but that ain't sayin' much. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this stuff just seemed messy, dirty, in ways it shouldn't. Definitely not a fan."

"On tap at Left Hand. Pours a mahogany color. Really sweet and boozy. Ick. Some hops after that initial impression, but still, really didn’t enjoy this."
""
""
"Overall this is a passable beer. I had one that was aged 4 years and it really turns into a nice malt bomb but on tap it is somewhat uninspiring."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Light beige head, moderate retention, atop a deep mahogany body. Sticky, suddsy and oily lacing. Aroma includes caramel malts, raisins, brown sugar, caramel, maybe a touch of nougat, fruitcake. Taste is quite sweet, no alcohol noted, again fruitcake comes to mind, sweet maltiness. Pretty unique and tasty beer, very easy to drink."
""
"Pours gold with a nice white head. A huge malt forward aroma offering some butterscotch taffy, a little nutty, a slight infusion of some fruit, and a little hops in the finish. Flavor is defined by the malt offering a big butterscotch taffy base that is supported by some nut, some fruit (citric in nature) and a ever so slight bitter, hoppy finish. Alcohol is disguised quite well in this.. A fuller, creamy body. Overall, I generally don't enjoy butterscotch but had no problems with this one here, this was definitely one of the better non-dark beers by Left Hand. Would gladly drink this one again."

"Overall – Fairly nicely hopped brown ale. It starts sweet and finishes more hoppy but does so with a nice smooth transition."

"Overall a nice one off beer in fact not very ESB at all. Hides the ABV well and drinks just as good. Not bad for a one time thing."
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange brown with a small, rapidly dissipating head. Light piney hops aroma. Mild malt and dark fruit up front with a mild spicy malt and hop finish. Pleasant, but not all that interesting. A satisfactory one time ale."

"This poured out as a nice brownish color. The head was a light tan color with a decent retention to it. The lacing is a little scattered but looks ok. The smell of the beer has a subtle sweetness to it. There are aromas of toffee and sweet malts on the nose. The taste of the beer is also quite nice. Some boozy characteristics with some heavier malt flavors and a nice caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel was decent. Overall I feel this beer was good but nothing overly spectacular. I would drink it again for sure but I wouldn't hunt it down."
"D - Really a great beer, could drink this all night."
"Overall, a nicely balanced and slightly warming, soft creamy sipper. Very well done."
"A slow sipper with lots of complex character that runs deep. Sawtooth is a light ESB so I really was expecting something similar, Chainsaw is more of a hybrid between a Belgian Dark and an ESB with extra alcohol kicked in. If there was oak and vanilla in this it would be a clone of Odell's Woodcut No. 3 and I mean that in the nicest way."
"O - I like it but not sure if I'd make another special trip for a bottle. I sit here and wonder if heat may have played a small role in the overall quality of this bottle, the place I bought it from was running no AC on a 90 degree day, and it's been hot all week."
"Medium to thick in the mouthfeel but still smooth. Nearly no notice of the alcohol. Very well done.,"
"D - Very drinkable. Well balanced and complex flavors and fairly strong. Very smooth for a relatively high abv (9%). The fruity flavors really blend nicely with the rest of the beer."
"A heavy body. Smooth and thick. A good mix of dark fruit flavors from the malt and earthy, herbal hops. The hops definitely dominate but this big beer still has plenty of malty flavors. The finish is a little sweet and"
"This pours murky brown and has nice fluffy off-white head. The smell is malty and sweet with some citrus. The flavor has a unique dark raison flavor, but unlike other beers similar to this one, it isn't dominated by an overly sweet, syrupy aftertaste. There is a nice bitter balance that keeps you coming back for another drink. I will say this is one of the more complex and mysterious tasting beers that I have had, there is a spicy brown sugar taste that is interesting. I cannot get over the drinkability. I really thought that this 9% ABV would overtake this beer. Instead, it is a well balanced bitter beer that is a welcome change from the usual overly hoppy and sweet beers that I tend to choose."
"d: Surprisingly drinkable for being big and complex."
"Pours a murky orange. Lots of head off the pour. Pretty despite the murkiness. Malt on the nose. Nothing else really. HUGE malt profile. Lots and lots of malt on the tongue. Toasts in the background. Tons of caramel and very sweet. Hardly and ESB (which apparently its a double ESB). Thick and almost creamy on the tongue. Very drinkable. Clearly a tribute to cellaring"
"very nice when it mellows out."
"Not a bad beer this way, but let this one get close to room temps and sip it more like a brandy!"
"Despite some (mild) gripes, this is pretty drinkable for a nine-percenter. There are enough flavors to take hold of, and that long bitter finish is good. I guess it's another good-but-not-great Left Hand beer for me..."
"Drinkability - I liked it so much on tap at the Catskellar (thanks Adam!) that I had to grab a bomber. It's better on cask, more flavor development and softer hop profile, but this one's decent as well."
"Pours a dark amber withs light brownish hue, a bit cloudy, and tightly bubbled white head that dissipates to a thin rim layer. Nose is lighter than I anticipated, with some toffee standing out. On the palate that toffee is there again, overall rather sweet, with some overripe fruit on the hoppy side to round it out somewhat. A bit of alcohol warmth on the finish and back of the palate. The sweetness helps to make it more drinkable while cold, but as it warms it becomes more of a sipper."
"Drinkability: probably the scariest part of this beer is how drinkable it is. The alcohol burn is not enough to stop you from drinking it. The flavor and overall experience makes this beer an all night affair. I'm almost done with 64 oz growler and wish I had another. I could see this as a house beer, but luckily have some common sense. Definitely an occasional treat. Wish I could brew this"
"D - Pretty easy to drink, despite a bit of alcohol burn. Definitely got easier to drink as it warmed up. I didn't know what to expect from this one but I was pleasantly surprised by how different it tasted. I'll have this again."
"The beer pours a hazy brownish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is alcohol, candi-sugar and brown sugar. The beer smells fairly boozy. The flavor is brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D- Drinkable as hell for the content of alcohol and a excellent beer for a strong ale."
"D: A pretty big drink with big intentions. A bomber should sit well here."
"Drinkability: solid big esb, nice and hoppy. Not typical of the brewery."
"Drinkability: Sadly, the stinging bitterness and the hot, glaring alcohol, even in a seemingly sensible ten ounce size, was a bit much for me. Anybody want to split this with me? Having said that, it's still decent albeit coarse."
"For the abv it's very drinkable. It has a dark brown color with a very dark head. Flavor is malty with a good amount of hops. Very easy to drink and I look forward to my next one."
"The bottle art isn't all that appealing, but that isn't what we buy the beer for, I suppose. The brew itself pours a beautiful copper color, with a strong head that lasts a good while without clinging to the glass. The smell is quite loud, the kind that leaves you wondering what lies beneath the bubbles. Sure enough, it is a very tasty beer; a strong entry from Left Hand. There is a nice, lingering hops. The beer is quite heavy, and that would be the main knock; certainly, however, a good choice overall."
"D: Good hop character. A bit resiny in the mouth and on the tongue. Disguides the abv very well."
"Nice brew. Bold and fairly balanced."
"D - I liked it the price wasn't bad you get a nice bang for your buck. Would definately have again."
"Bottle opened with a nice ""pop"". Poured with a decent tan foamy frothy thick head. Color is a cloudy medium to dark amber. Nose is malt caramel fresh cut grass hops. Flavor is like aroma but much more intense; plus, at first there was a metallic tinge and then it's just a big barley wine. Body is what I'd expect, full and it has great carbonation for this style. Finish is like a good barley wine- huge and bittersweet. Actually reminds me of several homebrewed barley wines."
"D - Pretty good overall. I don't love it, but am glad I've tried it. Satisfies the craving for a big strong ale that's got depth and strong on hops without being too much of either. Alcohol is a little strong, but not out of whack, actually adding a lot of spicy character to the beer."
"D: Wow this brew packs a punch but if one paces himself he could sip on all night."
"This beer really scratched an itch for me. I was a little tired of ""American Strong Ales"" being either overly hoppy, overly sweet, or overly boozy. Absolutely great balance. This really does feel like a bigger brother of the light, delicious Sawtooth Ale. Pretty affordable, too. I am definitely picking up another bottle soon. Great strong ale for the miserable Florida summer."
"Drinks fairly easy for the style & ABV. The first time I had this it seemed like a rough around the edges DIPA, this is better, & one of the better offerings from left hand that skews hoppy IMO"
"This beer is a Double IPA but it has an aggressive sweet tone, plastic phenol, strong alcohol character that hurt the drinkability in the end. Still, a pretty good beer... just wondering how good it could get."
"DB- Price is OK. It is very nice to get a beer with such a crazy peach aroma and taste. I did not expect it in the least. A very unique beer that one would want to show to their friends and possible new beer enthusiast prospects. It is drinkable, the peach holds its ground and no off-flavors exist. What a crazy beer."
"Truly unique and delicious offering from left hand. I love it."
"Thanks to Softball John for the tip. Go Lab Rats!"
"Much better than Sawtooth ESB, the single version. Flavorful but not overwhelming, and well-balanced. Not just that, but damned near sessionable despite the ABV, and I could drink it any time of year."
"No hint of being a high alcohol double, very drinkable"
"Nothing earth shattering, but still tasty stuff. I'll happily order this again."
"D: A bit sweet, but hoppy enough that it would go with a fish or poultry dinner."
"Tastes sweet up front, like buttertoffee and fuggles. This moves into a slightly earthy middle and a finish of west coast American hops that are citrusy and bitter. Nicely complicated, and an absolute lack of alcoholic nodes belies its high ABV."
"Overall I'd been wanting to try this beer for quite a while as I was a big fan of the Sawtooth, but it just didn't do it for me. The flavors are too strong for what worked well in a subtler beer. Worth trying but not worth seeking out."
"(D)- Definitely was disappointed with this one; not at all what I was expecting. The $13 price tag made it even more disappointing. Has a fruit profile, but is still lower on the hop strength profile, not to mention the almost non-existent malt profile. I would expect this type of character from a pale ale or an ESB, but not at all from an american strong ale."
"D: Sawtooth on steroids pretty much sums this one up. It's a very nicely done beer overall."
"Flavors are similarly over-ripe, with a sweet and somewhat miraculous undertone of berries. Caramel sweetness is deeper than in the nose, with hops jumping forward. Edible flowers, green herbs, and grapefruit zest lead the way. Medium body, maybe a little full due to the low carbonation. Finishes hoppy and allows the almost syrupy berry component to take over. Booze is well-hidden, and overall it's a solid package."
"On a side note, the new bottle design is awesome. Left Hand needs to redesign everything else they have while they are at it."
"D. Man, this beer did next to nothing for me. The beer ""guy"" at my local bottle shop recommended this. I guess I should have ignored him and grabbed the Founders Porter is was eyeing up. One of these is more than enough for me."
"Pours a slightly hazy red with amber edges, fast fading thin white head, couple of dots of lace. Smell: an astringent lemon (""we need more lemon Pledge""), leafy, toffee, cherry cough syrup. Taste: caramel, citrus peel, Capri Sun Cherry. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, nothing special, cherry cough syrup finish. This is really horrific, it tastes like a cherry Capri Sun with a big medicinal finish. Up until this, I was on the fence with Left Hand... hadn't been impressed but nothing was bad... this is just bad. You're off my christmas card list Left Hand! (2/3rds of bomber down the drain)."
"I really like Sawtooth, and a number of other Left Hand beers for that matter, but this is no Double Sawtooth. I've enjoyed few beers less."
"Good drinking for a Strong Ale. Neither bitter nor sweet, and with a clean finish."
"Drinkability is okay. While the alcohol is well-concealed, this one is a bit messy and off-balanced."
"Got this for $4, and at that price I would definitely consume this bad boy again....and again"
"It was slightly silky feeling on the tongue, smooth and a bit syrupy. Lots of Hop pine bite at the end."
"A 750ml corked bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear crimson amber with about an inch of light ecru foam. Nose and flavors consist of caramel malt, brown sugar, biscuits, floral hops, apples. Approaching full bodied but not quite there and amply carbonated. Worth trying if you like the style."
"Without a doubt, this beer will not satisfy hopheads, but it is an excellent choice for anyone that loves malt. Not as fruity as an english barleywine, but every bit as complex and enjoyable, maybe even more. This is my first taste of Left Hand's beer, and I look forward to trying more."
"Drinkability is solid for such a high abv. smooth and balanced, with some great flavors that make an interesting brew. It has some english barleywine notes that give it a bit more character and depth than the usual strong ale. One I'd definitely seek out again."
"D- Enjoyable in many ways, drink it with or without food. I forgot to mention alcohol characteristics because they weren't noticeable."
"Drinkability - Maybe this one has been cellared too long and the age has taken it's toll. This one seems more of a barleywine to me, but it's definitely an enjoyable drink."
"Color is a deep cloudy mahogony color with white wisps of head on the top. Leaves nice alcoholic lacing around the edges. Smell is deep caramel malts and some rich toffee and slight citrus hops. Taste is pretty much like the nose. Caramel malt is right there with sweetness and slight citrus hops carry it a little farther. A slight alcohol taste at the end. This is pretty low carbonation but its rather thick and chewy. It has some high viscosity to it as well. Overall its a pretty decent brew. Worth a shot."
"The taste leans towards the malty end of the spectrum, but there is a firm piney and floral hop flavor that is very nice. Caramel buttermilk biscuit flavor is unique. Hides the ABV well. It's a good, easy drinking big beer, but not sure it is quite worth the high price tag ($11 for 750mL)."
"A American strong ale with more bitter flavours and alcohol than I had expected. Still, a fine beer with that special Left Hand hop profile."
"Mouthfeel is great. Nicely carbonated and textured. I almost want to chew it. Nicely syrupy without being too thick. Like I said on the ABV, it's hard to find. That being said, I could sit and drink a full 750mL of this without an issue, which I am going to finish doing, now that I am finished with this review."
"Fairly drinkable but not really my thing; I would recommend it for those who are into the malts."
"D: This certainly isn't a terrible beer, but when comparing to the original Sawtooth there is no comparison. Sawtooth is a wonderful beer...making a higher ABV version doesn't go so well. I'm glad I tried it, but it certainly won't be a regular in the rotation."
"I probably won't drink this beer in the future."
"A decent brew. Seems it was last brewed in early 2008, I probably would have enjoyed this more if it were fresher."
"Chainsaw Ale doesn't exactly carve a wide swath through the American strong ale style, but it does carve out its own little niche. Even at the slightly high price of $12.99, I'd be happy to fire this baby up again. But first, I need to ease my way into the evening with the final half of this one."
"Has a medium body and a prominent alcohol heat that lasts throughout the session."
"D- Not bad at all, I'm really enjoying this one. Overall, this is one of the better offerings I've had from Left Hand. Highly recommended!"
"Not trying to be a style cop, but I'd definately call this one a barleywine. Pours anice amber with a tan head. The nose has sweet sugary malts and subtle citrus hops. The taste is not too complex. Candy malts balanced by bitter hops. Medium to full body is well carbonated. Overall, a bit light, but still quite good."
"Pours a cloudy light-ish brown/red colored body, with a slightly off-white head. Has a very nutty aroma, and maltiness. A very malty taste, somewhat acidic. Also has a corn syrup sweet-like taste. Not too bad for a malty beer."
"D: Damn drinkable. Left Hand does in fact make some real nice brews. Hopefully more and more will find their way into Florida."
"Has a strong, malty aroma with a fruity overtone, mainly apple, so it smells more like fruit juice than beer. Pours a very appetizing translucent cola brown with a very thick, fluffy, light tan head that sticks around for a bit. Flavor is malty with a rather strong alcohol bite and a firm undertone of hops, along with hints of caramel and cinnamon. Texture is very smooth and just a little bit syrupy, leaving a tingly finish that is edgy and hop-bitter but just a tad sweet."
"D - The 25oz bomber is plenty. Good dessert brew or meal replacement. If I were to follow this up with a second beer that beer would be somthing light bodied."
"An excellent American Strong, right up there with Arrogant Bastard. Hazy copper pour with a medium off-white head. Rich aroma of caramel malt, piney hops, and yeast. Nice bittersweet taste of leather, wood, caramel, resiny hops, and a touch of smoke. An all-around excellent beer."
"D - I may need to try this again. I can see this as a dessert and cigars kind of ale."
"A big malty beer for the winter season. Definitely not a sessionable beer. Try it when you can."
"Very drinkable. Its delicious and not too heavy like a stout or something."
"As it warms, there is an unfortunate scented candle flavor from the vanilla but otherwise it's a good strong ale."
"It's rich, full, and complex - how can you go wrong? Certainly worth seeking out!"
"An interesting beer but nothing too special. It isn't the hoppiest beer either, just a strong ale."
"Drinkability- I may have to hunt down a fresh bottle after sampling this one, this is one fine beer from Left Hand."
"Pretty good. A dark, malty, sweet brew."
"D - This was pretty good, but I've had better in this style and at a lower price tag."
"I love Left Hand...especially thier milk stout. This offering, for the high price..will only be bought this time."
"taste is thick and chewy, woody, dark fruit, caramel, malt, hops in the back, finish is dry and nicely bitter."
"D'ability - Fairly high for a strong ale if price were no object...but at $12.99 for a 750 mL bottle, this one will have to be a rare treat."
"Poured this into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. Pours a deep amber brown. Not much of a head with a little bit of lacing along the side. Smell is very sweet, malty with brown sugar and caramel undertones. Taste is much sweeter and maltier than I was anticipating. Hops are present, but not pronounced. Mouthfeel is little thinner than I was hoping for, but it doesn't adversely affect the beer. A moderate amount of carbonation make this beer truly outstanding. One of Left Hand's best."
"Pretty damn rustic ... very smooth and alcohol is pretty well hidden ..'i'm caca for coocoo puffs' ... lacing is premium stuff ... caramel, molasses, some dust, ... a good brew but a stretch at $11 ... nothing spectacular, just the same old left hand bullshit..."
"D- this is a beer that is easy to drink and creeps up on you. It reminds me of stone's arrogant bastard, yet a little more subtle."
"A very tasty brew from Left Hand that i'll be coming back to for sure. One of the best beers from this brewery and hence is recommended!"
"Had this on tap at the 5th Earl Market in Decatur, Georgia. Pours a very dark amber with some orange highlights, almost brown. Good clarity and a very finely beaded light beige head. The smell is very light with some maple, malt, and a trace of piney hops. The taste is highly unusual, but I like it. Quite sweet and with flavors of maple cured bacon in a glass with some piney hops at the end. Meaty, with maple and brown sugar, and some salt. A trifle too sweet, but the hops help begin to balance it. I definitely could only drink one of these no matter how intriguing."
"Had this one on tap at Stud and herb's in Minneapolis. Poured a dark amber/orange color with hints of brown on the edges. Nice amount of foam, but left little, sparse chunks of lacing on the glass. Smell was incredibly malty, delicately sweet, with hints of burnt sugar and tons of caramel. Taste was over-the-top malty. I loved it! Brown sugar, burnt caramel, slight fruity accents in the background, some hints of lemon/lime and a good dosage of hops that are present, but in no way can keep up with the malts. This was one bad boy indeed. Very thick and full bodied, with a nice amount of carbonation. The high ABV was felt even while consuming a huge plate of chili cheese fries, which keeps the drinkability low. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and it was a nice find, and the only place visited that night with it on tap. Excellent."
"Another great brew from Left Hand! Great balance between malt and hops."
"Terrific effort from Left Hand!! One more bottle left and I can't wait for it..."
"this is a great brew! i love the Sawtooth and this is a very apparent Double ESB!"
"Cheers"
"Not retired, as there is a 2008 version now out. I had last year's. Not too hoppy, but significant. Not too malty but significant. An easy drinking, dangerously hidden alcohol. Good head initially. Nothing outstanding but it was enjoable and satisfying."
"A sipper to be sure. At 9% abv, though, it was meant to be. Interesting, tasty, but I don't know that it really held my interest (could be the harshness/astringency) throughout. (Something about it, I suppose). This is an American Strong Ale with some American Barleywine characteristics. Certainly worth having if you want a bigger Sawtooth Ale."
"Drink: Hell yeah! Go for it!... This is a wonderful brew.... enjoy the rich smoothness!"
"Out of the 2008 bottle conditioned 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a pretty chestnut brown color with an excellent dense tan colored head that left a wall of lacing and a fluffy cap. The smell is very malty; a nice roasted presence with a slight pineapple hop aroma. The taste is a nice mellow toasted/roasted malt, caramel, spice, and a very light hint of port. The feel is moderate to full, the carbonation is on the soft side and the finish is excellent, well balanced. Alcohol is well hidden. This is a very fine American ale, well constructed. I need to pick me up an extra bottle or so to age. Looking forward to trying their other 750ml offerings."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D - a most enjoyable brew."
"Recommended..."
"Mouthfeel is a bit oily, smooth. Wish it had a bit more carbonation. Not as drinkable as I would have liked. I still don't know whether I like this beer or not."
"D: An incredibly drinkable beer. It's a shame this was only a one-off, as it has an assertive hop and malt presence, but is still balanced at the same time. Mouthfeel is superb, and it makes for a quaffable delight that I'd love to have more of. Excellent in autumn as the weather has gotten colder."
"M/D: Decent carbonation but not too much. Good creamy mouthfeel. Unfortunately, not very high drinkability due to both alcohol content and alcohol character."
"D: As far as strong ales go, this goes down like water. The taste is not at all imposing. I expect more flavor from a strong ale, but this would be a good way to ease someone into the style. Recommended."
" Overall this was a decent strong ale. Not my favorite in the world, but I would definatly recommend giving it a try. The bottle fermentation leaves alot of yeast in the glass towards the end, and you really gotta love beers that are still alive! A good call and a nice one off selection."
""
"Overall a decent brew, interesting, but nothing that really sets it above others. Might be better during the winter, as heavy as this one is."
"The beer poured a crisp amber with a decent head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was strong on caramel malts with some earthy pine hops. The taste was dominated by both pine hops and syrupy malts. The beer was a little to syrupy in the mouth for me. Even for a 9% beer, a lot of alcohol was present. This one was somewhat of a disappointment compared to my expectations."
"poured from a 750 mi. bottle a cloudy tea color with a tan three finger head that held very well to the finish and lots of lace. aromas of caramel and chocolate and brown sugar all come through. all the same sweet flavors come to your taste buds and then the alcohol warms the finish. light mouthfeel and light carbonation fits this beer well. really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, Chainsaw is competently done but forgettable strong ale. It made for a nice cooking beer when I used in in a beef dish, and I'd like to try it on tap someday to see how it compares when fresh."
"Poured from a 750 ml corked and caged bottle with a painted label that's pretty cool. It poured a dark rich amber. It had a massive 3 finger head that slowly settled into a 1/4'"" foam with good lacing. The smell was hard to pin down but I didn't like it. Not sure how to describe it but some have called it earthy or woody. I can see that but probably more in the earthy vein - damp mud with rotting vegetation maybe. I thought it would detract from the flavor but it didn't once you get the glass away from your nose but that's half the drink. As it warmed, the alcohol became more pronounced in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel was really good. Overall, I liked Sawtooth and most Left Hand beers but this one missed the mark for me. First I've had of the style so it may be the style. (3, NA, N, N)"
"Pours a very dark rusty orange color with a foamy light-tan head that leaves sheets of sticky lace on the walls of the glass as you drink. The aroma seems to be dominated by a woodiness, but there are additional notes of brown sugar, a light fruitiness, and even some cookie dough. Taste begins with sweet malt and a bit of fruity nectarine that is quickly overpowered by bitter citrusy hop resins. The alcohol becomes more pronounced towards the end. Overall, a fairly nice beer, but a horrible value at $13 for a 750ml."
"This came in a 12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. It poured a cloudy bronze color with a slightly off white head. Smells of sweet sweet malts, sugar, caramel, with citrus and some hoppy notes as well. It tastes of caramel and sweet malts but even some slight toasted malts are noticable. Other flavors that are apparent are some sligth fuity flavors with oily slick hops. Slight alcohol taste is present in the finish but not to bad."
"D- Nice big strong flavors. Very nice beer. Would buy more if I could."
"Pours a cloudy burnt orange with a giant tan foamy head, very nice. The is a little light,but you can make out ""bisquity' scents and sweet malt with a floral hop aroma. The taste has alcohol, malt,bitter hops, and a creamy bread yeast flavor.,not bad,but the alcohol is a little harsh. The m/f is medium with the flavors mixing only OK. A decent beer that could use some cellaring."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly thin, doughy yeastiness up front, slightly hot at 9%, and mildly grainy."
"Poured into a .5L mug. Lovely pour, with a solid frothy off-white head forming quickly and lasting long. Color is opaque, cloudy mahogany. Strong aroma of nutty bread crusts and woody hops. Good malt up front but quickly overwhelmed by an all-encompassing pungent bitterness. Tasty but perhaps overdone. Taste becomes more fruity at the end, but mostly what's left is a very long, lingering dryness. Rich, creamy mouthfeel rounds it nicely."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would have liked and the carbonation is a touch low. Drinkability is still good though. Easy to put down for a 9% brew. It has an interesting flavor that seems to be a kicked up Sawtooth (which is how it is labeled). Not the typical strong ale as this one is classified and not the typical DIPA either, but not quite barleywine. I'll go with double ESB."
"Opinion: This beer is pretty interesting, and good in its own way. I am not too big on trying to pigeon-hole a beer, but this one would be hard to classify. It has too dominant of a malt profile to be a IIPA. I would say that it is closer to an American Barley Wine as anything else. This is a pretty good beer, but I dont know if the price would let me partake in this one very often. I am glad I tried it, but I doubt I will be stockpiling this one before it goes away."
"D: Not great but the taste and mouthfeel are so good it gets more points. Still Im happily sucking this baby down."
"Not much carbonation in this beer. After a vigorous pour I still only get big fat bubbles that pop away and give way to a slight foamy head that is just a skim on the top. Body is a murkey reddish brown. Nose has defanent hints of chocolate notes with a malty feel and a hint of anise. A very flat tongue coating feel. It is dark and rich and has a bit of roasted malt. Overall it is a solid drinkable beer but not anything special. Leaves a medium thickness on the mouth. OK brew"
"P.S., scrolling through reviews, I pity blitheringidiot, ...I only paid $11.29, before tax."
"Medium bodied with a dry finish. Even more floaters on the second pour makes it a bit harder to get through the glass. I'm not a fan of the chunks and this has a lot of them."
"Flavor is a bit over the top with quick and sudden hop bite that dies but then is followed with some heat from the alcohol. The malts give this a very sweet malty base. Some pepper and spice too. Very light body that kind of evaporates off the tongue. Rather a dissappointment honestly."
"Last swigs: $18 is not justified."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Somewhat thick, but easy to drink at the same time. Very well balanced, all the flavors work well together without anything being overly dominant. Alcohol warming is present but mild, and hidden pretty well. High ABV limits this to one in a session, but certainly a beer I'll have again."
"Drinkability- Very smooth and drinkable. I like it but don't think it's worth the $13 per bomber. For the money I'd buy 2 Double Bastards."
"D: Not bad. Not very complex and I'm not a fan of that dirty bitterness wash."
"Body is big, silky, and luxurious. Soft pinpoint carbonation lends to a very creamy mouthfeel. A nice beer to try, but worth the price?"
"Overall, it's decent. It's a little sweet and melony. It does have a bitter finish, but the flavors aren't well blended."
"D- This beer has nice complexity and some good balance with the alcohol hidden in the background. The hops really add nice balance to the malts."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty earthy berry overall with some lambic like tartness, but not bad."
"The taste is quite sweet up front, but slowly moves to ample malt character that is not all that sweet in the finish. A dry toasted malt note, evocative of biscuits dominates the finish and leaves an almost salty rich malty note that lingers on in the finish. A solid herbal character is also here, there is a bit of an astringent side to the hop character. The hops though are fairly muted, like a lightly hopped, supped up amber ale. In the end this beer is just not that well integrated, it is rich and malty, but needs some ample hop character to help balance things out. The finish has a touch too much hot alcohol, which tends to un-balance things a bit more. Still drinkable, and even a bit enjoyable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head above the slightly murky reddish brown brew. Plenty of lacing, and the head is pretty quick down to an uneven layer of bubbles. Aroma is a bit hoppy, a bit sweet, but largely boring. Taste is moderately bitter upfront, with ample sweetness kicking in quickly to try to balance. Doesn't quite make it, and the bitterness lingers into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but kind of flat, and drinkability is reasonable. Alcohol is not very apparent in this brew, which could be dangerous. This brew seems to have so much potential in so many areas, I ended up being a bit harsh. But that's the impression I was left with, for better or worse."
"Pours a cloudy brown color with a tall head that hangs around and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma had a lot of caramel character with some fruits along for the ride. The flavor was much the same with a little spice and alcohol. The caramel really comes through in this one. Very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is good."
"Translucent brown appearance with a faint glow in the light. Good yellowish head stays put at an inch in height. Spaced blobs of thinnish lace. Malty aroma, slightly woody with tones of cherry and applewood. Mouthfeel is solid and beefy, carbonation is medium -- together they play well. Overall, a big beer and quite sweet beer, deep in flavor but a bit unidimensional and featuring nectarines, slight mincemeat, and candied fruit. Hops lend a slatey underlayer to the finish, though they seem to show up mainly as bitter flavoring hops without much impact on the smell. Alcoholic senses by the end of the glass. Nothing seems wrong with this beer, but it doesn't shine with outstanding notable characteristics either, and its not a very good value in my opinion."
"Pours a solid dark brown tea color with copper to amber highlites and 2 fingers of off-white head that falls to a full coat over top. Clarity is moderate and I see no carbonation bubbling from the bottom. Nose is rife with puffs of alcohol and deep caramel and just a hint of dark fruit plus an undertone of graineyness. Flavor is nice. Very solid deep caramel and lighter fig and graineyness. A nice peppery hop hits on the finish, playing wilth the alcohol that comes through on the finish. The alcohol is a touch spicey, not hot as I had expected it to be. Feel is moderate with a lack of carbonation. I could use just a hint of bubbles in there to break up the stillness. There is some drying on the side of my tongue on the finish as well. Overall, this one is pretty nice. The alcohol is a little strong in the nose, but otherwise, there is nothing really to complain about."
"Tastes good. Nice citrus hop start turns to malt sweet with a flat (and modest) hop bitter aftertaste. Touch of pine in the hops, which I don't find in sawtooth. Undertone flavors are caramel, fruity esters (melon and pear with a zing), and a dab of molasses. Pretty underwhelming taste. Considering how simple sawtooth is, but the flavors blend so well, I was hoping for much more here. Md-thick body and modest carbonation."
"Hmm a double Sawtooth ale I liked the ""standard"" so I went for the stronger version.Poured a hazed deep amber with a big fluffy slight off- white head that stuck like glue to the glass.Aromas of brown sugar and fruity malt dominate with a noticable peppery hop note,it takes awhile for the flavors to come together it took nearly 3/4 of the bottle for everything to come together but once they did it made for quite a nice beer.Starts out on the sweeter side notes of brown sugar and ripe fruit as it came together better a resiny hop presence became more pronounced with light alcohol burn in the finish.If you wait on this beer its a fine ale the hops provide more balance than character but they do show up on the palate.A nice beer I would buy again I think."
"After much twisting, tugging, pulling, and prying on the wire basket and cork the bottle emitted a nice POP, just the sound I like to hear after a long hard day at the salt mine. Upon the pour from the 750ml brown bottle, the color a bemused brown with a massive semi-creamy light tan head that slowly erodes leaving a thick and sticky sheet of lace to coat the glass. Nose has a nice bit of hop aroma, also some over ripe fruit, Id say pineapple, all back by a bit of earthiness, start is moderately sweet, the grain profile delightful and the top moderate in feel. Finish is light to medium in carbonation; the hops give a nice spicy kick and the end, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a nice drinking beer, but watch the 9 percent ABV."
" Taste is nice and malty. Caramel malt, a grain-like flavor, hops play a supporting role, adding citrus flavors, and balancing the malt. Mouthfeel is bordering on being syrupy, but that is somewhat expected with the ABV. Very drinkable, I don't notice the alcohol in this beer anymore than I notice it in a normal ESB."
"I have to admit to being disappointed by this one. I've had it twice now, once at the Wildland Fire Benefit at the Pumphouse and tonight at the brewery on Boston Ave. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it's just not that interesting. Both times I've noticed a paucity of hops, both in the nose and in taste. There is a whole lot of malt sweetness and a pleasant cereal quality, balanced with an adequate level of bitterness, but it just doesn't have that much going for it. I'll give it one more try, of course..."
"750 ml corked and bailed silk screened bottle."
"Dark copper color, with immense froth. Dull, underwhelming aroma, which is malt accented, but a bit subtle. However, fairly nice flavor balance, with rich malt and hop flavors abound. Smooth, creamy body, with well hidden alcohol. Impressive mouthfeel."
"I finally got to taste this after some delay. This is there bigger and deeper version of sawtooth ale. After a semi aggressive pour it produced a large orange head. The body had a full dark orange tint. The nose was good with wisps of toasted malt sort of a caramel sweetness. The taste had a fruit forward approach mixed with a kind of citrus mouth feel. For being 9% it went down smooth, not over powering. Over all a good product. Any fan of there regular Sawtooth ale would like this and still not be chased away by the alcohol content."
