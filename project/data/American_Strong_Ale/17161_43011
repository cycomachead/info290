Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, char, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, cookie dough, and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid cocoa and fruit aspects, but I am not getting any of the Belgian yeast they supposedly used in this one.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 22, 2014"

3.24,-6.4,3.75,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,"Well, my 12-ounce bottle states the brewery as being Thomas Creek of South Carolina, and the label is a little different than the one shown here. But my research doesn't come up with much evidence and it doesn't seem worth distinguishing any differences here. So, it pours a deep, opaque black color with a giant head of tan foam that settles to a solid layer, but minimal lacing. The aroma emits a pleasant fruit malt idea, perhaps hinting of the alleged pomegranate. The flavor is somewhat striking but also difficult to describe. There is very little of the familiar malt characteristics I expect from something labeled a black ale, especially an imperial black ale. There's a boozy fruit idea, again, arguably pomegranate and apple, that seems to fight with the slightly chocolate malt base. It just doesn't blend well. It's medium bodied with a smooth initial feel but the soda-like fizziness takes over and ends with an unfriendly result that includes some chalkiness. The aftertaste is similarly poor with an odd vegetable-like bite and evidence of some alcohol. Disappointing.","Durge","May 01, 2013"

Solid black pour into a Mack House goblet, a finger or so of foamy tan head that never completely dissipated, and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate malts, a tad roasty and leathery, hints of pine needles and dark fruit. Dark malts up front in the taste, complimented by notes of dark chocolate and coffee, a touch of resinous hops, and a well-defined pomegranate finish that left a slightly bitter aftertaste to offset the otherwise unexpected smoothness of the beer. Body was medium, if this was indeed a CDA, it was one of the most mellow I've had as far as hops/bitterness goes. A good drinker overall, though it seems that ""fresh and on tap"" is the way to go with this one.","Rifugium","Dec 31, 2012"

Now, there is a great stout-like beer in here: roasted malts, nice chocolate, and coffee in the taste and the aroma...it's pleasant. But...you have to cut through this ridiculous sweet, slightly tart pomegranate taste and aroma. It just doesn't work with the stout qualities.

3.25,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"2009...vintage...? It pours a surprisingly opaque black (the pour from the bottle seemed much more ruby-tinged) topped by nearly a finger of darkish ecru foam. The nose is pretty similar to an infected oatmeal stout, with some black cherries hanging all Damoclesianly over chocolate, graham crackers, and cinnamon. The fruit is more pronounced than in an infected bottle, though. The taste starts off fairly similarly, with a blast of chocolate-covered cherries, pomegranate juice, and roasted malts, but the fruits seem to become burnt as the liquid flows to the back of the tongue, eliciting a slight cringe and grimace. The body is a loose medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, this is definitely a strange brew (no Rick Moranis pun intended), not altogether offensive, but also nothing I'd really ask for again.

Appearance is Totally black, thin sticky head leaving some good lacing. Nose is unique, dark chocolate, dark fruits but not in the same sense as a Dubbel, its a thinner aroma, I guess it's the pomegranate? But not so sure. The taste is smokey and burnt malts, dark chocolates, and I can't tell if the presence of pomegranate is because I read it on the label or if it's a substitute for saying ""dark fruits"".. Hmm, Well this beer is sweet, a bit syrupy, and has great flavor of burnt malts that, if I didn't read ""black ale"" on the bottle, I would have guessed the beer to be a baltic porter. Drink- very tastey, I got this from my local store which has a very large rack saying ""mix your own 6"" and I always check it out because often times there are some pretty heady big time beers!

Very odd smelling and not in a good way. Flavor is still burnt with roasted malt and parmesean cheese and a sweet pomegranate finish. Meh, this is very underwhelming. The flavors are just bad.

The pomegranate is just a hint - not overbearing, and not ""artificial"" - Just enough to put a unique ""spin"" on it. Alcohol is still noticeable. It claims that this ages well for 1 to 2 years. It would be interesting to see how it develops. Still, at this point it is an enjoyable ""dessert"" brew, yet in a rather reshreshing way. I did enjoy this more than the other Holy Mackerel, but then, they are completely different beers.

It's reminiscent of a schwarzbier with a bigger mouthfeel, but that pomegranate added makes it different and interesting. Overall it was rather enjoyable, maybe after another year or so aging I could see this being really good when everything mellows out more, but I like this beer now too.

Taste begins with a roasted, malt forward note of burnt toast and roasted nuts. Then comes a plesantly unexpected fruity note full of raspberry, faint notes of pom juice, and some floral tangerine.
