"Aroma: bourbon, malt, vanilla, no hops, Appearance: Dark brown, ¼” head that quickly dissipates. Flavor: rich malt flavors, slight chocolate, caramel, some vanilla with bourbon in the background. A touch sweet but balances the malt and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel: moderate body to moderate full, moderate carbonation. Overall: the bourbon flavor is very well done and the rich malt goes very well with the bourbon barrel aging. The alcohol is there but is not as noticeable as 9.1% alcohol would suggest. It is very smooth and drinkable."

"The nose is relatively light with coconut and chocolate. The flavor has light malt and grain but a stronger chocolate and coconut mid palate to finish. This isn't particularly complex, strong or even interesting but it's a good drinking beer and that's all I'm in it for."

"overall: a nice dark ale, enjoyable and drinkable."

"Overall, it is a good strong ale, a bit hoppy and I have to get used to the dark color, but the mouth feel is nice and full making it an enjoyable drink. The alcohol is well hidden, but jumps up at you about half way through the glass. The flavors of the malts and hops are each pronounced and singular rather than being molded into a smooth blend sharing the glass."

"Had in Vegas at random bar. Haven't heard of Cold Springs brewery on east coast. This starts with a popping 9% and heavy bourbon smell right off he bat. This pours extremely dark with little to no head. Bourbon dominates here with a great malty presence. This separates itself from other strong ales as the alcohol doesn't overwhelm the drink. This would be perfect on a cold day. I will drink it until it gets cold out as a result. Great find"
"Dark brown ale with a light brown head. Has a bourbon aroma and a strong bourbon flavor, with some toasty malts in the mix. Sits nice and warm in the stomach. The bourbon, for me, is a touch overpowering. Highly recommended for those who love the taste of bourbon. Still, I find this a good brew overall."

"O: Knowing nothing about the brewery, but being intrigued by the description of the beer itself, I didn't really have any expectations. That said, this is a great beer. Perhaps not the best of strong oaked/barrel aged beers, but a damn good beer. Definitely recommended if you can find it. I've only seen it at a couple places in the Sacramento area."

"O: Solid brew – nice bourbon malt mix."
""
""

"O- Very nice, balanced and flavorful. Many times with a Strong Ale you taste the Alcohol, not with this. Very Nice. Could get into trouble fast with this one.."
""
""
"O: Flawed yet endearing. That's my takeaway from this. It's hardly perfect, and honestly, that's why I enjoy it so much. This is one of those few beers that take you on a wild ride - some of the stops on the journey aren't the greatest, but the end result is something that leaves you craving for more. I could do another bottle of this, honestly."

"From a 750ml wine-bottle shaped container, the beer pours an intense dark brown...with hints of ruby when held to the light....tan foam tops the beer. The smell is malt and alcohol...some caramel and slightly bunt toffee. The taste is sugary...sweet and boozy. Firm bitterness in the finish. The beer is very full in body, and a little sweet at times."
"Overall far from the best bourbon ale but quite a steal at just $2.69 a bottle. Taste is smooth!"
""
"This is not a bad beer. It kind of reminds me of a roasted malt version of Kentucky Bourbon Ale. I would definitely drink it again."
""
""

"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like molasses, vanilla, dark fruit, oak and chocolate. It tastes like oak/wood, dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and some molasses. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. The bourbon character seems stronger in the aroma as compared to the taste. I liked this brew, but I wish there was a little more of a bourbon kick. Still, for $7.99 a bottle it's certainly worth trying."

"I had this with a peanut butter sandwich as a late night snack - the two flavors paired well."
""
""
""
"A very good and flavorful ale, worth trying, masks the strength pretty well but it's a sipper, good body and complex flavor. Worth having."
""
"O: a really compelling dark beer - dry and bitter, but with a bit of bittersweet chocolate sweetness to fall back on; great work done with the malts."

"Overall for the price and ease of drinking, I plan to come back to this one and will try the other John Henry offerings. Nice job on this one. After having another I had to come back and rate it higher on taste. It does not have to be complex to very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"A very good beer and I think a great price at $2.50 a bottle. Would love to try it again."
"Taste starts chocolatey sweet with a touch of fusel upfront, creamy in the middle, with a lightly boozy close and a lingering aftertaste, . Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is alright. Doesn't quite all come together as well as I would hope, but not too bad."

"Great beer from start to finish. Fully body beer especially for being a 9.1% alc/vol. easy drink ability an great to have with steaks or other food parings depending on your food preference. love the idea of aging on bourbon oak chips. Plus it being Minnesota brew scores more points in my book. Love all three varieties that Cold Spring Brewing offers!"

"The mouthfeel is close to full, but a little thinner than I expected. Carbonation is slightly flat, but not too bad. Slight bite from the alcohol and a little bit of an earthy finish at the end, sort of acidic. Fairly drinkable, more of a sipper. Overall worth trying."
"overall, a great brew with a great abv. nice, typical roasted malts, easy to bring down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Classic good, not great…tons of roasted malts and bourbon flavor going on here and playing well, but there’s something missing that would take this ale to another level…for the higher ABV, it’s very drinkable and light…if it were a little chewier, more of a “sipper” style brew, I think it would be rated much higher…as it is, it’s alright, but nothing that stands out…(3.5/5)"
""
"Final Thoughts: For what it is and the price point ($8.99 for a four pack) it's not a bad deal. It would work well as an introductory beer for someone just getting into oak aged ales. However, it doesn't pack the bourbon punch that was expected and lacks in body. Would I drink it again? Let's put it this way, I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice ASA that does well with the addition of bourbon oak chips. Some slight off flavors, but still a good beer overall."
""
"O: I had no real expectations when I cracked this but was pleasantly surprised and am really glad I gave this beer a try. I would buy this again and would definitely recommend it to those who like roasted malt bombs."
""
""
"A pretty drinkable strong ale, drinks like a nice imperial vanilla porter to me, has more chocolate and vanilla qualities than it does bourbon, but the oak does come through a touch."
""
""
"Dark, Rich, Smooth, Amazing balance of oak, smoke and bourbon all come together in a fantastic beer!"
""
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a tan head. In the aroma, oaky and a small bourbon like presence. In the taste, oaky, notes of bourbon, a touch watery but decent. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oak and small bourbon presence in the aftertaste. A bit thin and a touch watery, with a decent flavor. Not to shabby."
""
"Medium mouthfeel, and understated carbonation.Bottle from Flanders Ned."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I quite like this beer. I'm rating it a lot higher than other reviewers, but despite its provenance (Cold Spring isn't necessarily a strong-ale powerhouse), this beer has a lot of good flavor and a smooth drinkability. Good on ya, Cold Spring!"
""
"However, with that said, could this beer be improved?... Yes. Do I recommend it?... Yes."
"Smells quite boozey with bourbon, but it's not really a sort of well-balanced bourbon aroma. It's more chocolate-vanilla smell than wood smell and unusually sweet and ripe in tone, reminding me more of a rail bourbon than a name brand. The flavor is similar to the nose, but at a relatively muted level and somewhat drier compared to the nose. And the malts are somewhat lost in the shuffle at times underneath the bourbon. It's an average sort of beginner's introduction to bourbon beers, but overall it gives off the impression of being raw, unbalanced, and I'm not quite sure that cellaring would fix it given the odd disparity of sweetness between the nose and the flavor."
""

"This beer pours a very dark brown with a 1 finger tan head and thin lacing. The aroma is of dark fruit, dark roast, and a hint of smoke. The flavor is plums, roasted malt, and wood notes with a heap of coffee in the finish. There's a mild alcohol burn as it warms. It's mouthfeel is full and a bit syrupy. Cold Spring John Henry 3 Lick Spiker Ale is a decent beer, recommended."
"O: A solid beer, overall. Not terribly complex, but enjoyable enough."
""
"Didn't have high expectations for this one, but I actually enjoyed it. Nice flavor, though the alcohol won't hurt to be toned down just a bit."
""
""
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruit, cocoa, wood, and bourbon. Taste is much the same with distinct roasty and soy sauce flavors as well. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a good aroma but the flavor just doesn't match up."
""
""
"Despite nice dark appearance, thick head and reasonably good body, this beer was disappointing. It's not very well balanced IMHO...not enough hop flavor and an overabundance of maltiness, though it does have a nice finish. It seems like there is something missing, and I wonder if I simply got a bad batch. Seems unlikely, but I suppose it's possible."
"Where is the base beer? I kind of feel like I could put bourbon oak chips in water to come up with the same thing. I enjoyed the sweet flavors at first but it left me wanting more. "
""
"Overall: I expect more from anything that is bourbon aged, especially if I'm only getting four bottles of it. This is an average beer that I'd consider a gateway into the intensity of anything oak aged, but it's not worth the price tag that comes with it. I'd gladly pass this up for New Holland's Dragon's Milk or Arcadia's Shipwreck Porter."
""
"don't judge a beer by it's appearance.. lesson learned! this is a fantastic beer regardless of style. it's pretty much a liquid dessert, and you cannot go wrong. pick this up, open it up, and enjoy."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours almost pitch black color with a nice 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some good spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, molasses, toffee, vanilla, toast, bourbon, oak, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Nice and enjoyable aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of big caramel, molasses, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, biscuit, oak, earth, herbal, and light bourbon. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, earth, oak, and light bourbon on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; the bourbon and oak flavors compliment this very nicely without being overpowering. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very nice creamy, thick, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to sip on. Overall this is a damn nice bourbon oak aged ale. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to sip on for being over 9%. Very enjoyable stuff."
""
""
"Very decent, I would have no problem at all with an entire 4 Pak."
"Some toffee, vanilla and caramel, not enough two row in this though. Comparing this to something aged well in a bourbon barrel is not fair."
"Well,despite and aggro pour, I still only managed less than a finger of deep-tan head that quickly became wisps. Nose was boozy, bourbon?, if they say so. Color was a deep, dark-brown with cola highlights at the edges. Mouthfeel was dense and hot, like pudding with an extra sumpin' sumpin'. Whew! The taste was chocolate, bourbon and toffee. Rather sweet for my taste, but still not bad. The finish was where the bourbon chips really asserted themselves and combined with the inherent heat of the beer, I felt like I had been drinking spirits. I am a beer drinker for a reason - I can usually realize my limit and ramp back or stop but liquor for me is like standing on the edge of the abyss and looking down. When I drink liquor, I break out in handcuffs. This was a novelty and a once-and-done for me."
"Overall: this beer was decent but the flavor profile seemed a bit disjointed to me. Worthy of a try."
""
""
""

"The beer pours dark black with an inch of dense tan head that holds on tightly. The nose is faint alcohol (that gets hotter as it warms), coffee, oak, aluminum (also much more pronounced when warm), and caramel wood sugar. The taste brings forward more of the yeast's fruitiness, which i expected to find in nose. There is some subtle roastiness in the beer's finish that dries out the beer's semi-sweet, medium body.The bourbon/wood doesn't carry through to the beer's taste as I would have preferred, but it's very smooth and drinkable nonetheless. Although this beer is labeled as a strong ale I would have compared it to a strong porter or stout instead. The lacking yeast character/full-bodied sweetness brings this beer down to being slightly better than average, despite its drinkability."
"Light but creamy feel, some overt oak and vanilla notes lead off. Chocolate and nougat in the middle. Lingering oak and chocolate notes in the dry aftertaste. Body is a little thin, and the oak is the main flavor, though its a good effort. Would drink again, though they don't seem to be pushing this one... its a resounding homerun against their regular lineup of quasi-craft mediocrity."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Healthy fine light tan head with good retention and lacing. Very nice aroma of dark sweet malt, oak, dark fruit with a hint of bourbon. Flavor is not as intense as the aroma, but combines the dark fruit, caramel malt, bourbon and oak. Flavor fades rather quickly, but leaves a pleasant oaky sweet malt aftertaste. A slight astringency to the finish that was not great, but was moderated by the other flavors. Medium bodied not quite reaching creaminess. With more intensity of flavor could compete with the top tier oak aged strong ales. Reaches for the ring, but misses. On the other hand, the flavor is light but complex and well integrated. I enjoyed this strong ale and will buy it again."

"In general, this is a pretty good beer and considering Cold Spring made one of the worst beers I have ever tried, I can say at this point that I can forgive them for making Hackstein Light."
"Overall - Lots of things going for it in the aroma, but the taste falls flat. Tough to drink. Not something I'd drink again."
""
""
""
"Very dark brown with a black appearance. Short khaki colored head with weak retention. Bold, pungent aroma full of heavy molasses, espresso roast, cream, oak and bittersweet chocolate. First sip is an interesting, robust combination between oaked mahogany, rich coffee and thick molasses. flows into a big bodied, boozy, mildly nutty overall flavor. Hints of orange and maple make their way through eventually to a boozy, woody finish."
""
""
"Overall A decent sipper. My first experience trying a Cold Spring brew."
"DOA"

"John Henry is a 9.1% So it has a substantial alchohol flavor that pairs with dessert. That is how I will use this case. I feel like this beer would be outstanding at a pub on tap. The case was clearly marked ""ale aged ON bourbon oak chips' so ""my bad"" it was a bit of a disappointment"
"Very heavy oak flavor. Mutes most everything else. Not a thriller."
""
"Bottom line: worth a try"
"Overall: Not a bad beer but not something I would buy again."
""
"The best part of this beer is the ABV; it is very smooth considering higher alcohol levels. This style confounds me ""bourbon oak chips""; the bourbon barrel branding is deceptive considering the minimal and weak presence of bourbon in the taste and smell. I'd rather have a truly barrel-aged beer that exudes bourbon character in a much better fashion."
""
"Overall this is just OK. No real reason to buy again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of bourbon, somewhat sweet. Taste is also bourbon up front, considerable malty sweetness, a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall was a unique and enjoyable beer and worth giving a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good beer. Maybe not quite to style, but it's quite tasty."
""
"O- I was suprised by this beer. Its very well crafted and a lot better then most other bourbon barrel attempts."
"This beer poured out as a dark shade of gold almost a brown color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer was malty, rich and roasted, not much of a hoppiness there. The taste of the beer was decent, as it warmed up there were some really interesting vanilla flavors that came through. The mouthfeel of the beer was average to me, it had a good body but I just felt it was missing something. Overall I was a little bit surprised by this beer, I was glad I tried it."
"Overall not too bad. Im not sure Ill buy it again anytime soon but its worth the try."
"It’s enjoyable enough, if priced right. I paid $11 a 4/pack, which is fair."
"M: Not the easiest beer to drink but the character of this one is good enough for enjoying it."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O - Good beer but not great. Could really benefit from the full treatment of barrel-aging, instead of just aging it with oak chips. I support MN microbrewing best I can, but I usually have to look to a company outside the state to find something I can really enjoy."
""
""
"Final thought - 9.1 abv is nice but the price at $11 a sixer is not my fav"
"This is a pretty good beer but could really be improved if it was a little more balanced. I feel the body was the most lacking part of this beer. I don't know if that is fixable without negatively changing the flavor. Overall worth a try, another good American Strong Ale from California."

"My wife picked this one out and I have to say she did well. It is a well put together and tasty brew. if I remember correctly it was also fairly affordable. I would definitely consider picking up a bottle or this in the future."
"O- A interesting, balanced beer. It certainly has its place among some of the more extreme strong ales, but no risks are taken. Enjoyable none the less."
"O- very good beer. Nicely drinkable and delic"
"Nice beer, good roast flavor- will probably get better aged."
"Weird little bottle found on the shelf at Julio's today. Looks like a macro in micro clothing to me, but I'm a sucker for oak aged so the bottle made its way home with me. Pours a solid dark brown/black with a thinnish tan head that dissipates almost instantly. Smells of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, earthy and woody. This is listed as a strong ale, the website describes this as an Imperial Stout, it smells like a cross between a Belgian dark strong and a porter. There isn't much roast in the aroma or in the taste for that matter. Taste is sweet and malty with dark sugars and fruits dominating the taste. Slight alcohol and earthy hop in there as well. Bit of a roasted grain ash in the finish. Medium body and level of carbonation, with a slick watery mouthfeel. Decent brew, but really nothing special here. I have my doubts that the Cold Spring Brewery actually exists, but I won't lose much sleep over it."
"Black malt and toasty flavors. Raisiny and roasted, like a dark Belgian. A pleasant boozy smell with a nice whack of vanilla and whiskey. Rich mouthfeel but not viscous. Slightly sweet but has a fruity tartness and maybe a little sour from the burnt barley. A bit of a winey character. Not tasting overly strong of alcohol, the chocolate malt and woody flavors seem to make it play well. An interesting turn on the black beers, kind of a free spirit. You could call it an Old Ale, as it has that hint of rusty flavor, but somehow different from the big stouts."
"Overall, I would seek this out again if I had nothing else close in the sto that compares. It does not leave a lasting impression, but not bad."
"o- a very good beer, i will be getting this one again"
"Overall: A tasty brew with lots of character, surprisingly drinkable, and a must-try from Cold Spring Brewing Co."
"Solid medium body, more carbonation than in the appearance. Pretty warming. Actually reminded me quite a bit of New Holland Dragons Milk."
"Overall: A good beer in a category which has the potential to be completely terrible. Go Cold Spring!"
"O- could only drink one of these both for ABV and thickness and robust taste its a tongue and palate coater but a tasty one"
"Overall: I was totally and completely blown away by this beer. Insanely complex and great flavor profile and is incredibly easy to drink for it being 9.1 abv. Well done and highly recommended"
"I finally got to try this beer as Casanova's had a single. You can definitely taste the contributions of the bourbon oak chips in this beer, but the base beer doesn't add too much. A pretty good beer, definitely the best Cold Spring offering I've had."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good American Strong Ale. Most beers with the word bourbon in their name have a pretty dominating bourbon aspect to them, this one didn't and I thought that worked well with this brew. The lightness of the bourbon must be because it was aged on bourbon oak chips instead of being aged in the barrel, it seems like by using the chips you have more control on how bourbony the beer will be instead of just throwing it in the barrel and praying for the best. The nicely blended bourbon aspect of this beer would make this a great beer to introduce people to bourbon beers, it gives you a taste of the bourbon but it doesn't hit you over the head with bourbon and that can be too much for people who aren't used to it. What I liked most about this beer was it's balance and how nicely blended the flavors were, what I liked least about this beer was it's lack of carbonation, it was pretty close to being flat. I would buy this beer again, it has a good price point compared to the other bourbon beesr and it would make a good go to bourbon beer. If bourbon beers are your thing, give it a try, its nice to have something other then a stout that has the bourbon treatment, and if your are wanting to get into bourbon beers this is a pretty good place to start. This was a good first impression for Cold Spring Brewing Company, before this beer this brewery wasn't even on my radar but now that I have tried it I will be on the look out for other beers from them, good job guys thanks for making a nice Strong Ale with bourbon flavors and not a bourbon bomb."
"First sip is a bit mellower than what I was expecting. Usually when breweries are so bold as to market a beer as aged in bourbon barrels, it comes off as something a bit more intense, like a Bourbon County of a Kentucky Breakfast. Maybe the fine details are in the statement ""aged ON Bourbon Oak Chips"" and not specifically ""bourbon barrels"". Either way, the beer is still very nuanced and has a great body to it. In fact, I might recommend it over some of the other beers, as this may be much more palatable than the rest to someone who's never tried such a style before."
"Overall: A better than expected oaked strong ale."
"Well quite the name this one has. It wa spoured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass at cellar temp. A dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose has big malts, oak and whiskey. Also some vanilla, coconut, candy and booze. Taste is thin and lacks complexity. As is the body."
"Overall: This is pretty average for anything even trying to do anything barrel aged. It lacks the complexity of many bourbon barrel aged beers"
"D/O- Pleasantly surprised by this one, didn't really know what to expect when I picked up a single. Had always saw ads for it in beer magazines and it looked interesting enough. Would drink again."
"I liked this. This is easily the best beer I've had from these guys by far. Would hapily buy this again if it makes it down this way. God knows enough of their cheap crap doea..."
"A deep dark cloudy molasses color with a thin creamy khaki head that gives way to thick curtains. The nose is sweet and buttery with movie theatre popcorn, goobers, toffee, along with sweet buttery vanilla oak. The tasty is syrupy sweet with black strap molasses, vanilla, a hint of corn and sweet bourbony caramel along with a weird metallic note at the end. Not that good of a beer."
"Deep dark pour that resembles molasses. A finger and a half of mocha head. A little lacing remains. Really nothing moving or impressive in my glass. Big bourbon booze with fig and plum on the nose. Like a fig newton gone rogue. Carbonation isn't bad. You want it to feel creamy but it quickly says no soup for you. In the taste the bourbon is forefront. Then it's quickly followed by a wood like medicinal booziness. Crushed aspirin in my beer. Oh joy. This really smelled like it had a possibility. Maybe I'm incredibly fussy. Flat out this beer sucked."
"Overall and interesting beer. I really don't see many american dark strong ales around but compared to the few I've had this is very good. Similar to a bourbon barrel aged stout with less of the smokey hoppy harshness that some stronger stouts have. A very smooth easy drinking beer for a dark ale that is around 9% abv."
" I'm glad i finally tried this beer but probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"O-Fine for what it is, but not terribly interesting. It's very easy to drink and masks the alcohol well. Overall this is a well made beer that I would not hesitate to try again."
"Pours a one finger brown head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Brown/black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Nose is bourbon, flavor is a mellow oak bourbon. Higher ABV is hidden. $2.65 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Drinkability - I usually hate the idea of a woody, oaky, vanilla-laden ASO with this and the oak-aged AB being the exception. This is a quality ale, done right by no accident, that stands apart from the pack."
"d - I got to try about 3 oz's of this a few months ago and remembered liiking it, so I was really glad to get a bottle of this to review. I remembered it having a great smell, which it lived up to. Lots of cream and vanilla mixing with chocolate and caramel malts, with nice bourbon and oak added to it. Unfortunately the taste seemed a little flat and faded, though it was still decent. A nice beer I would like to try fresh sometime."
"I dunno, I mean John Henry 3 Lick Spiker Ale is a pretty good beer overall, rather stout-like, I'd say, but there is next to no Bourbon character, to me it tastes more like a lightly-hopped RIS than anything. Good, but not as advertised, is my final assessment. In the beer's defense, there is next to no booziness making it pretty dang drinkable."
"D - The alcohol is hidden well in this. It's got some good aspects going on but seems to be lacking something. Decent drinkability though."
"NOTE: Bottle code -- JCBJ 0915"
"D- Overall a very average beer. Not sure if this is best fresh or aged. Not sure what my bottle is on that scale, but nothing makes me want to buy it again"
"Notes: Not too shaby at all a good one to pick up and I shall pick up again. Cheers."
"Tried this in my pre-reviewing days and enjoyed it, so I figured I'd give it another go and get a tick while I'm at it. It pours a seemingly opaque black-brown topped by a finger of ecru foam, which settles out into a ring momentarily. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, butter, and plenty o' booze. If it weren't for the last blast of alcohol, it wouldn't be so bad, but instead it burns us a bit too much. The taste holds notes of bourbon, wood, chocolate, and roasted malts, but these are singed away by that pesky alcohol. Boo. Some cedar lingers in the aftertaste. The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, way too boozy and uneven to work properly. It could have turned out okay, but, alas..."
"By far, this is gotta be the best offering from Cold Spring Brewery."
"THANK YOU 'BREWSEUM'!!!"
"D: The nose and mouthfeel are nice, but the flavor falls way short. Even after letting this one warm up a fair amount, it was still pretty plain and woody."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a thin, tan-colored head the quickly disperses towards the shoulders, forming a thin band. No lacing on this one. Pleasant nose - faint bourbon notes and a slight buttery quality on a malty backbone. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of toffee and vanilla. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an even, easy carbonation. This is a really flavorful and drinkable bourbon imparted beer. Not at all boozy, but imparted with some exceptional flavor without being cloying. Well worth a try if you get the opportunity. I bet this would be fantastic on cask."
"Loved it and I will be buying more."
"Really an interesting beer that rides a fine line between Ale, porter, stout, imperial something, oak aged, bourbon and whatnot. It's never over the top anywhere, but very nicely balanced. Really a very good beer."
"Some distinct and flattering flavors; however, the imbalance both in flavor and texture make it tough to have more than one."
"Overall, different and cheap, so try it."
"This beer might work okay as a vanilla float as the bitterness is low enough and the already apparent vanilla flavor may blend adequately. While this isn't terrible, it is rather hard to get through the whole bottle, even if I'm adequately distracted. That's not a good sign."
"D - Hard time having more than one."
"Relatively tasteless on the initial sip. That gives way to a strong molasses, toasted malt flavor with a powerful alcohol content. Very thin body for the style with an equally low carbonation."
"Would not want to drink more than one of these at a time, maybe as a dessert beer."
"Has some drinkability for the ABV, thats about it."
"D - Not real drinkable. Pretty mammoth and intimidating and intense. Probably wouldn't get this again, but a pretty good beer overall."
"D - Very good, but not sure I'd buy this again."
"Overall- Not bad. Fairly complex actually, but just didnt do much for me. I wouldn't spend my money on this, but for free I'm glad I got to try it."
"Overall, this is an okay beer and I can enjoy it but would not want a whole lot at any given sitting. Some alcohol presence, but not too much."
"drinks rather well for a beer that skirts any style guidelines. Decently complex, but not terrific. I would definitely try this again, as it was a complete impulse buy... if you put the words bourbon and aged on a beer label, price it under $10, and I will try it. This didn't let me down, though it didn't quite wow me either."
"F: THe booze starts to show a little towards the end. It gets a slight boozy taste as well as some alcohol warmth and tingle. It's still sweet on the finish, with a little more barley, more syrups, brown sugar, etc. Also the bourbon sticks around through the finish and lingers on the tongue. More molasses as well on the finish. No real oak here though."
"DB- The oak flavor here is the best thing about this beer. The whiskey is somewhat subdued but works in this case. I think this beer is fairly underrated. I would have to say it is the most drinkable bourbon influenced ale I can think of, nice job. I could session this thing, great price too. It is a shame its looks were so weak."
"Overall: Not a horrible brew by any means--just not my shtick. I can definitely see how other people can enjoy this. If you prefer your beers on the sweeter side and/or are an oak junky, 3 Lick Spiker is worth a try."
"M & D: amazing, incredibly mild for a 9.1 ABV beer"
"Aack. Whoa, totally unexpected! With an aggresive pour got a smallish tan head that quickly subsides. Color is an opaque very dark brown. Aroma is vanilla, chocolate malt. Flavor is massively cherry. And then a few other components - vanilla and.... man, I just cant get away from the cherry. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor. Could cook with it. Or give it to someone who likes dark cherry beer. But it's definitely not for moi."
"The mouthfeel is solid, malty and thick this bad boy lets you know he's in there kickin some taste bud ass. Overall I think this is a quality brew, rivals the oaked arrogant bastard to be honest and the price was better too, I will definitely be buying some of this again."
"The taste is just like the aroma, oak, vanilla, booze, and caramel. Not very strong with flavor, but decent for what it is. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Nothing to get to excited about. Decent drinkability."
"The body was a bit too thin for a beer this strong and flavorful. Drinkability was pretty good for a beer this size, although the bourbon can be a bit powerful and could affect how you view drinkability. Overall, a pretty good brew, worth trying if you see it."
"D-a little strong for a session, but easy to drink the bottle"
"Drinkability is just ok since its strong in alc. and flavor per sip.This might be offputting to some, but I could put back 3 of these easy. Personally I give it a 4 cuz its so darn tasty"
"D - Decent, the alcohol is noticeable, but to me the real culprit is what the heck is this beer trying to be? It has the alcohol of a barleywine or a strong ale, has a very crisp carbonation, but the body is a bit light for a stout or porter. Despite its identity crisis, I still enjoy it. I may grab another bottle to age."
"Also, when it sits in the glass for 45 minutes, the last few ounces go down better than the first, so this is probably better served in the 45-55 degree range as an after dinner ale."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black in the glass. Nice light brown head forms immediately, and sticks around for a while. Aromas of milk chocolate, bourbon, oak and vanilla. On the palate, I get muddled versions of the above mentioned flavors, mostly milk chocolate and vanilla. Drinkable, but not all that impressive."
"Alcohol is well-integrated. Oak chips come across strongly. Sweet, turns dry quickly. Little to no aftertaste, an enjoyable enough brew - not quite as rich or bourbony (more woody) than expected. The sweetness fades to a dry finish. Wish that taste lingered on more (and was fuller), Still-in-all a respectable strong dark ale with woody/bourbon-ish notes."
"Excellent beer from this brewery, which hitherto hadn't made any sort of substantial impact on me. I'm a little more interested now..."
"Overall it is a good effort for the brewery but nothing too special go with Oaked AB."
"Picked this one up in Cold Springs for reasonable price,pours deep brown with a solid head,Nice winter warmer has done well with a little age,robust oaken ale taste,solid alcohol finish,a great deal at this price,I have had many a beer that are more expensive and in now way as complex in taste,solid job by cold spring."
"traveled to Cold Spring Brewing Company Mn, awesome tour,free, had the John Henry on tap! wow!! tour was with the brewmaster took us through the whole plant, amazing facility! if you ever get the chance its a must on your list to do in central minnesota. John Henry Imperial Stout Bourbon Oak Aged black in color, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, and bourbon the flavor hits you but very smooth, at 9.1% ABV, you can hardly tell, until its time to leave which was hard to do. John Henry Imperial Stout on tap, did i mention free!!!"
"Overall - very interesting. Not really something you could box into a particular style. I would say it is an Imperial Porter aged on bourbon. Nice attempt but could be refined a bit more."
"Overall I have to say it was outstanding. I was not expecting much but was more then happily suprised with the results. An outstanding barrel aged beer."
"This beer has a lot of what I like. Wood cask flavors, dark malt, high alcohol and a lot of hops."
"Very rich sweet malty strong ale with aromatic bourbon characters and a touch of dark fruity esters. Nice to sip in front of a fire place during cold seasons."
"I put away a bottle of this brew in 3-11 and opened it this evening. Cooled down to just above 40 the ale had taken well to the aging. At over 1.5 years old this ale is smooth, flavorful, and easy to take. Better now after aging than when first purchased. This is not my favorite even among those Cold Spring makes, but darn good anyway!"
"D: This is pretty drinkable considering its ABV. I would've liked a little more presence from the bourbon, but the subtle hints of vanilla went nicely with the malts. I would drink this again but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"D - Definitely taking my time with this one and not having another."
"Really nice beer. I would call this more of a scotch ale than a strong ale, but still has to be the best thing to come out of Cold Spring in a long time or maybe even ever. Very drinkable. I would drink this again."
"D: Don't think I would want more than one of these in a sitting. Though I will say that the 9.2% alcohol is well hidden"
"I am totally taken aback by this beer. I was told from a reliable source that despite my prior misconceptions, this was in fact a good tasting beer. I didn't believe it, but figured for the price tag it was worth it. I'm very glad I gave it a shot. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if this was in my fridge a lot this fall."
"Not a bad beer at all considering the $6.99/sixer sale pricetag."
"D-The best Cold Sping/Gluek beer ever made and well worth trying...just not up there with the top in the class. Still, this is an enjoyable beer to drink..a few tweaks and this could be really good."
"D: Because of the strength, flavor and mouth feel, I could see getting pretty messed up on this."
"Pours a stout like black color with a small tan head that settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Not that impressive looking but considering its high ABV, it is good. Has a rich malt aroma of mocha and roasted grains. Hints of vanilla and bourbon from the oak chips. You can definately sense the 9.1 % ABV before you even taste this ale. The bourbon charactor dominates the flavor. There are hints of vanilla, espresso, and chocolate. Great flavor up front but it all disappears even before the ale leaves my mouth. Very dry and slightly boozy. Medium body with a chewy texture. Nice carbonation that compliments the flavor. I applaud Cold Spring for brewing this beer. Please bring us some more beer of this caliber."
"Pitch black body. Amber hues show through when held to the light. Little brown head that disappears quickly. Serious chocolate malt scent. Dark fruit tones. Spicy alcohol. Major malt taste. Caramel and chocolate. Dark fruit, licorice. Some bitter hops. Somewhat thinner mouth for a beer of this size than i expected. Very tasty"
"Overall, I am very fairly with this beer. They need to make more beers like this and less beers like their normal offerings. Boozey but good for Cold Spring."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0906-Dan"
"D-The oakiness seems a bit out-of-balance, overwhelming at times to the point of detracting from the beer flavors. This seems to be an otherwise well-developed beer, and a breath of fresh air compared to some of Cold Spring's less-craft-oriented brews."
"Very attractive and drinkable. Worth seeking out if you're a stout fan or just a fan of beers that taste good!"
"Picked up a single at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove, MN. Poured a dark brown body with a short tan head. Based off of reviews I've read, this is probably the best thing coming out of Cold Springs. It's just a mellow bourbon ale that relies almost entirely on the bourbon and wood aging for it's character. There's a hint of dark malt in the background, but that's about it. It drinks without a hint of alcohol and is thin enough for me to suspect adjunct sugar was used. However, if you're looking for an affordable beer with bourbon character, this is it."
"Surprised to find a beer like this in this serving size, usually an expensive bomber with this style but this came in a ten or eleven dollar six pack, would drink again, too bad I did not bring more back, recommended"
"Overall, I feel this is a great beer, but one that I would buy on sporadic occasions. I am pleased to have tried it, and can't say any other beer I've tried is comparable."
"The carbonation makes the brew a bit fluffy giving the otherwise thinnish body some girth. The finish is a little spikey on the tongue...hops perhaps? Overall it's ok drinking, but I doubt I'll buy this one again"
"This was a new offering that I scored at Hi-Times in Costa Mesa. The color is black coffee brown from the bottle with dark red-brown highlights around the edges. It is dark, nearly opaque brown in the glass with a dark, almost purple red color when held in front of a light. The head is chocolatey tan and foamy and lasts well. The smell is bready and brown sugary. The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy--very nice! The taste is also brown sugar or molasses up front (though this makes it sound very sweet, it's not--how do you describe the non-sweet aspects of brown sugar and molasses? caramel?). This is a very interesting flavor. It's pretty complex. It's categorized as an American Strong Ale. It has similarities to Brown Ales. It isn't nearly as bitter as the other Strong Ales I've had. The beer is aged on bourbon oak chips. The oak is present though understated (which is fine by me). The bourbon is clearly noticeable. I would guess that the wood contributes to the soft mouthfeel. This is quite a nice beer."
