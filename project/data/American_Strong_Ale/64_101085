4.41,15.1,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Dogfish head brewed American Beauty with almond honey granola and all American hops and it sounds outrageous. It has a fruity, granola, almond honey nose. Pours orange tinted amber under a 2” quickly dissipating lightly tan tinted white foam cap with clingy lace. On the palate it enters nutty and slightly sweet with honey and light sugars balanced by a moderate hop bitterness on the finish. The finish has an underlying layer of honey and leaves a little honey stickiness on the lips. The beer is very creamy with above average carbonation stuffed into a medium full bodied beer. The granola is definitely there throughout but it is never too much to be cloying and is nicely balanced by the other flavors in the beer. It pairs well the the background pale ale graham cracker flavors and is well balanced by both the hop flavors and bitterness. The alcohol is unnoticeable.","pat61","Mar 06, 2015"

The hops aren't on par with Arrogant Bastard, they're a softer citrus punch. The malts are toasty with a granola-like sweetness (or maybe I'm imagining that because it's on the label). Very smooth and balanced for the strength, it feels at home in a red wine glass. It's a good trip.","tempest","Feb 17, 2015"

You can pick up some of the honey in the flavor, which mingles nicely with the earthy hops. The alcohol is well hidden. The body of this brew is medium and really smooth. Easy drinking, even at 9% ABV. Glad to recommend this brew. Cheers!","RoamingGnome","Jan 28, 2015"

Give the finish some time to settle on the tongue and you'll swear you just ate a Clif Bar. Judged solely as a beer, I can see how some would want a stronger hops profile in order to better clean the sugars, but doing so would turn this into an IIPA, and would drown the taste the recipe has successfully achieved. Because of that, I recommend tasting this alone rather than attempting to pair it with food.","BuckeyeSlim","Mar 06, 2014"

Pours deep orange colored with a big creamy 2-inch off white head. Lots of lemon peel in the aroma, grass and hat, orange, and some sweet malts. Flavor is super sweet orange-lemon pinesol. Flavor is a bit watered down with some sweet orange blossom honey and orange marmalade flavor in the background. Just under medium mouthfeel, low to medium carbonation, slightly slick on the tongue. This one is a bit funky for me, and don't really get any granola flavor so not sure what that added here. Not a big fan overall, really had a soapy floor cleaner characteristic to it.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2014"

But I will have to say that it is very good I have been enjoying IPA's lately and I have to say that of the Dogfish Head beers I have tried over the years I do think they make a damn good IPA style wise over some of the other offerings. Although this could also be me. Anyway, I thought the color was good and nothing surprising about that, typical of the style. It did have some head that settled into a nice lacing after a few minutes. The smell was fruity, with that hoppy pine smell I love. But there was a sweetness to it as well. That is where the granola enters I would assume. It does have that cereal grain impact to it that kind of mellows out the hoppy bitterness in the taste. The taste was not unlike the smell, I detected grapefruit, graininess, with some evergreeen presence. It had a sweetness to it that cuts through the hops and makes for a really balanced IPA. I would recommend this one and if I could find another one around I probably would pick it up again. I hope this is something Dogfish Head does more than once. My one complaint is that it was pricey to begin with and that seems to be an unfortunate trend overall in regard to good beers. I guess we will just have to get used to it.","humuloner22","Feb 04, 2014"

Aroma was slightly sweet malty, a bit of hoppy bitter, a tad of grainy bread as well. Flavor was a sweet up front, but had a hit of tangy hops as well. A bit of floral as well. Felt good in the mouth, coated nicely with bit of tingle. Overall, not a bad beer. Nothing really stood out from the granola profile, but it didn't hurt it either.","mountdew1","Jan 20, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, orange peel, grapefruit, floral, grass, toast, bread, light pine, honey, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright hop notes with moderate malt balance; and good strength.

Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, peach, floral, grass, pine, bread, honey, toast, light nuttiness, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop and malt flavors; with good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial pale ale style. All around nice complexity of citrus/tropical hops with a moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV.

Light gauziness to the coppery orange color, closer to a reddish brown than yellow, the bubbles are few but they are fat and move with some speed. The nose is diffuse and easygoing, a gregariously sloppy array of sweet grains, orange pulp, honey, hay, white pepper, good amount of apricot to peach fruit, finishes more soft and estery than hoppy, slight vinous quality. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and consistent filling cheek to cheek, not soft per se yet not biting nor unduly bitter. The honey to yogurt aspects lead alongside orange and grapefruit citrus, again the apricot, peach to yellow apple fruit plays a sizable role. Malty and the granola is evident with each sip, sweet grains give it an even consistency start to finish. More floral through the finish, some pine sap too, the sweeter side of hops. The carbonation is on the creamy side and helps it ooze over the tongue. There’s nothing you can say it nails 100% and, as before, it’s not a beer of pinpoint precision. But it is extremely satisfying and something to just kick back and enjoy.","farrago","Nov 20, 2013"

There is a thick, almost solid lacing left behind as you drink. Aromas of spicy and green hops, with pepper notes, honey sweetness, passion fruit and grapefruit, and resinous notes. Flavors are tangy forward, with a solid bitter undertone. Roasted toffee and nut, as well as some toasted oat character, with a light and tart citrus highlight, some resinous cedar notes, and hints of toffee and dark fruit. Smooth in mouth, with a subtle effervescence from the slow flow of carbonation. The aftertaste is a solid, balanced blend of bitter, sweet, and toasted grains. Slightly bitter and dry finish, with subtle lingering notes. Very solid, drinkable beer, and overall, a fitting tribute to a musical and cultural icon.","GarthDanielson","Nov 05, 2013"

Served in a Dogfish Head IPA glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head that stays around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like citrusy hops, honey, grainy malt, oats, and some light berries. I think the taste is mostly like the aroma, it tastes like citrusy and light floral hops, grainy malt, oats, honey, and a bit of berries/fruitiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good Imperial Pale Ale, and it's certainly worth trying. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Nov 01, 2013"

The Dead payed at the Meadowlands here in Jersey more than at any other location and even though I never saw them there or anywhere else, the write-up on the side of the bottle expressed the desire to bottle the essence of a Dead show. Like a Green Flash beer, there's enough of a "skunk" here to make me think that I'm in the midst of haze of 420 but with the chewy and grainy granola aspect thrown in, has me thinking that a "crunchie" gave this to me at a concert. No matter - I enjoyed this and hopheads, deadheads, or even heads of a household would be wise to seek out this earthy, seemingly organic beer. There's a lot to like here for those who enjoy a beer that helps one to turn on , tune in, and drop out.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 31, 2013"

Aroma of caramel malt, grassy hops, light citrus and hints of tropical fruit. Flavor begins with a burst of grassy, citrus hops and very nice blended fruit juice juice with apple, light tropical fruit and a hint of honey, finishes with sweet grain, lingering fruit juice and a nice grassy, slightly floral, bitterness. Medium bodied with a pleasant creaminess and active carbonation that gave this a very nice mouth feel. This is on the juicy, semisweet malt end of the IPA spectrum (at 9%, why isn't this an Imperial IPA?), the hops are assertive, but take a back seat to the very pleasant fruit forward maltiness. The granola apparently adds both flavor and creamy body to the beer that resembles oat pale ales. I don't know if I would have detected granola in a blind taste test, but knowing ahead of time, I can completely buy the oaty, grainy, fruit, light honey of granola as the flavor here. I really liked this a lot and had to pace myself because of the flavor and ABV. I will pick up another bottle if I see it. Hope this makes it into the Dogfish rotation.","LiquidAmber","Oct 24, 2013"

I have been anticipating this more than any other beer in my life, as it combines two of my most favorite things in the whole wide world, craft beer and the traveling circus of good times that is the grateful dead. I put the record on, and I opened the bottle to a clear brassy light copper colored brew, brimming with fast paced carbonation and over an inch of soapy off white head that leaves thick and tall lacing etched in the glass as it drinks. one smell and "I knew right away she was not like other girls", as there was a definitive granola aromatic. honey, oats, even almonds compliment the strong pale ale base beer, which is far more hoppy than I expected it to be. the taste is odd, almost like two different beers. a sweet nutty almost esb on the front of the tongue, and a bitter hoppy strong ale that could just as well be an arrogant bastard on the back of the palate. its a strange dichotomy, long and strange, just like the trip. the two never really join up, but its a cool effect nevertheless. way high carbonation, and a light body for how strong this is. I loved the complexity and the idea behind it more than anything else. don't know if I will ever get to have this again, but thanks to dogfish head for recognizing the importance of the best band that ever lived, and for anti-hierarchically figuring out a way to make it unique. one of the best labels in the beer world too. the sentiment might be better than the beer, but who cares. see ya at the next show!","StonedTrippin","Oct 16, 2013"
