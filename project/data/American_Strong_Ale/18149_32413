It's a steep price to pay for less than a pint's worth, but if you've got a reason to treat yourself, you could do a lot worse.","TheSixthRing","Oct 23, 2014"

What a great experience, dark almost black burgundy amber body with a light tan head filling my glass. Aroma is straight up bourbon vanilla/oak/charred wood you name it straight up bourbon barrel aging effects. Served at 50-55 degrees, this beer has sweet bourbon notes hidden fruit, plum/alcohol/raisin notes. But a dominant Kentucky bourbon barrel aged beer is perfect for Fat Tuesday, the alcohol isn't nearly as hot as the nose would entail. There's also hints of molasses and other burnt sugars along the way. The woody character on the palate carries each sip, to the bourbon drinker this beer would be a god send, and I do believe it deserves the hype I'm just not a huge bourbon drinker so this wouldn't be my desert Island beer. However, I appreciate the flavors so much that I'm impressed by the amount of bourbon I'm able to pick up, mouthfeel is oily intense and lingering between sips but complex enough and not just straight bourbon barrel aging. I had deliverance on tap and believe me I love it but they are apples and oranges both excellent in their own right I'm amazed at the mellow carbonation on the palate and the smoothness between sips, this definitely deserves the title Angel's Share.","WVbeergeek","Mar 04, 2014"

If you’re trying to take notes and rate it will be even longer. This is one of the deepest most complex beers we’ve had the pleasure of tackling. It’s actually funny because the aging has blended each component so well that it almost comes across as simple, as everything is so hard to dissect. The nose gives wonderfully authentic wood and bourbon warmth, cleanly complementing the darkness of the grain and fruit. The flavor delivers as you would expect, with just as much punch. The booze is certainly present, but nicely contributes to the final blend, with just the right amount of sting through the end. This is a fantastic beer, and a great introduction for us into the winding world of The Lost Abbey.","TheBrewo","May 03, 2013"

Smell is strong vanilla, oak, molasses, and lots of bourbon. Thick and viscous mouthfeel with essentially no carbonation. Flavor is big vanilla notes with sweet molasses and brown sugar, finishing with big whiskey notes. Some mellow burnt charcoal taste too that is new to me and relaxing like sittin’ by the fire.

Vanilla upfront with some dark dried fruits such as raisins and dates finished with a nice finish if the alcohol burn and vanilla and toffee!! This beer is suppose to be sipped an well worth the price. Mouthfeel-very smooth for a 12.5% brew!

The strangely light mouthfeel is also jarring, and when combined with the light carbonation gives the beer a watery mouthfeel, despite the intense flavors. Still, there’s much to enjoy in here—providing you like bourbon, raisins, bourbon, vanilla oak, and bourbon—and fans of extreme barrel aging should give this one a try.","jondeelee","Feb 24, 2013"

It’s like a big barleywine with some deeper roast and dark fruit notes. There’s more going on in there than I can quite describe, but the bourbon flavor seemed to overpower some of this complexity. It has raisins, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak and even mild coffee and chocolate. This version just didn’t come together for me as much as the Grand Cru. It’s not quite a mess, but the alcohol heat was a bit much and the bourbon flavor sort of threw things out of whack more than it blended the flavors into a harmony. For bourbon barrel barleywines, I’ll take FW Parabola, AS Grand Cru and even Marin’s -bal Old Dipsea. I would have preferred this beer aged in a neutral oak barrel or perhaps just less time in the bourbon. It’s still rather good - hard to dislike a beer with so many interesting layers to it. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky (and some bottles probably aren’t carbonated properly but my notes are from the keg version). Interesting beer and I may revisit this rating once I try a future version.","popery","Jan 27, 2013"

The malts a hidden as well as the hops also. There is a hint of molasses in there also. The mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied but not much carbonation at all. Overall it's a big flavorful beer, could use some help but the carbonation was minimal. Perhaps newer vintages have a bit more to offer.

There's tons of caramelized brown sugar to form the base, and it's augmented by vanilla and oak. Bourbon is a subtle addition to the picture. The flavor profile is a little bit more rough. There's still some lightly burnt sugar, vanilla, and wood, but the bourbon presence is more brassy and harsh. Here it's the center of attention, with everything else playing more of a supporting role. The body is full and rich, but the carbonation is barely there. I like a more restrained carbonation for a malt forward beer, but this is a bit low even for me, and leaves the beer feeling flat. Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share is a decent to good beer right now, but I think it could use a little bit of time to really hit its stride.","axeman9182","Jul 31, 2012"

Everything I got from the nose, but so balanced, except a pungent bourbon and vanilla flavor that grabs you by the short hairs and makes you crave the next sip.

4.46,4.2,3.5,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"2011 Vintage. Pours an extremely murky, dark brown color with a tiny bit of bubbles...no head whatsoever...dammit. Scent makes me completely forget about the lack in carbonation, with it's heavenly aroma. I quickly get smooth bourbon and oak aromas with sweet vanilla and candied dark fruits. Wow, this scent is just bursting with complexity and deliciousness. Taste is just as the aroma begins, except with a little more dark fruit. Lovely dark fruits with oak and vanilla. Some caramel as well. A bit of molasses with some amazing bourbon notes. Slight alcohol burn, but just the right amount. Mouthfeel is vinous... not much carbonation at all. Kinda works for this full-bodied, big, delicious beer. Drinkability is fairly high...as long as I sip slowly to not get too drunk. Overall, I always enjoy a carbonated beer more than a non-carbonated beer. This just happens to work for this beer,...somewhat. I would still like it more if it were carbonated, but supposedly that's not what Tomme is going for with his Angel's Share.","DovaliHops","Jan 19, 2012"

Then comes some bourbon and a light cherry flavor. The finish is warming and leaves a lingering oak presence. Surprisingly, the taste is not all that boozy. Medium-full body. Low carbonation. This is quite a tasty beer. It's sweet, but not cloying.

4.06,-5.1,3,4.5,4,4,4,"I had dinner on Saturday night at the Sunset Cantina on Comm Ave, and I saw this little gem on the ""just tapped"" list. Served for $9 in a Chimay chalice. Very dull brown color. No head at all, just a pool of carbonation in the middle of the head. Kinda lifeless looking. Then I took a sniff. Whoah, there's some bourbon there. Very powerful and upfront. The flavor doesn't relent either. It might actually be too strong. I could taste some hints of cherry and figs, but the booze flavor really dominated. While I liked it a lot, I would have preferred if it was toned down a bit. The bourbon barrel aging seems to be a blessing and a curse for this one. Perhaps aging a bottle would really be beneficial here. But glad I got to try it on tap, as I had never seen this one in MA before.","morebeergood","Oct 17, 2011"

No pop, no formation of carbonation at the top of the beer. Flat as a pancake. Poured without any head whatsoever. I hate to label, but ""Flat Abbey"" is appropriate. The nose is real boozy. Wreaks of bourbon. However, it has a ton of subtleties to it including chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The taste follows the nose nearly to a T, so I won't bother to repeat. The mouthfeel is void of any carbonation whatsoever. What's strange about this, is it has the mouthfeel of a stout...and exactly the way I like my stouts. If this WERE a stout, I'd likely grade this higher in the mouthfeel and appearance departments. I can see this needing age behind it...but why age a flat beer?

Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a deep murky brown with a basically non-existant off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, sweet alcohol, and dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was pretty tasty. This is one of those instances that you can tell that the beer had sat in bourbon barrels rather than just knowing that it was in a barrel. Really good flavor and aroma going on in this one. I was honestly afraid when I cracked the top on this one and didn't hear a pop from the cork. Was also concerned when there was basically no head formation.

This was the BIG WINNER of the night. It began with a pop and a thick caramel head slowly climbing out of the top of the bottle. Incredible rusty brew with yeasty bits floating throughout the glass. Oak, molasses, vanilla, and toffee all playfully fighting for attention. Flavor is extremely complex with various dark fruits, chocolate, and mild bourbon.

Otherwise, the base beer itself isn't boozy and it is accompanied by dark fruit and a balanced, small amount of sweetness. Some sips it really comes together and some sips it comes off with too much bourbon. Even when it comes together, it is nothing stellar. Relatively thin (for what it is) in the body with low, but present carbonation. Overall, I like it but don't love it.

Fearing a bad seal in the cork, I smelled the beer, but could not detect any heavy oxidation aromas, so the flatness seemed to be by design. The smell was very vinous, and reminded me of raisins soaked in whiskey. The taste was sweet and oaky, with lots of vanilla and raisins, and no hops. This was pretty much a red wine through and through, and was not at all like any other beer. The body was dense and still, and made for a nice sippping beverage.","rajendra82","Feb 15, 2011"

A touch of coffee bitterness as I swallow. A touch of powdered chocolate in the aftertaste. Bourbon flavors are present throughout. As legend tells us, this is a full bodied beer that is nearly flat.

3.84,-10.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured from a bottle we picked up at the Lost Abbey/Port brewery. We poured into a wide mouthed wine glass to allow the beer to breath a bit. The beer is an extremely caramel-brown color, with an appearance of thick, syrupy consistency. No head or other signs of carbonation. Definite aromas of oak/wood, as well as sweet malty/sugary smells. The beer has an initial sweet malt flavor, heavy in molasses and caramel notes, that remains robust but becomes crisp on the finish. The bourbon barrel aging definitely had a huge influence on this brew. Deep down, there are hints of some spice that dances in and out of your mouth. The overall sweet flavor makes this a very rich beer for me personally. I do enjoy the robust and strong flavors. The finish, as I said, is crisp, with slight sweet and sour highlights.","GarthDanielson","Jan 05, 2011"

No lacing present, the beer actually looks kind of dead with the exception of tiny bubbles around the edges of the glass indicating a trace of carbonation. The color is attractive despite the murky pond water appearance, there is a deep mahogony color with a tinge of tawny gold around the edges. Reminiscent of a nice tawny port. The aromas are enticing, lots of vanilla and bourbon, reminds me of an old ale. There are also chocolate undertones with splashes of dried fig and plum. The flavor accurately reflects the aroma with a burst of dark fruits and chocolate with lingering bourbon and white pepper on the finish. Well balanced and quite drinkable for a 12% beer, incredibly smooth and silky finish. If it was slightly more carbonated this would be a delight.

Apparently I got the wrong vintage of sorts though I won't be risking such things again as for carbonation issues. I generally find that Lost Abbey beers seek sweet complexity through large amounts of simple unfermentable ingredients and this is no exception. And many nuances are lost in this route.

The nose is rather bourbon-centric, with some oak, milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, pretzels, and a smidge of roasted malts piled in there as well. The taste similarly whiskey-forward, with an added kick; the rest of the smell's constitutive elements, minus the chocolate, return for a second season, but the bourbon seems to have an ego issue that would preclude further contract extensions. The body is fairly hefty, with a very light carbonation (I thought the '10s fixed this...?) and an almost chewy feel. Overall, I feel this brew just missed the landing zone, fracturing a leg on landing. It'll heal, but the memory will malinger for a while. I'm thinking about aging the other bottle, if only to see how things go if the bourbon settles a tad. Beyond that, the other flavors seemed kinda weak, and the almost-flat, murky liquid was not very appealing. This one just wasn't fully for me.","TMoney2591","Aug 21, 2010"

The aroma is sweet and hot with plenty of bourbon up front, as well as caramelized sugar, dark fruits, toffee, some chocolate, oak and vanilla. The flavor really showcases the bourbon and oak aging, and is quite enjoyable. It has a sweet, caramelized sugar malt character that blends well with the bourbon and alcoholic heat. Other flavors include dark fruit, cocoa, leather, vanilla and oak. Surprisingly, it has a fairly decent bitterness that keeps the malt from getting out of hand. Well played Tomme, well played indeed. The mouthfeel on this is quite decadent and smooth with a wonderful lingering finish.

4.37,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer, along with it's Brandy aged cousin have caught a lot of flack for carbonation issues on this site, so lets see how this year's version came out. The cork comes out with a light pop, better than none I suppose, and pours out a deep, dark brown, with just lacing as far as heading is concerned. My first thought is that while there may not be a whole lot of carbonation, at least there is some. Anyway, nose is amazing, with huge bourbon characters, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. Bourbon, caramel and molasses dominate the taste, with tiny hints of earth as well. Mouthfeel is thick and boozy, but curbed at the same time by the carbonation that is there. This is not really a bad thing in my opinion, as this beer acts more like a spirit than most others, and deserves to be sipped and savored. Drinking this beer is a wonderful experience, but I warn you to take it slow, as it has kicked my ass on more than one occasion when having it out at a bar. Final thoughts are that despite all the criticism of Lost Abbey for the carbonation thing on last years brandy and bourbon batches, this beer is literally unlike any other. Even with zero fizz, this beer is a wonder to drink. Would I like some more carbonation? Yes, for sure, but it is still one of the most interesting and complex beers on the general market right now IMO. Now all I need to do is try the Grand Cru version of this brew, and I am good to go.

Molasses, figs, caramelized candi sugar, plum, chocolate covered dark cherries and bourbon. Much more. Carbonation was low and the mouthfeel was pure velvet. Perfect.

Waited on it for about 5 minutes and no let up! Huge aroma- tons of sweet bourbon, some chocolate, oak. Very inviting smell. Taste was not far off from the smell, but I was surprised how well balanced it was. The first sip was a bit hot with the bourbon, but it mellows quickly and nicely. Molasses, oak, some vanilla, and a bit of booze all work well together. This is a true sipper, though.

This beer is, naturally, world class, absolutely delicious, aromatic, creamy and light, and only lacking in those areas where a beer of this abv% is almost certain to lack (lacing, head retention, pure drinkablity).

Rich toffee and dried fruits, dates and prunes, bready and sweet with a combination of caramel and bourbon. Mild oak and vanilla with a bit of molasses. Crap, there's a lot of carbonation, too much.

Tasty buttered rum and toffee tones meet with lots of sweet dark fruit on the palate. Alchol tones are very well hidden except for the ways the flavors properly bring them out.

Taste follows with some sweet caramel malts up front, strong vanilla notes, raisins, oakiness, and a nice bourbon presence along with a good dose of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is a medium to heavy, sugary body that is cut well by a good sized woody bitterness and warmth of alcohol, as well as an active and somewhat peppery and crisp carbonation.

Extremely well integrated flavors with great Bourbon and oak up front followed by cream, vanilla, and fruit flavors. Very nice level of carbonation, not too aggressive at all. The mouthfeel is ultra rich and creamy, but with the alcohol well hidden. An absolutely amazing sipper. I really like bourbon influenced oak aged beers if they are done well.

4.78,11.7,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Did not enjoy this one as much as the brandy version but it was still awesome, would say this version is more similar to a barleywine, the smaller size bottle was a perfect serving too because of how strong it is, this one was a serious gusher this is one of the most unique beers out there and if you have not tried either of the Angel's Shares then you really need to, will definitely drink again in the upcoming years, congratulations to Tomme again for brewing yet another masterpiece","Floydster","May 07, 2008"
4.37,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty tasty brew that I really enjoyed. That being said, there's no way I could ever drink more than one. The oak and bourbon teeter on the border of being absolutely delicious and way over the top. Either way, its good to the last drop and ridiculously complex. Big thanks to Tim and Shane!!","younger35","May 06, 2008"
4.3,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a beautiful deep brown color dark and beautiful. The small tan head quickly dissipates slowly. Average lacing and surprisingly above average carbonation. Usually, barrel aged beers become flat. Not this beer. I appears o be bottle condition. Smell of strong bourbon and sweet roasted dark malts. Tastes of strong bourbon/whiskey, coffee, sweet roasted malts, coffee, and toffee. Complex and very tasty - This WORLD CLASS. Drink and Enjoy!","ATLbeerDog","May 03, 2008"

4.72,10.3,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Pours a dark brown and ruby with a huge rocky light tan head. Appears to be quite overcarbonated. Nose REEKS of bourbon heat and dark fruits, wood. Taste = Bourbon! dark fruit, caramel, bourbon soaked raisins, vanilla, caramel apple, wood and bourbon and alcohol on the finish. Wonderful. Great sweetnes lingers in the mouth and on the lips. This one will be amazing after a few years in the cellar. Mouthfeel is suprisingly thin and waaayyy more carbonated than I expected. Drinkability is good for the style, but will greatly improve with some cellaring I think. Certainly an amazing concoction, bourbon is right up front. Defenitely a great cellar candidate. Pleased to have had the opportunity to have tried it. Thanks again, Dana!","AKBelgianBeast","Apr 30, 2008"
4.2,-1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The cork flew out of this 375ml and then the beer erupted. Dark brown, it looks just like the brandy version. Nice bourbon and wood smell. Tastes like cola and vanilla coupled with bourbon, some licorice. This is a very flavorful beer and the alcohol was well hidden. I preferred the profile on the brandy barrel version a little more but this was still very good.","ArrogantB","Apr 27, 2008"

4.77,11.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is an incredibly complex beer. Calling it a strong ale is almost insulting, but I don't know where else it should go either. I sipped this over the course of two hours and enjoyed every minute of it.","","Apr 24, 2008"
3.65,-14.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Somehow not nearly as well integrated, nor nearly so tasty as the 2006 Brandy version (I have yet to try the 2007). I could see this getting close, but somehow the base beer has changed too much while residing in the barrel. I wonder if the changed flavor, lightened body, along with the gushing, is caused by a slight infection? If so it is not so much as to drastically effect things or even be overtly noticeable, but this beer is just enough off to keep it from being great.","Gueuzedude","Apr 23, 2008"
4.73,10.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"D- I really really wanted to not like this beer. I tried to find as much wrong with it as I could but I just couldn't. Not a huge fan of the brewery, didn't buy into the hype and I loved it. Try to get a bottle now why there is still some in circulation, you won't regret it.","Lothore","Apr 16, 2008"
4.72,10.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"What an exceptional beer. I'm not convinced this is a barleywine strictly. It's a bit heavy on the dark, chocolate and crystal malts. It pours a dark brown, almost black. It also has a significant chocolate flavor on there. There's also tons of caramel and vanilla from the bourbon barrel. It's pretty thick, full bodied, but it goes down silky smooth. This was by far the best beer at the fest, even though I'm not sure it would classify as a barleywine by BJCP or by GABF standards. I guess that's why lost abbey classifies it as one of their ""non-denomination beers."" Still, this is a must have for any beer fan. What a treat. I could sit for hours and just sniff that vanilla, caramel, chocolate and oak.","TheEremite","Apr 16, 2008"

4.89,14.3,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability/Notes: Sure am glad I joined the LA Sinners Club. Where else could I get such fantastic beer. Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share hits a home run. I'm not a big fan of some bourbon barrel aged beers but this one is spot on. The bourbon accents the beer not dominating the flavor profile whatsoever. Plenty of big, rich, dark fruit with hints of vanilla and bourbon all finished with a nice bit of hop bitterness. Alcohol is so well hidden its dangerous. A true sipper that gets better as it warms. Seek and Enjoy !! Highly Recommended !","SwillBilly","Apr 06, 2008"
4.8,12.1,5,5,4.5,5,5,"Every sip makes me a little more pissed that Tomme Arthur is on his rag because of his beers being sold on ebay and no longer releasing this beer in 750 ml size.

5,16.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured into a Double Bastard Glass. Beautiful appearance. Root beer brown, with a decadent head. Smell fluttered with alcohol, just for a second, then came the carmel sweetness, and malty tang. The taste. Come on!! Flirted with heavenly. Bourbon flavor, mixed expertly with rich, malt, sugar, carmel flavor. This beer felt wonderful on the mouth, dangerously almost too good. Drinkability off the charts. I could drink this beer regularly. If you have the means I highly suggest you getting this beer. Truly exceptional and one of the best beers I have ever had.","ralflord","Mar 26, 2008"
4.95,15.7,5,5,5,4.5,5,"It's difficult to write an appropriate description of a transcendental experience. This divine concoction changed my perspective on what beer could be. It offers every bit of complexity of a great wine melded with the deep satisfaction of a superb beer. Most barleywines seem to be overly sweet or harshly alcoholic but the balance in this beer is tremendous. Do whatever you can to secure some of this incredible beer.","explosivebeer","Mar 17, 2008"
4.75,11,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Flavors of malt, vanilla, chocolate, with hints of molasses, bourbon, and toffee. The tastes don't linger too long, so there is no overpowering buildup. Moderate carbonation helps to cleanse the palate. Somewhat hot, much smoother than the Brandy version. A fantastic, world class beer.","mrkrispy","Mar 17, 2008"

Now I have not really had anything from Lost Abbey that I have not liked, but this and Devotion on back to back nights have really taken this thing to a while new level. The complexity displayed in the is uncanny and I really had a touch time with this review, as I am not usually at a loss for words with my reviews, but this one had me there, it was just that good. I really look forward to the Brandy and Bourbon barrel aged editions later this year; they will truly be breathtaking as I can only imagine the heights to which this one will get.","mikesgroove","Jan 25, 2008"

4.87,13.8,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Drinkability- Falling in lockstep with other reviews, I've found this to be an ale worthy of the prized top-tier, the overall taste sensation is that of a creamy and complex barleywine with excellent drinkability despite the 11%abv, the flavor profile jumps across a range of flavor sensations but somehow wraps it all up into a well-balanced package, given the scarcity of Angel's Share, this is a primo Strong Ale that should be reserved for special occasions assuming you can get your hands on one!","Stoneman78","Jan 10, 2008"

4.5,5.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A muddy dark caramel brown. I've had the pleasure of sipping this one at least five times at various beer fests in the bay area. The most recent tasting having been at the 2007 barrel aged beer festival at the bistro in Hayward, California. This brew like mentioned above is a dark muddy colour with a small and thin off-white/brownish head of foam that dies quickly and is hard to revive. This brew in my chalice glass just reeks of bourbon and oak with a heart dose of candied bready malts as well. Hopheads may want to look the other way as this brew is all about the over the top sweet malts and their caramel sugary flavours which are enhanced by the notes of bourbon and oak that are left on this brew after Tommes aging process take hold. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, and reminiscent of a petite champagne cognac. Drinkability is good for one so heavy. Truly a legend in the oak/aged strong ale/barley wine category.","francisweizen","Dec 15, 2007"
4.51,5.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Beautiful muddy, and thick, brown color with a light brown head that leaves very little lacing. Every swirl of this Angel produces a generous head back. Smell is of doughy, cookie and a rich toffee, buttery, and maple syrup boozy bourbon notes. Taste is sweet and awfully creamy. Mouthfeeling is great and allows you palate to soak in all the tasty bourbon and leaves a lingering warming. Great beer!","genog","Dec 13, 2007"
4.38,2.3,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: Thanks to oodeftone for hooking me up. Without you, I wouldnt have ever had the chance. This beer is great. I would drink it all the time if I could. Another great beer from Port.","OStrungT","Nov 26, 2007"
4.55,6.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"On cask at the brewery. Aroma perks forth with suave, sleek grandeur enticing in so many fruits, rich nuttiness and bold gout-inducing richness. Sprightly. Out of the hand engine, the beer comes as a ruddy hued mahogany, clouded with a fine, silky smooth cream head in tobacco tinted cloud. Flavor is redolent with extravagant creamed malts, mature sugar density and a whole pantheon of nuts, fruits, chocolate, nips of tobacco and fragrant plums. Texture completely sublime, the cask presentation heightening the sickening drinkability of a beer so hefty. The bourbon smoothes corners, draws deep breaths of moist woodiness and clean nut-dry parching quality. More rounded and deep than the Brandy-barrel version and it shows. I really didnt think this beer could get any better.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 23, 2007"
4.7,9.8,4,4,5,5,5,"Deep, deep brown color-poured from the bottle a beautiful burgundy. Small head gone all too quickly. Sweet smelling-very port and raisen like. Wonderfully deep and rich flavor. Great notes of vanilla and oak. Noticeable alcohol flavors. Whiskey like flavors as well. Very smooth and creamy considering the abv. Lingering whiskey bite on the tongue. Very impressive beer. Night cap describes it all. Many thanks to callenak for this treat from Secret Santa 2006. Best US strong I have had-period.","lackenhauser","Apr 08, 2007"
4.87,13.8,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Got a chance to try this at the Port brewery last time we were there during a tasting. Rich, complex strong ale with strong oak overtones.
