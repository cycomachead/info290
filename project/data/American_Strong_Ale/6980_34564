Some faint bubbles pop up and pop down when in the snifter, they had a beige tint to them, no spots on the glass going down. At this point the hops have all but faded. There is a big caramel toffee vibe here with some underlining dark fruit mixture. Brown sugar and toasted malt. Super Kitty Kat tastes like it smells. Rich caramel, drk fruit, chocolate, semi vanilla tones, Toast. The alcohol pops out in just the slightest fashion. Feel is a step down from full bodied with a small amount of car bubbles on the tounge. Swift easy drinking, while not being overly complex, even at 6 years old. A great beer to share though with the size of the bottle and everything.","BARFLYB","Oct 16, 2012"

Faint aroma, sweet crystal malts, sticky hops, yes honey, and if a I imagine hard enough oak too. An aggressive malty and hoppy flavor. Kind of a piney resinous hop flavor presents itself. Very sweet, yes I can detect honey, some light notes of vanilla and brown sugar too. As the beer warms some of that oak actually shows up. For such a strong beer the alcohol is super well hidden. Pretty rich and somewhat cloying. I typically like my American Strong Ales pretty brash and oaky/malty and this falls shy.","pmlondrigan","May 02, 2011"

The flavor is equally disappointing. There is malt sweetness and brown sugar plus some caramel and light earthy hops. Maybe a touch of citrus. Medium body with some booze.

Once I got over the bittered flavor and the alc warmed me a bit I really got into it. If you dig oak aged brews this is a worthy one to try for sure since the wood really adds a great touch to the flavor, but the price tag is a bit hefty compared to other limited release brews that are out there.

Taste is hoppy and bitter with a very interesting balance of floral, piney and citrus hops and a sweet toffee and carmel like malt backbone. Lighter side of full bodied, borders on syrupy, very dry.

This beer almost has too much going on to capture all of the tastes, and once the alcohol starts kicking it it's very hard to keep a handle on this cornucopia of flavor. Light to medium carbonation with a smooth creamy feel on the tongue and in the mouth, this beer goes down way too easy for 12% ABV...well done Keegan's, this beer is very enjoyable and will kick your ass at the same time!","CHickman","Jan 17, 2010"
3.68,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a sampling glass at the brewery, it appeared amber with less than a finger of white head, but great lacing. It smelled of super-sweet pineapple, dates, and caramel, and the taste simply confirmed this, and did not reveal any other nuances to me. One feature of the flavor that was positively surprisingly was that the syrupy sweetness did dissipate fairly quickly after the finish, a nice twist given the fact that most Strong Ales and Barleywines usually leave you with a lingering, cloying sweetness. Also, the alcohol seemed surprisingly well-hidden. Smooth and not as thick as I had expected; it certainly helps this intense beer's sessionability..at least until the alcohol knocks you on your rear end. A nice beer overall, but I wasn't as blown away as I had been expecting to be, given all of the stellar reviews I had read.","donniecuffs","Jan 09, 2010"

Clear ruddy amber. A deep caramel and butterscotch maltiness greets my nose. Notes of oak and vanilla. Light piney hops and a bit of fusel alcohol. A soft sweet caramel on the tongue is countered by a healthy grapefruit and leafy hop bittering. A delicious woodiness flows into light vanilla. Alcohol is there, especially in the finish as it leaves light evaporative vapors. It is so well integrated that it never calls attention to itself. Quite a feat for the abv.

It has a very complex array of malts/hops/and oak character. It's got a solid malt base with just enough crystal malt flavor to balance the enormous hop taste. The oak chips really bring it all together. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer.

Modest and loose medium khaki head, that leaves a film, collar and moderate bits of fine lace. Bold nose charged with a load of sweet malt (smells like honey). Full flavor ASA, winter sipper deluxe. Smooth, warming and well crafted. It is not easy to craft a 12% brew that is malty but not overly sweet or overly hot. Super kitty is neither. No bargain at $24.99 for the full growler...glad they will fill 16 ouncers with a swing top..","Billolick","Nov 27, 2009"
4.15,5.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D: High octane and hoppy. I'd be careful with too many of these regardless. I think it could sneak up on you because it hides its ABV well. I enjoyed this beer in the past but even more so this year. I have a 3 year vertical of bottles in my basement that I will enjoy reviewing against my notes for this.","BTPete","Nov 15, 2009"
4.7,19.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is one of those beers that no one talks about, but then you open up the bottle and are simply blown away. What a fantastic beer! It's so good I went through a whole quart of it myself. The only flaw I noticed in this beer is that it could have been a little more viscous. If Keegan could somehow fix this aspect of the beer, Super Kitty would be a top 30 beer on the best of BA...easily.","rhinos00","Sep 13, 2009"
4.82,22.6,4,4.5,5,5,5,"Drinkability is off the charts. There is no,nil zero, nada, zilch taste of alcohol to this big beer, which is extremely dangerous.","cavedave","Sep 11, 2009"
4.22,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability - It was very good, I don't know if I would want to drink this a lot. But it was good.","sensorglitch","May 16, 2009"
4.3,9.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a rich amber with a creamy tan head. Nose has candy malts, dark fruits, peppery alcohol, honey, cloves, subtle hops, vanilla and oak. Taste has more sweet malts, oak, vanilla, honey, plums, figs and floral hops. Big body is nicely carbonated. Tasty American Strong Ale.","rye726","Mar 10, 2009"
4.27,8.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability: based on the big alcohol in this one, it is truely a slow sipper. Overall the flavor is great, and this one is worth picking up depsite the high cost. Grolsch styled top allows this to keep over a session.","Gavage","Jan 06, 2009"
3.88,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"And it stays true to the scent with the addition of fruit. Quite hoppy, actually. Very strong taste, so it's more of a take it easy kind of beer.","Amalak","Dec 31, 2008"
3.92,-0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: The punchy (but never glaring considering the ABV%) alcohol keeps this one a slow sipper, but an enjoyable one.","ChainGangGuy","Nov 14, 2008"
4.77,21.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"After a bit of fussing with the swingtop to break the wax, this opens with a hearty fizz. Pours a hazy amber with a thin finger's head that builds and dissipates slowly. The scent is great - honey, toasted oat, charred oak, caramel, a little bourbon. The taste is wow. Spiced apple-pear tart with a nice buttery crust topped w. a drizzle of honey. Oak, vanilla, a little bourbon burn and again honey. Hops have faded slightly but are still present, lending a sweetly floral note to the finish that complements nicely. A lot going on here even at lower temps, not sure I'm conveying it all. As indicated by the top popping, this still has a fair bit of carbonation to it. Medium body but not at all syrupy. Scarily drinkable for the strength and complexity. Top notch and the first ""wow"" beer I've had in quite a while. Actually worth the sticker price. Nice way to send out 08","grandq","Mar 15, 2008"
4.22,7.4,4.5,5,4,4.5,3.5,"The sweetness and booze strength hampers the drinkability on this one a bit, but by the rare chance that you have to possibility to try this, do. It's a very original brew that is equaled in character by few other beers that I've imbibed thus far.","khiasmus","Jan 02, 2007"
4.38,11.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I was a little suprised when I got wrung up for a 30 $ bottle of beer but having opened it I am pleasantly suprised. The honey and oak flavoring adds alot to the hurricane kitty. Everything seems to come together nicely. Certainly not an everyday beer but a nice ""occasion beer"". Seems I am lucky to have gotten one of 200 bottles of this Ale, I will pass the word on to a few of my beer loving friends :)","Biggness","Beers"
3.9,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste: Nice smooth medium bodied beer. Oaky honey and piney hops are most prevalant. Alcohol is evident but not overpowering. Not much flavor on the finish though but I really prefer a beer that hangs around a while. Basically you have to continually drink to really appreciate the flavor but at 12% its a little dangerous. Not entirely sure why the price was so high but would try again if it becomes a regular, more reasonbly priced brew.","nriech","0"
