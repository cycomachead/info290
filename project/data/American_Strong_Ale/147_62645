3.65,-12,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served in a craft pub glass, beer pours deep and coppery in color, with a lighter, substantial head.  Smells like malt bomb, and a little bit oaky.  Imperial red ale, perhaps?  Of course, drinking more than two months after Stone's stated expiration date will do bad things to the promised dry hopping.  The flavor, however, still carries a load of West coast style hops.  Too much, even for the rather aggressive malt bill, full of bronze barley malt.  The fractional dosage of oak barreling adds a really nice touch, and survives in the palate despite the strength of the other flavors.","hreb","Mar 08, 2015"

Hops are citric (grapefruit) and earthy w/ moderately high spiciness. Bitterness is clean, firm, sometimes a little sharp but clears relatively quickly. Heavy, sweet cooked caramel flies under the cloak of the hops, keeps the assertive hops from wrecking the palate. Molasses-like dark sweetness is present as well. The beer has a touch of warmth from the oak. The oak adds a layer of complexity and rounds out the beer some. More heat is added by the fusel alcohols present in this big beer. Warmth from the alcohol is detected with each sip. Some cereal/grains are present in the finish. Body is medium-thick. Carbonation is appropriate to style. This is a darn good brew. Sip. Enjoy. Repeat.","mac31","Dec 24, 2014"
3.86,-7,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"An active pour yields voluminous three fingers worth of late to develop off white colored frothy goodness comprised of varying sized bubbles...  Super star retention...   The head becomes lighter and takes on a more whipped appearance as it settles a bit...  A light to moderate bit of carbonation, some of which clings to the glass and the rest of which moves at a moderate pace...  The color is a light brown and cherry red...  A wee bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass...  The nose is more subdued than expected...  A light piney hop presence...  A malty bread base lies beneath the surface...  Smells like a standard American strong ale, but without any of the individual complexities of the brews blended herein...  However, it should be noted that the nose continues to evolve and intensify as this one warms closer to room temperature...  The end result is a very robust and potent bouquet...  The flavor profile has some light piney hop intensity, some medicinal cough drop character, toffee and a strong malty bready base...  Medium bodied and sturdy...  Dry throughout with a slight increase in intensity on the finish...  Limited carbonation...  Not a bad beer by any means, but not remarkable different from any of the three constituents which make it up...

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around that glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, floral, grass, oak, light vanilla, and floral/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of big citrus/tropical hops, moderate dark malt sweetness, and oak notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, floral, grass, oak, light vanilla, and floral/oak earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, oak, and floral/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops, dark/bready malt, and moderate oak flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an fantastic blended strong ale style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops, dark/bready malt, and moderate oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

An array of  aromas: over ripe citrus orange and pineapple, vanilla, sweet dark fruit, herbal hops, funky yeast, and caramel malt. Medium bodied with lazy, yet incredibly rich carbonation through the middle. Tangy, minty and ripe citrus hop flavors with smooth vanilla. Sweet maltiness throughout. Herbal and citrus hops give way to emerging pine hoppiness from the middle to the end. Finished semi-dry with a slightly subdued lingering pine hop bitterness. The Bastards belong in the their own category.","IronLover","Nov 21, 2014"

Nice Brown/amber color with a  2 finger head when poured into a pint glass.  Get the hops and several fruit notes on the nose (grapefruit, maybe cherry).  The taste is very hoppy, with a smooth finish of some nutty or typical brown characteristics.  Again, the beer is smooth with very good body.  Lacing is consistent down the glass, lasting well after I finish.  Hope I get Lukcy again sometime soon.","gonzo000","Nov 15, 2014"

And yet it still leaves nice small sticky lacing. The aroma is woody, with light hints of caramel sweetness and a little floral hops. The taste is delicious, but changes slightly with each sip, with some oaky, some more malt-forward, and others more aggressively hops. It has a nice weight and smooth feel with a big bite at the finish.","delta490","Nov 14, 2014"

Aroma is like sticking my face in a bag of raw hops, lemon peel, soapiness, grass. Flavor is super sweet maltiness but not particularly heavy, big vegetal hops but not particularly bitter, caramel, biscuity malts, oak. A bit of a lemony pinesol note here, and the malts are on the bland side. Medium plus body, dry as expected for a bastard, with medium low carbonation. Not so sure I'm into this one, as it lacks both the the bitterness and the heavy malt profile of Bastard. Seems on the watered down side, flavor wise. It's pretty decent but just falls incredibly flat for me. Huh.","BMMillsy","Nov 08, 2014"

4.23,1.9,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"The beer pours a nice tannish and caramel colored head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a clear brown and dark ruby color  that gives it a very heavy appearance. The beer smell has strong dry hopped notes and it's those notes that tend to dominate the nose. The beer has other notes such as a strong pine smell independent from the dry hopped pine. The non-dry hopped smell smells much deeper, richer, and subdued than the dry hopped smell. The smell has strong oak notes that mix well with the hops. The oak and the hops combine to make a very interesting forest smell that is fairly aromatic and pleasing. The taste has much of the same notes and the smell translates very well. The oak and hops become more woody while the dry hops are less present than in the smell. The taste also has a slight caramel taste to take the edge off of the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied but feels lighter with all the carbonation. The beer is fairly smooth though. Overall, a very good beer and one worth getting while it's available in stores.","HattedClassic","Nov 06, 2014"

The aroma had the big malt and hoppy aroma you expect with a Bastard with more of the Arrogant tones showing through. The taste was great. It was all of the Bastards in one place giving their best flavor attributes while complementing the others with a great roasted nuttiness holding it all together. I detected more of the Arrogant flavors which held their own alongside the dominate Double while the thick syrupy mouthfeel and heavy body was definitely all Double. The Lucky Basartd was a great marriage of these fantastic Stone brews that created a Basartd of it’s own.","brurevu","Sep 04, 2013"

Excellent retention and good legs. Nose is inviting bitter hops, grapefruit with sweet malt underneath. Oaked presence off the nose and a little pine. Hops are softer on the nose than on the palate. Slick, resiny, long finish but slightly wet with a bitter aftertaste. Body is medium heavy, a touch imbalanced, and favors the sweet aspect of the malt and citrus despite the abundance of bitterness. It’s an agreeable contradiction though at 8.5 ABV.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

Smell is piney and quite hoppy, citrus with lots of orange flavour, malt, caramel with a faint bit of vanilla and oak. Taste is a mix of caramel, malt and hops, lots of pine and citrus, fairly bitter throughout, oak-vanilla, toasted in the finish, mildly sweet but drying mid palate, hoppy aftertaste. Medium carbonation, perhaps a touch high, medium body, decent feel. Quite a nice beer, very drinkable but I think of all the bastards I would go with straight up Arrogant Bastard as my favourite but I would certainly drink this again.","peensteen","Feb 22, 2013"

Toffee, grass, orange peel, and sweet lemon on the nose. The mouthfeel is wet, smooth, full, but lacking carbonation sting. There's a less offensive hop presence in this concoction than is normal for Stone. In fact, it might even be described as drinkable. I note a lot of pine and a little orange. There's some balance. But, I'm not sure with what. The finish, however, delivers that familiar Stone hop hot sensation and bitterness. Not horrible, but I've been duped by Stone, once again.

But true hopheads will likely find this superb, featuring a stunning and powerful array of hop flavors. The beer does suffer somewhat from the heaviness of the hops, however, especially in the licorice overtone, and could have used either slightly less hops, or slightly more fruits to balance things out. Still, this is amazing brew, and worth trying.","jondeelee","Nov 19, 2012"

A tad bit of warmth despite being quite hoppy and bitter. Not amazingly complex, but a great example of a delicious hoppy brew. I would recommend this one.","Mic-Lee","Nov 19, 2012"
4.55,9.6,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours dark ruby brown with a two-finger length of-white head that retains very well. There is plenty of lacing left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are a lot of hop aromas in the smell. I get the typical citrus and pine. There's some oakiness and plenty of caramel malt. There's a lot going on here in the flavor. Those hops are up front and are somewhat dank with plenty of citrus. The piney hops are stronger in the back end and there is a nice lingering aftertaste. I get the caramel oakiness that is typical of the oaked bastard. There's a solid malt backbone here that is typical of the regular arrogant bastard. There is some alcohol too. It almost seems like I get different aspects of the different bastards with each sip. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. It's a smooth beer that drinks very well. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Nov 19, 2012"

Massive and complex but detectable booze throughout that stings the gums and burns the throat a touch. A little too overly complex that slaps the tongue around and confuses the taste buds.

A very high recommendation, this was a great beer and another fine strong ale from Stone. Embrace the chaos of Stone brewing and get fkucde pu no shti ebre!","CHickman","Nov 10, 2011"
4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"As expected big drying hops on the middle and finish. Earthy and herbacious at the end, with some fruity and pine in the middle. Big dose of caramel and toffee really tame the hop bitterness. Fig like and resiny. Oak and oak tannins with a bit of vanilla lie back and let there presence be known. Again rye like spicy qualities in the middle and finish, raisin, milk chocolate and more. A nice beer.","mcallister","Oct 30, 2011"

It's almost like everything is so well balanced you find it difficult to isolate any one strongest flavor. It's just unbelievably smooth, rich, creamy and very drinkable. It has a full mouthfeel and is quite filling. This stuff is absolutely great.","Sdesenberg","Oct 23, 2011"

Intense individual essences all add up to one mother of a brew, and crazily drinkable at that. 8.5 points of ABV slide slinkily over all. Hoppy, sweet, and all that is good with what you should be expecting. Dirnk tihs nwo if yuo cna!","biboergosum","Oct 18, 2011"
4.17,0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Picked up some cheeses from the very excellent Murray's NYC and figured now would be a good time to experience this 2010 bottle. Into a tulip glass this pours a very dense and dull mahogany under an impressive tan head. Nose delivers a deep blend of brown sugar, caramel candy, and citrus. An outstanding but controlled citrus bitter character really shines on the palate above all and is solidly paired on the palate with a nutty and sweet caramel malt body. Big body and flavor but relatively smooth. And oh yeah, very nice with cheese--particularly with Rogue River Blue from Rogue River Creamery.","albertjr21","Oct 07, 2011"
4.03,-2.9,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,4,"O - A very good brew from Stone. Everything blends together quite well and there's a nice balance between the hops and malts which makes for a good sipper. Worth every sip all the way to the arrogant end!","jzeilinger","Sep 27, 2011"

4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Oak and vanilla flavors. Piney hops and solid malt character. The alcohol becomes more prevalent as it warms and tends to heat up the otherwise, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Big and bitter hoppy finish. Fantastic.","nimrod979","Sep 27, 2011"
4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I really enjoyed this. I drank many of these earlier in the year but wasn't reviewing beers at the time. I think the last one I had I traded. This one comes from Handsombrewer, thanks Ben. I have an Arrogant Bastard every single night, have loved Double Bastard yearly and sporadically have enjoyed Oaked. Never, before this brew, did I think I would enjoy the three together. Wonderful idea and even better brew!!","azdback","Sep 13, 2011"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured out as a deep amber color with a nice looking strong cream colored head on top. The aroma of the beer was hoppy, it also had a good amount of malt on the nose too. The taste of the beer is simply a blend of the Bastard's. It's hoppy, it's a little sweet, just really nice flavors going on here. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty nice also, has a good medium to thick body with a solid amount of carbonation. Overall I was glad I got a bottle of this, it went pretty quick at my local shop.","Knapp85","Sep 01, 2011"

4.23,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"this beer pours a nice translucent reddish brown with the off white head fading slowly to a layer of patchy lace. the aroma brings a very nice sweet roasted malt palate with the citrus hops coming through nicely. the taste follows with caramel malt coming through strongly, the citrus hops finishing up with a nice amount of grapefruit bitterness. the full body and bit of alcohol warmth make this a really good strong ale.","almychristopher","Aug 18, 2011"

4.09,-1.4,3,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a deep red/brown color with a small head that doesnt hang around for very long. A ton of sweet malts, a mild waft of alcohol and that signature, spicy Arrogant Bastard hop profile. Round creamy body, the sweetness of the malts dominate the flavor but i never once found the beer to be too cloying. Complex and layered with characteristics of all the beers blended showing their stuff. I loved it, im not the biggest Double Bastard fan and IMO this blend showed that beer wonderfully. Great job.","ATPete","Jul 10, 2011"
3.83,-7.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall. For me this beer was just ok. Nothing to sell the farm for or mortagage the house but if you find these for the right price pick it up its very drinkable and has a decent flavor profile","DarthKostrizer","Jul 02, 2011"
4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I Love this beer. I had this when it first was released and loved it then. Trying it now, I Love it still but think it's good to go. Any more aging and the hop character will be gone and the sweet maltiness will dominate. So if you have one, don't sit on it much longer.","MrVonzipper","Jul 01, 2011"
4.27,2.9,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle a hazy, dark, orange-chestnut color with a dense but small white cap of bubbly, off-white head. Aroma is similar to Arrogant Bastard, with lots of pine and citrus hops being the prominent feature. Pine and citrus in the taste, with a strong caramel malt base, earthy, with notes of resin, orange, grapefruit, with subtle touches of booze in the background. Very strong, but uncommonly smooth. Heavy-medium mouthfeel, lots of flavor, and definitely drinkable, but not for the weak of heart.","Rifugium","Jun 28, 2011"

3.63,-12.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall - not a bad tasting beer, had it at a sampling with SpinRSX and was grateful to have tried it.","Swedes21","Jun 21, 2011"
4.5,8.4,4,4,5,4,4.5,"The bottle itself is super awesome and worth keeping. The beer looks like a blend of Arrogant (Double) Bastard and Old Guardian. It is clear, ruddy brown and looks syrupy. The smell is more sweet and malty than regular Bastard. The taste is super duper awesome! I have no idea whether this particular brew was supposed to benefit from aging, but it may well have. The balance of sweet, caramel malt and herbal hops is perfect for my palate. I expected the beer to have more alcohol heat, but it doesn't at all. The taste is hops up front, then lingering brown sugar and bread. I really love it.","PhiloPsych","Jun 12, 2011"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall – Another great beer from Stone. The flavours are nice and the beer has a nice full flavoured punch. I’d say that it is worth seeking out.","spinrsx","Jun 09, 2011"

4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The hop bitterness is more pronounced in the taste. There's a strong alcohol warmth behind the lightly sweet flavor of brown sugar. The body is rich with a high (balancing) carbonation level. There's a bit of yeast in the swallow, but the aftertaste is an excellent balance of hop and high-alcohol malt. In short, a wonderful beer.","smcolw","May 22, 2011"
4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D/O- DIPA/American Barleywiney, good beer. Excellent value at $5.99.

3.98,-4.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Finish. Sticky and long. The hops deliver a ripe citrus sweetness with a mild bitterness. But this is where the beer kinda falls apart.

4.55,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. This is a great blend and all the flavors of Bastards that I fell in love with are represented.

4,-3.6,4,4,4.5,3,3.5,"D/O: This beer is a pretty fair attempt at a big, oaky version of Arrogant Bastard but it has some rough edges, compared to the rare Oaked Double Bastard I love so much. The bitterness demands a little too much attention here, constraining its smoothness. Otherwise this anniversary blend of the Bastard has some appeal, and in predictable fashion it takes no prisoners.","beagle75","May 10, 2011"
4.6,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Really a wonderful beer. There really isn't much I could say here that hasn't been said in the previous reviews.

4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this beer was how much contrast there was, even within it, from the start to the finish. You begin with a sickly sweet, roasty drink, and are left with a woody, boozy flavoring, and a bone dry mouth. The blending is also expertly balanced, as none of the components readily outweigh any of the others.","TheBrewo","Apr 28, 2011"
4.07,-1.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch light tan head that fades to a small cap. Decent rings of lace around the glass. Smells of brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and citrus zest. Taste is of sweet brown sugar, caramel, and biscuit up front with a citrus zest hop bite on the finish. Mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. Beer has decent carbonation and is somewhat smooth going down. Overall, this is a very good beer that is an interesting blend of 3 of Stone's Bastard releases. It would have been a good idea to have one of these fresh though.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 27, 2011"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Well, this is still a good beer, don't get me wrong, but Stone brews others that I find a bit more enjoyable. I did enjoy this and would never turn it down of it was offered, but it's just not my pereferable style. With that being said, it's easily drinkable and worth a try for sure. It has enough complexity to make for an excellent conversation piece. I started to enjoy this brew more as I went along.","Shrews629","Apr 25, 2011"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is a mix of pine and orange hops, with quite a bit of caramel malt and some alcohol. I also get a little bit of brown sugar. The flavor is orange citrus with some oaked caramel notes. I also get a little bit of alcohol and some pine hop notes. As the beer warms, the oaked notes become more prominent. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer.","Mora2000","Apr 23, 2011"
4.1,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is inappropriately drinkable for a 8.5% strong ale. I actually didn't realize Lukcy was a strong ale, for some reason I thought I'd grabbed Self-Righteous, so it went into a pint glass. Too quick. Into a tulip for the for sure.

When you take a sip you notice the thickness, some bitterness bites at the mouth, you taste sweet caramel malt, lost of citrus and pine from the hops and a hint of wood. This is a heavy, full bodied beer that doesn't hold back, it has the right amount of carbonation and a long lingering finish.

The first things that I get are oakiness and a lot of pine and citrus hops. I almost get a touch of sourness to the citrus hops. You can tell there are a fair amount of malts in there also, but they are hidden by the hops. The taste is up front with the citrus hops, but balanced with the malts nicely. Don't get me wrong, there are a ton of hops but they are somewhat muted with the malts. Some raostiness, oakiness, caramel and a dry finish: no sweetness here at all. Nice.","Boto","Mar 06, 2011"
3.72,-10.4,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. I will have to read the bottle after reviewing this, but it is almost like they took their original recipe for The Bastard and stepped up the malt. This beer finishes quite a bit more drinkable than the original version does from the start. Though this beer is pretty good now, I think that I would prefer it after it has cellared for a couple years so that it would take the edge off of the hops in the initial part of the flavor profile as they are a bit aggressive right now. I would expect no less from a Stone Bastard iteration, but just personal preference. Either way, this beer is worth a shot no doubt.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 06, 2011"

Smells of citrus, resin with a solid caramel malt backbone that fights hard for a voice. Hints of mint, garlic and tropical fruit round out the nose nicely. Taste is what I'd expected from the aroma although the malt comes through a lot more than I expected. Solid caramel backbone melts into pine resin, citrus and garlic hop bitterness. Finish is rather dry but leaves a fleeting hop bitterness with a hint of alcohol on my palette after every sip. Resinous bubbly and almost creamy mouthfeel, moderate level of bubbles, medium body.

Great mouthfeel and is smooth on the palate with a hoppy bitterness that lasts forever. First appearance is that of an amber ale but the depth of flavor and richness in the middle is much more complex.

The taste says more of a pine hop bitterness nicely mellowed by a sweet caramel malt. It's a little tangy with steady carbonation for a lively feel in a medium-plus bodied brew.

4.78,15.2,5,4.5,5,4,5,"Ho, I had forgotten the depth of the color of this beer! The thick finger of deep-tawny head sat there daring me to do anything. In spite of that, I mustered up the courage to hold it to the light, revealing a beautiful ruby red with NE-quality clarity. The nose burned some hairs in my nose. It had some upfront heat accompanied by oak, caramel, pine and vanilla. I suddenly felt the urge to kowtow before this beer in the hopes that I would be allowed to live. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with an immediate heat on the tongue that stood aside to allow the heavy richness of the malt to take control. The oak was definitely present also, but the sweet heat reminded me of drinking bourbon. Whew! Some mentioned an intense bitterness, but I got that (the hops) on the finish. As it warmed, I got flavors of orange zest and pine, especially on the finish. Jeez-O man, but this was like being in a crazy bar fight where one guy starts in face-to-face, then somebody taps you on the shoulder and when you turn around, a fist to the murph is waiting. Maybe I'm NOT worthy, but I'm committed now. The lacing that began to appear looked like it was going to need a jackhammer to chisel it out later. I am ready to cry. I thought that I was solid going into this, but I am ready not to retreat, but to simply advance in a new direction, like backwards away from this beast. As a gauge, the verbiage on the reverse of the bottle suddenly became completely comprehensible and I even noticed that the "B" was constructed of a "1" and a "3" in honor of the Bastard's 13th anniversary. The secret ingredient in this beer may be LSD, given the swirling colors that I am beginning to see. I think I can fly, man. Dig it! OK, now I'm feeling Lukcy and the Basartd has his arm around my shoulder. That's my bad shoulder, so I hope that he is like another famous personality and the laying on of hands will cure my bursitis. I was really starting to notice the pine-y hops and the oakiness as it warmed. It was really woody, which is fitting, given my nickname. I thought that I read a review where someone felt that this was not holding up. Either I am hallucinatory (VERY possible) or that person was Un-Lukcy in their bottle. There were still some on the shelf at my local, so I may pick up some for cellaring. Yes, it is THAT good.","woodychandler","Feb 20, 2011"

Toasted, roasted scents and a little distant pepper. Great! The taste is equally intense...bitter, but balanced. Aggressive hops, semi-sweet, lots of malt (especially prominent in the hind-taste).

Some pine, a hint of citrus and some fruits (mainly some cherry). There are some malt aromas, mainly in the background there is some caramel. As far as taste goes it's pretty comparable to the smell. At first I got a lot of malt followed by a nice bitter taste from the hops. Almost a lingering sweetness in there. Finishes with a nice hop bite, kind of piney in a way. Mouthfeel is a bit above average, by no means thin. I slightly high ABV, but a couple of these would be no problem. Very tasty and the alcohol is pretty well hidden.

I've always found the Bastard beers to have a surprisingly sweet, almost fruity malt backbone underpinning the big hops. This one is no different there, but I think the oak helps to really round out the balance between the malt and hops.

You still get the citrus hops up front but the caramel sweetness is more pronounced giving it better balance. Neither aspect so far is complex yet both are spot on and very tasty.

First thing that hits me is a bitter hop dryness in the taste, then the malts kick. Comprising most of the medium body, there seems to be a plethora of malt flavors like roasted, bitter chocolate (toffee?), a buttery-sweet sugary sweetness like caramel, and I think I detect hints of coffee.

Big frothy head with staying power and major lacing all over the glass. The combination of all the bastards produces a citrus (little orange, little pineapple), piney and a slight floral scent. I would have a liked a little more in this area. The taste is bitter up front followed by an even bitterer (if that's a word) swallow and aftertaste. There is also a slight grassy taste and yellow grapefruit is definitely in the mix. Well done. The combo works. Drinkability is good although the flavor will knock your palate around and kill the buds after awhile. The bomber I consumed was perfect for the session but anymore would be overkill in my opinion.

Aggressive pine and grapefruit as noted in Arrogant Bastard, full notes of Carmel, brown sugar and bread that is not overly sweet from the Double Bastard and a smoothed out bitterness from the Oak Aged.

Nose expresses dark fruit, toasted malts, a trace of citrus and spice and a hint of alcohol and wood. Taste consistent with nose; however some grapefruit acidity and bitterness also comes out in the mix before finishing with a light, lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with an assertive carbonation and some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Decent, but not sure it's worth the hype.

Superbly balanced spicy-sweet malt and fresh, lively hops. Very complex. Its tough for me to pick out any distinct aromas. Good mouthfeel. Full bodied but a nice amount of carbonation. A smooth and not too heavy malt infiltrates the palate first but the hops are fast on its heels. The two end up mingling in a very unique way. The hops come through at the end but aren't too resiny. Any heavy malt is wiped away and the finish is rather crisp and clean. Quite drinkable. Again, the complexity here doesn't allow my admittedly dull palate to pick out anything distinct but it is very enjoyable.

The sweetness is there with a mild berry not and the oakiness is very substantial with the tannic quality giving a vinous accent to the grapefruit and pine from the hops. I enjoyed this beer and it evolved quite a bit from straight out of the bottle to a while later. The wood is strong and gives slightly green element which makes it seem kind of raw at first, and the flavor doesn't shy away. It is appararent this is a strong ale with the 8.5% not hidden really.

The flavor reveals a big malty body with a good hop character. It isn't as overtly bitter as Arrogant Bastard. To me, it tastes more mature and complex; probably because I know its a blend. This feels like a sipper to me, mostly because of the complexities in it (not because of the alcohol or bitterness). I'll enjoy this 22oz bottle over a nice long session. It's a great beer to relax with. It isn't very sticky, and it's lower carbonation help with the drinkability. I really enjoy this beer.

Also Im not sure the yeast strain, but it totally kills this beer for me. In all the bastards I've had this yeast really detracts from what could be a killer set of beers, stone knows hops, the yeast should be re evaluated. Taste is the faulty (for me) yeast on top of a oaked bastard, double bastard and a arrogant one. Sorry I just cant get past the yeast on this one, nothing more to add except that the body is strong, above medium, not at all hot and kinda bitey from a hopping, carb is no problem but the drinkability is.

In the nose there's a big initial splash of juicy pink grapefruit and tangerine which yields to dried pine sap, freshly mown grass and tea leaves, mixes in a touch of carob but the edgy pineapple, papaya, nectarine, apricot fruit scents don't allow for much softening effects, light resinous texture. Close to full-bodied, the hyperactivity of the carbonation both lifts it up off the tongue and scrubs the palate repeatedly. Very bitter, however, more of a knit together whole here with the pine, tea leaf, cedar, cigar ash, tree bark and leaf elements one big punch. As a result, the still ripe grapefruit, orange citrus recedes fairly far into the background. Even the nectarine, apricot, pineapple, green apple fruit woven tightly into the fabric.

The taste hits you with sweet on the tip of your tongue and then a real long dry bitter finish from middle to end. I love hopped up west coast beers. You can always count on them to have that extremely fresh resinous green hop bitterness. It just tastes so fresh because of this. This would be extremely hoppy if it weren't for the sweet malt that combines with an oak like flavor that you can definitely pick up. The combination is fantastic. It really is an IPA without being an IPA but with more malts. This is an amazing beer and it combines 3 quality beers in one to get that flavor. The Arrogant Bastard Ale, Oaked Aged Arrogant Bastard and the Double Bastard. I'm glad they came up with this idea because it adds for a really complex rich tasting beer that is very hoppy resinous and piney. It has a full body feel and since you can taste the raw hops with the sweet malt the alcohol hardly comes through for 8.5. What an amazing beer.

Unfortunately I cant seem to smell much. This has the signs of the classic bastard flavor. The first sip, however, wasn't as strong as I would have expect. Rich hop flavor, earthy, chewy. Definitely a woody flavor from the oak aged portion. Notes of caramel as well. This beer starts with a very strong hop attack, very bitter, almost spicey, then kind of fizzles before you can get to the malt and some other hop flavors. That flavor kinda seems to pair up with some of the malt. There's a citrus-malt finish. The carbonation keeps things moving but seems a little too much, only because I like my strong ales with a little less carb. Perhaps it's a way to keep it from turning into a malt bomb, which actually, now that I think about it, saves the beer.. Overall a good beer to have tried. I don't think blending the three beers made a difference.

4.08,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Chewy body that's on the fuller end with a very complex flavor profile. A blast of bitter earthy and sweet citrus hops up front that lingers throughout over the sweet malt backbone into a slightly dry warm finish. Lots of earthy pine up front as well as some citrus peel and grapefruit. I'm actually surprised how bitter this is up front even for Stone. This is countered nicely mid-palate by a sweet caramel malt character that is nice and toasty with hints of biscuit, oak and vanilla. The hops are still the prominent flavor but the malt and oak notes provide decent balance. The high ABV is well masked with only slight warmth in the finish making this beast very quaffable. This might be too bitter/hoppy for some but once again Stone has impressed me.","corby112","Dec 26, 2010"

This year's double bastard was very bitter but didn't have as much hop aroma, neither did the oaked or the regular bastard. This smelled as if it had been dry hopped after it was blended. The taste was more hop forward, but overall well balanced. It didn't have the bitter aftertaste of the double or even the arrogant bastard, the blending seems to have mellowed this out in a good way. This has to be one of the best releases Stone has put out this year. In this case, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.","jonvan04","Dec 26, 2010"

The oak is interesting here, the oak'ed arrogant bastard is likely the smallest percentage, but it still seems to be a bit too harsh here rather than achieving the vanillin / toasted wood character that I much prefer from my oak character in beer. My second poor even has a touch of buttery oak to it and really as it warms up a fair amount a big, wood-driven pepper note becomes noticeable in the nose and even more so in the flavor of this beer.","Gueuzedude","Dec 23, 2010"

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Body is a pretty garnet color, crowned by a nice, creamy tan head. Aroma is big on pineapple notes from the huge dose of hops. A decent amount of sweet dark malt, some oak, and a good bit of booze also come through. Palate is more balanced, with the roasted notes coming out but not overwhelming things, and a very good dose of pineapple-laden hops showing up mid-palate. A touch of sweetness jumps out on the swallow, before the citrusy hops provide a lingering bitterness.

Into a tulip, it poured cloudy amber, with red highlights when held up to the light, and two fingers of beige head; great retention and lacing. Very hoppy nose; dry, bitter, grassy/herbal, orange peel, and caramel apple. The taste began on a very herbal bitter note, then evolved to more caramel apple maltiness, and then finished on a dry peel note. Very little hint of the alcohol content.

Green pine resin bitterness, grapefruit rind, juicy citrus, oak, and a hint of brown sugar. This is all about the hops, but there's a good bit of malt to back it up, keeping it from being too "bright". Medium-plus bodied, bitter, and just a touch hot.

The pineapple and light citrus works really well with the malt character. I can't say I get much oak here, apart from the faint tannin character on the finish. The mild toffee-like sweetness and pineapple on the finish are quite excellent. Juicy and medium in body with soft carbonation, this feels quite good on the palate.

I think the blending allows this to an extent. The flavors are mostly cleaner, but there is a still a touch of sherry. The oak makes an appearance in the flavor, but it's just a light accent- which is nice, since I think the oaked bastard is overoaked.

Then it seems like someone dry-hopped the shit out of it, because the nose is crawling with piney and citrusy aromas. Nice beer overall, not as good as the SN 30th Grand Cru (as far as recent blended beers go), but pretty good.

So the question is "how much did you/do you enjoy it"? And "how much would you like to have another one at another time?". The answer for me is that I'd do it. I'd love another. It's a total assault on your tastebuds, and that's probably a good thing every now and again. But I've also treated it as somewhat of a sipper, allowing my palate some time to recover between sips. I really don't think I could handle a pint of this out at the pub with the lads. For that I'd prefer something a little more balanced and focused, say... the standard Stone IPA.

Flavor is rich and chewy with tones of american hops, and crystal malt. There is an interplay between deep caramel, sweet malts and really bitter hops. Again light berry flavor is detectable. The blending of the oaked bastard really tames the double down. Its a great blend for sure.

4.05,-2.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a rich ruby, with faint light red highlights when exposed to direct light. The light tan head is impressive after a vigorous pour, 3+ fingers. Head retention is great, but not world class, and while some lacing is left coating the glass there could stand to be more. The nose is a one trick pony, pure resinous, citrusy hops. Credit for just how pungent the aroma is though. After that, the taste is kind of a let down in that the hops don't pack nearly as much punch. This leaves room for some caramel maltiness to come through at the start, along with just a faint suggestion of the Oaked AB contribution. Then the hops, potent though much less so than in the aroma, come in to close things up. The mouthfeel is probably the best part of Lucky Bastard. The body is creamy without crossing over into stout-like viscosity, and the carbonation is lively and expressive while stopping short of fizziness. LuckY Bastard is a very good beer, but I feel like the blend featured to much of the relatively more malty Double Bastard, and not enough of the raw hop aggression of Arrogant Bastard, which is the beer they're supposed to be celebrating.","axeman9182","Dec 11, 2010"

The aroma is predominantly hoppy/piney, with hints of citrus, fruity esters and malts. The taste is very good, with the hops hitting your taste buds upfront with a sweet, fruity, malty finish. The blend of hops and sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Very good lacing along the glass. All in all, a very solid strong ale from Stone. A strong, in your face brew that is a must-have.

Scent is very similar to Oaked Arrogant Bastard with very minimal woody notes along with intense hoppiness and dark fruits. The taste is exactly what I thought it would taste like...a nice blend of all three of the bastards. The alcohol and strong malt profile are definitely there from the Double Bastard. The smooth and subtle wood chip notes are there from the Oaked. And the hoppy bitterness from the Original Bastard complete this tasty beer. All in all, I say it is more of a sister version to the Double Bastard than original Arrogant is. Mouthfeel is a nice full-bodied, velvety liquid that leans slightly to the sticky side.

Not the thickest head even with a slightly aggressive pour. Some retention and lacing but nothing incredible. Smell is amazing! Great pineapple and grapefruit hops that smell fresh as can be. Really impressive. Some malt but mainly those citrusy hops. This is definitely reflected in the taste. The taste is a more complex though. Its a great blend of some oak (presumably from the Oaked Arrogant) with some caremel malt and then the nice citrus hop kick as it goes down. A little bit of alcohol too but nothing bad. Mouthfeel was thicker but not too crazy with an oily slick left behind. Overall a great beer and the ABV is unnoticeable.

Aggressive hop aroma, mostly grapefruit and citrus rind, some pine resin, caramel and biscuity underneath. Light alcohol and juicy tangerine. Bitterness was nicely balanced by caramel up front, but as the malt faded it was clear who won this battle. Bitterness was powerful by the finish and was obvious that it was overloading my palate after a few sips. Pine and grapefruit flavours were prominent, but also an herbal/minty character as well as citrus pith. Some bready, biscuity notes towards the end with lingering hop bitterness and a bit of alcohol. Full bodied, average carbonation with a near-creamy texture. Mild alcohol warmth. This is powerful stuff. Brash hops are kept just under control by the considerable malt presence.

As I poured this, I thought that I had an open bag of Simcoe or Centennial hops somewhere next to me. The grapefruit, cut-pine aromas were very pronounced, but the strong backbone of malt gives it balance, especially as this beer warms a little. The taste is nothing like I expected. It was almost syrupy and I thought cloying. However, as I finished swallowing, the beer finished very smooth, full, and balanced. The beer almost seems like it doesn't have bittering hops, just a lot of dry hopping. This isn't a beer to take lightly, but I will look for this one again.","Fillpott","Dec 05, 2010"

Not in the aroma or flavor, of course - there are far too many hop astringencies and too much bitterness for it to shine through there. But you can feel it after a full bomber (particularly when that bomber follows two full Sierra Nevada Celebration bombers - note, do not attempt at home), and that's enough to lend a word of caution. That being said, I can't say I was blown away by this beer. There were some expectations going in to it, true; but this one seemed to be a little less enjoyable than indeed either of its three individual component beers are, and that's saying something. I'd take a fresh Double Bastard (for sure), an Oaked Arrogant Bastard (likely), or a plain ol' Arrogant Bastard (maybe) over this, and that suggests that maybe something else needs to be done to make these beers "special" (not that they need to be made special - they're all stellar on their own).

Smell: nicely dry hopped - pine breezed through at the pour then became quite resiny and a little tropical, a whiff of the oaked and a whiff of alcohol, brown sugar and bready bringing up the back. Taste: mildly pine needly fading into sweetened citrus with some faint melon thrown in, caramel and intensely toasted (and a slight oaked contribution at this point in the sip) with a peppery finish. The carbonation seems a little more intense in this version or maybe it's because my tastebuds are being peeled off. Yes, it's quite good. 2010.","babaracas","Dec 01, 2010"

Aroma is full of dark nearly burn sugars with a hint of Oaked Arrogant Bastard, with the citrus pine ridden hop tones found in the Double Bastard definitely looks more like the traditional Bastard. This was an awesome idea to blend all three to make something better than any of it's parts. Spicy citrus dark brown sugar malts hints of pine cones, hoppy but balanced. A touch of oak well hidden, alcohol within the flavor spectrum this is how the Bastard is meant to be. This is more of what I remember the early days of Arrogant Bastard meant to me back in 2001 was my first experience. Harsh abrasive but fruit pine and citrus hops balance it out with darker caramelized hops I think they have found the right balance with this Cuvee de Bastard. Smooth drinking mouthfeel medium to full bodied natural easy going carbonaton this body is oily with some resins. Drinkability overall is excellent very easy to drain a 22 ounce bottle but becareful the alcohol by volume will hit you at 9.2% abv, keep trying beers in order to come across this type of an experience.","WVbeergeek","Dec 01, 2010"

The caramel malt brings a good, somewhat complex richness like Double. And the oaked qualities do a good job of tying it all together. Usually, I think Double is too rich, regular is not balanced, and oaked is only good for its oaky goodness.

Nice angry first bite lots of flavors and depth, very citrusy and hoppy off the first sip with obvious grapefruit flavors in the end. There is nice dark fruit flavors, but I can't distinguish them... it's cherry or plum. Some more flavors I pick out are vanilla and oak flavors, a hint of lemon essence.

I'm a big fan of blending and hope that more brewers explore the process, but every blended beer isn't a masterpiece. This beer has a bit too much of the raw and rough flavors of fresh DB for my tastes. There's a relatively strong booze-acetone note in the aroma that drowns out some of the complexity. There are also some very nice notes of caramel and aggressive pine/grapefruit rind hops. Taste-wise, it's quite successful. There's a wonderfully bitter pine resin/citrus pith tone on top of layers of caramel malt sweetness. The finish is a bit astringent at first, but that's more of a palate issue. Some very nice flavors coat the mouth and linger. Also, the beer is quite pretty - darkened reddish amber with a thick ecru head. Lucky Bastard is a wonderful expression of Stone's influential viewpoint in American craft beer.","popery","Nov 24, 2010"

The flavor is similar with massive piney and citrusy hop notes upfront, along with some grapefruit, orange jam, caramel, toffee, oak and vanilla, fruity esters, toasted bread and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the thick side and drinkability is pretty good despite the hop onslaught and ABV.

As odd as it may sound (I know it did to me), it comes together nicely enough. The taste blasts the tongue with hops, mostly traipsing in with spicy, onion-y notes. A cowering puddle of caramel lies dejected in the back. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a thick feel, and a dry finish. Overall, I think this thing is a bit much.
