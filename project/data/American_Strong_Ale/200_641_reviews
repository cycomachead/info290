review_text
"Pours a clear deep reddish amber producing 2 fingers of soap foam frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head that leaves a only a little lacing. Aroma is sweet with toasted malts, treacle, nuts & a hint of raisin backed a thin hint of floral hops. Taste is sweet but less so than in the nose, caramel, roast, nuts & raisin. Finish is toast, roast & metallic with some hop character in the form of a nice bitterness that's accentuated by the alcohol & intense roast. Aftertaste is metallic, lightly bitter & astringent. Alcohol presence is low for the ABV but is present in the form of bitterness and spice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, some spicy prickle, wet, slick & astringent in the aftertaste."
" And of course the 8.0 ABV doesn't hurt either !!"

"Keg of eyeofthehawk beer drank."
"This beer is goes so well with cheese and crackers."
"Poured cold from bottle to pub style pint glass. Color is a dark reddish Amber. Has about a one inch head of white foam that seems to be sticking around (I'm drinking it while reviewing). Strong taste of malt and caramel. I got this beer as part of a build your own six pack at the liquor store. I love to try new beers, and hadn't heard of this one, so I thought, for $1.60 it can't hurt to try it. It was money well spent. I am enjoying this beer, and would drink it again any time. Can't believe it's 8% AVB!"

"a little slippery, a little better, but it's good. I could drink 4 of these."
"An old friend from when I lived in Mendocino/ Humboldt. This has a very thick mouth feel and hides its alcohol well. A very malty, caramel-like taste that is quite unique. I love it's color."
"Simply delicious beer.  Fantastic overall."
""
"No bottle date so rated as it tasted... which was like a 6 month old IPA."

"Not to sure what to say about this one. Not a top choice to buy again, but wouldn't turn it down"
"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on January 21, 2015."
"Very strong malt flavor some hops to back it up but overall very malt forward. Lots of caramel and bready/ biscuit notes . Very full bodied beer much richer than I would anticipate based on the color."
"A very good golden ale!"

"Eye of the Hawk pours a red-brown with a big two-finger head which dissipates quickly leaving a thin white cap.  Not a whole bunch going on in the flavor department.  A quite strong caramel/malt flavor which masks the high ABV quite well.  Almost a  medicinal malt flavor.  Aroma is strongly malt based.  Not a well balanced malt flavor but not bad.  I first tried it at the 2011 Minnesota Autumn Brew Review.  The brewery rep gave my uncle and I a bottle under the table and was quite personable. Left a good impression of Mendicino Brewing for me.  I'd drink this again and would be interested in trying some more of their offerings."

"Flavorful, but not real balanced."
"This is a very decent brew. With the hefty 8% abv that isn’t detectable. The light mouthfeel is a throw off of some of the flavors that shine through. This reminds me of what a candy beer would be. Almost like a medicinal fruit syrup followed by bready malt and slight hoppy finish. Though nothing screams excellence, this brew is still worthy."
""
"Price Point - $2.25/12 oz bottle"
""
"Overall pretty good, kind of flat though, a little more carbonation would have brought me up to a 4. A little too sweet and boozy for me to go any higher than that, but still a good beer."
"Pours a cloudy orangey-red with a creamier white head that has minor retention but leaves a little lacing. The aroma is mild, with only some nondescript malt sweetness. The taste has a little more oomph, as there are some nice dark fruit notes and dark bread malt flavors. The body has a nice weight to it, with a smooth finish."

"Malt dominant, and not the most complex strong ale, but it's got enough citrus and bittering hops to redeem it somewhat."
""
""
"I really liked the taste when it first hits your mouth. There was a hint of something metallic in the aftertaste, but like an earthy metallic, not like an old tin can. The aftertaste kept me from giving this beer a higher rating, but overall, I really enjoyed it. I will keep some at home. This would go well with any foods cooked on the grill, especially a good burger."

"I would recommend this to a friend. Also a great recommendation to anyone looking for a nice, hoppy beer or one with an above average alcohol content."
""
"It pours dark amber and cloudy like a thunderstorm, with lacings and an off white foamy head, that dissapates well. It has a caramal malt aroma, a pleasent taste of caramal/malt, with a twinge of metal taste and spikes of hops and pie crusts. It has bit of an edge when drink, but goes down well, and isn't to feeling."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is bready in the feel, not too thick but with a combination of ""moist," sweet and dry that works well in its medium body."
""
"The Eye of the Hawk is much better than I anticipated. The beer poured a slightly a hazy copper with thin white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is sweet with biscuit like malt. The taste is a well balanced strong ale like semi sweet bread. The mouthfeel is fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall....possibly one of the better strong ales I've had...given that I am not a strong ale fan."
"O - 4 - It's nothing amazing, I just can't find anything that's really wrong with it. It's got a nice sweet/creamy taste from the malt, which is almost perfectly balanced by the hops, there's just not much complexity. I guess that's what it is: It's a very simple american strong ale that's light on the hops. I honestly kinda like it, and would probably buy it again, especially for the price:ABV ratio."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite the let down. Threw a few Eye of the Hawks into a make your own 6 pack from my local, and I could not finish the first one and poured out the remaining two. Tasted like soap at times and even my wife agreed it was not worth drinking. I love almost any craft beer, and am enjoying a Mt. Saint Helena Palisades Pale Ale right now, so I am not sure what went wrong with the Eye of the Hawk, it seemed to have a bland taste with no distinctive aroma whatsoever, and the occasional aforementioned soap taste."

"If they packaged this in a bigger bottle and put a fancy cork and label on it, BA would rate it world class."

"Reasonably good tasting high alcohol content Ale. No heavy hops bitterness found in IPAs to cover up the extra alcohol content. For really good flavor, best to go to the brewery and get a growler of "" Red Eye"" once offered as a blend they can fill your growler half and half with Red Tail Ale and Eye of the Hawk."
"O: This is one of my goto beers. I can get a 6 pack for around $8 and it taste delicious. This beer has opened the minds of many of my non craft beer drinking friends. I cant recommend this beer enough."
""
""
""
"O-good flavors int this beer, has flavors that remind me of an good scotch ale"
""
""
""
"Pretty decent ale, hides its strength well, but the flavor doesn't live up to the aroma. Definitely worth trying if you don't have to pay too much for it. Not my favorite but I'm enjoying it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. It's a little on the sweet side of being balanced, with just enough hops to keep it honest. The high alcohol content is well hidden beneath the flavor."

"visiting boulder, colorado so this beer has some competition. This brew poured nice with an amber/gold hue and with a nice head that lasted pretty long. smell wasn't all that great but def smelled of malt. taste was a good combo of sweet and bitter. and mouthfeel was excellent for the abv. overall it is a good beer and def look foreword to drinking this 12pack with good friends, cheers!"
""
"Appearance is a hazy nice burnt sienna(orange)color. Smell is of malt and hop balance ""eye"" or center of the malt/hop/wheat flavor profile, decent lacing.Taste-malt and dark chocolate with apricots, wheat and bitey hop at the finish. Orange peel, dank, complexity is there..medium to heavy mouthfeel. For this, I feel Summer Strong ale. salmon or corn chowder, or blue-cheese burgers."
""
"Alright, here we go strong ale. Appearance is a solid amber color. It smells of apricots and some hops. Tastes alcoholic, but sweet and nutty. For the ABV, I think it's worth is. I think it's a little unbalanced seeing as it lacks a stronger hop flavor and aroma, but overall it's a good buy. Maybe this is why the stock hasn't skyrocketed in the past couple of years."

"wonderful taste on the third bottle. I can't bring myself to write that the smell is particularly great, and yes the first bottle is metallic. but who cares, this is a sublime beer, and in the department all of us care about (I don't care how many fingers of head a beer has) this one tastes great on the last bottle, which for me, is three at 8% ABV."

"Pretty much what I was expecting. This could use some more hoppiness, or if it were an old ale or barleywine, some more oomph to the malts."
""
"This is my go to beer. Its easy to find, affordable, good abv and a good body and taste to it. This ranks up in my top 3 with Founders and Commodore Perry. Its hoppy, slightly bitter with a very med body. I rate this high because i consume it weekly but i really do recommend trying it if you have not. I have begun to find it in more and more supermarkets and party stores which means it is easy to find and affordable. As long as it does not get bought out by Anheuser i see a good future for this beer."

"O: Better than I remember (sampled before BA), but still not my favorite. Interesting profile and idea but the outcome is a bit rough."

"What I found most impressive was how well it paired with spicy, sweet Chinese food. A nice surprise/happy accident. A bit too much ABV though, two is enough for the night."

"Something tells me a crappy Survivor cover band tried to make their own mark with this diddy...and failed... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery caramel, biscuit, light cinnamon, and a vague sense of very mild grass. The taste holds notes of orange peel, caramel, lightly-toasted biscuit, and a touch of fennel. Things seem limp, uninspired (whatever that friggin' means...). The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a weak little beer, one that lacks any discernible character worth paying attention to."
"Feels a little sticky sweet as goes the style. Definitely a sippy beer. Nice."
"Eye of the Hawk American Strong Ale, or ""Hawks"" as me and my buddies like to call it, is an instant classic. My first experience with this beer was at a social occasion where after taking a few sips, I realized I was drinking something special. It was a huge surprise to see printed on the side of the bottle 8% alcohol. This is a strong ale with a sturdy mouthfeel, and an appropriate and sippable bitterness you would expect from this style. Crisp, clean, and refreshing, with the alcohol content of malt liquor, whats not to like? Overall its just one of those beers that you're happy to drink any time, any place, without getting too fancy or stealing the spotlight. The best thing about this beer though, by far, is the value. $6.50 for a 6 pack at Trader Joes. YES! Overall just a great beer that is a refreshing change from the hophead trend, with great value and flavor that keeps you interested without overdoing it."
""
""
"My pour provided me with a thick finger of dense, tawny head with decent retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose smelled like a Sugar Daddy bar - very caramel! Mouthfeel was medium, kind of prickly in its carbonation and the heat was immediate. Phew! Once I got past that, the caramel sweetness was about as much as I could handle. Dang, but this was making me sweat. Finish was semi-sweet as the yeast had converted much of the sugar into alcohol. Wow! And to think that we used to swig this like water ..."

"Nice medium to heavy bodied beer, very sweet in taste, but also very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: A very good, complex beer. Deceptively drinkable at 8% ABV, so watch out!"

"Overall : Incredible, has to be tasted to be believed. A beautiful beer, plain, boozy and bold. For the brave only, as it will knock your socks off after 2 bottles."

"This was a welcomed surprise and one of the more enjoyable bird beers from Mendocino."
""
"Overall - Mendocino's flagship beer, and it's a great one. Strong, assertive and a completely American ale. Beautiful complexity. I've been drinking this beer for years, and it never disappoints. Sometimes comes with a touch more metallic taste than tonight, Not one for sessions; drink with caution."
"O - This stuff is incredibly drinkable and loaded with flavour for the style. An unsuspecting gem that is highly recommended and I'm super stoked I got the opportunity to try it out."
""
""
""
"O: This 'American Strong' is boardering on a DIPA... and I like it."
""
"Tons of heavy caramel malt, mild bitterness for balance, a bit of sweetness (probably due to high ABV) but very palatable. Fantastic stuff, one of my go-to beers. Apollo bittering, Cascade flavoring, Saaz aromatics. Like Red Tail Ale's big brother!!"
"Boozy as hell. Always at Trader Joes for seven dollars. How can I not like this? It tastes like very strong, pretty damn good beer. Um..also it's brown, nice lacing and smells like alcoholic candy. When I'm in the mood for some fancy strong Belgian business but don't want to drop ten bucks on less than a liter this is a fine fine option."

"A surprisingly light, but full bodied ale that reminds me of a good wheat brew with more OOMPH. Buttery, slightly fruity, with a floral aftertaste. The head on this brew is THICK and lasts quite a while. I prefer IPAs, but this might replace Lagunitas IPA as my go-to, everyday beer. Yum."
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium-to-thick body. Surprisingly dry finish leaving me with a residual hoppy bitterness and a touch of toasted malt."
""
"The beer is a mix of a Barley Wine and and an Old Ale with that caramelly malty flavour found in Dopplebocks. The nose is lovely hops mixed in with a deep burnt sugar note. I found the beer fairly complex but very drinkable. The sweetness in the finish was probably about right and never interfered with the next sip. Great beer that is very under the radar for Today's Craft drinker"

"A distinct and clear old ale character comes through that is tempered by a hit of hops and a dallop of barley."

""
""
"Overall: a very weird beer. I could see myself growing into it, but it tastes nothing like its ""strong ale"" label would suggest. I do kind of like it, though."
""
""
"-Overall 4.0: Excellent ale. This beer has a relatively high ABV (8%), but it is unnoticeable. This would make a fantastic session beer and is just an all around very dependable ale. Recommended."
"This is an alright beer. It's not great. It's a little unbalanced. It's like a sweet, caramelly amber ale that has been intensely hopped. I probably won't have this one again."
"Overall: This is a strange American Strong Ale for me. It's lighter, thinner, and less-bodied than most of the same substyle. But it comes with a taste that is amazing and thanks to this taste, the entire brew is propelled into -worth the purchase- status. It's sense of hoppiness while still retaining an orange/semi-malty/inviting appeal is very prominent, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know what a GOOD -Strong Ale- tastes like from an American microbrewery. A- !!"
""
""
""
"Overall - When I drink a Strong Ale I expect DARK colors, hefty body, and a hops profile that kicks you in the teeth. This is mellow and flavorful. Not true to the style but a good Ale. It doesn't taste like an 8% brew, but its still good."
""
""
"Though not the most visually appealing brew, the taste, alcohol content, and cost more than make up for the lack of aesthetic pleasantry. As far as I'm concerned, the yeastiness seems to be the most apparent aspect of this beer. I have no idea which strain was used to make this beer, but it must be fairly unique because I can't recall having any other beer which is even remotely similar. Some may find it overpowering, but I find it intriguing; when you couple this with the price, it's hard suggest against at least a sampling."
""
"Has a bready, balanced flavor with a good mix of a little hop presence thats followed by just enough maltiness to level it off. Not very complex but that can be a good thing. This is an easy beer to drink down but you need to watch it with an ABV of 8%! Its a great example of a classic, strong American ale which is exactly what I was expecting. As i made my way through the glass I detected just a hint of citrus which added to the enjoyment. Good beer. Not much else to say."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty/grainy with some slight corn aromas. Taste is of malt/grain and some fruity and citrus zest flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing too memorable."

"O: This is something I could use as NyQuil because it could put me to sleep without me even planning on it. This was my first tasting from this brewery and if their other brews are just as nice as this one then I will pick up other from them when I see them. The taste and price makes it possible for a special occasion, but it could be used for just another night drinking though."

"The smell was odd, I had half expected a strong IPA and not a Strong ale, but that was no bother. Lots of hoppy tones, pine and citrus but the biggest players were by far caramel and a burnt sugary almost molasses like aroma.;l, also deppicted some earthy tree bark type aroma. The taste followed suit, earthy caramel tones with a definate hop presence and a sweetness that lay on the palate for a good long while. The feel was a little thin and slick, for the amount of flavor present"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some alcohol. Taste taste is also on the malty side, alcohol is present, some fruits as well. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a high quality and an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"If you like the Yards ""Beers of the Revolutions"" series you'll like this one."
""
""
"This beer seems to have some great potential to go further than what I am experiencing in my glass right now. My glass may be dirty and I'm sure that may be taking away from the flavor."
"Much better than I thought this would be, it is very similar to Great Lakes' Christmas Ale, though the finish and aftertaste are not as good as that beer. Of course, the similarlity is in one respect unsurprising, as they both are strong ales. Still, strong ales differ so much that the similarlities between the two are notable."
"Overall Drinkability - In terms of style perhaps this is an American Strong Ale, but it's much more mild than any of the others in the style I've had. Enjoyable nevertheless."
"Pretty good ASA. Special ordered a case of this for a customer who gifted me a bottle so I could try it and offer suggestions for other beers based on this. I’m certainly thankful for the chance to try a new beer and it’s pretty good stuff overall, especially for the price."
"O- Pretty good beer. Surprisingly easy to drink, but b/c of the sweetness I wouldn't have too many of these in one sitting. This won't be a regular for me as I don't think its sold in NY, I've only seen it in a Total Wine in NJ. I would drink again and I look forward to the two bottles I have left."
"Overall my favorite is still Hibernation ale due to it being very hopped and aged. But this was a pretty sweet offering in a variety case. It was good."
"Huge malty sweetness hits your palate but is not overly brutal. Very drinkable and dangerously so. Could stand to be slightly more balanced in my book but it doesn't stop it from being tasty."
"O: Hard to put my finger on it. I like it enough but it's far from great. Has a bock feel to it with the malty boozy ascepts. Would never buy all six but as long as trader joe's allows us to break six packs I'll keep picking up bottles at $1.25 for a malt and booze craving."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but I wish that more had been made of the dark fruit present in the nose."
"O: Better than what I had expected, but my small pour was enough."
"I can't see much to recommend this, but it was on sale at my favorite San Diego beer store, Likicker's in OB for $2.99. At that price, just add a bottle of IPA for a cheap date."
"A good to great beer overall. I'd like to try it on tap sometime."
"Hazy orange with a dense, off-white head. Great retention, thick, streaky lacing. Citrus and grassy hop aroma, oranges, bready and fruity. Very rich and creamy in texture, medium bodied, quite fruity with moderate bitterness. A little bready with some alcohol warmth and flavour in the finish, along wit grassy hops. Caramel sweetness throughout. I enjoyed it and would purchase it again."
"Had a good oaky flavor...nice balance between the maltiness and the bitterness of the hops. A really good beer!"
"Overall: A good beer, but one that appears to be more of a high-alcoholic pale ale than a strong ale. The taste is nicely malty and fruity, but it needs more IBUs! I personally enjoy a higher hoppiness with stronger beers. However, it's worth a try, and definitely flavorful enough that it could become more regular in my fridge."
"Notes: Too strong, too sweet. Too Alcoholic. Combination of esthers & diacetyls remind me of vanilla extract and caramel apples. I would classify this as an Imperial English Pale Ale."
"O: Well balanced American strong ale. A nice sipping beer @ 8 % alcohol by volume, although you can’t tell it is 8%."
"Overall, I'd say this is a very good beer. My one complaint is the big starburst on the 6-pack screaming ""8% Alc./Vol."" If the main selling point if your beer is that it'll get you drunk quickly, then what does that say about the taste? It's a better beer than that."
"A very nice beer!"
"O: A good but not great beer. I did enjoy this and would buy it again."
"Let me be honest, I wanted to poke the eye out of the hawk as I was drinking it. There's no way that I would recommend this as a beer."
"This beer pours out as a golden yellow color with a light haze to it. The head was white and fizzled away within a few minutes. The smell was grainy and semi sweet. There wasn't much hop aroma. The taste was grainy too and didn't really have much going on in it. The mouthfeel was decent but this beer really isn't something I'd wanna have again."
"O - Just not that good of beer to me. I typically love American Strong Ales because of the diversity and range of beers that are included in the style, but this is one I'll likely not be seeking to have again. Average beer at best."
"Final thought - when the 12'er is $12 this is the best beer ever"
"CONCLUSION: A good beer but not mind-blowing in any way. The fact that this tastes bad when cold is a pretty negative characteristic to me. I like to drink my beer at around 50, but I think a good beer should be able to be enjoyed straight from the fridge or from the cupboard. Because of that I won't be buying this again and would not recommend it. But if you like interesting, heavily-hopped American brews then you should try this one."
"Overall: just not very impressive flavor profile for me. I could sit and just waft this beer and enjoy the scent without having to drink it. (I had to research this beer halfway through to see the style it was meant to be). This won't be a repeat beer for me, but still glad to have tried it."
"Notes: This is a well made ale with a well hidden 8%abv that can sneak up on you."
"T: I used to really like this beer. Now, I don't know. I feel like the biggest problem is that it doesn't taste that fresh. If it was fresh, the results may have been a little different. I'm getting a lot of bready malts here and a hint of grassy hops. The alcohol is pretty well hidden but there's just not that much going on here."
"Nothing to complain about, gets the job done, thick malt bill, plenty of hops, cheap and available. Kind of the middle ground between red tail ale and the Talon barleywine of theirs. Has that almost trademark Mendo taste going for it like all of their beers."
"Overall: I think this beer might be more of a really malty Amber Ale with not much hops presence. Solid beer! First beer I have tried from this brewery, I will try more of these beers!"
"I love the reviews coming in for this beer. I agree with the gent that also noticed the Dopplebock taste. I also agree with those who see this as Red Tail Ale with a little more *umph.* The fresh was strong and sort of unappealing yet appealing at the same time, but once aged it really gets you thinking. No clue why the aged bottle has sediment. You will definitely want to buy more of this just to fool around and experiment with. To my knowledge theres nothing that suggests aging, therefore the score I gave it was for the fresh bottle which was kinda unappealing due to its overpowering alcohol feel. If the review was for the aged i would have gave everything a 4.5. I'm looking forward to getting this again. Stay thirsty my friends."
"This is a decent malt ale. It pours light amber with a foamy, airy head. Maintains a rich and hoppy nose. Notes of caramel first, followed by malts, then Saazs hops dominate the finish. Somewhat chewy, with a biscuity character. Finish recalls a dopplebock. Easy to drink and I will again."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable malt ale. It's one of the best strong ales that doesn't rely on hops to give it character. I also served it at my wedding along with the other Mendocino brews."
"Poured gently for a 1-finger head, reduces to nothing, average lacing. Aroma of prunes, muscat grapes, all are faint. Taste of muscat grapes is strong on the tongue, malts are sweet and alcohol is hot. Overwhelming bitterness on the palate. Would be better with age but I wouldn't have the patience to age some."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Lots of good aromas and flavors. I think I'll check out some more beers by this company."
"This beer pours a clear, light copper with a thin tan head that fades quickly. The aroma hints at caramel with some dough and malt mixed in. It's flavor is mainly caramel with malt sweetness followed by hoppy bitterness in the finish. As it warms the sweetness diminishes and the bitterness increases, well balanced. The mouthfeel is a creamy medium and slightly warming. Eye Of The Hawk is a good beer and could be enjoyed 2 or 3 at a time. Recommended."
"D: This is a drinkable and well-balanced beer. It will probably please most beer enthusiasts and malt-lovers, but may disappoint those who seek higher levels of hoppiness. For a higher ABV beer, this one is dangerously drinkable. Watch out!"
"Clean this up, ramp up the hops, and stamp a date on your next neck and call me in the morning, Mendocino. Sorry I couldn't be more loyal. (But it's your fault, whore.)"
"Poured at 53 degrees. Good look, somewhat cloudy and reddish in color. Smell is less than average. Initial taste is a little hoppy for me. I expected that from an american ale though. mouthfeel and drinkability to me is less than average. A bit of a let-down considering the previous ratings. I can see how some might like this beer, but I prefer a sweeter/fuller beer."
"M, D - Medium-full bodied with balanced carbonation and good drinkability."
"Drinkability: the body and balance of this beer makes it go down quickly, however I find it a bit bland in its presence overall."
"Talk about a discount, check out the price."
"D-will never drink again"
"Poured into a pint glass and I am met with an orange copper colored ale with a foamy head that quickly...and I mean quickly dissolves. Tiny bubbles around the rim but not much else. The smell consists of slight malt, some floral and a little citrus. There is also alcohol in there as I breathed in deep, it was pretty sharp to the nose. The taste is very malty with an even maltier aftertaste. Not much else going on here though there is a slight alcohol finish which isn't masked very well. Mouthfeel is rather oily. I couldn't see myself putting more than one away at a sitting. I bought this from Trader Joe's as a single and maybe that has to factor into the overall grade here. I wanted to like this more but I just wasn't feeling it all....though I may try again under better stored conditions."
"D - Fairly drinkable, especially given the 8% APV. There is a bit of the taste of alcohol that makes itself known, but the complex yet fairly well balanced flavors that join it are very enjoyable."
"D: D is for drinkable. These are great for everything and go well with food and/or company. I could drink one in 5 minutes and love it, but this should be a sipping beer if you wish to retain coherence. Does the job, deliciously and economically. Buy on sale and don't look back."
"D:Not a beer I would drink on the regular, but would enjoy one another time."
"A pretty innocuous, and yet drinkable strong ale, even if the alcohol doesn't come across as seamlessly integrated. Nothing over the top, but just a straight-up, plain, and solid malt-friendly pop."
"I usually don't like heavy tasting bitter ales like this but this one has endeared itself to me. Mendocino is doing a good job!"
"Pours a very clear amber with a slight orange tint. About a half finger of marshmallow smooth head, decent carbonation, good lacing too. Aroma carries some caramel malt, some cinnamon, some slight hops, but nothing too robust or pungent. Flavor profile is very upfront. Bursting with malt and some sweetness, carbonation really works well in this. Some alcohol notes in the finish, which is long and bitter in a good way. There's a nice creamy texture to this beer, and a heavy sweetness which paired well with the hops. A little malt forward, but very good beer and usually very well priced, so worth keeping around your fridge for sure."
"Pours a cloudy golden-amber color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is honey, caramel, tropical fruits, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is interesting...initially I get faded hops, followed by a bit of fruitiness. Then I get some honey and malt profile. The flavors are all very faint...and not very impressive. I think the 8% alcohol is well-hidden though. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy with an okay bite at the end. Drinkability is fair."
"D- This beer hides the 8 pretty well. It's a good beer and at the price point is not a bad choice. Not the best in the style but it's still a decent option."
"The beer pours an orangish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of caramel malt and assorted citrus. The flavor is toffee and dark fruit. The beer doesn't really taste like it smells. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, but nothing special."
"D: For an 8% ABV beer, it should put out better than this. As it is, this is not something I would go out of my way to seek out again, although if someone went to their fridge and said ""what do you want, a Newcastle or an Eye of the Hawk?"" I would opt for this one. That is not saying much now is it?"
"Poured into tulip, pours a clear gold color with white head, some rention and lacing. Smell was strong of alcohol, some sweetness but mainly booze. Taste was strong of sweet malt and some sugar. Strong alcohol taste and warming sensation as it goes down, mouthfeel was pretty light given the booze. Overall not terrible but I won't be revisiting."
"too strong and bitter to make a session beer"
"Eye of the Hawk lacked flavor and feel, and left nothing memorable behind."
"The mouthfeel is pretty solid, nice and thick and bready which makes it slide down quite easily."
"drinkability has to be good, cause this is darn drinkable for an 8% beer - wow! sneaks up on you after a couple!"
"Taste is actually pretty smooth. The alcohol, deep malts and bitter finish combine for Mendocino's best beer for my tastebuds. Dark fruits come on in the middle and are spiked with a bit of brown bread yeastiness shortly thereafter. Sweet, but not overboard and has a medium body. Could use some creaminess and more integration of the flavors. Although this is an ASA, I do not think this would age well at all. Not bad overall, I could drink one of these every now and again."
"Could drink a couple of these. Fairly easy going down & pretty refreshing. Not bad."
"Poured into a pilsner glass, a darker brownish gold with a nice, rich head that leaves lacing down to the last drop. Fantastic smell, a bit of caramel with some fruits, but not overpowering at all. Strong, firm taste, a bit more than medium body but by far not heavy at all. ABV is 8%, but tastes like a very good 6% ABV! A bit of hops taste, but not bitter. An overall high quality beer that everyone should try, it is by far a cut above your average beers out there! Highly recommended."
"The drinkability is high despite the 8% abv. The only trace of alcohol is in the aftertaste. This is a good tasting beer."
"D: Quite easy to drink. Kind of an ale malt liquor but a better taste."
"Could I drink it? Yes. Would I choose to? Depending on the alternatives, probably not."
"It finishes far too sweet to my mind - although there's a dip of hop character pleading to get through, the rich sugary elements on the finish are too prominent. Not one of my favourite American Strongs."
"Drinkability: It's not very potent or complex, but it's smooth and refreshing. I will say they hide the alcohol very well."
"A lot going on with this beer, not sure I could enjoy downing many of these at a time."
"Superb mouthfeel. Just a plain wonderful brew. I pay about $10 a sixer for this where I live and it's worth every penny."
"I bought a mixed six pack of Mendocino beers and was very pleasantly surprised by this one. The pale, ipa and other beers are not as impressive as this one. Very good malt flavor and aroma. Color is a little light for an american strong but, in general, I liked this beer a lot and will get it next time i'm in that store."
"Pours a rusty orange, very slightly cloudy. Tannish head soon settles into a ring that leaves a stick. Sweet and floral on the nose, a bit of caramel. Also, a bit of 'murky' leafiness. Taste is toasty and sweet, with bold and fruity undertones that I can't quite pin down. Spicy finish, and definitely carbonated. I'd like to try this one again, because the price is decent and I couldn't quite grasp what this beer was.. but it was good."
"I dropped some William Larue Weller into this and it was excellent. I bet they could barrel age this and it would be great. Really reminded me of the Insanity I had earlier."
"Very solid beer."
"Tastes very sweet at first. No hop presence on the tongue, and not much maltiness. Has some black tea flavor I noticed. Overall A little too sweet and not enough hops or maltiness to back it up."
"D- A lil heavy after a few gulps. Starts out like a session beer but it needs to be respected. A good flavor overall and smooth as well."
"I'm a sucker for a good ASA and this one is no joke on the drinkability scale. It's 8% but I can drink these all night. The sweetness might get to some along with the somewhat prominent alcohol taste, but overall its extremely smooth and very delicious."
"Drinkability: A great beer! This brew is truly unique and is a pleasure to drink. Be warned, it hides its 8% ABV very well; you can barely taste the alcohol in it. Pick it up whenever you see it."
"This is surprisingly easy to drink, although I am definitely thrown by the classification. I would think I was drinking a glass of La Fin Du Monde if I didn't know any better. So does that mean I like it? Hell, for $7.49 a six pack of 8% beer, I like it a whole bunch."
"d: a decent beer that is worth a try; i think it could be more of everything to make it a great beer of a bit less on certain aspects to be a decent session beer; definitely worth try"
"Drinkability: Pretty good for an American Strong Ale, the alcohol is hard to notice and it goes down smooth. Not too complicated but a nice beer none the less."
"Seems I'm definitely ahead of the curve on this one."
"Overall not too impressed with this beer, nothing special about it."
"Taste i found the best, definetly complex if one sits down to elaborate beyond the grossly sweet-bitter transition. there's some burnt caramel, maybe like butterscotch, like the feel on the burnt layer of a creme brulee, not entirely sweet and with a very light bitter aftertaste. the mouthfeel's well bodied, definetly fullbodied and comes in strong at an 8%. hop taste lasts for a while reminding you of the beer you've just had. worthwhile, nice beer. First mendocino i've had so far and it's good."
"I was excited to see this beer was an American Strong Ale, but it lacks strength in everything except ABV. Even if this was regular amber, I wouldn't be impressed. Too bad, maybe this was a bad bottle. Unfortunately, I don't have a second to compare it, but I'd give it a go again because it seems like I'm not drinking the same beer as many other reviewers."
"This is one of my go to beers - for the price you can't beat it!"
"Drinkability: A slightly above average strong ale. I like the caramel taste, but nothing I would rush to get again. I could have a couple of this sweet and malty beer."
"M/D: Very sticky. Medium carbonation, light bodied. The taste is pretty complex and mixes well, making this fun to drink. A bit sweet for me, but I'd drink it again. Definitely good value for the price."
"Notes: Just another slightly above average beer from Mendocino. Nothing I have had from them really impresses me, but they aren't bad. They just don't have any really good qualities."
"This beer is really good, and very complex. The taste changes substantially from first sip to last."
"The mouthfeel is lighter than expected with light/medium carbonation. Not very drinkable for me though, it could have been a little more complex and balanced better."
"Good brew. My first from Mendocino."
"D: This is a nice beer, very sweet upfront which could detract from the drinkability for me, but overall, a beer I would have again."
"Won't be picking this one up again..."
"The overall impression is much like a mild barleywine that is a little young, and therefore needs to rest for a couple of months to calm some of the alcohol heat. Like I said, Mendocino did a good job setting the stage for this to be a success with the name and branding, but it just doesn't deliver."
"D: in my opinion, this is an unbalanced malt bomb which takes away drinkability points. It does come at a very reasonable price (6.99/6pk),however it is not something I can see myself drinking a lot of."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a small tan head. Smells sweet, strong aromas of toffee and Turkish coffee. Flavors are heavy on the sweet, caramely malts, insufficiently backed by whatever sort of hops it has. It tastes pretty good if I think of it as a winter warmer or non-sessionable, post-dinner ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium-plus in body, low in carbonation. Drinkability is poor. I really wish I hadn't been tempted by the 12 pack on sale. Not worth the $12.99 I paid. Hopefully it's just a freshness issue and this might taste better from the brewery."
"Well crafted solid drinking ale. Not great but solid."
"Drinkability: Very high, especially considering the robustness and complexity of this brew. I'm bummed this is my last one; this offering from Mendocino will definitely be on the list for the next beer run."
"Drinkability: Excellent...this is the type of beer that is very tasty and can warrant the drinking of a full six-pack in one evening. Also, the 8.0% alcohol is very sneaky...drinks more like a 6.5% ABV, although there's a slight warming from the alcohol after each sip. Very solid beer."
"The taste is a tad sharp, with lots of boozy soaked florals, some caramel flavors, a medium body, and just too much alcohol in the finish to be a crowd pleaser for me. The beer is very sweet, maybe a touch cloyingly so, with warming alcohol notes and just too much booziness too. This strong ale is a bit too sweet and a bit too full of the ABV for my tastes."
"T- Very malty taste to it. Fairly dry taste. I really can decipher anything else to it. Leave a tinglyness in the mouth. Not impressed, even if it's not bad. I just don't think that there's anything special about this beer."
"I rather like this beer. I would not want to make a session of this ale or drink probably more than two in one sitting, but I would not hesitate to pickup another 6er of this beer."
"Taste: Again a nutty flavor with a good amount of alcohol present. It does have a decent taste but nothing that is exceptional."
"the beer is very sessionable. fans of beers that are sweet but not over the top sweet should really enjoy this beer. the 8% abv is masked very well and i enjoy it."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours an orange-red color with a small, quickly disappearing off-white head, no lacing. Aroma is caramel malts, raisins, honey, and a touch of alcohol but kinda weak overall. Flavor is similar, caramel malts, a touch of grain, pear, alcohol, and a touch of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is fairly lively with a weird metallic/alcoholic finish, medium body. Not a bad beer but not great."
"I like this stuff and will certainly try it again. Nice brew."
"Good, also it has a good amount of hooch in it, which I like and admire. Sessionable and tastey and deadly. would drink again."
"This beer pours a clear deep amber color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma caramelized malt, candied apples, grapefruit, and citrus. This aroma has good complexity, and good intensity. But overall I like it, because it keeps me thinking. The taste is hoppier than the aroma. There is still considerable malt, but the hop bitterness and taste are thoroughly in charge. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with carbonation that I think is slightly too high for the style, but it doesn't really get in the way. Overall, this is a nice beer, but I hesitate to call it good."
"Drank pretty easy, nothing stellar here, but session worthy, & easily the best from these guys I've had in a long... time"
"Had this beer at the recommendation of a friend. I found it lacked much in the way of a nose. The alcohol was not all that well hidden and that made me not want to finish it. Hops were present but not particularly interesting or worthy of note. Very average beer"
"D: I could drink it all night...I could also drink water all night, I'd prefer this because of the buzz."
"Poured into a pint glass. Golden orange with a lot of small sediment floating around. Nice thick light beige head leaves a bit of lacing. Aroma is rather ESB-like, with cookie-ish malt and earthy hops. Not a lot of strength for an 8% beer. Flavor is pale and crystal malty with iced tea notes and a cookie sweetness that comes on mid-palate. Finish is watery and metallic. Thinnish body, a little astringent, very dry. Inoffensive but boring. Just about what you'd expect from a Mendocino beer."
"Eye of the Hawk from Mendocino Brewing Company pours a dark amber with a very small head. The smell is of bread and malts. Taste is pleasant with a nice combination of malts, caramel, and hops. A well balanced beer and not a hopbomb. I find this beer quite nice and I could sit down with a few."
"Only my first but easier to drink than any beer I have ever had with this high an ABV (8%). The high alcohol content is well masked in the complexity of the malt hop abundance and balance."
"Pours a filmy copper color with little head. The smell is a crisp fruity smell that is not too strong or not too weak. The taste is like the smell: fruity that is not too strong and not too weak. There is a little after taste, but nothing a true bear drinker would frown at. I could drink a good bit of this. Verdict: try it."
"Dangerous given the high % of alcohol and incredible drinkability."
"For this beer to have an 8.0% ABV, it is pretty smooth tasting. I poured this into a pint glass giving it a nice 1 inch head. The aroma isn't impressive; however, the taste makes up for it. The body is a clear cedar color. I caught a mild fruity taste and a malty overtone. I must say it is not a bad strong ale at all. I will likely drink this again. Pretty good."
"D - Fairly high. Goes down Easy and definitely not overpriced. Solid. But watch out for the 8% ABV."
" ~ Overall I like this brew. It offers allot of nice features I did not expect. Everything from the look to the taste."
"Overall impression: This is an odd beer - it is a bit generic in flavor despite the high abv. It is relatively drinkable, but its not interesting enough for me to seek out more."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Velvet smooth and creamy. Medium bodied and extremely light on the carbonation. Seems almost oily on the tongue, but doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. This is an extremely drinkable brew, even with the higher ABV. I'm not sure how they disguised the alcohol so well, but they did a good job of it. Judging from taste alone I would guess it's closer to 5%. I've yet to be disappointed with Mendocino, and will be recommending it to all my friends in the future!"
"Pours a cloudy brown color, very small almost unnoticeable head and no lacing. Medium body to it... no off tastes to be found, although nothing ""tasty"" about it either. Besides a hint of alcohol, it's hard to even classify what this tastes like, or what kind of beer style this even is. Goes down smooth and is pretty drinkable though. Really, it's just an odd beer... It's easy to drink for it's 8% ABV but I feel without a style category it's kind of lost out there in terms of taste and what to expect from it. Not bad, but hard to recommend."
"a 4 or 5 out of 10."
"I could drink a few of these, a well crafted big beer that is quite balanced."
"This poured a clear copper with tan head. It smelled like caramel and roasted barley malt, with bready yeast and copper hops. It tasted like copper hops with roasted barley and nutty malt, with some caramel and bready yeast. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice malty flavor that was fairly clean and hides the alcohol pretty well. It had good body too, and was quite easy to drink. It wasn't very unique, reminding me a lot of a doppelbock. But that's a style I really enjoy, and this one is a great value. Definitely enjoyable, even if it's not super exciting."
"D- A couple of these will have you on the floor if you aren't careful"
"D: This beer is good-tasting, smooth and goes down easy. ABV is disguised well."
"Drinkability: If you gave this below a B, I suggest you get your head checked. This is a perfect example of when malt and hops can pair perfectly with eachother. Not only is it balanced perfectly, but the alcohol content is hidden so well, you feel like your drinking a 5% ABV brew. So much to love about this beer, it's clever, dangerous, and bold enough to keep even the big beer lover coming back for more. I hear people saying this is too wet and it's not malty enough, but this is a ale guys, it's not supposed to be all malt. The hops are what keep this interesting and I will defintley be buying more of this in the future. Highly recommended!"
"Overall this is the best beer so far that I've picked up at Trader Joes. If your looking for good beer on a budget(and who isn't theese days?)you've gotta give this one a shot!"
"Overall: I get the feeling hopheads will complain this beer isn't hoppy enough, but those who appreciate more balanced beers should seek this one out. The flavors are really in harmony here. It's just too bad it's so thin... if they boosted the maltiness a bit this would be a killer beer. As is, it's definitely a great buy at its price (I scored a sixer for under $7) but it's not in the upper echelon."
"Drinkability: Worth a try. A reasonably well-balanced, cost effective American Strong Ale."
"D: Would have liked a little more body to complement the strong smell/taste. Something significant was forgotten when making this beer."
"Drinkability: This beer is too sweet for my taste. That, combined with the high alcohol, would not make it a good session beer for me."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite. This comes across as unbalanced, with a very present alcohol sweetness and warming, but no associated big malts or hops. It simply tastes like high ABV malt water. Disappointed."
"Still gives me that warm fuzzy feeling despite my lukewarm review."
"Bright amber with more red than brown, and a bubbly white head. Nice lacing. Crisp aroma of malt and strong Saaz hops. Clean malty taste that pops out of the glass. Nice blend of the Saaz bitter and Cascade citrus. Tastes a little like an ESB in that regard. Alcohol is well hidden. Very nice."
"pours a golden copper color with one finger head that dissipates but does not disappear. aroma is faint, apricot and grass. taste is sweet malt with an citrusy hoppy bite at the end. alcohol is up front, but not in the way. earthy type of aftertaste that lingers but is not unpleasant. mouthfeel is a little thin, but goes down easy for a higher alcohol brew."
"This is one kick ass beer. I just wish it was easier to find in Indianapolis area. This has become my ace in the hole. Hard to beat it for the price."
"Can't beleive how long it took me to give this stuff a try. Possibly my ideal malty session beer. Pours a rich golden with a nice beige head. The nose has big caramel malts, subtle hops and spicy yeasts. The taste is a superb blend of mellow citric hops, fruity malts and herbal yeasts. Creamy body drinks well. A very impressive beer."
"D - Less filling and although not remarkable it tastes good as well. Not great, but not bad considering the low price and high ABV. Once those things are considered, I will be having this one again."
"medium body, but with a syrupy quality. low carbonation but it's not sorely missed."
"The drink is on the full side of medium-bodied with sparse carbonation and a silky feel. Pretty drinkable."
"D: Not bad, but a little too bitter for my taste. perhaps the strong alcohol content over powers the rest of the flavors. I probably wouldn't reach for another six pack of it."
"The taste is very good, sweet caramel with strong hop flavor. It is very tangy. The mouthfeel is rich and medium bodied with good tartness. This is an easy drinker, pretty smooth."
"Avoid."
"Not a bad strong ale. Hard to say how it should be since it's a Strong Ale, and not really a specific style. It reminds me a bit of an Old Ale. Recommended."
"D: This one is tasty and certainly unique, but with such a pronounced hop/orange rind presence and an 8% abv, it's really not the first thing I'd reach for on a hot day."
"The flavor delivers what the nose suggests with a bready, softly toasty, and gently caramelish malt lightly garnished with yeasty fruitiness and skirted by earthy/floral hops. It's solidly bitter, and the alcohol is somewhat noticeable leaving it with an edge in the finish."
"Burnt orange color, some off white head. Slight floral aroma. Really malty, slight nutty & biscuity, but mostly sweet. Has a strong kicker bite to it that I didn't need and reduced drinkability for me. One of these was plenty for me. Just a little too sweet and strong tasting to keep me coming back."
"D: Does alright, as implied above. At a bigger 8%, it's not a swigger, but not too shabby. Worthy of another round."
"D- the rather bad taste makes me never want to try this again, but it wasnt terrible or anything and i had no trouble finishing it."
"Deep clear auburnish orange with a big lid of fairly creamy beige coloring. It comes through with good strength bringing caramel and toasted malts with some dark fruit and butterscotch. Herbal-spicy hops in moderation. It's not bad, kind of like a lightish barleywine, but it's not really complex either. Better than most Mendocino brews."
"Not one to normally turn down a good seasonal I quickly grabbed a sixer. Pours a medium dark bronze color with strong carbonation and a surprisingly ample head that leaves little lacing. Aroma is a sturdy mixture of slightly bitter hops and sweet malt, could be stronger. Slightly full mouthfeel with a biting finish. The flavor is questionable. I like a strong beer with lots of bite, but this one is on and off again with me. There is a dominant malt presence and an equally dominate hop presence that leads to a balance which is good but the high abv really tends to interfere. If this one gets too warm it really becomes tough to get down. Overall I did like this strong ale but I have to be ready for it and in the proper mood to thoroughly enjoy it."
"Overall: A decent effort but I will not be seeking this out again."
"This is a hefty brew. The amber color is medium dark like you would expect from this type of strong ale. The bottled version has very little head when poured into a cool glass, but it gives off a pleasant but subtle nose. The taste is good, with a mild sweetness on the palate followed by a mildly bitter finish, not especially hoppy for a strong ale. The best feature of this brew is a lovely mouthfeel, which is thick, smooth, and seems to expand gracefully in your mouth. This combination makes it a great beer to drink one glass slowly, but it's too heavy to go for more."
"This beer is a great deal - 6 bucks for a sixer. It's a good go-to beer when the wallet is a little thin."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a very foamy, lingering thick head on an amber body. Smell was definitely sweet, with some soft floral tones, both of which came through strong in the taste. Caramel also prevalent. Had a medium hop bitterness, but a mouth-coating aftertaste that just hung on really, really powerfully. Wasn't terrible, but it was mighty strong. Nice, except that aftertaste."
"D: Moderate drinkability."
"Not the best strong ale, but not exactly a disappointment either. Good and worth trying."
"Smells of piney hops and damp peat, feathering into carbonated hop oils. Taste was initially unimpressive but improved quickly. Butterscotch malt up front with nice roasted malt complexity in the finish, ever so slightly chewy and with a bit of hops. Feel and drinkability surprised me given the ABV, or I guess I should say, the ABV surprised me given the drinkability! I was half way through before I looked up, thinking I had an APA in my glass."
"D - Such a deceiving beer. Boasts flavors for session beers, yet has the alcohol presence to kick your butt."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish amber color with an off-white head that forms into a ring of lace. The aroma is very malty with some dark fruits and alcohol. The taste is pretty thick and syrupy with a big malty base with some hops coming through in the finish and a long warming sensation from the high ABV. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall, Eye of the Hawk is a pretty decent brew that is worth a shot."
"D - I could probably get through a few of these very easily. A little on the sweet side, and definitely a bit strong, it's still a flavorful and light enough beer to have a few of."
"Not a bad beer, not my favorite. If you like malty beers, you will probably like this one."
"Strong bready smell from the beer, which always pleases me. Very strong toffee notes with a sweet maltiness on the tongue. The carbonation is good - just right for my tastes. I've knocked half a point off the drinkability, but only because the relatively high ABV precludes this from being a session beer for me. Apart from that I find it to be an excellent beer."
"Drinkability is much higher than it should be for a 8% beer. You'll definitely feel the hit at the end of the beer. I was able to gulp the beer down without feeling any of the heavy-handness of the alcohol. Can easily see myself seeking out this beer to purchase and consume again."
"EDIT: maybe it's my experience or maybe they're getting better... this is better each time I try it."
"Finish is flat with that, that, that... taste again. Metallic dishwater in the back of the palate and nostrils. I use those terms in the friendliest way than can be used... because it's not a bad beer. Just doesn't seem like a very high quality one. One dimensional on-the-cheap malt bomb. I think an average home brewer could knock this thing out in their basement with one hop scooper tied behind their back."
"The taste is somewhat sweet and spicy-zesty with a light bitterness slowly becoming present. It has rather sweet caramelly, toasty bread with light yeast element, a hint of winey-fruitiness, and a full, but smooth, lightly spicy alcoholic warmth. It's really best on tap, but it doesn't go all that well with some foods."
"Great beer, I was very pleased with this one."
"No head at alland no lace. Bronze-orange. Sweet, fruity malt. Minimal hops. Sweet. Buttery malt. Alcohol. Again, where are the hops, they are missing. Slight bitterness finally in the finish. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Just OK...kinda plain unfortunately."
"Somber orange-brown effervescent body with a halo of white head, bald in the middle... not far off from the Belgians in appearance... somewhat blunted, fruity aroma--not sharp or round, but present... warms the mouth with effervescent movement in the teeth... the throat is treated last with a late simmer of warmth... solid, but not substantial in its style... quite sour--the alcohol is marked early by citrus--grapefruit; a bit gassy and more than a bit acidic--sticks in the teeth... quite immediate astringency. Not a compliment--to me or Mendocino-- that I drank my first of these in a pint glass, not recognizing (or realizing) it was a storng ale. In a researched session, the genre becomes clearer, and actually works within its suggested expectations."
"MF/D: It's a very tasty beer - smooth, slightly silky, and finishes almost like a brandy. Great colder weather brew, I'd stay away from it on days when it's warmer outside (like now, when I'm trying to put away 22oz when it's 80 degrees outside!)"
"The smell is fruity malty. When it hits your taste buds you get the malt first and malty second. It has has some hopiness that cuts though near the end. You are left with dry maltiness on the tongue. It is pretty decent brew not overly complex."
"The beer pours a solid copper amber color with fair head retention and virtually no lacing. On the nose this beer smells very sweet and malty. To no great surprise, flavors on the palate replicate the nose. This beer is excessivly sweet and malty with no noticeable underlying hoppy bitterness to hold up all that malt. The beer is only 8% abv, but yet it still tastes heavy and tiring to drink. This beer tastes like a simple, one dimensional, overly sweet amber. Extremely disappointing, espescially in light of what this beer once was and has now become. I doubt I will ever again buy anything from Mendocino brewing."
"D: Bit let down by this beer, I had high hopes for this style and won't give up on it but not really what I was expecting, but considering its ABV this beer is still surprisingly easy to drink."
"There was a good marriage of the alcohol malt and hops to give this beer a lot to think about. This was a good effort and definitely worth drinking again."
"Poured a dark gold, and had a small head that was just off white. initial smell was nice mix of floral hops and malty caramel scent. A litlle alcohol scent at a 8%AC but not over whelming. Initial taste i wasn't sure what to think. A little malty but some hops pop through, and the after taste was nice, not to sweet, and had a nice mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but certainly not the best."
"Pours a hazy, medium amber color with a solid, just off-white head. Aromas are mostly malt dominated, some caramel, toasty, bready notes; also some noticeable floral, piney hop aroma. On the palate, it is a richly layered malt bomb with tons of biscuity, crackerlike, raisiny and fruity flavors. Quite a dextrinous, sweet finish with very little coming from the hops to balance. Almost candylike and cloying. Certainly a brew I couldn't handle more than one of, and at 8%, no noticeable alcohol either."
"D - There's allot going on in this one! Pretty complex than the smell has you think. Very drinkable, and mighty tasty. Recommended."
"I haven't finished this bottle yet, but I know I will buy more. It's so drinkable I sort of wish the ABV weren't so high."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. An orange-amber color with a very small white head with short retention. The aroma was a mixture of caramel malt and some hops, possibly citrus, but nothing stood out. Pretty good flavor, mostly bitter and hoppy, with just a touch of sweetness. Average mouthfeel and carbonation, mostly dry, especially at the finish, and with a noticeable alcohol kick."
"Overall - I've had little success with Mendocino products. Maybe it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" beers, but I'm really not a fan. The Red Tail Ale is better than this one."
"This beer poured a nice copper color, like a new penny. Hardly any head or lacing on the way down, even with a vigorous pour. Its nose isn't very strong in my opinion, definite notes of malt and biscuits, maybe a little caramel, but nothing very prominent. Its taste is primarily malt with some slight coffee-caramel notes, very tasty and surprisingly bold. Mouthfeel is smooth, I prefer a little more carbonation, but don't get me wrong a very drinkable brew. For a $5.99 six-pack special at Binny's, this is a steal! Great beer, I will definitely try other brews from Mendocino Brewing Company."
"D: A very drinkable 8% ABV. Excellent beer and so smooth. A great companion to Red Tail Ale in the Mendocino arsenal."
"Very surprising taste. Great smell. Would recommend to friends as a ""nice vacation"" from their regular beer. Drinking in excessive amounts may get hard due to aftertaste. Wouldn't personally drink on a regular basis due to the rich elegant taste."
"Taste: caramel and other malts, seems a bit English with a bit of diacetyl, fruity esters, bready and yeasty. Hops are present only in a vague citric rind flavor. Medium bodied, syrupy and sweet, but finishes clean. At 8% the alcohol is decently hidden. To me it comes off as an EPA + more malt and abv."
"I feel bad because I want them to be good, but it just isnt. It's like a homebrewed pabst blue ribbon. Others may like it, I do not."
"this brew is a hidden gem, and the price makes it a winner!"
"Pours a crystal-clear copper hue with a weak one and half finger off-white head. Lots of crystal malts and toasted aroma, with a healthy backing of cirtusy american hops. The flavor starts with a bland two-row taste and progresses to light caramel and a hint of buscuit. The aftertaste holds some mild citric hop flavor and a moderate bitterness that manages to balance the mellow malt sweetness but you really have to search for the hops and the overall taste is sort of blah; especially for 8% ABV. The alcohol dries the palate and eliminates most residual sweetness without drying the mouthfeel too much but the alcohol character sticks out a bit too much considering the lack of malt and hop presence. Light-ish in body with medium-high carboantion- this beer drinks more like a boozed up amber ale. Good drinkability for the style despite the apparent ABV. A passable Strong ale at a good price, but easily forgotten among more memorable examples of the style."
"Man, this goes down well, and seems to be the best of the sampler pack and the best I've had so far from Mendocino."
"Pours a clear amber with very minimal head. Nose is like sugary malts. Thick with a syrup tone as well. Flavor is thick with a syrup quality as well. I guess that appeals to the feel as much as anything else. Pretty nice, though the alcohol is a bit much. And the thick syrup tones aren't really helping either. I wonder if this could smooth out over time."
"D -This beer goes down really smooth and the alcohol is very unnoticeable to me, I could down quite a few of these before getting in over my head. My buddy is out cold right now because of underestimating the abv of this beer. Good thing, because we got some funny pictures!!!"
"On the whole, this is a decent beer. I'm not a huge fan of beers with overly hoppy flavors, but I can still appreciate it on some level."
"A light, mostly clear, redding presentation in the glass. A really complex nose: tobacco and some vibrant floral/hoppy notes that get my juices flowing. The flavors: also complex, leading to a smarmy, slightly syrupy finish, and yet I cannot say no. Wunderbar!"
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, there are certainly more flavor stronger beers that I would prefer over this one. I dont think I would choose this beer again unless my choices were very limited."
"A good, interesting sample from a respectable brewing company... this strong American Ale delivers well, pouring a copper brown color with minimal head... smell is typical of a strong ale, with a caramel, butter nose pulling through with a slightly ""oil"" presence... taste was complete bread and butter flavors, with some light caramel and a nutty, grainy taste... nice robust flavor that was a pleasure to drink... good mouthfeel and easy drinkability for an 8% ABV... don't notice the alcohol so much... flavors of the brew tend to dominate the palate... good stuff... I really enjoyed this one... Recommended..."
"A very nice ale."
"I sadly didn't like this beer for some reason. The appearance was alright, your average amber in color. The aroma didn't impress me either and wasn't very appealing. The mouthfeel didn't do much for me, and I found the taste to be lacking in character. There was a strong finish to it, but I thought it overpowered any flavors lingering from the initial taste and there was too much carbonation. Definitely not my favorite choice for a Strong Ale, but others seem to like it."
"It's a lot busier than just the aroma would have one believe. And it's not really blended, in spite of the multi-tiered complexity. But it's one of those rare birds that can still be enjoyed in spite of a less than organized approach. And despite the ABV, which is warm and active on the palate and thereafter, it's never a chore to drink down. This is a solid brewery, and I think they took some chances in brewing this beer. For the most part, those chances work in their favor."
"D- mellow brew that nicely balanced and decently complex, solid offering."
"Final thoughts  Nice brew but a little out of balance. Could use a slightly stronger hop finish."
"I feel that I do like this beer, but it does not have sessionability. It is very sweet almost like a wine. It tastes very sweet which to me is not appealing in a beer, but somehow I like it."
"Drinkability  I like this ALE and would recommend to anyone looking for a great tasting beer. I could see sticking with this for an afternoon tailgating or a night out with friends. The only caveat is that I would need to remind myself that this is a strong ale as the Hawk will not say a thing."
"D - Its a pretty good beer its not my first choice from this brewer I'd pick up the Red Tail Ale before this but its worth a try."
"Finish is clean, perhaps something less than would be desired but overall its clean and unobtrusively strong. Solid, unremarkable ale."
"Good stiff ale with a heart. Mmm."
"Overall, I'm partial to the beer but it fits well in the style IMO and is really quite a shocker in terms of how drinkable it is, watch this one."
"Surprisingly not syrupy with mouth-filling, but never aggressive, carbonation. The alcohol is on the high side and I, unlike others, do find it detectable. Therefore drinkability is somewhat limited."
"D- Despite the somewhat high alcohol content this beer is amazingly drinkable. For a cheaper beer purchased from trader joes I think this brew is a home run."
"had on tap in a pint glass at, has a cloudy dark amber color to it. smells sweet and malty with only a slight hop aroma to it. tastes very smooth for the 8% abv and is medium-bodied. drinkability is good. paired very well with my club sandwhich i had with it for lunch."
"Brewed up in New York - 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date; served in my Sam Adams tulip. It pours lightly-hazed, medium amber, unfiltered?, with a two-finger, loose tan head that recedes fairly quickly, yet leaves moderate lacing. In the nose it is rich and malty, vinous, with molasses, dark fruits, green/citric hops in the back, and an aniseesque spiciness. The malts are pungent on the palate, imparting molasses, toasted, caramel, milk chocolate, and vinous notes. The spicy/grassy hops have to battle the malts for supremacy, and on the way contribute a medium bitterness, notes of green/leafiness, and sea salt. It has a medium to full body that is tingly at first, but becomes smooth, almost creamy. Overall an agreeable, easy-to-drink strong ale that delivers and nice interplay between the malts and hops."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an orange-copper color with a thick, bubbly, light brown-tan head. The taste has a fruity spiciness and a hint of alcohol, almost Belgian-esk. The taste is initially of a sweet maltyness that quickly transitions to bitter from a combination of the hopping and alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly mouth-stinging carbonation. Overall, this is a drinkable beer but not quaffable. The alcohol is fairly apparent, which takes away from the drinkability."
"Flavor was anything but balanced. This beer was far more malty than hoppy and had an unbalanced maltiness that I could characterize with flavor descriptions such as old coffee, pennies that you've sucked on for five to ten minutes, and some toffee. Eye of the Hawk had a very limited amount of hoppiness in its aftertaste. Mouthfeel was unremarkable, but due to its taste I would call this beer undrinkable. Most of mine went down the drain."
"Overall, I found it to be similar to a barley-wine, just with less of a bite."
"Peace off."
"22 oz bomber into pint glass. A: Hazy orange amber, a decent head that takes a minute to go down leaving a white caked on layer. S: Pleasant fruit--white grapes, bananas, citrus--with a solid pale malt character. Some floral hoppiness. T: Extremely refreshing, light character with a pleasant, only slightly bitter aftertaste. Along with the fruitiness there's a nice sweet caramel taste, alcohol nearly imperceptible until the finish. Very mild presence of hops, but still very well balanced. M: Slightly coarse, crisp, a tad thin. D: Holy crap, 8% abv?! I just now noticed that, I had no idea. There's a slight trace of alcohol on the finish but with it's light, refreshing character it's amazingly concealed. Especially good being that I only paid $3.50 for this bomber at a corner deli on Post and Hyde in San Francisco. I'll definitely be going back tomorrow to pick up two or three more. A really fantastic beer."
"Drinkability- Wow. After 2 of these, I'm feeling it. Just saw that it is 8%. Very drinkable, even quite quaffible. Medicino rarely disaapoints, and this brew is no exception."
"Very good, well-crafted brew, but sufficient on its own; I could not have more than one at a time, but will definitely be having more when I can get my hands on it."
"Aroma is strong and very malty, inviting a taste. Pours a dark amber-brown with a thick, light tan head. Flavor is strong and rich, very malty but with some hoppiness and bitterness, a bit of a smoky hint. It leaves a tingle on the tongue and just a little bitterness. Definitely a superior ale."
"A tasty and easy to drink strong ale with the 8% ABV mostly hidden, one of my favorites from Mendocino."
"Pours a rich copper/amber color with a thick, clumpy foam head. Plenty of lace decides to stick around as the beer recedes, which is always nice to see. The aroma is malty sweet, with a little bit of old shoe funk and some fruity esthers to boot. Also smells a bit earthy, with some grassy floral aroma in there as well. The taste is smooth and malty. Very subdued up front, the rich malts kick in midway through the taste, providing a noticeable caramel/vanilla flavor. A nice hop balance kicks in at the end, leaving a peppery aftertaste in the back of the mouth and throat. But the caramel flavoring rules the roost here for sure. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. A totally drinkable beer, this Eye of the Hawk. I would suggest giving it a go in the fall or winter, or even early spring, as it's not exactly a summer refreshener. But still, it's a tasty brew. I think this would go great with a bread pudding dessert, or entirely post-meal with a nice big cigar. Nicely done here by the gang at Mendocino."
"A dangerously drinkable brew for the high ABV. Tasty and complex in a way that brings English beers to mind. Flavor is unified and enjoyable. The ASA category normally makes me think of 'big' beers. This one is not."
"Nice nightcapper. Little too big for happy hour."
"Scott"
"D - A good tasting beer. My first of the style and I like the spicy hop flavor mixed with malt and dried fruit flavors. Reminds me of a good Belgian beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a light copper, forming a white 1/2 inch head. Light rings of lace along the glass. The aroma is mostly of malts, with a hint of alcohol. Not too complex. The taste is thick malts along with a slight amount of hop sweetness, and a hint of alcohol. A very interesting flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel. Enjoyable ale, but the abv. of 8% will keep this out the session range."
"Overall, this is a very pleasant unique taste in a strong ale. Very balanced and drinkable, with gutsy earthy flavors."
"I wasn't wowed by this beer, but I would drink it again if it was offered to me. If someone had this beer at a party I would happily drink one. I am glad I tried it but it won't be added to my beer rotation anytime soon."
"D - I enjoyed it more than the same offering from the New York brewery - didn't expect that at all. Very enjoyable."
"Part of an excellent sampler, purchased at the Blacksburg, VA Kroger"
"It's not a mess, but it's not clear where the brewer was going with this one. It is interesting. The flavor is its best trait, and that's where it really counts. But it was hard to put my finger on, having a kind of elusive quality. This is the first of a 6-pack...maybe it'll reveal itself over several more tastings."
"This was a much better beer than I was expecting."
"Heavy malt with citrus and caramel notes and a fairly strong alcohol presence that warms but does effect the taste negatively, bringing too much sweetness to the table. Mouthfeel is smooth and round. I like this beer the more I drink it but it isn't particularly interesting or wonderful enough to go looking for."
"Not what I was expecting at all."
"Slightly orangy tint to a yellow bodied beer with minute bubbles and almost no head. Malty scent with a little fruitiness. Mixed bag on the tongue. It's got indistinguishable malts as well as slightly fruity flavors and a bitter hop overtone. It's a little rough and sour for my liking. It goes down all right I suppose, but I doubt I'll be drinking this one again in the near future."
"Would never have guessed this beer was 8%."
"Mouthfeel is light for a strong ale which or me makes the drinkability high because it doesn't seem like you are drinking a 8% beer."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and balanced Strong Ale , especially for its ABV. Fair amount of malty complexity and quality. A welcome sight."
"Pours a copper amber with orange highlights. Clear with no murkiness.Short head that fades quickly to a thin cap. Aromas of sweet malt, peaches, and honey. Very light hops in the background. A little sweet. The taste is quite malty, but with a veneer of hop bitterness. Unfortunately the hops and malt are not very integrated but play against one another to some degree. The result is both a sweetness and an unsupported bitterness without enough depth. Not terrible, just a little unbalanced. The mouthfeel is slightly grainy, but the right weight. Pretty drinkable, but the balance could be a little better."
"Finally! We got a couple new brews in town. Not that I don't have some good choices always available, I just get a hankerin' now and again to try a new brew. So last night I blundered into this one. I'd had their Red Tail Amber Ale, and Blue Heron Pale Ale, and both were pretty decent, so I figured Eye of the Hawk would do nicely as well. Has a lovely floral hops aroma, but sampled from the bottle it's WAY too sweet. I should've let it breathe; my wife poured hers up and said it was indeed better in the glass. You'd think I'd know better by now. But the website calls it a ""coppery golden-amber"" color. When I looked at it, I saw a dull, sickly orangey hue that didn't look very appealing. Bleah. Better I didn't look. Now, the website also says it's bottle conditioned, so I'm gonna put a couple away and come back to it; maybe with time this beer will change my mind."
"Drinkability is ok, I'll have to give this another chance for a review. Because I remember this as a much more interesting beer. Either I got a bad bottle, or this has really gone downhill."
"Okay drinkability, not what I consider a standout of the style. The taste is okay but something about it keeps this from being really easy to put down, it might be the raw sugar flavors."
"Overall this is a very solid beer, great for wintertime, with a cigar or as dessert."
"Mouthfeel is good, kind of buttery, solid, and a little chewey. A good moderate body, the satisfaction delivered here makes up for the cheesey aspects of the taste. As to drinkability, it's better than I would have expected - drinkable is not bad, one would be tempted to drink more of this high-ABV stuff than would be good for you. All in all, an OK brew to enjoy once in a while, nothing to rave about, but an acceptable, well-crafted product. I'm glad my local store carries the Mendocino line - I llike the pale ale pretty well, but I wish the line included a true IPA. I'll continue to buy the stuff because occasionally when the price is right."
"Drinkability: not a bad brew, but this is not a session beer either. Didn't excite me or disappoint me, so pretty average in my book."
"Drinkability: This would be much more interesting if it had a bit more of what it has and a lot more of what it lack."
"Hazy copper/brown. Aroma: sweet malts. crisp and refreshing. Bottle Conditioning gives soft carbonation. Since I don't care for this style, I was actually impressed that I enjoyed this brew so much. Definitely a sipper for me though, for taste as much as alcohol content. I'm really starting to like this brewing company more and more each time I try thier stuff. I would take this over Arrogant Bastard by Stone any day! Carmel, fruit, and banana tastes."
"Although it's an American Strong ale, there are European, esp. English, influences - esp. in hop profile. And, although alcohol is noticeable, it is restrained. A nice ""sipping"" brew that is easy to more than ""sip""."
"Poured beer into tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer was a light amber with a nice bubbly head. I was surprised though that no aroma to speak of came from that head. maybe a little fruity. Slightly bitter taste with a bit of alcohol burn at the finish. Will not purchase again."
"Drinkability is perhaps its best attribute. Definitely a value for the high drinkability/ABV ratio."
"I got this 12 ounze bottle from a Mandeocino Mixed case. I poured it into a pint glass. Therer was 1 - 2 fingers of head which had super retention. Faster at first, but the head was never actually gone. The smell was sweet and hoppy. The color was a dark redish amber. The taste was bitter, but not overpowering. Very drinkable. Don't drink and review."
"On the plus side, I find myself drinking this rather quickly just trying to figure this thing out; after a couple of these, the ol' noggin starts to get a bit numb. :-)"
"Not bad really, and very different. Almost like a weak barleywine. I'd get it again if there were a sweet beer sale. Overall I think it needs more fullness with both the malts and the hops to fully fit the strong ale title. I think that would help the fruitiness to blend more, as well as the alcohol."
"The flavor sits on the tongue for a bit. Not too thick, but certainly not watery. Actually has a smooth, buttery feel. The high alcohol content is apparent, but doesn't detract from the fine flavor. Might be a bit much for a school night, but is an above-average beer."
"D - Very easy to drink. It is too strong to session, but I am really surprised how quickly I found the bottom of my glass. It is a bland hoppy flavor, so I imagine it would pair with food rather easily. It is not a terrible beer or anything, it just fails to impress all around the board. Well, except for this category."
"Taste: Yeasty, banana-like esters, which mixed with the very prevalent alcoholic buzz, it's almost like a pina colada. Some spicy hops in the tail end. This Beer is hard to pin down."
"there was almost no head. The nose was very mellow. And the color was a little strange. The first flavor detected was a metallic-coppery taste. mid palate got a little better with a hint of roasted almonds. The finish was bitter and was over quickly. I do like these guy's black&tan in 22oz.btl. Once again for being inexpensive high gravity beer you get what you pay for !!"
"Poured a rather light amber with a thin head that was quickly dissapating. Aroma was barely there, but what I could pick up was well balanced hops and malt. Taste is a little too on the malty side for my liking. If a beer is going to be higher in alcohol, I need enough hops along side them, and this one did not do it for me. This one was perculier to say the least, it was easy to drink, yet difficult. Smooth, but not. This almost seemed like a light barlywine. As is the case for me with most barlywines, it tastes good at first, but gets a little bit worse with each passing sip."
"This was good, but l wasn't blown away by it. Complex and worth visiting again. Perhaps Eye of the Hawk is one to grow on you."
"I like the brown sugar malt sweetness that precedes the hoppy finish, but the canned carrot vegetal notes are unwelcome. Not a bad ale, but this one is not for me."
"D- This is like drinking kool-aid so be careful. I'm glad I tried this one. I took a strong liking to it at my first taste."
"12 oz. bottle- color of honey , with a orange white head - nose of malty , caramel , red fruit , ginger , and slight hopps  taste of orange blossom , malts , caramel , and slight citrus  body medium , and slightly carbonated  aftertaste of orange , and hopps"
"D: I'd drink it if given to me (which it fortunately was), but I wouldn't buy it."
"Eye of the Hawk pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Nice aroma, some floral hop as well as malts are noticeable. Nice hop flavor, alcohol is a little noticeable to me. Has some bite to it. I couldn't drink a whole lot of these, but definitely not bad at all. Definitely worth a try."
"I'm really not sure I could have more than one of these at a time, maybe 2 if I really wanted a short evening. Tasty but strong."
"A highly drinkable, medium to heavy bodied Strong Ale that demands a bit of respect or else...definetely recommended, try it!"
"Poured dark amber, it poured a little cloudy but they may be due to the fact I missed the fact its bottle conditioned so I ended up with a lot of chunks in it. Smells like malt, a lot of it. Taste is carmel and malty sweetness, almost full body to it. I would definatly reccomend this."
"This is certainly not like a Belgian, but it plays in some intersections between that and other styles. The taste is mildly medicinal and bandage-like, with some baby animals presenting themselves. There's some alcohol in the air. Is this a baby Belgian animal who snuck into a camper's schnapps? Or, it could be compared to a veterinarian's office in which Irish whiskey is being served. I like it, but this is not an everyday drink."
"Overall a pleasure to drink and I am glad I picked up a 6er of this stuff as I will definately be enjoying another here soon! A must try for anyone liking a drinkable beer."
"drinkability: Not bad at all. Worth a look."
"This one was pretty good, if not a bit unexpected. Flavour and balance are pretty good for the most part. This is a decent Strong Ale."
"This pours a dark orange amber with a cloudy look to it and almost no head. The smell is very strong with malt,alcohol, and bread yeast. This smells like an ESB or barleywine. The taste is slightly metalic which is abit unpleasant, but the flavors include sweet malt, creamy toffee,alcohol,a small amount of dark fruits and hops. The m/f is medium and with a metalic taste the flavors don't quite mix well. This is a decent beer that sneaks up on you. Enjoy this one safely."
"Taste ? Like an English PA, malty, rich and smooth. On the sweet side, with notes of fruits and a winter spice finish. Full bodied, it might be tough to drink in the summer heat, but quick a pleasant cold weather sipper."
"Overall, this is a somewhat odd beer. Almost like a barleywine, without the complexity usually typical of that style. Despite the strong alcohol content, this is pretty drinkable brew. Not the best strong ale, but not bad either."
"It's hard to be so tough on this beer because there's nothing really wrong about it but there's nothing to recommend it either. What's most disappointing is the utter lack of character - it's just a plain old average ale that could have come from anywhere."
"D: Overall reasonably drinkable -- would buy again."
"Boy, this American strong is REALLY good!! Little hops on the back end. Very malty and the weird part is, you cannot even notice the way it goes down. One of the smoothest beers I've had the honor of tasting. Nice malty caramel smell and taste and drinks like an Oktoberfest. Highly recommended!"
"Slightly hazy, medium-dark copper with a very small off-white head that quickly diminishes to a very thin film. The smell is of moderate citrus, floral hops, sweet malts. Good balance. The taste is a bit more on the malty side. Caramel, brown sugar and bread, with yeast showing up toward the finish and some light citrus on the finish. It has a medium body, dry texture and moderate carbonation. This one is 8%?! You really cant tell. The good balance covers up that fact well. Nice beer, worth a try."
"The flavor was good with the balance toward the hoppy bitterness. A clean easy drinking ale."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but drinkability is high, considering the percentage. An enjoyable brew, but I've had better from Mendocino."
"Cheers2beers"
"After drinking sub-par beers all weekend, this tasted fabulous! Though not the perfect specimen of Strong Ales, It has a full flavor with a serious body, alcohol, and strength. Tastes big on malts that work toward caramel, toast, syrup, and dried fruits. Hops contribute a mild earthy, pine-ey flavors on top of solid bittering. The beer falls a little out of balance with the alcoholic heat--quite fusal under a moderat (not full) body. Flavors are solid, but body is shallow. Also lacks complexity and depth for style. Needs better melding and aging. Still, worth a shot."
"This beer is a light golden color with a touch of redness. Not much head. The smell is sorta like a spiced beer. I was dissapointed in the taste. There is a horrible bitterness that is just too much to overlook. The mouthfeel is revolting. If I ever get through this beer I will never have another one of these. Not the worst beer I have ever had but it sure ain't near the top."
"Poured a light to copper amber with only a fizzy foam to show for it. Only a few bubbles aminute trying to make a break for the surface is what I can call lacing for this beer. Smell is a dry hop bitter flower with some sweet and sour malts and a little alcohol. The flavor profile is liek a dry and bitter watermelon eventually lettign teh amber malts meld with a little alcoholic warmth at the finish."
"Nice beer...a potential headache maker...but really interesting with a lot going on in it."
"Overall this seems like the brewers priority was to make a bigger beer and not necessarily a better beer. I'll finish my sixer, but I don't think I will purchase again."
"I'd only call this drinkable if you have an attachment to the high abv. Alcohol isn't TOO apparant, but that doesn't make up for blandness. Seriously tastes like an under-syruped coke from Burger King, while being too syrupy at the same time (I know, it confuses me too). Avoid this one."
"Overall Impression: This is a rather big beer. With the initial maltiness, it almost tends towards an American Barleywine more than an IPA, but the hops are definitely there. Very good beer, and certainly better than some of the other Mendocino beers."
"Pours a copper/rust. I couldnt get more than about a half inch of head out of it. Smell is somewhat yeasty but not unpleasant. Taste is very lightly hoppy and almost sweet. Mouthfeel is full and moderately rich. Very drinkable for an 8% ABV. Happy that I got last six pack on the shelf but Ill be sure not to drink it all at once. i dont see this as being a great session beer but it should be a good kick-start or even a night cap. Paid $4.99 for a sixpack. A good bang for the buck."
"Sure this beer is drinkable; in fact it is too easy to drink for the style. I am not all that impressed. Strong Ale is a favorite style of mine but this offering bores me. I have no qualms drink it, I mean it tastes fine but like I said before, compared to kin this beer is a bit lame. But I am picky. Overall, it is a solid beer but forgettable. Maybe it would be a good introduction beer into the style? Nevertheless, I need to thank my Uncle Rick and Aunt Kathy for sending me this beer from NM. Thanks!"
"A very subdued version of the style. At 8% abv, the flavors are present, but very mild. A very drinkable Strong Ale that would serve as a great introduction to the style for those who haven't had the pleasure thus far."
"Brew pours to a copper color with a small head that did not have great retention but did leave slight amounts of lace of the top of the glass. The aromas are of malt and alcohol that are dominant. The noticeable taste is of alcohol along with malt flavors of caramel. Over all this is a good brew, very smooth with a surprisingly 8 % Abv. This is a very good brew, just need to watch your self with the high ABV as it does not drink like it!"
"Drinkability/notes: A quite pleasant example of the style. With the very well-concealed 8.0% ABV, it would be quite easy to overindulge."
"This beer poured a clear reddish/amber color with a small 1/4 inch head. Aroma was almost non-existent, just a sweet smell with a touch of alcohol. Taste was malty sweet with a little bit of hop flavor and a caramel-like finish. This beer was quite drinkable despite it's strength, which could be dangerous if you were having a few. All in all this beer tasted very average to me and I can't quite tell what Mendocino is trying to put forth here. I know it's been around for a long time, but is it a barleywine? A winter warmer/Old ale? Either way, it's tasty enough that I will drink it again in the future."
"Jen: I find this to be an extremely unique beer. It has a nice blend of caramel maltiness that is accompanied by a twinge of alcohol. It reminds me a a good barleywine without the syrupy texture. It is quite easy to drink and has a dry end with a soothing aftertaste that isn't overwhelming. For the $$, this is a definite ""try at least once"" where it may become a ""staple"" beer in our fridge."
"Overall, a pretty decent effort, but the sweetness is offputting. Not an attribute I expected from this beer."
"Hmmm. . . . an American Strong Ale? I guess this makes sense since it seemed to me a pretty weak IPA with an 8% ABV. With the new Pop the Cap law in place, I found this for $4 a bottle which wasn't too bad. Light on the hoppiness, nice amber color, higher than average carbonation. Didn't seem to strong but you can still feel it if you've had a few others beforehand. Not bad at all . . . just nothing too impressive."
"Orangey amber, head disapated rather fast and lacing was pretty nil. Strong malty aroam with alcohol notes. Strong malt profile, with some sweetness. Subtle hopping. Thick and creamy. Strong, kinda crept up on me. A decent beer but as with most Mendocino brews a bit unsatisfying. This is personally frustrating as I like that their beers have English leanings. Sadly they just don't quite get pull it off."
"Tastes good, not too pricey, high ABV and easy to find. Whats not to like?"
"12oz brown bottle brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY. This stuff is cheap up here! This poured a beautiful rich amber color with some insane carbonation. I saved a serious overflow with my amazing sucking powers. The head is fluffy/air and white. The smell is nice, sweet and fruity. The taste is nice and malty, the alcohol is there in taste though. This is yeasty and fruity. For the abv this is VERY drinkable. If you told me this was 8% alcohol i would not have believed you. Very drinkable."
"Overall- a nice sweet beer but the alcohol isn't hidden very well. A nice beer never the less."
"different levels to the mouthfeel, Dry towards the middle, slick at the end. I found myself looking forward to the next pull and the next beer. That = high drinkability to me. If you haven't dabbled in the Mendocino brewery yet give it a shot. Nothing floors me but they are all well worth the price and keep me coming back because they are well crafted and this is no exception."
"Not particularly my cup of tea, but a lot of unique and powerful flavors in this one, all vying for control. I would have liked a little restraint in the sweetness department."
"Pours a cloudy golden/amber color, some carbonation, nice little head, a nice bit of lacing afterwards. Scents of malt mostly with some fruity textures. I like the taste of this ASA, it's not like a Arrogant Bastard, but very nice. A little hoppy with a trace of alcohol and sweetness. Medium body. Very drinkable at the ABV, this is a different kind of ASA in my book. Would recommend if you get a chance to buy/try it."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and buttery but somewhat thinner in body. Very crisp, clean, and quenching for a strong ale. Worth a try, for sure, but not something I would go out of my way for again."
"I paid $5.99/six 12oz. bottles and for that price would purchase this beer again. It is not an outstanding creation, but for the money, it is a quality session beer if you want to get yourself into trouble."
"Opinion: Well, this beer is in the BJCP guidelines as an IIPA...specifically as a Stock Ale like Arrogant Bastard. Because of this, I really had my hopes up. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed with this beer because it is a very tasty brew; however, if you are expecting the Bastard, you will be disappointed. This beer is clean and subtly flavorful. It is more for those newer to the strong ales than a seasoned hop-head. This is still a good beer, and one that I am sure I will drink again."
"All in all and interesting brew that is worth a try, but nothing I'd come back to."
"Pours out an amber-orange color with a small head but many fine streaming bubbles. Sweet & malty aroma, with some grassy, woody hop notes. First taste is malty sweet, a tad syrupy, with a moderately round fruitiness. Hop bitterness is moderate to high but still balances on the low-side from the maltiness. Finishes pleasantly, with an emphasis on the malt. Thick bodied and a creamy texture. Not a bad beer, though not that interesting."
"This is not necessarily a bad beer, but it is a little boring."
"Pours a clear, deep amber color with a thick tan head that retains OK. The aroma has musty grainy malt notes (like an altbier) with sweet molasses and ripe fruit notes in the background. Flavor is very malty with only traces of hops...the malt profile is toasty, bready, fruity (apple and pear come to mind) and lightly caramelly. Alcohol beomces noticeable as the beer warms and it slightly too apparent. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but there isnt enough carbonation imho. Drinkability is average. A descent but mediocre beer, which is generally the case with Mendocino brews i've had."
" This is a full bodied, meat & potato's brew. Its heavy but surprisingly smooth and drinkable at 8% abv. Very nice!"
"Drinkability: A peculiar beer that I enjoyed, on balance; I'll need to try this again sometime as there was something a bit weird about this bottle"
"Golden copper body with a decent, light khaki head. Smells of sweet malt: strawberries, candy, caramal chews, red-tailed hawk retinas. Hay and lemongrass bitterness with a dash of pepper. Sugary biscuit malt flavors up front. Some veggies and fruit (strawberries) duel. Orange marmalade resinous hops. Bitter finish with lingering sweetness. Medium-bodied with a somewhat sticky feel. Dry in the finish. Not bad, but not arrogant enough for me."
"Pours a clear dark orange with a decent creamy light brown head that leaves good lacing in my glass. Fruity dark cherry and honey aromas. Bready, nutty, sweet honey-caramel and fruit flavors, full bodied with a kind of syrupy mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, finishes on the sweet side, not bad."
"This reminds me a little of Great Lake's Eliot Ness, though not as solid or complex. A very enjoyable beer that would probably pair well with a deli sandwich. Give this one a try."
"I enjoy this beer, although it's not one I could drink often. I think it's my first ""American Strong Ale", so I am not real familiar with the style, so this review is mainly whether I think it's a decent beer. And it is."
"poured an amber-copper color with slight haziness and puffy tan head. Smell was slightly sweet with alcoholic overtones. Taste was somewhat metallic (??) that disappeared as the beer did.Also tastes of malt with the 8% undertones. Left a bit of a dry taste in the mouth. One is enough."
"Full but not chewy or oily mouthfeel. Goes down too easy for a beer this strong."
"Kind of cool ""strong ale"" that alot of people out here in California seem to regard as a ""classic"" beer."
"The 8.0% ABV is well-hidden and mouthfeel is good."
"This is a pretty strong ale, but an easy drinking one as well. It could be more complex, but that is made up for with a certain smoothness."
"Last swigs: 8.0 % ABV hidden, apple malty. From a growler filled at the Saratoga NY brewery."
"Medium bodied, ok drinkability."
" The experienced is topped off with warming sensation of the 7% alcohol per volume that has had an incognito dispostion up to this point, offering no hint of its presence in the scent or the taste. Definitley worth a strong recommendation."
"I'd love to try this in a flight of strong ales. My gut feeling is that this would be an above average entry. Slightly more hoppy than I'm used to, but that fits into my preference anyway."
"A very clean amber beer with a big off white head. Has a light flowery aroma with a sweet malty background. The flavor has a sweet candy note that lands on the center of your tongue. Then the hops bite at the back of your throat and a bit of alcohol warms you on the finish."
"Bottle. Poors a bit ugly, massive blotchy head. Dissaponting, not much going on, tinny, hoppy and short, not what id consider and American Strong Ale. Man these Mendocino beers are all driving me insane, i was dissapointed every time, this was dull, especially for the style."
"Drinkability and Overall: Attempt number 1 of 4 at Mendocino for me, and I'm impressed already. This is a solid beer that is pretty unique to itself. Almost an Arrogant Bastard type kick to it. Will cellaring help this? I guess I'm going to find out. Try this beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a medium copper color with one finger of head that dies off rather quickly. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty and sweet. There is some caramel to it, and a touch of honey. The taste is also very sweet at first, with some more honey and white grape. The finish is nice and hoppy. The mouthfeel is decent, just a little grainy. The drinkability is good for an 8% brew though. Thanks to Chris (clvand0) for this brew!"
"Thanks to clvand0 for this one. It pours a ever so slightly golden amber color wtih a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer very well. The nose is big sweet raisin, caramel and alcohol. The strong ales are not my favorite creation, but I'm willing to keep giving them a chance. The flavor is nice. The sweetness is not cloying, like I am used to. The raisin and caramel are very nice together, its almost roastey, but not quite. The feel is thick and slightly creamy, almost velvety. This is a nice beer. The strong flavors are not offensive. Good show."
"whatever a bland beer for 8.0%"
"from the bottle poured a hazy, cloudy orange with off white head with some lacing. aroma, white bread, ginger, citrus, caramel, hops, malts, hints of alcohol. flavor, malts, sourness, hops,. dry mouthfeel, alcohol hints of caramel. this wasnt to bad of a beer."
"Overall Impression: The flat carbonation drug down scores a bit. The heavy hand also took some from drinkability. Beyond that, it has a great rich malt taste, mostly hidden alcohol and a big smooth hearty taste. Recommended!"
"Copper red color, proud off-white head, somewhat creamy in appearance. Alcohol and sweet carmel mals are evident in the nose. Taste is very rich and bready, big hop finish, alcohol accents the other flavors nicely. Very good, extremely drinkable, even with the higher ABV."
"Nice sweet maltiness with a well accented hop bitterness. Seems strong on first sip but warms and becomes much more enjoyable as you get through the glass. At first I did not think this would be as good as it got the more I drank it. Nice sweet malt aroma with very little head retention."
"Pours a see-through burnt umber with a moderate 1-finger off-white head which quickly dissipates. Not much lacing. Has a slightly sweet malty-smoothness up front which then sort of stays in the background, followed by a slight (less then you would probably expect from a strong ale) hop-bite and a hint of alcohol in the finish. Also something that doesnt taste quite right somewhere in there, kind of like a metallic taste. Not all that hearty, but an easy to drink strong ale. Sessionability only limited by the abv. Nothing spectacular out of the bottle, but I had it on tap at the brewery and it was excellent, like a totally different beer. Much more pleasant, fuller flavor and creaminess. I had it at the brewery first, and thats what prompted me to get a 6er. This is of course, a review of the bottled version, and as such gets mediocre marks. Though it is enjoyable, theres nothing all that special here and I cant see myself getting it again for quite awhile. It does have a great abv:price ratio though, averaging about $6/6-pack."
"Pours a clear amber color with ample beige head that quickly sizzles away to nothing. Extremely malty nose, sweet caramel, light spice, and big alcohol sharpness. Taste is similar, very malty with a noticable alcohol kick. Astringent and unbalanced. Needs more hops and less alcohol. The ale version of a malt liquor? Kind of hard to drink more than 1/2 a bottle."
"A fellow brewclub member gave me this one to try. Pours a light amber color with a medium head and good retention and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and sweet and has some apparent alcohol. The flavor is much the same as the aroma. Plenty of enjoyable malts and lots of raisin. Some other fruits as well and the alcohol warms a lot. A little hot. Full body. The alcohol diminishes the drinkability a bit."
"This poured out amber with a tall white head. Decent lacing was left around the glass as it was consumed. Aroma was malty sweet with a good amount of earthy hops in it. There were notes of smoke and a bit of fruit to it as well. The taste was similar with malt sweetness being big upfront before a balancing earthy hoppiness came through. Alcohol was present but didnt affect the taste negatively. Body is about medium. Drinkability was pretty good. This is a fairly solid beer that while not too exciting is still pretty enjoyable."
"This is fairly malty. I came into it thinking it was an American Pale Ale, and finding out that its a strong ale explains some things. There really werent the hops I was expecting. Theres some bitterness in the back, but its mostly malt and a little alcohol (well hidden) as it warms."
"Good beer. Give it a try."
"A small, frothy, dirty white head on a hazy, orange-amber beer. Kind of stinky: a little sweet barbershop and a little sour fruit. Front is hoppy bitter, peppery, spicy. Thick, sweet caramel malt in the middle with a fruity bitter, tobacco, alcohol, sourish finish. This is a nice, spicy hop ale with a thick, rich, malty core. Good."
"Overall an interesting beer, but not the best one you'll drink. Worth a try."
"This beer, with a large brown hawks head on the label, pours a pale orange color. Its relatively clear, has low carbonation, and presents a thin, wispy, white head. The aroma is considerably fruity.apricot, plum, raisins.all mixed with a thick alcohol aroma and caramel. The foretaste is moderately sweet, but not quite as much as Id expected from the smell. A moderate maltiness, mixed with a little grain makes the beer pleasantly drinkable. By the mid-taste, a spicy hop flavor sets in. The beer finishes on a fairly serious hop note. All in all, this is a solid and drinkable beer. Nothing particularly stands out as spectacular, but it certainly is enjoyable."
"Light golden with ruby hues, very clear and quiet with little noticeable activity in the carbonation department. With that said, just a fine sheen of head was present in the kings chalice, but in the end, nothing to speak of. Bouquet was made up of orange peel, fuzzy malt, and was almost overwhelmed by the alcohol. In the end, there was a nice malt flavor, but again, the pronounced alcohol seemed to do it in. Jammy, sticky mouthfeel that didnt impress, and was a little biting."
"A solid beer, one I hope to enjoy again."
"Eye of the Hawk is one of Mendocino's better offerings, at least of the few that I've had to date. Even though American Strong Ales aren't near the top of my favorite style list, I thought this one was pretty good."
"Pretty interesting beer, but just not complete. Very minimal head and appeared to have no lacing. The color was a deep golden amber. There was a good amount of bottom carbonation which is common with strong ales. Aroma was kind of weak and all I could pick up was a little sweet malt smell. As far as taste goes, there was a lot of different flavors coming together as soon as it hits your mouth, but it wasn't neccessarilly a good thing. The finish is very dry with a heavy grain presence. The high ABV is hidden very dangerously and I can imagine a few pints of this has caused some dillemas."
"The flavor was sweet with malt and a slight alcohol flavor and warming. The finish was nice and spicy with hops. The balance I thought was just right. A nice beer was a bit strong on the ABV side and you can feel it after one."
"This orange colored ale did not pour much of a head and is leaving a sticky residue down the pint. Smell is of lemons and alcohol. Taste is sweet malts, a little hop character and high alcohol. Not an overly complex beer and it does not hide the ABV well. Mouthfeel is fairly full. It is a fairly drinkable beer. I have paired this with Chili as i was thinking this was a PA or IPA. May be better the next time with another less spicy food."
"This beer poured an orangish copper color with a small light yellow head. The smell is of lots of toasted malts with caramel being most noticeable and then a huge hop strike hits my nose. The body looks and is medium in thickness. The flavors in this beer balance each other out well enough. There is a very sweet caramel taste up front followed by some spicy hops. The finish seems a bit weak but I notice some bitterness after I take a breath. This seems more like a british pale ale as opposed to an old ale imo. The alcohol is not noticeable at all in taste, I can't believe it's 8%! But it did knock me out for the night. All in all this is a beer worth trying but nothing to get too excited about."
"Drinkable? Yes, but only if you like an IPA, which I'm not a fan of."
"Saratoga Springs rendition...clear amber color, thinish pale yellow head that's down to a skim in 30 seconds. Dots for lace. Lightly malty aroma, a lot of brown sugar tone. Medium mouthfeel. Sugary start, lower carbonation lends a malty impression with slight intrusion of a lemon rind sense around the edges. Monolithic in flavor, similar beginning to end with an iced tea statement. Could have used a little more complexity for interest to me, but drinkable and hiding its alcohol content fairly well. No indications of building extreme sourness that I pick up from Saratoga Spa Red Tail Ale..."
"A nice surprise. Light copper colored, off-white head with good R&L. Aroma lets you know that something different is on the way. You can smell the big cherry and banana esters with the accompanying alcohol in the background. Caramel is huge. The spicy hops try to poke through the thick liquid, but don't. It is well-balanced though it leans towards the sweet side. Big bodied but that and the 8% somehow do not hinder the drinkability. Semi-reminiscent of Old Foghorn, but less alcohol flavor and much more rounded."
"12 ounce bottle. Purchased in TN. Watch out, the alcohol in this puppy will sneak up on you..."
"Very drinkable, just be sure you know it's an 8% brew."
"ng"
"Pours a clear orange with a one finger head that quickly drops to some ring lacing. Grapefruit and piney hops dominate the aroma. Alcohol burn is the initial sensation in the mouth, of this medium bodied and moderately carbonated ale. Caramel malt sweetness is the first impression on tasting, but bitter piney hops and alcohol quickly obliberate any semblance of malt balance here. Piney and floral hops run the show here, and there is also an earthy mustiness present in the background. Alcohol becomes a distraction toward the end, and is not at all hidden. Aftertaste is slightly astringent. Not really bad, but not one of my favorites."
"Char"
"I really think I would like this beer in its ideal state; its hoppiness, well-concealed ABV, and drinkability appeal to me. But as it is, I have to grade quite low. I'll re-review if I can find a better sample."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is plain. It has the scent of lots of pale malts and an elevated abv. . The taste is decent. It has a very malty flavor. It tastes of pale and carapils malts and a high abv. . The mouthfeel is suspect. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. The beer is an average drinker. It's not bad, but it's also not that great either."
"The label describes this beer as “rich, robust and complex, with a ton of flavor.” Almost. The beer is not at all complex; it’s MALT! HOPS! Done. However, it does deliver nicely on the rest of its promise. A very tasty, satisfying brew. Just watch out for the bite."
"Pours a two-fingered off-white head that goes slowly and leaves some of lace. Light amber color. Light-medium carbonation. Hoppy/malty nose. Starts hoppy, has a strange quick sweetness in the middle, finishes with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. Light to medium bodied."
"Feels very smooth, round and full bodied. Creamy and very thick. Excellent drinkability unless you are a real lightweight, however even seasoned beeradvocates should use a little caution so I guess it's right there in the middle, not quite a barleywine but a good brew as an introduction to one."
"A dark amber brew with nice head retention and good lace. The nose is very malty and hints of some spicy hops to help balance the malt. The flavor is fully malty and full with mild spice hopping to add to the sweetness of the malt. Good creamy mouthfeel with a decent finish. Good drinkability and enjoyable for the style."
"Amber brown color, small white foamy head. Aroma is malty, fruity and sweet. Full Bodied American Strong Ale. Very malty with a lot of malt sweetness. Hops are spciy. Rich taste smooth beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Afterttaste is slightly sweet."
"Overall: The word that comes to mind is 'lackluster'. I really had some high expectations because this is a 'special edition' type of beer. It was no better, in my opinion, than most amber ales."
"I’m pretty generous and optimistic, and try to review according to the standard of a style and not my personal whim. I am never capricious, and am open enough to have been charmed by styles I don't like, but this beer absolutely sucks."
"Nice looking bottle with a cool looking hawks head in profile. Pours a nice amber with a 1.5 finger thick foamy head. The aroma is not particularly strong, slightly sweetmaybe a hint of fruity. Smooth and richly malty, with sweetness in the finish, this is a very nice tasting beer with some good complexity. Very drinkable and an overall good beer which I look forward to tasting again."
"Color was a very orangy amber with a very small head that soon diappeared. No lacing at all. Smelt of sweet candyish malt. Taste was of sweet malt, with a mild hoppiness in the background. Mouthfeel was o.k., nothing to write home about. This is a very sweet, drinkable beer, and could probably lead someone to consume a lot of it and end up trashed."
"Drinkability  This is like drinking (highly alcoholic) candy. Well done."
"After all is said and done, this wasn't a bad experience. it was a decent BW. I have made a note to review a current bottle and will do so."
"Pours a deep orange with a real nice medium creamy,sticky head,aroma is deeply fruity with a slightly hop background.I realy like the maltiness of this beer also there is some alcohol notes that come thru in the finish.A whisky like taste stays in the mouth after each sip.Iam very impressed with this beer,very enjoyable."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth it was. I went back for a second and began to wonder why I was getting a bit wobbly near the end when I noted the ABV. This beer can really sneak up on you."
"I'm not sure that this ale fits into the barley wine style, but it's certainly a strong ale. It pours a dull amber color with a fading 1"" white head that settles to a thin coat. Not much sticky lace. There's an equal aroma of sweet malt, hops and alcohol. The fairly full malt reveals sweet caramel notes. Highly hopped with citrusy and spicy bitterness. Slightly astringent and strongly alcoholic. This is one powerfully flavored ale!"
"Nice to taste a strong American barley wine that does not have that sickly sweet dark caramel maltiness. I am going to find some more of these, and make sure that my initial positive response was not a fluke!"
"If I didnt read the beer style on the site, I would never have guessed this is a strong ale. The alcohol is so well hidden. It pours a dark orange/amber color with a medium white head that only hangs around for a few minutes and then fades away leaving just the slightest bit of lace. Bold floral hop aromas emerge from the glass followed by the scent of citrus peel. Theres virtually no alcohol aroma present at all. Theres a lovely bittersweet taste that intermixes with light carbonation to create a very well balanced mouthfeel. I swear, I could never taste the alcohol. But watch out itll sneak up on you quick and before you realize itBAM! A sucker-punch come flying up from the back and knocks your socks off."
"An orangish brew, a little on the dark side. Slightly hazy. A medium-sized head forms on top and stays, but only for a few minutes. The aroma is a very acidic hoppy one, with a backbone of bready malt. A little alcohol is noticeable too. Flavors include a good amount of hop bitterness in areas, again a bit acidic. Malt is biscuity and bready. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. This beer improves greatly as it warms. Finish is dry and hoppy. Not a bad effort. It resembles something Belgian in subtle ways. Interesting beer."
"I bought this beer due to my familiarity with Red Tail and Blue Heron, both of which I liked. Like other reviewers, I was not aware that this was a strong ale while I was drinking it as the alcohol is well hidden. Perhaps that explains my disappointment with it. It had nice copper color with a head that died rather quickly. More of a malty flavor, didn't notice much in the way of aroma or hops. It was an ok beer, er I mean strong ale, perhaps I may have to give it another chance."
"Poured a light copper color and was a bit cloudy. Bright head which left quickly. I didn't know this was a strong beer when I picked it out. The smell is malty with some sourness in the aroma. Heavy and rich tasting but not too much, as with some other barleywines I've had. There's a hop presence but it seems muted by the malt flavor. The alcohol is hidden. A pretty decent strong ale."
"From Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Took me 2 Mendocino brews to catch the bird theme. Cool! Pours a light amber color with a thin light beige head. Aroma is malty with a hint of alcohol. Flavors of malt and caramel dominate, with a little hops lingering. Finish is somewhat dry. ABV is well hidden. Pretty straightforward beer."
"Had no idea this baby had a higher ABV, that is until I finished it off last night around my fourth beer. You can't even detect the high alcohol in this brew, which can be kind of dangerous. Pours an orange/amber with a copper head that billows pretty thick and eventually settles out. The forefront of flavor is the hop character, and then the malt crashes through (biscuit, caramel?). A very rich and complex ale, that starts with a sweet fruit tone, and then the bitterness of the hop resins marches in to blend quite a well balanced ale. I was also getting a hint of honey, in the finish. Mouthfeel is intriguing, very full just due to the amount of flavor. Medium bodied and overall very delightful ale. Drinkability is fair, but there is alot going on here, kinda complex and high in alcohol to keep throwing these down."
"Eye of the hawk: pours a fairly hazy, reddish golden beer. Nice looking head, some retention. This has a shockingly sweet aroma, although not at all unpleasant. The taste is unusual, there seem to be a lot of hops fighting their way to the top, but not quite getting there. The malt taste seems a little cloying, but flat. Kind of leaves me not really liking this beer. Edited to add: Barley wine? I was thinking maybe an APA. Huh, they hide the booze well."
"I don't think Mendocino meant this to be a barley wine. Strong Ale is more accurate for this brew. There seems to be a good nose on this beer that reminds me of other barley wines I have had; lots of malt and a smoky aroma. The taste is decent but has a bit of an astingent taste that is not quite desirable. There seems to be a nice hopiness to the beer and a good warming effect. There is a consistent malt character throughout. However, that astringency seems to overpower. Not bad but not great."
"Pours a light amber with a fair sized off-white head. Smells of apple and (white raisin?) or grape. Very medicinal and alcohol tasting (almost like a cough syrup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, although I don't go looking for that flavor in a beer. Pretty hoppy. Has a very nice mouthfeel - fairly smooth and thick. The drinkability suffers as a result of the fairly high alcohol content. Holy crap, this is a dangerous beer."
"I suspect this beer is fermented with something similar to Wyeast 3056 Bavarian Wheat yeast, as it has both American Ale and German Wheat characteristics. Pleasant, but the alcohol doesn't jibe very well with the rest of the beer, hampering it's drinkability."
"The pour a limpid golden amber color, with a bit of dross suspended throughout the glass, I happen to like the taste the decocted sediment gives the beer, so I do not filter it out as many do. Head is massive in size, creamy in texture and the resultant lace is a thick clinging sheet to seal off the glass. Aroma of sweet malt dominates, with a hint of sweet country butter and a quite fresh and pleasing nose. Start is sweet, middling top and a serious acidic bite and pleasant hop spicy presence. Aftertaste dry and lingering, a decent drinking beer and could be considered a session beer."
"Poured a hazy orangish color with little head. Fruity aroma. Hops are subdued but present. Kind of fruity, but not terribly so. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Leaves a bit of a lattice down the side of the glass. Minimal carbonation. A solid brew, tasty and for an 8% alchohol brew, hides it quite well. I could drink a few of these easily."
"Poured a light golden color with little to no foam. The aroma was very mild with a hint of hops and spices. I tasted a hint of spices with a grainy finish. There was a slight bitterness on the palate, but, the finish disapated quickly."
"- I have the Black Eye (blended) Ale to review next, wonder if the character of this beer will be destroyed by the Black Hawk Stout ??"
"Medium amber in color with a sticky head that leaves a nice lattice on the glass. Interesting aroma of damp hay, musty grain, and fruity esters. The nose is alcoholic, carrying a strongly fruity malt sweetness. Concentrated flavors of bready pale malt come through towards the end before the hops clean up the finish. It leaves a nice aftertaste of biscuit malt. I'd like to taste the hops a little more, but overall an OK beer, and it looks great with that gummy head."
"Slightly hazy orange amber in hue, covered by a persistent off white bumpy head.  Web like lace is left.  The aroma is comprised of light fruity esters, sweet caramel, biscuit malt, an earthy hop nose w/ hints of woodiness.  Subdued diacetyl butterscotch is present as well.  Fruity sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ensued by notes of buttery toffee and toasty malt.  Lightly tart yeast esters and moderate hop bitterness emerge mid palate.  A bit light in body, but the all around smooth nature of this brew lends excellent drinkability.  Finishes quite clean, w/ mild breadiness fading quickly.  Eye of the Hawk is a flavorful, somewhat understated but highly drinkable strong ale.  Very enjoyable."
"308"
"Flower hop nose with a big handful of malt.  Pale hazy look with a white head.  Very malty taste with a nice smooth mouth.  The finish has a hop bite with a huge alcohol tongue.  This beers warm finish comforts the soul."
"Overall, a good beer, but not great."
"I like this one...broke out a bottle I had stashed in January. Time has done it even more justice, pours a nice off-gold color with a white creamy and long lasting head. Nice slight diacetyl butterscotch & subdued hop nose. Drinks very deceptively, the 8% alcohol is barely noticed. A very nice blend of malt & hop...neither takes the spotlight, they just meld together in a super finish. This is one of the most easy-drinking strong ales I've had the pleasure to drink. From one of the founding breweries of the American microbeer renaissance, even though it's contract brewed in upstate N.Y., it's still a classic."
"A joy to drink.  Hefty malt that is not too sweet.  I was astounded to see that this is 8% abv, certainly deserving the designation ""strong ale.""  I did not find a hint in the flavor, which was rather hazardous, as this is a very easy drinking beer.  More than a couple, and it's snooze time on the couch."
"Probably the best of the Mendocino brews IMHO. It's got all the classic characteristics of a strong ale; beefy malt, alcoholic undertones, subdued hops. Let this one warm a bit after pouring for best results."
"Another one of those beers that I have to look for when I leave Texas.  Clear dark amber color, decent off-white head that leaves only a bit of lace on the side of my glass.  Wonderfully fruity nose.  Heavy malt-fruit flavors that could use a little more hop balance."
"Nothing better than sitting in Hopland and deciding if its better to continue north to Eureka, or go to Fetzer's or just enjoy another Eye of the Hawk.  Wonderfully strong, malty brew - made for a damp Northern California afternoon or night."
"Killer beer, killer not meaing good though. This is a good beer in a way but a bit devious with the 8% abv. We get this beer served in full pints around Boston at regular beer prices, an evil beer to love."
"Great malt presence, citrisy hop flavor, diserving alcohol note.  I love it, if you like Stones Arrogant Bastard you should try this."
"So good."
"Notes: Hot damn! Complex, balanced, dangerously drinkable. A force to be reckoned with, in its own right. Consume with respect."
